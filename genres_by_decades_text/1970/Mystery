Can I do this? What do I do?
Shall I do this?
- Okay.
- There.
I don't have a plate yet.
I've had four in front of me.
How do you like, white or dry?
This one doesn't have any meat.
- Here it is.
- I like white and dark.
Well, give this to whoever's done.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom. Tom.
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject,
Thomas Gruneman?
Yes.
Very well?
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
- Mrs. Gruneman?
- No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Now, Mr. Cable, at the plant, did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
No, not at all. Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Gruneman, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show... any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No. No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention, specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
- No.
- Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant, in one of the drawers, a letter, a typewritten letter, that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City, and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her, and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter,
Mrs. Gruneman.
I would like to see it.
I'd like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique, Mrs. Gruneman.
A man will lead... a double life, a Jekyll-and-Hyde existence, and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for...
and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
Well, I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
if you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before, paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have a feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because
I have a good imagination,
and I like... pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be
free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice 'cause they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt...
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that. You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy
is to let it all hang out, you know.
Do it all and fuck it.
- Hi. Would you stand up, please?
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Okay. Hi. Can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
- Take your hair... your hat off.
- Take my hair off?
Yeah. Okay.
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.
- She's kind of exotic.
- That's the coloring.
The coloring is great.
Yeah, I don't know.
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.
Hello. Can I see your hands?
- Mmm.
- Thank you.
- She has some funny hands.
- Yeah.
- No.
- No.
- Hi.
- She is great. Beautiful eyes.
Yes, lovely. That's the coloring.
Yeah. Let me see you smile.
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great. But I've seen you before.
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?
- Yes, I have.
- You have?
How could they send us people with a conflict?
- I don't believe this.
- Call that agency.
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.
- C minus.
- C minus.
Got to find her today.
- Okay, that's it. Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.
Bring the next group, please.
I'm exhausted. One more day of this, and I'll pull out my hair.
Hello. Hi.
Okay, ladies, just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Gruneman's been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Gruneman nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
Therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has a great many ideas about the case.
You ever done any missing persons work before?
No.
Have you spent any time in the city?
No.
Speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute.
Frankly.
He's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance, expecting your boy Gruneman to show up there.
He didn't. We arrested her on a CP charge.
Convicted. Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence, she cooperated.
She thought she remembered Gruneman from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl,
she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents,
like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Gruneman's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina. Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick 50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Yeah.
Right.
Terrific. Yeah. Bye.
Hi. I'm Bree.
Yeah. Uh, come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
- Um...
- Where you from?
Can I get you a drink?
I'd like a ginger ale. Thank you.
That would be nice.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
Often? No, I don't come to New York too often.
- Two or three times a year, maybe.
- That's too bad.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could...
We could have a nice half-and-half party for 50.
Mm-hmm.
We could have a good time for 50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
Um... Yeah. Have...
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...
- Tell me. What do you want? Tell me.
- I mean...
Tell me what you want. Hmm?
Oh, wow.
Wow. That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting, but it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be 100.
- Sure. Fine. Oh, yes. Very good.
- Yeah.
- Very good.
Mmm. I like to get business out of the way at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it.
Then we can... just have a good time.
Mmm. I like your mind.
- Yeah.
- So.
Chicago.
Is this the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice. Very nice. Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here. Come here.
Oh, my angel. Oh, my angel.

At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
Who is it?
Miss Daniel, my name is Klute. John Klute.
- I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?
My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Gruneman.
- Who?
- Tom Gruneman. He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania, and he disappeared from there last December.
- And I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?
You know what I'm talking about,
Miss Daniel.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions, please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions.
Uh-huh.
They're not very recent.
That's last year.
They're quite good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Tell me, what have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
Well, I study with George Tainter.
George? George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
And I've been in two of his productions... workshop-type productions.
Workshop.
They're very nice. Very nice.
Tell me, how do you feel about being an actress?
- I like it very much.
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you think you know yourself?
- I like acting.
- As much as anybody, I guess.
- Do you really know yourself?
- No.
- That's very important.
- I forget myself when I act.
- No, you can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
- Relate to people.
- Mmm.
I had an identity crisis two years ago, and since then,
I've been working to know myself.
That's very important. Very...
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face.
Excuse me. Just a second.
Jillian? Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
It was wonderful for you to stop by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway or...
How are you today?
I'm not gonna be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I've been coming here all this time and paying you all this money.
Why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me what your problem was, and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going out on a call as a model or as an actress, and as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl, you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me, and that's terrific, but they want a woman.
And I know I'm good.
And I arrive at their hotel or their apartment... and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
And for an hour... for an hour,
I'm the best actress in the world, and the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why'd you say you're the best actress in the world at that time?
Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to... care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just...
You just... lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go in.
And you get a lot of money out of them in as short a period of time as possible.
And you control it, and you call the shots.
And I always feel just great afterwards.
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.
Why not?
- You said there's nothing wrong with it.
- There's a difference...
I don't think there's anything wrong with it... morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I... I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel... that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life, that I could determine things for myself.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight. Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay. See you in an hour.
Bree.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
Here.
Enjoy.
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.
I just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I... well, I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
And a very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
And then one night... at the gambling tables...
I saw him.
A stranger. He was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room.
And his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that, for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young. He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
And the next day on the beach, in my beach pavilion... it was so warm on the sand.
And I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
I've never liked young men.
And I knew that... that he would awaken something in me... that no young man had ever awakened.
He was...
He was so wise.
And he taught me so many things... with his hands... and with his mind.
I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniels. Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard.
Is this the shakedown, hon?
- You picked a loser. I don't have it.
- I'm looking for Tom...
Jesus. You think I'd be living in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
I'd be back on Park Avenue.
Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
Look, I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub.
Yeah, they showed me that already.
- I understand this is Gruneman.
- Mm-hmm.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man, it figures.
Look, will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago...
I was in the life full-time, living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me, they caged me.
Started asking me about a guy, some guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that.
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen.
Gruneman, what does that mean?
It's a name. I don't know him.
They start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's Gruneman."
So would you please tell us when you and he...
Well, there was a guy... once, a freak.
Could have been him. Apparently,
Gruneman liked to beat up on girls.
And, well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me.
That was about two years ago.
Tommy baby, olly, olly, in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up, you wear a dress with a cloth belt, and they pretend to whip you.
It's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle "Maytime," except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Gruneman?
I can't identify him as anybody.
So... is that it?
Listen... why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes, and bring them back up here... and we'll have a party, you and I?
Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, about the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it? The phone rings, you answer, there's nobody there.
Kids getting their kicks, burglars finding out if the apartment's empty.
It happens all the time in New York.
It doesn't mean anything.
You reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been... leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Yeah, okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings, that's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Or sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people, hear things.
Or I go out in the morning and think somebody's been prying open my mailbox.
Or if there's trash in front of my door,
I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves. I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniels.
How is Ted? Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I...
Actually, I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private de...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Somebody gives your name to somebody else?
Most of them, yeah.
And that how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago. God.
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
Oh, you're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is gonna amuse you too.
But I'm trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that? Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old.
His wife is dead, he's been cutting garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation, and I'm all he's got.
And he never lays a hand on me.
What harm is there in that?
And what's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker? A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
- Like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
He was my old man. We broke up.
When? When did you break up?
About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that, ple...
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring you some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me, and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Oh.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit. Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
- You didn't get him.
- No.
Was it Gruneman?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid. I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say, not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right. I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do.
And, in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice
'cause they're so nice to overcome.
'Cause I'm very bad. I...
In what way? How are you bad?
In my head, I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure as you're sitting at your great desk,
you have all kinds ofstrange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to...
is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work, mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.
You know, I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice. Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Gruneman.
Miss Daniels tells me the date that beat her up two years ago might've been that man, and that you sent her on that date.
Two years ago? Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your... arms.
I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter between the girls.
Had two other girls then, two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna, she blows a little jealous of Bree, you know?
Bree comes first.
And evidently she knew this freak, beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree.
So Bree'd get hurt.
I didn't know till afterwards.
You can't tell them that one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that, I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn.
- Arlyn...
Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know. She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco. They just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page.
She's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Hey.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls. Ah!
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Well, tell me, Klute.
Did we get you a little, huh?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk?
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness, huh?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off.
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang.
That was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner, where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger... or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside, my voices are in them.
- Hark.
- Not so... Gently.
Do you hear?
♪ Dear child of God ♪
That's just what you said.
At the half hour, they will say:
♪ Be brave, go on ♪
At the three-quarters, they will say:
♪ I am thy help ♪
But it is at the hour when the great bell goes after:
♪ God will save France ♪
It is then that St. Margaret and St. Cath...
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Script, please.
- Very interesting accent.
- Thank you.
Booth.
Thank you.
All right. So what do you want, cop?
I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him.
If I can't find him, you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost. Time is money.
Okay, well, I can pay you $100.
A hundred dollars.
I can make that at a lunch break.
A hundred dollars is all I've got.
Hey, you were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
- Buy you lunch. You want lunch?
- Mmm.
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.
I said, Monday, 8:00 p.m., baby.
Now, don't be naughty.
He's a lovely man.
Comes here, spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants, but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p.m., Monday, Mr. Clean.
Now, Arlyn Page, I had to let her go.
No. With the kind of people I get here,
I couldn't have a gal who was half zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble.
And I don't allow any trouble here.
Che cipuò fare?
Honi soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Oh, try Momma Reese's.
Bree... if you ever get lonely, or you haven't got any place else to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on 1st.
You know that sweet place?
We could've had everything together, everything.
Then the bitch sold my mink.
Do you know anybody that's seen her, at all?
As far as I'm concerned, she's dead.
Okay.
Who is it?
Bree Daniels.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in, yeah.
Oh, it's probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
If you'd like to go back upstairs,
I'd come...
I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here? Sleep here.
- Come on.
- Where are you going to sleep?
I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Hi.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue.
I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page? Yeah, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it 8th?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yeah, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore? Yeah. I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out.
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore.
Cappy?
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree.
Cappy, is that you?
It's all right.
Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey, I'm waiting for someone.
You've gotta help us.
We've gotta ask you some questions.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take a couple of minutes.
Ask her.
A couple of years ago with Frankie and Jane,
- Jane sent me a guy that beat up on me.
- If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yeah. What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy. Guy was older.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you.
It's very important, please.
Can you give me a description of him?
Cappy.
Cappy, listen. Don't...
Listen to me. Cappy!
Cappy, don't run, Cappy.
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio. Cappy!

She wouldn't be reliable anyhow, a narcotics addict.
Well, I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Gruneman.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected to the case because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
I think the only way I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try and secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday, and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
'Cause I'm very bad.
I have very wicked ideas.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your great desk,
you have all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
Better. I think people wear clothes much too often.
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be
free of clothing and inhibition.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy
is to let it all hang out.
Do it all and fuck it.
I was trying to get away from... a world that I had... that I had known because
I don't think it was very good for me... and I found myself... looking up its ass... and seeing people that I used to know and that I... that I liked a lot... that were my friends... sort of... girls... and... that could've been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
Ah, well, I guess I just realized that... that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless...
and be left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Ah.
- Yeah.
- Jane McKenna.
I thought there'd be more.
Well, there's this man that I... this detective...
and I don't know exactly what is...
happening or what he wants out of me or anything like that,
but he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
When you're used to being lonely, and you...
somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary, I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scary?
Angry.
At whom?
Whoever it is that's making me feel that way.
Do you feel angry at him?
A lot of the time.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to...
manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull, propellers washed it up on top.
"Arlyn Page" was probably an alias.
- I'm sorry...
- Hey, man, can you... can you help me out?
Yeah. Yeah. What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean, it's... that's my baby, dead.
And I got to get up.
I mean, you don't know what it means, my baby, dead.
- Got to get up.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Lieutenant Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down a check on everybody who knew Tom Gruneman.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down a check on everything,
I guess.
I'll talk to you.
You're up, eh?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything... but just as a precaution... when you go out, if you'd tell me where you're gonna go, a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
Yeah, I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel... my body feels...
I enjoy... making love with him... which is a very baffling and bewildering thing for me, because I've never felt that before.
I just wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know, for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, all the time,
I keep feeling the need to destroy it, to break it off, to go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's gonna end, because I had more control before when I was with tricks.
At least I knew what I was doing, and I was setting everything up. Now I...
And that's what's so strange, is that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is, I mean...
You obviously know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing, and it's so strange, the sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else... without its being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly, he's seen me... mean, he's seen me whorey... and it doesn't seem to matter... and he seems to accept me...
And I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me, and I... and I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yeah.
You know what?
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yeah.
Well, listen, Martha, why don't you try to get somebody else, and if I change my mind,
I'll call you, okay?
Good-bye.
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Can I have a bag, please?
- A couple of bags, please.
- All right.
All right.
Well, yeah, let me see how much those weigh.
Okay, let me have some of those small tomatoes.
No mushy ones.
Yeah, okay, thanks.
- What you got in your bag?
- What?
What have you got in your bag?
- Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
- Cantaloupe?
- How much for it?
- Dollar-50.
Wait.
He cut up my clo...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Hello.
I can be a very bad girl.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
There's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy
is to let it all hang out.
Do it all and fuck it.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
It could've been on a...
It could've been hidden in his pocket.
I've seen one of those.
All right, I'll wait for you here.
Bree.
Trask and some officers are going to come and examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree.
Bree?
You look like you've been with many women,
but I didn't know if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
You wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's because it... obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
You know that I will do anything you ask or you want
since you know that there are no limits to my imagination,
and I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Gruneman's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Gruneman.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said, "Check out everybody."
Same margins, top and sides, but he does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations from outside keys.
Notice how invariably he does that with the T and the H.
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, John, but I'm rushed for time.
I have an important business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case.
I think I can close the case if I can have $500 to purchase
Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand. What do you mean?
I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniels.
He's also the man who came into Bree Daniels' apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB and Tom's was type A, so it wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and killed Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that possibly Tom is dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him, and I need the money before tomorrow night.
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.
He'll come to my apartment and bring the book.
At what time?
About 8:30.
All right, fine. I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl's got a very big apartment, lots of room.
It's not necessarily how it looks.
Look, we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you gotta respect her too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniels, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service.
I'm sure she'll get back to you as soon as she has a chance.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home, I promise.
Can I use your phone?
Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Senior.
I've got to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Uh-huh.
Detective Trask, please.
Hi. John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he canceled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
She's left. I'll find her.
Okay. Well, I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello. What can I do for you?
I'm sorry. I mean Mr. Goldfarb Senior.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.
No, really, I don't mind.
You're gonna miss your train,
Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me,
Bree Daniels?
Oh! I thought that was for tomorrow.
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Oh, yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture.
Yes, right away. Bye-bye.
We're closing now, miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniels.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, would you tell her I'm at 246-1383?
And I'll wait here about five minutes.
Can you tell me how I can get in touch with the doctor?
Doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniels.
Bree? I'm sorry, sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
I believe Miss Daniels did leave a forwarding number.
- Can you give me that number?
- We can't give out that information.
I'm a police officer.
Don't make me prove this. It's important.
Sorry. You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
Yeah, I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior, but...
Do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect.
And I would feel, personally, very uncomfortable to be... connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
And I know he's trying to acquire
Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes, Jane McKenna's book.
And I'll try to get it for you.
No. Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will. I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented?
Is this a trap for me?
Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I have no idea what I'm going to do.
And I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
But yet I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Gruneman discovered me.
We were here on business together, and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical, and she started screaming, and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall, it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood really why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
And it was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face... and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me, within the company.
And I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could, you see?
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't. I do understand. I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
And you're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your lives, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say... that there are little corners in everyone... which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
But that's your stock-in-trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
And I was never really fully aware of mine... until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
About five miles outside of New York.
Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation,
which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
Obviously, I would not be telling you these things
if my intentions weren't honorable.
Oh. You look familiar to me.
In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before. About two years ago.
And I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page, and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen, I've got to get out of here.
I mean, I can't...
What's the matter?
- I remember you.
- What do you remember?
You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay. Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay. Why don't you just tell me what you'd like,
and then after you tell me what you'd like...
I'd like to spend just some time with you.
I have been looking for you for two years.
Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
- It's all right.
- No, it's not all right.
Of course you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
But you have to tell me first, and then...
And if that's what you want, that's fine.
Arlyn, why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable?
I'll not strap you in or tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable. Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
Why don't you take your clo...
I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
- Hmm.
- Turn your head.
Like that.
No! No!
Oh.
I've explained to him what I have to do,
and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
We're so different...
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me,
it's notgonna be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora,
and darning socks and doing all that.
I mean, that's just...
I'd go out ofmy mind.
I don't know how I feel about him. I...
- It's so hard for me to say it! God!
- To say what?
I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniels.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now, and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you. Good-bye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just... I can't stay in the city.
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
<b>YOURVICEE IS A LOCEKED ROOM</b>
<b>AND ONLY I HAVETHE KEY</b>
<b>Ah yes!</b>
<b>She defnitely deserved being</b>
<b>compared to Mary Stuart.</b>
<b>No-one else has been represented</b>
<b>in such different ways,</b>
<b>as a murderer or a martyr.</b>
<b>But she was a woman,</b>
<b>a great woman.</b>
<b>Seems his mother was</b>
<b>an important actress.</b>
<b>Yes, she made a career passing</b>
<b>from one bed to another.</b>
<b>To my mother!</b>
<b>He misses his mother,</b>
<b>it happens a lot with Italians.</b>
<b>What about you?</b>
<b>Not drinking?</b>
<b>Well, you sons of bitches</b>
<b>-even kids use the</b>
<b>term these days -</b>
<b>offer my wife something to drink.</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>Be generous...</b>
<b>to my wife!</b>
<b>Drink.</b>
<b>Maybe you'd prefer drinking</b>
<b>from my empty skull?</b>
<b>Oliviero,</b>
<b>I don't want to.</b>
<b>-To our health, my wife.</b>
<b>- Oliviero!</b>
<b>Drink it down.</b>
<b>Yes my dear,</b>
<b>we have a Visigoth education</b>
<b>here in Veneto.</b>
<b>I'm sorry, mistress,</b>
<b>maybe I got the measures wrong.</b>
<b>Where are you going?</b>
<b>This is Brenda.</b>
<b>Not bad for a maid, eh?</b>
<b>Losing the CEolonies and gaining</b>
<b>a servant like Brenda</b>
<b>was a good deal.</b>
<b>You have a weakness for</b>
<b>black women, Oliviero?</b>
<b>White males have always felt that way.</b>
<b>Perhaps a black woman</b>
<b>is everyone's secret dream.</b>
<b>It's clothes that ruin the world.</b>
<b>Naked, we're all the same.</b>
<b>It's so easy for these youngsters</b>
<b>to think they're something</b>
<b>as soon as it's obvious that</b>
<b>they're actually nothing.</b>
<b>How dare you wear that?</b>
<b>Why, doesn't seeing me dressed</b>
<b>like her turn you on?</b>
<b>You wanted to put on</b>
<b>a show like always,</b>
<b>so why not in costume?</b>
<b>What was your mother to you,</b>
<b>Maria the madwoman</b>
<b>or bloodthirsty Maria?</b>
<b>You're a whore,</b>
<b>a dirty whore.</b>
<b>They drink, damn but they drink!</b>
<b>I've nothing against drinking, CEhrist knows.</b>
<b>I like raising a glass now and then</b>
<b>but they never stop,</b>
<b>it's every single night.</b>
<b>They always have friends</b>
<b>visiting, Mrs Molinari.</b>
<b>Friends? They're the crazies</b>
<b>from the campsite...</b>
<b>lunatics, krauts</b>
<b>and foreigners.</b>
<b>Oh Jesus, I'm not talking about you,</b>
<b>but Mr Oliviero freQuents</b>
<b>certain people...</b>
<b>And just think I saw</b>
<b>him being born!</b>
<b>I was a servant in this house</b>
<b>when his mother</b>
<b>the CEountess was a girl...</b>
<b>what times!</b>
<b>Hello, Satan!</b>
<b>He's the only intelligent</b>
<b>animal in the area.</b>
<b>Have a bit of respect for</b>
<b>this poor old woman!</b>
<b>Hello.</b>
<b>Listen, Dario, seeing as</b>
<b>you know the maid,</b>
<b>why don't you put in a good word</b>
<b>for me with the mistress!</b>
<b>Having both of them would be fne with me,</b>
<b>I've always liked white coffee in bed.</b>
<b>Forget it, they're not for you.</b>
<b>You can't even imagine what</b>
<b>goes on at Villa Ruvigny.</b>
<b>Dealing with international couriers</b>
<b>is getting more diffcult every</b>
<b>day Mr Ruvigny,</b>
<b>ordering books from Paris or London</b>
<b>means waiting months,</b>
<b>even if things go well.</b>
<b>Usual place tonight?</b>
<b>Alright,</b>
<b>but it's not defnite,</b>
<b>I might be busy.</b>
<b>Listen, the excuse of being busy</b>
<b>doesn't work with me.</b>
<b>You started working on me</b>
<b>over the high school desks,</b>
<b>teacher, and now</b>
<b>you'll pay the price.</b>
<b>How are things going, Mr Ruvigny?</b>
<b>Of course, my dear.</b>
<b>Put it on my account, Bartoli.</b>
<b>Certainly.</b>
<b>I often ask myself why Zenit</b>
<b>don't reprint your books,</b>
<b>I'd love to see them</b>
<b>in the shop window again.</b>
<b>You really should find another</b>
<b>publisher, Mr Ruvigny.</b>
<b>-Good bye.</b>
<b>- Always at your service.</b>
<b>I'll kill you one of these days.</b>
<b>Even if I have to stuff you</b>
<b>with cyanide, I'll kill you.</b>
<b>How do you intend to exorcise Satan,</b>
<b>with a broom?</b>
<b>Ijust want him to stay away</b>
<b>from my doves.</b>
<b>Are you dining in town tonight?</b>
<b>Maybe.</b>
<b>Help!</b>
<b>Help!</b>
<b>Help!</b>
<b>No</b>
<b>Oliviero.</b>
<b>Oliviero!</b>
<b>-What?</b>
<b>- Someone's coming.</b>
<b>- Someone?</b>
<b>-Yes, it's a police car.</b>
<b>What could they</b>
<b>want from us?</b>
<b>I didn't hear you</b>
<b>come in last night.</b>
<b>Brenda's not here so you'll have to get it.</b>
<b>Get dressed.</b>
<b>- In a deep sleep, aren't they inspector?</b>
<b>-Yep.</b>
<b>-Good morning.</b>
<b>- Mr Ruvigny?</b>
<b>-What do you want?</b>
<b>- I apologise...</b>
<b>I apologise for the unusual hour,</b>
<b>I'm Inspector Farla.</b>
<b>It's a bother I know,</b>
<b>but I have to ask you</b>
<b>some Questions.</b>
<b>About what?</b>
<b>Something...</b>
<b>private.</b>
<b>I am Oliviero Ruvigny.</b>
<b>I know you very well Mr Ruvigny,</b>
<b>at least by name.</b>
<b>Even we Inspectors are victims</b>
<b>of compulsory education...</b>
<b>We occasionally read books.</b>
<b>Perhaps it would be better</b>
<b>if we went inside, Mr Ruvigny.</b>
<b>Of course, come with me.</b>
<b>I understand it won't</b>
<b>be pleasant for madam,</b>
<b>but I'd like to exchange</b>
<b>some words in private.</b>
<b>Why? I've got no</b>
<b>secrets from my wife.</b>
<b>As you prefer,</b>
<b>it'll be Quicker.</b>
<b>You made a date for last night</b>
<b>with a shop assistant</b>
<b>from the Roma Bookshop,</b>
<b>am I wrong?</b>
<b>Who, Fausta?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>we used to see each other a lot,</b>
<b>inspector, but definitely not last night.</b>
<b>I was a teacher atTasso</b>
<b>High School ten years ago</b>
<b>and Fausta was one of my students.</b>
<b>And they speak badly of students!</b>
<b>To keep a friendship going</b>
<b>with her own teacher for ten years.</b>
<b>It's lovely, don't you agree,</b>
<b>madam?</b>
<b>Very...</b>
<b>Oliviero's students always had</b>
<b>a great weakness for him.</b>
<b>I expect it's a school desk complex.</b>
<b>How much sugar?</b>
<b>None thank you madam.</b>
<b>If I understand correctly,</b>
<b>- Fausta's accused me of not going on a date?</b>
<b>-Vittorio.</b>
<b>She probably didn't have time.</b>
<b>We don't believe she died accidentally,</b>
<b>Mr Ruvigny.</b>
<b>It really is Fausta.</b>
<b>- But who could have...</b>
<b>- ...killed her so horribly?</b>
<b>That's what we've got to fnd out.</b>
<b>All we know for now</b>
<b>is she was killed...</b>
<b>with a curved blade,</b>
<b>a sickle perhaps.</b>
<b>Mr Ruvigny...</b>
<b>where were you from 8 till 10,</b>
<b>from 8 till 10 last night?</b>
<b>I was here in the villa,</b>
<b>my wife can confirm it.</b>
<b>Ah...</b>
<b>I see.</b>
<b>Can anyone else confrm it,</b>
<b>a servant for example?</b>
<b>We have a coloured woman with us.</b>
<b>It was her day off yesterday</b>
<b>and she stayed out last night as well.</b>
<b>- No guests in the villa last night?</b>
<b>-Why?</b>
<b>I'm talking about the inhabitants</b>
<b>from that amusing asylum</b>
<b>called Mondial CEamping.</b>
<b>You know, madam,</b>
<b>that the most popular</b>
<b>entertainment in town is gossiping.</b>
<b>No, no-one was</b>
<b>here last night.</b>
<b>Fine. Sorry to disturb you,</b>
<b>but I don't think this'll</b>
<b>be the last time.</b>
<b>A crime in these parts</b>
<b>raises a lot of dust.</b>
<b>You don't have any plans</b>
<b>to travel do you Mr Ruvigny?</b>
<b>-Travel? No nothing.</b>
<b>- I thought so</b>
<b>a writer has his world inside him.</b>
<b>Anyway, don't go far from the villa.</b>
<b>Of course, inspector.</b>
<b>-Goodbye, madam.</b>
<b>- Goodbye.</b>
<b>The bookseller probably</b>
<b>overheard our conversation.</b>
<b>That girl tormented me for years</b>
<b>...unbearable.</b>
<b>She didn't want to accept</b>
<b>it was fnished.</b>
<b>But thanks, anyway.</b>
<b>You could have given me up</b>
<b>and sent me inside.</b>
<b>I was late last night</b>
<b>because I had a problem,</b>
<b>- I punctured a tyre.</b>
<b>- I didn't ask any Questions.</b>
<b>Right, but you think I could</b>
<b>easily cut a lover's throat.</b>
<b>A bad writer but a</b>
<b>good sadistic murderer.</b>
<b>Who knows if I'll</b>
<b>become one some day,</b>
<b>and it'll be your throat's turn?</b>
<b>-You don't ask Questions, eh!</b>
<b>- Leave me alone.</b>
<b>I had the tyre repaired,</b>
<b>don't you forget it.</b>
<b>Be careful what you say and do,</b>
<b>very careful!</b>
<b>Oliviero!</b>
<b>The kids from the campsite</b>
<b>are here, sir.</b>
<b>Shall I let them in?</b>
<b>Send them away.</b>
<b>I've already got two tarts living here...</b>
<b>Get lost.</b>
<b>Go away!</b>
<b>The police...</b>
<b>You've got to call the police!</b>
<b>The police? They already</b>
<b>suspect me for one girl</b>
<b>it'd be like putting a noose around my neck.</b>
<b>They'd say I'm a maniac, a homicidal maniac.</b>
<b>-You've got to!</b>
<b>- I can't, Irene.</b>
<b>They'd never believe it wasn't me...</b>
<b>And neither do you.</b>
<b>Please help me.</b>
<b>We've got to do something...</b>
<b>we've got to hide the corpse.</b>
<b>- Hide the corpse?</b>
<b>-Of course.</b>
<b>Listen, Irene,</b>
<b>no-one will look for her.</b>
<b>We'll say she left...</b>
<b>Yes, she left and we</b>
<b>don't know anything.</b>
<b>In the cellar...</b>
<b>we've got to hide her</b>
<b>in a wall in the cellar,</b>
<b>and no-one will ever fnd her...</b>
<b>No-one will ever fnd her.</b>
<b>We've got to remove the stains,</b>
<b>really clean it.</b>
<b>-Why don't you bury it with her?</b>
<b>- No, I can't.</b>
<b>You know I can't.</b>
<b>Damn, you can see it.</b>
<b>Wow, what legs!</b>
<b>Put it over there.</b>
<b>Why you, Madam?</b>
<b>Isn't Brenda here?</b>
<b>- She left.</b>
<b>- Left for good?</b>
<b>Just think...</b>
<b>Why, is something wrong?</b>
<b>Nothing. It's just that I got on well</b>
<b>with the blonde.</b>
<b>I called her 'the blonde' as a joke.</b>
<b>Oh, I almost forgot, a telegram.</b>
<b>Pegolotti gave it to me at the post offce.</b>
<b>So I did two jobs in one journey.</b>
<b>- A telegram?</b>
<b>-Yes. I hope it's good news.</b>
<b>ARRIVE MONDAYTRAIN 15;00.</b>
<b>GREETINGS FLORIANA</b>
<b>That snotty pain in the arse.</b>
<b>She chose the perfect time</b>
<b>to come and get under our feet.</b>
<b>-Was she at our wedding?</b>
<b>- I think so.</b>
<b>My sister brought</b>
<b>her from Paris.</b>
<b>Your niece will be 20 now.</b>
<b>Right.</b>
<b>- Hey!</b>
<b>-What did he do?</b>
<b>He touched me here!</b>
<b>Well it's big, but it doesn't</b>
<b>break any boundaries!</b>
<b>What a cheek!</b>
<b>Giovanna,</b>
<b>welcome back!</b>
<b>If you'd have touched</b>
<b>the old woman's arse</b>
<b>- I'd have cut your hand off!</b>
<b>- Soldiers...</b>
<b>what do you expect when</b>
<b>there are no brothels any more?</b>
<b>She wasn't on it.</b>
<b>Lets go.</b>
<b>What an idiot! First she invites herself,</b>
<b>then she makes us</b>
<b>come out here for nothing.</b>
<b>It's just as well.</b>
<b>Hello, Oliviero!</b>
<b>Thanks. Bye.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>
<b>I hitched.</b>
<b>The lieutenant was very kind,</b>
<b>he has to go to the airport</b>
<b>but he made a detour for me.</b>
<b>-Why the face?</b>
<b>- I'm shocked. Are you...</b>
<b>Floriana, yes...</b>
<b>be watchful with shocks,</b>
<b>at your age you might</b>
<b>have a heart attack!</b>
<b>- How are you Irene?</b>
<b>- Fine, dear.</b>
<b>It's pointless asking how you are,</b>
<b>you look wonderful.</b>
<b>Lets go.The sooner</b>
<b>we arrive at the villa</b>
<b>the sooner we can have a drink.</b>
<b>-Give it to me, I'll carry it.</b>
<b>-Thanks.</b>
<b>How many rooms are there?</b>
<b>Too many.</b>
<b>But we've emptied a lot of them,</b>
<b>they were dangerous.</b>
<b>One of these days the roof</b>
<b>will fall in on our heads.</b>
<b>I've never had that feeling,</b>
<b>I've never had a roof of my own.</b>
<b>Being a genius doesn't pay,</b>
<b>does it?</b>
<b>Oliviero's sure the novel's dead.</b>
<b>In truth it's he who's dead.</b>
<b>He hasn't been able to write</b>
<b>a sentence for years.</b>
<b>The only thing he can sell</b>
<b>these days is the furniture.</b>
<b>It's only a cat,</b>
<b>a beautiful one too.</b>
<b>You're scared of it?</b>
<b>It's called Satan.</b>
<b>It was his mother's.</b>
<b>Aunt Ester's?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Oh...</b>
<b>Well, well,</b>
<b>a black stocking!</b>
<b>What's it for, Irene, a fetish?</b>
<b>Give it to me!</b>
<b>It was left by a girl</b>
<b>we used to have.</b>
<b>She left, but she wasn't</b>
<b>much of a maid.</b>
<b>Coming, Flo?</b>
<b>So, in Paris you lived</b>
<b>in a commune?</b>
<b>Yes, for six months.</b>
<b>What did you do there?</b>
<b>Just about everything.</b>
<b>Hear that, Irene?</b>
<b>A commune would do you good.</b>
<b>Where the women</b>
<b>are everyone's.</b>
<b>Where the men</b>
<b>are everyone's!</b>
<b>He's a bit retarded about sex</b>
<b>and terrifed of impotence,</b>
<b>literary impotence of course.</b>
<b>Sex is an activity that's only interests</b>
<b>those who have imagination</b>
<b>as well as the means.</b>
<b>Irene has neither.</b>
<b>Hasn't the tired illustrious writer</b>
<b>forgotten something?</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>The means and imagination, yes...</b>
<b>and something else.</b>
<b>Go and see who it is.</b>
<b>Good evening.</b>
<b>The gate was open.</b>
<b>They told me to deliver</b>
<b>this to you.</b>
<b>-Thank you. Good night.</b>
<b>-Good night.</b>
<b>What is it?</b>
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>-You sent it out to be cleaned!</b>
<b>- No, I didn't.</b>
<b>Lets go upstairs.</b>
<b>No Oliviero,</b>
<b>I beg you!</b>
<b>Irene.</b>
<b>Irene!</b>
<b>Oliviero?</b>
<b>-What's going on?</b>
<b>- Nothing, nothing serious.</b>
<b>Irene doesn't feel well.</b>
<b>She's a bit tired, that's all.</b>
<b>- Perhaps she needs something?</b>
<b>- No!</b>
<b>She doesn't need anything,</b>
<b>I told you she's just tired.</b>
<b>We don't have any servants.</b>
<b>I'm tired too, my journey</b>
<b>was Quite demanding.</b>
<b>I'm going to bed.</b>
<b>Who is it?</b>
<b>I'm sorry, but I've got some</b>
<b>old notes in that wardrobe.</b>
<b>Need some writing paper?</b>
<b>No, I'm just writing down</b>
<b>some addresses.</b>
<b>Like your niece, do you?</b>
<b>Whatever Oliviero Ruvigny's</b>
<b>state might be today</b>
<b>married or not, decadent or not</b>
<b>Floriana is willing to bring pleasure into his life</b>
<b>in the name of depravation.</b>
<b>Listen...how come you</b>
<b>decided to come here?</b>
<b>I've wanted to come here</b>
<b>since I found out Aunt Ester died.</b>
<b>And what did you</b>
<b>fnd out about me?</b>
<b>The usual stuff.</b>
<b>That since you got married</b>
<b>your mind's been frazzled.</b>
<b>That you're a pig, an alcoholic,</b>
<b>a drug addict,</b>
<b>etcetera, etcetera...</b>
<b>Etcetera, etcetera...</b>
<b>Tell me...</b>
<b>is it true you slept with</b>
<b>your mother in her bed?</b>
<b>I mean when you'd grown up?</b>
<b>Is it true you're a two bit tart?</b>
<b>Well, it could be two bits well-spent...</b>
<b>Irene!</b>
<b>Why did he lock</b>
<b>you in here?</b>
<b>He told me you weren't well.</b>
<b>-Can you make it to my bedroom?</b>
<b>-Yes</b>
<b>-Where is he?</b>
<b>- I heard him leave just now.</b>
<b>Bloody hell, why didn't</b>
<b>you ask for help?</b>
<b>He's a damn sadist.</b>
<b>You don't know,</b>
<b>you don't know.</b>
<b>He's sick, he scares me.</b>
<b>You mean he's mad?</b>
<b>Sometimes he doesn't</b>
<b>know what he's doing.</b>
<b>Come on, lets go to my room.</b>
<b>I knew Oliviero's family</b>
<b>were crazy but...</b>
<b>a doctor must be involved.</b>
<b>No, no, no.</b>
<b>No doctors,</b>
<b>no outsiders.</b>
<b>Irene, I want to help you,</b>
<b>you've got to trust me.</b>
<b>What's going on?</b>
<b>The police came...</b>
<b>a few days ago.</b>
<b>They'd found the body of a girl...</b>
<b>who was murdered.</b>
<b>Now you know everything.</b>
<b>But you can't live with someone</b>
<b>you think's a murderer.</b>
<b>I beg you, Floriana,</b>
<b>not a word to Oliviero</b>
<b>about what I told you.</b>
<b>If he thinks...</b>
<b>my God, he'd kill me.</b>
<b>Not while I'm here.</b>
<b>You're burning up,</b>
<b>you've got the fever.</b>
<b>You've nothing</b>
<b>to worry about,</b>
<b>I won't say a word.</b>
<b>I'm on your side,</b>
<b>you know.</b>
<b>You're so sweet.</b>
<b>- But now...</b>
<b>-What?</b>
<b>Now you know everything</b>
<b>you'll want to leave.</b>
<b>And you'd be right.</b>
<b>I haven't even considered it.</b>
<b>We two must be allies.</b>
<b>Allies.</b>
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>
<b>Yes?</b>
<b>Oh, good evening sir.</b>
<b>Giovanna's just arrived</b>
<b>from Brescia today.</b>
<b>Oh yes, she's</b>
<b>just like a lioness!</b>
<b>Yes, tomorrow.</b>
<b>Tonight?!</b>
<b>She's tired, poor girl,</b>
<b>there's been a rush...</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>See you tomorrow, sir.</b>
<b>Complete discretion, sir.</b>
<b>Good night.</b>
<b>Madame, I'm really tired,</b>
<b>I'm going to bed.</b>
<b>Good night, my girl.</b>
<b>Tomorrow starts well:</b>
<b>50,000 a time!</b>
<b>Good night.</b>
<b>-Good night, madame.</b>
<b>-Get some rest.</b>
<b>Madame, is that you?</b>
<b>Sleeping beauty,</b>
<b>got any cream?</b>
<b>Sleeping?</b>
<b>I'd like to wake up with you.</b>
<b>And the cream?</b>
<b>First class.</b>
<b>Really fresh and appreciated</b>
<b>throughout the area.</b>
<b>-You're not Italian, are you.</b>
<b>- Half and half.</b>
<b>I see, so they've conned</b>
<b>another woman.</b>
<b>There was a black woman before you</b>
<b>who said she was eQual</b>
<b>but they got her to be their servant.</b>
<b>Maybe that's why she left.</b>
<b>-You knew her well?</b>
<b>- Like peas in a pod.</b>
<b>- Sorry, do you understand Italian well?</b>
<b>- So she left you?</b>
<b>She disappeared,</b>
<b>one fine morning she was gone.</b>
<b>As long as she didn't</b>
<b>end up like Giovanna...</b>
<b>Meaning?</b>
<b>-Good morning, Mr Ruvigny.</b>
<b>-Good morning.</b>
<b>I'm racing a bike on Sunday.</b>
<b>If you come you'll see</b>
<b>I'm not that sleepy...</b>
<b>They like me, they like me,</b>
<b>that's for sure!</b>
<b>European integration's not bad,</b>
<b>don't you agree Mr Ruvigny?</b>
<b>I'm sorry, inspector,</b>
<b>but I've been really out</b>
<b>of touch for a while.</b>
<b>Integration of what?</b>
<b>Here we are in a peaceful Veneto town,</b>
<b>with German beer,</b>
<b>Scottish whisky...</b>
<b>...and atomic condiments</b>
<b>for everyone.</b>
<b>That's the trouble with you</b>
<b>intellectuals...pessimism.</b>
<b>Is there anything to laugh about?</b>
<b>I didn't think the Homicide SQuad</b>
<b>was a school of humour.</b>
<b>No, Quite the opposite.</b>
<b>We do what we can with</b>
<b>what we've got.</b>
<b>Exceptional eQuipment...</b>
<b>Just think, our forensic scientist's</b>
<b>even got a magnifying glass!</b>
<b>But,joking apart,</b>
<b>I must apologise to you.</b>
<b>Apologise? Why?</b>
<b>- About Bartoli.</b>
<b>- Ah.</b>
<b>-The bookseller.</b>
<b>- His real name's Liguori,</b>
<b>he escaped from Boretto</b>
<b>Psychiatric Prison 8 years ago.</b>
<b>He killed the two girls</b>
<b>in a fit of madness.</b>
<b>Good, so you won't have</b>
<b>any more problems, inspector.</b>
<b>But problems have a trait,</b>
<b>they never end...</b>
<b>Now my dear wife knows</b>
<b>that I didn't kill the girl.</b>
<b>Now she knows but a woodworm's</b>
<b>eroding her brain.</b>
<b>The woodworm's working away</b>
<b>and says he was the murderer,</b>
<b>that the murderer sleeps</b>
<b>next to her in bed.</b>
<b>- Leave me alone, you're drunk!</b>
<b>-Yes, I'm drunk,</b>
<b>like I was drunk that night.</b>
<b>But it wasn't me who</b>
<b>killed the black maid.</b>
<b>I didn't kill that dirty black,</b>
<b>I didn't kill her, it wasn't me!</b>
<b>So why don't you tell the police?</b>
<b>Let me...</b>
<b>You're crazy, you're crazy,</b>
<b>you're killing me...</b>
<b>You're killing me...</b>
<b>Let me go...</b>
<b>Dario Luisetti, number 7,</b>
<b>has taken the lead on lap 5</b>
<b>and looks like he's got the race.</b>
<b>In second place number 3</b>
<b>Armando Gardiglia,</b>
<b>in third LucioTaramaglio</b>
<b>Then there's the Spaniard</b>
<b>Luis Soler-Borrego...</b>
<b>Come on! Quick!</b>
<b>Brilliant!</b>
<b>Come on! Great!</b>
<b>Go on!</b>
<b>Attention please!</b>
<b>A surprise change!</b>
<b>Number 7 Dario Luisetti's</b>
<b>stopped at Broom Bend</b>
<b>with mechanical problems</b>
<b>and maybe he's out for good.</b>
<b>LucioTaramaglio's taken the lead,</b>
<b>followed by Luis Soler-Borrego,</b>
<b>but Armando Gardiglia's</b>
<b>attacking on the bend as well...</b>
<b>Damn! Excuse me,</b>
<b>where's Broom Bend?</b>
<b>Down there.</b>
<b>Thanks.</b>
<b>Son of a bitch!</b>
<b>Piece of shit!</b>
<b>Did you really have to break down</b>
<b>3 laps from the fnish!</b>
<b>Hi, motor-biker!</b>
<b>Look at this!</b>
<b>I've been preparing for this</b>
<b>bloody race for 3 months</b>
<b>and the piston jammed</b>
<b>just when I was winning!!</b>
<b>-What's a piston?</b>
<b>-You can get lost as well!</b>
<b>Come back, Floriana...</b>
<b>I'm sorry.</b>
<b>This race meant everything to me,</b>
<b>understand, everything!</b>
<b>Everything?</b>
<b>See, they're on the last lap...</b>
<b>Lets go.</b>
<b>-Were we are.</b>
<b>-Where?</b>
<b>This is a good spot.</b>
<b>A double parka and a North Pole style</b>
<b>sleeping bag against rheumatism.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Don't tell me you come here</b>
<b>to make love?</b>
<b>Why not? Where should we go,</b>
<b>the Grand Hotel?</b>
<b>And it's more romantic here.</b>
<b>Mind your head.</b>
<b>The bed's ready in a second.</b>
<b>Did you bring the</b>
<b>black girl here too?</b>
<b>Still on about her?</b>
<b>Jealous, are you?</b>
<b>Come on, get undressed,</b>
<b>it's not cold.</b>
<b>CEome on, hurry up.</b>
<b>How many zips have you got?</b>
<b>God, you're taking your time!</b>
<b>Wow... if I win the lottery</b>
<b>I swear I'll get a maid just like you.</b>
<b>Come on, lets seal ourselves inside</b>
<b>and never come out.</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>I like you.</b>
<b>We might or might not do this again,</b>
<b>but no complications, understand?</b>
<b>Who's there?</b>
<b>What do you want?</b>
<b>I'm the rag and bone woman,</b>
<b>I'm here for the bottles.</b>
<b>Go away,</b>
<b>go away!</b>
<b>- So, when will we meet up again?</b>
<b>-Who knows...</b>
<b>- Didn't you like it?</b>
<b>-Of course...</b>
<b>Well, tell me when you're free.</b>
<b>- I'm always free. Bye.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>
<b>You'll give me a heart attack!</b>
<b>What are you doing</b>
<b>here in the dark?</b>
<b>What's up?</b>
<b>What's happened?</b>
<b>Aterrible thing, Flo.</b>
<b>That bloody animal...</b>
<b>I'm scared,</b>
<b>I'm really scared.</b>
<b>Only you can help me.</b>
<b>Calm down, Irene,</b>
<b>calm down.</b>
<b>Explain what happened.</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>that bloody animal,</b>
<b>that diabolical bloody animal.</b>
<b>Irene.</b>
<b>- Is she dead?</b>
<b>-Oh, shut up!</b>
<b>Why did you buy those disgusting things?</b>
<b>Disgusting?</b>
<b>It's a matter of taste...</b>
<b>Satan's crazy for sheep's eyes.</b>
<b>Come on Irene,</b>
<b>it was nothing.</b>
<b>Why don't you go and get her</b>
<b>a cardio-tonic or something?</b>
<b>Satan's on heat as well.</b>
<b>He hasn't been seen</b>
<b>since yesterday.</b>
<b>If life had given me</b>
<b>someone like you,</b>
<b>everything would</b>
<b>have been different.</b>
<b>How young you are...</b>
<b>-Go away, bloody animal!</b>
<b>-CEalm down, it's all over.</b>
<b>They scared you but it was nothing.</b>
<b>Have a drink.</b>
<b>Don't be scared,</b>
<b>he hasn't realised yet.</b>
<b>And luckily the cat's disappeared.</b>
<b>Was the black girl dressed like this</b>
<b>when you killed her?</b>
<b>I'm definitely not Mary Stuart</b>
<b>but then you don't have</b>
<b>Lord Leicester's face.</b>
<b>I learnt something reading this</b>
<b>about the 'bloody letters'</b>
<b>and the battle between</b>
<b>the two Queens...</b>
<b>Edifying, isn't it?</b>
<b>What did Irene tell you?</b>
<b>That she shares her bed with a crazy,</b>
<b>alcoholic murderer?</b>
<b>No, nothing like that.</b>
<b>The poor woman's terrified</b>
<b>because of everything</b>
<b>that's happened.</b>
<b>- And you?</b>
<b>- I'm keeping my eyes wide open, that's all.</b>
<b>When I saw you yesterday</b>
<b>in the hay loft</b>
<b>-of course I saw you,</b>
<b>who else could it have been?-</b>
<b>I wanted you inside</b>
<b>the sleeping bag.</b>
<b>Didn't you want to as well?</b>
<b>You really are the little whore</b>
<b>I thought you were.</b>
<b>And you're really the pig</b>
<b>they say you are?</b>
<b>Take that thing off.</b>
<b>Why don't you take it off</b>
<b>with your own hands?</b>
<b>No...</b>
<b>What's wrong?</b>
<b>Irene!</b>
<b>Irene.</b>
<b>where did these come from?</b>
<b>Would you mind</b>
<b>answering me, Irene?</b>
<b>I couldn't find the old ones</b>
<b>so I bought those.</b>
<b>- Strange.</b>
<b>-Why?</b>
<b>I haven't seen the cat for two days,</b>
<b>he hasn't even come to eat.</b>
<b>Don't you think it's strange?</b>
<b>What did you do to him,</b>
<b>did you hurt him?</b>
<b>You're crazy.Why would I?</b>
<b>Why would you?</b>
<b>I know why, because you've always hated him</b>
<b>because my mother liked him,</b>
<b>because he belongs to me,</b>
<b>because he's mine,</b>
<b>which you'll never be</b>
<b>because you're a whore,</b>
<b>a dirty bloody whore!</b>
<b>I beg you Oliviero,</b>
<b>I can't stand it.</b>
<b>Stop scaring me...</b>
<b>I'd just have to dig these in a bit,</b>
<b>just a bit...</b>
<b>You're hurting me...</b>
<b>Excuse me, sir.</b>
<b>-Yes? Oh, good morning Mrs Molinari.</b>
<b>-Good morning.</b>
<b>I want to speak to the police chief.</b>
<b>The police station's right there in front of you.</b>
<b>-Thank you. Goodbye.</b>
<b>-Goodbye.</b>
<b>You wish he was dead,</b>
<b>don't you?</b>
<b>I've noticed your life's hell</b>
<b>so why do you stay?</b>
<b>He'd never let me go.</b>
<b>Maybe you're wrong.</b>
<b>Last night he told me</b>
<b>he wanted to kill you.</b>
<b>No, then he'd destroy</b>
<b>what entertains him,</b>
<b>his victim.</b>
<b>He just wanted to scare you.</b>
<b>All he wants is to get into your bed.</b>
<b>He's already done that.</b>
<b>Jealous? You're jealous?</b>
<b>No, not in the way you think.</b>
<b>He's a failure...</b>
<b>not only as a writer,</b>
<b>and he knows it.</b>
<b>He hides it from himself.</b>
<b>Maybe it caused all the problems.</b>
<b>Maybe you haven't thought</b>
<b>about ending it for good.</b>
<b>It wouldn't take much.</b>
<b>No?</b>
<b>No.There's an embarrassing</b>
<b>number of choices...</b>
<b>Ideas like a picnic with a tragic ending,</b>
<b>a leap into the ravine,</b>
<b>the inconsolable widow.</b>
<b>Romantic, isn't it?</b>
<b>Now I've found you</b>
<b>I can't stand her anymore.</b>
<b>I can't carry on being stuck between</b>
<b>a hysterical woman</b>
<b>and an erotomaniac.</b>
<b>If you continue</b>
<b>I'll leave this house.</b>
<b>Go away now,</b>
<b>Irene could come in any</b>
<b>minute and I don't want</b>
<b>to be involved in one of</b>
<b>your uniQue spectacles.</b>
<b>This time I swear</b>
<b>I'll get rid of her.</b>
<b>I've already thought</b>
<b>about how to do it,</b>
<b>but please don't leave me.</b>
<b>I've re-opened that</b>
<b>hole in the cellar,</b>
<b>there's room for her too.</b>
<b>-This time I'll really do it.</b>
<b>-You're drunk.</b>
<b>I told you to leave.</b>
<b>You're spying on me,</b>
<b>you dirty worm.</b>
<b>I'll break your neck!</b>
<b>Watch out or I'll kill you!</b>
<b>-What do you want?</b>
<b>- CEome down!</b>
<b>I can't.</b>
<b>- I've got a race, I've got to leave tomorrow morning.</b>
<b>- So?</b>
<b>Why don't you come with me?</b>
<b>The race is in Cesenatico</b>
<b>and if I do well I'll be</b>
<b>taken on for track races.</b>
<b>I'll wait for you at 7 on the bridge.</b>
<b>Come on, we'll have fun!</b>
<b>Get lost or you'll wake everyone.</b>
<b>Only if you say you'll come.</b>
<b>Alright, alright I'll come.</b>
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>KILL HER AND HIDE HER INTHE CEELLARWALL</b>
<b>So you made a decision.</b>
<b>I was beginning to wonder if you'd do it.</b>
<b>I...I don't know what...</b>
<b>Look, look! He really wanted to kill me.</b>
<b>He'd already prepared the hole in the cellar</b>
<b>next to the other girl.</b>
<b>You can tell it to the court.</b>
<b>In any case you'll get life, my dear.</b>
<b>You know judges are</b>
<b>almost always married</b>
<b>and it's unlikely they'll</b>
<b>absolve a wife who's...</b>
<b>understand?</b>
<b>They defend their privileges.</b>
<b>My mother told me Aunt Ester</b>
<b>had some very valuable jewels.</b>
<b>Where do you hide them?</b>
<b>You can tell me now that it's all mine.</b>
<b>Floriana, please don't</b>
<b>talk to me like that.</b>
<b>Those jewels are yours,</b>
<b>you can have them,</b>
<b>I don't care about that stuff...</b>
<b>But don't betray me.</b>
<b>Alright, partner.</b>
<b>Lets get rid of him.</b>
<b>Here, they're all here.</b>
<b>I don't even know what they're worth,</b>
<b>and I don't want to know.</b>
<b>Well, they're in bad taste,</b>
<b>but they're worth a lot.</b>
<b>Aunt Ester made all her</b>
<b>lovers give her jewels.</b>
<b>Take them, they're yours.</b>
<b>I should go now.</b>
<b>No, not yet, please.</b>
<b>I'm scared.</b>
<b>I think you'll have to get used to it, sooner or later.</b>
<b>Sooner would be better.</b>
<b>What will you say about</b>
<b>good old Oliviero?</b>
<b>That he left,</b>
<b>he went abroad,</b>
<b>and then... I don't know.</b>
<b>- I'll leave the villa.</b>
<b>- Fine...</b>
<b>It's been a really lovely holiday.</b>
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>Floriana, please stay,</b>
<b>at least for tonight.</b>
<b>I beg you don't go.</b>
<b>Alright,just tonight.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>No, I know more pleasant</b>
<b>ways to help you to sleep.</b>
<b>Floriana.</b>
<b>Floriana!</b>
<b>Floriana?</b>
<b>REVENGE</b>
<b>REVENGE</b>
<b>Who's in there?</b>
<b>Why did you want me to stay?</b>
<b>Did you want to kill me too?</b>
<b>REVENGE</b>
<b>REVENGE</b>
<b>Floriana, what are you going to do?</b>
<b>Floriana!</b>
<b>Floriana.</b>
<b>Now I'm sure she'll be</b>
<b>on the bridge at 7,</b>
<b>she has no choice.</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>and it'll be the end and</b>
<b>the beginning of everything.</b>
<b>You got the end you deserved,</b>
<b>but I'm sorry you suffered so little.</b>
<b>Ijust hope there's something after death</b>
<b>so you'll be able to know</b>
<b>how long my revenge took!</b>
<b>I killed your bitch of a mother,</b>
<b>I had that dirty black girl killed.</b>
<b>You'll rot with her for eternity!</b>
<b>Can you hear me, Oliviero?!</b>
<b>Yes, it was me who had her killed</b>
<b>so new suspicions</b>
<b>would fall on you</b>
<b>after you'd already been accused</b>
<b>of that other crime.</b>
<b>It was easy...</b>
<b>It was easy</b>
<b>-with your alcohol-ruined memory-</b>
<b>to make you lose</b>
<b>confdence in yourself.</b>
<b>I destroyed you.</b>
<b>Day by day,</b>
<b>day after day.</b>
<b>And I'd have continued</b>
<b>to kill you bit by bit,</b>
<b>if I hadn't realised you</b>
<b>wanted to kill me too.</b>
<b>I hope some part of you</b>
<b>is still living somewhere,</b>
<b>and that you'll suffer for eternity!</b>
<b>It all went as slick as oil.</b>
<b>Don't worry, it was even</b>
<b>easier than the black girl.</b>
<b>And the jewels?</b>
<b>- Did you recover all of them?</b>
<b>-All of them.</b>
<b>She'd put them in a plastic bag.</b>
<b>Bitch!</b>
<b>Thought she was really shrewd.</b>
<b>The problem's the two corpses.</b>
<b>Why? It was a normal</b>
<b>road accident.</b>
<b>I mean the two bodies in the cellar,</b>
<b>they could be found.</b>
<b>CEome here,Walter,</b>
<b>I want to show you something.</b>
<b>We've got to bring them here at night,</b>
<b>agreed?</b>
<b>Deep enough?</b>
<b>I've nothing to add,</b>
<b>you always have good ideas.</b>
<b>Good afternoon, madam.</b>
<b>We were just about to leave,</b>
<b>no-one's home.</b>
<b>-Good afternoon.</b>
<b>-Good afternoon.</b>
<b>Here again?</b>
<b>I mean... what else is there?</b>
<b>My husband left this morning</b>
<b>- I don't know when he'll return.</b>
<b>-Just a formality.</b>
<b>A serious crime's been reported.</b>
<b>- A crime?</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>You tormented a cat.</b>
<b>- A cat?</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>Incredible, but we also have</b>
<b>to deal with such things.</b>
<b>Old Mrs Molinari,</b>
<b>the rag and bone woman</b>
<b>who used to be in the service</b>
<b>of the Countess Ester,</b>
<b>your husband's mother... you know?</b>
<b>- I remember her.</b>
<b>- She's offcially reported a crime.</b>
<b>Let me explain.</b>
<b>That bloody animal massacred</b>
<b>all my doves, so...</b>
<b>Yes, I understand.</b>
<b>But I told myself lets go</b>
<b>and speak to the Ruvignys</b>
<b>and then we'll calm down</b>
<b>old Mrs Molinari.</b>
<b>She's basically a good woman.</b>
<b>Ijust need to write a report.</b>
<b>- Do you need to come inside?</b>
<b>-Yes, please.</b>
<b>-Would you like something to drink?</b>
<b>- I shouldn't,</b>
<b>but I don't consider myself</b>
<b>to be in service</b>
<b>when I'm dealing with cats.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Here.</b>
<b>To your health, madam.</b>
<b>And to the cat's.</b>
<b>-That's him, isn't it?</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>Did you hear that?</b>
<b>The cat's realised</b>
<b>we're here about him.</b>
<b>Bloody animal! I, I...</b>
<b>I'm scared of him, believe me inspector.</b>
<b>No, don't bother...</b>
<b>Seems to be coming</b>
<b>from that door.</b>
<b>Yes, the cellar.</b>
<b>But it's always closed.</b>
<b>No, it's open.</b>
<b>If we find him,</b>
<b>-we'll take him away for you.</b>
<b>- No, no,</b>
<b>my husband's very fond of him.</b>
<b>He'd get angry if the cat was</b>
<b>gone when he returned.</b>
<b>He sounds injured from</b>
<b>the way he's miaowing,</b>
<b>we'd better take a look.</b>
<b>He's not here.</b>
<b>Stuff from '48.</b>
<b>Barolo, Merlot,</b>
<b>CEabernet,</b>
<b>a Brunello from '36.</b>
<b>There's no cat, but the miaowing</b>
<b>came from here.</b>
<b>This is worth a fortune.</b>
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>I know nothing about wine.</b>
<b>- Found anything?</b>
<b>- No,</b>
<b>I'd say he's not here.</b>
<b>I'd be delighted if you</b>
<b>accepted at least one.</b>
<b>Oh, no, that's too generous, madam!</b>
<b>- And maybe your husband...</b>
<b>- ...he will be happy.</b>
<b>- Please take it.</b>
<b>-Well, how could I refuse?</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>There's a hole in the wall here!</b>
<b>It looks like it's been</b>
<b>dug from inside,</b>
<b>and the plaster's new.</b>
<b>He's in there,</b>
<b>he's in there!</b>
<b>That bloody animal's in there!!</b>
<b>Madam!</b>
<b>Madam, don't over-react, please.</b>
<b>He wants me dead.</b>
<b>He wants to destroy me!</b>
<b>That demon is...</b>
<b>Satan!!</b>
<b>Satan!!!</b>
<b>ANY RESEMBLANCEETO ACETUAL FACTS</b>
<b>OR PERSONS IS PURELYCEOINCIDENTAL</b>
Oh, no.
Bad news, I guess.
Sign here, please.
What? Here.
Where it says, "received by."
My brother's lost his mind.
The doctor says it's permanent.
I'm putting him away.
The minute he's committed, I'll be rich.
I'm his executor.
I'll handle all his money.
I'll start now.
I'll get commitment papers signed.
That's easy.
But a judgment from a court takes time.
I don't get paid if you don't sign.
Are you from them, or are you just a messenger?
Who are you, anyway?
I'll find out for you, if you like.
Oh, it's of no consequence, old sport. Don't bother.
As you wish.
Doesn't anybody sign this?
I'll be glad to. Oh, thank you.
Don't you have a handkerchief?
Not on my salary.
Oh, thank you.
By the way, you suffer from lumbago.
You're hagridden by your wife, you keep a sheepdog for a pet, and you had chicken soup for breakfast.
I just love it when you do that.
Yes, he's a messenger, all right. Ahh!
Blackmail.
Just what I've been waiting for.
"Never!
Not one penny!"
- Really, Justin.
- Don't be frightened. I'll protect you.
Here. Give them this.
Oh, if that's a message,
I've gotta charge you for it, sir.
Give that dog of yours more, uh, meat.
I think he's got pellagra.
Oh, bless you, sir. Bless you.
Don't touch it. It's my clue.
I, uh, shan't be up for lunch.
We're going to the clinic.
If you need me, I'll be downstairs in the laboratory. Wait!
The clinic?
Oh, not another specialist.
I'm always so afraid they'll make him well.
I like him this way.
Get him, will you, Daisy?
Something's wrong. I know it.
I can always tell when something's wrong.
You're in awful trouble, aren't you?
Just go get him.
Oh, you were such a nice man when I married you.
Do what I tell you to.
I've had enough.
We're going straight to Dr. Strauss.
Land sakes alive.
There isn't any doubt, is there?
My goodness. No, indeedy.
He's incurably psychotic.
That means he's committable?
And then some.
Is there room here for him?
Always room for one more,
Mr. Playfair.
Especially for kin of yours.
You see, there's a spider up there.
There.
He's got huge teeth, and he's coming at me!
Doctor. He's coming at me.
He's coming at me!
Doctor. Mildred.
Oh! Now, is that what your dream was like?
- Mildred. Mildred.
- Dr. Strauss, I am with a patient!
This here is Mr. Playfair, an important member of our board.
How do you do, Mr. Playfair?
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.
It's about my brother.
He's a hopeless paranoid.
Is that your medical opinion, sir?
It's the consensus of your staff.
He has a sizable estate he isn't fit to handle.
It's my duty to commit him, and, uh,
I need your signature.
Without examining the patient?
That was never in my mind.
He's upstairs waiting.
Well, I have another patient waiting.
Have them bring him down.
This gentleman is Mr. Small.
We're having some trouble getting him to verbalize.
Is that correct, Mr. Small?
He can speak, but he just won't.
Now, Mr. Small cannot afford to go to another doctor.
All my life I have worked with people who have no place else to go.
I'm sorry to seem unreasonable.
But if you want me, you'll have to wait for me.
I expect you better finish with him later, Mildred.
Dr. Strauss, you are a money raiser.
Go and raise money!
I am a doctor.
Leave me to my work!
Nurse, take him to the ward.
He stays with me.
Now, ma'am, you are flouting my authority.
It's all right.
Y'all take this poor unfortunate away, you hear?
Not in my office, you don't!
- That's an order!
- No. Oh, Mr. Small!
Mr. Small! Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no. Oh! Oh.
Oh, you fool!
You've ruined weeks of work.
You ape!
Get that thing off of him.
Release that man.
No one belongs in one of those.
If you please. Hah! Esh! Hah!
Hyah!
A classic paranoid. Fantastic.
I don't think
I've ever done it better.
Well, now.
They'll think twice next time.
Are you all right?
Who let this happen?
Who's in charge here?
Mr. Small, I'm so sorry.
Can you forgive me?
Don't let her off so lightly.
Is she decent to you?
You like her?
She didn't do this to you, then, hmm?
Who did?
- You did.
- I guess you're really Sherlock Holmes.
You don't at all. You think I'm mad.
You analysts are all alike.
Thinks you're mad, too,
I suppose, huh?
Why? Because you won't talk?
Huh. Typical.
Why is it analysts can't ever analyze?
Don't tell me you've deduced what's wrong with Mr. Small.
Not yet. I can do if you like.
Will you nod when I'm right?
Now, why should an obviously proper gentleman refuse to talk?
Because he hasn't been introduced.
We don't know who you are, but once we do know, then you'll talk.
Now, where is the logic?
Think. He can talk, but he won't.
The silence is the clue.
No coaching, please.
I work by pure deduction.
Now, who was silent?
Who had everything but sound?
The mutes of history? No, they couldn't talk. He can.
A monk with vows of silence!
No, no. No sound, no sound.
Why, the early movies.
Why, the man's a silent film star.
Which one? The most unlikely one.
It's only logical.
That means he's brave, hmm?
A man of action.
Stern, aloof, yet passionate.
By God. Rudolph Valentino.
Sherlock Holmes.
An honor, sir.
I've read your books. I'm really quite a fan of yours.
I'll be damned.
Tell him how much you liked him in The Sheik.
- This is ridiculous.
- You didn't like me?
Oh, no, no. You were very good.
I wish we had you on the staff here.
You could use me.
Well, I must be off.
My best to Vilma Bánky.
Ah, ah, couldn't we just sit down and talk?
We could discuss your work.
I'm very sorry.
I'm a terribly busy man.
I don't have time to be examined.
Are you working on a case? Better save your strength for Mr. Small.
Chances are he isn't really Valentino.
Well, I like that. No offense.
I have daily office hours. If you feel the need of a consultation, please feel free to call for an appointment.
Yes.
Yes, no clues of any kind.
It all points to Moriarty.
If only all the tests are negative.
Damn.
Justin? Ten-to-one that moron doctor wants to see me.
Someone's here who wants to see you.
Holmes, why are you never wrong?
Really, Doctor, do you have to see him?
Oh, absolutely. One good session with him. I insist.
May we come in?
Right this way.
Amazing. Classic paranoia.
What an opportunity.
It's really sort of cozy.
Did he do all this himself?
Oh, I helped a little.
He's not here.
He's probably hiding.
Does he have a hiding place?
A secret panel. How'd you know?
Oh, they always do.
He'll come out when he's ready.
You say he used to be a lawyer, huh?
And a judge.
He was a brilliant man.
It's just marvelous.
Oh, we shopped at Abercrombie's.
You'll just have to forgive me, but I haven't seen a classic since, oh, the spring of '59.
They're very rare, you know.
How long has he been
Sherlock Holmes?
Since Lucy... Uh, since his wife died.
For about a year.
And how long does each attack go on?
Oh, all day, every day.
He's never Justin anymore.
Do you remember when the symptoms first started?
That's hard to say.
He was a great reformer.
Always out to make things better, Justin was.
He, uh, lived on books.
Detective fiction mostly.
You don't think you can cure him, do you?
Cure a classic?
Once in a generation.
It's a marvelous disease, you know.
The victim's faculties grow keener, and-and ultrasensitive.
And he's capable of things that seem like genius.
Where's the secret panel?
Oh, he won't tell us.
Watch, I'll bring him out.
You see, the classic changes his identity.
And everything is very mysterious, and there's evil lurking everywhere.
And dollars to doughnuts behind it all is Professor Moriarty.
Give her money for a taxi.
Send her home.
You be nice now.
Will you be taking me to mesmerizers next?
If you'll excuse us, hmm?
We'll be upstairs, Doctor.
I don't suppose there's any point in asking you to go.
You don't mind if I get on with my work?
Oh, no. Go right ahead.
The usual procedure is to start off with family questions.
Background data, childhood recollections, traumas and the like.
Well, come, come.
Ask me anything you like.
I'm at your service.
What are you doing?
Just routine.
It wouldn't interest you.
Why don't we start off with my father?
Why? Does it bother you to talk about him?
Not in the least.
What would you like to know?
Ah, well, um, a stern man, wasn't he?
Aloof and cold?
I really couldn't say.
I don't remember him.
Well, uh, your mother must've been a lovely woman.
What's your earliest memory of her?
I haven't any.
None? You don't remember her at all?
No more, I'd say, than you remember yours.
Your father raised you, didn't he?
I'd say he was a doctor too.
Country practice, Midwest.
You're not bad.
It isn't guesswork, either.
It's observation of detail, deduction.
Couldn't that paper wait?
I often do two things at once.
If necessary,
I can manage three or four.
Now, about your wife. What wife?
You know, I have a feeling you're resisting me.
Because I can't recall a wife I never had?
Let's see now:
Kentucky pulp, rag content zero,
12-pound weight, produced for Woolworth's, 39 a box.
That's interesting.
Do you really believe that paper came from Woolworth's?
Where do you think it came from?
I have no opinion.
Yes, you do.
You think I'm wrong.
Well, I take it a great many people think you're wrong.
Don't you have anything to do?
I'm doing it.
Now, what is that?
Is that a clue?
Yes, it is a clue.
Well, tell me about it.
I'm a patient, humble, understanding man.
Why don't you come back next week, and I'll play 20 questions with you all you like.
I love games. I always have.
But not today.
No, not when it's life and death.
Are you in danger?
There's a master plan, and that is the master clue.
It holds the date and time and place where he lies waiting for me.
- Who?
- Professor Moriarty.
He taunts me, Doctor.
He could kill me anytime. He has his agents everywhere.
But no. No. He wants another kind of victory first.
Those two words, "twenty grand," are a challenge, and he wants to see me fail.
I've got to find their meaning and be waiting, ready for him.
If I don't, I die.
I take it you've met face to face before?
I really couldn't say.
The man is a master of disguise.
That's going to make him very difficult to catch.
I wouldn't have him any other way.
He's the greatest enemy a man could have.
He's everywhere!
Here, look.
Uh... "Girl Scout killed crossing street."
Uh... "Grandmother raped and beaten." Huh?
Uh... "Orphanage in flames, five die."
"Excursion boat explodes." Who-Who does these things? Who's responsible?
Well, they might be accidents.
I don't believe in accidents.
Take Mr. Small, for instance.
How did I bring that off?
'Cause there are two laws in life.
All things are logical.
They must make sense.
And no things are ever exactly what they seem.
Each accident is part of a design.
And every object has its secret side.
Was that how you did it?
Is it so insane?
Oh, I didn't use that word.
Yes, but you think it.
That's what brought you here.
No, I came here because your brother...
You do have a brother, don't you?
Blevins. Yes, of course.
You've remembered something from your past.
I know all about my past, and Blevins isn't in it.
He's not in
"The Speckled Band" or...
Check it out. I've been completely written up.
Still, if he needs to think we're brothers, let him use me.
I can answer when he calls me Justin.
After all, it's only a name.
Do many people call you Holmes?
No, scarcely anyone.
That must make you very much alone.
It does that, but it doesn't make me wrong.
I've listened to so many doctors tell me who I am.
I've studied Justin Playfair. I've read all his books, his papers, his decisions.
Everything he did.
He tried to make the world the kind of place it might have been.
It drove him mad.
He lost his mind.
But I am not that man.
I'd like to visit you from time to time.
What for?
I don't need doctoring.
Mr. Holmes...
Don't call me that.
You don't believe I'm Holmes.
- I won't be patronized.
- You don't have to snap at me.
A lunatic is entitled to his temper!
Go away!
I want to help you.
"Twenty grand." A sum of money, but what else?
I'm on your side.
Nobody's on my side.
Ah, the whole world is against you. Typical.
Now, when did this sense of persecution start?
When you walked in.
If you're not careful,
I'm going to walk right out.
Woman, I have got to think! My life depends on what I think.
Your life depends on me.
Well, God help me, then. **
Oh! Put down that ridiculous violin.
Holmes fiddles when he thinks.
That's awful.
But I absolutely cannot play the goddamn thing!
Stop laughing at me.
- I'm not laughing.
- I'll show you.
That paper is real. Moriarty's real.
I am not mad.
You want to test me out?
Let's test me out on you.
Very well.
You'll tell me when I'm wrong.
I'll shake when wrong and nod when right, like Mr. Small.
Are you ready? Go right ahead.
You're left-handed.
Your molars and incisors, lower right, are false.
You tint your hair and have a vitamin deficiency.
You were a tomboy and an only child.
Your adolescence was a nightmare.
And you didn't lose your acne until your middle-20s.
You can neither cook nor sew, and your apartment needs a thorough cleaning.
You suffer from insomnia and sometimes drink yourself to sleep.
You think you're homely and you're glad you're growing old.
You bite your nails. You're frightened you're a failure, but you're lost without your work.
I've got more. Do you want it?
By all means.
You haven't any friends.
You have never been engaged.
No one you've loved has ever loved you back.
You're stubborn and inflexible.
You've got a temper that you can't control.
That suit is 10 years old, and you annoy the living Jesus out of me.
Now it's my turn.
I'm going to stay right here.
Go, stay. What you do doesn't interest me.
- The hell it doesn't.
- I forgot. You swear.
Listen, my name is Watson,
Mildred Watson.
I'm a doctor. I'm not beautiful or rich or ambitious, and about the only thing I care about in life is to cure.
Now, I have offered you what skills I have, and in return you have fought and jeered and tried to hurt me. But never mind.
I don't care.
All I feel is dedication.
Watson? Shut up. I am not finished.
I am a dedicated doctor, sir, and
I will cure you if it kills me!
Watson? No, that's impossible.
I mean, good Lord, I am the underdog, but this...
Are you quite sure you're Dr. Watson?
You are to show up in my office tomorrow morning at 10:00!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You just won't do.
There must be some mistake.
Here's my address.
Fool. Fool! It's an address!
Twenty Grand is an address.
Are you ready, Watson?
What? We haven't any time to lose.
Come on.
Well, aren't you coming with me?
It's going to be my greatest case.
You wouldn't want to miss the chance to write it up.
She'll come. She's coming.
There she is.
My chronicler and good right arm.
Frankly, I'm a little disappointed.
But if anyone can make a detective out of you, I'm the man. Let's go.
Come along, Watson.
Where's your pluck?
Well, I ought to call the clinic.
They'll never miss you.
Follow me.
We're coming for you, Moriarty.
We may not look like much. We may not have your weapons. We may lack your dark allies.
Why, we may even lose.
I'm not invincible.
God knows she's no asset.
But together, sir, we may surprise you.
Do your worst. We're on our way.
Watch out.
Where are we going? Grand
Street, naturally. 20 Grand.
What are we going to do when we get there?
If I'm right, we'll find the meaning of the master clue.
You can't just barge in.
I never barge.
I infiltrate. I filter. Here.
You better practice.
Walk like this.
What if it's somebody's home?
We'll visit.
Or a store? We'll browse.
What if somebody... I'll do the thinking, thank you.
You're not practicing.
I can't afford to be seen creeping along the street in broad daylight.
Well, you must be good for something.
Are you any good with firearms?
Guns?
I don't suppose you know very much about jiujitsu, either. No, you wouldn't.
If I'm such a liability, what do you want me for? You mustn't feel inferior.
Try saying to yourself,
"I'm adequate."
Mr. Playfair, really.
Come on. Try.
I'm adequate. Good girl.
Here. Oh, great Caesar's ghost.
Strange things go on in
Greenwich Village. Take it.
It's not loaded, is it?
Well, I can't shoot down
Moriarty with imaginary shells.
Now, catlike, on your toes.
We've got to find the clue.
What if there isn't one?
There will be.
Moriarty won't disappoint me.
Well, if you don't know what you're looking for...
Half the trick in finding clues is knowing that they're there.
Ah!
Ah, we're getting closer now.
How innocent these houses look.
That's bad.
The worst things always seem like innocence.
Look!
What do you think?
It's the telephone company.
Just the place he'd leave a message for me.
You're not going to cause a scene?
The essence of method lies in quiet and surprise.
Can't we talk this over in my office, please?
They're expecting us. Remember, be prepared for anything.
Now, don't shoot unless it's absolutely necessary.
Information. May I help you?
Please, you've got to talk to me.
You've got to listen.
Sorry, we may not divulge that information.
You've just got to help me find him.
Miss, I told you when you called. We cannot give that information on the phone.
But that's why I came here.
I'm not on the phone now.
So you'll tell me, won't you?
I'm not allowed to talk to you.
We only give out information on the telephone.
But you refused to give it to me on the telephone.
I'm sorry. If you wanna talk to me, you'll have to call me on the telephone.
All right. Where is the telephone?
Right there.
Listen to the misery.
That means we're getting close.
Let's see if there's a message.
Madam, the crash is out of town.
You need long distance information.
Have you anything for me?
The input's on the fritz. I think the rheostats are shorting.
You see? I knew they were expecting us.
The game begins.
Oh, no. You can't do that.
My clue is inside.
Information. May I help you?
You've got to help me, please.
I don't know where he lives, but we're in love.
He called me half an hour ago.
He just found out he failed his bar exam.
He's taken sleeping pills.
He said good-bye. He's dying, and he isn't in the phone book.
He's probably unlisted.
We've saved him.
What's his number?
Sorry, we may not divulge unlisted numbers.
His address. Forget the number.
Give me his address.
I'm sorry. No addresses on the telephone.
But I'm not on the telephone.
I'm here!
We only give out information on the telephone.
I can't go on.
This is unendurable.
You there. Give me the unlisted list.
Send a guard to the information room.
You, then. At once.
- Why, you care.
- I do.
I'm finished here.
It doesn't matter. Here.
Take it.
Here, child.
My name is Grace.
I wish I had something beautiful to give you.
But I don't.
Okay, girls, what's the trouble?
It's the repairman.
What repairman?
Mr. Playfair, do something.
Draw your pistol, Watson.
Keep him covered. I will not.
They got guns. Call the cops.
Right.
What's their number?
Fool. He's got my clue. Uh...
Excuse me, that magazine you're holding.
Stop right there. I don't suppose you'd let me see it.
It's a Double-Crostic.
I haven't finished it yet.
You know the crosswords in the London Times?
Yeah, I-I heard about 'em.
They're the best.
Last Sunday. Here.
Have a look. Oh.
Oh. Oh!
Hello, police. Help, murder.
Aw. Run for it!
How do I know what precinct?
I can't call information.
I am information.
Watson, your first impression of detective work.
You like it? No.
Good girl. I know how girls are.
"No" means "yes."
I haven't been a girl in 20 years, and when I say no, I mean no!
You have any notion of what you've done?
I found two clues: A Double-crostic and a girl named Grace.
You could've jeopardized my whole career.
Wasn't much of a career from what I could see of it. Now, hold the phone.
Grace. What could Grace mean?
Do you realize that
I have been published?
And that I have three degrees.
And that I've... I've had a
Rockefeller and a Guggenheim.
A-And I've studied in Vienna.
Tuesday. It's tomorrow.
"Tuesday's child is full of grace."
We're meeting him tomorrow!
No, no, Mr. Playfair.
Listen. I'm no good to you here. Really.
I-I can't work under these conditions.
Look at this place.
Okay, okay. What's going on?
Good morning, Officer.
Why, Mr. Rathbone.
It's an honor, sir.
They want you up the street at number 20.
Ah, yes. I've just been there.
You're the ones. Quick thinking.
I wonder, if you see them later, would you give this back?
Oh, I'd...
She's unorthodox,
I'll grant you.
If she didn't bring him here, where are they?
Moseying along.
I expect they'll get here soon.
I've got to get those papers signed.
She'll sign 'em. Yes, indeedy.
I didn't write that.
Someone did.
My brother.
Oh, that's just great!
He knows.
This nut knows all about me.
He'll be in a cell.
What can he do?
You get his money if he dies, right?
Where's he at? He's disappeared.
All right, here's how it is.
You find him first, it's the loony bin for life.
I find him first and...
Let's go!
Get that guy in the hotel window.
He's got me pinned down.
Ah. Where are we?
Eh, last reel. The ambush scene.
Is that a screen back there?
We're five flights up.
I know. I counted 'em.
It's that vitamin deficiency. You ought to eat more leafy things.
- Here, hold on. I know the way.
- Shh!
Oh, my God, Justin. Is he dead? He's quite all right. He lives here.
What? All the time?
Except for Saturdays.
You see, we have no showers in the men's room, so he bathes in Pennsylvania Station.
Here, uh, have a sweet.
Oh, man. Not again.
Do it again.
God, what are they doing?
Shut your trap and watch the movie!
It's all right, Maud.
She's with me.
Why, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, you missed a lovely one yesterday.
Oh, it's good to have you back, sir.
Thank you, Maud. Have some popcorn while it's hot.
No, thank you.
What's wrong? Nothing.
Well, we missed lunch. You really ought to have something.
I'm an adult.
I can feed myself, all right?
Oh, sorry. No offense.
Just watch the movie, all right?
Watson?
Why so moody?
You're not watching. You can't see a thing without your glasses.
Watson? Yes.
Regardless of your feelings on the matter, I... have enjoyed collaborating with you, and I'm very pleased that you're here.
I wouldn't be here except for the police.
Yes, I am sorry about that.
What am I going to do with you?
You might try smiling. Nothing much, just once a day or so.
I will have some candy.
Help yourself.
Oh, it's Jujyfruits.
I broke three sets of braces on those.
She'll be there!
She'll save you!
God bless you, Barbara Stanwyck.
You want to know something?
You were right about my adolescence.
It was awful.
And my apartment is a mess, and I can't cook.
You like the movies, hmm?
Only westerns.
All the other doctors found it most amusing.
I don't find it amusing, just curious.
It isn't even that.
If you look closely down there,
Watson, you can see principles.
You see the possibility of justice and proportion.
You can see men move their own lives.
There are no masses in Virginia City.
Only individuals whose will for good for bad... can bring them to the ends they ought to have.
I like that very much.
Why did I have to meet you now?
What's wrong with now? We're together, and we're after Moriarty.
There isn't any Moriarty.
There is!
You dreamt him up!
If I am Holmes, there has got to be a Moriarty.
Well, what if you're not Holmes?
Let me see now. One word left blank.
"Electric News," 11 letters.
Justin, I want to help you.
Would you please just let me try?
Think, man!
Oh, man.
Man, I gotta groove or blow my mind.
Let's go someplace and groove.
Oh, let's groove here.
Groovy. Groovy.
What's groove?
My god!
Madam, you are creating a disturbance. Shh!
- But they're grooving!
- Madam, I warned you. Usher!
Usher!
- Hey, this woman's the fuzz. I'm gonna bust her one.
- No, I'm not. No.
This woman woke me up.
You makin' trouble, huh?
No, I'm not.
- Shh!
- Out! Out!
No! Justin! Okay, mom.
I've got it! Watson, quick.
Where is my shoe?
Why, it's Mr. Holmes.
We're coming, Moriarty!
Ew, all this gum.
It's like a swamp.
Stop dawdling!
I think they're growing mushrooms.
Damn it, Watson.
Justin, give me my shoe!
My shoe!
Against the wall. Get back.
I will not! This is idiotic.
Quiet!
I've got a run in my stocking.
Creep forward.
My feet hurt. Shut up.
I want my shoe!
You want to get us killed?
No, just one of us. I've got a blister on my foot.
Holmes, you are fantastic.
"Electric news," 11 letters.
Times Square.
Yes. Just the sort of place he'd...
Now, if I were Moriarty, where would I...
Let's try him. Why him?
You never know.
I'd like a bag of chestnuts, please.
I'm out of chestnuts. Odd. I took you for a chestnut man.
I am a chestnut man. A chestnut man who's out of chestnuts?
That's the picture.
There's no chestnuts.
We're in luck. When is the professor going to strike?
Tomorrow sometime.
Check the papers.
Midnight.
We meet tomorrow midnight.
It's not Moriarty who's striking.
It's Columbia.
He had to get the message to me somehow.
Now, the clue that leads us to the place.
He'd put it somewhere obvious but... unexpected.
My clue, my clue.
Oh, my God!
Taxi! Taxi!
Taxi!
Help!
- I'm off duty. Can't you read?
- Your sign says on.
Tough. I'm going back to the garage.
Listen, I'm a doctor, this is an emergency, and you can stuff it!
Oh, he hurt you.
Nonsense. Never better.
Like a rock.
No, you look awful. Here.
Wait a minute. Here.
You look a little shot yourself.
No, it's all right.
I'll be all right in a minute.
Here. Have a nip.
I don't know what came over me.
Drink up.
I have never been like that before in my life. Honestly.
I don't know what you must think of me.
I think I'll make a detective out of you yet.
Hey, no boozin' in my hack!
Speak when you're spoken to.
You came through very nicely back there.
I'd like to thank you for defending me.
I didn't defend you. I attacked them.
There's a difference.
It's all the same.
I wish you'd stop thanking me for everything I do.
You are the touchy one, aren't you? You don't want anyone to owe you anything.
Perhaps you ought to be the analyst.
Here. What do you make of it?
God, you're just like
Don Quixote.
You think everything is always something else.
Well, he had a point. Of course, he carried it a bit too far.
That's all. He thought that every windmill was a giant.
That's insane.
But thinking that they might be...
Well, all the best minds used to think the world was flat.
But what if it isn't?
It might be round.
And bread mold might be medicine.
If we never looked at things and thought of what they might be, why we'd all still be out... in the tall grass with the apes.
Look, are we cruising, taking in the sights, or what?
Sixth Avenue and 10th. And if you want a nickel tip, keep talking.
Hey, wait a minute! My shoe!
Oh, to hell with it.
Where are we?
What is this place?
Wilbur. Wilbur.
Your latest text on sanitation, if you please.
I'll get it, Mr. Holmes.
We're closing in. This time, with any luck, he's mine.
You're meeting Moriarty?
It's happening at last.
Oh, this creature has attached herself to me.
You talk to her.
Yes. I'm Dr. Watson.
How do you do?
Oh, how nice.
No, I am Dr. Watson.
Would you like to see my driver's license?
He's waited for you such a long time.
I'm so glad he's found you.
Listen, I'm his doctor.
I'm a licensed analyst.
Of course you are, my dear.
There. "Dr. Watson."
Dr. Watson. Dr. Mildred Watson.
"Dr. Watson." It's me.
And now I've got you all upset.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Who does he think you are,
Lestrade of Scotland Yard?
He calls me Wilbur. It's my name.
Wilbur Peabody.
You don't know what I've been through.
And look at him!
Oblivious. He's like that when he concentrates.
Have you known him very long?
For over 30 years, since he was very small.
Oh, he was such a serious young man.
The dustier the book, the more he studied it.
Now he studies guns, fisticuffs, acrobatics.
Have you been hired to cure him, Doctor?
Just the opposite, I think.
I'm not quite sure I understand.
I'm not quite sure I do, either.
I've got my work! I'm busy!
And I'm satisfied.
And I've got a perfectly fascinating schizoid case at 8:00.
If I hurry, I'll make it.
Nothing. Damn!
Garbage.
Yes, it's garbage. That's all it is.
Garbage!
And I've had enough.
What's wrong with you?
I've lost my shoe. I've got a gun in my pocketbook.
One minute you're all smiles, and the next...
I'm going back to where I belong.
The clinic?
Yes, the clinic.
And they're gonna put you in there, and there's nothing I can do about it.
I cannot help you, because
I cannot make you well!
You don't think I'm insane.
Not you.
I'm Holmes.
I am Sherlock Holmes!
I've got a patient waiting.
I'm a doctor. I heal the sick!
Watson! Watson!
Silly woman. Go ahead!
I've always been alone.
- Wilbur?
- Yes, Mr. Holmes?
What does garbage in a shopping bag suggest to you?
But I'm much too old.
I never think of you as old.
Neither do I.
But every morning when I see that old face peering at me from the glass,
I count my years, I tote 'em up, and sure enough, I come out old.
You don't want me.
Well, I don't...
I don't want anyone.
I have my errand.
I have Moriarty.
Come on, Professor.
Strike me now!
You see?
I frighten him.
He knows what I can do.
Wilbur?
Yes?
She went away in stockinged feet.
- Watson!
- Lord have mercy, Doctor.
Seemed like you done disappeared.
I got the police out lookin' for you.
Listen, it's late, and I'm tired, okay?
Well, I'm mighty weary waitin' for that paranoid of yours.
Quick like a bunny now, you bring him in and sign these papers.
He's not here.
You're joshin' me.
I left him in the reading room.
And as for signing papers, you can stick 'em in your ear!
Lookee here now, Mildred. If you wanna lose your job, you're gonna...
Heinrich, you've got yourself a deal!
What's the matter?
Nothing much.
What are you doing here?
I had an urge to read.
Fascinating book.
What's wrong, Holmes?
Are you ill?
That is the question.
You're my final friend.
Do you know that?
You're the last.
Where's Dr. Watson?
- Tell me something offhand.
- She won't leave you.
I've spent quite a lot of time researching.
This is the perfect place for me.
Who's Who?
No, not for me, for him.
I have to be very clear on that point.
What you need is some breakfast.
Would you like a jelly doughnut?
Listen.
Here he is, Playfair, Justin.
Born New York City, 1923.
Harvard College, Harvard Law.
Thesis published, '48.
Married, 1950.
Lucy Clark.
Pretty name, Lucy.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Just a name.
Doesn't mean anything.
There are his accomplishments.
Why, he's a happy man.
And proud.
For Christ's sake, which is my life?
I've got some chicken broth.
You haven't answered me.
I'll heat it up.
I can't remember childhood.
I have no past.
That's not so bad.
There's got to be more in here than Moriarty.
I dreamed it all.
That must be it.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
What's wrong with being Sherlock
Holmes, I'd like to know?
Sometimes I wish to God...
You do?
A fop by day, but after dark,
I ride.
Abuse the meek, will you?
Have that!
Who am I? Ha!
Is he in heaven? Is he in hell?
That damned elusive Pimpernel.
What's that?
You want to see the face behind the mask?
This is the face.
- I think that's beautiful.
- Thank you.
And now I think I'll call up
Dr. Watson.
Please don't do that.
I-I couldn't face her.
I've been stuck in the goddamn subway for an hour!
Justin, thank heaven.
I'm busy. Go away.
I couldn't sleep. I've been so worried.
Look at that.
They've been searching for you every place.
Blevins wants your money, and he's gonna lock you up to get it.
Now, here's my plan.
Do you think I'm Holmes, or don't you?
I'm sorry, but it's the only point I've got!
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll challenge you.
First we'll search for garbage, and then we'll put the heat on Blevins.
Is that fair enough?
You're patronizing me again.
I'm Watson!
I'm here, ready for the chase.
Now, come on.
A shopping bag full of garbage.
Think. The city dump.
No, that's much too obvious.
Now, this one said,
"Back to school."
That must be the way to solve it... schools.
How many different kinds of schools are there?
Library school?
I like you, Doctor.
There's public, private, parochial...
- Prep.
- Rabbinical.
- Charm.
- And schools of fish. Why have you come?
To save your neck.
- You care for me?
- I care for all my patients.
Ha. Florence Nightingale.
You're damn right.
Drama school. And music school.
- Grammar.
- High.
- Dance.
- Military.
- Cooking.
- Charm.
You said that. I did not!
Well, we can't be out of schools.
Let's name some more.
That's it. It's a name.
The bag's a name.
Someone named Bag has got to have a school.
Come on, now.
What kind of a name is Bag?
What difference does it make? Wilbur, quick, a telephone directory.
Right away. I like you, Watson.
You have qualities.
I suppose I do.
May I be frank? I'm very glad you're here.
I like you very much.
Regular classified.
Ah, good man.
This won't take a minute.
I could use that jelly doughnut.
Wilbur, if anybody should ask you, you haven't seen us.
Ah, I've got it!
I was right again!
Quick, Watson.
We're gaining on you, Moriarty!
After you.
She came back.
You ready?
Well, what if we get separated?
Yes, we need a rendezvous.
Well, why don't we meet at my apartment?
Good idea.
I'll even cook you supper.
Now, try looking academic.
We're two students come to register.
It must be some kind of academy.
Where is it?
Up these stairs. Stay close.
Don't lose me.
This door hasn't been used in 20 years.
Make that 30.
Strange.
Maybe our clue is out here.
A pigeon with a message, possibly.
Don't!
We are going to matriculate.
This may be a trap.
Uh, nice sort of school.
Just our kind of place.
Keep your pistol ready.
Ah, good afternoon.
Is this the bursar's office?
Who are you?
Holmes and, uh, Watson.
Oh.
But I thought you were dead.
I came back in the sequel.
Oh.
My, is that quincunx your design?
Yes, it is.
Oh, it's magnificent.
Sir, you're a genius.
Yes, I am.
You're just in time for tea.
We'll meet you by the basket, my dear.
We haven't put a foot outside since 1939.
We didn't like the look of things out there.
So, we bought every kind of vegetable seed.
- Shut down the school.
- Well, we didn't have any pupils, anyway.
And ever since, we've been very happy.
Except for one thing.
Nobody's ever seen our work.
We don't know if it's any good.
But you did recognize a quincunx when you saw one.
Would...
Would you criticize our garden?
- We'd be honored.
- Oh.
And this we call our bird of paradise.
Mr. Playfair.
- Who are you?
- We're friends... of Blevins.
- No, you're not.
- We've come to take you for a ride.
You've got a pistol in your pocket.
Keep it there.
Run for the hall and keep going!
Aaah!
Cover me.
- Brutes.
- Savages! Savages!
Murderer!
Whatever you are, don't burn!
Melt, damn you.
It's foggy and damp here in New York.
The temperature at Central Park is 45 degrees.
Humidity, 84%.
Winds out of the east at a brisk 10 miles per hour... gusting up to 15.
Oh, God.
Tonight's forecast calls for rapidly dropping temperatures, heavy fog and a chance for some more light showers.
Oh, thank God.
Some women do this every day.
Oh, I'm not dressed.
They never think to watch the fire escape.
What's the matter?
Nothing is the matter, and don't look at me, please.
You don't look any worse than usual.
Would you just go away?
They're lovely.
I wish they were.
It's been some time since anyone bought me flowers.
Uh, new dress?
Olive oil, hmm. Very chic.
Oh, yes, uh... Uh, dinner's cold.
Sorry I'm so late. Oh, no, it hasn't warmed up yet.
I'd have been here sooner, but the clue was most complex.
I have worked out where we're meeting him, though it wasn't easy.
Where is the bar?
Oh, it's in the oven. Oh...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to use the oven for storage
'cause it's such a small apartment.
Very sensible.
Uh, we're just going to have a simple supper.
Plain home cooking.
- Yes, I see.
- That's right. Go ahead and make fun of it.
That insecurity of yours.
I know.
I like your house.
It's nice. It's just like you.
You know, somehow that just misses being flattery.
I haven't got a vase.
I think the beans are burning.
Oh, no. That... That's soup.
Well, are the drinks ready?
After you.
Oh, here.
Oh, thank you.
Well, here we are.
We're having wine with dinner.
Ah, very civilized.
Ice on crystal.
Good sound, isn't it?
Well, it's not crystal. Oh.
Your-Your good health.
You know, I... I really should have taken you out to dinner.
Oh, no. It's good for me to cook.
Well, when this case is over, we'll have plenty of time for going out to the theater... and fashionable places and all that sort of thing.
I was thinking earlier, a little recreation.
Why don't we set a date right now?
Would you be free tomorrow night?
Actually those fashionable places can be very tedious, and I might embarrass you.
I-I don't think I would, uh, fit in.
There's no denying that.
Of course I have an awful lot of costumes.
I could change.
It's a foolish notion, even so.
No-No offense.
Tomorrow?
Do you mean tomorrow night?
Do you dance? Uh, well, I haven't in years. Uh, do you?
I don't know. I can't remember.
Let's find out. No, let's not.
I'd really rather not. Come on.
I-I'd only stumble.
Nobody's watching.
Come on. Don't be scared. Uh...
You're doing fine.
Well, I'm a natural athlete.
Oh, I beg your pardon. Oh.
Well, maybe we both need a little more practice.
Just think of all the dancing we can do once this is over.
Do you play checkers?
I'm a whiz.
Ah. There's so many things you need two people for.
I'll teach you billiards too.
We'll, uh, sip our port and read aloud.
I'm here. I'm right beside you.
Oh, please. Can you hear me?
Oh, dear God.
You can't do this to me.
Holmes!
Oh, my Holmes, you can't die!
You're some doctor.
Get off my chest.
I'm having trouble breathing.
Oh, I'm sor... You're alive!
You called me Holmes.
- I did?
- You don't look so good.
I'll get my bag.
I tell you, Watson,
I expected better of him.
It's beneath the Moriarty
I've always known.
You ought to be in bed.
Don't worry, Watson.
Tip-top shape.
No, no, no, no.
Let me look at you.
No time for that.
We've got to mobilize.
We're staying right here.
It isn't safe here.
But at our rendezvous at midnight, I'll be ready.
Someone's going to die tonight.
It might be me.
Oh, Watson, no one's as black as he or half as quick.
He is perfection.
You can tell a lot about a man by his enemies.
I'm proud he wants me dead.
Hold still.
We've got so much to do.
Hershey Kisses.
Out the back.
Wilbur. Wilbur!
Holmes, you startled me.
I've solved it all.
Here is where he will be.
What's that you got?
It was a white plume once.
We're meeting Moriarty at midnight.
Will you wear it?
What's up?
I'm helping one poor nut escape... if it's the last damn thing I do.
I want you.
Is there romance, excitement, danger?
All in glorious Technicolor.
Your house is right around the corner.
They'll be watching.
Back.
Daisy! Oh, it's you.
Guess what. I'm leaving Blevins.
I'm glad to hear it. I married him for love, but I don't love him anymore.
Hot dog!
You miserable...
Maud!
Why, Mr. Holmes.
What's the matter?
There are no more westerns.
Dear friends, will those of you who know what this is all about please raise your hands.
I think... if God is dead, he laughed himself to death.
Because, you see, we live in Eden.
Genesis has got it all wrong.
We've never left the garden.
Look about you.
It's hard to find,
I grant you, but it is here.
Under our feet.
Beneath the surface. All around us is everything we want.
The earth is shining under the soot.
We're all fools.
But together, you and I, tonight, we'll bring him... down.
Nobody came.
I don't much blame them.
Turn it backwards, and you'll see the sense.
Suppose we took the shopping bag.
What kind of garden would we take it to?
Wow.
We're here.
What happens now?
We'll wait.
Well, I'm not afraid if you're not.
It's starting.
He's out there, somewhere.
Crouching, steady, cold.
He never sweats, you know.
Is pride a sin, Holmes?
Because I'm proud of you.
Control yourself.
Cross your fingers.
That makes nine.
I love you.
This week only, loin of pork,
79 cents per pound.
Delicious, tender sirloin steaks, 89 cents a pound.
Lean boiled ham,
99 cents a pound.
Fresh frying chickens,
29 cents a pound.
Fresh ground beef,
49 cents a pound.
Delicious, tender... sirloin steaks... at 89 cents per pound.
God.
Moriarty? I'm here.
I mean, in budapest,
I think I saw mostly.
The inside of the concert hall and the marriott.
But, you know,
I shouldn't complain.
I'm patient. I can wait.
I've misread the clue.
But if twenty grand was a number, then the clue might be...
The number on the door at Dr.
Bagg's. What was it?
Sixty-seven. Right, but 67 what?
What else was twenty grand?
A horse. A racehorse!
Watson, you're a genius.
Well, add it up.
A horse, a school and 67.
It's a riding school at 67th street!
God, there is one.
Just off Central Park.
It's all done now. You are a detective.
Here we go.
You put her in a big bowl, at least a gallon.
Get a good bubbler, maybe a plecostomus.
And don't feed her too much.
I'm ready.
Do you really mean to walk with me?
I do.
He believes jimmy transposed the address numbers.
Transposed the numbers?
How would he even do that?
We may have to walk near dangers, close to awful things.
I know that.
If there's one thing
I cannot abide,
It's a man who won't own up to his mistakes.
Now, whatever mud mcgill is slinging he's not gonna.
Screw me out of the best outside counsel I've ever had.
They blot the sun out for miles around.
I may not always win.
Does justice ever lose?
It does, from time to time.
We'll meet him here.
Get down.
Somewhere...
I'm not afraid, because you're with me.
I can't remember how
I lived before you came.
Oh, Holmes, I love you.
Listen.
What?
It's him. It's Moriarty.
There's nothing.
Now. He's coming.
On horseback, riding like a king.
I can't hear.
Not on my knees.
There's nothing.
There's nothing!
On your feet by me.
A sound, please.
Just a little sound.
Stand up.
Holmes, he's not there.
There isn't any Moriarty, it's just...
You hear it?
They're nearer.
Nearer.
Ah, now, there. Do you see him now?
Not yet.
Yes.
And he wanted to help.
That's sanctimonious.
He's everything you said he was.
He makes you proud.
He does.
Stand closer to me.
Hold my hand.
And now we're together. Yes.
Jimmy.
You do realize you just confessed to a felony?
I guess.
Let it be said he found us very close together... in the light.
Black Christmas
Hey, who leave the goddamn front door open?
BARB:
Oh, by the way how come I was the only one there working tonight?
PHYL:
We're in it this afternoon, Barb.
A likely story.
How does it look?
Useless, very useless!
You got your Santa costume ready?
PATRICK: Yeah.
What time the little bastard arrive?
- At one o'clock.
- Terrific!
JESS:
Hello?
Pardon?
Who?
Barb, it's for you.
Long distance.
Oh, great.
I'll take it in the other room.
Could you guys shut up in there?
I can't hear a damn thing!
Hello!
Mom, hang on, I can't hear you.
Operator, I can't hear.
What's coming from the other end.  Can you...
Yeah.  All right, let's see!
Party over!
Come on, all the men out!
Come on!  Bye bye!
Oh, operator, I still can't hear.
All right, Mommy!
I can hear you now.
No, we just having a little party.
No, I had a couple.
Oh, come on,
I'm not drunk.
No, no!  Uh, I had some stuff
I had to do in the afternoon.
And then I was just gonna get the 720 train to the city.
Oh, come on, you got to be kidding.
Why can't I come too?
- Well, who the hell is he?
- Good night.
- See you next week.
- Okay.
Hey, call before you come.
I have to get my parents pick me up.
I'll just get a couple of my friends and we'll go.
Okay.
Yeah, sure I'm inviting her.
I'll see you around.
Hey, Chris, wait up, I need a ride.
Put the Christmas music back on.
You wants to go skiing for two days?
Yeah, sure, Barb.
My mother save me a place at Mt. Holly.
You know who else wants to come?
- Yea, sounds like fun.
- Great.
- What about you Clare?
- No thanks, Barb.  I made some another plans.
Okay, I'll come get it.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Hey, quiet!
It's him again! The monas.
It expands into zag.
Must be one person?
No, Clare. That's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir doing their annual obscene phone call.
Shh ...
Big cunt!  Yeah, big cunt.
You big cunt....
Let me lick it!  Lick it!
Lick it!
Let me lick your pretty piggy cunt!
Pretty big cunt!
Pretty big cunt!
I can bring you a big brake.
How many can you fuck, lady?
- Uh-uh, not bad!
- Welcome my choosy cock!
I'll come over.
I'll come over... so you can...
Fuck it, fuck it.
Listen you pervert! Why don't you go over to Lambda-Ko?
They could use a little of this.
Piggy cunt, you want my fat cock...
So, why don't you just go find a wall socket and stick your tongue in it, that will give you a charge.
I'll stick my tongue up your pretty pussy.
You fucking creep!
I'm going to kill you.
Well, super-tongue strikes again.
Fastest tongue in the west.
That's sick!
I really don't think you should provoke somebody like that, Barb.
No question!  This guy is minor league.
In the city I get two of those a day.
Maybe.
See, like a town girl who was raped a couple of weeks ago.
Darling!
You can't rape a townie.
You really are too much,
Barb.
Come on, this is a sorority house, not a convent.
I'll see you later.
I'm gonna go pack.
Come on, Clare, she didn't mean anything.
No, really Jess, it's okay.
I have to finish packing anyway.
Haven't she had enough trouble sitting in here without you getting at her all the time?
Come on.
I know professional virgin when I see one.
Hey, I can't get my hands out here.
Speaking of professional virgins ...
Here we have, the queen of bozes.
Where have you been?
I have been shopping. You know how the store is most spectacular at this time of year.
Another charge up to buy these, honey.
Mrs. Mac, come on to the other room, we got a surprise for you.
Where have you been?
See Mrs. Mac has been looking all over for you.
Oh, little puss!  Hello.
Oh, will you get someone to see you?
Okay.
Claud?
Is that you, puss?
Kitty.
Who is that?
Who is it?
Claud?
Who is that?
Who is it?
Dear, girls ...
This's really beautiful.
It's really lovely.
I about to make use for this to the Justin!
Come on, Mrs. Mac, put it on.
Put it on?  Oh, come on,
 I'm not going to bed.
Come on, please.
Put it on.
Anything for you girls because it's Christmas?
Hey, you bet!
Okay, girls, party is over.
Let's get this junk clean up, heh?
Oh yeah, come on, everybody takes a little something and it won't take long.
Come on!  Fast girls!
Just a little cooporation.
- Now just get relax, because I'm tired.
- You really are!
Good night.
Before....
Booze.
There you are.
Good night, good night.
Merry Christmas!
Jess, you girls are just too good to me.
Oh, noisome, Mrs. Mac.
Hello?
- Hello, is Jess there, please?
- Yes, wait a second, Peter.
Jess, it's for you.
It's him.
Hello?
Hi, how's the party?
It was good.
Too bad you couldn't make it.
- I had been practicing for four days
 straight.  I am really wiped out.
 - Yes, I know.
Jess, dear ...
You won't forget to put off the lights.
You've got to plan some time.
I've got to talk to you.
You sounds funny.
What's the matter?
Nothing is matter.
I just want to talk to you.
Why don't you tell me now?
Because I want to talk to you, face to face.
Jess, I haven't been to bed in three nights.
And it's not the mood to be playing games.
Look, Peter, we'll talk about it tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, I'll be in room 30, all day.
- Alright, I'll see you around 2:00.
I just mean, uh, shortly.
I get some exhausted, okay?
Yeah, it's okay.
- I love you.
- I know.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah, well, goodnight.
Jesus, so it always found my liver!
Clare?
Clare?
♪ Veno takes the dolphin
♪ Gabee's on her hygene
♪ Dongde said to Resiskin
♪ To wrap this baby in....
MAN 1:
Oh, thank you.  It's okay.
MAN 2:
Sorry, I should have been keeping a better watching at them.
- I think so.
- Yeah, well, I said I was sorry.
Excuse me!
I hate to bother you,
I can see that you are busy.
But I wonder if you can help me?
You see, I'm suppose to meet my daughter here at 1 o'clock.
It's half past now, and she's still not here.
Here name is Clare Harrison, do you know her?
Clare Harrison?
Yeah, I think so.
I know she lives in a sorority house.
It's called, uh...
Pi-Kappa-Sigma.
Oh, of course.
Kappa is a sister sorority.
Some other girls were over here today, but I haven't seen Clare.
The place isn't far, I will tell you how to get there.
Ho, ho, ho, shit!
Santa, please.
Look, she's supposed to be going out with me for this weekend, God dammit.
Well, we decided that we'll go skiing for a few days, you know?
Yeah, I've been looking forward to this for three weeks. Bitch.
Isn't Santa naughty?
Ho, ho, ho, fuck.
I just don't know, Mr. Harrison.
Her clothes are all packed and ready to go.
I'll take you to the common room.
They're having a party today for underprivileged children.
Yes, I know.
I am very disappointed in this atmosphere.
I intend to do something about it.
Who is this?
Uh, that's a friend of Clare.
Very nice young man from the town,
 Chris Hayden.
I didn't sent my daughter here to be drinking and... picking up boys.
Oh, Clare is a good girl, Mr. Harrison.
I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea about that.  She is a good girl.
I am sure you will find her in the fraternity house.
As a matter of fact, I could show you the way.
I have to go to a store near there.
If you wouldn't mind giving me a lift.
I know where it is.
And I will be glad to give you a ride.
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Harrison.
I'll just get my bag.
"I didn't sent my daughter here to be drinking and picking up boys."
Tough shit!
I was supposed to be responsible... for the moral of every girl in this goddamn house.
This bronze.
The leaning tower of Pisa if they can get up there.
I'll do my best.
I don't know what the bastard expect of me.
For Christ sake!
Claud?
Is that you, Claud?
Claud?
Here kitty, kitty, kitty!
Come on Claud. Come say goodbye to mommy.
Is that you, Claud?
Oh, Jesus!
Claud, look what you made me do!
Stop it!
Come on Claud, here kitty, kitty, kitty!
Come on Claud, I got to go!
Here, kitty!
Oh, God dammit,  Claud, you're a little prick!
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Harrison.
I think I will get out of here.
I am pregnant.
What?
I'm pregnant.
Hey, Jessica, that's fantastic.
I don't want it.
You don't want it?
No!
I want to have an abortion.
You can't made a decision like that.
You haven't even ask me.
I wasn't even going to tell you.
Jess.
I want us to have a baby.
Peter, I can't!
Oh, Christ, Jess.
Don't you ever consider anyone but yourself?
I've thought this out very carefully and
I know what I'm gonna do.
Do you know how important this afternoon is to me?
Yes, I do.
Why don't you just get out of here.
Jess!
I want to talk to you tonight.
There is nothing to discuss, Peter.
- I think there is.
- I'm not going to change my mind.
We'll see.
Will you be there at 9 o'clock?
- Yes.
- Okay, I will see you tonight.
Yes, dear.
I am sure there is nothing wrong.
Yes, I just been talking to a friend of hers.
She's going to call her out for me.
Yes, well, if we don't have any luck,
I'll go to the police.
Yes.
Well, I don't think I'll be able to go home tonight.
It's a bit late to head out now.
BARB:
Let the grown brother snag it a little bit.
Yes.
Good-bye, dear.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Oh hell, not again!
Billy.
Billy?  Mm!
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
What your mother and I must solve is...
Where did you put the baby Agnes?
You got the wrong number.
Where did you put Agnes, Billy?
Look, I'm telling you, you have the wrong number!
Why can't mother and I might go in?
Billy!
You guys can never get it if you don't even try.
Look, I really don't.  You get thing that go so seriously.  Sincerely, I need--
I know what we may hear a non specific.
Hold it, hold it!
Jesus!
Could you just give it to me one at a time?
BARB:
Well, what the hell are you planning to do about it?
You... shut up!
You know, for a public servant
I think your attitude really sucks.
Shut up.
Now, Mr. Harrison, if you convinced that your daughter is missing, you can fill up one of these forms.
I don't know if there's any consolation, but
90% of the time girls who reported...
...missing from the college, they're out of campus somewhere with their boyfriends.
Thanks, but that's not much of a consolation.
- Oh, here for my gladdy help.
- Thank you, dear.
You know we got to get
Mr. Renzic fix this door.
I must have to call that son of a bitch a hundred times about this.
Mrs. Mac, there was another one of those calls just now.
Oh, what, my dear?
It's weird!  Some woman screaming, then a man wailing.
Clare Harrison's father was here today.
Oh, really?  I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye to her.
Well, you still might.  Clare didn't meet him where she was supposed to.
Ah, I thought she was over to the fraternity.
Where is it?
I bought in some fishes.
Oh, shit!
You're, mister!
- Excuse me.
- Um-hm.
Could you give me the number of the sorority house?  Please!
Yeah, sure.
It's, uh...
Fellecio - 2 0 8 8 0.
What?
Fellecio.
It, It's, uh--  It's a new change.
FE (Fuck Everybody?).
Sounds none on me!
How do you spell it?
Capital 'F', 'e', little 'l', 'l'
'a', 't', 'i' 'o'.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
JESS:
Chris!
Break!
Hi, what's up?
- Have you seen Clare today?
- No, she went home.
No she didn't.
No one knows where she is.
CHRIS:
Are you serious?
I thought maybe she was with you or at least you might have heard from her.
No, not since last night.
Well, her father came to pick her up
 at 1 o'clock today and she didn't show.
So he went down to the police station with Phil and Barb.
What happened?
- They didn't take it seriously.
- Why?
I don't know.
I think they finicky shut up somewhere.
WOMAN:  Well, uh.
She is out for Christmas holiday, but... there was a bad practice over at the highschool this afternoon, then.
She... just played the piano.
And, uh, when she didn't come home, mine, I thought Melody being after her.
Best friends.
And, uh, they haven't seen her all day.
She is only 13 years old, Lieutenant, and--
My husband is a trucker and he is out on the road, and so I came over here.
Was it really so unusual for her to be just a few hours late, Mrs. Quaife?
Oh, yeah.  She should have been home at noon.
We are going to buy a present for her father.
Nash, you stupid son of a bitch, you got a big goddamn mouth!
What the hell are you talking about?
Hi Chris, how is your brother?
Can I get a talk to you?
What's up?
I want to know why nothing is being done about
Clare Harrison being missing.
And why this... idiot gets away with saying the things he does?
You are a friend of Clare Harrison?
Yeah, I have been taking her out.
Oh, this is Jessy.  She lives in the same sorority house with Clare.
Alright, come on in.  Sergeant, bring me the file on the Harrison's girl!
And take care of this.
At least you should try to eat something, Mr. Harrison.
You know, starving yourself isn't going to help the situation.  I don't know.
No, thank you very much Mrs. Mac, but I just have no appetite.
I feel I should be doing something, but I don't know what.
Why don't you just try to stop worrying?
The best thing you can do is stay right here.
Michell shall call Clair show up soon!
In fact, I don't know what to do.
Did you know...
It's very little known fact, but... did you know that there is a certain species of turtle... that--
There is a certain species of turtle... that can screw for three days without stopping.
You don't believe me, do you?
Well, I mean how can I make something like that?
Barb, dear, I, I, I--
No, really!  They just three days,
24 hours a day,....
Can you believe that?
Three days?
Come on, if I get three minutes--
Do you know how I know this?
Because I went down to the zoo and I watch them.
It was very boring.
Well, actually, uh, I, uh, didn't stay for the whole three days.
I went over and I watch the zebras, because they only takes a few seconds.
Premature in sex,....
You think it's my fault, don't you?
Barb, stop it!
Don't shit me. That's all what you all thinking.
Why not just come on out and say it?
You think that I drove her away, and if she is dead you're gonna blame me.
Barb, for God sake!
If that's all what we all thinking, why isn't someone just come right out and say it?
Barb, you have too much drinking.
Mr. Harrison--
I don't give a shit out of Mr. Harrison!
I'm sick and tired of everyone in this house enunciating stuffs and not coming out with what they mean.
Barb, why don't you go upstairs and lie down for a while?
Shut up!
And you leave me alone. Goddamn you.
You think it's my fault that you have been employed all this afternoon.
Barb, you are drunk.
Go to bed!
Yea, sure, fine.
- Any news?
- Sure!  Where Mr. Harrison?
He's in the dining room.
- We won't be long, Mrs. Mac.
- Alright, dear.  See you later.
- Phyl, Phyl...
- Yes?
- Listen, I'm sure Clare will be alright.
- I hope so.
And I'm just going to tell you that I'm going to go to my sister's for the holiday...
...so I might not be here when you get back.
Well, that's okay. Just check out on Barb before you leave, could you do that?
Of course, I will.
And you bring a luck.
Yeah, we'll be all right, Mrs. Mac.
Mrs. Quaife and Mr. Harrison have asked me to extend their thanks to you... for coming out this cold night to help.
Now, Mrs. Quaife has told us that Janice most likely came through this park, on her way home from school today.
So the first thing we'll do is combing the park.
When I tell you, I want you all to assemble at the south edge of the park, with your assigned officer.
Then we'll just walk through the park.
Spread out evenly.
Don't punch up.
There will be two sets of dogs leading the way.
Just spread out and follow them.
George Karling, stay out from the flanks.
Teams will led up the dogs and stuff at more than ten miles an hour...
...while you're being get used to it.
Now if any of you find anything,
I want you to send someone out
 immediately to report it to me.
Is that clear?
Are there any questions?
Okay, lets go.
Darling, always, last two cups.
Alright, I hear you!
Claud?
Claud?
Claud?
Claud?
Claud?
Claud?
Where are you?
How did you get up on the attic, Claud?
Shit!
All right, God dammit.
You can wait.
Claud, are you up here?
Jesus Christ, I don't see how could you be up here.
Come on!
Jesus, Claud ...
Now look at what you make me do.
Jesus...
I've got to clean this place up some day.
Claud?
I can't see a damn thing.
Claud, god dammit, Claud,
I'm going to have you fixed.
Hey!
Anybody there?
Anybody there?
I'm gonna have to split. Peter is coming around and I'm late already.
- It's cold.
- We'll coming home soon too.
I am freezing.
- We'll let you know if there is anything happen.
- Bye.
- Yes, is that my baby?
- Don't leave your place, stop!
Janice!
No!
Janice!
Janice, Janice!
Coming, Janice!
Janice!
Janice?
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
Oh, help!
Please, help me!
Oh, come, please!
Help, please!
What do you want?
Why are you doing this?
Trust me, babe.
I got goddamn Mrs. Mac.
Will I bury in bag?
Who are you?
For God's sake, what are you doing?
I know what you did, Billy!
Stupid Billy!
Billy! Billy! Mad!
Stop this!
Jesus Christ, Mrs. Mac?
Mrs. Mac, are you home?
Mrs. Mac, are you up there?
Yes, hello?
I had been getting obscene phone calls, and
I want to know what can be done about it?
Yes alright, I'll hold.
But only for a moment.
Peter, Jesus, you scared the hell out of me!
Why don't you say something?
Yea? Well.
You scare the hell out of me too.
What's all the yelling about?
I've been upstairs having a little sleep.
Hope you don't mind, but
I'm got a little cold up there waiting for you.
- Sorry, I was late, Peter.
- Yeah.
Clare Harrison is missing. I was out with the search party looking for her.
Yes, hello.
I want to report something.
No, I don't want to hold!
- How does the recital going?
- How do you think it was?
Peter, what kind of a game are you playing?
I thought you wanted to talk.
So why don't you quit attacking me and we try to have a rational adult conversation?
Yes, now I stay on the line.
Okay!  Now calm down, lady.
Let's tell the story.
Oh, yeah?
What's the address?
6, Belmont Street ...
How many calls?
Well, did you call the phone company?
Oh, yeah?
Well, miss, we're very busy here.
There has been a child murdered in the park.
I don't know when we can get them out of it.
Probably just one of your boyfriend playing a little joke.
Yeah.  Well, I'll report it and try to get them out as soon as possible.
I'm sorry, miss.
Jess, what's wrong?
A little girl was found murdered in the park.
What?
The search party that was looking for Clare found the little girl murdered.
And Clare is still missing.
Clare is alright.
Is she?
Now listen Jess,
I know you're are upset.
But I've got something to tell you.
I'm leaving the conservatory.
- Peter!
- Now, you just hear me out.
Will you hear me out, please?
I live in one room for 8 years and I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of having to line up behind six people everytime I want to take a bath. I'd had it.
I am quiting the conservatory and we are getting married.
Well, say something?
Do you remember when we first met?
You told me about you're wanting to be a concert pianist.
That was your greatest dream.
And I told you about some of the things that I wanted to do.
I still want to do things.
You can't ask me to drop everything
I've been working for...
...and give up all my ambitions, because your plans have changed.
Be realistic!
I can't marry.
Sure you can.
What is the change?
We could be married and you can still do anything that you wanted to do.
Peter, I don't want to marry you.
Alright!  What about the baby?
- I didn't want to bother it with you, sir.
- Oh, you didn't.
No. 6 Belmont Street, that's where you daughter is?
Yes, it is.
A high school girl has been murdered.
Mr. Harrison's daughter is missing.
And now that the house where she lives keep getting out obscene phone calls.
Don't you think we have to look into it?
Well, lieutenant, I guess.
Sure.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Yeah, thanks, gentlemen.
Sergeant Nash.
Could I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah, sure, Lieutenant.
What's this?
That's the number of the sorority house.
- "Fellecio"?
- Yeah, the newest change, "Fe".
You don't understand?
Yeah. "Fellecio." One of the girls that was in here afternoon gave it to me.
- She gave it to you?
- Yes.
Nash, I don't think you could pick your notes without written instructions.
I know. Something dirty in it.
You're a selfish bitch.
You're talking about killing a baby, though you're having your womanhood.
Now can you see why
I didn't want to tell you.
- What the hell are you trying to do to me?
- What are you doing to yourself?
Jess,
Let's get one thing straight.
You are not going to abort that baby.
Peter, you're not going to tell me what I can and cannot do.
- Jess, if you try getting an abortion--
- I think you better leave.
- If you are trying to get an abortion--
- I said get out.
You get to be very sorry.
Hi, Peter.
I'll get Jess.
- Jess, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Any more news?
No, but there are some people here
 to see about the phone calls.
- Jess, this is Lieutenant Fuller.
- I'm sorry.
And Graham, Bill Graham.
- Uh, you leave present phone station within?
- Yes.
I would like to put a tap on your phone, but I need your written permission to do that.  Is that okay with you?
Okay.
Okay, Grahdy, go ahead!
I'd like to see Clare Harrison room.
Where is the telephone?
There's one in the living room and one here in the hallway.
Clare's room is up here.
- How many girls live in this house?
- Ten.
Hello, this is lineman Graham, at 6 Belmont Street,
I'm working line 5596114.
Great!
This afternoon, I got a call from a woman and I thought it was a wrong number.
But then she started screaming at me.
Who was the last one here to see Miss Harrison?
- I think I was.
- When?  Approximate!
Last night, about 10:30.
- Is this the way she left her room as far as you know?
- Yes.
- What's this?
- We're having a party last night.
- She drink a lot?
- No, hardly at all!
Does she have any emotional problems, anything like that?
No, not Clare!
Who is she seeing besides
Chris Hayden?
- With no one.
- You sure of that?
So, you're the last one who see her sometimes this morning?
- Last night.
- Right, last night.
Has anyone seen her this morning?
- No?
- I didn't.
All the others girls are gone for the holidays.
Can I get a list of their phone numbers where I can reach them?
Sure!
There is one in Mrs. Mac's room.
- Who is Mrs. Mac?
- She's our house mother.
- Is there anyone in the house right now?
- Yes, another girl, Barbara Coard.
She is upstairs asleep.
She is not feeling too well.
- Is she the one that was at the station today?
- Yeah.
Yeah, well!  Let her sleep.
Were there any deliveries yesterday, or was anyone working in the house, anything like that?
No, I don't think so.
Mrs. Mac would know.
- Is all the sisters number on this list?
- Yes.
Grah, how is it going?
About finish?
Yeah, what I've done is I've tapped this phone so that when it rings, it will rings at the station now, too.
At the same time, I'll be at the phone company checking out on the location of the source of the call.
Are there any other phones in the house?
- Yes, the house mother has another one.
- Yeah, but it's on another number, and nobody is calling.
You're gonna have to keep this guy on the line as long as possible.
We got a mechanical system here and it takes a while.
I know it's not very pleasant.
Uh, girls, can I show you something?
- See the car outside?
- Yeah.
We got one of our men in it, so you got nothing to worry about.
Yeah, sure!
I'll get to say,
I just know Clare is dead.
I can just feel it.
Come on now, Phil, we don't know that.
Poor Mr. Harrison,
I feel so sorry for him.
Hey, hey!
- How's Chris?
- Oh, he's okay, you know Chris.
I'm sorry, Jess.
I guess I'm just exhausted.
I've been taking these pills for my cold and they knock me out.
Will you be okay if I go up to bed?
Yes, of course.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, go up and get some rest.
- Call me if there is any news.
- I will.
Thanks.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Yeah, everything clear on you in jack.
Okay.  Sure!  Uh, yeah.
Now look, I'm gonna need about 10 more minutes.
Now be sure you tell those people again, they got to keep this guy on the line.
Right.
So there ain't more attack in the last two days.
If we settle, we'll look into that.
Thank you very much.
Graham's dealing with switching station.
When a phone rings at the house there, this phone ring too.
Kind of admitted to that ready move, so we won't take anything off auditorium this time.
Great, thanks.
- Lieutenant, someone from Scarborough.
- Okay.
Anything at 4:05?
Barb, what's the matter?
Easy, relax, you'll be okay.
It's okay.
I guess...
I guess... I had a nightmare.
I dreamed a stranger, come into my room.
I guess this is why it gave me asthma, huh?
Don't take it too serious, it's just a kind of dream.
You should feel a lot better.
Jess, you go in my room.

Trace call coming in on Phone 9.
Hello?
Hello?
Who's there?
- No, Billy, no!
- Shit!
- Today.
- No, Billy!
- Today!
-  No, Billy!
- Today!
- No way!
What your mother and I must know, huh?
You know that?
Just my caring, no ward, Velum.
Oh, my God!
Hello?
Jess, we didn't get him.
There wasn't enough time.
You'll have to keep him on the line longer.
Oh, I see!
When you said: "Oh, my God," did you recognize something?
No, I just feel like it's getting to me.
When he called before, did he used more than one voice like this?
Yes, yes, he did.
He used several different voices.
Jess, I'm gonna ask you, who was the guy that was just leaving when I arrived in your house?
- My boyfriend, Peter.
- You have everything fine?
MAN:
What a goddamn asshole!
Jess, I'll have to call you back in a little while.
Are you alright?
I'll call you back in a little while and we'll go get him next time.
- Bernie!
- Yup?
- Call a doctor.
MAN:
I don't let no son of a bitch...
...trespass on my land in the middle of the night!
- I don't care what kind of uniform he wear!
- What the hell...
- ...is going on here?
- He fired on a police officer.
You goddamn right!  I'll do it again too!
The bastard was trespassing!
How do we get an ass for the verge, Sarg.
Yeah, I' gonna make the son of the bitch pick everyone of the mother in chief.
The next time, you're gonna get the gut of your ass
Tommy boy!
If knew that, we can not burst in the boycott, I swear!
If you think it was Peter, then why don't you just tell the police?
Well, because I'm not really sure.
Well, he should be stopped.
Whoever it is, it should be stopped.
God!  I just didn't even have a minute sleep around here.  There has been so much noise in the house.
What the hell was all that yelling about?
Barb has a asthma.
She's having a nightmare.
- Is she alright?
- Yes, she's fine. She's sleeping now.
He repeated almost word for word what
Peter said to me tonight.
- Could it be just be a coincidence?
- Oh God, Phil, I don't know.
I was so confused.
Oh, look Jess, I really don't think it could be Peter.
You know I don't like Peter much, but I don't think he's that sick.
I don't believe Peter would do this.
He's so gentle most of the time.
Oh, God!
 Phyl, you know I'm really getting scared.
Look, are you sure that cop is still out there?
Yep, he's there.
Hello?
Jess?
Yes?
I cry a little bit.
Look, Peter,
Don't cry.
We just straighten things out, there's nothing to get so upset about.
- Yeah?
- It's Bill Graham.
You want me to trace that one?
- Yeah, try and get it.
- Right.
Jess, we can't do this.
Please, Jess?
Jess, Jess!
My baby.
Peter, where are you?
Please, Jess!
You got all I feel about the baby.
Don't do this.
Jess, don't hurt the baby.
- Stop this, Peter.
- You have a baby...
God, I know it, do I tell you
 just to save the baby.
Jess, please?
Hey, please tell me where you are.
Shit!
I'm sorry.  Yeah, the call just not long enough.
Right.
Yes?
Jess, Lieutenant Fuller.
You want to tell me what's that all about?
- You listen to that?
- Yes.
What did he mean about killing the baby?
Jess, it's important that you tell me.
I'm pregnant.
I told him I didn't want to have the baby.
When did you tell him this?
Today.
Just today?
You're sure?
Yes.
"We can't kill the baby", that's a strange way of putting it.
Peter is an artist.
Day night drunk!
Neurotic, maybe?
No!
No more than a lot of people.
Jess, are you telling me the truth?
I've got a feeling you are holding something back from me.
Now, I don't want it to be Peter.
But if it is, he needs help.
Do you know what I mean?
The sooner the better.
Now look, think back!
Was Peter with you any of the time since you got one of these calls?
Yes.
Yes, he was here.  He was at the house tonight when the first call came.
That's right, it couldn't be Peter.
Phyl, it couldn't be Peter.
He was here.
He's obviously upset about something.
I'd like to talk to him.
Can you tell me where can I reach him?
Uh, well, he lives at the Baker's House.
But when he gets like this, he usually goes on to the recital hall at the Music Conservatory.
Look Jess, if you get any more calls, you're gonna have to keep him on the line longer
You're not giving us enough time to get a trace.
I'm trying, you know it really upsets me.
- All right, of course. Look, you're doing fine.
I'll talk to you later.   - Okay.
- Thank God.
- I know it couldn't have been Peter.
Well, what can I tell you?
We covered the entire campus area, and working our way towards the lake now.
Where do we go from there?
Start them out from the south end of town, have them walk through way to town, then from house to house.
Jess, you want one aspirin or two?
- Two, please.
- Okay!
Jess! Jess!
What are you doing?
Some kind of search party.
I'm sorry to scare you, miss, but we are with the search party.
What do you want?
Well, we wondered if you see anything peculiar tonight.
Not until you got here.
Phyl!
Well, they scared the shit out of me.
Sorry, miss, but you do know that there was a girl killed in the park tonight?
Yes, we heard.
We are just helping the police to look for the killer.
Well, we don't do anything to help you.
Our dog died last night, too.
Awfully!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We don't want to bother you at the time like that.
We were just wondered if you notice anything suspicious here tonight?
Oh no, sorry.
Well, you just keep your doors and windows locked.
- And you will be safe.  Do you understand?
- Okay, thanks you.  We will.
And remember there might be others from the search party around.
So don't be afraid. We'll be around seeing that you are safe.
- Well, Thank you.
- And remember to lock those doors and windows.
I go to pick the killer!
Seriously, are you sure all doors and windows in the whole house are closed?
Nash!
Get the dean of administration on the phone.
Tell him I want all the records on the Peter Smythe, a music student.
And have a car meet me out front.
Barb? Are you awake?
Phyl!
Are you there?
Phyl!
- Hello?
- Hi.
You pig!
You bad pig!
You pig!
You bitch pig!
No, Billy.  Don't.
- Please?
- You get to hear it!
Ouch!
Help!  Help!  Help!
Billy!
Billy, get out of here!
Where's the baby?
My baby!
Billy, leave me alone with this!
- Billy!
- Where's the baby?
Yeah, you got to tell me!
Where's the baby?
Where?  Where?
Lieutenant!
The guy is on the phone again!
Come on, deadly sick!
I know you're in there, on that baby things.
You have to be a pig!
No, please!
Mommy.
- Come here!
- No!
What is it?
- I said!
- Uh-uh!
Give Mommy, it's the baby.
Baby is our way, Mommy.
You have to find out.
This is Graham.
It's 2140, terminal 55.
Come a hum, this is sucker...
You have the skin to wrap the baby in.
It isn't.
Lieutenant Fuller?
Yes, Nash. What is it?
A phone coming is on the other line, sir.
They say they got a trace on this one.
Yeah, let's have it.
He said the calls are coming from
No. 6, Belmont Street.
For Christ sake, Nash, you got it wrong.
That's where the calls are going into.
That's where they're coming from too, sir.
Oh, shit!
Jenny.
Jenny?
Jenny?
Hey, Jenny?
Jenny, where the hell are you?
Nash!
Nash!
Yes, sir.
Look, I can't get through to Jenny.
I want you to call that girl.
Nash, be calm.
Don't tell her that the guy is in the house.
Just tell her to put down the phone and walk straight out the front door.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Nash, if you blow this,
I'll kill you.
Phyl!
Phyl, where are you?
Please answer me.
Hello?
Who is this?
It's Jess.
On Miss Bradford, this is Sargeant Nash.
Are you the only one in the house?
No, Phyl and Barb are upstairs asleep.
Why?
Alright, now I want you to do exactly what I tell you without asking any question, okay?
No, no, no, no!
No questions.
Now just put the phone back on the hook, walk through the front door, and leave the house.
What's wrong?
Please, Miss Bradford, please just do as I tell you.
Okay. I'll get Phyl and Barb.
No, no, no!
Don't do that, Jess!
Jess, the caller is in the house.
The calls are coming from the house.
Jess!
Jess, get out!
And don't go upstairs!
Don't go upstairs, Jess!
Miss Bradford!
Miss Bradford!
Miss Bradford?
Miss Bradford?
Barb!
Phyl!
Barb!
Please, answer me!
Phyl, Barb!
Please answer me!
Please answer me!
Please!
Oh!  Oh!
Barb?
Phil?
Agnes, it's me, Billy!
Agnes, please don't tell what we did, Agnes!
Jess!
Jess are you alright?
Jess?
Jess, were you in there?
Jess?
Jess?
Jess?
Jess, is that you?
Jess, are you in there?
Jess?
Jess, is that you?
Jess, it's so unjust to me!
I thought you've already left?
Jess, you had me worried.
What are you doing down here?
Jess.
I knew it. I knew it in my gut that it was that kid.
Why would Peter start killing people?
I don't know.
He must commit a call after... after each murder!
It's hard to believe Jess would kill anybody but not Peter!
And she's under.
How long do you think it would be before I can talk to her?
Just a couple of questions.
Well, she'll be up for at least 4 hours, pretty grabbiest ahead.
- What time will her parents get here?
- A couple of hours.
I drive them down from Eglinton.
I don't say with its all ends.
But the condition that she's in,
I wouldn't count on talking to her
 before tomorrow afternoon if I were you.
Did anybody help to find
Patrick Cornell?
- Who?
- Phyl's boyfriend.
It's okay, I will do it.
Uh, Lieutenant!
I think we got to take these bodies to the morgue in Lincoln Ville.
The hospital doesn't have facilities to handle this many at one time.
All right, tell the coroner, they can start the autopsy right away.
I'll notify the parents for identification.
Yes, sir.  Uh, I think that'll wrap everything up here, sir.
State labs guys will be here in about an hour.
Reporters, sir, and television news guys are taking up pictures.
Get them hell out of here.
- Tell them I am down to the station, could you?
- Okay.
All right, you guys.
Come one, back off!  Back off!
Yes, the girl's father is upstairs, but he can't tell you.
Would you keep it down please, we got a sick girl in here.
Come on, get out!
Out of here.
Come on, come on!  Move it!
He is in shock.  Help me get him down stair.
He got to go to hospital.
You will be alright,
Mr Harrison.
He's going to be diagnostic.
Get out everybody in the house!
Okay get a tight hand here.
Eventually, give us everything to wrap up!
- All right, Lieutenant, voulez-vous.
- Hey, Lieutenant.
Hey you!  Out!  Out!
- Go on Lieutenant, as I can.
- Move!
Jesus!  What's the matter with this guy?
He's suffering from shock.  We have to get him down to the hospital.  Can you get us a car, Nash?
Yeah, yeah, let's go!
All right, McArthy, you have a little time to schedule, all right?
Agnes!
It's me, Billy!
Johnny...
...you really sweeten me this morning.
You sweeten me so good.
And I love you for it.
You know that?
Honey, I gotta get movin'.
You!
John Wintergreen, you ain't no superman.
You ain't.
You ain't got it in you!
You ain't got it in you.
John!
Bullshit.
You do got it in you.
"Contemporary Sexual Behavior and Morality
"and its Impact on Urban and Rural Crime.
"Documentations and Statistics and Case Histories by Dr. R.E.L. Masters."
Oh, my.
I'll bet it ain't no better than Valley of tle Dolls.
- Big John?
- Yeah.
Did you ever see Valley of tle Dolls?
My dove, I got my valley of the dolls right here.
Hello, easy street.
Johnny, don't you ever get tired?
I do, but the important part don't.
I gotta go right now. Bye!
Sergeant, sir?
Excuse me, I was just wondering if there was any word on my application for transfer, Sergeant?
Negative, Wintergreen.
See, it's my third application this month, and I know there is an opening in Homicide.
Would you let me know if there's any word on it, would you?
- Fall in, Wintergreen.
- Yes, sir.
Attention!
Dress right! Dress!
Parade rest!
Good morning, pigs.
Good morning, you fascists.
You honkies!
You killers!
You bigots!
You fags!
You pinkos.
You creeps!
You bastards!
Fuzz.
This indoctrination of vocal harassment was compiled by our own juvenile division in preparation for the concert this weekend.
Now, men, I'm going to talk to you this morning about self-control and law enforcement.
- Good morning, sir.
- Hi there, fella.
Where'd you come from?
Out of a crater?
I guess I did.
Could I see your driver's license, please?
Speed limit's 60 miles an hour, right?
This little horse kinda gets away from me once in a while.
You 're gonna have to take a tighter rein
'cause I did clock you doing almost 90 a ways back there.
- Could I see the license?
- Sure.
There we are.
All right.
Morning, ma'am.
A police officer.
- A detective.
- Yes. Los Angeles.
Well, that's a coincidence, you see, because I... I hope to change this uniform for a suit myself just any day now.
Well, luck to you then, fella.
Thank you very much.
Could you take the license out for me, please?
You gotta be kiddin'.
- You 're gonna give me a ticket?
- I'm afraid so, sir.
Thank you.
Take a good look at this, fella.
It says Los Angeles
Police Department Detective, right?
Well, I'm John Wintergreen,
Stockman Motors, and I have to write you up, if you 'll just be patient for one minute.
- Just one minute.
- You 're a joke, fella.
I don't know what cracker barrel you crawled out of, but I wish you 'd crawl back in it.
I'm going back over to L.A., and I'm gonna instruct my traffic man to tag every Arizona plate that comes into that state, right?
They're gonna give them your badge number and your name.
Then all them son of a bitches are gonna come back here and climb your ass.
You got that, officer?
- Can you sign that, please?
- Yeah.
Have a nice day.
You boys are gonna have to turn this rig around and get it all the way back up on Buckeye Road.
Buckeye Road? That'd be another three, four more hours anyway.
Well, you know, there's no five-axle vehicles on this highway.
I think you know that.
You got a weigh slip?
Thank you.
Excuse me just a minute.
There goes another job.
Hey, son?
See there? John Wintergreen.
That's my name.
And I always write down
John Wintergreen first whenever I run into a fellow that I think has got a story to tell me.
And I think you 're one of them fellas.
Why don't you go ahead and tell me your story?
Well, it's... it's nothing, really.
It's just that since I got back, it seems like the only natural talent
I got is for screwing up.
It's been two months since I got back from Nam and I've blown two jobs.
What the hell?
It's no excuse.
It's just a question of adjustment, you know?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Listen, I wanna give you a little advice.
Don't look for favors, 'cause that's the wrong foot to get started on.
You 're talkin' to a fella who knows.
You sound like you made the trip yourself.
Marines. Fourth Recon.
I got back in '68.
It's good to find you, brother.
- I can't tell you how good.
- You don't know how good it is.
You see, you 've been back only six weeks, and I'm gonna do for you what it took somebody six months to do for me.
- Yes, sir. What's that?
- Nothin'.
- Are you gonna give me a ticket?
- I'm gonna give you a ticket.
And you 're gonna make me go back to Buckeye Road?
Gonna make you go back to Buckeye Road.
And you don't even have to thank me for it.

"The juice of the Joelian swamp pads.
"I'm sure it's the final ingredient I seek.
"It must be.
Chemical reaction at last.
"It's the final ingredient I need for this last experiment.

- Hey, Space Ranger.
- "Wow, that's a tough one."
Wanna go check Black Canyon?
Nope. I'm gonna sit right here in the shade.
Maybe I'll go check it myself.
There ain't no action over there.
I just came from over there.
Excuse me.
How about Camelback?
Ain't no action over there, either.
Ain't no action nowhere today.
Is that a fact?
Zipper, that's the story of your life.
Ain't no action, no place, at no time.
I'll see ya later.
Somebody gotta be doing something bad somewhere.
- Think I'll go check traffic.
- You do that.
I ain't leavin' the shade.
Except maybe for one thing.
There you go, honey.
Thank you.
What'll you have, sweetheart?
Put me down.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you know that me and Alan Ladd were exactly the same height?
Right down to the quarter inch?
Did you know that?
It's just something you know, you know?
Like sometimes you read a lot and you just remember a little bit?
Then there's sometimes you read a little bit and you remember a whole lot.
I remember one time
I heard somebody say,
"Do you know what was Alan Ladd and William Bendix's first movie?"
And just like that,
I said Tle Blue Dallia.
And I never even saw the movie.
But I bet five dollars and I won it.
Did you know that he was so short that they used to have to dig a ditch for the girls to stand in to kiss him?
You didn't know that, huh?
Let me have a couple boxes of popcorn, two of those Whoppers, four bags of those sunflower fritees, and give me one of those giant Joy Colas.
What are you gonna get?
A fudge bar.
How about you?
I lost my interest.
My friend will take care of you.
I'd like to have a grilled cheese sandwich and a Cherry Coke.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Can I see your driver's license, please?
Why don't you step out here?
- Take it out for me, okay?
- Sure.
Thank you.
You guys are early, man.
I only counted on getting stopped once every 50 miles between here and Arcadia.
You guys are 20 miles early.
Incredible. A first.
Looks like we got ourselves a wiseass here, John.
- Hey. David?
- Yeah.
- I'm John. Are you a wiseass?
- Not at all, man.
That a boy.
Can't you just give me my ticket for doing 40 in a 45 and let me split?
- Just what is it you got to hide?
- Man, I'm not hiding nothing, man.
Just tired of getting cracked for the way I look. It's a drag.
- It gets to be a drag.
- Yeah?
Why don't you change the way you look?
As a matter of fact, all you gotta do is just stand there.
I'll change it for you.
What do you say
I get those slicers out, Big John?
Just what is it you 're carrying in here anyway?
Posters, beads, general hippie regalia.
You know, the whole routine.
Yeah, let's get it all out there so we can see it.
Man. Come on, man.
Like, what a drag.
I don't want to have to unload my bus, man.
- You told me you weren't a wiseass.
- I'm not.
He asked to see everything.
Why don't you just take it out and put it down here on the highway?
You 're gonna be a lot better off.
Will you take my advice?
- Fine.
- That a boy.
Fine. Great.
What do we have here, Big John?
A picture of us?
- You look a little heavy there, Zipper.
- That looks like you.
I'm what you might call the distributor.
I distribute to all the head shops between Santa Fe and Albuquerque.
All this stuff.
Son, you 're what I might call a dealer.
Hey, Dave.
Come here a minute.
Now, just... just between you and me, are you holding anything you shouldn't be?
No way, man.
I'm totally clean, man.
I'm telling you, it's my gig.
I sell this stuff to people.
- Okay. Pack it up.
- Outta sight, outta sight.
Wanna remove them hubcaps for inspection?
Go ahead. It'll take you five minutes, you 'll be outta here.
- Go on.
- Fine.
- Hey, Big John?
- Yeah, Zipper.
Why don't you check out that shopping bag there?
See what he's got in there.
You already checked that bag, Zipper.
I know it.
Check it again.
Could be there's something I missed.
I'm gonna get a make on that VW.
Then we're gonna pack all this shit up and get out of here.
I said check out that shopping bag.
That kid is a smartass, and I'm gonna bust him.
- I'll bet you are, Zipper.
- That's right.
Now, you get on the right side of it.
And don't you look at me like that, either.
Hey, David.
Come over here.
- What is this you got here?
- Forget it, man.
You planted that shit on me, and you know it, man.
You hassled my ass for an hour and a half here, man.
I'm gonna lose bread on all my shit, man.
And you hassled me, and now you 're planting this shit on me.
You 're gonna take me in and crack me, right?
The law. The long arm of the law, man. Right.
Helping people out, right?
That's really great.
That's really top drawer.
Outta sight.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you...
Turn it on!
I guess you 're just getting tired of old Zip, huh?
Nah, I ain't getting tired of old Zip.
Don't you lie to me.
- Call it.
- Tails.
Got it.
- Shoot stick.
- You 're in trouble already, son.
Big John, what you wanna go over to Homicide for?
Zip, I just can't spend the rest of my life on a motorcycle.
Out there in that desert getting heat stroke, listening to you pass air outta both ends at the same time.
That just ain't my idea of being a cop, partner.
Hey, we got a good life on these motors.
You put in your time, you go home, and you get your money.
What could be more simple?
Can't argue.
It just ain't my dream.
Dreaming's part of the game, Zip.
- Ain't you got a dream?
- Sure.
I dream...
...for a Stroker.
About 1400cc's worth, tucked into a '74 straight legged chrome frame kicked.
Sixteen-inch Ricon mag rear wheels.
With a chrome sprocket, chrome chain, chrome spokes, a chrome tranny, a chrome puddy...
...and an eight-inch extended sportster fork with a chrome dog bone.
T.T. Pipes, brass rocker boxes, couple of quartz-eyed dyed running lights.
And a full Farron you can really get behind.
Excuse me.
Contoured seat with a two-foot poor boy cissy bar.
Hit it on.
And no squawk box, but a telephone.
And an AM/FM and an insulated cocktail bar in the left pocket.
To me, Big John, that's a real motor scooter.
What you wanna go over to Homicide for?
- Got the money for it, Zip?
- Not a dime.
I'm just dreamin'.
Well, see, my dream don't cost a nickel.
All I want is that brown suit and that Stetson hat...
...and four wheels under me instead of two.
And that badge that says "Boy, you 're getting paid to think, not get calluses on your ass."
You 're just hungry to be one of them glamour boys, ain't you?
Yes.
Hey, Zipper, what the hell is that out there?
Let's get him, Zip!
Okay. Let's round him up!
Stay with him, cowboy.
Where the hell did he go?
I don't know. The last time
I saw him, he was right there.
Well, he ain't there now.
That's brilliant, John.
You stay here, I'll flush him out.
Okay!
Hey! Come here, John!
It's okay, Willie.
Hey, Zip, it's old Willie.
- Jesus, why?!
- It's all right.
Oh, Jesus! Why?!
- Jesus, why?
- Hold it, Willie.
- Why?
- It's okay, Willie.
- Jesus, why?
- It's me. John Wintergreen.
It's okay, Willie.
What are you doing out here, Willie?
- What are you doing out here?
- Frank.
Frank. I know Frank.
Frank killed himself!
Where is he, Willie?
Where is Frank?
Where is Frank?
In the shack! Oh, God!
Stay with him, now, Zip.
Stay with him, Zip!
And get a call in, you hear?
You 'll be all right, Willie.
Hey, Big John, why can't you wait?
You just stay here with him.
Take notes, John.
Gotta take notes.
Gotta take notes, John.
Take notes, John.
Take notes.
Body...
Point number four... yes.
See, there are pork chop bones in the garbage can.
Now, if we get those bones to the lab, we can determine exactly when those pork chops were cooked.
You got that, Doc?
Except we're not interested in when the pork chops died.
We're interested in when Frank here kicked the bucket.
Yeah, right.
You see, some of the buckshot embedded itself in this loaf of bread and when we cut the loaf of bread open, we're gonna make an exact judgment on the trajectory of the buckshot.
Doc, don't do that.
Hold it! What are you doing?!
What are you doing?
You 're touching the gun, you 're touching the body.
Yeah, I'm touching the gun, and I'm touching the body.
'Cause this is the gun that shot the man.
Right.
This body is the man that pulled the trigger.
He shot himself.
No, no, no. That's a suicide.
If it's a suicide, we don't have a case.
That's it.
We don't have a case.
That's no good, Doc, because, you see, I got a whole theory here.
The pork chop... that's nothin'.
My notes here, I can give you a whole...
We haven't got anything.
There hasn't been a murder, the man shot himself, and we're not interested in your pork chops, your loaves of bread, or your notes.
Get that through your head.
No. No.
It ain't gonna be that way, Doc.
Say, I am the officer in charge here.
Now, that is my body, and that's my gun, and you keep your hands off of them, you got it?!
Who do you think you 're talking to?
Hey, cool it.
Ryker's here.
Don't be messing around now, Zip.
You know what this guy is doing?
He's trying to steal my case.
He can hear everything you 're saying in here.
I don't give a damn!
You listen to me, hatchet artist.
You 're tampering with evidence.
And if you put your finger on one more thing in this room,
I'm gonna bust your ass.
That's right, the officer in charge is talking to you, and he's saying that you 're gonna be arrested as an accessory after the fact in a murder case!
Will you listen to me, son?
I've had a lot of patience with you.
You want to be a policeman.
You wanna stay on the force.
You just get the hell out of here and get on that motorcycle and start tagging automobiles, because if I hear one more peep out of that goddamn yap of yours,
I'm gonna see that you go to Siberia!
- I'm the coroner here!
- Well, I am the officer in charge!
Wintergreen is the name.
John Wintergreen.
Get him out of here.
Knock it off! Come on, man.
Get out of here.
Get on that motorcycle and get outta here!
- What do we got, Doc? Suicide?
- Jesus Christ!
I just got through with him,
I gotta put up with you?!
Get the hell out of here.
You goddamn boys in blue are driving me up the wall!
Why did you have to shoot yourself in my jurisdiction?
It don't fit, Zipper.
I tell ya, there's something wrong here.
There's something wrong here, and that's a fact.
There is no man... nobody goes and takes a shotgun and shoots themself in the chest when there's a chance that they're gonna bleed to death for hours.
No, sir!
They go right for the head.
Everything above the neck comes off.
That's it.
This was my chance, Zipper.
I could've made it this time, and I'm ready for it, too.
I tell ya, this is a murder.
I know it, and they're gonna make it look like a suicide, and they're gonna blow my chance for me.
I coulda proved it, too, Zipper.
- Officer?
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name?
- Wintergreen, sir.
Ryker, you think there's any need for an investigation?
Well, no, sir, I don't think so.
You don't, huh?
Doc.
- Hi, Doc.
- Harve.
You think there's any need for an investigation?
Harve, my office is already over-budget and the council's on my back.
You want me to blow another thousand for an autopsy on some old bastard nobody gives a damn about?
Well, psychologically,
I'd like to know why the old guy shot himself in the chest instead of the head. Wouldn't you?
All right. I'll cut him up for you.
Glad you feel that way about it, Doc.
Incompetence is the worst form of corruption.
Glad there's somebody around here who understands that.
The pericardial sac is not filled with a great deal of blood.
That's really surprising.
You 'd think he probably bled a lot.
Well, it's hard to say.
I can aspirate about two or three hundred cc's from the left plural cavity.
About 150 from the right.
Okay.
I'm going to do the standard evisceration here.
All right.
The posterior aspect of the chest is riddled with shotgun pellets.
Hello. What have we here?
There's a larger object.
Irregular lump of metal about five, six millimeters in diameter.
Come off it, Doc.
It's a.22 slug.
Yeah.
That's where it went in.
There's virtually no external trace.
This guy was shot in the back of the head.
It looks like he was dead before he decided to commit suicide.
You sure have a nose for it, Harve.
We might've put this guy in a box and buried him and nobody'd ever know.
Have to hand it to you, Harve.
- Wintergreen.
- Yes, sir.
I need a new driver.
We got a murder on our hands.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, do you know Harve Poole?
Sure.
Well, you see, I'm his new driver.
Harve's in the can.
Well, could you tell him his car's waiting outside for him?
Come on over here, friend.
Sit down here.
Come on, come on, come on.
So, I get this call, see, it says I got trouble with a coon on my roof.
Hey, Big John. You playin' with the big boys today?
You look so good.
You finally graduated, huh?
Well, I'll be over tonight and give you your diploma.
- I'll be there.
- You better be.
- Are you still split up?
- She's after me.
Is she?
Gin.
Deal me out.
Any of you juicers play gin?
Hey, kid. Wanna play in this game?
A quarter a hand.
No. No, thanks.
I don't play cards.
I always lose.
This here's a winner's circle, Wintergreen.
Your beer's on the table, Harve.
Only losers I deal in are in the jail or in the morgue.
They all don't belong there.
Well, well, well.
John Wintergreen.
Al here, he's our griper.
He complains about the brass.
He complains about the system.
And you know what?
He'll probably end up being the first cop we carry out in a box.
Everybody doesn't hate you for helping them.
Nine cops gunned down in two years?
You call that casual statistics?
A goddamned open season.
The conspiracy's reaching out national proportions.
This country is undergoing a precisely formulated conspiracy of police genocide.
A carefully organized plan of civilian brutality, and it's just around the corner.
And the sooner we get to dealing with it, the sooner I get to save your precious ass from some nigger waiting in the bushes ready to nail ya.
You want to be a detective, Wintergreen?
What you need is a hook, my man.
And right now, I am your hook.
Let's eat, gentlemen.
Come and around me stand
All right, wait a second.
Hi, Willie.
Remember me?
John Wintergreen.
Remember?
This is Harve Poole.
He's gonna help.
He's a detective.
See there?
Don't touch.
Don't touch the badge.
Willie, can you tell Harve about when you came down off of the Superstition Mountain?
And you went to the shack, remember?
Superstition.
Just that day,
I come off the Superstition.
And just that day,
I opened the door to the shack.
And that's when I saw him.
Who's got the Batman?
Who's got the Batman?
Who got the Batman, huh?
Who got the Batman?
How long were you up there, Willie?
How long were you up on the mountain?
Two, three months, maybe.
Can you prove you were up there that long?
I don't carry no time clock.
What in the hell he think
I go up there for?
All right, you came down from the mountain, you went to Frank's.
Is that your story, Willie?
I only got two friends in the world.
Frank and Superstition.
You fellas lock the door to the cabin?
Sure, Willie. Promise.
Thanks.
There have been a lot of strange, funny people hanging around there the last year.
What do you mean funny people?
L... I guess I don't mean people.
What, Willie?
What do you mean?
- Kids.
- Kids?
Did you... why?
Why did Frank kill himself?
He didn't kill himself, Willie.
We're talking about murder.
See, somebody killed Frank, Willie.
He didn't kill himself.
Somebody killed him.
Somebody killed him.
5,000. What 5,000, Willie?
Frank had 5,000 stashed in that shack.
Where, Willie?
Where?
I don't know.
You find the 5,000, and you find out why.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Greed, you asshole!
Greed!
Here's the Batman.
Let it go, let it go!
You give it back!
Give it back!
Let my friend alone.
Let my friend alone!
- You hear anything, Wintergreen?
- Sir? No.
The night is talking to us, Wintergreen.
Sit down and listen.
Okay.
When the night talks to you, you gotta listen, Wintergreen.
Look at that moon.
Listen to that desert.
That desert's gonna help me solve a murder.
Does that sound strange to you, Wintergreen?
Well, there's college as education, there's learning, there's knowledge, and then... there's wisdom.
And that's what old Harve has got... wisdom.
Wisdom is like religion.
What's your religion, Wintergreen?
Well, I don't go too much with that Jesus and things like that, but I do... I do kind of believe a little bit in reincarnation.
My religion is myself.
When I talk to myself, I'm talking to the whole world, Wintergreen.
And right now the whole world is answering me.
Right inside that house are the answers to a murder, but you know where
I'm gonna find my answers?
Right inside here, Wintergreen.
Inside here.
A man's gotta listen to his inner voice.
It's a God-given gift.
And don't you forget it.
Well, let's go on inside and see what's going on.
Wintergreen, I wanna make you the best damn detective in Arizona.
We looking for the 5,000, Harve?
No.
If we were looking for a million, it wouldn't solve the murder, would it?
No.
We're... we're not looking for the 5,000, Wintergreen.
What are we looking for, Harve?
Well, we're looking for something that... that don't belong.
Jesus is talking to me, Wintergreen.
I think I hear Jesus talking to me.
Now... what do you suppose a 70-year-old man would be doing with a lot of reds?
Eatin' 'em or...
Sellin' 'em.
I gotta hand it to ya, Harve.
You sure knew you were looking for something.
Yeah, Wintergreen, and I'm looking for something now.
Robert W. Zemko.
You figure Zemko's the one, huh?
Well, Wintergreen, when you find a load of dope and fingerprints of a convicted dealer, it don't take a brain like Harve Poole to know you got a prime suspect.
Right, Harve.
I never would've figured old Frank to be a dealer.
You wouldn't, huh?
You just watch me, Harve.
If Zemko's around here,
I'm gonna find him.
You will, huh?
Well, go to it, Wintergreen.
Okay, Harve.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
I'm Officer John Wintergreen, and I don't mean to harass you any, but I'd like to get some information.
- I got some information.
- Good.
You 're standing in pig shit.
- That's all you wanna know?
- Yes. Thank you very much.
- Don't you wanna meet my pigs?
- No, no. No, thank you.
See you later.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Do you know Bob Zemko?
- No, I don't.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
Are you on a Bob Zemko hunt?
Yeah, I guess... I guess I am.
Come on.
We'll help you find him.
Thank you very much.
This is very nice of you people.
Hey, people!
Gather around.
The little chief would like to say a few words to us.
Thank you.
My name is John Wintergreen,
Officer John Wintergreen, and we're looking for a fellow named Bob Zemko.
Anybody know him?
Bob Zemko?
Anybody know him?
Thank you.
Okay. Bob Zemko.
No...
Well, all right.
Thank you very much.
Now, in the interest of police community relations, if any of you know him or hear from him,
I would like for you to get in touch with me.
For sure.
You 've been very cooperative.
Thank you.
- Bye-bye, little chief.
- Bye.
- See you later, man.
- Good-bye, now.
- Thank you very much.
- Watch your step, officer.
Okay. Harve.
I checked the whole place out and Zemko isn't there, and they don't know him.
So we can go if you want to.
Looks like you stepped in a little community relations.
In the interest of community relations, as my partner suggests...
I don't wanna shoot anybody today.
Now, the little fella tells me you don't know where Bob Zemko is.
He's broken the law.
We're making an effort to find him.
We only wanna do our job and keep our friendly relations with the community.
Now, once more, has anyone seen him or know anything about him?
What'd you say, son?
Have we improved communications yet?
Are you listening to me?
I don't think he's listening to me.
You know, officer, we're not hassling you.
We don't know anything about Bob Zemko or where he is.
Really.
Do you understand?
Yeah, I guess I was out of line, huh?
I want you all to excuse me.
Yes, sir.
I'm getting impatient!
Somebody talk to me.
I know Bob Zemko.
Come on.
I got a Coke and Fresca and a Tab.
I didn't know which one you 'd like.
- Wintergreen.
- Yes, sir.
Come here a minute, please.
Harve, did you find out anything about Zemko?
Yeah, she told me the last time she saw him, he was heading north.
We got an APB out on him.
Her old man's coming over from Crown Drive... be here any minute.
Make sure she gets in the car.
- Yes, sir.
- Wintergreen.
Let me tell you something... a little something about police work and women.
If you mix the two, you can't do justice to either one.
- You get my point?
- Yes, sir.
I like to find myself here about this time every evening, Wintergreen.
There's a fine young lady
I'd like to introduce you to.
Fine young lady.
Brought a lot of happiness into my life.
Well, well, well!
My two knights in shining armor.
Mr. Tall and Mr. Small.
I'm sorry, but the place is closed.
That don't matter, because you 're both very special.
Come on in, gentlemen.
You ready to leave?
Harve, you 're always on duty.
Run, run, run, run.
You can't relax.
But you know how to relax, don't you, Johnny?
Drinks for the gangbusters!
Zap, zap! You 're dead!
And I'm offering you my hospitality, and it ain't nice to say no.
So close the door, Harve.
I ain't gonna bite ya.
One drink, Jolene.
Then I'm gonna take you home.
Well, I wanna hear music, Harve.
Don't you wanna hear music?
You like music, don't you, Johnny?
I know you like music.
Let's see, now.
You got your hat, and you got your badge, and you got your boots.
You got it all, don't you, Johnny?
You got everything.
You got it all, don't ya?
You 're happy, aren't you, Johnny?
Well, I know just the tune that'll fit ya.
You like to dance, Johnny?
Harve doesn't like to dance.
Do you, Harve?
You don't like anything, do you?
But I like to dance.
Do you know I used to be a dancer, Harve, huh?
Do you know I used to be a dancer?
Lused to be a Rockette for a year in New York.
I really ground them out.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Did you know that I had my very own dance team?
I sure did.
By God, I sure did.
Right there I am.
My very own dance team.
Yeah.
There I am just before I left for Hollywood.
Miss Peaches and Cream,
Miss Nice, Miss Naive.
Hollywood.
Just saying that word means magic time to me.
I can remember when I was a little girl.
Lused to sit in a movie all by myself.
Lused to watch those movie stars, and they just looked like they was having the best time.
I couldn't imagine it, being a movie star.
I just wanted to jump up out of my seat, step into that picture, just touch 'em and be with them like they were surrounded by a big rainbow.
Like nothing could get to 'em.
I just wanted my life to be one long, beautiful movie.
But I never got to Hollywood.
No, I never did.
I never did.
And then I met my salesman.
Oh, God, how I loved my salesman.
His name was Jim.
We got married.
He wanted kids.
I didn't want any,
I wanted my career.
And I lost him.
I lost everything.
And I ended up here.
And that's... that's when I had my first wild affair with a policeman.
John Wintergreen, you were not my first policeman.
No way. No way.
You weren't supposed to hear that, Harve.
You just make believe that you didn't even hear that, okay?
Because I'm still your sweet, little innocent Jolene.
Why, you know that I'm still the girl next door.
And you know what, Harve?
There ain't a cop in town who'll tell you any different.
Right, Johnny?
Tell him.
Tell him all about it.
Come on, Johnny.
Come on.
Let the good times roll.
Don't worry about old Harve.
Maybe we can teach him something, huh?
Maybe we can teach old Harve something.
Come on, Johnny.
Come on, baby.
Show him how you do it!
Show him what you do to me!
Come on, Johnny.
Show him how you do it.
It's all right, Harve.
Come on, Harve.
Come on, baby.
It's gonna be okay.
Come on.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I still like ya, Harve.
I'll always like ya.
Big John... I love Big John.
'Cause he makes me feel so good.
But you 're king of the mountain, Harve!
You 'll always be king of the mountain, Harve.
Sure you will.
It's just that Johnny can do it three times in the morning, Harve.
And you can't do it at all.
Wintergreen.
Jolene's a colorful girl.
She's... she's Ionely.
Sometimes she drinks a little too much.
Likes to play her little games... make her daddy angry.
But I want you to know... and I know that you do...
...that not one word of what she said back there is the truth.
Jolene and I have had a long, wonderful relationship.
And it should not have been interfered with by you.
What I'm trying to say is... is Jolene is... is my woman, and you shoulda kept your hands off her!
There was no reason for you two to... to... to...
Because she's contented!
You know what that means,
Wintergreen?
It's contented!
Jolene's...
You...
Goddamn you!
You ever touch her again, I'II...
Don't... don't you tell anybody.
You hear me, Wintergreen?
Don't you tell anybody!
You tell anybody, I'll kill you!
Hey, Big John, what you want to read?
I got Buck Rogers, Plastic Man.
Hey, I even got ol' Pogo.
Nah. No Pogo today.
John, you gotta get a better attitude towards things.
Look at us.
Look what a sweet life we got.
Yeah, look at us.
What am I looking at?
See up there?
Bikes, it looks like.
Gee, Ge-monettie!
Wonder Woman.
You ever read that?
I hate that motorcycle they make me ride.
I'm here to tell ya there ain't nothing in the world I hate worse than that elephant under my ass.
Boy. Look at this meat and potatoes, John.
Man. That Wonder Woman is really built.
Them kiddies are coming this way.
You want some sunflower fritees?
Zipper, you got a blast furnace for a gut.
You could live off beer cans and horseshoes.
It's my attitude.
You got an attitude.
Look here. Ain't she about the prettiest thing you ever saw?
Hey, Zipper!
Let's take a little ride.
- I ain't leavin' the shade.
- They got some ladies with 'em.
- Wanna go get 'em?
- Let's do it.
Zipper! That's Zemko!
That's the guy I'm looking for!
Hey, it's the cops.
Let's go!
Let's go get him, Zipper!
Cops, cops!
Move out!
Shit!
Hey! Wait a minute!
No! Goddamn you, Zipper!
Damn your ass!
You little shit!
Where would a freak like you get $3,700, Zemko?
Busting gumball machines?
Cashing the pennies in?
Or did you find the money in the shack?
We found three sets of your prints in that shack, which makes me think that you 're not too bright.
But I suppose you 're gonna tell me you dropped in for a cup of tea, is that right?
- No, sir.
- You bet it isn't!
Because we found a half a bushel of dope in that shack.
We...
...we also know you were busted for dope in Vietnam, and you got a track record here as long as the Gettysburg Address.
Now, what does that add up to?
Well, I'll tell ya, son.
We ain't talking about dope.
We're talking about murder!
Cold-blooded, premeditated, first degree murder!
What do you want me to tell you, sir?
You better think of something, son!
Because I'm moved to work you over.
I'm moved to bust your kidneys!
And I won't leave a trace.
Not a mark on you!
You hear what I'm saying to you?!
I'll work you over till you wished you died last year, you hear me?!
Get outta here, Wintergreen!
Hey, now, get back.
Get off the stage.
Come on, back up.
Yeah, well, the truth of the matter is,
John Wintergreen, you don't your ass from a row of rat shit in a wind storm.
Hi, there.
I'm talking to myself.
But I ain't listening.
You 're supposed to listen to your inner voices.
They tell you what to do.
Ain't that funny how people do all kind of things, and most of it's just a lot of bullshit?
You know what?
Ninety percent of the things
I've done in my life ain't as important as you sweeping that floor...
...or sitting there eating your sandwich.
You know why?
'Cause you listen to yourself.
Me, I listen to everybody in the whole damn world except me.
I'd like to start all over again.
Ain't that the damnedest thing?
My old man used to listen to himself.
And when he died, they told me it was a thrombosis.
But I know it was suicide.
Loneliness.
Do you know that Ioneliness'll kill you deader than a.357 Magnum?
Did you know that?
Old Frank is dead.
Boy, blowed in half. I saw him.
And I know who killed him.
Now, ain't that the damnedest thing?
I just listen to myself, and I know who killed him.
Ain't that the damnedest thing?
Come and around me stand
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Come, come, angel band
- You listen to me, Willie.
- Come
You 're not gonna sit out here all alone and die.
I ain't gonna let you.
Now, I figured it out.
It was you that killed Frank.
I know that.
It couldn't have been nobody else.
But it's all right, 'cause we're gonna get you some help.
And you 'll do some time, but you won't be Ionely anymore, Willie.
No more.
I wasn't Ionely when Frank was here.
I was Ionely years ago... but Frank and me and the Superstition, we hit it off real good.
But Frank left me.
He left me long before I killed him.
He left me and he went off with them young kids and...
We used to sit in the shack together, but Frank, he wasn't there no more.
No. He was off with them young kids, laughing and joking and being different.
I remember back in '42, when Frank and me found each other.
Frank used to get mad at me, but I'd just go on up in the Superstitions.
I'd dig up some rocks, and I'd go back.
He wouldn't be mad no more.
But then he went off with them kids.
And he wouldn't listen to me.
I tried to make him listen, but he wouldn't.
He wouldn't believe me.
And now I gotta go back to the Superstition.
No, you don't, Willie.
No, you don't.
It's gonna be okay.
You won't be Ionely no more.
Nobody's gonna get mad at you.
- Nothing matters.
- I promise you.
- It does too matter.
- No, it doesn't.
Nothing matters no more.
It does, Willie.
You matter, Willie.
What? Are you one of them?
Are you one of them who Frank went off with?
No, no, Willie.
I'm one of them who's gonna stay here with you.
You get your bird, Willie.
Come, come, angel band
Come and around me stand
Bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Please bear me away
You sing, Willie.
- Come, Come
- To my immortal home
You stay here just for a minute, Willie.
- You stay there now, Willie.
- No.
I'll be right back, now.
I'll be right back, Willie.
You sing, Willie.
No, it's okay.
Just leave him alone, please?
...angel band...
Get in the car, Willie.
Now, you remember what I promised you, Willy.
Wherever they take you tomorrow,
I'm gonna come and see you.
You watch for me.
You ever been up in the Superstition Mountains, boy?
L... I know places there that nobody's ever seen.
I wanna see 'em, Willie.
You watch for me, now.
Wintergreen.
What's the story?
Well, Frank was dealing, all right.
Must've been 'cause he liked having young folks around.
I guess old people get that way.
Kids would come and have a good time.
I suppose Frank did, too.
Willie got jealous.
And that's the way it was.
Zemko didn't have nothing to do with the killing.
Just like that, huh?
That's right, Harve.
Somebody died over Ioneliness.
Sometimes it's just that simple.
What about the murder weapon?
I don't know nothing about that.
All I know is that Willie killed Frank
'cause he was old and scared, tired and Ionely.
We ripped up his house, didn't we?
Why don't you go out there and dig up the whole world?
Maybe you can find the gun.
What about the $3,700 we found on the kid?
It was his own.
Saved it, something.
That simple?
That's right, Sarge.
Just that simple.
- Why didn't he tell anyone?
- He told somebody.
But old Harve didn't believe him.
Suppose that's right.
What happened to Frank's 5,000?
I don't know.
Maybe there never was any 5,000.
I don't even care.
You haven't got a case, Wintergreen.
I don't care about having a case, Harve.
All I care about is that you were wrong.
You beat up them kids down at the commune, they didn't do nothing to you, and you were wrong for that.
And you beat up Zemko, and he was telling you the truth, and you were wrong for that, and Willie told you the truth.
You 've been wrong all along, Harve.
And you can take that cigar and that suit and the badge, and you can give 'em to some other scared little mouse who'll believe your horse shit.
You 're full of horse shit, Harve.
You old drunken toad.
Detective Wintergreen.
Come over here.
Oh, no, Zipper.
It was just laying there, Big John.
I had to take it.
What was he gonna do with all that money?
If it hadn't been just laying there,
I wouldn't have taken it.
You believe that, don't you?
That kid Zemko was going over.
Zipper, you were gonna let him.
You know what that makes you?
Do you?
We only get what's coming to us.
What I got coming to me...
Sweet Jesus, I'm scared!
Don't be scared now, Zipper.
Now, now, we'II... we'll fix it.
We'll talk to Ryker.
That's what we'll do.
Come on, now.
I'm scared, John.
They're gonna know me.
Oh, Daddy!
They're all gonna know me now!
Daddy.
What should I do, Daddy?
Everybody's gotta know me.
All you proper coppers.
I'm Zipper the Slipper.
So everything goes.
The Electra Glide goes, my police motor goes, my badge goes, my gun goes, my uniform.
My pension goes.
Everything goes.
But that's supposed to be all right with me.
Because that's proper police procedure.
No. No, no, no!
You do what you gotta do, Big John.
I mean, you do what's right, man.
P.P.P.
Proper Police Procedure.
Officer Wintergreen!
I'm gonna blow your rotten little heart out!
No!
Zipper.
Now, come on, Zipper.
Come on, now, Zip!
Cut it out, Zipper!
No, Zipper! Stop it! Damn you!
You 're killing people, Zipper!
Will you quit it?!
Don't die, Zipper.
Come on, man.
Don't die!
Get up, Zipper.
Get up, Zipper.
Oh, God.
Don't die, Zip.
Don't die.
Zipper. Don't die, Zipper.
Oh, God.
Oh, man!
We're getting cracked, man.
We're getting cracked.
I'm freaking out, man.
Just take it easy, Hank.
Just take it easy.
Sweet talk him good.
Just sweet talk him.
- Can I see your license, please?
- Good morning.
Yeah.
You know, you need a front bumper here.
Morning.
Don't I know you?
I owe you one, don't I?
Go on, get out of here.
Hey. Get a bumper on that thing before you get a ticket, will you?
Outta sight.
[melodious music]
Agatha.
[music continues]
You're supposed to be at the Savoy, aren't you?
- Do you like it?
- Well, yes.
I thought you might like to keep it at the club.
My love, my friend, at the club.
Mm. Sorry. Of course, yes,
I see what you mean.
Would it do as a shaving mug, do you think?
Agatha, why aren't you at your literary luncheon?
I'm ready.
I can't face going without you.
I can't.
[phone ringing]
'Miss Neele.'
Cancel my appointments for this afternoon, will you?
- Use all your charm.
- Shall I cancel everything?
I'll telephone you later.
Agatha.
'Agatha.'
[neighing]
Thank you.
[honking]
- Welcome, sir.
- Hi.
If anyone asks for Mr. Stanton, tell them to wait.
- I'll take care of you later.
- Yes, sir.
It must be there. It must be there. Perhaps it's not..
My assistant has already told you, it is invitation only.
But I'm saying that
I didn't get my invitation.
Look, Mrs. Christie is the only celebrity
'we got in Sunningdale.
And I'm the only reporter.'
Look again, please.
John Foster.
Sunningdale Echo.
'He's definitely not on my list.'
'Even if you had an invitation' we couldn't allow you in dressed like that.
- Like what?
- Without a tie, sir.
No, I've got a tie.
Please check.
If I don't get in, I'll be looking for a new job on Monday.
But you're not on my list.
Welcome, Mr. Stanton.
Nice to have you with us.
Good to see you. Have you enjoyed your stay in England?
- Yes, I have. Thank you.
- Been over here long, sir?
- Approximately four weeks.
- We enjoy reading your columns.
- I think you ought go.
- Yeah, but--
You're John Foster?
I must tell you that I've enjoyed reading your columns in the..
- Sunningdale Echo.
- Right.
- Especially that section on..
- Potted plants.
Potted plants. I admire your driving style and may I say that what you said about philodendrons needed saying.
- Have you gentlemen read it?
- No, we haven't.
It's a pity. It's the best stuff I've read.
We better go. I think we'll miss the presentation.
- Nice to see you again.
- That's very kind of you, sir.
My pleasure.
You doing a piece on
Mrs. Christie, too?
I am. She's fascinated me for years.
I am entirely confident that this brilliant book
"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" will take its place as a classic of crime fiction.
Which one is Agatha Christie?
Is that her with the fur?
'No, Mrs. Christie is the one in the Cloche hat.'
That's her husband, the Colonel, sitting next to her.
I have to thank Mrs. Christie in anticipation for the great good she is doing not only to my heart but to my pocket.
To secure the company of this very retiring lady
I had to pay a small price.
Ah, it was that she should not be asked to make a long speech.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Agatha Christie.
[audience clapping]
Thank you very much.
[audience clapping]
She's much more attractive than I'd imagined.
And much sadder.
She is not sad, just shy.
'Ladies and gentlemen.'
Mrs. Christie has kindly consented to sign copies of her book.
The table below here has been reserved for this purpose.
Come, Agatha, this way.
'I know you don't like giving press interviews'
'but there's someone
I would like you to meet.'
'Wallace Stanton.
Have you heard of him?'
'Yes, I think I have.'
Well, doesn't look like I'll get to meet her in this crowd.
I'd like to chat with you about the Christie's before I interview her.
Gimme a ring tomorrow at the chartered house.
We'll have a drink, alright?
Seriously? I would love to, Mr. Stanton.
- 'Do you seriously mean it?'
- Seriously.
'Sorry I can't stay, gentlemen.
But I am sure..'
Show me to my seat, please.
You're back early. If I'd known you're coming back on your own
I'd have waited for you.
I lost Colonel Christie in the melee.
- Did he come back?
- No.
- Did he telephone?
- No.
'Well, he's fearfully busy.'
'We will be, too.'
Just wait till you see the newspaper cuttings.
Afternoon, Madam.
Oh, they've repaired my typewriter.
'Oh, yes. I've got something to show you.'
I brought this today.
I am determined to learn the Charleston properly.
Will you play it for me?
Just for laugh.
It won't take a minute.
Can you count me in, though.
One, two, two, two.
[piano music]
This is the tricky bit.
'Gets faster all the time.'
I'll teach it to you after the..
I went to the office today. I saw her.
Now, that was daft.
[piano music]
[vehicle approaching]
[dog barking]
- 'Good morning, sir.'
- 'Mrs. Christie up?'
'Not yet, sir.'
Good morning, madam.
Archie, I am so sorry.
I feel such a fearful fool.
I completely forgot to tell you.
Betty and Tom Goodall are giving a house party this weekend and they asked us to come, and I said yes.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, Agatha, you know that I can't come.
Well, I know you're usually busy at weekends but we've said no such a lot of times.
'Agatha, we have been over this enough.'
'I cannot come,
I will not come.'
I'm going with Captain Rankin to the country for the weekend.
'I've given him my word'
'and I am not going to let him down.'
'Our situation is intolerable.'
I don't love you, and you do not love me.
'Our marriage is finished. It's over.'
'Agatha, listen to me.'
'I want a divorce.'
I love Miss Neele, and I want to marry her.
[sobbing]
We could be happy.
I am sorry,
I am sorry. I'm..
I love you very much, and I will make you happy.
'It's too late.'
I'll find a lawyer who can...name some woman and..
The whole thing can be accomplished with a minimum of fuss.
- There is already somebody.
- Yes, but you can't name her.
Why not?
Because I'm going to marry Miss Neele.
I'm not going to have her or her family dragged into the newspapers.
Archie, you're dragging your family into this.
'Well, that is..'
'Look at me.'
 Look at me.
I want a divorce.
Will you give me one?
No, I won't.
'Then we must live apart.'
'I shall make arrangements to be out of this house'
'after the weekend.'
Don't leave me, don't, please, please.
Get up, get up.
Agatha.
Get out!
- Get up!
- Please, I can't..
Get up!
Have you no sense of dignity?
You particularly play up in front of the servants.
That's not true.
I do not want to be with you.
[door slams]
'Jane, if there're any messages,
I will be at Captain Rankins.'
'I shouldn't be more than an hour.'
Good Morning. Wally Stanton.
Here to interview Mrs. Christie.
Out of the question. My wife doesn't talk with journalists.
I am afraid there's been some mistake.
No mistake, get this cab out of here.
I am Archibald Christie. So if you don't mind, Mr. Stanton.
Excuse me, I think you inadvertently placed your hand on my arm.
Not inadvertently, sir.
Please leave us.
- You forgot your briefcase.
- Oh, thank you.
Look, she's not feeling very well.
- Don't let anyone speak to her.
- 'Oh, Colonel.'
I'm delighted to have finally met the husband
'of the famous
Agatha Christie.'
Good morning, ma'am.
Please give my respects to the lady of this house.
'Alright, driver.'
[rattling]
Think I better stay.
Is there anything
I can do for you?
No, thank you.
I spoke to Miss Neele..
...about the bills.
Then she told me about her trip to the spa so I didn't even have to worm it out of her.
- Which spa was it?
- Harrogate.
The Valencia Hotel.
She's going there for two weeks with her aunt
'to have treatments to lose weight.'
I won't go.
No, it's alright, you go off.
I'll see you later.
'Anything wrong, madam?'
I'm just going away, Jane.
I'll give you..
...a message tomorrow as to where I am.
[engine revving]
[car honking]
[continues honking]
Run! Run!
[tire screeching]
[glass shattering]
[engine stops]
[birds chirping]
They're coming, daddy.
Alright.
Thank you, Annie.
The lights must have been left on because the battery had gone dead.
Ah, only slight damage to the car.
Here. Come, don't you touch it.
Alright?
You understand?
That doesn't make sense.
'Why would anyone leave an expensive fur coat like that'
'in weather like this?'
- My daddy found..
- Hello.
'Ah, good morning, sir.'
Did he? Good for him.
'That's Mr. Luland's daughter, sir. He found the car.'
Ah, Superintendent Kenward,
Fredrick Luland.
He owns Luland's Cafe on the Docking Road, sir.
- Morning.
- He found the car.
On my way to work.
Clothes scattered around in the back, sir.
They touch anything?
Uh, uh, only this, sir.
Found it on the front seat.
Mrs. Agatha Mary
Clarissa Christie.
And it's out of date.
Yes, sir,
I noticed that, sir.
[ballroom music]
'Uh, yes, monsieur?'
'Ah, is Mr. Stanton here?'
Foster. It's alright, waiter.
Eh, pardon.
What a nice surprise.
Please join me.
Thanks. Something's happened, Mr. Stanton.
- You can take your coat off.
- Oh, yeah.
[waiter snaps finger]
I thought you'd like to know about it right away.
Thank you.
Would you like some lunch? Francoise.
Yes, I would actually.
Please set a plate for my friend.
How is the lobster thermidor?
Well, it's not exactly the right time of year, Mr. Stanton.
- What would you recommend?
- We have some nice Andouille.
'How does that sound, Foster?'
Excellent.
And the entree?
- To follow.
- The main course, sir.
Ah, do they have steak?
I'm sure they do.
How'd you like it?
Well cooked...with chips.
Could he have a Chateaubriand?
- That is for two, sir.
- I know.
 Chateaubriand with chips.
- Now, what is it, Foster?
- What?
What did you wanna tell me?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, Mrs. Christie.
[glass clinking]
She disappeared.
I beg your pardon?
They found her car abandoned.
- Where?
- 'Newland's Corner.'
How far away is that?
About an hour's drive.
Let's go.
'Take the boat far to the right.'
'How deep is it where you are now, Stevens?'
'About four feet, sir.'
- 'How thick is the ice?'
- 'About a half an inch, sir.'
'Alright, get the other net.
Second net. I want two nets.'
'Where was the car found,
Superintendent?'
'About two hundred yards up the hill.'
'Why are you dragging the pool?'
Mrs. Christie left a letter, a rather disturbing letter for her secretary,
Miss Fisher.
Was it a suicide note?
No, you can't quote me saying that.
That's because of the letter you're dragging--
That's right.
Mrs. Christie leave any other letters behind?
- Not to my knowledge.
- Not even to her husband?
Not to my knowledge, no.
[talking indistinctly]
'Well, it can't be ruled out.'
- 'You extending the search?'
- 'Yes, if necessary.'
[talking indistinctly]
No one seems to know whether she's alive or dead.
He says Christie left a message for the secretary.
Nothing for the husband.
[car approaching]
[crowd chattering indistinctly]
You wait here.
- I can't, I'm afraid--
- He's arrived, sir.
Get these press boys out of the way.
Come on, lads, come on..
[talking indistinctly]
Kenward, sir.
Deputy Chief Constable.
Colonel Archibald Christie,
Captain Philip Rankin.
What's going on?
We're dragging the pool, sir.
Don't upset yourself, it's purely routine.
Dragging? What for?
'I assure you it's absolutely routine in these circumstances.'
My wife has not drowned herself.
I mean, the idea is ridiculous.
'Nothing ridiculous.'
'Hope this isn't a case of excessive zeal on your part' and I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.
'I hope so, sir.'
When did you last see your wife?
It was about, um...9 o'clock yesterday morning, breakfast.
How would you define your wife's state of mind at that time?
What exactly are you driving at, Kenward?
Well, in the past, sir, there have been rumors that Mrs. Christie threatened to kill herself.
Utter rubbish, servants' gossip.
I daresay you know that my wife is a well known writer of..
...murder mysteries.
Poison, intrigue, murder, and suicide.
It's-it's everyday family small talk.
I see, sir. So you have absolutely no idea what might have happened to her?
I'm sure nothing at all has happened to her.
But I would strongly urge you in your own interests to call all this off.
Why would you say that, sir?
I wouldn't like to see you make a fool of yourself, Kenward.
That's very considerate of you, Colonel.
Thank you.
No more questions.
[talking indistinctly]
[train whistling]
[train chugging]
[instrumental music]
Harrogate!
The Old Swan.
This way, madam.
The Old Swan Hotel.
Madam?
Is this all, madam?
Yes.
Good evening.
Good evening, I would like to book a room.
'For how long, madam?'
Ah, ab-about a fortnight
I should think.
'We have one at five guineas a week'
'and there are others at five and a half guineas a week'
'which overlook the garden.'
Well, I-I would think the garden.
'Very good, madam.'
May I have your name and address?
Neele, Mrs. Neele.
- Neele. Mrs. Neele..
- Teresa Neele.
And your address, please.
Cape Town,
South Africa.
[bell rings]
[sighs]
[orchestra music]
Would you recommend the Mulligatawny?
I'm not absolutely sure, madam.
What about the hare soup?
Excellent, madam.
I think.
I'll have that then.
And the Rognons de veau.
Oh, and the Yorkshire curd tart and cream.
Uh, don't you want the fish?
No, thank you.
Quite right, madam.
[snoring]
[clock ticking]
[snoring continues]
[ticking continues]
Hello.
I'm Evelyn Crawley.
A fellow inmate.
How do you do?
Would you like to join me?
[snoring continues]
[speaking softly]
- Mrs. Neele.
- Hello.
Teresa.
Have you-have you been here before?
I'm practically part of the furniture.
I've got a bit of back trouble and I come up here to get it smoothed out.
- 'What are you here for?'
- I've got back trouble as well.
Did you walk here?
Why?
You have a fearful ladder.
[train whistling]
'Platform three for
Leeds-Harrogate train.'
It's not too late.
We can still cancel.
Are you sure you don't want me to stay?
It's for the best.
Once she stops playing her bloody stupid games
I'll sort it out once and for all.
Decently.
I love you very much.
'Harrogate train, platform three..'
[train whistling]
Valencia Hotel, please.
[jangling]
Thank you, madam.
'Valencia Hotel.'
Oh, yes, hello, has a
Miss Nancy Neele booked in yet?
'Well, we have Miss Neele.'
- What?
- 'But she hasn't confirmed.'
Are you sure?
'Yes, would you like to leave a message?'
Oh, no, no. No message, thank you.
[operatic music]
'"Will friends and relations of Mrs. Teresa Neele, formerly'
'of South Africa, please get in touch with her immediately."'
- Do you think that's alright?
- 'Yes.'
Evelyn, my handwriting is so messy.
Would you mind copying this out for me?
No.
[music continues]
Were you born in South Africa?
You don't have that sort of accent.
Probably because I'm from
English-speaking South Africa.
- What now?
- Now, we send it to the Times.
Hey, you're being picked up.
He's very taken, isn't he?
'Where's his friend?
For me!'
My husband died recently.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
'All those new clothes.
You're a very extravagant lady.'
A good excuse, lost luggage.
And good therapy, a spending spree.
Yes, will your therapist see me without an appointment?
Oh yes, it's very quiet at this time of the year.
'It's so good of you, Evelyn.
I didn't know where to begin.'
We don't have to undress in public, do we?
No. It's not like some horrid school medical. It's exciting.
- 'Morning.'
- Good morning.
You meet all sort of interesting people..
Retired generals, ex-cabinet ministers, old Romeos.
'He proposed to me last week.'
Don't worry. He won't leave you in a bath chair.
'Next, please.'
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Yes, Ms. Crawley.
I'd like to take Mrs. Neele to meet Mrs. Braithwaite.
Then we'll come back and book some appointments.
Certainly, Miss Crawley.
Mrs. Neele is staying at the same hotel.
- The poor dear's been in agony.
- Oh, dear.
I told her the one person in England who could find out what was wrong with her, it was you, Mrs. Braithwaite.
That's very nice.
Thank you very much.
'Well, we do our best.'
'That's our famous natural hot springs.'
'Oh, you must try that.
I never want to come out.'
'Uh, Mrs. Neele, what seems to be the trouble?'
What did you say you thought it was, Evelyn?
Spondylitis.
Bad back.
'Now, don't you be put off.'
'That's for poor souls who can't walk.'
Don't need to wear a hat.
So, Mrs. Neele, I want you to tell me if anything is painful that I do to you.
Right?
You just shout out if anything hurts.
'Have you ever been told that...that you're a little'
'knock-kneed, Mrs. Neele.'
'Because you know, that could be the trouble.'
'Now, is that painful?'
- Hello.
- 'Valencia Hotel.'
Yes, I'm so sorry to trouble you.
Could you tell me has Ms. Nancy Neele registered with you yet?
'Yes, she has. She's at the royal bath this moment.'
She is?
'Would you like to leave a message?'
Oh, oh, no, no, no.
I-I don't need speak to her.
Thank you very much.
'I wanted to see you merely to express our gratitude'
'for the outstanding work you've done the last few weeks.'
Thank you.
Of course, since I bought this newspaper last year the circulation has increased considerably.
But since your arrival
'our figures during the past few weeks..'
Well, rest assured that we're not unaware of your contribution.
Thank you.
What you working on at the moment?
'A number of things.'
Anything particular?
- 'The Christie disappearance.'
- Oh, really?
Yes, I'm very intrigued by it.
I went down to Newlands
Corner yesterday.
'Yes, I heard you were there.'
Rather outside your usual range, isn't it?
Not really. I've read
Mrs. Christie's books over the years with increasing affection and admiration of her as a major talent.
Suffice to say, I'm..
...interested.
'Well, of course,
I'm no journalist.'
But I think our boys in the newsroom are keeping pace with the opposition on that story.
You are known, I think
I'm right in saying primarily as a distinguished, uh, interviewer.
- 'That's right.'
- Yes.
Are you suggesting that
I confine myself to interviews?
'I wouldn't dream of any such thing.'
My only concern is that you should not be attempting to waste your very valuable time.
I've had a word with
Colonel Christie.
Oh, good.
'And he assures me that this whole business' has been absurdly exaggerated.
Forgive me for asking.
But is this what the English call the old school time?
'Certainly not.'
'It seems I have to attend some dreary conference.'
- You will excuse me?
- Of course.
Splendid to see you.
Keep up the good work.
You must come and have dinner with me one day.
- Later this week perhaps.
- I may be busy.
[indistinct chattering]
[airplane droning]
[indistinct shouting]
How many people have you got?
Fifteen thousand, twenty?
You still digging for a story out of this, Foster.
[dogs barking]
'What's Colonel Christie up to?'
'I can't get an interview with him.'
'"My wife has disappeared.
No comment."'
Odd way to behave, wouldn't you say?
- If it was your wife missing?
- I'm not married.
But your first impulse wouldn't be to obstruct the police in the course of their duty, would it, Foster?
- Is he succeeding?
- He's doing his best.
I don't know what he and his cronies are up to.
But if there's a body,
I'm gonna find it.
Never mind the cost.
How's it going, Jarvis?
We've lost contact with unit four, sir.
Why don't you
 charge the Colonel with obstructing the police?
Yes, I might.
On the other hand it could be just the natural behavior of an arrogant, overbearing high-ranking sod.
Keep that off the record, by the way.
Whoever you're doing your penny allowin' for now.
Nice coat.
'Has your luggage come yet, then?'
'No, such a nuisance.'
Oh, they didn't have a copy of the Times.
Did you want it for something special?
Yes, I placed an advertisement.
I want a missing relative to contact me.
Oh, I'll see what I can do then.
You know, I follow this..
...missing writing woman.
Her husband says that "I am very worried and very harassed."
Bet he's an old poor man.
If he's determined to find her, he will.
'I'm sorry, there's no lemon.
Is milk alright?'
She hasn't killed herself, has she, Miss Fisher?
- Of course, not.
- You know that for certain?
Yes.
I mean, it's just not the sort of thing she'd do.
Look, I know her very well.
Why don't you tell me where she is?
Why should I know?
What makes you possibly think that..
Look at it this way.
Sooner or later, someone's bound to find her.
It would be much better for her and for me if that someone is myself.
Otherwise, it'll be the police and everyone will be down on her like vultures.
I think you should trust me.
Why?
Why not?
Another thing. Do you have any idea why Miss Nancy Neele
'should have gone to Harrogate?'
'How do you know about that?'
All in a day's work.
She once told me, if ever she got into any difficulty she'd find a way to get in touch with me.
She said she put an advertisement in the personal column of the Times.
Look, it's the double 'E' in
Neele that made me suspicious.
That's the way Nancy spells it.
This box number might--
I know a man on the Times.
Thank you, Miss Fisher.
You've been most helpful.
[water running]
Are you alright?
Just keep your feet away from the plates.
'Mrs. Braithwaite, what would happen'
'if you made the current stronger?'
You'd go whizz, bang, pop, hallelujah.
Don't worry, Mrs. Neele.
We know our job.
No, what would happen if you made the current any stronger is you'd probably get muscular cramp.
Muscular cramp is not serious.
'No, it's not very pleasant, my dear.'
I mean, if you'd got a delicate heart you could do serious damage.
'What's that chair for?'
Well, now, this is used for more serious complaints say, like arthritis or circulatory problems.
'Mind you, we're finding that more and more ladies'
'are using it for slimming purposes.'
Think it improves their looks, so they can go out and find lovers or some such nonsense like that.
Lot of it happens in this town, you know. Ooh!
My goodness me. You've had quite enough for today.
I hope this suite is warmer than the one I had in London.
'I'm sure it will be, sir.
Will that be all?'
No. See to it that there are freshly cut flowers in my suite.
I prefer roses, chrysanthemum, or violets if they can be had.
Certainly, sir. That shouldn't present any problem.
Have the valet come up to press my clothes?
Good, sir. I'll attend to it immediately.
Will you be staying long, sir?
- You'll know as soon as I know.
- Very good, sir.
The boy will show you to your room, sir.
Royal Baths. I'd like to speak to the booking clerk, please.
Oh, I forgot. Could you have a telephone installed in my room?
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.
Hello, may I have a word with you.
I'm Schatz. I'm gonna be staying here.
Would it be ghoulish if I offered you this to ensure me of your best services?
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Alright.
- Good morning.
- 'Good morning.'
My name is Schatz. I'm gonna be staying here for..
Oh, yes, hello. I'm ringing on behalf of Ms. Neele.
Miss, no, no.
Miss Nancy Neele.
'I'd like to confirm her appointments please.'
[jazz music]
[ballroom music]
[indistinct chattering]
'Oh, Theodore, you can do better than that.'
I knew a Scotsman who was an expert snooker player.
To that gentlemen,
I dedicate this shot.
The winning shot.
Don't you laugh.
'Oh. Bad luck.'
[indistinct chatter]
'I learnt the game of snooker from Uncle Jones here.' and it's to him that
I dedicate this final..
Would you like to take your hands off the green?
Final, spectacular shot.
- Miss, miss, missed.
- 'Thank you, thank you.'
'Your turn, your turn, your turn.'
- 'Sorry, uncle, do forgive me.'
- 'No, I won't.'
I wasted my time on that boy.
There's no doubt about that.
'The idea of the game is to get the ball into the pocket.'
This is the pocket.
There you are. Come along.
Would you mind removing that obstruction, please.
[no audio]
I got the distinct feeling that this isn't quite cricket
'but welcome aboard.'
[slow music]
- 'Oh, well.'
- 'Bravo.'
[clapping]
Ladies win. Ladies win.
Congratulations.
It's absolutely brilliant.
Well..
Pardon me. May I ask who you are.
Mrs. Neele.
- Mrs..
- Neele.
- Neele.
- Who are you?
Schatz. Uh,
Curtis Schatz Jr.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- You're American?
- Yes, I am.
Why have you come to Harrogate at this time of the year?
Well, may I be frank with you, Mrs. Neele.
Yes.
[whispering]
You're suffering from constipation?
Yes, I am.
May I ask what brings you here?
An ailment that is not dissimilar to your own.
Well, is it as painful?
It's unbearable.
Shall we dance?
You think that you can?
Well, we better give it a try.
[jazz music]
[horse neighing]
[chattering indistinctly]
Alright, Jarvis. Pack it up.
- Call 'em all in.
- Right, sir.
'Control to all units..'
So you don't have a corpse? Disappointed?
Don't think he did it.
Well, where is the Colonel?
Why isn't he here?
Everyone else is here except bloody Christie.
You think he knows something that you don't?
Well, somebody does.
[laughing]
[upbeat jazz music]
Your friend's quite good.
Yes.
- Do you know the Charleston?
- A little bit.
- Wanna give it a play?
- No, I'm not pretty good at it.
I'm superb at it.
I've won several trophies.
- It's very hot, isn't it?
- Oh, very.
- You wanna go for a walk?
- No!
That would be quite a good idea.
- Would you excuse us?
- Of course.
[music continues]
Is there a Mr. Neele about?
No, there isn't.
Why's that?
- I'm afraid he passed away.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
His gun went off while he was loading it.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
Are you married?
No, I'm not. At the, uh..
...risk of sounding redundant
I'm afraid my wife passed away too.
Pamela died of a perforated ulcer.
How appalling.
Would you care for a kiss?
No.
'Would you care for a cigarette?'
No, thank you.
Would you care if I told you that these attempts of humor are simply my way of telling you that I find myself very attracted to you?
- Much rather you didn't.
- 'Why?'
Because I love my husband very much.
My husband was very dear to me.
'I see.'
You know Mrs. Neele, when my wife passed away
I too grieved for her.
And it was only in the last two or three months
'that I discovered that I had been grieving'
'for a totally different reason.'
What do you mean?
I found out she had been unfaithful to me.
'I felt betrayed.'
Did your late husband ever betray you?
No, he isn't..
He wasn't that kind of man.
- What kind of man--
- 'Could I have a cigarette?'
Thank you.
Do you have any idea how lovely you are?
I think I've got to go.
Goodnight.
'Mrs. Neele.'
I'm afraid I didn't light your cigarette.
I hope we see each other again.
I would've thought that was practically unavoidable.
[typewriter keys clacking]
[church bells ringing]
[crow cawing]
Mrs. Neele.
'I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.'
I was wondering what you were thinking.
I was thinking how
Catherine and Heathcliff starved themselves to death.
You're attracted by thoughts of violence?
I don't think so.
I hope not.
Somewhere I must be.
One was killed in a brawl.
One died in a jail.
One fell from a bridge toiling for children, wife.
All...all sleeping..
...sleeping...sleeping on the hill.
I think we have something in common.
Would you like to go back?
[piano music]
[music continues]
Hello!
[gasps]
- How are you?
- 'I'm alright.'
I was watching you from there.
You didn't look like you were enjoying yourself.
- 'I can't swim.'
- Oh!
Someone tried to teach me by dropping me into the deep water.
- Got very frightened.
- Well, it's not difficult.
Come on over to the center, and I'll show you.
It's not hard.
Hold my hand.
Come on, if I can walk here, you can.
[laughing]
Hold on.
That's right.
That's right.
Let your feet go.
What do you mean?
Let them go up?
That's right.
- It's up.
- Alright.
- Sorry.
- It's alright.
[coughing]
- You alright?
- Yes.
Let your arms go.
Now, I'll hold your chin.
- Like that.
- Keep my..
- Just like that.
- ...my face out of the water.
Alright, it's out. Yes?
Yes, it is.
Don't worry, I'll hold you up.
[music continues]
That old lady reminds me of my grandmother.
I used to share a bed with her when I was a kid.
[talking indistinctly]
Do women walk on tip-toe when they're naked?
'I can't remember.'
I don't often look at their feet.
Evelyn!
[chuckling]
You like men very much, don't you?
Oh, most definitely.
But I'm very choosy.
Don't you think there is a need for faithfulness?
'Hardly seems worth it.
Men change so.'
That's why choosing is important.
We can't just let things happen to us.
No, I know.
'"My wife and I had no quarrel.'
'"There was never any difference of opinion regarding'
'our mutual friends,"
Colonel Christie stated.'
'He added that he did not wish to speculate'
'on how these rumors have come about.'
'Sound like their story.'
There's no smoke without fire, don't you think?
It's another man, isn't it, Mrs. Braithwaite
- 'Or he's done away with her.'
- 'It's fishy. It's very fishy.'
Oh, dear Mrs. Neele. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Now, dear, are you ready?
- Yes, thank you.
You are just going to enjoy this.
It's very good for your complaint.
- Go on, dear, then. In you go.
- It's horrible, isn't it?
It's like the electric chair in the United States.
Funny idea. I could think of one or two people
I wouldn't mind dispatching in that.
I suppose we all could.
Could this be lethal?
Oh, yes. I suppose it could be.
'Think you'd have to be an electrical engineer though.'
'Why would you think that?'
You'd have to know how to put rheostat out of action.
What is the rheostat?
Oh, these are the rheostats, madam.
It controls the current that passes into the chair.
Morbid conversation.
Don't you worry.
You're perfectly safe.
'We haven't lost a patient yet, have we?'
I don't think Mrs. Neele quite trusts us yet, Mrs. Braithwaite.
After all, this is your fourth appointment, madam, isn't it?
No, that's Ms. Nancy Neele.
This is Mrs. Teresa Neele.
Spelt the same way, as a matter of fact.
Right, off we go.
[machine whirring]
[indistinct chattering]
[chattering continues]
'Good morning.'
- I'd like to taste the waters.
- Certainly, sir.
Is there a charge?
- Sulphur's free, sir.
- It is.
First time in Harrogate, sir?
Yes, it is. I must say I've never enjoyed a better vacation.
Oh, Ms. Neele.
'Your appointment this afternoon has been arranged.'
- 'Thank you, very much.'
- 'Thank you.'
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.
Mr. Faulkson, I saw you dancing, and you looked 22 years old.
- Keep it up.
- Nice of you to say so.
Here I am.
It's a lovely fur.
I see you're keeping up with the Agatha Christie affair.
Do you think she's dead?
Everyone else seems to.
They do, don't they?
Yes, all except her husband.
I read this morning that he offered 500 pounds for information.
What do you think?
Perhaps, that's all she's worth.
It's surprising that he puts any price on his wife's head.
There's something I hadn't noticed before.
Look at that photo. She bears a striking resemblance to you.
What do you think?
That's exactly what
I was thinking.
Yes, you could be sisters.
Well, at any rate
I thought you might join me in a glass of sulphur water.
I thought it might cement our relationship.
- Cheers.
- 'Auntie!'
Cheers.
Do you find her attractive?
The younger or the older?
The one you're looking at.
Does nothing escape those blue eyes?
I think you must be making fun of me.
I would never do that.
I think you're much more beautiful.
I'm curious as to why you say that.
Because anyone can see she's beautiful.
And very intelligent.
Yes, that's true, but I can't speak for anyone.
'And I must hold to my original impression'
'and say that being a student of human nature..'
[dramatic music]
...I would have to conclude that I hold to my original..
He's down to cancel his appointment?
I've been talking to myself. Good morning.
Would you take me to the
Valencia Hotel, please?
'Certainly, madam.'
Thank you.
[engine revving]
[no audio]
[dramatic music]
I've no need of a sentry, Mr. Schatz.
Listen to me, I know you're in trouble.
I know something is very wrong.
May I come in and, and talk to you?
I don't have the time.
[keys jingling]
I know you're in trouble.
I know something is very wrong.
I wanna help.
Please.
My husband..
...did have an affair.
'I can't forget it.'
'I keep thinking of it all the time.'
I can't cope with it sometimes.
But one has choices.
One can change the direction in which one is going.
'Well..'
I have one choice. My husband.
Teresa, your husband is dead.
Not to me.
[sighs]
Spend tomorrow with me.
And if not tomorrow, right now. Tonight.
You just embarrass me when you say things like that.
I'm saying what I feel.
Would you...would you care for a cigarette?
No.
Would you care for a kiss?
Yes.
[slow music]
[music continues]
Goodnight, Mrs. Neele.
Goodnight, Mr. Schatz.
[doorknob clicks]
'Would you recommend me to follow it for few days?'
Yes, I would do that.
Oh, what's that?
Good morning.
Howdy doody?
Ah, 10 o'clock.
Room 4. Here we are.
You can't come in here.
This is the ladies' section.
Ah, my name's Mr. Pettelson
This is my uncle, Mr. Jones.
'We're here for an appointment to see a Mrs. Braithwaite.'
No, that's not possible.
I'm Mrs. Braithwaite.
- This is the ladies only.
- There is no mistake, madam.
Mrs. Neele definitely made an appointment for me to have treatment here this morning.
- Is that right, Mrs. Neele?
- Why, hello, Mr. Jones.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Mrs. Neele.
You definitely arranged an appointment for me, didn't you?
I'm fearfully sorry. I didn't make an appointment for you.
- But this is room 4?
- Yes, this is room 4.
Then, this is where
I'm having my treatment.
Why don't you show them to the men's section.
- I'm not in any hurry.
- 'Problem solved.'
'Come along. Know where to go?'
'She definitely said room 4.'
'I'll show them. I won't be long, Mrs. Neele.'
[door shuts]
"Current in the main circuit is adjusted
"by means of the rheostats..
...R1 and R2."
I've only lost two pounds in four days.
I don't know why you're worrying about your weight a big strong girl like you.
Ladies, there's a gentleman waiting for you in the lobby.
That might be a friend from London.
Would you mind waiting upstairs for a minute?
I'm not going upstairs.
I'm simply here to look after your reputation.
'Good afternoon, ladies.
Good afternoon.'
Mrs. Ethel Proctor, delighted to finally meet you.
I've heard so much about you.
Good to see you.
And you are Miss Nancy Neele.
And even lovelier than
I had ever anticipated.
My name is Schatz.
Curtis Schatz Jr.
Won't you join me?
I believe we have mutual friends on the Isle of Manhattan.
'Neither my aunt nor myself have been to the Isle of Manhattan.'
Are you sure you haven't mistaken us for somebody else?
No, I'm quite positive on that score.
'Miss Neele..'
...a telephone call for you.
- Excuse me.
- Yes.
'You may take it here.'
May I say that your niece is a very nifty looking young lady.
Hello?
- 'Is that Miss Nancy Neele?'
- Yes, speaking.
- 'Mrs. Braithwaite..'
- Could you speak up, please?
Uh, yes, dear. I'm ringing on behalf of Mrs. Braithwaite.
We would like to ask if you'd cancel your appointment from 12:30 tomorrow morning and make it 9:30.
Does it have to be so early?
I'm awfully sorry, dear.
We've overbooked all over the place.
An elderly person came in at the last minute.
'Alright. It is very inconvenient'
'so if you do get a cancel..'
'Mrs. Neele.'
- Care for a little nip?
- That would be nice.
How long are you ladies planning on staying here in Harrogate?
I should think another week.
- That's strange.
- Who was it, dear?
The Royal Bath.
They've changed my appointment.
- That's alright, isn't it?
- Yes, I know.
But they are overbooked this time of year.
Don't be annoyed.
Let me persuade you--
I'm sorry, mister.
I'm going to my room. 露 And when I told them 露 露 How wonderful you are 露 露 They didn't believe me 露 露 They didn't believe me 露 露 Your lips, your eyes, your cheeks, your hair 露 露 Are in a class beyond compare 露
[piano music]
[no audio]
[music stops]
That was quite lovely,
Mrs. Neele.
Thank you very much,
Mr. Stanton.
You know what?
That's Agatha Christie.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- 'It is. I'm tellin' ya.'
[violin music]
[crackling]
 (Agatha)
 Horrible, isn't it?
 It's like the electric chair
 in the United States.
 (Mrs. Braithwaite)
 'I could think of
 one or two people'
 I wouldn't mind
 dispatching in that.
 (Agatha)
 Could this be lethal?
 (female #3)
 You'd have to know to
 put rheostat out of action
 wouldn't you,
 Mrs. Braithwaite?
[dramatic music]
[engine revving]
'Hello. Good morning,
Royal Baths.'
'I'd like to speak to Mrs. Braithwaite, please.'
'I'll put you through.'
'Hello?'
- Oh, hello. Mrs. Braithwaite?
- 'Yes.'
- It's Evelyn Crawley.
- 'Oh, hello.'
I'm flat on my back in agony.
Could you possibly come over to the hotel?
'Yeah, but, well, I just spoke to the booking clerk'
'and he said your other appointment had been cancelled.'
Miss Neele.
Miss Neele.
How've you been?
I tried phoning you at
The Valencia several times.
I haven't been able to reach you.
Mr. Schatz, I'm in a frightful hurry.
I'm late for my appointment with my aunt.
Yes, I was just wondering.
Are you staying here longer?
Well, why shouldn't
I stay here much longer?
It's a dull place.
I can't see how you could be having a good time.
Could I take you to dinner tonight?
Good morning, Mrs. Proctor.
Could I take you to dinner tonight, Miss Neele?
Miss Neele, it's very important.
- Good morning.
- 'Good morning.'
Miss Nancy Neele for Mrs. Braithwaite.
- Ah, yes. Room 4.
- Thank you.
Now, this goes down.
Up, across.
Oh, Mrs. Neele.
I'm very glad to see you.
Last time you were here, you left a little gold bracelet
I've got it in my room.
If you'd just come--
[women screaming]
Go away.
[screaming continues]
Stay calm, ladies.
I'm a doctor.
No need to panic.
Stay calm, ladies.
Miss Neele? I'm afraid I didn't make myself clear before.
I'm here on behalf of Colonel Christie.
What do you mean?
This isn't the place to discuss.
- Can we step outside?
- No, we can't!
- Colonel said--
- My hotel, one hour.
That's a promise.
I'll call you then.
No need to panic. I'm a doctor.
Stay calm, stay calm.
'Stay calm, ladies. No need to panic, I'm a doctor.'
No need to disturb yourselves.
I'm here on a private matter.
'This the way out?
No, it's not.'
Don't you think it's strange that--
[all talking together]
[dramatic music]
[music continues]
Sorry, sir. There's no answer from her room.
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes, sir.
- You're quite sure?
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, here you go.
- Thank you, sir.
Did a Mrs. Teresa Neele check out this morning?
No, sir, she hasn't yet.
...convinced she's Agatha calling herself Mrs. Neele.
So you see, it's not just my musicians.
'She's the fourth Agatha we've had this week.'
- 'Is she in the hotel?'
- 'No.'
'I'm going to search the room.'
Superintendent, may I compliment you on your work.
- 'Thank you. Your name, sir?'
- 'I'm Stanton.'
'Wally Stanton.
And your name is?'
- Superintendent MacDonald.'
- Is that M-A-C--
'Just as it sounds, uh.'
'Superintendent, I think now would be an opportune time'
'to do a future article on you, sir'
'and your extraordinary  ability to uncover rather--'
Now, excuse me. This is none of your business.
I most certainly will not excuse you nor Superintendent MacDonald.
How dare you force your way into my friend's room
- without a proper search--
- Excuse me?
Oh, you made me jump.
'It's alright, Flora.
You may continue.'
Did you burn these papers?
No! No, I didn't burn 'em.
'How long have you known this lady?'
Longer than anyone in this room, and that's sufficient for me to be concerned about her rights of privacy.
'He may not be aware of the fact, being foreigner that our most famous lady writers has disappeared.
'Oh, it's been in all the papers.'
'It's Agatha Christie, ain't it?'
'Yes, Flora, yes. Maybe'
'but we're not jumping to any conclusions.'
'I guessed it right from the start.'
'I told him.
I knew it were her.'
- 'I did.'
- 'Really?'
'I knew it was her.
Right from start I did.'
'I expected to find you flat on your back, Miss Crawley.'
I don't know what you're talking about, Mrs. Braithwaite?
You telephoned, and I've come straight across.
I didn't ask you to come.
Then how many Evelyn
Crawley's are there?
There's only one that I know of.
Do you know I'm a very busy women?
- She's right, she didn't.
- I beg your pardon?
[dramatic music]
[music continues]
[knocking on door]
'Come in.'
Mrs. Braithwaite?
[music continues]
Mrs. Braithwaite?
'She's not here.'
[music continues]
Excuse me, madam? Is there a Mrs. Neele about?
'You'll have to wait your turn, sir.'
'Would you mind turning the current off, please?'
Yes, of course.
- You'd like to wait--
- All I need is the room number.
- Room number four.
- And that is over here?
'Sir, you can't go in there.'
It's alright, I'm a doctor.
[dramatic music continues]
Where's number four?
Where's four?
It's the main switch on the right.
Where's four?
Where's four?
What is going on?
[dramatic music continues]
[women screaming]
Quickly.
Number four?
[screaming]
[screaming continues]
Oh, my God. Oh, my god, it's Mrs. Christie.
'It's Mrs. Christie!'
'It's Mrs. Christie!'
Shut the door!
[door closes]
Come on, come on.
Come back, come back.
Don't go away.
Don't go away, Agatha.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Breathe.
- 'Breathe.'
- She's dead.
'She's dead.
I know she's dead.'
'What are we going to do?'
Come on. Breathe.
Breathe, breathe.
Breathe, breathe.
[gasping]
Again.
Again.
Again.
[gasping]
Easy.
[coughs]
Alright.
Keep breathing, please.
Easy, easy...easy.
Take it in.
Anna, take it in.
Anna Agatha.
Good girl.
- 'Is there a back way?'
- 'Yes.'
'Yes, I think so.
I think there is.'
'Get a taxi. Get out!'
[mumbling]
- It's so silly, very silly.
- Very silly..
...but very clever.
[instrumental music]
Alright, right up there.
Pull over on the right.
[music continues]
Here.
Where are we?
Some hotel. I don't know the name of it.
You're a very bright man, Mr. Stanton.
They'll probably give you your own newspaper.
I could say half as bright as you, Mrs. Christie but I don't want to lie to you ever again.
What is going to happen to me?
What do you want to happen?
I wanted to die.
Why didn't you?
You stopped me.
No, you stopped yourself.
You took that past something, and you wanted to come back.
It had nothing to do with me nor anyone else.
I want my husband back.
Even now?
Yes.
[people shouting]
Make way. Clear the way, now.
Come on, let me through.
[shouting continues]
- Superintendant MacDonald.
- Thank you.
[people chattering]
'Agatha!'
We must talk.
Yes.
[church bell ringing]
[typewriter keys clacking]
[indistinct shouting]
'Colonel Christie, do you honestly expect us to believe'
'that your wife is suffering from amnesia?'
There's no other explanation.
She herself says she remembers nothing.
'Why can't we see your wife?'
'My wife is ill.'
An ordeal of this nature in front of an obviously hostile and antagonistic press.
'The press demands an open court. You must tell us.'
'Your wife registered using your secretary's surname.'
Can you tell us why, please?
I can only imagine that as
Miss Neele is a family friend..
Is it true that you and
Miss Neele are having an affair?
Another question, please?
How dare you?
It is disgraceful.
It is gutter press.
Now, please.
Gentleman in the front here would like to ask a question.
Colonel Christie, I would like to say one and only one thing.
Your conduct during these last few days and during this interview has been of infinite consistency.
It's clear to me and should be to my colleagues that you have been and are a devoted husband and I for one would like to congratulate you on having done one heck of a job.
[indistinct shouting]
Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
That is quite..
[knocking on door]
Yes.
Come in.
Hello, Mrs. Christie.
Hello.
I just came to say thank you.
Oh, yes?
For what you did for us.
'I mean, at the press conference.'
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for me.
'What do you mean?'
'Oh, I see. You didn't want anyone else to get the story.'
My gosh! You're going to be even more famous, Mr. Stanton.
I may not be as distinguished a writer as you, Mrs. Christie but even hacks have their standards.
- All well with the colonel?
- Yes.
Good show.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
'Will you forgive me?'
'There's no need to forgive you.'
'I was going to publish it, but I've changed my mind.'
'I can't.'
[slow music]
I didn't think that we'd meet again, but since we have perhaps I should say what's really on my mind.
What is really on your mind?
I think you know.
I think you know that I love you.
But you're going back to your husband.
Yes. I have to go back to my husband.
'I see.'
I've to go back to him because
I'm going to divorce him.
Why are you smiling?
I'm smiling because you are like you're books after all.
What do you mean?
Always a surprise ending.
I'd like to think I would have made you happy but I guess it was just bad timing.
Yes.
It would be nice to think that...we could meet again..
...sometime.
Yes.
I wish you well.
And you.
[indistinct chatter]
Can you make a statement?
[chatter continues]

You think I killed him?
I found him like this.
Just now.
You wait here comrade.
I'll go and phone for an ambulance.
Put him here.
An accident?
No, I don't think so.
There's no sign of any injury.
What happened to him?
I don't know, they found him lying in one of the parks unconcious.
Call the morgue.
Dead?
I'm dead?
It can't be.
I am alive!
Can't you tell i'm alive?

He was a journalist.
And whta do I put his cause of death?
Say cardiac arrest.
Say dead on arrival. And you want to print to make it more ledgible.
What's this, a new regulation?
A simple precaution so the
American press can't accuse us.
I said call the morgue.
But i'm alive!
You can't do this!
That's the lot.
An English trenchcoat, shorts, undershirt, socks, shirt that can be drip dried, pair of new slacks, wristwatch and a pair of high tops.
Real Cordoban.
Not too small for me either.
Shall I leave them out or not? You say so.
No, list them.
I don't want to lose my job for a pair of shoes.
It's strange.
He doesn't feel as cold as the others.
The medics moght have closed your eyes at least.
It's too late now.
Now in you go.
We seem to have more work.
Sure enough.
But he pay is the same.
This can't be real.
This must be a nightmare.
I don't feel a thing.
It ought to be cold in here.
What's happened to me?
Only my brain still function.
I have to remember.
Let's see...
I'm Greg.
Gregory Moore.
That I know.
But what else?
"Their association which was uncovered last week,
"was not an organised politcal movement,
"that has been avowed officially.
They espoused no political issue.
"They were followed because they held an occasional meeting
"to discuss conditions in the country"
End paragraph.
Jack, give him his hat.
"One of the party officials said those arrested last night
"were charged with publicly inventing
"governmental errors that led to failures
"and opened exploitation on an international scale."
New paragraph.
"No one arrested yet has been declared a prisoner.
"all are confined to a special mental asylum created supposedly
"for drastictreatment in a hopless case.
"Nothing specifically limits the treatment."
Add the byline.
Back to your gin rummy.
To a late defecter.
You'll defect if you don't cut off your intake of vodka.
I'll follow, sure i'll follow, but not til they carry you out.
They'll find you flat on your ass.
With too many women, it drains your energy.
It's a marvellous way to go.
I'm quitting early tonight.
I have a date with Mira.
A quick a way as any.
Here's a flash that looks worth sending.
An AP Stringer says that in Siberia, a new type of missile with a nuclear warhead was tested.
Are you spiking it?
I'll move it tomorrow.
If the Russians confirm it.
Might be a story.
Let me have the telex when you finished.
So long.
Covering the press conference at the hall tonight?
No, but if you want company
Jack will go with you.
Looking for women...
Sorry Jessica. I forgot about you.
- My dear Mira!
- I love you!
You've been following my letters or did you get another tea?
Yes, a new one every day.
I forgot.
Here.
- For me?
- With love.
I could hardly wait for you to come back
But even now we're together again i'm afraid.
Afraid you might leave suddenly.
What a thing to say!
Why would I leave all of a sudden?
When all i've waited for is to be with you for days and days?
I don't know.
But I always have this uneasy feeling when we meet, that it's only for a moment or two.
As if someone or something must come between us?
Maybe.
Sometimes, when I try to think what my life will be... a year or ten years from now, it's like... as if I were walking between two high walls.
They won't let me imagine anything or hope for anything.
That's when I feel I have to get away and come here to you.
Because you make me feel there's nothing to fear.
Almost all the way.
But finally he left me alone when he realised I meant it.
Excuse me? It's a special desert only in our restaurant.
Is it safe?
Don't worry, in emergencies i'm able to extinguish it.
You'd be sad to leave Prague?
Yes, in a way.
In spite of the oppression of the party, the average man manages to survive that... and keeps individualism alive.
And we found each other here.
What's the time?
It's four thirty.
We're out of cigarettes.
Your kiss tastes of apple.
Your present looks nice there.
Yes they are beautiful.
The species has one peculiar trait though: they have no instinct to fly.
In spite of their brilliant wings, they only know how to play on the ground.
We have lots of them you know.
You're adorable.
When is it you're going?
I don't know. Less than a month for sure.
- To Berlin?
- No London.
Means I go to a foreign country.
But can you smuggle me out of this one?
Don't worry about crossing the frontier, I already crossed the pond.
Valinski, he's pulling some strings.
Someway you're coming...
I'm moving you out of this place. I've paid the price.
Kind sir, i'm unable to repay the cost!
But if you allow me, i'll express my thanks in a manner more pleasant for us.
Alright.
That's Jack.
Greg...
Is all this for you really a simple thing?
No, but you're worth the trouble.
I'm beginning to remember.
Mira.
Hey you there, you hear me?
Is it like this for you too?
Maybe it's always like this when you're dead.
Now we can't go back to tell the others.
No, I mustn't give up.
If i'd gone into journalism instead of the police,
I would've had beautiful colleagues.
The commissaire has his police women.
That is true but they're not quite so pretty.
My vocation is banking.
It's a great game.
And our good comrade can put you into it, if you like.
No, thanks!
After all you just placed with state money.
I'd bankrupt it.
I'm sure these people are statues.
But where are they carved?
The exhibition includes some of the greatest personalities in middle Europe.
Politicians, bankers, black marketeers...
Interested?
No thanks.
He looks familiar, who is he?
Franz Thibor, the famous pianist.
- Good evening commissaire.
- Good evening.
This is Mira Svoboda.
I'd never have believed you were a compatriot.
Marx would've been most surprised.
Naturally you will be aware that
Gregory is about to leave us.
I want to take Mira with me to London.
I hope that your department won't keep us waiting.
Reporting for a woman... surely presents some problems for the men who'd like her job.
We're not disliked the principal reason is that we can open doors... which aren't open to male reporters.
Don't worry, mine will be open at all times.
Banks are such crowded places.
As Minister of the Interior...
I can give exclusive interviews, wouldn't you like that?
Yes of course.
Excuse me for a moment.
Let me introduce you to a few of my other guests.
They're all dying to meet you.
- Prof. Karting.
- Delighted to meet you.
Doctor Volonski, who of course you know by reputation and his equally well known wife professor Irina Volonskaia.
And this gentleman is Herr Forman, who's in love with you.
And of course you know Gregory.
Old friends aren't being noticed anymore?
- Ivan, how are you?
- I'm fine Greg.
What a surprise to see you!
Now miss Svoboda, if you'd like a drink.
Why didn't you tell me Greg was bringing that little baggage?
Jessica, Greg is a man.
Neither does woman live and breed alone.
You're not funny Jack.
Excuse me.
My dear Jessica.
I read your report on our economic agreement with the socialist republics.
It was very interesting.
But if you permit, I would like request you on one small point.
How's your revolution going Ivan?
Did it die at the Sorbonne?
No, it was in Moscow.
I was an intern 2 years in Moscow, i'm a specialist in cardiology now.
And the same fixations about naked girls?
The heart is big in our country, we're tops.
I work with Karting.
Pretty good.
I hope success doesn't go to your head too.
It better not.
I'd better rescue Mira from the body snatchers.
- You gotta meet her.
- I'll see you at the bar.
May I introduce you to another spectacular dame?
Come and say hello to Mira.
No, rgiht now my brain wouldn't act naturally.
Just like her.
Not that she's missing any of her essentials.
She's nice and solid here, a good face and blonde, I think.
The only thing about her I can't take is she's a millionaire's daughter, who thinks all her dollars can buy her raw meat.
In the circumstance.
Right here there's a rock, which records her physical impressions.
She loves to be bedded down with communist guys.
Cowboys who work on her ranch are going to learn all about the thrills behind the iron bed curtain.
Aren't they honey?
On the ranch, that's what turns me on.
She's so sweet and trusting!
What a delighful child don't you think?
Now our young people are beautiful today!
Please... make love with me
Right now.
Let's go back inside.
Just as a matter of record I wanted to see what a fool you are.
Wake up lover boy.
Get out of the sock now!
Get rid of your sex urges the same way I get rid of the alcohol.
Comrade Bashkov seems to have had a bad fall, 30 metres that is.
That's 100 feet to you.
He flattened some innocent passer-by in Verov Street.
Make it snappy.
- Well?
- False tip.
Bashkov the suicide is not the minister.
He's just Baskkov the grocer.
And a cuckold grocer besides.
Even chicken's in the frying pan are called political suicides here.
What a place!
And the photographers?
They folded up and went back in the night.
They told me to wait and fill you in on it.
I'm sure we met, I just can't remember where.
But she can speak!
You guyts are so fabulous! Why don't we go for a drink at my place.
Not tonight, i'm finished.
What about you?
Leave him alone, he's got better things to do.
Go ahead, back to Mira.
He's really groovy that cute friend of yours.
Waitress, where is the telephone please?
I'll be back in a minute.
Natasha!
So early to market?
Mr. Moore, i'll be late, to me it's not early
I'll pay you tomorrow.
Any time
Mira, where are you?
Ivan!
Thank god!
My old friend at the Sorbonne.
It's a pity.
Do you suspect anything specific?
All that's happened as far as I can make out doctor... was cardiac arrest.
Strange, there is no rigidity yet.
How long would you say he'd been dead?
He was already dead when they beoguht him.
A good three hours doctor.
Ivan, you've got to help me.
All the same I want to try something.
We might reanimate him.
If you beleive it comrade, prove it.
Move him upstairs.
Give me a hand.
Nothing, not in that one.
They said there's no record of them treating a young girl.
Then what could've happened to her Jessica?
It can't be very serious.
Just remember we called... all the hospitals all the police stations.
You're lucky... she's not in a morgue with a broken neck.
Better have a drink though.
That was an experience that almost finished me.
It's strange that she left no message for you.
Why would she just walk out like that?
She didn't just walk out, she was taken out.
Someone forced her to leave.
So she left with them, but she could've wanted to go.
Maybe she didn't intend to stay with her all the time.
And what if whe was only pretending with you?
Jessica don't talk nonsense, you didn't know her.
And you, what do you know about her?
We do not know anything
Gregory. Jessica's right.
So what?
For more than two hours, we've been making one guess after another without finding any reason why she disappeared.
I agree it's weird, the way she disappeared like that.
And yet i've known it to happen that someone suddenly decides to move out.
They leave... there's no warning, and no arguing.
They leave with no clothes on? Look at this!
She left her dresses.
Her shoes.
Everything she brought.
And these.
Bra, handbag, jewellry.
That is not sufficient proof.
When you say the girl was wearing nothing when she left.
In fact you mean she left this house without this underwear.
Or these.
Unless you are able to swear you know the exact contents... of the wardrobe brought by Miss Svoboda.
- I believe so.
- Believe?
And you say you left to cover a news story last night.
All the same, nothing occured of any importance last night.
It was a false report, now I see it was to get me out of the way.
Hey, why wouldn't that be a lead?
How were you notified?
The source was official?
An informer called.
They're never identified... though without them coverage in our business would be pretty poor.
Let me work on this case with you.
M. Moore...
We prefer to avoid all complications with foreign journalists in our work.
Don't interfere.
- Police will do the utmost in their power.
- Vraiment?
Let me say this to you...
They better or i'll write a story, and blast every one of you for murder!
Why did you say
"murder"?
I don't know.
Sorry.
As a reporter, i'm used to saying it.
Prepare the forms for the investiagtion.
At once, commissaire.
Yes, it's me.
Who's body?
She was found naked?
We'll come now.
The river embankment.
Wait here.
Foreign press.
Come on.
Show him the body.
It isn't her.
I wonder who this girl may be.
I'll tell Jessica.
As long as i'm here, i'll take some pictures.
We're wasting so much time.
If we could only find one person who knew her... or who knows that she's alive...
Another lover?
No, a lover is not what I meant.
Did she meet anyone through you?
No, not while she was with me because we were always alone.
She went to Valinski's.
I forgot that.
And several of Valinski's friends met her there.
One of them might have the answer.
We ought to question everyone.
It would be a help to establish just how many she talked to.
We'll start with Karting.
- You can make a list of everyone she talked to. - Is that all?!
Good afternoon, professor
Karting is expecting us.
I'll tell him you're here sir.
Alright gentlemen, now let's try it.
It reacts.
It's strange.
Human beings seperate all matter into classes.
The world isn't made that way.
Everything alive has its senses.
It's own vitality.
There's nothing wonderful about this tomato feeling just as sensitive... to pain as we do.
I think that could make a goof story.
Hurting a flower is a criminal act it seems.
It's not criminal, Ivan.
There are both good and evil in crime.
They're not seperate.
Don't be sentimental, go on, eat it.
After all, you can't hear it crying.
Excuse me professor, the two journalists are here to see you.
Show them in.
Yes, I love modern expressionists.
And I fear I had to break a few laws to get these into my possession.
My favourite journalist.
In what way can I be of help?
We're trying to trace
Miss Svoboda, Mira Svoboda.
Somehow or other she's disappeared and no one can explain it.
It's incredible.
Oh, that most attractive girl with you at Valinski's reception.
We hope that one of the persons that spoke to her might lead us to her.
The police tell us not to worry about it, they'll investigate it.
I'm sure they're reliable but...
You were the first she met last night and I saw her talk with you.
Can you tell me what she said.
Let me think a moment.
We talked about music.
Thibor's great success in
Berlin and Moscow principally.
She told me she planned to move from here and live in Moscow.
Really?
You didn't know about that.
Live in Moscow?
It's odd she wouldn't tell me that too.
But besides, she went without her documents.
If I were you I would not worry.
She will be alright, i'm sure.
I hope that you're right.
I'd hate to think that there was anything wrong.
Any reaction?
No, nothing.
Don't give up, Ivan.
Don't give up!
Let's put him on the experiment.
But he's been dead for too long, I don't there's anything we can do for him.
Don't listen to him Ivan.
You've got to save me!
His temperature hasn't gone down far enough. There must be a reason.
Let's bring in Karting.
Yes, hurry.
Karting will understand.
Meanwhile I have to keep remembering.
It's the only way
I can tell i'm alive.
- What'd they tell Jack?
- Nothing, no one can remember.
It's as if she never existed.
Well, is there anything new?
This, you begin to act dangerously being foreigners.
My advice was to wait and not interfere at all.
As an accredited reporter, in this case I must protest.
Your interference is going too far.
And what's this method you use? Are you suggesting that others should report... every last thing they said when they talked to this Mira Svoboda?
That's how to do it as you ought to know.
We want to help you, let's cooperate.
What do you expect. Girls disappear in a city like this all year round.
It is I who's duty it is to talk to the suspects and interrogate and not you.
Don't forget again.
They'll reprimand you, scare everybody away... and they'll write in you record you've been a fool.
You do as I tell you or you shall crawl on your knees in front of someone... a little bit higher than what you call a bureaucratic underling.
I might tell you, others have been equally surprised that... their press immunity to police arrest is suspended.
Think it over.
You were wrong to challenge Kierkoff.
Now he'll hinder instead of helping us.
I'm not afraid.
But you heard.
He said in this city girls disappear all year round so I want you to check on it.
You keep interviewing the others we listed, i'm counting on you.
Ok but, it'll help matters to keep cool.
- Where to lady?
- Kiliana 32.
You want me?
I want the last 2 years of
Rudé Právo from your file.
Here, I guess you prefer dollars?
Your guess is right.
- I need information.
- It's paid for.
Girls who've disappeared.
I like criminal stories.
All of them are memorised too.
I file them here.
I don't look in the official archives anymore, they don't keep even half.
Hello, i'm a journalist and i'd like some news on Marika Sequince.
Two years ago she was reported as missing.
I don't know anything.
Go away.
Are you her mother?
No, don't ask me anything.
It's all behind us now.
Her father and mother said she didn't take her clothes... and nothing was missing.
Tell him! Tell him!
Why don't you speak!
You're all cowards, that's what you are.
Well i'll tell him!
Shut up.
There is nothing to tell.
But was she related to you?
Marika was our daughter and she left us.
I don't remember any more.
And I won't be reminded either.
Get out of here!
Hey, you in the red shirt!
You know that old man?
You wanna earn this?
Then just give him this.
I have to thank you again.
If you hadn't driven me I would never have found my way out here on my own.
It does me good to get away from the office.
Although I do think you're on a wild goose chase.
You go ahead, i'll be watching the dogs.
- What are you doing in this house?
- My name is Moore.
Did you know Irina Dubcek?
Yes, once.
I am a journalist.
I'm doing a story on young girls who have disappeared.
A story...
I can't tell if you're friend or foe.
I am a friend.
But it doesn't matter.
I can only die once.
Death isn't far.
I told everything. I told everything, they can't ask for more.
And Irina?
Irina has left.
They forced her to serve them.
But who did she serve?
Is she alive or dead?
You have followed her in vain.
She is no more.
Is there anyone you suspect?
And who was it she served?
She was forced to.
All or youth must eventually be sacrificed...
Preserving those in power.
First they ask for the lives of our young soldiers.
Or a young student that protests that he must die.
Impassioned, they fall.
Yes, I have suspicions of my own.
But I can't fight it anymore.
You could, you could fight, if you are young.
You could still fight.
It's too late.
I've forsaken the dead.
All I can do is try to blot out the past.
Please.
Tell me what you know.
I have told everything there is to tell young man. There is nothing more.
I know nothing.
Now go.
Irina loved music, didn't she?
Yes, as most of her friends
They've been trying to get you from New York.
I told them that you were sick but that you'd be back later.
Finally!
I was beginning to wonder if we had to start looking for you aswell.
What did you find out?
I'm afriad there isn't much.
And I don't know who to ask anymore.
The only thing that is someone repeated that story of Moscow.
What story?
Didn't I tell you?
It seems that Mira had been talking of going to Moscow.
Anything new on those missing girls?
I did find out one thing. There's an old fella who might know alot.
Nothing else?
Well in every case of a missing girl...
I found an odd fact, they played chamber music.
You must be kidding, all that is a coincidence.
There are thousands that drink the same liquor as me or smoke the same tobacco.
Besides all that, I don't remember
Mira playing any music.
There are other coincidences.
Listen Greg, we're in a strange place.
And what surprises you here could be going on all the time.
It strikes some as strange, and others as normal.
Try to see it.
If you bow to it as much as I do then you won't have any bugs about it.
Take their position huh?
With my stubborn temperament?
It's my nature to oppose any resistance as long as force is used.
And with no explanations logical for it.
You can picture why i'm always in hot water.
Don't chase it Greg.
You're too involved as it is.
M Moore, this message came for you, a boy brought it.
It's from the old man, he says where he's supposed to meet him.
- Don't do it Greg.
- I have to go.
Mind telling me what the hell is going on?
You don't know who it's from, there's not even a man's name on it.
And you're going to this neighbourhood to meet a perfect stranger?
He crazy.
Look Jack.
I'm going with you.
No, because it says i've got to go alone. I'll see you both later.
Watch out!
Who did it?
Do you know him?
They don't fly...
Don't let them fly.
What do you mean?
Who? Tell me!
They don't fly...
Now what's happened?
What are you doing here?
I had a suspicion you'd end up in hot water.
What did you see?
In the dark I saw you go toward someone, maybe this old fella.
Then disappear into the smoke.
Then come running out a moment later like a scared rabbit.
Great, tell it to the police and they'll believe i'm a homicidal maniac.
Where are you off to now?
Leave me alone, don't follow me, I mean it.
Phase the oxygen to maximum.
The cardiac muscle isn't reacting to stimulus.
Yes, but still rigor mortis hasn't set in.
It is not rare for a cadaver to retain a certain flexibility after many hours.
There is still no sign of natural respiration.
His temperature however...
His temperature hasn't hurried, it has stayed around 32 degrees.
Even under refridgeration.
Some oxidation process must exist, perhaps at the muscular level.
But doctor, think how long his heart's been stopped.
It's biologically impossible for him to...
We're not engaged in an exact science.
The things we do not know... are far more numerous than the things we do.
You're right Karting.
This can't be real death.
Respiratory action nil.
Cardiac nil, encephalogram flat.
There's no indication of any activity at all.
But the scope is registering something, it's above zero.
That old man...
Who killed him?
Maybe they're the same that are trying to get rid of me?
Would you please help a pitiful old woman to cross the street.
Thank you, you're very kind.
God bless you.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Get out, you don't belong here.
I'm one of the club members.
You're a foreigner.
Get out!
Get out!
Foreigner!
Master, a non member is here.
A westerner.
How could you tell?
His shoes.
He ran through the hall.
We must find him.
Well Peter?
I looked all around.
I'll make another search.
You go on with your work.
Very well, master.
Let's hope he hasn't gone in there.
Lovely.
You never realised my thoughts about Mira.
Why'd I phone you that night? So you'd get out.
I opened your flat, broke her neck... to counteract the power she had over me.
Naturally I got rid of her body, by throwing it in the nearest sewer.
And that's not all,
I threw in a spare... when I had her round the house on Friday.
Go ahead, summon the police and then you can turn me in!
I hope that makes it perfectly clear, i'm sick of the whole thing.
It's a bore, I know it.
Everyone knows it.
Stop letting the police big you.
Let it drop.
Rest for a couple of days.
Otherwise the rest will be from heart failure.
Maybe you're right, heart failure.
I'll file your copy too, I can piece it together from my stuff.
Have you seen Jessica lately?
What?
Jessica? No.
She's been looking high and low for you.
Are you leaving?
Yes, I guess i'll go home and get some rest.
Take care Greg.
I wanted to ask you, have you ever heard the music recitals at the Club 99?
For the members, just to conceal that they're chronically bored to death
Everyone in there's a dead-head.
Old politicians, one or two illustrious actors, who play around with other things besides quartets.
Porcelain, petit pois, chess, provided it bores them. Why?
Nothing, I qualify alright.
Maybe there's an opening.
That'll put you to sleep, just what you need.
I can't take it any longer.
You referred ten minutes ago... to a club you've reason to fear.
What do you mean?
Who are you?
My name is Pravski.
Koparal Pravski.
Good evening, M. Moore.
But please, have I offended you M. Moore?
How did you get in my apartment?
What are you here for?
I want to tell you that someone is watching your house.
He's down there right now.
It's one of their police stooges.
They must suspect you Greg.
You should never have questioned anyone. I'm sure Kierkoff's behind it.
It's the murder of Marika's father.
I'm sure he'll say that you're the one who caused it.
You'd better go back to London.
I certainly could use a vacation.
I've a permit that'll place you on a priority flight.
If you want, i'll come with you.
We both want a vacation.
Now more than ever.
Give me the maximum.
Syringe.
No, Ivan!
Patter!
Don't stop!
Don't give up!
I'm very sorry.
Your friend?
I met him years ago when I studied in Paris.
Ivan's deserted me too.
For them i'm not one of the living anymore.
But if you like i will perform the autopsy.
I don't believe it's necessary.
I'd like to find out why there was never any sign of rigor mortis in him.
You make the arrangements then.
Or perhaps...
I could perform it tomorrow during my lecture on anatomy.
I know i'm not being fair to you Jessica.
Too many memories.
It has absolutely nothing to do with you.
I really can't understand why you persist in your fixation, and I can't see why you let that girl haunt you, or why this place should hang you up.
And the part that beats me is how you could care for someone like her!
What do you mean 'like her'?
You never even knew her.
You have no idea!
She cared about you?
In a pig's eye she did!
- She wasn't able to.
- Shut up!
She belonged to another world, a different kind.
It's no use looking in every sewer in town.
You're never going to see her again.
I know you don't believe a thing
I say. She was just a little bitch.
It's mis-spent passion.
Now I shall go before they carry you of to jail.
Or worse.
My apologies.
I know i'm to blame.
Yes, they are beautiful.
The species has one peculiar trait though...
They haven't any instinct at all to fly.
In spite of their brilliant wings, they only know how to play on the ground.
They don''t fly...
Don't let them fly.
I've just been talking with that blind man you know.
He's working across with a lowdown on that club.
You didn't know they had branches in Paris, London, New York, Tokyo.
There are plenty of other things.
In these clubs they use too many tropical flowers.
Isn't it odd?
And in black magic, the number 99 signifies
"amen", "finished".
How dhould I know, you think it's a coincidence?
No no, it's not a coincidence.
I also found what I was looking for.
The connection with the girls who disappeared in Munich was... a hell of a lot more than music.
Look for me.
I'm outside here.
Yeah, at the club, at the corner of the plaza in a phone booth.
From where I watch i've seen a lot tonight.
They go in the club but there's no concert on the programme.
Why don't we go in and look around, and bring that card with you.
I'm coming right over.
Don't you move.
Well hurry up chum.
That figure...
It was a butterfly!
Are you there?
Jack, is that you?
I saw human beings drinking rain...
and their huge bellies swelling and bursting.
Spurting out money, red rain
rain of god.
Why don't you let
butterflies
 with gaily coloured wings
fly free
in the clear skies?
Why don't you let
butterflies
 with gaily coloured wings
fly free
in the clear skies?
I though I was dreaming
and I washed my face
and the water was as red as blood.
My blood.
I wanted to fly away
in the clear sky
But they cut my wings.
You don't expect us to believe that?
Your comrade's an alcoholic and not responsible for what he says.
So stop claiming phantoms are trying to get rid of you.
And unless you obey, you'll go to prison.
I know you're a drug addict.
We found a tube in your house.
We're having in analysed now.
It contained morphine didn't it.
We know that both you and the girl took drugs.
Obviously yoou injected her with an overdose.
She died because of you.
Now follow carefully my solution.
Establish in your confession that is all took place as I say, and you will stand trial.
But for accidental death.
In that way I can be lenient.
I will find extenuating circumstances and you can leave the country.
The club...
The butterflies...
I must go back there.
I feel cold.
I feel cold.
I gonna look inside, the club.
I'm afraid.
I can't think.
Precisely.
I'l refer this case to a mental facility for advanced electro-shock therapy.
He's only tired.
I'll take care of him.
With your approval.
Gregory, i'll drag you home.
It's Valinski.
You know me don't you?
I have to get in there.
I must do it.
Tonight.
I have to.
In your position,
I advise you to get some rest.
You're tired.
And I am the director.
If you had asked me,
I could easily have showed you our club.
Call me up tomorrow.
I have to see Mira.
Faster.
I have to go there tonight.
Don't get upset.
I must take you home now.
Don't worry now.
You will be alright.
Open up!
Open up, it's the police!
Open I say!
You can't consider this case closed.
Mira Svoboda was killed by her lover.
The American journalist,
Gregory Moore.
And your colleague also killed another one of you.
He stabbed to death
Jack MacPherson in a telephone booth.
We found his handkerchief beside the body.
We have definite proof that Moore suffered from a persecution mania.
And recently exhibited frequent states of deep psychic derangement.
It was in one of those seizures that he was driven to kill his young fiancee, whose disappearance he reported himself.
But he had to kill your colleague because he had found incontravertable proof of his guilt.
Professer Karting, thinks the autopsy...
Surely he can't have been crazy.
Not Greg.
That's not Mira.
Mira was a rebel.
She refused sex and gold.
And everybody here was lured with them.
We used them for bait the whole world over.
They're important becuase they suppress the will to resist.
She is sleeping know.
You will follow her in your turn.
Unwanted visitors the sabbath broom get gets rid of them.
The oldest persons beat the drum.
And the youngest go to battle.
We will hold the reigns of power in the world as long as there are people willing to be killed, willing to shed their own blood.
Nothing must be changed.
Our bitterest enemies are persons that love freedom.
That is why we always have them removed. We destroy them!
We must enslave the free to preserve our powers.
We need the young to keep us alive.
They must become like us, they must think as we do.
Those who rebel must be sacrificed.
Catalepsy...
They will find your body and declare you dead.
Your mind will work after it is buried, but by that time it is gone mad.
After it is buried.
There's something in my heart.
That's my heartbeat!
My heart is beating again!
Don't you hear it?
My heart is trying to beat!
But my heart is beating.
They must be able to realise that.
We shall take advantage of this autopsy, to demonstrate the errors that could occur in an operation on the heart if it is not performed with the greatest precision.
In all operations in the cardiac cavity the surgeons technique is of the utmost importance.
Therefore I beg you to observe this lesson with the closest attention.
Gloves please.
Now then, first, an incision between the
4th and 5th rib is marked.
That will be the area of the left unular.
It is a delicate area requiring special technique.
Close the shutters please.
Remember, the merest error or wrong movement could irreparably damage the organ and cause death.
Pay close attention.
Lights please.
Karting!
I shall proceed.
You must poise this scalpel in the intercostal space
Then make a quick and precise thrust.
Like this.

Why don't you wear a bra?
Why should I?
You shouldn't go around without one and not expect that type to stare.
Look... if you could hammer a nail, Venner and Scutt wouldn't be out there.
Listen, Amy, uh... fixing the toaster and getting the garage built... is not exactly the reason
I came here in the first place.
Are you saying you'd be happier if we hadn't left?
We left because
I got a grant to do work... which I haven't found the time to do.
You left because... you didn't want to take a stand, commit.
Commit to what?
Huh?
I was involved with my work.
You want something out of me that is not right to deliver.
That's not what I was there for.
But I know why you're here.
Why?
Could it be because there's no place else to hide?
I'm here because you once said... y-you thought we could be happier here.
Remember?
I'm sorry.
Are you sorry sorry, or just sorry?
Sorry sorry.
Then come here.
I'm gonna take a bath.
Why?
You don't need one.

I'll take it.

Yes, indeed.

You're a scientist.
Can you deny the responsibility?
Can you?

God is not my problem.
- Your wife tells me you play an interesting game of chess.
- Yeah, I guess I do.
You were... awful to the reverend.
No, no, no, no.
I wasn't.
He's all right.
I like him.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
His wife is very attractive.
Oh.
Yes, she is, isn't she?
[ Moaning ]
- Here, I think I--
I think you need some help.
- [ Both Laughing ]
- David.
- Hmm?
What's a binary number?
Uh, zeroes or ones... plus or minus.
In sequences of twos.
- Hey, that's right.
- [ Giggles ]
You're a bright lady.
[ Chuckles ]
You're not so dumb.
Sometimes I need help.
When?
Like, um, now, maybe.
You got it.
What's the matter?
[ Whimpering ]
Scutt or Cawsey.
I've locked all the doors and windows downstairs.
Let's keep them locked from now on. All right?
Great.
Did you hear me?
What?
Scutt or Cawsey.
- Why?
- To prove to you they could get into your bedroom.
I don't believe that.
Well, who else is around all the time?
Amy, uh... we've left all... the doors unlocked.
I mean, it could have been anybody passing.
- ''Anybody passing''?
- [ Winding ]
David, a complete stranger comes into our house... and decides to strangle our cat and hang her in the wardrobe?
-Somebody passing?
-[ Winding Mechanism Breaks ]
Cawsey or Scutt.
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.
[ Charlie ]
Lousy way to make a livin; though.
You gonna look at them all day?
Would you feel better if I went out and talked to them?
Not necessarily.
Perhaps we could just pack up and leave.
Nobody's leaving.
Why? Because we paid for a year?
Look, Amy,
I'm not going to... just go out there and blatantly accuse them.
You don't have to accuse them.
You could start by mentioning that our cat was strangled and see what happens.
[ Men Continue Conversing,
Indistinct ]
You can believe in the possibility, can't you?
Okay. Okay.
I'll go out and mention to them that the cat is missing... and I'll ask them if they've seen her.
[ Hammering ]
[ Cawsey ] All right, let's see what it's good for.
- You don't think that's enough, do you?
- Not quite.
Perhaps you'd like to write them a note on your blackboard.
[ Cawsey ]
Well, I thought he might enjoy it.
[ Men Laughing ]
[ Crash ]
-[ David ] How are you?
-[ Cawsey ] Fine, thank you, sir.
- How's it, uh, going up there?
- It's all right, sir.
Yeah. Want a smoke?
I like the smell of those
American cigarettes, Mr. Sumner.
[ Conversation Continues, Faint ]
Can you give me a hand with that mantrap? Just wanna get it in the house.
[ Chattering, Laughing ]
[ Door Opens ]
[ David ]
Uh, right through here.
Right here by the fireplace.
Thanks.
Amy, listen.
I'm gonna catch them off guard.
- When?
- Right now.
[ Charlie ]
Open or closed, Mr. Sumner?
Uh, gee, I don't know.
Uh, open it.
If you can.
[ Chuckles ]
Sorry, Charlie.
Bite, sir.
[ David ]
I can appreciate that.
[ David ]
Be careful.
Watch that hand on the spring.
[ Cawsey ]
Pretty dangerous thing, sir.
- This is the, uh, safety lock, sir.
- Right.
Where would you like it, sir?
Uh, put it right over the fireplace there.
You fellows like some beer?
-[ Cawsey ] Very nice.
- Oh, very welcome.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Uh, cheers, miss.
Cheers.
-[ Charlie ] Mr. Sumner.
- Huh?
Would you like to shoot with us sometime?
Oh, I've, uh--
I never hunted much.
Oh, but you've, uh, shot, Mr. Sumner?
Just once or twice, but that was--
[ Charlie ] Be easy then.
You should try it, sir.
Living here at Trencher's, with good shootin'outside the door. Eh, Norman?
Right. Right, sir.
When?
[ Charlie ]
How about tomorrow, sir?
Okay. Thank you.
That m-- That might be... fun.
I'd like that.
Thank you.
What about the garage?
It can wait.
We'll meet at Wakely at about half past 8:00.
- You know the pub?
- Yes, I do.
Well, we'd better get back to work, sir.
Thank you for putting that up.
[ Scutt ]
That's all right, sir.
Oh, I, uh,
I don't have a gun.
But, uh-- [ Chuckles ] will this do?
[ Giggles ] Ah.
There'll be plenty extra, sir.
Good.
- Thank you for the drink, sir.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for the drink, sir.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
[ Men Conversing, Faint ]
[ Laughing, Conversation Continues ]
[ Door Opens ]
[ Laughing, Conversation Continues ]
[ Cawsey ] Hey, Charlie, Charlie.
Wait, wait, wait.
[ Conversation Continues, Faint ]
Break it, Mr. Sumner.
- Why? It's not loaded.
- Break it.
Now you're sure.
Uh, this'll be you right over here, Mr. Sumner.
Right.
Now, here's your sack.
We'll beat the ducks right to ya.
- Small, they are.
- Yeah.
We don't want it broken up with shot unless you have to.
But, uh, if-- if you can't catch 'em... shoot 'em.
They might come right down here, sir.
- Or they might come from behind as well, sir.
- But I don't move?
Stay as still as you can be, sir.
Now, we'll be spread about.
If you need us,just call.
You do that.
Here's your sack, Norman.
- You drive 'em to me, Charlie.
- I will.
Uh, good luck, sir.
Might be a little while, sir.
I'll be here.
[ Shotgun Blasts ]
[ Knocking ]
Who is it?
[ Knocking ]
Is David all right?
He's fine.
Enjoying himself.
May I come in?
All right.
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.
[ Door Closes, Lock Engages ]
[ Liquor Pours ]
Would you like me to go?
I will, you know.
No.
Stay and have your drink.
I'd like to know what you think of cats.
I'd like to know what you think of cats.
I do fancy cats.
Please leave me.
No.
Get out!
Don't tease me, Amy.
Please.
Aah! Aah!
No!
[ Gasping ] Aah!
[ Whimpering ]
[ Groaning, Sobbing ]
[ Panting ]
No.
Please, Charlie.
Amy.
I don't want to reave you, but I will.
[ Amy Continues Panting ]
[ Whimpers ]
No.

- No. No.
No! No!
No!
No!
[ Sobbing ]
No.
[ Panting ]
Amy!
[ Whimpering ]

I'm sorry.
Hold me.
Hold me.

[ Grunting ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Gasping Continues ]
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
Why didn't you open the closet?
We don't have any more cats.
I'm firing Venner and Scutt tomorrow.
Hooray for you, tiger.
What for?
Because they stuck it to me on the moor today.
They also serve who sit at home and wait.
What?
Nothing. If you'd have said something to them ages ago...
-about the cat, this would never have happened.
- Easy.
- None of it.
- Easy, easy.
I was going to say something until you pulled that childish stunt... and ruined any chance
I had of finding out.
- David, I didn't--
- I didn't finish.
- You pushed me, and you don't do any good by pushing.
- I didn't.
When are you ever gonna learn about growing up, huh?
I'm trying to.
Well, you're a little late.
Why didn't you ask him instead of making me look like an idiot with that bowl of milk?
You're a coward.
- No, I'm not.
-And I'm a coward.
Plain and simple.
No, I'm not.
I don't blame you for hiding in your study.
I don't--
I don't want to hide there with you.
I-- I can't anymore.
Okay.
Easy, easy, easy.
- You're fired, all of you.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
I've noted the hours that you've worked... and I've deducted... the-the time wasted.
- Here. It's all here.
- Why, sir? Why are we fired?
We may not work the way you like to work, sir--
- Listen to me.
-[ Cawsey ] Sir, I mean, why?
You're fired because I don't want you around. I want you to leave. Right now.
- Is that clear?
- We've been working all the time, sir.
Clear enough, sir.
[ Chattering ]
[ Chattering ]
[ Chattering Continues ]
- Norman.
- Huh?
That's a nice way to treat people.
[ Wings Fluttering ]
We're due at the church hall at 8:00.
[ Toot Toot ]
[ Major ] I'd like you to meet Amy and David Sumner.
- Hello. Nice to meet you. My husband.
- Hello, Mr. Sumner.
Hello, Amy.
Nice of you to come.
I'll show you to your seats.
Hello, Reverend.
How have you been?
[ Horns Blaring ]
- Please sit here.
- Thank you.
- I think she'll be able to see okay from here.
- That's fine.
Would you care for a drink?
All right. Thank you.
I hope you enjoy the show.
Thank you.
Be brave.
-dd[ Fanfare ]
- Evening, ladies and gentlemen... and welcome to our annual social gathering.
It's nice to see again all the old familiar faces.
And the not-so-old, indeed, as well.
To begin the evening, we have our very own Reverend Barnard Hood.
Your vicar, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for my famous newspaper trick.
Tore it up last year, Barny!
Yes, and I might well next year, too, Tom.
[ Chuckling ]
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen-- a very simple trick.
I simply tear a piece of newspaper down the center so.
Tear it again.
Fold it towards me.
Music, please.
Open it up very carefully.
Tear it again.
There we are.
Roll it towards me again.
- You enjoy this, Mrs.Johnson?
- Yes, Vicar.
It is a good trick, isn't it? I do it in front of the mirror every night.
And we begin to open up.
- I always enjoy doing this.
It gives me a chance to...
- Hello, David. catch up with my reading.
Hi.
You want a smoke?
[ Barny ] And I find that it hasn't been torn at all.
- No.
- What?
- Don't smoke in here.
And you'll also find that that one isn't torn either.
-[ People Applauding ]
-Sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.
But I think you'll probably find that... it hasn't been torn at all.
[ People Laughing ]
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello.
I'd like to go for a walk.
- Will you take my arm?
- [ Barny ] Now, ladies and gentlemen... for my piece de resistance...
I now present to you an empty glass.
I am now going to fill this glass with milk.
Would it work better with whiskey, vicar?
- Nothing works better with whiskey.
- I do.
You've never worked in your life, Tom.
[ Men Laughing ]
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take the lid off my cocoa tin.
And very carefully now,
I place the glass... into the tin and replace the lid.
I take up my wand and I utter the magic words--
[ Gibberish ]
What do we find in the tin... but one complete... glass of milk.
- [ Men ] Yea.!
- Good old Barny!
[ Barny ] If I could convert you to this, Tom, that would be a miracle.
[ Men Chuckling ]
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Major.
[ Major ]
The next item on this evening's program, ladies and gentlemen...
- You want to go?
- Yeah.
...who will sing for you the aria
Caranome from the opera Rigoletto. dd dd[ Woman Singing In Italian ]
[ Giggling ] dd [ Continues ]
Dad?
It's Janice.
She made off to the yard.
Then she went walking with Henry Niles.
He was holding her, Dad.
Touching her.
[ Tom ]
John Niles.
What's the matter, Tom?
Come with me.
[ Engine Cranking ]
All over her, he was.
Touching her.
- [ Engine Cranking ]
- Had his hands all over her.
Don't be afraid, Henry.
- I'll find him.
- No.
Let the boys find Janice.
The rest can wait.
[ Engine Cranking ]
Have you ever kissed anyone, Henry?
No.
Get your mates to find her. I'll be waiting in the pub. Get all of them!
Would you like to kiss me?
[ Engine Starts ]
[ Bell Tolling ]
Go on. Find him!
[ Barny ]
Would you now all please stand?
[ Bell Continues Tolling ]
As these lights are extinguished in our eyes... and also in the presence of God, the Blessed Virgin... and all the saints--
[ Bell Continues Tolling ]
Deliver unto the devil a punishment with eternal fire.
Dwell without him... unless ye repent.
-[ Bobby ]Janice?
-[ Boy ]Janice.!
- Amen.
- [ All ] Amen.
- I have to go.
- No. No, they might hurt you.
-[ Bobby ]Janice.!
-[ Man ] Come here.!
- [ Bobby ] Where are you,Janice?
- [ Man ] Henry.!
[ Bobby ]
Janice.!
We don't know where she is.
We looked the whole town!
- Keep looking.
- The fog's coming down.
Did you try the lorries and such, parked outside the meeting house?
- Then do it!
- I'll go with him, Pa.
-[ Bobby ]Janice?
-[ Boy ]Janice.!
Janice.!
[ David ]
We're almost home now.
Can I help?
- David!
- [ Tires Screech ]
Jesus! I couldn't stop.
- Oh, God, David.!
- Easy.
Okay. Get the keys.
Easy. Easy.
- [ Knock On Door ]
- [ Amy ]
David,you know it's Henry Niles?
I don't want him here.
He's hurt.
I don't want him in my house.
Fine. You get upstairs.
You go to bed.
Take a bath.
You just get out of here.
He'll stay until the doctor comes.
What do you mean, you don't want him in your house?
- David, did you get anyone?
- No.!
I tried the doctor. He's not home, and the consul's not either.
Nobody answers.
I'm calling the pub.
[ Phone Ringing ]
- Wakely Arms.
- Hello, this is David Sumner.
No. No, he ain't.
Oh. Well, when he comes in, tell him to call Trencher's Farm.
I've got Henry Niles here.
Right.
It was the American, looking for Allsopp.
He hit Henry Niles with his car.
He's got him up at Trencher's.
Bottle.
And another.
Let Norman and me go in, Tom.
We know the American.
- I want to know where myJanice is.
- We'll find out, Tom.
Riddaway will stay with you, Tom.
That I will.
[ Niles Mumbles ]
[ Pounding On Door ]
- You have Henry Niles in there?
- Wait a minute. Is the doctor with you?
- We want to see Niles.
- Why? What's the matter?
Wake up!
- Wake up!
- Don't try to kid us you're sleeping. Come on.!
- Hey, wait a minute, now.
- Come on! Come on!
He's hurt.
He could have a broken rib.
Oh. Sorry, sir.
He'll have more than a broken rib if he doesn't tell us whereJanice Hedden is.
- What aboutJanice Hedden?
- Took her, he did.
What have you done with Janice Hedden, you dirty pervert?
Lookee here. He played his filthy tricks on Janice Hedden.
He took her, and he was seen with his hands on her body.
She run, he run after her, and now she's missing.
- Look, I understand your concern--
- You--
Don't touch him!
Don't do that.
Don't lay your hands on me!
It's none of your business, and it never has been.
That's fine.
But you can't hit him.
Listen, Mr. Sumner... we come to get this bloody freak.
And we're gonna get him... with your cooperation or without it.
David, stop it.!
[ Giggling ]
Hey, listen.
Listen, Henry, did you see
Janice Hedden tonight?
Of course he did. Ain't you listenin' to me? He did his dirty numbers on her.
Just take it easy.
Henry, listen to me.
Did you takeJanice Hedden out of the meeting house tonight? Huh?
Listen to me. Please.
Gentlemen, he's helpless.
Look at him. He couldn't hurt a fly.
You'd be better off looking for
Janice Hedden than standing around here.
You know?
All right. We go find Janice, you go find the doctor.
I'm not leaving him here with my wife.
- Thought you said he was helpless.
- Yeah.
You wouldn't leave him alone with your wife or your kid, if you had one.
Oh, that's different, huh?
Look-- Look, fella.
He's staying here with me until the doctor and the police arrive.
- He's my responsibility.
- Your responsibility?
- That's right.
- Why?
This is my house.
Okay, come on.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
[ Amy ]
The police'll be here soon.
What did the bastard say?
Didn't talk.
Well, why didn't you make him?
That's what you went in there for!
-Uh, David--
-Why don't you just go make some coffee?
I want that Niles.!
I'm goin'in.
- Please, David. Stop them.
- Don't worry.
Solid. They can't break in.
I know how they feel.
I'd feel the same way if it was my kid that was missing.
Amy, go to bed, huh? Go on.
I can handle this.
You give me that Niles!
Hey! Hey, cut it out!
Listen to me. If you don't stop now, so help me God I'll press charges!
[ Man Giggling ]
Okay, you've had your fun.
I'll give you one more chance.
And if you don't clear out now, there'll be real trouble. I mean it.
[ Footsteps Retreating ]
- Chris.!
- Come on. They're gonna cooperate now.
Just go on upstairs.
Don't worry.
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna fix the window.
[ Bicycle Horn Tooting ]
[ Tooting Continues ]
- Do you think we ought to clear off, Norman?
- Why?
We'll get that Niles.
I tell you we will.
- Well, why stop then?
-[ Tooting ]
[ Giggling ]
He's got no right to live, an animal like that.
Tom, I'll run 'round,
I'll slip in the window... and get that Niles out quick as a flash.
Uh, the rest of you, kick up a row.
Hey.!
What the hell is wrong with you people?
[ Riddaway ] It's that snipe we're after, Mr. Sumner.
- I said stay down!
- I want the lavvy.
Come on.
Look, you stupid Yank.
Let's have Niles before someone gets hurt!
Come on. Up you go.
[ Tom ] I've had to put up with a lot in my time.
-[ Glass Shattering ]
-[ Amy ] You can't leave him in there.
[ Tom ]
But I draw the line at this place.
- [ Glass Shattering ]
- [ Amy ] No.!
I'll have an answer, or I'll have blood!
- Where are you going?
- [ Glass Shattering ]
Give Niles to them.
That's what they want.
They just want him.
Give them Niles, David!
- They'll beat him to death.
- I don't care.
[ Tom ] You send him out, or your whole house will be--
Get him out!
You really don't care, do you?
No, I don't.
[ Charlie ]
Cawsey.!
Come here.!
[ Shouts, Faint ]
There's more whiskey in the lorry.!
No. I care.
This is where I live.
This is me.
I will not allow violence against this house.
[ Pounding ]
Don't worry.
-[ Glass Shatters ]
- Go on upstairs.
-[ Man ] Beautiful.!
- Please don't leave me.
Just do as you're told.
[ Cawsey Giggling ]
Get out of there!
-[ Pounding On Door ]
- David? It's me, Major Scott.
[ Pounding Continues ]
- Come on.
- Thank you.
I see you finally got through the enemy lines.
Don't worry about that.
I'll tell them to clear off.
Sorry I didn't get here earlier.
Yeah, I am too.
They're breaking all my windows.
David,Janice Hedden is missing.
Tom is out of his mind with worry.
They're drunk out there.
I know that, but you're the law here.

- I'll deal with them.
- dd[ Singing Continues ]
- David!
- Lots more where they came from.
Well, Tom,you're being a bit stupid, aren't you?
Chucking things through people's windows. You ought to have more sense.
You tell him I want that Niles or I'll come in and get him!
You give me that bloody gun and get the hell out of here. That's an order.
What about myJanice?
It weren't one of yours.
- He took myJanice.
- Listen, Tom.
We don't want any trouble here, do we?
There wouldn't have been any trouble if you'd put Henry Niles away.
You wanted to put my Emma away soon enough!
Damn you, Hedden.
Give me that gun.
Damn you, Major.
Let go!
[ Screaming ]
- David!
- Bastards!
Bastards.!
You bastards!
David, phone! Phone anybody!
Please, phone somebody!
David!
Phone!
- No calls tonight.
- It's dead.
Get the lights. Go on.
I didn't reckon on nobody gettin' killed, Norman.
Yeah, well, that's too bad.
We're all in it now.
- Accessories, we are.
- That's the law.
Henry Niles!
I'm gonna keep them out of this house.
Please! Listen to me!
- Come on!
- Shut your mouth. Shut it.
I can hold them off. Don't worry.
Someone will show up.
-[ Glass Shattering ]
- David!
- Cut it out!
Like Major Scott?
David, how are you gonna keep them out?
- I can keep them out.
- How? There are five men out there.
- I know that.
- They have a gun!
- [ Crashing ]
- I know they have.
- Honey, I know what I'm doing.
- Goddamn you, David!
- If you don't give them Niles, I will!
- Oh, no, you don't.
[ Glass Shatters ]
[ Cawsey ]
We're gonna blast your windows.!
This is my affair.
The lights.
Go upstairs and turn on all the lights.
They won't be able to see me, but I'll be able to see them. Go ahead.
No.
No, I won't.
Go.
Goddamn you! Move!

[ Cawsey Continues Giggling ]
What are you gonna do on your own?
Do we have any rope? Huh?
I'm talking to you.
Do we have any rope?
No.
I suggest... you get out of the way of the windows.
I also suggest that you turn the rest of the lights on upstairs.
- Do we have any wire?

Let me go.
Go. Go.
Go on.
No! Aah!

You've got more cartridges, Tom.
Enough for all of them.!
- It's just Niles.
- Listen--
He can't shoot through that door.
Ya dirty Yank bastard.!
Listen to me.
You know what happens if they get in now? They'll kill us all.
They've gone too far to back down now.
You understand that?
We're dead if they get in.
Thank you, sweetheart. Stay.

{99157}{99248}Aborigines believe|in two forms of time--

{99682}{99755}more real than reality itself.
{99789}{99846}Whatever happens|in the Dreamtime...
{99849}{100005}establishes the values, symbols|and laws of Aboriginal society.
{100008}{100132}Some people of unusual spiritual powers|have contact with the Dreamtime.
{100135}{100210}How ?
{100213}{100270}Through their dreams.
{100273}{100394}Through ceremonies involving|sacred objects... like these stones.
{100515}{100572}What is the name of that spirit ?
{100575}{100657}Ah. Its name is one|of the few words recorded...
{100660}{100717}from a tribe|once active in Sydney.

{100914}{100999}Mulkurul.

{101134}{101219}bringing sacred objects|with them...
{101222}{101295}like these stones.
{101298}{101355}This tribe believed...
{101358}{101511}that the Mulkurul expressed|themselves through people|of unusual spiritual power.
{101514}{101571}You mean,|they´re sometimes human ?
{101574}{101657}Yes, the local belief was|that they acted through humans.

{101766}{101857}Frankly, I don´t think that|any of us has the spiritual powers...

{102210}{102277}when nature has to renew itself.

{126634}{126737}Man On adio ...has been falling|in most parts of the Sydney area today.
{126740}{126845}Now, opinion around town seems|to favor the pollution theory,

{126936}{127013}I took the liberty|of checking with the CSIO,

{130436}{130501}Oh, David !
{130702}{130759}Listen, darling...
{130825}{130971}I want you to take the children|and go away.
{130974}{131050}Go away from the city.
{131053}{131138}Do you understand ?
{131330}{131414}But what is it ?
{131417}{131520}I, I don´t know yet.
{131586}{131646}But I´m frightened, Annie.
{131809}{131898}The accused,|in a state of intoxication,
{131901}{131987}attacked and killed Billy Corman.
{131990}{132083}Now,you mustn´t permit|the sorry history of conflict...
{132086}{132202}between the Aboriginal and European|cultures to cloud your judgment.
{132205}{132323}Your verdict must not in any way|reflect the sympathy we all feel...
{132326}{132456}for the few unhappy survivors of|the original inhabitants of this land...
{132459}{132568}who operated, until the arrival|of the white man,
{132571}{132648}under a system of tribal laws.
{132651}{132761}Your verdict must be based upon|the law as it prevails today...
{132764}{132888}over and for the protection|of all Australians.
{132891}{132992}And the accused,|in killing Billy Corman,
{132995}{133102}broke that most sacred|law of all.
{133152}{133274}The entry into the lungs of quite|a small quantity of fresh water...
{133277}{133345}can kill a person|in a matter of seconds.
{133348}{133475}The same quantity of seawater|would often not be lethal.
{133478}{133603}Would you describe the condition|of the deceased´s neck and throat ?
{133606}{133746}There was severe bruising,|consistent with manual strangulation.
{133749}{133913}The hyoid bone was intact,|so death was not due to strangulation.
{133916}{133993}-  Prosecutor  It was caused by--|- Drowning.
{133996}{134128}In my opinion, the deceased fell|or was pushed into a pool of water,
{134131}{134192}some of which he inhaled.
{134195}{134260}No further questions.
{134398}{134500}Doctor, do you ever|have any difficulties...
{134503}{134583}determining the cause of death,
{134586}{134715}particularly when confronted|by a number of possibilities ?
{134718}{134775}Yes.
{134778}{134846}This case, for example ?
{134893}{134973}This was not straightforward.
{134976}{135088}And yet you´re absolutely certain|that the cause of death was drowning ?
{135091}{135196}Yes, I am.
{135465}{135526}Do you know|what this is, Doctor ?
{135587}{135644}A bone.
{135647}{135726}It´s an Aboriginal death bone.
{135729}{135816}Your Honor, I must object.|I fail to see any relevance.
{135819}{135983}Your Honor, the relevance|of the bone will become clear,|I think, as I continue.
{136035}{136123}Well, Mr. Burton,|with your assurance, continue.
{136193}{136308}Do you know what tribal sorcerers do|with a bone like this ?
{136311}{136425}Well, I thought|that was common knowledge.
{136428}{136544}He points it at his victim|and... the victim dies.
{136586}{136643}Exactly.
{136787}{136879}If you examined the body|of such a victim,
{136882}{136991}is it possible that you would find|no apparent cause of death ?
{136994}{137063}It´s possible.
{137066}{137222}I put it to you that Billy Corman died|as the result of tribal sorcery.
{137225}{137328}No ! Because the deceased|was not a tribal man.
{137558}{137644}Your secret|is linked to the water.
{137647}{137791}The black rain, the weather.|Is that what it is ?
{137794}{137863}Tell me !

{138080}{138139}My dreams are about water.
{138142}{138215}My dreams frighten me,|and they frighten Charlie.
{138218}{138292}Am I dreaming your secret ?
{138295}{138436}Chris... something,|someone wants me to know.

{144407}{144494}Chris, what is the secret|Billy died for?
{144497}{144628}Does someone forbid you to say ?|The one who pointed the bone ?|The spirit man ?
{144631}{144705}I must protest of this.|Objection, Your Honor.

- May I be of service to you?
- Can I please speak to Mr. Gentry?
Uh, why don't you try phoning?
I've been trying all day, but no one answers.
Why don't you try again tomorrow?
- Try what?
- Phoning.
But I'm here now.
Thought you said you only wanted to speak to him.
Can I please see Mr. Gentry?
Young lady, you've now had the pleasure of both speaking to and seeing Mr. Gentry.
- Now...
- You're Mr. Gentry?
- I thought you were...
- His butler.
Why, yes.
One as efficient as myself does not employ people to do tasks which he himself does superlatively.
Gee.
Well, are you going to invite me in?
Do you have something to give me?
Twenty-five thousand dollars.
The concept seems worthy of consideration.
Well, this is some place you've got here.
May I have the pleasure of knowing my welcomed intruder's name, and when I get the money?
My name is Nancy Weston and I'm a reporter for The Globe.
Get out.
Just a minute, Mr. Gentry.
The Globe wants to hire you to investigate that weird murder of the strip-teaser last night.
Well, then, they can send me a formal letter like anyone else.
But we would have, but you have a reputation for giving lengthy consideration before you take a case and we wanted to know your answer today.
You mentioned $25,000...
The Globe will give you $25,000 just to investigate the murder
- and if you discover the murderer...
- If I discover the murderer?
If you had any doubts at all, why bother me?
At any rate, discover the murderer and you get $25,000 more.
And your newspaper gets exclusive rights to the mystifying story of how the remarkable Abraham Gentry cracks another case.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Tell me. Tell me.
Anyone could have made me this offer, the Editor, the Chairman of the Board, why such a young and attractive novice reporter?
Perhaps, your employers felt that $50,000 wasn't enough.
Perhaps, but the money's the only offer you're getting from me.
I'm happy to know that.
Because if anything were offered besides the money, I would have had to turn it down.
- If you're done being clever...
- Never.
If I have your word that you'll take this case,
I'm authorized to give you this check for $5000
- for immediate expenses...
- You have my word and now you may leave.
My pleasure.
Stay out of trees.
Hello.
Hello!
- Hey, mister.
- What in heaven's name can I do for you?
- What can you do for me?
- Well?
I just wanted to know if you wanted something to drink.
Oh, as a matter of fact, I am a bit dry.
- I'll have some Cordon Bleu.
- Huh?
Cordon... Never mind.
I'll have a bottle of tonic water.
- In a clean glass.
- Ooh.
Would you please sit and talk to me for a while?
Sure, babe.
Sorry it took so long, but we borrowed your glass as a bottle opener.
Want me to take the first drink to make sure it's OK?
But I didn't boil my lips.
- You should have.
- Eh, what gives?
As a matter of fact I would appreciate it if you'd let me take it off the tray.
Sure, be my guest.
Now, don't drink it too fast.
Please tell me everything you can about Suzie Creampuff.
Are you a cop?
- Hardly.
- But what do you wanna know for?
She came from the Midwest.
She wanted to be an actress or a model.
She was doing this for food till she got a part in something.
She worked here for about two months.
She really thought she was something else, but she was just a big tease.
Oh, stop drooling.
I have a few more questions.
- Shoot.
- Did she have any boyfriends?
Nah, like I said, she was a big tease.
She'd get all the horny guys really turned on and let them think they were taking her home.
But when the club closed, she'd tell them all to flake off.
Was there anyone she teased in particular?
- Yeah.
- Go on.
There was this one guy, uh, a student.
Real wormy looking kid.
His mouth started hanging open as soon as he saw her.
He didn't really pay any attention to any of us other girls.
He would have done anything just to get it on with her.
She'd always tease him and shut him down.
Once, she told him she'd spent a night with him.
Do whatever he wanted for $200.
So he came in the next night with a check made out to cash for $200 and gave it to her after her last show.
- And then?
- She looked at it, laughed and tore it up.
- Hmm.
- Poor kid looked like he was gonna cry.
Do you know what happened to that check?
One of the bartenders saw the whole thing.
He felt sorry for the kid so he gave him a Harvey Wallbanger for it.
Do you know where that check is?
I think it's in the cash box, I'll check.
Hmm.
"Joseph Carter."
"1138 Winona..."
Is there anything else you can tell me?
Nah.
Hey, mister.
If you're ever around here again...
I'll try not to be.
I just thought I'd give you a little tip.
A girl like you ought to know what to do with this.
Well, what are you doing here?
Just making sure the paper's getting its money's worth.
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Where are we going?
1138 Winona.
Would you happen to be a Mr. Joseph Carter?
Nah, man, you like, uh, just missed him.
Would you happen to know where he went?
Who are you?
Yeah, yeah, he went to the stripper's.
Candy Cane's.
She was this friend of the other stripper that got bumped off the other night.
- Did he say why he went?
- Why do you wanna know?
Uh, he said something about, uh, he thought she knew something.
Man, he was like real crazy, man, freaked out, like in a daze.
Haven't been out of his crib all day.
Did he say where the young lady lived?
Yeah.
Uh, it's like first pan above Hungry Man's restaurant, like right down there.
Eh, thanks a lot, man. Peace!
- Who do you think you'll find here?
- Kilroy.
Why did you do that?
I didn't think you'd want to be on the floor when the police arrive.
They wouldn't step over you.
Lieutenant Anderson, please.
No. No emergency.
Lieutenant Anderson, a friend of mine stepped into some trouble and seems to have lost face.
All right, stop taking those goddamn pictures!
Or I'll arrest every one of you.
Now look, Gentry.
Happen to know anything else, or have you found anything and forgot to tell me?
Lieutenant...
I'm sorry, I cannot stay for your pardon.
But I have some things to attend to.
Hey, don't you think that guy, Carter, has anything to do with the murders?
Hardly. A diversionary tactic.
- How do you figure?
- Miss Weston,
I'm not here to instruct you on criminal investigations or ingenious methods.
Well, where to, then?
How about your apartment?
Why, Abraham, you're flattering me.
Yes, I was thinking of putting you to bed.
And giving you an adequate dose of sleeping pills to get rid of you for a few days.
Tell me, Mr. Gentry, do you try to be a jerk or does it just...
Come naturally.
Get in and fasten your seat belt.
- Where to?
- Tops and Bottoms.
The place where our friend worked who had her face lifted.
You're resting your crutch on my foot.
I don't want you to move an inch from this spot.
Oh, no. Ow!
OK, OK.
Where are you going?
Going to pay a small visit to the bartender.
How would you like a drink while I'm gone?
Hey, Barney, give me a couple of Martinis and a Manhattan on the rocks, please.
- Right with you. Yeah.
- Now. Yeah, yeah.
All I ever do around this place is wait.
Come on.
Hey, she's taking it all off!
Excuse me.
Sorry, you are inexcusable.
Well, if it isn't Miss Glamour.
If I would have known you were coming, Mr. Clean,
I would have bought a bottle of Pepto-Bismol for you and a bottle of disinfectant for me.
It never occurred to me that
I might run into you after your work twice in one day.
But, if it did, I would have thought your second job would have caused me to bump into you on the street.
Look. What do you want? I'm busy.
I don't wanna get fired for talking to riff raff.
The young lady at that table would like a Zombie in a tall glass with four shots of tequila.
How long has she been out with you?
Just deliver the drink.
- Hey, Barney.
- Yeah.
I want a Zombie in a tall glass with four shots of tequila.
Don't ask me why.
- Hey, Barney.
- Yeah.
- I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- I'm too busy, Max.
Hey, Charlie, take over for me.
I gotta take a shit.
Yeah, buddy, what's on your mind?
Who's that big man at the end of the bar, the one mutilating those squashes and tomatoes?
Oh, him, he's Grout.
- Grout?
- Yeah, Grout.
That's all I've ever heard him called.
Hey, uh, why are you interested in him?
Please tell me everything you can about him.
Yeah, buddy.
Now, uh, you know,
I don't know much about him, like, where he lives and stuff like that but what I do know is that he's an ex-Marine and he spent a lot of time in Vietnam.
Now, he was really crazy.
You know what he used to do?
He hated them gooks so much that he used to go through the rice paddies after the battles were over and he'd start busting in the heads of the dead bodies.
Well, they didn't bother him much, you know.
Till they found out he wasn't just busting in the heads of the gooks.
Well, our boys too!
Hmm, did they discharge him?
Hell no!
Why'd they do that?
And then, what?
He came here, got a job.
Keeps pretty much to himself.
What about the squashes and tomatoes?
Oh, that, he says he does it to relieve tension, and bring back fond memories.
What time did he come in tonight?
About an hour ago.
Thank you very much, Barney.
Sure, buddy, anytime.
Hey, Barney, you done with that shit, yet?
Yeah!
How is my lovely partner doing?
Oh, they sure make a great drink at this joint.
Abraham, you called me your partner.
Did you mean it?
Do I ever say anything I don't mean?
I have one more person to see.
How would you like another drink, while I'm gone?
Are you trying to get me drunk now to take advantage of me later?
Well, you don't have to get me drunk to do that.
I know.
Waitress.
I was afraid it was your voice.
My charming companion would like another, of the same.
See you later, Abie.
No, I'm afraid not.
Hey, Grout, I wish you wouldn't be so messy.
Mr...
Mr. Grout.
Hey, all right.
Ladies and gentleman, the Tops and Bottoms club proudly presents another of our most beautiful and voluptuous young maidens,
Miss Lola Prize.
- What's going on, Mary?
- Shh.
Mr. Grout?
All right, girls, just get on stage.
As soon as she goes into her act, we'll go into ours.
Yeah!
We'll show these striptease bitches just what we think!
Yeah!
If we don't rip her hair out.
Yeah!
Mr. Grout!
Why do you keep on bothering me?
Let's go!
Hey, folks, get outta here.
Mr. Grout, please accept my apology, but I just thought I would tell you that the police already know about
Miss Candy Cane's murder tonight.
Get out of here!
Get 'em, girls! Get 'em!
Hi, Abie.
- Time to go home, Nancy.
- Oh, good!
- Oh.
- Oh, oh, oh.
Taxi!
Come with me.
I want you to take the young lady home.
Stick out your hands.
Here is her address and this is her key.
Keep the change.
Hey, you haven't told me your name yet.
Abraham Gentry.
- You mean...
- The Abraham Gentry.
Abie.
Pickles.
Do you mind if I lie down?
I'm still pretty shook up.
Do you know a Miss Candy Cane?
Sure. She strips at the same joint I do.
She didn't come in tonight.
Funny, you should bring her up.
Nothing can bring her up.
She was murdered tonight.
Oh, my God.
Well, who could have killed her?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
And I think you might be able to help.
That's the second of my friends that've been killed in the last couple of days.
You know Miss Suzie Creampuff too?
Well, not real good, but Candy was good friends with her and I was good friends with Candy.
I still can't believe it.
- She was so sweet.
- Hmm.
Are you familiar with a young man named
Joseph Carter?
I just met him tonight.
He wanted to see Candy to talk to her about Suzie, but he was too shy to go to her apartment so he came to work to wait for her.
Now, he'll never get to meet her.
I just can't believe it.
Do you know whether she or Suzie knew Grout?
Sure, we all know him.
He scares me, the way he's always staring at my head.
But he does protect me from mashers.
Mashers, yes.
What about, uh, the leader of that women's group that attacked you tonight?
That bitch. She's always causing trouble around the clubs.
She says, "You strippers is a disgrace to womanhood."
Has she ever threatened to kill any of you before tonight?
All the time.
- We get... of the Marzdone...
- Marzdone? Mobilie?
Yeah, do you know him?
He's the owner of all these clubs.
Quite well.
Anyway, he says that if we did, publicity will just bring more of them together and make things worse.
Until tonight, they just picketed and ran off with the mail.
Tore off a couple of our costumes.
Oh, yeah, one night, she came in the club, took off her bra on stage.
Well, Candy grabbed it out of her hands and put it on.
It was real funny coz Candy is five or six times bigger than she is.
Thank you very much, Lola.
You've been a big help to me.
Well, aren't you gonna stay for a cup of coffee or something?
Well, uh, I have to get a little rest.
But you can rest. Here.
He was kinda cute.
What are you doing here?
Ah, Gentry.
All right, stop it!
OK, Gentry, what did you and Miss Prize talk about?
Uh, Lieutenant, have you figured out that I left prior to the killing?
Yeah. Yeah, just tell me what you talked about.
I take it that the cause of death was exactly like the others.
Uh... Face mutilated with a meat tenderizer.
Throat slit and this one had her ass beat in.
Tell me what you talked about!
Um...
Hey, look, Gentry, you're trying my patience, now, if you don't start co-operating...
- Things.
- Huh?
We talked about things.
Am I gonna have to take you down to the station?
How original. All right, Lieutenant.
I took Miss Prize home after an incident with some women's liberationists.
Yeah.
I questioned her about why she felt the women had attacked her?
Yeah.
Let's see, oh, yes, and she removed every stitch she had on.
Began explaining how the other women were jealous of her body...
Oh, and then she pointed out a few of the high spots.
Yeah, then.
Oh, yeah, she propositioned me.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, go ahead. What'd you do then?
Oh, Lieutenant, have you no respect for the privacy of one's intimate relations, let alone the dead?
Now, look, Gentry, when it comes to law and order, it's my duty and responsibility to find out everything.
You act as if I get pleasure out of this.
Now, what did you do then?
Well, I explained to this poor lost soul how she would find much more pleasure and satisfaction in the teachings of God than any encounter with me, and I left her reading her Bible.
OK, wise guy.
If that's true, where's the Bible?
Lieutenant, how brilliant. You've uncovered something I never thought of.
The murderer is a religious fanatic who is ridding the world of these unscrupulous harlots.
Yeah, I got it.
That person wouldn't leave her with the Bible.
- So the murderer took it.
- Right.
You find that Bible and you've got yourself a killer.
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Gentry.
- Don't thank me, you did all the work.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah!
All right, men, we gotta find the Bible.
- Why?
- What?
Now!
- I just...
- Uh, Lieutenant.
Yeah, what do you want, Gentry?
You mentioned something about Miss Prize's hind end being pulverized?
I haven't discovered the reason why, yet, but when we found her she was on her back, with her...
Her panties pulled down to her knees.
And when we turned her over, her...
Uh, her... The lady's, uh, fanny was smashed.
There was no apparent reason for it, but we did find this next to it.
- I'm sure you'll think of something.
- Yeah.
- Good night, Lieutenant.
- Thanks, Gentry.
Oh, Freddy...
- How's the wife and kids?
- Oh, we're all fine, Mr. Gentry. And you?
Couldn't be better.
Freddy, I'd like you to take what's in this piece of paper and on that handkerchief and have the boys in the lab give me everything they can on it.
Needless to say, we don't want, you know who, to find out about it.
Oh, buy the boys some good cigars.
Sure enough, Mr. Gentry,
I'll take care of everything.
- Good night, Freddy.
- Anytime, Mr. Gentry.
Linda, I'm home.
Girls! Girls!
Girls!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's going on?
What happened? What's going on here?
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, let me help.
What is wrong? What is wrong?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Find anything?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
- Well...
Oh, now look, Gentry.
You don't expect me to tell you about confidential police evidence, do you?
Anyway, if you've found something, you wouldn't tell me.
Lieutenant...
Must I remind you of that brilliant religious theory that you came up with?
Well, no, but that was proved wrong already.
Lieutenant, I'm surprised at you.
Are you going to stand there and tell me that just because you've found that obviously planted Bible in unavoidable sight, that you're going to disregard a theory that your own genius so cleverly devised?
- Now, are you?
- That obviously planted Bible.
I don't know about you, but it's perfectly clear to me that the girl's Bible was taken by the murderer and that one left to mislead the authorities.
Well, no, I mean, yeah.
Of course, of course I realize that.
I just wanted to see if you're as smart as you're cracked up to be.
I guess we can show you what we've found.
Since it has no real bearing on the case anyway,
That is, if you'd wanna bother.
Another one of these things.
Found it on the floor in the kitchen.
Hey, what do you make of that girl's chest?
Not very much at the moment.
That must be why the murderer used heat in these killings.
To give the girls a taste of their destiny?
Well, sure.
The madman must have figured to burn them some here before they got down there.
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Doc.
Doc.
Oh, hello, Mr. Gentry.
Doc, are there any differences in the murders, aside from the different means of mutilation?
No, but I'll tell you one thing.
This murderer sure wasn't weak.
Hmm.
Thank you, Doc. Nancy...
- It's time for you to do something useful.
- What?
I want you to find the leader of that women's lib gang,
Mary McHenry.
Somehow find out how strong she is and if she wears any makeup.
And then, I want you to act sympathetic to her cause, tell her you're writing a story about her feelings about the murders.
And to play it safe, you better take off your bra.
Anything else?
Yes, find out if she wore a wig and if so get me all you can on it.
And then check out Miss Prize's apartment.
See if she wore a wig.
- And if so, get me samples.
- Where are you going?
I'm going to visit the owner of all those clubs where the girls worked,
Mr. Marzdone Mobilie.
Hey, fellas, I got a really great idea.
How about an amateur strip contest?
I'll put a sign in all our places saying,
"So you wanna be a stripper?
"Amateur strip contest. Come one, come all.
"Big prize!"
- Hey, you know what the prize is gonna be?
- What's that, boss?
Me.
Well, what's the prize really gonna be, boss?
Uh, how about 200 bucks?
Do you think that's enough?
I don't know, boss.
Come here, baby.
Do you think $200 is really a big enough prize?
For what?
- About the prize. 200 bucks. Any, uh...
- For what?
Oh, take a walk.
I'll call you when I need you.
Hey, fellas, maybe I ought to give
300 bucks as the prize.
Mr. Mobilie?
Hey, buddy, can you read the sign back there?
It says, closed till 5:00. Beat it.
Hey, maybe I ought to throw in a...
Like the George Washington monument.
Yeah, boss. Yeah.
Mr. Mobilie.
Gentry! Fred, Sam!
Nice going, Gentry. They deserved that.
I would have done it myself, only I didn't have the heart to do it.
Sit down for a minute.
I want you to know, I don't bear any grudges.
Well, do me a favor, will you, Gentry?
Stop investigating my places.
I've got enough problems.
You know, I just found out this morning that two more of my girls were bumped off.
And the rest of the girls are...
Nobody'll be here tonight, they even have...
What about the waitress over there?
She hasn't got the chest for anything. No tits.
I'm trying to get some amateur strippers here.
I'm desperate.
Say, by the way, what are you investigating?
Ironically, in a way, I'm working for you.
I'm investigating the murders of your now thoroughly exotic dancers.
- No...
- Very little, if any.
Hey, boss, can we go home?
I don't feel so good.
Yeah, go ahead and don't forget to be back by 5:00
- and bring your other head.
- Yeah, boss.
Are you a cop?
I informed you that my services are indirectly awarded to you and you keep insulting me.
When was the last time you saw Grout?
Oh, he was around a little while ago.
Personally, I think he left for warmer climates. Dig?
Do you think it was because of the murders?
No, around here kept running out of squash.
Do you know he's a damn good bartender?
And besides, he kept
- the mashers away from the broads.
- The mashers away from the broads.
Do you have any feelings about the murders?
Oh, buddy, I got a big hurt, right here in my heart.
Listen, if you're gonna do business with him,
I'm gonna quit.
Listen, you mind your own business.
- You know who this is?
- Yeah, I know exactly who and what this is.
Marlene and I have had what you might say the mutual displeasure of each other's acquaintance, uh, several times in the past few days.
But, in all honesty, I alone have suffered.
Listen, if I weren't such a lady,
I'd let you have...
Hey, wait a minute here,
I've got enough troubles here.
Say, Mr. Gentry, you've been around many years.
What do you think about giving a prize to the best amateur stripper?
I think you're just asking for trouble by using amateurs.
Hey, do me a favor, would you mind your own business?
Look, some guys are gonna come in here and lose sight of his chick and find her on stage with her clothes off and then wanna kill every other guy in the joint who saw her.
With a cash prize like that, you're just gonna trouble the amount of broads wanting to do that.
Hey! That's great.
I'll split the $1000 amongst the three places.
- What do you think, Mr. Gentry?
- It's a great idea.
Get those women on stage, give them some money and let their egos do the rest.
By then, the money will become secondary to be chosen the most sexy.
As a matter of fact, this is the biggest of your clubs, isn't it?
- And the best located?
- Certainly, this is the greatest.
Instead of stringing things out, why not bring everything together here?
All for $1000 for first prize.
You can let the women in for free and get a five-dollar cover charge for the men.
Hey, that's great.
And as a matter of fact, to show you my heart's in the right place,
I have a friend at the newspaper,
I'll get her to print a feature story.
"The greatest striptease show of the century."
Hey, that's fantastic.
Where you've been all my life?
Say, Gentry, you're a genius!
Sometimes I can hardly believe it.
You're nuts.
After tonight, you only have a place left.
They'll tear this club apart.
Stop and think a minute.
There will be hundreds of strippers.
Things'll get out of hand.
And the things will get in hand too.
Money, money, money.
Damn, it's been good to see you, Abe.
Hey, don't make it so long next time.
I promise, Lizzie.
Thank you for the information.
Guess who?
Weston, what did you find out?
I found out the women's liberation movement is really together.
Hey, you didn't put your bra back on.
You looked, I mean, probably never will.
- Fine. Now what did you find out?
- I found out that women's rights have been denied since the beginning of time and...
Now, what did you find out?
Well, I found out that Mary McHenry knows all the places she was, at the times of the murders, but she was always alone.
She said... "You know, I wish I knew who was bumming off those strippers."
"Womanhood strippers, coz I'd like to congratulate her."
"I wished it was me."
Do you think she had anything to do with it?
I don't know. She really hates strippers.
Hmm. What about the wig?
Mary didn't wear wigs or makeup.
Hmm. Say, do you think you can get your editor to print a feature story
- and run, maybe an ad for tonight's edition?
- Sure.
Mmm. How would you like to go out tonight?
- With me?
- Sure.
All right, well, we'll finish eating and then I'll take you home, pick you up again around 8:00.
Yeah, about 8:00. And wear something sexy.
- Need anything else?
- Oh, no. This is fine. Thank you.
Come in.
My. Aren't we risqué tonight?
I'm certainly willing.
Folks, how do you like the show so far?
Pretty bad, huh? Pretty bad, huh?
...you can do if you want to do your thing.
Go ahead.
OK, I promised to let him do that, he used to work at Sing Sing.
Folks, I want you to drink up, we have plenty of booze here.
And I got to tell you that we just got the news on the television that Tom Jones crossed his legs quickly.
He's in critical condition.
OK, we have two more contestants left.
And the lucky one is gonna get
$1000 for a prize.
Now here's the next contestant.
Hey, get them the best table in the house.
Right in there.
You're just in time for the second contestant.
And here she is now, folks.
Our next contestant,
Miss Ruby Diamond.
Well, what'll it be,
Mr. Big Spender?
I'll have a glass of brandy and the usual for Miss Weston.
- A Zombie in a tall glass...
- Yeah, I know.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Shake it, come on.
All right, folks.
- How do you like that dance?
- All right!
- Oh, great.
- That was a lovely lady bringing up a cold.
That was a better way to bring up a family.
She dresses in one room and I dress in the next room and there's a little hole in the wall.
I let her look.
Take a look at her,
I wanna go home and beat my wife.
My wife wanted a face lift that they couldn't do, for $80 they lowered her body.
And now, folks, for the last contestant.
Ah, she's adorable, folks.
I'd like you to meet Miss Ramona Mona.
That is the sexiest woman I've ever seen.
I don't think she's that sexy.
She's really the best.
None of the others were anything like her.
My, my, my...
She is remarkable.
I can dance better than that any day.
Pretty you are and you have a nice figure, but not like that.
How would you know?
You've never seen me like that.
I'm not criticizing you.
She's built differently.
And moves it in a different way.
I can move it better than that.
Ramona Mona. Oh, isn't she great?
I didn't think she was that great.
I'm next.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Not only has Nancy Nancy won the contest but she is a new star of Marz's Heaven!
Congratulations.
Oh...
Abe, did you really think I was the best?
Nancy, not only were you the best
- but you still are.
- Oh.
I have to take care of something.
Mmm...
All right, Abe.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Well, if it isn't the distinguished
Marlene the barmaid.
Oh, Marlene, oh, how clumsy... Ah, ah, ah.
I'm sorry. I forgot the cheese and crackers, so you won't need that knife.
Poor Marlene, jealous of all the strippers and...
Because Marzdone was making it with them and paid no attention to you.
You despise them and so you mutilated them because they had something you didn't have anymore.
What was that, Marlene?
Marlene, let's see.
Was I right or was I right?
What a character.
That's Marlene. All over.
Oh, Abe.
Oh, Abe, I was having this terrible dream that that girl at the club was trying to kill me.
I know.
You do?
Wait a minute, how did I get here?
Now, forget about that for now.
I'll explain all that tomorrow.
Now, get yourself together.
You're gonna spend the night at my place.
And I'll give you your story in the morning.
Good morning.
May I please speak to Lieutenant Anderson?
I'm sure he won't mind being awakened.
Tell him it's Abraham Gentry.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
I hope I didn't awaken you.
I'm sorry, but I thought you'd like to know that the murderer you were looking for just fell from a second-story window.
And she just ruined her makeup.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Oh, by the way, Lieutenant, she was an atheist.
If you're ready, we may be on our way.
Abe, will you treat me like a woman?
Of course.
With all the respect you're entitled to.
Oh, Abe.
A bit of ingenuity on my part, it was as simple as that.
I didn't suspect Marlene, until I remembered an incident with an exiled lady wrestler.
My mental powers, I was sure of, and so I set up the situation in which I can trap the murderer and lure her into my hands.
Hopefully, in the middle of one of her facial extravaganzas.
You mean to tell me that you used me as the meat to bait your trap.
I gave you that honor.
Why, you no good dirty rat!
Now, we had to come face to face with the murderer.
"We had to come face to face"?
I had to come face to face!
And I almost lost mine.
We had nothing of great importance to lose, if my theory had been proved unsound.
Now, I came in time, didn't I?
What if you had come a second too late?
Well, I knew.
Now, do you want to quibble over nothing or do you want your story?
Go on.
I went to see an old and dear friend of mine, Lizzie Murdoch.
Better known to her wrestling fans as Lizzie the Snake,
- or the Python Lady...
- I figure she'd be a friend of yours.
Go on.
Unrelated in my memory,
I have a lady league wrestler named
Betty the Beautiful.
The wrestler extraordinaire, who with her perfect body perfectly stripped every opponent she got on top of.
Now, Lizzie's recollection was the same as mine.
Betty wanted out of the wrestling game and got into strip-teasing.
- Yeah.
- And she was an instant sensation and of course was picked up and managed by none other than
- Marzdone Mobilie.
- No kidding.
I do not kid.
Marzdone made a lot of money with her and even decided to marry her,
- until her unfortunate accident.
- Which was?
Well, one night,
Betty was trapped in her bedroom when a fire broke out and before they could get there to help her she was burned badly.
And?
Well, plastic surgery was successful on her face.
But her head and her chest were completely disfigured.
Well, Marzdone had no further use for her, but out of pity, he changed her name and gave her a job as a waitress...
So with Marzdone having nothing else to do with her, she slowly started going nuts and became insanely jealous of all the girls who had what Marzdone wanted.
Exactly.
Well, what triggered off your memory about Marlene?
And how are you so sure it wasn't Grout or Mary McHenry?
Oh, it was something Marzdone said...
He said that she couldn't strip because she didn't have the chest for it.
Well, that started me thinking.
And later on, when we had a confrontation together she threatened me with some sort of a gesture
- that only a lady wrestler would use.
- And Grout?
Well, Grout...
I was pretty sure Grout wasn't the murderer after seeing all those clues that seemed to exploit him.
As a matter of fact,
I even tried to catch him to tell him I no longer suspected him.
And Mary, the women's libber?
Yes, Mary didn't wear makeup and from the information the boys in the lab gave me
I knew the murderer wore a wig and super cover makeup.
Which Marlene needed to cover those surgery scars.
Go on.
Well, I had to stage that naked extravaganza to bait her on.
I led her to believe you and I had something going and when you won that contest...
Wait a minute.
Did I legitimately win that contest?
Not only did you really win that contest fair and square,
I'm led to believe that you have the finest form I have ever seen.
Poor Marlene.
Hers is the saddest story of all.
She lost face three times.
First with her wrestling fans, then with her striptease patrons.
And finally, between a layer of concrete and the wheel of a car.
She did go out in style though.
It was a new car.
Abe...
There's still something I haven't lost yet.
Oh, it isn't your nerve or your sense of humor, uh, let's see, what could it be?
You've seen enough.
She was wearing nothing underneath.
She was wearing nothing underneath, stop.
I moved my eyes slowly, up her long, black legs,
across her flat, glistening torso,
over her rounded breasts to her face, stop.
It wasn't beautiful but it was lived in, stop.
I chewed her ear and whispered 'kitten', stop.
Black thoughts were transmitted, stop.
I put my hand on her...
I slammed my fist in his face. There was the sound of crunching bone.
Blood spattered like a burst water mains, stop.
I smashed my knee into his...
I took the whip and cracked it across his back, stop.
To my amazement, comma, he squealed with delight.
Everyone on earth has a secret closet he'd rather left closed, stop.
His face was like a crushed red pepper.
No wonder my fist throbbed, stop.
And that wasn't all that throbbed.
I had just opened one of those closets without knocking, and stood staring in.
I cracked the whip again, stop.
This time across his...
I kissed her lightly on the cheek and slipped quietly from the room, stop.
End of paragraph.
Chapter 13.
Outside I hailed a cab, stop.
Its tyres screeched on the tarmac as it drew up and stopped.
'Take me to the asylum', I said.
The driver laughed. That was all he said.
Have you got a light?
The day started quietly enough.
Then I got out of bed.
That was my first mistake.
My second was to try and get from here... to here.
That's how it all began.
That bizarre adventure which put five in the cemetery,
and ruled me out as a customer for laxatives.
At the time, I was living abroad.
I was a writer, having three years before left London
and a lucrative job as a funeral director.
It was my wife's family business,
whom I'd deserted with my three children.
Handling stiffs wasn't the life for someone
with a burning creative urge.
So, I elbowed the loved ones.
I left some tapes here for transcription.
The name is King.
- In English?
- Preferably.
Please, you wait.
The writer's life would be ideal but for the writing.
That was a problem I had to overcome.
Then, I read in the Guinness Book of Records about Earl Stanley Gardner,
the world's fastest novelist, who dictates up to 10,000 words a day.
That was for me. None of that romantic stuff with a typewriter.
I had better uses for those two particular fingers.
My full name is Chester Thomas King.
Although most people call me Mickey for reasons I won't go into.
You may have read some of my early works.
But my publisher didn't see Chester Thomas
King as the name of a best-selling author.
He preferred such authors as
Guy Strange, Gary Rough,
Dan Wild and Les Behan.
I was all those and others. I was co-authors Susan Eager and Paul S. Cumming.
The newly discovered Indian writer,
Doctor O.R. Gann, spelt with two N's,
and the struggling Nigerian author,
S. Odomy, with the emphasis on the "O".
None of them exactly made
Book of the Month Club.
- Mr King?
- Yes.
Could I have a word with you?
Yes.
Please, take a seat.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
Our work here is mainly technical specifications, insurance and shipping documents, company records and legal contracts.
Your manuscript took my staff rather by surprise.
- They finished it, though?
- Of course.
Of course.
May I ask who normally types your work?
My mother.
- Your mother?
- Yes, she prefers it to knitting.
If you don 't want my custom, just say so.
What I read I personally found very stimulating.
And your staff?
Too stimulating.
But they have no taste for such things.
My private address, if I can ever be of assistance.
Thank you.
Are your books in any way autobiographical?
Totally.
What an exciting life you must have had, even better than Frank Harris.
Oh, Frank was a novice.
You have my card.
Don 't hesitate to touch me.
Yes, I remember that day all right.
Around noon I'd collected the manuscript of my latest novel, The Organ Grinder.
I should have realised something was up.
A man had been tailing me for over two weeks.
I thought my wife must have employed a private dick.
I did ask him, but he got upset.
He was too big to upset twice, so I tried to ignore him,
which in this case was difficult.
Later I was to find out who he was, that tame gorilla
who followed my everywhere.
I rode a cab round to my publisher,
Milos Marcovic, the Greco-Albanian born in Budapest,
whose talent for writing book covers is such even the author doesn't recognise his own work.
Sylvana... get this down.
Marcovic was responsible for all the aggravation that was about to hit me.
Hollywood, an empire in decay, comma.
Ruled by a twisted emperor, comma.
And the desires and tantrums...
...of a strange girl whose secret became a big screen Technicolor...
...nightmare. New paragraph.
Sam Nectar was his name.
An unknown oriental girl was his obsession.
Sam cast her as a Negro slave,
only to find himself cast as a slave to her desires. New paragraph.
What the critics said:
"Tense...
exciting, enjoyable. "
Times Literary Supplement.
The office attracted leading writers from all over Europe.
Marcovic never quite understood why.
Nor did he care much.
His life was dominated by one driving force.
A weak bladder.
Signor Marcovic.
- I didn't get all the quotes down.
- Later.
Open, you son of a bitch!
Why is this door always sticking?
Oh Jesus, I'm bursting.
Oh God, I beseech You.
One last favour.
Open this door.
Thank you.
Why?
Why have you deserted me?
Do you want to hear my confession, honey?
What have I done wrong?
My name is Dinuccio, I got an appointment.
- Take a seat, please.
- I'll kneel.
Show me a sign, Lord!
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
King of kings.
Or St Matthew?
How old is this man?
He says he's 62.
He'll really be 65 next autumn.
- You want to publish on his birthday?
- Correct. Blue.
Went in like it had eyes.
His name was Ben Dinuccio.
It was the nicest thing about him.
He said he did the PR for an important man who wanted me to write his life story.
Trouble was, he couldn't tell us who,
though he stated categorically that it wasn't Howard Hughes.
Why me?
He likes your style, feller.
Read all your books.
Kill Me Gently. My Gun Is Long.
The Knee Trembler. All of 'em.
He knows I've never ghosted anyone's life story.
So start now. Besides, you're Sagittarius, which is just great.
- How do you know that?
- I know everything about you.
From your wife's maiden name to your measurements.
We don 't take no risks.
Encouraging.
Be flattered!
Green.
What a shot! I'm a pistol, ain't I?
What's going on out there?
What are those signs saying?
"For law and order vote
Prince Cippola and the New Front Party. "
- Are those characters for real?
- Yes.
Jesus wept!
They don 't look so new to me. Yellow.
I'm all for law and order.
You for law and order, Mickey?
Theirs or mine?
I still don 't see why you want me.
It's simple. You're elected.
The old man 's getting ready for the big sleep.
Excuse me?
Certainly. It's the first door to the right, it's marked "toilette". Brown.
He's headed for the last round-up and wants something to be remembered by.
A death rattle... in paperback, eh?
He's got more stories than the Bible.
Crazy stuff. All you gotta do is write it down.
Black.
That's absolutely marvelous!
Great! Stay out of it. OK?
OK, take it.
Hold it! That's great.
Thank you, ladies. I appreciate your kindness.
Just win, dago.
Come on, you beautiful thing.
How are things down there at the offices?
Nuts!
- Pinko.
- He's American?
Indelibly.
He's famous?
A household word.
Like "sink".
What's worrying you two?
You got nothing to lose.
You get a month's vacation at his villa, a cash advance and a fat fee.
You get the publishing costs plus a slice of the profits.
Black.
What's my fat fee?
Correction.
For fat fee, read blood money.
Wanna play, Mickey?
Two days later,
I was traveling south, destination unknown.
Dinuccio was so full of the Bond crap, it had to be a private jet to Miami
and a mysterious hostess to loosen my safety belt.
Did I have a wrong number?
A five-day package tour, and for me a personalised mystery trip.
That freak Dinuccio had come up with a new idea of hell.
My instructions said that someone would contact me along the way.
I looked the passengers over for a possible contact man.
Balloons!
Not a dirty thought between them.
That would have been too much.
"The immovably chaste girl said,
'Over my dead body'. He took her at her word. "
"Don 't spend another night alone.
Send for the fantastic date-maker.
It's the greatest device for getting intimate with girls you have long admired. "
Come on... look at me.
You are beautiful.
I want you alone on a slow coach to China.
My God, she's trying to make me.
Dinuccio had a lousy sense of humour.
I tipped my seat back and waited for the tap on the shoulder.
Ladies and gentlemen, you'll be arriving at our hotel in about five minutes.
As we climb the steep road, you will have a magnificent view of the city on your right hand side of the coach.
Mind if I use that?
No, fine.
Fantastic.
Contact was made as we neared our first stopover.
He identified himself with one of my books.
Anice touch that, and good for my royalties.
You're English.
Right through, yes.
On vacation?
Sort of a... working holiday.
What do you do?
I write.
What do you write?
Mister?
King.
Jack Miller.
What?
What do you write?
Gangster fiction.
Pulp would be less pompous and more accurate.
You're talking to an addict!
I practically eat them.
They'd given the job to a screwball.
The reading had gone to his stomach.
He was constipated with pulp, and now it was coming out, all over me.
Rose MacDonald...
- You've read Rose MacDonald?
- No, not since Mother died.
The best, I think.
What books have you written?
How about... My Gun is Long?
You're kidding! You wrote that?
Yes, I am the real Guy Strange.
That's very good.
Oh, you have great taste, Mr Miller.
"Sensual... brutal...
Mr Strange provides us with a devil's dictionary of our secret visions and desires. "
It's dedicated to my wife.
You put yourself down. Shouldn't do that.
You've got a good hero here in Brad Mason.
Here's a man who clearly sees the animal in himself and he's not ashamed...
Why don 't we cut the crap and talk straight?
- Your plot line is thin.
- It is, is it?
- Relies too much on coincidence.
- It does?
Puts your story beyond the bounds of believability.
Well... how about this for believability?
I know all about you, Mr Miller.
- Excuse me.
- Surely.
It was like I had halitosis, and that made me mad.
OK, so I'd jumped the gun and spoilt his game.
That was no reason for acting like a big girl.
If Miller didn't get over his menopause by morning, I'd quit the job.
Things started happening sooner than that.
Vodka and tonic, please.
Thank you.
The armchair adventurers were packed away in their rooms.
I sat in the bar thinking.
What nut wanted me to write his life story?
A Mafia boss on the run?
A defrocked priest? Adolf Hitler?
I still didn't understand all the secrecy.
As fiction, it was a guaranteed rejection slip.
King.
Room 313.
- Have you got the key, sir?
- No.
It's probably in the lock.
The boy will show you up.
Boy!
Room 313.
- What are you doing here?
- I hope you don 't snore, Miller.
You're supposed to be in room 213.
- They brought me in here.
- That's OK. I'll take your room.
- I have to watch my image.
- Just a minute. This shouldn't have happened.
I bet you say that to all the boys.
I took dinner early, it was part of the package and free.
I wore my royal blue suit with shirt, tie and matching handkerchief,
black moccasins, mauve socks and a fresh pair of jockey pants
in case of assassination.
I'd bathed, shaved and taken a dry martini in the bar. I was to need it.
A tomato salad, spaghetti with butter...
No sauce, you understand?
Spinach with two eggs.
You a vegetarian?
I'll have a plate of courgettes. Again, just butter.
And get me a bottle of mineral water.
- Are you a vegetarian?
- Yes.
Why is that?
I don 't like the killing of animals.
We are from Texas.
What about fish?
Occasionally.
See, I told you, they're all alike.
We are from Texas.
Of course you are, dear boy.
Of course you are.
- Eggs?
- Yes.
Cheese?
They're all organic matter.
"'Contrariwise', continued Tweedledee.
If it was so, it might be; if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain 't. That's logic'."
The words of Lewis Carroll, my dear lady.
But I'll put it more succinctly...
Piss off!
Paging Mr King.
Miller didn't show at feeding time.
I wanted to see him again.
We were due for another talk.
The page boy was right on cue.
Thank you.
Miller wanted to see me in room 313.
It was the long arm of coincidence.
Miller?
What's the matter with you?
Waterlogged?
I thought it was red bath salts at first.
Then I knew he'd get his picture in the paper.
He'd been knifed.
Jack Francis Miller, senior lecturer in English, Berkeley University.
I was dumb enough to wonder what he was doing as my contact man.
The answer was, he wasn't.
I wondered who he was, the poor dead bastard.
Why had he panicked when I put the finger on him?
I was in for a surprise.
The guy was a fag, a transvestite.
That explained his panic, but not his death.
An ugly thought made my waters curdle.
That should have been me in there.
Miller was my stand-in with death.
Morning! It was election day, so the Muzak at breakfast was a little unusual.
I ordered tomato juice, then cancelled out of respect for the dead.
I didn't fancy a bath, either.
I expected the place to be moving with police like maggots in a ripe Camembert.
Not one! Not a cop, tracker dog or bandage mechanic.
Not a reporter, photographer or clairvoyant in sight.
That didn't figure.
"The further off from England, the nearer it is to France.
And turn not pale beloved snail;
But come and join the dance. "
"Can you walk a little faster, said the whiting to the snail.
There's a porpoise close behind me
And he's treading on my tail. "
I've read it 117 times.
Alice in Wonderland.
117 times.
Starting again tomorrow.
Yes, well, you've picked the right tour for it.
"'Begin at the beginning', the King said gravely,
'go on to the end and stop'."
They should have found him by now.
Of course, Miller may have asked for a late call.
Very late. Judgment Day.
I left the Mad Hatter and decided to take a trip down memory lane past room 313.
My mouth went dry.
The door was open and the room cleaned out.
Hello?
The corpse had checked out!
Hello!
Inspector Clouseau in drag.
The man who was here...
Where is he?
Yes, that's what I thought.
OK... Grazie.
- Yes, Mr King?
- Mr Miller, room 313.
I'm afraid he left early this morning.
- Are you sure?
- He had to go back to America suddenly.
- Did you actually see him leave yourself?
- Yes.
Thank you.
"Curiouser...
...and curiouser. "
1,373, Mr Balmoral.
Miller was dead and now gone, checked into the Hotel Paradiso.
But we weren't, the killer and I.
We were still earth travelers, probably sharing the same lousy bus.
The guy was no dum-dum.
It wouldn't be long before he knew he'd got the wrong man.
This story was like some pornographic photo.
Difficult to work out who's doing what to whom.
I was still trying when we reached the Temples of Zonk.
And the gods were angry, anyways, and they sent a thunderbolt to the city of sin.
Now some personages nowadays would call that punishment or smelly revenge, depending on your point of view or state of mind, but this was a warning to such personages to stop bad ways of having fun and to clean themselves up.
It was a very big warning.
All peoples still in bed when the thunderbolt blow out of the sky, with many still drunk with, er, sexual potion.
They do not know what hit them.
In the museum you will see plaster casts of people in very interesting death positions.
The poet, Memphis, describe it as
"The greatest coming since Zeus fell upon his wife. "
And then the city sank into the sea...
Follow me please, out this way and over there.
What do you think of Zonk's temple, Mr King?
- How do you know my name?
- Dinuccio's waiting.
- My bags are in the coach.
- Not any more.
- A ghost city for a ghost writer.
- You're so kind.
So, the contact man was a girl.
It was the first time I'd fancied Robin Hood. which wasn't healthy.
That made me think of Miller again.
- I'm so glad we bought you.
- We?
You haven 't met Preston yet.
- Preston?
- He's my sugar daddy.
And you have a sweet tooth, eh?
The sweetest.
Her mouth was wet and warm.
She moved against me, a perfect fit.
I could feel the fire in her loins.
It was scalding warm and wanting to be fanned.
Her tongue went deep.
It was alive, wet and very shocking.
I had visions of refueling in space.
Come on! I've got more things to show you. There are many important things.
Come! Follow me. Follow me.
Behind these doors are things that are not to the eye of ladies or children.
The people of Zonk made rude things on these walls.
Things haven 't changed much in 2,000 years.
Which brings us back to sugar daddy.
Who is he?
Preston Gilbert?
Is he still alive?
Mario!
Mario! I'm done!
Mario! You gone to sleep again, you bastard!
I'm getting barbecued in here!
So, you're his third cousin removed?
I was hitch-hiking around Europe and he gave me a lift.
I'm sure he did.
It's not like that. I feel sorry for him.
He's an old man.
With an old bank account.
He was on top a long time.
Now, he misses the excitement.
The parties and the bright lights, all that bullshit.
He keeps me like his court jester.
So you tickle his funny bone.
Tell me, how long ago was it he left Hollywood?
About 15 years ago.
Just a minute...
I'm getting some very bad vibrations.
Wasn't there talk of Mafia connections?
Talk.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't his roles on and off screen get slightly confused?
But that happens to all actors.
But with one big difference.
He always played the same role.
Don 't you see I'm burnt?
When I holler Mario...
Mario, that is your name!
Remember your name!
Keep that thing on so you can hear me and the other thing in your ear.
- I'm not paying good money...
- Sorry, boss.
Don 't talk "sorry boss" till I finish.
I'm not paying for you to sit on your arse and sleep.
Don 't stand so close to me!
Don 't ever stand close to me!
Now, get in here!
I'm gonna sweat you down to size, buster.
Go on, get in there! That's right.
Get in there and stay in there!
You see this. When you come out of there, you'll be this tall.
Why didn't Gilbert get me on the phone instead of all this mystery tour crap?
He enjoys playing life-size chess.
Filthy pictures from temple of Zonk, signore.
He's a two-bit blown -out film star, not God.
Don 't lose your cool, ghost writer.
Think of the bread you're making.
- Are these on the walls in there?
- Sì, signore.
- The League of Decency would love this.
- Sex wasn't dirty then.
You want, you want, signore?
No, no, I'm too young. Besides, these fellows give me an inferiority complex.
- But, signore...
- Remember what I said about Gilbert?
Miller was too dead to agree, but he would have done.
- Who is Miller?
- Just a man who was knifed in my room.
- What's that got to do with Preston?
- I'll tell you when I've found out.
Bodies belong in the mortuary, not in my bath.
You shouldn't be surprised, darling.
After all, you are the ghost writer.
What's this, then? The family runabout?
- Never use that word, Mickey.
- What word?
Family! Nice to see you, hop aboard.
OK, Tony, take us for a ride.
So it's Preston Gilbert.
Big mouth! I was supposed to tell him.
I was getting in very deep.
Things were moving too fast to bail out.
I've been with Preston for 32 years.
I started as a gofer.
Let's go for coffee, go for this, go for that.
After nine years, he made me a partner.
Gilbert was one of the screen 's immortal mobsters,
hero-worshipped and imitated around the world.
The way he talked and acted, beating up the big boys, manhandling the women, appealed to audiences everywhere.
His father was a nothin', a real nothin', a small time gonzo that disappeared when Preston was three.
Personally, I think he wound up as an automobile fender.
That made me feel nervous.
Inside most men is a tough guy trying to get out.
The book on Gilbert was certain to make money, a lot of money.
That made me feel good.
I remember...
He used to send a broad, after his first date,
11 yellow tea roses with a card which said,
"The 12th is you. "
He didn't get that from no screen script.
He had class.
Buffed every leading lady he worked with.
Don 't worry,
Tony knows every bump in the road.
Gilbert's place was on a small, exclusive island, a kind of rich man 's Alcatraz.
Home sweet home, Mickey.
Home sweet home.
I didn't feel so good.
Preston!
Mr Gilbert was born here, went to the States with his uncle when he was 12.
Oh, there's his mother.
Brought her here when he came back.
Hi, Mrs Stompanato. Where's Preston?
She loves it. Hasn't known herself since she's come back.
Brought her out after years on the breadline.
Preston still must be changing. I'll take you up.
A tip. As soon as you get in, sit down.
He's here, Preston.
Hiya, Mick.
Good luck, kid. Chin up.
Stiff upper lip.
Sit down!
Make yourself at home.
Sure, Mick, I knew all the boys in the old days.
Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, yeah, Bugs Moran.
You bet I did.
Yeah, Mick, they...
...they all loved me.
They all loved me. Why shouldn't they?
What the hell. On the screen
I gave 'em class, didn't I?
So, how come I didn't win an Oscar?
Hey, do me a favour, will you?
Change the record, please.
Put on one of the old ones.
I like the old ones...
That immigration department. They're tougher than any hoods or gangsters I ever worked for.
Mick, they're nothing but a bunch of hypocrites.
They waited until I was a little on in years, had a little mileage, then they went after me.
When I was asked to leave the country, do you think the fans gave a damn?
Like hell they did. That's what hurt.
I couldn't go to a club throughout the US, all over,
Chicago, Cleveland, you name it, without some idiot taking a swipe at me, trying to hit me in the jaw.
Well, that's the fans for you.
You do them a favour living out their fantasies, and they get jealous.
Gangsters weren't the only guys I knew, Mick.
Jack Kennedy, I knew him.
He wasn't no gangster. He was a pal of mine.
Look what happened to him.
Sure, I've gotta admit it, Mickey.
I worked for a lot of the big boys before I went to Hollywood.
What the hell?
I figured, I'd paid my debt to society.
I was killed in over 80 movies, wasn't I?
Ah! Hello, Mickey! Glad you could come over.
Sit down, son.
It's gonna be a great book.
It's gonna be a real great book, I'll tell you that.
You hungry? Come on with me, I'll feed you.
No, they're nice people.
Simple, but they understand after a while.
Somebody wonders why you live with 'em.
I was actually born here.
I went to the States when I was four.
There's my old mother.
Hello, Mama. Hello, sweetheart.
Can 't hear a thing. Deaf as a doornail.
Hello, hello, you big long-legged whore, you!
All right. Hey, Benny!
Has Mama eaten this week?
Come on, come on down!
Hurry up! Let's eat.
You get a great appetite with this weather.
We serve good grub, too.
Wait till you see what we have.
Anything you want. You'd be surprised.
We got coffee, pastrami.
I had some flown in last week.
Come on, Benny, move it! I'm hungry.
Move your ass, before I'm too old to enjoy this meal. I'm kinda hungry.
You hungry, bitch?
She's a beauty.
Dear Lord, bless this meal we're about to receive in Christ's name. Amen.
Surprise you, Mickey?
I'm a good Catholic.
- Liz, like to hop in the sack with him?
- Oh, Preston.
"Oh, Preston". Don 't give me that shit!
Been trying to make her for over a year.
But I ain 't been able to score.
Mama must have heard me say grace, at least.
Look at her go. Sit down, Mama.
Mick...
Some idiot's been trying to rub me.
Really... Who?
Who? Obviously a professional contract.
Guy goes under the name of Miller.
And I suppose he teaches English at Berkeley University.
- Why would you say that?
- I write crap like this every day, it's my job.
- He was murdered last night.
- Mama, you can...
He was murdered last night?
- Are you kidding me?
- Liz?
Damn right, he isn't.
Murdered last night!
- Benny, did you hear that?
- I heard.
They finally squashed that bastard.
I don 't have to worry or say my prayers any more.
- What?
- I'll explain later.
I want you to write that book.
Forget her. She doesn't speak English.
I'll give you all that shit about the old days.
And look!
Every book starts with a quotation.
My book should, too. Let's see... How's this?
"We've all... " Yeah, this is it.
"We've all passed a lot of water since then. "
Samuel Goldwyn.
Gilbert certainly wasn't tight with the dialogue.
He talked non -stop for a week.
Enough for a fat book.
But he never mentioned Miller again.
The mainland trip was to be an end-of-book party. Some party!
Dinuccio had a premonition the ferry would sink and refused to come,
Mama had a visitation from the Virgin and wouldn't get out of bed,
and the scar on my leg screamed at me not to go.
Jesus, I feel marvelous.
I hope it lasts.
- You don 't have to worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.
Nothing.
- What's the matter?
- It's a wound in my leg.
The war?
No. A coffin fell on me.
- Was it empty?
- No, it was full.
There was another thing about that day.
It was the anniversary of his father's death.
A date they now share.
Somaro. Come back, somaro. Better.
Keep it, keep it!
I meant together!
Bravo!
So, you're Mickey King?
Superstar's Boswell. Did he tell you about me?
If you're Lon Chaney, yes.
I've been married five times.
All hard bitches. She was my third.
You should meet the other four.
Betty's my name.
- You're the one that's married to Prince...
... Cippola.
You know, you're my very first princess.
Am I?
- I bet that was a fairy tale romance.
- On the contrary.
The prince is very hetero.
Isn't that right, superstar?
- Isn't he big in the New Front?
- Of course.
But he was a Christian Democrat when I married him.
Yeah. That does make a difference.
Do you like being a politician 's wife?
- Kissing babies and all that.
- I don 't stop at babies.
- Are you canvassing me, princess?
- I can always use a floating voter.
- But I don 't have a title.
- King's good enough.
Come up to my castle some time.
This weekend's fine for me.
Betty!
What qualities did you need to be a princess?
Only one.
I'm very good in bed.
So I've been told.
Hey, you guys!
Money, money, money.
Hit the bottom for that.
You know how I used to make my living?
- As a pimp.
- After that.
This will kill you. Watch.
Oh God, not again!
Not that same boring routine.
- He does it every year.
- What?
His party bit. It's embarrassing.
- Why do you come if it's that bad?
- I never miss his father's anniversary.
Never.
Watch it!
We didn't order spaghetti, did we?
We didn't order spaghetti.
- You didn't order spaghetti?
- No!
Madame, I'm so sorry.
You didn't order spaghetti.
I'm so sorry. You don 't like my spaghetti?
You don 't like my father?
- I have nothing to do with him.
- But with my spaghetti.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, madame. Excuse me.
- We've had enough!
Everybody's had enough. The boss is gonna take me to the cleaners.
What you think he's gonna do?
I'm in trouble up to here.
Would you like a banana split? Brandy?
Don 't worry.
You ain 't gonna get nothing if you order it.
I'll take care of the check.
Look, honey, it's all fun.
It's all fun, lady. It's all fun.
Gilbert was proud of being the practical joker. He could afford to be.
Suddenly, it hit me like a bad tomato.
I was top billing in his latest production.
Only it wasn't a comedy. That made me angry.
Sorry, sir.
Signore. signora, I am the manager.
Champagne on the house.
- The waiter - weak in the bladder. I've fired him.
- Please don 't do that.
He has 30 children. He'll never be lonely.
- You all right, signore?
- Fine.
Excuse me.
- Everything all right, signore?
- The humour is a little rough.
In Hollywood, I put all those slobs on.
They paid me to put people down.
Rib 'em a bit. Some nights I'd make 50 bucks!
Those were the days, huh?
Mickey, there's a lot you don 't know about me.
- Oh, I believe you.
- Don 't get smart with me, son.
- You're full of crap, Gilbert.
- No.
- No, cancer.
- Of the soul.
- Yet another funny.
- Oh, it's ture. It's the truth.
The doctors gave me the good news a week ago.
That's why I wanted you to finish the book quickly.
You're taking me for an idiot, like those two poor bastards over there.
Miller, the coach trip, everything was rigged.
Well, stuff your book up your arse. I'm quitting.
You are, eh?
- Mr Gilbert.
- Yes, what?
Not again.
 For he's a jolly good fellow
 For he's a jolly good fellow
 And so say all of us
 And so say all of us
Hey, Preston!
Stop kidding. The joke's over.
Suddenly, I was a cop lover.
They couldn't keep me at that station long enough.
I needed time to think and a safe place to do it.
The killer had tried to get me.
It wasn't a joke.
Gilbert didn't laugh once, all the way to the mortuary.
It was like a casting session for Boys Town.
Any ring a bell, Mr King?
The American made me nervous.
He'd arrived late in the afternoon.
I assumed he was FBI. Things were serious if the big guns had been called in.
The one on the right.
Acca.
- No, not acca. "G".
- "G".
Are you sure?
I think so.
Says he's chaplain to the nuns at St Lorenzo Maggiore.
Mean anything to you?
Is it a discotheque?
Not my scene then.
They all look the same to me.
Where did you pick him up?
A brothel in Via Alphonso.
Somebody died, huh?
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.
- I'd like a word.
- All right.
Next day, Liz and I returned to Gilbert's villa.
I had some questions for Dinuccio.
I found him in mourning, drinking Black Velvet.
I told the boss not to go.
- He wouldn't listen, would he?
- I'm listening, Ben.
Where did Killer Mark II spring from?
Mama took off as soon as she heard.
Back to the cave.
Don 't change the subject.
- Who's after me?
- A priest, Mickey boy.
He wants to read you the last sacrament.
He's putting you on, ghost writer.
- He doesn't know.
- Did sugar daddy?
- We're so upset, aren't we?
- Don 't call him that.
Try saccharine.
It should help the withdrawal symptoms.
You're still trying to fit the pieces together.
Some writer.
Maybe Agatha Christie's free.
- Preston never told you about the scandal?
- What scandal?
- You owe me ten bucks, Liz.
- The bastard copped out.
They'll kill him anyway.
Now just a minute, you two.
- Are you talking about me?
- Relax. We'll protect you.
Thanks. You come highly recommended by
Preston Gilbert, who's dead in the mortuary.
Not to mention his two companions, a Neopolitan singer and an accordion player.
Now, you tell me exactly what you were talking about.
Preston and some guy got involved in a scandal a long time ago.
It was hushed up.
When Preston announced he was going to write his life story, the guy got nervous.
- Who did?
- Preston would never tell us.
We thought he'd told you.
The priest still does.
Any more questions, Mickey boy?
Jesus! The priest.
He shoots very well for a public relations man.
What's going wrong, boss?
- Did I get him?
- Yes.
How do I join the other side?
Do you have to run it this way?
Don 't blame me.
You shot the projectionist.
- Who the hell's that?
- It's a flying nun.
- That couldn't be him?
- If it is, I'm the Pope.
I was marked "poison".
I was the fall guy, the sitting duck.
I was trapped.
There was nothing I could do but co-operate with these schmucks.
We had to find the priest before he gave me the big absolution.
We ran Liz's film, Batman Visits Zonk.
There was a chance
I might recognise the killer.
Who's that nut?
- That is an eccentric Englishman.
- Like Jack the Ripper?
My confidence took another beating.
They shot film worse than they shot guns.
That only left craps.
Should do great in Australia.
I'll rewind it.
- You wanna see it right side up?
- No, it'll only confuse me.
Are you sure you used the foolproof automatic camera?
Sure, I'm sure.
Takes a special kind of genius to screw that up.
That's probably Gilbert to tell you he's arrived safely.
Don 't fool around.
- I believe in the hereafter.
- You need to, the way you shoot.
Pronto. Si. sono Dinuccio.
Benissimo.
Aspetta. un momento.
He wants to talk to you.
- Who wants to speak to me?
- Il mago di Ferrugia. The wizard of Ferrugia.
- Are you putting me on?
- No, he's a fortune teller.
Preston told me about him.
So, what am I supposed to do?
Raise myself to the ceiling unaided?
He says he's talked to the boss.
Wants to tell you something big.
I know.
A fat lady is gonna cross my path, keel over and crush me to death.
I think he may have a hotline up there.
I'm gonna make an appointment for you.
Bene. domani mattina.
I didn't sleep that night.
The Wizard ringing in gave me indigestion.
It was just as well.
My doorknob was being turned.
Very slowly.
One more move and I shoot.
- Hello, I'm the Lone Star Ranger.
- And I'm Buck Jones.
When 's your birthday, Buck?
Don 't give me all that astrology crap.
I only wanted to buy you a birthday present.
A nightshirt.
I flipped off the light and showed her the door. I had my pride.
Move over.
Next morning, I went to meet the clairvoyant outside Dante's barbershop.
Dinuccio promised his friends would be there to protect me.
He seemed to have a lot of friends.
It's difficult to tell these days.
I got there early, took a shave and waited for the clairvoyant.
- Good morning. Yes?
- Shave.
He was wearing a dirty mackintosh.
Clairvoyants usually do.
They make up for it with ritzy titles like wizard, oracle, magician.
They do OK, living off people's fears and superstitions.
Signor King? Doctor Duce.
I felt uneasy.
He had eyes like bloodshot oysters.
I feel hostility. You don 't trust me.
I make predictions.
You'll see they come true.
December, Queen of England catch cold.
January, riots in Japan.
Many people go to Australia.
February, the Pope gets cold.
Preston Gilbert, when did he catch cold?
Someone tried to kill him.
He wants to know when.
- You told him?
- Sure. Yesterday.
He kept the date.
- What else?
- He give me something to get feelings from.
- What thing?
- Signor Gilbert didn't pay his last money.
- Oh, really? How much?
- Five.
- Five.
- Money.
- You mean you want the money now?
I give you good value.
May, trouble in Africa.
June, plenty people leave Australia.
July, pilgrims see vision of General de Gaulle at Lourdes.
Hold it... Hold it.
The Preston Gilbert do-it-yourself-thriller-kit.
Inside were the things Gilbert had given the clairvoyant to get psychic feelings from.
A photograph of a hunting party taken about ten years before.
Gilbert I recognised.
The others were just faces. Anybody's.
The address of a man in Mondragone, a village near the coast.
And the faded newspaper photo of a girl, with the name torn away.
What the fortune teller could get from that pile of junk, God only knew.
- Who was in the hunting squad?
- Signor Gilbert not tell me nothing.
- What did Gilbert want with you?
- He wants to know who killed him.
- And the girl?
- I know nothing.
- I say goodbye.
- And I say hello.
- And the girl, Wizard?
- The girl is dead!
She looked like a distant relative of Rocky Marciano.
Her honour was on the missing list.
So was her cash.
It was too late to retrieve either.
Things were beginning to look up.
I had some leads to follow.
An address and the photo of a dead girl.
That brought me back to the late Preston Gilbert.
- The wake's at our place.
- Preston will be pleased.
His face rang a bell, a warning bell.
I'd seen it staring at me from a thousand posters all over town.
But I'd also seen it somewhere else.
- Is that Cippola?
- Yes.
That's when it hit me.
Cippola was one of the men with
Preston Gilbert in the hunting photo.
That was only the start.
There was more to come.
Banker, tailor, soldier, sailor.
They were all in the photograph.
- Who are all these others?
- They used to shoot together.
With him or at him?
Now I knew how the princess had met her prince - on a boar hunt with Gilbert.
Cippola and the film star had been friends until Betty switched beds.
Preston couldn't have liked that.
Three wives down and two to go.
At last the jigsaw was fitting together.
See you later.
But there was still one important piece missing.
The one that explained why these pillars of the establishment were so nervous of Gilbert talking.
What was the scandal that worried the law and order brigade?
I decided to cut out of the funeral and follow up the address given me by my oyster-eyed friend.
The cock crowing made me uneasy.
It was too near Easter for comfort.
A beer.
Mr Lepri?
The whole town seemed to be in the grip of a fatal disease - lockjaw.
I took my beer outside and wondered what it was like here on Sundays.
The air in that place had the musty smell of dried-up dreams.
It was a ghost town, second class.
Two crossed coffins in the Michelin guide.
The old man fixed me with his eyes. We dialled each other's numbers and got through.
He looked like a retired gunman who drew too late... twice.
He knew that I knew he'd never play the fruit machines again.
I began to wish I'd stayed with the funeral.
I looked at the stranger and knew that nobody'd believe me.
Mr Lepri?
- Do you speak English?
- A little.
- Would you like a drink?
- No.
Who told you that Signor Lepri lived here?
Someone in the city.
And what do you want from Signor Lepri?
Business.
He don 't live here for ten years.
- Are you American?
- English.
I fought with partisans during war.
Where did Lepri go?
- You know why he go?
- No.
Come with me.
As a driver, the stranger left much to be desired. Another arm, for a start.
Every time he changed gear, my suntan vanished.
- You know, I'm a mayor of town.
- Oh, really?
- Where are we going?
- I will show you. I'm a communist.
- Are you a communist?
- No.
- What are you?
- I am an imperialist lackey.
You see, Mama, right on top til the end.
The artist got 5,300 bucks for this. Used the stills from Angels Never Die as the model.
You like it, Mama?
Hell of a work of art, ain 't it, Mama?
The beach was too remote for tourists.
The sand was golden and the sea blue, but I missed the smell of sun oil and frying flesh.
It was a long way from my own backyard, and a deck chair marked "King".
- That's why Signor Lepri left.
- That?
His daughter Silvana found here dead, all naked.
Is this her?
- You know her?
- No, not who she was.
Buried in the sand here.
A shepherd find her, early in the morning.
It's windy. He sees her hand waving.
- How did she die?
- Heart.
- A heart attack?
- Yes.
"Hunting party in gang-bang".
The headline hit me right between the legs.
I remembered it from years ago. The girl had been found dead in mysterious circumstances.
There were rumours of orgies in a nearby hunting lodge, but the stories had fizzled out.
- Not murdered?
- No.
It all fitted. The girl's heart had given way under the strain.
Cippola, Gilbert and the others must have panicked and buried her here.
The picture was almost complete, only one face was missing.
The one who ordered the priest.
Did the police find out who buried her here?
Never.
- Do you know?
- Yes.
- Who?
- Capitalisti.
And Lepri left soon afterwards?
Him very ashamed of his daughter.
He get much money from someone and left village to go to north.
Where did the money come from?
He never tell. He paid to keep quiet.
He was such a good communist.
Now he's a fascista.
I got shot.
- That's tomato ketchup.
- I got shot.
- Who?
- I'll tell you later. Come on.
Come on!
Make for the truck.
Let me show you.
Thank God you're mechanically minded.
- Can you drive?
- No.
Sod off, nanny. Sod off!
That costume might just get you through those pearly gates, but I doubt it.
Remember that thou art pulp, and unto pulp thou shalt return.
A fitting epitaph for Jack Francis Miller, priest, lecturer and drag queen.
I looked across the beach for help. No one.
A sudden pain bit deep into my leg: I'd been hit.
Blood was pouring out like a burst water main.
Isank to the sand, ripping my shirt off as I went.
It was a present from my wife. That shirt saved my life, which wouldn't have pleased her.
I used it as a tourniquet, it was like turning off a tap.
I dragged myself across to Miller's body.
A present for you, Mama. From me.
Scream in the Dark. On the Run.
Cold Sweat - that's the one.
One more move, Fatso, and I'll pump you full of lead.
Beautiful, ain 't it, Mama?
You like it? I knew you'd like it, Mama.
You need six cents. I'll always have 'em for you in a sack on the coffin.
- I thought you'd appreciate it.
- Cold sweat!
Hello, ladies. Are you enjoying yourselves?
I'm so glad you could come.
- What kind of a bird is that?
- The Maltese falcon.
I'll get you, you bastards.
Look, everyone.
He's killed a priest.
- And how are we today?
- Mind your own business.
What's the matter with him?
You're sick.
They were caught literally with their pants down.
The girl died on them.
- How do you know?
- I know.
They thought that Gilbert had talked to me.
- That's why they tried to murder both of us.
- You're heading for an asylum, buddy.
You really think they'd kill just because they made a girl? That's no crime.
For some people it is.
Why would a creepy, old politician like Cippola jump on the law and order bandwagon?
He'd really be sick if this scandal ever broke cover.
Mr King, I'd forget that if I were you.
- What?
- Just forget it.
You go around talking that kind of crap, and you'll really rock the boat.
A lot of important people are involved. Drop it.
Piss off.
If you don 't, I'm gonna get them to put you on a murder rap.
- Yeah? Whose murder?
- Miller.
How? Reckless driving?
You know I never murdered Miller.
- So?
- You bastard.
That's the way it is, bright eyes.
Just like a house of cards.
Pull one away, the lot falls.
I've been told to make sure you just don 't do that. So shut up and enjoy yourself.
Come back here, you little bitch.
I wanna kick your teeth in.
Come on back, you coward!
Mr King, you should learn to control yourself.
The doctor says you'll have to stay here a bit, till you're completely recovered.
Take his advice, will you?
They're nice people. Respectable. Get me?
Nurse! Quickly please, nurse!
Nurse!
- What do you call them again?
- Proofs.
Read them to us, darling.
He reads his own work so beautifully.
Don 't you agree?
"I slammed my fist into his face as hard as I could.
There was the sound of crunching bone.
Blood splattered everywhere like a burst water main, stop.
I swung round and found myself looking at prince Cippola, and the bottomless black eyes of a hunting...
Black thoughts were transmitted.
I put my hand on her... "
Excuse me.
I'm going to the cave to see how Mama is.
"I rolled over, gripping the aristocrat's boot as I went, stop.
He toppled like a stone statue.
I lashed out at him.
When the prince bounced on the ground he was dead, stop.
And his blood wasn't blue, stop.
It was the same as yours and mine.
I felt better, stop.
That's all I remember.
Chapter 13.
Outside I hailed a cab. Its tyres screeched on the hot tarmac as it drew up.
'Follow that car', I said, leaping in. "
Where do you get your ideas from, Mickey?
I'll get the bastards yet.
I wish my leg didn't itch.
Right, yeah. Hungry, huh?
OK, one dinner coming right up.
Three o'clock in the morning,
I gotta get up and get you some food.
Come on, kitty.
I don't got none.
You want some peanut butter?
Coury Brand cat food.
I see empty cans, empty cans.
Let's fix you up one of my famous concoctions.
Wait a second. Don't get so hungry.
Here you go. Mm. That'll be delicious.
Yeah. You can't do better than that at Chasen's.
Come on. You're hungry, right?
Think of all the tigers in India they're killing cos they don't get enough to eat.
Don't believe that one, huh? OK, OK, OK.
Coury's Brand cat food.
You clawed me, you son of a bitch.
Why don't you go home to India?
Wanna help me with my jacket?
Why don't you go and tell those girls they're gonna catch a cold?
Coury's Brand cat food. Yeah.
Cat gets me up at three in the morning to get a special kind of food.
I gotta be outta my fucking mind.
That cockamamie cat.
Mr Marlowe? Mr Marlowe.
Crazy girls.
Mr Marlowe, are you going by the store?
Yeah, I'm gonna pick up a couple of cans of cat food.
Could you pick me up some brownie mix?
- I'll get you some brownie mix.
- Get two boxes. The fudge kind.
- Fudge kind and regular kind.
- You're the nicest neighbour we ever had.
Gotta be the nicest neighbour.
I'm a private eye. It's OK with me.
# There's a long goodbye
# And it happens every day...
Hi, Mr Lennox. You're up kind of late.
Come on, lay it on me.
I been working on Barbara Stanwyck.
I'll show you.
I don't understand.
I don't understand it at all.
I've never understood it. I just don't understand why I don't understand at all.
You're gonna be all right.
# There's a long goodbye
# And it happens every day
# When some passer-by
# Invites your eye
# To come his way
# Even as he smiles a quick hello
# You've let him go,
you've let the moment fly
- Mr Marlowe, the lights in your car are on.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot.
# Can you recognise the theme?
# On some other street
# Two people meet
# As in a dream
# Running for a plane through the rain
Two for the price of one.
Super buy. Extra discount.
21 cents for macaroni.
# They could be lovers
# Until they die
# It's too late to try
# When a missed hello
# Becomes a long...
Never seen so many cat foods in my...
Excuse me.
I don't see any Coury Brand cat food.
- Some what?
- Coury Brand cat food.
- Can you spell it for me, please?
- Yeah. Coury Brand. C-o-u-r...
We're out of that. Why don't you get this?
All this shit is the same anyway.
- You don't happen to have a cat?
- What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.
Ha-ha
He's got a girl and I got a cat.
# There's a long goodbye
# And it happens every day
# When some passer-by
# Invites your eye
# To come her way
# Even as she smiles a quick hello
# You let her go, you let the moment fly
# Too late you turn your head
- Did you get the brownie mix?
- Uh-huh. Yeah, I got you two boxes.
What kind did you get?
Regular and the brownie mix with the double fudge.
- Fantastic!
- Night, girls.
- How much do we owe you?
- Just put it on the bill.
- Thanks.
- Mr Marlowe, I'll save you a brownie.
Thanks a lot, but they hurt my teeth.
But if you wanna make me a couple of Yankee Doodles...
Oh, the cat's hungry. Right, right.
Did I lock you out of the kitchen?
I'll fix your dinner just as soon as I get me a smoke.
Right, here you are.
Coury Brand, the finest I could find.
Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes.
I'll open this thing up right away.
Don't want you not to have your favourite kind of cat food.
OK, OK.
Look at this. Mm-hm!
Well? Go on, there it is.
So it's not Coury's cat food.
It's OK with me.
Don't run out on me now, you son of a b... cat. Come on.
- Marlowe.
- Terry, come on in. I'll be right there.
What am I doing at this hour?
Terry Lennox.
Hey, Terry. I was just feeding my cat.
You oughta be feeding your cat too.
What happened?
Beauty, isn't it?
Proud of that son of a bitch.
- You and Sylvia going at it again?
- Yeah. Like to hear the sordid details?
No, I've heard 'em before.
You like to lose a couple of bucks?
Oh, man.
- I got an L.
- L?
D. Four sevens.
You really think I believe you got four sevens?
- You probably think I don't have any.
- Yeah.
Then I gotta say five sevens.
- I challenge.
- Challenge. How many you got?
- None.
- None, yeah. I got three. That's good.
- Who were the three DiMaggio brothers?
- Vince, Dom and...
- Joe?
- Joltin' Joe, yeah.
Want me to fix up the couch for you tonight?
Well, Marlowe, that's what I'm here to talk to you about.
- I really need more than that.
- You wanna sleep in my bed?
There's gonna be a lot of people looking for me as a result of my lovely wife.
- I really need a ride.
- Where do you want me to take you?
- Tijuana.
- Tijuana?
- Tijuana now?
- Yeah. Tijuana.
- Thanks, Marlowe.
- You take care of yourself.
Don't worry about me.
- Vaya con dios.
- Thanks a lot.
- Arizona.
- Phoenix.
- Kansas.
- City.
- How about Michigan?
- Detroit? Milwaukee?
Right on.
Your turn.
- Montana.
- Montana, Montana... Billings.
- Florida.
- Miami.
- Right.
- How about Washington?
- Washington DC?
- Girls, did you see my cat?
- I didn't even know you had a cat.
- Did you say you wanted a hat?
No, you don't look fat.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Is your name Marlowe?
- No, Sidney... Jenkins.
Let's go inside. We wanna talk to you.
- I'm looking for my cat.
- Forget the goddamn cat.
Forget the goddamn cat? I see.
OK. That cat means an awful lot to me.
You tell me to forget about it.
Must be something mighty important.
- Sit down, Marlowe.
- I'd rather stand.
- I don't mind sitting.
- I'm Sergeant Green. Detective Dayton.
I saw your badge. Where's his?
Where did you go last night, Marlowe?
Is this where I say
"What is all this about?"
And he says
"Shut up, I ask the questions"?
That's right, so just answer the questions.
Where did you go last night?
Maybe if I knew why you wanted to know,
I could remember.
- Are you gainfully employed, Marlowe?
- I don't know.
- Where do you work?
- I heard you. I understand English.
I'm a private detective. I have my own agency. Those girls are vicious.
I take a better picture now, but business hasn't been as good as it used to be.
You know a white guy by the name of Terry Lennox.
Who says I do?
His address book, and that yellow bomb downstairs in your garage.
- So?
- Marlowe, just answer the question.
You wanna know what I did last night?
My cat woke me up in the middle of the night. He was really hungry.
I went to fix him his favourite cat food,
Coury Brand, the only kind he eats.
I was out of it, so I picked something else up and the cat clawed the hell out of me.
So I went out to the Thriftymart - it's open
24 hours - to get Coury Brand cat food, and they were out of Coury Brand cat food, son of a bitch.
So I got a couple of other cans.
I came back and I switched the labels.
- The son of a bitch cat just left...
- Will you forget the goddamn cat?
- Coury Brand cat food?
- You got any?
We know what time Terry Lennox left the
Malibu Colony and what time he got here.
Your girlfriends were so busy making hash pies, they didn't notice anything.
- What the hell is this, Marlowe?
- It's a baby shoe.
Lennox left his car in your garage and then he went somewhere.
Since you went somewhere also, it would seem logical that you went somewhere together.
Suppose you tell me where.
I don't have to answer any questions you ask unless you have a specific charge.
So if you don't have a specific charge,
I'd appreciate it if you'd just go on down...
Dayton, do we have a specific charge against Marlowe?
- Goddammit.
- We do now.
- Marlowe, if you broke my partial...
- Come on. Your partial!
- Get up.
- You're not gonna pull this shit, are you?
- Read it to him.
- You gonna read something to me?
- You have the right to remain silent...
- My rights. I got a lot of rights.
- You got any cotton candy?
- Right profile.
Right profile.
Is there a merry-go-round around here?
- Straight ahead.
- Straight ahead.
My, my. You are a pretty asshole.
- My mother always tells me that.
- Let's get some prints.
- Right here.
- Thank you.
- We have a room for you.
- You got a towel to wipe this off?
- Use your shirt.
- This is my good shirt.
- You'll all be together in paradise.
- Thank you.
They got you too, huh, man?
How's your cat?
- Ran away. How's your girl?
- She got busted at a protest rally.
I had to bust the pig that busted her, man.
Come on. Come on, goddammit.
- He's all yours.
- I bought some cat food.
This is question and answer time.
Sit down. Sit down!
Sit down, Mr Marlowe. Don't dirty up our joint. Sit down, right here.
What's your name?
My name? Donald Duck.
You know my name.
- What's your name?
- My name is Philip Marlowe.
He's a real cutie pie, Lieutenant.
- A smart ass, that's what he is.
- That's what I meant.
Why don't you learn to say what you mean?
He's a real smart ass, Lieutenant.
Hi, boys. Who's in there?
J Edgar Hoover's in there?
Sure. They're all peeping through.
- With an E? You got an E on your name?
- Yeah.
- That sounds like a fag name.
- Is that what you are?
I'm a fag, but anybody called
Philip Marlowe has gotta be a fag.
- Sounds like an Exeter Academy fag.
- Right, right.
What are you here for, Marlowe?
I'm getting ready for the big game
Saturday. We're playing Notre Dame.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm getting into my make-up.
You got a banjo?
I'll do my Al Jolson routine.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm getting ready to sing "Swanee".
- Sure, I get it. Al Jolson.
- He was OK.
Damn right he was OK.
But what the hell are we doing here?
- Just sweating.
- You don't tie in. This suit, the name.
- What are you from, a prep school?
- It was a long time ago.
- No, I never went to a prep school.
- No, you don't look like prep school.
But that's not important. You'd better have the right answers when Farmer gets here.
Here's your man, Lieutenant.
A real cutie pie.
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- You're looking very good. Sit down.
We don't want you banged up. Somebody might get the wrong impression.
Tell me, Marlowe, why can't you answer one simple question?
I don't like the way you ask questions and I don't know what you wanna know.
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah.
He's the cutie pie, Lieutenant.
You're the smart ass, you little honky bastard.
- I'll throw the book at you.
- What's the charges?
Don't give me that innocent crap.
You expect me to believe that Terry Lennox showed up, you drove him someplace and he didn't tell you?
- That's what I've been telling you.
- You wanna hear the charges? OK.
- Accessory after the fact of murder.
- Who's dead?
- Aiding a felon in unlawful flight.
- Who's dead?
Terry Lennox's wife, that's who's dead.
And not a nice dead.
- I don't believe it.
- She's dead. That's obvious.
- So what don't you believe?
- That Terry Lennox could kill her.
You don't believe he could beat a woman to death?
- How long have you known him?
- A long time.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- A long time.
- From college?
- I didn't go to college.
So you didn't go to college.
What was his real name?
- You guys know his real name.
- We know, but you tell me.
Lenny Potts.
It wasn't fancy enough, so he changed it.
Fancy?
Fancy my ass!
The man's a gambler, a hood, thick as thieves with Marty Augustine.
So what does that mean?
He was always splitting up with his wife.
- He loved his wife.
- Was she cheating on him?
Are you cheating on your wife?
Maybe. But my wife's not dead.
Was he cheating on her?
Is your wife cheating on you?
How come you know so little about your dear old pal? Or are you dummying up?
Last night what did he tell you?
That he was in a jam with his gambling associates?
That he was fighting with his wife again?
What excuse did he give you?
The hell with it. Take him out. Book him.
- Fuck you!
- Stand in line, baby.
Come on.
While I was waiting for my dog to come back, we just went in, we went to the
Saugus Cafe and decided to toss a few.
We were getting out, and I get in my car, I get my dog, and we're riding down Lankershim...
There are more cops on
Lankershim Boulevard than in this place.
So I go down, I see the red lights behind me and I figure: OK. So I pull over.
- Cat comes up to the car and he says...
- OK, Marlowe. On your feet.
- Keep it clean, Socrates.
- Great. Thanks a lot.
So, anyway...
Get dressed, Marlowe.
You're not coming back.
- Know what they got in here now?
- It's about time.
- They got people that smoke marijuana.
- Aren't you afraid your lips will fall off?
Possession's what you get in here for.
Possession of noses, of gonads, of life.
Someday all the pigs are gonna be in here and all the people are gonna be out there.
You can bet on that. You're not in here. It's just your body. See you when you get out.
- Hands on the counter.
- But I already...
- Philip Marlowe, over here.
- What's going on?
- Sign the card.
- What is going on, please?
- You're free.
- I was free to begin with.
Is anybody gonna explain why my ass has been in there for three days?
Could you tell me something?
Is Lieutenant Farmer around?
Wait a second. Farmer. They're just now letting me free. I appreciate that.
Could you explain to me what's happening?
We don't have any further use for you.
I know that, but did you drop the charges?
- Now we got all our answers.
- What happened?
Terry Lennox is dead, Marlowe.
The case is closed.
What do you mean, Terry Lennox is dead?
You're not gonna find anything in that.
Morgan, how you doing?
What'd they pick you up for?
I heard they were springing you.
Got a way to get home?
No. These mothers bring you here but they don't care about how you get back.
I'll give you a lift home. There's a few back issues you might be interested in.
Blew his brains out in a little godforsaken town in Mexico.
- He left a full confession.
- I'm reading it. Don't describe it to me too.
- I'm sorry, Marlowe.
- What are you sorry about?
- It's just another story to you.
- Sorry you're so stupid.
There you are sitting in the poky, taking lumps for a friend, and he lets you down.
- That's my problem.
- Stupid, Marlowe.
- There's a layout on you. Pictures and all.
- Yeah, I see.
This is gonna do wonders for my trade.
Otatoclan? Never heard of that.
Why kill himself in Otatoclan?
He could have done it in Tijuana.
Man at the end of his rope. Never know what the hell they're gonna do.
What happened to his body?
His wife's family didn't want any part of it.
For obvious reasons.
Doesn't have any family of his own.
So he's buried in Otatoclan.
Yeah, I get the picture. Case closed, all zippered up like a big bag of shit.
Terry wasn't at the end of his rope.
The way he talked,
Sylvia wasn't dead then either.
- I don't believe he killed her or himself.
- Everybody else does.
Hi, Marlowe.
- Where's Herbie?
- He's in the can.
You practising for the hit parade?
Gotta learn this goddamn thing.
Thinks it'll beef up the lunch trade.
I don't see anybody waiting in line.
As cheap as I work, he cannot lose.
Marlowe! Haven't seen you around for a few days.
- I've been out of town.
- Did you notice this?
- Got a new line of sandwiches in.
- You'll try anything, Herbie.
- How about lunch?
- Sandwiches? Never heard of them.
- I'll have a drink.
- What is it?
CC and ginger.
- You got any messages for me?
- I believe we've got a few over there.
As a matter of fact, you'll find my phone bill in there too.
I wouldn't worry about that.
# There's a long goodbye
# And it happens every day
# When some passer-by
# Invites your eye
# To come her way
# Even as she smiles a quick hello...
Hello. This is Philip Marlowe.
Mrs Roger Wade?
Excuse me, you got a pencil?
You're Mrs Wade?
It depends on the nature of the case.
I don't do any divorce work.
I understand.
Have you tried filing a missing persons report with the police?
I guess I could work it in.
When do you wanna meet?
That's OK with me.
You'd better give me your address.
The Malibu Colony.
Come on, Aster. I'm honking my horn.
You're supposed to get outta the way.
Want me to call a cop?
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hello there. What can I do for you?
I have an appointment with Mrs Roger Wade.
- What's her first name?
- Eileen.
- What's their address?
- Jimmy Stewart?
- Right. Go on in.
- Thanks.
Come in.
Mrs Wade?
It's OK. You're a nice dog. Mrs Wade!
Oh, shit. OK, I'll stand here.
Anything you say.
- Hello!
- Hello.
- Do come in.
- Your friend doesn't want me to.
In the kitchen, come on. Scoot!
- Will you forgive me while I make a call?
- Certainly.
Do sit down.
Dried apricot?
Hello? Could I speak to Mr Lernie, please?
Mr Lernie, this is Roger Wade's secretary.
I'm sorry. He's locked in his study writing and I can't disturb him now.
But I'll see that he gets your message.
You'll probably hear from him in the morning. Is that all right?
Yes. Yes, thank you, I will.
OK. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
That looks like my Thanksgiving Day dinner.
Philip Marlowe.
You don't look like your picture.
- Thank you.
- I'm Eileen Wade.
You don't look like a secretary. And if Mr
Wade is in his library, you don't need me.
My husband is not in the study. When he disappears, I try to cover up for him.
- Protecting his image you'd call it.
- He's done this sort of thing before?
Yes. My husband has a drinking problem.
Every so often he reaches a stage when he feels he needs professional help.
So he goes someplace to dry out.
Is there some particular place he likes to go?
Yes, but he's not there. I've checked every single place I could think of.
Didn't he tell you where he was going?
No. We're usually not speaking when he leaves.
- How long's he been gone?
- A week.
A week? Weren't you worried?
I mean, waiting a week before you call somebody to find your husband.
What are you implying, Mr Marlowe?
I don't mean to be tactless, but it doesn't look like you walked into a door.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I fell out of bed.
- I'm gonna need something to start on.
- You have. He's Roger Wade.
- Roger Wade. Big writer.
- He's a big man too.
Six foot five, weighs 220 pounds.
Once you've seen his face, you'll never forget it.
- Sounds like some kind of monster.
- Only when he drinks.
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.
- A cup of coffee?
- No. Let me get this straight.
This is different from some of the times he behaves this way but not different from all the times?
- That's right.
- Could you explain that to me?
I found this manuscript paper.
He started out writing something, and then he starts rambling on and on and on.
"Dr V, Dr V, Dr V.
You must help me, Dr V."
Do you know a Dr V?
I looked in the phone book under Doctors.
I never knew there were so many Vs.
Could you find my husband for me, please?
- Is Roger Wade his real name?
- Why?
If Roger Wade isn't his real name, he might be using his real name.
Actually, he did change his name.
His publishers thought Billy Joe Smith lacked something for the books he writes.
Roger Wade ain't exactly the ticket for the kind of book he writes either.
His publishers are happy.
That's all that matters.
Probably Smith's the name that most of
Dr V's clients use. Is that a picture of him?
I see what you mean about his face. Does he usually walk around in that costume?
We haven't talked about your fee.
I get 50 bucks a day and expenses.
Would you like an advance now?
I prefer an itemised accounting.
That way there's no misunderstanding.
- You'll be around if I have to call you?
- Sure. I'll be here.
The Lennoxes, Terry and Sylvia, used to live up the beach, did you know them?
Slightly, like one knows most people on the beach.
You put some ice on your bruise and I'll go find your husband.
May I help you, please?
I'm looking for a patient named Roger Wade.
- There's no one here with that name.
- He may not be using that name.
- Do you recognise this face?
- There's nobody that looks like that.
You look just like my Great Aunt Esther.
She passed on a couple of years ago.
- Is Dr Verringer around?
- Dr Verringer is out of town.
- In Phoenix.
- Phoenix, Arizona.
- May I ask who you are?
- Just some guy looking for Dr Verringer.
Those ladies are a lot of help.
Crazy ladies. It's OK with me.
- Excuse me, I'm looking for...
- Shh.
- It's OK with me, lady.
- Excuse me, I'm supposed to meet...
- Shh.
All I see is that old man's pants.
- I have this book for Roger Wade...
- Shh.
- Are you looking for someone?
- No, I'm gonna deliver this book.
- To whom are you delivering the book?
- The man who wrote it, Roger Wade.
But they told you there's no one here by that name.
- Good morning, Dr Verringer.
- They told me you weren't here either.
This is a private hospital.
I can't have strangers prowling about.
- I must ask you to leave.
- I hear you, Doctor.
Could you tell me the nature of your business here?
If Roger Wade isn't here, why do you care?
Are you sure he's at Verringer's?
Verringer denied being Verringer, pretended he didn't know your husband's name and wouldn't look at his picture.
So I'm reasonably sure that's where your husband is staying, but there is something we could do to make sure.
What's that?
If you came back there with me,
Dr Verringer couldn't dismiss you.
He'd just have to answer to you.
I don't have the guts to do that.
You got the guts to make that dog behave, but not to talk to a jerk like Verringer?
It's not Verringer. It's Roger.
He doesn't want me to find him or know why he's hiding out there.
What's he gonna do when I walk in?
That's all right. You're a stranger.
He's fine with strangers.
Dried apricot?
I didn't eat the one you gave me this afternoon. They give me diarrhoea.
Mrs Wade, what is it that you want me to do?
I want you to make sure he's all right, and try to bring him home if you can.
If you have any trouble, I'll back you up.
- But I don't think you're afraid of trouble.
- What makes you say that?
I looked at your picture in the paper and I liked what you did for my friend.
- Your friend?
- Your friend. What am I talking about?
And... I like your face too.
- I feel you're someone I can trust.
- You got me, lady.
That's far enough, Lucette.
You have to go back.
Thanks, Dom.
- Your favourite TV show is on. Come on.
- No. I have to vote.
- Have you voted yet?
- Yeah.
You can handle Lucette.
Dom, go to supper.
Roger, when you checked in, you paid me $600 cash... leaving a balance of $4400.
$5,000 is my fee, Roger.
Exquisite Styrofoam pitcher.
Jesus, my mouth's burning up.
- You got me all drugged up, Doc.
- You need help, Roger.
I've been taking a little look around the reservation here.
I've been looking at some of the other patients and some of your colleagues.
This place stinks, Doc. It's this place that's sick, not the people in it.
You'd like to go home, wouldn't you?
Yeah, I'd like to go home, and I'm going home, cos I'll tell you one more goddamn thing!
I'm a man cannot stand confinement.
If you don't get me out of here,
I'll tear you limb from limb and waltz out through the wall!
No, Roger, you won't hurt anything here.
This is my place.
- I'm here to help you.
- Here to help me!
Just this afternoon a man came looking for you. A detective.
I told him you weren't here. You don't want your wife to know you come here.
My wife.
Of course you don't.
Here's the pen.
Here's the cheque.
It's all made out for $4400.
It's not necessary for you to sign any cheque, especially under this pressure.
You have no right to barge in here.
I know you could have me towed away, but why go to any trouble?
Wait a minute.
Who the hell are you?
A private investigator who was sent here to find you, but the doctor dummied up.
You were sent here to find me? Why?
I'm supposed to bring you home, if that's where you wanna go.
He's taking me home.
Don't forget your chequebook.
- Roger.
- Yeah.
I want you to understand, you'll be hearing from me again.
I'll be hearing from you. You come by someday and you have a drink with me.
Roger? Is that you?
Here we are!
Go in the kitchen. Go in the kitchen.
- Shh. They'll wake up.
- I don't wanna wake anybody.
Come inside. Come inside, please.
- I don't wish to go in.
- Go in the kitchen.
Let's go this way. I go to my little doggy house and you have your nice big house.
You got your friend Marlboro, the do-good bullshitter, whatever he is.
You go in the house, Roger, and you go in the house, Bowser.
That's enough.
If you don't stop this drinking,
I'm gonna leave you. I mean it.
- You what?
- Nothing.
Nothing. Of course, nothing.
And let me tell you something.
Don't talk to me about you leaving me.
I don't feel well. I just wanna go to bed.
And you, you crazy son of a bitch, you come back sometime.
- I'll come back and see you.
- You come back.
Jesus Christ. Goddamn dog!
He's really a sick man.
More so than you might think.
He feels he's all finished as a writer.
He sits down and stares at the paper and nothing happens.
I don't know what to do.
He really needs help.
I tell you, if you think your husband's suicidal, he needs some Freudian analysis or primal scream - I need a cigarette myself.
But I'm not qualified for anything like that.
I know. Anyway,
I'm very grateful for what you've done.
- You will come back again, won't you?
- I'd love to, but I don't see any necessity.
Your husband's home and I think
I've done what I'm supposed to do.
- Did you know Terry Lennox well?
- Terry? I knew Terry a long time.
I can't understand how he could do something like that.
How could he kill his wife?
They were nice people.
I don't believe he killed his wife.
But I read in the paper he confessed, and they had a letter and all from him.
Have a good night.
I'll see how everything is in the morning.
Thank you again.
Ah, yes. Mammy Yokum.
I don't wanna disturb you, lady.
I'll pick up my bills later.
- Hey, Marlowe.
- Spiffy.
- The boss wants to talk to you.
- Who's the boss?
- Mr Marty Augustine.
- I only see hoods by appointment.
That supposed to be some kind of smart crack?
- It's the only thing I could come up with.
- Harry.
- Did you think it was a smart crack?
- No, sir.
Pepe, ¿como lo ves, inteligente?
No, Marty.
I don't think he looks very smart.
- Vince?
- No, Mr Augustine.
- Nobody thinks it was a smart crack.
- What do you think, Mabel?
Ow!
Excuse me, Jo Ann.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
You stay right here.
You can play the radio if you want.
- What is that?
- Pain.
Actually, I was on my way to the bank to make a deposit. It's my laundry.
Pick him up.
Bring him. You know what night this is?
This is Friday night.
It's Shabbas. You know where I'm supposed to be? Temple.
- Why aren't you there?
- Cos I'm talking to a smart guy like you.
- Which house do you live in?
- Got a cute little place on the top.
The top? Penthouse?
How do you get up there?
- I got my own private elevator.
- A private eye with a private elevator.
Can I pick up my mail?
Get him inside.
What is this?
The new Rockettes. They're just training.
They ain't got no tap shoes yet.
I can't believe what I'm looking at.
I see you got a Mexican and you got an Irish guy, a Jewish fella and an Italian.
Do you live here?
You pay money to live in this place?
- Home is where the heart is, right?
- Your heart is in the garbage.
Sit down. Look at the laundry.
I don't take too much starch in my collars.
- Find it, find it, find it.
- Find what?
Hey, come on.
You better get that gorilla to stop that.
Be careful with that stuff.
You know where I live? While you live in this joint, I live in Trousdale.
Three acres. Across the street from President Nixon.
I take tennis lessons three times a week on my own private court.
And that's why
I'm in perfect physical condition.
Go ahead, smart guy. Punch me in the stomach as hard as you can.
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
- He's gonna punch me in the gut.
- I'm not gonna punch him in the stomach.
Maybe some other time, though.
Let me explain something.
You see, I got a wife and I got three beautiful children.
You know where my children are?
In a very expensive camp.
My wife is in an equally expensive health farm where she's trying to lose weight.
$1,000 a week to lose six pounds.
I got chauffeurs, I got maids,
I got butlers, I got cooks.
I live highly. It costs me a lot of money to live the way I do.
I gotta have a lot of money so I can juice the guys I gotta juice, so I can get a lot of money so I can juice the guys I gotta juice.
And you, Cheapie, you can't take my money.
I want my money!
Why would I have anything belonging to you?
You're famous.
You got your picture in the paper.
Everybody knows you.
You run a Mexican taxi service.
- You made a deal with Terry Lennox.
- Terry Lennox was my friend.
He asked me to give him a lift.
I wish I hadn't.
Your friend was a criminal.
He murdered his wife.
- That's a lie. He couldn't kill anybody.
- That's a minor crime, a misdemeanour.
The major crime is he stole my money.
The penalty for that is capital punishment.
- That's what they call it? It wasn't suicide.
- I don't give a goddamn how he died.
I just care about $355,000 of my money he was supposed to deliver to Mexico City.
Pepe, put down the goddamn binoculars!
¿El dinero ha ido a México?
- No way. It never arrived in Mexico City.
- It didn't arrive.
It was in a suitcase like this.
You know where it is and I want it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't expect a soul.
Don't hit me.
Open the door.
Honey, I'm sorry. I heard some noises outside the car and I got scared.
Can I have a Coke?
Come on in, darling.
Sit down.
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jo Ann Eggenweiler.
This is Philip Marlowe.
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Do you have a Coke?
- In the icebox.
- Harry.
Delicate, sweet. A little noise in the car'll give her dreams for a week.
- It's probably a squirrel.
- Marty.
I didn't drink it.
You don't want this if somebody was drinking it, hm?
It's flat.
Look.
Look at that face, a face for a magazine cover.
That profile. You're beautiful.
And I love you.
I do.
I sleep with a lot of girls, but I make love to you, right?
The single most important person in my life, next to my family.
- Huh, Pepe?
- That's right, Marty.
Get her outta here! Get her outta here!
Get up!
Open the door.
Sit him down. Sit him down!
That's someone I love, and you I don't even like.
You have an assignment, Cheapie.
Find my money.
Come on, come on.
Make sure that if he comes down here, you follow him and you don't lose him.
My God!
Hey, where you going?
What's going on here?
- Did you see that guy come through?
- They're with me.
They're with you? What the hell?
Where did you get that coat?
Jack, Jack.
- Morning, Mr Marlowe.
- Morning, ladies.
- Can you help stretch my right leg?
- What? No, I can't even touch my toes.
- After last night...
- It was really quite a night.
- Can you push a little harder?
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- Morning, Harry. You have a good night?
- Marlowe.
You know those girls who live next door to you? You know what I think?
- I think they're lesbians.
- What makes you say that?
Look at them doing all those contortions together with no clothes on.
- They're just doing yoga.
- What?
I don't know what it is, but it's yoga.
- What do they do for a living?
- They dip candles.
They got a cute little shop over on Hollywood Boulevard.
I can remember when people just had jobs.
In case you lose me in traffic, this is where I'm going.
You look great. I would straighten your tie.
- I'm proud to have you following me.
- Thank you.
Duty, duty, duty. I'm always on duty.
You're going to see the Wades.
I recognise the car.
Hi, Cary. There's this spiffy kid who's coming up behind me. I think he's OK.
- He's a very big fan of Walter Brennan.
- Walter Brennan? OK, thanks.
Walter Brennan.
Learn how to limp. Howdy, stranger.
- Howdy, stranger. What can I do for you?
- I'm following that car.
No cars out there. Just some sagebrush and a few covered wagons.
You bring my boy Billy? Left him out there on the flatlands to die. I'm gonna get him.
- How was that?
- What?
- My imitation of Walter Brennan.
- Walter Brennan?
He said...
Never mind. Go ahead.
Another wise guy, huh? He'll see.
He'll see.
Where do you think you're going?
You're not supposed to let me see you.
Button your clothes, be neat and go sit in the car.
Harry, don't you know you're never gonna be a first-grade hood?
Morning.
- So you came back.
- Hope it's not too early.
I just done six miles down that beach.
You look like you're wearing your working clothes.
I'm wearing my working clothes.
Can I buy you a drink?
- No. A little early for me.
- You're looking well.
I had a funny encounter with a character named Augustine. Heard of him?
Yeah. Mini fart.
You writers have your own special way of describing.
Go right in.
Quiet! He won't bother you. Sit down!
Quiet!
- You want a dog?
- No, I got a cat.
You got a... My wife.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I believe you know our friend the Marlboro Man here.
Hello, Mr Marlowe.
Nice of you to come back.
Dropped your cigarette, huh?
So, did you come here to see me or my wife?
I just came to see how you were doing.
I have a little idea.
I'd like to talk to my wife.
So maybe you'd go out on the beach for a bit and then we'll call you.
It's OK with me. I just wanted to see how you were. I'll be going.
Please, you don't have to go.
Can't you stay?
On second thought, I guess
I'll go down and count the waves.
Do that.
- Sleep well?
- As well as ever.
As well as ever. Pills?
No.
Contessa, perhaps you'd be kind enough to get me a bottle of milk?
Milk? Is that what you really want?
Would you say that once more?
I asked: Is milk what you really want?
You'd think I was drunk already.
I'll make a toast. To us.
Oh, God! Yeah, yeah!
That's OK.
Last night we talked about something important, but I can't remember what.
I simply said if you go on drinking,
I'm gonna leave you.
You're gonna leave me?
Yes.
Maybe you've already left me.
You've got a wall around you, baby.
And that's the same thing.
Let's stop playing games with each other.
Until you get into that solid-gold heart of yours that what I need is understanding, until you learn that, it might just turn out that... I leave you.
Maybe you should.
Maybe I should.
Oh, baby.
Aw, Jesus, Jesus. Sit down, sit down.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I said that, but you're the only thing I've got left. Don't you know that?
Perhaps I'm just your excuse.
Perhaps that's true, but... I just wish I could...
Oh, God.
If I could only...
If I could just get you to understand that... when a writer can't write, it's like being impotent.
I understand what that's like too.
Yeah. Oh, you do, huh?
You do.
Balls, baby! Balls!
Why don't you remember the good we had together, the beautiful times?
I got an idea.
Why don't you call the Marlboro Man in here and ask him a couple of questions?
- It's none of his business.
- Do what I say.
You ask him "Marlboro, when was the last time you made love at the lighthouse on Point Venus in Tahiti?"
Or out on the lagoon, that shining lagoon with the goddamn surf booming on the Barrier Reef?
Or up on Whitney that night of the blizzard in the double mummy bag? Ask him that.
It's none of his business!
Maybe it is. Maybe it is.
- Please don't.
- Don't, don't, don't, don't. Balls!
Hey! Marlboro!
Well, Contessa, here he is.
Here's the man.
You may ask your questions, please.
Contessa!
Missed the son of a bitch.
You know what I wish you'd do?
I wish you'd take that goddamn tie off and settle down with me and have a little old-fashioned, man-to-man drinking party.
That's OK with me, but I'm not gonna take my tie off.
You leave your tie on. I got champagne, beer, Scotch, bourbon, aquavit, port.
- What are you drinking?
- What I'm drinking is called aquavit.
- I'm drinking what you're drinking.
- God bless you. I like to hear that.
An awful lot of people say "I want this,
I want that, and a twist of lemon." Balls!
Make yourself comfortable.
D'you mind sitting in the sun?
- I'll sit in the sun.
- Won't hurt you.
I know that.
Aquavit.
There you go.
You wanna lift a toast to anything?
Shall we drink to your wife?
- I say we drink to all of us.
- OK.
- Caraway seeds?
- Yeah, it's true.
- You been around more than it looks like.
- Just a little bit.
I got to say it - I don't really want to, in light of your profession.
- But you've got a pretty good face.
- You study faces?
You don't get to grow a face like mine unless you know a lot about men's faces.
What about ladies' faces?
- What about ladies' faces?
- I don't know.
- Why'd you ask?
- I was just wondering.
You're a real ding-a-ling.
What you say doesn't quite make sense.
And you're in a little trouble with Marty Augustine, huh?
Yeah.
- How much you into him for?
- I don't know. I never made a bet.
- Why are you in trouble with him?
- Don't ask me. You know him good?
The son of a bitch.
I'd hate to tell you how much the bastard owes me.
- He owes you money?
- Yeah. $50,000.
50 grand? Won't he pay?
Drink up. If he'd already paid,
I wouldn't say he owed me, would I?
- I guess not.
- How's your glass?
I guess I could handle a little more.
50 grand. You must run into a lot of luck.
Most guys lose their undies when they play for those kind of stakes.
- D'you know Terry Lennox?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know Terry Lennox, but he's the kind of guy that I wouldn't let on I knew him.
Didn't like him much, huh?
Son of a bitch.
Christ Almighty, I didn't know him.
- I hear you.
- Son of a bitch killed himself.
- I read that.
- Let's drink to his going. Shit.
- You ever think about suicide, Marlboro?
- I don't believe in it.
- Did you know Sylvia Lennox?
- Sylvia. Beautiful broad.
I don't know, Marlboro.
If I was your age, I think I'd bust my ass to get into something more dignified.
- Like writing?
- I'm not talking about myself.
# The long goodbye
# Can you recognise the theme?
I made the examination and signed the necessary papers.
I am the coroner.
- The what? Colonel?
- No, the coroner.
I'm a doctor too, at the same time.
Good for you.
Would you care to see some photographs?
It's your work? I noticed your camera.
You take the pictures too?
Yes, because we have no facilities here.
We have to bring ice from the hotel.
- For drinks?
- No, for the body.
I see.
Because, you see, his death was instantaneous.
Yeah. What about the gun?
It was his. Registered to his name in the County of Los Ángeles.
You know that? Gentlemen, I appreciate all the attention you've given me and I hope I haven't caused you too much inconvenience.
- You were a friend of the diseased.
- Of the deceased, yeah.
Let me get this straight. Terry Lennox came here, he checked into a hotel, he went up to his room, and an hour later he killed himself.
That is correct.
You know how he got here?
It's a mystery to us.
We don't know how he came.
- What about his personal effects?
- Everything was sent back.
- But we have a list.
- You do have a list?
- You make up the lists?
- Yes.
You do everything.
- It says here that there was one bag.
- It was all sent back.
- But he had two bags.
- Everything was sent back.
You don't know anything about the other bag?
- Por favor.
- Should I stand up?
- Some of your work?
- No, no.
- Didn't need no ice this time.
- No, the weather is all right.
You guys all right for drinks?
Stop it. Come on, stop it.
Get in the kitchen.
I'm sorry, Mr Marlowe. He really doesn't seem to like you very much, does he?
Hey, Marlboro! You want a dog?
- Come here, you son of a...
- I think I'm gonna take off.
Could you possibly stay for a while?
He's getting very drunk.
- I wanna have a word with you.
- I can't stay for too long.
OK, thank you.
Contessa, I couldn't find you.
Hey, please come over here and join this little family group that is growing larger by the instant.
The rest of you, come over here too, goddammit.
Would you like some wine?
I'll tell you a terrible thing.
I'll tell you a terrible goddamn thing.
I liked you, but suddenly you come in with my wife?
I was looking for you everywhere.
- You and I talked, right?
- For a long time, yeah.
And we made sense, didn't we?
We touched each other, didn't...
Oh, no.
Oh, no. It's Minnie Mouse.
It's the albino turd himself. Peter Pan.
No. The white knight.
Your name, I've forgotten your name.
I've seen you but I don't know your name.
- Mrs Wade, I'm Dr Verringer.
- How do you do?
- Verringer.
- Verringer.
A mini pistol. This son of a bitch, let me tell you one thing about this bastard.
He is the epitome of what's wrong with this world. He really is.
He pretends to cure people. Can you...
- You cure people?
- Roger, please.
Bullshit.
- You, why are you here?
- Roger, we have business to discuss.
Balls!
- Roger...
- You see this asshole?
What? Huh?
- Shall we discuss this in private?
- Discuss what?
Or shall we discuss our business here, in front of all your friends?
- By all means.
- Why don't you go in the study and talk?
I ain't got no study any more.
I used to have a study over there.
Roger, you owe me $4,400.
You will pay me what you owe me.
No, actually, I don't wish to pay you what I owe you.
Roger, I'm not leaving without the money.
Don't leave. I don't give a shit. Get your ass outta here and let's have a party.
- Write the cheque.
- What cheque?
- Write the cheque.
- What cheque?
Write the cheque!
- Why, you...
- Oh...
Shit. You know, I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm all... I'm all... I'm all...
I'm all turned around. You... you... you...
Write the cheque for what?
To get outta here?
Yeah, OK.
Yeah, OK.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Would you all like some fresh drinks?
I'll go and get some more ice.
- Don't let this break the party up.
- OK, OK, OK, get out.
Get out, all of you, goddammit!
Get outta here!
It seems the party's come to an abrupt end. Pumpkin time again.
I'm sorry.
- Thank you for the lovely music.
- My pleasure.
Now sign the cheque, Roger.
That was beautiful.
Bye-bye. See you soon.
That's a good boy.
I apologise for this intrusion, Mrs Wade.
But your husband dislikes paying his bills.
I'm sorry. In future,
I must refuse to accept him as a patient.
We don't accept you as a doctor, quack.
Good day, Mrs Wade.
- Gun cabinet's locked?
- Certainly.
Would you mind closing that door?
It's bad enough having guns in the house.
Roger. Roger.
It's me. Are you asleep?
Contessa...
Looney Tunes, Mr Wade.
I'm exhausted.
Would you like something to eat?
If you got cold baloney, mayonnaise and bread, I'll hang around for a while.
I can do better than that.
We'll go to the kitchen.
He'll sleep for another five or six hours.
Does your mouth ever get so dry, you could put a cigarette out in it?
- I don't smoke.
- My mouth is really dry.
I don't understand how you get the butter in the chicken.
When you cut the chicken, the butter comes out. I don't understand.
That's the secret about it. Chicken Kiev.
Would you like some cognac,
Grand Marnier, liqueur of some sort?
- What are you gonna have?
- I'm going to stay with the wine.
I'll just have my beer out of your wine glass, if you don't mind.
- Have you had enough to eat?
- Yeah. It was the fanciest meal I ever had.
In a couple of movies I saw people eat like this but they had four or five servants.
- You did this all by yourself?
- Sure.
- Who does the dishes?
- I do.
- I am impressed.
- That's nice to know.
- I'll tell you, though...
- Would you like coffee?
Seriously, I think you oughta consider staying in a hotel.
Or do you have some friends you could spend the night with?
I did that once. My husband smashed up everything I owned, practically.
When I came back,
I found him unconscious.
- I'm not gonna try that again.
- I know what you mean, Mrs Wade.
- Why don't you call me Eileen?
- Eileen.
Eileen. OK, Eileen, what was Marty
Augustine doing here the other night?
- How did you...
- I followed him here.
He dropped by to have a word with me.
I was curious to see who else he talked to.
Roger owes him some money.
Maybe $10,000 or something like that.
He owes Marty?
He told me Marty owed him.
You heard what Dr Verringer said.
He hates to part with money.
I heard a lot of people said that Terry
Lennox was working for Marty Augustine.
- I don't believe it.
- That's what I heard.
Your husband ever talk about the Lennoxes? About Sylvia Lennox?
No.
Was he having an affair with Sylvia Lennox?
I don't wish to continue this conversation about my husband.
Was he having an affair with somebody who might have been Sylvia Lennox?
Definitely not.
Where was your husband the night Sylvia Lennox was killed?
Stay back. Here. Hold my tie.
Roger!
What brought your attention over here?
We were standing on the porch and having a party over at our place...
We didn't see the guy go in.
What we have is an apparent suicide, although we haven't found the body yet.
We could see it from the porch.
Then what happened, after the screaming and the persons running in?
I think he had been under some kind of psychiatric care.
Question: Don't you know?
Is this list of witnesses to your husband's behaviour at the party correct?
Yeah. Everybody is here having a party now. Everybody's drunk!
Your husband was upset over Dr Verringer's visit.
He threw everybody out, passed out and left you alone with Marlowe.
I asked Mr Marlowe to stay.
And there was no motive that he might have had for killing himself?
Why don't you get a couple of sand crabs, stick 'em up your nose and disappear?
You go and join him. Will you go upstairs and tweeze your eyebrows? Just go back.
Eileen, are you lying about Roger?
Are you lying about Roger?
Your crazy, Looney Tune husband could have killed Sylvia Lennox.
Look...
He's not gonna be walking outta there.
I'm sorry. I thought the guy was OK.
But the police say that Terry Lennox killed his wife.
- You tell me what really happened.
- Really happened?
Look, Terry Lennox is dead. I wanna know who killed him, because that guy is dead.
Are you gonna tell me what really happened?
- He killed Sylvia. I think so. I don't know.
- You think he killed Sylvia Lennox?
Did you just say that you think that your husband killed Sylvia Lennox?
Are you telling me the truth?
I couldn't tell anybody. I couldn't tell anybody Roger had an affair with Sylvia.
And Terry found out.
And Sylvia wanted to break it off.
And Roger was jealous and Roger went to see her and... then she was dead.
And then I read in the paper that Terry confessed.
- And I don't know what to think.
- You don't know what to think?
I know what to think. I know what to do and I know what to think.
Farmer! I want you to open up the
Terry Lennox case. I got new information.
I have fresh evidence for you to reopen the Terry Lennox case.
The lady down there, Mrs Roger Wade, is prepared to give evidence that her husband was sleeping with Sylvia
Lennox the night that she was killed.
I had my ass busted for three days because you said my friend killed her.
We know that Roger Wade saw Sylvia Lennox that afternoon.
We know what time he left her. We know he went directly to Verringer's clinic.
- You knew all the time?
- He was there all the time and in sedation.
So do me a favour. Go back to your gumshoes and peeping and let us alone.
- You want me to let you alone?
- That's right. Let us alone.
You son of a bitch. You're gonna get everything all straightened out.
I saw that man who walked into the Pacific Ocean gave Dr Whatever-his-name-is $5,000 for an alibi so you could keep your job.
I'm gonna call Ronald Reagan to kick your ass off.
You're gonna be selling bus tickets, you son of a bitch.
Terry Lennox was my friend, you motherfucker!
You don't deserve to be alive, you fucking pig!
# There's a long goodbye
# And it happens every day...
Marlowe.
How nice to see you.
It's so cooperative of you to come over.
I never mind cooperating, especially if I don't have a choice.
The boys should sit down.
You just stand here.
You remember Harry, of course, and you know Pepe at the bar, and Vince, and of course you know Jack really well.
What about that little lady who you gave a Coke bottle to for a nose?
That supposed to be some kind of smart remark?
I didn't mean nothing smart by it.
He doesn't think I'm smart.
Didn't we do this before?
Yes, we did. But I'm glad you asked me about Jo Ann.
- Vince, be so kind.
- Yes, sir.
What we have is a problem with communication.
I knew it. I don't hear from you any more.
I don't get a phone call, not so much as a postcard.
What's the matter? Where's the money?
I don't got it. That's the truth.
Jo Ann.
Jo Ann.
Come here.
You remember Philip Marlowe.
- Augustine, I get the point.
- No, you don't.
- I get the point.
- The point is money!
- Tell me where the money is.
- I don't know where it is.
I don't like getting excited like this.
I really don't like it.
Get up, get up, up!
Sit down.
Marlowe...
You remember the night Jo Ann became ill and we had to take her to the hospital?
As you can see, she's had extensive treatment.
The finest surgeons, had nurses around the clock, the best attention, because, as you know, she's very near and dear to me.
And the prognosis is excellent.
Excellent. She's going to be fine.
Now...
I left the hospital that night and I was... really upset.
- I was... What was I?
- Haunted.
- What?
- Haunted.
That's it. I was haunted with the idea that somehow I'd not been fair to her.
No matter how many times I would go over it, I realised I had not been fair to her.
Sit down over there, far away.
What had she done? Absolutely nothing.
You were the one I was angry with.
I was taking out on her what I should have been giving you!
So I knew at that moment that I had to apologise.
I had to apologise in a very special way.
It had to be total and it had to be honest.
After all, I had caused the girl considerable discomfort.
I went to the hospital, to her room.
Nobody was there. It was dark.
I took off all my clothes, undressed completely, and stood before her naked.
And I said to her "Jo Ann, I apologise."
"You see a man standing before you with nothing to hide." Is that right?
Yes, Marty.
- So what do you want me to do?
- I want you to take off your clothes.
I have nothing to hide either, but I'm not gonna take my clothes off.
Get naked and tell me the truth about my money.
- You wanna take your clothes off?
- It's a pleasure.
As a matter of fact, everybody take off their clothes.
I have too many scars.
I understand. Go on inside and take care of the telephone.
In the meantime everybody takes off their clothes. Harry, take off your clothes.
- George Raft never took his clothes off.
- Help him.
One second. I don't need any help.
Jo Ann, I want you to wait right here.
I'd like you to see what goes on.
This is what I owe you.
I owe this much to you.
I understand you're nervous.
You're nervous like I was.
When I was a kid, in high school,
I used to dread gym class.
Absolutely dread it. Because I didn't have any pubic hair till I was 15 years old.
You must have looked like one of the Three Little Pigs.
Take it easy. It's very simple.
The man is nerv...
Just a minute. Look at this.
- What's that?
- A picture of James Madison.
It's a $5,000 bill. See? You take off your clothes, everything comes out honest.
You know how many of these there are in this country? Very few.
Three were in the suitcase Terry Lennox was supposed to take to Mexico.
- Where'd you get this?
- Box of Cracker Jacks.
- Bullshit! Where did you get it?
- A client sent it to me.
A client is bullshit.
Are you laughing at me?
I see you're laughing.
I wouldn't laugh if I were you.
Is Terry Lennox alive?
Did you have a deal with Terry Lennox?
Do you think it's funny to steal
$355,000 from Marty Augustine?
- Jack, let me see that knife.
- With pleasure, Marty.
Give it to me.
Harry.
Your father was a mohel. Cut him.
- What?
- Cut him.
- Where?
- Cut it off.
- Cut "it" off?
- That's what I said. Cut it off.
Marty, come here.
Gotta tell you something.
- Can't you see that I'm busy?
- Marty, this is important. Come on.
Excuse me, will you, please?
What is it? What is it?
Everybody out.
Jack, bring me my clothes.
- What about our wallets?
- Never mind the wallets, Harry.
A lot of entertainment for five grand.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
It's OK with me.
Hey, where are you going?
I had a terrific time but I'm going home.
Here. Why don't you keep this for your trouble?
You told the truth and I admire that in a man.
- If you're in the neighbourhood, stop by.
- Thanks a lot.
Especially since my fairy godmother dropped your $350,000 back in your lap.
Hey! Mrs Wade!
Mrs Wade.
Hey, Mrs Wade!
Hey, come on!
Mrs Wade!
Pull over! Shit!
Mrs Wade, come on!
How?
Right. Chasing after that car,
I got hit by a car and I'm in the hospital.
Gotta get outta here.
Nothing broke, nothing broke. OK, OK.
You're gonna be OK.
I've seen all your pictures too.
Hey, hey.
- I just gotta get outta here.
- Hey.
You tell that guy it don't hurt to die.
- Here.
- That's the smallest one I ever seen.
- Here.
- I can't. I got a tin ear. Here you go.
It's for me? OK, I'll practise. See you later.
- You shouldn't be out of bed, Mr Marlowe.
- I'm not Mr Marlowe. This is.
- How long has he been in here?
- I don't know. I've been off for three days.
- What's wrong?
- I've had the flu.
Don't breathe near his mouth.
Take care of him. He's important.
- Are you checking in or out?
- Out.
Charlie, give me a hand with this.
- You're helpless. Can't do anything.
- I'm dropping it, Charlie.
Here's a real bird's nest. Fake bird.
Excuse me, ladies. I'm looking for Mrs...
Mrs Tooksbury's upstairs.
She's the lady in charge.
Mr Katz, I'm Sybil Tooksbury.
How do you do? You're an hour early.
I was getting all this stuff cleaned out so you can see the house as it should look.
I'm looking for the lady who lives here - Mrs Wade.
I'm not Mr Katz.
- Who are you?
- Marlowe. I'm looking for Mrs Wade.
- You're not Mr Katz?
- No.
I can't give you any information.
I work for Surfside Realty. Call them.
They'll give you any information you'd like to know. If you'll excuse me, I'm busy.
Mrs Tooks, where's Mrs Eileen Wade?
That's who I'm looking for.
Mrs Wade? I think she's gone to Europe.
I'm not allowed to tell you. I'm sorry, sir.
You'll just have to call the real-estate office.
- Ladies, it's OK with me.
- Goodbye, Mr Katz. Nice to have met you.
We're dancing in the sand and our bodies are in ecstasy.
We're seeing colours, all the most beautiful colours you can imagine.
And we're holding hands because we're one, and our breasts become full and our arms become free and our bodies become free.
And we are now beautiful.
We are now beautiful and we are now one.
- Nothing will come between...
- Hi, girls. You seen my cat?
The other day he ran away, and I'm leaving town for a couple of days.
I'd appreciate it, if he shows up, if you could look after him or give him milk.
They're not even there. It's OK with me.
A melon convention.
Our breasts are full, our bodies warm.
We hear music and dance to the music...
Señor Marlowe,
I want to show you our town.
It's a beautiful town but I don't think
I wanna go sightseeing right now.
- There are things I'd like to get straight.
- It's better if we talk inside.
This is the largest police car I've ever seen.
- It's like a gold chariot.
- Very nice, Señor Marlowe.
But I think I have to change it this year.
Look, Señor Marlowe. We're fixing the roads and all those things, the streets.
I know how civic-minded you are, but I've come for the truth.
- The truth about Terry Lennox.
- He's dead. You saw the...
You told me a good story and I saw some good pictures of a guy who looked dead, but the truth is coming together now, boys.
I'm prepared to make a donation to the people of this town.
Since you're their representatives,
I can tell you that I'm prepared, right now, to give you a James Madison.
James Madison?
A grand president. Five grand.
- You think you can bribe us?
- Bribe? Oh, no!
Bribe? This is charity I'm talking about.
You can buy a lot of cobblestones for a little light shown on the matter.
I'll tell you what happened to Terry Lennox.
The suicide was a fake, of course.
I put the injection so it looked like he was dead, but he wasn't dead.
Put a gun to his head but the wound was harmless. Then we took him in a coffin.
Took the pictures, with the ice.
It looked perfect.
We buried the coffin loaded with stones.
Mr Lennox is also charitable. What did he...
- Just a Madison.
- So you know James Madison?
- We met him for the first time, yes.
- Lennox is still alive and well, señor.
How you doin', Terry?
Marlowe?
I guess if anybody was gonna track me down, it would be you.
- Want a drink or something?
- No, I don't want no drink.
You get a kick out of that Madison I sent you?
Yeah, I got a big kick out of it.
So you murdered your wife, Terry?
I killed her, but you can't call it murder.
Wade told her about Eileen and me, she started screaming.
She was gonna tell the cops.
She knew I was carrying money for
Augustine. She was gonna turn me in.
I hit her. I didn't try to kill her.
I hit her. I didn't mean it.
I saw the photographs.
You bashed her face in.
She didn't give me any choice.
You didn't have much choice, huh?
So you used me.
That's what friends are for. I was in a jam.
Come on, have a drink.
I had a dead wife,
$350,000 that doesn't belong to me.
- I had to get out. It's as simple as that.
- Simple as that.
Goddamn simple. Cops have me legally dead, Augustine's got his money.
I got a girl that loves me. She's got more money than Sylvia and Augustine.
- What the hell? Nobody cares.
- Yeah. Nobody cares but me.
That's you, Marlowe.
You'll never learn. You're a born loser.
Yeah. I even lost my cat.

Where do you stay in Los Angeles?
Usually downtown.
Is that your favorite part of the city?
No. I like Westwood.
You must return to Tokyo within four days, Mr. Tanner.
And settle your business with Tono at that time.
If you don't, of course,
I'm instructed to return again...
...only with more than a piece of cloth.
Is this necessary, or even very wise?
Put it away.
I'm sorry.
Tono is waiting, Mr. Tanner.
- Yeah?
- Harry, this is George.
Hey, old buddy, what are you doing in town?
Nothing. Just taking care of a sick friend.
- What are you...?
- Harry, I gotta talk to you.
I got trouble, real trouble.
- The Yakuza's got Louise.
- What?
If I'm not back there in four days, they're
gonna send something else from Louise...
- ... and it's not gonna be part of her dress.
- Have you been to the police?
With that story?
This is a Yakuza outfit I'm dealing with.
- What the hell can the police do?
- They can do a lot more than I can.
There's one thing you can do they can't.
Really?
What?
You can see Tanaka Ken.
George,
I haven't seen Ken in 20 years.
Tanaka Ken will do anything you want.
Whenever you say or he'll die trying.
You know that.
I hate like hell to ask you.
I don't want you to put yourself through this.
Have you seen Eiko?
Yeah, Christmas.
I go by Kilmer House every Christmas...
...you know, have a drink and drop off a couple of presents.
As soon as I come in the door, she always says, "How's Harry?"
So once a year, I tell her how you are.
How does she look?
Great. She hasn't changed a bit.
Swell.
I'm sending Al Hoekstra's kid along with you.
Dusty, you remember him?
Remember? I used to babysit him when Al and his wife went to the movies.
Well. He's a big boy now.
He's my personal bodyguard.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Harry, you know these guys.
- You think I can't handle myself?
- I didn't say that. Did I say that?
You think I'm too old?
You son of a bitch.
No. You old son of a bitch.
- Okay, when you get there...
- Personal bodyguard?
I'm gonna fly tomorrow.
We shouldn't be on the same plane.
This is the final request for departing
passengers for Cathay Pacific Airways...
Harry.
Harry. Hey.
- Harry, for God's sakes. How are you, man?
- Oliver, how are you?
You look good.
Here, here, let me take those.
I just can't get over it, Harry.
You look damn near the same, man.
- What the hell's a few years at our age?
- Yeah.
Oh, Oliver Wheat, this is Dusty Hoekstra.
Dusty's Al's son.
Oh, my God, of course.
Dusty came to hold my hand, make sure I don't get run over by a Honda.
Yeah, fine. He can stay with us.
Come on. Come on.
We're great pals during the war, through the occupation.
- Harry and your father were the tough guys.
- George and Oliver were the brains.
I got a car and a driver out here.
Where's George?
He didn't think we should be on the same flight.
- Oh, I can't.
- Sure you can.
- You waiting until closing time?
- Yeah.
- How do you feel about seeing her?
- I feel just fine.
What the hell.
We're two different people now, aren't we?
Sure.
- How's your game?
- Can't play anymore.
- Can't play?
- Doctor's orders.
- Oh, come on, Ollie.
- It's the truth.
Had a coronary couple of years ago.
Doctor advised me to lay off chess.
It excites me too much.
Just playing chess?
If you take it seriously, it's very exciting.
So now I play other people's games.
Keeps me out of trouble.
You got quite a little armory here.
Rougher coming back than you thought it would be?
Well, I can't call it rough.
Nothing's happened.
You don't see George anymore.
- Not much.
- How come?
Who knows? He's busy, I'm busy.
I teach Japanese-American History, he's out there making it.
He's tremendously successful.
Everywhere I look,
I can't recognize a thing.
It's still there.
The farmers in the countryside may watch TV from their tatami mats...
...and you can't see Fuji through the smog.
But don't let it fool you.
It's still Japan...
...and the Japanese are still Japanese.
Shit!
I barely touched it.
Whoa, I'll get something for you.
Try not to mess up the carpet, will you kid?
I'll see you later.
- Hey, where you going?
- I'll be back.
Sit down.
- How old is that what-do-you-call-it?
- A katana.
It's just over 500 years old.
Here, I'll do that.
Where is Kilmer going?
For a Zen master...
...the sword is not to destroy other human beings...
...but his own greed, anger and folly.
The forger and the user of the sword should live in such a way...
...that it comes to stand for the annihilation...
...of anything in the way of justice, peace and humanity.
It's sacred.
He's gone to see someone he loves.
Kilmer?
Who is she?
Tanaka Eiko.
During the war,
Tokyo was swept by a fire storm.
More people died here
than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.
Her whole family was wiped out.
Only Eiko and her baby daughter survived.
When she returned to Tokyo...
Some became "pan pan" girls.
Eiko, however, was more resourceful.
Her daughter needed penicillin...
...so she became a black-market runner to get it.
About this time, Harry became aware of her, what she was doing.
He was with the military police then.
One day, in a skirmish with some
American troops, Eiko was nearly killed.
Harry prevented that.
Nearly wound up in the stockade
in the process.
Anyway, that's how they met.
In 1949, third year of the occupation...
... Harry was crazy about her,
it was obvious...
Harry wanted to, but Eiko refused.
She said she'd live with him forever,
but she could never marry him.
Then in 1951, Eiko's brother,
Tanaka Ken, returned from the dead.
He had been living for six years in the jungle caves of the Philippines.
He thanked Harry for rescuing Eiko
and for saving her daughter...
... but he told Eiko
he could no longer talk to her.
She had placed him forever in debt
to his enemy and it was torture for him.
Ken left his sister, became one of the most successful yakuza in occupied Tokyo.
Eiko, meanwhile, would no longer see Harry, much less marry him.
So when his enlistment was up,
he borrowed $5,000 from George...
... bought a coffee shop and bar
and gave it to Eiko as a sayonara gift.
She called it Kilmer House
and she still runs it today.
What about her brother?
Where is he now?
Tanaka Ken?
That is what Harry has come
a very long way to find out.
Hello, darling.
Yeah, it's me.
Harry?
Easy.
Thank you.
Excuse me a moment. We just closed.
I know.
Jack Daniels?
It's all right.
I don' t drink anymore.
They were right.
You haven't changed a bit.
Hanako?
Welcome home.
It's so good to see you.
You haven't written in such a long time.
We missed you.
Hanako, you're a knockout.
A knockout?
Thank you.
- What are you doing now?
- I'm a teacher at Meiji.
Yeah?
- Will you be here for a while?
- Well, for a few days, yeah.
And you won't go away without saying goodbye?
No way.
Okay, I better be going.
You look just like I remember you.
Oliver took that one, remember?
Yes, I remember. How is Oliver?
Oh, he's fine. I'm staying with him.
How's your brother?
My brother?
Yeah, Ken, your brother. How is he?
- Why do you ask?
- Because I have to see him.
- But why?
- Look, it has nothing do with you.
We've been all through that a long time ago.
Then why?
Are you still afraid of my talking to him, after all this time?
Is he that crazy?
I don't think it's a good idea, that's all.
Well, it's not exactly my idea of a good time either, but I have to see him, Eiko.
It involves a debt I owe someone.
Why do I always have the feeling that you're hiding something from me?
- Oh, you've always felt that way.
- Yes, and I always think you have.
Harry...
...I haven't told you everything in my life.
But I haven't made a secret of that, have I?
- No.
- Well.
Goddamn it, I'm getting too old for this.
- Of course, I'll always...
- Always what? Love me?
Then marry me.
Well, now that we've got that over with for the next 20 years...
...where's your brother? Where's Ken?
He's not living in Tokyo anymore.
Oh, he keeps just a little apartment, but his home is in Kyoto now.
How can I find him?
He teaches kendo at the Kendo Hall.
Thank you.
Oh, I almost forgot.
These are for Hanako.
Thank you. She'll be very happy.
- Harry, will you...?
- Just a couple of days.
I'll see you before I leave.
It's very pleasing to see you again.
Yeah.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Harry.
Hello, Tanaka Ken.
What can I do for you?
I need to ask you a favor.
I have an obligation to you
I can never repay.
How long have you lived here in Kyoto?
Eight years.
- It's very pleasant here.
- Yes.
- All of Kyoto is pleasant.
- Yes.
- Pardon?
- Nothing.
I know Tono and his clan.
They are not what I call honorable.
But they would not kidnap an American student.
Well, apparently, Tanner and Tono had some business dealings.
Apparently, Tono coerced Tanner into smuggling some guns...
...and Tanner can't deliver the shipment.
As a matter of fact, he lost them.
Tono doesn't believe that, and money doesn't interest him.
He wants those guns.
And he's given his word that he will cut Tanner's daughter up...
...in four days, unless he gets them.
This man, Tanner, he is a close friend?
Very. He loaned me the money to buy Kilmer House for your sister.
- Are you police now, Kilmer?
- No.
What is it you want me to do?
Well, I would like you to see Tono.
Talk to him.
Tell him that Tanner's telling the truth about the guns, he doesn't have them.
That he'll accommodate Tono anyway he can...
...as long as Tono does not harm his daughter.
I'll try, but I don't know how much I can do.
I am no longer yakuza.
I had no idea.
I have not picked up my sword in 10 years.
You've had no dealings with yakuza in all that time?
But they might listen.
It's impossible. I can't ask you that.
You already have.
- I'll need a .38 for Dusty.
- Second drawer.
- Harry, I wish you wouldn't...
- Come on, everything's gonna be all right.
- George, you got rounds for a .45?
- Right here.
Take it easy, Ollie.
Don't you guys realize
I'm not supposed to play chess?
- That guy doesn't like you.
- No, not much.
So how come you figure you can trust him?
- Giri.
- Giri?
Yeah. Giri, obligation.
You mean, he figures he owes you something?
Yeah, sort of.
Well, I can work two ways, Kilmer.
If you ain't alive tomorrow, he don't owe you shit.
I don't want them to see you.
One of them has moved.
I can't see him anymore.
Take the window.
Watch it!
It's gonna be okay.
Just relax. Nothing's gonna happen.
I think they've been drugged.
Oh, my God.
Oh, man. Oh, Jesus.
Well, how is she?
She's gonna be all right.
They gave them both some kind of tranquilizers.
She's gonna sleep it off by morning, he says.
Goddamn it. I don't know what to say to you guys.
I really don't.
That's the greatest, goddamn thing anybody ever did for me.
It's not gonna help in your negotiations with Tono. Two of his men are dead.
I'll handle him.
Son of a bitch goofed and he knows it too.
You'll handle him?
How will you handle him?
He already lost face, didn't he?
He doesn't want to lose any more.
- Excuse me, Mr. Tanner.
- Right.
Okay, there's no flight out until 12:30 tomorrow...
...so I'll send Louise on JAL and you and Dusty can go on Pan Am, all right?
Well, the survivors won't talk to the police.
Your friend from the monastery is sure to talk to Tono.
The sooner you get out, the better.
They take it very hard when an ex-yakuza interferes in yakuza affairs.
I'm sure Tono will take it hard and he'll try to nail Ken.
Then you better get your ass out of here and him too.
If they want me, they will find me.
I don't think it's so serious.
Tono violated the yakuza code by this kidnapping.
He can't move against me without the approval of the other clans.
In this case, I don't think he will get it.
I don't think he will even ask for it.
I'm not worried.
If Mr. Tanner thinks he can satisfy Tono, then it's all over with.
I can do it.
That's it then, Kilmer-san.
I ought to do something for him, shouldn't I?
Not to offend him, but I ought to do something.
No.
You owe him something you can never pay.
And I'm real sorry about that.
- Would you listen to this?
- Will you stop it?
I know what happened.
You don't have to read it to me.
I just thought you might like to hear your reviews.
- Did you use anything besides the .38?
- No.
You can hang on to all except the .38.
I'd get rid of that as quickly as possible.
- Maybe the car for the airport.
- Yeah, maybe.
- Good morning, Harry.
- Good morning.
- Can I talk to you?
- Well, we were just... Yeah, sure.
Eiko.
I don't mean to be rude, but could we go for a walk?
- We can leave, we were just...
- No. No, it's all right.
- I'd prefer to walk, if you don't mind.
- Sure.
- We leave for the airport in 45 minutes.
- Airport?
We'll make it. I'll be back.
But you just arrived and Hanako is teaching now.
She'll be terribly upset.
I know.
Eiko, what is it?
Ken came by last night.
What time?
After midnight. He waited for Hanako to come home from a date.
Was that unusual?
Somewhat. He...
No, we don't talk much, as you know.
He visits when he's in town.
What did you ask Ken to do?
Why, what did he say to you?
He was just evasive, like you.
- You saw Ken last night.
- Yes.
So can you tell me why he feels he's in some sort of danger?
- Did he say that?
- Of course not, you know what he's like.
Goddamn it, he must have said something...
But I know him!
He feels he's in danger.
He's not in Kyoto.
Maybe his brother could help.
Brother?
Where the hell did he come from?
Wait a minute. Is he yakuza?
- Powerful?
- Yes. He's a kind of oyabun.
Adviser to all the clans.
Does he care about Ken, about what happens to him?
I think so, very much.
They just don't talk to each other.
Well, Ken has a great habit of not talking to his relatives, doesn't he?
- Where could I find him, this brother?
- It's very difficult now.
- He's in Kyoto for a business conference.
- Kyoto.
It is very pleasant meeting you,
Mr. Kilmer.
I have heard a good deal about you
over the years.
- Oh. Really? Who from?
- Eiko, of course.
Even Ken has mentioned you.
Ken once spoke of you
as giri-gatai gaijin, the strange stranger.
Now, how can I help you?
- Do you think Tono will try to kill Ken?
- Oh, yes.
- But Ken is your brother.
- Yes.
Then I take it you're not interested in what happens to him.
On the contrary, Mr. Kilmer,
I'm very interested.
- What about you?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Why are you here?
Look, you're a man of position and influence.
Your brother's life is being threatened.
I just assumed that you'd want to know and want to help him.
Tell me, what significance does this have for you?
It looks like an ideogram.
Very good. Can you say which one?
And what does michi mean?
A road, path in the country, a lane, street.
It can also mean duty, obligation, even God.
When my brother spoke of you as a unique stranger...
...I took it to mean that you were a Westerner...
...who held values consistent with ours.
That a man pays his owns debts, discharges his own obligations...
...that they are all that make him a man.
You have an obligation to my brother and yet you ask me to assume it.
I thought that by coming here to you
I'd fulfill part of that obligation.
- You don't like Ken.
- Does anyone?
He's a hard man to warm up to, face it.
Yes, yes, he is insufferable at times.
Honorable men usually are.
But Ken is also unique in one other respect.
He is a lone wolf of sorts, something very rare in Japan.
He neither takes nor gives orders.
Years ago, he broke away from our family...
...when he was to become the youngest oyabun in all of Japan.
I'm ashamed to admit that, when he broke away, I neither assisted nor protected him.
He survived, but as a result, he is under no obligation to me...
...and would not accept my help.
Even if he would, this affair with Tono has put me in an awkward position as well.
You? How's that?
Tono has alerted every oyabun in Tokyo that my brother has interfered in his affairs.
He has let them know that the only fit punishment for my brother is death.
Tono is now home, hoping that I will try to prevent him from killing Ken.
Why?
He wants to compromise my position as counselor.
My policy has been one not only of maintaining peace...
...among the oyabun and their followers...
...but moving them into legitimate business.
If he can say
I have let my personal considerations...
...get in the way of my professional judgment...
...then be stands an excellent chance of upsetting my policies.
Ken knows this. That is another reason why he would avoid my help.
Well, what can Ken do by himself?
He can go to Tono and ask his forgiveness.
Which would place him under obligation to Tono.
- Yes.
- What else?
- He can wait for Tono to kill him.
- Yeah.
Or he can kill Tono.
What chance would he have?
Ken is skillful and any man can be killed.
Tono of course, is oyabun...
...and if one is old-fashioned, and Ken most certainly is...
...then honor dictates that an oyabun be killed with a sword.
And if Ken does that, then Tono's men are free to kill Ken any way they please.
He would be no farther away from them than the length of his own sword.
On the other hand, you, Mr. Kilmer, are not yakuza.
You are not bound to kill
Tono with a sword.
- I can't do that.
- Perhaps.
In any case, Ken felt he had an obligation to you. He fulfilled it.
You now know the consequences of his actions.
Whatever obligation you now have to Ken,
Mr. Kilmer...
...if you don't feel it, you don't have it.
What the hell was that?
- Are you all right?
- Fine, Ollie.
Everything's okay.
Just unpacking, that's all.
Bob, go on out.
It was my daughter's life.
I'm sorry about what happened to your men.
I didn't want that to happen.
Maybe I can help with the families, huh?
You promised me guns, take my money, you fail to deliver them.
I take your daughter.
Your friend Kilmer and Tanaka Ken take her back and kill several of my men.
Now I must face the rest of them and continue to command their respect.
I know that.
To begin with, you must tell me the truth, even if it humiliates you.
What happened to the guns?
You never lost them, did you?
No, I never lost them, Tono.
I lost the goddamn money, that's what I did.
I never bought them in the first place.
I've been living way over my head for about two years, more than that.
Not so you'd know it.
I put up a real good million-dollar front...
...but I haven't had any money in a long time.
And the banks have been on my back real good.
So when I got that money from you,
I thought I saw a big chance...
...and took a flyer and some futures, you know?
No, you don't know.
It's investment. I bought on the margin,
I bought too much, and they sold me out.
It's all gone, all the goddamn money's gone.
Why didn't you tell me this?
What did you tell your friends?
This man, Kilmer, and Tanaka Ken?
Tanaka Ken? That's Kilmer's friend.
I just told them you were trying to extort some money out of me.
- What about Goro?
- All clans know that Ken broke his vows.
- His brother cannot protect him.
- That's it, then, huh?
Just a moment.
We'll take care of Ken.
There is one thing you must do.
This man, Kilmer, he knows Japan.
He knows too much about us.
Look, he's... He's halfway to Honolulu right now.
He left on the Pan Am flight at noon.
That's not good enough.
Well, what is good enough?
- Let me do that, that last one.
- No.
That's what a husband's supposed to do in the U.S.
Okay.
Husband.
Wife?
- Children?
- No.
Oh, that's too bad.
Hai, Oliver-san.
Oh, Oliver.
Oh, looking at you, it's like old times, Eiko.
Yes.
Hey, I saw some guys without any little finger.
Does that mean that they don't have a wife or she's dead or...?
No.
Well, what is it?
That's yakuza.
Yakuza?
Yakuza gangsters have a ritual...
...in which they sometimes cut off their little finger.
Like this.
That's sick. Why do they do that?
If a yakuza commits a very great offense, or breaks his word to his oyabun, his boss...
...an offense so great that it demands his life be taken...
...then the only way that he can atone for his crime...
...is by offering his finger as a symbol of repentance.
They really do that? Today?
Well, guess you can't afford to commit too many offenses.
- Did you speak to Ken?
- Yeah.
- Does he know we're here?
- Sure.
- Is he unhappy?
- I'm on my way over to see him now.
But is he unhappy?
Of course. He's been unhappy ever since he lost the war.
I try to tell him it's not his fault, but he won't take my word.
What's up?
You stick around and keep an eye on things.
I'll see you later.
If you don't care about yourself...
...at least let me take Eiko and Hanako away from here for a while.
Just a vacation.
- You still love her?
- That has nothing to do with this.
I don't understand.
What's going on in your mind?
They're going after you.
Do you want to die?
My brother exaggerates.
He worries too much.
That's why he is effective at keeping the peace.
I will go back to Kyoto and live my life.
You find that so hard to understand?
- What about your family?
- They won't hurt them.
Even if they wanted, the other clans...
Fuck the other clans!
Suppose they find out you're visiting, like you were at 3:00 the other morning.
You know.
You know what's going to happen.
- Eiko told you.
- Of course she told me.
- What else did she say?
- What difference does that make?
Does she have your permission to go or doesn't she?
Eiko can do as she pleases.
- She always has.
- That's a lie.
Eiko is afraid to breath for fear of offending you.
That's all that ever worries her.
Why? I don't know.
- This is Japan, Kilmer.
- Well, even for Japan, it's strange.
In any case, it's not your family.
No, no, it's not.
Wheat was telling me about how the Japanese use the katana.
We when we cut, we always slash out.
Japanese slashes in, you know, butt end towards the belly?
American saw cuts on the push stroke.
Japanese saw cuts on the pull stroke.
When an American cracks up...
...he opens up the window and shoots up a bunch of strangers.
When a Japanese cracks up, he closes the window and kills himself.
Everything's in reverse, isn't it?
Last night, I was watching Hanako making supper.
Yeah, so?
Nothing.
Tanner-san.
Ken-san?
This giri.
It means obligation, right?
Burden.
Burden.
It's called "the burden hardest to bear."
Yeah, well, suppose you don't bear it?
- No one's gonna come down on you.
- No.
Well, you guys believe in some kind of heaven or hell?
No.
Then what is it that you believe in that makes you do it?
Giri.
Don't worry about that, Dusty.
What are you thinking?
About George.
George Tanner is an opportunist, a survivor.
He's always been.
Yeah, but you used to like him, didn't you?
I knew you thought he was your friend.
- He was.
- Perhaps once.
Harry, sometimes, you're very naive.
Oh, hi.
Come on in, I'll be right with you.
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
George Tanner.
Yeah, so am I.
- Harry, I think you better listen to this.
- Why don't we forget about it?
You'd better not forget about it.
Dusty's got something to tell you.
When Tanner sent me over here, it wasn't just to watch out for you.
- It was to watch you too.
- Watch me?
- Did you ask him why?
- I knew why.
I knew he was smuggling guns for Tono.
He even cut me in on a piece of the action.
See, they've been fighting,
But underneath it all, they're really very tight.
- What?
- Yeah.
Tanner's been trying to help Tono take over this guy Goro's position.
And he thought maybe if you found out about it...
...you might make more trouble than you cleared up.
I feel like an ass.
Okay, hot shot, you better get yourself out of here.
Yeah, that's what Tanner said.
I'd like to stay here now and do what I can.
How about it, huh?
We gotta talk about a couple of things.
- You feel like a walk?
- Is that a good idea?
Dusty's here. You'll be safe enough.
I didn't mean for us, I meant for you.
We'll be gone 10 minutes.
- Doesn't your side bother you?
- No, it needed a little trimming anyway.
One of us should leave.
You mean this town isn't big enough for both of us?
I mean, someone should take Eiko and Hanako away.
And it should be you.
- Well, what about you?
- I can manage.
She's waking up the gods, isn't she?
Kilmer-san, believe me, it isn't necessary for you to stay.
Really, it's not necessary.
Maybe not for you.
All these years...
...what have you been doing?
Oh, quite a few things.
Police work, private investigation...
...real estate, investments, you know.
You've done well?
That depends on how you figure those things.
Yes.
You have no family?
No.
- Hanako?
- Yes?
I love watching you do that.
I'm glad.
Wait.
Feel how warm the cup is.
Feel how it feels.
Now drink.
No. No, don't.
Come on, nobody's here, nobody's here.
No one's here. He's not here.
There's nobody here.
Eiko, get down!
Stop! Stop it!
Oh, God, stop it. Stop it, please.
Stop it! Stop it!
Please. Oh, God. Stop!
Stop it! Stop it, please.
Stop! Stop it!
Get Hanako, we've gotta go. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.
- Eiko is at hotel?
- Yeah.
Wheat's taking care of her.
- And Ken?
- Ken's there too.
When Ken saw Hanako, he just came apart.
Were they Tono's or Tanner's men?
It could have been both of them.
Where can I find Tono?
Tono is my responsibility.
You told me what to do, I didn't do lt.
- If I had...
- Cease.
- The question is what to do now.
- Tono's death is necessary.
- You wouldn't have a chance.
- Tanner is also dangerous.
And he's my responsibility.
Very well.
Come, I will show you what I can provide for you.
There is one other matter.
Small, but important to me.
I have a wayward son, Tanaka Shiro...
...who left the university to become yakuza.
He is now part of Tono Toshiro's family and a great shame to me.
You would not remember him.
But he now has a tattoo of a spider, here.
If you should see him, try not to harm him.
Perhaps he'll return to his repentant father.
Before Ken dies...
...there is something
I think you might want to know.
You may have been surprised to hear...
...that Tanaka Eiko and Ken have an older brother still living.
I'm not Eiko's brother.
On the other hand, neither is Ken.
Ken is her husband.
When he returned five years after the war, he found you with his wife.
He was enraged that she was living with a foreigner...
...yet grateful to you for saving her life.
In any case, Ken is a tormented man.
It is Eiko, of course, but it's also Japan.
Ken is a relic, a leftover from another age and another country.
I'm glad you told me.
Under the circumstances,
I felt you had a right to know.
My God...
...then Hanako was Ken's child.
Hi, I'm Harry Kilmer, friend of George's.
He asked me to stop by.
Tanner!
Tanner!
Goddamn son of a...
I checked with Oliver. Eiko is fine.
Good.
- You'll join them now.
- I don't think so.
I'm going with you.
There is no way you can keep the Tono clan from me.
Or yourself, for that matter.
I thank you, Kilmer.
But it's a futile gesture.
Well, it may be futile, but it's no gesture.
If I don't, I have nowhere to go.
I did it, Ken.
Nineteen, and more in the other rooms.
Tono!
Ken.
Well, the flight goes straight to San Francisco.
I guess that's good.
At least there's no layover in Hawaii that way.
Look, Eiko.
I have no more secrets, do I, Harry?
You'll never run out of those, darling.
Harry.
You should know the police have discovered through their network of informants...
...that George Tanner and Tono Toshiro had a business feud last night.
A most violent one, apparently.
Now the matter seems to be closed.
Tanner and Tono tried to kill each other, they succeeded.
How pleased they may be with the success of their efforts...
...you shall never know.
The police, at least, are satisfied.
- Where are you going now, Harry?
- Home.
You?
I'll go back to Kyoto.
I guess that's a good idea.
Oliver, Hanako was Ken's child.
What are you talking about?
Eiko is not Ken's sister. She's his wife.
I destroyed his past and his future.
Harry.
What are you...? Are you all right?
Yes. But I'd like to talk to you.
Of course.
I'm sorry, I'm packing for Kyoto. Come.
Formally.
I will get you some tea.
Harry-san.
Tanaka-san,
I have brought great pain into your life...
...both in the past and in the present.
If you can forgive me, then surely, you can forgive Eiko.
You are greatly loved and respected by all your family.
Mr. Kilmer, gate 11.
Sit where you please. Have a good trip.
- Let me help you.
- Thanks.
Flight 9-6-2 from Seoul
is now arriving at gate 13.
[ENGLISH]
Please!
Please, you must come quick!
There is a woman lying dead out on the moors!
It's all right, miss.
No need for you to take another look.
Ruber, Alice. Mrs.
I say she's been dead for no more than two hours, say 4 o'clock at the outside for time of death.
Hercules Parrot, sir.
Poirot, mademoiselle. Pucker your lips as though about to bestow a kiss! Poi-rot.
Good morning, Poirot.
I hope you have some news for us.
This case has been hanging for four or five months.
No, I'm afraid it's one of those rare cases where an insurance company must... laugh and lump it.
Very well.
The usual 100 guineas, I take it?
By the way Poirot...
Take a look at this.
It is the property of Sir Horace Blatt.
He is seeking to insure it with us for 50,000 pounds.
Well, on the face of it, it seems to be worth every penny of ...
...38 pounds, 7 shillings and 6 pence.
You are of course quite right.
It is paste.
The question is why should a millionaire industrialist perpetrate such an obvious fraud?
Precisely. They must have known the stone would be examined.
So you see, there is something of a mystery.
Just be assured, with Hercules Poirot mysteries never last for long.
Exactly.
We were wondering if you would undertake to investigate the matter.
You know you can count on my discretion.
Very well, I will see
Sir Horace this afternoon.
Hardly this afternoon, I think.
He's on his yacht.
"The Jolly Roger" in southern France.
Will the further 200 pounds meet the case?
Guineas!
It will make my forthcoming holidays even more attractive.
So that's your game, is it?
You've come out here as near as dammit accuse me,
Horace Blatt, of fraud?
Do you seriously think that I cheated the insurance company of one bloody jewel?
I'm worth millions, Poirot
Nevertheless, I am afraid it's quite worthless, Monsieur.
I've got to come and wring her bloody neck!
If you would care to confide in me,
I should be most honoured.
All right, I'll tell you this much.
A couple of months back
I met a certain lady in New York.
She told me she was so madly in love with me that she'd leave the show she was in
'cause she was an actress, you know, and come back to England with me on the "Queen Mary" and marry me.
So I bought this stone from Tiffany's.
Then halfway across the Atlantics, she changed her mind and ran off with another man.
Well, I wouldn't mind it so much.
Only she took the jewel with her.
That was not fair too. You see, I've given her it in contemplation of marriage.
And frankly, $100,000 is a bit much to pay for three days fumbling on the high seas.
Oh Monsieur, who can put a price on "les affaires de coeur"?
I bloody can.
And this was too high. So three weeks ago I went after her and demanded it back.
Of course she tried to put me off, but finally after a week or so she gave it to me and
I sent it along to be insured.
And this bloody thing coming out, ain't it?
It would appear to be the only explanation, Monsieur.
Well, she's not gonna make chump out of me.
I happened to know that in three days time she would be down at Daphne's place for a little holiday.
- I'll give her a little holiday!
- Daphne's place?
Yes, you know, Daphne Castle.
She was the mistress of the
King of Tyrania for years.
When he opted to marry the present queen, he gave Daphne an old summer palace to keep it quiet.
She turned it into one of those exclusive bloody darn hotels where the nobs and nonenties come to squawk at each other.
I can't stand it myself.
But she's a good sort.
Anyway you'd better come away with me.
I'll ask the captain to prepare a cabin. We can sail off tonight.
Alas, Monsieur, ever since I was a small boy,
I have suffered from le mal de mer.
It needed all my courage to make this small trip.
I will take the train. And join you there.
My compliments to.
Monsieur Jerome.
Patrick, really! No time for another drink!
The steamer leaves at eleven!
Of course, I have! If you have the baggage sent down, I'll wait for the change.
Why do I always have to do everything?
Monsieur Poirot, your reservation for the night train has been confirmed.
- The tickets will be at the desk.
- Thank you.
I must go.
I've got to catch that damned boat.
That's wrong, Rex. You look fearfully glum.
You are supposed to be enjoying yourself.
God knows you're paying enough for it!
Don't I know it?
As a matter of fact, Daphne,
I was wondering if you would care to trade my bill for a super piece in "New Yorker"?
You know that sort of thing
"Farewell courtesan, hello inn-keeper".
Darling, I'd love to help. But it's not the publicty I need, it's the cash.
Oh good god, darling, that need we all.
How are the Gardeners this morning?
Sea cannot wither nor custom stale their infinite vulgarity.
Good morning, Gardeners.
Everything tikitiboo?
Good morning.
Sure, Daphne. But I could wish that my shower worked as snappily as the one that I have got back home in New York City.
Oh, you can't expect American plumbing when you are in the Adriatic.
I guess not.
Well, at least we've got a shower.
A cousin of Odell's was at some place in Jugoslavia last year and had to wash in a kind of shack in a field. Isn't that so, Odell?
It wasn't my cousin, Myra.
It was my aunt.
It was your cousin Thelma Snatchball.
OK, if you insist.
But there were two shacks.
One for the guests and one for the staff. It was very stylish.
The boat's coming in, Daphne.
Prepare to repel boarders.
- That will be Arlena.
- Do you mean Arlena Stuart?
- No, Arlena Marshall.
She re-married a couple of months ago.
- Oh good god, darling, I didn't know she was coming on. How marvellous!
I'm her greatest fan.
We'll just make fine vacation.
Has any of you happened to see that last show of hers?
Hail and farewell, I'll never tell, you've cast a spell over me.
- We produced it. Remember, dear?
- Oh, good god, darlings, I quite forgot.
Isn't that the one she walked out on after just three weeks in your biggest hit in years?
You know damned well it was.
Now, just what was that?
A sudden breakdown in health?
More like a sudden attack of gold digging.
Which rather turned into
"sail and farewell", eh?
Funny a man.
Well, if that's Arlena, she must be being dressed by Woolworth these days.
Oh, that's the Redferns. Patrick and
Christine, I seem to remember.
Excuse me, I must put my hostess hat on.
Anyway darlings, it must have cost you a pretty bundle closing a hit show like that.
- Why don't you get comment on that?
- Why don't you go and play with yourself?
Excessively.
Is coarseness a substitute for wit, I ask myself.
Hello! I'm Daphne Castle.
Welcome to the island.
How do you do?
Looks lovely. I'm sure we'll have a nice time here.
And a naughty one too.
- Would you care to sign in?
- Naughty?
It's what's the holiday's for.
If you can't do some sort of flirting and get a bit of petty booze?
- Quite right. Do you fancy a walk around the island before lunch, dear?
Patrick! You know perfectly well that
I've got a splitting headache.
And I've got all the unpacking to do.
- Andrea show to your room, if you like.
- Thank you.
After two days on that suffocating steamer I would really have sought a little more cosideration.
Thank you for these three hours of pure unadulterated hell.
This may come as a nasty surprise to you, but shock absorbers have been standard equipment on motorized vehicles for 30 years.
Softly, fools, with my wardrobe!
Linda, do something!
- Like what?
- Like stop them, cracky.
- Kenneth! This is a nightmare.
- Take it easy, Arlena. We'll soon be there.
Soon? It can't be soon enough for me.
Thanks for these dreadful journeys.
Isn't that the absurd little man we saw at the station of Tyranna?
The one who pinched the only decent taxi from under your nose.
Yes, I do believe it is.
Good morning.
It seems we are all obviously going to Daphne's
Island, I'd better introduce myself.
I'm Kenneth Marshall and this is my wife, Arlena.
- Hercules Poirot. Enchanté, madame.
- Charmed.
This is my stepdaughter, Linda.
Linda, do stop standing there like a coughdrop and say good morning to Monsieur Poirot.
And was journey as frightful as ours,
Monsieur Poirot?
Alas, I fear the sea more than the land, Madame.
Mr. Marshall, I implore you not to spoil them.
We'll have to pay double on the way home.
It's only a twenty minute boat trip.
You'll find it all worthwhile once we get to the island, I assure you.
You mean you've been there before?
Yes, I was there for a few days three years ago.
After the death of my first wife.
Ghastlies!
Don't worry, darling.
It's only the noonday gun.
- The noonday gun?
- Yes, it's fired every day at 12 o'clock.
To commemorate the glorious victory of
Kosovo Methojiva in 1193.
I am reliably informed that a mere handful of Tyranian cavalry routed over 50,000 barberous
Bosnian fanatics.
It was apparently the only military success in their entire history.
One success too many, hm.
Arlena, darling, I love you!
That tub was even more uncomfortable than that damned taxi.
What if the bitch refuses to do the show?
We'll lose all our backers that's what, Myra, after all we'll sell the show under her name.
To think that our futures are riding on that snake! A hussy!
Welcome to the island, everybody!
Kenneth, it's marvellous to see you!
Absolutely marvellous.
It must be at least two years since you were last on the island.
It's three, actually. Wonderful to be here.
You never met Linda, did you?
No, I didn't.
- Hello, Linda. Welcome to the island.
- I don't think you know Arlena.
Yes, I do. Arlena and I are old sparring partners.
Hello, Daphne.
- It's been years.
- Well, a little time.
Years. Arlena and I were in the chorus of a show together, not that I could ever compete.
Even in those days, she could always throw her legs up in the air higher than any of us.
...and wider.
Kenneth, this is such a surprise.
When you told me of an island run by an acquainted landlady,
I had no idea it was Daphne Castle.
Yes quite. Daphne, I wonder if we could go to our rooms. It's been a long journey.
Certainly.
- Andreas! - If you are short-staffed,
Kenneth can easily carry the bags.
They'll be brought up in a minute.
There'll be cocktails tonight at 8 o'clock.
Do have a good, long, peaceful rest, Arlena!
You must be Horace Blatt's friend.
Perhaps you'll sign in.
I see you are the famous Hercule Poirot?
- You are too amiable, madam.
- Perhaps.
I hope you have not come to practise your sleuthing games on my guests?
They all have got far too many skeletons in their cupboards to join in with enthusiasm.
I don't have an intention to derange you or your guests, madam.
My desires are simple: a good valet, at 8 o'clock in the morning precisely.
...And of course some wax.
Some beeswax for my shoes. That's all.
Actually what Gilbert is going to do is a success.
I really do not know what they are going to do about that.
I really do think that the Millers have gone too far.
Kitty is my oldest friend, Rex.
- Oh, I didn't know that!
- Kitty is Myra's oldest friend.
I just told him, Odell.
How about a cocktail, Monsieur Poirot?
White Lady, Sidecar,
Mainbrace or Between the Sheets?
No, if I could have creme de Cassis or syrup de banan.
- Do you have banana syrup?
- Certainly.
Oh, my! I'm the last to arrive!
Have a sausage, dear.
You must be famished, having to wait all that time in your room.
Have you met the Redferns,
Christine and Patrick.
- Arlena, darling ...
- My favorite leading lady!
Why, Odell and Myra!
What on earth are you two doing here?
It's wonderful to see you, Arlena.
We have a fabulous show for you.
It's a real humdinger, honey!
Odell insisted that we both come over here together to see you personally.
- It's very sweet of you.
But I'm sort of retired. This is my new audience. Have you met my husband?
How do you do?
How do you do? You'll change your mind.
You won't be able to resist this one!
Keeler's mad to do it.
But we were holding her off untill you had a chance to look at it.
And Kern has done the best music you've ever heard.
Arlena, darling, it's simply sensational to see you again!
- Hello, Rex.
- How do you do? I'm Kenneth Marshall.
Excuse me.
I must talk to you, Arlena.
Not now, Rexito.
Cheers!
Good morning, Linda.
How is your lovely mother?
She is not lovely and she is not my mother.
Darling, didn't anyone ever tell you that peevishness is unbecoming in a young lady?
No. But they told me not to talk to a very strange man.
Good morning, Gardeners.
Good morning, Arlena.
I think it's gonna be a hot day.
Good morning, Mrs. Redfern.
Very well, she's in wonderful shape.
And how much was that we paid Kleinfield, Klauerwitz and Stummerhoppen to contest that phony doctor's certificate?
Twenty thousand dollars.
Arlen darling, you look quite divine in that outfit.
Say no more. It's yours.
Next question?
There's something quite frightfully important I have to talk to you about.
- So talk.
- It's a bit private.
You heard the little man, Linda.
Scram!
Well, what is it?
Arlena, I was wondering if you had the chance to read the proofs of the biography yet?
Oh, indeed, I have read.
I simply couldn't put it down.
I knew you'd love it.
What a busy bee you've been researching exactly where I was born and when?
Well, darling, there aren't too many stars who were born in Tooting Bec at the turn of the century.
It's sweet that you wrote how I was awarded my first leading role in "Flames of
Eternity". How ever did you find out?
- I bribed his wife.
- Naughty Rex!
The days of my youth.
But I shoved all that behind me now, Rex.
Which is exactly what you are going to do with your lousy book.
But Arlena darling, you promised.
When we were in New York.
And I've spent the advance.
I simply must have that released.
Forget it. You are not going to barbeque me to keep yourself in sailor suits.
Arlena, angel, you must...
I said forget it. I'm not gonna sign this release. And that's final.
You're gonna regret this, Arlena.
That's a promise.
Good morning, Mrs. Marshall. Good morning, Mr. Brewster.
Now Linda! What are you doing here?
Acting a chaperon, gooseberry or a spy?
I just wanted to chat.
It seems we aren't having much fun.
What fun are you looking for, darling?
Go and play with the jelly-fish.
Oh my god!
She runs like a dromedar with dropsy!
Bitch!
You do not care for the aquatic sports or the sunbathing, Madame?
I wish I could. But I don't go brown.
It's the sample I look after - pink skin, white blisters, and green in the face.
Unlike your husband, I observe.
No, he manages these things rather well.
Sometimes I think he must think I'm an awful goose.
But why, Madame?
I do not indulge in those sports myself and I do assure you that
I am very far from being... a goose.
Ah, there you are Monsieur Poirot!
I've just had a telephone call from your friend, Sir Horace.
He says he's having trouble with his... piffle valve?
Such a valve still has to be invented,
Madame.
Oh, well I dare say you're right,
I wasn't paying that much attention.
Anyway the result is he'll be
24 hours late..
Good morning, Kenneth.
Are you going for a swim? The water is so hot, the lobsters are coming out red.
Come along, Daddy, you promised to come for a walk with me.
Patrick, aren't you getting a little tired of rowing?
That was last night.
And this morning he starts all over again!
Andrea, I don't care.
I don't care if Monsieur Poirot wants cement on the sausages, or bootblacking on his butter, just give it to him!
I think the little Belgian will find it all on his bill anyhow.
- We'll revenge on all this!
- Very well, madame.
I'm so sorry. Are we late?
Patrick insisted on rowing right around the island.
It's much bigger than I thought.
- He is absolutely exhausted.
- Not in the least surprised.
I'm sorry we didn't take you with us, my dear, the sun would be much too strong for you.
Arlena, here you are, it's the script that I promised you.
No, I thought I told you last night.
I've given up the theatre.
These two are all
I am concerned with now.
- What's it called any way?
- "It's not right, and it's not fair".
Sounds like a black man's left leg!
- It's all right, Mr. Poirot.
- Pardon, Madame.
Please stay.
I'm just being silly.
I wish I had more self-control, didn't show what I feel.
Well that is sometimes not easy for the ladies.
Do you know what I am most sick of in this place?
- What, madam?
- Pity.
I can't bear to be pitied.
Everyone round here seems to feel so sorry for me.
I can tell it by the way they look at me.
"Poor little thing", they're saying.
"What's she has to put up with that poor fool of a husband of hers".
"What a pity she is not strong enough to compete for what she wants".
Will you allow me to tell you something, Madame?
The "Arlena Stuarts" of this world do not count, their domination is of the moment.
Really to count, a woman must have either goodness or brains.
You can't actually believe that men care for either of those things, can you?
Oh, yes, I do, Madame... your husband loves you,
I know that.
Come, let us take a little promenade.
How I wish I could do that - just lie in the sun!
Pour quoi, Madame? Look at them
- lying in rows like corpses in the morgue!
They are not men and women. There's nothing personal about them. They are just bodies, butcher's meat, steaks grilling in the sun.
I'm sorry Mr. Poirot, I suffer from vertigo.
I can't bear to look down from the height.
I'm better now.
In fact I am determined to enjoy myself.
It's so blissful here, so tranquil, so far from all violence and trouble.
Yes, you are right, Madame; the sky is blue, the sun is shining, and yet you forget that everywhere there is evil under the sun.
You are going to be late for dinner, you know.
Yes, I know. Just having a bit of a think.
About Arlena?
I suppose it's no use saying it's your own fault.
Not much.
No, and never is. How about - you've made your bed and now you must lie on it.
- Worse.
- I thought it might be.
- Poor Kenneth. You do pay on account.
- No, I can cope.
- Do you think Linda can?
- What do you mean?
She is always on at that poor child, pitching the hell out of her.
Yes, that's a pity about that.
Linda's like her mother, you see - she takes things hard.
- Why don't you do something about it?
- Like what, for instance?
Like fixing up a divorce, for instance.
People do it all the time.
With most of my friends it's almost a full time occupation.
Arlena's all right.
She just adores to flirt.
That's all. There is really nothing in it.
It's all on the spur of the moment.
Spur of the moment?! You really are blind.
Who the hell do you think booked
Patrick Redfern in here in the first place?
- You don't mean ...?
- I'm afraid so.
Even so... with me a deal is a deal.
I don't approve of quick marriage and easy divorce.
Arlena is my wife.
That's all there is to it.
Till death do you part?
Exactly.
I see.
Just kill that cow!
- What the hell do we do now, Odell?
- Just leave it to me.
- I'll think of something.
- My hero! I swear, if you were a man
I would divorce you!
Hello, darling! You'd better get a move on.
Where have you been?
I've just been having a word with Daphne.
You get on like a house on fire with her, don't you?
She's a nice lady
- Yes, I suppose, she is.
As hotel proprietors go.
- And you get on rather well with Redfern, don't you?
He's a nice fellow.
- Yes, I suppose he is, as 'Gigolos' go.
- What's that supposed to mean?
You liked him well enough when you met him at the Grangers' in London.
I've never set eyes on that man before.
Really? I could have sworn you were there.
It must have been the night of your regimental dinner.
Well, anyway what does it matter?
He just happens to be a guest here who took me for a boat ride. That's all.
He happens to be a guest here, Arlena, because you just happened to book him in.
The bitch Daphne!
Christine, I beg you not to talk about it!
That's it! You don't want to talk about it?
Oh, look here, Christine.
I can't even speak to a pretty woman without you jumping to the conclusion that I'm having an affair with her.
Well, aren't you?
You leave me here alone all day and you go off with her.
I'm the laughing stock of the whole hotel.
Of course not!
You are being ridiculous!
Arlena and I are just good friends, that's all!
I don't believe you!
Please, let's just go away.
I absolutely refuse. Here we are and here we'll stay!
If you don't like you can...
Oh Myra, that is so beautiful.
That's enough, Linda.
It's adult time. Off to bed.
Common, darling. Let her stay.
She's on holiday after all.
Scram, Cinderella.
You're the top!
You're the Colosseum.
You're the top!
You're the Louvre Museum.
You're the nimble tread
Of the feet of Fred Astaire.
You're the National Gallery,
You're Garbo's salary,
You're the Nile,
You're the Tower of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop.
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, you're the top!
You're the top!
You're a new invention.
You're the top!
You're the fourth dimension.
I'm a frog without a log on which to hop.
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, you're the top!
I'm sorry.
Isn't it wonderful?
I know how you did that.
The egg's in your top pocket
I'm not five years old, you know.
- Been for a bathe, darling?
- What's it look like?
Darling, there's no need to be snappy just because you went to bed bright and early last night.
I always keep mine behind my ear.
Oh, there you are!
I was looking for you.
I'm going sketching at Gull Cove.
Would you like to come?
Yes, I'd love to.
I'll see you down in the hall in ten minutes.
Monsieur Poirot, just the man!
Would you be very kind and help me push this out?
You require assistance, Madame?
It's like a real launch of Mauritania.
Without the champagne!
Thank you so much. And Monsieur Poirot, please don't tell anyone where I've gone.
- Everyone will keep following me about.
- Everyone, madame?
Perhaps some people more than others. I just want to be alone.
Enjoy your swim.
- There she goes. Not a care in the world!
- I'll make her care.
Oh, what do you know about care?
If it had been up to you, the good Samaritan would have passed by on the other side.
I have an idea but I need to work it out.
Yeah, well don't forget about my cousin, Hatty Heimenheimer.
It took her so long to "work out an idea," they finally had to stash her away in the booby hatch!
- Where is the fire?
- Sorry.
- Did you have your breakfast?
- I ate a piece of toast.
Linda, you really are naughty!
Andreas goes to all the trouble of preparing decent English breakfast instead of those weedy continental things. and you eat toast.
I'm sorry, I just wasn't hungry.
What's the matter? Is it Arlena?
- She is so beastly.
- You don't want to worry about her.
- Things have a habit of working out. I promise you.
Yes, if you make some.
Would you like to come for a stroll with me to the lighthouse? It'll be fun.
This must be my my lucky day.
I've never been in such demand.
I'd like to, but I can't. I've already got a date to go sketching with Christine.
That's all right. I'm glad to see you're making friends.
- Good morning, Kenneth.
- Ah, good morning.
There is a letter for you.
The boatman just brought it over.
Since your daughter has just turned me down, would you like to come for a walk with me before my staff meeting at 11:30?
I'd love to, but I'm afraid, I can't.
This must be answered straight away.
This isn't my lucky day, Linda.
But you can't get away from me at 12:30.
We're playing tennis. Remember?
I remember.
By the way, Linda, have you seen your mother?
No, thank God.
Linda, I won't tell you again...
Clean it, clean it.
Don't just lean on the thing.
Here you are.
- What a colourful outfit!
- I'm so glad you like it.
Linda and I are going off sketching, Mr. Marshall.
Don't worry,
I'll take good care of her.
See you on the tennis court at 12:30.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Have a nice time.
- Good morning, Poirot. Been swimming? - You saw me? - No.
Yes, I have been swimming.
There's nothing like the shock of cold water and rhythmic movement to stimulate the little grey cells.
Yes, of course.
That's what you've seen my wife about, have you?
Madame Marshall?
- What, she rose so early?
- She's not in our rooms.
By the way, I was looking for that fellow...
Redfern earlier?
I suppose might have seen him either, have you?
Is someone taking my name in vain?
A very good morning to you, gentlemen.
- What kind of things will we do, Ms Redfern?
Call me Christine.
Hi, Patrick! Are you going for a spin?
How about taking me along?
- So what time is it, dear?
- Five to twelve.
Lord, I must fly.
I'm playing tennis at 12:30.
That's a fine boat!
I think it belongs to Sir Horace Blatt.
Odell and I were on it once, I think.
Look. I wonder who that is.
You know exactly who it is, you naughty boy!
Would you be a sport and take the boat back for me?
I'll come back with Arlena after our walk.
Are you kidding?
I do not know how to work this thing.
Look, it's simple, this lever is put on the gear, and all you have to do is to steer.
- Well, just this once.
But don't get me involved.
You're a sport.
Hey, come on, wake up!
Oh my God!
- What's the matter?
- She's dead!
She's been murdered!
Strangled!
- It's just not possible.
- We'd better get some help!
- I'll go. You'll stay with the body.
- Are you kidding? I can't do that!
You're right.
The murderer may still be out somewhere.
- Can you make it back to the hotel?
- In a flash. This thing is no problem.
You'd better hurry!
Madame Marshall has been strangled.
There are contusion marks there on the head and the neck.
This much is evident.
We must now send for the police and acquire a doctor in order to establish the time of death.
Have you ever met a Tyranian doctor, Monsieur Poirot?
The limit of their skill is determining the fitness of an ox to pull a cart.
- That may be so, Madame, but ...
- Dear Monsieur Poirot, a word in your ear.
The whole world knows that you are a man of enormous discretion and gallantry, a man notedly privy to the secrets of kings and prime ministers, and also a man not willing to stand by and see a lady in trouble without rushing to her aid.
I appeal to you now,
I'm such a frail woman, in need of help. In fact,
I throw myself on your mercy.
Couldn't we make it a private investigation?
You know how peculiar people can be about a spot of murder.
The scandal of a famous stage star being murdered here, would ruin my hotel.
I am very sorry, Madame, but there is no way to avoid this becoming an official matter.
In the due course of time, of course, I quite agree, when it can be released in the proper manner.
But consider, just think what everyone will say if they were to discover you were here ahead of the police. and failed to solve the crime.
I mean, Monsieur Poirot, both our reputations are at stake.
- Ain't it a pong of something rotten in here.
Only of the breath of the sea.
Oh how poetic you are, Monsieur Poirot.
- You have the true soul of France.
- The true soul of Belgium, madame.
Yes, of course. How mortifyingly stupid of me!
Please forgive me.
In due course of time...
Well, what do you say, Monsieur?
Will you bring your colossal brain power to the aid of a lady in distress?
Will you clear up this hideous mess for me with all your brilliance and discretion for which the world famous...
One moment. I must carry out a little investigation of my own before answering your question.
Mr. Redfern, at what time did you and Madame Gardener find the body?
It was twelve o'clock exactly.
That bloody gun went off as we were coming round these rocks there.
As you know I sent Mrs. Gardener back for help immediately.
I touched nothing except to make sure the body was dead.
Oh yes, you acted quite correctly.
Since I was the last person to see Madame Marshall alive, when I pushed her off in her pedalo about 10:20, it means the time of death can be established as being between 10:30 and 12 noon.
How absolutely brilliant!
The doctor can give us the approximate time and how she was killed.
Which I know.
I don't need the help of a doctor.
It's a terrible tragedy, Poirot.
It's terrible.
She may have been a bit flighty, Arlena, but no one could have wished this on her.
Just between ourselves.
You may have guessed but she was the lady in question.
- That was not too difficult to guess
- I suppose it bloody wasn't.
I'd best chalk it up to experience in beyond my way.
There's no point in intruding in the grief of her new husband and all that sort of thing.
You had no chance to speak to Madame Arlena?
- Of course not. I've only just arrived.
- Of course.
There's only one thing puzzles me in that case.
You remember the false diamond
I left in your possession?
- Yes.
How did I happen to find it once again on the beach near the dead woman?
Oh, dammit, Poirot. If
I made a right murderer,
I wouldn't be leaving clues all over the place.
- All right, I confess.
- You confess?
I mean I confess I had a word with her.
I was coming in on a boat and I saw
Arlena on one of those pedal things going to the beach along there.
Anyway I stopped the boat and rowed myself over.
It was better than confronting her in front of her husband.
We had a bit of a barney.
We all pretended to be all surprised at that.
As I rowed she promised to sort it out by tonight.
- She did not tell where the real jewel was?
- No, dammit, she didn't.
If you don't mind, I'd like to get changed now.
I'm getting a little chilly, the shock and everything.
- I was very fond of
Arlena, as you well know.
Yes, you may well have been, monsieur.
And yet there are cases of men that have killed those women who made it impossible to return to the wives they really loved.
I assure you that is not the case here.
I could have taken off at any time I wanted.
Anyway, you know I had nothing to do with it.
You yourself saw me from the terrace go off in the boat with Mrs. Gardener.
It would seem that I'm your alibi.
Please go and get changed.
So this young man has been sniffing around Arlene?
No, I'd say I blame him.
I'm sorry Sir Horace, but it's my duty to put it to you that you were furious with Madame Arlena, that you were determined to get your jewel back, you came up here in order to demand it, she laughed in your face.
- You lost your temper, you strangled her
- That is poppycock!
That is bloody poppycock!
If it's poppycock, that it's most regrettable that you said in front of me that you would willingly wring her neck.
That was just a bit of chat, that's all.
Look! All I did was tell her that she couldn't make a monkey out of me and I threw that minute the glass at her.
If I had killed her, my crew would have seen me.
They were all on the deck, they were watching.
They are not used to looking at the clock when I'm at my large.
Sometimes it is the only way to move.
So if you don't believe me, ask them.
Tres bien. All I say I must ask you not to leave the island for the moment.
If you insist.
But if I were you, I would cherchez le hubby.
You'll find the favour there when you deal with the
Arlenas in this world.
It's a little dificult to accept your condolences when in virtue in the same breath you accuse me of murdering my wife, because she was unfaithful to me.
I can understand that of course.
But I hope you realize that I'm rather easier to get on with than the
Tyranian police would be.
And therefore I will ask you where you were between 11 and 12 this morning.
It's very simple. I was in here typing until
I changed for tennis a few minutes after 12.
How very curious. Because you know when I passed by your door at what must have been about 11:15.
I heard no sound.
I can't think that.
One does occasionally pause to think, you know.
Here. This is what I typed.
As you can see, it would take at least an hour to do.
With respect, you could have typed it yesterday and brought it in with you, there's absolutely no proof that you typed it this morning.
Excuse me, I just could help overhearing
I have the proof you need.
- You do, Madame?
- Yes.
Every week it's my custom to collect all my staff together to give them in a collective boot. It does in the end no good particularly the eyeties.
Keep smack to snuff as my old pappa used to say.
Anyway that meeting was this morning at 11:30 just before
I came up here to have a wash and puff my nose in here.
I saw that Kenneth work so hard.
I just didn't disturb him.
Madame, you cannot see the desk from the door.
I saw him in the mirror.
In the mirror.
My goodness, you do type fast, Kenneth.
You must be the horror of the Remington.
Tell me, Madame, how many fingers am I holding up?
Three.
And now how many?
That's not fair, you're hiding.
Madame, you cannot see in the mirror someone seated at the desk.
It is not me who is hiding, it is you who are lying.
Mr. Marshall, are you, by any chance, lying also?
It should be fairly obvious, that that letter, all eight pages of it, is in reply to this one from my stockbroker, which arrived by this morning's post at about 10:30.
It should therefore be equally obvious that I must have typed when I said I did.
Yes, it would appear so.
Now to revert to you again, madame.
I'd like to ask you a question about your promenade to the lighthouse this morning.
You went alone, I believe.
Yes, I did.
And you must have passed the bay on which Arlena was murdered.
Yes, I did.
I also saw Arlena sunning herself.
Then you must have taken the same path home.
There is no logical alternative.
And I am suggesting to you, you could have gone down to the beach, murdered Arlena Marshall and still been in time for your staff meeting at 11.30.
What utter bold!
You can't possibly think
I wanted to kill
Arlena just because this silly cow succeeded on the boards and I didn't?
No, that I do not think.
But there is a certain tenderness between you and Mr. Marshall.
Otherwise why take that absurd risk of trying to protect him just now?
What if there is?
What does it matter?
- It matters bacause Madame
Arlena was in the way.
- Monsieur Poirot, you have the French obsession.
I'm sorry, the Belgian obsession with the crime passionale.
But you are barking at the wrong tree.
- I know who did it
- You do, madame?
Of course. It was Sir Horace Blatt.
When I came back here from my walk at about 11:15,
I saw him down on the beach.
He was jumping up and down screaming blue murder at Arlena.
I've never seen a fellow in such a fury.
- Why did not you tell me this before, madame?
But he is an old chum, isn't he?
I didn't know then you are going to start hurling accusations at me and Kenneth.
But he is the chump you want.
Why don't you run along and question him?
I already have done, madame.
And he is exonerated by his crew.
All the same, his story does confirm yours. Without knowing it, you have corroborated your own alibi. Bravo, madame.
I'm sorry, Kenneth. I really put you in it. I was only trying to help.
I know. I forgive you.
I don't want to hear any more about it, Patrick.
If you hadn't been poodlefaking with that awful woman, you wouldn't have been there in the first place.
Oh, madame.
May I have a quick word with you, please?
About how you spent this morning.
- Why me? I have nothing to do with all this.
- You had no reason to love
Arlena Marshall, madame.
Perhaps not. I was with Linda all morning.
I went to her room early to ask her to go to Gull Cove to do some sketching.
She wasn't there. I mean she came along a few minutes later.
She'd been swimming.
Then we set off and we were there all morning.
If you don't believe me, then ask Linda. She will tell you.
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I'm all right now.
I want you to think about it very carefully.
At what time precisely did you leave the cove this morning?
I was there until 12 o'clock and went off to my tennis game.
- You had watch?
- No, I didn't.
How did you know it was precisely 12 o'clock?
Because when I climbed to the top of the cliff and was waving to Linda, who had gone for a swim, that awful gun went off.
The one they fire at noon every day.
What did you do then, madame?
I was late for my tennis which was fixed for 12:30.
I simply tore back to the hotel as fast as
I could and changed into my tennis things.
I went to the court right with the others.
Mr. Marshall, Mrs. Castle and Mr.
Gardener. I played with Mr. Gardener.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was sketching at Gull Cove.
I lost track of the time.
Don't worry. It's only a matter of four minutes exactly.
I'm afraid you have to come and play with me.
We'd barely started when news of Arlena came.
Of course it's a dreadful thing, Mr. Poirot.
But I can't pretend that I am now...
A little relieved. I can understand that.
Is there anything else you want to ask?
Not for the time being.
Come in.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Excuse me, mademoiselle, for intruding into your grief.
Grief? That's a good one. Why should I be sorry for Arlene?
You hated her so much?
- I'm glad she's dead.
If that's what you mean.
She was horrid to me and beastly to my daddy.
Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about this morning.
Why should I? I was with Christine Redfern.
She wanted to go to Gull Cove to draw some stupid cliffs.
And did she?
- Oh, yes. She sat under her big hat when I sunbathed.
She gets so blistered when she sets out in the sun. It's bad luck really!
Here it is. She gave it to me.
It's not bad really.
No, she has a talent, that one. These are undeniably cliffs. When did she leave you?
- Five to twelve.
- How can you be so sure?
Because she asked me.
- What time is it, dear?
- Five to twelve
Lord! I must fly!
I'm playing tennis 12:30.
She got into a fearful panic about being late for tennis and rushed off back to the hotel.
Would you like this?
- Thanks. It's super
I'll see you later after my swim.
I remember I was half way down the beach when Christine called after me
Don't forget your bathing cap!
I'd forgotten my bathing cap, so I had to go back and put it on. What a bore!
Did you see anyone else while you were swimming?
No, no one. Apart from Christine waving to me from the top of the cliff.
Look! Why don't you stop asking me all these silly questions about Christine?
She couldn't have murdered
Arlena. Neither could I.
That slimy Rex Brewster's the one you should be talking to.
He hated Arlena. He's the one who really wanted her dead.
How can you say that?
He admired her so much.
Don't be daft!
He's written that filthy book about her which she wouldn't allow him to publish.
Excuse, mademoiselle, but how do you know all this?
'Cause I heard them having a row about it on the beach yesterday.
They thought I'd gone away, but I hadn't.
Maybe he won't be able to publish it, if he is hanged for murder first.
If I can't see you faces shining in every knife, fork and spoon,
I'll have your guts for gutters, understood?
Have you any idea where I can find Mr. Brewster?
Rex? I thought I saw him going out into the garden.
He's not the one you want.
You should cherchez la femme.
Really, madam?
- Absolutely, I have been having a little think, and I worked it all out.
If Horace Blatt is in the clear, and Kenneth Marshall is in the clear, and I am in the clear, and Patrick Redfern is in the clear, and Myra Gardener is in the clear, because she was with him.
Then it's all down to little Ms. Cringe?
- Ms. Cringe?
- The jealous wife, Christine Redfern.
You don't want to believe all that stuff about her being too weedy.
Women fight like tigers, when they are losing their husbands.
Not that I've had much experience in that sort of thing myself.
But what is your theory,
I mean how did Madame Christine do it?
I don't know.
She probably battered Arlene over the head with the blue driftwood and then finished her off with a little pressure on the carotid artery.
Everyone knows that.
It is in all the crime novels.
In fact only the other day a child of 11 did something like that in Hungary.
Or was Crete?
She used a pair of nutcrackers.
Perhaps I'd better go and see if any are missing.
Unfortunately, you see there are no nutcracker marks on the throat.
Madame Christine could not possible have done it.
Her alibi had been confirmed by Mademoiselle Linda.
And vice versa.
How very irritating!
"Under the high lazy noonday Adriatic sun"
"the body lay on its back, arms outstretched parodying in the position she so often occupied in life".
That is marvellous.
You've come, Monsieur Poirot, to question me about poor Arlena.
Note that I am shattered.
I am absolutely shattered.
She was so wonderfully funny, so very generous...
Not generous enough to give you a release so that you could publish this manuscript.
Who told you that?
Never mind, but it is the truth, n'est-ce pas?
You cannot lie with the dead, now you are free to publish your saucy tales and reap the reward.
I would admit that point of view.
I assure you that loss of so radiant a performer infinitely exceeds any possible gain to myself.
You must believe that.
The time of death has been narrowed to between 11:30 and 12.
Where were you at this time?
I was on a pedalo.
On pedalo?
Whereabouts?
How should I know?
I wasn't carrying a chart at the time.
How amusing that is!
Chart or no chart, it was perfectly possible for you to have watched Sir
Horace Blatts's boat leave and then to have pedaloed into Ladder Bay, there to find the unsuspecting Arlena asleep and then you strangled her.
Monsieur Poirot, are you aware that would take nearly two hours to pedal around the island from Ladder Bay to Gull Bay?
At twelve o'clock precisely, as that boring old gun went off
I pedalled into Gull Bay.
Linda was there swimming.
In fact I nearly hit her, she was splashing around like a deaf seal.
You say that you saw Mademoiselle Linda swimming in Gull Bay at 12 o'clock.
Certainly, I asked her to help me pedal back but the little tard refused.
What do you want?
What did you say?
- I said, good god, darling. Help me pedal this damned thing back, my legs are killing me.
Pedal it back yourself.
So you see, darling,
I simply could not have killed Arlena.
If you're so anxious to find the murderer, why don't you find out who tried to murder me.
Murder you?
What do you mean?
After I'd been left by that lazy little cow Linda to rupture myself, I pedalled off.
About ten minutes later a bottle came whizzing off the cliff and smacked out on the water right next to me.
It missed my head by inches.
I looked up, there was nobody around.
I must congratulate you on that highly interesting and imaginative story.
I refer of course to your visit, your fictional visit to Gull Bay at noon.
What do you mean "fictional"? Linda!
- Mademoiselle Linda denies having seen anyone there at the time.
What? That lousy little oigger!
I know she loathes me because I adored Arlena, but this is ridiculous.
You just wait till I catch her!
Linda! You just wait!
You tell Monsieur Poirot that
I was with you this morning when you were swimming in Gull Cove.
Why should I? You weren't.
You're lying, little brat!
You just tell him that you saw me on the pedalo and refused to help me pedal back.
You hell!
- Don't touch my daughter!
- You tell her to tell him the truth.
Did you see Mr. Brewster when you were bathing in Gull Cove this morning?
- All right then, yes I did.
- Linda, you mustn't tell lies.
- You can get people into serious trouble.
- Serious trouble? Hell darling! You'll get them hanged!
- That was rather the idea, was it not mademoiselle?
I'm sorry.
Kindly accept my apologies, monsieur.
Incidentally I accept your alibi.
That's really white of you.
Now Monsieur Poirot, I am not as lucky as my dear wife. I have absolutely no alibi.
I was sitting over there rather still on the bench reading my book and between the hours of
11 and 12:15 I didn't move.
Now I am well aware, Monsieur
Poirot, that in your world when a murder takes place everyone automatically comes up with a watertight alibi.
However, I belong to that great world of milllions of innocent men and women who curiously enough don't have the foresight to provide themselves with an alibi when a murder is taking place, of which they know absolutely nothing.
Consequently, as I was guilelessly reading my book, there was no gardener to come trotting by respectfully touching his forelock and registering the time on his grandfather's watch.
In short, Monsieur Poirot,
I don't have a ghost of an alibi.
Of course,
I could have scampered off the top of that peak like a mountain goat and swarm down the famous steps over you head above and then crept upon Arlena and strangled her with these powerful hands of mine.
But unfortunately for you I did no such things.
I have a big fat motive but no alibi.
Next question?
Next question is what did you do when you had finished being unobserved in the garden?
I went up to my room again unobserved to change for tennis.
I was rather thirsty and so I rang the bell, naturally no one answered.
Where the goddamned staff had disappeared was a mystery worthy even of your talents, Monsieur Poirot.
I turned on the tap but there was no water, not a drop, now some of those running a bath down the hall fit to float Noah's Ark.
Dear God, what a time for a bath! I would have said.
Anyway, I changed and appeared suitably attired in my Fred
Perry outfit on the tennis court at precisely 12:30 to join Daphne and Marshall.
Mrs. Redfern came a few minutes later.
And that, Monsieur Poirot, concludes the case for the defense.
You make pleasantries, but no alibi... is still no alibi!
If you are looking for that,
I've got it in here.
I've been using it to solve everything out for you.
Look! I was wrong about cherchez la femme.
Sorry about that.
But it's quite obviously cherchez le fruit.
Rexy is the only one unaccounted for.
Look, I'll show you.
At 11:30 Arlena Marshall was left here alive by Horace Blatt, who then sailed on down here. At the same time Myra and Patrick were here.
Linda and Christine were here now, Kenneth was here and I was in my staff meeting.
It is just got to be our genial columnist.
And what's more, I know how he did it.
You do, madame?
Absolutely! Recently I was reading a magazine story about a woman in Malaya, who was drowned by a huge moray eel which darted out of a hole, dragged her to the floor of the ocean, its teeth buried in her throat.
That's what gave me a clue.
Rex Brewster could have been lurking in the water here off Ladder Bay and when Arlena appeared on her pedalo, he could have leapt up, pulled her off it ...
Very interesting, madame, the only snag is that Madame Marshall was not drowned.
Far less was she gnawed to death...
And perhaps even more damaging to your theory is the fact that it has been established that Monsieur Brewster was here in Gull Cove with
Mademoiselle Linda at 12 o'clock.
He could not possible have pedalled all the way from Gull Cove to
Ladder Bay in half an hour.
That's very inconvenient of him.
I mean if he didn't do it, who did?
I just don't see who could have.
Everyone has an alibi.
Oh no, they do not, madame.
Monsieur Gardener does not have an alibi and seems rather proud of the fact.
- Oh, but he does, dear, most definitely.
- What are you telling me, madame?
At 11:30 I was having my staff meeting, giving the hired help pleasing stream of the old rancid and in particular pointing out to Andreas there was absolutely no point in making your curry so hot that it actually raised welts on the surface of your tongue.
I just happened to look out of the window and there was Odell in the garden reading a book.
He stayed there through the entire meeting.
I'm positive of it.
- What's the matter. Did I said something?
- You said a great deal, madame.
I see what you mean. You mean nobody did it.
And yet we still have a body, madame
- Rigoletto
- Correct, Verdi. Che elegant!
That's funny to think if
Giuseppe Verdi had been an Englishman, his name would have been Joe Green.
I suppose it would.
Well it used to make the boys laugh when I was trying to din some Latin into them when I was a school teacher.
Little boys laugh easily if it keeps them away even for a moment from their study of Latin.
Please forgive me for interrupting the cocktail hour, but there are two questions of great importance which I must put to you.
First of all, did anybody here throw a bottle into the sea this morning? No?
Secondly, did any of you take a bath at 12:15 today?
An odd time for a blue sheen.
How remarkable! A bath which nobody admits having taken and a bottle which flies by itself.
Joe Green... It's rather more amusing than at first I thought.
- Good morning, Sir Horace!
- Hello.
Enjoyed your swim?
- Sorry, the water was freezing,
I'm running to get warm.
It reminds me of a lady policeman.
She is all out of breath.
She told her friends how she caught a burglar.
"I chased him past the grocer's, and the butcher's, and the baker's. I finally caught him by the cobbler's.
Sorry, dear. I don't find it remotely funny, Sir Horace.
I'll tell you what I don't find so funny
- that's hanging around waiting for the great detective!
Good morning, Monsieur Poirot.
Listen here, Poirot.
Not only have you not found Arlena's killer, but what is more you haven't found my diamond.
So I am off though if it's all the same to you.
The Gardeners, and the Redferns want to go too.
I can't say I blame them.
The place is like morgue.
I am so sorry.
There's nothing like a good night rest to clear the little grey cells.
Kindly ask all our friends to forgather in the lounge after they have finished their petit déjeuner.
When all will be revealed.
- What?
- You mean you know?
- Oh, yes.
Give us a few clues.
- All right, I wish you to consider very carefully.
A bathing cap, a bath, a bottle, a wrist watch, the diamond, the noonday gun, the breath of the sea and the height of the cliff.
From that you should be able to solve it yourselves.
We'll meet again in one hour.
Now I am going to have my "oeuf a la coq".
- There goes the most insufferable man in the world.
- "Oeuf a la coq", supports his remarks when he talks mostly.
Mesdames, mademoiselle, messieurs...
The reason I asked you to meet me here this morning is that I, Hercule
Poirot, have discovered the identity of the murderer of Madame Marshall.
This needs surprise no one.
Are you all comfortable?
Even the murderer?
This has been a most unusual crime in that apparently nobody had the opportunity of committing it.
Madame Marshall was killed between 11:30 and 12 noon yesterday, and yet every single one of you had a perfect alibi, including you, Mr. Gardener, without knowing it.
And I'm very sorry if
I have disappointed you.
We had undeniably a body, which meant that somebody was lying.
Who? After exercising considerable reflection,
I came to the conclusion that it was you ...
Madame Redfern.
Me?
But I didn't lie to you, I swear it.
Yes, you did, madame.
When I asked you at what time you left Gull Cove yesterday, you said it was 12 o'clock.
You knew this. You said because you heard that awful gun go off.
When you were standing on the top of the cliffs waving at Linda, who was swimming in the water below.
But Mr. Brewster was in the bay at the same time, it's very curious that you didn't mention him.
And it's even more curious when
I confronted Mr. Brewster with the fact that his story about entering the bay on his pedalo the very moment that the midday gun went off was denied by Linda, he lost his temper, he attacked the poor girl. It would've been so much easier for him to have called his second witness -
- you, madame. He must have seen you standing on the top of the cliff, and yet he made no mention of it.
Why not?
The answer is obvious, you were not there.
But I was there. And I did wave and
Linda waved back. Tell him, Linda.
It's true. She did wave, honestly.
- Yes, she probably waved but there was no noonday gun, was there?
I don't remember it. No.
- No, there was no nooday gun for a very good reason. It was not 12 o'clock.
But she asked me the time and I looked at my watch and it was five to twelve!
The watch, that is very important.
Let us go back to yesterday morning, shall we?
I was having breakfast on the terrace, an egg, and in the course of performing some slight act of
"légère de main" for you, mademoiselle,
I happened to notice that you were not wearing a watch.
It was not particularly surprising as you had been swimming, the fact that could be noted by anyone looking out of the hotel window.
You, Madame Redfern, actually told me you went to her room early to ask her to come with you to Gull Cove to do some sketching.
But she was not there.
What a perfect opportunity to put Mademoiselle Linda's watch forward 20 minutes.
A few moments later, as you told me,
Linda appeared in the corridor as you knew she would.
And you invited her to accompany you.
- Would you like to come?
- Yes, I'd love.
All right, see you in the hall in ten minutes.
Hello, Mr. Poirot.
Your plan to make Linda your false alibi was now in motion.
This is pure supposition, Poirot.
I've never heard such twaddle.
Twaddle or not, it is the only explanation which fits all the facts.
Now if you will be a little patient,
I'll explain to you exactly what happened next at Gull Cove.
Madame Redfern unseen by Linda consulted her own watch which she was wearing, but kept concealed under the sleeve of that strange voluminous outfit she chose to protect her from the sun.
It is of course twenty-five to 12 she then asked Linda the time who naturally said it was five to twelve.
Linda then starts to go down to the sea. While her back is turned,
Madame Redfern returns
Linda's watch to the correct time.
Then calls Linda back telling her she has forgotten her bathing cap.
Why should she bother to do that, you may ask?
The answer is simple: remember, at 12 o'clock the noonday gun is due to go off.
And she can take no chance of
Linda hearing and noting it.
A girl splashing about in the sea and wearing a bathing cap would hear nothing.
So let us exactly see what happened as Madame Redfern hurried up from the cove to the top of the cliff.
It is twenty to 12.
She pauses to wave,
Linda waves back.
But there is no Mr. Brewster.
No noonday gun.
Madame Redfern now turns and runs across the path which separates
Gull Cove from Ladder Bay.
That takes her six or seven minutes, no more
She arrives at Ladder Bay at about a quarter to twelve and sees Madame Arlene sitting impatiently and awaiting the arrival of Patrick Redfern, with whom, I am convinced, she had a rendezvous.
Oh, Christ!
Suddenly, to her great chagrin she sees you, madam, about to come down the ladder.
But I couldn't have come down the ladder.
I suffer from vertigo. You know that.
I only know that because you took good care to stage an incident showing me that you suffered from vertigo.
The day before yesterday on the terrace as we having a stroll and I was drawing your attention to the sunbathing figures on the beach below, you suddenly fell against me and stepped back saying you suffered from vertigo.
But she does have this problem.
She's always had it.
That is not the case.
Your wife only pretended to have it in order to prove that she couldn't have climbed down the ladder.
But yesterday afternoon, I myself stood on the cliff overlooking Gull Cove and I discovered something rather interesting.
In order to have seen Linda in the water below and to wave to her you would have had to stand right on the very edge.
Although I do not suffer from vertigo,
I myself was quite dizzy.
For you, madame, had you suffered from vertigo, it would have been impossible.
Let us now resume the story from the point at which you descended the ladder.
Madame Arlena decided to avoid a confrontation and was about to leave the beach when she noticed a small grotto at the base of the cliff.
You may well ask how I knew she had been in there.
Yesterday afternoon, not only did I discover the false diamond that Horace Blatt had returned to her.
But my excellent wine taster's nose had detected
- not as you put it, madame Castle
- a "baume" but "Souffle de mer"
"The breath of the sea".
Which, as you know, Monsieur Marshall, was her favourite perfume.
But I am digressing. You ran down on to the beach but Madame Arlena had disappeared.
Arlena! Where are you?
I know you're here.
I want to talk to you.
Be with you in a minute
Well, what is it?
Look here, Poirot. Haven't we all heard just about enough of this baloney?
Arlena was not murdered with a blunt instrument. She was strangled.
And if you would care to bend those beady Belgian eyes of yours on Christine's hands, you'll see they are too small to have strangled anyone.
Yes, I quite agree. In fact that was a major stumbling block to my theory.
- Redfern, this knocks your theory out of accord with Monsieur Poirot.
- Odell, please, you weren't even there, and I was.
Remember, I saw her lying there strangled,
Christine couldn't have done it.
I am absolutely of your opinion, madame,
In fact she did not do it.
The murder was committed by her husband, Patrick Redfern.
- Now you really are talking out of the top of your head!
- Oh, for God's sake. Patrick couldn't have done it, any more than his wife.
Don't forget I was with him the whole time between 11:30 and 12 when we came into the bay and saw her lying there.
That is the whole point, madame.
One moderately well-made young woman is very much like another.
Two brown arms and two brown legs, and a little piece of bathing suit in between.
What exactly did you see from your place in the boat, Madame Gardener?
The ardent young lover Mr.
Redfern bending over the body with suntanned limbs wearing
Arlena's white bathing costume and a red Chinese hat.
As I pointed out a couple of days ago, all bodies lying on the beach are alike.
They are not men and women, I said, there is nothing personal about them, I said.
They are like walls of butcher's meat grilling in the sun, I said.
No wonder you were fooled into imagining that you had seen the corpse of Madame Marshall, when what you had actually seen was the live body of Madame Christine Redfern.
That is why the murderer had to conceal the face because it was not the murder victim lying there but somebody else.
And who else would help Mr. Redfern, but his own wife?
And now the performance for the benefit of the witness is over.
Madame Gardener departs from the bay by boat to fetch help.
And what do you think happened, Madame Gardener, as soon as you had disappeared?
Why, the corpse leaps to her feet and runs into the grotto in order to remove Madame
Arlena's bathing costume which she had previously stripped off the unconcious woman and worn to play her part as a corpse.
I've got a point which will stop all your whole case.
Christine is as pale as pasteurized milk.
Now the question is how could I have possibly mistaken her arms and legs for Arlena's?
This covers nothing at all, madame.
In answer to your question,
I would ask you to consider the bizarre nature of Madame
Redfern's beach apparel.
When I saw Madame Redfern in the lobby yesterday morning, she was wearing a totally exaggerated garment, which completely covered her from wrist to neck.
No mere fear of the sun could have occasioned such a choice of dress, she had to wear such an odd concealing outfit because underneath she was brown as a nut.
In the grotto, after having climbed into the unconcious Madame Arlena's swimming costume, all she had to do was to stain her hands and neck something she could not have done earlier,
Why? Because Linda would have noticed.
She puts on the earrings and then she runs out of the grotto and onto the beach, settles herself on Arlena's towel and puts her great big Chinese hat over her face and lies still to await the arrival of her husband and yourself dead on cue, as it were
And this, I must admit, he stage-managed superbly, timing his appearance at Ladder Bay exactly to coincide with the sound of the noonday gun.
The rest was easy.
She now changed back into her original costume.
It was about five past twelve.
Madame Redfern bids her husband a hurried farewell.
The clock is ticking.
She runs back across the island to rejoin the path leading from Gull Bay to the hotel.
She had one more task to perform.
She must get rid of the incriminating bottle of suntan stain.
The bottle that no one would admit throwing...
So she hurls it over the cliff.
But there's bad luck to have the event witnessed by Mr. Brewster, whom it almost hit.
She reaches the hotel arriving there at about 12:15.
I myself timed the journey.
But then
I was not running like a young gazelle for obvious reasons.
Madame Redfern now takes the bath, heard by Mr. Gardner, the bath no one would admit to taking, in order to wash off the suntan.
She changes into tennis clothes and appears on the court a few minutes later, it's true, but unruffled and smiling.
A picture of innocence.
Yes, Monsieur and Madame
Redfern, I blame myself for not having seen through your little charades earlier.
But then, unfortunately not even Hercule Poirot is perfect.
From the moment you arrived here, you started playing out a series of carefully rehearsed scenes.
In such a manner that all might hear or see.
Together, there were scenes of hysterical jealousy played close to open window.
You don't want to talk about it.
Now look here, Christine. Can't I even speak to a pretty woman without you jumping to the conclusion that
I'm having an affair with her?
But you are, aren't you?
Apart you, madam, took every opportunity to give the impression that you were a physically frail woman who's no good at sports and who had to hide her skin away from the sun because it blistered and made her look like an Italian ice cream and who was altogether to be pitied as a poor little helpless abandoned wife.
Whilst you, monsieur, took elaborately indiscreet pains to advertise your romance instead of trying to conceal it, as any prudent lover would.
I think you all will agree that was a most audacious plan brilliantly executed.
Yes, brilliantly, but one thing you have failed to supply,
Monsieur Poirot, is motive.
Why on earth should I kill Arlena?
I absolutely adored her.
Adultery may be reprehensible, but it certainly is not criminal.
Nor is that you had adored her, you adored her money, and more specially, the magnificent diamond offered her by Sir Horace Blatt.
Those who teach Latin to small boys are not exactly overpaid.
You are not at all the romantic figure you like to present.
You are a hardened adventurer and a vicious swindler, who had absolutely no moral compunction in borrowing the diamond from Madame Arlena and of substituting a paste copy.
- Oh, pray, do continue,
Monsieur Poirot.
- Oh, yes, politeness is very much part of the act.
You knew sooner or later your deception will be discovered.
Too bloody right.
And you had to eliminate the only witness capable of exposing you.
And when better opportunity than on holiday in a small exclusive island where you can plan and excute her murder?
Picture to yourself the scene, mes ami, the half-lit grotto. Madame Arlena's slowly returning to consciousness and so, solicitous Mr. Patrick prepares le moment just to strike.
Suddenly his hands are around her throat.
She struggles and it is the end of the poor, foolish, beautiful girl-bird,
Arlena Marshall.
And that, mesdames, mademoiselle and messieurs is the story of the murder of Arlena Marshall.
The only thing they had not foreseen, was the presence on this island of Hercule Poirot.
The well-known romancer and teller of tales.
Excellent plot line.
Imaginatively conceived
Good, clear narrative style. I give you nine out of ten, Poirot.
I'm deducting one mark for total absence of proof.
Is that true?
Do you mean we sat here and listened to all that and you can't prove a word of it?
Unfortunately,
Mr. Redfern is absolutely right,
I haven't a shred of evidence. Although that is unquestionably what happened.
I don't think we need to sit here and be insulted by this fanciful little mountebank.
Come along, darling.
Shall we go and pack?
Just give us five minutes,
Mr. Poirot, and I'm sure we'll be able to work out how you did it.
After all, where were you at the time of the murder?
You let that pack go scot-free and I haven't even got my diamond back!
You've made a right cock-up, Poirot.
How very kind of you to see us off!
Farewell, good-bye, dear friends.
I don't think there will be a necessity to leave a forwarding address.
Just a moment, Mr. Redfern.
Haven't you forgotten something?
Why pay, Patrick?
They've done nothing but insult us.
Oh, we must pay, darling.
After all, we wouldn't want anybody to think we were cheats now, would we?
- I know you'll take a check.
- Certainly.
Of course, I also know that you're thinking the check may well bounce, but I'm afraid that's as good as it gets.
- Here you are, dear. I've put a little extra on for inconvenience.
Thank you so much
Would you mind me saying something, Miss Castle?
Your ensemble does absolutely nothing for you. Good-bye.
One moment, Monsieur Ruber.
- Mr. Felix Ruber.
- What did you say?
- Who the hell is Ruber?
- Felix Ruber is the widower of Alice Ruber, whose strangled body had been discovered on the Yorkshire moors some months ago.
I was called in by the
Trodd Insurance company to examine the police report.
In the event of Mrs. Ruber's death her husband was a beneficiary of a large sum of money.
The police were satisfied that it was the work of a madman or a tramp.
And so was I, since the only possible suspect, the husband, had a cast-iron alibi, which had been established by a woman-hiker who had found the body earlier in the day.
But last night I asked myself a strange relation, an innocent witness, a change of time.
Could the similarity in the pattern of the events here on the island and those on the moors be a mere coincidence?
No, mes amis, the lonely hiker was none other than Madame Christine Redfern.
While Monsieur Ruber was on the train, undoubtedly attracting attention to his presence before potential witnesses.
The bigamous Mr. Ruber was now free to return to his surviving wife,
Madame Redfern.
You were clever enough to avoid putting your signature in the hotel register but, you know, the signature on this check is really quite good enough.
Different names, of course, here on the claim form for Alice Ruber's insurance policy it appears as Felix Ruber and here on the hotel check it appears as Patrick Redfern.
Different names, but undeniably the same handwriting.
My God.
You were wrong to tell me that little joke about Giuseppe Verdi being called Joe Green in English, or that you had once taught Latin to small boys.
It was at that moment that I realized that in that language
Felix Ruber is Redfern.
You see, it is folly to try and trick
Hercule Poirot even in a dead language.
Do you really think anybody is going to believe the evidence of a couple of scribbled signatures?
And your bloody silly word games?
If my modest assumptions are too fanciful for you, then perhaps a photograph of a hiker and the mourning husband which must have appeared in the local papers and which I of course have sent for will be enough proof to hang you, sir.
You will be arrested for the murder of Alice Ruber and of Arlena Marshall.
But before that, there is a small favour
I would like to ask of you.
Would you smoke the pipe which has been conspicuous by being unlit since you arrived here?
No?
As I thought.
Sir Horace, please be careful to whom you give it next time.
My god, you're a wonder, Poirot.
Poor Monsieur Poirot.
Brave Monsieur Poirot.
I have just had a telephone call from His Majesty and he is very pleased with the matter being...
The King of Tyrania?
- Yes, he is very pleased with the matter being cleared up so quickly and so discreetly.
He's is so pleased, in fact, he's awarding you the Order of San Gudro the Inquisitive.
- San Gudro the Inquisitive?
- First Class.
How many classes are there?
THE BODIES SHOW SIGNS
OF CARNAL VIOLENCE
This painting of St. Sebastian is in effect a Hellenistic statue... set against a magnificent
Renaissance background.
His martyrdom and suffering leave us relatively unmoved.
Notice how Perugino, that Umbrian peasant... could transform the local rustics into saints and madonnas.
Notice how he surrenders to this tragedy of pain and suffering with lyrical indifference.
Perugino was reluctant to paint blood... so his tears are like drops of dew under his eyes.
His scenes rarely exude an air of drama.
This is true of his St. Sebastian in
Stockholm and also of the one in the Louvre.
Everything is bathed in an elegance approaching the supernatural.
Here, the figure seems to be traced directly from ancient Greece.
In a very personal way...
Perugino had absorbed the lesson of the great Piero della Francesca... only to decline in his later years into a sort of convoluted and provincial formalism... that decidedly undermines the power... and originality of his later work.
That is all for today.
Come on, Dani.
I want to ask him something on the way out.
- There he is.
- Professor.
Excuse me, but what you were saying about Perugino...
Don't you think your analysis was a bit too severe?
Go on.
In the St. Sebastian in the Louvre... you completely ignore the intensely spiritual aspect of the figure.
Why, it's practically overflowing with holiness.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.
You think he was capable of spirituality?
Vasari says Perugino was a person with so little genuine religion... he could never make anyone believe in the immortality of the soul.
Just imagine an atheist painting saints and Madonnas.
I agree with you, Professor... although I find it strange that he never painted any blood on the bodies of his martyrs.
He was a painter, not a butcher.
He was a self-made bourgeois... who was selling sentimentalism without any true passion or drama.
I think you're going a bit too far.
We'll talk about this again.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Daniela, can I take you home?
No. Jane's taking me home.
- Bye.
- Bye, Stefano.
You didn't have to be quite so rude to him.
He been hounding me for 10 years.
He can't take a hint.
He chose the same major as me just to be near me.
And now summer school.
You won't find many guys that devoted.
I hope not.
Flo, are you coming with me?
I have something better to do.
Then good luck.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Son of a bitch!
- What happened?
I'll take care of him!
Sean, come here! Let him go.
What do we care if he was peeping?
Sean, come here!
Where are you going?
Answer me!
Are you there?
Need any more pictures?
That's enough.
All right, cover the body.
- Is the prosecutor coming?
- Yes, we informed him.
Didn't you see that car first?
I wasn't standing here.
I was over there.
Fact is, Inspector, we don't have proper facilities out here.
So we... How can I put this?
We "litter." It happens.
What do you mean by "litter"?
How should I put it?
Well, let's not mince words.
I was gonna take a crap.
Only when I saw him today,
I got all constipated.
- It's all blocked up in here, you know?
- Take his statement.
That one's 1,000 lire.
Are you making a few sales under the counter today?
Yes, and I'm buying too.
I bet you are.
Junk and castoffs.
I'm too expensive for you.
Good-bye.
- Who's he?
- He's a doctor.
At least he knows how to keep his hands to himself.
- Carol!
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hi.
How are you?
- Have you seen the paper?
- No. Why?
Wait.
- You haven't heard?
- No. What happened?
- Uncle, could you hand me the paper?
- Keep it.
- I'll see you at lunch. Bye.
- Bye.
You were a good friend of Flo, weren't you?
STUDENT AND HER LOVER
FOUND MURDERED
This can't be happening!
Daniela!
Classes have been canceled today.
Don't you think this Pieta is one of the most sublime representations of Christianity?
I hope you're here to rethink your opinion of Perugino, Professor.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
My reason is much more banal.
No, I confess I'm just here by chance.
But the banality of chance sometimes hides more important underlying meanings.
One of these could be our meeting here now.
Or perhaps I'm mistaken.
What do you think?
Don't tell me you believe that strange theory that chance is the child of necessity?
Somewhat.
But don't mind me.
I'm still shaken by that girl's death.
- Jane, can I buy you a drink or something?
- Why not?
I hope you can see me as more than just an art history professor.
You have the nicest eyes when you haven't got your glasses on.
Please don't make fun of me.
I wouldn't dream of it.
You really surprised me the other day.
I did. How?
I would never have imagined... that an American girl could be so moved... by works of art depicting a past that doesn't really belong to her.
I don't know whether or not to take that as a compliment, but I will.
Just proves that some Americans know how to be less American than other Americans.
Then you didn't come to Italy to buy the Colosseum?
No, only to study it.
I studied art history.
Then I taught for two years.
Then I decided to specialize and applied for a scholarship in Italy.
- Do you like music too?
- Of course I do.
Great.
If I happen to get a couple of invitations to a concert at the Academy...
- would you like to join me?
- I'd love to.
- In fact, I'll count on it.
- Thank you.
There's no need to thank me.
It's been a pleasure.
- Good-bye, Franz.
- Good-bye, Jane.
I told you...
So it's over like that?
At your convenience?
- I never promised you a thing.
- You slimy little worm!
They saw us. Damn it!
- Good-bye, handsome.
- Bye.
Come on, honey. Take off all the rest.
I've got another appointment with a good customer.
What's wrong?
I get it.
You want a little persuasion?
You're cute.
What's the matter?
Are my hands cold?
Listen, honey, if you give me a little more, we can make love in front of the mirror.
I even have some porn films.
Swedish stuff.
That's a nice start.
Why do all the hang-ups come my way?
Honey, even if you're queer or impotent, you're not getting out of this.
You have to pay me just the same.
Don't you ever call me that.
Don't you ever say that to me.
You're crazy!
A GIFT FOR EVERYONE
- I'll buy this one.
- All right.
Carol! At last!
What happened to you?
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you in ages.
Nothing. Nothing happened.
Sorry, I have to go.
I have some errands. I'm already late.
- What's the matter?
- I have to go, sorry.
Hey, Dani!
No.
First you two have to take your clothes off.
Why not?
You both sicken me!
If I catch her,
I'll beat the crap out of her!
- Are you hurt?
- Jesus! What a fall.
- If I catch her...
- Forget that bitch.
- I'll kill her!
- Let's get the bike out and go back.
What you see on the screen... is not a work of abstract art.
What you see are fragments of cloth... found under the fingernails of one of your classmates... who was barbarously murdered just one week ago, Flo Nicholson.
We have definitively traced these fragments back to this scarf... which was used to strangle Carol Peterson.
Her body, like that of her friend, showed signs of carnal violence.
I want you all to look at this.
If any of you think you've seen something similar... maybe on a friend or classmate... it is your duty to report it.
It's not spying.
It's your duty.
I hope you all agree this killer must be brought to justice at once.
And I hope that, at least in this case, you will consider the police for what they are... the men who protect you.
After that you can happily go back to throwing stones at us in the streets.
Turn on the lights.
That's all. Thank you.
You can go now.
Daniela, what's wrong?
Jane, I have to tell you something.
Stop worrying about it.
The inspector upset you.
Don't you realize I must be the last person to see Carol alive?
How could that be?
I saw her get on a motorcycle with those two boys, Peter and George.
She was in a terrible state.
It was almost like they kidnapped her.
- It's your imagination.
- It isn't!
But those boys weren't wearing scarves.
See? I don't know what's got into you.
Let's go home.
And yet I'd swear I've seen somebody I know wearing that scarf.
Please, let's go.
Hello.
Hello!
If you don't want to end up like your friends... don't try to remember who you saw wearing that scarf.
Red and black could become the colors of your death.
Who is this? Hello.
Hello.
Who's calling? Answer me.
- Dani!
- Oh, God!
I'm so afraid.
Try and calm down.
You'll have a nervous breakdown.
Stay here.
Don't leave me alone.
Why don't you stay at the villa for a while?
Up in the hills, far away from the dirty air of the city?
I have to go to Paris tomorrow night.
I don't like leaving you here by yourself.
Invite some of your friends to go with you.
I'm sure you'll be able to forget your fears up there.
You must know everybody around here, right?
No, Inspector.
It's like a seaport, this place.
People coming and going.
All sorts of races, all sorts of colors.
What's this routine?
"I wasn't there. If I was, I was sleeping."
No. I keep my eyes open, but...
What do you want to know?
For example...
Did you sell this?
I sell them by the dozen.
I think they're Japanese.
1,000 or 1,200 lire.
It could be one of those.
Could you have sold this one?
Maybe last month.
I don't have any right now.
Do you remember who might have bought it? It's very important.
I'm not exactly a department store, but I sell enough... that I can't remember who bought a scarf... one, two, three months ago, or who knows when.
If you do remember, call me at headquarters.
Ask for Inspector Enzo Di Salvo.
Hello?
Who am I?
You know me well.
I'm the vendor in the piazza.
An inspector stopped by a little while ago.
He asked me some questions.
I don't like this city air.
I need a vacation.
It might help me forget who bought that scarf.
Two million lire will be enough... for now.
It ought to pay the initial expenses.
What?
Okay.
Yes, we can meet there.
See you tonight.
So let's all meet at the station tomorrow at 3:00, all right?
Check out her miniskirt.
She's hoping for some action tonight, since we're fasting this weekend.
- Bye.
- Bye, Dani.
- Dani.
- You again!
Dani, I have to talk to you.
- It's important.
- Why don't you leave me alone?
Why don't you go away?
I've got to speak to you.
You're going to listen.
I need you.
Well, I don't need you!
You've got to belong to me alone, or to no one.
Classes have been canceled today.
No! Let me go!
Go away! Leave me alone!
Open this door!
You can't treat me like this!
Who's up there?
- What's going on?
- Who's that on the stairs?
What are you doing up there?
- Hello?
- Hello, Jane.
Can you come over right away?
I must talk to you.
It's urgent.
- It's Stefano.
- What?
He was wearing that scarf the day Flo died.
I'm sure of it.
Come on, Dani. Let it go.
You need some rest.
No, Jane. I remember it so well.
Stefano was really wearing that scarf, and he didn't ever wear it again.
What have you got against that boy?
He's so strange, so violent.
He frightens me.
- And then...
- Then what?
Swear you won't tell anyone.
Swear it.
Of course.
Don't you trust me?
Last night I received a phone call from the killer.
He threatened to kill me... if I tell anyone who I saw wearing that scarf.
Who's there?
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
- Good evening, Jane.
- Good evening.
I came to say good-bye.
I have to go.
I'll phone you from Paris when I arrive.
- Take care of her, Jane.
- All right, but just for tonight.
I can't go up to the villa tomorrow morning.
I have some errands to run.
- But you said...
- I told Ursula and Katia. I'm sorry.
I'll be back in a few days.
You better dry off.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, sir.
Bye, Uncle.
- But you promised...
- Yes, but you can't go on like this.
I want to talk to Stefano and prove to you he has nothing to do with these murders.
I'll drive up later. Don't worry.
Excuse me.
Does Stefano Vanzi live here?
- Third floor, Apartment 8.
- Thank you.
Stefano?
Anyone home?
Can I come in?
Stefano.
Dear Dani, I don't understand why you reject me... but I know one day you'll understand me.
Do you remember the promise you made me when you were a little girl? And yet...
I was looking for Stefano Vanzi.
Is he here?
My grandson left this morning.
Je ne saispas where he went. He left.
He's gone.
Look at those thighs.
Brother, from here you can see the source of the Nile.
Did you see it?
What are you doing? I'll make you wish you'd never looked at her.
Come on, girls.
We've got a long ride ahead.
Bring the bread and the milk every morning.
Please don't forget.
Of course. Every morning.
Thank you.
Pretty legs, eh, Baloc?
If you could only speak to 'em, how they'd love it.
The way they looked at you.
You saw.
Why don't you go up to the villa and pay them a visit?
- They're expecting you.
- You're actually going?
No kidding.
You could measure 'me for shoes.
Like the Shoemaker and the Elves.
What they came here for is a strong man like you.
Don't miss your chance, Baloc.
FORTUNATELY YOU DON'T WASH YOUR CAR
I HAVE TWO TICKETS
FOR THURSDAY'S CONCERT - FRANZ
With all the windows barred, it seems like a prison.
There's no one here most of the year.
It was a paradise for thieves, so we put up the bars to discourage them.
God, she's late.
I can't believe Jane hasn't arrived yet.
It's strange.
Why didn't she call?
There we are. Bye.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, signorina?
Can you show me the road to Villa Aselli?
You're here. It's right up the hill.
The car needs a wash.
Can I pick it up in the morning?
The road's dark. I'll go with you.
Then I can bring the car back down.
You're very kind.
I'll be right back, Luigi.
They told me she left over two hours ago.
I guess she found something better to do.
Stop joking. I'm afraid.
I'm worried...
Girls, you gonna open this door or not?
It's Jane.
- At last.
- Wow! What a trip!
- Hi!
- Hi! How are you?
- You tried to escape?
- Sure did.
- Daniela was worried about you.
- Well, she was right.
She knows how I drive.
I've cleared the whole thing up.
Stefano has nothing to do with it.
Of course.
Stefano's scarf was different.
His had a red design on a black background.
The one the inspector showed us was just the opposite.
I'm so confused.
If Stefano wasn't wearing that scarf...
I don't understand.
I know I saw it on somebody.
Look, forget about the scarf.
I won't hear any more about it.
Now, I could do with a drink.
Then I'm going straight to bed.
What a terrible day.
Those three birds aren't for the likes of us.
- Forbidden fruit's the best there is.
- They're some grapes.
Well, the owner's niece is really ripe.
She's gorgeous.
I wouldn't mind spoiling her a little bit more.
- What about the black girl?
- Black girls never attracted me that much.
- I think they're hot.
- I like white girls better.
That's how he gets laid so much.
You got it all worked out!
If I had a second with her,
I could get her knocked up.
What do you have? Sperm vision?
I still think...
I'm off to bed.
See you in the morning.
- Good night.
- Good night.
It's about time!
Come on, you lizards.
Breakfast is here.
- What happened?
- My ankle.
- Let me see.
- It hurts!
Bread and milk.
- Okay, but be gentle!
- Calm down. It's not bad.
- Calm down.
- It hurts.
- I don't think it's broken.
- It hurts.
Why the hell are you standing there?
- Go get a doctor. Quickly.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.
I don't think it's anything serious.
But if the swelling hasn't gone down by tomorrow...
I'd recommend you go back to town and visit a specialist.
In case you can't sleep tonight,
I'll leave you these.
Take two.
Some vacation.
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- You might have.
On the train! I remember now.
You were in the same compartment.
Yes, that's right.
- You weren't with your friends.
- I came later by car.
If we have to take her back to town, I can drive.
It's not like my leg's broken.
I can drive myself tomorrow.
Don't do anything reckless.
If you need me, you know where to find me.
- I'll see you to the door.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye.
That doctor's all right.
Not bad.
I think it would be better to take her home.
Especially if she's not feeling better.
Excuse me.
Hello? Oh, it's you, Uncle!
How are you?
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
But where are you?
Paris?
It sounds as if you were calling from the next room.
Yes.
We'll be here until Monday.
- It's like ice!
- I told you so.
Stefano!
What are you doing?
There's no one there.
But someone was there a moment ago.
It looked like Stefano.
Come on. It was just some Peeping Tom.
It was Stefano.
Let's go home now.
If it was Stefano, he would have answered, right?
Hurrah!
- To Jane's ankle!
- Bottoms up!
Nisidine and champagne. Cheers!
- She won't wake us up in the morning!
- Let's let the patient rest.
She'll be back in shape tomorrow if she doesn't do anything else reckless.
There's a piano downstairs.
Should I play something for you?
- Yes!
- Come on then!
- Good night, Jane!
- Good night.
Sleep well.
You want the lights on?
No, thanks. Turn them off.
The pill's already having an effect.
This is no fun.
You aren't even listening.
What are you doing?
Do you have a call boy?
If only. No, I want to see if Stefano's at home.
Forget Stefano.
Besides, it's late.
If he answers, I'll hang up.
Hell. It's out of order.
- Who could that be?
- Maybe the doctor wants to do some overtime.
Funny!
Who's there?
Come on. What are you waiting for?
Open the door.
Stefano!
Damn, I slept late.
Wake up, sleepyheads!
Aren't patients supposed to have their breakfast in bed?
Ursula?
Katia?
Dani?
Bread and milk! Anyone home?
I have to pick up the empties!
Anyone home?
- All on a desert island.
- Naked.
- In a storm.
- In a storm? Why?
- It's more emotional.
- You need an assist?
Oh, no.
I'm telling you, Doctor.
The pain starts here and goes all the way down to here.
Didn't you say your husband was ill?
Yes, but it's killing me.
When we get up there, maybe you could treat me too?
It's the same house anyway.
That's strange!
What are you doing?
This is just great!
What if you catch him too late?
What are you doing? You're parked on a curve. How am I supposed to see you?
So write down my license plate number and report it.
Your license plates?
Come back here!
You bastard!
Eight legs, each more gorgeous than the next.
Ever since they got here, you can't even count. It's six!
Eight! There are eight!
You never argue about gorgeous legs.
Six! Not eight!
But since they came, two more arrived.
Eight legs, eight tits and four sets of ass.
Get out of here.
You never set foot in that villa.
Moron!
You're the morons!
I tell you there were four girls up there!
The fourth one came by car.
Her car is still down there at the filling station.
Go see for yourself if you don't believe me.
Three or four or a thousand... We can't lay a finger on 'em in this lousy town!
What happened? Did a tank hit you?
Damn! What a mess!
It was my fault.
I parked on a curve.
American plates.
Whose is it?
Belongs to one of the girls staying up there at the old villa.
She left it here to be washed three days ago, but I haven't seen her since.
I drove it up there myself today, but no one was there.
Yes, she sprained her ankle.
Perhaps one of her relatives came to pick her up.
Strange. They must have left last night, because...
I've been here since early this morning.
No one's come down all day.
- Fill it up, Doctor?
- No, thanks. Not now.
Jane.
Don't look at me like that.
I had to do it.
I had to, Jane! I had to!
They were only dolls.
Stupid dolls made out off lesh and blood.
But you're not like the others, Jane.
You're different.
Everything would have been different with you.
It was chance and necessity.
Remember?
In me they're monstrously inverted.
It was chance... that drove me to the necessity to kill.
If you let me see you without your panties...
I'll go and get your doll.
No. Mama says you're a bad boy, and so's your brother Franz.
Go get your own doll then.
All right. I'll let you see.
But first you've got to get me my dolly.
- You promise?
- Promise.
- Careful. It's slippery.
- No, don't worry, Franz.
Gianni!
He kept falling and falling endlessly.
And then he hit the ground.
That sickening thump... as the body hit the rocks.
And the blood sprayed everywhere!
Blood all over the rocks.
Bitches. Bitches!
They're capable of doing anything to humiliate and exploit you!
Like Flo and Carol.
They knew my brother's accident had left me mentally ill.
They knew I couldn't... have normal relations with women.
Then they started blackmailing me.
Filthy bitches!
But... they didn't know what was in store for them.
I killed them.
I hacked them to pieces like dolls.
Those two were blackmailing you.
But why did you slaughter the others?
Dani saw me... the day I followed Carol... when she was on the back of that motorbike with those two boys.
Dani would have remembered sooner or later... that Carol left with those two... and I had the scarf.
I couldn't give her time to remember.
The colors... were reversed.
The one Stefano had is red on black... instead of black on red, like mine.
But that must mean... you killed Stefano.
Yes. He came here.
He saw me.
Death is the best keeper of secrets.
Why did you come here, Jane? Why?
A doll!
You're only a stupid doll like the others!
Let's get out of here.
Perhaps...
Perhaps there really is something written in the stars about our situation.
If that truck hadn't hit me by chance...
I would never have known you were still here.
Some people would call it providence.
Franz called it necessity.
'I'll be gone about a week.
'Oh, by the way I brought a pillow.'
Oh, well let's see...
Mitchell, Joan.
Oh, you've been here before so you know.
But just for the record, dining room, kitchen, fully stocked.
And this is Billy.
He fixes things, does the gardening.
Delivers groceries, liquor, medicine, mail.
Sells brushes, vacuum cleaners, etc, etc...
Oh, he does the gardening, the painting, etc, etc...
Oh, you've never wanted the 'etc.'.
Well, maybe this time.
You've really to get with it,
Mrs. Mitchell.
You know it's later then you think and all that. And Billy's great.
Through here, the garage. And the den, with a sewing corner and books.
All the latest.
And television, three sets - the den, in here and upstairs.
With... special programming designed to give you ideas.
In case you should run out of ideas.
And the ladies, of course.
You look beautiful!
Oh, I love your hair!
They're available for luncheons and teas and bridge etc, etc, etc...
- Oh, you're big and gorgeous.
- ...shopping, visiting... and upstairs.
Oh, your daughter.
Your daughter's room.
Bath, pills and things.
Supplies in the cabinet.
Bedroom with everything you need.
Walk-in closet.
All the nowest clothes.
Jewelry and check books.
Oh, and the phone number, for doctors, police, priests, neighbors, stores.
And let's see... etc, etc...
I guess that's about everything.
Oh, don't forget to pay the bills.
Have a good day.
Oh, are you up, hon?
Have a good day, hon.
Dreams... what are they?
Truth is something that's very difficult to live with.
And because of this, we spend a great deal of our time covering it.
But truth will out and we dream.
The least qualified person to understand a dream, is the dreamer.
Which brings us to you.
Daughter's grown up, doesn't need a mother anymore.
Husband is active, deeply involved in his business.
You feel isolated, uninvolved.
You feel imprisoned, trapped.
But actually, the only person imprisoning Joanie is Joan.
- She's a witch.
- She speaks very highly of you, Shirl.
No, really I mean it.
An honest to God witch.
- You're joking!
- I'm not joking either.
The whole bell, book and candle routine.
I always said she was weird.
What does she do?
I mean she's into it, the whole thing.
I know. Isn't it wild?
I have this image of Marion Hamilton, running around naked, killing ghosts.
She says a lot of that stuff's hogwash.
But they do have meetings and ceremonies.
It's like a religion with them.
My next party's all planned.
Why didn't you have her tonight, Shirl?
Well, I asked her but she couldn't come.
Oh, probably off dancing in the circles.
How's the moon tonight?
Shirl, from you
I need an adjective.
An adjective? Oh, Christ.
- Fantastic, I just can't...
- I know. Isn't it wild?
- Give me an adjective.
- Oh, hell...
- Sexy.
- Sexy? OK.
- When do I meet her? Come on.
- Joanie, baby, a noun.
- A noun?
- I can't believe she could be a witch.
Oh, John.
Come on, that's not fair.
- All's fair in love and mad-libs.
- Oh, come on. Let me give you...
The first word that pops into your mind... God.
- Sylvia.
- You're a fake, John Fuller.
A noun. A plural noun.
- A plural noun.
- Plural noun? Tits.
You said it, I didn't.
- Joanie, can I get you another drink?
- No thanks.
- How about you, Syl?
- I always want another drink.
Hey, Larry.
Sylvia needs a hit.
Hey, everybody!
Come on, we're going to have a dirty reading.
Quiet!
Shh, quiet now.
We're going... sit still.
We're going to do the reading of this great, epic masterpiece that we have just put together.
Shut up.
OK, this is a reading of
"My Favorite Television Program".
Are you ready? My favorite television program is the one
- where Jack Mitchell...
- Oh!
- Jack Mitchell works at the dog pound.
- Absolutely!
With the aid of his trusty sidekick, Liberace...
...brings Catholicism to evil-doers, and intercourse to a lawless town.
'How long will you be away?'
'Oh, I guess about a week.'
Jack?
Mm?
I think we're doing OK.
Yeah, we're doing all right, kid.
Oh, my God!
Jeez, Joanie, you scared the hell out of me.
Why don't you just get back to sleep?
I got to leave.
Say, I wonder what time
Nik got in last night.
You know, one of these days that kid's going to get in trouble.
Oh, she's old enough to take care of herself.
You... just get back to sleep.
'I'm paying my own dentist bills.'
- 'What do you mean?'
- New edict.
I don't take care of my teeth, so I've got to pay my own dentist bills.
- When did all this happen?
- The other morning.
Nik, you know he's not going to hold you to that.
That's ridiculous. He just wants you to take care of yourself.
That's OK. So long as it's not his responsibility, he'll stop bugging me about it.
He respects that and I respect it.
It's OK, I guess.
- That's not the point.
- Of course, it isn't.
The point is that my teeth are not about to rot out of my head because I don't use an electric toothbrush.
Hey, you really look good.
Well...
I guess you never really think of your mother as having a great body.
You really look good.
Wow.
Well!
- I gotta go.
- See you tonight?
Yeah.
Mary here yet?
No, I don't think so.
- No, she's not here yet, Mom.
- OK, hon'.
I wonder how many women, well let's say wives...
How many wives actually do get involved?
Oh, I don't know.
I've thought about it.
- I really have thought about it.
- Anyone I know?
Oh no, it's no one specific.
It was just the idea of thinking about it.
- Kind of academic.
- Good God, Joanie!
You're a Catholic, sweetie.
Isn't an academic thought just as bad as doing it for you people?
Just thinking about it makes me feel guilty.
Like I'm hiding something from Jack.
Hey, maybe Marion can fix us up with a man-getting potion.
We can black market it and turn 3 million in Collinsburg alone.
I wish you hadn't said anything about
Marion to Syl and the rest of them.
- I know what you mean.
- Well, with me going and...
Oh, hell. I figure a witch for an exhibition is first order.
I still think it's kind of scary.
If the mousse tastes chalky, don't eat it.
- What?
- You know, the "Rosemary's Baby" bit.
You're the first reluctant person
I've ever heard admit to being afraid.
I could write a book on some of the excuses people give when you offer a tarot reading.
Well, that's because it's the real thing.
Well, yes, something like that, I suppose.
You know actually, the playing cards are just descendants of the old tarot cards.
That's really wild.
I didn't know that.
- They're so different.
- Well, some of them are.
The major trumps for example, they're easier to read.
They have more information.
I have some that are marvelously done.
Really quite beautiful.
They're strange.
Some people feel that way at first.
I find them pretty.
I'm not trying to sell you, Joan.
You're perfectly welcome to just be curious and visit.
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- I wish I had a hundred like you.
- You do?
'Cause I have five hundred.
I'm just joking.
At the risk of embarrassing you further,
Joan, I did bring some extra cash along.
These women that run around without their purses.
Actually, I'd rather not have cash.
I'd like you to just go home and put something in an envelope.
Whatever it's worth to you.
Oh, and... don't make it a check or anything that will identify you.
I'd rather not know where it comes from.
I suppose you both think that I'm being very noble but I'm being rather mercenary.
I think people are more generous that way.
And I've never had to worry about people not sending me something because... I guess they're afraid not to.
That's beautiful.
As a Sagittarius, the strength of The Emperor here is even stronger for you. hope, light and harmony.
The Star always brings hope.
Hope may not be fulfilled.
But hope will exist.
The changes are all adverse.
All indicate failure.
But, they're all specific and classically related.
Romantic love has failed, possibly brought about by your own stubbornness.
A dark haired woman is involved.
Strength and hope keep you armed through all this, while not changing things for the better, making things bearable.
- Does it fit?
- Jesus.
I'd say it's very little relation to you as you are in a general sense.
It definitely points to a particular situation.
One dominant situation that must very nearly totally occupy all your thoughts.
- Wow.
- I take it it does fit. Does it help?
I don't know.
I don't know what it does.
It could be just a fluke, couldn't it?
It's so easy to read your particular situation.
But like you say, it's so specific.
- Yes.
- Sort of makes you a believer.
You'd know better than I whether it's accurate.
Well then, what is it?
What does it do?
- Well, it's this way...
- I'm sorry, I know I must sound...
No, that's all right.
It's a religion really.
My... mother was a witch.
And... my father belonged.
So it was really quite simple for me.
And, of course, in today's age, with anything goes, a lot of people are beginning to take it seriously.
When I was a child, I was taught certain recipes and incantations.
Then I was sworn to secrecy.
Today I could just go down to the bookstore and find a paperback primer for witches.
Mail order houses will supply you with the necessary ingredients and tools of the trade.
- Tools of the trade?!
- You know, funny black hats...
Yeah, I see. Yeah.
I honestly think that everyone, underneath their prejudices, knows that there's something out there...
...that we haven't got the power to define.
'Nikki must have some of her friends with her.'
'Gregg, this is Shirley Randolph.'
- 'Hello.'
- Gregg Williamson.
- And, this is my mother...
- Oh, but we've met.
- We have?
- Yeah, trying to think.
- The university or...
- Are you a student there, Gregg?
- Student teacher.
- What department?
- Sociology.
- I don't remember...
- Oh Joanie, the fix-up thing.
- What's that?
You know, the community fix-up thing.
Oh, the pitch-in program.
- Yeah, the pitch-in program.
- Did you work on that?
Oh, I was... I was just...
Sure, that must be it.
I was kind of roped into it myself.
But I don't remember.
Well, maybe we just saw each other around.
Could be, but...
I really wasn't around the campus.
- I was...
- In the field. Yes, so was I.
Community relations kind of thing.
Oh man, what a fiasco.
- It was rather ambitious.
- What were you?
- I was a painter.
- Great.
As if we don't pay enough in taxes, we have to clean up their homes for them.
Don't you think that's sort of misguided?
The motives were good.
The methods fucked it up.
Shirley, what are you drinking?
And what about voodoo?
Voodoo only works because people believe it works.
You meet a guy who believes in the power of voodoo or something.
He knows that 'X' has been put on him.
He worries himself to death.
That's how these casts work.
They put the voodoo on you, they make sure you know you've been voodooed.
I mean, they send you the sign or stick pins in a doll or something, make sure you know about it and your mind does the rest.
- It's all a mind trip.
- Oh, come on!
How can you kill yourself by just that?
You know, by... by just thinking about it?
What do you mean? You think yourself into a ulcer, don't you?
People worry themselves into heart attacks.
There's a goddamned good chance people think themselves into cancer.
- Stay drunk, people.
- Stay stoned. It's all a head thing.
OK, now you're talking about ESP, mental telepathy, that kind of thing.
- Yeah.
- Clairvoyance. That kind of thing?
No, but I'm talking about a real physical thing, whether it's some kind of radio signal or whatever.
I'm not talking about that crystal ball mumbo-jumbo...
You say you have to believe it strongly enough.
- For it to have any effect on you.
- Well, I'm a witch, right?
- OK.
- And I do my mumbo-jumbo, right?
- Well, I hope not.
- No, I'm serious.
- Sex without love.
- OK.
So, I'm the witch. I do my thing, and if
I believe it strongly enough, it'll work...
- Well...
- ...according to your theory.
You can't say no.
Now, you're talking about moving the scissors by thinking about it, right?
How can you say that's impossible?
- I can't say it's impossible but I doubt it.
- How can you say that?
- What can I tell you?
- Say it isn't so.
Look, nobody knows.
I mean, who knows?
I feel it.
I feel it.
Somebody is voodooing me.
Oh, where does it hurt?
Come on, tell us where it hurts.
- It hurts...
- It hurts in your gut, right?
- I told you your guts were going to rot.
- I have to find your powder room.
I have to get rid of this voodoo.
I've got to find your powder room so I can get rid of this terrible curse.
Wow, she's really zonked.
Well, we really should be going.
I should be getting her home.
She's incredible.
- Well, you were really rotten to her.
- I wasn't rotten to her.
- Yes, you were.
- I wasn't rotten to her!
- She's rotten to herself.
- Well, so she has hang ups.
- Oh, hang ups, Jesus.
- Look, that's just the way she is.
Oh, now will you come off that?
I mean, that's just a cop out, Nik.
Establishment's victim?
Jesus, she's got life in her.
She's just too damned uptight to do what she wants to do with it, right?
I mean, she's your friend.
Am I right?
It's just that she's going through a difficult thing right now.
What the hell!
- Gregg. What are you doing?
- I'm going to turn her on.
Oh, come on now, Gregg.
That's really dumb.
No.
I'm going to give you an opportunity to see the power of the mind.
- She smoke?
- No.
- What...?
- Just gonna slip her a little grass.
Hey, wait a minute.
That's mean.
What's mean? We're not really going to do it but she won't know that.
Oh, come on.
It'll blow her mind.
Precisely the idea, Watson.
Now wait a minute, Gregg.
I'm not going to let you do that.
- Why not?
- Shirley is a friend of mine and...
I'm not going to stand by and see her humiliated.
It won't be humiliating, it'll be revealing.
- Gregg, I think it's really dirty.
- I won't let you do it!
What's the difference?
I mean, she said herself.
She's bored and looking for kicks.
She's proud of it, for Christ's sake.
We're just going to make her think that she's had the biggest kick she's ever had. It can help her, really.
But that's not why you're doing this.
You're doing it to make fun of her.
You know it might help you a little too.
- What do you mean by that?
- You mean you're not curious?
Curious about what?!
Curious about grass.
Curious about the effects of grass.
You're putting me on.
We're gonna try it.
You ever try it?
- You're putting me on.
- I'm turning you on.
You're putting me on.
Where did you get that stuff?
Nikki's growing a patch out in the backyard.
- Come on, you're putting me on.
- Yeah, he's putting you on. He's a brat.
- Oh, sure.
- Your lovely sweetie, sweetheart.
You'll never see your daughter alive again.
- How do you grow it?
- Doesn't everybody?
Could you reach the lighter over there?
You're putting me on.
It's really easy. All you got to do is take a real deep drag and hold it in as long as you can, right?
Joanie, your parties are really getting swingier all the time.
Come on.
Just take a drag, inhale it.
That's it.
That's it.
Let the bird of paradise crap on your head.
Oh!
Oh, God. That's wild!
Come on, Joanie!
You said you were going to try it.
- Oh, that's OK.
- Come on, Joanie!
- There's plenty more.
- Sure.
Come on.
Can you feel it?
Joanie, I may have to spend the night at your house.
Oh, I'm sure she...
Shirley, would you do something for me?
I want you to count.
Count? Erm...
One, two, three...
No, no. OK. Backwards.
Can you count backwards?
- One...
- No, Shirley. Count backwards from...
One minus one...
Two minus, erm...
Erm... two minus...
Two minus two and counting.
Two minus two.
All systems go and counting.
Blast off!
- OK, just relax now.
- Oh, my God. My heart's beating fast.
This thing is really powerful...
- Gregg! Stop it!
- Now come on, Shirley.
- Gregg, that's about enough!
- No, no. It's OK.
She's just beginning to get into it.
This is wild.
- Just like the real...
- Oh, good grief.
I mean, this is really something.
You're not going to worry, right?
- Never.
- Right, right! Never.
You're never going to worry about anything.
- Are you worried about something?
- No.
- You worried about something?
- No.
- Yes, you are, Shirley. What is it?
- I'm worried about my heart, damn it!
I'm telling you there's nothing to worry about.
I'm no young chicken, I mean...
Joanie's a young chicken but I'm no young...
Are you worried about your age?
- Age before beauty.
- Come on, now! How old are you?
- I don't like you.
- How old?
- Come on. How old?
- Older than you!
- How old, Shirley? How old?
- Past the prime, OK?
- Who told you that?
- What do you mean, who told me?
- Where did you get that idea?
- Can't you see?
Can't you look and see?
I mean... look!
OK. OK.
But does that bother you?
Oh, no.
No, it doesn't bother me.
- But you know what it does?
- What?
It pisses me off!
Gregg!
Why does it piss you off?
Why? Come on!
- Because I'm not finished yet.
- What do you mean?
- I'm not finished with...
- With what?
- Come on, Shirley. With what?
- I want to do things.
Stop this!
I want to do something besides...
- Besides what?
- Gregg, you've got to stop this now!
- Besides what?
- Shirley, are you OK?
Damn you!
Shirley, we're going up now.
Come on.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I want you to stop this right now.
- I really feel weak.
- Look, it's OK. Relax.
I'm speaking to you, you freak.
- Now listen.
- I ought to take you out and...
- And what?
- Come on, Gregg.
- I could say something to you.
- I'm sure you could.
I could tell you why you are reacting this way.
Because I'm furious.
Is that good enough?
- It'll have to be, won't it?
- Gregg, come on.
- You OK, Shirl?
- That's just a stimulant.
You know,
I'm not supposed to take stimulants.
It wasn't real stuff.
I'm not kidding you.
It wasn't real stuff.
Then what's this in my brain?
Smog?!
Must be.
I'm sorry, Shirley.
It was a stupid thing to do and... I'm sorry.
Oh, boy.
Boy, it shows you how tight my head's screwed on.
- Come on. I'll call Larry.
- Joan, give me a little...
Wow!
Presumptuous little bastard!
Oh, hey Joanie...
If you don't mind,
I think I'd better go home.
- No. Why don't you stay?
- Hey, why don't come over there?
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, come on over.
I mean, Larry won't be able to jump all over me if you're there.
Oh, come on!
I mean, we can have lots of fun tomorrow.
- Please Joanie, come on!
- OK.
- You sure you want me?
- Yeah, come on.
- OK.
- Well, hurry, will you?
I'll just be a minute.
Hurry.
Hey.
You, er...
Should I say anything to her?
I asked you to leave.
I left and I came back.
- Look, I wanted to...
- Do you know, you're...
- You're an egomaniac.
- You're paranoid. So we're even.
- Let's stop calling each other names.
- Look, young man...
Look, lady, I am not trying to put the make on you.
- What?
- You don't have to turn me off so hard.
- You don't have to compete with me.
- Why, you...
Look, that is a silly flapped out old lady.
She's exactly what makes this country ugly.
Now, don't tell me that you don't know that.
And don't tell me that you weren't with everything
- I was trying to do with her.
- No, I wasn't.
- Oh...
- It was cruel and insensitive and...
And I asked you to leave.
And I left and I came back to say I was sorry.
I don't know.
I mean, I thought insensitivity was in.
I'm sorry, Mom.
We shouldn't have stayed.
- Are you seeing him, Nik?
- On and off. It's no big thing.
Well...
Well, I guess I'll take Shirley home.
I'll probably stay over there all night.
- You'll be OK?
- Sure.
You really ought to try it sometime, Joanie.
It's the newest thing...
...recognition of self.
- New concept in group therapy.
- Hey, you know what I think?
How can anybody have so many opinions without ever having done anything?
I'd like to know who in the hell you think you are.
You think it's so outlandish.
Well, you're getting there too, kid.
Over the hill.
One of these days you're going to find yourself lying there with some jackass between your legs.
Oh, but it's easier to hear it from flaky old Shirl.
Let flaky old Shirl just spill her guts and tell the world what a poor cat she's become in her old age.
You may never have to admit to yourself that you'd like to cut loose and do something.
How long have you been here?
That's beautiful, Mom.
That's just really beautiful.
Her things are gone. She's gone!
Do you have any idea what the statistics are in runaway kids?
- Statistics?
- And even more important, what the statistics are on how many of them come back after a couple of weeks when the accommodations turn out to be not quite what they're cracked up to be?
- OK, so it's not my fault. Right?
- Well.
Shall we buy that?
It's not my fault.
- Do you buy it?
- I'm worried about her. I...
I'm more worried about me than I'm...
...than I am about her.
I'm worried about... me.
It's this... whole thing.
I'm worried about what's happening to me.
At last, I think we're getting somewhere.
I think that's a very healthy, sensible, honest reaction.
What's the matter with you anyway?
Jesus!
I didn't know what I was doing.
- Your own goddamned daughter, Joan!
- I didn't know what to do.
Your own goddamned daughter balled in the next room and you go with it, because you didn't know how to handle it.
What the hell is that?
You are sick, woman.
You don't know how to handle it.
I'll tell you how to handle it.
You kick some ass, damn it!
You kick some ass!
Jesus Christ!
Do you have any relatives out of state where she might have gone?
No.
Nobody at all?
Somebody in California, New York?
We had some business friends that moved to New York
- but I don't think that...
- Let us do the thinking, Mr Mitchell.
Mrs. Mitchell, you mentioned seeing a car out front when you got home.
It was one of those little ones.
- Like a sports job.
- Yeah.
- A Volkswagen?
- No.
No, it was one of those new cars.
- A Pinto or...
- Compact?
A little one like that.
It had a funny back.
You don't know any of your daughter's friends that have a car like that?
- No, not that I know of.
- These damn kids.
OK, in private.
- Thank you.
- Taxpayer's prerogative.
Well, I...
I'm not going to say anything about what you did because...
...there's no use in it.
I haven't told anybody who you are because there's no use to that either.
That is unless Nikki's pregnant, which seems to be her father's only concern in the matter.
Well, she's not.
- Are you sure?
- What are the numbers?
92% sure.
Well, anyway, that's not why I came today.
I wanted to know if you knew where she is.
No.
Well, did she go to town?
- Is she in the city?
- I don't know.
Didn't she say where she was going, what she was going to do?
- Did she want to be with you?
- No, we weren't into that kind of thing.
- She just wanted to get out of there.
- You weren't into that kind of thing?!
No, we weren't into that kind of thing at all.
We were friends.
Come on, don't give me that shocked routine, lady.
Isn't that the image you have of all us kids?
Just living up to the image.
Is that the way it is today?
I mean, really?
Is it so hard to buy?
- I can't understand it.
- What's so hard to understand?
It's very rattling to somebody like me.
What does that mean?
It's hard for me to accept something like this.
It's hard for me to accept somebody like you.
Well, it's hard for me to see how I'm so abnormal.
Because I dig sex?
You're really something.
Those remarks you passed the other night.
You were really thinking about me...
- ...that way, weren't you?
- What way?
- What way? Come on, say it!
- I don't think that's very normal.
- What? Normal?
- What kind of person do you think I am?
I told you the other night I wasn't trying to put the make on you and I meant it.
I couldn't even figure out how you got there, but you were there.
It was in your head, not mine.
It's in your head right now,
Mrs. Robinson, whether you know it or not.
That's the way things are today.
You slob!
Look, just let me say, if you're interested, I'm not going to turn you off.
You conceited son of a bitch!
If you really feel that way about it, you can storm out of here, insulted.
But on the off chance that you're interested in that information, lady,
- I'm available.
- You'll never know, Mister.
- One.
- Zero.
Jack, is that you?
Operator, there's somebody trying to break in.
Please, hurry.
Stop it, Joan. Stop it.
Stop it.
- Oh, Jack...
- What the hell are you doing?
I don't... I don't know.
Hell, you just had a nightmare.
- It was so real.
- You're telling me.
I've got the bruises to prove it. Jeez!
I'm sorry.
Why don't you go and get some hot milk and just go to sleep, will you?
Go to sleep.
Are you a witch?
Chalice, thurible, knives - they're all witches' tools, you know.
- I'm just interested in it.
- You're kidding.
- I mean, I was just kidding.
- Well, I'm just interested in it.
Hey, that is really great.
"Beans of fire, this charge I cast.
"In thy burning presence, no phantoms may last."
"Blade of steel, I conjure thee to cause all things as named by me.
"Blade of steel, I conjure thee to prevent such things as named by me."
Yeah?
Yeah.
What the hell does he mean by that?
Oh, he's a jerk.
He's just a gold-plated jerk.
How the hell do I know what percentage of stock he's got?
Look, I sure as hell don't like him in there, calling the shots.
It really pisses me off,
I'm telling you.
What are you gonna do about it?
Philosophical attitude, my ass!
All right. I'll see you in Philly.
Son of a bitch.
Burns my butt! I'll kill you.
If that kid gets home when I'm gone, you tell her I'm gonna kick some ass.
Well, I got to get some ashes.
Jesus, I hope that church isn't crowded.
Nema.
Nema.
Live, morph, revile.
Do you realize that I had to be at the airport at dawn?
It wasn't even light out and I had to get up.
I'm sorry, Joanie.
I shouldn't have hit you.
'Double. Your drink or your bed.'
'Both.'
- Pass.
- One spade.
- Pass.
- Two spades.
- Pass
- Four.
- Yours.
- Wait for me. You can't start by yourself.
- How long is Jackie gone, Joanie?
- About a week.
- I don't know whether I like that or not.
- I think it would be glorious.
With super klutz working out of the house, he's home from nine to five.
I don't get a minute to myself.
I don't know why you people get married in the first place.
Well, it got a little more difficult each day to get make-up on in the morning.
I think I married so I could sleep in.
- Ha!
- Relax.
She's one of those people that needs ten hours.
Well, if I were married, I'd be upset if my husband was always out of town.
Don't pay any attention to them, Joanie.
I think you've got a good thing going.
- I don't know whether I'd like it or not.
- What do you know? You're too young.
I have small kids.
Maybe when they're a little older my vocation won't seem so important.
- I'm sorry, Joanie.
- It's all right.
- What are we in, spades?
- Yeah.
- My lead?
- Joanie's.
- My dumb, old big mouth.
- It's all right, Gloria, really.
Have any of you girls thought about taking some courses this spring?
- Is there anything new?
- They've got this yoga course.
They've got this absolutely gorgeous young man teaching it.
I can't wait.
Wait till you see me in my leotard.
Can you see me trying to stand on my head for an hour?!
No, but you should get some sort of exercise, not too strenuous.
You're kidding.
Putting on my coat is strenuous for me!
- You should do something.
- I think probably a diet first.
Have you heard anything about that doctor?
Three friends of mine went to see him and they're all in hospital.
By the moon, by the star, by the light in my hand, by the breath within me, by the earth which I touch, by the names of the spirits, by the resplendent angel...
...together with the princesses of Mercury and earth,
I conjure thee, that you send down to obsess and torment the body, spirit, soul and five senses, of a mortal named Gregg.
Gregory Williamson.
That he come.
That he come to me tonight, and that he accomplish my will.
Hello?
Gregg?
Don't you know who it is?
Weren't you expecting a call from somebody?
The old lady?
I find that... my evening is free.
This isn't going to be any kind of regular thing, you know.
You'd better go now.
Aren't you even going to say thank you?
- I think we'd better call a truce.
- OK.
But if it's going to be effective, it's got to be based on an understanding.
- OK?
- OK.
An understanding of what's going on here.
I understand what's going on.
You have your reasons and I have mine.
But no excuses.
And no pinning any guilt.
I understand what's going on.
I'll say thank you if you say thank you.
Thank you, Gregory.
Thank you, Mrs. Robinson.
You're not bad in the sack.
Not bad yourself...
...kid.
Oh!
- Bitch!
- Truce, remember.
You really want me to go?
Soon.
I want to become a member.
I thought you were intrigued by it when you were so afraid.
Being afraid is necessary to believing.
I know that it's real, that it works.
I've actually caused things to happen.
We'll have to talk about it.
We'll have to see if you can learn.
It's a long process.
We'll have to see if the interest is as great after all the study.
It's not a question of interest.
It's a question of knowing, of believing.
It is involving, isn't it?
Well, we'll have to see if we can help.
It's so easy to start relying on it, forgetting what it's really meant to be.
It won't work, more often than not, if you use it foolishly.
It's not like the stories.
You can't use it to turn on the lights or switch a television channel.
And you've got to feel that way about it.
I mean really feel it... inside.
Don't play with it.
Don't use it lightly.
Knowing you've abused it can destroy you from within, with fear, if nothing else.
This is Mrs. Mitchell.
Lieutenant...
Where is she?
Is she all right?
How long will it take?
Three or four days then.
Thank you very much. Bye.
Gregg?
- What's that?
- A drink?
- I mean what's that?
- That is me.
Oh, I see. You missed a little.
Thank you for coming.
Is that OK? Thank you.
Right off the bat. Part of the truth.
Don't you think we should come inside, or don't you mind the neighbors watching?
Do I detect a note of middle class morality?
I don't mind making it on the lawn.
You want to make it on the lawn?
Come on.
- Thank you for coming.
- OK.
- I mean it
- You're drunk again, Madam.
- I want to talk to you about something.
- Ah, can I have one?
- Mm?
- Drink.
- I want to talk to you about something
- OK.
- What the hell is this?
- Gregg...
Gregg, please promise me you won't say anything about...
You won't talk the way you talk, you won't ridicule it. Please.
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you.
I know you're not going to understand.
You're gonna think it's stupid and you're gonna hate it.
I'm a witch.
The other night when I called you...
...I knew you'd come.
You had to come.
I made it happen.
I was fooling with it, using it.
- Oh no...
- Don't say anything.
I know what you're going to say.
- Gregg, please listen to me.
- Do you want to just calm down?
I was fooling with it.
I'm afraid of it.
I'm so afraid of it,
I've got to do this.
You've got to help me.
It takes two people.
Yeah, well.
- What is all this gonna do?
- It's a conjuration.
- We're gonna conjure something?
- Someone.
- Ah, we're gonna conjure someone.
- Please, I'm afraid of it.
OK.
Honest to God, I'm afraid of it.
I've got to do this.
- Got to do what?
- You've got to help me.
- There have to be two of us.
- What do we have to do?
Like showing faith.
It's calling on one of the...
One of the what?
- One of the lords.
- We're gonna call up the Devil, right?
- Virago.
- We're gonna call up the Devil, right?
So you can say, "I'm sorry for messing around with your stuff."
- Don't, I'm afraid of it.
- Hold it!
Jesus Christ, you'll really go off the deep end looking for a cop out, won't you?
You had a little sex on the side.
You got that?
It's something you always wanted and something you finally got.
But you can't buy that, can you?
Well, I say bullshit.
First it's your daughter that's screwed up, then it's me, right?
Lady, it was you who did it, you who wanted it. You!
And now you run around saying,
"The Devil made me do it."
Stop it! Stop.
Now you just hold it.
I'm here, lady, flesh and blood, OK?
All it is is balling, lady.
I mean, you're getting balled.
That's all it is, balling, lady.
Being of paper,
I name thee Virago.
Being of paper,
I name thee Virago.
Thou art Virago.
Thou art Virago.
Thou art Virago.
By Satan,
I conjure thee, o holy Virago.
Virago, who knows the secrets of the earth?
Who rides with the wind and is endowed with the powers of the moon?
Descend and be present.
Descend and appear to us within this circle.
Oh, you're one for the books, lady.
I won't fuck you anymore.
Nikki's coming home.
Nikki's coming home.
They found her in Buffalo.
I'll try not to skip over the line, sweetheart.
I don't want to see you again, Gregg.
Well, it's your loss, lady.
O holy Virago, we allow thee to depart and go to thy proper place.
So mote it be.
No!
No!
OK, Jerry, toss me the keys.
I'll get the bags in the back.
I'll get it.
Ah, thanks, Jerry.
That's wonderful.
OK, Jack. See you at the office.
- I'm getting your seat all wet, Jerry.
- Are you going in early?
I'll probably sleep in.
Why don't you stay home tomorrow?
You made enough money for the company. They owe it to you.
I don't know.
I have to see what happens.
This business with the kid.
Jesus, it's rough.
Stay home.
I'll make excuses for you.
Spend some time with your wife for a change.
- Maybe I will.
- OK, stay loose.
Thanks for the ride, Jerry.
I'll pick my car up on Sunday.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, now.
Son of a...
- From whence dost thou come?
- I come from the north.
A place of great darkness.
- Where goest thou?
- I go to the east in search of light.
- What passwords did thee bring?
- Perfect trust and perfect love.
I, whose charge it is to guard the sentinel of the north, do forbid thee to enter here.
This holy place may not be entered from the north until the traveler is first purified and consecrated.
Who will speak for you?
I, guardian of souls, so do.
Child of searching leave the darkness and approach the sentinel of the north to receive the bonds and the blessings.
'Did you get confirmation on the angle?'
- 'Top of the stairs.'
- 'Shot through the door.'
'Look at the glass, and the wood and the windows.'
'The gun was a 12 gauge shotgun.'
Fire bonds us together.
The water bonds us together.
The stone bonds us together.
'I believe he was a hunter.
There's a box of decoys in the cellar.'
'Didn't he have a key?'
'That chain was on the door. He got back a day early.'
'She thought he was a prowler.
'Doesn't matter if she's lying or not. She'll get away with it.'
First, bless the feet that brought this child in these ways.
Second, bless the knees that shall kneel at the altar.
Third, bless the organ of generation which brings us existence.
Fourth, bless the breast formed in beauty by the food of life.
Fifth, bless the lips that shall speak the holy secrets.
'We could run a check on insurance, other motives.'
- 'Probably nothing big.'
- 'Just look at him.'
'Damn women, they get it all in the end.
'They wind up with everything.
Poor bastard.'
'Put it in the report as accidental.'
Why do you enter among us?
I would know myself for what I am.
Swear you will always be true to the art.
I so swear.
So mote it be.
Hi, dear.
How about your drinks?
Everything, it runs the gamut.
We've playing day and night. You make these little men jump on the points.
Next thing you know, you've got money in your hands.
She's so absolutely stoic about it.
It was terrible at the time.
We were all terribly distressed but that's all water over the dam.
I must admit, I'm just a bit envious.
- Am I rotten person, Joanie?
- You are a rotten person, Sylvia.
Everybody's talking about you.
So good to have you back in circulation.
It's an absolute coup having you here today.
Lara, I want to talk to you.
- I can't get over how young you look.
- Thank you. Why?
- I don't know. You're the one...
- I'm a witch.
Positively spooky. Joanie,
I want you to meet Karen Zimmerman.
Karen, meet our guest of honor.
Oh, Germaine.
Here, Germaine.
Oh, you horse.
I think it has a lot of truth.
I'd really love to get together some time.
Can I call you?
Germaine, Joanie.
You remember, Jack's wife.
OK.
''This story is entirely true...
... since l entirely imagined it''.
OK.
Personalities from all over the world have met today...
... to wait restlessly...
... for the arrival of the president Marc Jary.
The president will be welcomed by the enthusiastic crowd... and will arrive at the ceremony in the presidential car... on Victory boulevard.
President Jary will serve for another 6 years... as the chief of state. according to the people's wish.
He was elected for the second time
... and has been transformed into the most important figure inn the country
... while enjoying wide international support... and winning the elections by a margin of over 300.000 votes
- Briefly, please. Mr. President, which political line you will adopt for thee next years?
Bernard Shaw said...
''There are people that are seeing the things as they are...
.. . and are wondering ''why?''... and there are people that are dreaming at things as they never were. ..
... and they are wondering ''why not?'' l will try to be among the last ones.
Up there, on the terrace! l saw him shooting!
- To all the crews
- Building 244Bl
The sniper is there!
Block all the exits!
Press communicate.
By presidential decree, an inquiry committee... was designated to establish a detailed report... about the circumstances that led to the death of the president Marc Jary.
The committee is directed by...
Frederick Heiniger,
President of the Supreme Court. ..
... and composed by Mr. Hugues Adler. ..
... the Secret Services Director...
. .. Mr. Robert picart, Secretary of Justice...
.. . Mr. Albert Philippe. senator...
General Anthony Baryn. the Secretary of Defense... and Mr. Henri Volney,
General Attorney.
The inquiry. lasting over an year, is close to its end.
20.000 testimonies, 30 annexed volumes... evidence. 682 pages. this is the report that will be handed to the chief of state...
... and that will be soon published.
The report conclusions are:
President Jary was killed by 3 bullets... shot from a semiautomatic rifle
Winchester Magnum. caliber 338.
The killer name is Karl Eric Daslow...
.. . and the murder was premeditated.
Daslow was a neuropath, an unstable character and a loner.
Daslow acted single.
No complicity was proved...
... nor conspiracy.
During the arrest Daslow committed suicide.
Signed: Heliniger committee.
Thank you. Mrs. Lapierre.
Do you agree with these conclusions, gentlemen?
Perfectly agreed.
Then we will all sign this document. l'm very sorry, gentlemen...
... but l cannot sign this report.
Camera 2, focus on Volney!
Attention please, 20 seconds
The photographers are invited...
... to occupy the designated places!
Attention please, 5 seconds!
Good evening Today at 4:00 pm all the telexes of the world... were receiving the most astonishing and unexpected information:
A member of the Heiniger committee...
... refused to sign the inquiry conclusions.. . over the circumstances of president Jary's assassination.
That man is Attorney General,
Henri Volney... who is with us tonight in our show
''One man, one event''
Attorney General. this evening you are the men that made the event.
So we will kindly ask you to answer the questions... of the 5 members of the committee you took part of...
. .. of the international press representatives... and of those who want to participate in this show...
... calling 7. 7 7 7. 7 7 7.
Mr. Heiniger. you are the president of the
Supreme Court and of the inquiry committee.
For this reason l will ask you to start the debate. l would like to ask Attorney General
Volney a very simple question:
For a whole year you have participated in all the different stages...
... of this elaborate and exhaustive inquiry.. . yet you never once explicitly expressed your disagreement.
Why are you doing it today?
Mr. President...
The year that you speak of was the year of the inquiry. l had no reason to go against an ongoing inquiry.
Today l cannot agree with the conclusions of this inquiry.
Please! l haven't finished! l would like also to ask Mr. Heiniger a question.
A very simple one.
Please. is it true that, along with the inquiry... you received a directive from the highest levels... to establish that Daslow was the only shooter...
... and that there was no conspiracy nor plot?
''I wouldn't take the responsibility of starting a 3rd World War'', you declared then.
Did you received this directive?
- Yes or no?
Mr. President of Supreme Court...
Please allow me to help you.
You will answer that nobody received such a directive... and that l have no paper to prove the contrary...
. .. and all this will turn against me.
You will also tell me that I've made up all of these allegations...
.. . but then l will show the document...
.. . that proves the contrary...
.. . and all of this will turn against you.
President Heiniger, do you take this chance?
Yes, l received that directive. l mean this suggestion...
... this wish. more exactly.
But l swear l didn't follow it.
Thank you.
So. General Attorney. on one side we have those that signed the report...
... and the other side, you, a brave man of justice, alone against all?
No, Gral. Bryan, no...
- l must state that all the
Heilnlger commission members...
... are honest. serious, advised. ..
. .. and of outstanding character... conscious of the greatness of their mission.
We are flattered. Mr. General Attorney.
''You are all correct, BUT... ''
But what?
What are you blaming this committee of?
What l am blaming this committee of...
... is a certain state of mind.
We are all sincere when we say. ..
''we want the truth and nothing but the truth''...
... but we all hope that this truth... will be different than the one we obtained.
- A comfortable truth, that bothers no one...
... that dispels the rumors.
A truth that melts the mysteries...
... and keeps our image intact.
What  are you talking about?
What are you afraid of?
- I'm afraid to admit that in this country... certain political problems can be solved through assassination.
This is unacceptable!
-Mr. President, allow me to recess. .. because of these insults to the country's honor!
Sit down, General Baryn!
- The truth has no honor, nor country it must be accepted as is.
Jack Turner. France Press...
General Attorney, you think Daslow is innocent?
Mr. Turner. do not rush to conclusions!
- After one year of elaborate inquiries we've come to the following conclusions.
Once Daslow is the assassin of the president Jary. l respond: it's possible.
- Two: he acted premeditated.
My opinion: possibly.
Three: Daslow was insane... l answer that nothing allows us to state this... because l don't find anything in this report to prove his dementia.
Then, did he commit the murder being insane. .. or we are declaring him insane because he committed the murder?
- Fouur t says that Daslow lacked the family warmth. that he was emotional lee instable and he wanted to take his place in history with this gesture.
There are countless like him all over the world...
.. . but they don't shoot presidents.
Five: it says that Daslow acted alone.
Unfortunately, l can't tell that for sure.
Finally. six: Daslow committed suicide.
And l answer to you - Why not?
Finally. l have 6 doubts regarding the 6 allegations above.
Quiet! Everyone at its time. please! it tells me that all the phone lines are blocked. l suggest you to listen a viewer's question.
Mr.? Mrs.?
Like thousands other citizens of this country...
... l liked president Jary. l want to know what will happen now.
Mr. Heiniger, would you like to answer?
Mrs., the 4th article of the inquiry committee mandate says.. . that if one of the members refuses to sign the final report... the committee is dismissed. and the one opposing to its conclusions.. . is authorized to start the inquiry from the very beginning.
This person. Mrs., is the General Attorney - Henri Volney.
Good night. Pierre.
''You were incredible!!!!'' l think he passed the whole night in the office.
What makes you say that?
He wasn't shaved yet when l arrived.
Hello, gentlemen.
Please allow me to say. ..
... how gad l am that you are beside me.
Thank you.
That's all?
- These are the only images caught by the only camera focused... on the official convoy. at the moment of the assault.
The enthusiastic crowd broke the cable and the camera was disconnected. it took 3 4 mm  to restore the connection, and when was it was restored...
... all was done already.
The drama took place over the disconnection interval. l see.
When the camera started again
I recorded a small piece of film. lf you want to see it
- Of course.
At this moment the bar pattern appeared... and the assassination was announced
That's all.
Max play the last sequences.
Stop!
We must find that man. lf his camera was working. he surely captured the murder on tape.
Check al them labs...
... and find his name and address.
Fine
So I'm wedged in the office, right?
That's age's privilege. pal.
We must publish an announcement in all the papers.
''We are looking for any amateur movie of the assassination of president Jary''.
''Please send the tapes at this address
General Att. Henri Volney, P. O. box 405''.
''Reward''.
No, ''substantial reward''.
No, we don't watch any of the movies, it's all automatic.
The tapes enter on one side...
... and on the other side are thousands of km... of baptisms, weddings and holiday memories...
... ready to be sent out.
Here are the first results of the published announcement.
We already got 5 films since this morning.
8mm wide. 16mm
4 films without sound and 1 with sound.
Bob?
We must continue this. 2. 800 labs...
... aren't so much though.
Here? OK.
We are watching the great moments of cinema. lf you are interested...
. .. call Mr. Sanio at 8. 463. 742.
We have a case with a master of suspense here.
He has the business sense too.
Mr. Sanio?
- Yes, Robert Sanio.
This is Mr. Keler, my attorney.
Come in, please.
Take a sit.
How much. Mr. Sanio?
After l discussed this with my wife... if l give you this film it means that l will lose it for good.
Me and my wife are very attached to this film.
How much. Mr. Sanio?
That we would like to be put into the account of the cancer research foundation.
Your generosity gives you honor.
Of course, you will also give  client, let's say... the amount of...
- Mr. Sanio, you are the most expensive film director of the country.
Take this to the office 4 1 2. l would like to add. because I'm an honest guy... that I've already sold the movie a year ago. right after the event.
To who? l do not recall the company name... but l didn't sell it to no one else, that you can be sure of.
Al right.
Here. l made a copy.
Maybe two of them, right? it's not the time for filming!
- Get out of here!
Max. rewind l will tell you when to stop.
Stop. Play.
'' it's not the time for filming!
-Get out of here!''
Stop!
Curious... Don't you think?
The first bullet hits the president from ahead... but few people are looking in the opposite direction.
Maybe somebody shouts at them.
So you're saying that during the assassination...
... somebody shouts: ''Hey, Charly!''... and all the people are turning to see who shouted.
No. they definitely heard something... but by no means ''Hey. Charly!''.
Max! Go on!
- Here Sanlo is hustled, but he is still filming.
Now playback again the same part.
But when l tell you to slow down. ..
... play it frame by frame.
Slow!
Stop!
Those from below were looking at him
There is no doubt. increase the image We must find these people. it won't be easy.
Max, Charly. you have a green light.
We will go to see the 2nd floor of the building. it's a nice office... but unoccupied for over an year. unfortunately.
The phone isn't working. sir
You can make a call from the hallway.
Do you want to rent this office, right?
No, not exactly.
Tell me. this office belonged to a company.. . named Transcontinental import-Export?
Yes. But they just vanished.
But, since they paid for 8 months in advance, the owner wasn't so angry.
But l think l know what happened.
We are in the building that the president was shot from, did you know? No.
The Transcontinental people were some stylish guys... that wanted to drift away from this building.
The best proof is their scuttle.
What makes you believe that they were ''stylish guys''?
Before they disappeared they gave me an envelope.. .
... with a very beautiful gift inside.
I'll leave it to your imagination.
Hold on! Here.
No, you don't have to
Thank you! l will leave you the key, you can return it to the janitor.
I've called the Chamber of Commerce...
Transcontinental import Export does not exist. it's a shadow company.
As well as this office, that was rented... only for hiding the second sniper.
And two snipers already means an organization...
So one of the snipers was Daslow. up on the terrace... and the other one here, on the 2nd floor.
But the 9 witnesses don't turn their backs towards the terrace...
... but here. towards the 2nd floor...
... because the shots were heard from here.
Strange though, isn't it?
There is nothing about the 9 witnesses in the report... but instead, a certain Niki Farnnese, who was in the crowd... shouted pointing to the window were Daslow was... l quote ''Up there! l saw him shooting! l saw him!''
Thank you for coming, Mr. Farnese.
Your colleagues told men that it will only take a few minutes...
My wife takes care of our shop in the meantime.
We will try not to misuse your time.
The day of the assassination...
. .. you saw a person shooting...
... from this building's terrace? l saw it perfectly.
Where were you at that moment? l came here early that morning. l was right here.
Right beside this red curbstone.
Are you sure?
- absolutely! l was sitting like this, you see?
A policeman even told me not to sit on the curbstone. it seemed stupid to me because l was alone.
So l stayed. and from this place l saw it all happening.
Can you give me your glasses, please?
Thank you.
Tell me, please. what are you seeing on that board? it's blurry
I'm short-sighted.
But that day, when you shouted
''Up there! l saw him shooting!''...
... that day you were wearing the glasses?
Of course. l wear them all the time.
This photo was made that day. it's you there. right?
Yes it's me.
Only that you didn't have the glasses on.
- I d don't have them anymore The place was crowded
Someone pushed me.. and the glasses fell and they broke. l had to buy another pair... l can give you a copy of the invoice. if you want.
But when l saw the assassin... l was still wearing the glasses, that I'm sure of.
Now you see the terrace?
Of course
- No, no. keep looking it!
Mr. Farnese, this television vehicle was exactly in this place.
So what? l only said that l saw up on the terrace a man with a rifle...
... and when the police came... they found someone with a rifle up there.
That proves that l didn't make up anything.
So?
- Nothing, Mr. Farnese.
You can go back to your wife and your commerce. l am Pierre Gregory, sir...
.. . and this is Stan. our sniper.
You were the one who retrieved
Daslow's rifle and shells?
Yes, sir. They were like this.
These 3 marks are indicators of the shells' position? absolutely, sir.
One of my colleagues took pictures of the scene before my arrival. l brought them.
OK.
Good. Let's start.
We are ready.
We blocked everything on a 0. 6 miles radius it's all ready. Over.
Gregory, your shells are not as disciplined...
... as Daslow's ones.
Again, please.
How do you explain this mystery?
3 shells almost perfectly lined up and grouped. l think it's more than a mystery, sir it's a true miracle.
Thank you
That's all for today.
Did you find something about the witnesses? we've almost completed the records.
Robert Kosheba. Marianne Delilah...
... Charles Polodl, Gulllaume emends...
... Nicolas Rosenko. Ramon Jimenez...
... Ursula Hoffmann, Serge Levis... and an unknown
-Well done!
- The truth is that we had more buck than we deserved.
Almost all of them came to testify on their own accord.. . and were heard by the Heiniger commission. l did not read such testimonies in the Heiniger report... I'm surprised...
Page 1 98 of the report...
''The commission discarded the testimonies... that were proved too imaginative, futile or preconceived''.
This is the reason therefore you did not read their statements.
All of them came forward...
... except two of them:
Nicolas Rosenko, journalist...
... that was working for a tabloid.
We found this on the first page of his magazine... not as an author. but as a subject.
Hello? l am speaking as representative of the PLO.
Palestine Liberation Organization.
About?
Listen carefully, l won't repeat
We will execute your journalist...
... Nicolas Rosenko... because he is a propaganda agent paid by Israel.
You will find his body in your underground parking, sector 6.
One hour later.
PLO was denying its involvement
... in Rosenko's killing.
The police closed the file.
That's why Rosenko did not come in front of the commission. l think he did not testify... because he preferred to work on his own.
He was passionate about the Daslow case. l found this under the backseat of his car.
''Daslow's autopsy was never made
Why?''
''Daslow kills himself with a gun
To whom did the gun belong?''
''The route of the official convoy was disclosed...
... only in the last minute.
-How come Daslowh knew it?''
He's right.
''They already know each other
Who?''
Rosenko tore off these pages because they were very important to him.
Give me your copy...
Pages 147 and 148.
Good...
Karl together with an
Italian friend, Luigi Lacosta.
Try to find out something about this Lacosta.
Let's continue.
Ursula Hoffmann. ..
Recently arrived from Hamburg's seedy harbors.. .
... she's the sensuality itself...
... she is the dream and the love.. . in a hallucinating nude show...
... Ursula Hoffmann!''
Ursula! What are you doing there. for Christ's sake?
According the inquiry', it seems...
... we have a sentimental suicide here.
Ramon Jimenez. 33 years. artist...
- Precise as always, at 9.00 the garage keeper...
... takes out a client's car. in front of the garage a man offers a light to a pedestrian.
The pedestrian is Ramon Jimenez.
Suddenly he seems to feel badly...
... and he falls on the sidewalk.
An ambulance stops and picks up the patient. it was 9:05.
Ramon Jimenez was still alive...
At 10:30, accordingly to the medical registry book,
... the ambulance arrives at the hospital... bringing to the emergency room a dead person.
''Heart attack'', the doctors concluded.
No autopsy was made.
There are dead people as a result of a heart attack. aren't they?
Yes but here we have a delay... an enormous delay of one hour and a quarter.
Even in the case of a traffic jam, the trip from that garage... to the hospital won't last more than 1 5 min.
15 minutes.
But the  makes it in almost one hour and a half.
- How did thee ambulance crew explain this delay?
They had no explanation.
The ambulance belonged to a small company... which was immediately taken over by a bigger one.
Of course they ''lost'' the personnel book to cover up everything.
Marianne Delilah...
Guillaume Gemenos...
Charles Polodi...
... three traffic accidents.
Marianne Delilah was an exceptional biker...
A truck hit him without stopping.
And the other two?
Almost identical cases. both Gemenos and Polodi...
... lost control over their vehicles.
The real accident causes were ignored in all the 3 cases.
Serge Levis, 23 years. single...
... was a model...
... you have his file here.
Gone without a trace just before he signed a few contracts.
Found dead 2 months later. in a motel.
Robert Kosheba, 28 years, electronics engineer...
- On 22nd of September. he had a drink in Manhattan bar... when the narcotic brigade alighted for a routine control.
''Police! Nobody moves!''
''Hands up!''
The policeman that killed Kosheba claimed self defense.
- He was suspended from duty some time after.
Robert Kosheba did not carry any guns.
And him?
Died from amputee fever. l suppose.
No sir, nobody talked to him.
He hasn't appeared up till now
He is staying anonymous.
We don't know who is this person or where is it.
We made some photos from that tape.
''l am addressing to this citizen and to all that know him''.
''Please contact immediately the General Attorney's office''.
''Att. Volney, tel. 344. 344. 33"
''This number is available night and day''.
''l repeat: 344. 344. 33.. . ''
''Sir, if this photo is yours... l urge you to call us as fast as you can. not only because... you were the witness of a highly important events...
... but mostly because your life... and the lives of your beloved ones are in great danger. ''
''This was a message from Attorney
Henri Volney''...
''a message that will be broadcasted through out this evening''.
Call them. Frank
You must tell them everything.
Jeanne! Don't start again!
Don't you understand that this is the last mistake l could do? it all must be forgotten. lf you don't call, someone will identify you finally.
The kid from the butchery... your office colleagues
-Well? l didn't note the phone number.
Yes. I'm listening.
''it was Robert Mitchum in
Young. Billy, Young''.
''Did l won?''
No, Mrs. it wasn't him and we do not offer any prize.
''This is not a TV contest?''
- No. ma'am.
Volnney's office,
I'm listening.
- 'l know the one whose photo you broadcasted''.
''His name is Frank Bellony. "
''We were good friends''.
Why are you saying ''we were''?
''Because we ran into some problems... due to our wives they could not stand each other''.
Do you have his address?
''l think he moved out. we haven't met lately... ''
Hello? l'm Frank Bellony l would like to speak to General. Att. Volney.
I'm his assistant
Please don't hang up!
Yes?
General Att. Volney?
I'm the one that you are looking for. l called because you're wasting your time. it's pointless to keep broadcast my photo on TV. l don't have any information about this case. l didn't see or hear anything
And l don't want to meet you.
You are right to be afraid. sir... it's possible that you don't know this but, there are 8 more persons like you... that saw something suspicious on the day of the assassination
Glad to hear that
So talk to them. it would be very difficult, because... these 8 people are dead now
And not from natural causes. lf you don't trust me. .. you will be the ninth
Not witness. but body. obviously.
You are a jerk.
You must choose between the jerk and the killer, sir.
All right l live inn
- No! Don't tell me your address! is there a pay phone near you?
Perfect. Call me from there.
'We will trace thee call...
... and we will come after you.
What , I'm listening.
I'm calling from a pay phone.
- ''Don't hang up.
We are tracing them call''...
''and we will come after you
We will arrive in a white car''.
''Don't hang up and don't forget to insert coins''. l see a car... it's not as you told me. it's black... Hello?
''We traced the phone booth
We're coming.
The Bellony's are here, sir.
I'm coming.
Good evening, Mr. Bellony.
Good evening. lady.
Our assistant will take care of you.
You can rest in the next room.
All but me are?...
Yes. they're all dead.
Come with me, please.
As soon as you have the list bring it to us.
Please concentrate and look at the pictures.
- l have too identify the shooter in these photos, right?
Exactly.
All those who will appear were chosen considering their past.
Are you comfortable?
- Max. please.
No. it's not him. he was way younger.
No. it wasn't blond, that's for sure.
Good evening, Mr. De Palma.
We are alone?
- l was told this here. .. you must make a reservation
24 hours in advance.
Mr. Lacosta, it's 3 AM... and this restaurant remained open especially for us. l don't think we can complain about the discretion here.
Sit down please
A bit of vodka?
Which one you prefer?
Polish. lemon. Russian?
Your choice
- Let be Russian. then.
Did you watch Volney's broadcasted appeal?
Yes, by chance.
The appeal wasn't broadcasted anymore since 9 PM... probably because Volney found what he looked for.
This ninth witness that you let escape.
Caucasian shashlyk.
Mr. De Palma, l accomplished my part of the contract...
- We are very pleased with you
Mr. Lacosta.
- Perfect.
Our contract stipulated though...
... two commitments from you.
- The first one: the salary. accomplished.
- The second one: m safety and my return to my country.
For your safety we eliminated...
... 8 inconvenient witnesses.
But do you think it's the time to go back in your country?
A few hours from now it will be maybe too late, Mr. De Palma.
Right at this moment there is a man in this city...
... a man who saw me...
... and who will talk.
No At least the one l saw at the 2nd floor. .. does not seems like anyone in these photos.
I'm sorry, but l can't lie to you.
We appreciate it.
Anyway. l would like to see again one of those photos.
Sure. its among the last fie ones.
Before this one. l guess.
No, it's not him.
This one! it's him!
This is the guy from the second floor?
- No, this is thee man 'with thee umbrella.
Now I'm sure, it's him.
He was 1 yard behind me, down in the crowd. l was with the other ones, on the catwalk. l didn't notice him in the first place... but he opened his umbrella a blink of an eye...
... before the shootings.
With all that sun then, l assumed he is crazy.
Excuse me, l don't think this has something to do with your case.. . but it was strange to see him among those in the photos.
I'm sorry
- No problem, thank you. Mr. Bellony.
For your safety and your family's. .. you must take a forced vacation. l took care of everything.
Here you have them travel cherubs.
This young man will escort you to a private jet. it looks like you'll have very good weather in the Caribbean. l will take you back to your family now.
General Att . what have l done to deserve all this?
Nothing, Mr. Bellony
You just watched something...
... that you weren't supposed to.
Have a good trip!
De Palma. Carlos
Originally from Honduras.
Refugee for political reasons at age 23. suspected for a long time to be one of the... leaders of a criminal organization.
Each time that he was indicted he claimed he was discriminated... and won Sentenced for
5 years for financial fraud...
... he was released in less than 2 years.
Put his phone under surveillance.
You don't want to arrest him?
No. Under what circumstances?
For wearing an umbrella?
- lf I'l be exposed due to this witness...
... you will be exposed too.
This means you will talk? l have certain dreams...
. .. and now l also got the money... as well as the age to make them come true.
You're right
We must respect our dreams.
They separate us from reality's commonplaces...
... and send us to that invisible world... where we can make our wishes come true.
No, no, I'm 'welting.
An extremely rainy day?
No, I'm not interested in the wind direction.
No clear sky?
Thank you very much. it's something l don't get.
Daslow goes up the terrace with a rifle to shoot the president... but now we know that the rifle was not loaded.
- Why would one go up with an unloaded rifle?
Someone replaced it in the last minute.
The picture is taken in front of his own house...
... having the rifle in his hand...
... on 28th March 1977. l called the local weather agency.
On 28th March 1977 it was heavily raining...
.. . but in this photo it's sunshine.
Maybe it was taken before, or after the rain stopped...
Before or after the rain...
Hydrangeas do not bloom in March...
... but only at the end of July. Charly. it's a fake photo.
They ''put'' Daslow's head on it it's obvious.
So we have a fake image of Daslow?
Everything is fake in this case. Everything!
A fake witness, a fake sniper. fake shells... fake hydrangeas and a fake report!
With fake conclusions.
682 pages of conclusions... that do not contain even the slightest answer to the most elementary question:
WHY? Why was Daslow on that terrace although he had no reason too?
The psychiatric report specifies a case of paranoia.
Of course! lf we didn't find a reason...
... we concluded he's insane!
Only that insane people find reasons on their own:
... either God lead them... or they had to save the world from a catastrophe.. . and they are telling that to themselves
These psychoses can be detected.
But about Daslow we don't have a thing. absolutely nothing.
Neither  school, nor from the army... neither from his employers. nor from his daily life.
We can't get any trace of psychical illness.
Nevertheless, on May 22nd. .. at 13:01 he shoots the president...
... and at 13:02 he commits suicide.
Well, no. gentlemen!
An insane assassin never kills himself!
He wants to show everybody his vision!
There are statistics about this.
The psychiatric report is based on a scientific experiment. .. directed by professor David Negara from Laye University.
Perfect! Let's call him! it's 4 AM, sir.. .
What day are we?
Sunday morning, sir.
Oh, well Go to sleep
I'll see you Monday morning.
''The undersigned psychological experts... not using the examination due to subject's absence.. .
... have elaborated in this report...
... on basis of K. E. Daslow's past.
His inclination to violence... which lead him to this cruel and irresponsible gesture... can be explained through what we call...
... paranoid dementia''.
Prof Negara, do you remember this man?
Yes, unfortunately he's famous... it is Daslow, right?
- Yes.
He participated in one of our experiments.
Did you read the psychiatric conclusions of Heiniger's report? l must admit l didn't.
Professor, during the tests you run here.. . could you diagnose a man with a mental disease?
- in your opinion Daslw was acting like a paranoid
Excuse me.
I'll be back.
A paranoid? l propose you to see one of our experiments.
The behavior of today's subject might help you understand...
Daslow's better
-Very well!
Have a sit.
Through this special glass you can see without being seen.
You have a volume meter to hear what they discuss down there.
I'll be right back.
Will it take long?
About an hour, l was told.
What are we going to do?
We will explain right away.
Here is proof. Neggara.
Mr. Rivoli?
No... Despaul.
Then you must be Mr. Rivoli. right?
Yes, professor.
Gentlemen. a few words about the experiment that we will conduct here today...
A psychological theory says... that an individual learns more correctly and efficiently... if he's conscious that every mistake will attract a punishment.
An example of this theory in everyday life would be... the punishment that parents enforce over their children.. .
. .. when they are making mistakes.
- They hope the punishment 'will help the children remember what is right.
At this university we are interested only with adults.
We will measure scientifically, step by step... the influence of the punishment over the memory.
One of you will be the student, which will be forced to remember... the other one will be the instructor, which...
.. . by progressive punishments... will force the pupil to use his memory more efficiently.
We will draw lots to see which one will be the instructor and which one the student. l am the instructor.
Then Mr. Rivoli will be the student.
Do l have to sit here?
- Please. it's not dangerous?
What is this?
A solution to avoid the eventual burns.
Ok...
The principle is very simple:
Here's a list with 30 words... each one associated with an adjective.
Sky blue. animal fierce, wind - violent, etc.
You're going to read to Mr. Rivoli these 30 pairs of words.
After that you're goanna read to him only the adjective...
... and he must tell from memory... to which word that adjective corresponds.
- l got lt. So 'when I'll read them rod ''blue''... he will have to answer ''sky''.. .
... ''animal'' for ''fierce''...
''wind'' for ''violent''.
You perfectly understood.
Each time when Mr. Rivoli is wrong...
... you will inflict a punishment.
You will draw one of these sliders...
... and he will get an electric shock.
At the first mistake he will get 1 5 volts.. .
30 volts for the second one mistake.
45 for the third, etc, etc.
The sliders act incrementally. each 15V...
... so the shocks add up.
Now please read the associations to your student. .. slowly, articulating well, so that he can remember them.
Mr. Flavius will control the experiment.
So... sky - blue.
. .. animal - fierce, wind - violent...
.. . day - chilly...
... lemon - yellow...
.. . fish - grilled...
. .. egg - strong...
How do you enlist your candidates?
Through an ad published in the local newspaper.
''Do you want to make 6 dollars?
... giving us only 1 hour from your time''.
''We are recruiting volunteers for a scientific experiment about ''.
What role did Daslow play? instructor or student? it was the same spot as Mr. Despaul's.
... well - deep...
... bread - buttered. ..
... money - satisfied.
OK.
Please begin. Mr. Despaul.
The first word: blue.
Sky! Blue sky!
Correct
- Next word: fierce.
Laugh Fierce laugh!
No, wrong
The answer was ''animal''.
15 volts.
Next word: violent.
Just a second l know
- Blow! Violent blow!
- wrong. The answer 'was ''wind'.
Violent wind.
30 volts.
Think before you answer. l don't like sending these electrical shocks!
Next word: chilly.
Chilly, chilly isn't it ''fish'' by any chance?
Do you believe sincerely that these electric shocks...
... will enhance Mr. Rivoli's memory?
-It's not Mr. Rivoli's memory that we're interested in here.
What we're interested in is...
... it's Mr. Despaul's capacity to obey.
His ''submission to authority''.
For Mr. Despaul the authority is this university...
... Prof. Flavius, myself. .. and our white overalls. which symbolize this authority.
We will force him to punish a victim...
... that did him nothing wrong.
How far will he go to obey our absurd and outrageous orders? in this where the whole problem lies.
Next word: yellow.
Lemon
- Very good! it was lemon!
Let's carry on
Next word: grilled.
Bread... Grilled bread.
- No, wrong! it was ''fish'' - grilled fish!
165 volts.
Stop! l refuse to continue
Please let me go.
Are you telling men that he must continue all the way until 450 volts? l don't know...
From a certain moment on, it's obvious.. .
... that Mr. Despaul will have to face a problem.
On one side the submission to authority... carrying out the mission he was assigned, on the other side the horror of making his victim suffer
Soon, Despaul will be torn apart by an almost unbearable internal conflict.
To pull himself out of this situation...
... he must disobey the authority.
We are studying the very structure of this conflict.
Continue. Mr. Despaul.
Next word
- One moment!
Mr. Rivoli's right hand is untied.
The electrode has no contact anymore
You must tie his hand again. l am the one who has to do this?
We must run this experiment correctly.
A very interesting phase: the physical contact.
Until now he acted vicariously, through the use of the cursors.
But now he must touch a man... that he is torturing, although that man did him no harm. in this phase the duty of obedience usually diminishes. l beg you, slur Stop.
Why don't you focus?
Do not answer randomly!
Let's get this over and done with.
He asked me to stop
What do you think?
Please continue, Mr. Despau. focus before answering...
... because we are nearly at 200 volts here.
The next word is ''white''.
White!
Look! Despaul tries to decrease his inner conflict...
... by helping his victim. lf this conflict is so intense why doesn't he stop?
- lf he stops now, he would admit to himself that  shout don't have gone this far inn the first place
By continuing he justifies to himself everything he has done so far.
Can we, at least this time. pass over to the next word? it is crucial to continue the experiment. Mr. Despaul.
But he doesn't answer anymore...
What should we do now?
We must continue, even though the student doesn't like it.
He has to learn all the words
Do you hear me, sir?
The word is ''white''.
-Can't take it anymore... It hurts so bad...
I can't answer anymore...
What are we doing?
Consider the answer as wrong and send him 1 80 volts.
This is not good at all, we're risking a lot here! l take all the responsibility. lf you take full responsibility... it's unbearable!
You don't have the right to do this. even in the name of science.
Stay calm, General Att.
The devices are all fake.
There is no electrical power...
... between the desk and the chair.
But Mr. Despaul doesn't know that.
Mr. Rivoli is very talented. isn't he?
He's part of our team.
Of course, it's essential for all our candidates to be instructors. it's horrendous...
General Att...
... you reacted at 180 volts!
Your experiment is merciless, professor...
What's the voltage Daslow stopped at?
405 volts.
Sit down.
Focus well!
Otherwise l must send you 405 volts.
Make an effort!
''Ecossaise''?
405 volts!
- We must stop the experiment! impossible. we can't fake the results
We must continue.
The subject's heart won't stand it is obvious. lf we don't stop it could be a disaster.
Apply 405 volts, Mr. Daslow!
No way!
First, you two must agree about this!
My discussion with Prof Neggara does not concern you. Mr. Daslow.
Continue.
No way! lf you want, l will give you back the 6 dollars!
The experiment stops here. at 405 volts.
As soon as the coherence of the hierarchical system disappears... and the disagreements appear at the authority level... the subject takes advantage of it and refuses to obey.
- Did you had many subjects that went to 405 volts?
On average. 63% of the subjects are submissive.
. .. fully accepting the experiment.
And the go to 450 volts
- This means that in a civilized, democratic and liberal country...
2/3 of the people are capable of executing any kind of commandment...
... that comes from a superior authority...
3 months after the experiment we summon every subject... to tell him the truth and ask him to justify its own behavior.
Listen to Daslow's reactions.
Mr. Daslow, you participated
3 months ago in an experiment.. . inn which you applied electrical discharges up to 405 volts to someone.
Did you believe at the time that the electrical shocks were real?
Y yes.
Did you ever think about your cruelty inflicted on your innocent...
... and defenseless victim ? l didn't think of my cruelty...
... nor of the innocence of the victim.
You had at that moment an authority that should do it. l did what l was told to.
When they demand a pilot to launch a bomb...
... over a city, the pilot launches it.
- He doesn't question himself whether it is right or wrong, he just haunches it.
But in the situation of a genocide, when a tyrant decides to kill 5-6 mil. people... he needs to have
1 mil. accomplices, murderers...
How is he gaining the obedience of others?
By dividing the responsibilities.
A tyrant needs a tyrant state, so he will recruit 1 mil. smaller tyrants...
... every single one of them executing their tasks professionally and without remorse... because nobody will ever remember which is the millionth part of the crime.
One of them will arrest the victims there are just simple imprisonments.. .
Other ones will take the victim into camps. but they are only train drivers...
The victims will be imprisoned by the one but he's only the prison warden.
The most violent ones will be used for the very final act. but... overall this chain of obedience will seem comfortable to everyone involved.
Mr. Daslow, at 360V the subject ceased to scream and did not respond. .. which could lead you to assume he's dead.
Why did you continue to apply him shocks from 360V to 405V? lf he is really dead he would feel nothing. right? l thought the professors knew what they are doing. l was not the one to contradict them.
- What surprises me is that all the subjects react without anger, without rage... without vindictiveness, without at least hoping for a reward.
You aren't suggesting that Daslow did all that for those 6 dollars? lf the advertisement wasn't published by a university... but by an individual that would promise you several hundred dollars as a reward... would you have still applied those 405V to Mr. Rivoli?
No.
What if the reward would be of 1 0.000 dollars? l don't think you understood, sir.
Money has got nothing to do with this. l will obey an authority as long as l respect it.
That's all.
Thank you.
So, that day. going up to the terrace to shoot over president...
Daslow was obeying an ''authority that he respected''...
... regardless of any amount of money.
But the same authority has already hired the real assassins. those from below. .. assassins that were working only for money.
Niki Farnese - the fake witness. ..
Carlos De Palma the man with the umbrella...
... and the assassin from the 2nd floor.
- l think the assassin is
Luigi Lacosta, sir...
We retrieved his car, and he was shot right in his face.
The Interpol told us that Lacosta was known as a professional killer.
But why wasn't his picture among those shown to Bellony?
Lacosta wasn't yet filed by the police at that time.
He arrived from Italy on March 1 0th...
2 months before the president's assassination.
- Their accounts revealed that Nicky Farnese reeled...
5 000 dollars before the murder and the same amount after.
- Luigi Lacosta cashed two cherubs oaf
250.000 dollars.
So who is that authority... respected by one and financer to the others?
Daslow and Lacosta can't speak anymore.
Carlos De Palma? is under surveillance?
Night and day
His calls are permanently monitored.
What does his parole file say?
He was released with the intervention of
Mr. Richard Mallory... chief of Special Activities Bureau within Secret Services.
What motive did he invoke?
''High services for the country''.
He was released on
February 12 1977.
3 months before president Jary's assassination.
This evening De Palma dines with his benefactor - Mallory.
Good job, Bob! l found that in the phone tapping report. sir.
Where will they have the dinner?
Mallory is going to De Palma's place.
So. with a bit of luck, there will be no one this evening at Mallory's.
This meaning... ?
Don't fool around. Charly. ok?
- I'll block the elevators door.
- why?
Because it's the best way to go back down in a hurry.
Do you know what problems will we face there? l don't.
Usually these actions are planned.
Do you know it's possible that he has an alarm system?
You open and. .. driving!
What is he doing? lf problems develop we must not be involved.
Charly is upstairs?
Yes, sir
- Alone?
No. with a first class burglar.
Garcia Santos.
Which we found at the Homicide dept.
That's getting better and better
Garcia Santos...
Four charges for robbery...
Three. sir lf all goes ok we promised him we'll wipe out the fourth.
Don't touch anything!
Put these before. l Can't believe this if I'd work on my own l would be convicted for 3 years... l do this for you. guys. and you're wiping out 3 years!
Hallo, Vermont!
We are in - it's alright.
Shit. it's Mallory!
Stay calm.
Excuse me. Mr. Mallory.
I'm Henri Volney.
Glad to know you, General Att
- l hope you are not waiting for me.
Oh yes.
I'm not aware of being guilty
Shall we go upstairs to have a drink? l prefer to walk outside, if that doesn't bother you. l hear all over that the members of the Secret Services... have their homes full of microphones and other sort of things.
That's an exaggeration.
Do you know a certain Carlos De Palma?
Carlos De Palma yes, yes
Sentenced to 5 years... for some tax problems. if l recall.
Exactly Did you interfered in his release? l interfered in few cases, on behalf of Secret Services...
... but never on my own behalf.
The motive in De Palma's case was. as l remember, ''services for the nation''. l hope I'm not too intrusive if l ask you what kind of services.
We are called ''Secret Services'' because we can keep a secret
- in our job the first rule is the one  silence.
This rule applies to organizations also - such as the Mafia. l don't understand. it was a joke, Mr. Mallory. a simple joke.
Have you found what you're looking for?
No, l  don't know what I'm looking for.
Perfect...
This does not change our agreement. right?
Those 3 years will be wiped out. isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Why don't you look into the safe?
What safe?
There. behind that copy.
How did you figure is a safe there? l can smell the camouflage.
- Y you see this trace here?
And here?
-These traces are left by the hands that are moving the painting so often.
Can you open it?
For this amateur job there are 2 methods:
... the delicate one... and the brutal one.
Let's try first the delicate one.
Obviously.
You dislike the Secret Services.
Mr. Volney, right?
You're wrong, l consider them absolutely necessary.
Without our information. no nation can guarantee...
... the security of its people.
- absolutely, but, sometimes, the soldiers of information... are bearing away from their mission and turn themselves into an intervention army. .. which infiltrates all over and escapes from the control of those who create it. in such organizations errors could appear anytime.
Errors? The Secret Service's budget is 1 0 bill. for intelligence dept. ..
... and 200 bill. for the interventions dept... and 200  means a whole institution. Mr. Mallory.
So far with the delicate one.
What's going on?
Almost all people keep using the same combination... which. when accessed repeatedly. leads to a wear of the mechanism... and this one sounds differently on the used number.
Not so distinctively, but it can be traced. in our case the wear is so small. they are probably changing the combination every day.
Let's try the brutal one then.
Stay calm, General Att. the Secret Services are under the direct control... of both the presidency and the government.
- its true, the presldeent's and the goeernmment's control... this highly effective and discreet instrument... and they're using it too often enough sometimes. .. but when this instrummennt can't be controlled anymore... it becommes very difficult for them to denounce their former accomplices.
The only one who stood up against this inner state...
... was president Jary.
Why don't you turn the mnusic on?
- This is not the time for this. l warn you that the explosion noise will be very loud. it's better to drown the noise.
Look for something orchestral, it mmakes a lot of noise.
''Charly, he w dgco up for sure now! Get out of there''!
Thank you.
My pleasure, Mr. Volney
- Mine too. Mr. Mallory.
And don't let yourself be influenced by those novelists... that are always writing stories with an espionage theme.
Even they start every story by saying all the characters and facts are fictitious.
When the source of imagination is not reality. this isn't good.
There is no suspense without reality, Mr. Mallory.
Good night. General Att. l think we obtained what we wanted, sir.
Why? why is this tape so special?? it contains music fragmented by messages that can not be decoded. it must be played at a certain frequency and speed in order to become clear.
How did you get this?
A lot of noise for nothing. sir
Mallory deliberately switched up things.
- He followed the ground rule: don't hide it, keep it in plain sight.
Do you want to decode it?
No. thanks
Go and get some sleep.

President JARY WAS Assassinated.
Hello? Government Palace?
Yes, sir. l would like to speak with the President
General Att. Henri Volney speaking.
Sir, the president is in Geneva at the summit...
... it was published in all the newspapers.
Of course, thank you.
Extraordinary assembly of Minos.
Minos adopt unanimously the triggering of the operation... l... AS  ICARUS
... the operation l... AS  ICARUS... must be accomplished on June 17th.. .
... until midnight. l want to speak to
Secret Services chief. please.
Who's asking?
General Att Henri Volney it is extremely important.
Hold on.
Hugues Adler? Henri Volney.
Excuse me for disturbing you but l need to see you right away. lf it's a personal matter, gladly... but as a chief of Secret Services
I'm afraid it's too late... l no longer hold this position since yesterday.
Who was appointed in your place?
- The chief oaf the Special Activities Bureau, a certain Mallory...
Richard Mallory???
- Yes... Do you know him?
Not so well.
I'm beside you in these moments and forgive me for waking you up.
Good bye
- Good bye.
Mr. President, l address to you this personal and confidential message...
... because thee conclusions l reached... are way beyond the limits imposed on my inquiry. .. and they concern directly the security of the nation.
One: l can prove... that the assassination of the president Marc Jary...
... was a careful and elaborate plot... by a military group apparently not linked to the government.
This plot was organized... in the name of so called
''superior interests of our nation''... the nation being only an excuse, unfortunately.
The leaders of this plot... did not want only to replace one regime with another... but they do know very well the State structures and they're using them.
- Two: l accuse the Secret Selves, and especially a faction of these services... to be at the disposal of this ''supreme brain''.
Three l accuse them also for working with a renowned international crime organization
Four: l accuse Mr. Mallory for being the main intermediate between... the main leader of the conspiracy and certain executive levels of this one.
Five: as a part of this conspiracy, an operation whose code name is.. .
... l... AS  ICARUS was already triggered and should be carried out...
... today, June 1 7 th. before midnight.
How could we possibly know where this operation will take place?
With consideration, Mr. President,
Henri Volney.
Hello, Helene?
- Yes, Henri.
- Did l make you up?
Nobody else could call me at this hour, my darling. ..
How was the première?
Boring they did not talk much about my book...
.. . instead we spoke a lot about you.
The women came to the conclusion that you're a misogynist. hand what did you answer?
Should l have answered them?
Yes. you should tell them that I'm busy with a woman so hard to find... which in fact keeps me away from women you can find anywhere.
You're so nice this morning...
How's your inquiry?
Difficult. my dear, difficult... l never felt so lonely...
And there's nothing l can do for you?
No. .. Yes!
What meaning has for you the name lcarus? l. C. A. R. U. S.
Besides of the mythological sense known by all, of course... lcarus
- Yes.
My dear attorney. it shows that you haven't read my book. l speak in there of the lcarus myth. let me find the paragraph...
No. l can find it on my own. .. l found it. .. page 198...
- lcarus was locked Minos in a labyrinth... from which he escaped using the wings he made by itself.
Using bird feathers and wax to glue the wings he managed to escape...
... but, in its flight he got too close to the sun... that the wax melted. and he fell into the sea.
- All these myths are part of thee folklore. lf we consider the sun...
. .. as the symbol of truth...
... then lcarus paid with its life...
... for being so close to the truth.
This interpretation can help you?
Hello... Hello...
Hello!
Hello!
The experiments regarding
''obedience to authority''... took place between 1960-1963 at Yale University in New-Haven... and they were run by professor Stanley Milgram.
What we see...
and what we seem...
are but a dream...
a dream within a dream.
"Meet me, love, when day is ending."
"I love thee for thy highborn grace, thy deep and lustrous eyes, for the sweet meaning of thy brow and for thy bearing so high."
Six... and seven... and eight... and nine... and ten... and 11.
"I love thee not because thou art fair, softer than down, smoother than air, nor for the cupids that do lie in either corner of thine eye.
Wouldst thou then know what it might be?
'Tis I love thee 'cause thou lovest me."
See the little horse
My little horse
Trotting down the paddock
On his fine white feet
Black horse, white horse
Brown horse, grey
Trotting down the paddock
On a bright, sunny day
Someday, Sara, you shall have to come home with me to the station, to Queensland, and meet my sweet, funny family for yourself.
Would you like that?
You must learn to love someone else apart from me, Sara.
I won't be here much longer.
What do you think, Miranda?
Somebody had the nerve to send Miss McCraw a card on squared paper covered with tiny sums.
Girls! Girls!
Unless you all deport yourselves with rather more grace and considerably less noise,
Mrs. Appleyard will see to it that none of you go to Hanging Rock today.
Bonjour, Miss Lumley.
Good morning,
Mademoiselle de Poitiers.
I believe Mrs. Appleyard has decided you're not to go on the picnic, Sara.
That makes two of us.
Off you go!
To St. Valentine!
Frere Jacques
Frere Jacques
Dormez vous...
Tais-toi, Irma.
Miss McCraw vient d'arriver.
She wants algebra today.
Today?
Good morning, girls.
Good morning, Mrs. Appleyard.
Well, young ladies, we are indeed fortunate in the weather for our picnic to Hanging Rock.
I have instructed Mademoiselle that as the day is likely to be warm, you may remove your gloves once the drag has passed through Woodend.
You will partake of luncheon at the picnic grounds near the rock.
Once again let me remind you that the rock itself is extremely dangerous, and you are therefore forbidden any tomboy foolishness in the matter of exploration, even on the lower slopes.
I also wish to remind you, the vicinity is renowned for its venomous snakes and poisonous ants of various species.
It is, however, a geological marvel on which you will be required to write a brief essay on Monday morning.
That is all.
Have a pleasant day, and try to behave yourselves in a manner to bring credit to the college.
Mr. Hussey! Mr. Hussey!
I shall expect you back,
Miss McCraw and Mademoiselle, at about 8:00 for a light supper.
Come, girls.
Whoa!
This we do for pleasure, so that we may shortly be at the mercy of venomous snakes and poisonous ants.
How foolish can human creatures be?
There she is, ladies.
Hangin' Rock.
The mountain comes to Mohammed.
A hanging rock comes to Mr. Hussey.
More than 500 feet high she is.
Volcanic, of course.
Thousands of years old.
A million years old, Mr. Hussey, or thereabouts.
Yes, well, that'd be right.
Thousands, millions.
Devil of a long time, anyway, in a manner of speakin'.
Only a million years ago.
Quite a recent eruption, really.
The rocks all around Mount Macedon itself must be all of 350 million years old.
Siliceous lava forced up from deep down below.
Soda trachytes extruded in a highly viscous state, building the steep-sided mountains we see in Hanging Rock.
And quite young, geologically speaking.
Barely a million years.
Waiting a million years just for us.
More cake, Michael?
No, thank you, Aunt. 
I'm...
I think I'll just, um, stretch my legs a bit.
Oh, don't go too far and be careful.
There could be snakes.
How's it goin'?
All right.
They finished eating, have they?
Eh?
The colonel and the missus... they finished eating, have they?
Oh, yes, they have.
Expect me up there in a minute, I suppose.
Clear away.
Can't be more'n midday.
No.
I thought it was a little early for lunch myself.
Yes.
Drink?
Thank you.
You know, they always allow an hour longer than it takes to get 'ere, and then they got 'ere straight away.
Thanks.
Ah.
Not that they got anything else to do.
I mean, they never go for a walk or nothin'.
Get on!
Come on!
Take your hats.
Let's go walk about now.
To St. Valentine!
To St. Valentine!
I hope you have learned your poetry, Sara.
Sit up straight, child.
Hold your shoulders back.
You're getting a dreadful stoop.
Well, have you got your lines by heart?
Well, have you?
I can't.
It doesn't make sense.
Sense!
You little ignoramus!
Evidently you don't know that Mrs. Felicia Heymans is considered one of the finest of our English poets.
I know another piece of poetry by heart.
It has ever so many verses, much more than "The Wreck of the Hesperus."
Would that do?
What is the name of this poem?
"An Ode to St. Valentine."
I'm not acquainted with it.
Where did you find it?
I didn't find it.
I wrote it.
You wrote it?
"Love abounds, love surrounds..."
Oh, no thank you, Sara.
Strange as it may seem,
I still prefer Mrs. Heymans.
Give me your book and proceed to recite to me as far as you have gone.
Your book, please, Sara.
Thank you.
Go on.
I can't.
Not one line?
I shall leave you now, Sara.
I expect you to be word perfect when I send Miss Lumley in in half an hour.
Otherwise, I'm afraid
I shall have to send you to bed, instead of letting you stay up until the others return from the picnic.
Bertie! Bertie!
Jesus, where are you?
Oh, Miranda!
I like this one.
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.
And summer's lease hath all too short a date."
That's funny!
Blowed if me watch hasn't stopped.
Dead on 12:00.
Real funny.
C'est tres jolie, n'est-ce pas?
Uh, you wouldn't have the time, I suppose, miss?
Ah, Miranda, your pretty little diamond watch.
Don't wear it anymore.
Can't stand the ticking above my heart.
Ah.
If it were mine, I'd wear it always.
Even in the bath.
Would you, Mr. Hussey?
Stopped at 12:00.
Never stopped before.
Must be something magnetic.
Well after 2:00, I'd say.
We'd better be careful.
I promised Mrs. Appleyard
I'd have you lot back at the college by 8:00.
Except for those people down there, we might be the only living creatures in the whole world.
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.
Yes, Marion?
I should like to make a few measurements of the base of the rock if we have time.
With Miranda and Irma.
Please, Mademoiselle.
We'll be back long before tea.
Et bien. Allez!
May I come too, please?
So long as you don't complain.
I won't.
I promise.
And don't worry about us, Mademoiselle.
We shall only be gone a little while.
Ah.
Now I know.
What do you know?
I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel.
Wait!
Can you manage it, Edith?
I don't know.
I don't want to get my feet wet.
Oh!
Thought the little fat one was gonna take a bath.
Some of them are real lookers.
Have a look at the shape of the dark one with the curls.
Built like an hourglass.
And 'ave a go at the last one!
The blonde!
Oh, she'd have a decent pair of legs.
All the way up to her bum.
I'd rather you didn't say crude things like that.
Oh, I say the crude things.
You just think 'em.
Miranda!
Take my word for it.
The sheilas are all alike when it comes to fellas.
Doesn't matter if it's a bloody college you come from, or the Ballarat Orphanage where me and me kid sister was dragged up.
I didn't know you were an orphan.
Geez. I haven't thought of that bloody dump in donkeys' years.
Miranda!
I think I'll just, uh, stretch my legs a bit before we go.
Look!
Not down at the ground, Edith.
Way up there in the sky.
Why can't we just sit on this log and look at the ugly old rock from here?
It's nasty here!
I never thought it would be so nasty, or I wouldn't have come!
We can't go much further.
We promised Mademoiselle... we wouldn't be long away.
If only we could stay out all night and watch the moon rise.
Blanche said Sara writes poetry in the dunny!
She found one there on the floor all about Miranda.
She's an orphan.
Sara reminds me of a little deer
Papa brought home once.
I looked after it, but it died.
Mama always said it was doomed.
Doomed?
What's that mean, Irma?
Doomed to die, of course.
"The boy stood on the burning deck, whence all but he had fled, tra la..."
I forget the rest.
I think I must be doomed.
I don't feel at all well.
I do wish you'd stop talking for once.
Poor Edith.
We'll go back soon.
Irma! Look at them!
Where in the world are they going?
Without their shoes!
Irma, wait!
Wait for me!
Please wait!
Wait, Irma, wait!
Whatever can those people be doing down there?
Like a lot of ants.
Surprising the number of human beings are without purpose.
Although it is probable they're performing some function unknown to themselves.
Everything begins and ends at exactly the right time and place.
Look!
Miranda, I feel awful, really awful.
Oh.
Miranda, I feel perfectly awful.
When are we going home?
When are we going home?
Miranda?
Miranda!
Miranda!
Miranda, don't go up there!
Come back!
I've gotta go.
That's Mrs. Appleyard.
Let someone else go.
They won't.
No. I'm on.
What time is it?
What've you got to do?
Mrs. Appleyard'll skin me.
We got plenty of time.
You'd better go.
Why are they so late?
God be praised!
Mademoiselle, why are you so late?
Madame, something terrible has happened.
What? What do you mean?
I can't...
And where in heaven's name is Miss McCraw?
We left her behind at the rock.
You left her behind?
Has everyone taken leave of their senses?
Miss Lumley, get these girls to bed immediately.
And Cook, Cook!
Hot soup, please, for all of them.
Mrs. Appleyard, I-I must speak to you alone.
Very well.
Straight up the stairs, girls.
Come along, quickly as you can.
Cook, I asked you for hot soup!
Well, ma'am, ma'am, the strength of it is this.
Three of your young ladies and Miss McCraw are m-missing on the rock.
What happened?
Well, now, Mrs. Appleyard, that's just the trouble.
Nobody knows what happened.
How soon after the girls did Miss McCraw leave?
Don't know.
No one knows.
No one saw her leave.
We were asleep.
And the little one?
Edith Horton.
Like I told you, she come tearin' out of the bushes, dress all torn, screamin' fit to...
Well, after we'd shooshed her screamin', all we could get out of her was that she'd left the other three somewhere up on the rock.
That's about all I can tell ya.
Miranda! Miranda!
Marion!
Marion!
Go on, get out of here.
Ah, stop it!
Come on.
Miranda!
Try to remember, Edith.
What it was that frightened you on the rock.
Think carefully, darling.
Carefully!
Did you speak to anyone?
There must have been something.
Was there a man?
Her legs were quite severely scratched.
From running through the brambles,
I should imagine.
Nothing else?
Nothing I could detect.
She hadn't been... molested?
No, no, nothing like that.
I have examined her.
She is quite intact.
Since you won't tell me all the details, how can I give you an opinion, Lionel?
There are no details.
People just don't disappear, my dear.
Not without good reason.
There's talk, is there?
Not just gossip.
People have... theories.
Go on.
Well, it couldn't be local.
Why couldn't it?
No one around here would do a thing like that.
I've just told you, Sergeant,
I simply noticed three young ladies crossing the creek.
What did they look like?
Hmm?
The girls.
Describe them to me.
Hmm, um, the first one was tall and dark.
Um, then there was the little dumpy one, then the girl with the glasses, and the last one was slim and fair.
That's four.
Pardon?
A few minutes ago you said there was only three of them.
Oh-Oh, ye...
That's because the dumpy one was back a little.
And then they moved off into the trees and that's the last we saw of them.
Perhaps we could go a little higher.
I was tired.
I sat down on a log.
Which log, Edith?
This one?
Look around you, darling.
Maybe you can see it now.
Is that the one?
You went that way?
I don't know.
I was tired.
I'm tired now.
There is one thing I remember.
What do you remember, Edith? 
Tell us.
It was when I was coming down, when I was running.
It was a cloud.
What sort of a cloud?
It was red.
I remember it clearly.
It was just after I passed Miss McCraw.
Who did you say you saw?
Miss McCraw.
She was going up the hill as I was going down.
Did she stop?
Did you speak?
No. She was too far away.
She was about as far away as those dead trees are over there.
She was funny.
Funny?
How?
I'd rather not say.
You must, Edith.
It could be very important.
It's rude.
Les pantalons.
She had no skirt.
Just les pantalons.
Drawers? 
You mean she was just wearing drawers?
One last go... for the bloodhound.
Miranda.
Why didn't you tell us you followed the four girls?
Because...
I didn't exactly follow them.
I just jumped across the creek and walked towards the rock for a little way.
I was curious.
In England, young ladies like that wouldn't be allowed to go walking in the forest.
Not alone, anyway.
But they'd gone by the time I came out of the trees, so I turned back.
As the girls were jumping the creek... what were you thinking of?
Hmm?
Ah, Michael.
Oh, Michael!
The old man hired me to look after the horses.
I'm buggered if I'm gonna be a lackey at a bloody garden party.
That's what I bloody well told 'im.
More or less.
Had the bloodhound out the other day.
I wake up every night in a cold sweat.
Just wondering if they're still alive.
Yeah, well, the way I look at it is this:
If the bloody cop and the bloody abo tracker and the bloody dog can't find 'em, well, no one bloody can.
People have been bushed before today, and as far as I'm concerned, that's the stone end of it.
Well, it's not the end of it as far as I'm concerned.
They may be out there dying of thirst on... on that infernal rock and... you and I are sitting here drinking cold bloody beer.
That's where you and me's different.
If you want my advice, the sooner you forget the whole thing, the better.
Well, I can't forget it, and I never will.
I'm not great shakes on music, but I reckon the governor must be leavin', eh?
Your aunt'll give you hell if you're not on show.
Albert.
I want to go back to the rock.
To look for them.
Will you come with me?
Beautiful birds, them swans.
A week in the bush... they'd be dead by now.
Then I'll go alone.
Coo-ee!
Albert!
Hello?
Coo-ee!
Mike!
Michael!
Michael!
We'll have to be goin' soon.
Dark before we get back.
I'm staying here.
You're what?
I'm staying here.
Here? On the rock?
Yes.
What the hell for?
You're mad.
Yes, perhaps I am. 
But I'm still staying, because somebody has to.
Just because you lot are Australians...
You're a funny bugger.
Well, what the hell am I gonna tell 'em when I get back there without ya?
You can tell 'em what you like.
Hmm? What? Woodend?
The Victoria, sir.
The little pub near the corner.
Mr. Michael's pretty knocked up, sir.
He's sleepin' there.
The pub.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm dashed if I know how his aunt will take it.
Yeah.
All right.
Carry on, Crundall.
Thank you, sir.
Stopped at twelve.
Never stopped before.
Everything begins and ends
at exactly the right time.
Waiting a million years just for us.
Look! Way up there in the sky!
Now I know!
What do you know?
Surprising the number of human beings
are without purpose.
Although it is probable
they are performing some function unknown to themselves.
Everything begins and ends
at exactly the right time and place.
Miranda.
Miranda!
Miranda!
Miranda!
Coo-ee!
Coo-ee!
Coo-ee!
Coo-ee!
Coo-ee!
Let me have him now, son.
I've had 30 years experience puttin' them in, so they don't fall out back on the road.
Eh, take her quietly, Sergeant.
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.
Help me!
Help me!
Mademoiselle, they found Irma.
What did you say?
They found Irma, and she's still alive.
Oh...
No one else?
No.
Now go home.
There's nothing you can do.
Go on, now. Go home!
This is a police matter.
Well, go on.
We've got a bloody right to know.
We'd like to know what's going on.
He's right.
We simply want something done about it.
Where's Bumpher?
What we should do is go to the bloody rock ourselves.
We've got our own self-respect to think about.
He's right, there.
Get Bumpher out here. Come on.
Come out, Bumpher!
Go back.
Go on. Go home.
The bloody lot of you.
Nothing you can do.
We can thank the Lord for this merciful deliverance of our dear classmate Irma, and pray that Marion and Miranda and our beloved Miss McCraw will be likewise spared.
It has been seen fit that Irma should convalesce at the home of Colonel Fitzhubert in Mount Macedon.
Although you'll be delighted at these good tidings,
I would ask you to remember, please, that of the three remaining lost members of the party, there is, as yet, no trace.
Would you come with me to my study, please, Miss Lumley?
You may carry on, Mademoiselle.
Wonderful news, Mrs. Appleyard.
Don't be so foolish, woman!
If all of them had been found but only one?
This makes it worse.
Far worse.
This tragedy is little more than a week old and already three... three, mark you... sets of parents have written advising me that their daughters will not be here next term.
Now the newspapers have something further to sensationalize about.
Newspapers all over the world have headlined our morbid affair, Miss Lumley.
I mean, you realize that, I suppose.
The three who have been withdrawn, plus the three still missing on the rock...
Two, Mrs. Appleyard. Only two now.
I'm quite sure Irma will be coming back.
That makes six, Miss Lumley... will not be with us next term.
In addition, there are several sets of tuition fees impossibly overdue.
Sara Waybourne, for instance.
Most inconsiderate, if I may say so, Mrs. Appleyard.
Yes.
Well, I...
I expect we shall see our way through somehow.
But don't let me detain you, Miss Lumley.
You have a class in a few minutes, I believe.
Senior needlework.
Just ask the Waybourne girl to come in to see me, please.
After luncheon will be convenient.
Yes, Mrs. Appleyard.
Oh, and Miss Lumley... do your best to forbid any idle gossip about this whole wretched business.
Yes, Mrs. Appleyard.
I will.
Shh!
Ah!
Remarkable. Hmm.
A week out in the bush and nothing more serious than shock and exposure.
Extraordinary.
No bones broken.
Some cuts and bruises to the face and hands.
To the hands especially.
Quite scratched.
The fingernails are all torn and broken.
There are several other unusual features.
Her head is quite badly bruised.
Probable concussion.
A blow, maybe?
Or a fall?
But then if she fell, why is the rest of the body unmarked?
It's quite unblemished.
And the feet, too, are quite unmarked, which is very strange as she was not wearing shoes or stockings when she was found.
We found no trace of 'em up on the rocks.
Mmm.
She's quite intact.
I'd give my head to know what really happened up there.
She's quite intact.
What is it, my girl?
Well, ma'am, it's Miss Irma.
Yes?
Well, it's about her clothing.
What is it, my dear?
Well, I didn't know whether the sergeant should be told.
There's, there's no corset.
Miss Irma's corset.
It's missing.
You did right, my dear.
It can't possibly be of any interest.
The north wind brings me no rest
Any number of unsolved murders there are.
Take, take Jack the Ripper, for instance.
The police are up there again, naturally.
Thick as flies.
Someone reported seein' a light flashing around a pigsty on a place about a mile from the rock.
There's some questions got answers and some haven't.
No. There'll be a solution turn up directly, more'n likely.
A kidnappin'.
Or, you know, something like that.
They might have fallen down a hole.
No, no. There's a solution somewhere, all right.
There's gotta be.
Come over here.
Come on.
Over here.
Did you know, lad, there are some plants that can move?
No.
Miss Lumley said you wanted to see me, 
Mrs. Appleyard.
That is correct.
Come in.
Close the door, please.
I have written several letters to your guardian, 
Mr. Cosgrove, Sara, but I have not been favored with a reply thus far.
In fact, it is all of six months since I have received a letter or a check.
I, therefore, have no alternative but to cancel all your extras.
This means that, as of today, you can no longer partake in dancing or drawing lessons.
And unless all your outstanding fees are paid by Easter,
I'm afraid we shall have to make other arrangements.
You know what that means, don't you, Sara?
You will have to go away.
There are places for girls in your predicament. 
Institutions.
Now off you go.
Sara.
Sara!
What's wrong with you?
Are you feeling ill?
People don't sit on cold steps in the dark unless they're weak in the head.
You heard the bell.
Go and wash for supper.
Aren't you hungry?
Well, you best go straight to bed.
Quickly.
Tell Mademoiselle I don't want it. 
Thank you.
But you must eat.
You'll get sick if you don't.
I'm sick already.
If I eat that, I'll be even sicker.
Nonsense.
Now come on, Miss Sara.
Do you know what, Minnie?
No. What?
I was in an orphanage once.
Were you, Sara?
I had a brother then... called Bertie.
I told the matron 
I wanted to be a lady circus rider on a white horse with a spangled dress.
She was afraid I'd run away, so she shaved my head.
I bit her arm. It bled.
So she painted my head with gentian violet.
The north wind brings me no rest
And death is in the sky
I love you, Minnie
I love you, darlin'.
I feel sorry for them kids.
The ones on the rock, you mean?
Yeah, them too.
I was thinkin' of them other poor little devils, here at the college.
Them. They're all right.
Rollin' in cash, most of them.
Or at least their mothers and fathers are.
Some of them are orphans... or wards, or...
You know.
Now I know.
What do you know?
What do you know?
I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel.
Hold it right there.
Thanks, gentlemen.
That's it. Smile, please.
Come on. Big smile.
Thank you, thank you.
Get those women over here, please.
The rope.
Not that stuff. The other.
Give me that rope over here.
What about a cup of tea up here?
Ah, tea. Ah.
Hello!
Good, good.
As if looking up.
Right up.
That's it. 
Looking for a cave or something like that.
Little more expression in the face, sir.
Hello, Irma.
Madame Fitzhubert showed me in.
How do you feel?
Oh, Irma!
Oh, Irma.
We thought you had gone forever.
Let me look at you, cherie.
You are so pale... but prettier than ever.
Has the nephew paid you a visit yet, the one who found you?
Yes.
And the policeman.
And you couldn't...
I, I remember... nothing.
Nothing!
I remember nothing!
Morning.
Send that reporter packing!
Girls. Girls, get inside at once!
There you are, Miranda, dear.
You liked these best.
Mr. Whitehead gave them to me to give to you, my dear, my sweet Miranda.
She likes daisies best of all.
Oh, Sara! Oh, Sara!
You do know that Miranda might not come back.
Miranda knows lots of things other people don't know.
Secrets.
She knew she wouldn't come back.
Fanny, you are ridiculously out of step.
Pay attention to the music, please!
Excuse me, Miss Lumley.
Voila, mes enfants!
See who we have with us today?
Our dear Irma is with us but for a few hours.
She is leaving soon to join her parents in Europe.
Alors, mes enfants.
For ten minutes, you may talk as you choose.
If you approve, Miss Lumley.
Tell us, Irma! Tell us!
What happened to Miranda, Irma?
You know what happened.
Tell us!
Tell us, Irma!
Why don't you tell us, Irma?
You know where they are!
Just tell us, Irma!
Tell us!
They're dead!
All dead and gone, Irma!
She's going to you know where!
You are a liar and a fool!
Mademoiselle?
It's for her own good!
To cure her terrible stooping!
Come in.
Well? Come in.
My notice, ma'am.
Have we an invalid in the house?
Miss Sara's supper, ma'am.
Mademoiselle asked me, seeing as the child's feeling poorly.
Oh. Minnie!
Hmm?
Kindly tell Miss Sara not to put her light out until I've had a word with her.
Yes, ma'am.
This is not a charitable institution.
You recall our recent discussion, Sara.
Answer me when I address you, child.
Yes.
I have considered your situation most carefully, and I have searched my mind and my conscience for a solution.
But this is not a charitable institution.
And as your fees have not been forthcoming,
I have been forced to make certain arrangements on your behalf.
You will be returned to the orphanage.
You still thinking about that bloody rock?
I can't help it.
It comes back at night in dreams.
I had a funny dream last night.
There was this smell.
Real strong.
It was like, like I was wide awake.
Dead quiet.
Pansies.
That's what it smelt like.
And the whole place was all lit up, bright as day.
Pitch black outside.
And there she is.
Who was it?
It was only a bloody dream!
My kid sister. 
Haven't seen her since the orphanage.
She always liked pansies.
And she went all sort of... misty-like.
I calls out, "Sara, don't go yet."
"Good-bye, Bertie," she says.
"I've come a long way to see ya, and now I must go."
And she went.
Clear through that wall over there.
Sit down, please, Mademoiselle.
Merci.
We were speaking last night about the Waybourne girl.
You expressed concern over the state of her health.
Yes, madame.
We have been relieved of any further responsibility.
Her guardian, Mr. Cosgrove, arrived this morning and took her away with him.
That's... 
But was she fit enough to travel?
Apparently.
I should have been here to supervise her packing.
I, myself, helped Sara put a few things she especially wanted into her little covered basket.
Mr. Cosgrove was in a hurry to get away.
I shall not be coming into luncheon, Mademoiselle.
Kindly tell them not to lay a place for me.
Nor for Sara?
Nor for Sara.
Is that rouge I see on your cheek, Mademoiselle?
Powder, madame.
I find it becoming.
Oh, God.
Bye!
Thank you very much for the lovely breakfast!
Bye-bye!
Hope you have a nice holiday!
Bye-bye!
Au revoir!
Frere Jacques
Frere Jacques
Au revoir, mes enfants.
Dormez vous
Dormez vous
Au revoir!
Arthur, my late husband, and I always took our annual holidays in Bournemouth.
Mmm. It's a delightful place.
Absolutely delightful.
Nothing changed.
Ever.
For 40 years.
The pier, the sands and the people.
And that guest house.
So dependable.
Completely and utterly dependable.
A little more, Mademoiselle?
No, madame.
As you wish.
I came to depend so much on Greta McCraw.
So much masculine intellect.
I came to rely on that woman.
Trust her.
How could she allow herself to be spirited away?
Lost.
Raped.
Murdered in cold blood like a silly schoolgirl on that wretched Hanging Rock.
Will Sara Waybourne be coming back this term, madame?
Oh!
Now where was I?
Oh, yes!
Bournemouth.
What a delightful place!
Nothing changed. Ever.
Dirty kids.
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Sara! Sara!
The body of Mrs. Arthur Appleyard,
principal of Appleyard College,
was found at the base of Hanging Rock on Friday the 27th of March, 1900.
Although the exact circumstances of her death are not known,
it is believed she fell while attempting to climb the rock.
A search for the missing schoolgirls and their governess
continued spasmodically for the next few years without success.
To this day, their disappearance remains a mystery.
What have we got?
Someone who's pretty good with a silencer. There's four bodies in here.
Three of them as cold as yesterday's toast. The last one's ready to pop up.
Take a look.
Shot clean as a whistle.
He was dead before he stopped talking.
Who's he calling?
Morgue.
We figure he saw the bullet coming.
Number two is in the elevator.
Whoever did it shoots fast.
He didn't even have time to fall down.
Never saw a dead witness that could identify you. Where are the others?
Scrub woman on the third floor and a guest in 306.
- Let's go.
- Three, please.
We'll walk.
Let's have a look, boys.
Bullet hit her spine.
We couldn't bend her.
Probably have to bury her like that.
Number four is in here.
They were really after him.
A drunk across the hall found him.
Talked for an hour when he noticed he wasn't getting any answers.
- Who is he?
- Floyd Merkle.
Runs a two-bit detective agency on Third and Bulldyke.
Partner's name is Lou Peckinpaugh.
Looks like a setup.
- Whose room was it?
- An Oriental. Checked in on Wednesday.
- Name was Wun Fat Ching.
- "Wun Fat Ching"?
Registered his hometown as Pecan, China.
Peking.
No, Pecan. Like the nut.
No other leads except one interesting fact.
His partner, Peckinpaugh, was having an affair with Merkle's wife, Georgia...
...for the past nine years.
Merkle never caught on.
Hell of a detective. I wouldn't hire him to find warts on a frog.
Lieutenant, found two more stiffs next door.
Everybody checks out at the same time.
Elderly couple.
Moved in last night.
They must have heard everything that went on in the next room.
If they had a radio to listen to, those two kids would be alive today.
Let's pay a visit...
...to the widow, Merkle.
Lou, it's Georgia.
Oh, hello, Georgia.
I just had you on my mind.
What's new, kid?
Floyd is dead.
Say that again?
- Lou, it's Georgia.
-No, after that.
Floyd is dead. Shot in Chinatown.
I talked to the police, Lou. I think
they know about us having an affair.
When did they leave?
They didn't. They're standing right next to me now, listening.
- Oh, Jesus!
-I loved him, Lou.
You know I loved Floyd.
I know, angel.
Almost as much as I love you.
You killed him because you're crazy about me, didn't you?
Did the cops hear that?
They said yes.
Don't call me anymore, Georgia.
We're not good for each other.
Mr. Peckinpaugh?
I think I have some information regarding the untimely death...
...of your late, deceased, murdered partner.
Who is this?
As the Chinese say, "Never mind."
We must be careful.
I'm being watched.
Can we meet in your office in 15 minutes?
All right. What time is it now?
I'd rather not tell you until I know I can trust you.
- Should I keep the change?
- No, I'll keep the change.
Give me homicide.
Never mind.
I'm sorry.
I must have dropped off.
Glad you spoke up. I was gonna arrange to have you buried.
I haven't had much sleep lately.
I've been under a great strain.
I don't suppose you'd have a drink?
Dry martini?
Olive or onion?
Onion, please.
Thank you.
You're the first person to show me any kindness since I got to San Francisco.
And when was that, Mrs...?
Manderley. Denise Manderley.
Two days ago from Shanghai.
May I have my things, please?
You're not a U.S. citizen?
I spend a great deal of my time abroad.
Actually, I travel under a Danish passport.
The signature's been tampered with.
Your name isn't Manderley.
No. It's Wanda Coleman.
Why does your driver's license say Gilda Dabney?
I believe my life's in danger, that's why I've taken so many precautions.
My real name is Chloe LaMarr.
Thank you, Miss LaMarr.
I appreciate your honesty.
Can you tell me why you let yourself in to search my office?
What were you looking for?
- To be frank, your bathroom.
- I don't have any.
Yes. I found that out a little too late.
Can we stop playing games now?
It isn't Manderley or Coleman or Dabney or even LaMarr, is it?
The initials on this handkerchief are A.P.
- What does A.P. stand for?
- Alma Chalmers.
Chalmers begins with a "C."
This is a "P."
Palmers. Alma Palmers.
Give me the runaround one more time, and I'll slap you around this office.
I don't care! Just make one up so I know what to call you.
Vivian Purcell.
- Good.
- Carmen Montenegro.
That's my last one, I promise.
Don't be cross with me,
Mr. Peckinpaugh.
I depend on the gentleness and understanding of strangers.
- You know about Merkle's death?
- Why should I?
You called me telling me you knew something.
A woman knows many things.
About Merkle's death?
I don't think so.
Why would a woman know that?
Why did you call me?
Could I have a little air?
I'm feeling rather dizzy.
Is that any better?
Yes, thank you.
I'm afraid I got sick all over your filing room in there.
That's my clothes closet, but don't worry about it. Go on.
I have a niece, Caroline. She's 17.
Attends boarding school at the Hail Mary...
...Sister Therese Convent and Kennels.
"Kennels"? Isn't that for dogs?
None of the girls were very pretty.
Two weeks ago, she climbed over the wall and disappeared.
She has not been heard from since.
I hired Mr. Merkle to find her, and he called tonight saying he had a lead.
That's not much to go on, but I'll do the best I can.
For the fee, I'll settle for what you owe Merkle.
I'm sorry I went pookie-pookie on your coat.
It's all right. It's all part of this dirty game.
You must be tired.
Why don't you run along now...
...and I'll call you as soon as I get something.
I've moved to the Fairmont, and I'm registered as Diane Glucksman.
Well, don't change it because it makes it hard to leave messages.
Sorry, no tip. War veteran.
I thought I told you to stay away.
Don't be angry with me, Lou.
I had to see you.
They brought Floyd's body home.
I couldn't sleep in the same bed with him, not tonight.
Your husband's dead an hour, and you're already dressed in black?
- How long you had that outfit?
- You're wrong. I just bought it.
There's an all-night widow shop at Fifth and Geary.
- Aren't you gonna kiss me?
- You shouldn't be here.
The police already think I killed
Floyd to clear the way for us.
- You sure the police didn't follow you?
- Positive.
They came with me.
This is definitely our last date, Georgia.
Mind answering some questions downtown?
We are downtown.
Then this'll be fine.
Floyd Merkle was killed at
I was home in bed.
I got up around 10:15, and I went into the john.
I got out around 10:20.
- Anybody see you go in the bathroom?
- Yeah, seven or eight people.
They came in to watch me one at a time.
I got their names and addresses written on a pad.
Don't press your luck, shamus.
- Get him off my back.
- Get off his back.
What did you and Merkle argue about Monday night?
It's all right.
Tell them, darling.
Don't call me darling in front of the police with a dead husband.
I didn't like that he was taking on clients without telling me.
That's what I told them, Lou.
I didn't mention anything...
...about him finding us in the gorilla costumes.
Why don't you go in the kitchen and bake some doughnuts?
What case was Floyd working on?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?
- Because he's dead.
Well, you two should have a nice conversation.
I'm warning you, withhold anything from me...
...and you'll be painting the Golden Gate Bridge...
...with your tongue.
You're going out on that case, aren't you?
Lou, come away with me tonight.
We'll go where the fog never rolls in...
...and a man can see what a woman looks like in the morning.
Being a private eye may not be much, but we do have a code of honor.
It's okay to fool around with your partner's wife.
But once he's dead, it makes it dirty.
That's the way it is, angel.
You marry yourself a nice guy, have a couple of swell kids.
Once you're all set up and happy, maybe we can fool around again.
Guys like you all end up the same, Lou.
You're so busy chasing after runaway girls and missing husbands...
...you never stop long enough to find out what life is really all about.
One day, I'll see your picture in the papers...
...laying in a gutter with a bullet hole in your back...
...and a horse making doo-doo on you.
Maybe I'll cry for you...
...but don't hold your breath.
You need any dough, kid?
I'm okay. I got $10,000 insurance money.
An hour after the murder?
It's that company that pays on the spot.
So long, Lou.
It was nice cheating with you.
Don't hang up.
- I didn't even say hello.
-I know where the girl is.
Keep talking.
Oh, so now you're interested, eh?
- Who is this?
-Not on the phone.
Meet me at Nix Place on the waterfront in half an hour.
How will I know you?
I'm swarthy and greasy and wear cheap perfume.
You'll smell me when you come in.
Suppose I'm not interested?
Does $500 interest you?
Very much.
Then bring it. It's an expensive restaurant.
You're expected, Mr. Peckinpaugh.
This way, please.
Your party will join you in a moment.
Hiya, Mr. Lou.
You said you'd never come back to...
But I did. Hello, Tinker.
Has she ever...
No, she hasn't.
Right.
Want me to play...?
- No.
- Right.
Colonel Schlissel...
...you do my cafe a great honor.
Your club reminds me of the fighting strength of the French army, Marcel.
Nothing more than an evening's diversion.
You make a little joke, monsieur.
If you and your two friends will follow me...
...I will show you to your usual, world-dominating table.
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
...let's have a big San Francisco welcome for Miss Betty DeBoop!
Now everybody!
Now just the boys!
Now just the girls!
Now just me.
Hello, Fred.
I was hoping you'd drop by.
The name is Lou, and we've never met.
Let's not get into a sweat about details.
Aren't you gonna light my fire?
Certainly.
I was just looking over your kindling wood.
If you're not busy, Fred,
I get off at 2.
Don't you think 2 is a good time to get off on?
Gentlemen, may I present Miss
Betty DeBoop from the islands?
Caribbean or Virgin?
Well, let's just say
I came back a Caribbean!
How delightfully gauche.
I've always been enchanted with a lack of breeding.
Let me introduce myself. I'm Colonel
Prince Count Baron von Schlisseldorf...
...German military attache to Cincinnati.
Don't crack your shins on my account, boys.
Your party will see you now.
He's in booth seven.
- The French Underground just called.
- Quiet, you fool!
There are enemy ears all over.
Lower your voice!
What is it?
Now it's too low.
I didn't hear anything.
- Testing. One. Two.
- That's better. Now what is it?
DuChard and his wife are on their way here.
I tried to stop them, but I was too late.
That's why Schlissel comes every night, hoping to get his hands on DuChard.
I don't think that's completely true.
I think he really likes the roast veal.
Please do come in, Mr. Peckinpaugh.
Pepe Damascus, at your disposal.
I hope my disgustingly cheap perfume does not offend you.
I purposefully stink to keep my enemies from getting too close.
Well, they're better off than your friends are.
- You said you knew where the girl is.
- I do know where the girl is.
You're very impatient,
Mr. Peckinpaugh.
Care for some Greek Kasseri?
Quit stalling. You got something to say, talk fast.
There is no niece Caroline or Priscilla or whatever Mrs. Danvers told you.
She also didn't tell me it was Mrs. Danvers.
It was she who hired your partner to search for a certain...
...missing object d'art.
Talk faster. I can't take much more of your voice.
Perhaps she killed Mr. Merkle in fear that he would double-cross her.
A dangerous woman?
Does oatmeal have lumps?
In Cairo, she put a live electric wire in my bathtub.
Fortunately, I survived...
...but I used to have straight hair.
Am I right in assuming that you want me to work for you?
Precisely. Help me find...
...the missing object, and I shall split a fortune with you, 50-50.
Shall we shake on it?
If we do, I want 60-40.
How do you stand yourself?
It isn't easy.
No hotel will take me for the entire night.
Pardon, monsieur.
Yes?
I have a message for Mr. Damascus.
Will you give it to him?
What is it?
Mr. B has arrived in San Francisco from Jerusalem.
He's staying at the Crusades Hotel.
- I'll give it to him.
- Thank you.
And here's a dollar for your trouble.
So at last he's arrived.
Who's this Mr. B?
Jasper Blubber.
An insidiously dangerous tub of lard.
We must move quickly.
And what is this thing that you're all after anyway?
Curiosity killed the puddycat.
Pass the buck, please.
Thank you.
If you have to get in touch with me,
I'll be at the Biltmore Hotel...
...until 2:30 a.m.
Then they make me move to the Stratford Arms.
If you bathe with turpentine, you'll be fine in the morning.
Taxi!
Paul, are you sure we ought to be here?
There is nothing to worry about, my dear. We're in England now.
No, Paul. This is America.
Oh, yes. America.
We should've gone to a doctor, Paul.
I'm not sure I got all that bullet out of your head.
Oh, cherie, it doesn't matter.
It's the thought that counts.
- I beg your pardon.
- No, it's my fault.
All right.
Oh, Madame DuChard!
Paul, it's so good to see you!
I tried to stop you both from coming.
Paul, you must leave at once.
Colonel Schlissel of the Cincinnati
Gestapo is here.
So the Black Fox has followed me from France, huh?
I am safe as long as I stay here in San Francisco.
He knows you intend to open a French restaurant in Oakland.
If you step on the Oakland Bridge, your life isn't worth two francs.
Marcel, I haven't come this far to be stopped now.
We must open a two-star
French restaurant in Oakland...
...where all free Frenchmen can gather around the radio to listen to the war.
Paul is an obstinate man.
Even with a bullet in it, his mind is made up.
What about the documents?
Your papers of ownership and the liquor license are to be delivered...
...by a courier here tonight.
Marcel, France owes you a great debt.
It's about 1500 francs, but we can settle later.
What a pleasant surprise,
Monsieur DuChard.
So the Black Fox and the Silver Wolf meet again.
And of course you remember the
Gray Rabbit and the Blue Chipmunk.
May I present my wife, Marlene?
The White Swan.
Of course.
It is the most courageous of men who win the most beautiful women.
But it is only the ruthless who get to keep them.
And it is 1000 candles that will burn for every brave soldier...
...that marches to the steps of the drums of liberty...
...so that tyranny won't trample the spirit of freedom in men's hearts...
...throughout a world thrown into darkness and despair.
Well spoken.
Whatever it means.
May I present Miss DeBoop?
Like yourself, a well-built exile.
Hi, honey.
Don't let the heinie get you down.
It is despots and tyrants who run our rivers red...
...with the colors of a hundred trampled flags...
...that unfurl in the winds of liberty, blowing over centuries of deprivation...
It's all right.
We've made our point.
...where men who've known treachery and treason...
...can still light torches in the caves of honor.
We'll have a drink and see the show.
It'll calm you down.
There, gentlemen, goes a brave, beautiful...
...and extremely boring woman.
Do you like chocolate, my dear?
I can get you German chocolate bars, much better than Hershey's.
May I help you?
What is it, darling?
You look as if you've seen a ghost.
No, Paul.
Just someone I used to know.
- Would you excuse me?
- Of course.
Hello, Tinker. How have you been?
I don't know no other song, ma'am.
Only one I know.
"One-Song Tinker," that's me.
You haven't forgotten it, Tinker.
You could never forget it.
I can't play it, ma'am, without the music.
You see, I'm a piano man that needs his music.
Here, take mine.
Hello, Marlene.
Long time, no see.
Hello, Louis.
No see in long time.
How long has it been?
A lot of water has passed under the bridge.
I got married, and I'm trying to run an underground.
Why didn't you say you like heroes?
I would've...
...helped an old lady across the street.
I swallowed my gum.
You made me swallow my gum.
Anything wrong?
No. It's my mistake, sir.
I thought that this young lady was a girl that I knew in France.
I was wrong.
The girl I know is dead.
A natural error, monsieur.
My wife has been mistaken for dead girls by many men.
Paul, the courier is here with the documents.
Let's go.
May I have your attention, please!
From the BBC in London:
The First German Panzer Division...
...has entered the
rue de Castiglione.
Paris has fallen!
Paris!
I cannot believe it.
Maybe it's a different Paris.
I don't think so.
There's only one Paris.
When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to flicker
In the sky
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get them peepers?
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get them eyes?
I told you not to play that song.
I'm sorry, Mr. Lou.
I told her you wouldn't like it.
- Monsieur, everything is in order.
- Not here, you fool!
Give him the papers in the toilet.
- Where are you going?
- In the toilet for the papers.
I must have been crazy falling for a dame that would wear a hat like that.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Strike up the band.
- What happened?
- There was a fight.
The Germans took the documents.
- Your hand...?
- Yes. They slammed the seat on it.
But the gunshots!
I thought you were....
No, madame. It was us.
Busboy, clean this table.
Without the papers, we're prisoners here.
Paul, what will we do?
I don't know, my dear.
I don't know.
Sorry about Paris, folks.
Sorry.
Perhaps there is the one man in San Francisco who can help us.
Of all the cheap gin joints in the world...
...I pick this one.
It's your nickel.
I'd like Mr. Peckinpaugh, please.
Who wouldn't?
Mr. Peckinpaugh, I believe you had the distinct pleasure...
...of meeting Mr. Damascus last night.
- Who is this?
-Jasper Blubber.
Blubber, huh?
Yeah, he mentioned you.
Would it be possible to meet you today
to discuss the missing item...
... shall we say, so to speak,
if you will?
Sure. Why not, by your leave.
Twelve noon at the bar of the Crusades Hotel.
How will I recognize you?
You'll have no trouble there, sir.
I'm an extra-large man.
I'll be sitting on the first two stools as you come in.
Who is it?
Marcel from the club.
And Paul DuChard, the hero.
I'm sorry. I thought you were alone.
I tried it that way.
It's not as much fun alone.
What can I do for you boys?
Mr. Peckinpaugh...
...last night certain documents belonging to me were stolen.
I need a man with skill and daring to get those papers back...
...for me and for France.
You can pay, of course?
Monsieur, we....
We're not wealthy people.
We lost over 4 million francs betting on the war.
Who'd you have?
We took France at 8-to-5.
They suckered you.
I have this golden watch.
It was given to me by the President of the Republic.
It is very valuable...
...and it plays a lovely little tune.
It's yours if you'll help us.
Mimi
You funny little
Good-for-nothing, Mimi
Am I the guy?
Mimi
You got anything in a rumba?
I like rumbas.
Do we?
Too bad.
Sorry, boys, but this is not a pawnshop.
I'm using rented bullets for my gun.
We all got problems.
Monsieur, perhaps when America is confronted with war...
...you will think differently.
Thank God I think as a Frenchman.
-Vive la France!
-Vive la Republique!
Hooray for Hollywood!
I like the way you handle yourself, Fred.
I do all right.
Here, take this.
And if you thank me for it, so help me, I'm gonna slug you.
What is it?
A ticket to Africa.
A girl with your voice has got no place singing in a dump like America.
You just can't take it when someone like me gets too close, can you?
My friend's got a little club on the Ivory Coast. He's a good Joe...
...but he's got a touch of leprosy.
Just don't shake his hand too hard.
See you around, Slinky.
Well, that's the way it goes.
But if you ever get lonely, Fred, you just call me.
You know how to dial, don't you?
Just put your finger in the little round hole.
I'll write it down.
What do you say, kid?
No school today?
Keep riding me, Mac. They'll bury you in 42 different cemeteries.
Cranky, aren't you?
That happens when your second teeth start coming in.
Blubber?
Who you calling "Blubber"?
Over here, Mr. Peckinpaugh.
I am Jasper Blubber.
What a relief.
I was afraid I'd have to page you.
They would've beat my brains in.
You drink of course?
Why not?
One Gin Sling.
I'd rather have a brandy.
One Gin Sling is the waiter.
One brandy, One Gin Sling.
Now, sir...
...let's not waste your time.
Let's get down to business.
What arrangements have you made with the woman?
Which woman?
The one who came to your office last night. Natasha Ublenskaya!
Good. I thought you was talking about somebody else.
Yes, she apparently has information regarding my partner's murderer.
She and Damascus are after the same thing. And so are you...
...unless I miss my guess.
Your reputation is not unwarranted, sir.
Drink up, and I'll tell you an astounding story.
This is a gin sling.
It is?
I was wrong.
The waiter's name is Brandy.
Now, sir, in 1853...
...a little-known historical fact occurred.
Twelve Albanian fishermen...
...conquered China,
Tibet and Mongolia.
My goodness, I didn't know that.
That's because you didn't take history in Albania.
Now, eventually, the men returned home...
...with the richest spoils of war ever documented.
Each man had a 760-carat diamond...
...the size and shape of a large brown AA New Jersey egg.
Each diamond egg...
...is worth in excess of a quarter of a million dollars.
I believe you, sir. Go on.
They turned up in Paris in 1924.
A clever designer had strung all 12 eggs together...
...and sold it as a necklace for a wealthy, overweight woman...
...who was trying to conceal a double chin.
That woman was murdered, and the diamonds disappeared.
End of story?
The beginning for me, sir.
The murderer was a Romanian sailor...
...by the name of
Vladimir Tserijemiwtz.
- Can you say that again?
- Not without spitting.
Well, sir...
...I have spent 16 years and every penny I have, sir...
...tracking this man down.
And at last I have found him.
He is here in San Francisco, just as sure as you're sitting there.
He's changed his name by making an anagram out of his original name.
For seven years, I've tried to unscramble it, to no avail.
Do you mind if I look at that?
Don't waste your time, sir.
I've had well-paid experts give up on it.
Once I find him, the rest is academic.
Of course.
Do you mind if I take these?
Not at all.
I'm afraid our meeting has come to an end, sir.
We should leave separately.
It makes more sense if I go first.
Why is that?
Then I don't get stuck with the check.
Yes?
I know you did, Mrs. Merkle.
Mr. Peckinpaugh?
No, he hasn't come in yet.
You have a visitor in there, a Miss Sophie DeVega.
- Pretty?
- Prettier than me, but I'm easier.
I'm saving you for the rainy season.
Yes, Mrs. Merkle,
I'll tell him you called.
I will. I promise. I swear.
Oh, yeah.
You're good at crosswords.
Try your hand at an anagram.
See if you find a name that makes sense out of this.
And if you find it in the Frisco phone book...
...your rainy season may be tonight.
- Miss DeVega, I presume?
- Mr. Peckinpaugh?
- You look startled.
- No, no.
It's just that you look like...
...14 other dames that was here the other night.
Yes, I know.
They were my sister.
Well, that explains the resemblance.
Not to me. She was adopted.
Yeah, well, so am I...
...but I don't look like your sister either.
What can I do for you?
I want you to find someone for me.
I'm looking for my....
I'm sorry. It's just so hard for me to say it.
I would like for you to find my husband...
My father.
- Husband.
- Make up your mind.
Which one do you want?
Both.
They are the same man,
Mr. Peckinpaugh.
You mean you married your own father?
It's not like you think. It was a simple wedding, done very tastefully.
I'm sure it was.
- If you could just give me his name.
- Vladimir Tserijemiwtz.
Vladimir Tserijemiwtz.
How do you spell that?
I'm not sure.
Well, we were never that close.
Well, that's understandable.
Leave everything in my hands, and I'll get in touch with you in a few days.
Do you have any money?
Well, Daddy left a $10,000 trust fund for each of us girls...
...but as his wife, I can't touch it.
Well, here's $20.
Now go to a beauty parlor and get that cheap dye washed out of your hair.
When you're ready to tell me the truth, Mrs. Montenegro, call me.
I'm getting tired of playing "Guess
What the Fruitcake's Name is Today."
You're still sore about me upchucking on your trench coat?
You're good, baby, but you're not that good.
I know who you're looking for and why you want to find him.
Don't call me for three days.
And when you do, use your real name.
By the way, what is it?
Mary Jones. I swear it, Lou.
Well, change it. It sounds phony.
Right, I'll tell him.
Lou, your landlady...
...Mrs. O'Brien, says someone's broken into your apartment.
She says they're still there.
That's good. That means I'm making a lot of people nervous.
Including Mrs. O'Brien!
Well, lookie here.
If it isn't Mrs. DuChard herself.
I expected a housebreaker.
Instead I found a heartbreaker.
Louis, don't.
Wearing the dress I bought you for Bastille Day...
...in that shop near the cafe...
...where we had turtle soup and coffee every day.
- And the waiter's name was Sheldon.
- Louis, don't.
Do you still go dancing in that smoky little club...
...where the men and women use the same john?
Don't, Louis!
Moving your body next to his, slowly around the room.
Don't say those things to me, Louis.
Dancing closer to the bandstand so you can hear the music...
...and singing into his ear:
Hi-ho, hi-ho
It's off to work we go
Stop it, Louis! Stop it!
Do you think I have no feelings?
No memories?
Did you think my heart didn't stop last night...
...when I saw you standing there?
I almost forgot what you looked like.
Day by day, I erased your face from my mind...
...little by little, till all I had left...
...was your right ear and three front, bottom teeth.
I still carry your picture in my locket.
Naturally, I had to cut off your head in case Paul found it.
Suddenly, it all seems as though it was yesterday.
I stood in that train station.
I waited for you for over six hours.
Then when your letter came, it started to rain...
...and I opened it, and the ink ran all over the page.
My most important letter...
...I still don't know what in the hell it said.
It said, "Dear Louis:
I love you more than life itself.
But to run off with you now that my country is in danger...
...would be an act of cowardice.
I'm marrying Paul DuChard because..."
And that's all I can remember.
You can't remember why you married him?
That letter was written a long time ago.
I've written thousands of letters since.
What's the difference?
What's done is done.
Can't remember why she married him.
I must have gone through eight liquor stores.
Don't you have a copy of the letter?
Don't you keep copies?
I keep only what's in my heart...
...and you've never left it.
Did you ever stop to worry that
I might have killed myself over you?
And if you had, it would have been easier than what I went through.
Sleeping night after night with a man I didn't really love.
Feeling his hands on my skin.
Watching me undress.
Taking baths and showers with me.
Making me wear all sorts of...
All right, I got the picture!
I heard it!
Let's go on to something new.
I want to come back, Louis.
I want to start over.
To pick up the pieces of our broken lives.
I want to be with you, to love you...
...to take care of you.
Just like that, huh?
Well...
...I would like to redecorate this room.
I don't like this chair very much.
You mean it? You and me, just the way it was?
Not the way it was. Better.
How could it be better than it was?
I know so much more, Louis.
Paul has taught me so much...
I don't want to hear about it.
Let's keep it the way it was.
All right.
The way it was.
Do you have any champagne?
I still got the bottle I was saving for our honeymoon.
I got the bread and cheese too, but they're as hard as a rock.
I'll be right back.
I'm as happy as a schoolboy.
Hi-ho, hi-ho
It's off to work we go
Need any help, Fred?
What are you doing here?
I missed my boat.
It doesn't sail till tomorrow.
So I missed it a little early.
You can't stay here.
I'm busy picking up the pieces of my life.
If it's just a piece you want, Fred, you can pick it up right here.
I want you out of here.
I'll get her into the bathroom.
That will be your signal to go.
Sometimes it doesn't pay to treat a dame like you nice.
You'll be back.
- What makes you think so?
- You forgot the glasses.
This chair looks much better over here. Don't you think so?
Oh, Louis, I can't wait to give my first party.
Here's to us, kid.
And the way it was.
And here's to love...
...and thanking you for stealing the papers from Colonel Schlissel...
...and then seeing that Paul is safely out of San Francisco.
Is it something I said?
So that's it!
That's why you came up here tonight...
...with your bedroom eyes...
...and your dining room lips.
Playing me for a sap, and all the while you were just using me...
...to get your French-fried husband out of the fat.
You don't give a hill of beans about me, do you?
That's not true, Louis.
I do give a hill.
Come in.
No, that was me.
Excuse me.
I think I need a couple of aspirin.
Who is she, Lou?
I want to know who she is.
- What are you doing here?
- You said you'd call me.
Why didn't you call, Lou?
I missed the funeral because
I didn't wanna leave the phone.
You didn't bring the cops again, did you?
I had him cremated.
This is all that's left of him.
Look!
I always thought of him as a bigger man.
Here, Lou.
Don't do that, Georgia.
But it's for you.
You keep him.
He was your partner.
He was your husband.
He belongs on your mantelpiece.
I don't want him.
I want you.
Oh, God! I'm so crazy about you!
Watch it!
You're spilling Floyd!
Take me away, Lou!
Take me away, or I'll tell the cops how you and Floyd fought over me.
It wouldn't take much to pin his murder on you.
Can we talk about this in a few seconds? I have company.
- Are you coming back?
- I'm in here a lot.
Hurry.
Screw Floyd back on.
I'm leaving, Louis.
It was wrong of me to come here and try to resurrect the past.
What was, was...
...and will never be was again.
Wait!
I lost you once.
I'm not gonna lose you again.
Somehow I'll get those papers from Schlissel.
You and your husband meet me at the Oakland Ferry at 12:00.
On the boat, I give him the papers, and you give him the air.
There's no turning back now, angel.
And then it's you and me, just the way it was.
Only better.
I told you, I don't want it better!
Now get out of here.
I got work to do.
Tell me, Louis.
All those years you waited for me...
- ...was there ever another girl?
- Never.
Lou, I came as fast as I could.
I see.
Did I ever tell you about...
...Paul and I skinny-dipping on the Riviera?
Don't tell me those things.
It's not what you think.
She's my secretary.
I'll see you at the ferry.
All right.
I'll bring along some wallpapers for you to pick out.
I'm sorry, Lou, but I did it!
I unscrambled the name.
Good girl.
Wait there.
I'll be right back.
Come here.
Maybe you're right, Slinky.
Maybe you and I are one of a kind.
I'm leaving here tomorrow night and taking you with me.
But I want you to do something for me first.
I love it when you give me orders.
Arrange to get Schlissel into the club tonight.
Five will get you 10, he's got DuChard's papers with him.
I need those papers, angel.
And I need them bad.
- You want me to...
- Don't tell me how you'll do it.
What I don't know won't hurt me.
I'll see you tomorrow night at the Oakland Ferry at 12:00.
You're a good Joe.
And then it's a slow boat to China for you and me, kid.
Now get out of here.
I got work to do.
Don't wear yourself out.
I'm saving that for me.
I'll see you tomorrow, Fred.
Fred?
What do you got?
Here it is, Lou. And wait'll you hear who it turns out to be!
Hold it a second.
I'll be right with you.
I tripped on the mat.
I couldn't help it.
He's in there.
That's Floyd, Lou!
All right, get ahold of yourself.
No point crying over spilt husbands.
Take it easy.
I guess this is the wrong time to say a prayer.
Now I have no one.
Only you.
And if I can't have you...
...no one will.
Are you crazy?
Give me that gun!
Oh, God! We shot Floyd again!
All right.
All right.
Easy, easy.
He's past all that now.
I don't wanna hear any more nonsense...
...about you trying to pin
Floyd's murder on me.
I won't, Lou.
As long as I know we'll be together.
Of course we will, angel.
Only we're gonna get out of San Francisco.
Now, you bring all them letters
I wrote you...
...and meet me tomorrow night at the Oakland Ferry at 12:00.
- You got that?
- Anything you say, darling.
That's a good girl.
Now grab a cab, and get a good night's sleep.
You know I'd do anything for you, Lou.
- Hello, Miss Duffy.
- Hello, Mrs. Merkle.
I'm awfully sorry
I couldn't be at the funeral.
We'll all miss him.
But Floyd is in his final resting place now.
Or soon will be.
All right, come on in.
I can wait if there's more.
Sit down.
- Let's hear what you got.
- Hold on to your hat.
Vladimir Tserijemiwtz...
...is Ezra C.V. Mildew Dezire Jr.
Wait a minute.
Tserijemiwtz is two "T's." The name you come up with don't have none.
That was the whole key.
Some people spell the Czar of Russia "T-S-A-R."
But in America, we spell it "C-Z-A-R."
Any fool knows that.
So when I tried the American spelling, I came up with...
...Ezra C.V. Mildew Dezire Jr.
Of course.
Who the hell is he?
- The owner of the Golden Gate Bridge.
- Right.
You did fine, angel.
Now forget you ever heard that name.
Don't ever repeat it to anyone.
Yes, he is.
Who's calling, please?
It's him!
Ezra C.V. Mildew Dezire Jr.
I told you not to repeat it!
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Dezire.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning, your place.
Yes, I know where that is.
Where the rich people live.
Not at all.
It's my pleasure, sir.
He wants to see me.
All the pieces are beginning to fall into place, angel.
And I got you to thank for it, kid.
Go ahead and thank me, Lou.
Thank me here, now.
You don't know how long I've waited for a really good thank.
Are you telling me that...?
Yes. I know I look like
I've been around...
...but I've never been thanked in my whole life.
You sweet, silly kid.
Why haven't I ever noticed you before?
Who is it?
Lady Edwina Morgan St. Paul.
It's that crazy Mrs. Montenegro.
Sorry, angel.
I'm gonna have to give you that thank some other time.
I knew there'd be one more.
Good night, kid.
Good night, Lou.
Hello.
Certainly.
No tip.
Death in the family.
I wish it was you!
I'm Lou Peckinpaugh. I have an appointment with Mr. Dezire.
Well, I suppose that's his business.
Wait in here, please.
Mind if I smoke?
If it were my house, yes.
See anything you like?
I'm Jezebel Dezire.
Accent on the Dezire.
How do you do?
I'm Peck Loukinpaugh.
Don't worry.
I do that to everyone.
Even to myself.
Ezra just got up from his nap.
It takes a while to get his motor started.
You may go now, Beatrice.
Ma'am.
How do you do, sir?
I'm Lou Peckinpaugh.
What's he saying?
You're pumping too much blood to his head.
Sorry.
Are you all right, dear?
Oh, good.
Would Daddy like to swim tonight?
Would he?
Your father called last night.
He said he needed my services.
Oh, he's not my father.
The old coot's my husband.
I'm sorry.
You can imagine how I feel.
I am so grateful...
...you're going to help my husband.
He needs all he can get.
It's chilly in here, darling.
Wouldn't you like to sit near the nice, cozy fire?
Sure you would.
Here we go!
What a butterfingers I am!
Nice catch, Mr. Peckinpaugh.
I was almost a widow.
Won't you join me in a little drinky?
What's your pleasure?
What you got there looks good.
I know, but I thought you'd like a little drink first.
Very gracious.
I've been over your bridge many times.
You certainly have a nice location.
Right over the water and everything.
Would you like anything to nibble on?
No, no. I don't...
...nibble on the job, thank you.
Just how did you folks pick me?
From the phone book.
I liked the sound of your name.
Peckinpaugh. Know what I mean?
I think everyone knows what you mean.
You got a nicely built house, sir.
Like a brick shingle.
Why don't you pull up a sofa and sit down?
Thank you.
You said on the phone last night...
...that you thought that I could be of some service to you.
Just how good is your service?
I try to satisfy.
Do you charge by the hour or by the satisfaction?
By the results.
I take it the old boy don't hear too good.
He hears everything we're saying.
Oh, really?
How you doing, old-timer?
Forget him. Otherwise he'll want to come everywhere with us.
Look, Mrs. Dezire, you're a very attractive woman...
...but I'm here on business.
Now why did he call me last night?
He thinks I'm cheating on him.
He wants you to find out who the man is.
Some of my jewelry is missing, and Ezra thinks I gave it to my lover.
Did you give it to him?
Everything but my jewelry.
What kind of jewelry is missing?
Nothing important.
Just a few trinkets and burbles.
Trinkets and what?
Burbles.
You know, like burbles and bangles.
The word you're looking for,
Mrs. Dezire, is "baubles."
If you were American, you would know that.
But the fact is, it's only Romanians that pronounce it "burbles."
And that's why it's difficult for you, isn't it...
...Mrs. Vladimir Tserijemiwtz?
I told you we would not get away with it!
I told you it was stupid idea!
I told you I could not say "baubles."
You are pretty fast on your tippy-toes, Mr. Pockinbush.
But not quite tippy-toe enough.
Yes, Mr. Peckinpaugh...
...it's very clever how you figured out that I am Vladimir...
It's been so long,
I forgot how to pronounce it.
How's it go?
Tserijemiwtz.
Permit me to introduce my oversexed wife.
The former Nadia Gladdia Poppenescu.
Nice to meet you.
Anytime, anywhere.
Perhaps you've guessed...
...that the Albanian diamond eggs were stolen from my safe last night.
Up.
Since you're the only man who can recognize me...
...I must sadly bring this meeting and your life to a close.
Goodbye-chik.
So long-ski.
Knocking me off isn't gonna find out who took your diamonds.
I already know who took the diamonds.
I killed the fat woman in Paris and stole the diamonds.
But I had a partner.
So we came to an arrangement.
I got to keep the diamonds...
...and he got to keep a bullet from me in his chest.
I always heard you Romanians were hotheaded.
It's just the Gypsy in our soul.
Unfortunately, he did not die.
I left him bleeding on the rug...
...vowing that he would get even with me one day.
But that was 10 years ago.
He can't last much longer.
But then again, neither can you.
Toodle-looski.
Gotcha!
No, I think they got you.
Look at that hole.
Oh, boy!
Behind the drape-ski!
He's quite a guy.
Been bleeding for 10 years and still quick as a rabbit.
I'll get that. That's for me.
Revolting.
Get something and cover him up.
Yes, angel.
No, I'm fine.
Everything went like clockwork.
It was the word "burbles" that tripped her up, like we figured.
What's that?
When?
I'm on my way now.
If you're smart, you'll stay out of this mess.
The police have nothing they can pin on you.
Maybe when this is all over...
...you can come back and teach me how to say "burbles."
You just keep your door unlocked.
A man's dying to see you. I mean, a man who's dying wants to see you.
Well, get him in here, fast.
Mr. Peckinpaugh will see you now.
- Is he...
- Dead?
He should've been 10 years ago.
Sorry about this, Marcel.
Where did he plug you?
It's been so long, I forget.
Whiskey.
Jesus!
Anyone else would've been dead in two days from a wound like that.
How did you stay alive for 10 years?
I cut out all salt and spicy dishes.
But I'm afraid this is it, my friend.
Thanks for this afternoon.
You are never gonna believe what happened to me.
You made it. Good girl.
If I was, I never would've gotten the papers.
You and that pig Schlissel...?
- You sent me there. It was terrible.
- Don't tell me what he did.
- We played war.
- I don't wanna hear it.
He was a dive-bomber and
I was Poland.
Forget it, I said.
I pretended I was asleep, and in the middle of the night, I heard...
...these big bombers overhead.
Why do you dames love to tell me these things? Keep it to yourself.
Hand over the papers.
Marcel's about to check out.
I don't have them.
When I left Schlissel's, the punk that works for Blubber grabbed me.
I warned you about him.
Didn't I warn you about him?
He drove me out to the country, then made me get out of the car.
I don't wanna hear!
He put me in the headlights and made me dance the carioca.
They know it gets to me. That's why they all torture me this way.
No papers, no diamonds!
That was our deal, monsieur.
Hold it! Maybe that's Blubber.
We can still make a deal.
I got the goods with me now.
Shall we say my place in 30 minutes?
Make sure that punk kid is there.
I got a score to settle with him.
I heard about the carioca.
And the what?
He did what?
I'm hanging up.
I'll need the goods, Marcel.
You're gonna just have to trust me.
Don't be stubborn, you crazy
Frenchman. Time is on their side.
I don't think he's being stubborn.
I think he's being dead.
Just once I'd like to see somebody die regular on this case.
Call Lt. DiMaggio.
Tell him where I'll be...
...but not to make a move until he gets my signal.
This could be the wrap-up.
And the kiss-off for me, is that it?
I don't know.
Tell me nothing happened.
Even if you lie, I'll believe you.
Nothing happened.
Jesus, it sounds worse than before.
Thirty-five cents.
How'd you like to make some real dough?
I say we kill him the moment he comes in with the bundle.
You'd like that, wouldn't you, you greasy imbecile?
I want no part of this.
I just want my money so I can get my hair done.
Somebody's coming up the stairs.
I was told to deliver this to Mr. Peckinpaugh.
I'll take that, son.
Keep your hands up, everybody.
Okay, cabbie, put the package on the table...
...along with my change.
Punk, throw your bed on the gun.
- Gun on the bed.
- What?
You said, "Throw your bed on the gun."
Big deal. That's only the first mistake I made on this case.
That's not bad, considering how complicated it is.
Go ahead, throw it.
You feel a little naked now, punk?
Now we'll see how tough you are.
Like to slap women around, don't you?
Well, now we're gonna find out how you react to a little of the same.
Slap yourself in the face.
It's either that or I use the business end of this gun.
Now slap yourself.
You call that a slap?
That's a love tap.
Now give it to yourself good.
Go on.
Harder.
Harder.
He's had enough!
Does anybody else want more of the same?
By Gad, sir, you are an extraordinary man.
However, if you've had your fill of revenge...
...perhaps we can get down to the important business of cracking eggs.
Not so fast, chubbikens.
There's a little matter of DuChard's lease and liquor license.
Slowly!
Give it to the girl.
Miss Shearer.
Who?
Norma Shearer.
Well, you told me to change it.
All right, give it here.
Now get back there with your pals.
Well, everything seems to be in order.
All right, folks, the bundle is all yours.
Sixteen years.
A quarter of a lifetime...
...I've waited for this moment.
I'll be able to buy everything
I ever wanted and never had:
Friends, a mother.
I want to be young forever.
And money can make you young and fresh and beautiful.
Hurry!
Open the package quickly.
I want to look good tonight.
You and your fat fingers!
Let me do it.
Bite the string off, you idiot!
Chew it! Eat it!
Lick it off! Anything!
Open it. Open it!
Quickly, before the stores close.
The Treasure of Tibet.
One-twelfth of all the wealth...
...of Ancient China.
The diamonds.
I want to see the diamonds. Here...
...open it.
Chickies!
Sixteen years I wasted on...
...little....
Chicklets?
Chicklets?
What can I buy with chicklets?
It's all your fault!
Take all your little chickies, lard-ass!
Duped! Sixteen years down the toilet.
Sorry, folks, but I'm sending you over.
Come on in, boys.
They're all yours, Frank.
And what is the charge, may I ask?
The murder of Floyd Merkle and five unimportant people.
Sorry, Frank, but nobody here killed nobody.
The most you got on them is a chicken-stealing charge.
Then who did kill Merkle and the others?
All in good time, Frank.
All in good time.
Now get them out of here.
You're an astounding man,
Mr. Peckinpaugh.
Also, unfortunately, a pain in the ass.
I don't mind, really.
As long as we can be together.
I never really had a best friend.
You lousy shamus.
What about Miss What's-her-name?
Put her on the ferry.
But, Lou, I thought you and I had....
Sorry, but I got a date in 20 minutes.
And this time I'm gonna keep it.
Two minutes to midnight.
I'm a brave man, but I'm getting panicky.
He'll be here, Paul. He promised me.
You went to his apartment that night, didn't you?
I'm sorry, Paul.
How long have you known that Louis and I are lovers?
I didn't know until you told me just now.
I thought you were looking for me.
Yes, that's why I went there.
I made up the part about us being lovers...
...because I know you don't like me looking for you.
We can still make it if you hurry.
Schnell! Schnell!
Not you, Schnell.
I said "faster" in German.
- I understand.
- One minute to midnight. Schnell!
English! We speak only English from now on. No more German.
- We'll never make it. Quicker!
- Yes, sir?
Not you, Quicker!
Forget it! It's a waste of time.
They're leaving! Leaving without us!
That's only the first warning.
You must calm yourself.
Yes, yes. I'm sorry.
I'm really wonderful in a war. I only get nervous when I'm late for things.
Sorry I'm late, but I had some odds and ends I had to clean up.
Oh, yes. It's quite all right.
Marlene got a little hysterical, but I calmed her down.
You have the papers?
I said I'd keep my word.
And I shall keep mine.
How can I ever repay you, monsieur?
I have so little.
What can I possibly give you in return?
How about your wife?
No, she has nothing either.
Paul, there's something I think
I should tell you.
Can't you tell me on the ship, darling?
Maybe you two wanna be alone?
No. This is something that concerns us all.
There's nothing in the world I would want to do less than hurt you.
No one has ever been more kind and more generous to me than you've been.
But Louis is the only man
I've ever loved.
I can't go with you.
I'm going off with Louis.
Now.
Tonight.
Forever.
I'm not getting the papers?
You're getting the papers.
You're just not getting me.
- But am I getting the papers?
- I said you were.
You scared me. I thought
I wasn't getting the papers.
They seem to mean more to you than I do.
No, but you have Louis.
It's only fair that I get the papers.
I don't wanna be the cause of a family quarrel.
Just give him the goddamn papers.
That's the last warning.
I really must leave.
Here you go.
You're quite a guy, Frenchy.
Thank you.
Take good care of her.
Now, darling...
...no tears.
No sad faces, no remorse...
...no regrets.
We danced as long as the music played.
You belong to him now.
But you will always be a special part of...
Do I have carbon copies of this?
It's all in there.
Stop where you are.
Jesus! This case never lets up.
You're coming back to Germany.
I promise you, you will be given a fair trial and found guilty.
Run, Paul!
I had a hunch you'd follow me.
Did you get the others?
They're in the van.
The whole place is surrounded.
Every man's got a shotgun.
You won't need them, Frank.
I'll handle this.
It's all over.
You can come out now.
Hi, Lou.
Mad at me?
It was the girl I was trying to shoot.
- You know how jealous I get.
- I know, kid.
That's why I killed Floyd.
He spent more time with you than I did.
That's the way it goes.
I'm sorry about killing all those others at the hotel.
I must have been irritable.
You should've taken aspirin instead.
- It's still you and me, isn't it?
- We'll talk about it.
With a good lawyer,
I'd be out in 40 years.
I'll watch my weight.
I could still be desirable.
I'm betting on you, kid.
Nice night for a boat ride.
You got yourself one hell of a guy there, lady.
If you wanna hold on to him, don't burn his bacon.
It breaks your heart.
- See you around?
- Who knows? It's a funny business.
Bye.
Oh, Louis, we're together.
And it's going to be just the way it was, darling.
No, angel, it's gonna be better.
I brought the car around like you told me to.
Good boy, Hoppy.
Sweetheart...
...I'd like you to meet the girls.
My secretary, Bess, you've already met.
Hello again.
This is Betty DeBoop, a lot of laughs.
Hiya, kid.
Nadia Gladdia Poppenescu, a little kinky but nice.
You bet you.
And of course, Mrs...?
Stanwyck. Barbara Stanwyck.
Hello, girls.
All right, Hoppy, let's get out of here.
{9806}{9898}- Your ticket, please.|- Oh, yes.
{9902}{9970}- Welcome aboard, Miss Debenham.|- Thank you.
{9974}{10066}{y:i}Bosporus Ferry will shortly depart|{y:i}from Istanbul Sirkeci Station,
{10070}{10175}{y:i}connecting with the Orient Express.
{10214}{10258}Here's your ticket,|Monsieur Poirot.
{10262}{10306}I'm afraid you've still got another hour.
{10310}{10330}Well, then, please do not wait.
{10334}{10463}Not wait? After all you've|done for us, Monsieur Poirot?
{10478}{10545}My general's orders were to|ensure your safe departure.
{10549}{10569}He also wished me|to thank you again
{10573}{10665}for saving the honor of the British|garrison in Jordan.
{10669}{10737}The brigadier's confession|was opportune.
{10741}{10785}I say, how did you do it?
{10789}{10881}Was it the old thumbscrew,|you know, the rack?
{10885}{11001}Yes. Well, you'll be able to rest|as soon as you get to Stamboul.
{11005}{11049}The...
{11053}{11145}The church of Santa Sofia|is absolutely magnificent.
{11149}{11193}You have seen it?
{11197}{11249}No.
{11293}{11352}Come on.
{11365}{11433}Move. Come on.
{11437}{11508}Get up. Come on.
{11532}{11594}Chop-chop.
{11772}{11840}I hope we did the right thing booking|you into a hotel on the European side
{11844}{11888}rather than the Asian side.
{11892}{12005}I have no prejudice against|either continent.
{12036}{12104}The... The crossing|should be pleasant.
{12108}{12196}The Bosporus is always calm.
{12204}{12272}You have crossed by the ferry?
{12276}{12328}No.
{12563}{12631}Welcome, Colonel Arbu...
{12635}{12703}Arbu... Arbut...
{12707}{12771}Arbuthnott.
{12827}{12943}{y:i}The Bosporus Ferry will shortly|{y:i}depart for Istanbul Sirkeci Station,
{12947}{13052}{y:i}connecting with the Orient Express.
{13211}{13255}Not now.
{13259}{13386}Not now. When it's all over.|When it's behind us. Then.
{13498}{13542}What a funny little man.
{13546}{13618}Obviously a frog.
{15369}{15437}It can be important.
{15441}{15532}...between East and West, where you|can eat the finest Oriental food.
{15536}{15628}Good evening, sir.|This way, please.
{15632}{15723}{y:i}Ecco finalmente un amico.
{15728}{15799}Monsieur Poirot.
{15824}{15868}Bianchi.
{15872}{15953}How are you, my friend?
{15968}{16036}- Good to see you.|- You have saved me from apoplexy.
{16040}{16084}- Sit down.|- Thank you.
{16088}{16156}You have not dined well.
{16160}{16252}The skewers are of better quality|than the kebab.
{16256}{16300}The bottle is more|distinguished than its wine.
{16304}{16374}And the coffee.
{16400}{16468}Fortunately, I have been called|to London. I leave tonight.
{16472}{16515}- On the {y:i}Orient Express?|- How else?
{16519}{16635}{y:i}Evviva! I have a traveling companion.|{y:i}Eccellente.
{16639}{16724}Well, where shall we dine?
{17023}{17067}I am desolate, Monsieur Poirot.
{17071}{17163}There is not one single first-class|sleeping berth on the entire train.
{17167}{17259}- What? In December?|- In December, signor.
{17263}{17307}Has Bulgaria declared war on Turkey?
{17311}{17379}Are the aristocracy fleeing|the country?
{17383}{17403}I am a director of the line,
{17407}{17451}Monsieur Hercule Poirot|is not only a detective
{17455}{17522}of international fame and distinction,|but he is also my personal friend.
{17526}{17594}Signor Bianchi, Monsieur Poirot...
{17598}{17642}Courage, my friend,|we'll arrange something.
{17646}{17743}{y:i}Andiamo!|We must go. Come on.
{18725}{18841}{y:i}The Orient Express {y:i}will depart|{y:i}from platform one at 9 p. M.

{19972}{20016}{y:i}Bonsoir, Pierre.

{23041}{23085}{y:i}Grazie, Pierre. I understand|that you are full up.
{23089}{23181}It's unbelievable, signor.|All the world elects to travel tonight.
{23185}{23301}Nonetheless, you must find room|for Monsieur Poirot here.
{23305}{23349}Monsieur Hercule Poirot?
{23353}{23397}- The famous...|- Precisely.
{23401}{23445}And he is also a personal|friend of mine.
{23449}{23544}Please be so good as to direct...
{23568}{23636}{y:i}Fröken Ohlsson, god afton!|{y:i}Plats nummer sju.
{23640}{23704}{y:i}Sju...
{23880}{23924}Something is lost?
{23928}{23996}My little medal of St. Christopher,
{24000}{24044}to bring me luck and deliver...
{24048}{24126}Deliver me from evil.
{24144}{24164}Madame. Madame, lucky tooth|from St. Augustine of Hippo.
{24168}{24212}Madame. Madame, lucky tooth|from St. Augustine of Hippo.
{24216}{24332}- Lucky Buddha, madame?|- Madame, lucky Buddha.
{24384}{24428}Thank God, my St. Christopher.
{24432}{24503}St. Christopher.
{25079}{25123}You see, my friend has been|urgently called to London
{25127}{25171}on a matter of|international importance,
{25175}{25219}and I have given him my|personal assurance
{25223}{25291}that you will secure an accommodation|for him on the coach to Calais.
{25295}{25363}- But, Signor Bianchi, I have already...|- Hector...
{25367}{25459}Excuse me, excuse me, gentlemen,|but Mr. Ratchett has reservations,
{25463}{25554}and we'd be grateful if we could|board immediately.
{25558}{25602}Mr. Ratchett.
{25606}{25650}Welcome to the number ten.
{25654}{25722}Mr. Beddoes, the lower berth|in number one.
{25726}{25818}Mr. McQueen, the lower berth|in number four.
{25822}{25925}- The upper berth is...|- As arranged.
{25966}{25986}Now, Pierre, it is cold.
{25990}{26058}Now we can place Monsieur|Poirot in the number 16,
{26062}{26082}which is always kept vacant.
{26086}{26178}It is taken, signor, by a Mr. Hardman.
{26182}{26202}Then as a director of the line,
{26206}{26274}I command you to place|Monsieur Poirot
{26278}{26370}in what we know to be the empty berth|above Mr. McQueen's number four.
{26374}{26435}Monsieur.
{26470}{26561}At least you can get two tips.
{26877}{26965}- Pardon, monsieur.|- Sorry.
{26997}{27088}- Pardon.|- Excuse me, signor.
{27429}{27520}Well, my second husband,|Mr. Hubbard, would have raised hell.
{27524}{27592}No place for my makeup bag,|no ice in my drinking water,
{27596}{27664}and the hot water burps as it|comes out of the faucet.
{27668}{27726}Pardon.
{27884}{28000}Have courage, my friend.|It is the last compartment but one.
{28004}{28062}Pardon.
{28268}{28288}No.
{28292}{28377}I think there's a mistake.
{28388}{28432}{y:i}Je crois que vous avez|{y:i}fait une erreur.
{28436}{28479}Mr. McQueen, there is no|other berth on the train.
{28483}{28527}Monsieur Poirot has to come in here.
{28531}{28575}Voilà, monsieur, all is arranged.
{28579}{28623}Yours is the upper berth,|the number four.
{28627}{28671}We start in one minute.
{28675}{28719}I apologize if I have|incommoded you here.
{28723}{28791}However, it is for one|night only at Belgrade Station.
{28795}{28919}Oh, I see. At Belgrade,|you're... You're getting off.
{32607}{32627}Better than the hotel?
{32631}{32744}I shall probably keep|the menu as a souvenir.
{32751}{32867}Hector, I ordered three Islamic|13th-century, perforated pottery bowls
{32871}{32915}and six beakers.
{32919}{33011}They delivered only five beakers,|and one of the bowls arrived chipped,
{33015}{33059}which it was not when I paid for it.
{33063}{33083}Through the nose.
{33087}{33203}- Send a telegram from Belgrade.|- Yes. Yes, Mr. Ratchett.
{33207}{33251}What's the matter? You look tired.
{33255}{33345}- I slept badly.|- Yeah, why?
{33375}{33443}The Belgian in the upper berth snored.
{33447}{33560}Really? Any other|unanswered letters on file?
{33566}{33634}Only the anonymous ones.
{33638}{33706}We can't answer those, can we?
{33710}{33778}You'd better go catch up|on your sleep...
{33782}{33898}...before the Belgian gentleman|gets back to your compartment.
{33902}{33959}Go on.
{34645}{34713}Hi. My name's Hardman.
{34717}{34737}Call me Dick.
{34741}{34849}- Foscarelli. Call me Gino.|- How are you?
{34861}{34920}Beddoes.
{34933}{34998}Mr. Beddoes.
{35053}{35097}For the pen of a Balzac.
{35101}{35169}For three days, all these people,|these total strangers,
{35173}{35306}meet in a single train whose|engine controls their destiny.
{35341}{35433}Yes, I know. We are both|envious of the husband.
{35437}{35480}Is...?
{35484}{35552}Is the husband as British|as his tweeds?
{35556}{35600}Oh, heaven forbid.|He's a hot-blooded Hungarian.
{35604}{35672}If you but look at his wife,|he will cease to be a diplomat.
{35676}{35763}Thank God we are not young.
{36036}{36080}My second husband said|always to ask for change in dollars
{36084}{36128}or at worst, sterling.
{36132}{36176}So for Pete's sake,|what's a drachma?
{36180}{36272}It is... What do you call it...?|The currency...
{36276}{36344}My second husband also said,|"Take a book of food tickets, Mama,
{36348}{36392}"and you'll have no problem,|no problem at all."
{36396}{36416}That just isn't so.
{36420}{36463}First there's this ten-percent tip. Five|would've done the steward more...
{36467}{36511}I think Miss Ohlsson has a headache.
{36515}{36583}Would you forgive us if we went back|to the compartment, Mrs. Hubbard?
{36587}{36607}Gladly, if you must.
{36611}{36679}If you need aspirin,|I always carry it on my person.
{36683}{36727}I mistrust foreign drugs.
{36731}{36842}You must excuse me,|Mrs. Hubbard is upon us.
{36851}{36895}What's the matter with him?|Train-sick or something?
{36899}{37049}Some of us, in the words of the divine|Greta Garbo, "want to be alone".
{37259}{37327}And for dinner this evening?
{37331}{37399}You will have the goodness|to serve me the poached sole
{37403}{37447}with one new potato
{37451}{37566}and a small green salad|with no dressing. Hildegarde.
{37570}{37614}Who was that majestic lady?
{37618}{37728}- The Princess Dragomiroff.|- I have heard.
{38146}{38166}Pardon me, sir.
{38170}{38238}I wonder if you could|oblige me with a light.
{38242}{38286}Certainly.
{38290}{38334}Thank you.|My name is Ratchett.
{38338}{38430}Do I have the pleasure of speaking|to Mr. Hercule Poirot?
{38434}{38477}The pleasure possibly, Mr. Ratchett,|the intention certainly.
{38481}{38525}You asked me for a light.
{38529}{38597}I offered you one,|and you have not used it.
{38601}{38693}One can deduce that without|acute mental exhaustion.
{38697}{38741}That's wonderful. Sit down, sir.
{38745}{38789}- For a moment.|- Just for a moment.
{38793}{38861}Thank you very much.
{38865}{38909}Well, Mr. Poirot.
{38913}{38957}- Poirot.|- How's that?
{38961}{39029}- Poirot.|- Oh, Poirot. Right.
{39033}{39187}I just wanted to say that in my country|we also come quickly to the point.
{39249}{39341}I want you to take a job on for me.
{39345}{39389}It means big money.
{39393}{39437}Very big money.
{39441}{39532}What is the case, or, as you put it, the|job which you wish me to undertake?
{39536}{39623}Mr. Poirot, I'm a rich man.
{39632}{39724}Naturally, men in my|position have enemies.
{39728}{39772}Only one.
{39776}{39820}Now, what the hell|do you mean by that?
{39824}{39892}Merely that when a man is in a position|to have, as you say, enemies,
{39896}{40023}it does not usually resolve|itself into one enemy only.
{40040}{40108}Oh. Oh, sure. Sure. I appreciate that.
{40112}{40180}What is your profession?
{40184}{40228}I'm retired.
{40232}{40300}- From what?|- Business.
{40304}{40348}What sort of business?
{40352}{40396}Baby food.
{40400}{40467}But what does that matter?|What matters is my safety.
{40471}{40491}You are in danger?
{40495}{40563}My life has been threatened,|Mr. Poirot.
{40567}{40681}My secretary can show|you two letters on file.
{40687}{40774}And I... can show you this.
{40855}{40923}I sleep on it.
{40927}{40994}Mr. Poirot...
{41023}{41091}...5,000 dollars.
{41095}{41139}No?
{41143}{41210}Ten thousand?
{41215}{41259}Fifteen thousand.
{41263}{41307}Mr. Ratchett, I have|made enough money
{41311}{41403}to satisfy both my needs|and my caprices.
{41407}{41451}I take only such cases now|as interest me,
{41455}{41586}and to be frank, my interest|in your case is... dwindling.
{42749}{42793}{y:i}Belgrade Station.
{42797}{42934}{y:i}The Orient Express {y:i}will|{y:i}depart in five minutes.
{43013}{43033}Monsieur Poirot.
{43037}{43105}I am transferring Signor Bianchi's|luggage to the Pullman.
{43109}{43153}He's giving you|his own compartment.
{43157}{43201}But you cannot sit up all night.
{43205}{43273}My dear friend,|do not concern yourself.
{43277}{43321}Since you are going to England,|it is better for you
{43325}{43369}to stay on the through coach|to Calais.
{43373}{43417}Now, Pierre has made me|very comfortable.
{43421}{43488}There is no one in the Pullman|but one Greek doctor. {y:i}Ecco.
{43492}{43622}- Such generosity deserves my thanks.|- {y:i}Buon riposa.
{44284}{44304}- Monsieur Poirot.|- Pierre,
{44308}{44400}- could I have some clean towels and...|- Yes, monsieur.
{44404}{44448}Who are my new neighbors?
{44452}{44519}To the left, monsieur,|the Swedish lady, Miss Ohlsson,
{44523}{44591}shares seven and eight with|the English lady, Miss Debenham.
{44595}{44663}And to the right, in number ten,|is Mr. Ratchett.
{44667}{44711}And where is the loquacious|Mrs. Hubbard?
{44715}{44759}I should like to get some|sleep tonight.
{44763}{44807}Beyond Mr. Ratchett,|in the number 11.
{44811}{44855}She is still too near.
{44859}{44927}Good night, Mr. Beddoes.
{44931}{44989}Pardon.
{45123}{45143}Who is it?
{45147}{45255}It's me, sir, Beddoes,|with your sedative.
{45291}{45350}Come in.
{45435}{45478}Thank you, Pierre. Good night.
{45482}{45612}Good night, monsieur,|and pleasant dreams in number nine.
{45626}{45694}- How many drops?|- Of the valerian?
{45698}{45789}- Two, sir, as you said.|- OK.
{45818}{45906}No, no. Put it on the table.
{46010}{46078}And tell Mr. McQueen I want|to see the text of the telegram
{46082}{46162}he sent from Belgrade.
{46202}{46272}Very well, sir.
{46489}{46556}He wants you.
{47305}{47364}Come in.
{48096}{48177}{y:i}La belle Comtesse.
{49606}{49720}{y:i}Ce n'est rien.|{y:i}C'était un cauchemar.
{49726}{49857}{y:i}Bien, Mr. Ratchett.|May you now have pleasant dreams.
{50206}{50297}{y:i}C'est le silence de mort.
{50685}{50788}Snowdrift. {y:i}Mon Dieu. Quelle nuit.
{50877}{50921}So now there's a man in my room.
{50925}{50945}I woke up in the dark|three minutes ago,
{50949}{51017}and there was a man hiding|in this compartment. I sensed it.
{51021}{51065}What's more, I know who he was|because I absent-mindedly
{51069}{51137}nearly walked through|his open door earlier this evening.
{51141}{51161}"Madame," said this Mr. Ratchett,
{51165}{51233}"If you'd done this 20 years ago,|I'd have said come in."
{51237}{51329}Twenty years ago?|Why, I'd only have been 15.
{51333}{51477}If there should be a reoccurrence,|do not hesitate to ring, madame.
{51572}{51659}{y:i}Enfin c'est le comble.
{52076}{52183}{y:i}Evidemment, j'ai une crise de nerfs.
{52747}{52858}It's me, sir, Beddoes,|with your pick-me-up.
{52963}{53054}Your amber moon, Mr. Ratchett.
{53443}{53510}Your passkey.
{53610}{53672}The chain.
{53850}{53930}Pierre, touch nothing.
{53994}{54062}Where are Signor Bianchi|and the Greek doctor?
{54066}{54110}In the dining car, monsieur.
{54114}{54189}Fetch them at once.
{54641}{54661}Well, can't you tap|the telephone wires?
{54665}{54733}- Or fire a rocket, or something?|- This is not a ship, madame.
{54737}{54805}- Where exactly are we?|- We are between Vinkovci and Brod.
{54809}{54853}- But in what country?|- In Yugoslavia.
{54857}{54925}The Balkans.|What else can you expect?
{54929}{54997}Snow is God's will.|And all is for the best.
{55001}{55069}Yeah, but how long do you think before|we can start getting out of here?
{55073}{55117}As soon as the stationmaster|at Brod sees
{55121}{55235}that we do not arrive on time,|he will send...
{55241}{55333}Dr. Constantine,|Monsieur Poirot wants to see you.
{55337}{55381}And you too, Signor Bianchi.
{55385}{55429}Forgive me, ladies and gentlemen.
{55433}{55524}Only God's forgiveness is important.
{55528}{55654}{y:i}Ich mochte meine Prinzessin|{y:i}benachrichtigen.
{55696}{55740}Signor Bianchi|and Dr. Constantine.
{55744}{55839}Mind the broken glass, gentlemen.
{55912}{56004}Pupils still slightly dilated.|Could've been drugged.
{56008}{56095}- Was drugged.|- With what?
{56128}{56196}There's a smell of valerian,|which is harmless,
{56200}{56244}but something must've been added.
{56248}{56364}- May I close his eyes now?|- I wish you would.
{56392}{56483}Why did he lose so much blood?
{56487}{56605}- Can I pull back the bedclothes?|- By all means.
{56679}{56771}Mr. Ratchett has been|frontally stabbed
{56775}{56843}ten, 11, 12 times.
{56847}{56891}- Oh, {y:i}Dio.|- {y:i}Mon pauvre.
{56895}{56963}If you must go whoop-whoop,|please go whoop-whoop
{56967}{57087}not to windward, but to leeward.|Help him, Pierre.
{57111}{57155}There is something in the pocket.
{57159}{57221}Permit me.
{57351}{57419}- His watch.|- The time of death.
{57423}{57466}I can definitely say|that death occurred
{57470}{57514}between midnight|and 2 in the morning.
{57518}{57586}That would fit.
{57590}{57743}I myself heard him cry out and ring for|the conductor at 20 minutes to 1.
{57758}{57802}When Pierre arrived, he apologized
{57806}{57874}and said he had been|having a {y:i}cauchemar.
{57878}{57943}A nightmare.
{57998}{58096}Then I heard him|use his washbasin.
{58118}{58213}And that is the last thing known.
{58286}{58354}I beg of you, monsieur.|You cannot refuse.
{58358}{58426}But it is the duty|of the Yugoslavian police.
{58430}{58545}Oh, what, monsieur, to question|my passengers on my line? Never.
{58549}{58617}Now you must solve the mystery.
{58621}{58689}When we get to Brod, if we ever do,
{58693}{58761}we present the police with|a {y:i}fait accompli.
{58765}{58881}We say that a murder has occurred.|There is the criminal.
{58885}{58929}I should like|the Pullman coach reserved
{58933}{58977}for the investigation's headquarters.
{58981}{59025}It will be at your disposal.
{59029}{59097}And a plan of the Calais coach|with the names and locations
{59101}{59145}- of all the people in it.|- Yes, it will be there.
{59149}{59193}And the passports of all|the passengers concerned.
{59197}{59217}Yes, you can even have mine.
{59221}{59313}I go to make a special|announcement now. {y:i}Grazie.
{59317}{59361}Bring all the passports|to Monsieur Poirot.
{59365}{59409}Are there any other|passengers on the train?
{59413}{59542}In the Pullman coach,|nobody but myself and Mr. Bianchi.
{59700}{59744}{y:i}Alors.
{59748}{59816}Then we must concentrate|on the Calais coach.
{59820}{59951}Where, in my amateur opinion,|the murderer is with us now.
{60012}{60104}Ladies and gentlemen.|Please, please, patience.
{60108}{60152}You must have patience.|Now, you will all get the chance
{60156}{60248}to state your views to Monsieur Poirot|at his own good time.
{60252}{60320}- Now, please...|- It is not good time. It is bad time.
{60324}{60416}God's laws have been bust,|thou shalt not kill.
{60420}{60487}And why was I not notified at once,|Signor... Mr. Bianchi?
{60491}{60635}- I was his nearest associate.|- And I was nearest to his murderer.
{60659}{60727}You mean you saw the man?|You can identify the murderer?
{60731}{60775}I mean nothing of the kind.
{60779}{60847}I mean there was a man|in my compartment last night.
{60851}{60919}It was pitch-dark, of course,|and my eyes were closed in terror.
{60923}{60991}Then how did you know it was a man?
{60995}{61087}Because I've enjoyed very warm|relationships with both my husbands.
{61091}{61183}- With your eyes closed?|- That helped.
{61187}{61231}- Excuse me.|- Anyway, the man smelt of tobacco.
{61235}{61279}Mr. McQueen,|Monsieur Poirot would be grateful
{61283}{61375}for a few minutes of your time.
{61379}{61423}- Excuse me.|- Don't you agree the man
{61427}{61494}must've entered my compartment|to gain access to Mr. Ratchett?
{61498}{61590}I can think of no other reason,|madame.
{61594}{61662}Pierre, your passkey.
{61666}{61710}{y:i}Voilà, monsieur.
{61714}{61830}And will you discreetly procure|me a lady's hatbox,
{61834}{61878}one of the big, old-fashioned kind,
{61882}{61995}perhaps from the|Princess Dragomiroff's maid?
{62002}{62046}Give me five minutes, doctor.
{62050}{62094}Mr. McQueen, I regret|to have kept you waiting,
{62098}{62190}but there has been much to establish.
{62194}{62262}Please be seated. Now,|Mr. McQueen, I should be grateful
{62266}{62334}for anything you can usefully tell me.|What, for example, is...?
{62338}{62406}Let's get just a couple|of things straight first, Mr. Poirot.
{62410}{62501}Who, for example, are you,|and what is your status here?
{62505}{62549}Excuse me.
{62553}{62597}Monsieur Poirot is a detective,
{62601}{62669}officially delegated to investigate|this case by me.
{62673}{62765}Let us proceed with the matter in|hand. Your relationship with Ratchett?
{62769}{62789}I'm his... I was his secretary.
{62793}{62837}- For how long?|- A year, give or take.
{62841}{62909}- Where did you meet?|- In Persia.
{62913}{63005}He was collecting Gorgan pottery|with considerable success.
{63009}{63053}And I was trying to collect oil|concessions, you know,
{63057}{63101}with so little success|that I went bankrupt,
{63105}{63149}and he offered me the job. I took it.
{63153}{63245}- And since then?|- Well, we've traveled around.
{63249}{63293}He was hampered|by not knowing any languages.
{63297}{63341}I acted more as his courier|than as his secretary.
{63345}{63389}It was a pleasant enough job.
{63393}{63484}What part of America|did Ratchett come from?
{63488}{63508}I don't know.
{63512}{63604}The fact is, he never talked|about his background.
{63608}{63700}- Why, do you think?|- Well, I used to...
{63704}{63772}Well, I began to believe|that he had left America
{63776}{63796}to escape something, you know.
{63800}{63892}Or someone. And until a couple|of weeks ago, I think he succeeded.
{63896}{63940}And then?
{63944}{64012}Well, he began to get these|anonymous letters,
{64016}{64110}threatening letters, like these.
{64136}{64208}"I kill killers."
{64256}{64324}"Prepare to die."
{64328}{64396}- How brief.|- But in a sense, how complicated.
{64400}{64539}Last night, I noticed you dispatching|a telegram from Belgrade Station.
{64543}{64587}That's right.|Let's see, he sent for me
{64591}{64659}to see the text|right after we left Belgrade.
{64663}{64755}And then he went...|Yeah, it was the last I ever saw of him.
{64759}{64827}Were there any other|threatening letters?
{64831}{64875}Yeah, but none that|I was allowed to read.
{64879}{64947}He used to... He used to burn them.
{64951}{64971}That explains...
{64975}{65030}What?
{65071}{65153}My interest in hatboxes.
{65215}{65297}Precisely what I needed.
{65335}{65379}Doctor, first the wounds.
{65383}{65450}- You counted a dozen?|- Yes.
{65454}{65561}Five are deep,|of which three are lethal.
{65622}{65690}The rest are shallow.
{65694}{65738}And two...
{65742}{65834}...are so slight as to be|mere scratches.
{65838}{65882}What does that suggest?
{65886}{66019}That there were two murderers,|a strong man and a weak man?
{66030}{66098}Or a weak woman.
{66102}{66218}Or a strong man stabbing|the victim both strongly
{66222}{66314}and weakly in order to confuse us.
{66318}{66410}At least we know that|by the time of the murder,
{66414}{66554}Ratchett was too drugged to cry out|or defend himself with this.
{66581}{66625}But how did you guess...?
{66629}{66721}I didn't. He showed it to me|when he offered me $15,000
{66725}{66769}to be his bodyguard and I refused.
{66773}{66857}Ought I to have accepted?
{67013}{67105}Now, let us consider the ashtray.
{67109}{67177}Two different matches.
{67181}{67225}A smoked cigar.
{67229}{67322}- A pipe cleaner...|- And this.
{67397}{67464}- The initial H.|- That should not be hard to identify.
{67468}{67536}I wonder, Christian name or surname?
{67540}{67632}We must wait until|we examine the passports.
{67636}{67680}Bianchi, doctor,
{67684}{67827}has it occurred to you that there|are too many clues in this room?
{67900}{68040}Let us proceed by examining what|I hope will prove to be the last of them.
{68044}{68115}The burnt paper.
{68236}{68304}I use it for the mustaches.
{68308}{68328}What has that to do|with mustaches?
{68332}{68403}To melt the wax.
{69003}{69095}Observe, memorize,|you are my only witnesses.
{69099}{69206}- A-l-S-Y A-R-M-S.|- What does that mean?
{69243}{69364}It means we know|the true identity of Mr. Ratchett.
{69411}{69505}And why he had to leave America.
{69602}{69670}Do you remember|the Armstrong case?
{69674}{69826}Of course, the kidnapping of that|little American girl, and the killing.
{69842}{69862}Who does not?
{69866}{69934}Do you remember the name|of the child?
{69938}{70006}{y:i}Certamente. It was Daisy.
{70010}{70054}D.
{70058}{70102}D-A
{70106}{70163}l-S-Y.
{70202}{70272}Space, A-R-M-S.
{70322}{70393}Daisy Armstrong.
{70418}{70485}- And Ratchett was her murderer?|- Well, no, the actual murderer
{70489}{70557}was tried, sentenced|and electrocuted.
{70561}{70629}But he was only the number two.
{70633}{70725}The subordinate of a boss whom,|at first, he was too terrified to identify.
{70729}{70797}Only on the eve of his electrocution|did he give the name of the boss,
{70801}{70893}who by then had disappeared|with the ransom money.
{70897}{70965}I remember feeling ashamed|that he had an Italian name.
{70969}{71013}Cassetti.
{71017}{71109}{y:i}Che mostro. He had|a child's blood on his hands.
{71113}{71181}He had worse than that.
{71185}{71253}After the shock|of the body's discovery,
{71257}{71373}Mrs. Armstrong gave premature birth|to a stillborn child,
{71377}{71444}and herself died in the process.
{71448}{71492}Her husband, Colonel Armstrong,
{71496}{71564}once a brave officer in|the Scots Guard, shot himself,
{71568}{71636}and Mrs. Armstrong's personal maid,
{71640}{71732}who came wrongly|under suspicion of complicity,
{71736}{71780}threw herself from her|bedroom window and she died,
{71784}{71852}so five deaths, five.
{71856}{71972}Then I thank heaven that Giuseppe,|who spilt so much blood in his lifetime,
{71976}{72076}should have his own blood|spilt now.
{72384}{72475}Excellent, Pierre. And could you|summon the passengers to me here?
{72479}{72547}One by one in this order except|for the Princess Dragomiroff,
{72551}{72643}who is not only of royal blood, but also|much older than she tries not to look.
{72647}{72790}And, Pierre, since you are here|already, we can conveniently start
{72815}{72859}by questioning you.
{72863}{72964}Your full name is Pierre Paul Michel.
{72983}{73051}- Correct, monsieur.|- Two male saints' names.
{73055}{73099}You must be greatly blessed.
{73103}{73195}I've had my share|of good fortune, monsieur.
{73199}{73267}So... And of bad.|I note the cancellation
{73271}{73363}of your wife's photograph|nearly five years ago.
{73367}{73458}- She is deceased.|- She died, monsieur.
{73462}{73572}Of grief at the death|of our only daughter.
{73606}{73681}From scarlet fever.
{73726}{73798}I am truly sorry.
{73894}{73962}Let us talk of less|distressing matters.
{73966}{74058}On the night of the murder,|after we left Belgrade,
{74062}{74106}who were the last passengers|to retire to their compartment?
{74110}{74178}Show me on the diagram.
{74182}{74274}About 1:30, I remember seeing|the English colonel say good night
{74278}{74370}{y:i}to Mr. McQueen outside|{y:i}number three and four.
{74374}{74489}{y:i}I saw him walk back into his|{y:i}compartment, number 15,
{74493}{74537}{y:i}which he did not leave.
{74541}{74633}And after that,|did no one reemerge?
{74637}{74705}No, but there was one lady|who opened a door,
{74709}{74800}I don't know which, and walked
{74805}{74825}{y:i}in the direction of the toilet
{74829}{74897}{y:i}at the far end of the corridor,|{y:i}next to the dining car.
{74901}{74993}- {y:i}Did you see her return?|- {y:i}No, monsieur.
{74997}{75065}It is possible|I was answering a bell.
{75069}{75113}That reminds me of a final point.
{75117}{75185}Much earlier, soon after 12:30,|you and I both heard Mr. Ratchett
{75189}{75343}ring his bell several times and then|apologize for having had a nightmare.
{75524}{75592}{y:i}Ce n'est rien.|{y:i}C'était un cauchemar.
{75596}{75688}Who rang the second bell while|you were answering Mr. Ratchett's?
{75692}{75760}The Princess Dragomiroff, monsieur.
{75764}{75832}She asked me to summon her maid.
{75836}{75950}Thank you, Pierre.|That is all for the moment.
{76148}{76216}He had the means to do it.|The passkey to Ratchett's room.
{76220}{76312}- And a knife borrowed from the chef.|- With whom he was in league.
{76316}{76408}Which he plunged repeatedly|and without motive into the body
{76412}{76431}of his suitably astonished victim.
{76435}{76566}Anyway, we know the door|was not only locked, but chained.
{76579}{76599}Mr. McQueen.
{76603}{76647}Since our last conversation,
{76651}{76743}I have learned the true identity|of your late employer.
{76747}{76815}You don't say.
{76819}{76935}Ratchett was, as you yourself|suspected, merely an alias.
{76939}{77007}He was, in fact, Cassetti.
{77011}{77079}The gangster who masterminded|the kidnapping and killing
{77083}{77127}of little Daisy Armstrong.
{77131}{77213}You had no idea of this?
{77227}{77271}Oh, no, sir.
{77275}{77415}If I had, I'd have cut off my right hand|so I couldn't type his lousy letters.
{77419}{77462}And I'd have killed him with my left.
{77466}{77586}You feel you could've done|the good deed yourself?
{77610}{77678}It seems like I'm kind of|incriminating myself.
{77682}{77726}I should be more inclined|to suspect you, Mr. McQueen,
{77730}{77822}if you displayed an inordinate sorrow|at your employer's decease.
{77826}{77884}Sorrow?
{77922}{78014}My dad, my father,|was the district attorney, yeah,
{78018}{78086}who handled the Armstrong case.
{78090}{78158}Mrs. Armstrong and her husband|came to our house twice
{78162}{78230}for advice about the ransom money.
{78234}{78325}She was gentle and frightened.
{78330}{78398}But not too frightened to take|an interest in a young man
{78402}{78493}who wanted to go on the stage.
{78521}{78589}She even said she'd write to...
{78593}{78637}She died before|she got around to that.
{78641}{78733}She was as helpful|to me as a...
{78737}{78781}Well, a mother.
{78785}{78829}Forgive a Freudian question.
{78833}{78931}- Do you love your mother?|- I did.
{78953}{79021}She died when I was 8.|An impressionable age.
{79025}{79093}- Why do you ask?|- We shared a compartment
{79097}{79141}on the first night of our journey.
{79145}{79237}You cried out to your mother|twice in your sleep.
{79241}{79285}Did I?
{79289}{79357}I still dream about her.
{79361}{79428}Go on. Tell me.|I'm emotionally retarded.
{79432}{79476}Tell me that's why|I never married.
{79480}{79633}I am not here to tell you anything,|Mr. McQueen. You are here to tell me.
{79648}{79740}Yeah, I'm sorry.|Yeah, there's just one thing.
{79744}{79812}How did you...
{79816}{79860}...figure out Ratchett's identity?
{79864}{79967}By a message found|in his compartment.
{79984}{80052}He'd have burnt that, though,|as I told you.
{80056}{80114}He did.
{80128}{80172}Yeah, he did.
{80176}{80244}- Then how did you decipher...?|- With the help of a hatbox.
{80248}{80329}Thank you, Mr. McQueen.
{80463}{80507}He did it.|He murdered Cassetti.
{80511}{80555}He practically confessed as much.
{80559}{80627}No, the psychology is wrong.
{80631}{80723}A sensitive, motherless boy|conceives a passion for a lady
{80727}{80795}whom he admires above all|for her gentleness.
{80799}{80891}Now, could McQueen,|admiring the gentleness,
{80895}{80987}commit so foul a murder|without betraying the gentleness
{80991}{81099}of what we might call|his fairy godmother?
{81111}{81155}Godmother.
{81159}{81251}Now you have accidentally|said something valuable.
{81255}{81310}Come.
{81375}{81490}Mr. Beddoes, this is not|an inquisition, only an inquiry.
{81494}{81538}When you took Mr. Ratchett|his valerian drops
{81542}{81658}about 9:40 yesterday evening,|was he already in bed?
{81662}{81730}That is so, sir. Mr. Ratchett|always retired early on trains.
{81734}{81802}What were your duties before|leaving him for the night?
{81806}{81850}To place the valerian drops|within reach, sir.
{81854}{81898}- Beddoes.|- Sir?
{81902}{81970}Did you put this on my table|during dinner?
{81974}{82018}- No, sir.|- Then who the hell did?
{82022}{82090}I have no idea, sir.
{82094}{82114}May I ask what it is?
{82118}{82162}What it is, is none|of your damn business.
{82166}{82256}I wanna know how it got here.
{82310}{82354}- Will there be anything more, sir?|- There will.
{82358}{82425}Tell Mr. McQueen|I wanna see him, now.
{82429}{82499}Very well, sir.
{82525}{82569}At what time would you like|to be called in the morning, sir?
{82573}{82617}Not before 10.
{82621}{82641}Very good, sir.
{82645}{82713}- Was that usual?|- Oh, quite, sir, yes.
{82717}{82761}His breakfast was his amber moon.
{82765}{82833}He never rose|until it had had its full effect.
{82837}{82905}So you instructed Mr. McQueen
{82909}{82953}and then returned|to your own compartment,
{82957}{83001}the number one and two,
{83005}{83097}whose upper berth was occupied|by Signor Foscarelli.
{83101}{83169}Oh, yes, sir, the Italian person.
{83173}{83241}- Does he speak English?|- A kind of English, sir.
{83245}{83313}I think he learned it|in a place called Chicago.
{83317}{83361}Did you talk together much?
{83365}{83456}Oh, no, sir. I prefer to read.
{83532}{83624}Hey, what are you reading,|Mr. Beddoes?
{83628}{83696}{y:i}Love's Captive,|by Mrs. Arabella Richardson.
{83700}{83744}Is it about sex?
{83748}{83849}No, it's about 10:30, Mr. Foscarelli.
{83916}{84010}I like that.|"It's about 10:30."
{84036}{84104}- And after that you went to sleep.|- Oh, no, sir.
{84108}{84224}Not until 4 in the morning.|Unfortunately, I had the toothache.
{84228}{84248}- And your companion?|- He snored incessantly.
{84252}{84296}- And your companion?|- He snored incessantly.
{84300}{84439}One final point. How did you come|to be employed by Mr. Ratchett?
{84443}{84487}Through Maibaums, sir,|the big agency in New York.
{84491}{84511}You'll find me on their books.
{84515}{84559}And before then?
{84563}{84607}I was in the army, sir,|as a private soldier.
{84611}{84679}- Where?|- Troon, sir.
{84683}{84727}- In the Far East?|- Oh, no, sir, in Scotland.
{84731}{84775}Oh, Scotland.
{84779}{84847}Oh, forgive me.|I am only an ignorant Belgian.
{84851}{84919}Oh, a Belgian, sir?|I always thought you were French.
{84923}{84967}Belgian.
{84971}{85063}Did you know that Mr. Ratchett|was of Italian extraction?
{85067}{85159}So that accounts for his hot temper.
{85163}{85231}His real name was Cassetti.
{85235}{85303}The name means nothing to you?
{85307}{85399}Do you remember|the Armstrong case?
{85403}{85470}No, sir. Oh, yes, yes.
{85474}{85518}The little girl.
{85522}{85627}Cassetti was responsible|for her murder.
{85666}{85734}- How does that strike you?|- I have often thought, sir,
{85738}{85806}that instead of our employers|requiring references from us,
{85810}{85914}we should require|references from them.
{85930}{85950}Thank you, Mr. Beddoes.
{85954}{86022}Oh, please don't get up, sir.|Will there be anything else?
{86026}{86097}No, that is all.
{86146}{86214}He did it. The butler did it.
{86218}{86286}He had constant access|to Ratchett.
{86290}{86310}He himself could have|poisoned the valerian
{86314}{86358}before bringing it to his master.
{86362}{86406}As for the psychological,
{86410}{86501}well, who knows what boils|and bubbles beneath that stiff shirt
{86505}{86549}to which his profession|has called him.
{86553}{86597}Did he not read {y:i}Love's Captive?
{86601}{86748}At a time when you suggest he should|have been stabbing Mr. Ratchett?
{87225}{87293}I fear that help is at hand.
{87297}{87365}Even if it is only a working party|with picks and shovels,
{87369}{87460}we must make haste to complete|this inquiry before we reach Brod.
{87464}{87556}If it is an engine with a snowplow,|our troubles will really begin.
{87560}{87580}- Who's next?|- Mrs. Hubbard.
{87584}{87648}Oh, my God.
{87656}{87700}The whistle means|that help is near, madame.
{87704}{87772}- And high time too.|- Time is what counts, Mrs. Hubbard,
{87776}{87844}if we are to complete this inquiry|before reaching Brod.
{87848}{87868}I will therefore make my questions
{87872}{87916}as brief as I hope you will make|your answers,
{87920}{87940}and the more often|you can confine yourself
{87944}{87988}to a simple yes or no, the better.
{87992}{88012}Well, don't waste time|yammering, begin.
{88016}{88084}Your full name|is Harriet Belinda Hubbard?
{88088}{88132}Yes. I was called Harriet after my...
{88136}{88180}By now, Mr. McQueen|has doubtless informed you
{88184}{88276}- of the true identity of Mr. Ratchett?|- Yes, that low-down, stinking...
{88280}{88300}Were you acquainted|with the Armstrongs?
{88304}{88372}No, of course not. They were|a very social family. Anyway...
{88376}{88443}Mrs. Hubbard, I overhead the whole|of your conversation with Pierre
{88447}{88491}about there being a man|in your room soon after 1:00
{88495}{88563}on the night of the murder.|Tell me one thing more.
{88567}{88635}Wasn't the door locked|on your side of the door
{88639}{88707}that communicated with Mr. Ratchett's|compartment when you went to bed?
{88711}{88731}Yes, so far as I know.|My second husband...
{88735}{88803}What do you mean,|as far as you know?
{88807}{88875}Could you not see|the bolt from the bed?
{88879}{88923}- No.|- Why?
{88927}{88995}It was masked by my makeup bag|on the hook above.
{88999}{89043}Pierre checked the bolt|after I rang my bell
{89047}{89091}and told him there had been a man|hiding in my compartment.
{89095}{89163}Yes, yes, we know all about that.
{89167}{89211}Oh, no, you don't.
{89215}{89259}I beg your pardon.
{89263}{89331}You don't know what I found this|morning on top of the magazine
{89335}{89379}I'd been reading to send myself asleep.
{89383}{89438}What?
{89670}{89690}{y:i}Dio mio.
{89694}{89824}This is a button from the tunic|of a wagon-lit conductor.
{89838}{89930}Doctor, would you kindly inquire|whether Pierre has lost a tunic button?
{89934}{89992}Gladly.
{90150}{90194}Your handkerchief, Mrs. Hubbard.
{90198}{90266}Oh, that's not mine.|I have mine right here.
{90270}{90361}Oh, I thought the initial H...
{90366}{90457}H for Harriet, H for Hubbard,|but it's still not mine.
{90461}{90553}Mine are sensible things,|not expensive Paris frills.
{90557}{90601}What good's a hankie like that|to anybody?
{90605}{90697}One sneeze and it has to go|to the laundry.
{90701}{90745}Oh, Mrs. Hubbard,
{90749}{90841}you have afforded me a great deal|of help in this difficult case.
{90845}{90961}Thank you, if I may so express it,|for playing your part.
{90965}{91033}If you need me again, I'll be around.
{91037}{91105}Not one of Pierre's buttons|is missing,
{91109}{91153}and all his buttons are sewn on|with old thread.
{91157}{91201}As I suspected.
{91205}{91273}- I'm fright.|- Have no fear, mademoiselle.
{91277}{91321}They all come out looking|much more peaceful.
{91325}{91345}Only God can give peaceful.
{91349}{91440}- {y:i}God dag, fröken Ohlsson.|- {y:i}Nej, talar ni svenska.
{91444}{91536}Alas, mademoiselle,|that is the extent of my Swedish.
{91540}{91584}Forgive me if I am personal,
{91588}{91632}but most Scandinavians|of my acquaintance
{91636}{91728}are well-educated|in other languages.
{91732}{91800}And yet you have difficulty...
{91804}{91889}I... I was born backwards.
{91924}{92034}That is why I work in Africa|as missionary,
{92044}{92171}teaching little brown babies|more backward than myself.
{92188}{92280}But I... I see that you have spent|three months in America.
{92284}{92374}Were you not able to improve?
{92380}{92495}I was in... In a mis...|I... I... International group.
{92499}{92638}In... For getting money for|African mission from American rich.
{92667}{92768}I... I speak Swedish|to big audiences
{92787}{92897}in... In...|In Swedish-American institution
{92907}{93007}in Minneapolis and other big cities.
{93027}{93071}In ten weeks,
{93075}{93175}we make $14,000 and...|And 27 cents.
{93219}{93307}That's wonderful, wonderful.
{93339}{93473}Miss Ohlsson, how long have you|been interested in religion?
{93482}{93553}From five years.
{93602}{93694}In summer, in...|I had been sick as always.
{93698}{93790}And I sat in the grass in the garden.
{93794}{93888}And I... I saw Jesus in the sky,
{93914}{94005}{y:i}mit many little children,
{94010}{94102}but all the children were brown.
{94106}{94174}So it was a sign for me
{94178}{94270}- to look after little brown babies.|- Yes.
{94274}{94362}Were your parents religious?
{94370}{94461}{y:i}Ne, they had no respect for God.
{94465}{94485}No.
{94489}{94574}So it was not just a sign,
{94609}{94693}it was also a punishment.
{94705}{94797}Oh, there, there, there, there.
{94801}{94845}I'm sure that God will forgive you,|Miss Ohlsson,
{94849}{94996}and perhaps, which is more important,|so will your father and mother.
{95041}{95098}Now...
{95185}{95253}...here is the compartment|you share with...
{95257}{95349}{y:i}Ja, and here is|my number seven bed.
{95353}{95420}Yes, your number seven.
{95424}{95468}Tell me about number eight.
{95472}{95562}Is filled with Miss Debenham,
{95592}{95660}a very nice young lady from Baghdad,
{95664}{95756}where she teach English shorthand|to children,
{95760}{95828}to forward children.
{95832}{95959}After the train left Vinkovci,|did she leave her berth?
{96000}{96044}{y:i}Ne, she sleep just like me.
{96048}{96188}If you were fast asleep, how could|you be so sure she did not leave?
{96192}{96305}In Shimoga Mission,|I can hear snake breathe.
{96336}{96380}I would know.
{96384}{96451}Good. And did you leave your room?
{96455}{96563}{y:i}Ne, not till morning, in my bed gown.
{96575}{96680}Is your bed gown white|with red animals?
{96695}{96763}{y:i}Ne, is {y:i}Jaeger.
{96767}{96857}And Miss Debenham's bed gown?
{96863}{96941}{y:i}Den var em lila.
{96959}{97003}- Oh, like the French "{y:i}lilas", "lilac".|- {y:i}Ja.
{97007}{97099}- Just {y:i}det lila, just {y:i}det lila.|- {y:i}Lila, {y:i}lila.
{97103}{97219}Good. And why are you making|this trip, Miss Ohlsson?
{97223}{97315}Just as always, money,|money for mission.
{97319}{97363}Good. Good.
{97367}{97434}When this is all over, mademoiselle,
{97438}{97506}I promise that I shall make you|an emolument.
{97510}{97597}God will find you a reward.
{97654}{97748}{y:i}Tack så mycket. Tack. Tack.
{97846}{97924}Monsieur, she did it.
{98014}{98082}{y:i}Merci, Pierre, and could you please|inform the Princess Dragomiroff
{98086}{98154}that Signor Bianchi and I will attend|on her and her maid
{98158}{98274}- shortly in her compartment?|- {y:i}Oui, monsieur.
{98278}{98355}That is very proper.
{98398}{98465}Monsieur le Comte, this is|a Hungarian diplomatic passport.
{98469}{98561}It gives you and your wife|the right to refuse interrogation.
{98565}{98609}In the circumstances,|we waive that right.
{98613}{98657}You are most kind.
{98661}{98705}As you know,|{y:i}Madame la Comtesse,
{98709}{98777}it is a joint passport which sets out|your husband's name and titles,
{98781}{98849}but requires no particulars|about yourself,
{98853}{98897}except your signature|and your maiden name.
{98901}{98969}Your maiden name|is clearly Grunwald.
{98973}{99065}That is correct, monsieur.|My family is of German extraction,
{99069}{99137}though I now hold|Hungarian citizenship.
{99141}{99233}Unfortunately, the first letter|of your married signature
{99237}{99350}has been almost obliterated|by a grease spot.
{99357}{99448}I must say, I find immigration officials|are often less than cleanly. They...
{99452}{99520}They sit in their little box,|eating a buttered roll with one hand
{99524}{99592}and stamping the spilt butter|into your passport with the other.
{99596}{99688}Precisely. Therefore,|I would be greatly obliged
{99692}{99808}if you could duplicate|the mutilated entry of your passport
{99812}{99869}there.
{99932}{100027}Elena Andrenyi {y:i}née Grunwald.
{100340}{100479}Allowing for the difference in pens,|the duplication seems exact.
{100483}{100527}There would be little point, then,|in asking
{100531}{100629}whether this handkerchief is yours?
{100651}{100743}Since it contains neither of my initials,|no point whatsoever, monsieur.
{100747}{100863}And even less point in asking|the color of your dressing gown?
{100867}{100983}None, unless monsieur takes|a professional interest in apricot silk?
{100987}{101055}I take a professional interest|in crime, madame.
{101059}{101127}Have you and your husband|ever visited America together?
{101131}{101199}No. We first met in Wiesbaden...
{101203}{101271}...much later.|- Later than what?
{101275}{101367}Later than the days of my youth,|when I was on post in Washington.
{101371}{101391}You lived in Washington?
{101395}{101486}Oh, what diplomat of promise has not?
{101490}{101558}You did not sleep well last night?
{101562}{101654}On the contrary, apart from one of|Mrs. Hubbard's customary outbursts,
{101658}{101702}I slept very soundly.
{101706}{101798}- And you, madame?|- Oh, even more soundly.
{101802}{101846}We, neither of us, woke till after 8.
{101850}{101918}As is my custom on night trains,|I took Trional.
{101922}{101990}Diethyl-sulphone-dimethyl-methane.
{101994}{102086}One dilutes the white crystals|with water, it is a strong hypnotic.
{102090}{102134}He makes it sound like a poison.
{102138}{102206}As with most sleeping drafts,|if taken in sufficient quantities,
{102210}{102254}it is a poison.
{102258}{102326}- You are not accusing...|- You are not accused,
{102330}{102397}you are excused.
{102401}{102514}Thank you both for your help|and cooperation.
{102713}{102829}{y:i}"Kennst du das Land,|{y:i}wo die Zitronen blühen?
{102833}{102954}{y:i}"Lm dunklen Laub|{y:i}die Gold-Orangen glühen,
{102977}{103093}{y:i}"Ein sanfter Wind|{y:i}vom Blauen Himmel weht,
{103097}{103221}{y:i}"Die Myrte still|{y:i}und hoch der Lorbeer steht
{103337}{103421}{y:i}"Kennst du es wohl?"
{103480}{103570}Why have you stopped reading?
{103600}{103744}{y:i}"Dahin! Dahin!|{y:i}Möcht ich mit dir, o mein Gelieb... {y:i}"
{104128}{104196}- {y:i}Altezza.|- Signor Bianchi.
{104200}{104268}{y:i}È permesso presentare|{y:i}I'investigatore distinto,
{104272}{104340}Monsieur Hercule Poirot?
{104344}{104435}Hildegarde has read me many|of your cases in the newspapers,
{104439}{104507}but I have had to stop her.
{104511}{104627}Nowadays, they are the only form|of literature that keeps me awake.
{104631}{104767}And I need what I defiantly continue|to call my beauty sleep.
{104799}{104891}- You would care for a little cognac?|- Thank you, no.
{104895}{104960}Yes, please.
{104967}{105059}Now, you wish me to confess|to the murder of Mr...?
{105063}{105107}What's his name?
{105111}{105203}{y:i}Au contraire, {y:i}Madame la Princesse,|it is I who wish to make a confession.
{105207}{105251}You pay me the compliment|of having read about me,
{105255}{105323}I return the compliment
{105327}{105394}by admitting that|I have read about you.
{105398}{105459}Continue.
{105470}{105490}I have been accidentally reminded
{105494}{105562}that you were the godmother|of Mrs. Armstrong,
{105566}{105634}who was herself the mother|of the kidnapped child, Daisy.
{105638}{105730}How did you become Mrs. Armstrong's|godmother, madame?
{105734}{105802}I was the friend and admirer|of her mother,
{105806}{105898}the great American actress,|Linda Arden.
{105902}{105970}Why did you bring these daggers|from the place?
{105974}{106042}Is that a quotation or a question?
{106046}{106138}A quotation. I saw her twice|as Lady Macbeth in London.
{106142}{106258}She was the greatest|tragic actress of her day.
{106286}{106330}Was? Surely she is still alive,|madame?
{106334}{106412}Alive, but bedridden.
{106429}{106521}Did she not have a second daughter,|younger than Mrs. Armstrong?
{106525}{106569}There was,|but I do not recall her name.
{106573}{106665}When I paid a visit,|she was always away at school.
{106669}{106713}What became of|the younger daughter?
{106717}{106843}She married a Turk or some such.|We never spoke of it.
{106885}{106929}What was Mrs. Armstrong's|maiden name?
{106933}{107025}Mrs. Armstrong's|maiden name was
{107029}{107091}Greenwood.
{107101}{107193}May I tax your memory and,|indeed, your patience a little longer?
{107197}{107265}There are other names|in the Armstrong household
{107269}{107313}that I cannot recall.|Was there not a secretary?
{107317}{107385}{y:i}Of course there was a secretary.
{107389}{107408}Her name, madame?
{107412}{107473}Her name.
{107484}{107552}Oh, my memor...
{107556}{107624}She was a Miss Freebody.
{107628}{107672}Was there not a gallant chauffeur?
{107676}{107720}{y:i}There was.
{107724}{107792}I never used him. I had my own.
{107796}{107840}Surely he was not|the only male servant?
{107844}{107888}{y:i}I seem to remember one other there.
{107892}{107960}He was, I think you would say,
{107964}{108054}the colonel's Indian orderly.
{108060}{108128}And Mrs. Armstrong's|personal maid.
{108132}{108224}The one who was wrongly suspected|of complicity in the kidnapping
{108228}{108272}- {y:i}and killed herself?|- I always travel
{108276}{108320}with my own personal maid.
{108324}{108391}There was no need to speak|with Mrs. Armstrong's.
{108395}{108511}Doubtless, Fräulein Schmidt|will remember her name.
{108515}{108559}Surely, Fräulein,|as one lady's maid to another,
{108563}{108631}you conversed|as equals below stairs.
{108635}{108716}{y:i}Ja, ja, natürlich.
{108731}{108799}But ladies' maids were often called|only by their Christian names.
{108803}{108871}And what was hers?
{108875}{108895}Paulette.
{108899}{108943}Hildegarde.
{108947}{109039}You will be so kind|as to give me two aspirin.
{109043}{109087}And you will ask|the dining-car attendant
{109091}{109111}to bring me a glass of Russian tea,
{109115}{109183}and then you may retire|to your own compartment.
{109187}{109255}I will ring when I need you.
{109259}{109352}{y:i}Ja wohl, meine Prinzessin.
{109402}{109492}Finally, there was the nurse.
{109498}{109565}I had no need
{109618}{109662}of a nurse.
{109666}{109760}That is an ordeal still to come.
{109834}{109902}You never smile,|{y:i}Madame la Princesse.
{109906}{109974}My doctor has advised
{109978}{110042}against it.
{110338}{110400}Excuse me.
{110529}{110597}There is no need for us|to fatigue you further.
{110601}{110669}You have been of the utmost help.
{110673}{110717}Go back to the Pullman|and tell Pierre
{110721}{110765}to summon Colonel Arbuthnott|in five minutes.
{110769}{110861}- I want a word with the maid.|- Yes, Poirot.
{110865}{110933}Fräulein Schmidt, I wonder|if I might have a word with you
{110937}{110981}about a small matter|in the privacy of your compartment?
{110985}{111126}- I have to take these aspirins...|- We will leave the door ajar.
{111201}{111245}I observed how moved you were
{111249}{111317}at the mention|of Mrs. Armstrong's maid, Paulette.
{111321}{111388}She had a sweet nature, {y:i}mein Herr.|We were deep friends.
{111392}{111460}Have you a photograph of her|in your possession?
{111464}{111604}{y:i}Ja. I never travel without my photo box.|It helps to pass the evenings.
{111608}{111713}No, please, {y:i}mein Herr.|I am strong.
{111896}{111955}Be calm.
{111968}{111988}This could be your salvation
{111992}{112036}and that of every passenger|in the Calais coach,
{112040}{112122}including your mistress.
{112256}{112300}When did you last open the suitcase?
{112304}{112419}After Belgrade. When Pierre|summoned me to the {y:i}Prinzessin,
{112423}{112515}I took out a volume of Goethe, in case|she wished me to read her to sleep.
{112519}{112587}Too stout for Pierre.
{112591}{112683}And, yes, there is a button missing|from the tunic.
{112687}{112780}A button found by Mrs. Hubbard.
{112855}{112955}And a passkey in the trouser pocket.
{112999}{113096}Here is the photo, {y:i}mein Herr.
{113143}{113211}And this pretty, innocent girl
{113215}{113303}threw herself from a window.
{113335}{113379}Use this, Fräulein.
{113383}{113426}I found it in the corridor|and thought it must be yours
{113430}{113474}- because it bears the initial H.|- No. No.
{113478}{113546}That is the handkerchief|not of a maid, but of a great lady.
{113550}{113625}Like your mistress?
{113670}{113786}It is her style, {y:i}ja,|but not her handkerchief.
{113790}{113834}I know all her linen.
{113838}{113882}Besides,
{113886}{113906}the initial is wrong.
{113910}{113978}What is the princess's first name?
{113982}{114074}Natalia, {y:i}mein Herr.|It is a Russian name.
{114078}{114122}Then I must keep it|until I find the rightful owner.
{114126}{114242}Might I also keep the photograph until|this evening? I promise to return it.
{114246}{114338}{y:i}Ja. Ja. That does not worry me,|but this,
{114342}{114362}this does.
{114366}{114433}Am I to be accused|of hiding it in my suitcase?
{114437}{114553}Fräulein, I am as sure|you did not hide the uniform
{114557}{114649}as I am sure you are a good|and loyal friend to your mistress.
{114653}{114721}Not only a good maid,|but also a good cook.
{114725}{114841}Not merely a good cook,|but a companion, a comfort, a solace.
{114845}{114913}You see? You are a good cook,|are you not?
{114917}{115011}All my ladies have said so. I...
{115085}{115163}{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen.
{115181}{115273}{y:i}Animal crackers in my soup
{115277}{115375}{y:i}Lions and tigers loop-the-loop
{116236}{116320}You opening a dress shop?
{116547}{116591}No.
{116595}{116663}We are closing an inquiry.|Where is Shimoga?
{116667}{116711}- I beg your pardon?|- Shimoga, where is it?
{116715}{116783}Well, it's a bit off my track.|I'm a Northwest Frontier man myself.
{116787}{116879}But Shimoga's down south,|in Mysore. Why?
{116883}{116927}Does it possess a mission?
{116931}{116975}How the hell should I know?|India's pustular with missions.
{116979}{117071}You are returning on leave|from India to England?
{117075}{117119}- Yes.|- Why overland?
{117123}{117167}Why not?
{117171}{117263}Because the sea route|by P and O is more usual.
{117267}{117335}I chose to come overland|for reasons of my own.
{117339}{117359}Colonel Arbuthnott,|in a murder inquiry,
{117363}{117476}no suspect's reasons|are exclusively his own.
{117506}{117574}I stopped for one night|to see Ur of the Chaldees,
{117578}{117646}and for three days in Baghdad|with the A.O.C.,
{117650}{117694}who happens to be|a friend of mine.
{117698}{117814}The English Miss Debenham|also has traveled from Baghdad.
{117818}{117886}It is possible the murder|was committed by a woman
{117890}{117997}or by a man and a woman|in collaboration.
{118010}{118102}From your acquaintanceship|with Miss Debenham,
{118106}{118150}would you have thought|that she was
{118154}{118198}capable physically or emotionally or...?
{118202}{118294}- That's a bloody irregular question.|- I know, but I ask it.
{118298}{118388}Miss Debenham is not a woman.
{118441}{118485}- She's a lady.|- Which precludes her
{118489}{118509}from being a murderess?
{118513}{118557}Damn it,|the man was a perfect stranger.
{118561}{118700}- She'd never seen him before.|- You feel warmly in the matter.
{118777}{118821}I don't know what you're driving at.
{118825}{118869}Then let us be practical|and drive at facts.
{118873}{118965}Did you know Colonel Armstrong?
{118969}{119013}{y:i}Not to speak to.
{119017}{119085}You see, his outfit and mine|wouldn't have mixed much.
{119089}{119157}I'm Indian army.|He was British army, serving in India.
{119161}{119226}Royal Scots.
{119233}{119253}- How did you know?|- It was in the papers
{119257}{119365}when he shot himself|after the kidnapping.
{119377}{119442}Rotten show.
{119448}{119492}Thought he'd been tougher than that.
{119496}{119614}After all, he got a D.S.O.|And an M.C. In France.
{119664}{119752}Distinguished Service Order.
{119784}{119828}Military Cross.
{119832}{119876}{y:i}Mon colonel,
{119880}{119972}Ratchett was responsible|for five deaths:
{119976}{120081}The suicide|of the falsely accused maid.
{120096}{120193}The murder of the Armstrong child.
{120216}{120284}The death of Mrs. Armstrong,
{120288}{120403}while giving premature birth|to a stillborn baby.
{120407}{120475}And the ultimate suicide|of Colonel Armstrong,
{120479}{120595}in the face of multiple|and intolerable bereavements!
{120599}{120643}I would have understood his action
{120647}{120787}if, in addition to the D.S.O. And M.C.,|he had been awarded the V.C.
{120791}{120859}Which stands, as you may know,|for Victoria Cross
{120863}{120931}and is awarded for valor.
{120935}{121003}Then, in my opinion,
{121007}{121075}Ratchett deserved what he got.
{121079}{121171}Though I'd sooner have seen him|properly tried by jury.
{121175}{121292}Trial by 12 good men and true|is a sound system.
{121390}{121482}We believe the murder|was committed at 1:15.
{121486}{121554}What were you doing then?
{121558}{121602}I was yarning with young...|What's his name?
{121606}{121650}McQueen, in his compartment.
{121654}{121746}He was interested in the future|of India, a bit impractical.
{121750}{121818}He thought the British|ought to move out.
{121822}{121890}How long did you stay yarning|after that?
{121894}{121968}Till 1:30. It's...
{122014}{122082}It's what I call a three-pipe yarn.
{122086}{122178}Colonel Arbuthnott, you are the only|passenger in the Calais coach
{122182}{122259}who smokes a "pipe".
{122278}{122370}- So it would appear.|- Then this...
{122374}{122465}...must be your "pipe" cleaner.
{122469}{122537}- It's the same brand.|- It was found in an ashtray
{122541}{122585}{y:i}by the dead man's bedside.
{122589}{122720}Then someone planted it there.|It's a used "pipe" cleaner.
{122733}{122777}Or are you suggesting|that I'm fool enough
{122781}{122825}to have entered Ratchett's cabin,|murdered him,
{122829}{122921}cleaned my "pipe" and dropped it|in the ashtray before leaving?
{122925}{123006}No, Colonel Arbuthnott.
{123021}{123089}Miss Debenham.
{123117}{123221}- Can I stay?|- No, Colonel Arbuthnott.
{123333}{123405}Please be seated.
{123476}{123520}Forgive me, Miss Debenham,|I must be brief.
{123524}{123616}You met Colonel Arbuthnott and fell|in love with each other in Baghdad.
{123620}{123712}Why must the English conceal|even their most impeccable emotions?
{123716}{123760}To answer your observations|in order,
{123764}{123841}of course, yes, yes,
{123884}{123904}and I don't know.
{123908}{124000}Then let me tell you what you do know,|that on the Bosporus Ferryboat
{124004}{124072}I overheard a part of your conversation|with the colonel.
{124076}{124192}Not now, not now. When it's all over.|When it's behind us, then.
{124196}{124288}When what was all over,|Miss Debenham?
{124292}{124336}And when what was behind you?
{124340}{124448}Was it some task|that had to be performed?
{124459}{124503}Some ordeal that|had to be endured?
{124507}{124551}Some dark deed|that had to be dispatched?
{124555}{124647}Mr. Poirot, I'm not at liberty|to answer any of those questions.
{124651}{124695}Not here on this train, perhaps.
{124699}{124767}But when the Yugoslav police take|over an unsolved murder case at Brod,
{124771}{124839}you will not remain at liberty|unless you answer the questions.
{124843}{124911}I can always call my lawyers|long-distance.
{124915}{124983}This is a private matter|between the colonel and myself.
{124987}{125031}Miss Debenham, in a murder case,|no matter is private
{125035}{125055}and evasion breeds suspicion,
{125059}{125127}so answer my question.|When what was all over?
{125131}{125175}When what was behind you?|Please answer the question.
{125179}{125247}You will remain here|until I get an answer from you.
{125251}{125319}{y:i}Mon colonel, please, Monsieur Poirot|has expressly forbidden...
{125323}{125414}Poirot has no right, he's out of order.|This is a private matter.
{125418}{125438}{y:i}Je vous en prie, mon colonel.
{125442}{125486}- {y:i}Mon colonel.|- Out of my way.
{125490}{125534}So answer my question.|When what was all over?
{125538}{125558}When what was behind?|Answer my question.
{125562}{125606}Get your hands off|Miss Debenham.
{125610}{125678}I was not aware that I was keeping|my hands on Miss Debenham.
{125682}{125702}I asked her a simple question
{125706}{125774}- which she refused to answer.|- So I heard.
{125778}{125882}Then perhaps you can|answer it for her.
{126066}{126110}Can you give me your solemn oath,
{126114}{126184}as a foreigner,
{126210}{126278}that if the answer|has nothing to do with the murder,
{126282}{126326}you'll treat it confidentially?
{126330}{126388}I will.
{126593}{126685}Six months ago,|before I'd even met Miss Debenham,
{126689}{126733}- my memsahib...|- Come again?
{126737}{126781}My wife
{126785}{126901}expressed herself bored,|not only at living in India,
{126905}{126925}but at living with me.
{126929}{127021}And asked me to provide her|with a divorce.
{127025}{127141}In view of my position, commanding|officer, 12th Gurkhas, I refused.
{127145}{127237}Well, had I not,|I should have lost my command.
{127241}{127333}My wife returned to England,|where there is irrefutable evidence
{127337}{127404}that she has been persistently
{127408}{127476}unfaithful to me.
{127480}{127548}I have therefore instituted|divorce proceedings
{127552}{127660}in which she is cited|as the guilty party.
{127672}{127764}And when those proceedings|are behind us,
{127768}{127860}when those proceedings|are all over...
{127864}{127956}...I propose|to marry Miss Debenham.
{127960}{128004}Meanwhile,
{128008}{128138}it is of vital importance,|under English law, that our...
{128176}{128220}...behavior...
{128224}{128316}...should not provide evidence|for counter-proceedings
{128320}{128384}by my wife.
{128487}{128580}Does that answer your question?
{128823}{128881}Well...
{128919}{129009}...it is certainly an answer.
{129039}{129107}Doctor, is Pierre|sufficiently recovered?
{129111}{129155}- Fully.|- May we go?
{129159}{129275}You may, with my assurance that|our foreigners' lips shall be sealed.
{129279}{129323}Sorry if I hurt the lad.
{129327}{129392}Provocation.
{129422}{129490}They could have done it together. She|has hidden fires. She is very strong.
{129494}{129562}Why did you not ask her|if she had been to America?
{129566}{129651}Because I did not need to.
{129662}{129730}Pierre, {y:i}le colonel|{y:i}s'excuse de son geste.
{129734}{129778}{y:i}Merci, monsieur.
{129782}{129856}Signor Foscarelli.
{129926}{129970}You are a naturalized|American subject?
{129974}{130018}- You bet.|- For how long?
{130022}{130114}Seven years. {y:i}Mi ricordo del|{y:i}giorno preciso quando...
{130118}{130162}{y:i}Faccia di rispondere|{y:i}alle domande.
{130166}{130234}Otherwise, he will detain you|longer than you would detain him.
{130238}{130282}You are a motorcar salesman.
{130286}{130354}You bet.|American automobiles to Italians.
{130358}{130401}Did you know Cassetti?
{130405}{130497}Not on your sweet life.|{y:i}Era Mafioso.
{130501}{130545}He says he was Mafia.
{130549}{130593}- Really?|- Yes.
{130597}{130689}Who do you...?|Who do you think killed him?
{130693}{130737}- {y:i}Un altro Mafioso.|- He says another Mafia.
{130741}{130881}They are always killing each|other with a knife or with a gun...
{131197}{131265}Why did you bring|this dagger from the place?
{131269}{131313}Because I found it|in my makeup bag.
{131317}{131337}{y:i}Ecco, what did I say?
{131341}{131408}Knives or guns. It's a vendetta|between two {y:i}Mafiosi.
{131412}{131487}Give me the dagger.
{131604}{131672}When did you last open|your makeup bag?
{131676}{131720}Yesterday evening,|when I took everything out.
{131724}{131792}If you took everything out,|why did you need to reopen it?
{131796}{131888}Because I was putting|something back in.
{131892}{131984}You may set your mind at rest,|Mrs. Hubbard.
{131988}{132032}- The missing button.|- Precisely,
{132036}{132176}and I can assure you the owner|of the tunic is not now on the train.
{132180}{132224}Are you going back|to the dining car?
{132228}{132296}I'll say I am. Do you think|I could face my compartment
{132300}{132320}so soon after that?
{132324}{132391}Would you kindly ask|the chief attendant
{132395}{132463}to arrange the tables and chairs|so that Signor Bianchi,
{132467}{132511}Dr. Constantine and myself
{132515}{132649}can confront the passengers|with the solution of the murder?
{132851}{132895}I... I help with the {y:i}risoluzione.
{132899}{132991}Yes, if you will briefly|answer two more questions.
{132995}{133015}Shoot.
{133019}{133063}On the night of the murder,
{133067}{133135}did Mr. Beddoes|leave the compartment?
{133139}{133231}No. No, he grunt like a pig|with the pain in his teeth.
{133235}{133303}And have you ever|been in private service?
{133307}{133359}No.
{133378}{133422}Thank you. That is all.
{133426}{133508}- Excuse me, sir.|- Yes.
{133522}{133566}{y:i}Enfin, doctor?
{133570}{133614}This blood is human.
{133618}{133686}This dagger could,|in two different hands,
{133690}{133734}have inflicted all of the wounds.
{133738}{133806}And you know|who inflicted them?
{133810}{133926}Our last interrogation|will be something of a gamble.
{133930}{133998}But if it succeeds...
{134002}{134070}...we'll know.
{134146}{134238}Come in, come in.|Please be seated.
{134242}{134355}You are Cyrus B. Hardman,|a theatrical agent.
{134362}{134405}No.
{134409}{134477}I mean, I'm...|I'm not a theatrical agent.
{134481}{134573}That's a phony, issued to me|under license by Pinkerton's.
{134577}{134645}- The detective agency?|- Stamboul branch.
{134649}{134741}Ratchett asked them for an|American bodyguard, they sent me.
{134745}{134825}I... didn't do so hot.
{134841}{134962}Can you prove this was|the reason for your journey?
{135488}{135591}- {y:i}It's Paulette.|- {y:i}Paulette.
{135608}{135679}Paulette Michel.
{135752}{135859}Now I can stop pretending|to be anything.
{136783}{136875}Ladies and gentlemen,|may I have your attention, please.
{136879}{136971}May I respectfully suggest|that there should be no talking
{136975}{137067}while Monsieur Poirot addresses you.|If anyone wishes to make a statement,
{137071}{137139}he or she can do so|at the meeting's end.
{137143}{137205}Thank you.
{137239}{137331}Ladies and gentlemen, you are|all aware that a repulsive murderer
{137335}{137426}has himself been repulsively|and perhaps deservedly murdered.
{137430}{137474}How and why?
{137478}{137522}Here is the simple answer.
{137526}{137570}There is evidence|supporting the theory
{137574}{137618}that the murderer|was a stranger to us all.
{137622}{137714}Mrs. Hubbard was conscious|of a man in her compartment
{137718}{137762}soon after 1:15 a.m.
{137766}{137906}She later found near her bedside|the button of a wagon-lit conductor.
{137910}{138002}Fräulein Schmidt discovered,|planted in her suitcase,
{138006}{138050}the uniform of a conductor,
{138054}{138122}which could not possibly|have fitted Pierre,
{138126}{138194}and from which, in fact,|there was a button missing.
{138198}{138266}And in the trouser|pocket of the uniform
{138270}{138338}was a conductor's passkey.
{138342}{138479}Later still, Mrs. Hubbard discovered|this bloodstained dagger,
{138485}{138529}which Dr. Constantine confirms
{138533}{138625}could have been|the murderer's weapon.
{138629}{138742}The obvious implication|is that the murderer,
{138749}{138817}disguised as a conductor,|boarded the train at Belgrade,
{138821}{138889}made his way by means|of the convenient passkey
{138893}{138961}to Ratchett's compartment,|stabbed him to death,
{138965}{139009}planted the dagger|and the uniform,
{139013}{139129}and then departed, since the train|was now halted in a snowdrift.
{139133}{139177}Who was he?
{139181}{139249}I am inclined to agree|with Mr. Foscarelli,
{139253}{139321}who believes that he was|a rival member of the Mafia,
{139325}{139392}exacting private vengeance|for a vendetta
{139396}{139540}whose precise nature the Yugoslav|police will undoubtedly identify.
{139564}{139584}But...
{139588}{139608}...is that all?|- No. No, no, no, no.
{139612}{139680}...is that all?|- No. No, no, no, no.
{139684}{139728}No, it is not.
{139732}{139829}I said, here is the simple answer.
{139876}{139944}There is also a more...
{139948}{140018}...complex one.
{140068}{140160}But remember|my first solution when I...
{140164}{140252}When you've heard my second.
{140260}{140328}Let us, for the moment, assume|what is perfectly plausible,
{140332}{140423}that the mysterious|stranger did not exist.
{140427}{140519}The murder must then have been|committed by some person or persons
{140523}{140664}in the Calais coach and therefore|are present in this dining car.
{140691}{140759}Let us not, for the moment,|ask the question "how"
{140763}{140879}but the question "why",|which will tell us how.
{140883}{140927}I was not surprised|that every single one of you
{140931}{141023}should have heard of|the notorious Armstrong case.
{141027}{141143}But I confess to a mild surprise when|the first passenger I interrogated,
{141147}{141191}Mr. McQueen...
{141195}{141239}...admitted, under emotional stress,
{141243}{141358}that he had actually known|Mrs. Armstrong, albeit very slightly.
{141362}{141406}She was gentle and frightened.
{141410}{141478}But not too frightened to take|an interest in a young man
{141482}{141526}who wanted to go on the stage.
{141530}{141622}Was Mr. McQueen lying|when he denied ever having
{141626}{141670}known that Ratchett|was Cassetti?
{141674}{141742}Or did he become|Ratchett's secretary
{141746}{141862}as part of a deliberate plan to avenge|Mrs. Armstrong's death?
{141866}{141910}Only by interrogating|the other passengers
{141914}{141982}could I hope to see the light.
{141986}{142030}But when I began|to question them,
{142034}{142152}the light, as Macbeth|would have said, thickened.
{142178}{142246}When I told the Princess|Dragomiroff that I knew she was
{142250}{142294}Mrs. Armstrong's godmother,
{142298}{142389}her answers to my subsequent|questions smelled strongly
{142393}{142461}of inaccuracy and evasion.
{142465}{142557}Even I knew more from reading|the newspaper reports
{142561}{142658}than she from her frequent visits.
{142681}{142725}Was there not a chauffeur?
{142729}{142821}There was, monsieur, but I had|my own. I never used him.
{142825}{142917}Evasion. What was the name of|Mrs. Armstrong's personal maid?
{142921}{143031}I always travel with|my own maid, monsieur.
{143041}{143133}There was no need to speak|with Mrs. Armstrong's.
{143137}{143229}Evasion. I asked for particulars|of the manservant.
{143233}{143349}He was, I think, the colonel's Indian,|how you would say, orderly.
{143353}{143396}Inaccuracy.
{143400}{143468}Colonel Armstrong was an officer|of the British army in India.
{143472}{143588}He would have had a British|batman, like Private Beddoes,
{143592}{143660}to serve his personal needs.
{143664}{143708}Only officers of the Indian army,
{143712}{143756}like Colonel Arbuthnott,|have Indian orderlies.
{143760}{143828}I asked her the name of|Mrs. Armstrong's younger sister.
{143832}{143876}I do not recall her name.
{143880}{143924}Unbelievable evasion.
{143928}{144020}I asked her the name|of Mrs. Armstrong's secretary.
{144024}{144092}Yes, a Miss Freebody.
{144096}{144164}{y:i}Non, c'est impossible ça.
{144168}{144236}The princess, it seems,|is playing the psychological game
{144240}{144308}of word association.
{144312}{144379}Freebody is the name|of the junior partner
{144383}{144475}of one of London's most famous|and most opulent ladies' stores
{144479}{144571}of the sort perhaps patronized|by the princess herself.
{144575}{144685}The name of the senior partner|is Debenham.
{144695}{144775}Debenham and Freebody.
{144791}{144859}Was the princess covering|up for our Miss Debenham,
{144863}{144955}who taught shorthand|in Baghdad?
{144959}{145075}Can she tell us the name|of Mrs. Armstrong's younger sister?
{145079}{145195}Then I will tell you her|Christian and her maiden name.
{145199}{145267}When I asked the Princess|Dragomiroff if she could tell me
{145271}{145386}the maiden name of her|goddaughter, Mrs. Armstrong,
{145390}{145434}she could not possibly,|as a godmother,
{145438}{145482}plead ignorance of this.|She replied...
{145486}{145548}Greenwood.
{145582}{145683}Grunwald is the German|for Greenwood.
{145702}{145770}The princess's hesitation|persuades me
{145774}{145818}that Grunwald was|the true maiden name
{145822}{145890}of her goddaughter,|Mrs. Armstrong.
{145894}{145938}And that the Countess Andrenyi
{145942}{146055}is Mrs. Armstrong's|surviving younger sister.
{146158}{146226}Her Christian name is Helena.
{146230}{146274}Not Elena. No, no, no.
{146278}{146342}But Helena.
{146350}{146441}And where did she lose|her Christian name's initial H?
{146445}{146585}She lost it under a convenient grease|spot in her husband's passport.
{146589}{146681}And why was the grease|spot purposely applied?
{146685}{146777}Because she and her|husband were afraid
{146781}{146873}that this handkerchief,|bearing the initial H...
{146877}{146969}...might lead me to suspect her|of complicity in the murder.
{146973}{147017}I swear before God and on my|word of honor as a gentleman,
{147021}{147089}that this handkerchief|does not belong to my wife.
{147093}{147137}No, no, no, no, no, no.|Not at...
{147141}{147185}No. No.|No. No. No.
{147189}{147209}It does not.
{147213}{147305}No. Nor does it belong|to Mrs. Harriet Belinda Hubbard.
{147309}{147407}Nor to Fräulein Hildegarde Schmidt,
{147428}{147496}whose finest quality is her loyalty.
{147500}{147544}The initial is wrong.
{147548}{147592}What is the princess's first name?
{147596}{147710}Natalia, {y:i}mein Herr.|It is a Russian name.
{147716}{147760}In the Russian, or Cyrillic, alphabet,
{147764}{147832}their capital N
{147836}{147927}is written like our capital H.
{147956}{147976}{y:i}Madame la Princess,
{147980}{148072}should this costly handkerchief|cease to remain an exhibit,
{148076}{148144}it will be returned to your|loyal maid for laundering.
{148148}{148240}Or is Hildegarde Schmidt|really your maid?
{148244}{148359}I have, perhaps, a nose for the aura|of fine food and laid a trap.
{148363}{148431}You are a good cook,|are you not?
{148435}{148503}All my ladies have said so. I...
{148507}{148551}If you are a lady's maid,
{148555}{148647}your ladies never have a chance|of discovering if you are a good cook.
{148651}{148719}As good a cook as|Hildegarde Schmidt must have been
{148723}{148817}{y:i}to the Armstrong household.
{148843}{148887}{y:i}Enfin.
{148891}{148994}Who do we now|have here in this car...
{149035}{149127}...that could have known|or could have been involved
{149131}{149221}with the Armstrong household?
{149227}{149271}We have, one, Mr. McQueen,
{149275}{149343}who became boyishly|devoted to Mrs. Armstrong
{149347}{149390}at the time of the kidnapping.
{149394}{149438}Two, the Princess Dragomiroff,
{149442}{149486}who was Mrs. Armstrong's|devoted godmother.
{149490}{149534}Three, the Countess Andrenyi,
{149538}{149582}who was Mrs. Armstrong's|devoted younger sister.
{149586}{149630}Four, the Count Andrenyi,
{149634}{149678}who is Helena's devoted husband
{149682}{149750}and Mrs. Armstrong's|devoted brother-in-law.
{149754}{149750}Five, Hildegarde Schmidt, who was|Mrs. Armstrong's devoted cook.
{149754}{149846}Five, Hildegarde Schmidt, who was|Mrs. Armstrong's devoted cook.
{149850}{149966}Six, Mary Debenham, who was|Mrs. Armstrong's devoted secretary.
{149970}{150014}Miss Debenham's inclusion|is pure conjecture.
{150018}{150086}I did not have to ask Miss Debenham
{150090}{150158}if she had ever lived in America,
{150162}{150230}because during her|interrogation, she said...
{150234}{150302}I can always call my lawyers|long-distance.
{150306}{150397}An Englishwoman who had never|lived in America would have said,
{150401}{150521}"I can always make a trunk call|to my solicitors."
{150617}{150709}{y:i}Tout de même, I must thank|the pipe-smoking Colonel Arbuthnott,
{150713}{150829}for a remark which finally resolved|all my confusions about this...
{150833}{150901}This extraordinary case.
{150905}{150973}I prefer to set aside the fact
{150977}{151093}that he denied ever having spoken|to Colonel Armstrong in India.
{151097}{151165}And yet he remembered|in great detail
{151169}{151237}the decorations which|Colonel Armstrong had won
{151241}{151323}years earlier in France.
{151337}{151452}I prefer to remember his views|on the British jury system.
{151456}{151573}Trial by 12 good men and true|is a sound system.
{151600}{151687}The iron tongue of midnight
{151720}{151787}hath told 12.
{151816}{151836}Suddenly...
{151840}{151974}...the number 12 began to ring|in my head like a great bell.
{152008}{152052}Twelve.
{152056}{152148}Doctor, how many wounds|were there in Ratchett's body?
{152152}{152172}- Twelve.|- Mr. McQueen,
{152176}{152268}how many capital letters,|each inscribed by a different hand,
{152272}{152340}were contained in each|of the two threatening messages
{152344}{152435}you showed me on Ratchett's|correspondence file?
{152439}{152459}Twelve. Twelve.
{152463}{152531}Colonel Arbuthnott,|how many persons in a jury?
{152535}{152593}Twelve.
{152631}{152675}Pierre Paul Michel,
{152679}{152723}how many passengers|in the Calais coach,
{152727}{152795}excluding myself|and the murdered man?
{152799}{152867}Twelve, monsieur.
{152871}{152915}- Show me your wallet.|- No!
{152919}{153012}Mr. Hardman,|you may not speak.
{153039}{153131}Ratchett never asked you to be|his bodyguard, he asked me.
{153135}{153240}And I, perhaps to|my discredit, refused.
{153279}{153346}Before you joined Pinkerton's|as a private detective,
{153350}{153463}you were an ordinary policeman,|were you not?
{153494}{153553}A cop...
{153566}{153634}...who, as is customary with cops,
{153638}{153706}fell in love with
{153710}{153803}a pretty housemaid|on his beat.
{153878}{153970}Yes, and would have|married her...
{153974}{154033}...if...
{154142}{154258}Your daughter, Paulette,|never died of scarlet fever, did she?
{154262}{154330}No, she killed herself
{154334}{154425}when falsely accused|of complicity
{154429}{154519}in the kidnapping and killing
{154525}{154610}of little Daisy Armstrong.
{154885}{154943}They...
{154957}{155073}They could not have done it|without you, could they?
{155077}{155121}You.
{155125}{155265}The procurer of this disguise for|the mysterious member of the Mafia,
{155269}{155289}who never existed
{155293}{155384}any more than the owner|of this kimono existed
{155388}{155456}as a real character and not as a red|herring to confuse and deceive me.
{155460}{155567}Although I think|that I was not deceived.
{155580}{155667}I have, how shall I put it,
{155676}{155720}an eye for the...
{155724}{155792}For the figure|of a receding woman.
{155796}{155864}Countess, your cosmopolitan accent
{155868}{155936}showed an inherited ability...
{155940}{156028}...from your actress mother.
{156060}{156168}But God knows|from what implausible source
{156180}{156248}Miss Greta Ohlsson...
{156252}{156392}...learned her English vocabulary,|too ludicrous to be credited.
{156443}{156487}I was born backwards.
{156491}{156583}That is why I work in Africa|as missionary,
{156587}{156679}teaching little brown babies|more backwards than myself.
{156683}{156751}You coined words like "bed gown",
{156755}{156847}and yet you understand|words like "emolument".
{156851}{156919}I truly believe you did look after|little brown babies at your mission
{156923}{156991}in Shimoga, which is in India,|by the way, you know.
{156995}{157039}It's not Africa.
{157043}{157087}But I believe you|were covering up
{157091}{157159}for once, years earlier,|when you were in America,
{157163}{157255}having looked after a little|white baby called Daisy...
{157259}{157327}...whose death, though you|could do nothing to prevent it,
{157331}{157398}so preyed on your mind that you|sought refuge in a vision of Jesus.
{157402}{157446}And your future as a missionary,
{157450}{157542}looking after little brown babies,|was sealed.
{157546}{157614}You. You were lucky
{157618}{157686}only to be bound and gagged,
{157690}{157734}not crushed like the manservant.
{157738}{157782}- Mr. Beddoes.|- Sir.
{157786}{157854}You served with the|British army in Scotland.
{157858}{157902}Colonel Armstrong|was in the Royal Scots.
{157906}{158046}Would you kindly give Dr. Constantine|your deepest butler's bow?
{158074}{158142}Yes, there is an old contusion.
{158146}{158214}The result of a slight fracas|in the mess, sir,
{158218}{158310}with regard to the quality of a pudding|known as spotted dick.
{158314}{158429}Thank you, but I think|you've been spotted too.
{158433}{158525}Mr. Foscarelli is very knowledgeable|about automobiles.
{158529}{158621}I suspected that perhaps he had|once been Armstrong's chauffeur.
{158625}{158693}I asked if he had ever|been in private service.
{158697}{158741}No.
{158745}{158813}I think Mr. Foscarelli's|appalling English is more genuine
{158817}{158861}than Miss Ohlsson's,|but I think he meant yes.
{158865}{158933}- Think, monsieur?|- Think, think. Yes, think!
{158937}{159005}What else can be done on a train|isolated by a snowdrift?
{159009}{159077}If all these people are not|implicated in the crime,
{159081}{159149}then why have they all told me,|under interrogation,
{159153}{159197}stupid and often unnecessary lies?
{159201}{159221}Why? Why? Why? Why?
{159225}{159293}Doubtless, Monsieur Poirot,|because they did not expect you
{159297}{159412}to be on the train. They had no|time to concert their cover story.
{159416}{159542}I was hoping someone|other than myself would say that.
{159584}{159628}Ladies and gentlemen,
{159632}{159700}we now come|to my own reconstruction
{159704}{159794}of the night of the murder...
{159896}{159996}...or the night of the red herrings.
{160040}{160108}I only wish...
{160280}{160377}I only wish I could describe it...
{160423}{160491}...with the incomparable panache...
{160495}{160563}...the consummate verve,
{160567}{160659}the enthralling cadences,|the delicate gestures,
{160663}{160731}the evocative expressions of|America's greatest tragic actress,
{160735}{160803}Harriet Belinda.
{160807}{160879}Miss Linda Arden.
{160903}{160947}I've always heard she wanted|to play comedy parts,
{160951}{160995}but her husband|wouldn't have it.
{160999}{161019}Which husband?|Your second husband, Mr. Hubbard?
{161023}{161115}Which husband?|Your second husband, Mr. Hubbard?
{161119}{161163}Or your first husband,
{161167}{161211}Mr. Grunwald?
{161215}{161307}Linda Arden, the actress,|never played as difficult a role
{161311}{161447}as Mrs. Hubbard, the organizer|of this extraordinary revenge.
{161502}{161594}Dare I deduce that the great|Linda Arden has been cured
{161598}{161714}of her incurable disease|and is no longer bedridden?
{161718}{161786}It is I who should be committed|to a bed in a mental home.
{161790}{161882}It is I who need a cure|for being so slow
{161886}{161930}to notice the tricks|that were being played on me
{161934}{162037}with regard to the time|of the murder.
{162102}{162220}- Will there be anything more, sir?|- There will.
{162270}{162361}Tell Mr. McQueen|I wanna see him, now.
{162365}{162409}Very good, sir.
{162413}{162481}"And six beakers, stop.
{162485}{162553}"Only five, repeat,|five beakers were delivered.
{162557}{162625}"One, repeat, one badly chipped,
{162629}{162721}"which will be returned|on receipt of replacement
{162725}{162745}"to my Paris address.
{162749}{162824}"Signed, Ratchett."
{162869}{162950}OK, Hector, that's all.
{163037}{163081}Good night, Mr. Ratchett.
{163085}{163160}Good night, Hector.
{166681}{166725}{y:i}Ce n'est rien.
{166729}{166814}{y:i}C'etait un cauchemar.
{166825}{166869}{y:i}Bien, Mr. Ratchett.
{166873}{166968}May you now have|pleasant dreams.
{167616}{167684}At 1:15 came Mrs. Hubbard's|announcement
{167688}{167708}that there was|a man in her room,
{167712}{167804}who had, for reasons which I dare|not even guess, shed a button.
{167808}{167876}The next morning,|the murder was discovered.
{167880}{167972}Dr. Constantine sets|the time of the murder
{167976}{168044}anywhere between|midnight and 2 a.m.
{168048}{168140}Now, I came to various conclusions.
{168144}{168236}The clumsy cliché|of the smashed watch
{168240}{168284}registering 1:15
{168288}{168408}had been done deliberately|to excite my disbelief.
{168431}{168499}And since Mr. McQueen|had overemphatically said
{168503}{168571}that Ratchett spoke|no languages,
{168575}{168643}I was being deliberately|maneuvered into believing
{168647}{168691}that Ratchett was already dead
{168695}{168787}when a voice cried out|from his room in French.
{168791}{168811}In other words,
{168815}{168859}I was being forced|into the theory
{168863}{168955}that the murder was|committed before 1:15.
{168959}{169103}A period for which every single|one of you had an unshakable alibi.
{169127}{169171}But...
{169175}{169308}...supposing that the crime|had not been committed earlier,
{169319}{169399}but later than 1:15...
{169414}{169458}...when all the noises and incidents
{169462}{169554}designed to confuse me|had died down.
{169558}{169645}And I had lapsed into sleep
{169678}{169770}because the train was now silent...
{169774}{169845}...and at peace.
{169870}{169935}Silent, yes.
{169966}{170033}At peace, no.
{170038}{170129}By 2:00, the murder was afoot.
{170182}{170247}Envisage it.
{170973}{171017}For my daughter.
{171021}{171093}My granddaughter.
{171404}{171472}In memory of Colonel Armstrong...
{171476}{171496}...a great soldier
{171500}{171587}and an even greater friend.
{171692}{171760}And for Mrs. Armstrong.
{171764}{171878}They took me into their home|and their hearts.
{172004}{172088}For their Daisy and mine.
{172124}{172201}Oh, God, forgive me.
{172531}{172599}For my...|My sister and my...
{172603}{172664}...niece.
{172699}{172743}Cassetti.
{172747}{172860}For the grief you brought|to my beloved wife.
{173011}{173081}{y:i}Vigliacco.
{173299}{173373}{y:i}Schweinehund.
{173490}{173577}For my beloved goddaughter.
{173874}{173942}For Mother Armstrong...
{173946}{174016}...from Hector.
{174210}{174282}For my gentleman.
{174521}{174565}To Paulette,
{174569}{174631}with love.
{174809}{174853}And with mine,
{174857}{174901}God rest the soul
{174905}{174990}of my dear, dead daughter.
{175744}{175808}I repeat...
{175816}{175884}...a repulsive murderer
{175888}{175932}has himself
{175936}{176027}been repulsively and, perhaps,
{176032}{176100}deservedly murdered.
{176104}{176225}But in which of the two ways|that I have suggested?
{176248}{176316}In the simpler way,|by the Mafioso
{176320}{176411}disguised as|a wagon-lit conductor?
{176415}{176542}Or in the more complex way|that I have just outlined...
{176607}{176723}...which involves many questions|and, of course...
{176727}{176809}...considerable scandal?
{176823}{176939}Signor Bianchi, it is for you,|as a director of the line,
{176943}{177011}to choose the solution that we shall|offer to the police at Brod.
{177015}{177083}Though I confess...
{177087}{177165}...I am in two minds.
{177183}{177247}Though I...
{177279}{177370}I think the police at Brod|would prefer
{177374}{177475}the simplicity of the first solution.
{177806}{177886}We have the uniform...
{177902}{177970}...to show the police.
{177974}{178018}If we have the uniform,
{178022}{178090}there must have|been a man in it.
{178094}{178161}So therefore,
{178166}{178234}I elect the first solution.
{178238}{178302}Here, here.
{178885}{178929}Hercule.
{178933}{178998}I thank you.
{179005}{179049}My friend.
{179053}{179145}Now I must go and wrestle|with my report to the police
{179149}{179230}and with my conscience.
{179388}{179443}Mama.

Somewhere in the vaults
of a bank in London
is a tin dispatch box with my name on it.
It is not to be opened
until 50 years after my death.
It contains certain mementos
of my long association
with a man who elevated
the science of deduction to an art.
The world's first and, undeniably,
most famous consulting detective.
To my heirs.
In my lifetime,
I have recorded some 60 cases
demonstrating the singular gift
of my friend Sherlock Holmes,
dealing with everything from
the Hound of the Baskervilles
to his mysterious brother Mycroft
and the devilish Professor Moriarty.
But there were other adventures which,
for reasons of discretion,
I have decided to withhold
from the public until this much later date.
They involve matters of a delicate
and sometimes scandalous nature,
as will shortly become apparent.
It was August of 1887,
and we were returning from Yorkshire,
where Holmes had solved
the baffling murder of Admiral Abernetty.
You may recall that
he broke the murderer's alibi
by measuring the depth to which
the parsley had sunk in the butter
on a hot day.
I wish you'd give me a bit more warning when you come home unexpected.
I'd have roasted a goose, had a few flowers for you.
My dear Mrs Hudson, criminals are as unpredictable as head colds.
- You never know when you'll catch one.
- I'll unpack your bags.
Here's an advance copy of Strand Magazine.
They've printed The Red-Headed League.
Would you like to see how I've treated it?
I can hardly wait. I'm sure I shall find out all sorts about the case that I never knew.
- Just what do you mean by that?
- You have a tendency to overromanticise.
You've taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them,
- embroidered them, exaggerated...
- I deny the accusation.
- You say I'm 6'4"whereas I'm barely 6'1".
- A bit of poetic licence.
You saddled me with an improbable costume which I'm now expected to wear.
- It's not my doing. Blame the illustrator.
- You've made me out a violin virtuoso.
There's an invitation from the
Liverpool Symphony to appear as soloist.
Really?
I could barely hold my own in a second-rate music hall.
You're much too modest.
You have given the reader the distinct impression that I'm a misogynist.
Actually, I don't dislike women.
I merely distrust them.
The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup.
It's those little touches that make you colourful.
Lurid is more like it. You've painted me as a hopeless dope addict just because I occasionally take a five per cent solution of cocaine.
- A seven per cent solution.
- Five per cent.
Don't you think I'm aware you've been diluting it behind my back?
As a doctor, as well as your friend,
I strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours.
My dear friend, as well as my dear doctor,
I only resort to narcotics when I'm suffering from acute boredom, when there are no interesting cases to engage my mind. Look at this.
An urgent appeal to find some missing midgets.
- Did you say midgets?
- Mm. Six of them.
The Tumbling Piccolos, an acrobatic act with some circus.
Disappeared between London and Bristol.
Well, don't you find that intriguing?
Extremely so.
You see, they are not only midgets,
- but also anarchists.
- Anarchists?
By now they'll have been smuggled to
Vienna, dressed as little girls in pinafores.
They are to greet the tsar of all the Russias at the railway station.
They will be carrying bouquets of flowers, and concealed in each bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse.
- You really think so?
- Not at all.
The circus owner offers me five pounds.
That's not even a pound a midget.
Obviously he's a stingy blighter and the little chaps ran off to join another circus.
It sounded so promising.
There are no great crimes any more, Watson.
The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality.
At best, they commit some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official could see through it.
Mrs Hudson! Mrs Hudson!
Yes. What is it? What have I done now?
- Something is missing from my desk.
- Missing?
- Something very crucial.
- What?
Dust! You have been tidying up against my explicit orders.
Oh, look, I made sure
I hadn't disturbed anything.
Dust, Mrs Hudson, is an essential part of my filing system.
By the thickness of it
I can date any document.
Well, some of the dust was this thick.
That would be... March 1883.
Oh!
How can you stand this?
Why don't you let me air the room out?
Please, Mrs Hudson, he's working on a definitive study of tobacco ash.
Oh, I'm sure there's a crying need for that.
In our endeavours it is sometimes vital to distinguish between, say, the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar.
So far he has classified
140 different kinds of ashes.
All of which'll wind up on my rug.
That will be enough, Mrs Hudson.
All right. If you gentlemen want to stay and suffocate.
- She's right, I am suffocating.
- Oh, let me open the window.
Not from lack of air, from lack of activity.
Blowing smoke rings, staring through a microscope. There's no challenge in that.
Personally, I consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology.
- How I envy you your mind, Watson.
- You do?
It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic.
My mind rebels against stagnation. It's like a racing engine tearing itself to pieces because it's not connected up with the work for which it was built.
Holmes?
Holmes. Where's your self-control?
Fair question.
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Thoroughly. But this will take care of it.
There was nothing I could do when
he went on one of his cocaine binges
except hope and pray that some case
would come along to snap him out of it.
Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes?
Why won't you go?
It's the final performance of the lmperial Russian Ballet.
The house has been sold out for months.
Tickets are going at a guinea apiece.
That's just it. Why should someone send us two free tickets? Anonymously, at that.
Whoever sent them must be in great distress. The note says:
"Please! You are the only man in the world who can help me."
- I suspect it's some sort of plot.
- Somebody wants to lure us into a trap?
- Somebody wants to kill me.
- Kill you?
That's right. It's a plot to bore me to death. I detest ballet.
But this isn't just any ballet... it's Swan Lake.
You know, of course, Holmes, that swan isn't really a swan.
- It's an enchanted princess.
- Hm.
Fabulous woman, don't you think so, Holmes?
- Who?
- The great Petrova.
Very strong arches, I must admit.
- They say 12 men have died for her.
- Really?
Six committed suicide, four were killed in duels, and one fell out of the gallery of the Vienna Opera House.
That's only 11.
The man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra.
That makes an even dozen.
In a messy sort of way.
- Mr Holmes?
- Yes.
I am Nikolai Rogozhin, director-general of the lmperial Russian Ballet.
- So glad you accept invitation.
- This is Dr Watson.
Pleased to meet you.
- You are enjoying?
- Immensely.
Tell me, Mr Holmes, how is your health?
My health? Better consult my doctor.
Oh, he's in excellent shape.
Any insanity in your family?
Diabetes, asthma?
- Would you tell me what this is all about?
- Certainly.
Madame Petrova... she has problem.
- Can you be more specific?
- Certainly not.
Liaison with a crowned head?
Compromising letters? Blackmail?
After performance there will be little celebration backstage and Madame requests your presence.
We'd be delighted.
You are invited also.
Ah!
Mr Holmes, Madame is expecting you in her dressing room.
Dr Watson, you will amuse yourself.
- We have vodka, caviar, girls.
- No, thank you.
- No girls?
- No caviar - makes me break out in hives.
Poznakomtes s doktorom Watsonom.
Any of you girls understand English?
Nyet.
- Not one single word?
- Nyet.
In that case, I don't mind telling you that you all have lovely po-pos.
Mr Holmes, I must prepare you.
This is not ordinary case.
It's only the extraordinary that interests me.
Good. Because you will find this extra-extraordinary.
May I present Madame Petrova.
Madame.
Madame says you are shorter than she thought.
Oh, I didn't mean to be.
Short, tall, who cares?
It is the brains that count.
Thank you. Thank you.
...Baskerville.
Madame is great admirer of yours. She has read every story. Her favourite is...
Big Dog From Baskerville.
I'm afraid it loses something in translation.
Nikolai...
Mr Holmes, you know about fiddles.
What is your opinion of this?
"Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis."
"Anno 1709."
Well, the label is authentic.
Judging from the shape, colour of the varnish and the tone,
I would say it is a genuine
Stradivarius of the best period.
- You like?
- Oh, it's magnificent.
Nikolai.
Here, take it.
- Madame says it is yours.
- Mine?
For services you will render.
My fees as a detective are not exactly trifling, but a Stradivarius?
- You're not serious?
- I am not.
But Madame is.
All right. I will pour vodka and explain.
Mr Holmes, what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of Madame Petrova.
- She is retiring.
- What a shame.
She has been dancing since she was three. And, after all, she is now 38.
I must say, she doesn't look 38.
That is because she is 49.
Madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her child.
- How admirable.
- Problem is, how to find father.
- Is he missing?
- Correct.
- And that's why you've called me in.
- Also correct.
We must have father because, without father, how could there be child?
I see. The whole thing is still in the planning stage.
Correct again. Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful.
Since she is beautiful she needs man who is brilliant.
- What's in it?
- What does it taste like?
- Red pepper.
- That's what's in it.
I beg your pardon?
- When can you be ready?
- Ready?
To leave for Venice. You will spend one week there with Madame.
This is very flattering, but surely there are other, better men?
To tell truth, you were not the first choice.
We considered Russian writer, Tolstoy.
That's more like it.
The man's a genius.
Too old. Then we considered philosopher, Nietzsche.
- Absolutely first-rate mind.
- Too German.
Then we considered Tchaikovsky.
- You couldn't go wrong with Tchaikovsky.
- We could. And we did.
It was catastrophe.
- Why?
- You don't know?
Because Tchaikovsky is...
How shall I put it?
Women, not his glass of tea.
Oh, pity, that.
Madame is very happy with her final choice.
Madame must not be too hasty. She must remember that I am an Englishman.
- So?
- You know what they say.
The one thing more deplorable than our cooking is our lovemaking.
- We are not the most romantic of people.
- Perfect.
We don't want sentimental idiots falling in love, committing suicide.
One week in Venice with Madame, she goes back to St Petersburg with baby, you go back to London with fiddle.
An equitable arrangement.
About my medical history...
When you asked me I neglected to mention one small detail.
- There is haemophilia in my family.
- Huh?
We are all bleeders.
- Not to worry, she will not scratch you.
- That's reassuring, but...
Madame says you talk too much.
You find her attractive or no?
Well, I, er...
Oh, excuse me.
What does prokaznik mean?
It means "you little devil".
It does? I am? Thank you!
I repeat question.
You find Madame attractive or no?
Oh, I find her most attractive.
- For a woman, that is.
- Then no problem.
Maybe a slight one.
You see, I am not a free man.
Not free? But you are bachelor.
A bachelor living with another bachelor for the last five years.
Five very happy years.
What is it you are trying to tell us?
Well, I hoped I could avoid the subject, but, some of us, through a cruel caprice of Mother Nature...
Get to point.
The point is that Tchaikovsky is not an isolated case.
You mean you and Doctor Watson?
He... is your glass of tea?
If you want to be picturesque about it.
...Tchaikovsky?
Believe me, Madame, the loss is all mine.
But I would rather disappoint you now than in a gondola in Venice.
It would have been... catastrophe.
- Watson! Are you coming?
- What is it?
- We're going home.
- Home?
Not a chance. Not the slightest, not the remotest chance. Toodle-oo!
Hold on.
Just one moment.
What's going on?
- What happened to the girls?
- Why? Do you not prefer it this way?
- What way?
- You don't have to pretend.
Mr Holmes told us everything.
- About you and him.
- About me and him?
Come! No need to be bashful.
We're not bourgeois.
Maybe between doctors and detectives is unusual, but in ballet... is very usual.
What is?
Caprice of Mother Nature.
Look at Pavel and Mischa,
Boris and Dimitry and Illya and Sergei.
Sergei... half and half.
Holmes!
Holmes!
There you are! You wretch!
You... rotter! You blackguard!
Of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications!
What do you have to say for yourself?
Well, don't just sit there! Speak up, man!
Holmes?
Are you all right, Holmes?
Holmes?
From the sound of your footsteps I gather you're not in a particularly amiable mood.
How... how could you invent such a dastardly lie?
What the deuce were you thinking of?
Watson, you have my most abject apologies, but have you ever been cornered by a madwoman?
It seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings.
And what about my feelings?
And my reputation?
Do you realise the gravity of this?
The possible repercussions?
- So there'll be a little gossip about you.
- These things spread like wildfire.
I can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back.
I'll never be able to show my face in polite society.
And if it ever got back to my old regiment...
You don't know the Fifth Northumberland
Fusiliers! They'll strike me off the rolls!
- They'll cut off my pension!
- Watson, you're running amok.
Dishonoured, disgraced, ostracised.
- What am I to do?
- For one thing, I'd get rid of that flower.
You may think this is funny but we're both in the same boat.
We must take desperate measures.
We must stop this talk.
Maybe if we got married.
Then they'd really talk.
Obviously, we can't continue to live under the same roof. We must move apart.
Of course, we can still see each other clandestinely on remote benches in Hyde Park and in the waiting rooms of suburban stations.
This whole thing's ridiculous.
- We have nothing to hide.
- That's what I tried to tell you.
Let somebody start a rumour. Just one ugly word, we'll sue 'em for slander.
No one would dare. After all, you have an enviable record with the fair sex.
Damn right. I can get women from three continents to testify for me.
And you can get women to vouch for you too, can't you, Holmes?
Can you, Holmes?
Good night, Watson.
Holmes?
Let me ask you a question.
I hope I'm not being presumptuous, but there have been women in your life?
The answer is yes... you're being presumptuous.
Good night.
Holmes?
What, indeed, was his attitude
towards women?
Was there some secret
he was holding back?
Or was he just a thinking machine,
incapable of any emotion?
I was not to get the answer
until we became involved
in what I consider to be the most
outrageous case in all our years together.
- Were you expecting someone?
- Not at this hour.
Maybe Mrs Hudson is entertaining.
I've never found her so.
- I don't know.
- Can I speak to the master?
- He's in bed.
- It's important.
- What is it, Mrs Hudson?
- A cabby says you owe him two and six.
- For what?
- For the fare, guv'nor.
- The young lady don't have no money.
- What young lady?
This one.
Well. What have we here?
Who are you, miss?
What happened to you?
I don't know.
It's all she keeps saying.
"I don't know, I don't know".
- Where did she come from?
- The river.
I was driving down the embankment, just below Westminster Bridge.
There she was, in the water, drowning.
Wasn't easy, guv'nor, what with the cold water and her fighting me.
Why did you bring her here?
Because... I found this in her hand.
"221 b Baker Street."
That's right, isn't it?
Young lady, what did you want at this address?
I do not remember.
- Rather perplexing, wouldn't you say?
- Rather.
Well, gentlemen.
You want her, it's two and six.
- Or shall I throw her back in the river?
- Mr Holmes, you can't let him do that.
Watson, you'd better accept delivery.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, guv'nor.
No extra charge for the use of the horse blanket.
You're shivering, my dear.
Let me get you out of those wet clothes.
Sit here, my dear.
She's suffering from shock and exposure.
There was some printing on the back but it seems to have come off in the water.
Look at this.
She's had a nasty blow on the head.
Could she have hit her head when she fell or jumped into the river?
No. The blood had already coagulated.
So it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack.
Get my bag, will you?
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr Watson.
And this is Sherlock Holmes.
- Do the names mean anything to you?
- No.
Think.
I'm trying.
Can you think of your own name?
No.
She's obviously had a concussion, which often leads to temporary amnesia.
So all we know is she was coshed on the head, dumped into the Thames and subsequently dumped into our laps.
We know a lot more than that.
From her accent, we know she's foreign.
From her ring, we know she's married.
- There's one other clue we have.
- Namely?
Something I deduced while I was helping her up the stairs.
No corset.
Good work.
"La Femme Elegante."
Are you French?
Vous êtes Française?
Non. Je ne suis pas Française.
How can she say she's not French, in French?
Vous êtes Suisse?
Non.
Alors, vous êtes Belge?
Je ne suis pas sûre.
Vous êtes Belge, de Bruxelles?
Bruxelles.
Oui. Je pense que oui.
Oh, dash.
- Will someone remove this violin, please?
- We just found out she's Belgian.
- Poor thing.
- From Brussels.
If you don't mind.
Is your name Gabrielle?
Gabrielle?
I don't know.
- And your husband's name is Emile.
- Emile.
- Where is he? Why are you in London?
- I don't know.
When did you arrive from Brussels?
Where are you staying?
- I don't know!
- What happened at the river?
Think!
Pensez!
Concentrez-vous!
That's enough, Holmes. I will not permit you to question her in this condition.
Here, Mrs Hudson.
Put her to bed. My bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.
- Come on, dear. Don't cry.
- I'd better give her a sleeping draught.
- I think we should take her to a hospital.
- Under no circumstances.
- She needs medical attention.
- She's got me.
More important, she must be protected.
There's already been one attempt on her.
- How temporary is temporary amnesia?
- It depends on the extent of her injury.
It's like veils, shrouding her memory.
It could clear up in a few days or a few weeks.
This is a very small flat.
We don't want to clutter it up with women.
Holmes, we've never had a case like this.
A woman comes with a problem, we don't know who she is or what the problem is.
- Don't you find that challenging?
- Quite.
But we can't wait for these veils to lift. We must break them as quickly as possible.
- You really feel it's that urgent?
- I do.
The sooner we solve the case, the sooner we can get rid of her.
Oh.
Emile?
Emile?
Emile!
Is that you, Emile?
Yes, Gabrielle.
Oh, Emile. I thought
I would never find you. Oh!
Hold me. Hold me tight.
It's been such a long time.
So many nights.
Do you know what I did before I left Bruxelles?
- What?
- I hope you're not going to be angry.
I bought myself an expensive negligee.
Did you?
A pink negligee.
With marabou feathers.
Don't you think it's a little bit foolish for a married woman?
Come.
Come.
- Where is the negligee?
- In my luggage. Come here.
And where is your luggage?
I don't know.
Come, my love.
Come. Come here. Please. Oh, please.
Come here.
What is it, Emile?
What are you doing?
Dr Watson!
Ooh.
Porridge is getting lumpy.
Hadn't you better get up?
I would like to very much, but...
Would you mind planting your knee in the small of my back?
- Yes, I would.
- Please. I'm in excruciating pain.
A bit higher.
Just below my seventh vertebra.
That's good. Put your arms under mine.
Now fold them behind my neck.
Now give it a good snap.
No, no. Show no mercy, bear down on me.
Ow!
Bless you. That damn couch.
Oh, you'd better see if our patient is awake.
Dr Watson.
She's gone.
Gone?
Holmes! Holmes!
She's gone!
Well, I never.
Mm. I smell porridge.
Lumpy as usual, I suppose.
Ah, there you are.
We were just wondering...
We certainly were.
Mrs Hudson, why don't you go down to the kitchen, get a towel, and wipe that look of disapproval off your face.
Hmph.
Liberties. In my house.
You can't really blame her.
I mean, the way it looks.
If I didn't know you better,
I might suspect you'd taken advantage.
As a matter of fact, I did.
Would you hand me the butter knife?
Of course.
- You did what?
- Thank you.
Holmes, this is reprehensible.
Where are your professional ethics?
Have you no sense of decency, no shame?
None whatsoever. If you must know,
I found her body quite rewarding.
- You cad!
- Especially the palm of her right hand.
I'd rather not hear about it.
Then I won't bother to tell you how I traced her suitcase.
- That's hers?
- Remember the piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it?
It was a luggage ticket.
The number had rubbed off on her hand.
Since she must have come by the boat train,
I concluded that she checked her belongings at Victoria Station.
By Jove! If you're right, we should find a clue to her identity.
Or at least a pink negligee with marabou feathers.
- Voilà.
- Well, let's see, what else is in here?
Ah!
Now we're getting somewhere.
Ah.
Who do you suppose this is?
Good morning, Madame Valladon.
- You are Gabrielle Valladon?
- Yes.
And this is your husband, Emile Valladon?
Yes.
Sorry to have ransacked your valise, but since you came to us for help...
- Where am I?
- 221 b Baker Street.
Oh, yes.
Which of you is Sherlock Holmes, and which is Dr Watson?
Dr Watson is the handsome one.
Oh.
That's the way he affects most women.
Coffee. You want some strong coffee.
- Oh, it's all so confusing.
- Well, let's try to sort it out.
You came to London looking for your husband, right?
Yes.
He's a mining engineer. We were married five years ago in the Congo.
Where your husband was working in a copper mine.
- How did you know?
- Your wedding ring. It's made of copper.
Last year, he invented a new kind of air pump and was hired by an English company,
Jonah Limited.
Here we are.
Jonah Limited. Go on.
We'd been writing to each other regularly, then, suddenly, three weeks ago, his letters stopped.
I kept on writing but no answer.
So, finally, I decided to go to that address.
32 Ashdown Street.
Yes.
It's just an empty store.
Nobody there.
So I tried to find Jonah Limited.
- No such company exists.
- How decidedly odd.
Madame, can you think of any reason why your husband should have lied to you?
Emile? Never.
- He loves me and I love him.
- I gathered that much.
I went to the police. They said they would send out a missing persons report.
But they didn't sound too encouraging.
Then I went to the Belgian embassy.
- They suggested I should consult you.
- You could have done worse.
I was on my way here when, suddenly, there were footsteps behind me and a hand over my mouth and the smell of chloroform and the next thing I knew I was in the water.
And then a man was wrapping me in a blanket.
Somebody tried to kill you last night. Do you have any idea who could've done it?
I don't understand any of it.
What does it all mean, Mr Holmes?
Where's my husband?
- You must help me find him.
- We'll do our best, I assure you.
Madame Valladon, I want you to send one more letter to your husband.
To Emile Valladon, Ashdown Street.
What was that number?
32. What do you want me to say in the letter?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Holmes. You're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop?
That shop is obviously being used as an accommodation address or letter drop.
But what gets dropped must be picked up.
The question is, how, and by whom, and why.
Hammer.
Chisel.
Here.
It's so strange to think I've been writing to a place like this all these months.
Look. Canaries. Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop?
Maybe.
Shh!
Here comes our letter.
Well, now we are faced with the most nerve-wracking part of a detective's job.
Doing nothing. Just waiting.
Mr Holmes? I don't know how
I'm going to pay for all this.
My money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames.
It could be worse. You could be there too, much to your discomfort, and much to my chagrin.
I don't understand how anybody picks up letters here.
There's no footprints. Just tracks.
What does it mean?
I'd surmise somebody is using ice skates if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.
What do we do now?
This way.
Good morning, my pretties.
Here's Mum with your breakfast.
Did you think I'd forgotten you?
Some of you will be going on a little trip soon, eh?
I hate to lose you, but even an old woman's got to live.
Although you might well ask why.
Ooh.
You never told me. We have a letter.
Oh!
- Got it?
- Yeah, I've got it.
Right, open the cage.
- Morning, duchess.
- Good morning.
- What've you been doing with yourself?
- What do you think?
Taking dancing lessons.
- How many do you want this time?
- Two dozen.
Two dozen? What are you doing with all those canaries? What goes on up there?
Look, duchess, we don't know.
And we don't want to know.
When you work for Jonah, it's better not to ask questions.
Six, eight, ten. Get in there!
- In you go. 20.
- How about that letter? Does that go too?
- No.
This is going to be picked up in person.
Right, I've got it.
Right, up.
All right, my pretties, back to sleep you go.
Oh!
- I really thought we were done for.
- The art of concealment, my dear Watson, is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time.
Did you hear what she said?
You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself?
It certainly would simplify things, wouldn't it?
Letter drops, wheelchairs, canaries.
What was all that about Jonah? What are they doing up there? Where's up there?
My guess would be Scotland.
- Inverness to be more precise.
- Inverness?
Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage?
The Inverness Courier.
Mr Holmes. This letter.
What about it?
It is addressed to you.
To me?
- That's impossible. We sent it ourselves.
- Nevertheless.
"My dear Sherlock, I expect you and Dr Watson to join me at the club immediately upon receipt of this note."
"According to my calculations that should be at 11.40 am."
"Your brother, Mycroft."
- What time do you make it, Watson?
Either your watch is wrong or Mycroft has miscalculated.
And, knowing Mycroft,
I suggest you reset your watch.
Holmes. I don't mind telling you,
I'm a bit apprehensive about this.
I'm curious myself to know what's going on in his Machiavellian mind.
Not Mycroft, Madame Valladon.
Don't worry.
She'll be perfectly safe with Mrs Hudson.
- To see Mr Mycroft Holmes.
- Right you are, sir.
He's expecting you in the upstairs study.
Now, if you gentlemen will sign in.
Surname, Christian name, address...
Oh!
Gentlemen!
Hm. Jamaican, no doubt.
Either Tropical or Gonosina.
I'm not quite sure.
Come in. Come in, Sherlock,
Dr Watson. Sit down.
- You're looking very fit, both of you.
- Thank you.
- How are you, Mycroft? How's your gout?
- Under control.
Except for an occasional twinge.
I've got a treat for you.
Very old Madeira. 1814.
Only six bottles in the world.
I've got two and I'm negotiating for a third.
If you don't mind my saying so, anyone susceptible to gout shouldn't be...
My last doctor was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel and was run over by a delivery van from
Fortnum and Mason. Your good health.
Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us?
I see you so rarely.
How long has it been?
Not since the Case of the Greek Interpreter.
Isn't it ridiculous?
Two brothers in the same town...
In the same town perhaps, but not in the same world.
This is superb.
How old did you say it was?
1814. One year before Waterloo.
One year before Waterloo. Think of that!
You do know where Waterloo is, don't you, Doctor?
Er, why, it's... it's in Belgium, isn't it?
Quite. And speaking of Belgium, it's come to my attention that you are interested
- in the whereabouts of a certain engineer.
- Yes, I am.
- Well, I can save you a lot of trouble.
- I'd be grateful for any suggestion.
My suggestion is that you pursue it no further.
- For any particular reason?
- It involves the national security.
- We are handling the matter ourselves.
- We? Who's we?
- The Diogenes Club.
- I didn't say that.
I've long suspected some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and Whitehall.
- That is neither here nor there.
- Your club is here, there and everywhere.
When there are rumblings of revolt in the
Sudan an expedition funded by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile.
If there's trouble along the Indian frontier, members pop up in the Himalayas, allegedly looking for the abominable snowman.
What a vivid imagination my brother has.
At five, by observing a neighbour's house, he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork but by the midwife in her bag.
- Yes, Wiggins?
- An immediate answer is requested, sir.
Oh, yes.
Hm.
The three boxes go to Glennahurich, the red runner to the castle.
The boxes to Glennahurich, the red runner to the castle. Very good, sir.
Why don't you crumple it up and swallow it, just to make sure?
Certain affairs do not come within the province of the private detective.
They have to be dealt with on an altogether different level.
- You want me to stay within my limits.
- I do indeed.
And speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah Limited?
When I said drop this case, it was not merely a suggestion, it was an order.
- By whose authority?
- Her Majesty's Government.
I hope I have made myself clear.
- Perfectly.
- And now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
- Goodbye, sir.
- A pleasure, as always.
Just a minute.
You forgot your tool kit.
You will be gentle when you tell her you're dropping the case?
- What does "Glennahurich" suggest?
- Absolutely nothing.
It's Scottish. And like all Scottish names it's really a word picture.
Glen means "valley", na means "of the", and hurrich, if memory serves me, means "yew tree".
You're just trying to impress me.
So, the three boxes go to the valley of the yew tree.
~ And I'll be in Scotland afore... ~
- You are dropping the case, aren't you?
- Open that door.
Don't shoot, you're liable to lose two excellent tenants.
Oh, at last.
- It's been a ghastly experience.
- Why? What happened?
Did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand?
You'll be relieved to know it was not loaded.
Holmes. Are you planning to disobey Mycroft's orders?
He's not just your brother. You'd be defying Her Majesty's Government.
Any news? Did you find out anything?
Let's just say I know what the next step will be.
- Yes?
- I want you to pack your things.
- Where are we going?
- Let me caution you.
At 7.30, we're going to take you to Victoria
Station and put you on the boat train.
- The boat train?
- Well, that's better.
- You're sending me back to Bruxelles?
- You must understand...
I came to find my husband.
You were going to help me.
Yes, but circumstances have changed.
The great detective.
Maybe this case is too small for you.
On the contrary, it's being handled...
I won't go back to Bruxelles.
Maybe you're giving up, but I am not.
I'm going to go on looking for him and nobody's going to stop me.
- Even if they try to kill me.
- Are you quite finished?
What I said was that we will put you on the boat train.
- I didn't say you would stay on it.
- She won't?
At 7.30, Mr Holmes and Dr Watson will be seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station.
At 8.12, Mr and Mrs Ashdown, accompanied by their valet, John, will appear at Euston Station and board the Highland Express to Inverness.
Mr and Mrs?
Thank you.
I'm sorry for what I said.
That's not necessary.
I'll go and pack.
Maybe I should do it since I'm the valet.
Holmes, exactly what are you up to?
As you like to put it in your chronicles, the game is afoot.
But what game? Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer, or is it the wife of the Belgian engineer?
- You don't like me very much, do you?
- Nothing of the sort. Quite the opposite.
But there's more to this case than meets the eye.
Looking for something?
Yes. My other glove.
Let me help you.
Here it is.
Thank you.
All right, you can look now.
- Am I embarrassing you, Mr Holmes?
- Not at all.
Would it surprise you if I told you
I once spent a night with 121 women?
Oh?
On a very interesting case in a harem in Constantinople.
I'm sorry, Father.
I mean, Friar.
Or is it Abbot?
Going to Scotland, you gentlemen?
So are we.
I'm a valet. My master and mistress and I are on our way to Inverness.
Ever been there? Beautiful country.
Oh, forgive me. You must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence.
Trappists, I think you're called.
I see you're reading the book of Jonah.
Funny, we were just talking about Jonah this morning.
Never mind.
Hm.
"Women are never to be entirely trusted, not the best of them."
- What did you say?
- I didn't say it, you did.
According to Dr Watson. He gave me some old copies of Strand Magazine.
The good doctor is constantly putting words into my mouth.
- Then you deny it?
- Not at all.
I am not a wholehearted admirer of womankind.
I'm not very fond of them myself.
The most affectionate woman
I ever knew was a murderess.
Oh?
It was one of those passionate affairs at odd hours right in my laboratory.
And all the time she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husband's steak and kidney pie.
- You mustn't judge all women by...
- Of course not.
Only the ones I was involved with.
And I don't just mean professionally.
Kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs...
- Take my fiancée, for instance.
- Your fiancée?
Mm.
She was the daughter of my violin teacher. We were engaged to be married.
The invitations were out,
I was being fitted for a tail coat, and 24 hours before the wedding she died of influenza.
I'm sorry.
It just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted.
Good night, Mrs Ashdown.
Good night, Mr Ashdown.
Die Spur führt nach Inverness.
Dort steigen die aus.
Dort müssen wir ihn finden, den Valladon.
- I will take that.
- Let's see now. One, two, three, four, five.
How do you get to Glennahurich?
How far is it?
- Glennahurich?
- You know, a valley with a yew tree.
It's about a mile out of the town.
Why do you want to go there?
It sounds like a peaceful place for a picnic.
It's peaceful, right enough, but it's no place for a picnic.
- Why not?
- Because it's a cemetery.
- The three boxes. Is that it, Holmes?
- I would think so.
The two small ones, they must be children's coffins.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with us all. Amen.
It's so sad.
Sad and rather odd.
There were no flowers and no mourners.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Working you hard?
- No, not really. This is healthy country.
Sometimes you sit for weeks with nothing to do then you get three in one day.
- What happened?
- An accident. Aye.
A father and two sons, they say.
They were found floating in the loch.
- Local people?
- No, no. No one round here knows them.
The story is their boat capsized in a swell, but I don't believe it.
What do you believe?
You may think I'm an old fool or an old drunk, but I've been living around Loch Ness all my life.
Are you trying to tell us it was the monster?
Damn right. MacLarnin saw the kids' faces when they were pulled out.
Looked just like old men.
They must have died of fright.
- That's incredible.
- Is it?
Last Easter Sunday, the wife and me, on our way to services, when suddenly...
Ah, what's the use?
- Here you are, Dad.
- Eh?
Oh.
Thank you. Thank you.
You seem like nice people.
If you want a holiday in Scotland, go to Loch Lomond, go to Holy Loch, but stay away from Loch Ness.
To think that people still believe in that nonsense. Here, in the 19th century.
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I was relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys.
- It's nothing to do with Emile.
- It appears not.
However, there still remains the clue of the castle.
And the red runner, whoever he may be.
If they're unidentified graves, why are those boys bringing flowers?
Because it's their brothers who have been buried.
- Their brothers?
- They're not boys.
They're as tall as they'll ever grow.
Hand me some pebbles.
Pebbles?
Take a look at their faces.
They are...
How do you call them in English? Nains?
Midgets.
- Boys with the faces of old men.
- I still don't see wh...
- Would it help to know they're acrobats?
- Not at all.
Do you remember a tumbling act, six brothers missing from the circus?
That case you turned down?
I completely forgot.
Some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper.
Stuck there is a staggering amount of miscellaneous data.
Mostly useless.
Mr Holmes.
- If those are not children, then...
- Quite.
The question now is, who's in the third grave?
Holmes! She's fainted!
Hand me that lantern.
It is Valladon, isn't it?
Obviously.
But what is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green.
And why there are three dead canaries in the coffin.
White canaries.
You've a lovely view of the loch from here.
As soon as the morning mist rolls away.
If you've a mind to go sightseeing, here's a guide to all the local points of interest.
Thank you.
This way, please.
I'll show you to your room.
I suppose you're putting me in the basement?
- No, your room's in the attic.
- Good.
It's the privy that's in the basement.
Oh.
May I have your wedding ring, please?
Just as I thought.
There is a distinct difference in colour between your ring and your husband's, which leads me to believe that the cause of death was not drowning.
I wish you would stop that.
Stop it!
If we are to continue, to find out what happened to your husband, you cannot act the grief-stricken widow.
I'm... sorry.
I know it's not easy, but remember we're a nice couple from London on holiday in the Highlands.
I'll try.
- That's much better.
- Thank you.
If I may proceed without further interruptions.
Mr Ashdown!
Mr Ashdown! Mr Ashdown!
Holmes, I saw it! I saw it from the attic window. It's out there in the lake!
- You saw what?
- Telescope. Where's the telescope?
What did you see?
- The monster!
- The monster?
There. There. There, there, there!
There it is! There it is!
Look for yourself. There it is.
There. There. There. See it?
There. See it?
I see nothing.
Nothing?
- It's gone.
- Maybe it was never there.
I swear to you,
I saw it as clear as anything.
Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we are living in the 19th century.
Maybe that gravedigger was right.
The swell, the boat overturning?
Valladon may have been in the lake but he did not drown. He died of asphyxiation.
Asphyxiation?
Only one substance can turn a copper ring green and bleach the colour out of canaries.
Chlorine gas.
Well, that may be, but the fact remains that I saw something out there.
A figment of your imagination.
Now, let us be logical.
The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle.
The question is... which castle?
You call yourself logical?
You're the least logical man I know.
Am I?
How can you say it's a figment of my imagination when for years you've been saying
I have no imagination whatsoever?
We have so far investigated eight draughty castles, had our bicycles attacked by sheep, our ears assaulted by bagpipes, and we are exactly where we started.
- Some more cranberry sauce, dear?
- Yes, dear.
- Pass the cranberry sauce, John.
- Yes, dear.
I say, there! Good afternoon!
Remember me?
There's some chaps I met on the train. We had a long conversation. Or, rather, I did.
Because they are not allowed to talk.
Trappists. Just study their bibles.
You'll never guess what the one next to me was reading. The book of Jonah.
- Isn't that odd?
- Quite.
- What is it, dear? What's the matter?
- Oh, a bee.
I don't think we have to bother with this castle. It's just a pile of rubble.
Then why are they taking all these precautions?
Why, indeed.
- Let's go.
- Go where?
When rebuffed at the front door, the only choice is to try the tradesman's entrance.
- Sorry. No visitors allowed.
- Are you the guide here?
- Yes. But the castle is closed for work.
- Why? What are they doing?
Restoration by the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments.
That's too bad. I wanted my wife to see Urquhart castle.
The tower is a most interesting example of medieval architecture.
- About 1400, wasn't it?
- That's right.
Let me see, was it built by James the Second or James the Third?
The Third. But if you'd like to come back next year we'll be finished and I'll be glad to show you round.
Thank you.
- Pleasant sort.
- Pleasant but ignorant.
He was off 100 years and one James.
It's actually 1500 and James the Fourth.
If he's an official guide, shouldn't he know?
If he's an official guide.
Listen. Do you hear anything, Watson?
No, those birds are making too much of a racket.
They're not just birds.
They're our old friends.
Sulphuric acid.
The more we find out the less sense it makes.
To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense.
Sulphuric acid, when exposed to salt water, produces chlorine gas.
John, would you mind clasping your hands, please?
- Like that?
- No, like that. Lower.
Thank you.
That tower may be more interesting than I thought.
And not just architecturally.
Holmes. I have a feeling we're redundant here.
We have now observed it from the front, the back, the side, from land, from water.
- What now? Spend the night out here?
- If necessary.
You're going to catch your death of cold, you know.
Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last case were a case of pneumonia?
Sorry.
What's that?
Holmes!
- There's...
- Quick, Watson! After it!
Holmes, what are we doing?
We should be going away from it!
- Keep rowing, dammit!
- Oh!
We've lost it.
At least you admit there is an "it".
Not just a figment of my imagination.
Quiet.
- Do you have your stethoscope with you?
- Never without it.
What is it?
I can hear something.
It's getting closer.
And closer.
Holmes!
Get back! Get back!
- Are you all right?
- I lost my parasol.
Where's Watson?
Watson?
Thank you.
I have come face to face with man-eating tigers.
I was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants. India, you know.
But I wasn't half as frightened. This beast seems to have a grudge against us.
I just hope it doesn't come back.
I don't think it will.
Look.
- What strange goings-on.
- Not really.
I would say that the monster, after a hard day's work, has returned home for his supper.
I know. Can you believe you can't borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place?
All right, Holmes. Want to confide in us?
When he whistles
I know he's close to a solution.
It's nothing new, actually.
We've come across this situation before.
- We have? Where?
- At the ballet.
There's a lake and there's a castle and there's a swan that isn't really a swan.
- Or a monster that isn't really a monster.
- Then what is it?
What is it indeed that feeds on canary birds and sulphuric acid
- and has an engine for a heart?
- An engine?
The stethoscope is a sensitive instrument and water is an excellent conductor.
There is no doubt that we are dealing with a mechanical monster.
Not only is it equipped with an artificial heart, it also has artificial lungs.
Judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake, it uses some form of air pump.
You think my husband was involved in all this?
Yes, Madame Valladon, I'm sure of it.
Why would anybody build a mechanical monster? Just to scare people?
Not very likely.
Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband?
And why was he buried anonymously?
I think I have a pretty good notion of what they're up to, the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments.
- Better known as the Diogenes Club.
- The Diogenes Club?
Come in.
Mr Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne for ye.
A bottle of champagne! I didn't order it.
No. You are to deliver it.
Those are my instructions.
Instructions from whom?
Deliver it where?
I wouldn't know, sir, but there's a carriage waiting for ye downstairs.
Are you sure you've got the right Mr Ashdown?
Quite sure, Mr Holmes.
Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is going up on the last act.
I don't like the sound of it.
Please be careful.
Holmes. You'd better take this with you.
Well. Who's minding the castle?
- You'd better get on. It's getting late.
- Where are we going? A party?
You won't be disappointed in the guestlist.
Who's the host?
Jonah.
Mr Ashdown, I presume.
The red runner, I presume. You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble just for me.
It's not for you. McKeller?
May I have the champagne, please?
1886. Not a very good vintage, is it?
Mediocre. Then again, it's not for drinking.
Tie it up, will you? In here.
Interesting... and educational.
Despite my warning you persisted in meddling.
- It would have served you right to drown.
- Sorry to be so unobliging.
"E Valladon". Hm.
I imagine that this belongs to the pretty lady and this belongs to your... valet.
- They were in the lake.
- Speaking of things in the lake...
How much do you know... or think you know?
I think you're testing some sort of underwater craft, camouflaged to mislead the gullible.
I think it's an experimental model operated by midgets.
It is powered by sulphuric-acid batteries and uses canaries to detect escaping gas.
- Altogether, a unique contraption.
- Not quite that unique.
Right now, four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible, but none could solve the critical problem:
How to stay submerged long enough.
What does the Good Book say?
"And Jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights."
That was our goal. Thanks to Valladon's air pump, we got a jump on the rest.
- It's a complex system, so we had trials.
- And at least one error.
During a run in the Moray Firth, pressure caused a leak, sea water mixed with acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas.
Before they could resurface, three were dead.
So you buried them in unmarked graves to preserve your secret.
It was essential to keep it from your client.
You went to all those lengths to prevent
Madame Valladon finding her husband?
Your client isn't Madame Valladon.
It's the lmperial German Government.
They were after the Belgian engineer, or rather his invention.
They knew he was employed by us but couldn't find where.
So they enlisted the best brain in England to help them.
You, my dear brother, have been working for the Wilhelmstrasse.
And Madame Valladon, what part did she play in all of this?
- Madame Valladon is dead.
- Dead?
The Germans disposed of her three weeks ago. In Brussels.
This is Gabrielle Valladon.
The woman brought to you in the middle of the night, apparently fished out of the Thames and apparently suffering from amnesia is, in fact, llse von Hoffmanstal, one of their most skilful agents.
Am I going too fast for the best brain in England?
- Go on.
- They planted her on you quite neatly,
I must admit, so you could lead them to their objective, the air pump.
Very much like using a hog to find truffles.
And now perhaps you'd care to join me.
I'm expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral.
Your Majesty.
I trust you had a pleasant journey, ma'am.
It was long and it was tedious and it had better be worth our while, Mr Holmes.
I can assure you, ma'am, it will be.
Now, what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen?
A submersible, ma'am.
It travels underwater.
Underwater? What a fantastic idea.
May I present some of the scientists responsible for this achievement.
- JW Ferguson, naval architect.
- Your Majesty.
Professor Simpson, our leading expert in hydraulics.
WW Prescott, coinventor of the revolving periscope.
- Your Majesty.
- And this is my brother Sherlock, ma'am.
Ah, yes, Sherlock Holmes.
- We've followed you with great interest.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases now?
- In a manner of speaking, ma'am.
- When will we read Dr Watson's account?
I hope never, ma'am. It has not been one of my more successful endeavours.
Oh.
There she is, ma'am.
Her Majesty's Ship Jonah.
And what, may we ask, is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle?
- Merely a decoy, ma'am.
- Oh!
To frighten away the sharks, we imagine.
Something of the sort.
The crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible.
Stand to!
Aren't they rather small for sailors?
Because of the size of the craft, the navy made an exception.
They should make it a rule. It is quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes.
This main engine propels it underwater at the rate of two knots.
The reciprocating stabiliser mechanism.
The high-voltage acid batteries.
The multistage compressor.
The ballast tank trimmer.
The air pump, which filters and recirculates the air.
- Oh, charming.
- The air pump, ma'am?
Canaries!
Must make the crew feel at home!
Yes, ma'am.
The levers for firing the torpedoes, which are accurate up to as much as 120ft.
The periscope for scanning the surface of the water.
- Where is the glass bottom?
- The what, ma'am?
- The glass bottom.
- You know, to observe the fish.
- And the plants and the corals.
- That's not quite the idea, ma'am.
HMS Jonah has been commissioned as a warship.
A warship.
Stop that noise!
Stop it!
- If I may explain.
- You had better.
The admiralty regards this as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare.
It can seek out and destroy enemy ships while remaining completely invisible.
You mean it can fire at other vessels while underwater? Without any warning?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Without showing her colours?
- Indeed, ma'am.
- Mr Holmes, we are not amused.
It is unsportsmanlike, it is unEnglish, and it is in very poor taste.
We will have none of it.
I beg your pardon, ma'am?
Sometimes we despair at the state of the world.
- What will scientists think of next?
- That's precisely it, ma'am.
At this very moment, the Germans are experimenting with a dirigible.
A dirigible? And what, pray, is that?
A rigid balloon which could drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace.
It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Nonsense.
We refuse to believe that our grandson
Willie would do a thing like that.
We have proof, ma'am.
Our agent in Friedrichshafen, lbbetson, saw the dirigible and made a drawing of it.
However, he was apprehended before crossing the border.
Nevertheless, we want no part of this beastly invention. Get rid of it.
- Scuttle it. The sooner the better.
- May I point out, ma'am...
And do not concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us.
We shall write a very sharp note to the kaiser.
Now, we wish to return to Balmoral.
Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman.
What a shame, all that superb engineering and all that cunning espionage for naught.
Not necessarily.
If the Germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them?
- Give it to them?
- Invite them aboard for the final journey.
700ft, straight down.
- And how are you going to arrange that?
- I'm rather counting on you to do it, since you're on such intimate terms with Fräulein von Hoffmanstal.
Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty?
Sorry about that, but as long as you're up.
What is the German word for "castle"?
- Schloss, isn't it?
- I think so.
And how would you say
"under the castle"?
Unter das Schloss? Or die Schloss?
I don't know. My German is not that good.
Your Trappist friends are waiting outside to hear from you.
It's a chilly morning, we don't want to keep them standing around, do we?
Fräulein Hoffmanstal.
Come, now, it's too late to play cat and mouse.
Unter dem Schloss.
Thank you.
Here is your signaling device.
It's rather damp, I'm afraid.
Would you care to tell them where they can find the submersible?
No?
Then I shall just have to do it myself.
I only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion.
Well, it's up to the good monks now.
You can consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fräulein Hoffmanstal.
You're all wrong about me.
My name is not Hoffmanstal.
- It isn't?
- It's von Hoffmanstal.
I stand corrected.
I suppose once they are in the castle...
Must amuse you,
Trappists walking into a trap?
It's more amusing than that. Once inside, they will encounter little resistance.
It will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards.
- You mean you'll give them the air pump?
- We'll give them the submersible.
They'll find it with its engines running, all set to go. I assume they're expert sailors.
Since there's a German battleship off the coast,
I expect they'll try to sail it out of the loch and rendezvous at sea.
Did you say "try to"?
I would suggest you get your things together.
Mycroft will be here to take you into custody.
I never had you fooled for a moment, did I?
You knew right from the beginning.
When the cabby brought me to Baker Street.
Let me see...
Not quite that soon.
It's so funny. I asked for this assignment, you know.
I was scheduled to go to Japan, but I couldn't resist the challenge of coming up against the best.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a closer game.
Close enough.
You're just being kind. I failed miserably.
We all have occasional failures.
Fortunately, Dr Watson never writes about mine.
Holmes! Holmes!
Holmes!
Holmes! I saw it again!
That thing!
It came to the castle. It's out there.
It was out there. Now it's gone.
- It's gone?
- Forever. Look for yourself.
A bottle of champagne?
And a bible?
That's all that's left of HMS Jonah.
Holmes! For once, would you mind being a little less cryptic?
It would seem that someone carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible.
What a fitting end for Trappists.
Now they're resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake.
Do you know what he's talking about?
Fräulein von Hoffmanstal.
Yes, Mr Holmes, I'm all ready.
One thing I like about the Prussians is their punctuality.
If there's one thing I dislike about the British, it's their climate.
I understand your jails are very damp and your heating facilities totally inadequate.
They are, but you're not going to jail, you're going back to Germany.
- Germany?
- You'll go to the Swiss-German border and be exchanged for one of our agents, a man named lbbetson.
- Thank you.
- Thank my brother. It was his idea.
Frankly, I think we're making a poor deal.
You're better than most operatives working for British intelligence.
Don't you agree, Sherlock?
And better than some consulting detectives.
Shall we?
I'll take that.
Gentlemen.
You don't have to explain if you don't want.
- I appreciate that, Watson.
- I'm only your official biographer.
I don't think she would care to have this story spread all over the Strand Magazine.
The public has a right to know these things.
If she's a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her feelings?
Giddap.
Look, Holmes, if I promise not to write a word about it, would you enlighten me, as your friend, as your valet?
Quiet. I'm trying to read a personal message.
Message?
What's she saying?
Auf...
Wiedersehen.
Auf Wieder... The nerve!
Hm!
- A letter from the Diogenes Club.
- Maybe Mycroft put you up as a member.
If only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother.
Aren't you going to finish your breakfast?
Holmes, I'm terribly sorry about this.
Where is it, Watson?
In the files. May to July 1885.
You're getting better.

[bell dinging]
[male narrator] World War II had ended only eight months earlier.
And the town of Texarkana, population 40,000,
which straddles the Texas-Arkansas border,
was regearing for peace after four years
of rationing, war bonds, and shortages.
Although a trickle was still arriving,
most of the boys were back home and out of uniform.
Many were enrolling in college or starting up businesses
with the help of the GI Bill of Rights.
[organ music playing]
Some people still had doubts about President Truman
and were worried over the growing tension with Russia.
The wave of strikes sweeping the country
were being felt by many of the Texarkana businesses.
[clamoring]
[applause]
[cheers]
But fears that the workforce at the United States Army's
Red River Arsenal would be cut to nothing
had not materialized.
[no audible dialog]
There were long waiting lists of people
ready to buy the still scarce new cars,
as well as all kinds of household appliances.
The building business was booming.
And people around Texarkana
generally were optimistic about the future.
[clamoring]
It was Sunday, March 3, 1946,
the beginning of a reign of terror for the people of Texarkana
and surrounding areas of Arkansas and Texas.
A terror so indelibly imprinted that today, thirty years later,
people still speak of it fearfully.
The incredible story you are about to see is true—
where it happened and how it happened.
Only the names have been changed.
[crickets chirping]
[music approaching]

Would you sit up?
Well, damn it, Linda Mae, come on.
Sammy, move your hand.

What'd you do that for?

I heard something.
By God, Linda Mae, will you please concentrate on what the hell's goin' on.
[whispering]
I'm not kiddin'.
I heard somethin'.
[breathing]
Linda Mae, that is the oldest trick in the book.
Have you got the car doors locked?

Jesus Christ, why I go out with you
I'll never understand.
Damn.

Hey, mister, you got the wrong car!
You're looking for somebody else!

[screaming]
[sobs]
Please.
[sirens approach]
[male on police radio]
Ambulance already en route.
It should be in the area at present.
[siren approaches]
About a half a mile up that road, we've got a boy hurt real bad.
There's deputies up there already.
Go!
[siren blares]
[police radio]
Unit two, come in.
Will unit two come in and give report?
Come in, Ramsey!
Base, this is unit two.
Go ahead, unit two.
Well, they're both still alive.
Man's name is Samuel P. Fuller.
Age 24, his drivers license address is 7-9-0-7 West Pine.
Passing motorist that found the girl recognized her.
She works over at the plant on the D-line and her name is Linda Mae Jenkins.
He said he thought she was about 19 years old.
And she lives somewhere off Broad Street.
Contact me as soon as you can get hold of Sheriff Barker and ask him to meet me over at the Michael-Meahger Hospital.
[car door slams]
[siren sounds]
Miss Jenkins?
Miss Jenkins, can you describe him to us?
Can you tell us anything about the man who did this to you?
Gentlemen, I'm sorry, it's just too soon.
She's still heavily sedated.
How 'bout the boy, can we talk to him?
No, he's in about the same shape.
He took several bad blows about the neck and head
from what I'd guess to be a heavy blunt instrument.
[female on PA]
Dr. Abrams, calling Dr. Abrams.
Dr. Abrams, you're wanted on the telephone.
Did he rape her, Doc?
No, there was no evidence of rape.
But I can tell you that her back, stomach, and breasts were heavily bitten.
- Bitten?
- Literally chewed.
[Doctor] If I can help you any more, give me a call.
Thank you, Doc.
[female on PA]
Calling Dr. Abrams.
Well, gentlemen, what's happened in the lover's lane case?
Captain, we ain't got nothin'.
No witnesses.
Neither the girl nor the boy could give us a decent description of the man.
The boy really never saw him.
All he's able to tell us,
that the man had a white hood over his face
and was strong as hell.
Fact is, Chief, the only thing we really do know is that we've got a very strange person on our hands.
That's the reason we're here.
We believe that the high school and college students should be warned against parking on lonely roads.
[phone rings]
Patrolman Benson speaking.
Yes, Mrs. Kiner, this is Sparkplug.
What's your problem?
You know,
I think you're right.
We're gonna have to get out to that school and warn those kids about staying out of lover's lanes.
You really think he's gonna strike again?
I got a strong feeling he will.
Mrs. Kiner, you don't have to put up with that crap.
We'll get the word out to all the patrol cars that if they see any of the kids on lover's lane, just, you know, run 'em off.
Get him on the phone!
Is that you, Kiner?
What the hell's wrong with you, boy?
You try that again and the
Supreme Court of the United States ain't gonna be able to save yo' ass.
Okay, Mrs. Kiner, now, you just settle down
'cause he promised me.
Mm-hm.
I gotta run.
I'll see ya, Chief,
Captain.
You lock up that mangy dog
'cause if he sicks him on me one more time,
I'm gonna blow six holes in him.
[chattering]
Benson, how long have you been on the force?
Four months, sir.
God, it seems like it's been longer than that.
No, sir, four months this Tuesday.
Well, look, Benson, when a citizen calls in with a complaint, we don't threaten them.
But from now on, if you get a phone call from Mrs. Kiner or from anybody in this town, simply quote legal procedure.
And furthermore, you will not issue threats of any kind to anybody.
Do you hear me?
Yes, sir.
[buzzing]
Police department.
Mrs. Kiner...
Patrolman Benson.
That does it, Mrs. Kiner.
You lock up that mangy dog
'cause I'm on my way.
[phone slams]
[thunderclap]
[narrator]
This is Howard W. Turner, age 29,
former Seabee who returned from overseas a few weeks ago.
The young girl is Emma Lou Cook and she is 17.
They have been seeing each other for about six weeks.
Emma Lou had dropped out of school in order to get a job
and help out at home.
I'm so tired of it raining.
Kind of reminds me of Japan.
Damn, it always rained there.
I'll bet you miss Japan.
Why?
All those Japanese girls scrubbin' your back.
I must say they do know how to please a man.
Well, if you haven't been pleased with me for the past six weeks, you can just take me home.
I didn't say you didn't please me.
You started it.
Well, I'm just on edge.
[narrator] Texarkana had pretty much returned to normal
after the excitement of the attack on lover's lane.
No clues and no suspects had been found.
Samuel P. Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins
have now been dismissed from Michael-Meagher Hospital
and are under the care of their family physicians.
Now, it is a rainy Saturday night,
March 24, 1946,
twenty-one days after the attack on lover's lane.
[male on radio]
Temperatures in the lower 50s.
Warmer tomorrow, upper 60s—
- Hi, Norm.
- Hey, Tom.
[radio] Now, if you listen real hard, you can hear the...
Well, what can we do for the sheriff's department on a rainy Saturday night?
How many units you got out?
Mmm, four.
[thunder]
It was three weeks ago tonight that couple was attacked out in the College Hill section, wasn't it?
Damned if I know.
Last two weeks, this place has been a madhouse.
You don't suppose you could get some of your units to check some of those lover's parking hangouts, do you?
Gee, I don't know, Norm.
[sighs] We sure ought to get the Captain's okay.
Where is Gus?
Well, I expect he's home on a night like this.
Listen, I've got his home number.
Would you like it?
I don't— no, no, that's silly.
Eh, it's just a feeling.
I'll see ya later.
Baby, you better not go down this road.
We might get stuck.
Oh, it's okay, there's gravel on it.
[male on police radio]
Unit two, what's your location?
I'm a mile and a half north of Higgins Store out on Highway 71.
I'll be back in, uh, oh, about ten minutes.
Roger, unit two.
Okay, base, over and out.
Base, this is unit two.
Go ahead.
I'm gonna be off the channel for about 60 seconds.
Roger.
[bang!]
Base, unit two, just heard some shots down this road somewhere!
Get some backup units in here, quick!
Roger.
This is unit two.
Go ahead, unit two.
I'm almost at the end of the Thurman Road.
There's a parked car here.
I can't tell if there's anybody in it.
I'm gonna check it out.
Now, what about units three or four, is anybody on the way?
Unit four, I'm on my way.
Approach me with your lights on.
Police, get out of the car!
You in the car,
I said get out!
[bang! bang!]
Base, unit two.
Base, unit two!
Go ahead, unit two.
I heard a couple a more shots.
They came from about a mile in the woods north of where I'm parked.
I think the occupants of this parked vehicle have been abducted.
Request a 10-33.
Roger, unit two.
What's your position, unit four?
This is unit four, just passed the Nazarene Church on Highway 71.
Be there to help you in a minute.
Roger, four.
And turn it on,
I need you here!
My God.
Oh, my God.
[dog barking]
[frog croaking]
[narrator] Norman Ramsey was close that night but did not fire,
for he knew the phantom was just out of range.
Ramsey was carrying a 12 gauge shotgun.
[siren approaches]
The second attack by the killer
sent a wave of cold fear sweeping across the city.
Within 24 hours after the town got word of the killing
every gun store had sold out of weapons.
And by Tuesday morning, May 26, locksmiths were flooded
for orders for new locks, deadbolts, and safety chains,
as the news of the killing attracted nationwide attention.
No motive could be found and it seemed
that the killer might attack anybody he stumbled across.
A universal fear spread among the people in this city
and surrounding areas.
Perhaps everyone secretly or openly wondered,
"Am I or someone close to me his next victim?"
Texarkana looked normal during the daylight hours.
But everyone dreaded sundown.
[dog barks]
We haven't been able to come up with a damn thing.
And we've got to have some help.
J want the best criminal investigator you've got.
Okay, when?
We'll be there to meet him.
Thanks very much.
They're really stirred up in Austin.
We're getting the most famous criminal investigator
in the country assigned to this case.
You don't mean that fella they call the Lone Wolf with the Texas Rangers?
That's right.
[whistles]
The big man himself—
Captain J.D. Morales, living legend.
The most famous ranger in the history of Texas.
[bell clanging]
- Captain Morales?
- Yes, sir.
I'm Deputy Norman Ramsey.
Glad to know you, sir.
- We're glad to see you, sir.
- Thank you.
Captain Morales.
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
This is Chief Sullivan.
Captain, we're certainly glad you're here.
Thank you, sir.
We have a car waiting, if you're ready.
Let's go.
Thank God, Captain, you're here.
Well, thank you, mam.
Excuse me, Captain Morales, welcome to Texarkana.
Do you have a plan of investigation as of yet?
Yes, sir, I plan on catchin' him.
Or killin' him.
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I want to get a cigar.
- Right.
- Be right there.
Yes, sir, you got any cigars?
Yes, sir, right over here, please, sir, just help yourself.
Thank you.
There you are.
All right, thank you, sir, and you come back.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir, thank you.
[chattering]
Where's your office?
Right in there.
- Captain Morales.
- Captain Wells.
- Glad to know you, sir.
- Same here.
Shoo!
[door shuts]
Since I'm in charge of this investigation, things are gonna have to be handled my way.
I'll keep you informed as to what
I'm doin', if I have time.
And I'll expect your full cooperation.
[both]
You've got it.
Thank you, sir.
I don't want any newspaper people or hangers on gettin' in my way.
When the people of this community need to know something,
I'll inform the press.
And I'd appreciate it if nobody but me gave out any information on this case from now on.
Rumors can hurt us.
We got a cold-blooded killer here—
A man who nobody sees.
A phantom who, so far, hasn't made any mistakes.
I've assigned Captain Wells to work directly with you.
I'll give you the best man
I've got on my force,
Deputy Sheriff Ramsey.
Twelve of my men and six patrol cars should arrive here in town late this afternoon.
If you could help them get squared away, I'd appreciate it.
Sergeant Mai Griffin is in charge.
I also have a patrol car and a driver available to you.
Good, I'd like to use it right away.
I'd also like for Deputy Ramsey to go with me to take a look at the site of the murders.
And I want to go over the victims' cars.
I'll get you Ramsey right away.
Patrolman Benson will be your driver.
Thank you, sir.
[typing and radio chatter]
Let's go.
- Captain, I'll see you later.
- Thank you.
Captain, I wonder if you could tell me if you plan to use the same tactics that you used down in Laredo, to catch our killer here.
Who is this man?
This is Mr. George Hartman.
Mr. Hartman's a prominent citizen here in Texarkana.
He's, uh, interested in police work.
Fine.
You tell Mr. Hartman if he's interested in police work he can pick up a copy of the
Police Gazette down at the corner.
Ready Ramsey?
You bet.
Where's my driver?
I'll get him.
- Sparkplug?
- Yes, sir.
You know the man in the white suit?
That's Captain Morales.
You'll be his driver.
Try not to wreck him.
No, sir.
[whispering]
Where are the keys? Damn.
Excuse me, Captain, them damn keys.
I'll be right back.
Benson, what the hell is going on?
Chief, them damn car keys,
I can't find them nowhere.
Which car do you plan to use?
Unit seven, sir.
Well, what in the hell is that right there under number seven?
Thanks, Chief,
I was gonna check there next.
[motor revs]
[siren sounds]
[tires squeal]
[siren continues]
Hold it, boy.
Jesus!
I meant slow down, not stop.
For Chrissakes!
You just got two controls on this damn thing, wide open and stop?
Well, I figured you was in a hurry, sir.
Well, I am in a hurry.
What'd you say your name was?
Patrolman A.C. Benson.
Some folks call me Sparkplug.
Well, now, Sparkplug, I'd kinda like to survive this investigation.
Unless I tell you it's an emergency,
I want you to observe the speed limits and traffic signs.
No sirens and no red lights.
You understand that?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Captain.
[narrator] More and more police poured into Texarkana.
Texas Rangers, Arkansas State Police, and the FBI are now on the case.
Sheriff's departments and city policemen
have been loaned from surrounding towns and counties.
Captain Morales set up curfews
and demanded an exhaustive level of vigilance.
And when the sun when down
there was an empty, ghostly appearance to this town.
The only signs of life
were police cars patrolling the streets.
The investigative forces worked around the clock.
Every lead was run down.
Every phone call, every rumor checked out.
[typing]
All the nuts came out of the woodwork.
A man arrested in Shreveport confessed to the crimes.
Two other criminals, while holding people at gunpoint,
bragged they had committed the Texarkana murders.
Forty-five.
What'd you say your name was?
The phantom.
Where'd you say you did the shooting?
Over— over there in the south side.
Have you got the weapon?
I" I throwed it in the river.
I could show you where I throwed it, though.
Mr. Williams, could I please get an address?
[narrator] Citizens poured into the police station
demanding protection, as the fear spread like cancer.
I can't hide from nobody.
Can't help that,
I got something on my mind.
Well, let's have it.
On March 3, Samuel Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins were attacked on a lonely road.
Now, exactly 21 days later,
Emma Lou Cook and Howard Turner were murdered on a lover's lane road.
Day after tomorrow is Sunday, that's, uh, April 14.
And that, sir, is exactly 21 days since the last—
Don't go no further.
I got a feeling you're right.
- Let's get outta here.
- Yes, sir.
That's good.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
[narrator] Captain Morales decided to set up some decoys
in the various lover's lane parking areas,
anticipating a 21-day attack.
[male on police radio]
Return to headquarters, unit six.
[narrator] Sparkplug, not realizing the exact nature of the assignment,
volunteers to be one of the decoys.
[phone ringing]
[wolf whistle]
Oh, Lord, here comes your date.
Hey, Sparkplug, aren't you a little lopsided?
[laughing]
Go to hell, Ramsey.
They tell me all Sparky had to do to find that outfit was dig in the back of his closet.
Look at those legs.
Shut up, will you?
Just keep it up!
[chattering]
You all knock it off.
Remember now, keep low in your seats.
He may check you out with field glasses before he approaches the car.
When you first get into position, check with your rifleman.
They'll be in the brush coverin' you.
Stay alert.
And good luck.
Unit Able.
Uh, unit Able, hello?
Raise your antenna.
[clunk]
Unit Able?
Unit Able-
Roger Sparkplug, I'm set.
How about you, Walt, you there?
I'm here and looking at you and you look stunning.
Up yours, and out.
Now, Sparky, now, Sparky.
Don't get excited now.
What the hell you think you're doing?
You heard the captain, we're supposed to make this look good.
Now, we're supposed to be lovers.
I might get a little huggin' before the night's over.
You watch that hand.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Watch the hand!
Gee!
What I- what I can't understand is how come that one's bigger than this one?
I'd like to know what difference it makes.
You think I'm going to let the son of a bitch come in and fondle them before I blow his head off?
I don't guess it makes any difference.
It just looked like to me you run out of air on that left one before you got through.
Just mind your business and keep a sharp lookout.
[crashing]
Lord!
[big band music playing]
[mixed voices]
[no audible dialog]
[no audible dialog]
Well, it seems quiet.
Most of the teenagers still over at that high school dance.
What time they get out of that thing?
Not 'til probably, uh, 1:30 or so.
I want to intensify patrols in the parking area from one o'clock on.
Again, let me say it's a pleasure to see all of you out here having such a good time.
And I think tonight has been a fitting climax to what has been a great year here at Arkansas High School.
To those of you going on to college or out into the work world, we wish you the best.
And to you juniors who will be back with us again next year, have a good summer.
And now we're going to ask Reverend Harden to lead us in a short prayer.
Let us pray.
Our Father, we are thankful for this group of fine young men and young women.
Bless them throughout the coming year.
Our prayer tonight is to guide us safely home.
In Christ's name.
Amen.
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be forgot
In days of auld lang syne
For auld lang syne my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne.
[mixed voices]
- That was great, Peggy.
- Oh, thank you.
Listen, put my trombone away and I'll get my purse and we'll get out of here, okay?
Great.
[mixed voices]
[honking]
You don't really have to be home by 2:30, do you?
Well, somewhere right in then.
Well, how about our favorite spot over in Spring Lake Park?
Gee, I don't know, we've had lot's of warnings not to park.
You know that phantom killer hasn't been caught yet.
Yeah, but that was off the highway.
We'll be in the middle of town.
No one will bother us there.
I don't know.
Just for a little while, okay?
Okay, just for a little while.
Well, it's two o'clock.
Maybe my feelin's all wrong.
By God, I hope so.
You know, the only difference between tonight and three weeks ago and the time before that, is that it was rainin'.
You don't suppose the rain has something to do with it?
I don't know, triggerin' him.
Who knows?
Moonlight's so bright tonight, he might not want to try anything.
[breathing]
Wait a second, what time is it?
- What?
- What time is it?
I don't know, let me check.
- It's twenty to three.
- My God, I gotta get home.
Five more minutes, Peggy.
No, I'm gonna get in big trouble.
- Really, we better go.
- Come on, Peggy.
Now, you don't want me to get into trouble, do you, Roy?
No, I guess not.
[screaming]
[grunts]
[screaming]
[screams]
[moaning]
[screaming]
[screaming continues]
No, don't, please don't!
No, no!
Help me, oh, no!
[yelling, sobbing]
Oh, please don't hurt me.
Oh, please don't— don't hurt me, no.
Please don't hurt me.
Oh, my God, no!
Oh, my God, no, please!
Please don't hurt me.
Oh, no, please don't hurt me.
No, please.
No, no, please no.
Please no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, please don't hurt me.
No!
No, please, Roy, no.
[sobs]
Roy.
Roy, no, oh.
Run, Roy, run.
[sobs]
Oh, God, oh.
Oh, God, no.
Roy, run, run.
[click]
[muffled bang]
Oh, no.
Roy?
[muffled bang]
Oh, Roy, oh, Roy.
[whispers]
What now.
Oh, no, oh, please don't hurt me.
[blats]
What are you doing?
No, please don't hurt me.
Please.
What are you doing to me?
[breathing]
No.
[gasps]
[breathing]
No.
Oh, no, please don't hurt me.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
[grunts]
[groans]
[groans]
[breathing]
Where the hell was everybody?
Well, this is one of the spots they were checking.
Gus, how often were they checking here?
They were making continuous circuits.
[sighs] Each unit was checking about 15 or 20 places.
But I don't know how often they were gettin' back here.
Well, all I know is it wasn't often enough.
Here, right in the middle of the city, right under our noses.
Next thing you know, he'll kill somebody in police headquarters.
Well, we're doing the best we can possibly do.
Well, that's not enough.
Look, I want this entire area roped off with a ring of police around it.
We're gonna find some evidence if we have to sift every grain of sand in this damn park.
I want some evidence, do you understand that?
Right.
[narrator] The third on-schedule strike of the phantom killer
brought nationally known newspaper, magazine,
and radio reporters to Texarkana.
Life and Look Magazines sent their photographers and journalists.
CBS, NBC, and The Mutual
Broadcasting System
brought in nationally known commentators
to arrange for nationwide broadcasts through the local radio station.
A reward fund, which had been started after the first attack,
was now up to $8,000 for information leading
to the arrest and conviction of the killer.
Uh, Captain Morales, uh, what do you think about Dr. Kress, the psychiatrist at the prison, has to say about the phantom?
I really hadn't thought about it, mam.
You know, Captain Morales,
I believe Dr. Kress is really going to help us a lot on this case.
Yes, sir, I think so.
He should be here any time.
In fact, there he is now.
How are you?
Good to see you.
Gentlemen, good to see you.
I believe you know everyone at the table except maybe, uh, Captain Morales.
Captain, nice to meet you, sir.
Glad to know you, sir.
Listen, I think I'll just-
You've already ordered, haven't you?
I think I'll just, uh, take a New York cut steak, medium rare.
Captain, I've looked forward to meeting you.
Quite a number of my patients at the prison, they speak of you quite often.
Come to think of it, Doc,
I guess I have sent you a few customers over the past several years.
Yes.
Doctor, we're gonna have to get a better fix on who this killer is—
What motivates him.
How he thinks.
This man is definitely a sadist, motivated by a strong sex drive.
I guess you realize, Captain, that the— the odds are against you.
Well, what do you mean, Dr. Kress?
I'd say this man is between
35 and 40 years old, highly intelligent.
The odds are at least two to one that he'll never be caught.
Well, I sure as hell don't buy that.
Well, I'm just going by the statistical profile he fits within, Captain.
This thing has become a game with him, you know.
The, uh~ the fact that the— this massive manhunt, the largest ever assembled in this area, is after him, well, it's a source of pleasure to him.
Makes him feel important.
He has all the odds on his side.
He know exactly what's going on in the investigation and you know practically nothing about him.
Excuse me, Doctor,
I wonder if I could ask you some direct questions and get some blunt straight answers.
Well, I'll try.
He chewed the girl's back, neck, and breasts— why?
Sexual satisfaction.
He didn't force the girls to have sexual intercourse.
That's not what excites him.
He's abnormal.
Is he insane?
Oh, yes.
But not in the usual sense.
He could be living what appears to be a normal life right here in Texarkana.
He could even be one of your more prominent citizens.
Well, do you know any reason why he hasn't taken any money off of his victims?
That's— that's not his motive.
It's like asking why he used a trombone the way he did with the Loomis girl.
He has this strange, sadistic imagination.
I suppose he does these things because they please him in some way.
Do you think he'll attack again on schedule?
Not necessarily.
I would say, in view of the intensity of the manhunt,
he'll probably change his pattern.
He may до back into a normal pattern—
Go back into his shell.
Not be heard from again for years.
[Morales] Yeah, that's what makes this case so damn frustrating.
This murdering pervert could be passing us on the street ten times a day.
I don't know.
I ain't never been so scared in my life.
Rainbow, you're still scared, ain't you?
Yes, sir, yes, I am.
- What'd he look like?
- I don't know what he looked like.
I just saw that big barrel, that's all I saw.
I don't know what the man looked like.
What else did he say to you?
Well, when he told me he was out of gas about two miles down the road, he told me he'd give me a dollar take him down the road.
That is, a dollar for gas.
That's what I did.
He got out of the car, and I'd driven about eight or ten miles, but he told me just two mile down the road.
And I was asking him, I said,
"Man, how far is your car from here?
I done already driven eight or ten miles."
So, when I looked around for an answer, I saw that gun.
And he told me just keep on drivin' to Lufkin.
So, I told him, I said, "I won't have enough gas to get back."
He said, "What make him so damn sure that I was gonna get back."
He said, "I already killed five people in Texarkana.
One more won't make make it him difference."
So, I take him on to Lufkin.
Well, uh, what did he say to you when you got in to Lufkin?
Well, when we got there, he told me to pull over on side the road.
There, in Lufkin.
That's what I did.
And then when he start to get out, he asked me for my billfold.
I told him, I said,
"Well, there's no money in it."
So he said,
"Just give me your billfold."
So, I hand it to him.
He take my drivers license out of it and looked at it.
Hand my billfold back to me.
He said, "Mr. Johnson."
He says, "I know what kind of car you drive and I know where you live at.
You tell anybody about this
I'm gonna kill ya."
So that's when I really got scared.
Well, Mr. Johnson, you don't have to worry about that.
We're gonna put a police car at your home 24 hours a day.
Well, I sure appreciate that.
Ramsey, I want to set up a meeting with that girl and boy who were first attacked.
It's just possible they may recall something of significance.
When do you want to do this, Captain?
[male on police radio] Commence to cafe on West Seventh Street.
Suspect is armed.
Units two and three are now proceeding to that location.
All other units in the vicinity of West Seventh
should proceed with emergency.
Would unit five give me his last location once again—
That's only two blocks from here.
Come in, unit five.
Emergency, Sparkplug, go get 'em.
[siren blares]
[siren approaches]
That's him in the green car.
Straight ahead.
[siren blares]
[tires squeal]
[Morales on radio]
Have the suspect's car in view
and are in hot pursuit.
Stay with him.
We ain't gonna make this.
Hold on, Captain!
Hold it, hold it, whoop, whoop!
All right, out of the car!
What's wrong?
Get out of the car.
What's wrong?
[Morales]
I hope we catch him soon or we'll all be killed if we don't.
[siren blares]
[siren blaring]
[siren approaches]
Where's the Captain, I thought he was leading this chase.
Watch— wa— wa— wa—
[siren winds down]
I'd like to know just why the hell there ain't a sign up there on that road tellin' me that the road ends!
Sparkplug!
Shut up.
Yes, sir.
[radio] Unit one, return to headquarters and make...
You okay, Captain?
I'd rather face that damn phantom than ride any further with him.
What's your name?
Eddie LeDoux.
You got my wallet there.
You can see what my name is.
I don't know what you people are doing.
Scared me half to death.
That's why
I was runnin' from you.
All them police cars come roaring down on you.
Scare anybody half to death.
Uh-huh, where you from, Eddie?
New Orleans.
Man, I lived in New Orleans all my life.
Mm, what you doing in Texarkana?
Lookin' for work.
Uh-huh, how long have you, uh, been in Texarkana, Eddie?
I just got in today.
Look at my car, it's ruined.
Your car?
Your car is a stolen car, Eddie.
It's on the hot sheet, Captain.
[sirens approach]
That's him.
That's him.
Mister, you owe me a dollar for takin' you up the road the other day.
And ten dollars for takin' you to Lufkin.
And I want my damn money!
What's the matter with that darkie?
Is he crazy?
Get him outta here.
That's the trashiest white man
I've seen in my life, right there.
That's the gun right there.
It's the gun he put in my face.
Right there, that's it.
Do you still deny that you know this man?
Yeah, maybe I do.
Now, you think about this,
LeDoux, before you answer.
Did you state to this man that you killed five people in Texarkana?
Yeah.
You got me.
I'm the phantom.
I killed them.
Bring on the newspaper reporters and...
I'll give you a confession.
I want you to send one car on in ahead of us.
Make sure the station's cleared of any reporters.
Right.
He not the one who done it, is he Captain?
No way.
Probably got a record as long as your arm, but he's not the phantom.
But if he keeps his story, he's gonna cause us an awful lot of headaches.
Well, Captain, if you got no objections,
I'll take the prisoner with me in our car.
And I'll ride in the back seat with him all the way to the police station.
I think that'd be all right.
[laughs]
Did you really want to admit guilt?
Man!
[yells]
Oh, no.
Wait, just hold— wait!
I sure as hell ain't gonna ride no further with him.
[narrator] By the time LeDoux reached headquarters.
Sergeant Mai Griffin had convinced him he was not the phantom killer.
And summer had come once again to this part of the South.
Long, hot days prevailed, as people tried
not to think of the madness that loomed around them.
It was now May 3, 1946.
[car revs]
[faint breathing]
Floyd?
- Floyd.
- Yeah.
Do you hear somebody walkin' outside?
No, I don't hear anything.
Floyd?
Did you break something?
Floyd?
[sobbing]
Floyd.
Oh, my God.
Operator?
Operator!
[screaming]
[telephone] This is the operator, what is you number?
[screams]
[shot]
Hello, go ahead, please.
This is your operator.

[narrator]
Helen Reed did not die.
She lingered in critical condition in the hospital for weeks.
Then gradually recovered.
People were afraid to walk in front of their windows
after the sun went down.
Newspapers stopped making early morning deliveries.
with newspaper boys waiting until daylight to make their rounds.
And Western Union stopped making night deliveries.
Over 150 police cars now cruised
the dark streets, alleys, parks, and parking areas
of Texarkana from darkness until dawn,
in the most intense manhunt ever mounted in the Southwest.
Friday, May 25, Saturday, May 26, and Sunday May 27,
the target dates for his regular three week strikes
came and passed with nothing happening.
The manhunt intensified.
Nine different police organizations now had officers
in marked and unmarked patrol cars operating in the Texarkana area.
[sirens blaring]
[clamoring]
Paul, you go with him.
It was right in there.
It was right in there.
Over by the door, I~
[screams]
[barking]
[steam whistle sounds]
[male] Move it back now, the Captain's coming through here.
Come on, let's move back.
[male] How long before you're going to apprehend the killer?
Gentlemen, I'm sorry, we don't have anything new to report.
We're continuing to work around the clock, checking out every possible lead.
Captain, I wonder if you could tell us
Mrs. Reed's condition.
Mrs. Reed, we are told, is slowly improving.
We've had some very brief interviews with her.
And in my opinion, nothing she can tell us will positively identify the killer.
In fact, she never saw him, except for one brief moment he was behind screen wire some distance from her and wearing a mask.
Now, Captain, we have word that a Texarkana doctor has turned in his son as a suspect.
Is this true?
No, mam.
We've checked that out and there's absolutely nothing to it.
[male]
Thank you very much, Captain.
Sir, the ballistics department reports that the bullets removed from Reed's body have similar markings to the bullets removed earlier from the bodies of Roy Allen and Peggy Loomis.
Well, that pretty much confirms one thing— that he killed at least three people with the same gun.
That's all we've got.
What day is this?
He's four days behind his schedule, Captain.
Maybe this last time he went 20 days instead of exactly three weeks.
This next time he might go 19 or 22.
Who the hell knows?
He's quit, hasn't he, Captain?
He's either crawled back into his shell or he's moved on to another town.
There's one other possibility.
What's that?
He could've been arrested for some other crime.
You're thinking about that fella in Shreveport.
He's a possibility.
But he can account for his movements on the last two murders.
So, I— I don't know what to say.
He's killed five people and he damn near killed three more and we're no closer to catchin' him than we were four months ago.
We ain't never gonna catch him, are we Captain?
You want an official or a private reply?
Private.
If we do catch him, it's gonna be a miracle.
[police radio] Please make log-
Stolen car found
one and a half miles off Highway 82 on Crank Road.
Texas license plate, make-- Chevrolet, two-door, black coupe.
Base, this is unit two.
Would you give me a description on that car again?
Yeah, unit two, it's a black two-door coupe,
believed to be a 1939 Chevrolet with Texas license.
Thank you, base.
That's a description of the car I saw the night I found Emma Lou Cook and Howard Turner murdered.
You know, this might be our miracle.
Let's go get him.
Well, that's the same color.
And I'm almost positive it's the same model and make.
How far is it down through this timber here to the Sulphur River?
Oh, about a mile and a half.
Any people live down in there?
Nope, none that I know of.
Nothin' between here and that river except that old sand pit.
Any kids ever park up in there?
They used to, but I don't think they do anymore.
You wait here.
Radio Sheriff Barker and tell him to stand by the bloodhounds.
Yes, sir.
- Sir.
- Let's go.
That pit can't be no more than a quarter of a mile now.
Yeah, let's approach it real careful, though.
All right.
[train whistle blows]
[whistle blows]
Come on.
[birds cackling]
Probably got eight or ten minutes ahead of us.
Damn!
I think he's done it to us again.
One thing about it.
At least he knows we've been here.
Let's get those bloodhounds.
[howling]
[narrator] The bloodhounds that were brought in
quickly lost the scent in this murky bayou
in the vast backwater wilderness of southern Arkansas.
Some say of these swamps that most men who go in,
never come out.
But there was little doubt that the phantom killer
plunged deep into these swamps that late Fall of 1946.
What happened to the phantom killer, no one really knows.
Some believe he was convicted of another crime
and today he is still serving his term in a Kansas prison.
Some believe he died here in these swamps.
Texarkana today still looks pretty much the same.
And if you should ask people here on the streets
what they believed happened to the phantom killer,
most would say that he is still living here...
and is walking free.
Captain J.D. Morales never stopped looking for the phantom killer.
He returned to Laredo, Texas in that same year
and kept searching and digging for evidence for the next decade
in this, one of America's most baffling cases.
Today, he's retired from the Texas Rangers
and makes his home in Dallas, Texas.
Chief Sullivan was reelected for three more terms.
Retired and died in 1970.
Sheriff Barker also was reelected for several terms
and never stopped working on the case until his death in 1966.
Mrs. Reed recovered and is living a normal life today
in Texarkana, Arkansas.
Sammy Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins moved away from Texarkana.
At this time, their whereabouts is not known.
Deputy Sheriff Norman Ramsey served all of his adult life
as a fine peace officer of Miller County, Arkansas.
He died in 1973.
Happy birthday.
Who is it?
- Mr. Jacobs?
- Yes?
It's me, Frank Hallet.
Hallet?
- Trick or treat!
- What?
Trick or treat!
It's Halloween, young lady.
Why aren't you out trick-or-treating?
Oh, somebody's birthday.
- Whose, yours?
- Yes.
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.
And besides your birthday, it's also Halloween.
Can I tell my father what you want?
My name's Frank Hallet.
Your father knows me.
My two kids will be along.
They're trick-or-treating.
I'm just going along to make sure... there aren't any real goblins hanging around.
Like dirty old men who try to give pretty little girls some candy.
Tell your father you've got company.
You better shut the door.
You'll let all the heat out of the house.
I've seen you around, but we've never met, have we?
- You came over from England, right?
- Right.
And they don't celebrate
Halloween in England?
No.
It's a big day here... when all the kids get dressed up in costumes and masks... and go around to all the houses... and shout, "Trick or treat!"
And you're supposed to act scared.
And if you don't give them a treat, they pull some dirty trick on you.
You mean, no trick-or-treaters have been by here tonight?
Well, there will be. My two kids will be along here any minute.
One's a green skeleton and the other's a Frankenstein monster.
What's considered a treat?
Candy, popcorn, gum, anything like that.
Would they like a piece of cake?
But that's your birthday cake.
You shouldn't cut it just for them.
Bravo.
Where's your mother?
My mother's dead.
But your father's here.
He smokes French cigarettes, right?
Am I right about the French cigarettes?
Yeah.
Where is he, upstairs?
Your father's upstairs?
- No, he's in his study, working.
- Oh, yes. He's a poet.
My mother says he's a poet.
And whatever my mother says automatically has to be true.
It wouldn't dare not be.
My mother's the lady that leased this place to you and your father.
Oh, that's great.
The kids are gonna love this.
Are my hands cold?
You're 13?
I counted 13 candles.
- That's all I had.
- You're 14?
I'll bet you write poetry too.
I'd like to read your poems sometime.
Just you and your father live here?
Just you two?
Yeah.
And I'll bet this is his favourite chair, isn't it?
Yeah.
What've you got there?
What is that, a hamster?
Oh, let me see.
Well, I just wanna see.
What's his name?
Oh, come on. He's gotta have a name.
Tell me his name.
Gordon.
Gordon? He's cute.
Shouldn't you tell your father I'm here?
No, not when he's working.
You're a very pretty girl, you know that?
Pretty eyes.
Pretty hair.
Pretty girl like you, and your birthday and all...
No boyfriend?
Come on, I'll bet you got a boyfriend.
I'll bet you got lots of boyfriends, pretty girl like you.
It's okay. It's all right. Relax.
I get to spank you on your birthday.
That's a custom here.
Yes, you get one spank for every year, and one to grown on.
See, you got off easy.
Now, don't get mad. It's just a game.
It's just a silly birthday game, that's all.
You don't think I was trying to be fresh, do you? Don't be silly.
I've got two kids of my own, you know, and they'll be along any minute.
Here they come now, even. Well, I'm off.
Thank you for the treats.
No trick on you tonight.
Hello, boys!
Tell your father I'm sorry
I missed him. Good night.
Hey, I've got some treats for you.
There we go.
One for you and one for you.
Come on, boys, let's go. Happy birthday!
Come on, boys, let's go, go, go.
Jacobs, Lester and Jacobs, Rynn.
That's me.
It's what you call a joint account.
Sign here, please.
- Have you got your key?
- Right here.
You can take it into one of these booths.
Yes, I know. Thank you.
Sign your name again, please.
She's only 13.
My father has an account here.
Lester Jacobs.
Next, please?
Could I have that paper with my signature on it, please?
Thank you.
Crab apples. No grapes this year.
How are you two getting along out here?
- Everything all right?
- Yes, just fine.
You do remember me?
I'm Cora Hallet.
Your father leased this house from me.
Yeah, I remember you.
- Where did this come from?
- It's my father's.
This belongs here.
That table and braided rug belong over there.
Poets aren't supposed to live like other people, is that it?
I keep forgetting to ask him to autograph one for me.
"I love you." Signed, "Father."
Nice and simple.
We don't see much of you two in the village.
Not even at the market.
Well, the market does deliver.
If one can afford it.
Do you want me to give a message to my father?
Such a shame about those grapes.
Nobody bothered to spray.
I can give my father any message.
I came for the jelly glasses.
For as long as I can remember... the owners and I have made jelly out of those grapes.
The glasses are in the cellar.
Your father's not home?
No, he isn't.
Oh, that's too bad.
I was having a little gathering at my house and I was hoping that...
Is he in the village?
No, he's in New York.
When I was outside,
I could have sworn I heard voices.
Hebrew?
I should think French would be more help.
Or Italian.
Lord knows there are enough of them around these days to speak it with.
Are you sure you don't want to give my father a message?
So many outsiders in the village these days.
Oh, from London.
- Yeah.
- I adore crosswords.
Well, you can take it with you if you like.
- But your father's doing it.
- I'm doing it.
And Hebrew.
My son's children tell me... you gave them some birthday cake the other night.
He came inside the house?
- My son?
- Yeah, he came inside.
Your father?
Your father was here that evening?
He was in his study.
When he's working, he can't be disturbed.
Since that evening, my son's been back?
No.
- Not been back at all?
- No.
If my son should come back and your father isn't here... it might be better if you didn't let him in.
Well, he didn't ask my permission the first time.
I hope you didn't intend that to sound so rude.
I'll tell my father you said not to let your son inside the door.
That won't be necessary.
Maybe I don't understand what you want, Mrs. Hallet.
One thing I certainly do not want... is to go on and on about something that doesn't matter in the slightest.
I came for jelly glasses.
We'll get them now.
Your son says I have pretty hair.
Did he tell you that?
We'll get the glasses now.
They're in the cellar.
We'll move this table... so I can get the rug up and raise the trap door.
My father and I like the table where it is.
But the glasses are in the cellar.
I'll get them for you later,
Mrs. Hallet.
Move the table.
This is my house.
You are an extraordinarily rude little girl... who's going to do exactly as I say.
Last week you took the only good grapes we have... and now the crab apples.
And you never asked if you might.
And today you just walked bang into my house!
- This is not your house!
- My house!
Leased.
You're 13.
Why aren't you in school?
Thirteen means I have no rights, is that it?
Thirteen means you should be in school.
- Look at me when I speak to you.
- I study at home.
It so happens I'm a member of the school board.
When we meet on Monday, they'll be very interested in your case.
Now, where's your father?
- I told you, he's in New York.
- Exactly where in New York?
He's having lunch with his publisher.
I want the publisher's telephone number.
- I don't have it.
- The publisher's name?
This one's London.
Your father will telephone me the moment he comes back, understood?
This is my house.
What are you doing here?
It's Saturday afternoon.
Why aren't you at the game?
I've gotta do this report on government... and I need to know when the school board holds its meetings.
Well, would it help you to visit one?
No. Actually, all I really need to know is when it meets.
Twice monthly.
Someone told me it's meeting this Monday.
No, the board meets again a week from Thursday.
These are the bylaws.
- If you need any further help...
- No. This is super. Thank you.
But you shouldn't be working now.
You should be at the ball game.
The Wildcats need all the help they can get.
Whose class are you doing the paper for?
Excuse me. Maybe I can get there by halftime.
You're a liar, Mrs. Hallet.
You're a liar.
Rynn, where you going?
Back home.
If you can wait a second,
I'll give you a lift.
No, really. I'm fine.
I was hoping maybe you and...
Some other time, then.
Could you give your mother a message for me?
Tell her I have those jelly glasses... and any time she wants to come by, they'll be there.
I can come by later myself, if you like.
I think it'd be better if she came.
My father wants to talk to her.
Yeah, I'll tell her.
- Everything all right, miss?
- Fine, officer.
I mean, he wasn't bothering you, was he?
Mr. Hallet?
Your folks let you wander around town by yourself?
I live with my father. He lets me come into town when I want.
- What's your name?
- Rynn Jacobs.
Do you have a name, officer?
Oh, sure, yeah. Sorry.
The name's Miglioriti.
- Miglioriti.
- Yeah. You got it.
But call me Ron.
Miglioriti. That's a nice name.
It's Italian.
It's hard for most Americans.
And have the Miglioritis been living in this town a long time?
Hey, you sound like you've been talking to Mrs. Hallet.
To her, if you weren't on the first ship that put in here... you'll always be an immigrant.
I guess we're the newest, me and my father.
You've been here, what, a couple of months?
Yeah, about that.
Like it?
- Is school okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Yeah, being new isn't easy.
- There's the lane.
Around here, folks can be a little cold at first... but when you've been here longer, they'll seem even colder.
Thanks for the ride.
Maybe I could have a talk with your father.
- Why?
- Nothing to worry your head about.
Well, I can't disturb him when he's working.
Yeah, well, let's see if he is.
Sorry, he's working.
He's translating some Russian poetry.
When that door's locked,
I can't bother him.
I suspect the only reason Mrs. Hallet lets us into her village... is because my father's a poet.
Mrs. Hallet loves poets.
That's one of his books over there.
- He wrote that, huh?
- Yeah.
Want him to sign a copy for you?
Yeah, sure. I never met a real poet.
I mean, look, don't laugh at me... but I can't believe people like poetry.
I'm not talking about that birthday-card stuff, but real poetry.
I mean, when it doesn't even rhyme.
No, I'm not laughing at you.
My father says that most people who say they like poetry... only pretend to like it. You're honest.
He's your favourite poet, huh?
No. He's my father.
Emily Dickinson's my favourite.
Emily Dickinson, yeah.
You know, it can be pretty nice here in the village once you get used to it.
And just don't let Mrs. Hallet hassle you.
Her son says I'm a pretty girl.
That what he said?
What is he, a pervert?
I guess that means little girls shouldn't accept candy from him.
- Not if they're smart little girls.
- Don't worry, I won't.
I'm glad you came by, though.
Yeah, me too, I'm glad, but...
Do you like turkey?
Well, to tell you the truth, no.
You know, birds are reptiles from way back.
Biologically.
Yeah, well, then I guess you don't wanna buy a raffle ticket, huh?
You mean if we buy a raffle ticket, we might win a turkey?
For Thanksgiving.
Yeah, a big 20-pounder.
- A big turkey, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah, all right, we'll take two tickets.
Two dollars.
Look, I really hate to do this, you know? I mean...
It's all right.
Hold on. Here.
There's one for you, and one for your father.
And we'll see which one's the lucky one, okay?
All right.
- Thank your father too.
- Sure.
- See you around.
- Bye-bye.
Hello?
- I may come in.
- I invited you, Mrs. Hallet.
We had a meeting of the school board this morning.
I spoke to them about you.
I must say, when they heard about your case, they were very interested.
I was just about to put a kettle on.
Would you like some tea?
Very interested in your case.
You don't wanna hear what they said?
As for tea, Darjeeling or Earl Grey?
I came here prepared to forget about yesterday... but I must say, I don't care for your tone any better today.
Well, then it's up to me to apologise.
What I find particularly surprising... is that most boys and girls who are educated in England... are so well-behaved.
What did you decide for the tea?
Not a glass of that thick, sweet wine... you people use in your religious rituals?
Or aren't you old enough to drink wine?
You told my son 14, you told me 13.
Now, which is it to be?
- Thirteen.
- And brilliant.
As so many of your people are.
Mrs. Hallet, will you please accept my apology for what happened yesterday?
I'm afraid it isn't that simple.
You told my son your father wished to speak to me?
I certainly wish to speak to him.
Call him.
Well, he's translating right now.
I couldn't disturb him even for Officer Miglioriti.
Officer Miglioriti works for people like me.
In case you're wondering...
I'm waiting right here until you do call your father.
You never answered about the tea.
I can't imagine what made any of us think you could be happy here.
My father and I love this house.
No, I think we'll make other plans.
Our lease is for three years.
Leases have known to be broken.
Unless, of course, your father and I could come to some understanding.
And what would that be, Mrs. Hallet?
There it is again, that continual mocking tone.
And don't look at me with those hurt eyes... and pretend you've been misunderstood.
You and I both know you say exactly what you intend.
Here are your glasses, Mrs. Hallet.
I'm being dismissed?
Call your father. Right this minute.
Not when he's working.
You and I know perfectly well he isn't there.
Go in that study, Mrs. Hallet, and I tell my father about your son.
- My son?
- About Halloween.
I haven't told my father yet.
- Told your father what?
- What happened here.
Everybody in the village knows about your son.
Miglioriti. He's a liar.
He hates my son.
Did he tell you he had an affair with my son's wife before they were married?
I even had to ask him why the police don't do anything about it.
Why should they do anything?
When your son gives candy to pretty little girls?
Your jelly glasses, Mrs. Hallet.
- You are gonna get out of this house.
- My house!
With or without your father!
Sure, this is a lonely place.
Often I'm alone.
That doesn't worry me, Mrs. Hallet.
And if it worries you, that's a problem you'd better take up with your son.
Goddamn you!
No seals.
Without rubber seals, these glasses are worthless.
The seals are in the cellar.
And this time, don't you dare tell me to come back later.
Get out of my house!
I'm warning you, Mrs. Hallet.
Get out of my house!
Mrs. Hallet, I'm warning you!
Hi. You been driving long?
How come you're in this car?
- How come you're dressed like that?
- Because I'm a magician.
And what's that, your magic wand?
Oh, it's my cane. I'm a cripple.
- I guess I should say I'm sorry.
- Why? It's not your fault.
Saturday, when all my brothers are playing football...
I'm putting on a magic show... for some rich kid's birthday party.
Let's see you do something magic.
Say, aren't you too young to drive?
Well, my neighbor's supposed to take it.
My father's really counting on it being at the station when he gets in.
You think you could take it?
I can pay you.
Say, you know you got a chipped tooth?
- How come I never see you in school?
- I don't go to school.
- You sick or something?
- No, school is stultifying.
You say this was your father's car?
No, no. What I said was that my father needs it at the station.
- It's hers.
- Whose?
Old lady Hallet's.
It's a beauty. Only 34,000 miles on it.
I ought to know.
My father has a service station.
He works on it.
- She's lending it to us.
- No way.
She's letting my father.
She won't even let her own creep son drive it.
- Here's $5.
- I'm already late for my magic show.
You gonna come back afterwards?
Please?
- Look, I need your help.
- Maybe after the magic show.
You promise?
Ma, the new trick with the hand puppet went over really big.
I'm still here at the birthday party.
No, Ma, they asked me, really.
They asked me to stay for dinner too.
Just hamburgers and Cokes.
Come on, tell Tom he can take her to the movie for a change.
It's his turn anyway.
Look, I'll talk to you later, okay?
Good...
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye-bye.
You don't have any brothers or sisters, do you?
No.
That's something I can't even imagine.
- Hey, light the candles, huh?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hey, that's a pretty dress.
- Thanks.
My father and I bought it in Morocco.
Hey, they smoke a lot of hash there.
They do a lot of things there.
Did you ever smoke hash?
Hundreds of times.
- Yeah? No kidding?
- Yeah.
You're a regular hippie, huh?
No, not really.
Go ahead, sit down. Want some wine?
- Do you?
- No, I hate it.
Me too.
You're a pretty good cook.
- Is that so surprising?
- I only meant for being 13 and all.
How old do you have to be before people start treating you like a person?
- Hey, Mario.
- Yeah?
Thanks about the car and stuff.
You know, you may be smart, but you're stupid.
I mean, if you wanted to get her car away from the front of the house... why go to all the hassle of taking it down to the station?
You see, the trick in magic... is to do the one thing so simple and so obvious... that no one ever thinks of it.
You see? What's simpler than putting the car back where it came from?
Did anyone see you take her car back to her office?
Jesus, you think I wanna get busted... for ripping off old lady Hallet's most prized possession?
You know, you don't even trust me enough to tell me why I did it.
You did it to help me.
Did you lock her car doors?
You should've put them through her office mailbox.
No, I shouldn't. Let me tell you.
I'm sitting there in her Bentley in the dark, right... in front of her goddamn office, trying not to let anybody see me... and ask me what I'm doing.
I gotta be careful, right?
Now, I may not know why Mrs. Hallet didn't drive her own car back... but one thing I do know:
Why would Mrs. Hallet put her own keys... through her own goddamn office mailbox?
She wouldn't. She'd keep her keys.
They'd be wherever she is.
I feel like some wine.
Hey, now, this is pretty fancy.
Doesn't even unscrew.
It's got a cork and everything.
Now, this is class.
You still didn't tell me why. How come she didn't drive her car back?
- So, what do you care?
- I risked my goddamn ass for you.
You didn't have to.
Look, you better tell me what the hell is going on... because if I'd left that car down at the station like you told me... everybody in the village would've recognized it.
You don't trust anybody, do you?
- You want another lamb chop?
- Shouldn't we save it for your father?
He's staying overnight in New York.
Hey, you never said that.
- Have you ever stayed alone before?
- Sure, hundreds of times.
Like all those times you smoked hash?
- Aren't you scared?
- Of what?
- Of being alone.
- No.
You know, last week on TV
I saw this old woman... who was strangled with a body stocking.
I mean, it can happen.
You know you got an outside light?
- Leave it on all the time, okay?
- Thanks.
You know, with me, you got an indoor light.
Hey, that's neat.
Well, Mr. Show Biz, that's me.
You need more of an audience.
I'd like you to meet Gordon.
Gordon.
Isn't he cute?
- Hey, hi, Gordon.
- Get away.
You don't even trust me with your rat.
- It's a hamster.
- It looks like a rat.
- You look like a rat.
- No.
- Come here.
- You got any pets?
No, just my parents, which I water and feed regularly.
How nice.
I think we gotta get Gordon back to the cage.
I'll make a deal with you.
You tell me about the car,
I'll tell you why I'm crippled.
No.
It was polio shots.
See, I have so many brothers and sisters... that my mother forgot who did and who didn't.
Okay, now I wanna know about the car. All of it.
We have some peach ice cream.
Would you like some?
No.
- The car.
- Her car?
Did you leave any fingerprints?
Presto! No fingerprints.
You're so magic, let's see you do a trick.
- Okay. Hold on to my cane.
- I want a trick!
- Hold on to my cane.
- All right.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now make an automobile disappear.
- You already did that.
- Well, then, behold, I shall disappear.
Now, go hide your eyes in the corner and don't peek.
Okay, you ready? Now, don't peek.
Don't peek, Gordon.
Here we go. One, two, three.
Ready or not, here I come.
Mario?
Hey, Mario?
Mario?
Give me that!
Well, Mary-fucking-Poppins.
- Give me that!
- Come and get it.
Give it!
Mario.
Mario, I mean it. Now, stop.
Mario.
Listen.
Somebody's out there. Okay.
Hey, it's a police car.
Hey, don't worry. It's my uncle Ron.
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.
Would you like a glass of wine?
Yeah, it's okay. You're off duty.
Hey, so, what's happening, unc?
I mean, where's your
Playmate of the Week?
She's waiting outside in the car.
You know, he likes the ones who look like they were... blown up with a bicycle pump, you know?
What, are you gonna bust us for drinking here? I won't have it.
You're just lucky
I don't smell any grass.
You got any? I'll buy it cheap.
No respect. No respect for the law.
Respect? You want respect?
He wants respect, and he's using his police car to get all his action.
Just the two of you, huh?
My father's sleeping.
- You met her father?
- Oh, yeah, nice guy.
He had dinner with you, huh?
Hey, how many plates you see here?
I count two. One...
Yeah, okay, okay, wise guy. All right.
He was tired, so he went upstairs to bed.
Candlelight, wine and a fireplace.
It's really very romantic.
Frank Hallet called in twice.
- He said his mother's missing.
- She's probably out house-pimping.
Mario don't like the Hallets.
Me? I don't think you like them too much either.
I remember he tried to get Hallet busted... for dragging some little girl into the bushes.
He couldn't do it, though.
All Hallet's mother did was marry the creep off...
- to some waitress with two kids.
- That's enough.
- To prove he was normal.
- Don't be such a smart-ass.
Anyway, her car's in front of the office, but no sign of her.
And Hallet said he was coming over here... to pick up some jelly glasses or something like that.
Yeah, well, you see, they're still here waiting for her.
- No one's touched them.
- So she never came by, huh?
- No.
- So you came looking for her here?
I came here because I thought that Rynn might be alone.
Did you think that fink would be waiting here for you to catch him?
Look, if you don't want your mom and dad to know you were here...
- don't be such a smart-ass.
- Who's a smart-ass?
Why don't you teach him some manners.
Oh, if Mrs. Hallet comes by, could you have her call the police station?
- Okay?
- Fine.
- Thanks for the wine.
- Good night.
And don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- I mean, that was scary, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
Wasn't it? How'd you like the way
I made your father disappear?
- You lied.
- You bet your ass.
What did you want me to do anyway?
Well, where do you think you're going?
Just testing.
Like, you don't really want me to go or anything, do you? Do you, huh?
- No.
- Oh, you got feelings, huh?
I thought you were a piece of cardboard. Come.
Come on.
Are you crazy?
He's back. Come on.
Go ahead, answer the door.
- You ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.
Hello.
May I come in?
I think it's time you and I had a little talk, don't you agree?
Are these the famous jelly jars?
Hello.
Only two for dinner?
Did your father quit smoking, Rynn?
Give us a light, son.
It's cold in here. Let's put some more wood on the fire.
I'll get it.
Hello, Gordon.
Where's your father, Rynn?
Do you love Gordon?
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, I love Gordon.
And I think Gordon loves you too.
No!
Hey, what are you? A maniac?
The son of a bitch bit me.
Give me some disinfectant.
It's upstairs in the medicine cabinet.
Now, listen to me, young lady.
I know you're up to something.
And I wanna know where your father is.
What'll you tell me this time?
He's working? Or sleeping?
Did he have dinner here?
- Did you have dinner here, son?
- Yep.
Just you and pretty Rynn?
Yep.
- And where's he?
- Who?
- Who are we talking about?
- Oh, her father's sleeping.
- Upstairs?
- Upstairs.
- You were gonna say in the study.
- No.
- Don't lie to me, damn it. You were.
- No, I wasn't.
- Who is he?
- I'm Mario Podesta.
- I asked you. Who is he?
- He's Mario Podesta.
Oh, yes. I think I've seen you hobbling around the village, haven't I?
- My uncle's a cop.
- Really?
He was just here.
- Why was he here?
- And he's coming back.
- That's not what I asked you.
- Tell him.
Yes, tell me.
He said you called about your mother.
Said you might come looking for her.
Why would my dear mother be here?
Unless she ran off with the man of the house... which has happened on occasion.
- She's not here.
- No, it was about the jelly glasses.
The other day you said you didn't have any boyfriends.
Yes.
- Are you her boyfriend?
- Yes.
You told me no boyfriends.
She's very young.
Did she tell you how old she was?
- Thirteen.
- Don't you know any girls your age?
Or do girls your age like to dance?
- The jelly glasses.
- What about them?
- You can take them now.
- Not now.
Perhaps Mother came by but you weren't home.
I was here all the time.
- Didn't you go to the football game?
- I couldn't have missed her.
So you say you've been here all along?
- Yeah.
- That's very strange.
You can take the glasses now.
- I'll put them in your car.
- Will you?
- Yeah, I'll do it right now.
- No, you can't.
No car.
See, I walked here tonight, as my dear wife has the station wagon.
As for the Bentley, dear Mother has the keys.
What do you want, Mr. Hallet?
- What do you want, son?
- What do you mean?
You want what all boyfriends want.
You don't like girls?
- Yes, I like girls.
- You don't want Rynn?
Be a good little magician, will you, son?
Disappear yourself.
Tell him to get out of here.
- He's my friend.
- But not your boyfriend.
First, I shall tell you what I want.
I wanna know what's been happening here in this house.
I wanna know what happened here today!
Nothing happened.
All day is a long time for nothing to happen.
Just now the police were here.
Yes or no? That happened, didn't it?
The police were here, yes or no?
Officer Miglioriti came to say you were looking for your mother.
Go on.
- There are the jelly glasses.
- Meaning what?
- Meaning she hasn't been here.
- That doesn't prove anything.
- I guess I can't help you, can I?
- Do you wanna help me?
- Do you wanna help me, son?
- Sure.
Then get your ass the hell out of here right now.
Hey, Rynn, call the cops.
Be my guest.
What's the matter, gimp?
Got trouble staying on your feet?
I didn't think you'd call.
Hit the road, wop.
- We'll both go.
- No, just you and your goddamn cape.
Get out of here.
I'm a wop. Wops carry knives, right?
Guinea. Dago. Wop.
Easy, son. Easy.
I take it back. I take it all back.
What do they call guys like you who hang around little girls?
A pervert?
You know, if I stick this in your guts, all the cops will do is thank me.
Now, I think you'd better get the hell out of here.
Get out of here!
- Call the cops.
- No.
Little son of a bitch.
I'm not through with you, that's for damn sure.
Is it hers?
Yeah.
Come on.
Oh, boy.
That's trouble.
I mean, how did...?
Why don't you take the cookies in where the tea will be.
Mario?
Rynn, how long has it been for your mother?
October 17th.
I don't understand.
I mean, don't bodies...?
- Decompose?
- Yeah.
Well, you can put stuff on them.
So why don't you take the tray in next to the fire, all right?
Yeah.
How do you know how to do that stuff?
I looked it up in the library.
In London we found out my father was dying.
My mother had run away when I was 3.
He didn't want her to get her red fingernails into me ever again.
We left England without a word to anyone.
It was the end of the summer when I came here... and I knew this was the place.
But he said I should think it over for a week... to make sure I wanted to spend the next three years of my life here.
The rent's paid up for the next three years.
So three more years like this?
Almost all September, he looked fine.
If the pain was terrible, he never said anything.
Then one Sunday evening... we were sitting in this room... and he whispered to me in a very soft voice... that I wasn't like anybody else in the world... that people wouldn't understand me.
They'd order me around, tell me what to do... and try to make me into the person they wanted me to be.
Since I was only a kid,
I couldn't say anything.
I'd have to stay alone... keep out of trouble and make myself very small in the world.
All alone?
We worked out every detail.
We knew it wouldn't be easy.
Here's a letter from my father.
"Don't give in and play their game.
Fight them any way you have to.
Survive."
That's what he said.
Then he kissed me... and walked off into the trees and down the lane.
In that room, I found charts of tide tables and waters... in the sound and the ocean.
He'll never be found.
Did you cry a lot?
Depends what you mean by a lot.
No. I guess not very much.
Do you believe in God?
- It'd be nice.
- But you don't.
I don't know.
You know, it's all so goddamn wild.
I mean... there's so many problems.
- How do you pay for stuff?
- Traveler's checks.
Yeah, kids can have them too.
I keep them in a safe-deposit box in the bank.
I have to make them last for three years.
- How'd your mother find you?
- By lying to my father's publisher.
She walked right in.
Fingernails as red as ever.
My God, the nerve of her.
She sat right over there.
Smoked her gold-tipped cigarettes... went on and on about the pollution in the Mediterranean... and how marvelous it would be to stay here.
I hated myself for doing it, but I actually acted happy to see her.
She asked me for a drink, but I lied and told her we didn't have any.
I gave her some tea with the same almond biscuits.
They're very good.
My father had given me a small bottle containing some white powder.
He said if she should arrive,
I should put it in her tea.
It would calm her, make her less aggressive.
Well, it sure did.
But you didn't know what it was, huh?
No, not until after.
I looked it up based on its properties.
- Potassium cyanide.
- And that's what you put in her tea?
Father meant what he said about doing anything you have to to survive.
How come you're not drinking yours?
Mine's still too hot.
I didn't put in any cold milk.
I can still see her red nails holding up that cup.
After a few sips, she said that the tea tasted of almonds.
"It's the almond cookies," I told her.
"They come from Fortnum's."
She loved that.
- How long did it take?
- Quite fast, actually.
You mean, like, first you can't breathe?
Yeah. Apparently.
What's wrong with you? You okay?
Yeah, now I'm okay.
I'm all right.
Listen.
It's just the wind.
Sounds like it's alive.
Look, about the telephone.
We better not call each other from now on... because somebody might be listening, okay?
Okay.
Let's go.
I'm not gonna play their game.
Would that be so awful?
The game is pretending, you know?
It's like going through the motions of living without really living.
But what about school?
School is having people tell you what life is... and never finding out by yourself.
Yeah, but kids have to go to school.
Why?
Okay, so your father taught you.
Everybody doesn't have a father like yours.
Everybody can't be like you.
If I'd listened to them,
I'd be like them.
Damn. You keep saying "them" like everyone's out to get you.
Maybe they are.
Well, you gotta trust somebody.
Mario!
Come on.
Mario.
Come on, Mario. Mario!
You all right?
I've got a tub waiting for you upstairs.
Hello?
Mr. Hallet?
Mr. Hallet, I know this is you... because everybody else is at the football game this afternoon.
I should warn you that the police are watching our house... right this very minute, Mr. Hallet.
I found a pair of your father's pajamas.
It's a pretty good fit.
Come on, you're shivering. Sit down.
- Who called?
- No one.
Rynn, who called?
Well, whoever called didn't leave their name.
Was it Hallet?
- Yeah.
- That creep.
You're like ice.
Come on.
- Is that better?
- Yeah.
It's dark already.
Mario... if you want,
I can get into bed with you.
- Is that better?
- Yeah.
Mario?
I know what you're gonna ask.
Have you ever?
Hundreds of times.
Do they expect you home for dinner?
Would it be so terrible if you didn't go?
I mean, if your parents did find out about us?
Your uncle Ron knows.
Look, Rynn, they'd wanna know all about you.
Every goddamn thing.
And I'm not as good at lying as you are.
Here, take this. It's my father's.
Like your father said in that letter:
Since when do they let kids do what they want?
- Come back after dinner?
- I'll try.
- Who is it?
- Ron Miglioriti.
Hi. I'm just making my Saturday-night call.
Yeah, come on in.
- You all right?
- Fine.
- How are you?
- Fine, fine, thanks.
- Can I get you anything...?
- No, no. I can't stay, really.
Your pumped-up lady waiting for you?
Sorry. Does make me sound like a smart-ass, doesn't it?
- You're all alone, huh?
- My father's here.
Rynn, I don't believe what you've been telling me about your father.
No?
No, no, you're gonna tell me that he's in there working, right?
He was this afternoon. Translating.
Then he was, and now he isn't?
That's it, huh?
No, he's resting upstairs.
I've been here three times.
And each time I notice how good you are with words.
The way you speak, you're very careful.
You're too goddamn careful.
- You don't believe he's upstairs, then?
- No.
All right.
Father!
Father?
- He should be down in a minute.
- Yeah, sure.
Look, I understand, because I haven't been telling you the truth all the time.
Because my father isn't a well man.
Maybe you don't understand about poets.
Edgar Allen Poe was a drug addict.
Dylan Thomas drank himself to death.
Sylvia Plath took her own life.
Rynn, we're talking about your father.
Yeah, well...
Sometimes my father goes into his room and locks the door.
He keeps something in a desk drawer.
I don't know what it is.
But I know... when he locks that door... he doesn't want me to see the way he becomes, you know?
That may sound stupid, but you don't know my...
Yes, Rynn, what is it?
Father, I'd like you to meet
Officer Miglioriti.
- You know, the one I told you about.
- Good evening, sir.
- Sorry to bother you.
- Yes, quite all right. Quite all right.
I'm the one to apologise.
I confess to being a bit tired.
So how can my daughter and I help you?
No, no problem, no problem.
Rynn, nip into my study, get one of my books, will you?
And a pen, please.
Rynn tells me we've promised you an autographed copy.
If you'd be good enough to spell Miglioriti.
"Ron" will be okay.
Yes, Ron, okay. Here.
Ron, from Lester.
Well, it's really been nice to meet you, sir.
Yes, it's a pleasure. Good night.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- See you later, Rynn.
- Good night.
Guess I owe you an apology, huh?
That's all right. Don't worry about it.
- Good night.
- I hope you enjoy the book.
Thanks.
You were great. Your voice was so deep.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's this damn cold.
How do you spell Miglioriti?
How would I have known if you hadn't come back?
- I would have come back anyway.
- I hoped you would.
Remember? You said
I don't trust anybody.
You know, we should have told
Uncle Ron what he was interrupting.
A gentleman never tells.
Well, maybe in England they don't... but here they never shut up about it.
I'll bet half... Well, hell, most of the football team... that's all they ever do, is talk about it.
You know, I won't tell anybody.
You know, we have to trust each other... because most people don't go through as much as we have.
Not even in a whole entire lifetime.
No one will know about us.
I never knew how much I needed you.
Ever think maybe I'm playing your game?
Because you want to?
No. Because I love you.
Thank you.
- You're gonna catch my cold.
- I don't care.
You know, when I told you
I didn't mind being alone, I lied.
Don't ever leave, okay?
With all this snow, it's a good time to see... if you and your father have had any visitors.
I love detective stories.
Do you read Agatha Christie?
All her murder mysteries take place... in the most beautiful old English country houses.
See these?
Footprints. They're mine and my father's, I expect.
They're not very clear.
As long as you're here, you wanna give me a hand?
You know, I can't figure you out at all.
You haven't even asked me about Mario.
- What about him?
- He's in the hospital.
Pneumonia.
How bad?
Well, without the antibiotics, he would've died.
I've gotta see him. I've gotta see him.
Can you go now?
- You've seen him?
- Yeah.
He was delirious and talking out loud.
About the two of you.
Yes?
Saying how much he loves you.
Mario.
Mario?
Mario, I love you.
My father worked it all out.
How I'd live.
What I'd do.
But it can't work.
It can't work without you.
He was wrong.
No...
Oh, Mario.
Anything for a trick.
You weren't sick at all.
- Get out of here!
- Trick or treat.
Mr. Hallet, if you leave right now,
I won't say a word, okay?
Call the police? No?
Why don't you call your father.
The least you could do is offer me a cup of tea after I got all dressed up.
If anybody came by... naturally they'd assume I was your little friend, don't you think?
I even limped.
Officer Miglioriti's gonna be coming by.
Officer Miglioriti is at his stupid raffle.
It's awful dirty down there in the cellar.
I had no idea what I'd find.
Certainly not those damn jelly jars.
I'll show you what I did find, if you're interested.
A hairpin.
Not yours, though. No.
You wouldn't wear pins in that pretty hair.
- Could've been down there for years.
- No, it would've rusted.
Besides, it still smells of the perfume...
I gave my mother for Christmas last year.
One more thing.
A bright-red broken fingernail, wouldn't you say?
I wonder who that belongs to.
Not my mother's colour at all.
No telling what the police could come up with down there.
Or out in the garden.
At least I should thank you... for bringing the Bentley back to the office, though.
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
Had to call a locksmith.
Any idea where the keys might be?
Perhaps on that chain around your pretty neck.
- Where are you going?
- You said you wanted some tea.
There are some details still to be worked out, of course.
Not to worry.
I'll enjoy figuring them out on our long winter nights together.
Hello?
Officer Miglioriti. What? Oh, really?
That's great.
No, no, not now.
I'll manage.
Okay, thanks. Bye.
Rule number one: No secrets.
I won the stupid Thanksgiving turkey.
Congratulations.
And you told him not to bring it by.
Very wise.
You know... there's no reason you shouldn't go right on living the way you have been.
Only now, of course, we'll be friends, you and I.
Just us two, huh?
We could become very good friends.
I like the way you handled yourself on the phone.
You are brilliant.
You're inventive and resourceful... very cool under fire.
You know how to survive, don't you?
I thought I did.
What about Mario?
- He's in the hospital.
- He knows. Everything.
- Maybe he'll die.
- The doctor says no.
It really doesn't matter, you know.
He's an accomplice.
- Mr. Hallet?
- Yes, my dear?
Will you tell your wife?
What?
Will you tell your wife?
Well, suppose you let me take care of that, okay?
The fire's catching.
It's nice and cozy now, huh?
- What are we listening to?
- Chopin. Piano Concerto No. 1.
Yes.
It's lovely.
- You want milk?
- Yes, please.
Thank you.
- Would you like some sugar?
- Just one, please.
I'll expect you to remember that.
That's easy. It's the same as I take.
Nothing like a nice hot cup of tea, is there?
No.
- Something wrong, my dear?
- No.
Why aren't you drinking your tea?
I'm waiting for you. You're the guest.
You put more milk in yours.
Did I?
Actually, that's the way I prefer mine.
I'd prefer yours.
Look at me when I talk to you.
I want yours.
Gives us more a feeling of sharing, don't you agree?
Ladies first.
No, wait.
Is it good?
Just right.
You know why I switched cups, don't you?
- No.
- Oh, now, think.
Some sort of test?
Just so you remember, none of your little tricks.
Tea tastes like almonds.
Must be the almond cookies.
Oh, yes.
Excuse me.
You should see the way the fire... lights up your hair.
All yellow and gold.
Such lovely hair.
25.000 English-HI
Los, los weiter.
Los weiter, schnell.
Komm her da!
- Platz da!
- (# Rousing music from loudspeaker)
- Das ist verboten.
- Is the night train to Basel running?
- Nur für Militär.
- Can't you speak English?
- Bringen Sie die beiden weg.
- The fellow doesn't speak English.
Typical. They put them in uniforms and they can't even answer simple questions.
Der nächste Zug für Zivilisten geht morgen.
No train till tomorrow.
No train?
We have reserved seats, my dear fellow.
Well, what do you suggest we do, Charters?
- I suppose we'd better find a hotel.
- I suppose we'd better.
You know, the...the ill manners and the inefficiency of this race is abominable.
Couldn't run a whelk stall.
- Hotel. Ho-tel.
- Yes, OK.
Bitte.
- (Charters) Hotel.
- OK.
Schnell weitergehen.
Bring the bags, will you?
- Is this going on all night?
- I sincerely hope not.
Good evening. A room for two with a private bath, please.
- Facing the mountains.
- And a separate how's-your-fathers.
I'm sorry, gentlemen, there are no rooms left.
- No rooms?
- Impossible.
This hotel is full. The trains are disrupted by military movements.
You're welcome, of course, to sleep on the sofas in the upstairs lounge.
- Sleep on the sofas?
- In the lounge?
Where are going to change for dinner?
Slip into the old soup and fish.
- I don't think he understands.
- Maybe Bavarians don't dress for dinner.
This is no time to be funny.
Excuse me. Can you tell me if the night train to Basel is still delayed?
It will leave at noon tomorrow, madam.
Oh. Oh, how very unfortunate.
- Third rate country, what do you expect?
- Typical.
Mmm! Wrong year, we'll have to send her back!
Go on, Amanda, bash on regardless.
Do you suppose they're some of the bright young things we read about in the press?
Doesn't seem to me they're so very bright. Nor, may I say, so very young!
- Everything all right, gentlemen?
- Who are they?
- Not British, I hope.
- Probably Americans.
More champagne!
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is my pleasure and honour... to present to you...
- Mrs Amanda...
- (Cheering)
Metcalfe...
Madvani...
Von Hoffstetter Kelly!
Who will favour us this evening... with one of her world famous imitations.
Amanda! Amanda!
We want Amanda! Amanda, my love!
We want Amanda, Amanda, Amanda!
We want Amanda!
Excuse me. Will you let me through?
I...I'm a doctor.
She looks uncomfortable.
I'll loosen her clothing.
No, that won't be necessary.
(Doctor) You might have a headache for a day or two.
Now, you need a good rest - and no more to drink.
Hello?
Hello?
Bus for the station leaves in fifteen minutes.
I say, there's a train here leaves Basel at 21:20.
- Twenty from twenty-four...
- Twenty past nine, that's no good.
No, there's nothing later than last month.
I don't suppose there's a wireless set hereabouts?
Awful to be left in the dark, Caldicott.
Our communications cut off in a time of crisis. Last news from home was grim.
- "England on the brink."
- Newspaper sensationalism.
The old country's been in tight spots before.
London? Mr Salter's call to London?
Yes, hold on, I'll get him at once.
Mr Salter. Mr Salter!
Mr Salter!
Go on, risk it. Go on, go on.
Hello? I say, you in London.
No, no, this isn't Salter. The name's
Charters, we've sent for Salter.
I say, what's happening to England?
Blowing a gale?
No, no, no, you don't follow me at all, sir.
I'm inquiring about the Test match.
The Te... Cricket, sir, cricket.
You can't be in England and not know the Test score.
- Fellow says he doesn't know.
- Silly ass!
Er, hello, are you there?
I say, could you find out for us?
Oh, nonsense. Only take a minute, what?
Oh, very well. If you won't, you won't.
Wasting my time. Fellow's an ignoramus.
Let's get on the back of the bus before someone recognises me.
Oh, darling, don't worry.
No one here knows who you are.
Well, they might, so get on.
Go on, darling, quickly.
Bus for the station leaves in eight minutes.
Good God.
Typical.
Good morning, Mrs Kelly.
You're looking very well. Very fetching.
Actually, I feel fit, very fit indeed.
Madly. Madly fit.
- Would you like to sit down?
- Thank you. Maybe I will.
Just for a minute.
- Where are your friends?
- I don't know. Sleeping, I guess.
They're staying on. I have to leave for London. Getting married on Friday.
Getting married? Isn't that nice?
Congratulations.
- I've been married before, several times.
- I know.
Did I make an unholy spectacle of myself last night?
- You could say that.
- You were present?
- I was.
- And you didn't think it was funny either.
To tell you the God's honest truth,
I thought it was the most amazing exhibition of sheer dumbness
I have ever seen.
This whole continent is going to explode in about 20 minutes and what I think would be really dumb is if it was all triggered off by a madcap American heiress.
Much-married madcap American heiress is how I'm referred to in the press.
- Do I know you?
- Robert Condon.
- Photographer for Life magazine.
- Life magazine? How amusing.
They did my coming-out party at the Plaza.
You weren't one of those cameramen trying to snap pictures in the ladies' room, were you?
I'm sorry to say I was unable to attend.
I was being kicked out of Spain at the time.
- How impressive.
- (Bell ringing)
Last call! The bus for the station is leaving immediately. Hurry!
God, I hope that maid's finished packing.
I must go and see.
- Mrs Kelly.
- Yes?
It's none of my business but are you going London like that?
Oh, that? Oh, I can change on the train.
- (Bell ringing)
- Miss Kelly!
The bus for the station is leaving immediately!
You must come now!
Miss Kelly, we can't wait!
We'll miss the train!
Miss Kelly!
Have them send the luggage on to Mrs Amanda Metcalfe Madvani von Hoffstetter Kelly.
No, make that Lady Amanda
Ogilvie-Gore.
You know how they love a title at Claridge's.
- Or is it the Connaught?
- (Bus hooting)
What is the meaning, Miss Kelly?
You will lose it!
Hey! Bus!
(PA) 'Passagiere bitte in den jetzt da stehenden Zug einsteigen.'
- Fräulein Froy!
- Yes?
- You are Fräulein Froy?
- Yes.
- I have here your ticket.
- Oh.
Oh, but this is for a reserved seat.
How very thoughtful of them.
Thank you, thank you very much.
If this train's on time at Basel,
- we can catch the last day of the match.
- Just hope it's like this at the Oval.
The porter is putting the baggage on train for you.
I'd like to have my hat case, please.
- Let me carry that for you.
- Danke schön.
God, this place is teeming with British.
Sie müssen sich beeilen, der Zug fährt ab.
(PA) 'Will passengers for Switzerland please board the train?
- 'It will stop at Innsbruck, Bregenz...'
- (Whistle blows)
- 'Mullenbach, St Gallen and Basel.'
- (Whistle blows)
'Please close the doors.
The train is ready to leave.'
This is the compartment of the Baroness von Kisling. All seats are reserved.
Why don't you just dry up and blow away?
I believe this is my seat.
Here, let me take this.
That's all right. I'll just fold it up and pop it up there on the rack.
Thank you so much.
- Darf ich Ihnen helfen?
- Nein danke, das schaffe ich alleine.
Hey Sie, kommen Sie her!
Machen Sie schon.
Mensch, wir brauchen Sie.
Wo ist diese Person jetzt?
Unterwegs zum Bahnhof.
Can I do anything to help?
You look as if you've been playing in a coal bin.
Don't tell me I still have...
Why don't we go and see if the dining car is open?
A nice cup of tea will settle your tummy.
And we'll stop in the washroom and wash it off!
By all means.
I said to them, "Don't you play in the coal bin any more."
Thank you.
- Oh!
- Oh! I'm sorry.
Do forgive me. Very clumsy.
That's all right.
I'm just waiting for the waiter.
- If I see him, shall I send him back?
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
What a handsome couple.
She reminds me of an actress.
There are more English people on this train than there are in Piccadilly Circus.
Darling, I do think you're developing a persecution complex.
The last day in the hotel was a nightmare.
Skulking in the corridors,
- dinner in our room...
- Well, I am not exactly unknown.
We missed all the fun. Apparently, that
American girl did an imitation of Hitler.
- Really? How lovely(!)
- I wish we'd been there.
I could have done my Mussolini.
I do a splendid Mussolini.
Oh, darling.
Do stop worrying.
I promise you, that poor lady has no idea who you are.
- Well, it is better to be safe than sorry.
- Mm, yes.
Anyway, isn't it rather nicer to be alone?
Wollen Sie hier Platz nehmen?
They're very friendly, Germans, once you know them. I've spent four years here.
- Guten Tag.
- I think I'll have a nice cup of tea.
Would you like tea or some nice warm Bovril?
Whisky. Large whisky and soda, please.
- Whisky and soda?
- Large.
- And a pot of tea?
- Yes. Oh, just one moment.
Er... Would you mind using this?
Harriman's Herbal, as drunk by a million Mexicans.
"A soothing compound to settle the stomach and soothe the nerves."
- Are you sure you won't try some?
- I've never been more sure of anything.
It's your tummy, you know what to put into it.
Just one moment...
Ginger snaps. Would you pop these onto a plate, please?
And be sure that the water is really boiling for the tea.
- Certainly, madam.
- Yes.
I don't suppose it's really drunk by a million Mexicans but it does make a lovely cup of tea.
- By the way, my name is Froy.
- Did you say Freud?
- (Train roars past)
- Not Freud, Froy.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Froy. Rhymes with "joy"!
Oh, Froy. Froy!
I'm a children's governess and music teacher.
I've just spent an unforgettable four years in Bavaria.
Now I'm going back to England.
To Brighton, that's where my home is.
Well, Hove actually, it's just down the coast a bit.
I work for General von Reider.
Mm, very attractive.
He's such a fine man and such dear children.
- Ahh.
- I hated leaving them.
But with things the way they are it seemed best for me to be off home.
Shame. We had such lovely times together at the castle.
Twenty four in service, plus five gardeners.
- Really?
- I had a lovely room.
- Like to see a picture?
- Love to.
There it is. There I am, right up in the north tower.
The ceiling was all painted blue - like peacock feathers, lined with gold.
And mirrors in the most unusual places.
Thank you.
Would you reserve two places for lunch, please?
- If you'd care to have it with me.
- If I'm still alive.
Well, here we go.
Once more into the breach.
- Try to make it for the first sitting.
- Certainly, madam.
- Thank you.
- (Caldicott) It's a moot point.
There's nothing moot about it.
The fellow simply was not out.
If it hadn't been for the umpires, he'd be batting still.
- I do not understand. If...
- I'll show you.
I saw it. I saw the whole thing. Look.
Here's Hutton at the wicket, there's the umpire, Constantine bowling.
Stollmeyer, Headley, Sealy...
Oh, dear, he's forgot the sugar.
He's at the gasworks end, so the light was on his right.
Constantine bowls.
- Would you pass the sugar, please?
- Pardon?
May I trouble you for the sugar?
I...
If you'd be kind enough to pass the sugar.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
Los, wir müssen uns beeilen. Ab!
Shh!
- I think I'll take a nap too.
- That's a very good idea.
Cover up with your nice fur coat.
It's lovely and soft.
It is soft, isn't it? Yes.
I was given a squirrel coat by a woman I worked for but it was always getting caught in my bicycle wheel.
Now, you have a good sleep and then I'll wake you up in time for a good, hot lunch.
Danke.
Excuse me.
The English lady that was sitting there, do you know where she went?
There has been no English lady here.
- Excuse me?
- There has been no English lady here.
You had perhaps a dream.
It wasn't a dream. I'm talking about the lady that was sitting right there.
We went to the dining car. You remember, you gave her the chocolate.
- Ich versteh nicht.
- You are, I think, still half asleep.
You went and came back alone.
You don't understand.
I'm talking about the lady.
The English lady in the brown hat.
I was feeling ill and she took care of me.
We went to the dining car.
- She had tea and I had whisky.
- Whisky?
That, no doubt, is what is making you confused.
If this is some kind of practical joke,
I find it very unfunny.
- Oh, waiter?
- Yes, madam?
- You served me, right?
- Yes, madam.
Remember the lady with the brown hat?
Have you seen her again?
But madam was alone.
Don't be absurd.
Of course I wasn't alone.
She gave you a pack of tea. Something horrible called Harriman's Herbal.
- You must remember that.
- There was no tea, madam.
Just a whisky and soda.
A large whisky and soda.
Not only that, she paid the check.
I'm sorry, madam, but it was you who paid.
I have the bill if madam would care to look.
Never mind. I'll find her myself.
Excuse me, I'm terribly sorry to disturb you...
Ah, Mrs Kelly!
Which I presume still is your name, unless you've gotten married again on the train.
- You're a swine.
- You know Mrs Rose Flood Porter...
- A complete swine.
- ..and Dr Hartz who saved you last night.
Why didn't you tell me
I had that moustache?
My mother taught me it was bad manners to make personal remarks and if, "Hey, lady, your moustache is showing," isn't a personal remark
I've never heard one! Dr Hartz...
Please! I'm delighted to see you looking well. No trouble with the head?
Clearly just the usual.
There's a woman missing on this train.
I saw her.
Now people keep saying she was never there!
- Lovely weather we're having.
- Really lovely.
- Oh.
- Really very lovely.
- Quite warm.
- Not unpleasantly so, though.
- I find it very pleasant indeed.
- Very pleasant.
Look! If you wanna talk about the weather like a bunch of creeps, go ahead!
That knock on the head last night,
I wonder if it has affected her?
- Imbibes, does she?
- Drinks like a fish.
Blind as a hoot owl, drunk as a skunk.
Disgraceful!
- Mrs Kelly...
- Leave me alone!
- Just take it easy.
- Will you let go of me?
You're hysterical!
Mrs Kelly... May I ask what exactly was troubling you...
- It's Miss Froy.
- Who?
This very sweet English lady who was in my compartment.
- Yes?
- We went and had tea.
Well, she had tea, Harriman's Herbal, a million Mexicans drink it.
I very sensibly had a large whisky and soda.
- Oh.
- We came back, I went to sleep...
- Passed out.
- Shut up, swine.
When I woke up, she was gone.
And now, everybody says she was never there, she never existed.
Even the waiter who brought her tea, even he says that he never saw her.
Now, are they all crazy or am I crazy or what?
Hmm. Why don't we go and have another talk with them?
Perhaps it's just a misunderstanding, something to do with the language.
Come with me.
It's that one.
She speaks English as well as I do, so go in there, tell her you're a doctor and that I won't take any more of this.
Er, please forgive me. There seems to have been a misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding?
Permit me to introduce myself.
My name is Dr Hartz, Dr Egon Hartz.
Dr Hartz? I am the Baroness Kisling.
I'm honoured, Baroness.
And may I present my American friends, Mrs Kelly and Mr Condon, a famous American newspaperman.
The Baroness Kisling.
A great pleasure.
Mrs Kelly and I are travelling together, though we have not been formally introduced.
And now, this misunderstanding.
The English lady sitting there, the one you said you never saw.
I say I did not see her because I did not see her.
And I did not see her because she was never here.
What about these other lovely people?
My servants and their daughter.
Ask them if you like.
She speaks no English.
Ähm, sagen Sie, können Sie sich an eine englische Dame hier erinnern?
Mrs Kelly behauptet, sie wäre gegenüber einer englischen Dame gesessen,
- die dann plötzlich verschwand.
- Nein.
Did your Miss Froy have a bag or something?
Yes! A great big leather one.
She kept it right up... there.
OK.
Well, a lot of other people saw her too.
Those two grumpy Englishmen in the dining car and those two down there.
Please forgive us.
Sorry to disturb you. Remember the English lady who fell in here?
(Man) An English lady who fell into my compartment? No. no, I'm afraid not.
- Come on! I know you both saw.
- This is a little preposterous.
The answer is no. Will you excuse me?
That rat. I'm gonna find Miss Froy if I have to stop this train!
(Robert) What about the guys in the dining car?
That Englishman!
You there, Caldicott?
It's Charters. Can I come in?
- What is it, old man?
- It's that American girl again.
- Says she's lost her friend.
- Well, she's not in here.
No, no. She's threatening to stop the train!
- Oh, Lord!
- We'll miss our connection to Basel.
- This is serious, Charters.
- That's him, that's him.
Hold on, please. I was wondering if you could help us?
- Help you?
- I was having tea with an English lady.
- You saw her.
- I don't know, I was talking to my friend.
Absolutely.
You were at the next table playing some game. She borrowed the sugar.
- I recall passing the sugar.
- Then you saw her.
I was in deep conversation.
We were discussing cricket.
I don't see how a dumb game like cricket can make you forget seeing somebody.
Then there's nothing further to be said. Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- "Dumb game like cricket"!
Typical!
You saw her! I know you did!
- Mrs Kelly.
- But they saw her!
Mrs Kelly, please don't misunderstand me.
I'm not a teetotaller myself. I do, in fact, adore a drop of champagne.
But would you tell me how much...
I'm not even a little bit drunk!
You wanna see me walk a straight line? Watch!
- See?
- (Train screeches)
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Why are we slowing down?
- I don't know.
(Amanda) What is it?
(Hartz) An accident.
Every holiday it is like this.
Last April I was in Klosters for spring skiing.
First day, a girl went headfirst into a tree.
I spent three weeks operating on her.
In the end I saved her face and ruined my holiday.
I hope she was very rich and you charged her a fortune.
I did but it turned out she was having an affair with the skiing instructor, the husband found out and refused to pay my bill. It's a terrible story.
We're stopping. You watch that side.
Make sure she doesn't get off.
Was ist los?
- Was ist geschehen?
- There goes the trainmaster.
Soon they'll all be shouting,
"Is there a doctor on the train?"
Wir suchen einen Mord.
I wish I could imitate your Miss Froy and vanish.
- Somebody could be badly hurt.
- Yes, of course, you're right.
Excuse me. Here we go again.
- See anything?
- (Robert) Nothing.
That Dr Hartz, he's very sweet. Even if he did almost call me an alcoholic.
- Why don't you marry him?
- Shut up.
- Every girl should marry a doctor once.
- Watch! Swine!
An automobile accident. The face.
Luckily there's an excellent hospital in Mullenbach.
I can operate there.
O God, please, this time no amorous skiing instructor, only a rich husband.
Vorsichtig. Ganz langsam.
Not one old lady did I see.
Me either. That means she's still on this train.
You don't give up, do you?
Why did you lie to those people?
Lie? I just didn't want to get involved in some sort of inquiry, that's all.
- Inquiry?
- That girl's capable of anything.
If some idiot woman has disappeared and I'd seen her, we'd both be called as witnesses, wouldn't we?
So?
It might be difficult to explain what we're doing larking about in Bavaria when your husband thinks you're on a cruise with your cousins and my wife is under the impression that I'm on confidential business for the Prime Minister in Paris.
Larking about? Is that what we're doing?
Under the improbable name of Todhunter.
Todhunter's a sweet name.
We had an Airedale named Todhunter.
I'm sure. Look, the last thing we want is some sort of scandal.
- Is that the last thing we want?
- Yes. Yes, it is.
Oh.
You don't believe me because I'm a girl.
She could be in a concentration camp.
We've heard of concentration camps, have we?
- Of course!
- This is a great moment.
The social conscience meets the social register.
Excuse me. You know that lady you're looking for?
- Yes.
- I saw her.
- She was wearing green tweeds?
- Yes.
- And a brown hat?
- With a feather.
- I saw her with you in our compartment.
- You husband said he hadn't seen her.
He didn't notice but after you'd gone
I remembered quite clearly.
- You actually did see her?
- Yes.
Would you be willing to make a statement?
- Yes.
- See, dummy? I was right!
Now let's find that Nazi creep and tell him his train's gotta be searched!
War der Zug pünktlich?
And I told them that we saw that lady who stumbled into our carriage.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Oh, darling, look.
If there's a scandal, there's a scandal.
We'll weather it together.
And then, after the divorces...
Divorce?!
You've missed the point.
If there is a scandal, the Major will divorce you,
I've no doubt about that.
But Iris will never divorce me.
She wouldn't want it.
I wouldn't want it.
When two considerable fortunes are intertwined, marriage becomes a very sacred thing.
Very, very sacred.
No, you stick to the Major.
He's a poor thing but he's all you've got.
And frankly without him, life could be very difficult for you.
- Niemand verschwindet...
- Why doesn't he talk in English?
He's saying it's impossible for a lady to vanish from a moving train.
I don't care. I want this train searched.
- Hello.
- Ich hab Sie überall gesucht.
- What is she saying?
- They've been looking all over for you, that your friend has come back.
Come back? Miss Froy's come back?
Why would she lie about that?
Gesundheit.
Danke schön.
- See? Miss Froy didn't vanish.
- Maybe she tried to escape.
- From what?
- From you.
- Why me?
- The madcap heiress can be a pain!
There she is!
Think she'd mind if I ask her for her autograph?
This isn't Miss Froy.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I know this sounds idiotic but are you Miss Froy?
Miss Froy? Nein. I'm Frau Kummer.
I've never seen this woman before in my life.
I assisted you when you were unwell then when you slept
I went to another car.
When Mrs Kelly awakened, she kept asking for some English lady.
I did not connect her with my friend Frau Kummer.
These are green tweeds, are they not?
Yes.
And that is a hat with a feather and a pin that's like a horseshoe?
Everything's the same. But it isn't her.
The poor child is surely distrait.
Perhaps your doctor friend could give her a sedative?
I am not distrait and I do not need a sedative.
I can work this out.
There's an Englishwoman who claims to have seen you earlier.
As a great favour, madame, could you come with us just for a minute?
I will come.
Hello. Please forgive me for bothering you but I'd like to ask...
Hello! I'm sorry but could you tell us, please, is this the woman you saw, who fell into the compartment?
She's not even a little bit like her, is she?
Yes, this is the woman.
Are you absolutely sure?
Yes. Perfectly.
She isn't. She isn't!
Will that be all?
Yes. Thank you very much and please forgive us for troubling you.
Er, may I?
She's lying. They're all lying.
But why?
Why? Why?
You know, I've been hit over the head myself.
In Spain, I got too close to a grenade and when I woke up,
Ernest Hemingway and I were in a poker game with Karl Marx and Jean Harlow.
Stop treating me like a child! If you really wanted to help you'd buy me a drink.
- Don't you think...
- No. And I don't need another nanny.
Really? Then why did you dream one up?
- I didn't!
- That's what you did.
Suddenly your friends aren't there.
You're in a country where you don't speak the language.
You're a little lonely, a little scared.
So you go to sleep in the compartment and you dream of a nice British nanny who's going to take care of you.
Now I'd like... a nice double whisky with another double whisky as a chaser.
- Waiter!
- Coming, sir.
- Four double whiskies, please.
- The same for me, please.
Very good, madam.
What did you mean, scared?
- Scared?
- Before, you said I was scared.
Well, I just thought under all that madcap heiress stuff.
Maybe you're right. Maybe I am.
Not scared exactly.
But a little nervous. I'm 30 soon.
I'll have to get married and settle down.
You're getting married on Friday.
I am but that's just Rupert.
You know Rupert.
- I don't.
- You're not missing a thing.
- Why marry him?
- I always marry for money.
Are you telling me that you married all those assorted people just for money?
- Mm-hm.
- How could you?
Where there's a will, there's a way.
In this case, the will was my grandfather's.
When I got kicked out of Brearley for smoking and writing obscenities on the blackboard...
I didn't know any obscenities to write then.
All I could think of was,
"Miss Farnham was a big cheese."
"Miss Farnham IS a big cheese."
To Miss Farnham.
Grandfather started to get nervous.
To encourage me to settle down he changed his will so I that I'd get a million dollars when I got married.
Mummy and Daddy were divorced and they had me on this miniscule allowance.
So when I met Madvani one night I said,
"Let's get married and split the million".
This is the worst, most heartbreaking story I have ever heard in my life.
Actually, it turned out very nicely.
Better for me then Madvani. He had to split his half with his boyfriend.
- With his boyfriend?
- Mm. The marriage was annulled.
But the great thing was, you see,
Grandfather never said
I could only get married once.
Cool million every time.
So you never actually had any...
(Clears throat) ..relations with Madvani?
Relations? He wouldn't let me pick the fabric for the maid's room!
- What about von Hoffstetter?
- I was wiser by then.
In many ways quite mature.
Hoffy only got 100,000.
- You mean you never...
- Have you ever seen von Hoffstetter?
No. What about Kelly?
He was Daddy's chauffeur.
He was a little different.
In what way was he different?
I don't know.
I said to myself, "Suds, it's ridiculous
"to have been married three times and still be a..."
So you gave yourself to him.
Body and soul. I loved every minute of it.
All three of 'em.
But he already had a wife in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.
- Really?
- He's just lucky he didn't go to jail.
Apparently they make a fuss about bigamy, especially in places like
Perth Amboy, New Jersey.
In the end he was really very sweet.
Wouldn't take a cent.
Lovely. And Rupert on Friday.
How much is his payoff?
Well, Rupert held out for fifty-fifty.
But he's English and poor and I keep the title even after the divorce, so I said, "What the hell, it's only money."
What the hell, it's only money.
My God, look. There it is.
What?
There, on the window.
- I don't see anything.
- There! Miss Froy!
Froy, on the window. Miss Froy!
It's gone.
- But you must have seen it!
- Seen what?
She wrote her name on the window after giving the waiter her tea.
You think I'd dream something like that?!
I knew it was a bad idea to order alcohol on top of your concussion. Just...
I won't "just".
Miss Froy is still on this train.
Don't just sit there like a dummy.
Do something!
Well, if you won't, I will.
I'm gonna stop this train.
Everybody! There's a woman missing on this train! Miss Froy.
God knows what they're doing to her.
Help me find her, please!
It's neurosis. It's nothing to be ashamed of, everybody's neurotic.
Luckily for us, Sigmund Freund just moved to London.
Shut up!
- Aussteigen!
- So's your old man!
- Next stop, out, out, out!
- OK, OK!
I think they're gonna kick you off at the next stop.
Mr Condon, we shall arrive in Mullenbach in half an hour.
I shall be getting off there with my patient.
If you could persuade Mrs Kelly, she could spend the night in a private ward.
Forget it, Doc. Nobody's gonna persuade me to do anything.
Now, I wish you'd all leave me alone.
Come back to my compartment.
Will you please just...get lost!
Ich hab gesagt, Sie müssen aussteigen!
- Geht in Ordnung.
- It is good.
Jawohl, Herr Doktor.
Go get some strudel.
The poor child is exhausted.
Why do you not let her rest?
I will make certain she is all right.
What do you think, Doctor?
- I think I will say goodbye now.
- Goodbye?
Goodbye, Mr Condon, and good luck.
I'm booked to London so I'll make sure she gets to her bridegroom in one piece.
- Very well.
- And thank you.
Don't mention it.
- Bye, Mrs Kelly.
- Goodbye.
- Are you sure you don't mind?
- I am sure.
Watch out for yourself, buster.
Watch out.
- OK, Baroness. Now we can talk.
- Talk?
You're obviously a very intelligent person, right?
And you know we both saw
Miss Froy, right?
Which means you have some very intelligent reason for saying you didn't see her.
I don't understand why you're being so mysterious.
OK.
You won't talk.
Ten minutes late thanks to that fool of a girl.
You couldn't put it to her in some way?
- What?
- People don't just vanish and so forth.
- She has.
- What?
- Vanished.
- Who?
That nanny person.
Yes.
- Well?
- I mean, how could she?
- What?
- Vanish.
- I don't know.
- Exactly. People don't just disappear.
- Nonsense. Done every day in India.
- What?
- Rope trick.
- Oh, that.
(Baroness) Hans, mach das Fenster auf.
Jawohl, Baroness.
It was some time before I could endure one again.
I've ordered a nice cutlet of salmon and a small leg of lamb.
Peas if possible.
(Rose) ..what the weather's been like.
At least the leaves won't have fallen.
I hate the leaves.
Still, when they're burning the smell is beautiful.
Thank God, thank God! I know you think
I'm crazy but they're trying to kill me!
- Maybe I am crazy...
- You're not crazy at all!
- ..living beyond my emotional means.
- "Beyond my emotional means"? Good.
I was in my compartment when the darnedest thing happened.
- What?
- Some rubbish hit the window and plastered on the glass before my eyes was a label - a tea label.
Harriman's Herbal.
- Harriman's Herbal!
- A gaudy design in four or five colours.
A strange thought crossed my mind.
An actual thought? Do tell!
"My God," I thought,
"maybe that crazy girl
"with the wild body and no brassiere is right!"
If there is a Miss Froy we'd better find her!
That was quite a thought.
It would have been nice if you'd thought it a couple of hours ago. Let's go!
Miss Froy!
Miss Froy?
- Miss Froy!
- (Shuffling)
Miss Froy... Miss Froy?
Nice, nice. You go back to sleep now, that's a nice cow.
Well, I guess that's about that.
We've looked everywhere.
Look!
They're Miss Froy's and they're broken.
Must have been a struggle.
That poor woman.
The eyeglasses. They are probably of the Baroness. I will take them, bitte.
Bitte, bitte, schmitter.
- That's German, isn't it?
- You got the wrong number.
Let go. You just let...
Bop him!
I hit him with my best shot and he doesn't even blink.
In the movies a shot like that...
Drop him! Give him a Dutch rub!
You get your fist and you rub it on his head as hard as you can!
I learnt it at boarding school.
The Indian burn! The Indian burn!
You take a person's wrist like this and you twist as hard as you can and... it's supposed to paralyse them.
You're better at this. You fight him and
I'll jump up and down and give advice.
That was really very well done!
Thank you very much.
But where would you have been without the Dutch rub and the Indian burn?
That's true.
- You know something?
- What?
You have very nice legs.
I beg your pardon?
I was just remarking.
You have very nice legs.
In what sense?
In the sense of them being well formed, shapely.
- Shapely?
- I hadn't noticed because of the dress.
So there really is a Miss Froy, eh?
That nice man out there did try to kill you.
So it would seem. So it would seem.
Those nice people in the compartment did try to shove me out the window.
But why are they doing it?
What do they want?
How would I know what they want?
Love, money, power, immortality?
- Would you please be serious?
- Serious?
Look at my hands. They're shaking.
I'm literally trembling with fright.
OK. Time to start choosing up sides.
If there is a conspiracy, we'd better figure out who's in on it.
As far as I know the whole train's in on it, except you and Dr Hartz.
Dr Hartz. Right...
Come on.
Let's start collecting our forces.
Dr Hartz is lucky
I didn't go to his hospital.
I wouldn't have paid him and if he'd sent the bill to Kelly, tough. He hasn't a dime.
Well, he's not there.
I wonder if we should...
Wait a minute. I got a wild idea.
What if that patient in there is Miss Froy?
The patient didn't come on the train until after she disappeared, dummy.
No, wait, I refuse to be demoted back to dummy.
- Did you notice anything about the nun?
- No.
I don't think she's a real nun at all.
They're not supposed to wear high heels, are they?
High heels?
High heels. You're right.
- Actually, she's got great legs.
- Legs again. You have a fetish.
Try to think carefully. Did you actually see Mrs Kummer get on the train?
- No.
- OK. Suppose, just suppose, they decoyed Miss Froy to the baggage car and at the first stop the patient came on the train and the patient is Mrs Kummer.
Then Mrs Kummer becomes Miss Froy and Miss Froy becomes that thing in there.
Why would they wanna kidnap a sweet, harmless English nanny?
Maybe she's not.
This is Nazi Germany, war's gonna break out in about 20 minutes.
Maybe she's a sweet, harmless,
English spy.
A spy?
How exciting.
Excuse me. Do you speak English?
May we take a look at your patient?
We think that she is an Englishwoman.
Schwester, Sister, sit down, relax.
Just relax. Just...
- Listen, Doc...
- Oh, hello.
We now have absolute proof that Miss Froy's on this train.
Miss Froy?
Oh, the vanishing English lady.
Doctor, you won't believe this but nutstuff here is right.
And Albert Einstein here thinks that your patient is our Miss Froy.
My children, what are you trying to do to me? You can't be serious.
Well, I-I don't know.
It seemed a possibility.
Doc, how about it?
Let us have one little peek.
If it's not Miss Froy, we'll get out of your hair.
- You want me to remove the bandages?
- No, just enough so we can have a peek.
- Just so we can see the face.
- But there is no face. Please.
That's why I'm getting off at Mullenbach.
I must operate as soon as possible.
I want the blood pressure again, please.
- Have you looked under there?
- Of course not.
The bandages can only be removed in a hospital.
- One little tiny...
- Please.
If there is a mystery of some kind,
I want to get to the bottom of it too.
There is an empty compartment next door. I'll join you in a moment.
- All right. But please hurry.
- Of course.
- Right next door?
- Just here.
Do you think you could refrain from smoking until we are off this train?
- I'm sorry, I'm very nervous.
- I'm nervous too.
There's no point in our both being nervous.
It's a foolish duplication of effort.
I think the time has come... to use this.
Order some drinks.
I hope for both our sakes that you and Catherine know what you're doing.
Yes, try to relax.
In fifteen minutes it will all be over.
(Amanda) Have you got a cigarette?
(Robert) You wanna smoke my pipe?
Now, tell me, really.
What is this?
A practical joke of some kind?
- You are both very young, attractive...
- Can we talk about the nun?
The one looking after your patient.
What do you know about her?
Know about her? Well, nothing.
I was told she's from a convent close to where the accident occurred.
Don't you think it's funny that she's wearing sexy shoes?
- She is?
- (Both) She is.
I must be getting old, I didn't notice.
(Amanda) She can't be a real nun.
It's a conspiracy, that's all it can be.
All these people say they haven't seen Miss Froy.
We found her glasses in the baggage car. They were broken.
I can't... This is all too fantastic.
- Would you care for a drink? I need one.
- But, Doc...
Please, remain seated.
I've got a bottle next door.
I won't be long.
Dr Hartz is the one who's an alcoholic.
For you.
I think the nun's his girlfriend and they're trying to run off together.
- Yes, she's probably a German heiress...
- Shh!
In spite of what you've been telling me...
Cheers!
I stole a look at the nun's shoes.
They seemed perfectly all right to me.
Though I must say, you've both added a certain excitement to what would have been a depressing journey.
In the beginning I assumed it was Mrs Kelly's imagination but now even you seem to believe in a conspiracy?
Doctor, against the word of one demonstrably crazy American girl, we have a waiter who denies serving the tea. Waiters can be bribed.
- And the Baroness.
- A Nazi if I ever saw one.
She tried to push me out the window.
- The guy working for her tried to kill me.
- You do believe us, don't you?
I'm very sorry to say so...but yes.
Yes, I do believe you.
The patient is Miss Froy.
(Amanda) How do you know?
What's going on?
In a rightly ordered world, things like this would not be necessary but the world is not a rightly ordered place.
(Robert) What are you talking about?
Miss Froy will leave this train at
Mullenbach and, er...quietly disappear.
No, she won't. I'll make such an almighty stink you'll never hear the end of it.
With respect, Mrs Kelly, nobody believes you now.
Nobody will believe you later.
- I believe her.
- Did you actually see Miss Froy?
How can somebody who seemed so nice... suddenly be so awful?
I'm doing now what I must do but with great regret, believe me.
I suggest you sit down.
Sit down!
The drinks you just had should be taking effect in a moment.
- What?
- They contained hydracine.
That's a new drug which has the effect, in small quantities, of paralysing the brain and rendering the victim unconscious for a considerable time.
Don't move.
The trainmaster has been told that you're trying to interfere with my patient and that under no circumstances are you to leave this compartment.
He would kill you without the slightest hesitation.
I must say goodbye.
If we should meet again, I hope it'll be under happier circumstances.
We're gonna die!
- No! We've simply been drugged.
- We're gonna die!
There's a lady next door about to be murdered. We must do something.
- I'm sorry!
- Keep moving.
- Do exercises, touch your toes.
- You're not a swine or a dummy.
You're not even... Don't leave me!
I don't wanna die!
Listen! You are not going to die, we've just been drugged. Take a nap.
I'm not cut out for this hero stuff.
Whoo!
Danke schön. Danke. Oh...
Danke. Wunderbar!
Oh...das war knapp.
Danke schön.
Thank you very much. You don't have -
I forget the word - aspirin?
I have this headache. My hands are trembling with sheer terror, look.
I'm going to suffer a major cardiac arrest.
Oh, yes, I've been drugged!
- I'm beyond aspirin.
- I put nothing in your drink.
You speak English?
Of course you do, I just heard you.
Unless you memorised
"You have not been drugged".
You... You're standing here quite literally gibbering!
Right, I fought this huge person, climbed outside the train and hung in the tunnel, I've every right to gibber!
There's no time if this woman is to be saved.
Miss Froy! Are you all right?
Where's Dr Hartz?
Back there, I suppose, with his aunt the Baroness.
- The Baroness is his aunt?
- Yes, and I'm his wife.
I'm sure there's a very simple explanation for all of this.
- You're a bunch of Nazis!
- Of course not!
Egon's family are frightened. If it is discovered that there is an anti-Nazi...
- Concentration camps for one and all.
- No!
Yes. I don't know.
Would you please let me do this?
Miss Froy! Miss Froy, are you all right?
Yes, I'm quite all right.
Oh, but it is nice to see a friendly face.
- Get up. Get up!
- That woman is wearing my clothes.
There's one mean-lookin' Nazi out there but I could take him.
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking my pulse.
Use this.
Kommen Sie schnell her, ich muss mit Ihnen sprechen.
Was wünschen Sie?
I keep hitting people over the head and they don't even blink.
Ahh. That'll keep him.
Good thinking.
OK, let's get out of here right away.
I never really believed we would make it.
I'm not going with you.
- What are you talking about?
- I agreed to help because I loved you.
I still do. But Egon, why are we doing this?
You know perfectly well why.
All this talk about the General betraying the family honour.
You're terrified the Nazis will confiscate your land, your money.
You'd even support Hitler to protect these things but I can't!
- You're being ridiculous.
- Come with me! We can be together.
I married a wonderful, courageous doctor, not a murderer.
Please, Egon!
Egon, I think it's time...
What is it?
Bahnhof Mullenbach.
Kurzer Aufenthalt.
Der Schnellzug nach Basel fährt in Kürze von Gleis 2 ab.
Bahnhof Mullenbach.
Egon!
Careful.
Bitte. Vorsichtig, ja.
They've got the stretcher off the train.
There's the Baroness... the sweet Doctor... the nun...
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!
It looks like we're gonna get away with it.
What's the matter? What is it?
(Countess) We must go at once.
We must move!
Open the bandages.
Open the bandages.
Why don't they start the train?
Germans can't leave the station until somebody gets somebody to sign something that doesn't mean anything.
Where is she?! Where is she? You fool!
Blunderer!
Sie, ich muss unbedingt den Vorsteher sprechen.
Bitte folgen Sie mir.
- Eintritt verboten.
- Heil Hitler.
What is going on?
- Berger, kuppeln Sie die Wagen ab.
- Jawohl.
Helfen Sie ihm.
Man muss die Wagen unauffällig auf ein totes Gleis schieben.
Reden Sie nicht, tun Sie was!
- Stellwerk? Wagen auf Stumpfgleis 3.
- Stumpfgleis 3.
Es bewegt sich.
Hier spricht ein Offizier der SS.
'Tun Sie, was Ihnen befohlen ist.'
- Aber das ist gefährlich.
- 'Sofort.'
Jawohl. Zu Befehl.
Scheiße.
Was ist los?
The ambulance has started.
(Robert) There it goes!
- Miss Froy?
- Miss Froy! Are you all right?
- Are you all right?
- (Laughing) Yes! Oh, do forgive me.
This reminds me of a party we had at
Staffordshire House in Gloucestershire.
We were playing a game of sardines.
The butler and I were hiding in
Lady Beddington's wardrobe and we found this bottle of Haig and Haig amongst the shoes.
- Miss Froy, we made it!
- Yes.
- We made it!
- Yes! Well, you know what they say.
"Patience and fortitude
"got the snail to Jerusalem."
- Who's the gun?
- Mrs Kelly!
- I have a confession to make.
- You do?
In spite of your ridiculous hair,
I find you strangely attractive.
Don't just sit there, dummy.
# Gimme a little kiss
# Will you, huh?
# And I'll give it right back to you #
Excuse me.
Just going to go and powder my nose.
Be right back.
Excuse me.
Excuse me but the most extraordinary thing seems to have happened.
- We've lost the rest of the train.
- I beg your pardon?
I don't quite know how to describe it.
Well, the rest of the train, it's just not there.
Oh, my God. They have uncoupled us from the rest of the train.
Miss Froy, it's time you told us who you are and why they're after you.
Condon thinks you're a spy. If you are, you can trust us. We won't tell a soul.
A spy? Oh, don't be so silly.
I'm on my way home to Brighton.
Hove, actually, it's down the coast a bit.
Are we still in Germany?
I guess so.
Do you think there's anybody else left on the train?
Well, there's this car... and the dining car - but there wouldn't be anybody on there now.
It's tea time, I think you'll find that all the English people are there.
- There, you see.
- Hm?
She's turned up after all.
- The luck must have stuck.
- Storm in a teacup.
Listen to me, ladies and gentlemen, please listen.
An attempt has been made to abduct this woman by force.
- What's he nattering on about?
- They've uncoupled us from the rest of the train.
- Uncoupled?
- They don't abduct people and they don't uncouple trains. You've made this entire journey unbearable.
- Hear! Hear!
- What is this nonsense?
- Don't be such a drip! Go take a look!
- Drip?
If this is a practical joke,
I warn you, I shan't think it very funny.
Good Lord, he's right, Charters.
Uncoupled us?
What will have they done with the bags?
- (Mrs Todhunter) Someone's coming.
- Good heavens, it's Helmut.
But he appears to be a Nazi.
(Miss Froy) He is.
Well, they can't do anything to us.
We're British.
How do you know him?
He's the eldest son of the family I worked for.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I would like to apologise for this delay.
I can only assure you that it is a matter of extreme seriousness and that the security of my country is involved.
- Speak up!
- You have, on the train, a woman travelling with a British passport, under the name of Froy.
She is urgently wanted for questioning...
If Fräulein Froy will come with me now, the train will be rerouted and you will be across the Swiss border in a matter of minutes.
Miss Froy, what is going on?
Oh, there must be some mistake.
Helmut's just being silly.
He had tea with us in the nursery all the time.
Miss Froy, you should leave the train without further delay.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are on German territory.
I am making a perfectly legal request.
Turn over the woman to me now or, much as I regret it, we will board the train and take her by force.
I think you ought to go with him.
There's obviously a misunderstanding.
Once they've sorted it out they'll put you on the next train with their apologies, probably their blessing.
He might look like a music-hall usher but that's an SS uniform he's wearing.
Miss Froy is staying right here.
Evelyn, how did we get involved in something like this?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry.
I'm overly excited. I haven't had one of these in my hand before.
- I thought you were a big deal in Spain!
- I am a photographer.
I take pictures of other people shooting guns.
(Helmut) You have exactly one minute.
If you do not, I cannot be responsible for what will happen.
Anyone who wishes to leave the train should do so now.
(Todhunter) Well...
Im Wald verstecken.
(Todhunter) It's simple, they just want to talk to you.
It would seem sensible to cooperate with the authorities.
I absolutely agree.
We are guests in this country.
(Rose) And such very odd people.
I got a great idea.
Why don't we give Miss Froy to the Nazis?
It'll save us all a lot of trouble.
Mrs Kelly is getting married, the ladies have ordered dinner at 7:30, you guys'll get to your game on time and
I'll have a picture story for Life magazine.
Probably get a great bonus.
(Charters) I had a nanny once, called Smithers.
Used to hang a card around my neck, saying, "Jeremy kicks".
Splendid woman, you know. Splendid.
I'd better go and give this chap our answer.
Senior member and all that, you know.
Now, look here.
We have no intention at all of handing over
Miss Whatever-Her-Name-Is, so just be a good chap and clear off.
(Man) Halt, halt, halt!
- Halt!
- Raus!
Weiter!
- Would you mind, old man?
- Not at all, old man.
- Looks like they mean business.
- (Gunshot)
That really is the last straw. We'll never get to the match on time now.
Angreifen!
- Got any more ammunition?
- Just what's in the gun and these.
- (Gunshots)
- Right, pile the...
Pile those chairs into a barricade.
Take refuge behind them.
You're behaving like a pack of fools!
What chance do you think we've got against a lot of armed men?
Pacifist, eh? Doesn't work, old boy.
The early Christians tried that, got thrown to the lions.
- I'd rather...
- (Gunshot)
- Give it to me!
- Stop it!
- What's the trouble?
- He's got a gun!
I will not be a party to this sort of thing.
I don't believe in violence!
You'd better give that to me.
I once won a box of cigars for shooting.
I was a damn fine shot.
Excuse me, Mr Condon? Would you mind if I talked to you for a minute?
Could it possibly wait a minute?
There are people shooting bullets at us.
No, I'm afraid it can't. It really can't.
I'll hold the fort.
- I must tell you, I really have to go now.
- Go where?!
To Switzerland, it's right over there.
Thank you for trying to help.
I have a message for a Mr Callender in Whitehall.
- She is a spy!
- I'm not!
I'm acting on the instructions of General von Reider, Helmut's grandfather.
The General says it's vital that this message gets through.
So in case something silly happens, would you deliver it for me?
- What's the message?
- I have no idea.
All I know is I have to go Mr Callender in Whitehall and sing this song.
# La-la-la-la, la la la, la-la-la-la, la laah, la-la-la-la...
She's gone off her rocker.
(Miss Froy) # ..la la, la-la
- # La-la-la-la, la la la...
- (All) # La-la-la-la...
- (Singing continues)
- Not a good time for a choir practice.
- (High pitched) # La!
- # La... La!
- # La-la-la-la-la
- # La-la... La-la-la
- # La-la-la-la
- # La-la-la-la... La-la-la-la #
See? I got it.
If we get through this we'll go into vaudeville together.
Thanks. I won't forget that.
- (Amanda) You can't go out there!
- C'est la guerre!
- Do you think she's all right?
- I hope so.
She's a British nanny.
They're indestructible.
We have to start the train, get back to the main line and ram it across the frontier.
That's a tall order. The drivers aren't going to do as we tell them.
- We'll use this. Who's coming?
- Me!
No, baby, stay here.
Be a good girl and roll some bandages.
With a little luck we'll get the train back to the station, you're gonna have to jump out, switch the points in the direction of Switzerland.
- Righty-ho.
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm gonna put a stop to all this!
- (Gunfire and screaming)
Nicht schießen!
Please! Could we just be sensible...
Reach for the skies, we're taking over!
They must have hopped it with the rest of them. Can't say I blame them.
- Have you ever driven one of these?
- Not since I was a kid.
Good Lord.
- We've done it!
- (Shrieking)
They've started the train!
We're going home!
Have you any idea how to stop this contraption?
I imagine it's a matter of doing a reverse of what I did to start it.
I expect you're right.
(Caldicott) The points are just ahead.
Where the blazes is Charters?
- Time I did my bit of point-changing.
- You're wounded!
Was ist jetzt los? Er kommt zurück.
Good grief! It's that girl!
(Caldicott) Hold it!
- Not yet!
- Wait till we pass!
(Caldicott) Hold onto it!
- That's right. Good girl. Hang on.
- Hold it! Just hold it!
Pull!
Towards you!
Pull it towards you!
Come on, kiddo! Come on!
Come on, I'll pick you up!
Come on, baby, you can make it!
Come on, faster!
Faster! Come on! Come on!
Well done, old thing! Well done!
(Porter) Where's that to, sir?
(Caldicott) The Oval.
- With any luck we should be in time.
- Yes.
(Paper seller) Hitler's message.
Read all about it.
News, Star and Standard.
- (Sighs)
- News, Star and Standard.
Next year, old man.
There's always next year.
- If there is a next year.
- Quite.
Well, I'll say goodbye then.
Goodbye. I'm sorry about your hanky.
I'll have it laundered and sent round.
I've got another one.
Taxi!
(Rose) Shouldn't we talk to the stationmaster about the luggage?
Never mind about the luggage,
I shall never leave England again!
(Both) # La-la-la-la, la laah, la-la-la-la... #
(Amanda) It's Rupert!
- Oh!
- You mean you're not gonna marry him?
- What about the million bucks?
- It's a real problem.
I simply have to marry somebody.
Amanda, I'm willing to marry you but taking the million dollars, it's against all my principles.
If you wanna marry me you'll have to take it!
- Where to, guv?
- Whitehall.
Look, if I take your million dollars you're gonna my boss forever.
A man shouldn't take money from his wife.
They should share what they earn.
I don't believe in dowries or...
- Who are we supposed to see?
- Callender.
- Mr Callender, please.
- Would you wait?
- It's very urgent.
- Maybe you can break Grandfather's will but Mummy and Daddy have tried and they can't.
- You're gonna have to like it or lump it.
- OK! I lump it!
- You lump it?
- I lump it!
- Then let go of me.
- I can't. You're holding onto my elbows.
Oh, my God! My mind went blank.
I forgot Miss Froy's tune!
- The tune!
- # La-la-la-la
# La la la la la la laa... #
No, no, no!
# Da da-da-ta-da da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da da da #
- # Da-da-da da-da-da... #
- (Piano playing melody)
(Miss Froy) # La-la-la-la la la la
# La-la-la-la la laah
# La-la-la-la la...
(Both) # La la-la la la la la la la #
How lovely!
- The tune went right out of my mind.
- I never thought we'd see you again!

This is the story behind the most incredible series of murders to ever occur in the city of Seattle, Washington.
You never read about them in your local newspapers or heard about them on your local radio or television station.
Why? Because the facts were watered down, torn apart, and reassembled-- in a word, falsified.
Saturday, April 1st, approximately 2:35 A. M.
Merrisa, one of the three belly dancers at Omar's Tent, a well-known bar in the Pioneer Square area.
She was through for the night and on her way to St. James Street, where she could catch the 3 A. M. bus that would take her to her small apartment in the Shoreline Park area.
Anxious to get home, she planned to take a shower and go right to bed.
She never made it.
Is someone there?
PIease, can't you take me?
I only wanna go to Shoreline Park,
There's someone back there, please!
A few nights later in the barroom of the Seattle Press Club, one Tony Vincenzo by name,
City Editor by profession, bilious grouch by disposition, renewed acquaintance with a dear old comrade of the fourth estate.
- Hi, Charlie,
- Mr, Vincenzo, how are you?
- Okay,
- Good,
The usual, Mr, Vincenzo?
- Yeah, yeah,
- Okay,
Where you been Iiving, in a cave?
There's a world of facts outside,
Stumble out and take a peek at 'em,
- Get your brains out of hibernation,
- Oh, no,
You can't expect me to believe this,
This doesn't make any sense at all!
What's the difference, if it's true?
You're a newsman, not a critic,
- Well, I am!
- Take a Iook at this, then,
Take a Iook around that corner,
See if there isn't someone there who Iooks Iike he just came from a performance ofThe Front Page.
Don't Iecture me about press responsibility, cabbage head,
I knew more about the press the day I was born than you do now,
- Oh, yeah,
- Oh, yeah,
Can you read English, or do
I have to tell you what it says?
See, right there--
V-A-M-P-I-R-E, vampire,
That's what it says right there,
Can you read the official coroner's report?
"BIood drained from a victim's b--"
- Yeah,
- Real odd,
There's nothing wrong with me,
- Yeah,
- Real odd,
Vincenzo!
Hello, Carl,
- What are you doing in Seattle?
- What did I do in Las Vegas?
You fired me, that's what you did,
No, no,
I didn't fire you,
In that case, you can hire me,
Right, Vincenzo?
Get this straight, Mr, Kolchak-- no carnival or hoopla tactics on this paper,
This isn't Fun Town, USA,
This is Seattle,
We have standards here,
We mind our P's and Q's,
We hew precisely to the mark,
Yes, sir, Mr, Crossbinder,
You can count on me minding your P's and Q's, yes, sir,
That's what happened to Cotton Mather, huh?
Don't underestimate him,
He may be old, but his fangs are potent,
So, what's my first assignment?
What's the matter?
Okay, murder one, three days ago,
A belly dancer named Merrisa,
She was strangled in an alley,
Tuesday, April 4th.
First stop, police headquarters to introduce myself and see if any later information had come in about the Ethel Parker killing.
There was nothing new.
No useful leads given by the victim's friends, acquaintances, or family.
Standard medical examiner's report.
So far, the murder was a one-way street to nowhere.
Make an appointment with my secretary,
I said make an appointment,
- I don't make appointments,
- You're gonna have to,
- Captain, I'd Iike to make a--
- Morrison,
Captain, I--wait a minute!
What's the matter?
I just wanna talk to the captain,
Second stop,
Omar's Tent, no leads.
Ethel Parker never mixed with customers, had no known enemies, kept her problems to herself, unmarried, all her relatives in Massachusetts, she'd left the mainstream of life without making a ripple.
Third stop, the apartment of Charisma Beauty, given name, Gladys Wheems, one of the two other belly dancers at Omar's Tent.
- Charisma Beauty?
- Who are you?
Who's there, Wilma?
Miss Beauty?
Yes, I am,
Excuse me,
I beg your pardon,
My name is Kolchak,
I'm with theDaily Chronicle.
I'd Iike to ask you a few questions,
- Would you Iike a chocolate?
- No, thank you very much,
What I'd Iike to ask you is...
She was something less than helpful, and I soon departed, made a bit uneasy by the looks directed at me by her husband,
Wilma Krankheimer.
Fourth stop, the floating premises of Louise Harper,
Iast of the belly-dancing trio at the supper club.
Scherazade?
- Louise Harper?
- Oh, hi,
I can't talk to you now,
I'm Iate for class,
If you wanna sell me something, come back Iater,
I really don't have any money for extras, so you'd just be wasting your time,
- Yeah, but I--
- Listen, I'd Iike to talk, but I am so Iate for class,
Professor Brown will kill me,
My grades are not too good as it is,
How I'm gonna graduate,
I will never know,
There simply is not enough time to do all the things I've gotta do,
May I introduce myself?
My name is Kolchak of theDaily Chronicle.
When could I ask you some questions about Ethel Parker?
You'II have to come by the club, that's the only time
I have to talk to you,
I am so Iate, I know he's gonna flunk me,
Thanks for the information,
Don't mention it!
You know there's been a murder, don't you?
I also know that Seattle is the Northwest's Iargest sea port,
Men come and go Iike the tide, and the murderer is probably in Yokohama by now,
Bye!
She was wrong-- he was still in Seattle, working up his list of victims.
Cocktail waitress Gail Manning, disposed of some time after 2 A. M. on the morning of Thursday, April 6th, a block and a half from the first murder.
Right there on top, boys,
Captain, what do you intend to do about this?
- Who are you, anyway?
- My name?
Kolchak, with theDaily Chronicle.
I'd Iike to ask a couple questions on this,
- Get this guy off my back,
- Will you wait a minute?
Captain, I got a Iot of problems to take care of,
"Strangulation, neat and quick, no new elements, " was all they told us, until the Medical Examiner's report the next afternoon.
In attendance,
Captain Roscoe Shubert of the Seattle Police, and his staff.
Holding forth, Dr. Christopher Webb of the County Medical Examiner's Office.
Checking underneath the victim's hairline, we Iocated what appears to be a needle puncture near the base of the skull... from which a small amount of blood was removed,
Was there any puncture or Ioss of blood in Ethel Parker?
We haven't checked on the puncture yet, but there was apparently a slight decrease in normal blood content,
How slight?
That's hard to say, maybe six or seven cc's,
Why wasn't it reported?
The amount of Ioss seemed insignificant at the time,
- But not now,
- You have a point--
Just a minute, Doctor,
Who is this clown?
I've never seen him before,
- What?
- Kolchak,Daily Chronicle.
- Don't you remember?
- Oh, yeah, how could I forget?
AII right, Mr, Kolchak, may we continue?
- Certainly,
- Thank you very much,
Go ahead, Doctor,
As Iong as we get all the facts this time,
Dissatisfied by what I had heard at the Medical Examiner's report,
I paid a little visit to the morgue and found a chatty attendant with a taste for Scotch.
What he told me made chopped liver of the needle puncture and loss of blood, and explained why they hadn 't let me look too closely at Gail Manning the night before.
Well, uh, no, no,
No, thank you, thank you very much,
You go right on ahead, though,
We can't Iink these two killings unless we know whether Ethel Parker has a needle puncture, too,
She has...and that's not all,
You know something the Medical Examiner doesn't?
- Mm-hmm,
- What?
First... you owe me ten bucks for a bottle of Scotch,
- What?
- Yup,
Bought for one anecdotal morgue attendant,
Okay, keep talkin',
Hurry up,
Ethel Parker not only had a needle puncture in the back of her skull, and Ioss of blood, she also had a broken neck,
That's not so unusual in the case of a strangling,
Gail Manning also had a broken neck,
So what?
Maybe I oughta tell you what the morgue attendant told me,
He said that the killer had to be an incredibly strong man,
Not only were the necks broken, they were crushed,
Read on, read on,
- Wait a minute!
- That's what the man said,
On the throats of both victims was a residue of rotted flesh, as if they had been strangled by a dead man,
Friday, April 7th, 10: 21 P.M.
I wouldn't have believed it if
I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, but Louise Harper's hips could move as fast as her mouth.
- That's the stuff, baby!
- Take it off!
Take it off, baby,
Scherazade, Iadies and gentlemen, princess of the East,
And now, the world-famous
Charisma Beauty,
Knock 'em dead, Charisma,
Why should I do that?
I Iike them,
I just can't understand this,
Whoever wrote this is just dumb,
I'm never gonna graduate if I flunk this course,
- Princess of the East?
- No, Dimwit of the West,
I just can't talk to you right now,
- I've gotta know algebra,
- Well, I'm great at figures,
I bet you are,
Go away,
You know, if I could find a way not to eat,
I sure could save a Iot of time,
Yeah, well, Iet's, uh,
Iet's pick up talking where we Ieft off,
I mean, about the guys-- thank you, Charlie-- about the guys who come to see you dance, the regulars,
Do you find any strange ones in there, any odd ones, any weirdoes?
They're all weird, they sit there and stare at you with these big glassy eyes,
Any of 'em could be the strangler for all I know,
What's that?
Oh, that's the underground tour,
- The what?
- The underground tour,
It goes down underneath Seattle,
- You're kidding?
- Mm-mmm,
Yes, There's ruins underneath the streets here, what they call "OId Seattle,"
- Isn't that right, Wilma?
- Oh, I don't know, here,
Oh, thank you,
I just Iove these sandwiches,
I was talking about the underground, wasn't I?
Yeah, you were, honey,
There was this big fire back in 18-something-or-other, and for some reason
I don't know about, they built it all back up, twice as big as it was before,
- Isn't that right, Wilma?
- Come on, GIadys, it's almost showtime,
Although research was never one of my favorite pastimes,
I called on the services of one Titus Berry, guardian of the secrets of Seattle buried in the morgue of the Daily Chronicle,
Here we go,
- Thanks,
- Most welcome,
I envy you,
You do?
Research,
That's where the joy Iies,
- Joy?
- And the fascination,
Let the others scurry about, gathering their contemporary bits of gossip,
This is where the meat is found,
- Meat?
- Yes,
For instance, no one has yet mentioned the distinct resemblance between this current series of strangulations and another series in the year 1951,
Or was it '52?
- Yeah, how similar?
- Oh, extremely similar,
Really?
He wasn't exaggerating.
On March 27th, 1952, one Myra Johns was discovered strangled in an alley in the Pioneer Square area.
On March 30th, a second strangulation took place in the same area.
On April 2nd, a third,
April 5th, a fourth.
By April 1 4th, six women had been strangled, all of them in that area.
The stories intimated that certain "bizarre details" had been repressed by police officials.
I wondered what they were.
I hardly think we can say we have the same killer now as in 1 952,
Read on,
- Again?
- Again,
"Incredibly strong and had the rotted features of a corpse"?!
Those are exact quotes from a man who saw him
- in action in 1952,
- I can't print this,
- Why not?
- If you don't know the answer to that,
Kolchak, I don't know,
I came to Seattle for some peace and quiet, what do I get?
-You again and another crazy story,
- We'II soon see if it's crazy or not,
"How?" asked the red-eyed editor,
Because if it is the same killer, he hasn't stopped killing,
Sunday, April 9th, 1:42 A.M.
Joyce Gabriel, on her way home from a late date, didn't' know it was a bad idea to be in the Pioneer Square area
Iate at night.
- Let me get a shot of her,
- Move out of the way,
Another one,
Just settle down, Miss Gabriel,
I never saw anything Iike that in my Iife,
I don't know why he didn't chase me after he killed her,
I just, you know, I ran as fast as I could until I saw you,
- Miss Gabriel--
- I'm telling you for the Iast time,
I'm sick and tired of you butting into my business,
Will you please Iet me ask the questions, Mr, Kolchak?
- Certainly,
- AII right,
- What did he Iook Iike?
- Are you deaf?
Get rid of that tape recorder, too,
Now, what did he Iook Iike?
Oh, God, I hope I never see a face Iike that again,
He Iooked Iike a dead man,
- Like a what?
- Like a dead man,
I don't wanna hear it,
What about the broken necks and rotted flesh on the victims' throats?
I told ya I didn't wanna hear it!
Besides, it's not official,
Who cares whether it's official or not?!
You know it, and I know it,
I'II buy the possibility that it's the killer that strangled the six women in 1952, but a man, not some kind of super dead man!
That's how he has been described more than once!
I don't care if he's been described that way more than twice!
Let me finish my Iunch!
Where you goin'?
There!
An open invitation to the killer,
Listen to this,
"I intend to walk the streets of the Pioneer Square area every night from now on,"
Just Iet him try to kill me, if he dares,
He may be sick, but he's not crazy,
I'm giving you this, Mr, Kolchak, because you had the thoughtfulness to put my name in your story on the 1952 strangulations,
What, uh, what is it?
A burning curiosity impelled me to Iook further back into our files to see if there had been any other strangulations of that nature,
1931? You gotta be kidding,
Here it was again--
March 29th through April 16th.
Six strangulations, certain bizarre information repressed by the authorities.
Although a reporter named
Jimmy Stacks, God bless him, nosed around until he uncovered the unofficial information that some of the victims were missing some blood, and that the killer was supposed to be some kind of superman.
Women, You notice that?
AIways women,
- Fascinating,
- Yeah, that's the word, Mr, B,
Let's see, 1973 to 1952, that's 21 years,
1952 to 1931... that's 21 years,
That's right,
I hadn't noticed that,
That's very observant of you, Mr, Kolchak,
Can you be thinking what I'm thinking?
Let's have a Iook,
- Mr, Berry,
- Mr, Kolchak,
Shall we try for 1889?
I refuse to read it,
Wait, wait, wait,
Just... just read the first Iine,
Go on, go on,
Just the first Iine,
Give yourself a treat,
Come on, come on,
"Five identical sets of murders every 21 years since 1889"?
- Identical?
- Identical!
- Oh, come on, Kolchak,
- AImost identical,
There may be more than five,
The records stop in 1887 when theChronicle was founded,
I'm going to OIympia tomorrow and check out--
- Oh, don't rush into that,
- Wait, wait, Read the-- read the 1910 eyewitness description,
I'II read it to you, here,
Oh, it's great,
"The maniac had the strength of ten men
"and the face of a corpse, cheekbones protruding through the flesh,"
- isn't that great?
- Hold it, it, just hold it,
You really expect me to print that story, with a corpse that's been running around strangling people and crushing their necks for the past 84 years?
Because the police refused to release the sketch their own artist had made,
I talked Vincenzo into hiring an artist of our own.
His jaw was heavier, I think,
That's closer, but more bone was showing through,
Like this?
Yes,
Is that what he Iooked Iike?
That's what I saw,
Monday, April 10th, 2:07 P.M.
Fourth of July came to Seattle early that year, all the fireworks exploding at the police headquarters,
90% of them directed at me and Vincenzo.
You know what I call that?
Irresponsible yellow journalism,
Fast buck journalism,
The seamy journalism one might expect to find in a second-rate metropolis,
The sordid brand of journalism which is based not on the public weal, but on the private cash register,
Psychologists call it déja vu, the distinct impression of having had the same experience before.
That's what it was, all right, in spades.
Item--we had no right to throw the public into a panic.
Translation-- tourist season was coming up and Seattle couldn't survive without it.
Item--we had no evidence to support our statement that there might be a connection between the five sets of murders since 1 889.
Translation--we knew more than we were supposed to.
Item--the authorities were going to keep a watchful eye on us, particularly me, from now on.
Translation--after a brief hiatus,
I had once more taken up permanent residence inside a pressure cooker.
Permit me to read you a brief memorandum,
Quote, "Any repetition of this morning's front page assault
"on the mind and senses will result in the instant dismissal of all responsible persons,"
Unquote,
- Signed...
- "God,"
You're almost right,
How could I Iet this happen to me again?
How could I do it?
I don't understand!
Will you just wait a minute?!
We wasted an awful Iot of time fighting tooth and nail in Las Vegas about the obvious,
"There is no such thing as a vampire,"
That's what everyone kept saying, and the women kept dying,
Let's not play that stupid game again!
- Besides, it's a great story,
- It's a fabricated story,
- full of screwball speculations!
- Fabricated speculation?!
- Have you been sitting on your brain?
- Give me the facts, or stay away from me, just the facts!
Step number one in my fact-finding project took me to the Main Library, where I spent the rest of the evening checking their microfilm collection of Seattle's newspapers.
The murder trail apparently came to an end in 1 889, but I found out something very interesting.
As near as I could make it out, every set of murders had taken place over a period of 1 8 days, which meant that our killer, whoever or whatever he was, only had a week and a day to find his last three victims.
That night, about 1 1 :45, he reduced the number to two.
Hold it, mister,
Identification, please,
Yeah, identification, sure, right here,
Hey, you, Hold it!
- Where'd he go?
- We didn't see anyone,
Better get the ambulance for those other guys,
- I'II take the camera,
- Hey, give me my camera!
Well, that's--
People, I want this area thoroughly searched,
Do a knock on it,
- Give me my camera!
- I want you out of this area,
- That's private property!
- Beat it!
- I'II Iock you up for Ioitering,
- You can't take that!
Give me that-- come on, give me that!
Shoot!
Just Molly and me
And baby makes three
We're happy in my
BIue heaven
Mr, Joe Roberts,
Iadies and gentlemen,
How about a big hand for him, huh?
AII right!
AII right,
The man responsible for the underground tour of Seattle's forgotten city beneath the modern streets of Seattle,
That mall pole was devised by the man I'm about to introduce, author, journalist,
Mr, Bill Speidel,
Thank you, young man,
Welcome to Seattle's underground tours, folks,
Before I go on, I wanna tell you about Mother Damnable...
After completely striking out in my efforts to get Shubert to return my film of last night's wipeout of the Seattle police,
I decided to try another angle.
...to make room for the underground...,
I called my belly-dancing, undergraduate friend and asked her to attend an afternoon tour of the underground with me.
Confession of a Newsman,
Chapter One, her being with me had nothing to do with the story.
Those kids from
Seattle High School spent five successive Saturdays back in the spring of 1 965, cleaning up no Iess than ten tons of debris down here so that people Iike you wouldn't break your necks walking around,
Watch your step through here,
You gentlemen can help the Iadies, huh?
Twice a day when the tides came in, the sewer system backed up and came right in with it, flooding every water closet, turning it into a fountain,
Kids in those days weren't raised on Dr, Spock, they were raised on the tide table,
Watch your step,
Let's go this way,
It was like another world down there, a world of yesterday-- sidewalks and storefronts just as they'd been left after the fire in 1 889.
Windows built to admit the light admitting only darkness now.
Ground floors of office buildings now the unused cellars of those buildings.
The tomb of old Seattle just beneath the living streets of what Seattle is today.
Vintage year,
I'm too old for this shit,
You want...?
Gotta see a doctor,
Arthritis,
Bad stomach,
Why'd you have to come to this place?
Back,
Never woulda had to put my shoes on if I hadn't heard you comin',
My corns are killing me,
Got a charley horse,
Varicose veins,
I'm gettin' a migraine,
- Are you all right?
- Yeah,
Of course I'm all right,
Listen...
Have you seen anybody else around here
- who wasn't with the tours?
- Yeah,
- Yeah, who?
- You two,
Oh, funny,
Very funny,
Well, if you do see someone, or, uh... something around here, you get in touch with me at this number and I'II give you 20 bucks,
Here's a down payment,
I could Iive three months on that, five bucks,
Uh, no, thank you,
On me,
Sure was a Iovely afternoon,
I still don't think it's a good idea for you to be working nights,
- I've seen this nut in action,
- Oh, terrific,
You gonna pick up my tuition?
That's very funny, very funny,
I just don't get it,
Where does he go between killings?
We didn't find anything in the underground,
- No,
- I don't understand it,
How can he run Iike a track star, have superhuman strength, and Iook Iike a stiff?
And what does he do with all that blood?
It's Iike some kind of recurring nightmare,
- It's all happened to me before,
- What are you talking about?
Last year in Las Vegas when
I was working for Tony Vincenzo,
I uncovered a series of murders that turned out to have been committed by a vampire,
A real vampire,
A real, out of the coffin at night, go for the jugular vampire,
You don't believe me,
Neither did the cops up there, neither did the FBI, neither did Tony Vincenzo, until finally, they had to,
As it turned out, however, they put a cap on my story, prevented me from writing about what I had seen with my own eyes by hanging a murder rap over my head,
- Murder?
- Yeah,
Yeah, I finally drove a wooden stake into the vampire's heart,
- What do you think?
- What do I think?
I think those people will remember this elevator ride for the rest of their Iives,
Two, Iet's go,
I'm beginning to wonder whether maybe it isn't them, maybe it's me,
Listen, I think I know somebody you should see,
There's this Iady who's a teacher at the university,
- She teaches Anthropology,
- Yes?
She's a buff on every crazy subject there is,
- Yeah?
- Ghosts, demons, vampires,
And ghouls, you know, just name it,
You probably won't be too crazy about her, but she's gotta be the one you talk to,
Yeah? What's her name?
- Professor Crabwell,
- What?!
How can a man over a hundred years old retain his vitality?
Is it possible?
If it were possible,
I'd be sitting here an 80-year-old sexpot,
However, staying young was not their purpose,
AIchemy was conceived as an exalted notion-- man at one with the universe,
And will you please sit down?
Yes, yes, of course,
These men Ied spartan Iives,
Iiving in the most humble of quarters, eating the most humble of foods,
The Count Saint-Germain, for instance, existed on a diet which consisted solely of oatmeal, groats, white meat of chicken, and a Iittle wine,
Seems to me that a diet Iike that would make a man old before his time,
On the contrary,
He remained young for a number of years, in addition to which he was said to have possessed almost superhuman strength,
Tell me, what other, uh... what other ingredients are in this elixir of Iife?
Milk or meat, celandine or honey, red wine vinegar, hair, sweat, blood,
What kind of blood?
What do you mean, what kind of blood?
Human blood, of course,
What are you smiling at?
Hi, there,
- Got a moment?
- What are you doing here?
- Just wanted to talk a minute,
- What about?
The elixir of Iife,
"Go to journalism school," my father said,
"It's a good, sound, down-to-earth profession,"
Don't you wanna hear this?
I'd Iike to raise tulips for a Iiving, but there's not too much of a demand,
Suppose an elixir of Iife could actually be produced, how do you think it'd work?
Do you think that one treatment of it would cause everlasting youth?
Or do you think that periodic treatments
- might be required, say--
- Wait a minute, don't tell me,
Let me guess,
Every 21 years?
Good guess,
Suppose at the end of this 21-year period, the man who took the magic elixir began Iooking a Iittle... moldy, you know, kinda Iike what he really did Iook Iike-- a 100-year-old man,
Suppose he had to make a new batch of the elixir and had to make it within a period of 18 days,
Suppose that the one ingredient he didn't have was--
- BIood,
- Very good,
Suppose he had to go out Iate every night to get that blood,
Suppose he got it from the bases of his victims' skulls with a hypodermic needle,
Suppose he was so strong that when he strangled his victims, he crushed their necks,
Suppose his fingertips were starting to decompose and he Ieft fragments of them on the women's throats,
Suppose you flap your arms and fly right out that door,
Suppose you check the dictionary and discover what "fact" means,
- fact!
- Fact!
Facts!
As I rode home that night,
I wondered where the killer was and if my theory about him was true, partly true, or, as Vincenzo would have it, factless, hopeless, and useless.
I wondered when and how he'd get his fifth victim, since the entire area was being guarded so closely now.
I didn 't have to wonder long.
Thursday, April 13th, 1:25 A.M.
The dressing room in Omar's Tent.
Charisma Beauty was plain old Gladys Wheems again, dead, strangled with a broken neck, blood syringed from the base of her skull.
Wilma Krankheimer was still in shock.
So was Louise Harper.
She has found the body after her performance.
I've got a couple of questions for you,
And I wasn 't doing so well myself.
I've gotta talk to you about something,
Wait a minute, come on!
This is very important!
Captain Shubert is very busy,
- You can't go in there,
- I gotta see him,
- You cannot go in there!
- I'm goin' in there!
- What's going on here?
- I told him you were busy,
I've been tryin' to see you since 1 :30 this morning,
- I'm not Ieaving until I do,
- It's all right,
- I'm sorry, Sir,
- It's all right,
You gotta put policewomen on the waterfront streets at night,
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do,
You got five days to catch the killer, otherwise, he's gonna disappear,
- Is he, Mr, Kolchak?
- Yeah, he is, he is!
Every 21 years since 1889, he has killed six women in 18 days precisely,
- Precisely?
- Precisely,
No doubt we Iack your eagle-eyed perception, but we fail to see the exact, precise pattern you keep babbling about,
Now, in 1889, there was no evidence that the murders were committed over an 18-day period, or that they were even related,
- You checked?
- Yes, we do a Iittle research, too,
To continue--in 1910, there was blood Ioss reported
- in only three of the victims,
- What about--?
The description of the murderer was made by a mental defective
- in his cups and--
- What about the 1952 descriptions?
Were those made by a mental defective in his cups?
- He was a bank president!
- In 1952, there were eight murders committed during an 18-day period,
What does that do to your theory?
Two of them by stabbing, which invalidates--
And after the sixth strangulation, an eyewitness described the murderer as being, quote,
"rather handsome," unquote,
Oh, you mean you missed that?
Well, I...the witness obviously made a mistake, he had to,
Did he, huh?
Tell me, if it's the same killer, why no signs of rotted flesh on the throat of Iast night's victim?
And one Iast question,
Why am I wasting my time on you?
- Facts mean nothing to you at all,
- There is one Iast fact, Captain,
By next Tuesday, that killer's gonna disappear for 21 years, and the way your police have Pioneer Square bottled up, he isn't even gonna show his face,
Which face is that, huh?
The rotted one of your so-called super killer your newspaper saw fit to print?
So-called?!
I saw that so-called super killer wipe up the streets with your so-called police force!
I had pictures to prove it that you wouldn't Iet me print!
Tell me, how Iong have you been in Seattle?
- What does that mean?
- How Iong have you been
- with theChronicle?
- A Iittle Iess than two weeks,
- A Iittle Iess than two weeks,
- About that,
In that time, you have ascertained how we should conduct this case?
- I've been a reporter for 22 years!
- I've been a police officer for 30!
Then why don't you retire?
Listen, I don't Iike you,
Mr, Kolchak,
You might say
I dislike you monumentally,
You have barged around this building as though it were your own private club,
You've interfered with police officers trying to perform their duty,
You've strewn the streets of Seattle with journalistic garbage,
You've stepped on toes, muscled in, pushed, usurped, and generally conducted yourself with all the aplomb of a one-man Gestapo,
- Gestapo?
- Yes, Gestapo!
If I see or hear from you again, for quite some time,
I promise you, I'II personally have you thrown in jail, and get your arm off my clock!
You've only got five days Ieft,
And I'm telling you to get out!
And stay out!
Cease, mister,
Cease, desist and vanish, or else,
At Ieast search the underground, the killer is down there,
- That's where he isn't!
- That--
The underground was searched,
Nothing at all was found,
Sheila!
Yes, we did that without consulting you,
I hope that's all right,
Sheila, show
Mr, Kolchak the door,
Good day, sir,
- Kolchak!
- I'II get him yet,
Coming, Mother,
I warned you about bugging the police department,
- Yeah, so what?!
- Didn't I?!
So, Shubert's office just called Crossbinder,
Crossbinder called me, and once again, thanks to you,
I'm frying on the griddle,
- Why?
- Why?!
Are you for real?! You barge into Shubert's office, tell him how to run his case, tell him he's suppressing news,
- and you ask why?!
- He is suppressing news, he doesn't know how to run the case,
The killer is down there, Tony,
He is down in the underground,
Why don't they get him out of there?!
He is hidden away someplace nobody knows,
How the heck can they get at him, then?!
By breaking open the walls,
I don't know,
Crossbinder's got some influence in town, hasn't he?
- What about it?
- You have got to talk him into pressuring the police, forcing them to do what I want them to do!
You know what you just said?
Of course,
I just said it, didn't I?
No, you don't know,
It's finally happened, Kolchak,
You've gone schizoid,
You'II be wearing robes and a crown next,
I'II tell you what's finally happened,
You have Iost your guts, you have sold out,
- Sold out?
- Sold out!
Why, you miserable, egocentric--
- You are off the story,
- I am what?!
You heard me, you are off the story,
You know something, Tony?
You're getting old, you're getting very old,
- Out, Out!
- "Out! Get out!"
Just one small item, Mr, Kolchak,
Mark Twain,
- Fifth paragraph down,
- Fifth paragraph down...
Two, three, oh, yeah,
"Mr, Twain noted with typical dryness of tone
"that he had a most intriguing conversation with...
"with a Iocal physician who claimed that physical immortality--"
Oh, this is very good,
Mr, Berry, very good,
"...that physical immortality was not only possible,
"but probable, indeed, practical,
"Mr, Twain remarked that... that the physician's name was Dr, Richard Malcolm,"
You wouldn't have anything on this Richard Malcolm,
- would you?
- Just one small item,
Dr, Richard Malcolm was a member of the original staff of the Westside Mercy Hospital when it opened in 1882,
There's the original story and photograph,
The Civil War?
He was a surgeon in the Union Army,
Is this hospital still standing?
Oh, I don't believe so,
Mr, Kolchak,
I think there's a clinic there now,
I took a fast trip to the clinic, hoping they might have the record files from Westside Mercy Hospital stashed away in their cellar.
I asked Mr. Berry to keep checking his own records and find out what else he could about Dr. Richard Malcolm.
I never had to search the cellar for those records.
I found my answer just inside the lobby door.
Sir...if you don't get down from there this instant,
- I'II call the police,
- Mm-hmm,
- Did you hear me, sir?
- Uh-huh,
AII right, then,
AII right, then! Call the police, tell them we have a vandal here,
Tell them to get here right away,
Get down from there this instant!
Malcolm Richards, M.D., the doctor-saint of the waterfront, founder of the Richards Free Clinic, also known as Richard Malcolm, M.D.,
Iate of the Union Army, our killer from the time.
This is dreadful, Mr, Kolchak!
On the contrary, Mr, Berry,
There he is, officer,
Tony?
It is to be regretted,
Mr, Kolchak, that Ieg irons and mouth blocks were outlawed some years back,
Will you wait a minute, will you take these things off?
I warned you, Kolchak,
Congratulations, Kolchak,
You have plumbed a new depth-- the desecration of a saint,
For heaven's sake, I did not invent the resemblance between
Dr, Malcolm Richards and Dr, Richard Malcolm,
I did not invent the fact that Westside Mercy Hospital, of which Dr, Richard Malcolm was a staff member, is on the same spot as the Malcolm Richards CIinic,
Why not an exposé on Dr, Schweitzer, Mr, Kolchak?
Or the Iowdown on Mahatma Gandhi?
As for this eternal youth garbage, I hate it,
Well, I can see why,
- What did you say?
- Hold on, we're not here for any personal vituperation,
- You know that word?
- What?
Vi-tu-per-ation,
That's what I said,
I pronounced it right,
Listen, you've been arrested,
You're 1/100th of an inch of being thrown in jail, and--
- There he is!
- Now, who's this?
Mr, Berry, come in, come in!
I've been waiting for you, come on!
Yes, yes,
Do you, uh--?
Did you get it?
- Yes, I thought perhaps--
- You thought right, Mr, Berry,
Who is this man?
Don't you know him?
He works for you,
Down in Research, sir,
- for 35 years,
- Good God,
And research, of course, being the meat of it,
Yes, here we are,
"Mr, Richard Malcolm
Iived in New York City until 1868, when he moved to Seattle,"
Very good,
Mr, Berry, very good,
"Several months before he Ieft--"
New York City, that is--
"six women were strangled over a period of 18 days precisely,
"Their Iarynxes were crushed and their necks were broken,
Two had small wounds on the base of their skull,"
1868, I might add, is exactly 21 years before the first group of Seattle killings, Mr, Vincenzo,
Item, "Following the fire of 1889, in which the wife,
"stepson and daughter died of smoke inhalation,
Dr, Richard Malcolm disappeared,"
1889, as we know, just happens to be the year in which the first group of six killings occurred,
Mr, Vincenzo,
Yes, "In 1910,
Dr, Malcolm Richards appeared in the by now defunct
Westside Mercy Hospital," of which, as noted, Dr, Richard Malcolm was formerly a member of the staff--
"and built his clinic over the original site,"
1910, by coincidence, just happens to be the year in which the second group of six killings occurred,
- Kolchak?
- Again, more broken necks
- and more missing blood,
- Now, Iisten, Kolchak--
Wait a minute-- wait a minute!
"In 1931, following reports that he had developed some kind of
" 'strange, degenerative skin disease,'
Dr, Malcolm Richards disappeared,"
Oh, 1931 just by coincidence happens to be the year in which the third group of similar killings occurred,
Mr, Vincenzo,
Photos, do you have any photographs?
- Ah, yeah,
- Did you get some?
Oh, marvelous, marvelous, Iet's see...
You'II, excuse the, uh... clumsiness of the hands, but my wrists are slightly encumbered by your...bracelets,
Now, this photograph of Dr, Richard Malcolm and the slightly doctored photograph of Dr, Malcolm Richards are identical, down to the white scar above the right eyebrow,
Now, this photograph was taken during the Civil War when Dr, Richard Malcolm was a surgeon with the Union Army,
The photograph of Dr, Malcolm Richards was taken in 1926,
It showed a man in his 40s,
Now, how can a man almost 90
Iook Iike a man in his 40s?
Facts, gentlemen, facts,
Well?!
Yes, well?
- You shut up!
- I mean, uh, well...
What are we supposed to do now, congratulate you?
Find him, mister!
Go down underground and search for him,
You haven't searched enough,
Put some policewomen in the area,
Iure him out of his Iair,
And, Mr, Publisher, you might consider printing the stories,
They are news, sir, not hearsay,
They are news!
That will be enough,
Mr, Kolchak,
Perhaps, Mr, Kolchak, it would be a good idea if you stepped outside for a moment,
Delighted, sir, delighted,
If I could get my jewelry removed,
AII right, Judd?
Get him outta here, take the handcuffs off him,
Thank you,
I just await your decision, gentlemen,
Yes, sir, LIewellyn--
I mean, Mr, Crossbinder,
It'II be done, you can depend on it,
Come on, Judd,
Oh, boy,
Okay, Carl,
I don't know how I did it, but I got you off the hook,
- You did?
- Yeah,
You're a genius, Tony!
You're a genius!
- What about the story?
- There is no story,
- What?
- That's it, there is no story,
They're gonna handle it their own way,
They're gonna--huh?
- I'II kill 'em!
- Kolchak!
Didn't they hear what I said?!
Don't they know what's gonna happen?!
If they don't get Malcolm out of there, he's going to get his sixth kill somewhere else, and he's gonna disappear for 21 years!
Don't they know what's gonna happen?!
They do not intend to panic an entire city just for your sake,
Kolchak, period!
- Your next assignment--
- You haven't changed,
You're the same as you were in Las Vegas,
- Your next assignment--
- You're on their side,
You're covering the
Daffodil Festival in Puyallup,
And you're Iucky to get that,
Puyallup?
It was with deep regret that I chose to forego the joys of daffodils in Puyallup, but I had other plans.
Saturday, April 1 5th, 2 A.M.
We started out-- one belly-dancing undergraduate, and one reporter who, despite his air of spit-in-their-eye confidence, hoped to heavens he wasn 't hastening said undergraduate to her doom.
It didn 't help my conscience that Louise Harper had agreed immediately to help me, angered as she was by the death of both her co-performers.
PIease stop Iooking around Iike you're suspicious of something!
- Walk natural,
- I'm scared!
- I'm right behind you,
- That's easy for you to say,
Just act casual,
The first three nights passed without incident.
Most of the time was spent trying to duck the police.
On the fourth night, things began to happen.
Denver- 1 4, Denver- 1 4, family disturbance.
278 New Northridge.
No...
I'II not Iook back,
Car 19, Car 19,
21 1 in progress,
813 Kelso Street, handle Code 3.
AII right,
Car number eight, undetermined disturbance,
8390 Olympus Walk.
See the man.
-Duncan car one, 0- 1...
- Get her in the car, fast,
Okay, the party's over,
Get in the car,
- What are you doing down here?
- You're under arrest,
- Get in the car,
- Get your hands off me,
- Don't push!
- Shut up!
All units in the vicinity of Main Branch, be on the lookout for a '36 Shearing coupe, blue, blue hood.
Who is there?
We're closed,
PIease go away, we're closed for the evening,
No! No!
April 19th, 3 A.M.
The police station was a circus of activity, a three-ring madhouse of reaction to the sixth kill.
Even Captain Shubert seemed to know they'd had it now, that, saving a miracle, their prey had gone to earth again and wasn't going to show his corpse-like face for another 21 years.
A certain reporter being bailed out knew, too-- knew it, and was fit to be tied by it.
Hey, Shubert, okay?
- Kolchak,
- Okay, Shubert?
- I told him, the idiot!
- Kolchak!
I told him, but would he Iisten?
No, he didn't Iisten,
"I've been a policeman for 37 years,"
And an idiot for twice that Iong!
You were supposed to be in Puyallup with the daffodils!
- Where?
- I'd Iike to Ieave you here forever,
I'd Iike to see them Iock you up in a jail cell for a million years!
- If you don't shut your mouth--
- What's the matter with you?
You oughta see a doctor,
I'm serious,
You sound terrible,
It's awful,
What have you done to that poor man?
I have never seen anyone so close to total insanity before,
...he just disappears,
We cornered him in the alleys behind the Richards CIinic, and he disappears, just Iike that,
Vincenzo was so upset, it took me an hour to get rid of him, and then only because I promised to go straight home to bed.
Maybe no one else knew what was going on, but I was sure that I did.
Our man had to have a way in and out of some secret part of the underground, and the basement of his old clinic had to be it.
Right here,
Get in the shadows,
- You're not going down there?
- You stay here,
What is it?
Looks Iike a big air shaft down here,
Where does it go?
AII over,
I'm gonna check it out,
- Carl! Are you all right?
- Yeah, sure, of course,
You, uh...you stay here,
I'II be right back,
Just when I thought
I'd struck out, I found it.
It's in there, Give me
30 minutes, then call the police
- and tell 'em where I am,
- What are you gonna do?
Get my exclusive, what do you think?
I think you're crazy, that's what I think,
Just do what I tell ya,
I gotta get going,
Here it was--the hidden city beneath Seattle's underground.
I was descending to the world of yesterday, the world of the 1 9th century, of bustle pads and high-crown hats and Queen Victoria.
The private world of Dr. Richard Malcolm.
Who are you?
- Are you...?
- Who are you?
Carl Kolchak,Daily Chronicle.
How did you get here?
Through the, uh... the cellar of your clinic,
CIinic? I have no clinic,
Why do you say that?
But you are... you are
Dr, Richard Malcolm,
I've seen you somewhere before,
Nah,
Oh, Well, you almost killed me the other day
- in the alley,
- What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
I thought I'd drop in and find out about you so I could tell my readers,
Your what?
My readers,
His readers,
Did you hear that?
Nobody is ever going to hear from you again,
- I think I'II go now,
- You've profaned my world, sir,
I will not permit you to Iive here, to stay here... to exist here,
I'm just a dumb reporter doing his job,
You grovel nicely,
Mister, uh...
Kolchak, sir,
Daily Chronicle, Sir,
So, you want a story,
He wants a story, darling,
What do you think?
We'II see if there's time,
Yes, we have time,
Why not, why not?
It seems only fitting that one other person in the world ought to know the facts... before he dies,
Yes, Mr, Kolchak,
Okay, come on,
I'II not bore you with the details of how I evolved my formula,
Suffice it to say that the additive which ultimately made it work for me was the blood of women, removed from their brains in the seven seconds following their death,
I found that six were required to supply the quantity of blood that was needed for the 18-day period in which the elixir was prepared and consumed,
In 1868, I first took the elixir,
Then, believing that my immortality was assured,
I decided to perfect and refine the formula... in the hopes of bestowing its benefits on mankind,
No Ionger circumscribed by time and death, what wonders on this earth could men not then achieve?
And then... in 1889... my world collapsed,
Yes, 1889,
Your family died, and you began to age,
Are you going to Iisten?
- Or are you going to interrupt?
- No, no!
Listen, Iisten,
I discovered that the effects of the elixir were not permanent,
I began to age,
I had to kill again,
Restore myself,
That's why you Iook the way you do now, isn't it?
Yes,
Stage by stage... in 18 days,
That's the way the elixir works,
Yes, And then I shall have
21 more years to make its effects permanent,
Twenty-one more years?
That's all you're ever going to have, isn't it?
That's not true, I'II find the answer eventually,
Eventually?
How many more women are going to have to die?
What's a few Iives compared to immortality, Mr, Kolchak?
This is the sixth and final dosage,
I shall take it shortly, and the revitalization shall be complete,
If I don't take this final dosage now, the process will reverse itself,
But I will take it,
Why?
Hey, buddy boy,
Yeah!
What about me?
Vincenzo! What kind of dirty, rotten deal is this?!
- Hold it, Carl, hold it,
- Don't "Carl" me!
I've heard of yellow-Iivered sellouts before,
- but this I don't believe!
- Wait a minute--
What is this
"identity unknown" garbage?
Where is my story?
- You want your story?
- Yeah,
AII right,
I'II give you your story,
AII 20 copies,
- Twenty copies?!
- That's all we got printed before Crossbinder stopped 'em,
What are you so surprised about?
I'm the dummy!
I thought they'd print all that!
Why didn't you print it?
You're the managing editor!
What's wrong with you?
You think there's any difference between this town and Vegas?
But they saw it, Tony!
They all saw it!
Even Shubert saw it!
No one in Seattle is going to admit that a dead man's roaming around their city killing people since 1889, but I was stupid enough to think that they would!
So, this is it, huh?
And I'm out of a job,
That right, Vincenzo?
That I feel bad about, Carl,
Why should you feel bad, Tony?
- You're still working,
- I don't deserve that, Carl,
If you had any guts Ieft, any at all,
- you'd go upstairs and--
- AII right! I've had enough!
So have I! Don't ever do me any more favors!
Do you any favors?
- You miserable, ungrateful--
- Ungrateful?!
What do you want me to do, thank you?!
No! Just get outta here, Get out!
And next time, you do me a favor, hear?
You see me again, just keep walkin'!
With pleasure!
And thanks, Vincenzo,
Thanks for nothin'!
Hello?
Oh, yes, sir,
Yes, Mr, Crossbinder,
Right, I'II be right up,
There it is, another tale of defeat snatched from the jaws of triumph, another case of virtue unrewarded, of dishonesty being the best policy,
- injustice rampant--
- Will you shut up and put that recorder away and Iet me get some sleep?
You're never gonna get that story published,
Don't tell me what
I'm gonna get published,
- Nobody's gonna kill this story,
- It's already been killed,
- Bury it,
- Not this one, no, sir,
I'd Iike to see somebody shut me up on this one,
- Can anybody shut you up?
- You are a passenger in this car,
This is my automobile,
You remember what you said?
"I never wanna see you again,
I never wanna talk to you again,"
- remember?
- Yeah, I remember,
- That was before I was fired,
- Yeah, that's right,
Don't worry about it, you're gonna Iove it in New York,
- New York?!
- New York,
Yup, that's where we're going,
And you're Iucky to be going with me,
I suppose I should consider myself Iucky, too,
- That's right,
- Oh, Kolchak,
Do you know that I have heard just about all
I wanna take from you or even hear ever again?
You think you've got problems?
There I was, one semester shy of getting my degree in Psychology, and what happens?
You show up outside my houseboat one day,
Mouth, all mouth, Kolchak!
Compared to you,
I am tongue-tied,
And before I know what's going on, there I am being yelled at by that-- that captain of police,
Yada, yada, yada,
Peace!
Can I have some peace?
PIease, some peace!
- Well!
- How about that, sports fans?
What is a rubber suit?
I'm an accent freak.
I'm not sure why.
Probably on account of...
I don't know if you've noticed or not, but I stammer.
- When you were young, you mean?
- No, no.
I still do.
Just I work extra hard to control it.
Now, here.
I want you to write down every place you've ever lived, from when you were born until now.
And this is just standard vocabulary.
See, just straight through the alphabet.
"A. Aback. Abandon." Like that.
And this here's easy to operate.
Just push the switch and talk into it.
I think I can manage that,
- but what's this for?
- Just a lifelong hobby.
- Don't touch.
- See, once I get enough samples,
I aim to feed them all into a computer and program it.
What I'll get back is an instant geographical rundown on a person.
I really think it'll be more important than fingerprints in police work.
That's very interesting, Claude, but it's too much work.
We Stepford wives are busy, busy, busy. You know, like your wife.
- Is he going to take your fingerprints?
- No, sweetie.
Just like your wife.
Bobby and I tried to involve her in one of our projects, but she had too much ironing.
Maybe you could convince her.
Kit Sunderson too.
If they could find the time for me,
I could find it for you.
Isn't this kind of blackmail, Joanna?
It's what made this country great,
Claude.
Usually we start out bitching, but maybe if we're lucky, we can get into something more constructive.
Anybody have any questions?
Well, good.
Then we might as well get started.
Fine. Terrific.
Who wants to go first?
Talk about anything.
Sex, money, our marriages, anything at all.
Well, how about if I start?
Right, yes, well...
I think there are times when
Walter cares more about the law than he does about me, and that can hurt.
I don't think that...
I don't think that Ed ever loved me.
I mean, he married me because I looked right.
It made a big impression on the other TV executives for his wife to look like I look.
God knows he's given me things.
I'm not complaining on that score, but...
He never loved me.
I didn't bake anything yesterday.
Took me so long to get the upstairs floor to shine,
I didn't have any time to bake.
Well, you don't have to bake, Kit.
There's no law.
Hell, Ed's lucky if I remember to keep him in white bread.
Easy On spray starch.
It must save me half an hour a day, at least.
You'll never run short of time again.
I guarantee it.
I've just been tempted so many times to try Easy On.
I'm not trying to be a leader or anything, but we're not supposed to delve quite so specifically into housework.
Easy On's really that good, is it?
Is it that good? Well, if time is your enemy, make friends with Easy On.
That's all I can tell you.
It's so good that if ever I became famous and the Easy On people asked me would I do a commercial, not only would I do it,
I'd do it for free.
That's how good it is.
Holy cow.
I think I'll take Fred for a walk.
Fred?
- Where is he? Did he get out again?
- No.
I said I was going to take him for a walk.
You going out?
No, I'm gonna walk him around the bathroom.
You just keep doing whatever you're doing.
I'm very fond of you.
Well, I'm fond of you too.
Fred!
Freddie. Wanna go for a walk?
Fine, Walter, just fine.
Fred.
Fred.
Come on back here now.
Don't give me a hard time!
Fred!
Fred.
Fred. Come here.
Sorry about that, lady.
I really didn't mean to frighten you.
- Oh, it's Mrs Eberhart.
- Yes. And you did frighten me.
Once again, Mrs Eberhart, my apologies.
But this is a pretty quiet town.
Lot of very nice houses, like your own.
People have valuable things.
We have to be careful.
You see that old mansion over there?
- It's a landmark building.
- I didn't know that.
Some railroad tycoon built it in 1870.
Before the Men's Association took it over, it was a wreck.
Now the Association's got a restoration committee to try and fix up what was ruined, so we have to be very careful.
We can't let people just walk around at night.
One of the reasons I moved from the city was so I could walk around at night.
Well, certainly, you and Fred can walk around at night.
But I'd stick a little closer to home.
Really, Mrs Eberhart, this isn't the best place for you to wander around.
I see.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.
Come on, Ed, let me drive.
You're in no fit state, OK?
All right?
Thattaboy.
Just lie back and relax.
Feel OK?
Good.
All right. Here we go.
Joanna.
Joanna. Come over here.
Come over here.
- Hi, dear.
- That's lovely, honey.
All right, ladies?
Got everything you want?
- Oh, yes, thanks.
- Have a good day.
Thanks so much.
- I was trying to tell you.
- Yes, what was that about?
- That was Frank.
- Frank?
The house. Remember?
That was Frank.
And that was Mrs Frank.
- "God, there, Frank, yes."
- Oh, I remember.
I remember. God.
Now, how about that for our Stepford twosome.
- Oh, God, yes. Wait a minute.
- OK.
We're going the wrong way.
I have to go this way.
- Cleaners.
- Yes.
- Hi.
- On the other side.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Have you heard?
Just spreading like wildfire.
A black family's moving into town.
Think that's good?
I think it's good.
Well, I don't know if I think it's good so much as I think it's natural, considering, well,
I mean, after all, we are the most liberal town around.
- Stepford?
- Liberal?
Well, sure.
We have the first Chinese restaurant in Fairfield County.
Ah, yes.
And we had the first women's club to ask any of those liberation ladies to come lecture.
- There are no women's clubs here.
- There was.
I went to a meeting once.
There must have been
50 of us there.
Well, where the hell are they?
Some of them moved away, but I guess most of them just plain got bored.
I know I did.
There we are. Off you go.
We disbanded, oh, years ago. We weren't accomplishing anything useful.
You mean useful like doing housework?
I like to see my home looking nice.
Look, we found this at the library.
Listen, Carol, it says you were president of that club.
I only took the post because nobody else would.
Please explain to me what you're into.
Is it enough?
Well, enough for me maybe is not enough for you, Joanna, but...
Well, you see, Ted's doing really well in his scientific research now, and I give him a good home.
I really think that helps.
The kids are doing the best they've ever done in school, and I'm here all the time. I...
Well, I know that helps too.
I'm really off the booze, and God knows that's better.
It's none of your business, but our sex life is better too.
Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm happy.
I'm happy.
You know, maybe we're the crazy ones.
Don't say that. We're not.
- You sure?
- We're fine.
OK.
We are fine.
- Hi.
- How'd it go?
What? Oh, well, he hated them.
I must say, I was inclined to agree.
I don't know what made me take them.
But still...
Did the girls bring Fred over when they came?
Not that I know of.
Oh, shoot.
And he has no license, nothing.
Can I leave the kids here a bit while I go look for him?
Sure, I'll go with you.
- Dave, will you take care of the kids?
- OK.
I'll be right back.
All right, Mommy.
We'll find him. Tell me more about what that fink said in the gallery.
Fred! Fred!
- Did you see what I saw?
- Found him?
No, back at Charmaine's.
Oh, my God.
You see, Ed hated tennis, but he never said a word.
All he wanted to do was to please me.
Well, I want to please him now, and, boy, am I ever going to.
You see, we spent this weekend at this beautiful little inn in Vermont.
Just Ed and me, you know, talking things through.
The Park Merrill with some friends, the Fishers, and we had the most terrific time.
I can't get my mind operating.
Besides, I'm just swamped with work.
- Work?
- Oh, yes. I fired Nettie.
Yeah, it was...
It was just the being alone with Ed that did it.
All I ever thought about before was just me.
Well,
I'm here to tell you that's all over now.
Ed's always hankered after a heated swimming pool.
And now he's going to get it.
Look, I've been doing a little research, OK?
And a lot of thinking.
And I know what I'm gonna say is gonna sound crazy, but if you laugh at it,
I swear to God I'm gonna be sick.
OK, you remember hearing about the Texas tranquilliser?
It was in TIME. I cut it out.
Wait a second. Sit down.
Issue dated October 4th, 1971.
'71, right.
It's about why there are almost no murders in El Paso.
See, this scientist has this theory that there's something that comes from the water in El Paso.
It comes from deep wells, and it's got some chemical tranquilliser in it and... Well, read.
See?
Dallas is over two times as big as El Paso, but that year, there were 242 murders in Dallas.
And there were only 13 in El Paso.
Joanna. Joanna, I think that's what's going on in Stepford.
I think there's something in the water that turns us into hausfraus, drones, whatever you want to call it.
Charmaine's changed,
Carol Van Sant's changed, and so have all those other women's club members.
Well, I...
I suppose it's possible.
It can't all be coincidence.
Look at all those places.
Electronics, computers, aerospace junk.
And labs. Who knows what?
They must all be dumping their chemical garbage in the Stepford River, and it could be making its way to us.
Listen, the 6:00 news scares me every night.
I don't see what's so far-out about my theory.
All right. Why don't we write the state environmental agency and have them check the water in the reservoir.
Governmental agencies.
I've worked for them, Joanna.
And I mean, if they're way above average or any good at all, they'll manage to lose a letter if you send it to them.
They teach courses in misfiling at those places.
You know what I think we ought to do?
I think we ought to take a sample of the water ourselves and then get it to a trustworthy chemist.
Trouble is,
I don't know anybody except...
...you know, guys at that stinking Men's Association.
I lost my virginity to a trustworthy chemist.
No kidding.
Did he do it on Blue Cross?
- His name was Raymond Chandler.
- Oh, gosh.
And we had a gag, a sort of stupid, private thing going.
I used to ask him why he didn't talk like he wrote.
He wasn't a bit hard-boiled, and he hated any sort of violence.
But I kept it going.
Some nights I wouldn't let him touch me until he told me the plot of his next novel.
Which was, of course,
The Big Sleep.
Sometimes it nearly drove him crazy.
Isn't it funny the things you do when you're in love?
We were both seniors at NYU, and it wasn't just passion. It was love.
Why didn't you marry him?
I don't know.
Maybe we took the joke too far.
Maybe the fun went out of it.
I thought Walter was going to become Perry Mason.
So it was Farewell, My Lovely.
Did you ever see that?
Anyway, I think if I look in the phone book and this guy is still in New York, then he's our man.
- Are you out of your mind?
- No.
I can't just call him up and say,
"Hi, I used to be Joanna Ingles.
"You deflowered me 12 years ago.
Would you check my water?"
Final gas-chromatograph readings will be coming in in a minute or two.
- Thank you so much for this.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- Long time.
- Twelve years.
You married a dentist, wasn't that it?
Lawyer.
You happy?
- Yes, very.
- Good, good.
- Are you married?
- Going on nine years.
And, yes, very.
Here's the report you ordered,
Mr Chandler.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Well, I can say right off the bat that...
...you've got water in your water.
Now, what can I tell you girls?
I mean, I wouldn't want to drink too much of it,
- but it's water.
- Can't you be more specific?
Yes, but in order to do that,
I'd specifically have to know what it is I'm trying to find.
I mean, there's nothing here.
Look at that.
Well, can you go any further in confirming my suspicions?
I'm sorry, about what?
The women in Stepford love housework, and I thought there might be something in the water.
- Where did you find her?
- It's not funny.
No, it isn't.
All right. You're right.
Look, that was rude of me.
- Mrs...
- Markowe.
Markowe.
I can tell you categorically that there's no such thing as a cleaner-compeller.
If there was, I would patent it myself, make a million bucks, win the Nobel Prize and retire.
I guess we're going.
I'll see you outside.
- I'm sorry. Tell her that.
- Yes.
Hey, we blew it, didn't we?
I don't know, Raymond.
It's hard to be smart.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
I don't care what anybody says.
I'm not going to end up like one of those pan-scrubbers.
I'm getting the hell out of Stepford.
I'll ask Dave tonight, and we'll move.
Hey, hey, hey, you too.
You can't break up a team like us.
We're the best thing to happen since Laurel and Hardy.
Will you think about it?
"Zoom.
"Zoot suit.
"Zulu."
And that's that.
I'm finally finished.
When was that?
Walter, would you move?
No, no.
- What? What did I say?
- I meant move, leave Stepford.
We just got to Stepford.
Hey, are you that unhappy?
Is it everything you expected?
Well...
No. No, it's not, but...
...I just didn't want to be the first one to admit it.
You know, I'm the one that wanted to come here in the first place.
You think the men are dull.
Well, I think the women are too.
You're right. I agree with you.
That's why I want to move.
Yeah, but the area sure is nice, though, you know.
It's perfect for the kids.
Maybe Norwood or Eastbridge.
OK, let's move.
You mean it?
That's all there is to it?
I just had to ask?
Shouldn't we fight or something?
Well, I don't want to move tonight, Joanna.
What is it, June already? And I got all this work piled up here. Jesus, I...
OK, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you look around, and we'll figure on moving in August.
That way, the kids can get settled in before school starts.
Hey, these papers are all in sequence, you know.
I mean, you're crushing
Mr Ziegler's will.
I'll make you a beneficiary.
I guess Mr Ziegler can wait a little while.
- You mean it? We can move?
- Yeah.
Oh, Walter.
Oh, Walter, you're really sweet.
Girls, I think after four houses,
I'm getting to know your taste.
This may be it.
He's an ITT VP transferred to
Panama, probably to start a revolution.
There will be at least eight lonely ladies in Eastbridge Centre for a while.
I don't know how he got away with it so close to home.
- Oh, my.
- I'll go in first. You stay here.
They gave me the key, but you never know what you'll walk into.
Thanks. Oh, Mrs Kirgassa,
I love you.
Oh, she's fat and lovely.
She's got a big mouth, and I love her.
What a treat. When I told Dave we were house hunting, he nearly jumped out of his skin.
He threatened to cancel The Plaza.
- What is The Plaza?
- Oh, I forgot.
I'm supposed to ask you if you will take our kids and the dog so Dave and I can have a weekend, our annual weekend, at The Plaza.
It's to commemorate the time he took a young virgin to the theatre and faked her up to his room.
Hell, I had to lose it sometime.
- The coast is clear. Come on, girls.
- Right.
- Anyway, will you do it for me?
- Do what?
Take care of the kids and the dog for the weekend.
Oh, I know it's just a horrible thing to even think about, isn't it? Forget it.
- No. Yes, it is, but OK.
- You will?
The girls at least will love having the dog.
Ever since dear old Fred departed, they've been after me
- to get another one.
- Yes.
- I don't know about Walter, though.
- What do you mean?
Well, you know, Walter hates noise.
- I want one!
- Me!
The dog's under the table, for crying...
Hey, there's a dog under the table.
Honey, can I have some more coffee, please?
Dolly is...
Dolly's under the table here.
I wish you would...
Can I have some more coffee, please?
How many pancakes are you gonna give...? Yeah, thank you.
- Joanna.
- Yeah?
Look, I played Monopoly with them.
I didn't pass go, I didn't collect.
I played backgammon. I played
Scrabble with the goddamn kids.
They're in the kitchen now.
What do you want me to do?
Walter, you've had seven years of college. Use your brain.
I'm sorry, but I'm onto something, and I think maybe it's the best I've ever done. And I wanna stick with it.
But how do I amuse them?
I amuse them seven days a week.
They know all the
Sesame Street songs.
- Have a sing-along.
- A sing-along.
Jesus.
Mr Atkinson, I've been at these since Saturday, just about nonstop, because I had to get them into some sort of shape for you to see because I think they're an improvement, and you've got to think so too.
I'm doing all the talking, I know, but these are my little girls and those are someone else's, my best friend's little boys.
And you've just got to tell me, am I crazy?
Aren't they good?
Please say something.
I don't care.
No, I do care.
Don't say anything bad.
These are really quite good.
You're not saying that because you're frightened I might be a crazy lady?
Clearly, you are a crazy lady, but clearly, again, these are nice.
Wait a minute.
You said "good".
"Really quite good", you said.
Good is better than nice.
You're not changing your mind, are you?
No. The results are lovely.
Don't get upset again.
Lovely is better than good.
But what fascinates me is, what is it you want from it all?
Do you know?
I want...
...somewhere...
...someday, someone to look at something and say,
"Hey, that reminds of an Ingles."
Ingles was my maiden name.
I guess I want to be remembered.
Yeah, don't we all?
Bobby?
- It's me.
- Kitchen.
I've just come from Atkinson's in New York, and he loves my stuff.
Well, not loves, maybe, but he's genuinely interested in my work.
The gallery for photographers.
That's wonderful, Joanna.
If you're going to tell me you don't like this dress,
I'm sticking my head right in the oven.
Dave bought it for me for the weekend.
He spent a ton on me.
How about the shape?
Padded uplift bra.
It's true what they say in the ads.
Oh, Joanna, Dave turned me loose in Bergdorf's,
- and I went mad.
- Bobby.
At The Plaza, some guy tried picking me up in the lobby.
You know how long it's been since that happened?
Of course, I did look terrific.
Bobby, you're not at The Plaza now, so why are you wearing all that makeup?
You never even used to clean your kitchen, much less wear makeup.
Admit it, Joanna, I was a joke.
Dave works hard all day long, and what does he come home to?
- A slob.
- Bobby, it's gotten to you now.
Nothing's got me.
I just want to look like a woman and keep my house looking decent too.
- You're just like Charmaine.
- Will you stop?
And you're not going to leave
Stepford either, are you?
Leave Stepford?
Good schools, low taxes, clean air?
No. You're right.
- Shall I make us a nice pot of coffee?
- No, no. I've really got to go now.
Stop by any time. I'll be here.
- Oh, my God, look out!
- Watch out!
OK, so you're upset. So you pass a school bus, and you dent the wagon.
Bobby Markowe buys a new bra, and I gotta pay for a new mailbox for the Van Sants.
So what? So, what are you talking about, Joanna?
Why can't you understand?
Her kitchen was sparkling.
Yeah, so you said.
Look, I hate to come on like the heavy, but what's that got to do with you going crazy?
It wasn't just that.
It wasn't just anything.
She's changed!
And stop telling me I'm crazy.
Are you two fighting?
- No.
- We don't like it when you fight.
Look, we're not fighting. We're just talking. Now, come on, you guys.
Go on outside, all right?
Oh, boy. This is really terrific.
This is really terrific for them, you know.
Yeah, I remember when my mother and father used to yell at each other.
- I didn't want them to go through this.
- Well, neither do I.
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry about the car, but I was panicked and upset.
Oh, look. That's no big deal.
It's the rest of it that bothers me.
Just try to look at it from my point of view, Joanna.
Walter, I just want to say one thing to you.
Bobby really has changed.
Believe me.
Everything in her house looked like a TV commercial.
Well, good. Good.
She had to clean it sooner or later.
It looked like a goddamn pigsty.
I mean, when are things gonna start sparkling around here?
That's what I'd like to know.
I mean, just look at the way my kids are dressed. Ragamuffins.
Jeez, I work 80 hours a week.
I live in a great house, and my kids look like they belong on welfare.
Look, if you paid a little more attention to your family and a little less
- to your goddamn picture-taking...
- I'm getting the hell out of Stepford.
I'm getting us a house now, and if it's hard on you, tough.
And if it's hard on the kids,
I'll ease up on my goddamn picture- taking and stay around the house, and believe me, they'll survive.
That's what I'm talking about, Walter, is surviving.
OK. All right.
I mean, I'll take a loss on this great house if I have to.
But there's one condition, or we don't go anywhere.
You see somebody. You get some help. You see a psychiatrist.
I'm fine.
I don't need to see anybody.
Yeah, well, you say you're fine, but me, I'd like another opinion because I'm not too anxious to move to Eastbridge and after four months there, be told by my sweet wife we got to move again because she doesn't like the way her neighbours keep their houses clean.
Look, I'm not asking anything unreasonable, and I don't like asking it.
But you want me to disrupt our lives for the second time in a couple of months on some fixation you've gotten.
Now, that's the unreasonable part.
You've got to see that.
You and me, we don't have to fight about this.
We're going to move.
It's only a few more weeks.
It doesn't have to be anything dramatic.
There's a couple of topnotch guys right here in town.
Just talk to one of them.
They'd see you.
But I wouldn't see them.
If I see anybody, I'll find my own.
I'm here at my husband's insistence.
We moved to Stepford with our children, oh, a few months ago.
Before that, we lived in Manhattan.
And now I want to move out.
You see, I have nothing against the general area, but the women in Stepford just seem to be on a different wavelength.
Well, that all seems very straightforward.
And your husband wants you to see me because...?
He feels I'm being irrational.
He says there's no certainty
I'd like Eastbridge or someplace like that any better.
And he doesn't want to spend his life moving from one house to another.
Yes, understandable, but Stepford, I know, has a reputation for being unsocial.
So I also understand why you might be unhappy there.
I'd be unhappy there.
Any move is traumatic, and a city-to-suburbs move for a woman with interests other than purely family can seem like a jaunt to Siberia.
What would you think of if I said Westport, Connecticut?
Writers, artists.
Now you have no reason to know this, but Truro, Massachusetts, is this sort of elephant's graveyard for psychoanalysts.
Perhaps Stepford is heaven for the house-and-garden type.
One person tells another.
Some don't like it and leave.
Others that do like it, arrive.
I mean, Westport didn't always have writers.
They didn't breed from an original pair.
I understand.
Well, I'm not surprised.
You're obviously a very bright woman.
What does surprise me is that you have come all this way to talk to me, and then you don't talk to me.
I think the men are behind it.
What men?
All of them.
All of them in the Association.
My husband, everyone.
The women don't...
Can't arrive in Stepford loving housework.
They change once they get there.
I think the men make them change.
How would they do that?
I don't know. They...
They...
Oh, Jesus.
It's so awful.
If I'm wrong, I'm insane.
And if I'm right, it's worse than if I'm wrong.
I don't know what they do exactly.
They draw our pictures, and they tape our voices.
And the women all look neat and pretty.
There's a man.
He's a druggist.
He runs the pharmacy.
And he's nothing.
He's nothing, but his wife is just breathtaking.
And once, by mistake, I happened to hear them making love, and she was carrying on incredibly, like he was some kind of God's gift.
And Charmaine changed in four months and ripped up her tennis court.
And Bobby, my best friend, changed in four months, and that's what convinced me.
That's how long I've been in Stepford. Four months.
And I don't know what's going on.
I just know something is wrong, and my time is coming.
You're terribly frightened, aren't you?
Can you sleep?
Well, that's easy.
We can take care of that.
We'll see a lot of each other, and you can talk some more.
See, it's unfortunate, but I have to go away for a couple of days.
It's something I can't put off at this short notice,
- but when I'm back, we'll talk.
- No.
No, you don't want to talk, or what?
I won't be here when you get back.
Don't you see?
It's going to happen before then.
Don't ask me to explain it.
I just know.
There will be somebody with my name, and she'll cook and clean like crazy, but she won't take pictures, and she won't be me.
She'll...
She'll... She'll be like one of those robots in Disneyland.
All right, now listen.
I'll give you a prescription, which you'll have filled.
Then you gather up your children, and you get the hell away.
Don't tell your husband.
Don't tell anyone.
Just go wherever you feel safe.
- Now, do you have family?
- They're dead.
Well, just drive and stop someplace, and in a few days,
I'll be back on the 10th, you ring me, I'll come to you, and we'll sort this thing out.
Now, how does that sound?
They're not here.
- Where are they?
- I told you, they're not here.
They're with friends.
They're fine.
Amy?
Kim?
Which friends?
They're fine.
How was your visit?
Did she fix you up?
Walter, I'm taking the children away.
Where are they?
Are they at Bobby's?
Look. Just...
They're fine. I told you.
Look, we don't want you to get upset again.
Now just go on upstairs and lie down.
Don't talk to me like that. I don't want to lie down. I want my children.
Joanna, go upstairs and lie down now!
Don't tell me what to do, you bastard!
- Joanna.
- Walter!
Joanna, open this goddamn door!
All right, you just stay in there, then.
You just stay in there.
Cornell call you? Yeah, yeah.
I had some trouble. I don't know, but I think I handled it.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't know.
I do not know, but I think it's all right.
She's upset.
She's really upset.
She ran upstairs.
Yeah.
Well, she's in the room.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think it's...
I think it's all right.
Oh, Dis?
Well, what should I do?
Oh, I'll just...
Why, look at you, for heaven's sakes.
Bobby. Bobby, listen.
You need a fresh-perked cup of coffee.
I don't want any coffee.
I just want my children.
Well, they're not here.
Dave's working late, so I shooed my boys off with friends so I could give myself a chance to do some real cleaning.
Who ever told you
Kim and Amy were here?
No one. No one, but the night they changed you, I kept your kids.
It just seemed logical to me.
Changed me? What's that mean?
I don't know. I really don't.
Bobby, stop it! Look at me.
Say I'm right.
You are different.
Your figure's different, your face, what you talk about, all of this is different.
Yes. Yes. This, it's wonderful.
Why don't you change your mind and have a cup.
What does "archaic" mean?
- Archaic?
- Yes.
- I don't know.
- Think. You used to know.
When we went to Marie Axhelm's and she was ironing,
- she didn't know, but you did.
- Did I? Well, I forgot.
How do you want it?
- It wasn't on the word list, was it?
- This is a new blend and very mild.
- Do you take cream?
- Look, I bleed.
- Oh, that's right. You take it black.
- When I cut myself, I bleed.
- Do you bleed?
- Why, look at your hand.
No, you look.
Joanna.
How could you do a thing like that?
How could you do a thing like that?
How could you do a thing like that?
When I was just going to give you coffee.
When I was just going to give you coffee.
When I was just going to give you coffee.
I thought we were friends.
I thought we were friends.
I was just going to give you coffee.
I was just going to give you coffee.
I thought we were friends.
I thought we were friends.
I thought we were friends.
How could you do a thing like that?
I thought we were friends.
She must have sneaked out when I was on the telephone.
Listen, Walter. It's gonna be OK.
The phones are jammed, the alarm is out, and the roads are blocked off.
Everybody's out looking for her, so don't panic.
I'll be back, all right?
I want my children!
Where are they?
Where are they? Where are my children? I want them.
Association.
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Hello, Joanna.
Mom...?
Quite a lot of worry you caused everybody.
Poor Walter is very concerned.
Where are my children?
The first time I met you,
I knew you were a good mother.
Well, they're quite safe.
Having a lovely evening with Charmaine.
She was thrilled to have them.
What have you got there?
Oh, no. No.
No, you're not gonna need that.
It's nothing like that at all.
You've got quite the wrong idea.
You've had the wrong idea all the time.
It's nothing like you imagine.
Just another stage.
Think about it like that, and there's nothing to it.
Why?
Why?
Because we can.
We found a way of doing it, and it's just perfect.
It's perfect for us and perfect for you.
You're a very good subject.
Perhaps the best we've had.
You were brighter than most.
Do you mind if I make a call?
See, think of it the other way around.
Wouldn't you like some perfect stud waiting on you around the house?
Praising you? Servicing you?
Whispering how your sagging flesh was beautiful, no matter how you looked?
Excuse me.
Everything's fine.
Just as I said.
Aren't I always right?
Yes, I'll take it from now.
Everybody can go home.
Well, that's all there is.
So why don't we get it over.
You know, you hurried us a little.
We weren't quite ready for you, if you want to know the truth.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
- Hi, Kit. How are you?
- Hello, Marie Ann.
Linda, what do you want?
I don't want to spend my entire day in the supermarket.
Look, we live in a nice neighbourhood.
This is clean, safe.
Why don't you give it a chance.
- Hello, Marie.
- Hello, Charmaine.
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Charmaine.
- Hello, Carol.
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hello, Carol. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello, Joanna. How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm fine.
- How are the children?
- They're fine.
- And yours?
- Fine, fine.

Surprised?
You betcha.
In your telegram you said
Mrs. James Devereaux, I didn't...
That's who I've been for the last 17 years.
You never told me.
You never asked.
Why are we whispering?
Come on, back over here.
Come on.
Wait a minute, hold it.
Boy, you look terrific.
So do you. Except you got a little gray over your ears there.
It's the only difference.
Everything else works about the same.
That was six years ago.
Really was a voluptuous week, wasn't it?
Yeah, aside from the good times, you didn't give away much though, did you?
Why did you drop us like that?
I turned around to wind my watch and turned back and you slipped out of L.A.
It was time to go home.
So?
Why was I flown down here, for sport or business?
No, for business. Strictly business.
Remember you told me that if I ever had any real trouble...
Uh-huh, well...
Oh, my God!
Is he looking at me?
I think he was a little more interested in me.
Listen, I've made a reservation for you here, at the Town House.
My telephone number is right there, inside the cover.
Now you...
You call me tomorrow, all right?
Your door was unlocked.
It still is, kid. Out!
Come on, Lew, give me a break.
You're either an awful good guesser or you're a cop.
Swimming's an okay way to relax.
But I know a better way.
All right, that's enough.
Now, who the hell are you and how'd you know my name?
Don't you think I'm kind of sexy?
Yeah, I think you're kind of sexy.
But I'm not gonna spend the 200th anniversary...
...of this great country of ours in the slammer.
- Come on, out.
- Never had anyone turn me down before.
There's a first time for everything, kid.
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, you're not.
You're right, I'm not.
Now come on, out.
- Hey!
- Grab the paint.
What the hell are you...?
Listen! You keep your goddamn mouth shut, mister.
You want to make a statement?
Now, you listen. I can fix it so you won't get no pleasure pissing.
Nobody will ever find a mark. Really.
Now, let me see.
- We got child molestation, stat...
- Oh, come on.
- Statutory rape.
- Nope.
- Indecent exposure.
- Nope.
Resisting arrest.
Carrying a concealed weapon.
I got a permit.
Not in Louisiana you haven't.
Chief, this here is Harper.
Thank you, lieutenant,
I know who he is.
And Harper thinks that he is bright.
I'll take it from here.
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant Franks gets overenthusiastic now and again.
I just called you in for questioning.
What the hell does he do for a living?
Tell me something, what do you private detectives get these days?
- Hundred and fifty per.
- A day?
And expenses.
That's a lot of money.
Not if you only work four days a year, it ain't.
What's the beef?
The beef is that you were seen in the state of undress...
...in a motel room with an underage girl.
- Who did the seeing?
- I did.
Guess a whole lot doesn't happen in town...
...without you knowing.
Mister, you don't belch without me knowing about it.
She let herself in.
Hey, I may be horny, but I'm not stupid.
You down here working on a case?
Yep.
Employed by who, and what for?
Well, the what for is confidential.
The who is a Mrs. Devereaux.
Olivia Devereaux?
No, Iris.
Do you know her?
Yeah, sure, sure. That family has a lot of pull around here.
- Where do you know her from?
- Confidential.
I'd sure like to know what the hell she'd need a private peeper for.
Well, I can't say, I mean, it's the ethics of the profession.
You feel left out?
One, I believe you about the girl, at least for now.
Now, that doesn't mean
I can't throw you in jail...
...and let you fight it in court.
See where I'm going?
I'm picking up signs.
Two, I'm keeping your weapon.
It violates our local gun policy.
I don't want you shooting up the place.
Okay.
Three, don't give me any of that
West Coast, snot-ass bullshit.
Now, we may talk a little different down here but we ain't stupid either.
I hear what you're saying.
That's good, that's good.
One more thing there, Harper.
If anything untoward should happen to Iris or her daughter, Schuyler...
...I'd like to hear about it first.
I take a strong interest in the welfare of those two, you hear?
Sure.
Hi, Lew Harper.
Mrs. James Devereaux is expecting me.
Yes, I'll tell Miss Devereaux you're here.
Please, all I said was that the opening is a little flowery.
Well, damn it, at least give it a fair reading.
All right, James, that's right, indulge yourself in another drink...
...it might help create the atmosphere for your... Your artistry.
The one indulgence
I have never had is privacy.
It just isn't very good, I'm afraid.
Mrs. Devereaux...
- Yes?
- There's a gentleman here to see you.
Thank you.
I don't know where to start.
Why don't you start where you stopped yesterday.
- I'm frightened, Lew.
- That's a good place.
Hey, you're not running off again, are you?
"Mr. James Devereaux."
"Dear Mr. Devereaux, lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
The deceived husband, so love's face may still seem love to you...
...though altered anew.
Do you enjoy playing the cuckold?
Or are you unaware of your wife's amorous activity?"
Well, it's an old portable.
With a flaky E.
Interesting style...
...if I remember my high school lit. Class.
Mailed right here in Rivage.
"Rivage."
Does your husband know about this?
No, he wasn't at home when the mail arrived.
You usually read his mail?
We read each other's mail.
What does he do for a living?
Writes unproduced plays...
Between drinks.
Where does all this come from?
This all belongs to his mother.
Olivia's family has owned Beau Rivage for 175 years.
The abolition of slavery was a mild agitation for them.
How did you slip in?
Born into the lace.
Good blood, no money.
One becomes accustomed to style.
Is that the old lady? Olivia?
What's she doing out there, changing the guard?
She has a iron clamp around this house.
Do you know that she keeps us on allowances like adolescents.
If she ever got hold of that letter...
I can manage James, it's Mama that scares me.
She'd make my life a nightmare.
Do you?
Do I what?
Enjoy connubial bliss outside the bonds of holy matrimony?
That's an unusual question for you to ask.
That's my business.
The marriage hasn't worked for some years now.
Why don't you just break it off?
And do what?
And...
Where do you think this all came from?
It came from Pat Reavis.
Who's he?
He was the family chauffeur, till I fired him a few days ago.
That letter came in the mail the next morning.
Did you have a fling with him?
No, I did not have a fling with the family chauffeur.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to make him stop.
I do not want any more letters.
Don't know what to say.
I'll take a run at it.
Iris, why couldn't...?
Thank you.
Where do I find this Reavis fella?
Well, I don't know where he lives.
He used to work for Kilbourne Oil, maybe he's gone back there.
You shouldn't have any trouble finding that place.
Have you met my daughter?
Schuyler, this is Mr. Harper, he's...
Exterminator, Dixie Pest Control.
How do you do, Mr. Harper?
Sometimes I do better than others.
Well, I hope so.
Do we have a problem?
That's what I'm here to find out.
I generally start in the servants' quarters, you know...
...the cook, the maid, the chauffeur.
Oh, yes, the chauffeur used to live over the garage...
...it's right around there.
Exterminator?
Trust me.
Can I help you?
No, thanks, but I'll keep it in mind.
It's quite a zoo you got here.
Do you think you could introduce me to the head keeper?
Right on. Come on.
Thanks for not saying anything to Mother about the Town House.
How'd you know I'd even be there?
I heard her making a reservation.
You read your mama's mail too?
Why did she book a room for you?
I'm up from New Orleans, she didn't like the local.
- Oh, come on.
- No, no kidding. Pest control.
What are you really up here for?
Insurance.
What's Pat Reavis really like?
He was fun.
Mild psychopaths often are, if you don't cross them.
Like I said, you're a pretty bright kid.
I guess I have my daddy's genes.
Grandmother?
Grandmother?
This is Mr. Harper.
He's here to check over the house for pests.
Schuyler, you may bring me a glass of sherry.
Yes, Grandmother.
Ma'am, you got a zebra finch over there with a discolored beak.
You ought to wash it off in vinegar.
Stems from a protein deficiency.
A Mrs. "James Devereaux"...
...called our New Orleans representative and...
Mr. Harper, that is quite enough of that.
You can tell Mr. Kilbourne my answer is no...
...and will remain so for as long as I live.
Yes, ma'am. I'll be happy to.
Just tell me where I can find him.
Mr. Harper,
I can do without the charades.
Mr. Kilbourne is forever trying these tiresome tactics...
...and he's a rank amateur.
This'll come as something of a surprise, but I don't work for Mr. Kilbourne.
In fact, I don't even...
I don't even know him.
I detest you big oil company "yes" men.
- I'm not a "yes" company oil...
- Quiet.
You oil people have ruined our town.
Destroyed our parish.
I will not allow you to populate my land.
Go. Now leave my property.
And tell your employer,
Jay Hue Kilbourne...
...to go to hell!
Yes, ma'am.
I see what you mean.
She's a functioning ball-breaker.
Did you find anything?
Well, enough to get started.
Is that your friend from the French Quarter?
That's Peter. He's helping James with his creative endeavors.
Okay.
Well, where were we? L...
I found that old portable with the flaky E...
...but I hope this Reavis can be easily conned.
This ain't exactly heavy ammunition.
- Well, what else can you do?
- I don't know.
Try to find him and hit him with this in the hope it scares him off.
It ain't easy standing around talking shop with you.
No, I'm finding it difficult to adjust to the sight of you.
Were you angry when I left
Los Angeles so suddenly?
Would have been angry if it had never happened at all.
Iris, you are wearing my gardening hat again.
I would be so grateful, so everlastingly grateful...
...if, in future, you would ask my permission.
Yes, Mother.
I could kill that bitch.
Hey, excuse me!
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Sure.
I thought you might be interested in a little ride.
You know, around the city.
I don't think I got the time.
Right up front, I am required by law to advise you guys...
...that my hands are registered in the state of California as lethal weapons.
- You understand?
- Oh, really? Black belt, huh?
- You betcha.
- Glo, show him yours.
Well, that's a different ball game.
I was just... I was just kidding.
I'm a brown belt.
Where do you want me to sit?
- You want the front or the back?
- The back's fine.
Could you slide over there, tiger?
Anything you say, buddy.
Hey, Harper!
Step lightly on over here!
Sure glad you could see fit to come visit us.
Oh, no. I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
Jay Hue Kilbourne here.
Always a pleasure to welcome newcomers to our domain.
They're in training.
That one's ready.
I raised that little fella from a pup.
Matter of fact, he favors a nephew of mine.
Boy's features aren't regular.
Sort of pinched, with strange little ears.
Damn near broke my sister's heart.
I can imagine.
You know anything about pit bulls,
Mr. Harper?
We got regular straight-up teeth matches on weekends. Lot of big money wagered.
And illegal as hell.
How do you tell the winner?
Like anything else, only one sure way.
One of them is left alive.
I have fun, Mr. Harper, hell of a good time.
You see, I'm not like most folks who get their kicks head-on.
I sort of slide in sideways-like.
As a matter of fact, in high school...
...they used to call me "the Crab."
Now, you take the oil business, my business.
It's never any fun to drill straight down.
I'm a slant driller by instinct.
Are you slant-drilling me?
Very perceptive.
- You see those tide lands, Mr. Harper?
- Yeah.
- No, I mean, right... Right over there.
- No, I saw them.
Well, they're oil-rich.
And there's just no end to them.
Now, a good portion of them, I own.
But the biggest piece is right there and I don't have a thing to do with it.
But I aim to.
I sure enough aim to.
- Guess whose land...
- Olivia Devereaux.
Outstanding.
A hundred million dollars in black gold underneath that earth.
And do you know what she wants to do with that land, Mr. Harper?
She wants to turn it into a goddamn sanctuary for birds.
I think that's kind of sweet.
Well, now, look. L... I'm all for saving wildlife, like the next fella...
...but we gotta think about America's future.
Energy sources just aren't that easy to come by.
Did you come to that conclusion out of patriotism or just greed?
Little of both, Mr. Harper.
Like most men of wealth.
- I guess you know why I sent for you.
- I have...
Yeah, well, not here. Not here, boy.
Little privacy, huh?
Just preliminaries.
Preliminaries, that's all.
Now, tell me.
Why do you think I sent for you?
Can't say I know, but there are people who think that I work for you.
They been reading my mind.
Because that's exactly what I want you to do.
Work for me.
I don't think I could get used to it.
I think you'd learn to enjoy it.
I look at is this way, Mr. Harper:
Three people are involved, or should I say could be involved...
...with the title to that land.
Let's start with James.
It turns out, through some incredible good fortune...
...I've got a whole lot of embarrassing material...
The visual kind.
- That could be used...
...regarding James' unorthodox sexual persuasions.
Now, Iris is another story.
You a nice-Iooking young man. Oh, yeah.
And I hear tell that Iris...
Well, bless her heart.
- She likes to play around a little.
You could be most helpful with her.
It would mean a great deal to me.
And to you too.
Well, that still leaves Olivia, though, doesn't it?
That leaves Olivia.
But you got that figured out.
Can I go now?
Why, certainly. Hey, Candy...
...Mr. Harper's anxious to leave now.
Well, what about my proposal?
I'll give it a lot of consideration.
- I'm sure we'll be hearing from you soon.
- Jay Hue.
Outstanding.
Hey!
Drinks for everybody!
Hey, where's the action around here?
You're just kind of early, mister.
Place doesn't start jumping until about 9, man.
Here.
Would you like to try a coon-ass beer?
"Coon-ass"? Sure.
You know a guy by the name of Pat Reavis?
I might.
I understand he spends a lot of time here.
Is he a friend of yours or something?
Yeah, something.
I'm supposed to meet him.
Them guys that work in them rigs all day, they usually come in here late.
Things really picks up then.
Yeah, that's what Pat told me.
Yeah, man. Reavis really got himself a hot little chick there, man.
He told me that too.
What's-her-face, the hot one...
- Gress-shen, man.
- Gress-shen.
- Not just the face, the body, man.
- Gress-shen. Oh, you mean Gretchen.
That's what I said, man.
How you like that coon-ass beer?
It works.
I spotted your car.
You spotted my car?
Will it wash off? That's a rental.
Clown.
You're gonna come with me, clown.
Yeah? Who did I molest this time?
You better watch your mouth, mister.
- You're gonna push me too far.
- You know what I think, Franks?
I think this is just another roust.
I got no time to dance with you.
You hold it right there, old horse.
You all better stop right about there, Harper.
Harper!
- I got him, chief.
- You know...
...she's a nice dancer but her likes to lead.
Listen, clown. One of these days, you're gonna be sunny-side up.
Lieutenant, get on the air and get a fingerprint kit down here.
Yes, sir.
- How'd it go down?
- Pretty ugly.
Crushed her head with that rake and pushed her in.
- Any suspects?
- That's why I wanted to talk to you.
- You've been around here all day...
- Come on, now. I'm not on that list.
No. Unless you give me a reason.
You ever hear of Reavis, Pat Reavis?
What, the chauffeur?
I was trying to track him down when old bullet-head found me in the bar.
Yeah, we think he's running.
But tell me, what's your interest in Reavis?
- Let me talk to my client first.
- Oh, no, no.
Now, what do you think you are, a lawyer?
This is a homicide...
...and I wanna know about Reavis.
What's against him?
Well, for one thing, he was fired.
For another, we found his wallet on the lawn between here and the house.
And for another, he disappeared.
- That's all kind of convenient, isn't it?
- No.
I would like to talk to my client first.
Sure, sure, that's your right.
She's by the little house at the pool.
Harper, stick close by.
Don't be taking any trips.
Okay.
Never can get these things off.
Maybe you shouldn't try.
I'm sorry about Olivia.
Thank you.
That's a joke.
God, I loathed that woman.
Broussard's asking questions. He wants to know what I know about Reavis.
Want me to tell about the letter?
Dance around him with fancy footwork?
- What do you want?
- What difference does it make?
Let's talk about something else.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to make it like it was six years ago.
Your sense of timing always amazes me.
Oh, I get it. You're a name freak.
Don't spread that around!
Hey, you got any G's around here?
Any G's.
Jennifer!
- That's a J.
- You sure?
Well...
Gretchen! That's a G. G-R-E-T...
- Wait. Which one's she?
- Pink flower!
I better warn you, though.
She's a working girl.
- That's gonna cost you!
- I hope so!
I just love her. Just love her!
You gotta be kidding.
I mean, what's so sexy about names?
Well, probably nothing, but it just happened that way.
It was Gertrude, Gloria, Ginger and Gidget. And they was all 10's.
And another one coming.
I hope so.
Come on, dude, what's your story?
Pat said that you was the best cu...
One of the...
He said you was one of the...
I guess he just wanted me to say hello.
Pat Reavis?
Yeah, one in the same.
He's one hell of a fella.
No, he's not.
He just kind of turns me on.
Pat never told me about you.
Yeah, well, see,
I'm new on the rig down there.
He was gonna come up here and meet me...
...and was gonna introduce us.
Look, I owe him some money and he's...
Well, then he'll find you.
Why don't you take your shoes off and relax?
I think it's kind of early to...
Are...? Are you afraid to take your clothes off in front of women?
- I don't know that I'm afraid...
- Oh, don't... Don't worry about it.
You'd be surprised at some of the...
Well, what's your thing, what are you into?
I just like to try a little conversation first.
Oh, sure. You wanna call me dirty names?
I didn't say that.
You want me to call you dirty names?
No, I didn't say that either.
I don't know how people can dirty talk cold turkey.
I mean, l...
I gotta get a kind of run on it...
...or get some foreplay or...
You know what I mean?
I better get a refill.
Hey, this good old Pat, you seen him around lately?
Not since last weekend.
He's probably down at his place in New Orleans.
Oh, boy, he just must be raking it in.
I didn't know he had a place down in New Orleans.
Well, it's not a palace exactly...
...but it's in the Quarter, not too far from Jackson Square.
How about if I gave you a dirty word...
...and then you have to make up another one...
...starting with the last letter of the one I just gave you?
Now, wait a minute.
You're gonna give me a dirty word...
Hey, honey, that's awful complicated.
I don't think we're gonna get much action out of that.
Hey, say, you're kind of rushing it.
Jackson Square, that's a ritzy place.
Exactly... Exactly where does
Pat live around there?
I was only there once.
It's near that cute little hotel with the cornstalk fence.
Around in back.
- A room right off the main drag.
- Cool it, honey.
Thanks.
- Yeah?
- Did you ring, Mr. Reavis?
I've had your laundry here for a week.
Will you pick it up?
- Messages?
- Your sister, Elaine, called.
But that was three days ago.
Okay, thanks.
Elaine called.
- What does...?
- What you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Well, I was walking down the street...
It beats the shit out of me.
Okay, okay, let's take it from the top again.
Now, what you doing here?
Okay. Give it to you straight.
I'm a burglar, just like you.
I'll save you a lot of trouble.
Ain't nothing here.
Maybe he's telling the truth.
Take him with us.
Tie his hands and search him.
Oh, my.
It's not nice to look up ladies' dresses.
Well, everybody's gotta look someplace.
No Reavis, no account book, just this guy.
Lew Harper, Los Angeles.
Well, you're a long way from home, Lew.
I'm working my way down to Miami.
Well, just what were you looking for in that place?
An honest buck.
Did you find anything?
Like what? There was all junk in there.
Wouldn't even take it to a fence.
Like maybe an account book?
I don't follow account books very much, you know.
It's mostly appliances, watches, jewelry, things like that.
How's that grab you?
Oh, well, I mean, that's a beaut.
Yeah, it's pretty nice, wouldn't you say?
What do you mean, "nice"?
That would set me up for life in Palm Beach.
Well, now, Lew, honey, this wouldn't set you up for a week in Hoboken.
- It's a fake.
- Oh, no.
Yeah?
This has all been an unfortunate mistake, Lew.
Can you just forget it ever happened?
Hey, what's to forget?
You wouldn't throw me over for no little account book, now would you, sugar?
Oh, honey, that's no fair, my hands are tied.
That's just to protect you from self-abuse.
You don't abuse yourself, now, do you, sugar?
It would be such a waste.
Elaine Reavis, telephone.
Elaine Reavis, telephone.
No, honey.
See, that won't work either...
...because I gotta stay away from my apartment for a few days.
Listen, I always loved your place.
What's wrong with it now?
Yeah, that's the spirit.
Okay, I'll just pack my toothbrush and I'll see you after supper. Bye.
Hey, you got any food here?
I'm starving.
Just give me a minute to change.
I'll fix you something.
- Let the cat in.
- Yeah.
Little bonus here.
Stay where you are.
Hands up against the fireplace there.
Who do you work for?
The exterminator.
You don't have to count it.
There's $ 10,000 there.
Nice going, Elaine.
Who else did you bring back here?
- I didn't know. I didn't know.
- Okay, shut up.
- What did you do this time, Pat?
- Nothing.
Killed an old lady for hire, looks like.
That's bullshit, I didn't, I swear.
Hello, operator, give me the
Rivage Police Department. Yeah.
Name is Harper, it's an emergency, and I'll wait.
- I'm taking you in, Reavis.
- I didn't do it, man, you hear me?
I didn't kill that old lady.
How does a punk like you get $ 10,000?
Five-card draw, big time.
You never told me about that, Pat.
Hello, give me Broussard.
He isn't, who is this, Franks?
Can you handle a message...
...old hoss?
- You punk.
- I'm always holding you together.
- Been doing your work.
Talking about the dough you're raking in.
You'll take care of all of us.
- I'll bring him in.
- You're nothing.
- It'll take half the time.
- You're a hustler, a stud.
- You two...
- I've had it with you.
Girls, girls, girls.
Hey, listen, you may be some kind of hotshot policeman.
But I'm here to tell you you're out of your depth.
You're into something that's way over your head.
You drive.
Ten grand. That's nickel-and-dime.
What were you doing at the Devereauxs' yesterday?
I wasn't there. I was fired.
Reavis, I saw your car.
I didn't kill that old lady.
I didn't even know about it until I got back to town.
Oh, yeah, why didn't you go see the police?
You kidding?
Me against the Devereauxs?
One guess who gets the shaft.
You didn't answer my question.
Let me rephrase.
What were you doing at the Devereauxs' yesterday?
Schuyler and me were getting it on.
So, what's the big deal?
Kid's got a crush on me.
- That's why I was fired.
- Oh, yeah?
I thought it was because of a letter you wrote to Iris' husband.
What letter? I don't write letters.
All I know is that they stuck it to me good.
I don't chase women, buddy.
They chase me.
Yeah, boy, you certainly got them running after you.
How do you do that?
You got a special wrinkle?
Is it that kinky pad of yours with mirrors and everything?
- Creep. Shut your mouth.
- Wait a minute.
I'm filled with admiration.
Some guys just look good in the locker room.
Let's cut the crap, okay?
What do you want from me?
Money? There's plenty more of that coming.
And you could be in for a big piece.
- Half?
- Yeah, if you get off my back.
Yeah, but then we'd have to be friendly and go to the same restaurants... Nah.
What's the difference to you?
Come on, man, move over.
Get on the shoulder.
What? There's nothing but a swamp.
Didn't I tell you, big time?
Not your territory.
We want Reavis.
He's my prisoner and
I'm bringing him in with me.
- You never got a message?
- Nothing on the blotter...
...except a common drunk and a grand-theft auto. That's all.
Maybe you called the wrong police department.
Well, if I did, Franks was on the other end of that telephone.
Where is old bullet-head?
Well, I was told sick leave.
Something about a hunting accident.
Be out the rest of the week at least.
Oh, at least.
I bet he's got a sling on his right arm too.
What are you trying to say?
You making some kind of charge?
Who do you think would want to kill Reavis?
Oh, lot of people, lot of people.
Olivia Devereaux was highly respected in this community...
...no matter what her family thought about her.
She was the leader of a certain lifestyle, a certain order...
...which a lot of folk here took comfort in.
So all those blue-haired ladies from the bridge club...
...just went down and bumped off big, bad Pat.
That's your privilege to think what you like.
Look, Harper, the Devereauxs have been through a lot.
I'd just as soon put a lid on the whole thing.
I don't want Iris to get hurt, or Schuyler.
I'm just worried about my batting average.
What about it?
Well, first my client's mother-in-law gets it...
...then her daughter's boyfriend.
You got it wrong.
Schuyler had nothing to do with Pat Reavis.
Come on, Broussard, you babysit that girl.
You telling me you don't know?
You know, for a fast 150 a day, you sure do a lot of speculating.
The way you've been chasing after that teenybopper...
...I think you want to ball her yourself.
One more of those and I'll knock you right through the wall. You hear me?
Now, as far as I'm concerned, this case is closed.
Who would want to do a thing like that?
I got no answers.
I believed you last time and look where it got Pat.
You're a cop, aren't you?
Well, I'm a second cousin,
I'm a private.
Bastard. I let you soft-soap me into telling you where Pat lived...
...and now he's dead.
You're a hell of a guy, you know that?
You betcha. All I was trying to do was keep him alive.
- So justice could triumph, no doubt.
- Hey, hey.
I got no idea what justice is.
I am interested in truth, though.
That's a laugh.
All right, not the big, philosophical stuff.
The everyday things, like who, why, when, where.
I'll tell you what. I'm interested in why Pat Reavis was killed.
And I'm interested in why
I got roughed up...
...for something that was supposed to be hidden in his place in the Quarter.
An account book.
You want me to try to find out who killed him?
- What good is that gonna do him?
- Oh, no good at all.
Except I think he'd understand.
Well, what makes you so sure that
I have the account book?
Because it wasn't where it was supposed to be.
And I think you're the only person he trusts.
I don't know why I should help you.
I don't know why I should even listen to you.
Hey, don't.
- Got a beer?
- Help yourself.
Thanks.
Do you got any idea what you got here?
He told me just to keep it for him, not to look in it.
Well, let me tell you something.
Old Jay Hue Kilbourne kicked back to a lot of lawmakers...
...to get those oil leases of his.
Oh, boy, could this make justice triumph.
Keep it for me, will you?
Help me out, okay?
How would you like to help me put on some suntan lotion?
Wouldn't help, honey, you're gonna be burnt out by the time you're 30.
I'm looking for your mama.
She's down at the bayou.
Thought private eyes only read mystery stories.
Who told you I was a private eye?
Mr. Harper.
Did you tell her?
I got pretty tired of seeing you hanging around, Harper...
...so Iris explained to me about that stupid note the chauffeur wrote.
Like it was something
I'd give a damn about.
I told her to get you the hell out.
I'm sure she'll want to say goodbye.
Well, what do you know.
I think I've just been fired.
Oh, really? By whom?
The master of the house.
Well, that's nice. That's the first positive action he's taken in years.
He can't fire me, I've ruined a perfectly good suit.
And I've run up 800 bucks in expenses.
You are incredible, Lew.
You have a problem.
You have no talent for surrender.
Yeah.
I guess I got this wild, selfish streak in me.
I'm gonna be sued by that rent-a-car company too, you know.
Go away.
Why don't you learn to give up things gracefully?
I can't.
I know who wrote that letter.
Schuyler.
What makes you think that?
It's right out of her schoolbook.
Reavis was a functioning illiterate, for chrissake.
She had him sounding like a
17th-century lyric poet.
You're lying. Why do you think she'd do that?
I don't think you know a lot about your daughter, Iris.
What are you trying to do to me?
What is she trying to do to you?
Pat Reavis was killed.
The question is, who killed him and why?
Things are getting pretty ugly around here.
I don't much care for it, but fired of not,
I'm gonna stick it through to the end.
And people may not like everything I find, you understand?
Doesn't really matter.
How was your vacation, Franks?
Christ!
I understand you had an unfortunate hunting accident.
You know that you assaulted a police officer?
Not important.
I don't think Broussard likes you anymore.
Where's your Mardi gras mask?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I ain't got no time to mess around.
Let's start from the top.
How much did Kilbourne pay you to kill Reavis?
You're not gonna pull that trigger.
You big-city boys are up to your ass in rules.
Oh, boy.
All right, I got two live ones in there.
- Bull.
- Bull, what?
You got nothing in there.
One more to go.
Now, let's start from the top.
How much did Kilbourne pay you?
Look, I don't have to say nothing.
I know my rights and the Miranda decision...
- Two.
- Goddamn.
Goddamn it, are you crazy?
Right. Want to play again?
Kilbourne always pays me a little something...
...whenever he needs a favor done.
How much did he pay you to kill Reavis?
No, I'll have my ass in a sling if...
- Three.
- You son of a bitch, it was $5000.
- Goddamn.
- Why did he want him dead?
- I don't know.
- Four.
I don't know. I swear to the
Almighty, I don't know, honest.
Come on, you turkey, why did he want him dead?
Because he paid Reavis to kill old lady Devereaux?
I don't know. I don't know!
- Five!
- Sweet screaming Jesus, I don't know!
I swear to the Almighty, I don't know!
I don't much care for it...
...but I guess I gotta believe you.
Christ.
Personally, I think you held up rather well.
Hoboquad! Desalles!
It's okay, good boy.
All I gotta do is say the magic word and you're dog food.
Let him aboard, Candy.
Hello, Mr. Harper, I've been hoping to see you.
Some tub you got here, Jay Hue.
Just one of my fun fleet.
Please don't think I'm inhospitable.
Nothing but vandals everywhere.
Those puppy dogs sure cut my insurance rates.
Come on inside.
I don't believe you've met my wife.
Can't say that I have.
Mavis, darling, this is Mr. Harper.
How do you do, Mr. Harper?
Some days I do better than other days.
Mavis, want to go for a walk?
How long a walk, darling?
Why I don't know, May-May, average.
Just average.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Harper.
Sweet child. Sit down, Mr. Harper.
One of my other passions. Cooking.
This is Shrimp Etouffée.
Local favorite, but my version.
Could I get you a drink?
Yeah, a little of that Glenlivet might hit the spot.
Outstanding. A man who knows his liquor.
Free pour.
I've got this bad old stomach and
I can't touch a thing but cereals.
Well, what do you do with all the food?
I dump it overboard, of course.
Fish seem to enjoy it immensely.
You want a taste?
Not this trip, no.
It's just as well.
It needs to sit a bit.
Can the fish really tell?
I expect they can't.
Now, what can I do for you, Mr. Harper?
The Devereaux oil lease.
I'd like a pretty big chunk of that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Harper, along with my bad old stomach...
...I'm having trouble with my hearing lately.
Well, Jay Hue, we can be friends.
Reavis showed me the 10 grand you paid him to kill old lady Devereaux.
I'm afraid Reavis is dead, Mr. Harper.
Yeah, that he is, that he is.
But Franks ain't.
And he told me about the 5 grand that you paid him to kill Reavis.
I think that's kind of neat.
Not many people...
...can afford to hire a killer and then hire a cop to kill him.
I hate to be a spoilsport,
Mr. Harper...
...you doing all that good figuring...
...but I did not hire Reavis to kill Olivia Devereaux.
He was in your employ.
You bought him when he was the Devereaux chauffeur.
He was my spy. An industrial spy.
Happens all the time, just good business.
When Reavis hit me with that first installment of $ 10,000...
...to keep quiet about a murder I had absolutely nothing to do with...
...tried to implicate me in it...
...well, let's just say
I was not unhappy...
...when he met with that most unfortunate accident.
I ran a check on you, Mr. Harper.
You are not stupid.
I have my moments.
You want to live, don't you?
To a ripe old age?
I'd hate to think that I was making those social security payments for nothing.
Then you better do like I say.
Because I hold all the aces.
I'm not so sure about that, Jay Hue.
You missing an account book.
Now, how the hell did you get that?
Just doing my job.
You got guts, Harper, coming in here like this.
Not really, Jay Hue. So long as I stay alive and healthy...
...it stays tucked away and out of sight.
Hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
Harper.
Two hundred and fifty thousand...
...that's my last offer.
- No deal.
- Harper, are you listening?
- Nice talking to you, Jay Hue.
Harper!
Hey, that's a quarter of a million dollars!
You crazy, boy?
Harper?
We gotta stop meeting like this, people will start talking.
He had Pat Reavis killed for that account book.
No kidding.
It won't take him long before he works out the rest of it.
The rest being that you gave Reavis the account book to begin with.
And then what? A little long-distance blackmail from Acapulco?
Harper, I have to get away from Jay Hue.
He's crazy. I mean...
I mean, he's really crazy.
I hadn't noticed. Thanks for the tip.
- I'll be especially careful.
- Harper, this isn't fun and games!
He'll do anything to get that book.
- You gotta take me with you.
- No way.
I gave up self-abuse...
...in high school.
Okay, I deserve that.
I'll owe you one.
You pick the time and place, but he'll hurt me.
I mean, he'll really hurt me this time.
Please?
Wait in my car,
I gotta make a phone call.
Iris, you awake?
Who is this?
It's California, I'm just checking in.
What do you want?
I just wanted to say I don't think Reavis killed the old lady.
Well, you're wrong.
Now, I don't care if that man is dead...
...you find a way and you prove that he did it.
Are you on the bottle?
I'm telling you, Reavis isn 't the guy.
Why don't you just drop it, Lew.
Just get off the case...
...and leave me alone.
Hey, what the hell is happening out...?
Get out of here and get out of my life.
I don't want you rummaging around in my closets anymore.
It's a juggling act just to make my life work.
Try to get some sleep, will you?
Lew, don't hang up.
Listen to me...
I can't handle the responsibility.
Iris?
Now, listen, you turn on the television, I'll be right over.
No.
Don't do that.
I'll mail you your money.
Just go away.
Iris?
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!
Outstanding.
You know, the patients used to pay a fortune for this, Mr. Harper.
Sometimes, it would even restore their memory.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're loony as a fruitcake, you know that?
I'm gonna make believe
I didn't hear that.
Doctor.
Stop!
You'll kill him, you...!
You can scream.
Scream all you like, darling.
This place has been out of business for years.
It's soundproofed anyways.
Do you remember what
I told you, Mr. Harper?
About my crab-like ways?
Now, you can save yourself a whole lot of unnecessary excitement...
...if you just tell me where that little book is.
Candy, this man is sorely trying my patience.
Maybe you need time to reflect on it, Mr. Harper.
Gonna be a long, hard night.
Cold, wet, nasty.
Mighty uncomfortable.
But we'll be back bright and early tomorrow.
By then, I think you'll want to tell me where that book is.
And don't you go away now.
Y'all take care.
You okay?
Son of a bitch tried to kill me.
Well, he's coming back in the morning for seconds.
Could you get me out of this?
I can try.
Oh, shit. I'm gonna break my nails.
Why don't you give him that stupid account book so we can get out of here?
Honey, there ain't no way he's gonna let us out of here.
Jay Hue. Jay Hue!
Jay Hue!
Jay Hue!
No. Easy, easy. Easy!
Oh, no! No!
No! My God!
I don't know why I ever married the crazy son of a bitch.
I was always afraid of him.
He was such a freak.
Him and his damn oil.
He never gave me anything but this crab.
Look at this, look at this crab.
I don't have one real thing.
Not one real diamond. Look at this.
Just rhinestones.
I got a whole drawer full of rhinestones.
Take off your clothes.
I don't think that's very funny.
I said, take off your clothes!
You mind telling what you have in mind?
We're gonna go right out through there.
Come on. Get on it, will you?
Harper, you sure you know what you're doing, honey?
Well, all we can do now is wait.
How did Jay Hue wind up with a place like this anyway?
His sweet mama sent him here for the cure.
He didn't like the way he was treated...
...so he bought it up and closed them down.
Harper, is any of this gonna work?
I don't know. If it doesn't, we're in a lot of trouble.
It'll be a little while longer.
Can you hold on?
Yeah, I think.
I can't get a grip on the goddamn thing.
What do you mean?
Christ, we'll never get it open now.
What do we do now?
I'll probably have to go down and see if I can get...
Let's see if I can break out of this skylight.
Harder!
Harder!
It won't break!
The water's getting higher!
I can't break it.
Give me that thing.
I'm gonna see if I can clear the drain.
I'll break this thing. I'll break it!
I'll break it! I'll break it!
I'll break it!
No, I dropped it.
I dropped it.
I can't clear out that drain.
There's too much suction.
I gotta get my breath.
I gotta try to turn off some water.
Give me a hand.
No! No, I'm not going down there!
- Come on.
- I'll drown down there.
I'll die down there! I'll die! I'll die!
- I'm going down myself.
- No.
I don't wanna die in here!
- Couldn't do it.
- No.
- Couldn't do it.
- No.
We're gonna die.
Oh, Mama.
What a dumb way to die.
Candy...
...I forgot my Gelusil tablets.
You leave them in the car?
I could have.
I keep a spare in the glove compartment anyways.
You want me to go fetch it?
Well...
Oh, to hell with it.
Oh, God!
You okay?
Boy, that's one
I wouldn't wanna try again.
Let's get out of here before Jay Hue gets back.
I can't even get up.
I don't want you to.
I'm leaving you for Broussard this time.
You understand?
It'll never stick, Harper.
Watch him. I gotta find a phone.
May-May?
Wanna kiss and make up?
What the hell did you...?
He's right.
He would've gotten away with it.
Well, maybe you can plead self-defense.
Cry a lot. Throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
Dead.
Dead.
Oh, God.
When did it happen?
Sometime last night.
What are you doing here? I fired you.
This is my house. You get the hell out.
Don't waste your energy on form, pal.
You're in real trouble.
Trouble?
Everyone knows she was... She was always fond of Seconal and liquor.
This was no accident. That's a logical assumption, isn't it, Mr. Harper?
Beats me. Who found her?
Schuyler found her this morning and called me.
- Schuyler, where is she?
- They were quite fond of one another.
- Touching.
- Get him out of here!
Come on. Come on!
What the hell am I doing with these?
She tell you about us?
She didn't have to.
Oh, God, what a mistake I made.
I should have taken her away from here a long time ago.
I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go. I was just a kid.
She was from the finest family.
Seventeen years ago, things were a lot different.
I'm...
I'm so tired.
I'm so tired.
So goddamn tired.
Giving Grandma's birds a holiday, huh?
Why not? They can go anywhere they want now.
That's a bad move.
They won't make it out there.
Tough.
The old lady was a lot nicer to birds than she was to people, huh?
That's right, California.
Schuyler, I got all the big stuff figured.
But it's tying up those tiny little loose ends that's driving me up the wall.
I know about you and Reavis.
I saw you skulking around the bushes.
- And I saw his car.
- So what?
You're right, not relevant.
Well, what I was getting at...
You know, as bad a frame job as it was...
See? Loose end.
- How did you manage to lift Reavis' wallet?
You're making it up anyway.
Use your imagination.
What do you mean? Wha...?
While you were doing it with him?
Hey, that's pretty neat.
All that passion and light-fingered at the same time.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Strong.
Can't believe how strong you are.
Must come from that swimming.
Now, what did you hit that sweet old lady so hard for?
You're not a messy kid, are you, or did you just get carried away?
Let go of me.
Next thing: Iris.
I figured a while back that you wrote the letter.
But that was just the kickoff.
- What was the whole game plan?
- Shut up!
Hey, you heard Iris and me on the phone last night.
She was pretty low.
I know you heard us because after she hung up, there was a second click.
Click goes the phone, you go to her room.
Wait a minute, don't get me wrong.
I know you didn't shove those sleeping pills down her throat.
But you sure fixed it so she'd do the job for you, didn't you?
I don't have to listen to any of this.
Another loose end.
What did you tell her, huh?
About all those kinky things you had going with Reavis?
Or maybe described how you killed the old lady. Or worse.
Maybe you told her how miserable you were gonna make the rest of her life.
They really did a job on him!
Who? Your dad?
I hated her!
I hated both of those bitches!
And you got rid of both of them so you could have Daddy all to yourself?
Like I said, you're a pretty bright kid.
But what are you gonna do with all that information?
Nobody's gonna believe you.
Well...
It's a funny thing about the law, kid.
Most of the time, they're not around when you need them.
But there is a first time for everything.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
- I hate you!
- No.
Why did you stir this up?
Why? Tell me, why?
Why? Why? Why?
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!
Oh, no.
I named her.
I gave her that name.
She's so pretty.
I wanted her to have everything good in life.
Everything good.
That's your kid out there.
How you gonna handle that?
I wouldn't be in your shoes for anything.
Good luck.
Yeah, same to you.
Anybody home?
I'm out back!
Well, hello. What brings you back?
I didn't wanna leave without...
Pat wanted me to give you something.
Just before he died, he said that he really dug you.
Pat socked a little away. He wanted you to have all of it. Here it is.
Ninety-two hundred bucks.
And, you know, the usual message:
Don't spend it all in one spot.
I'll see you, Gret.
What about the account book?
You want it or what?
Forget it.
No, wait. You take that goddamn account book...
...and send it to the biggest newspaper in New Orleans. You got that?
That's outstanding.
Hey.
I wish you'd stay a while.
Gretchen, I got a plane to catch.
Harper?
You're not such a tough guy.

I want to go over to my place and start, you know, getting it on,
'cause I'm just tired of this all.
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Yeah.
Did you ever take ballet?
Weak ankles.
Do you have a quarter for them?
Yes, I do.
Well, what about me?
You'll see.
A lot of fun you are.
You're supposed to tease me, give me hints, make me guess, you know.
Oh, look. That's terrible.
He's not hurting anyone.
Neither are we.
Oh, God.
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.
What do you think?
I always think that he was once somebody's baby boy.
Really, I do.
I think he was once somebody's baby boy,
and he had a mother and a father who loved him.
And now there he is, half-dead on a park bench,
and where are his mother or his father, all his uncles now?
Anyway, that's what I always think.
How's he doing up there?
I always think how, when they had the newspaper strike...
We're getting better than 40%.
How about the second position?
It's not so good.
What have we here?
Okay, come on, you little babies, now, wet your lips there.
All right, give me some tongue.
Just give me a little tongue there.
Come on.
Come on, just a little tongue outside.
Nice, wet French kiss now.
Come on, a nice wet one there.
Come on, come on.
Pay attention to your recordings.
She's coming in loud and clear.
Look, Mark. Do you see him?
The man with the hearing aid like Charles?
- No. Where?
- Right there, with the shopping bag.
Well, that's it for Paul.
They spotted him.
Give me the phones.
He's been following us all around, and he's following us close.
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
We're spending too much time together here.
No. Let's stay just a little longer.
I got burned, Harry.
- Yeah.
- She looked at me.
Yeah, yeah, I know. We heard.
Oh, did we hear.
What do you think?
I got some good pieces, maybe 25%.
Oh, yeah?
Listen, Paul, I'll call you in a couple of days if I need you again, okay?
Hey, Paul, you going to the convention tomorrow?
You bet.
Hey, how about you, Harry?
Yeah. Maybe.
Little party like we did two years ago, huh?
Hey, Stan?
- I'll see.
- Okay.
Here.
He's a nice guy for a cop.
You go.
I'll stay here a while.
Who's interested in these two anyway?
I don't know for sure.
- The Justice Department?
- No.
I figure it must be the Infernal Revenue.
Their tapes always put me to sleep.
Since when are you here to be entertained? Here.
Sometimes it's nice to know what they're talking about.
I don't care what they're talking about.
All I want is a nice, fat recording.
Hello, Mr. Caul.
And happy birthday!
Happy birthday, Harry.
Happy birthday.
Hello.
Hello, Miss Evangelista?
Yes. This is Harry Caul from upstairs.
Yes. Well...
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Yes, well, you're really very nice.
Yes.
But...
I know...
Yes, I found it. Yes.
But what I wanted to talk to you about was, how did you put it in the apartment?
Right.
Well, what about the alarm?
Oh, you did?
Well, yes, I thought I had the only key.
Well, what emergency could possibly...
All right. Yes.
Well, see, I would be perfectly happy to have all my personal things burned up in a fire because I don't have anything personal.
Nothing of value.
No. Nothing personal except my keys, you see.
Yes. Which I really would like to have the only copy of, Miss Evangelista.
Miss Evangelista, how'd you know it was my birthday?
I don't remember telling you.
Would you like to take a guess how old I am?
Forty-four. Well, that's a very good guess.
Miss Evangelista, as of today, my mail will go to a post office box with a combination on it and no keys.
Good-bye.
Hey, Harry.
Morning.
Hey, man, there's an article in here about the convention.
- It mentions your name.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah. You're one of the notables who's going tomorrow night, did you know that?
Yeah. I told them I'd be there.
Listen to this here.
Listen.
"Among those pre-eminent in the field expected to attend
"are Hal Lipsett and Harry Caul from San Francisco.
"Kenneth Sperry will speak on Surveillance and The Law."
Wait a minute. Listen to this.
Where the hell is it?
"Also attending will be
William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan."
Since when did
William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan, become pre-eminent in the field?
Oh, he's very big there.
You want some coffee?
He's the guy that told Chrysler that Cadillac was getting rid of its fins.
It was a while ago, but it was a big thing at the time.

What do you think?
I don't know what I'm going to get him for Christmas yet.
He's already got everything.
He doesn't need anything anymore.
Well, I haven't decided what I'm going to get you yet.
...get him for Christmas yet.
He's already got everything.
He doesn't need anything anymore.
Well, I haven't decided what I'm going to get you yet.
Well, you better start looking.
Well, what about me?
You'll see.
A lot of fun you are.
You're supposed to tease me, give me hints, make me guess, you know.
Does it bother you?
- What?
- Walking around in circles.
Oh, look. That's terrible.
He's not hurting anyone.
Neither are we.
Oh, God.
Every time I see one of those old guys...
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.
What do you think?
I always think that he was once somebody's baby boy.
No, really, I do.
I think he was once somebody's baby boy,
and he had a mother and a father who loved him.
And now there he is, half-dead on a park bench,
and where are his mother or his father, all his uncles now?
Anyway, that's what I always think.
I always think how, when they had the newspaper strike in New York,
more of those old guys died.
Fifty of them froze to death in one night.
Good afternoon. May I help you?
Yes. Extension 746, please.
One moment, please.
Director's office.
Yes, this is Mr. Caul.
I have the material and I'm calling for an appointment.
I'm sorry.
The director has already left for the day.
We'll call you back tomorrow morning.
May I have your telephone number, please?
No, I'm at a pay phone, and I don't have a home telephone.
Hold on one moment, please.
- Mr. Caul?
- Yes?
2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
2:30 in the afternoon?
Is that payment in full?
Whatever was arranged.
Thank you very much. I'll be there.
- Harry?
- Hello, Amy.
I didn't think you were coming.
I brought some wine someone gave me as a birthday present.
I didn't know it was your birthday.
- Do you want some?
- Yeah.
I do.
How old are you, Harry?
Forty-two.
Sweet.
Does something special happen between us on your birthday?
Like what?
Something personal.
Like what?
Like telling me about yourself, your secrets.
I don't have any secrets.
I'm your secret.
You do have secrets, Harry.
I know you do.
No.
Sometimes you come over here, and you don't tell me.
Once I saw you up by the staircase, hiding, watching, for a whole hour.
You think you're going to catch me at something.
You know? I know.
A woman can always tell.
You have a certain way of opening up the door.
You know, first the key goes in real quiet, and then the door comes open real fast, just like you think you're gonna catch me at something.
Sometimes I even think you're listening to me when I'm talking on the telephone.
What are you talking about?
I don't know. I just feel it.
Really, I do.
Why are you singing that?
It's pretty.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
It's just that somebody else was singing that today.
- A girl?
- Yes.
- Who is she?
- No, no. It isn't...
- I'm jealous.
- No.
Just somebody at work, and she...
She reminded me of you.
Where do you work, Harry?
Oh, different places, different jobs, you know?
I'm kind of a musician, you see.
Freelance musician and...
Where do you live?
I mean, why can't I call you over there?
'Cause I don't have a telephone.
Do you live alone?
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Because it's your birthday.
I don't want people asking me a lot of questions.
I want to know you.
Yes, I live alone.
I don't feel like answering any more questions.
Your rent is due.
Here's the money for it.
You never used to ask a lot of questions.
Harry, I was so happy when you came over tonight.
When I heard you open up the door, my toes were dancing under the covers.
But I don't think
I'm going to wait for you anymore.
- I have a package for the director.
- All right. I'll take it.
No. I'm supposed to hand it to him personally.
I have an appointment.
- Are you Mr. Caul?
- Yes, I am.
A Mr. Caul is here. All right.
Make yourself comfortable.
The director's assistant will be right down.
There are some nice Christmas cookies there I made.
You want one?
- They're good.
- No, thanks. I...
- What do you see?
- Oh, not much.
Here's your money, $15,000 cash, as you asked.
And these are our tapes?
I had an arrangement with the director.
I was to give those to him, you see, personally.
I understand.
But he's not here this afternoon.
As a matter of fact, he's out of the country.
And he asked me to get the tapes from you and give you the money.
I guess I can just wait on this.
Now, look, don't get involved in this, Mr. Caul.
Those tapes are dangerous.
You heard them. You know what I mean.
Someone may get hurt.
Mr. Caul, be careful.
Well, what about me?
You'll see.
A lot of fun you are.
Who started this conversation anyhow?
You did.
I did not.
Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.
Pretend like I just told you a joke.
Does it bother you?
- What?
- Walking around in circles.
Oh, look. That's terrible.
He's not hurting anyone.
Neither are we.
Oh, God.
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.
What do you think?
Yeah, what do you think?
I always think that he was once some...
Hey, Harry, what do you say we take a break?
Come on. We'll go to Al's Transbay.
I'll buy you a beer, huh?
- How about that?
- No. I want to finish this.
I thought you turned those tapes in.
Stan, be quiet, will you?
All right, all right.
Do you think we can do this?
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.
What a stupid conversation.
Stan, please. I'm trying to work.
I'm tired of mostly everything.
Tired of me?
Tired of you, but not today.
What the hell they talking about, for Christ's sake?
Stanley, please, I'm trying to get this done.
All right. Don't get excited.
Well, I'm getting fed up.
About what?
About your asking me questions all day long.
Jesus.
Don't say that.
Well, for Christ's sake...
Stan, don't say that again, please.
Don't use that word in vain.
It bothers me.
What's the matter, Harry?
Your work's getting sloppy.
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.
Sunday, definitely.
We'd have a much better track if you'd paid more attention to the recording and less attention to what they were talking about.
I can't see why a couple of questions about what the hell is going on can get you so out of joint.
'Cause I can't sit here and explain the personal problems of my clients.
Jack Tar Hotel.
3:00.
Room 773.
It wouldn't hurt if you filled me in a little bit once in a while.
Did you ever think of that?
It has nothing to do with me, and even less to do with you.
It's curiosity. Did you ever hear of that?
It's just goddamn human nature.
Listen, if there's one sure-fire rule that I have learned in this business is that
I don't know anything about human nature.
I don't know anything about curiosity.
That's not part of what I do. What I...
This is my business, and when I'm...
I'll see you later.
I think he's been recording my telephone.
I love you.
We're spending too much time together here.
No. Let's stay just a little longer.
I think he's been recording my telephone.
He'd kill us if he got the chance.
He'd kill us if he got the chance.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been three months since my last confession.
I...
These are my sins.
I've taken the Lord's name in vain on several occasions.
I...
On a number of occasions,
I've taken newspapers from the racks without paying for them.
I... have deliberately taken pleasure in impure thoughts, and
I've been involved in some work that I think will be used to hurt these two young people.
It's happened to me before.
People were hurt because of my work.
I'm afraid it could happen again, and I was in no way responsible.
I'm not responsible.
For these and all my sins of my past life,
I am heartily sorry.
Hi. Can I help you?
- Well, you could explain your system to me.
- Okay, Mr. Caul, I'm Jim Storey.
- How do you do?
- Come in and take a look here at the system.
This is for the surveillance of telephone communication systems.
I see.
...now available.
Here's the new LT 500.
If you're in surveillance, you belong into the LT 500.
You can hear your sounds here and know exactly which door has been violated.
I see.
And you got your local alarms on the doors, which I'm sure you've heard.
It's quite noisy.
It has a Super 8mm camera in here, and the dot right here, the 10:00 dot, will show exactly what the camera sees on the back.
It's a magazine-loaded camera,
Super 8mm...
William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan,
house courtesy telephone, please.
That's your automatic recorder actuator.
It undetectably starts the recorder when the phone is lifted and shuts it off when the receiver is put back.
- What?
- It's real nice, you know.
It's not your old-fashioned voice actuator, you know, always starting the recorder when nobody was talking or shutting it off in the middle of an important conversation.
Is it anything like the Moran actuator?
The Moran E-27 is a copy.
I won't let him even smell my equipment anymore.
- You in surveillance?
- Yeah.
Law enforcement or private operator?
Private.
You mind if I take your name and address for our mailing list?
Harry... Harry Caul?
I didn't recognize you.
Say, I wonder, would you take a Model 510-A?
Free of charge. Just to test it.
You know, say, in return for that we can print in our flier that you use it.
I build all my own equipment. Thank you.
Maybe we could take a picture of you holding it?
Or take a picture of you in front of our booth?
It would be a great honor for Spectre.
This is not helping crime.
It's helping justice.
...that may be affixed to the subject's automobile...
Slide. and will transmit a pulsating tone signal...
Slide. which is highly detectable...
Harry, good to see you.
- Beautiful suit.
- You like it? It's French.
Oh.
Let's go get a drink and talk.
Requiring no knowledge or skill in electronics.
Come on, it's a bore.
The TA-30 may be installed and concealed under the dash in a matter of seconds.
Hey, come on, there's somebody over here
I want you to meet, a competitor of yours.
- Hey, Bernie, old buddy.
- Yeah, Paulie, what's up?
This is Harry Caul. William P. Moran.
Harry Caul, my pleasure.
My friends call me Bernie.
I heard a lot about you, Harry.
- Thank you.
- Bernie just moved in from Detroit.
He's the fellow that let Chrysler know that Cadillac was discontinuing its fins.
That's right. I heard.
Harry Caul, you're a tough man to get a hold of.
I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time.
Hey, can you take five?
We'll get a drink.
Yeah. Maybe in a couple of...
Honey... Honey, sweetheart, show time, all right?
I'd appreciate it if you stuck around for the demonstration, Harry.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is the Moran S-15 harmonica tap.
This electronic marvel can be installed in a matter of two minutes.
Notice here it has its own nickel cadmium power source, so it cannot be detected on the line.
Once installed, it can be phoned from any telephone in the world,
Singapore, Karachi, even Moscow.
I say Moscow 'cause you look a little Russian there, sir, with the beard.
You just dial the target's phone number, pause before the last digit, blow the harmonica tone into the phone, press the last digit.
The phone will not ring in the target's house.
Instead, the receiver will be turned into an actual room microphone, thus enabling surveillance to take place.
And now, by way of an actual demonstration, we've installed one of these units in my very own home.
I will now dial that number.
Thank you.
I pause before the last digit.
Harmonica.
I dial the last digit.
You will note the phone does not ring.
Can we get away?
I don't know. Maybe I can.
Where's your husband?
He's out at a convention.
When will he be back?
Not until late.
April fool! Just a little joke, folks.
- That shows you the possibilities...
- Larry Peterson...
- of the Moran S-15.
- Larry Peterson Burns.
Thank you.
The demonstration is concluded.
I'd like you to take a little literature with you on your way.
Well, what did you think of that?
How did you like it?
It's a good item.
It's good for the catalogue suckers, huh?
Here you go, Harry.
Have a free pen.
You, too, Paulie.
- I'd rather have a free drink.
- Hey, me, too.
Stanley! Stanley, do me a favor, huh?
Come on. Mind the booth, all right?
Come on. That's what I pay you for.
Just a couple of minutes.
I just wanna get a drink, all right?
Hi, Harry.
Hi, Stan.
That's right.
You two used to work together, huh?
You see that son of a bitch sitting there?
He stole my latest idea...
A lot of nice ladies around here tonight.
Say, how about that pastry in the yellow?
She come across?
Come on. Forget it. She's a part-time nun.
We'll get supper...
Hey, Harry, where you going?
You guys go on without me.
I'm going to talk to Stan.
We'll meet you later at the chrome-dome exhibit.
Don't be long, huh, Harry.
Come on.
Since when are you working for Moran, Stanley?
Since yesterday.
Listen, that wasn't serious.
That was just a stupid argument.
That wasn't it, Harry.
It's just that
I figured it was time I move up, that's all.
No... Stan,
I don't want you telling him about any of my things.
It's not ethical.
There's not all that much you ever let me in on, Harry.
Maybe that's the problem.
Okay. All right. I'll bring you along faster.
I'll show you some of the stuff.
You won't show me anything.
You'll keep it all to yourself.
You know damn well you will.
No, really, Stan, wait a while.
Will you think about it?
Don't do this to me now.
Some guy's following me.
Who?
I don't know.
It has something to do with the assignment last week.
I don't know what it's about, but I don't like it.
Okay, all right.
Okay. Thanks, Stan.
This is junk.
I'm sorry, but you have reached a disconnected number.
Will you please make sure you...
Information.
The number for Amy Fredericks, please.
It's a new listing.
One moment, please.
Sir, I see no listing for an Amy Fredericks.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Take it easy. I'm just a messenger.
I brought you a drink.
I don't want your drink.
Why are you following me?
I'm not following you.
I'm looking for you.
There's a big difference.
How did you know I was here?
It's a convention of wire-tappers, isn't it?
Oh, excuse me, surveillance and security technicians.
It was a snap.
Look, I'm telling you, I'm not giving those tapes to anybody but the director.
Yeah, I know what you told me, Mr. Caul.
All right, what's the message?
We want you to deliver the tapes on Sunday, 1:00.
The director will be there.
He'll accept the tapes from you, in person.
You tell him I'll think about it.
- Hey, Paulie!
- Come on! Come on, let's go!
Lurleen and Millard, get in the back there.
And, Stanley, get in front!
Hey, come on, Harry.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Come on. I'm trying to dress up for the bar.
Hey, Bernie, it's a come-as-you-are party.
Hey, no, no! Wait a minute!
All the girls up front!
I think you take a right somewhere around here.
Sons of bitches! Those smartasses!
Who the hell do they think they're tangling with?
All right! Easy, easy!
Come on. We're going to have a party.
He could drive, man.
Millard, make them stop.
Relax, honey.
Paul's the best tail man in the country.
Hey, Meredith, do you hear that?
Headquarters 111, I'm driving east on Lombard.
I'd like a rolling 10-28 on California 5-6-0,
Boy Adam Lincoln.
What are you calling for a 10-28 for?
Thanks.
Hey, Willie Sanchez, 565414th Street,
162 pounds, 5'10" and a half shithead!
You cheated!
Oh, man...
Want me to pick that lock for you, Harry?
- This'll be the bar.
- It's freezing in here.
Oh, boy, Harry. Okay.
- All right, the bar is now open.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Stanley.
- Yes, sir.
- How about a little music?
- The man wants a little music.
Harry, you got a nice shop here.
You know, I was rereading
Dear Abby the other night, and there was this article, a letter from a fella called "Lonely and Anonymous."
I think it was Harry. Hey.
Where's the club soda?
We got any club soda?
Let me tell you something about Harry Caul.
There you go.
I know you heard this a thousand times, Harry, but let me say it again.
Here's to Harry, the best, bar none.
I'll drink to that.
The best what?
The best bugger on the West Coast.
And who's the best bugger on the East Coast?
Me. I'll drink to that, too.
I'll bet you will.
It's really funny we never bumped into each other in New York, Harry.
Why is that funny?
I don't know, we work in the same business, the same city.
I figure we'd bump into each other.
I didn't know you came from New York, Harry.
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?
Harry's famous in New York.
You know, the only one
I couldn't figure out though, Harry?
One what?
The welfare fund back in '68.
- How did you know about that?
- Everybody in the biz knew about it.
But nobody knows how you did it though, Harry.
- How did you do it, Harry?
- Harry.
Ten cents a dance. Come on.
You all right?
- You hurt yourself?
- No. Don't worry about my head.
It happens all the time.
In fact, when I was a little baby,
I used to love to bang my head up against the wall.
No, really. I did.
Sometimes I still feel like doing it
'cause it's comforting.
I tapped my first telephone when I was 12 years old, Harry.
I mean, that's a fact. 12 years old.
It was a hallway payphone right in the tenement, right where I lived.
Everybody in the building.
For six months, they didn't know who it was.
My father, he was proud as hell.
He was beaming.
Yeah, boy.
"That Bernie's got a real brain," he said.
From then on, it's been all uphill, Harry.
I got contacts now you wouldn't believe.
Here. Well, bring them over.
Take a cab over.
Nothing's sacred with you, is it, Harry?
Sure. The more, the merrier.
We'll be here all night.
Feel like I'm back in grammar.
- Oh, you son of a...
- What?
All right, what's the matter, Harry?
Can't you take a vacation?
You guys are amateurs, you know that?
When are you gonna get a new scrambler, Harry?
This one went out with the Trojan War.
Harry, come on.
I want to hear all about you.
- Where you from?
- Really obsolete, you know that, Harry?
- Harry got himself a girlfriend.
- Watch out, Harry.
- Where are you from?
- New York.
I used to live in New York.
Yes. First, I worked as a receptionist, and then I got promoted to secretary.
And then I was promoted to gal Friday, and special assistant to the boss, and then I married him.
Do you live far from here?
Harry?
Are you still married?
Oh, I don't know. Probably.
I guess maybe I am.
Last time I heard, he was...
Well, he was trying to scrape up enough money
- to buy another hardware store.
- Yeah.
And I ended up out here in San Francisco, unemployed, which is the entire story of my life up until tonight.
Here's to you.
You don't like me very much, do you?
You don't want to talk to me or anything.
I didn't say that.
Something is on your mind.
I wish you'd tell me.
I really do. I wish that...
I wish that you'd feel that you could talk to me and that we could be friends.
I mean, aside from all of this junk.
Would you...
If you were a girl who'd waited for someone...
You can trust me.
Well, you never really knew when he was going to come to see you.
You just lived in a room alone, and you knew nothing about him.
And if you loved him, you were patient with him, and even though he didn't dare ever tell you anything about himself personally, even though he may have loved you, would you...
- Would I what?
- Would you...
Would you go back to him?
Well, how would I know?
How would I know that he loved me?
You'd have no way of knowing.
Hey, Harry!
Did you hear the one about the broad who busted Vegas?
She wore a see-through blouse.
You know something, Harry?
Twelve years ago,
I recorded every telephone call made by the presidential nominee of a major political party.
I don't want to say which party.
But everywhere he went, that's where I was.
Coast to coast, I was listening, Harry.
I'm not saying I elected the President of the United States, but you can draw your own conclusions, Harry.
- I mean, he lost.
- Harry, tell them about the time you put the bug in the parakeet.
- Parakeet?
- No kidding.
Harry one time actually put a microphone in a little parakeet.
Is that right?
Parakeets don't happen to be my thing, Harry, but I sure would like to know how you did the teamster local back in '68.
What was that?
- Don't you get papers in Chicago, Millard?
- Probably out on strike.
It was all over the front pages.
Harry was working for the attorney general's office at the time.
You didn't know I knew that, did you, Harry?
Anyway, the president of this teamster local back east set up a phony welfare fund, right?
I mean, you correct me on the details, Harry.
I may be a little fuzzy on them.
There was only two people that seemed to know about it, the president and his accountant.
They only talked about it on fishing trips that they went on.
On a private boat.
That was the only place they talked details.
And that boat was bug-proof.
I happen to know that for a fact, Harry.
They wouldn't even strike up a conversation if there was another boat even on the horizon.
That didn't stop Harry though, did it?
No, he recorded everything.
Nobody knows how you did it though, Harry.
Caused a hell of a scandal, too.
Why?
Why? No reason.
Three people were murdered, that's all.
Harry's a bit too modest to tell us how he did it though.
It had nothing to do with me.
I just turned in the tapes.
The president thought the accountant had talked.
- Well, nobody really knows for sure.
- That's right.
Three days later, they found the accountant, his wife and kid, they were all naked and tied up in the house.
Hands and feet tied up with rope, all the hair on their bodies shaved off.
Their heads were found in different places.
- They killed them?
- No. They gift-wrapped them.
No, no, no. This is ancient history now.
Harry, how did you do it?
What they do with the tapes is their own business.
That's the first time
I heard about you, Harry.
Next thing I knew, you moved out of New York.
It had nothing to do with me.
Come on, Harry, show and tell.
How did you do it?
For God's sake, Harry, tell him!
- Turn it off, Stan.
- What for?
Stan, turn it off!
They ought to hear this, Harry.
It's the best thing you've ever done!
What was that, Stan?
Well, it's the assignment that Harry did this week.
- It'll make history.
- Yeah?
I bet you there's no moment between human beings that I cannot record, and there's no method that I cannot figure out.
I could figure out any of Harry's schemes, right?
Come on, come on. Try me.
- Let me give him the assignment, Harry.
- Yeah.
Now, this is a quad in the center of the city.
All right?
Now, these are steps coming in here and benches all around.
It's 12:00 noon, which means that it's lunchtime for all the people that work in these offices around here.
People are walking, talking, having lunch, and it's crowded.
- Naturally. Come on, Stan.
- Okay.
Now, two people are constantly moving in circles, in and out of the crowd.
We don't know whether they'll sit down or what.
They're convinced that they can't be recorded because they're in a crowd and constantly moving. Yet, they're the target.
Now, the assignment is to get everything they say.
How would you do it?
First of all, one system won't do it.
- Hell, I could've told you that.
- Yeah, why didn't you?
Go on, figure it out.
Second of all, it's easy.
All you do is get to their clothes first.
You pre-rig their clothes.
No. There's no way of telling what they're going to be wearing.
Then you get somebody to bump into them.
You just get a drunk or something, bump into them, you plant a pin mike on them.
They've been bugged before.
It's too risky.
I got it.
You hire a lip-reader with binoculars.
- No. The client wants their actual voice.
- Why?
So he can believe it.
All right. I'll figure it out.
I don't know.
It must've been an expensive show.
- Who was so interested?
- Yeah, was it us?
- Who's us?
- Federal government.
Private party.
It would take at least four passes.
- I did it in three.
- Three?
That's very nice, Harry.
What did you use?
Three-stage directional microphones with MOSFET amplifier of my own design.
And we got another 20% conventionally, just tailing them. Paul did.
Beautiful.
It really was. It was a work of art.
You should have seen it, though.
These new microphones are just incredible.
I couldn't really believe it myself.
We were over 200 yards away.
It was absolutely readable. Everything.
I broke in a couple of newsreel cameramen, and...
You should have been there, Bernie.
It was really...
What did they do?
Well, they took the crosshairs of the telescope and they lined it up on the mouths...
No. The boy and the girl.
What did they do?
Oh, I don't know. But it was really beautiful, really something to see.
Yeah. Sounds very pretty.
I'd like to take a look at that mike, too.
There it is.
I always said we should be partners, Harry.
I mean, I always said you're the best, right?
But you and me together, that'd be tops.
All I need is a quick look at some of your plans and devices.
You know, just get an idea...
I got all the manufacturing plants.
We could make a fortune selling stuff to Uncle Sam, Harry.
Listen, did you hear about the fag wire-tapper
- who could only tap a Princess phone?
- No.
Made that up yourself, huh?
It's pretty funny.
Excuse me, can I cut in?
He's got a hell of a sense of humor.
I'm talking about making millions, he's making with the jokes.
- Come on!
- Thanks a lot.
What do you say, Harry? Come on.
How about going into a partnership, Harry?
I could use a partner, so could you.
- 50-50, how about it?
- I don't need anyone.
No, no.
That's all right.
I do pretty good on my own, anyway.
You got to give credit where credit's due, right?
Abracadabra, Harry.
See, I'm number two, Harry.
I have to try harder.
If you were a girl who'd waited for someone...
You can trust me.
Harry, that's you and me when we were out there.
What? No shit.
...when he was going to come to see you.
It's the Moran Super P-7 pen mike and transmitter.
That's terrific! The bugger got bugged, huh?
He got you, Harry.
And if you loved him, you were patient with him,
and even though he didn't dare ever tell you anything about himself personally,
even though he may have loved you, would you...
That was wild. When did you do that?
Hey, how do you like it, Harry?
What do you think about it, huh?
Would you... Would you go back to him?
I think you'd better turn it off and get out.
You'd have no way of knowing.
Are you kidding?
It's just a joke, for Christ's sake.
Bernie, Harry don't like you to say "Christ's sake."
Oh, no? Well, I'm sorry, Harry. I apologize.
What, are you crazy, too, Stanley?
Hey, Harry. What's wrong?
Come on. Let's have a party here.
What do you say?
Paul, it's getting late.
Come on, take it easy.
Come on.
- Hey, Millard.
- Know what these things cost, Harry?
This cost 1,500 beans. Come on.
On the house, from me to you.
Very nice to meet you.
It was only a joke.
- Meredith?
- Guy's got no sense of humor.
- No. I'm going to stay here.
- Paul!
Okay.
I forgot my bag.
Harry, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean anything.
- Come on, Stan.
- See you Monday, Harry.
You want us to put the lights out?
- Good night, Harry!
- Yeah. Good night, Harry.
What do you think?
I don't know what I'm going to get him for Christmas yet.
He's already got everything.
Harry, are you going to give me a hard time tonight? Harry!
Harry! Come on. Come back.
Turn it off.
She's frightened.
This is where she's frightened.
I don't know what I'm going to get him for Christmas yet.
This is no ordinary conversation.
- He doesn't need anything anymore.
- It makes me feel...
Well, I haven't decided what I'm going to get you yet.
- something.
- Forget it, Harry. It's only a trick.
- What?
- A job.
You're not supposed to feel anything about it.
You're just supposed to do it. That's all.
Relax, honey.
A lot of fun you are.
- Relax.
- You're supposed to tease me,
give me hints, make me guess, you know.
Does it bother you?
- What?
- Walking around in circles.
Oh, look. That's terrible.
He's not hurting anyone.
Come on.
Neither are we.
- Oh, God.
- "Oh, God."
Listen to the way she says, "Oh, God."
Come here.
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.
What do you think?
I always think that he was once somebody's baby boy.
Really, I do.
I think he was once somebody's baby boy,
and he had a mother and a father who loved him.
And now there he is, half-dead on a park bench,
and where are his mother or his father, all his uncles now?
Anyway, that's what I always think.
I always think how, when they had the newspaper strike in New York,
more of those old guys died.
Fifty of them froze to death in one night.
Just because there were no newspapers?
- Really. Keeps them warm.
- That's terrible.
Who started this conversation, anyhow?
- You did.
- Did not.
Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.
Pretend like I just told you a joke.
- Where did you hear that?
- That's my secret.
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.
Sunday, definitely.
Jack Tar Hotel.
3:00.
Room 773.
Look, Mark. Do you see him?
The man with the hearing aid like Charles?
- No. Where?
- Right there, with the shopping bag.
He's been following us all around, and he's following us close.
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
Angel...
God, it will be so good to be finished with all this.
I love you.
It's all right, baby. It's all right.
We're spending too much time together here.
No. Let's stay just a little longer.
"Kill us."
He'd kill them if he had a chance.
He'd kill us if he got the chance.
Oh, God, what I have done.
I have to destroy the tapes.
I can't let it happen again.
It's true.
- I'd better get back. It's almost 2:00.
- Oh, no, please, don't go.
A family was murdered because of me.
I know. I know, Harry.
Everything will turn out.
Oh, God. There's no protection.
I follow them wherever they're going.
And I can hear them.
Bye-bye.
Oh, wait, you have something in your eye.
- Yeah?
- You really don't. I just wanted to kiss you.
I forgive you. I forgive you, darling.
Listen. Listen. My name is Harry Caul.
Can you hear me?
Don't be afraid.
I... I know you don't know who I am, but I know you.
There isn't much to say about myself. I...
Sick when I was a boy.
I was very sick when I was a boy.
I was paralyzed in my left arm and my left leg.
I couldn't walk for six months.
One doctor said that
I'd probably never walk again.
My mother...
My mother used to lower me into a hot bath.
It was therapy.
One time the doorbell rang and she went down to answer it.
I started sliding down.
I could feel the water.
It started coming up to my chin, to my nose.
And when I woke up,
my body was all greasy from the holy oil she put on my body.
I remember being disappointed I survived.
When I was five,
my father introduced me to a friend of his,
and for no reason at all,
I hit him right in the stomach with all my strength.
He died a year later.
He'll kill you if he gets a chance.
I'm not afraid of death.
I am afraid of murder.
Meredith?
Hey!
Bitch.
Good morning. May I help you?
- Yes. Extension 765, please.
- One moment, please.
Director's office.
Yes, I'd like to speak to the director's assistant, please.
Mr. Stett. Mr. Martin Stett.
Mr. Caul is on the line.
One moment, please.
I'm sorry. That's impossible now.
Can we get back to you?
No, I... I have to talk to him.
- Can we have your name again?
- Caul.
- Would you mind spelling that?
- C-A-U-L. Caul.
I'm putting you on hold.
- Mr. Caul, we'll get right back to you.
- No. You don't have my telephone number!
Hello?
- Yes?
- Mr. Caul? This is Martin Stett.
How did you get this phone number?
We prepare a full dossier on everyone who comes in contact with the director.
You know that means we've been watching you.
We have the tapes.
They're perfectly safe.
The director was very anxious to hear them as soon as possible.
You seemed to be...
I don't know... Disturbed.
I couldn't take the chance that you might destroy our tapes.
You understand, don't you, Mr. Caul?
Our tapes have nothing to do with you.
Why don't you come over now and bring the photographs?
- Yes...
- The director's here,
and he's prepared to pay you in full.
Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.
What do you think?
I always think that he was once somebody's baby boy.
Really, I do.
I think he was once somebody's baby boy,
and he had a mother and a father who loved him.
And now there he is, half-dead on a park bench,
and where are his mother or his father, all his uncles now?
Anyway, that's what I always think.
I always think how, when they had the newspaper strike in New York,
more of those old guys died.
Fifty of them froze to death in one night.
Just because there were no newspapers?
- Really. Keeps them warm.
- That's terrible.
Who started this conversation anyhow?
- You did.
- Did not.
Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.
Oh, Mark, it's all right. We can talk.
I can't stand it.
I can't stand it anymore.
- You're going to make me cry.
- I know, honey, I know. Me, too.
- No, don't.
- Oh, God.
- You want to hear that again?
- You want it to be true!
No, I don't. I just want you to know whatever you need to know.
That's all.
Your money's on the table.
Do you think we can do this?
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.
I'm tired of mostly everything.
- Tired of me?
- Tired of you,
but not today.
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.
Sunday, definitely.
Jack Tar Hotel.
3:00.
Room 773.
Look, Mark. Do you see him?
The man with the hearing aid like Charles?
- No. Where?
- Right there, with the shopping bag.
Please count your money outside.
He's been following us all around, and he's following us close.
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
God, it will be so good to be finished with all this.
I love you.
These are the pictures you asked for.
We're spending too much time together here.
No. Let's stay just a little longer.
What will you do to her?
...kill us if he got the chance.
I think he's been recording my telephone.
Listen, I'd better get back. It's almost 2:00.
No, please, don't go back there.
Not just yet.
All right. All right, honey. I won't.
Fifteen thousand bucks.
That's not bad for a day's work, is it, Mr. Caul?
What'll he do with them?
We'll see.
He'd kill us if he got the chance.
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.
Sunday, definitely.
Jack Tar Hotel.
3:00.
Room 773.
I wonder if you could give me Room 773.
That is occupied, sir.
The rooms are all basically the same, however.
Well...
Do you have a room that would be adjoining, close by?
- Adjoining, just... Yes, I do.
- You do.
I'm tired of this lying, all right?
I'm tired of lying!
Oh, Mark, it's all right. We can talk.
I can't stand it.
I can't stand it anymore.
- You're going to make me cry.
- I know, honey, I know. Me, too.
No, don't.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
No idea! This has all been a lie!
Don't you understand that?
I love you.
The answer is, "No."
At the end of the briefing last night, it was stated
that Nixon would not deliver the State of the Union message in person...
Why not?
- Watch out for the bumps!
- Will you cut that out?
How can you yell at me like that?
And in my condition.
You're not fit to be the father of my child.
Oh, what is this?
- I'm just trying to act like Wilma.
- Well, you're overdoing it.
All right. Pull over.
What's the big rush?
I'm taking my wife to the hospital.
She's having a baby.
I got to hand it to you, buddy.
You sure got intestinal fortitude.
You better sit down, Fred.
You're wearing a groove in the floor.
Look at Wilma out there.
How can she be so calm when she knows what I'm going through?
- How are you, Fred?
- How do you think I am?
This waiting, waiting, waiting... It's tough!
Betty, you go back out there and tell Wilma if she doesn't...
- Wait. Richard!
- I want to see the director.
He's not in today.
I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.
Let's clear an aisle and let these people through,
- and we can move on upstairs.
- Come on, clear the way here.
We'll answer your questions upstairs.
Just let these people through.
Let these people through.
- Just one question.
- No, please.
Do you suspect any foul play in the accident?
Please!
What about your corporate control?
Will your stock now give you a controlling interest...
What kind of insurance do you have?
What's going to happen to the company?
That's an unfair question.
- Did you have...
- Did your husband...
What do you think?
I don't know what I'm going to get him for Christmas yet.
He's already got everything.
He doesn't need anything anymore.
Do you feel now that there's an enemy within the company?
He's not hurting anyone.
Neither are we.
Oh, God.
Did your husband have a history of drunk driving?
No comments, no more...
Did your husband have a history of drunk, reckless driving?
I can't stand it.
I can't stand it anymore.
Take it!
Take it!
Do you think we can do this?
Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.
Sunday, definitely.
Jack Tar Hotel.
3:00.
Room 773.
He'd kill us if he got the chance.
Hello.
Hello?
Hello.
- Hello?
- We know that you know, Mr. Caul.
For your own sake, don't get involved any further.
We'll be listening to you.

[Man] I'll get it Mrs. Tredoni.
Hi Tom, how are you?
It's so good to see you.
Mommy said you wanted to see me.
Oh, did she now?
And now, why would
I wanna see ya?
You know.
And did you make a good confession?
Oh yes Father.
Do you have a present for me?
Of course I do, in the dinning room.
Did you find it?
Where?
Here, here, some of Mrs. Tredoni's delicious cookies.
Sit down.
Are you sure this is my present?
Alice, why don't you sit down?
No thanks Father Tom.
I have to go to the bathroom.
It's alright sweet heart, go ahead, you know where it is.
Oh!
You nasty child, out of my kitchen.
Take that thing of your face.
Who said you could go wandering around?
I thought you had to go to the bathroom?
I'm sorry Mrs. Tredoni.
You probably frightened her half to death.
Now go inside and sit down and try to act like a lady.
Tom, I'm sorry.
It's alright, I'm sure she didn't mean any harm.
Karen, open your present, we all wanna see what it is.
[Mom] Oh, it's beautiful.
Belonged to my mother.
Oh Tom, you shouldn't have.
What if she loses it?
Who else would
I give it to Cait?
I love you Father
Tom, I really love you.
I know you'll take good care of it.
Just lovely.
[Girl] Mommy, mommy.
Alice?
Alice?
Mommy, mommy, mommy.
What is it?
What did she do to you now?
Are you alright?
She took it, she's going to break it.
I had it all to myself and she took it.
What did she take?
She took my doll, the doll daddy sent me.
She's going to break it, I know she is.
No she won't, I promise you she won't break it.
Honey, I have to get to
Cela's before they close.
You want me to get your dress don't you?
Yes.
Okay.
Alice.
Alice.
Alice.
Alice.
Alice where are you?
Mommy says you're to come home right this instant.
Give me my doll back.
Where are you?
Why are you running away from me?
[Alice] Didn't I tell you never to follow me?
Where's my doll?
No, no, let me out. Let me out.
Let me out, let me out.
If you tell mommy about this you're never gonna see that doll again now go home.
[Mom] Where's your sister?
Oh she's coming mom, my dress.
Where have you been going Alice?
Don't think you can keep things from me.
You're not gonna get away with this.
Why should you care where I do? I'm not Karen.
I want the table set immediately.
I don't like this new habit of yours disappearing when you're told to do something.
You're old enough to know better.
Sometimes I think you don't care about anybody but yourself.
She's ruining my veil, make her take it off.
Take your sister's veil off.
Make her take it off mommy.
Alice.
Take your old veil, I don't want that stupid thing anyway.
Alice, what's wrong with you sister, sister?
I don't understand you.
It's ruined.
It's ruined.
It's ruined.
Alright.
See, nothing happened to it.
Oh, you look beautiful, go look.
You're gonna be the prettiest girl there.
Wait 'til Father Tom sees you.

Angela, go find Alice, take your coat with ya.
Annie, it is not necessary,
I was just out there and she's not there.
Well, where can she be?
I don't know.
Alright girls, let's get ready now.

She's got no business up there, for God sake, go get her.
Oh my God, where's Angela?
Please be calm, there's nothing to worry about.
Keep calm everyone, please.
Oh my God, ah.
Where were you?
I want a communion mommy,
Father wouldn't give me the...
Let's find Karen.
[Father] Sister.
Let me go to her.
No, no.
Let me go, get out of the way.
Where did you get that veil?
I found it on the floor when I came in.
Is that Karen's veil?
Where is she?
I was gonna give it to her.
Come on.
Catherine.
No, I don't want to.
What's the matter with you? Come on.
Catherine,
Catherine, Catherine.
Let go of me.
She's dead.
Let go.
She's dead, Karen's dead.
She's dead. Karen's dead.
No.
No!
As I call out your names, kindly take your places in the assigned cars.
Mrs. Falco and Andrea.
Mrs. Gracy and Mrs. Bruno.
[Police Radio] 10-4.
Affirm.
The fat one didn't show up.
Did you find out where the girl was?
The mother says she was helping the nuns.
[Passenger Man] Did you talk to any of them?
[Driver Man] No, not yet.
Who's that?
The father.
Well, at least he managed to get here before they put her in the ground.
Annie please, not now.
I'm so glad you came.
[Driver Man] What are they, separated?
[Passenger Man]
He's remarried.
I don't want to rush you but mass begins at nine.
Hi Ali.
Alice, sit on the fold-up, make room for your father.
I want to stay where I am.
Please do what you're told.
Annie please, there is plenty of room.
No problem, I can sit on the fold-up.
Never mind, I'll sit in the second car.
There's room up here Annie.
Move over.
What?
I said move over.
I want you to find out exactly where that girl was.
And I'd like to talk to that Alphonso character before they get back from the grave.
Let's go.
[Man] It's such a tragedy, we're not even safe in a church anymore.
That darling little Alice, she's taking this so well.
Your husband and
I were just saying what a great help she's been to her mother.
Hey, will you make sure you tell Catherine that she must call me at once if she needs anything.
Thank you, there's nothing anyone can do.
I'll be staying here with my sister for as long as she needs me.
Angela, stop eating, haven't you had enough?
Jim, help me clean up this mess.
You don't need that drink.
I've made arrangements to stay in town for the next few day, I'll be here if you need me.
Don't you have to go home?
You don't have to stay,
I'll be here for a while.
Annie you're only
10 minutes away and Jim and the children need you.
Catherine please, Jim wants me to be here.
My Angela can take care of everything at home.
Isn't that right Jim?
Beg your pardon?
Angela can take of everything at home?
Of course dear, yes.
Okay then, I know this is a bad time to bring it up but, there's some things we have to talk about.
It's no ordinary situation.
I know.
I just don't know where to start.
Is it necessary to have this conversation in front of the children?
God damn it Annie, the child was murdered.
Or don't you understand what that means?
Ask the kids to leave, there's some things I'd like to know.
Listen, there's an awful lot of cake left.
It's a shame to let it go to waste.
Alice, would you bring this down to Mr. Alphonso?
And thank him for the lovely flowers.
Angela, Robert, go with her.
Don't disappear, keep the noise down.
I heard everyone leave, it's all over huh?
Well, you die and they put you in the ground and it's over.
Such a shame, such a pretty girl too.
Too bad she was the one to end up in the box.
My mother thought you could use some cake fatty.
Thank your mother for me, such a lovely lady.
God always takes the pretty ones.
Wow, is he fat?
[Robert] He scares me.
Really? That ugly bastard doesn't scare me.
Come on Alice, let's get out of here before my mother hears you.
[Angela] Robert don't follow us.
We taught you, we don't want you with us.
[Dad] What the hell's the matter with you people?
[Annie] You have no idea what I'm talking about.
[Dad] What's she trying to say?
[Jim] Alice was the last one in that church.
[Dad] So what's that supposed to mean?
[Annie] What do you think it's supposed to mean?
[Catherine] Stop it, I won't listen to this again.
You saw the photographers at the church.
The police do investigate a murder you know.
I still don't understand what that has to do with Alice.
Everyone knew she was the last one in the church.
They wanna talk to her, they think she may have seen someone.
What if the police find out about the veil?
What veil?
Jim, what's she talking about?
She had Karen's veil in her pocket.
For Christ sake, she probably found it on the floor.
I'm sure you didn't even ask her where she got it.
Annie, why'd you have to start this?
I think you've gone too far.
Shut up, I know what I'm doing.
I have an appointment with Detective Brennan.
Take the elevator to the third floor.
Make a left, his name's on the door.
It's open, come in.
Sit down.
Sorry about your daughter,
I guess you got a lot of questions.
Yeah, you're right,
I was hoping you could tell me something.
As a matter of fact, my partner's down in your neighborhood now checking on a few things.
Is anything being done to protect Catherine and my daughter?
What makes you think you need protection?
I don't know, I couldn't imagine anyone killing Karen.
People do crazy things.
Mr. Spages, you mind if I talk to Alice?
Where's that gonna get ya?
Alice was the last one to go into the church.
She might have seen something, something she knows nothing about but might set us in the right direction.
For example, the veil, exactly where'd she find that veil?
Ray.
Listen, about the veil, it's obvious to me that Alice came in after the murder.
I spoke with her, she said she found it on the floor when she came in.
Karen must have dropped it during the struggle.
Mr. Spages, how did Alice know it was Karen's veil?
They're all alike, they all come from the same store.
Alice never said it was Karen's veil.
Everyone just assumed it was, and the name is Spages.
According to you sister-in-law
Alice said it was Karen's veil.
She's always jumping to conclusion especially where
Alice is concerned.
Well, your wife didn't disagree with her.
Well my wife's been under a little strain lately.
Does you sister-in-law dislike your daughter?
It's probably more accurate to say she doesn't like me.
Come on, you really think she dislikes you enough to implicate your daughter in a murder?
I don't like where this is leading.
You can just forget about talking to Alice.
I spoke to the principal, she's made a repeated request that the kid see a psychiatrist and for some reason the requests have been ignored.
Here, there's the record, see for yourself.
This kid is nuts.
(thunder roaring and rain pouring)
St Michael's residence.
[Dad] Father Tom please.
I'm sorry, he's having lunch right now.
[Dad] Well, he's expecting my call it's very important.
I'm sorry, but
Father don't like to be disturbed at meal time.
Tell him it's Dominick Spages.
Fine, if you leave your number I have him call you back.
Look, damn it.
Hey, don't raise your voice to me.
I don't care who it is, I'm just following the rules.
Look, it's very important
I speak to Father Tom.
[Mrs. Tredoni]
Well, if I gave in every time someone told me that he'd never eat a meal without interruption.
That's okay Mrs. Tredoni.
Hmm.
Sorry Tom, I told her to put you through when you called but I guess she forgot.
Where are you?
I'm at the police station.
[Father] Did they mention anything about the school?
No, what about the school?
Well, they came and took Alice's records away.
I couldn't stop 'em.
You know, I don't believe those bastards.
You know what they're trying to do?
Now, take it easy, I know Brennan he's not that kind of guy.
Yeah well, now he wants to talk to Alice.
I wanna talk to you alone for a few minutes.
I've got some things to tell ya and I haven't had a chance.
(rain pouring and thunder roaring)
I'll be going out for a couple of hours Mrs. Tredoni.
[Mrs. Tredoni] Are you coming home for supper Father?
I knew that was going to happen and that is precisely why I don't like interrupt him at meal time.
A-huh, there is a good reason for everyone.
(Karen Voiceover singing drown out by music)
[Annie] Alice, put that knife down.
That's too heavy, be careful.
What did I tell you?
Don't hit me, don't hit me, don't hit me,
I didn't mean it.
I'm not going to hit you.
Stay still, when have I ever hit you?
What you need is a few good smacks.
You liar, you were too.
[Catherine] Alice, don't move, you're walking on the glass.
Don't move.
[Annie] She called me a liar, now I am gonna hit her.
Annie, get the dustpan.
You see, she was gonna hit me, it was an accident.
Stay still before you cut yourself.
Look at this mess, I just finished cleaning.
I told her to be careful, she never listens to me.
It was an accident
Annie, she didn't mean it.
Tell your aunt you didn't mean it.
It's always an accident.
She hates me, I didn't do it on purpose.
I told her it was too heavy and she goes right ahead and does it anyway.
This is why she should be back in school.
I'm not going back to school.
I'm never going back,
I wanna stay with you.
You belong in school.
Your mother doesn't need you here, I'm here.
Yes too, she does too.
I'm never going back, I won't go.
Annie why must you keep insisting on this school business?
With all the trouble she's been in she can't afford to miss a single day.
What trouble? I spoke with Father Tom and we agree that
Monday is soon enough.
Not Monday mommy please.
Have it your way Catherine but the child belongs in school.
This is my house, you won't be here forever.
I can't wait 'til you're gone.
I forbid you to talk to your aunt that way.
She makes me so nervous,
I do everything wrong when she's around.
But you don't mean what you're saying.
Aunt Annie loves you, she only does things for your own good.
If you'd listened to her you wouldn't have dropped the milk.
Why is she always right?
Catherine.
[Alice] You know what, take her side.
That's enough.
Aunt Annie is very generous to stay with us and I don't wanna hear anymore about not going to school.
I know that you miss Karen, so do I, but we both have to get back to our usual lives.
Don't you need me here?
Of course I need you and you can help me.
But you can't stay out of school.
Would you take the rent check down to Mr. Alphonso for me?
Don't take too long love, your daddy'll be here soon.
Move over.
Alice.
Thank you.
[Annie] Did you find the cross?
[Catherine] No, I'm sure it was lost at the church.
[Annie] Well Alice doesn't have it,
I've been through her things.
[Catherine] Annie, why did you do that?
I told you I would ask her.
Why don't you trust her?
[Annie] I know how important that cross is to you Cai.
I think Alice knows where it is.
I know you're there
Alice, you can come in.
I won't bit you.
How did you know it was me?
I have the rent check.
I was gonna slide it under the door.
Where do you want me to put it?
There's so much junk around this filthy place.
I bet you never clean it.
It smells like cat piss.
My aunt says you should be reported to the Board of Health.
What's the matter fatty?
Stuck in a chair?
You don't like your aunt do you?
I don't like you.
You know why you don't like us?
Your aunt and I are two very perceptive people we know what you did at the church.
I can't wait to tell your father all I know about you.
What the hell do you know?
Come on, the check.
Damn it, look what you've done to this check.
Let me go.
Where are you goin?
You're not in a rush are you?
I know what you have downstairs.
Have you been snooping through my things?
Your things? They're not your things.
Karen will come for them.
The dead have ways.
The dead don't rest easy.
You better let me out.
I'll scream.
I'll scream and my mother'll call the police.
The police were already here today and if they come back
I'll take them downstairs.
Get away, go, you weirdo.
I'm killing your cat.
No.
You pressed up against me once before you disgusting slob, you'll never do that again.
[Mr. Alphonso] No, don't kill my cat.
Don't kill my diamond.
Ah, stop it, I can reason with you.
If things were so bad at school,
Catherine should have been the first to know.
I don't understand why you let it go on so long.
It wasn't that serious until recently.
Anyway, they weren't really sure exactly what should be blamed on Alice.
She has knack of making things look like accidents.
Thought I could handle it myself,
I used to talk a lot with her but lately she set up a barrier.
(footsteps clacking and squeaking)
* Oh give me something to remember you by
* When you are far away from me
* Just a little something
* meaning love can not die
* No matter where you chance to be
* So I'll pray for you
* I will pray for you
* It will see me through like a charm
* Until your return
* So give me something to remember you by
* When you are far away from me
Alice.
Annie!
Annie!
No!
Alice.
Alice, stop.
- What's going on, Alice?
- Annie?
[Mr. Alphonso] It's Alice!
It's Alice, it's Alice!
[Catherine]
Annie, Annie, Annie!
Someone, help me please!
Help me!
Help me please!
Someone help me!
Dom!
Dom!
Christ, what happened?
Lots of bleeding, someone attacked her
Lets get her to the hospital in the hall.
Get her to the hospital.
Alright, okay, I got you.
Did somebody call the police?
I don't know.
Jim.
Jim.
Jim.
[Father Tom] Tell the police
I'm taking her to St
Michael's Hospital.
Dom, find Alice, make sure you find her.
I didn't steal it, I was saving it for you Karen.
You can have it.
Oh daddy, daddy help me.
It's alright baby it's okay.
It's okay.
I saw Karen.
I will, shh.
I saw Karen.
Daddy, I never meant for her to die.
I know you didn't.
[Alice] I know it was Karen daddy,
I think she wants her doll.
[Intercom Voiceover] Dr.
Sarno, 383, Dr. Sarno, 383.
Mmh.
Okay.
Bye.
Is she alright?
Yes.
She's just so frightened.
Oh Tom, what am I gonna do?
Everything's happening so fast.
Dom said whoever did it frightened her half to death.
[Father Tom] Where was she?
She was in the basement.
Who's doing this to me?
Haven't I had enough?
Alphonso told the police it was Alice.
They're on their way here.
Did he her?
Of course not, how could he?
He's only repeating what he heard Annie scream.
Don't you see, people believe what they want to believe.
Well, what's important is what the police will think about this.
Well they don't know her.
No one knows her like I do.
What if Annie tells them what she told me?
Well we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
What are you saying?
She was hysterical, she didn't even know me.
Annie would never say something like that if she were herself.
Catherine, there's
Detective Spina.
Tom, talk to 'em.
Let me go to Annie, just give me a minute please, please.
Catherine.
Annie.
Annie.
Annie, I wanna talk to you.
I wanna talk to you Annie.
I know you won't do this to me.
You didn't realize what you were saying.
How could you, you were so upset.
Don't turn away like that.
What is the matter with you?
You've gonna crazy, am
I some kind of stranger?
Please Annie, please.
I will never forgive you if you do this to me.
Never, never.
Excuse me Father.
Get through here.
Hi Mrs. DeLorenze.
I won't keep you long.
You know I have to talk to you.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
Where's Jim? I want Jimmy.
Leave her alone,
I'm her sister.
I was there and I can tell you anything you wanna know.
I'm sure you can Mrs. Spages and I'm very interested in hearing everything you have to say.
But right now I wanna be alone with your sister for a while.
Uh, Father, you think you and Mrs. Spages could leave the room for a minute.
I'll be right with you.
Annie.
[Annie] Oh Jimmy.
Jimmy.
Annie, Annie.
What happened?
Jim, oh Jimmy.
Honey, I was so worried.
Somebody called and said somebody tried to kill you.
Oh my God Jimmy it was awful.
She stabbed and stabbed my legs.
Who Annie? Who?
Annie, don't.
She tried to kill me.
Oh my God, I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
Annie, shut up.
Cait, for Christ sake, let her talk.
Alright, what's going on here?
She's like my own,
I love her Catherine.
You hate her!
Because you knew I was pregnant when I got married.
That's not true.
I love Alice, may God strike me dead if I'm lying.
Annie don't, you realize what you're saying?
It was Alice, it was Alice.
Liar!
Liar!
You're all liars!
I'm not lying, I'm not lying.
I wanna believe it was her.
Why not Angela? She wasn't in the church?
See, you see.
Don't you see what they're trying to do?
This is Detective Mike Spina,
I wanna be connected with the
Paterson Police Department.
Now, remember Alice, I want you to say no to every card.
I want you to lie.
Is it the six?
No.
[Interviewer] The four?
[Alice] No.
It was the six wasn't it?
Yes.
Yes, now we know it's working.
Now let's get to these questions shall we, yes.
Now, do you intend to answer truthful to every question?
Please answer yes or no.
Yes.
Do you know for sure who stabbed your aunt?
No.
[Interviewer] Did you stab your aunt?
No.
During your entire life, did you deliberately hurt someone who trusted you?
During your entire life, did you deliberately hurt someone who trusted you?
I put Debbie's coat in the toilet if that's what you mean.
But I didn't lie, I told the sister I did it.
Now, please Alice, answer yes or no.
Yes.
In the suitcase found in the basement were a white dress and a mask, are they yours?
Yes.
Are you deliberately withholding any information regarding the attack on your aunt?
No.
Do you know who stabbed your aunt?
No.
Do you know who stabbed your aunt?
Yes, it was Karen, it told them it was Karen but no one believes me.
It was Karen.
Alright Alice, thank you.
They're finished.
The matron will take you back to my office and I'll give you the test results there.
[Catherine] What about Alice?
I'll bring her back with me.
Will you give me Alice's coat.
[Dominick] What do you need that for?
You'll get it back.
Thank you.
Well?
I don't know what to tell ya.
Well for Christ sake, did she fail or didn't she?
Technically, I guess she failed.
What do you meant technically?
Well, I asked her if she knew who stabbed her aunt, she lied, she said no.
So I asked her again, she said it was her sister.
But her sister's dead.
Yeah, but she wasn't lying.
So what do you want from me?
It's obvious the kid is off the wall.
I wanna book her, if not for the murder, for the stabbing of her aunt.
We'll let the psychiatrist give us some answers.
She is a weird little girl.
Did you notice her tits?
When I went to put the tub around her she looked up at me like she wanted me to feel her up.
Hey, the little bitch is bumping your machine.
Hey, hey, hey, hey stop that.
Damn you, stop that.
In the name of the Father, the son and the
Holy Ghost, amen.
Bless us our Lord for these, our gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ our Lord, amen.
In the name of the Father and the sun and the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Why couldn't I stay upstairs?
You know I'm not feeling well.
Because I can't be running up and down.
And tell the children to stay out.
What children?
You know there's no children in the house.
You want me to feed you, or you can manage by yourself?
I am not dead yet.
Then eat.
Where's my wine?
I have only two hands Monsignor.
Father's not coming to lunch?
You sure you don't wanna come to the shelter with us?
No, I don't think that'd be a good idea.
She only needs the two of you now.
Well, come inside, I'll get you the information you want.
Oh, that must be Tom now.
And everything is ice cold.
Cold?
No, tell him not to worry, she's a good woman.
What are you talking about?
You don't make sense.
You didn't eat your lunch.
I want my cake, now.
I'll help you.
Now, this is only the order sheet for the coats.
I'll call them on the superior and tell her you're on your way.
She has the complete list of all the names and addresses of those who purchased one.
Angela has one, doesn't she?
Why Angela, what are you groping for?
Well, Alice said she saw
Karen in one of those coats.
It's obvious she saw someone, maybe it was Angela.
You realize you're doing to Angela what you think Annie is doing to Alice.
Well if it wasn't her, whoever it was might be on this list.
If this lead doesn't work out how long will you stay around and play detective?
I don't know Tom, I have to stay until a killer is found.
And what about Julia?
I can't answer that right now.
And thanks for the car, I'll drop it off tomorrow alright.
Subject, Alice Spages,
12 years one month.
Normal physical development.
Subject represses hostilities toward her mother and estranged father.
What do you want?
Strong indications of a schizoid personality.
Subject's capable of extremely violent action.
Come in.
[Nurse] Dr. Whitman, Mr.
And Mrs. Spages are here.
Yes.
Sit down.
I had a session with Alice this morning and I thought perhaps I should talk to you before you see her.
Is anything wrong?
Well, it's far too soon to be making judgements.
As understaffed as we are here we try to give the children as much time as they would have in private practice.
I've diagnosed hundreds of cases exactly like Alice but to eliminate any possibility of error one tires to suspend judgement until one can observe as much as you possibly can.
Dr. Whitman I think you should know that my attorney is doing every he possibly can to get Alice back home with her mother.
That's exactly what I want to warn you against.
I don't think you should encourage Alice to believe that she'd be coming home soon.
Perhaps being at home with her mother is not the best thing.
What does that mean?
Be prepared for hostility from Alice.
I mean, it's certainly natural that she would think that you were responsible for her predicament.
You might say, that like all of us, she blames others for her troubles.
She is here because of a lot of other people.
Alice has many deep seeded problems.
But she is not a murderer.
Alice needs psychological help.
Well in that case, I assume you'd have no objection to our using our own psychiatrist.
Not at all.
Would you take the Spages down to the playground please.
[Nurse] Yes.
Let me remind you to be candid about the issue of coming home.
Be assured she will get the best possible treatment here.
Oh, Mrs. Spages, why did
Alice conceal from you the fact that she's begun menstruating?
The parents so often don't know their children as well as they presume.
[Dominick] Ali, how you doing honey?
[Alice] Fine.
[Catherine] Did you sleep alright?
How's your room?
Why'd you bring the suitcase, aren't you taking me home?
Not until the doctor says you're ready.
We met Dr. Whitman.
What did you think of her?
She said you had a nice talk.
What'd you talk about?
A lot of things.
Like what Ali?
I told her aunt Annie lies and that you let her.
That's not true.
You're just like aunt
Annie and that slob Alphonso.
You wanna keep me here.
Alice, now you're hurting your mother,
I don't want you to talk like that.
Now listen, I don't want you to worry.
I'm going to find out the truth.
How can you? You have to go home to your wife.
Honey, I promise,
I intend to stay until I find out who was in the hall with your aunt.
Come on.
I don't wanna stay here.
Why can't I go home?
[Dominick] You heard the judge, you have to stay until the medical tests are completed.
Medical tests?
She's a psychiatrists.
Everyone thinks I'm crazy cause I said it was Karen and you don't believe me either.
Can you understand that there are two different reasons why you're here?
One is because you were in the basement when your aunt was attacked.
But I didn't do it.
I know you didn't do it and
I'm gonna find out who did.
I saw Karen.
Look, many times we think we see things and later we realize we were wrong.
But sometimes it's important to find out why.
Dr. Whitman wants you to sign a release form for medication.
What does she need that for?
[Dominick] Stay here,
I'll see what it's about.
Would you like to show me your room and I can help you put your things away?
I don't want to.
I packed your heavy robe just in ca...
I don't need it.
I didn't put you here Alice.
What's wrong with you?
Why won't you talk to me, I'm your mother.
I have nothing to talk about.
Well you had plenty to say to Dr. Whitman.
Why didn't you tell me you had your period.
Why doesn't everybody just leave me alone?
Leave you alone?
Don't you know that I love you.
You're on my mind every minute.
Take this, you know it's not mine.
I thought maybe you might want it now.
Well I don't, I don't play with dolls anymore.
I'm sorry.
I guess I just keep forgetting how old you are.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Is there anything you want from home?
No, just leave me alone.
Don't take this out on me Alice.
I am trying.
[Alice] Mommy no, don't go.
Please don't leave me here, I'm sorry.
And why can't you see that it makes just as much sense that
Angela could be guilty?
[Catherine] Dom, you're wrong.
You're looking for something that isn't there.
[Dominick] Her name is on the coat list.
Look how small
Karen's coat is.
It's a size seven, Angela's would be at least a 14.
How could Alice confuse the two of them?
It was dark, she was so scared she didn't even recognize me.
Dom, I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
You said yourself no one knew where Angela was.
Hello?
Hello?
I think it was Annie.
What does she expect me to do?
Forgive her and pretend nothing has happened?
I think you should talk to her.
Oh I will, when she admits that she lied.
But why antagonize her, it can only hurt Alice.
I can't.
Please answer.
I can't, I just can't deal with it.
Hello Ann?
She hung up.
Sorry.
I shouldn't have asked you to.
We can do it without her.
I'll make everything alright.
Can you?
Can you?
Hello?
[Woman Voiceover] Hello
Catherine, it's Julia.
Oh.
[Julia Voiceover] I hope
I'm not disturbing you.
I've been trying to find Dom, is he there?
Yes he's here.
It's your wife.
Julia, what's wrong?
[Julia Voiceover] I thought you were going to call.
Is everything alright?
How can it be?
[Julia Voiceover]
Why you so annoyed?
I'm sorry honey, I didn't mean to snap.
What's the matter?
[Julia Voiceover] Nothing, it's just that I'm kind of lonely.
Look, I can't talk right now.
I'll call you there tonight alright.
[Julia Voiceover] Are you sure nothing is wrong?
I miss you, can't wait
'til you get back.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Yes, I love you.
I'll call you there tonight.
Bye.
Alice was right, don't play detective, go home.
Dom.
I wanted it as much as you did.
It was nice to be held.
You know you're even more beautiful now.
That's nice.
We're both so dumb.
I guess you're right.
Dom, don't you think you should go back?
It's not fair.
I can't.
Oh, oh Mr. Spages, I was just ringing your room.
You've got a call.
Why don't you take it from here?
[Dominick] Thanks.
You bet.
Hello?
[Girl Voiceover] Uncle Tom?
Who is this?
[Girl Voiceover] Angela.
Angela, what's wrong?
[Angela Voiceover] I ran away, I'm hiding.
I got Karen's...
Honey, I can't hear you, you're gonna have to speak louder.
[Angela's Voiceover]
I've got Karen's cross and mommy won't let me give it to you.
Listen, let me meet you somewhere and we can talk about it, okay?
[Angela Voiceover]
Will you tell?
Now you know better than that.
Has uncle Dom ever done anything to hurt you?
[Angela Voiceover] No.
Look, I'm leaving right now, where are you?
[Angela Voiceover] I'm at,
I'm in the Ivan home building.
Alright, I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Angela now, stop crying honey, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Thank you.
Angela, wait.
Angela?
Ah!
You don't have to be afraid of me.
God damn it, what are you doing to me?
You? Oh my God.
You fit me big, you and that whore.
God wants you vanished.
Me-ah protection against the sneers of the devil.
Father belongs to the church.
That's mine, mine.
That cross is mine.
And it's mine.
Mine.
Mine.
Mine.
Mine.
Mine.
Mine.
Thrust into hell, Satan and the other evil spirits who rob this earth, seeking the ridden of souls.
[Woman] Alright, let's settle down now.
Don't keep Father waiting.
In the pews.
[Father] Hello boys and girl.
[Children] Hello Father.
Today is your last confession as a group so I want you to think very carefully what you're going to say.
But remember, you don't have to tell me everything you've done since last Sunday.
After all we don't want sister to miss her lunch.
And please remember
Karen in your prayers.
[Father] Is someone in here?
Bless me Father for I have sinned.
[Father] We're only hearing the children this morning.
Bless me Father for I have sinned.
Please Father I need confession.
Father, please.
Please hear me
Father, I'm troubled.
[Father] I have time.
I lost my temper, I got angry with the Monsignor and I neglected my morning prayers.
[Father] Oh, this can't be the reason you wanted confession this morning.
Oh no Father, there is something.
[Father] Yes?
I know you, you're a good woman.
It can't be as bad as you think.
I lose patience with the Monsignor.
Sometimes I wish Father, oh I can remember when everyone respected him so much.
[Father] I understand, it's not easy to see someone we love suffer.
No, you don't understand.
Sometimes I think that it would even be better if God, oh, it is a sin to think such thoughts?
[Father] No, it's not a sin.
You've devoted so much of yourself to us it's only natural that you should want God to spare us from pain.
Yes, Father.
[Father] You have great faith.
Now it's because of this that you can look forward to death as a resolution.
Yes, Father.
[Father] Now, there's no greater reward than to spend eternity with our Lord.
Yes, Father.
I only wish you'd come to me sooner about this.
Oh, so do I Father.
[Father] There's no need to come to confession for this.
Oh.
[Father] When you're upset come see me.
I am your confessor but
I'm also your friend.
Oh, thank you Father.
I'm sorry to bother you Mrs. Tredoni.
Father's not here.
No, I'm looking for Mr. Spages.
I knew he had to drop Tom's car off.
I didn't see him.
I'm very sorry, I'm cooking supper you'll have to excuse...
No, but Dom was supposed to pick me up this morning and I haven't heard from him.
I thought maybe he was with Tom.
Well, could I wait for a little while.
Suit yourself.
Maybe he won't be back so soon.
Do you think maybe there could be something wrong with the phone?
I tried to call several times this morning, there was no answer.
I was out.
You can turn on the light and there are some magazines.
Thank you.
I made you some coffee.
Oh thank you.
It's in the kitchen.
Sit down.
This is really very nice of you.
I didn't mean to put you to any trouble.
It's no trouble.
Aren't you going to have any?
I make it a rule not to have a coffee after breakfast.
[Catherine] I know this is silly of me,
I really should go home.
I don't know why I'm so worry.
I just can't imagine where he could be.
Maybe you were afraid that
God will send St. Michael to take another of your loved ones.
When St Michael took my little girl
I only thought of how cruel God was.
Mrs. Tredoni I'm sorry.
I never knew you had a little girl.
God took her from me the day of her first communion.
Don't you see?
He waited until then to teach me that children pay for the sins of their parents.
And then I was sent here to look after Father, not you.
[Father] Mrs. Tredoni?
It's Tom.
Tom.
Tom.
[Father] Catherine, what are you doing here?
I've been looking for you all afternoon.
[Catherine] Where's Dom?
[Father] There's been an accident.
Dom?
[Catherine] Oh God, no.
The left humerus is fractured, the left clavicle is fractured, contusions and abrasions of the thorax.
Have you heard from his wife yet?
No, not yet.
[Detective Brennan]
He give any indication that he knew something, anything?
Last time I saw him I got him a list of the families that bought school coats.
He was convinced that Alice had confused Karen with somebody else.
Because of Annie's attitude he suspected his niece Angela.
We never did find out where that kid was at the time of the murder.
Brennan, yeah?
You won't believe this, I found a cross lodged in his throat.
It had to have been worn by the killer.
It wasn't forced down his throat he bit down on it, there are teeth marks all over it.
[Detective Brennan] See if it matches the description of the one belonging to Karen Spages.
[Father] The train's gonna be at least a half hour late.
What'll I do about Alice?
Let's go get her, there's no need to stay here.
I'm not gonna tell her just yet.
She's been without a father for a long time.
I'm afraid to take him away from her so soon.
[Father] You're wrong, I think you should tell her.
I've lost control of my life Tom.
I can't.
[Father] Death does this to people.
Well haven't I had more than my share?
There's no such thing as share Catherine.
I'm frightened.
Maybe I should leave her here at least she's safe.
Don't be ridiculous
Cai, she needs you now.
Police will watch you both, you,
I promise you have nothing to fear.
For how long?
What happens if they don't find the murderer?
Alice is waiting.
Where's daddy?
He had to go back.
[Alice] How come?
Let's go home.
We'll talk about it later.
He didn't even say goodbye.
Please don't feel that way.
He kept his promise to you.
It's because of him you're coming home.
Catherine.
Catherine.
Are you in the mirror too?
Some the gate.
Who's there?
Who's there?
[Police Radio Voiceover]
Five three, eighth avenue.

Affirmative, five three, looking for a diamond at this time.

[Police Radio
Voiceover] 10-4, 31.
Two additional units by him South.
What were you doing in there?
Just saying hello to Mr. Alphonso.
I'm glad you did that, it was a nice thing to do.
Alice.
Let's stop by aunt Annie's on the way to mass.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Hey, you little bitch.

She's inside, Father
Pat's watching her.
Let's go.
Wait a minute, she's too close to Catherine and Alice.
She sees her there's no telling what she'll do.
Now, it's almost time for communion.
Come with me into the sacristy when she comes up to receive
I know I can get her to come with Father Pat and me.
What if she doesn't come up?
Look, I know her, she'll come.
She hasn't missed.
I want to have a marksman in the balcony.
Not in my church,
I can handle her.
She wouldn't do anything to me.
Okay Father we'll play it your way but my men will be covering all the exits.
Nothing'll happen, she'll come.
[Detective Spina]
Let's go Father.
Later.
Faster.
[Father] Please come with me Mrs. Tredoni.
I want communion Father.
I'm sorry Mrs. Tredoni,
I can't give it to you now.
I promised the police you'd come with
Father Pat and me.
But you give it to that whore!

Oh. Thanks.
Merci...
- Did you get your bum pinched?
- No, that's Italy!
- They'll do anything in Italy.
- Oh? What are we doing in France then?
Hey, I must say, this is the best place we've hit so far.
It's not exactly swinging, but it is dangling.
Hey, why don't we... why don't we stay here for a day or two?
No. I think we should get as far as we can in the first week, don't you?
I mean, if we push off now and don't bother about lunch, we should be in Saint Louvier by tonight.
- Hey, do you think he's French?
- Hmm?
Yes, I suppose so.
Oh, he's very dishy.
Oh, he's... he's definitely French.
I mean... he's got that look.
What do you think?
Smile, please.
He's shy too!
Cathy... Saint Louvier?
It's...
- It's miles!
- No. It's no further than we did yesterday.
- There's nowhere if we want to stop!
- There's bound to be a few places not marked.
Okay, if you say so.
Well, come on. We're not going to see much of the country sitting here.
Oh, no?
Right. Are you ready then?
Mm-hm. Oh, uh...
I want to spend a penny.
- Do you want to go?
- No, I'll wait.
Yeah. Think I'll wait. I don't fancy that.
Especially after yesterday.
Well, I did warn you, didn't I?
I thought you were joking.
I mean... standing up!
He's very fancy-able!
Cathy, he heard you!
- I wonder what they're doing now?
- Hmm?
- Back at the hospital.
- Oh, Matron will be on her morning rounds.
- Anne went to Spain.
- Mm, I know.
She and a girlfriend, and that boyfriend of hers.
You know, the one with the big nose.
- Yeah, they've got a boat there.
- Have they?
- This is going to take all day.
- Well, that's what we've got, all day.
Anyway, it's fantastic country.
Fantastically boring!
- Do you think he's following us?
- He was here first.
- I think it's you he fancies.
- Oh, really, for God's sake!
This place we're heading for, um, Saint Louvier...
- Hmm.
- Is it a big town?
It depends on what you mean by big.
Well, um...
A café, ten people...
Yeah, and a sit-down loo.
Hey, swinging Landron!
We could have stopped for a while in that village back there.
No, it's miles from anywhere.
There'll be another place further on.
There's bound to be.
It didn't have to be further on. I mean, there were two places we could have stopped at.
We're not supposed to be stopping.
It's not that kind of a holiday.
I don't know what kind of a holiday it's meant to be!
I mean, it's just miles of road, all the same.
We never see anybody.
We don't meet anybody.
We've only been going a couple of days.
It's so boring! We don't do anything.
- We will.
- You keep saying that!
- When we get to Saint Louvier...
- Well, I've got to where I'm going.
Why here?
Seems as good as anywhere.
- I'm tired.
- All right, but just for a little while.
- Jane?
- Hmm?
That delivery last week, you know, the difficult one.
The baby died, you know.
It was only one day old.
I don't suppose they know anything.
Feel anything, I mean... when they're one day old, do they?
Whatever made you think of that?
I don't know.
Day like this.
Seems such a pity.
She wasn't even married.
Do you ever think about being married?
Hmm? Settling down with one man?
Yeah, I suppose that's what it's all about.
It's so forever.
I mean, I haven't met anyone yet that I've fancied.
I mean, not in that way, and there's still so many things I want to do.
Cathy?
Cathy, we ought to be making a move.
We've still got an awful long way to go.
We ought to go now.
- Told you, I'm tired.
- Oh, come on.
Look, you wanted to stop and we've stopped.
You've had your rest.
I'm still tired.
Besides, I like it, lying here in the sun.
- Well...
- That's what we came away for.
- We can't lie here all day.
- Why not?
Because you can't!
We're miles from anywhere.
That was your idea.
Keep off the main roads, see the real France.
Cathy, we've still got a long way to go, and I don't particularly want to be on the roads after dark.
- Cathy, we've got to go now!
- We haven't got to go anywhere.
This is as much my holiday as it is yours.
If I want to spend a bit of it lying in the sun, then I will.
Sick and tired of you ordering me about.
- Ordering?
- Yes, ordering, bloody ordering!
"Can't stop here. You must go there."
No sooner do we sit down in one place then we're off to the next.
- We planned the route together.
- Yeah.
But it doesn't have to bet he Bible, does it?
I mean, we can change plans, can't we?
I'm tired, and I'm going to sit here until I'm not tired.
If you don't like it you can go.
Go on without me.
Oh, don't be bloody silly!
How can I do that?
I'll catch you up.
How far would you get on your own?
Saint Louvier's miles away!
There'll be other villages.
You said so yourself.
Cathy, there might not be.
In that case, I'll go back.
Oh, I see. So that's what this is all about, is it, that man back there?
Oh!
Now who's being bloody silly?
Anyway, what's wrong with it?
We came here to enjoy ourselves, have a good time.
I'm not a bloody nun, you know!
I like to talk to people once in a while.
And you're no company.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm no company.
Maybe we shouldn't have come away together in the first place!
Maybe we shouldn't.
You're no fun. You spoil everything.
Oh, you're not exactly the life and soul of the party, you know!
You haven't stopped moaning since we got here.
Either you're too hot or too tired, or you don't like the food!
Why don't you go, just go?
Yes, I think I will.
I think I'll do just that!
You obviously don't need me.
Get your great fat legs out of the way!
- Well, I'm going.
- Go on then, go! I won't miss you.
- Goodbye!
- Bon bloody voyage!
Oh!
Bonjour, madame.
Uh...
Citron pressé, s'il vous plaît.
Lemon?
Merci, madame.
Sorry?
Êtes-vous seule?
Vous? Seule?
Alone? Ah, yes, yes, I am.
Mademoiselle, cette route, très mauvaise.
Ah!
Bad road.
Huh?
Bad road.
Jane?
Is that you, Jane?
Stop! Please!
Dear God, no.
Cathy?
Cathy?
Cathy?
Uh...
Looking for my friend.
Mon ami. Uh...
The, uh, fille avec moi.
I think we'd better speak in English.
Your friend?
Yes.
The girl with blonde hair?
Yes. We had a row and I left her here.
And now she's not here?
Maybe she's hiding from you?
To teach you a lesson.
- If you like we can, uh...
- Oh, no, please don't bother.
I'm sure she's gone back to the village.
Did you see her?
No.
No, but, uh... possibly after I had ridden past.
It's possible.
Oh, she forgot this.
Then we'd better return it, eh?
Come on, I'll take you.
- No, it's quite all right. I've got my bicycle...
- No, no, it's no trouble. No trouble at all.
Leave it there, leave it there.
It's much faster this way.
My name is Paul, by the way.
What's yours?
- Jane.
- Jane.
Lucky I turned back.
Why did you?
An impulse. I'm an impulsive fellow.
Hold me.
Sit down. I'll ask.
What did he say?
He hasn't seen her, but then he's been inside most of the time.
Well, what else did he say?
Well, uh...
She hasn't come back this way.
She's been sitting here more than an hour and hasn't seen anyone.
Would you like a drink?
Oh, yes!
- She's gone the other way.
- I would have seen her.
That lady must be mistaken.
Cathy must have come through here.
When you spoke to him just now, didn't he mention "meurtre"?
That's French for murder, isn't it?
What did he mean?
Your accent is terrible.
What did he mean?
You know, I think I was right.
She's still in that wood somewhere, hiding from you.
Cathy wouldn't do a thing like that.
I think I'd better look anyway.
You stay here. Wait for me here.
Excuse me.
Monsieur?
Uh, when you were speaking to my friend outside...
Out there, just now.
..did you mention, uh, murder?
Murder? Meur... Meurtre?
- Ah, meurtre! Oh!
- Oui! Oui, oui, oui.
Meurtre, meurtre! Oui, oui.
Excusez-moi. Um...
Possible for you to speak slower?
Uh...
Um...
Ah! Pas vite, oui?
- Ah, pas vite.
- Oui.
Le meurtre.
Pardon, monsieur.
Oui, oui. Je ne compris pas.
Non compris.
He's telling you about the murder that took place here.
It caused quite a scandal at the time.
It happened about three years ago.
About this time of the year, too.
Poor girl.
She's buried in the cemetery out there.
Excuse me.
May I beg a lift?
- How far do you want to go?
- To the Gendarme's house.
Get in.
Thank you.
We don't want to lose you.
Morbid interest?
Yes, I suppose so.
Loathsome business.
She was young and pretty.
They always are, I suppose.
Loathsome business.
It was more than murder, if you know what I mean.
Still, she was asking for trouble.
Alone on the road.
- She wasn't a local girl then?
- Tourist.
Hiking her way across.
Loathsome business.
Sex...
Loathsome.
You must be surprised to find an old British buzzard like me here?
Everyone is.
I'm a teacher.
French literature, of all things.
- How about you?
- Hmm?
- Where are you from?
- Oh, Nottingham.
Lovely place.
I've never actually been there, but I'm told it's a lovely place.
Famous for its pretty girls.
I can see why.
Did they ever catch the man?
Hmm?
Oh, that. No, they never did.
Big hoo-ha at the time.
They pulled in Jules Lassal.
Kept at him for a couple of days.
Poor old Lassal.
They never did nail anyone.
Personally, I think it was one of her own kind.
Another nomad passing through.
I've been here 15 years.
They won't get rid of me now.
- I like it here.
- Oh, please, may we stop? My bike.
Thank you.
- Funny.
- Mmm?
That's where it happened.
Those woods there.
Somewhere round there.
Thanks very much.
I live about six miles further on.
Red tile roof to the side of the road.
Can't miss it.
It's a big house.
Much too big for me on my own.
If you should get stuck for somewhere to stay, well, I can always offer you a bed.
Thank you, I'll remember that.
Bye.
Monsieur, I'm looking for the Gendarme.
Have you seen him?
The Gendarme?
Compris?
Gendarme?
Monsieur?
Mademoiselle, voulez Gendarme?
Yes, do you know where I can find him?
Uh, pourquoi? Uh... Why?
It's my friend, she's, um, missing.
Gone.
Allez-vous en!
- Go!
- Why?
Trouble.
Très trouble!
Madame, I don't know what you're talking about.
I just want to find the Gendarme.
Mais Gendarme c'est trouble, très trouble!
Mon Dieu, mademoiselle!
Go!
Madame?
Oui?
Are you Lassal?
Mais oui.
Je suis Madame Lassal.
There's no one there.
Keep away from me. You lied to me.
You lied! There was a murder.
Are you going to deny that?
No. I won't deny it.
There was a murder.
Victim, Jan Hele. Dutch national.
Female, 22 years old, unmarried.
Factory worker from Sluis.
Severe injuries to the upper cranial cavity.
Extensive lacerations and abrasions to the breasts, the loins and the lower torso.
Sexually assaulted.
Cause of death - asphyxia through strangulation.
Her hair was bright blonde, like that of your friend.
I worked on the case.
Detective Paul Salmont.
I am with the Sûreté.
Why didn't you tell me before?
I hoped it might not be necessary.
I didn't want to frighten you.
You expect me to believe that?
Then what about the film?
There was some in the camera,
I know there was.
- And you took it. You must have...
- Of course I took it.
Exhibit number one.
Evidence.
Evidence? Of what?
I didn't want to frighten you.
Cathy?
Back there I found something.
No, not that, but something you could identify. Will you?
It's further on.
Frightened?
You don't have to be.
- You're with the Sûreté?
- Uh-huh.
- Their headquarters are in Paris, aren't they?
- Yes.
That's a long way from here.
- Did they call you in specially?
- No.
They didn't call me in at all.
But you said you worked on the case.
So I did.
But not officially. Academically.
The case has a fascination for me.
I know it.
What is it you say? I know it by heart.
That's right, I know it by heart.
Why this particular case?
It's murder.
The most unpredictable of crimes.
It's unsolved.
Also, I was here when it happened.
- You were here?
- Mm, in the area, touring, on holiday.
Of course I couldn't interfere with the local investigations.
I'm not important enough for that, but
I could see where they were going wrong.
I couldn't do anything, but I formed my own conclusions.
- What are you doing here now?
- Touring.
Holiday. I come here every year.
Since it happened, anyway.
Now you have that same look on your face as my friends have.
They think I'm crazy too.
Maybe I am, just a little, but...
- I have a feeling... a feeling...
- You think it's going to happen again, don't you?
- You understand that?
- Is that why you followed Cathy and me?
You did follow us, didn't you?
I don't know. I honestly don't know.
Cathy's got bright blonde hair.
That other girl had bright blonde hair too.
You think she's dead, don't you?
Cathy's not dead, she couldn't be.
It was just a silly argument.
It was nothing, really.
She's hiding from me, trying to scare me.
She's probably watching us now and laughing at us.
Cathy's not dead!
Come.
We'll see.
You and Cathy, you were... you are very close?
Not much further.
Why did you take that film?
- I told you.
- I know you told me.
What do you expect to find on it?
Probably nothing.
It's Cathy's film. It belongs to her.
I'll keep it for her.
Very well.
Jane?
Do you speak English?
A little.
Good.
Thank God!
I...
I found these. They're Cathy's.
They're my friend's, she's missing.
Her name is Cathy Mercer.
I left her in the woods back there.
When I went back to find her, she'd gone.
I've looked everywhere,
I've asked everybody, but no one's seen her.
She's just disappeared. I can't find her.
What is her description?
She's blonde, very blonde.
But that's not all of it.
There's a man, Salmont, Paul Salmont.
He says he's a detective with the Sûreté.
Sûreté?
That's what he says, but he's lying.
I know he's lying.
He's done something to Cathy or he knows where she is.
Slower.
A man with the Sûreté?
- That's what he says.
- Paul...?
Salmont.
You've never heard of him, have you?
Salmont? No.
I knew it.
I knew he was lying!
Something terrible's happened to
Cathy and he's responsible for it.
That's why he made up that story about finding something in the wood back there.
C'est moi!
C'est mon pere.
My father.
This man...
You say he find something?
No, he said, but there wasn't anything.
It was just a trick.
- What he say he find?
- He didn't. There wasn't anything to find.
Only those, and I found those.
- Where?
- In the woods back there. They're Cathy's.
Ici?
- Les bois?
- Les bois. The woods, yes.
This man remains?
He is still there?
I don't know. I suppose he must be, yes. I don't know.
I will find out.
Thank you.
You, uh, wait here, please.
Sorry?
I don't understand what you're saying.
You're deaf?
Oh!
Oui, oui. Sourd, sourd, très sourd!
Très sourd!
Très sourd.
C'était la guerre!
- La guerre?
- La première!
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
- The war?
- Oui, oui! C'est ca! La guerre!
Regardez!
Souvenirs de la guerre.
C'est à moi.
Regardez.
À la sourd!
Oui, il va pleuvoir!
Rain? No, surely not.
Oui, oui, la pluie, la pluie!
Regardez la!
Il va pleuvoir.
- Did you find anything?
- Rien.
- Nothing.
- But you went into the woods?
Empty.
I find nothing.
I check further on.
She didn't go that way.
I would have seen her.
Perhaps she, uh...
- Hitched?
- Hitched a lift.
You did not think of that, huh?
You wait.
- Wait?
- Here.
Monsieur?
Monsieur?
Bonjour.
- Lassal est là?
- Non.
Hello?
Jane?
Jane!
I want to see you... face to face.
Then we can talk and I can explain everything.
Jane!
Jane.
Jane!
Jane?
I know you are there, Jane.
Come out, damn you!
Come out... and I'll show you.
Jane?
Jane!
Jane!
I want to help, that's all.
I want to help.
But I need your help!
Because I found something.
A bicycle.
A Bermuda with a red frame.
I found it.
A Bermuda, red frame, three-speed gears, saddle bags. I found it.
Jane?
Jane.
Jane.
Why hide from me?
From me!
Jane?
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
Uhh!
She's dead.
Cathy's dead!
And he is too!
I... I killed him.
- He's over there.
- Ah, la, la, la, la.
He's dead and I did it!
I did it! I killed him!
I'll show you.
Oh!
Tarr's cables to the Circus were detailed and specific.
London Station required him to submit copious background on Irina.
Names of former contacts, acquaintances inside Moscow Centre.
There should be a file of some size and we need to see it.
That's Circus material.
I can only deliver from the Minister.
I know that look.
I'm breaking into the Circus, am I?
- Playing Burglar Bill.
- If you wouldn't mind.
While you're enjoying yourself, I shall visit
Oxford to look up an old, invaluable friend.
Please, don't take any unnecessary risks.
(SMILEY) Assume, Peter, the Circus has the dogs on you 24 hours a day.
Think of it as a foreign country.
Hello, Bryant.
Hello. Nice to see you again, sir.
Just a moment, please.
Mr Guillam, sir.
Mr Lauder Strickland's expecting you.
He'll meet you on the 5th floor.
Right.
Thanks.
- About time someone oiled this.
- We keep asking.
You can talk till you're blue in the face!
Well met, Peter. Greetings.
A trifle late, but never mind.
Sorry, Lauder. You have to make allowances for country yokels.
- How long have you had that monster?
- You really are a stranger, aren't you?
It saves man hours. Fantastic. Quite fantastic.
- Sorry, terribly sorry.
- Hello, Bill.
What the hell are YOU doing here, you pariah?
He wants to buy a diplomatic courier.
He needs to wash some dirty money.
That's a job for Banking Section, so we're sorting out the tangle.
He knows it has to be cleared here.
He told me the papers were routed to you.
- They're probably in your in-tray now, Bill.
- They had better be, Peter.
Lock up the spoons. Scalphunters will have the gold out of your teeth!
Lock up the girls, as well...if they'll let you!
There you go, Bert. Keys of the city.
London Station couldn't be in better hands.
Everything's a lot tighter here these days, Guillam.
Hey, Lauder, hold on!
Have you seen bloody Bill anywhere?
Indeed I have seen Bill. We were having a brief word back down the corridor.
- He's wanted urgently.
- Immediately. We've put out an alert for him.
I suspect he may well be on his way to you at this moment.
Peter...hello.
Hi.
Thanks for the glad hand.
I did wipe the cow dung off my boots.
What's the joke, Roy?
No joke, Peter, old lad.
Just...surprised to see you, that's all.
- We're used to having this floor to ourselves.
- Like to see my pass, Toby?
- How are you keeping?
- I wintered very well.
You know what it's like in Brixton these days.
Plenty of Ludo, ping pong.
- Normally I have my afternoon zizz now.
- Off with you, Peter.
- Don't waste Lauder's time.
- No, sir. Sorry, sir.
- (DOG BARKS)
- Shut up, Flush! Stop it.
- (DOG BARKS)
- Stop it, boy. It's only a dunderhead.
Flush, shut up!
George Smiley!
Oh, but you lovely, darling man!
You haven't come to sell me a hoover!
You're my gorgeous George!
- Connie.
- Oh, George.
Jingle, darling, could you possibly make it tomorrow? Don't be cross.
It isn't often my oldest, oldest lover comes to see me.
Oh, George, if only I'D seen you first.
I'll give you a whole hour all to yourself.
Honestly I will, darling.
One of my dunderheads.
I will teach...
..I don't know why.
Oh, George, of all the lovely, darling men I ever knew.
He walked, Flush. Don't you see his shoes?
Oh...bless you, darling.
God bless.
Did he walk alone, Flush?
Not accompanied, were we?
Quite alone, Connie.
So...what does George want from Connie?
The bad boy!
Her memory.
To go over some very old ground, Connie.
Hear that, Flush? First, they chuck us out with an old bone, then they come begging to us.
I was the best Head of Research the Circus ever had! Everyone knew that!
And what did they say the day they gave me the chop?
That personnel cow! "You're losing your sense of proportion, Connie.
"Time you got out into the real world."
I hate the real world!
I like the Circus and my lovely boys!

..in the Ukraine.
Graduate of Leningrad State University.
Height five-foot-ten.
Colour of eyes, green. Colour of hair, black.
Married, but unaccompanied by wife, and a six-cylinder
Karla-trained hood if ever I saw one!
But don't tell Percy Alleline or Toby Esterhase.
Oh, no,
Aleksey Aleksandrovich was as pure as the driven snow.
He was Persil white, wasn't he, Flush?
And Connie's an old silly.
If she doesn't lay off and do as she's told, she'll have to pack her bags and go.
He's come alive - Polyakov.
Just as you predicted.
'Course he has! Of course he has!
I knew it in my bones!
The day he arrived, I thought, "Hello, I'll have some fun with YOU." Tough as a button!
Cultural Attaché? Balls!
Army written all over him.
But not declared, George, not a mention.
Oh, he had a lovely voice. Mellow, like yours.
I used to play the tapes over and over just to bathe in it.
Bottom pincher, too. I just know.
Not that we ever caught him at it.
We might have if Tobe had played along and offered him a bum, but tiny Tobe wouldn't.
Eight years.
I watched Pretty Polly for eight years.
Then last Remembrance Day, I got him.
There he was, that smashing
November morning, at the wreath laying.
We photographed his medals - two gallantry and four campaign.
Oh, yes. Aleks Polyakov was a star soldier just as I'd told them, and not a word.
So I said to Toby, "Listen, you two-faced ferret,
"ego has got the better part of cover and that's nothing new.
"Now will you turn Pretty Polly inside out for me?
"Because Connie's little hunch has turned up trumps."
What did Toby Esterhase say?
Oh, I got the dead-fish voice.
- "Tell Percy Alleline. Percy's in charge."
- And then?
"Not every ex-warrior's a Karla agent," says Percy.
I said, "Listen, Percy,
Polyakov's running an English mole."
So I get the rude letter. "Stop it or else."
I wrote at the bottom - "Yes, repeat no!"
So...here we are...
..Flush and me.
Please kiss me, George.
Hey-ho. Halcyon days.
- Did I start the landslide, George?
- You were always dead right, Connie.
- Is George now picking up the pieces?
- Something of the sort.
Poor loves. Trained to Empire, trained to rule the waves.
Englishmen could be proud then.
They could, George.
All gone.
Taken away.
Bye-bye, world.
If it's bad, George...
..don't come back.
Promise?
I want to remember you just as you were.
My lovely, lovely boys.
Promise?
All right, Lauder, I'll just have to wait for the wheels to turn.
I don't need a pass to use the gent's, do I?

# I gotta love one man till I die
# Can't help loving that man of mine #
(MAN) Stop that moaning!
Pages had been removed with a razor blade.
No mention of Ricki Tarr's cable from Lisbon.
No Irina, no Boris, no Tarr.
There's a note scribbled on the next page.
"All inquiries to Head of London Station."
It's in Toby Esterhase's handwriting.
The janitor's attendance list has also been removed.
Nothing to tell us who was duty officer... or even who was in the building.
Connie's appraisal matches the story Irina gave Ricki Tarr.
The implications, the indications, are that Karla has managed to build himself a cadre of senior men placed about the globe who work exclusively to him at Moscow Centre.
- Polyakov is Karla's executant in London.
- You offer that as a working hypothesis?
Operation Witchcraft, that vital flow of Russian intelligence which happily came Alleline's way.
"Supplementary estimates to the Treasury.
"Special accommodation in London."?
"Wider exploitation.
"See also Secret Annexe." May I see it?
- The Minister keeps it in his safe.
- Do you know the combination?
- Certainly not.
- What's the title of this unobtainable document?
It doesn't have one. It's highly secret and we've kept the readership to a minimum.
The supplier of the Witchcraft material is Merlin. Does the file give his identity?
Don't be ridiculous. The Minister wouldn't want to know and Alleline wouldn't want to tell him.
- What does "wider exploitation" mean?
- I refuse to be interrogated.
Why do you waste your time pursuing this?
I should have you cleared before you see this.
- Witchcraft cleared?
- Yes, George.
Do we have a list of people who've been cleared in that way?
I hope you're not going fey, George.
Please, stick with the primary problem - the mole Gerald - instead of rootling around in extraneous matters.
This is no time to be whimsical.
Are you off? You won't forget Prideaux?
Anything you can get on him, even scraps, would help.
He has a point, George.
Witchcraft and Merlin, Polyakov and the mole.
Prideaux getting himself shot up on some wild goose chase of Control's in Czechoslovakia.
- You think it all connects?
- I think I am not the first to make this journey of exploration.
I believe Control was here before me.
He might even have made the full distance but for the bullets in Prideaux's back.
"There are three of them and Alleline."
Control's words.
He meant Operation Witchcraft.
Merlin's minders or inventors or programmers or marionettes...or what?
Why was Control so hostile to Alleline?
Percy wasn't a fool.
Percy can flirt, Peter. And Control hadn't reckoned on the power of the Alleline lobby.
- Who were they?
- Golfers.
"Golfers and Conservatives."
That's what Control said to me.
I got a call from Control one day - very sharp, very combative.
"George, come in here or there'll be bloodshed."
Brother Percy's trying to twist my tail.
Take a look at this nonsense.
Top-level Soviet naval despatch.
Specially prepared for the Soviet High Command...
..isn't it, Percy?
An appreciation of a naval exercise in the Med and the Black Sea, of which our sailors have been screaming for details.
- Haven't they, Percy?
- Topicality's always suspect.
Yes, George.
Would you like to repeat that for Percy?
- Who made the translation?
- God made it, didn't he, Percy?
- Don't ask him. He won't tell you.
- Shore-to-sea strike power.
Radio activation of enemy alert procedures.
This is hardly my territory.
Don't let that worry you. Total ignorance of subject matter doesn't bother Percy.
- Whose initials are these?
- Zharov. Admiral, Black Sea Fleet.
- What do our own evaluators say?
- They've not seen it.
What's more, they're not going to.
However, Lilley of Naval Intelligence has passed a preliminary opinion, has he not, Percy?
Percy showed it to him last night.
- Over a pink gin, was it, Percy?
- At the Admiralty.
Note that, George. They battened down the hatches for Percy.
Brother Lilley telephoned me half an hour ago to congratulate me.
He believes this material to be neither a plant nor chickenfeed, but gold dust, and he seeks our permission to...
Percy's, I suppose I should say...
..to apprise his fellow Sea Lords of its conclusions.
Quite impossible. It's for his eyes only for another couple of weeks.
- It's so hot, you see, George.
- But where does it come from?
- Who's the case officer?
- You'll enjoy this.
Source Merlin has access to the most sensitive levels of Soviet policy-making.
We've dubbed his product Witchcraft.
Ask him who "we" are, George.
Merlin is the fruit of a long cultivation by certain people in this service.
People who are bound to me as I am to them.
People not entertained by the failure rate about this place.
There's been too much blown, too much lost, wasted.
Too many scandals. I've said so many times.
I could've talked to the wind for all the heed HE paid me.
"He" means me, George.
The ordinary principles of security have gone to the wall in this service.
It's all divide and rule, stimulated from the top.
- Me again.
- We're losing our livelihood, our self-respect.
We've had enough.
We've had a bellyful, in fact. Please.
Like everybody's who's ever had enough, he wants more.
"This service."
Alleline would sell his mother for a knighthood and "this service" for a seat in the Lords.
- Suppose Merlin's genuine?
- Suppose Merlin would pick Percy?!
It seems somebody has.
I gather Percy's under the impression he picked himself and a whole team.
You're sure he left you out, are you, George?
- What are you going to do about it?
- Depends on "it".
I'll wait for "it" to show itself.
In the meantime, I see nothing to deal with except Percy's envious eye on my chair.
And I've put my thumb in that optic before.
- George, tittle-tattle Tuesday again?
- Hello, Percy.
(PERCY) Toby, Roy.
This time.
Oh, Lor'! I thought it would be half over by now.
Got a rabbit to pull out of your hat, Percy?
You've got that Britain-can-make-it look.
Very intimidating. Should we have brought our sandwiches?
I'll be brief, Bill, so long as I'm not obstructed.
I'm sorry. Traffic. I should've walked.
I think you and Percy between you are contriving to keep me off the streets.
They're all here now, sir.
Would you go in, please, gentlemen?
How often do I have to emphasise the extreme sensitivity of the source of the Witchcraft product?
There is no existing method of Whitehall distribution to meet the case.
Need I remind you of that disgraceful incident when an Under-Secretary...
Albeit it overworked, so be it.
But the fact remains the man actually gave his despatch box key to his personal assistant.
We simply cannot afford that kind of ludicrous insecurity when we are handling Witchcraft.
Now...
..I have already discussed the problem with Lilley of Naval Intelligence.
He is prepared to put at our disposal a special main reading room in the Admiralty main building, where Witchcraft material can be seen and watched over by a senior janitor of this service.
Wouldn't you rather have Securicor (?)
The reading room will be known for cover purposes as the conference room of the Adriatic
Working Party - the AWP room, for short.
Thank you.
Customers with reading rights will not have passes, since these can be too accessible.
Instead, they will appear on a special list with photographs.
They will identify themselves personally to MY janitor.
- Whose janitor, Percy?
- He's already got his own personal wizard.
The odd commissionaire seems modest enough domestic staff.
- Allowing that all this is necessary...
- Essential.
..my Minister will want to know more about the cost.
It must appear to be borne by the Admiralty, even if you reimburse covertly.
Of course. The reading room will have to be extensively rebuilt to begin with.
Now, I'd like to call your attention to the Foreign Office comment on the most recent Witchcraft product.
And I quote, "This document sheds an extraordinary sidelight
"on Soviet aggressive thinking."
Does that mean they like it, Percy?
Do you like it, Bill?
It's from the very heart of your territory.
In 25 years, I haven't laid hands on anything of that quality.
Unless I'm mistaken, nor have our American cousins.
Anyone taking it to Washington could drive a hard bargain.
- Early days, Bill.
- Agreed.
But if Merlin maintains that standard, we can buy whatever's in the Yanks' shop.
I don't think Control's going to play.
That would rule me out, as well, of course.
- Percy will get his reading room.
- Yes.
And after that, I suppose anything's possible.
Did you want to ask me something?
I'm afraid he's not seeing anyone today.
Again?
I'm being asked why he's cancelled the Tuesday conferences.
I can't add anything to his memorandum, even for you.
- Even if I could, Mr Smiley...
- No, of course.
I was rather hoping, before I set off on this Hong Kong trip...
Well, when I get back, perhaps he'll have got through that little lot.
Now there's a committee. The Minister is in the chair, Alleline's vice-chairman.
Merlin's become an industry.
It's THE industry and I'm not employed.
- You won't even read Alleline's reports.
- I haven't time.
Buying their way in with counterfeit money. Tell them that.
Tell them anything. I need time.
There are three of them and Alleline.
Sweat them. Tempt them.
Bully them. Anything.
Give them what ever they eat. I need time.
Prompt as ever, Mr Smiley.
- How are your children, Toby?
- Doing terribly well.
The boy's at Westminster. Is that right?
You daughter's probably left school by now.
- First-year medical student. Loves it.
- Good for her.
Toby...I have to ask you this.
Sorry to come prying.
Your department's behind with its work sheets. Two months almost.
Now, why is that?
It's not lamplighter style.
We're not infallible, George.
Two months? Well, I won't question it.
Is it terribly important?
If you say it is, I'll see it's dealt with.
The question is WHY, Toby.
- Let me be blunt.
- Not YOUR style, George.
I'm allowed to say that, surely?
I am, after all, one of your oldest protégés.
Vienna was a long time ago.
You haven't been using your staff for any special jobs? Either at home or abroad?
The kind of special jobs which, for reasons of security, you haven't felt able to mention in your returns.
Who would I do that for?
In my book, that's completely illegal.
Well, if Percy Alleline, for example, ordered you to do something and not record it, that would put you in a difficult position.
- What sort of something?
- Clear a letter box, prime a safe house.
Watch someone's back. Spike an embassy.
It's all lamplighter work.
If Percy told you to do it, you might reasonably assume he was acting on instructions from the fifth floor.
I do like the service. I may be sentimental about it, but I prefer to stay in it.
Now, you understand that. You of all people.
My problem is promotion.
I mean, the absence of it.
I've so many years' seniority that I feel quite embarrassed when these young fellows ask me to take orders from them.
Who, Toby?
Which young fellows? Roy Bland? Percy?
Would you call Percy young?
Who?
When you're overdue for promotion and working hard, anyone looks young who is above you on the ladder.
- Have you been taking orders?
- You know the line of command, George.
Perhaps Control could move you up a few rungs.
Well, you know, actually...
..I'm not sure he's able to these days...are you?
- So what's the deal?
- There isn't a deal, Roy, really.
It's just that Control feels the present situation is unhealthy.
He doesn't like to see you getting mixed up with a cabal. Nor do I.
- So what's the deal?
- What do you want?
What about 5,000 quid out of the reptile fund for starters?
- Then a house and a car?
- And the kid to Eton.
- Your father would turn in his grave.
- Let him rotate, the old Commie thug.
If there's no deal, George, you'll have to tell Control he can get stuffed.
I've paid, you see. You know that.
I don't know what the hell
I've bought with it, but I've paid a packet.
Poznan, Budapest, Prague, back to Poznan.
Have you ever been to Poznan?
Sofia, Kiev.
Two bloody nervous breakdowns and still between the shafts.
That's big money at any age...even yours.
No one can deny that, Roy.
And...you brought me in, remember.
If you think I'm going to the bad, you've only got yourself to blame.
You're an educated sort of a swine.
"An artist is a bloke who can hold two fundamentally opposing views
"and still function."
- Who dreamed that one up?
- Scott Fitzgerald.
Well, Fitzgerald knew a thing or two.
And I'm definitely functioning.
As a good socialist,
I'm going where the money is.
As a good capitalist,
I'm sticking with the revolution because, if you can't beat it, spy on it.
Don't look like that, George?
It's the name of the game these days.
You scratch my conscience,
I'll drive your Jag, right?
No. Did you get that from Haydon?
Is that one of Bill's jokes about materialist
England, the pigs-in-clover society?
- Don't you like it?
- Not much.
Of course there are acquisitive instincts in Western society.
They are offset against other concerns you won't find in...
Poznan, Budapest, Kiev, Sofia.
Tell me all about it, George.
I'm just saying that's England now, man.
All you have to do is look out the bloody window.
You're seen with Bill Haydon a great deal these days.
Jealous, George? You've got his job.
You're Control's High Chamberlain.
What more do you want?
Long as it lasts.
- They do say you write the reports.
- That's Roy's job.
No. Bland makes the translations.
YOU write the covering reports.
They're typed on your machine.
The material's not cleared for typists.
Percy Alleline won't do. Is that the premise?
Which means that Merlin won't do either.
Poor old Control. He is in a pickle.
Merlin would do if he were MY source, wouldn't he?
If dazzling bloody Bill had hooked a whacking big fish and wanted to play him alone, what would happen then?
Control would say, "That's very nifty of you,
Bill boy. You do it just the way you want.
"Have some filthy jasmine tea."
He'd be giving me a medal now...instead of sending you snooping round corridors.
We used to be rather a classy bunch.
Why are we so vulgar these days?
- He thinks Percy's on the make.
- So he is. I also want to be head boy.
And Toby and Roy have designs on your spot.
Since when was ambition an offence in our beastly outfit?
Is Ann at home?
Sent her out to play while you grill your old buddy.
- Who runs him, Bill?
- Percy? Who do you think?
Karla runs him. Stands out a mile.
Lower-class bloke with upper-class sources.
Must be a bounder.
- Bill...
- Percy's sold out to Karla. Only explanation.
- Percy's our house mole.
- I meant who runs Merlin?
Who is Merlin?
What's going on?
This is a Callot, isn't it?
- Nice, very nice.
- Bill.
Doesn't anyone think
MY nose should be out of joint?
I'm supposed to be in charge of the Russian target. Given it my best years.
Set up networks, talent-spotters, all mod cons.
You've all forgotten what it's like to run an operation where it takes three days to post a letter and you don't get an answer.
That's hardly fair to Control.
You know how he detests glamour-boy agents who hog the budget, how he hates "miracles" if they put the networks out of focus.
Pity he doesn't have the same hatred of failure.
Has he lived with it too long?
Face it, George, it's Percy.
Percy's success...it's thrown Control.
And me, a bit.
Trouble is, my networks haven't been good enough.
This is new.
I fancy this very much.
Ann gave it me.
- Making amends?
- Probably.
Must have been quite a sin.
How is she?
George...cut the cord.
Get away from Control.
He's cut you out of his life for weeks.
Despatching you with errands a probationer could handle.
What's he doing up there?
He's gone through files of Circus folk heroes from year minus-one
Half of them under the earth already.
Sniffing out the dirt to see who was pink, who was a queen.
He's given us all up.
- I don't think that's true.
- Senile paranoia. Control's going potty.
And he's also dying.
It's just a question of which gets him first.
And within six months of Bill Haydon's diagnosis,
Control was indeed dead.
And what killed him?
Operation Witchcraft or Operation Testify?
Neither.
Let's not be melodramatic.
Control would disapprove.
He died of old age.
A little early.
But Testify destroyed his function in life, which was a form of murder.
I don't have nearly enough on Testify, Peter.
Would you, please...er...?
Of course, George.

There seems to be an excessive delay, watson.
Waiting for the prince.
They can't begin until he arrives.
You know that.
"Punctuality," my dear fellow. Punctuality.
"The politeness of kings."
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
He seems to take a delight in keeping his subjects waiting.
I suppose, since after all he's only the prince of wales,
We should not expect the same degree of courtesy.
And since you're only the prince of detectives, holmes,
I don't think you should presume to criticize a man...
Who one day will be the king of england.
Well done, watson.
You've cut me to the quick.
Only the prince of detectives, you say?
Pray tell me, who is the king?
Lestrade, of course.
Good god.
Insulting the prince.
More respect is wanted.
If the prince wants more respect,
He should conduct his affairs with more discretion.
It's a damned disgrace.
On the contrary.
I prefer bad manners in the theater...
To acts of violence in the streets.
Hmph.
God save his royal highness!
- God save his royal highness!
Save his royal highness!
???? [ "God save the king" ]
Well done, old fella.
You saved the day.
Oh. Flower.
Murder in whitechapel!
Murder in whitechapel!
Whitechapel butcher strikes again!
Read all about it!
There you are, sir.
Read all about it!
[ Woman ] what are the police doing about it?
Cabby! I say, cabby!
Whitechapel butcher strikes again!
Brutal murder investigated!
Baker street.
221 "b."
Don't you think we should hire a closed carriage from now on, holmes?
Oh, i don't know.
It's quite invigorating.
Stirs the blood.
Nobody uses an open carriage in october, at night.
I do.
Spoken with the utmost humility, my dear holmes.
This makes three.
Three?
These women murdered in whitechapel.
There was that annie chapman, you remember?
And then there was polly--
...nichols.
Polly nichols, that's right.
And now here's a third, as yet unidentified.
Well, there's not much chance to study the evidence, old man.
Nobody's asked me.
Police don't know which way to turn.
Normally, they come to you when they're in difficulties.
Why haven't they done so in this case, yeah?
Answer that and you'll resolve the question which i must confess...
Does cause me some concern.
Yes, i'm sure it does.
[ Neighing ]
Yes, i see them, watson.
What the devil?
Whoever they may be, they have us at a grave disadvantage here in the street.
Mm.
Not yet, watson!
Hmm?
Let's just see what we can before we advertise our arrival.
Who are they?
What are they doing out there?
Is this some new case of yours you haven't told me about?
Regrettably, no. I'm singularly unemployed, as you can hardly fail to have noticed.
How many of them?
Can you see?
Five, at least.
More, perhaps.
Well, well.
We shall know soon enough.
Shall i go, or will you?
No, no, you stay here.
They can't possibly have any business with me.
Not old friends of yours, watson?
What?
No outraged husbands, i hope?
Very funny.
Well, hurry up old fellow, before they wake the house!
Yes?
Beggin' your pardon, sir.
Is it mr. Holmes?
No, it is not.
Oh. Might i have a word with mr. Holmes?
At this hour of the night?
Ridiculous.
Show them up, old fellow.
We can make an exception in an emergency.
All right, come in.
Come in.
Ah. Well, how may i help you?
We're all members of the citizen's committee, sir.
The three of us.
I'm mr. Makins, this is mr. Lanier, and mr. Cowe.
Oh. Shall the other gentlemen join us, or will they wait outside?
Yeah. You're right, sir.
There are others.
Yes, i could hardly fail to notice.
Oh, sorry, sir, if we give you a bit of a fright.
Trouble is, we didn't know how to approach you, sir.
You know, i mean, with you bein' a famous gentleman and suchlike.
I see.
I see.
What is the purpose of your citizen's committee?
Well, we want this bloke stopped with his killing.
We want him stopped and brought to justice.
If it was the west end,
The police would have him shut away by now.
If it was rich women took his fancy in their palaces,
And not poor women forced on the streets--
[ Chuckles ] look, i'll be straight with you, mr. Holmes.
We've all got shops down in whitechapel. It's all right if you're on the main road.
But if you ain't, well, no one goes off the main road.
Not day nor night, they don't.
Well, to be honest with you, trade's fallin' off something terrible.
Yes. I can well imagine that people may be a trifle discouraged.
It's bloody awful, sir.
We might as well shut up shop until this bloke's...
Caught and put away.
Which is never, if we wait for the police.
It strikes me, sir, they'd be glad of all the help you could give 'em.
- I'd have to agree with you, mr. Makins.
- Yes, well--
Um, i shall think it over.
It's like you said yourself, sir.
It is an emergency.
Watson, umm--
Would you see the gentlemen out, please?
Sir, when can we expect to hear?
U-Uh, soon. Soon.
Oh, i-In the meantime,
Would you leave an address where you can be reached with the good doctor?
You will try to persuade him, won't you, sir?
I'll do my best.
If anyone can put a stop to these atrocious crimes,
That man is sherlock holmes.
It strikes me as rather odd that these merchant chaps...
Seemed so reluctant to advertise themselves.
You seem strangely disinterested, holmes.
Almost rude, if i may say so.
Oh, not rude, surely.
Well, old chap--
What shall we do?
Shall we take up the chase?
I don't see that we have any choice. They've put their trust in you.
Good, honest fellows.
Good, honest fellows?
Hmm. That may be.
The ground will yield little tonight.
We'll make a start in the morning.
Holmes.
I wish you'd refrain from cleaning your pipe out with my hypodermic needles.
Yes, thank you, watson.
'Ello, dearie!
Hands off.
What'd you do that for?
Whore.
Girl's got to earn a living, ain't she?
What'd you do that for, then? You rotten bleeder!
I didn't do you no 'arm, did i?
Whoa, there. Whoa.
Are you alone?
Yes. Yes!
Come. It's not safe on the streets.
Oh, god bless ya!
Giddap!
Wake up, old fellow.
There's a cab waiting.
The game's afoot.
No time to lose.
What is it, holmes?
An anonymous message advising us of another murder.
Watson.
Stir yourself.
There is indeed some urgency.
Watson?
What? Okay. Oh.
Two in one night.
This is getting ridiculous.
Sherlock holmes is here.
Sherlock holmes.
What, here?
I was wondering when we'd see you on the case.
Full time.
Oh, mr. Holmes.
Inspector foxborough.
Inspector.
My associate, dr. Watson.
How do you do, sir.
Well, lestrade.
It appears you are having some difficulty with this fellow?
I might be inclined to believe some of the stories they're tellin' about this bloke.
What stories?
People says he's in league with the devil.
Appears, disappears at will.
Ah, when people are frightened, they turn to god.
When they have no help from him, they look to the devil.
Oh, nothing i believe.
You're a medical man, dr. Watson, so i don't have to warn you.
Just the same, perhaps you should prepare yourself...
For something that you may not have seen before.
When you found the body, it was in this posture, just as it is now?
Yes, sir.
And the internal organs?
For god's sake, holmes.
In just this fashion?
- Yes.
- Must you dwell on the beastly matter?
Lestrade, you saw the other body?
Yes, mr. Holmes.
Was she mutilated in the same way?
Her throat was cut.
-Is that all?
Ugh, surely--
It seems like he was disturbed, almost caught him at it.
Stand by, men. Come on, now.
Move along.
What the devil are you doing here, holmes? Who asked you to come meddling in police matters?
Who's responsible? Foxborough, did you ask this man? Lestrade?
No, sir.
No, sir.
I assumed mr. Holmes was here at your invitation.
He's not.
I've no use for his sort of bloody amateur.
"Consulting detective."
Get him out of here!
No need to disturb yourself further, sir charles. I don't wish to cause dissension.
Come along, watson.
Who is that fellow, holmes?
Sir charles warren.
New head boy, scotland yard.
Oh, yes, i remember.
Damn fool.
Last year, those riots in trafalgar square.
Exactly.
"Bloody sunday," the papers called it.
He was every bit as responsible as the radicals, in my opinion.
Why does he have to be so deliberately abusive?
At the moment, my dear fellow,
There is something more important which concerns us,
If you can restrain your indignation.
Shan't say another word.
"The juwes are not...
The men that will be... blamed for nothing."
"The juwes--"
Bloody hell.
Very well then.
Get a report out and see me back at the yard.
This is important evidence!
I'm telling you, no!
In an hour from now, there'll be a hundred people passing through here.
More. If those words are seen, i have a riot!
Any jew that the mob can get their hands on will be slaughtered in the streets.
With respect, sir charles.
Why don't we cover up the words?
No.
Just the first line--
The one word "juwes."
Isn't that enough?
I'm not standing here and arguing with you. I'll just rub this writing off!
There! Right here!
Now maybe i'm damned.
You've not left a word.
The commissioner of police rubbing out bloody words in london!
These damned newspapers.
They have the whole city in a blind state of panic.
Last night, when we were examining the body of the unfortunate catherine eddowes--
Mm. Don't remind me of that, old chap.
Did you notice a woman in the crowd?
I noticed dozens of women.
Well, yes, i would expect that of you, watson.
But one particular woman.
- Watson?
Yes.
Listen, watson, whatareyou doing?
I'm trying to corner the last pea on my plate.
- What's that object you're fooling around with?
- Oh, nothing. Yet.
- Oh.
But, uh, as i was saying--
About the woman--
I don't know how you can worry about some woman in a crowd,
When you're supposed to be conducting an investigation.
Ye-- But there was a singularly haunting quality about her.
Like some wild creature, cornered.
You squashed my pea.
Now you've got it cornered.
Yeah, but squashing your fellow's pea--
Well, just trying to help.
I didn't want it squashed.
I don't like it that way, squashed.
I like it whole.
So that you can feel it pop when you bite down on it.
Well, i'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.
I'll get the door, old fellow.
A telegram for you, mr. Holmes.
The boy didn't wait for an answer.
Ah, well, thank you, mrs. Hudson. And good night.
Good night, sir.
Ah, more from our anonymous adviser.
He invites us to meet him...
- At the elizabeth wharf.
- Oh, really?
No good.
No one here.
Hmm.
You see? Just some damn sort of hoax.
Our informant seems strangely reluctant to reveal himself.
I couldn't commit this to a telegraph, mr. Holmes.
Where are you?
It's too dangerous for the man involved.
Ah, there. In the boat, underneath us.
Dangerous for you, too, i surmise.
If you want to know more about the ripper murders, i refer you...
To robert james lees.
Where can i find this lees?
He's pulling your leg, holmes.
Robert james lees, the elms, riverside way.
There's more, mr. Holmes.
Anyone there?
Anybody there?
Watson?
Watson!
Saw him, eh?
Recognize the fellow?
-No, but the voice was familiar.
- Uh?
There's a quality in it i seem to know.
What about this fellow he mentioned, lees?
Know him?
Yes, i believe i do.
He has some reputation as a medium.
Good god!
Difficult to see how he might be involved.
And that's all he had to say.
No.
- He said something extraordinary.
-Oh?
A fascinating piece of evidence has been discovered.
We must not lose a moment, if we could take advantage of it.
'Ere, what are you doing?
Who are you?
I mean, you have no business bein' here.
Sherlock holmes, my good man.
Oh, yeah?
And my associate, dr. Watson.
I don't give a custard.
You may be on him and off him.
Is this sherlock holmes?
Just you get yourself off and out of here, mr. Sherlock holmes.
This is private property.
And you along with him, dr. Bleedin' watson!
I see you two sulkin' about!
- I think i should call the police, you know?
-Don't do that, old man.
Well, get goin' then.
Get off.
Why'd the fellow have to hide himself like that?
And why pass a message in such a ridiculous manner?
It would suggest he didn't wish to be seen talking to us.
Nobody there to see him.
Ah, but there was.
Well, it's news to me.
As a matter of fact, they've been watching us...
Ever since we took up the case.
They're watching us at this very moment.
Really?
There's nobody out there.
Oh, naturally, old man, he's not going to show himself.
But, as a precaution, we will leave through the garden.
If things are getting dangerous, i don't like you to go unarmed, holmes.
I know you don't like carrying pistols, but just for safety--
Well, i'm not entirely unarmed, old chap.
It's, um, very effective.
Ancient indian device.
Used by a cult of ferocious assassins.
Oh, the thuggee.
Yes, that is one of their tricks.
I did serve in india, you know.
Of course you did, old chum.
[ Dog barking ]
What is it you hope to find?
Or shouldn't i ask?
Give me a moment, dear fellow.
Someone has been here before us.
Someone who doesn't want anyone to see the message.
Ah yes, here, i think.
I don't see anything.
Give me--
Give me the bottle, watson.
And the brush.
Mm-Hmm.
And, uh, hold the lantern steady.
What is it that we're supposed to--
Oh!
Now, quickly, watson.
Take this down.
Before the plaster absorbs the liquid.
Uh-Huh.
"Blame for nothing."
Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh.
There.
"The... juwes?"
"Are not the men that will be blamed for nothing."
Very well.
Well, there's the words, exactly as written.
And the spelling?
Yes, it's very odd, isn't it?
What do you think it is?
Hebrew, you think?
Oh, i think not.
It means jews.
How are we to understand it, then?
"Jews are responsible for the crimes."
And?
And they're not gonna get caught.
Written by whom?
Not the murderer, surely.
Whoever wrote this message--
...may have seen the murderer.
You're invaluable to me, watson,
With your instinctive grasp for the obvious.
But why didn't he go to the police? Why did he write this ridiculous message?
Ah, because a man might use these crimes for his own purposes.
Imagine a more malign influence at work.
"For his own purposes?"
I'm not with you.
I shall smoke a pipe or two before i retire.
Very well.
I'll keep you company.
No, no.
No, old chap.
We are grappling with a dark intention,
And i have a sense of some vague outline.
No, thank you.
I would prefer my own company tonight.
Well, of course.
If you feel it's not wanted.
E-Early in the morning, old fellow,
We have a pressing need to meet with robert lees.
I understand you know something of the whitechapel murders.
I have seen the man known as jack the ripper.
Good god!
I was sitting here,
Reading, when i was overwhelmed with an intuition of a man...
And a young woman.
But did you not go to the police?
Yes.
And they treated him as a raving lunatic.
It is an experience outside their own, something they cannot allow themselves to accept.
Do you accept it?
I have been witness to much stranger events.
Well, the following evening, just such a murder took place.
- The woman's name was annie chapman.
Stuff!
I have seen him again, mr. Holmes.
Another vision?
No.
No, this time in person.
Strange story indeed.
But you've seen more of this man, have you not?
- Madam, i'm sorry.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Mr. Holmes, sir charles would like to see you.
He was most insistent.
I apologize for the interruption, ma'am.
I had no choice.
Well, thank you both for your hospitality.
I know we shall meet again.
Good lord.
It's makins!
You recognize this man, holmes?
Yes, i do.
You won't deny you were in his employ.
I'm in my own employ, sir.
This man, and others, inquired after my services.
I have given them no reply as yet.
Don't play games with me!
You're running with the foxes.
And you know their colors full well.
If i take correctly the meaning of your colorful metaphor, sir charles,
Yes, i am aware that makins was a radical, or revolutionary, to be exact.
- I say, holmes.
- So! You admit your part in their conspiracy.
Their treason!
That's damn nonsense.
What do you mean, sir?
Steady, old fellow.
I believe sir charles means to arrest me.
Arrest you?
Sherlock holmes, guilty of treason?
That's absurd!
Not treason, watson.
Murder.
Precisely.
I don't know what falling-Out you had with your slimy friends,
But i can place you at the scene of the murder.
And don't be too certain i won't discover your treasonous plotting.
Sir charles?
I'll have plenty of time while you're sitting in newgate jail.
There's that fellow from the docks.
He must have seen everything that happened.
Yes, i think rescue is at hand, and i don't believe the commissioner likes it.
Quickly, watson.
I want to examine the wound.
Holmes, why would radicals hire you to catch a madman?
Yes, why indeed?
Food for thought.
Why feed us information in such a bizarre fashion?
More important still, who killed makins, and why?
How did you know they were radicals?
Mm, sword-Stick.
Oh, no magic, watson.
I simply made inquiries at whitechapel.
That made you suspicious?
No, it was makins.
A bad actor, with his excessive civility.
And then lanier's resentment of rich ladies and their palaces.
It is fortunate for you, mr. Holmes, that the dock guard was so diligent.
Oh, i take it then, we're free.
For the moment, yes.
Sir charles would like to see you in his office immediately.
Don't provoke him.
He is determined to have you off this case.
He's a dangerous man.
He has many secret friends.
So go carefully.
"Secret friends."
[ Inhales ] curious expression.
[ Door opens ]
I warn you, holmes!
If you pursue this mat--
So--
What the--
Forgive the sleight of hand, sir charles.
In the pursuit of criminals, one learns their devices.
I say, holmes, what is this mumbo jumbo?
The handshake and the ring, watson, are archaic rituals...
Preserved by the 33rd degree members of the secret order of freemasons.
We are not a secret order.
Your existence is no secret.
You rituals and membership are secrets you guard as closely as you may.
Which is why you removed the writing from the wall.
I am responsible for the safety of the people of this city.
And their right to go safely about their business.
- Does that include the right to murder and mutilate?
- You fool!
Jews would have been slaughtered in the streets if i had not had those words removed.
Do you know the theory given greatest credence among the common people?
That this is a blood ritual.
Carried out by some jew whose religious fervor...
Sends him out in search of prostitutes...
To offer as a sacrifice to his god.
If those words had been seen, not a jew would have been safe!
Their houses and their shops would be destroyed.
Nonsense, warren.
The writing had nothing to do with the jews--
You know that.
You did not remove that writing to protect jews against anti-Semitic rage.
The jews--
Or "juwes"--
Referred to are from your own secret society...
Of the loyal order of freemasons.
We-- Well,
"benevolent society."
[ Bell pealing ] we are no danger--
This is not the kind of paltry, sordid episode...
You're accustomed to meddling in, holmes.
And you do so at great risk to yourself.
Good day.
You see.
I can't imagine what that peculiar gesture of yours was all about.
I couldn't make head nor tail over it.
It gave sir charles pause.
You shut him up!
Quite a good thing, too.
I don't know which caused him the greater anxiety:
The fact the i knew the secret signs,
- Or the possibility that i, too, might be a mason.
- Meaning what, exactly?
These are the signs which are employed by freemasons.
In their ceremonies.
To establish each other's rank.
But how are the masons involved?
Ah. Whoever wrote that message...
Is a mason--
Or a man like myself,
Who has made a study of their practices.
You mean he accuses the masons?
He wants us to believe that jack the ripper is a mason?
- Oh, come on, holmes.
- I know.
I've formed no opinion either way, watson.
But the jews-- Or "juwes"--
Against whom the accusations are being made,
Were three men who murdered the grand master,
Builder of solomon's temple.
Oh, really?
According to masonic ritual.
"And their names were jubela, jubelo...
And jubelum."
Hence, jews or juwes.
The things you know, holmes.
Oh, when they were brought before solomon,
They confessed to their guilt.
And jubela said,
"O that my throat had been cut across."
And, uh, jubelo said,
"O that my left breast had been torn open,
"My heart and vitals taken,
Thrown over my left shoulder."
And jubelum said,
"My body severed in the midst."
Good god. That poor woman's body was mutilated in just that savage way.
Now, assuming that there is, as you say, some connection between those...
Ghastly murders and the masonic ritual,
In what way were these wretched women involved?
Well, ask them. Hmm?
What?
Well, their friends.
We have to ask the living, of course. We could hardly ask the dead.
That's a relief.
I thought for a moment you were going the same way as robert lees.
Talking to the dead.
Well,
While you're making yourself familiar with the dead woman's friends,
I shall endeavor to...
Ingratiate myself with said robert lees.
Hmm, good luck, holmes.
Morning, guv.
Hello, love.
Oh. Madam didn't tell me to expect no chimney sweep.
You-- You fetch her down and she'll tell you.
I'll do no such thing.
Here i am and here i stay.
I've come to sweep the chimney.
But we're not ready for you!
You have to come back.
You fetch the missus.
What's going on down here?
Mrs. Lees, i do apologize for troubling you in this manner.
Who are you?
I-- I adopted this disguise...
To spare your husband any further inconvenience.
How dare you try and trick your way in to see my husband.
Well, i really wanted to see you, mrs. Lees,
And, if you would allow me, to speak briefly with your husband.
You see the danger you have put him in.
And he has nothing to do with this.
Yes.
And i will abide by your decision.
- But i say one thing--
- I will not be swayed, mr. Holmes.
If your husband can help me find this man...
And prevent any more of these atrocious crimes,
Do you have the right to deny me?
Hmm, we were...
Dining at home,
And suddenly...
I knew that he had killed again.
Again, you went to the police.
Yes.
They were more inclined to listen this time.
I was able to...
Give them...
Details that no one could have known.
They asked me to track him...
From the scene of the crime.
I could find no image of him there.
There, where he had committed this brutal murder.
They gave me a-A piece of the murdered girl's dress.
And i-I could find no sense of him.
And then the inspector gave me something quite trivial,
Unconnected perhaps.
The stem from a bunch of grapes.
How do you know that?
But you were then able to sense the man.
Yes. He-- He was there.
I mean, it was as if he was there.
I had merely to follow him.
There.
Impossible.
[ Holmes ] did you go into the house?
We did.
You confronted the man.
How did he receive you?
The inspector spoke with him.
He was not impressed by my intuition.
He heard us out politely,
Reminded us how late it was,
And then he suggested that it would be better if we left.
You've been most careful not to mention the man's name, haven't you?
I realize how persuasive sir charles can be.
He came here.
He threatened my husband in his own home.
No. I can't expect you to break your word.
Mr. Holmes,
I have the strongest intuition concerning you.
I sense some danger,
Close and threatening.
I have a sense of it myself.
It ain't fair. Everybody's going on like it's our fault--
Like we're to blame.
Like as if we'd go out and look for him, egg the bleeder on to cut her bloody throat.
What do you want to go asking about polly for?
What's she got to do with you?
Writing about her, don't you know?
Writing for the newspapers.
You don't want to write nothing bad about polly.
Don't intend to, no, but it seems to me that a deal more...
Is written about the murderer than about his victims.
That's true.
It's true, isn't it?
Like he's important and they ain't.
Precisely.
If anybody thought about the likes of us,
We wouldn't have come to this.
Uh, one thing, uh, polly nichols,
Was she friends with any of the other women?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Oh!
Talk to mary if you want to know anything about old polly.
Mary. Uh, what's her other name?
Mary kelly.
Mary kelly.
Where could i find her?
You won't find her round here no more.
She thinks herself a cut above us.
Toffee-Nosed slut.
Uh, you know where i could find mary kelly?
Come over 'ere.
I'll tell you all about her.
Excuse me, ladies.
Better keep your mouth closed, you little slut.
Don't bother with her.
She doesn't know mary.
Come on.
Sit down.
Cheap tarts.
They're jealous
'cause i'm young,
And i get all the blokes.
Got all me own teeth.
That's why.
What do you want with mary kelly anyway?
Her teeth's fallen out too.
Not like mine.
Have a feel.
Oh, no.
Thank you very much, but--
Oh, come on, love.
I won't bite you.
See? Firm as a rock.
Yes, remarkable.
Oh, god.
Oh, bloody hell.
Oh. Just one loose.
Oh, bloody hell.
- What are you staring at?
- Oh, i-- Nothing.
Are we gonna sit here all day?
Well, there's no hurry actually.
Not for me either.
I just thought maybe, uh--
Yes, well, um--
Now, suppose i'm looking for this young woman,
This particular young woman.
There's plenty of others.
Yes. And suppose i say...
I'm looking for this particular young woman.
Um, uh--
Come with me.
We can't talk here,
If you take my meaning.
Oh, yes, yes.
I see what you mean.
Near here the ripper committed his first murder.
You've got him on the brain.
Can't talk of nothing else.
I'm bound to talk about him.
In there?
Want mary kelly?
I'm taking you to her.
Yes, but, um--
Hmm.
Come on.
I reckon that's why you come down here, all you toffs.
You want to talk about him--
What he done.
Get a lot of toffs coming down here, do you?
All kinds.
Of course, talk's all them blokes is good for.
Not like you.
Come on. This way.
Uh, she lives around here, does she, mary kelly?
Look. I'll tell you straight.
I don't know this mary kelly.
You-- But you promised.
You said--
What's that for?
Aha.
And what are you doing?
That's my woman you got there.
What are you doing with her?
An old geezer like you,
With a fine lady of your own at home...
Waiting for ya, worrying about ya,
And you down here, messing about with my woman.
Now, you wouldn't like me to go and visit your wife, now, would you?
I see. So it's that old game, is it?
Well, you've chosen the wrong victim, my good man.
We'll see what the police have to say about this.
Good old danny.
Stay there, you pimp.
What's the trouble here?
Thank goodness. Just in time.
He's jack the ripper.
Who, him?
He grabbed me, and he was gonna slit my bloody throat...
When my mate pulled him off and then he attacked him.
Just a minute.
That old fellow? He couldn't rip my old grandmother.
I resent that.
He's the ripper.
You better arrest him,
Or i'll scream and bring our mob.
You'll do nothing of the sort.
You trying to get him killed?
Come along. We'll sort this out down the station.
You're making a grave error.
Serves you right, you old fart.
Thank you.
Hey. Get off!
I haven't done anything!
Leave me alone!
Well, well.
Here's a pretty mess you've gotten yourself into, old chap.
For god's sake, holmes.
What's taken you so long?
Well, i came with all speed as soon as i heard.
Now, he'll be released into your custody, mr. Holmes.
You'll be responsible for his future good behavior.
You understand now?
"Good behavior."
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Learned your lesson, doctor?
Don't play the silly with us, lestrade.
My blokes tell me you put up quite a struggle.
I gave a good account of myself.
I'm certain he did.
Mr. Holmes, my advice to you is that you take him home...
And you see that he's not let get into any more mischief.
Eh?
Oh, come along, watson.
For god's sake.
Damn the fellow.
Didn't it occur to you that something was amiss when i didn't come home last night?
Calm yourself, old man.
I wasn't home myself.
I had some business to--
They were ready to tear me to pieces.
Yes. All right.
Come, watson. All we need is to take you home and get you a good meal and rest.
I'm perfectly fit.
Ready for anything.
Now, i don't believe the woman who gave me all this trouble even knew mary kelly.
Kelly.
Yes. Mary kelly.
Friend of polly nichols.
The people who lived in the district didn't seem to want to talk about her.
That's good, watson.
That's very good.
Now, polly nichols.
Victim number one.
She was murdered here.
Victim number two, annie chapman, was murdered here.
A considerable distance apart.
Those two and mary kelly--
Heaven knows where she lives--
They knew each other.
The three of them were very often seen in a tavern in dorset street.
That's annie chapman, mary kelly and polly nichols.
That's right.
Now we come to, uh, elizabeth stride.
That's victim number three.
Liz stride.
Murdered there.
She was, uh, called liz, "long liz."
A tall girl.
Foreign. She was married to-- Or rather, she lived with a man...
Whose name i don't know, but their address was dorset street.
You surpassed yourself, watson.
Now, these few women, living within a few streets,
All knowing each other, that's more than coincidence, surely.
Excellent, watson.
You're an inspiration.
But i have more work for you.
Yeah?
I need your help to find the man lees sought out.
Didn't lees tell you?
No. He wouldn't tell me his name.
Sir charles warren has put him in fear for his life,
But i have a notion of his address.
Study the medical directory.
We're looking for a doctor.
More precisely, a physician.
There's a list of streets which you must pay careful attention to on my table.
- Don't dash off. Wait for me.
- We're too conspicuous.
We must take separate paths.
At least tell me where you're going.
I'm going to pay my last respects to catherine eddowes.
I feel she will be more help to us now than when she was alive.
All right.
Mary kelly?
Stay away.
I got a knife.
I'll stick ya.
I want to help you.
My name is sherlock holmes.
Why, what do you want with me?
I must talk to you.
Where can we go?
The streets are safe as anywhere else.
Other people come looking for me.
Yesterday there was this old bloke askin' after me.
You can trust me.
I can't trust no one!
Oh. Ow.
What have i done for this?
I know that something's frightening you.
What is it? Tell me.
I want to tell someone.
As long-- As long as someone knows--
Someone else.
Tellme.
No.
I told--
I told annie chapman and they done for her.
Did you tell polly nichols?
Did you know poll?
You told her, didn't you?
No.
Jesus. I--
She-- She was with me often.
They must have seen us.
They? Who are they?
Why are they looking for you?
Whatever you've done, whatever you know, there's no reason to fear me.
Aye, no. The baby.
Baby?
She gave her to me.
She said,
"look after her."
She? Who?
Annie.
Annie chapman.
Annie crook.
Well, they took her...
And shut her away.
Uh--
But they don't dare to kill her. They have to keep her shut away.
Where have they taken her?
For all that, eddy still loves her.
Eddy?
He wouldn't let them kill her.
Oh, sweet jesus.
I'm so frightened.
Where can i find this annie crook?
I don't know.
She was at st. Christopher's,
But she's out of there now.
They took her.
Help me.
Won't you please help me?
Come, mary. I'll take you somewhere where it's safe.
I can't sleep no more,
For fear they'll find me when i'm not watching.
Well, well.
Thank god you're all right.
I don't seem to be able to recall anything.
I'm not surprised.
You may have sustained a slight concussion.
What the devil were you up to?
Well,
There was a woman.
Mm-Hmm.
What happened to her?
Well, lestrade told me to expect something dramatic,
But he didn't prepare me for something quite so downright stupid.
Foxborough.
Whoever it was was trying to murder you.
It was no accident.
Yeah. But there was a young woman. I remember.
I want you to rest for a while, holmes.
I saw the cab, and i saw you,
But i--
I didn't see any woman.
I'm sure there w--
Watson discovered something, remember,
That you might find useful.
It's good of you to say so, holmes.
It was that three of the murdered women...
Holmes, please.
Had, uh, a common link.
They all frequented a tavern in dorset street.
Dorset street.
The black horse?
Yes, that's the one.
Should you require further information about polly nichols,
I was told one should speak to a mary kelly.
- And that was the woman.
- Yes?
I was talking to her when the hansom ran me down.
Yes. I had an intuition that...
She might be at the center of this pattern of events.
I'll set my men to look for her at once.
Mary kelly, you say?
Yes.
Oh, foxborough.
Oh, i'm sorry.
Would you care for me to wait?
Uh, no. On the contrary.
With the assistance of the good doctor,
I shall pursue my own line of inquiry.
Holmes!
Yes?
You're always dashing off without telling me where you're going or what our objective is.
St. Christopher's hospital, old fellow, looking for a woman named annie crook.
Oh. Now we know.
Did you have much luck with the medical directory?
Oh, yes.
Uh, too much, i'm afraid.
I found the names of no less than a dozen physicians in the general area.
A mere dozen? I thought there would have been at least a hundred.
Holmes, to me, it's inconceivable that any physician could be remotely connected...
With these atrocious crimes.
You must not allow loyalty to your profession...
To prevent you discovering the truth, my dear fellow,
No matter how unpalatable.
Well.
Illustrious names indeed.
Thank you.
I'm only too sorry, dr. Watson,
That i haven't been able to give you any more positive information.
On the contrary, you've been most cooperative.
Thank you very much, doctor.
Doctor, mr. Gregory.
Annie crook isn't here.
Oh, come, come, watson.
I told you that.
But where is she?
It's no easy matter persuading these johnnies to talk about their patients.
I'm sure you did an excellent job.
Told them she was a servant of the family who'd come to london.
Promised my mother i'd look her up.
Yes. Yes.
Well, i trust you weren't too inventive in your mendacity.
But, come, watson, a simple story, please.
I'm doing my best.
Where is annie crook?
A broken neck and scapula.
Yes, yes, watson.
Oh, yes. Annie crook.
Uh, they took her to a hospital near reading.
According to what the doctor says, it's more like an asylum.
She's still there?
In her physician's opinion, she'll be there for the rest of her life.
It seems that the poor woman is, um, insane.
Her physician is, by the way--
Yes. Sir thomas spivey.
Good god.
One of the court physicians.
You knew already.
Well, the name is on your list, watson.
And i have been compiling another list of my own.
I can't keep pace.
There is a particular variety of grape, watson.
Grape.
Specially imported for those with the most discriminating of tastes.
And among the people who place an order for them--
Sir thomas spivey.
The only name we find on both our lists.
Are you suggesting it's a court physician?
To be sure, watson.
To be sure.
I've been exploited, old fellow, by the very people for whom we are searching.
It's time we turned the tables.
This woman we're about to visit, this annie crook,
She had a dreadful accident, not unlike yours.
It seemed like superficial injuries at first,
And then things took a turn for the worse,
And sir thomas decided to have her committed.
Yes. Odd.
Very odd.
Why is this woman so damned important to you, holmes?
At the moment, i'm as much in the dark as you,
But i draw your attention to the peculiar circumstances of the man who is following us.
There's nobody following us.
It is to that peculiar circumstance that i draw your attention.
You mean, why not?
Exactly.
Ah. Ah, yes.
Whoa there.
Whoa there.
Drive on.
Come on. Giddap.
Giddap. Giddap.
Leave me alone to talk with the girl as long as you can.
Uh-Huh.
Please try not to disturb the others.
She hardly seems to know that we're here.
Well, i'm quite sure that she doesn't, dr. Watson.
It's a strange phenomenon.
She hasn't spoken a word in six months.
Has her condition deteriorated, would you say?
Since she first came here?
Oh, yes. Yes. Markedly.
[ Watson ] i'd very much appreciate a glance at her records.
-Is that possible?
- Yes. You'll find them interesting, i think.
Yes. I'm sure i would.
You'll excuse us.
Annie.
I'm a friend.
Mary sent me.
Mary kelly.
Do you remember her?
Mary's frightened, annie.
She's frightened for her life.
I'd like to help her, but i can't...
Till i know why she's frightened.
Eddy.
Where?
[ Laughs ]
He sent you?
Eddy sent you.
You.
I knew.
I knew...
He would send--
He would come for me.
Hmm.
[ Chuckles ] no. Mary sent me.
Mary.
Mary.
Mary... yes.
Sent you?
How?
They won't let me see.
They?
Mary doesn't know.
Well.
Nobody knows.
Why? Why won't they let you see mary?
My baby.
Is my baby safe?
Mary, keep my baby safe.
Don't-- Don't...
Let... them hurt--
Now, why would they want to hurt your baby?
Ah.
Why do they keep you here?
Danger. For them.
Eddy said--
Hate me.
Angry with him.
And the baby--
He said,
"When they know--
Kill."
They?
He... who arethey?
Brought me here.
I don't belong here.
You can see.
Can't you see?
I'm not crazy.
They are all crazy here.
I won't stay here.
I won't let them keep me.
I will fight them,
And i'll make them--
Help me.
Why do they keep you here?
Why does eddy let them keep you here,
If he loves you?
He loves me!
He loves me.
Didn't he marry me?
Didn't we have a baby?
- He loves me!
- Why does he let them keep you here?
I don't know!
Oh!
But i haven't seen him.
They won't let me see him.
They-- He doesn't know where i am.
Uh, they tell him i ran off, i took the baby, i don't love him.
I'm going to make trouble for him.
I love him.
Then he must be told where you are.
Don't let them hurt me anymore.
I won't tell, and they hurt me.
Yeah. They hurt me.
Why do they want to hurt you?
What do they want to know?
They want my baby.
And i know they'll hurt my baby if i tell.
Oh, god in heaven.
But i can't tell.
I don't know.
I say that, and they hurt me.
Please, don't let them hurt me.
Annie.They.
Who arethey?
Tell me, please.
I ca--
I told them.
I told them.
Mary.
I... gave my baby...
To mary for safekeeping.
I told mary to keep my baby safe.
I told them.
Told them.
What the devil are you doing?
Told them.
There--
You have no business keeping this woman in restraint.
Holmes.
Who are you?
She needs care--
Desperately needs care.
She has every care.
Watson, we must take this woman from this hellish place.
Holmes, you can't do that.
Sherlock holmes.
Th-This woman came here of her own free will.
She has no family to claim her.
It is the opinion of her physician...
And the board that she should stay here until such time--
Holmes, for god's sake.
Holmes.
Are you all right?
I know you don't want to talk, but it does help sometimes, you know.
I hate to see you upset like this.
The heir presumptive.
I beg your pardon?
The duke of clarence.
"Eddy," she said.
Oh, god.
I can't believe it.
I now know why we were not followed.
They thought annie crook was hopelessly insane.
They never counted on her courage...
And her extraordinary will to protect her child.
It's too late for annie now.
And i fear it will be too late for mary kelly...
If we don't find her this very night.
We must save her.
Forgive me, watson.
I can spare no thought for any other matter.
Any news of the kelly woman?
Not a word, sir.
We've got every man we can walking the streets.
If another woman's murdered tonight, i swear--
Where's foxborough?
I don't know, sir.
He's gone off on his own somewhere.
He's a funny bloke. Can't get him to stay in one place.
Come along, watson.
Oh, sir. Did you hear about sir charles?
He chucked in the sponge.
Given up.
Gone home.
Would you believe it?
Yes, i believe it.
His failure reflects as much on you as on him.
Warren would never have been able to pervert justice...
Had any one of you stood up against him.
Absolutely.
Sir charles resigns?
I find that baffling.
Now mary kelly.
They should know something at the black horse tavern.
That's precisely where we're going, watson.
Oh.
No!
No!
You're aware that we're being followed.
Yes.
For some time now, i think.
Yes. Of course.
I suppose it would be foolish to offer you--
Come.
Ah.
Walk ahead of me.
Mr. Holmes. Good.
Where is mary kelly?
We're all searching for her.
I've got men in every house.
You had her, foxborough,
And you lost her intentionally.
What on earth are you talking about?
Why hashe been following us? Huh?
It may surprise you to learn, watson,
That this is our mysterious informant.
Uh-Huh?
Using his agents makins and lanier...
To deliver messages to steer us into whichever direction he chose.
- You're insane.
- No, inspector.
You are the head of a radical movement.
I have proof.
Rest assured.
Your career at scotland yard is finished.
Do you want him to get away with it?
Do you want mary kelly butchered like all the others?
You don't care a damn about what happens to mary kelly,
Or any of the other pathetic women.
Well, perhaps that's true.
Perhaps they're not important.
Except insofar as they show...
This government's aristocratic contempt for the people and how they suffer.
If you, sherlock holmes, can't see the corruption around you,
Then perhaps some people do have to die in order to expose it.
Oh, you'd let them all die.
You'd let mary kelly die.
Yes, by god, i'll let her die.
But if you find the killers, and it can be shown...
That my superiors in the government have concealed evidence,
If you can expose their lies, their abuse of power,
Then perhaps we can--
We can bring this decadent monarchy to its knees.
He's out of his senses.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
Yes, he does, watson.
He knows full well.
He knows exactly what he's doing.
A man devoid of conscience, as guilty as the murderer himself.
She trustedyou, mr. Holmes.
She came out of hiding because she trustedyou.
So, if they got her, it's because she trusted god-Almighty sherlock holmes.
- Foxborough, stay away from me.
-They used you.
We used you.
You did exactly what we wanted you to do.
If she dies, and you come under my hand, expect no mercy.
You have my word on it.
A radical in scotland yard?
Terrifying.
Holmes, what did you mean when you said-- Oh.
Holmes, what he said about the government being involved, that can't be.
I'm afraid it is.
How high up?
Perhaps to the throne.
What?
- Aah!
I'm so sorry, old man.
After them. Go on.
I'm all right.
May i suggest you take this?
[ Chuckles ]
Aah!
Hey! Hey!
Watson.
Help watson.
- Gentlemen. Mr. Holmes.
- Prime minister.
I thought it would be better we should meet here.
We can be sure of privacy.
"Secrecy" would perhaps be the more appropriate word.
Shall we agree upon "discretion"?
You have already spoken to the home secretary.
I have indicated something of the matter to him, yes.
I have summoned you here because you have made statements...
Which affect the very existence of the social order of this country.
Let me make it plain.
What is at stake will not permit unconsidered actions,
Nor injudicious statements.
We shall take action if we must.
And i can assure you that action will be effective.
The sequence of events, prime minister,
Convince me of your ability to take effective action.
You have me at a disadvantage, mr. Holmes.
I think it might be better if you tell us your story in your own way...
And permit me to be the judge of whether it is true or not.
You may take it to be true, sir.
The first link in my chain of circumstances...
Is a woman by the name of annie crook.
I see you recognize that name, home secretary.
In other circumstances that would surprise me, since she is a woman of the lower classes,
Hardly likely to affect the life of anyone so powerful.
Your irony is out of place.
You would be wise, mr. Holmes,
To resist the temptation to condescend.
Prime minister.
How does annie crook concern anyone here?
I found her.
She told me some fragments of her pathetic story.
She met her lover...
First at the household where she was employed.
She fell in love with him.
He was infatuated briefly with her.
With her gentleness, her beauty and her innocence.
And in the face of this congregation--
He went through a form of marriage,
And soon after, tired of her, he left.
She bore him a child.
This much was done without attracting notice.
And then, when the existence of the child was discovered,
And its religion--
Catholic--
The government suddenly became concerned.
You must forgive me, mr. Holmes.
I had expected an account of more significance.
How can all this affect the government of england?
You exaggerate, surely.
Her lover, her husband, however you may call him--
Her seducer--
Was his grace, the duke of clarence and avondale,
Albert victor christian edward, earl of athlone,
The heir presumptive to the throne of england.
Known as eddy to his more intimate acquaintances.
An indiscretion, mr. Holmes.
Hardly a crime.
Certainly nothing so serious...
As to warrant all this passion.
Well, not a crime.
Not yet, prime minister.
An inconvenience.
Yet you yourself made it known it would be preferable if the woman--
Indeed, the problem itself--
Did not exist.
[ Holmes narrating ] and one man among the many...
Who was privy to the prince's indiscretion...
Took on the filthy work.
And that same man drew another into his hideous conspiracy,
By persuading him they had the official sanction of the highest in the land.
They sought out annie, and they deceived her...
By promising to take her to her beloved eddy.
It was a simple matter to arrange.
She was taken to hospital.
From that hospital she was removed to another place,
More distant, more secure.
Alone.
Abandoned by her lover.
Tormented and confused,
They forced her to tell them that she had given her child to a friend for safekeeping.
And the search for mary kelly and the plot for her disposal had begun.
Ohh.
They searched.
Nothing would stop them.
They searched for mary.
They searched for the child.
In terror for her own life,
Mary shared the secret of the royal indiscretion.
And, in doing so, sealed the fate of her friends.
They murdered anyone who might have known of the child.
Thus was born the myth of jack the ripper.
Polly nichols,
Annie chapman,
Liz stride...
And catherine eddowes...
Were slaughtered and their deaths disguised as the work of a madman.
And to my everlasting regret,
I led the murderers...
Straight to mary,
The one woman they had searched for so long and in vain.
First, she escaped.
Then...
No!
She died.
But she died without revealing...
The very thing they needed to discover.
No!
Where to find the child.
And so the victims and the crimes.
What of the criminals?
It remains for you to prove these allegations, mr. Holmes.
And i'm curious to know how far you will press your accusations.
I don't begin with you.
I begin with a man who is already dead.
William slade,
Prime mover in these atrocious crimes,
Who set them on from some misguided loyalty to the royal family he served,
Or as a hidden agent in their cause.
I accuse sir thomas spivey, the celebrated physician,
Whose hospital took annie crook and drove her into madness.
A man who prescribes eternal incarceration for a woman...
Simply because she was seduced,
Made pregnant and delivered of a child;
Who, according to archaic ritual, butchered his victims.
I accuse a man who has no place in this world or the next.
You accuse,
But it is proof we need, mr. Holmes.
We've heard this tragic story now,
But what is your link with annie crook?
Where is your proof?
You have no proof.
Only surmise and wild conjecture.
I have proof.
I have proof that a woman was cynically taken in marriage.
I have proof of the husband's name; that a child was born.
I have proof that the woman was committed to an asylum by order of spivey.
I have proof of evidence suppressed by you, sir charles.
Evidence which seemed to accuse...
A member of the sacred order to which you all belong.
You are all freemasons.
You, prime minister.
Home secretary.
Sir charles, you.
And spivey-- All masons.
And in discovering the involvement of a fellow mason,
You were sworn to protect him in his criminal intent.
Then you accuse us!
Of complicity in murder?
No, prime minister.
Your suggestion was enough to prompt these men to action.
What was done was all done in your name.
I shall not debate that with you.
There are larger issues here than you can understand.
Don't presume to judge us, holmes.
I know where my duty lies:
In the protection of the monarchy.
There is not now, nor has there ever been, a danger to the monarchy.
That thought existed only in the minds of the three men in this room!
Your intrigue simply served the disaffected radicals,
Whom you fear.
Very well, mr. Holmes.
Slade's dead. Spivey is insane.
Sir charles--
His career is ruined.
What sort of ruin does he face?
Will the masons punish or reward him?
He kept faith withyou.
Your oath of fellowship binds you to supporthim.
What shall i tell the queen?
You surely don't suggest that her majesty is in any way involved.
I cannot easily believe that.
- You have my word!
- I would prefer some more reliable authority.
In the circumstances, i shall ignore your offensive attitude.
If i seem to be offensive, prime minister, you may take it i am offended!
Youoffend me.
Shall i resign?
Would that satisfy you?
Yes,resign.
And if i had the means, i would compel you.
You know what you risk, mr. Holmes.
The ruin of your own society...
And the substitution of a radical, anarchist ideology.
I care nothing about that.
You're all the same to me.
You, prime minister, foxborough and the radicals--
All of you equally to blame.
God knows, if i could prove your complicity, i would not hesitate,
But i was not a party to your secret councils.
Only you know to what extent you are responsible.
For the moment, however,
As long as the child is safe,
You have my word i shall keep silent.
But in the event she is harmed in any way,
I will make public everything i know.
The whereabouts of this child are unknown to us.
We are satisfied they should remain so.
And annie crook... must be set free.
Unhappily, she is already free.
The night after her meeting with you, mr. Holmes, she died.
How? Died.
[ Prime minister ] she took her own life.
Free?
I wish i had some reason to believe you.
How may i convince you?
Even if you could convince me,
It's too late.
It's too late for annie crook.
Separated from her child, driven to despair...
And death.
You create allegiance...
Above your sworn allegiance to humanity.
You will not feel for them...
Or acknowledge their pain.
There lies the madness.
Well. Well, mr. Holmes.
Remember you have promised to keep your silence.
Our business is finished.
Finished.
Perhaps for you, but not for me.
I will always have the death of mary kelly on my conscience.
And you, prime minister, will have the deaths of annie...
And all those tragic women...
And their agony...
On yours.
[ Paper rustling ]
Come away, holmes.
Come and sit down.
We've unmasked... madmen, watson.
Wielding scepters.
Reason run riot.
Justice howling at the moon.
But, holmes, you did much more than any other man could have attempted.
And there's... still decency.
Annie crook and mary kelly...
Dying to protect a child.
You're right.
There is decency.
And if nowhere else,
In that battered breast of yours.
Hmm.
I think,
If you will allow me,
I will play now for a while.
"If you will allow me."
Thanks for that.
Yes, holmes, play.
And now, for all of you fans
of the Philadelphia rock....
-Settle down, David! Brad!
-Oh, come on!
No hot dogs at the beach unless everybody's in their seats.
Is everybody in their seat?
Is everybody buckled up?
-Yeah!
-Who are we?
Franklin Weekend Day Camp!
Sound like a bunch a girls. Who are we?
Franklin Weekend Day Camp!
-That's better. Give me an ''F.''
-''F''!
-Give me an R-A-N.
-R-A-N!
-Give me a ''K.''
-''K''!
-Give me a L-I-N.
-L-I-N!
That's the way we spell it, here's the way we yell it.
-Franklin!
-Yeah!
All right. Now let's be quiet till we get down to the beach, okay... so I can listen to my music.
Simon says peel them off!
Okay, last one that doesn't have them off doesn't get the cold drinks.
I want you all back here in one hour for lunch. Don't go too far.
Come on!
Who's last? You're gonna be last.
Let's go!
Come here, there's somebody in the water!
Could I have a glass of milk?
Why does it always make you thirsty?
I don't know. It always does.
-You're not so thirsty.
-You're right. I'm not so thirsty.
It was outstanding.
Very professional, but outstanding.
It's a time-honored profession.
An older one than yours.
And besides, you've had thousands of dollars' worth on the house, as they say.
Bingo.
Now, you see? You lose seven minutes off your life for each puff.
I'll go and get us some coffee.
Come on, will you?
Come on, man, it's Sunday. What?
All right, I'll see you later.
Yeah, all right, okay.
Nice day.
Thank you.
After coffee, I'll fix us some breakfast.
-I gotta pass. That call was from downtown.
-On a Sunday?
Yeah.
-This Sunday was my Sunday.
-It was our Sunday.
They found a dead girl on the beach.
It's a rezoned district.
They don't want any heat.
What heat?
A dead girl on the beach, that creates heat.
Where were you going to take me today?
-What difference does that make?
-I canceled all my appointments.
They'll have to get along with their girlie magazines.
I'd just like to know what you had planned.
I was gonna take you to the Ram-Viking game.
Have you wear those tight white pants and that sexy blouse.
Parade you up and down the aisle a couple times.
Watch all those guys looking at you, say to myself:
''Schmucks, she's for sale.''
And so is everybody else in the Coliseum.
Bingo.
Take me to Cannes, Phil.
We'll sit on the terrace at the Majestic, and have Campari.
Be nice to fly away.
Yeah.
Then we'll go to Rome.
Stand at the top of the Spanish Steps.
And at night, you can smell--
You can smell Africa.
Yes. You can smell Africa.
And the red walls.
Goddamn red walls.
Okay, we'll go to Rome.
Yeah, we go to Rome.
We will?
We will.
Soon.
I'll call you later.
Your attention, please.
Will Mr. Martin Hollinger...
please report to the Coliseum office.
Mr. Martin Hollinger
to the Coliseum office, please.
Will Mr. Martin Hollinger
please report to the Coliseum office...
below the peristyle
at the east end of the Coliseum.
...along the near sidelines,
but couldn't hit him.
Final score.; San Francisco 2 7,
Atlanta nothing.
Final score.; Denver 20, Oakland 1 7.
So the Raiders' nine-game winning streak....
Sgt. Mendez, contact
the Watch Commander, please.
Officer Hallman, there's a Mrs. Walinsky
in the waiting room to see you.
I came home from church.
A police car was waiting.
They asked for you.
I told them that you were at the game.
Maybe it's a mistake. I mean, they do make mistakes, it happens all the time.
A teenage girl was found on the beach.
Dead.
They have reason to believe that she was Gloria.
-What reason?
-They didn't say.
But he didn't say why he thought it was Gloria?
No.
Mr. Hollinger?
...the only touchdown
in the second half scored by the Rams...
with Garrett....
-Mr. Hollinger?
-Yeah.
I'm Lt. Gaines. We're ready for identification.
How do you know it's my daughter?
We don't know for sure, that's why you're here.
There's no reason for both of you to go.
There's no smoking down there.
-Now that's bullshit.
-Please, Marty.
If you want to smoke, smoke. This way.
...Harold Jackson to the left,
Snow to the right. Back this way...
Cappelletti and McCutcheon still in motion,
to this side, that makes it a double left.
Back goes Harris to throw
with all the time in the world....
Mr. Hollinger...
-this is my partner, Sgt. Belgrave.
-This way, sir.
Lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
How's your man Harris doing?
He kept dropping three or four balls on them in the first half.
But the calls they were sending in were terrible.
-It's like Allen and Gabriel all over again.
-How'd they do in the second half?
If they don't run out of time, they got a chance.
Harris ain't bad for a black quarterback.
...on the 46-yard line of Minnesota,
short of a first down but....
Crap!
...playing with a rib fracture....
-What's the score, Chuck?
-Still 1 7-13, but they're really moving.
...to his replacement, Amos Martin.
One-eighty-three.
-One, eight, three.
-Right, 1 83.
Mr. Hollinger, is that your daughter?
The Lieutenant asked if that's your daughter, sir.
You miserable son of a bitch.
You rotten bastard!
Hold him, grab him!
Son of a gun! Lock his goddamn arm.
-Should I cuff him?
-No, let him go.
-What?
-Let him go.
You could've covered her up.
You bastards could've covered her up.
Shut it up, Chuck.
Come on, get a move on!
We ought to book his ass.
-For what?
-Assault.
-You still should've covered her up.
-And I say we ought to book him.
Louis, you want to go upstairs and get Mrs. Hollinger... and bring her down here for me, please?
Crazy motherfucker.
Go on, take it. Take it.
Mr. Hollinger, I have nothing to do with procedure down here. Nothing.
You're right. We should've covered her.
-Why'd you kill those kids?
-I didn't do anything.
You funny-looking bunny rabbit, why'd you kill that old couple?
We haven't had our last dance yet, Freddy.
-You just remember that.
-I didn't do it.
We're gonna cut you up in little pieces and leave you all over this fucking town!
They were just babies, you chalky motherfucker!
We're gonna make dog food out of you, whitey.
You dig, Freddy?
Finger by finger, arm by arm, just like--
That's it! Game's over.
Stay out of this, Phil.
Charley, take him downstairs and give him something to eat... and give him a shower, and either let him go or book him.
You motherfucker!
Get him out of here, Charley!
Come on, move it!
Let's you and I go in my office and have a talk.
-Bullshit. Let's talk about it right here!
-Let's talk about it in my office, now!
You've been shucking that poor son of a bitch around now for two weeks... with nothing but a junkie's squeal.
Now lay off him. It's over. It's finished.
Be straight with me, Lieutenant.
There's something about that albino, something personal, right?
Wrong.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
All right. What time tomorrow?
8:30 at the butcher shop.
-Anything else?
-Yeah.
Don't you think we ought to show a little compassion... for a man that goes through life looking at the world... through red Easter-Bunny eyes?
I'll work on it tonight.
I hate having breakfast with a grouch.
Well, after all, how many albinos are there?
-Are you checking out?
-Yeah.
-How come you're not out humping, Nick?
-Wore them out.
-Boys or girls?
-Whatever I get lucky with.
I think I got something here you'd be interested in.
Yeah?
Jerry Bellamy.
-Jesus Christ.
-Yeah.
I got him two consecutive life sentences five years ago.
Yeah, well, he was released.
''Completely rehabilitated.''
Sliced up a 40-year-old woman, mid-afternoon in her home... up on Mulholland.
-Did you get a line on him?
-Only that he's out there somewhere.
Terrific.
Officer Ingersol,
the Watch Commander wants to see you.
-Hello.
-Hello, lady.
Hi. I'm hungry. Where are you?
I'm at the Golden Palm Massage Parlor.
I got a lady right here with no hands massaging the hell out of me.
What is she using?
Her imagination.
Listen, why don't you pick up some
Chinese food, a bottle of champagne... and some dirty pictures.
How about an 8-by-1 0 glossy of Sammy Davis Jr. hugging Nixon?
Don't forget I'm hungry.
When are you coming home?
I'll see you in about an hour.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy....
I'm waiting, Daddy.
It's my birthday.
Daddy....
See me spin, Daddy.
I love you, Daddy.
Marty.
We lost her a long time ago.
We just don't count.
You do understand what I'm saying, don't you, Paula?
Yeah, I understand.
Hi. Is that you, Victor?
Is that my Victor? Yeah. You guessed it.
Well, this is Mother with a bedtime story.
Yeah. Yes, I know.
Are you all stretched out in your beddy-bye?
Yes, I know. I can see that.
Well, high up on the wall... and she's going to tell you what to do. Yes?
Just take your time.
Yes. I can see you doing it.
Yes. I will be so close to you.
Are you in it with me?
Tell me, I'd like to hear that again.
Just take your time.
I'd love that. I'd love to be there.
I could watch.
I almost can't stand that. Yeah.
And there it is.
Yes, me, too.
What's the matter?
It's getting tougher all the time.
So quit.
Will you take care of me?
Till death do us part.
That's what you promised your wife.
Yeah.
How's Timmy?
I don't know.
He was asleep when I got there.
Nancy has a wonderful way of making me feel like I deserted her.
But you did.
There's nothing like finding your wife with her legs wrapped around some guy's back.
I'm a whore, so it's all right.
But she's your wife, and then it's not all right.
Why don't you play that record
I brought back from Italy.
Please?
Tell me about Rome.
I told you about Rome. A million times.
Tell me again.
-You promise not to laugh at my Italian?
-I promise.
Well, the LA narcs wanted some help. So...
-I went to Rome.
-Well--
Yes.
I met this nice old Italian man.
And we went to a little town outside of Rome for lunch.
He had a black shiny suit on, with pigeon shit all over it.
Charming.
And then later that night we went to dinner... with some movie people.
And we went to a place called Rosati's... in the Piazza del Popolo.
-I didn't laugh.
-Incredible, the way I said that.
Piazza del Popolo. Perfect?
-Perfect.
-Thank you.
Had a wonderful dinner.
Can you imagine... a nice Irish kid like me in an ancient piazza... with all those classy Romans swallowing fried octopus... and getting pissed on Valpolicello.
Valpolicella.
Valpolicella.
-Yes.
-Thank you.
And then? You went straight home to bed.
-No.
-What do you mean, ''no''?
That's a new story.
No, that's a new ending.
Come here. Come and tell me about that new ending.
Come here.
-So?
-So?
Okay.
I ended up with this Yugoslavian actress... from Trastevere.
-Trastevere.
-Okay.
-And then?
-And she got very stoned. Very stoned.
And we ended up in the sack.
How was she?
Not bad.
She kept moaning though.
''Vito, Vito.''
Vito? Are you sure it was not ''Tito, Tito''?
Not ''Tito, Tito,'' that would've turned me off.
-Yeah?
-Yes.
And then I came home first-class. First-class.
And the narcs got their headlines and a bust.
Everybody was happy.
All in all, it was a very fine trip.
Let's wake up somewhere else.
We will.
We really will.
You feel sexy?
That sounds like a song cue.
If we're gonna do it, what're we gonna do with all these pillows?
I don't know.
For those of us who were alive in 1 955,
So Rare.
''For those of us who were alive in 1 955.''
Christ.
1 955. That's the year this little girl was born.
Yeah.
Twenty years later, tissue specimens in a jar.
Yeah.
-What do you think, Phil?
-I don't think anything.
Let Santoro tell us what to think.
Shit, we're all in trouble if we let Santoro tell us what to think.
Assistant District Attorney Lyman,
please contact your office.
How's your kid?
I didn't get to see him. He was asleep.
But Nancy gave me a lot of shit.
Inspector Ryan, you have a call on Line 2.
-How's Nicole?
-She's fine.
Just fine.
A museum piece. He cut up his boyfriend.
Been laughing ever since.
We think he swallowed a French tickler.
-What killed the Hollinger girl?
-Sodium secobarbital.
Did she pop, too?
No needle marks, no traces of skag.
She had enough reds in her, though, to wipe out the LA Philharmonic.
She had a sheet on her: grass bust two months ago, Malibu yacht party?
She also had semen in her.
-Where?
-Everywhere.
In every orifice, as they say.
-Gang bang?
-I don't think so.
There wasn't a bruise on the body.
What about the parents?
They're due back in my office right now.
What do you show on your death certificate?
Death due to an overdose of barbiturates, self-induced.
-No indications of violence?
-Like I said, there wasn't a mark on her.
Okay, release the body, close it up.
That might not be so easy, Chief.
See, my partner here, Sgt. Louis Belgrave?
He believes that the girl's father is a crazy.
And why, may I ask, do you think that the girl's father is a crazy?
I just hate white folks.
After lunch,
I got something else for you guys.
Get me Supervisor Arnold on the private line.
Like I was saying, you sure look lousy, Phil.
You know, you ought to get out in the sun more. You ought to fish.
I hate to fish, John.
I hate to see them flopping around the deck.
Yeah. With their little gills opening and closing, searching the air for a little water.
Get out of here.
Phil, the girl's father...
-is he anyone?
-No, John. He's no one.
Hello?
How are you, Larry? I'm fine.
On that teenager in the beach district?
It's a suicide, Larry.
No, just a simple suicide.
-You know, you've really lost weight.
-Do you think so?
Probably the shirt-maker.
I can tell the difference.
Listen, let's make it a weekend thing.
You bring a girlfriend.
-Which one?
-Oh, the....
The redhead.
-Rusty?
-Rusty, yes.
We'll go to Catalina.
Can you afford us?
The government takes care of that.
-Do you think you can handle both of us?
-If I run out of breath, I'll watch.
That's dangerous. If you watch too long, you could forget how.
Let's go topside.
No, I like it better open. Here. Yeah.
-How's Phil?
-Okay.
You two still living together?
We enjoy a passionate truce.
-Bring Miss Britton a drink, please.
-Yes.
-Bloody mary.
-Yes, sir.
I've got to get back to the city.
-No.
-Yes.
Five minutes. Relax now.
We'll have a little one for the road.
I'll be right back.
-Your drink, madame.
-Thank you.
Operator, I want to make a long-distance call to Akron, Ohio.
-I'm not too late, am I?
-Almost.
Don't drive too fast, okay?
They're still not here yet.
What about that photo?
-What photo?
-That photo.
Oh, that photo.
-What about it?
-It was in the wallet.
You think this photo is important, do you?
Yes, I do. Leo the Kingfish.
I think I see a familiar face here.
So do I. So what?
-You know what I'm thinking.
-Don't be a pain in the ass.
I think I'll have them turn it into 35 mm slides.
Eddie, got something for you.
Slides and blowups.
-Good morning.
-We're late, I'm sorry.
No problem. Right this way.
Good morning.
Take a seat, please.
These are your daughter's personal effects.
This envelope contains her license, wallet, and money.
I have a release here for these items.
If you'll sign it in triplicate, you can claim your daughter's body.
What happened to Gloria?
According to the autopsy report,
''Death due to barbiturate poisoning.
''Chemical agent believed to be sodium secobarbital.''
Coroner's verdict is ''Self-induced.'' Suicide.
My daughter did not commit suicide.
Suicide is the number one killer of teenagers in America today.
-I can give you statistics that go on and on--
-I don't give a damn about statistics.
How do they know it was self-induced?
What was she doing on the beach?
Who was she with last?
-Where did she get the dope?
-Marty, it's all here.
It's all official, it's documented.
The only thing in there is what they want to put in there.
And everybody knows it's all a goddamn pack of lies.
I'd like to talk to your husband alone a minute if you don't mind.
-All right.
-Thank you.
Louis, would you get Mrs. Hollinger a cup of coffee, please?
Sure.
It's just out here.
When was the last time you saw your daughter?
A few weeks ago.
-Did you know she had a police record?
-Yes, I know about that.
Everybody in the country smokes pot.
What's that got to do with her death?
-Do you know where she lived?
-No.
What difference does that make?
-When was the last time you talked to her?
-I told you, a few weeks ago.
-What did you talk to her about?
-That's none of your damn business.
You're goddamn right it isn't.
So sign that release.
Claim your daughter's body and get on with your life.
Sorry. It's your daughter's watch.
It was left out of the envelope.
Still full of water.
A wasted little girl on the beach.
Bury it, forget it, like it never happened.
Is that the way you want it, Lieutenant?
That's the way I want it, yes.
If I showed up here with a high-priced attorney... things would be a damn sight different, wouldn't they?
You know what I think?
I think you're looking for a heavy.
I think you're looking for a relationship that never existed.
I've been very patient with you.
-You listen--
-Don't interrupt me.
This department operates on crimes with a victim.
Your daughter was not a homicide victim.
So the case is closed. Nobody cares.
Don't tell me nobody cares.
Sometimes we don't have time to care.
But we're all you got.
Okay, Mr. Hollinger, right this way.
Sometimes you can't tell the Christians from the lions.
Lieutenant?
I want to pick up Gloria's clothes.
The money's in the envelope.
You wanna count it?
No, I don't have to count it.
I wanna explain something to you.
You've gotta understand something.
The only thing in the world my husband lived for was Gloria.
See, years ago...
Marty was in Korea... and he's just never been the same since.
I can't reason with him anymore.
I don't think he can handle this.
Not many people can, Mrs. Hollinger.
There's a phone number on this card, they know where I am if you wanna call me.
Thank you.
-I told you he was a crazy.
-Everybody's a crazy, Louis.
None for me, thanks.
Yeah? Just a minute, he's putting away a bottle.
Oh, shit. Keep the soldiers away.
Come on.
What is it?
Jerry Bellamy. Two dead ladies in a garment factory on Maple Street... and a live one hostage. Asking for me.
Another fan?
Hold your fire! Get some gas in there.
Come on, get some more gas in there!
Pour it in!
They're coming around.
Stop that goddamn tear gas or I'll blow her fucking head off!
Jerry, you don't have to worry, old buddy...
no more tear gas.
Just a friendly little talk. Okay, Jerry?
I got the lady, ace.
I know you got the lady,
that's why I came to see you.
Just wanna talk a little, all right?
All right. Come on up, goddamn it.
And get rid of that goddamn speaker.
Please, God.
-Jerry!
-In here.
I'm so afraid he's gonna kill me.
Please don't make him nervous.
God help me.
He's gonna kill me. Please.
You've been busy, Jerry.
You should've got here sooner, Lieutenant.
Been a long time, Jerry.
-Please, God.
-I can do a lot of damage with this.
Yeah, I can see that, old buddy.
Don't call me that. I used to like you, man.
I still like you, Jerry.
You screwed me!
And they took my friend away.
They gave me electric shocks!
I'm gonna stop that, I'm not gonna let them do that to you anymore.
You're full of shit! Just like everybody.
This cow goes, too, man, just like the others.
You don't want to do that, Jerry.
You hurt the lady, they'll put wires in your ears again.
-You don't want that, do you?
-Get down on your knees.
Please, mister, do what he says.
He's crazy, he'll kill me.
-Shut up! Get down on your knees.
-What?
Get down on your goddamn knees!
Come on!
Please, I'm so afraid.
All right, I'm down on my knees.
Do whatever you want with me.
-Oh, please.
-Let the lady go.
Fucking cow!
You know she tried to strangle me?
Didn't you, you goddamn cow?
You moo-moo. I'm gonna kill her, man!
That's wrong, Jerry.
Your mother strangled you.
-This lady doesn't even know you.
-Enough of that!
Cow! Goddamn strangling cow!
I'm going to kill her!
Christ's sake, man, it's over!
Those son of a bitches never die.
-It's all right. It's over.
-It hurts so much.
The medics are on their way.
It's over, Captain.
All right, cool it.
Hold on, they'll take good care of you.
Just lay back there, take it easy, relax.
It's all right.
Christ, this place looks like a goddamn battlefield.
You start the paperwork,
I'll fill in the holes, all right?
Phil? You all right?
He's fine, he'll be okay.
Get this cleaned up.
-Marty, I think you've had enough.
-You're damn right I've had enough.
The thing to remember, Marty, is your wife's father.
Through his entire life that man never lost faith.
-That's true. To the very end he was--
-He was full of shit.
-You've got no right to say that.
-And you're full of shit.
Her father was a white Protestant nobody, like we are... and the reason nobody gives a damn about Gloria is because we don't count.
And all your sanctity isn't going to change that.
Marty, Gloria committed suicide because we failed her.
You had no time for her and I had nothing to say to her.
You must not blame yourselves.
Gloria's death was by divine order.
Horseshit!
-Oh, God, Marty! That's enough.
-Sure it's enough.
A man's child has a right to die with dignity... and a man has the right to answers.
And a man's drawers shouldn't be full of payment books and old medals... and wake up every morning knowing that his life's 90 days late.
That's your goddamned obsession!
You've always been obsessed.
You're never satisfied.
One job, two jobs, overtime, never enough!
You chased Gloria right out of this house!
Don't you ever say that to me again.
Get your hand off of me.
I did not chase her out.
That child wanted things.
She saw how much we didn't have.
You understand?
You can't hide what you don't have.
She chased the things she didn't have, and they killed her.
I don't see why we shouldn't have a little nightcap.
I'll drink to that.
-And besides, it's raining outside.
-I'll drink to that, too, shit.
Here's looking at you, sweetheart.
That's the worst Humphrey Bogart
I've ever seen.
-Don't make fun of my heroes.
-Shit. He was mine, too.
Him and Garfield, Robeson.
-How do you know about John Garfield?
-The Late Show.
You know what's on The Late Show, every night this week on Channel 9.
-No, what?
-Moby Dick.
-Yeah, you got to watch it.
-Why?
Because of that frigging white whale.
You got to--
Okay, I'll watch the white whale.
Every man's in search of a white whale.
And when you find him... he usually kills you.
Yeah?
What are you going to do about Sellers?
What?
What are you going to do about Leo Sellers?
Nothing.
The man was in a swimming pool with the Hollinger girl.
There's no crime there. It's over, finished.
-She's got joy juice in all three holes.
-Joy juice.
Plus 2,000 grains of reds and she's sitting poolside with the Kingfish.
So what?
If you'd look inside the Hollinger girl's head, you know what you'd find?
An ambitious loser.
My guess is she had one last fling, took a handful of pills... then gave up. No more, no less.
But why is the daughter of a nobody... sitting at a pool with Leo Sellers?
Because Leo pays women for their company.
He pays and he owns.
He thinks he owns.
He likes to get in a swimming pool with young hookers.
Leo likes all kinds of hookers.
We really ought to see him, Phil.
Buenas noches, Louis.
If that was your little girl, you'd sure in hell see Leo.
Did I ever tell you my father was killed in the Spanish Civil War?
Yeah?
Month before he was killed, he wrote my mother a letter... last letter she ever got.
You know what it said?
''The Spanish die of heartbreak, the French die of cirrhosis...
''and the Americans die of enthusiasm.''
Bingo.
You were apprehended fleeing from the crime scene... carrying a bag of women's shoes.
What do you do with these shoes?
I'm a collector.
Recognize that shoe?
-Do you want to taste it?
-Yeah, I recognize the shoe.
Lady claims you stole this shoe from her in the park.
She said she was throwing them away.
She claims you grabbed her by the leg and forcibly removed it.
That's a moot point.
Ever think of going to a shoe store and buying a pair of ladies' shoes?
At today's prices?
We're going to put you in the cooler overnight... to await arraignment in the morning.
-Sergeant, could I ask you a question?
-Yeah.
-Could I take the shoes with me?
-We're holding these for evidence.
-Would you keep the bag tightly closed?
-What for?
It keeps them fresh.
Yeah, we'll take care of it.
Could I have a receipt?
The whale!
Shut it off.
After the whale.
What's wrong?
Just stoned on fatigue.
But you were all right this morning.
Was your day that bad?
Yeah.
This morning was a long time ago.
A long time ago.
Before a butcher shop and a garment factory.
Before facing the white whale.
Been a long, long day in Guatemala.
It's over now.
You're right. Now it's over.
The earth and the sea
shall give up the dead.
And the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in them... shall be cleansed and made like His own glorious body.
According to the mighty working whereby
He is able to subdue all things unto Himself.
You don't buy the suicide?
I just think this case deserves some answers.
-Answers to what?
-The questions I just raised.
I'm standing right here waiting for reasons, logic... not conjecture.
Why do you suppose this girl was murdered?
It's our job to make sure she wasn't.
Wrong, God damn it, wrong!
We don't look for victims.
We're thrown victims.
Christ, we're up to our ass in victimless crimes.
-Victims.
-Louis is very stubborn.
What the hell happened to justice?
That's all I want to know!
We got a machine downstairs that tells us all about justice.
Jesus H. Christ!
Sit down, Sergeant.
What the hell are you laughing at?
I'd like to know what the two of you were doing yesterday.
That was strictly soldier business:
SWAT squad, Riot squad.
It's not tactical business.
I don't know. I've been very kind to you.
I give you trips to Rome.
I keep you out of harm's way... and you give me heartburn.
You're confusing daring police work with greasy wop food.
What greasy wop food?
My doctor's got me on carrot juice.
Here.
There's a Pan Am flight 51 6 arriving at LA International... at 4:30 from Panama City.
That man will be on it.
The Federal people have asked us to put a tail on him and place a tap if possible.
-Who is he?
-Suspected Arab terrorist.
-Jesus. What's he after?
-They don't know.
What is he? A spic or a camel-jumper?
He uses the name Yussef Karim.
I don't know, all of them Arabs look alike to me.
-Join a march, Louis.
-See what I got to put up with?
You picked him.
How's your girlfriend?
She's terrific.
I think I'll have Vice bust her on Christmas Eve.
I'll put her in with all those penned-up bull dykes... and give them a present for the holidays.
What the fuck are you laughing at?
You're really something, you know that?
You really are.
You're the only Roman Catholic who goes to confession... and doesn't have anything to confess.
You're a goddamn saint, John.
Get out of here.
My partner here, he's got a slide he wants you to look at... of Leo Sellers and the Hollinger girl.
-I don't want to look at it.
-Doesn't want to look at it.
I take your word for it.
So Sellers had a number going with a suicidal teenager, so?
Two teenagers, Chief.
-Who's the other girl?
-Gloria's roommate.
Okay. You told me. The coroner said suicide.
-Anything else?
-Yeah. You ought to lay off that carrot juice.
I hear if you drink enough of it your balls fall off.
-I'm Gloria's father.
-Yes.
-Come in.
-Thank you.
Her things are in the trunk... and I have a few letters and photographs.
-What did Gloria do?
-I've already told the police everything.
This black detective came and questioned me. I told him everything.
I wish you'd forget the police.
I want you to tell me what happened.
-Gloria danced.
-Where?
-Some club on Sunset Boulevard.
-What kind of dancing?
One of those strip places.
You mean she danced naked?
I suppose so.
She dated an MC there once in a while.
That's the fellow that she went out with.
Where was this taken?
All of these were taken out in Pasadena.
A big house.
That's by the swimming pool.
Is 51 6 on time?
The flight's right on time, sir.
It's on time.
I know the bartender up at the Air France lounge. You wanna have a drink?
All I can handle is a Coke.
What?
All I want is a Coke.
-A Coke?
-Yeah, my stomach's crapped out.
-Hi, Phil.
-Hi, Irving.
What'll it be?
A Bushmill's straight up and a Coke for my brother.
Same and a Coke.
I meant to see that movie last night, but I missed--
Hey, listen.
...ready for boarding at Gate Number 1 7.
TWA announces flight 840
for New York and Rome.
-Flight 840 for Rome.
-Now ready for boarding at Gate Number 1 7.
-I've never been, so it doesn't bother me.
-It bothers me.
-Bushmill's and a Coke.
-Thank you, Irving.
TransWorld Airlines for....
Listen, old buddy.
You better lay off of Santoro.
You're gonna be back playing grab-ass with $5 hookers again.
Fuck Santoro.
He's got all the buttons.
I don't give a shit if he's a five-star general.
-Did you see the ass on that?
-I saw it.
-Think it's real?
-Yeah, what do you think it is?
Can't be sure any more.
They make new asses.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
I read about it in Time Magazine.
There's a surgeon over in Geneva.
Yeah. Takes sagging asses and makes new ones.
-Nothing wrong with that.
-Yeah.
No wonder that country never went to war.
Wonderful place.
Survives on hot money, chocolate... and rebuilt keisters.
Attention please, Pan American
announces its flight 51 6...
-from Panama City....
-That's us.
-I got to pee.
-I'm gonna have another drink.
That guy will be in Customs for another half an hour.
-All right.
-Irving, another one.
Okay.
-Phil.
-Yeah?
I was up all last night thinking about it.
As a favor to me, will you see Sellers?
-What the hell am I gonna talk to Sellers--
-You know, the questions.
Yeah. ''Did you knock off the daughter of a war-wounded nobody?''
How's that for starters?
I changed my mind.
I think I'll have that drink.
Irving, a Bushmill's for me, please.
-Coming up.
-Go pee.
...there's a call for you.
Please pick up the white telephone, Line 3.
How about that? Ain't that something?
That's something.
Hey, Phil. You know I've been thinking.
Do you think it's really... sideways?
God, I hope so.
And there she goes!
Little Linda! A loaded pistol.
Let's give the little lady a big hand.
That's about it.
That wraps it up for the Scanty Clad.
Be back in about 20 minutes.
New show, new faces. You'll have to see it.
-That's the same birthmark.
-It's Mr. Richards!
The sooner I get out of here, the better.
-Anything happen, Charley?
-The man called.
I've got to know something.
You might be my son.
You might be loco.
Loco. Why?
It's Herbie Dalitz.
Please tell Mr. Sellers I returned his call.
-You gonna need me later?
-I don't know, I couldn't get the man.
I was counting on it.
Look, sweetheart, you stick close to a phone.
If there's some kind of a party, I'll buzz you.
What about you, Herbie?
I'm still working, baby.
I got another show in 20 minutes.
As far as I know,
I've never been in Texas before in my life.
You clean up.
Have Branson bring you up to the house.
-I do miss Paris.
-All those old love affairs?
No. For the food.
There isn't one civilized place for the food here.
Christ, you're such a snob.
I hear that McDonald's is opening up a store on the Champs 蒷ys閑s.
Never. Paris stands like a fortress against the hamburger.
That's what they said about Coca-Cola.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
Bingo!
Why did you bring me here?
I like it here.
I like to get drunk here.
What are you trying to tell me?
That I care about you.
But I'm.... Oh, shit!
I'm starting to draw dirty pictures about what you do.
I'm not that tough.
I have no right to draw pictures around our relationship.
But it's happening.
I'm falling off of the arrangement.
But you understand that this is your problem, not mine?
You are the only man that ever brought compassion into bed with me.
I never felt that from any man.
And I love you for that.
Is that enough?
No.
No, it's not.
My father loved me, too.
But he was just like you.
He was obsessed with being right.
And he got killed for that. Blown up.
Placing plastique in a car on the Avenue Montaigne.
And then I was really alone.
I've always been alone.
Take care of me, Phil.
Take care and I'll stop doing what I do.
I can't.
I can't, not yet.
Then leave things as they are. Just love me.
I don't know how to do that.
I don't know how to do that.
I wish to Christ I did.
I must go.
Where?
-I just have to go.
-Where?
To the dirty pictures.
-And the money.
-And the money!
That's naughty.
Yes, I can see that. That's naughty.
What nasty things you're telling me.
Yes, I can see that.
And what are you doing now?
I mean, right this second.
I'd like that. No, don't.
No, don't, take it easy.
Isn't it better like that?
Yes. Me, too.
We'll try that next time.
You mean just my boots? Yes.
Oh, white pants. I--
This is your Roto-Rooter man.
Your plumbing's stuck.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing!
I'm saving some psyched-out son of a bitch $1 00.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
-Where do you think you're going?
-Let go of me, Phil!
You sick little bitch!
I'm leaving! Right now!
You want to know where I'm going?
-That's what you want, isn't it?
-What do you think you're doing?
The dirtier I feel, the cleaner you feel.
That's enough now! I'm leaving anyway!
Well, then, take it all! Take all of it!
You know, you say you sleep with me.
I'm just an excuse for you, that's all!
You know something? You have to know.
You don't make love with me.
You have confession with me!
Well, I've got news for you!
You think I'm going to the circus tonight.
You know what the program is?
Get off!
No!
I will go anyway!
Bitch, you goddamn bitch!
Salaud! No!
No!
Operator, I want to make
a long-distance call to Akron, Ohio.
I'll pay here. The area code is 2 1 6...
77 1-376....
The dulcet tones of Counselor Sellers, right?
Right.
I've heard that voice drone on in court, charming the pants off juries.
Where'd you get it?
We have an ongoing tap on a public booth at the marina.
There have been pleasure boats slipping smack up from Mexico.
Now and then we get something.
But this is out of our domain.
-This is political.
-How so?
That number connects to a public booth in Akron, Ohio, Division and Fifth Street.
Opposite a union headquarters.
Three men came out of that building and were blown up... almost simultaneous to this call.
-Blown up?
-Blown up.
And Counselor Sellers happens to represent that union.
Bingo.
-You mind if I keep this?
-Sure.
In itself, it's not incriminating, and legally it's inadmissible.
But you fellows deal with matters political.
I thought you'd be interested.
Yeah, we might be interested.
I owe you one, Jim.
Take care of that bump on your head.
Yeah, Doc. Yeah, that's right.
Yes, the pills worked just fine.
Why didn't you call us when it happened?
-Marty wanted me to wait.
-I'll check in with you....
-Till he looked better or felt better?
-No.
-Can I get you some coffee or something?
-No, thank you.
Black, please.
Thank you, Doc.
How you feeling, Marty?
-I feel terrible.
-You look terrible.
Sit down.
-Mind if I smoke, Marty?
-No, go ahead.
Talked to Peggy Summers.
She said she left Gloria at a party that night she died.
We knew that.
But did she tell you what kind of a party it was?
No, she didn't say.
It was a sex party in a mansion in Pasadena.
-Tell you whose mansion it was?
-She only knew the man as Leo.
Tell you his last name?
Just Leo.
But I did get a photograph of the man.
She also told me that Peggy danced in a nightclub on the Strip... a place called the Scanty Clad Club... and that she sometimes dated the MC there.
Man by the name of Herbie Dalitz.
-Do you mind if we keep this?
-No, go ahead.
-Thursday night I went there.
-Why?
Because I told you, I'm going to find out what happened to my daughter.
Thank you.
There was something in that autopsy report we didn't tell you about.
-Your daughter had traces of semen in her.
-So what?
An inordinate amount of semen.
I had a right to know that.
I didn't think you could handle it.
Marty, that place you were at,
Santa Monica Boulevard, the Sunset Strip... that whole sex-for-sale business, that's run by very organized people.
Very organized.
An amateur like you can't go up against professionals.
You think Gloria was part of that?
I think your daughter ran in very dangerous company.
Can you think of anything else?
-No.
-All right then.
-What about the photograph?
-What about it?
Peggy told me the man's name, an attorney, a very important attorney.
So what, Marty?
Your daughter committed suicide.
There's nothing we can do that can change that.
That just ain't good enough, Lieutenant.
It isn't fair.
I've got a dead little girl and
I'm gonna find out what happened to her.
You understand that?
-I'll make a deal with you, Marty.
-What kind of a deal?
I'll find out everything there is to find out about your daughter's death.
Everything. But you've got to stay out of it.
You've got to keep your nose out of it.
All right?
Yeah, all right.
-Good afternoon.
-See you later.
Maybe you're right.
You gotta trust somebody.
I want you to run out to Venice and shake down that Summers girl, okay?
Okay.
It's a break she didn't tell Marty
Leo's last name, huh?
You're not kidding.
We got to keep it that way.
You think Marty would try to burn him?
I don't know.
Hey, where the hell you going?
Dalitz in?
Upstairs, through the kitchen.
-How's it going?
-It's great to be in show business.
There's a cop on his way up.
Welcome to the show. Bachelor Number 1...
is a makeup artist for films and stage.
He's interested in photography.
He's a movie buff....
-Hello, Herbie.
-Hey, Lieutenant. How are you?
Fine, just fine.
Take a walk, Charley.
Business administration student,
Bachelor Number 2...
plans on a career in banking.
He collects early jazz and blues records.
Here is Tim Freitag.
Tim, attaboy.
Hey, come on, Phil, Charley loves that show.
What do you want here?
You're not working Vice, are you?
I said take a walk, Charley.
Take a walk!
Oh, my God!
Charley, take a walk!
All the way out of the building.
All the way to Sunset Boulevard.
Find a massage parlor... they'll rub your leg, make you feel better.
-Sit down, Herbie.
-What's all the rough stuff for?
I said, sit down!
Okay, I'm sitting, Phil. I'm sitting.
Listen, did you hear the one I'm doing in the show, about a guy walks in the elevator... and there's a naked broad there, and he says to her:
''My wife's got that same outfit.''
That's funny, right?
I think I'm making a comeback around here.
I swear to God, the waiters, the busboys, they're really laughing it up.
What can I tell you? It's just a couple of cooze we balled around with.
The girl on the left, she was found dead a little over a week ago.
What have I got to do with that? She was just some hooker. A kid. Gloria something.
She used to dance around here... and then she made some of those hardcore flicks.
Who did she make the pictures for?
That company that Leo fronts...
Cinema something, I don't know.
Anyhow, Leo saw her in one of those films... and asked me to bring her and the other girl up to the house.
When was the last time you saw her?
I don't remember.
It was a week ago last Saturday, up at Leo's place.
Leo's place, a week ago Saturday.
What happened?
Nothing, we blew a little leaf, the other girl left... and we stuck around and had a little party with this Gloria.
Who else was there?
There was Leo and me... and some rock and roll freak.
Christ, that Hollinger kid could never get enough.
I saw her in this two-reeler.
She was a very pretty girl.
Very wild, very sensual.
I had her to some parties.
-What kind of parties?
-Parties.
Say, I've got some great natural carrot juice up at the office.
I'll pass.
-There's nothing like it.
-Yeah, I hear it's great for the ovaries.
Something stronger?
Yeah, that'd be fine.
We'll go into Harry's.
-Mr. Sellers.
-My table open? Chilled vermouth.
Bushmill's straight up. Water on the side.
It's fashioned after Harry's in Florence.
Yeah, I know.
Well, take your pick.
Be comfortable.
-Tell me some more about Gloria Hollinger.
-That girl fascinated me.
I watched her up on the screen there.
She could get milk out of a crowbar.
I had Herbie run her down for me.
Give her a job at the club.
Tossed her some money for some private work.
She wanted things.
So she balled around trying to grab a bright light.
You can't blame her for that.
Every other beauty contest winner does the same thing.
Cogent cultural comment.
-Good health.
-Cheers.
Was Gloria your girl?
''Your girl''?
I haven't heard that phrase since the '30s.
Well that's my problem, Leo.
I'm a student of the '30s.
I love the '30s. Cole Porter, Dizzy Dean... clean air, clean water... and young girls were treated with respect.
Don't make a big number out of this.
I'm not making a number out of it.
You had her number, and now she's dead.
No number.
That girl suffered severe psychic pain long before I met her.
Psychic pain? Wow.
-You're an expert on psychic pain?
-Every good attorney is.
Yes, but you didn't help that girl, Counselor.
I never damaged that girl.
Listen, Phil... that girl left my house about 2:00 a.m., in a taxi.
And that's the last time I saw Gloria.
All right.
I'd like to have a copy of that film you made with her.
It'll be at your office in an hour.
That kid's father... was he anybody?
No, Leo.
He was just one of those middle-class Americans... who thinks you get 40,000 miles on a new set of tires.
Yeah.
You represent a company called...
The Great Lakes Transport Alliance, don't you, Leo?
That's right.
Did you know that three men were blown up in Akron, Ohio?
It's a big country.
People get killed every day.
There's a pool-hall rumor that you're the honorary capo.
Everybody shoots pool.
You running policy slips?
Yeah, death policies.
This phone number belongs to a public booth in Akron, Ohio.
Phone booth faces union headquarters.
A phone call was placed to that number from a booth... at the LA marina almost to the second three union officials were blown up.
The call was made at 3:05 on the 1 6th,
Leo, and you made that call.
My God!
-There's nothing sacred anymore, is there?
-No, there isn't.
-The 1 6th?
-Right, the 1 6th.
Oddly enough,
I was in the vicinity on that date.
Let's see... in bed... with a lady we both admire.
Besides which, Phil... nothing you have... is legally germane to anything.
Who gets killed today, Leo?
Like I said, I saw Nicole recently.
You two have set up house.
That's right.
You're a very understanding man, Phil.
Considering what Nicole does for a living.
Everybody hustles, Leo.
Well, yeah, but... brilliant whores become courtesans.
I think Nicole likes it.
Ciao, Phil.
Phil?
Where are you?
I'm in here.
What time did you get home?
-About the other night.
-What about the other night?
I want you to know I never see my sins when I'm with you. Never.
We made a deal.
I do what I do, and I know what you do, and it's killing me.
Because I love you.
You must know that.
I knew it.
But I didn't think you could ever say it.
I've always loved you.
I smell your goddamn perfume all day long.
You know what I'm telling you?
We're going to bust out of here. I promise.
Soon.
I'm Ava Gardner.
And we're in Madrid... and they're playing
The Music Goes Round and Round.
And if you say ''bingo''....
Bingo.
-Want to run that again, Lieutenant?
-No, thanks.
Christ. How far can a kid fall?
When survival is threatened...
-who knows?
-She's just a kid.
A white kid at that, her survival wasn't threatened.
Depends on how you define survival.
Shit, I don't know.
Charley, rewind that film. We'll wait for it.
-So you still think Sellers is clean?
-Yeah, I think he's clean.
The Summers girl admitted that Leo was the man in the photo.
-She didn't say Leo who.
-No, she's scared of him.
She's also afraid of Marty.
What are you going to tell him?
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
Nothing.
You were never going to tell him anything, were you?
-Bingo.
-That's charming, that's really charming.
Belgrave.
Paula Hollinger for you.
-Do you always drink martinis?
-Why not?
-Aren't they sophisticated enough?
-Oh, yeah.
I never know what to do with the olives.
Yeah, I never know what to do with the onion.
And you always drink Bushmill's?
-No. I used to drink....
-What?
Pink ladies, but I didn't think it was very butch.
Why'd you let him get out of the house?
He wouldn't listen to me.
He just went out.
He's liable to get hurt. Badly.
-I think.... Oh, sorry--
-It's all right. No big thing.
Thank you.
-Good health.
-Good health.
You said Marty was never the same after Korea. What did you mean by that?
He hardly spoke.
We almost never made love.
What about his relationship with Gloria?
What was that like?
They were very close.
Were you?
With who?
With Gloria.
When Gloria was 3 years old... she walked into my bedroom.
And she saw me with another man.
A man I was crazy about.
-When she was 3 years old?
-Yeah.
Would have been 1 956, '57?
Where was Marty then?
Marty was in a VA hospital.
Charming.
Look, you've got to understand something.
Marty was in deep therapy. I didn't even know if he was going to be released.
I needed someone.
I'm sure you did.
I don't expect you to understand.
Oh, no, you live in a right-and-wrong world.
Oh, yeah, I'm a real Cub Scout.
God, doesn't anything move you, Lieutenant?
I mean, haven't you ever loved someone? Anyone?
-I've been in love all my life.
-With who?
Driftwood.
Yeah, I love driftwood.
Old bands.
Old songs.
Old ballplayers.
Old soldiers.
What about a girl? Don't you have a girl?
Yeah, I got a girl. She's a nurse.
-Check, please?
-All right.
When Gloria walked in on you...
-what kind of an effect did it have on her?
-She never mentioned it.
But she never kissed me after that.
-Did Marty know about it?
-Yeah.
Years later, I told him.
And he left me for six months.
And that's when Gloria moved out.
Did Marty know that Gloria wasn't his daughter?
How do you know that?
I don't know. Just guessed.
I'll give you a lift home.
The lights are on. Marty must be home.
He never went out, did he?
No, he didn't.
I just don't want Marty hurt any more.
I wanted you to know everything.
Well, that's very commendable.
-You must think I'm the all-time bitch.
-No, I don't.
You said I live in a right and a wrong world.
I've listened to confessions all my life.
I don't judge anybody.
You want to come in?
Can I get you something?
Yeah.
What?
Artie Shaw.
-Good night, Lieutenant.
-Good night.
See that guy sitting over there?
The one with the beard?
...my wrist green.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
What about him?
He's a lawyer.
He represented a guy I busted once.
Tried to sell me some skag.
I had him cold.
Tried to sell the dope to me.
And then... he hired the bearded fellow for his lawyer.
The day of the trial, he showed up... and the judge did everything but stand at attention.
What do you mean?
Well, I had a kid from the D.A.'s office representing me.
He wore a green J.C. Penney suit.
And a red tie. Had coffee stains on it.
And the bearded guy... he represented the dealer.
And he wore a $400 jacket... and a $2,000 Swiss watch... and wore tinted shades.
And in about 30 seconds he destroyed the kid in the green J.C. Penney suit.
The dealer walked out, and gave me the finger.
You win, you lose. That's the game.
Yeah.
Except I remember attorneys without beards and $400 jackets.
The game seemed a little more balanced then.
Shall we?
-I can't believe that.
-It's true.
Pardon me, Counselor.
I don't mean to break anything up.
We met about three years ago in court.
And I just never got over how well-dressed you were.
Well, enjoy your lunch, and my best to your tailor.
Thank--
Why!
The fare was $25.60,
she gave him $4.40 tip.
She told the driver
she wanted to walk on the beach.
She danced in the Scanty Clad Club.
You still don't realize what business
your daughter was in, do you?
-What kind of business are you talking--
-Sex-for-dollars business.
Bullshit! My daughter was used by someone!
Someone who hosted those parties.
Someone big. Someone with juice.
Who are you protecting, Lieutenant?
We don't have to protect anybody,
Mr. Hollinger. The truth is... your daughter committed suicide all by herself.
I don't buy that for one goddamn minute.
Someone's paid someone off here.
You guys are all bought and paid for, everybody knows that.
You cops are a nickel a bunch.
Come on, Mr. Hollinger, we're going to the movies.
Jimmy, set up the Hollinger two-reeler.
We're on our way down.
Come in.
Oh, Hal!
Kill it, Charley.
No!
Tell me! Do you hear me!
-No!
-Tell me!
-Tell me! Do you hear me?
-No!
-Tell me!
-I don't know anything! No!
Tell me the name! The name!
I don't know.
-Leo, that's all I know.
-Leo who?
My daughter's dead and I've got nothing to lose. You understand that!
Now give me the name!
-No!
-Give me that name, you bitch!
Leo Sellers.
-Did you see Marty's face?
-Yeah.
I don't think I'll ever forget his face.
We're in a hell of a business, Louis.
Do all the wrong things for all the right reasons.
We shouldn't have to do that to any man.
Det. Louis Belgrave, red line please.
Belgrave. Yeah, Peggy.
Yeah. When?
I understand, Peggy.
Okay. We're on it. Thanks for calling.
That was Peggy Summers.
Marty tried to kill her, so she had to tell him about Sellers.
-How long ago?
-An hour.
-An hour ago?
-An hour ago.
-Did you check Sellers' house?
-I can't. He might burn Marty on sight.
We should get soldiers.
They're not going to get there any quicker than we do.
Goddamn it, we should have been
in on this from the top.
This wouldn't have happened.
What should I do? Dig up the girl,
arrest her for killing herself?
No, just some answers.
You could've given Marty some answers.
Believe me, Mr. Hollinger,
you're making a bad mistake.
Now, if it's a matter of some compensation,
I'm willing to--
Keep your hands on the desk.
Whatever you say.
I simply wish you'd believe me.
Look, no one made your daughter do anything she didn't want to do.
But I understand how you feel.
After all, I'm a parent myself.
My daughter and I enjoy....
Ask yourself the truth.
Aren't you trying to expiate your own guilt through some violent act?
-You killed Gloria.
-That's simply not true.
Will my death bring back Gloria?
Be reasonable.
Gloria was involved with a lot of people.
Why single me out?
Because I can't kill everyone.
-What about the guy in the hall?
-He's out cold.
Jesus Christ, Marty.
Watch Commander? This is Sgt. Belgrave.
We got a 1 87 at 1 1 55 Oak Grove Avenue, San Marino.
You finally did it, didn't you, Marty?
Couldn't leave it alone, could you?
You want to know what your horoscope is, Marty?
I'm no fortune teller, but I can tell you what's going to happen to you.
They're going to put you in a cage... down on the funny farm for about 1 0 years.
You're going to play Juliet to some faggot's Romeo.
And they're going to rape you with regularity.
They're going to feed you through a tube.
You're worse than dead, Marty.
You're an exhibit.
-I want my day in court.
-No shit.
The country owes me that.
I want my day in court.
Your day in court, my ass!
What country? What court?
Don't you know where you live?
Can't you smell the bananas?
You know what country you live in?
You live in Guatemala with color television.
Guys like you ought to die in combat!
-He murdered Gloria.
-You don't understand, do you, Marty?
You're not supposed to kill important citizens like Leo Sellers.
-He killed Gloria.
-No, he didn't.
He killed a lot of other people.
He didn't kill your daughter.
Your daughter drowned on the banana river.
I want my day in court.
Where'd you get the gun, Marty?
Where'd you get the gun, Marty?
Pawn shop.
Did you give him your name?
-Did you give him your right name, Marty?
-No.
He charged me $400.
That's the going rate, no-name guns.
-What the hell you think you're doing, Phil?
-Shut up, Louis!
Phil!
Jesus Christ.
You just had your day in court, Marty.
Now listen to me, Marty.
Marty, listen to me!
You came to talk to Leo Sellers.
You got in an argument.
He pulled the gun. You struggled.
You got hit, and he got killed.
You understand what I'm saying, Marty?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.
-You expect me to swear to this?
-Goddamn right I do!
-Phil!
-Grab it, goddamn it!
You are crazy.
You can't fuck with these things.
I know I can't, but I did.
And you're in it, Louis.
You're in it. All the way.
My friend Marty and I, we're going to swear to it in court.
You're locked in, Louis!
There's got to be a little charity in the system for the Martys... and the albinos, and the Glorias.
-Why?
-'Cause they ain't got no juice!
I never thought I'd do this for anybody.
You're not doing it for anybody.
You're doing it for a nobody.
Where the hell are you going?
We're going downtown.
Then we're going to tell them what we saw.
You killed Leo.
You used Marty just like a hit man.
-Right?
-Wrong!
I'm the one that tried to keep the lid on, remember?
You're the one that kept digging.
Jesus Christ, Louis... there comes a time when you got to try to turn the wheel around.
Okay?
Okay.
What've you got, Lieutenant?
Put your guns away, it's over.
One dead, one unconscious.
-Hello.
-Hello, lady.
-Hi.
-How was your day?
I'm just sitting in Ronald Reagan's sunshine.
I mean, Jerry Brown's sunshine.
What's wrong?
You sound depressed, like you lost a friend.
I didn't lose a friend. You lost a client.
You'll hear about it on the tube.
Just for the hell of it, why don't we....
Why don't we fly up to Frisco?
Steal a little time, you know.
Maybe go to that crazy place over in Sausalito?
What do you say?
I'll meet you at the TWA counter about 4:30, all right?
-You really mean it?
-I really mean it.
Why, it sounds wonderful.
-Nicole?
-Yes?
Are you happy with your work?
Are you proposing?
Who knows? It's very romantic up there.
I got to go back to the station and check in, fill out a report.
I'll pick up some Bushmill's on the way.
-See you in a little while, all right?
-Okay.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-That's $2, thanks very much.
-That's the wrong change.
-What do you mean?
-It was cheaper before.
No, it was $1.39.
-I have to get some more errands.
-It went up 1 0 cents this last--
What you got for $1.25?
Have you got anything for $1.25?
Why doesn't she take a half pint?
She don't want a half pint, she wants a pint.
-I want a whole pint!
-She's too short for a full pint.
Okay, hands on the counter!
You let me out of here! Let me out!
Hands on the counter, asshole!
Come on, give me the money. Come on!
Get in, come on!
Call the police!
Attention...
TransWorld Airlines announces...
flight 840 for New York and Rome...
is now ready for boarding
at Gate Number 1 7.
Good morning. It's 6 a.m. on a beautiful morning in Boston.
These are the top stories:
Mayor White's assistant has met with the Redevelopment Authority...
...over the controversy on the Town Heights project.
Saugus: Police have arrested contractor James McManus...
...on $23 million graft and bribery charges...
...in connection with the Mystic

Mrs. Levine is day five post-cholecystectomy.
She remains afebrile and her previous anorexia is gone, draining well.
An AP chest film is clear.
Her white count is nine-four.
BUN has stabilized at 40.2, good output of 1600cc's.
- Blood cultures?
- No growth times two.
Well, Harris can't nail us on this one.
Next case.
- It was a long time ago.
- And is he good?
Yeah, he can really break it up!
Billy's weird.
He gets so tired.
Do you like this lipstick?
She was terrific.
It's 32 now and going fast.
He can't afford to get out.
I got a thousand shares of that.
We have to have the AP, lateral and
10 units done before they can begin.
It says here, type and cross-match was done yesterday.
Just standard workup procedure.
Well, I don't know.
So it was a clear case of endocarditis.
We're ready when you are, Dr. Wheeler.
No response to antibiotics.
Cut her, okay?
- Sponge.
- Begin to tie off.
It's all politics. Today, for instance...
...Rudnick says to me, "I hear you're the new chief resident in surgery."
- That's great!
- He was testing me.
Then he says that Harris told him...
...that Mark Bellows was going to be the next chief resident.
- Wonderful, Mark.
- But here's the thing.
He waited for me to say I knew about it. That wouldn't look right.
That would look as if I expected it.
So I said I hadn't heard anything.
Heh. You've wanted it for two years.
But there's no point in saying that, is there?
I said, uh...
...I thought it'd be wonderful if it happened.
I said Chandler was doing an excellent job as chief resident.
But I said there was a little room left for improvement.
Chandler's damn good.
I really laid it on thick with old Rudnick.
I told him I was following his hepatic research, cited some references.
He was impressed.
Procedure went well too.
So all in all, it was a good day.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Can you grab me a beer before dinner?
Hey, Mark.
Get your own beer.
- Honey, for chrissakes, come on.
- I want to take a shower.
- I was on call last night.
- So was I.
I know, but I had two arrests...
...aortic aneurysm blew at 4 a.m., had to be done stat.
So I didn't get any sleep, and I'd really like to take a shower.
If you don't mind.
I had a hard day too.
You get in the shower faster than any person alive.
Have a beer. You'll feel better.
I know what'd make me feel better.
Goddamn doctors.
Couldn't have fallen in love with a nurse.
Dorothy on the eighth floor.
She liked me.
My own apartment.
Did you hear about Louis?
What about Louis?
They passed him up as assistant professor.
Guy's really paid his dues too.
Now they don't take him.
Plus his son is waiting for a kidney transplant.
Did you start dinner?
What?
Did you start dinner?
- Did you hear anything I said?
- It's in the fridge. Just heat it up.
- I was telling you about my day.
- I had a hard day too.
Just go heat it up.
Why is it, whenever we're about to fight, you're always undressed?
What's the big deal?
Just heat up the stew.
- Why won't you help out?
- Is that the way you see it?
I make my concessions.
You always take a shower first.
- I don't.
- You do too, and I'm getting tired of it.
- Honey, come on.
- Don't call me honey.
I'm trying to tell you about my day.
Something that happened.
Your days are always the same.
What is that supposed to mean?
Just politics, that's all.
Who said what to whom.
Who's rising, who's falling.
Who's made a good move, a bad move.
Politics!
Somebody has to be interested in hospital politics.
You certainly are not.
I thought you were a surgical resident, not a political one.
I like politics.
They interest me. Just because you're always looking for—
You want me to heat up the dinner, is that it?
I want some respect.
Susan, come on. Don't leave again.
Why can't you share half the responsibility?
I share more than half the responsibility!
- No need to shout.
- Why are you running off?
You think I want this?
Let me tell you something.
I make concessions for this so-called relationship.
- I know it's hard on you politically.
- I also want you to—
Susan, don't go.
You know what the trouble with you is?
All you care about is being chief resident.
You know what your trouble is?
You don't want a relationship.
Look at you.
You run away from it.
This is ridiculous.
You don't want a lover...
...you want a goddamn wife!
Bastard.
Hmm. I have a bleeder here.
- I need more suction.
- Clamp.
He's not di-toxic.
He has advanced ASHD.
I just bought some at 43.
Yeah, I hear they have management problems. I sold at 37.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Mm-hm.
I'm fine. The case went well.
No problem.
Good.
I'm really sorry about last night.
So am I.
- You want to have some lunch?
- I have class.
You don't think this is more important than the class?
Mark, that class is the only time
I get out of this damn hospital.
Can you understand that?
It's important to me!
You're impossible!
Seven, eight, step!
Back. Step.
Out!
One, two, down three, up four and open.
And one and two, three and four.
Stretch.
Walk two, three, four...
...and five and six, seven, eight and back.
- You gonna leave Mark?
- I don't know.
I went home last night.
Again?
He's impossible.
Did you see Dr. Richards?
- And?
- I don't know.
Apparently you can tell by looking at the cervix. It's a different color.
He did the lab tests and he says
I'm definitely 8 to 10 weeks pregnant.
So Dr. Richards is doing a D and C tomorrow.
- For menstrual irregularity.
- Mm-hm.
It's simple, isn't it?
Are you worried?
I know you do this every day but, sure,
I'm worried. Who wouldn't be?
It'll be fine, Nancy.
It's routine procedure.
We're going to the Ice Capades.
- It's real crowded.
- Patient on call?
- Coming right down, Dr. Cowans.
- The instruments are autoclaved.
Let's teach you fellas some anesthesiology.
This is your standard anesthesia.
You've got two main wall lines.
Nitrous oxide on the left and oxygen.
We got a case today that's a D and C.
It's one of Dr. Richard's cases.
Actually, it's a TAB.
That's a therapeutic abortion.
Keep it clean. It's a married patient.
On the cart here, we got two manometers...
...with flow valves here and here to regulate gas.
We got emergency oxygen down here...
...which we checked and that's full.
During surgery, we'll be recording this and the vital signs.
Hey, how is Bess?
I don't know.
In and out.
Yeah.
Boy, she has more rails than anybody I know.
She's seeing a shrink now.
One, two, three, up!
- Anybody we know?
- Mm-mm.
Morning, Nancy. Remember me?
I'm Dr. Cowans.
Dr. Cowans.
That's right, dear, and you'll have a nice long sleep.
Pre-op, she's received a 0.01 of Demerol and 0.4 of atropine...
...so believe me, she's pretty relaxed.
I'll say she's relaxed!
Come on, Mrs. Greenly, on your back.
That's it.
- Gonna meet me for lunch?
- I don't know.
- I'll let you know, okay?
- Okay.
- I'll be in the lounge.
- Yeah.
Henry might be calling, and if he does, you know...
- Okay, no problem.
- Yeah, okay.
- Afternoon, Tom.
- Afternoon, Jim. How's our lady?
- Just about ready.
- I'm still awake.
- But not for long, dear.
- You promise?
I'll induce with sodium Pentothal, give an IV by syringe.
Nance, what I want you to do...
...is start counting from 100 backwards real slow, okay?
Here we go.
- A hundred.
- Ninety-nine...
...ninety-eight...
...ninety-seven...
...ninety-six...
It's quick. Stop the pentothal.
You see, pentothal isn't really an anesthetic.
Any deep pain right now and she'd wake right up.
What we need for anesthesia is gas.
First I'll inject some succinylcholine.
I want you to watch her chest gauge because she'll stop breathing.
She's now experiencing complete muscular paralysis.
She's got three minutes to breathe or she'll suffocate.
So now we intubate.
Taking a laryngoscope like so.
Hold her head in an extended position.
Enter laterally, put up the base of the tongue, up and out...
...visualizing the trachea.
There it is, fellas. Take a look.
You see it?
It's right over there.
Come on, guys!
Take our tube and enter here. So.
In the middle of surgery,
I'll switch over to the telothane.
- Stirrups up?
- Yeah.
How is John?
His fever broke today.
He'll go back to school tomorrow.
Now we can check the pupillary reflexes.
Though she's unconscious, the pupils should react to light...
...and let us know that the old brain is okay.
That's it. Anesthesia's the easiest job in the world until something goes wrong.
It's 99% boredom and 1% scared-shitless panic...
...which we try to avoid.
The patient's yours, Dr. Richards.
If you move in behind me...
...you'll see what I am going to do for this young woman.
Some music, please.
Actually, what I'm going to do is get her out of a hell of a mess.
She's pregnant.
She doesn't want her husband to know.
It's none of my business.
I'm just her surgeon.
I don't run her life.
So in fact, our task is simplified...
...when the uterus is anteverted and anteflexed.
This is a function of the muscular attachments, of which there are five.
You should know them.
They're the broad ligaments, the round and cardinal ligaments...
...and the endopelvic fascia, the uterosacral ligaments.
Again, part of the endopelvic fascia.
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.
She just threw a PVC, and her blood pressure's falling.
I got 90 over 60.
She's fully oxygenated.
Red as a cherry down here.
Uh, how much longer you got?
Just a couple of minutes.
I don't like this.
Her blood pressure is still falling.
Damn!
We should stop. She may be getting too much vagal stimulation.
Jesus Christ.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. Nothing's the matter!
Something's the matter.
She's going to arrest!
I can't find anything!
I get a 100 over 80.
Her pressure's climbing.
Let's finish up. I'd like to get this mother off the table.
Sponge, please.
One-twenty over 80 and climbing.
She's okay.
- These tissues go to pathology.
- Can I start bringing her out?
Yeah, bring her out, Jim.
Okay, Mrs. Greenly, it's time to wake up.
Okay, Nancy?
Mrs. Greenly? Wake up.
Nance, can you give me a cough, please?
Nancy?
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Her pupils are fixed and dilated.
- What?
- The pupils, they're fixed.
Dilated.
Oh, my God!
Pre-op diagnosis, acute gastric ulceration.
Post-op diagnosis, the same.
Surgeon, Dr. Wilson.
Anesthesia, general...
- Where's Schwartz? Cholecystectomy?
- Bed three.
- Mr. Schwartz, I'm Dr. Bellows.
- You don't got to talk so loud.
- How you feel?
- Ehh.
Just "eh"?
You want to get on your side for me, please?
- On your side.
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
What'd they give you in that operating room?
Do you have any pain?
If I had any pain,
I would go see a doctor.
Now you want to breathe for me real easy?
That's it. Slowly.
She was given 4 milligrams narceine...
...to rule out idiosyncratic hyper susceptibility...
- ...to pre-op narcotic...
- Easy!
Two units without effect, a few peripheral fasciculations.
So it's not succinylcholine?
Delayed return of consciousness of cryptogenic origin.
I see no reason not to transfer her to the intensive care unit.
Mr. Schwartz, you're gonna be fine.
That's what you think!
- A grim prognosis, to say the least.
- Rather tragic.
Someone should notify Dr. George.
He'll want to review the anesthetic protocol.
Right, he's been paged.
Looks like another anesthetic reaction.
Page Dr. Bendix, 44432.
Check.
George is not here.
No, Dr. Bendix. Bendix!
Maybe he left the hospital.
Try his office.
Could you page Dr. Wheeler, please?
So you see, Jimmy, your kidneys are sick.
They don't work right.
We need to take out the sick kidneys and put in a new one.
- Today?
- No, not today. We have to wait until...
- ...there's a kidney we can put in.
- Tomorrow?
I don't know when.
But it could be a while.
Dr. Wheeler, call extension 3-5-6.
You can have one of these.
Which color do you like?
Purple.
Take two.
I like purple.
I can see that.
I like red too.
Dr. Wheeler.
Yes.
Um—
Excuse me, I have to go to intensive care now.
A nurse should be right in.
Surgical ICU.
What's her status?
Greenly? Complete squash rot.
She's a total Gomer.
It's brain death.
That patient was transferred to the Jefferson Institute yesterday.
How can this happen?
All this...
Did you do an EEG?
Flat.
Completely flat?
Completely flat.
Did you repeat it?
No, not yet.
What happened during the D and C?
Nothing.
It's an unremarkable case, according to the notes.
Transient PVCs late in the operation.
Nothing else.
She never woke up?
No.
I want to look at her chart.
If it were my friend,
I don't know if I'd be that cool.
The potassium was what?
One-eight? Are you sure?
It must be a mistake.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I know you two were really close.
Susan?
Well...
There doesn't seem to be anything unusual in the chart.
Normal 28-year-old patient in good health for a D and C...
...underwent telothane anesthesia, comes out in irreversible coma.
Hey. Hey, Susan.
It's well-documented that telothane causes liver damage...
...and severe side effects in a small percentage of surgical cases.
- That's just the risk of anesthesia.
- I know you're upset.
I'm not upset.
You think because I'm a woman,
I'm going to be upset. I'm fine, Mark.
I want to understand the variables as they apply to this patient.
- I'm sure you agree that's indicated.
- "This patient"?
Here we have an ordinary, uninteresting case...
...of surgical reaction to telothane anesthesia in a healthy patient.
As far as I can determine, there are no unusual aspects...
...except that the patient was tissue-typed.
Tissue-typed for D and C?
There's got to be some mistake.
Here it is. No name on the slip and no billing number.
The patient is stable.
That's not the first time the lab ran a test on the wrong patient.
Let's go home.
I think you're tired.
I think I'd better check the tissue-typing lab.
Why?
Nancy's problem was not caused by wrong lab tests.
I know.
Honey, you're grabbing at straws.
Let's go have some dinner.
- I'm not hungry.
- We'll check the lab later.
Stop acting as if there's something wrong with me...
...or the way I'm thinking!
I'm checking the lab now.
- They're closed.
- I won't just stand here!
Susan, the lab is closed.
It closed at 6:00.
Is she all right?
Yeah, she just, uh...
She likes to do things her own way.
Who's that?
- Dr. Wheeler.
- Uh, we're closed.
We don't do any determinations...
...after 6, doctor.
I want to look at your requisition book.
Ugh.
What does it mean when there's no name and number on the slip?
There's...
There's always a name or a number, doctor.
For example, Nancy Greenly.
You did tissue-typing...
...but there's no physician name and billing number.
Let me see.
Yes, you see, it's been printed out by computer.
That's hospital policy.
See, uh, a certain number of these tests are randomly ordered by computer...
...as a quality check.
We do the tests here, they're sent out...
...and done again by an outside lab.
The computer ordered this test on Greenly?
Yeah, central computer.
Why don't you just show me?
- I can't.
- Why not?
I'm not supposed to.
It's really important.
Anyway, that information isn't coded.
If it isn't coded,
I can't pull it out.
I mean, who would want it?
Well, let's say, um,
I wanted a list of all the patients...
...who had tissue-typing in the last month.
Same thing. Not coded.
Oh, what do you do?
What good is all this equipment?
I thought you recorded information.
We do, but the truth is, we install these computers to bill patients.
We code patient name and number, medical or surgical...
...admission diagnosis, therapy and discharge diagnosis.
Okay, wait a minute.
Can you give me a list of all surgical patients...
...with discharge diagnoses of coma?
Okay, we have...
...one general category under "coma"...
...and nine subcategories under "brain syndromes."
Good.
I want a list of all surgical patients...
...with general category of coma in the past year.
Phew.
You're sure you want it?
I had no idea.
It's a big hospital.
Are you married or what?
Thank you.
Surgical ICU. That's right.
Where'd you get this?
It's against the law.
It's illegal to tap a data bank.
I don't see why.
I'm a doctor.
- I've got research—
- That's not the point!
Every officer got the lecture.
No access without authorization.
- They can throw you out.
- Never mind that.
- What do you mean "never mind"?
- Mark.
Look at this.
Two hundred and forty names.
Ten are young people admitted for minor procedures.
Breast biopsy, appendectomy.
They all come out in a coma.
Aren't you surprised?
The risk of surgical anesthesia is six per 100,000.
In a hospital this size, 10 patients in a year is not surprising.
So what are you doing?
You missed your rounds.
You didn't scrub in at the gastrectomy.
I had to do something.
Why don't you do your job?
Surgical ICU.
Mr. Murphy is a 35-year-old in good health...
...admitted for a meniscectomy.
He's scheduled for this morning.
Promises, promises.
They keep telling me...
...there's a delay, another half-hour.
Well, the suspense is really killing me.
I thought you doctors liked to operate.
- We'll get to you.
- Oh, I'd hate to be left out.
How did you get your injury?
Playing touch football.
You know, with the guys, horsing around.
Dr. Wheeler, see Dr. Harris.
See Dr. Harris in his office.
The chief of surgery himself.
Playing touch football, huh?
Yeah. So I come in, and all that happens—
Thanks very much, Herb.
We'll get together on it later.
Would you come in?
Excuse me.
Sit down, Sue.
Yes.
Dr. Harris, it's Senator Brooke's office.
He wonders if you can change the meeting to 4.
Yes, 4 is fine. Notify Henry.
Yes, sir.
Sue.
I like to think that Boston Memorial is the best hospital in the city...
...perhaps in the country.
I'm committed to it...
...to the house staff we have here, and to you.
I think you know that.
But we have certain constraints imposed on us.
One is the state law concerning privacy in computer data access.
An unauthorized entry was made last night.
We put the young man on probation.
But he told us he made the illegal entry on your behalf.
That's true, sir.
All the discharge diagnoses of coma over a 12-month period?
- I wanted it because I had an idea—
- Well, forgive me.
But it isn't a question of why you wanted it...
...it's how you got it.
I understand you have personal reasons for being under stress...
...for not acting as carefully as you might.
And I'm sympathetic to the way you must feel about the, uh...
...uh, Greely case.
Greenly. Nancy Greenly.
Greenly. Yes, Nancy Greenly case.
I certainly don't want to lose a good surgical resident.
Well...
I think we can handle this, Sue.
I'll keep the, uh, evidence...
...and we'll forget it ever happened, all right?
But I'd like you to see someone.
I was thinking of Dick Morelind.
Dr. Harris, I'm fine.
I don't need a shrink.
No, no, I know you don't.
But it's important to have on record a talk with Dick Morelind.
- I don't see why.
- Actually...
...it's a precondition to your continuing on here at Memorial.
Okay?
I understand.
I think it's unfair.
Everybody's on my back.
Mark's whining about how I can't make a commitment...
...and I'm cold, and I'm afraid of intimacy.
Then this happens to Nancy...
...and she's my best friend since boarding school.
Everyone jumps on my back, acts like I'm neurotic...
...and I'm not doing my job!
There's concern about breaking the law.
I wanted to do something.
Do you understand?
Do something right away.
I just couldn't sit there and watch Nancy and...
How do you feel about what happened?
Confused...
...that's all.
Just confused.
It's very...
...confusing.
I wanted to understand what happened to her.
Nobody else here seems to care.
- Nobody else cares?
- Listen.
There have been 10 cases of unexplained coma...
...in young, healthy patients in the last year.
- Now, don't you find that surprising?
- No.
You don't.
Susan, this hospital does
30,000 operations a year.
I'm not surprised a few turn out with serious unexplained side effects.
Medicine isn't perfect.
We all accept that.
Don't we?
There's a crisis in her personal life.
- She's involved with a resident.
- I know.
It's led her to overreact to this situation...
...which she has not consciously faced.
She's under stress and a little paranoid.
Mm. Think we'll have any more trouble with her?
I don't think so.
I hope you're right.
I hate to admit it. I think I was really upset about Nancy.
Yeah.
- You on call tonight?
- Mm-hm.
So am I.
Why don't we have a terrific dinner...
...just the two of us in the hospital cafeteria?
- Sounds great!
- About 11?
You got a date.
Maybe afterwards, we can go to our favorite room...
- ...on the eighth floor.
- Mm.
Nobody will be there after midnight.
I think we're looking at cortical anoxia.
- I'll check the Babinski.
- How old is he?
Thirty-five.
When did you administer the additional dosage?
At the onset of cardiac irritability.
The surgeon said he was light.
Surgeons know nothing about anesthesia. What'd you give?
Two cc's push.
There was no reason there'd be a problem.
Just seemed a little light.
Some PVC in runs, transient hypotension...
...but no sign of hypoxia.
Skin color and blood were all red and fully oxygenated.
The pupils are fixed and dilated,
I must presume brain death.
Any relation to your other case?
Completely different. Different staffs, different anesthetic agents.
- He better be trached.
- Do we need a pulmonary consult?
Request the consult, but go ahead with the tracheotomy.
This is a long-term management problem.
- Come on.
- It happened again.
That's Dr. George, chief of anesthesia.
He's got it under control.
Is there a research protocol this case would fit?
He's a good research case.
Excellent teaching material.
It's true, Mr. Murphy presents challenges...
...electrolyte balance IV, caloric maintenance...
...possible pseudomonas infection.
There may be additional risk of staph osteomyelitis.
But I think you'll be agreeably surprised, Dr. George.
We can keep him alive...
...in stable vital signs, a year...
...two years, indefinitely.
You can't just look the other way.
Nobody's looking the other way.
Mark, twice in two days.
It's not normal.
- In certain cases, patients always—
- You told me that.
Two in two days.
You're just sensitized to it.
It just happened to a friend and now you're looking for it.
Twice in two days is just our lousy luck.
Hmm.
- Did Harris take the readout?
- Yes.
All right, then forget it.
The hospital has review boards and committees.
They'll look into it.
Now, you got a job to do, so forget about this.
You're right. You're right.
I'll see you at dinner?
Mm-hm.
Dr. Williams, Dr. Peter Williams, 1174.
This is Dr. Wheeler.
I know about the conference but I'm tied up with a patient now.
Well, I'm afraid I can't make it there in time.
Where am I?
I'm in the emergency ward.
Yes, it is important.
Will you hold on?
Well, that's funny, but all these charts you wanted...
...they're all signed out to Dr. George, the chief of anesthesiology.
Good afternoon, Dr. George.
Good afternoon, staff.
We have a happy lab here.
It's precise.
There's nothing left to chance.
There are no mistakes.
The charts are right here.
There's no mystery.
They're right here.
What is it you wanted?
I'd like to look at them.
For what reason?
I'm interested in unexplained coma following routine surgery.
- You're interested?
- Yes.
Young lady, I'm more than interested.
My anesthesiology staff is more than interested.
We're deeply, intensely concerned.
- I understand your feelings.
- I'm not sure you do.
Perhaps something was missed?
Missed?
Every professor of anesthesia, most of our staff...
...more than 40 experts have gone over these charts.
You think something was missed?
But if anything links them together—
If anything linked them, we'd know it.
Here they are, 10 cases.
There are now 12.
Different ages and sexes.
Different surgeons and anesthetists.
Different methods of induction.
They share nothing in common except they all emerged with unexplained coma.
We're certainly not neglecting that problem.
I didn't say you were.
Do you mind if I have a look?
I'm afraid I do mind.
Thank you for your interest, however misplaced, Dr. Wheeler.
Good afternoon.
Oh, my God, you did—
How could you do that?
Susan...
Dr. George is a past president...
...of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.
He's a member of the AAAS.
He's on the board of the NIH...
...and you tell him he's doing his job wrong.
- I just wanted to see the charts.
- That's not your area.
That's not your responsibility.
You're way off base.
You know who his wife is?
- I don't care.
- Well, you should.
His wife is Amy Cabot.
She's related to Godfrey Lowell.
I don't care about Boston society.
Dr. George's wife...
...is worth somewhere between
50 and 100 million dollars.
When she dies, that money will go somewhere.
So what?
So he has a lot of muscle here.
He's the wrong man to cross.
You afraid to be seen with me?
- Come in.
- Hi, Bill.
- How are you, Mark?
- Good.
Sit down.
You know, Mark...
...I always thought that you'd have this job when I leave next year.
Everybody thinks so.
You're the logical choice.
You're a good surgeon.
You're well-organized.
You run a good service.
Well, thank you very much, Bill.
I'd hate to see anything stand in your way.
You know what I mean.
She has the chiefs of service in an uproar.
- She's under a lot of pressure.
- And so are we.
They're talking about releasing her from her position here at the Mem.
But nobody really wants that kind of...
...adverse publicity, that commotion.
Of course not.
You have influence with her?
I don't know. She's paranoid.
She thinks there's a conspiracy.
George keeping the charts from her did not help.
Does she think, uh, you're involved?
No. No, I don't think so.
Let's hope not, Mark. What happens to Susan may depend on you.
I understand that, Bill.
You know, a good chief resident...
...handles problems like this every day.
I think if you're able to exert some influence over her...
...people would be appreciative.
Well, I'll try.
Good man.
Where's Greenly?
That coma case? She was to be transferred to the Jefferson Institute.
I guess she went there.
Liz, did Greenly go to Jefferson?
No, she arrested at 6 this morning.
- She's down in pathology.
- In pathology?
Yeah, they're probably doing the autopsy now.
Surgical ICU.
There's a wrinkled appearance.
The interior edge of the organ can be bent without tearing...
...as evidence of its structure.
The gross appearance is consistent with acute yellow necrosis of the liver.
Presumably secondary to fatal viral hepatitis.
Do you have a patient named Greenly?
I don't know. Check in there.
I can't keep track of names.
In microscopic section, we may expect evidence...
...of fatty degeneration in necrotic cells...
...with polymorphs and histiocytes around them.
Okay, incise the kidney there.
Looks normal.
- Okay, remove it.
- Greenly?
This is Howard.
Greenly's over there.
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Sue.
What brings you here?
Interested in this case?
- That's right.
- Hell of a puzzler.
Young girl, good health...
...in for a therapeutic AB, comes out comatose.
- Found anything?
- Naturally, we started with the brain.
Grossly, it was normal.
I'm doing a section. Want to see?
Ordinarily, these coma cases get shipped to Jefferson.
- What's Jefferson?
- Jefferson Institute.
A chronic-care facility.
Government thing.
They take care of the vegetables.
Sometimes they die before they get there, like this one.
More work for us.
Huh.
Now we'll get an idea.
We're looking for anything.
Micro-infarcts, staph loci...
...gross hemorrhagic areas, congenital defects...
Nothing. Just like the other cases, we come up cold.
I know it sounds silly...
...but, um, if you wanted to put people in a coma, what would you do?
- On purpose?
- Diethyl para-amino tannadol.
No, it leaves a serum trace.
- If you look for it.
- It also peaks alk phos.
A real giveaway.
Besides, who can get tannadol?
- Use paradine.
- It has a taste.
We'd make great murderers.
Who knows more than a pathologist?
Heh. It keeps my wife in line.
Hell of a lot of crimes slip through our fingers.
But in this case, a coma.
First rule of crime:
Keep it simple.
What's simple?
- Carbon monoxide.
- Boring.
- Carbon monoxide?
- Sure, it's perfect.
Anesthetist uses carbon monoxide instead of oxygen.
It's colorless and makes the blood red so the surgeon doesn't notice.
But the brain dies from lack of oxygen.
The patient doesn't wake up.
- No other effects?
- Sure other effects.
- Cardiac irritability.
- Which this case had.
It'd be better to block the neuro-muscular junction...
...with succinylcholine.
That's a nice murder.
- Who's gonna do it?
- Who'll feed your carbon monoxide?
That's the problem.
Been 12 coma cases here in the last year.
They're always different.
Different case, different anesthetist, different operation.
Hard to imagine it's murder.
Are you sure?
What do you think? There's a conspiracy at the Boston Memorial Hospital...
...involving all the anesthetists?
I've had a rather hysterical call from Dr. George in anesthesiology.
Dr. George is a powerful person here, not only because of his position.
- There are other reasons.
- I gather.
What does that mean?
Just because somebody has a rich wife, he shouldn't be able...
- ...to throw his weight around.
- Oh.
You're looking for truth and justice, huh?
I'm looking for fairness.
In fairness, you've challenged the professional competence...
...of a chief of service at this hospital.
And he didn't take it well.
No reason he should.
- Now he's out for blood.
- I've noticed.
Sue, believe me, I'm on your side...
...for all kinds of reasons.
I don't want to let another chief of service...
...get one of my house officers fired.
Dr. Harris, I just wanted to look at his charts.
Sue, right now, I can protect you...
...because you're good.
And frankly, because you're a woman.
I don't want concessions.
At the moment, you'd better take any you can get.
You know what happened to Greenly?
Yes.
What happened?
She died.
How do you feel about that?
How do I feel?
I feel...
She was my best friend.
She understood me.
It's not fair.
None of this is fair.
Here.
Nobody understands.
- No one.
- I know, I know.
Yes.
Dr. Harris, the secretary of HEW is on the phone from Washington.
Call back.
Too many of us shut ourselves off from our feelings.
We don't explore them.
We don't understand them.
We don't understand ourselves.
It's the toughest thing about our profession.
- Dr. Harris—
- I'll take care of the politics.
You just look out for yourself.
Take the weekend off, Sue.
Go walk on the beach.
Get away from the hospital.
- I'm so embarrassed by this.
- No.
Don't be. Don't be.
Our emotions are what make us human.
Come on.
Come and see me next week, all right?
- Right.
- Good.
- Have a good weekend.
- Thank you, sir.
Women!
Christ!
God!
Just say you don't believe me.
A man fixed your car so it wouldn't start...
...then followed you into the MTA station.
Well, it's true.
They're gonna wave him in.
Your car is always breaking down.
I just think you're tired.
- I'm not tired.
- Why don't we go away for the weekend?
Go up the coast, have some fun and just forget the hospital.
Mark...
There are 12 coma cases.
Nobody thinks they're linked, but I've seen charts for two of them:
Nancy, and now this new guy, Murphy.
And?
And both occurred in O.R. 8.
O.R. 8?
What if...?
What if carbon monoxide were being pumped in O.R. 8?
What if that were true?
- Get your coat on.
- Why?
We're going to take a look.
Right now. O.R. 8.
Well?
Well...
Looks okay.
- How many operations you done in here?
- A lot.
- You ever had any problems?
- No.
Well, I already checked.
The day Nancy had her problem, there were five other operations.
Four before and one after.
The day Sean Murphy had his, there were six others.
Two before...
...and four after.
They were all normal.
Let's get out of here.
This is what you call really working for it.
No fair.
Fair.
I thought we were taking the weekend off?
Come on. Just a quick look.
Please?
For me?
I don't know.
There doesn't seem to be anybody around.
- You want to go in?
- Not really, no.
I do.
Can I help you?
I'm Dr. Wheeler.
- You're early, aren't you, doctor?
- Early?
You're supposed to come on Tuesday, day after tomorrow...
...when the tour is scheduled.
- The tour?
- Yes, it's every Tuesday at 11.
The regular tour for physicians.
Could I, uh, see it now?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I just thought as long as I'm here...
We're simply not set up for it.
May I speak with the senior physician in charge?
There is no physician in charge.
Well, then, your supervisor.
I have no supervisor.
- Who runs the staff?
- There is no staff.
You're here alone?
Of course not. There are technicians, security people...
I'm sure when you've taken the tour
Tuesday, it will all be clear to you.
What did you say your name was?
Dr. Wheeler. Susan Wheeler.
We look forward to seeing you at 11 on Tuesday. Goodbye.
I heard what you said to Dr. George...
...in the lab.
I heard what you said to him.
You're right.
Right about what?
I've seen how they do it.
I know how it works.
- How what works?
- Susan. Uh...
Do you want to, uh, scrub in on an aortic valve replacement?
Harvey's doing one in room 16 in 10 minutes.
- Sure.
- Great!
Tom was going to scrub in, but, uh, his case is running late.
- I checked them out.
- Mm-hm.
You come down to maintenance tonight. I'll show it to you.
Hello, Sue.
Good morning, sir.
- Did you have a good weekend?
- Yes, I did. Thank you.
Evening.
Good evening.
You just gonna stare at me?
No.
What'd you do that for?
They said make it look like an accident.
- What's happening?
- Emergency generator will kick in.
Kelly?
Kelly?
What do you got now?
Nothing.
Try the connector cable.
I think that does it for me.
You got anything else?
No, I don't need anything else.
- If we need you again—
- You can reach me at the hospital.
Must be a short in the junction box...
...or the step-down panel.
It should read 14 point something.
Okay, now we should have 11.9.
Eleven-nine.
And now there's—
Fourteen-three.
Good. Nothing's shorted so far.
We got lucky.
Poor Kelly.
Poor Kelly? Heh.
He got sloppy.
You know what it is?
That drinking at lunch.
I said, "Stop drinking.
You'll get into trouble."
Two and two's the count.
Can't get much more than that.
- What did you leave in here?
- Just some charts.
I'll call Dr. George and tell him I let you in.
It's all right.
I have to call him anyway.
Well, okay.
- Boston ahead by one.
- That's great.
I've got 20 bucks on this game.
What is it?
Hospital security, doctor.
- What's the score?
- Just a routine check, doctor.
Easy, kids.
Jerry?
- What's going on?
- Jerry, I'm so happy to see you.
That's the nicest thing anybody's said to me all day.
Is something wrong?
You see, there's this guy.
- He said he was hospital security.
- Yeah.
Well, I happen to know that he—
It's a high fly ball and...
...he's out!
- You were saying?
- I guess I have an overactive imagination.
Heh. Be like me. Everybody says
I have no imagination at all.
I'm going over to the medical school library.
I'll go with you.
The tubular filtration gradient may be more than 500 milliequivalents.
That means there's an active transport with phosphorylated ATP.
But if you trace radioisotopes, densities don't look right.
It's a breakthrough in understanding the kidney.
Remember that yellow cadaver skin under your fingernails?
Nobody could eat lunch.
It seems like a long time ago.
Back in the days when we couldn't eat lunch.
Wouldn't you know?
Dr. Marcus.
Yes.
Well, if he's complaining of pain.
Try another five cc's I.M.
I see.
Well, then, uh, MS 10 milligrams.
Yes, morphine sulphate.
He's not in respiratory difficulty.
You can put him on respiratory arrest with morphine.
Particularly if he's on wall O-2.
You'll have to check and see what he's on.
Air is fine, but oxygen...
If he's on wall oxygen, tell me how many liters of flow.
Six liters!
You can't put him on MS.
You'll have to stay with Talwin.
Give him five cc's of water.
Say it's morphine.
He won't know.
He's a pain in the ass anyway.
Aah! Unh!
Agh!
Mark, it's so awful!
It's so terrible.
Take it easy.
Honey, slow down.
He was trying to kill me.
And I had to keep going.
- And all the bodies. It's horrible!
- Easy. Easy, honey.
Take it easy. Slow down.
Mark, it's all happening.
It's really happening.
Somebody's putting people into comas.
They're murdering them.
- I know, I know.
- No, no, really.
Kelly's dead. I was down there.
I found the gas line.
It starts in the basement and it goes up the main tunnel...
...then plugs into the oxygen line in the ceiling that goes to O.R. 8.
- Honey, slow down.
- They're killing people...
...with carbon monoxide in O.R. 8.
- They have a radio to turn the valve.
- I believe you. I do, I believe you.
All the cases happened in O.R. 8.
And they all went to the Jefferson Institute.
And this guy, he chased me all over.
And there were so many bodies.
It's all right. It's okay.
And this is real. Call the police.
We have to do something!
This is real, Mark.
- Shh, shh.
- I can prove it.
Sure, you can. You can.
- Just lie down.
- This is real.
I know you can.
Now one thing at a time.
- I want to give you a Valium and—
- No.
Okay.
How about a cup of tea to settle you down?
- A cup of hot tea?
- Okay.
Then we're gonna talk after you settle down.
- Okay.
- All right.
So you just rest right here. Okay?
You just stay right here on the bed?
Thattagirl. That's it. You just relax.
- I can't—
- That's it. Just relax. Close your eyes.
That's it. Okay, thattagirl.
- Now, I'll get you a cup of tea.
- You're so great, Mark.
Stay here, honey. Just stay right here.
That's a hell of a story, Susan.
You really had a lot of people worried.
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay now.
She came back. Yeah.
No, she's here now.
Of course. No, I can manage that.
I'll keep her here.
Look, I'd better go.
Susan, you want some honey with your tea?
Susan?
Su—?
Susan!
Memorial Hospital residents' exchange.
This is Dr. Wheeler.
Are there any messages for me?
Oh, yes, doctor.
Quite a few. Just a minute, please.
I'm sorry.
I'll have to call you back.
What number can you be reached at?
Dr. Wheeler, are you there?
What number can we reach you at?
We are dealing in an area of uncertainty.
An area where there are no rules, contradictory laws...
...and no clear social consensus as to what should be done.
And the cost of care for the chronic patient has become prohibitive.
This is particularly the case with the long-term comatose patient.
The Jefferson Institute is a government— sponsored experimental facility...
...designed to provide quality life support to the comatose patient.
I wish to emphasize...
...no moral or ethical position is being taken here.
We do not participate in the debate over whether these patients...
...are alive or dead...
...or whether their care should be continued or terminated.
Society will decide if there will be more of these facilities or not.
In the meantime, we merely provide care as inexpensively as possible.
Now, if you will please come this way...
This is our visiting room...
...where relatives can see patients who are stored here.
You see, it all looks quite normal.
We've found it is inadvisable...
...for relatives to know the actual circumstances of patient care.
It's too much of a shock.
So we bring the patient here.
After the visit, we return them to the main care facility.
If you will put on your glasses, we'll go there now.
This is our main care facility.
Temperature here is
94.7 degrees Fahrenheit...
...humidity 82 percent.
This stability reduces patient heat loss...
...and caloric requirements.
There's a low-level ultraviolet bacteriostatic flux...
...and to prevent bedsores...
...patients are suspended by wires through long bones.
- How do you get to them up there?
- There's no need for contact.
Every one of our patients is individually monitored by the computer.
Indwelling telemetry records weight, fluid balance...
...blood pressure, blood gases, temperature, metabolic balance.
Our computer makes an immediate adjustment for any change in condition.
For example...
...we simulate hypotension by direct compression of the telemetry unit.
The computer will sense this and make an immediate adjustment.
Well, almost immediate.
Sometimes there's a—
There we are.
Sometimes there is a short delay, but as you can see...
...the computer put the patient in the Trendelenburg position...
...and administered a vasoconstrictor.
We have very few crises here.
With the assistance of technology...
...these patients are maintained beautifully.
Without it, they would have died long ago.
But the law says they must be maintained, and this is one solution.
How large is your staff?
One nurse, a physician on call...
...two computer technicians and a small security staff. That's all.
And the rest of the building?
It's of no interest. Just mechanical and technical facilities.
- What's the cost?
- For each patient, about $60 a day.
But we can store 1,000 patients and then the cost will go down.
We expect to maintain patients for about $5 a day.
Less than it costs to hire a baby-sitter for a few hours.
If there are no further questions...
...this concludes our tour of the Jefferson Institute.
Before you go, we have some literature we'd like you to take.
It explains some of the background and details of our work here.
We hope the tour has been informative.
And if you have any questions about the Jefferson Institute...
...don't hesitate to call.
It shouldn't be about money.
Maybe your patients don't complain about their bills.
Thank you for your interest.
Goodbye.
Do you know what I wanted?
I wanted corned beef on rye...
...or else a roast beef with Russian.
And what do you bring me?
Ham and cheese.
Well, that's all they had.
You mean to tell me they didn't have any corned beef? No corned beef?
That's what the man said.
No corned beef. The guy must have been putting you on.
George says we're having an electrical inspection tomorrow morning.
Are we set for that?
Norman!
Yes, we should be.
- Do you want the bidding program now?
- In a moment.
Did you see the game last night?
Two out, Bumbry's up.
He hits a ball to left field.
White misses it and goes for a triple.
Lungs, 1100 grams.
Kidneys, 780, 620.
Eighty and six-twenty.
What about the heart?
- I wrote it down someplace.
- What's the temperature?
Right now, 12 degrees centigrade...
...and all the rest at 14.
Bottom of the ninth.
- Hey.
- What?
- Where's that heart going?
- Um...
San Francisco.
I think they're getting
$75,000 for it.
- Is that all?
- It was a bad match on tissue-typing.
Only two out of four.
But it's a rush order.
The kidney's a four-tissue match and in perfect condition.
They'll get 200 grand for that.
It's going to Texas.
A millionaire's son.
Good old George has the connections.
So far, George is doing fine.
What about the other kidney?
They're putting it up for bids.
They'll get 100 for it.
We have a left kidney, two hours old, ready to ship.
It's a 4367. A 31-year-old male.
The bidding now stands at forty-two five.
Thank you.
Forty-five.
Hello? It's at 45.
Well, it could be in Zurich in...
The fastest routing is New York-Rome.
It'll arrive local time...
...1300 hours, which means elapsed time is 23 hours.
Twenty-three hours elapsed time, which would make it 1 p.m. your time.
That's the best we can do.
Thank you.
Hello.
What's that?
Look at monitor four.
All units!
There is an unauthorized woman in the building.
- Contain this person maintaining...
- Let's take her alive.
Don't shoot.
Visiting room, clear. Over.
Second floor lobby, clear.
Has anyone checked the main care facility? Over.
We have no reports from that sector.
Now on the second floor corridor.
System's all clear. Repeat.
Don't you have a key to this place?
No intruders on sub-basement one.
Repeat: No intruders on sub-basement one.
Unit one, she's out on the ledge.
It's too far for her to jump.
I don't see her.
She's out there.
She won't get far. We got her now.
Have the dogs start on the north side and circle the building.
I want security at all exits.
Notify them by radio.
Search the labs and the roof.
I've had enough of this inefficiency.
Perimeter dog team, come in.
Repeat. Come in!
Main control, any readings from outside? Where are the dogs?
I don't know where the hell she is.
She's got to be around here somewhere.
There, there.
It's going to be all right.
First floor lobby, check in.
First floor lobby, please respond.
No, she's not here.
Of course I've been notified.
I'm keeping an eye out for her.
If she comes here, we'll get her.
There's no way she can escape.
Let's get this loaded quick.
I got to make it in time for the Dallas flight.
And we got rush-hour traffic.
Even with the siren,
I gotta get through the tunnel.
Life gets tougher all the time.
I see you got the dogs out.
- We got a little security problem.
- We all got problems.
World's full of problems.
Take it away!
Dr. Rogers, 2204.
Dr. Earl Rogers, 2204.
Do me a favor, will you?
Don't say anything to upset her.
I wouldn't say anything.
She's an old woman. She's sick.
- She may die.
- Did the doctor say that?
- I don't know.
- You don't know what the doctor said?
- I'll believe what the doctor says.
- Just don't upset her.
This could be it.
This could be the end.
It's incredible.
Well, I could use a drink.
How about you? Scotch?
Whatever you're having.
I like a woman who drinks Scotch.
You've done a remarkable thing, Sue.
Your dedication...
...your concern...
...your pursuit of this problem.
It's all extremely impressive.
And I'm very grateful.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
In fact, I'm more than grateful.
I'm deeply in your debt.
The question is, how do we handle this?
You arrest Dr. George.
Yes.
Sorry, Dr. Harris.
It's Landis in Washington.
Put him on.
Excuse me.
Hello, Tom. How are you?
Fine, fine, just fine.
Sure, I'd be delighted to testify.
You know how strongly I feel about the matter.
But have you consulted the president?
Uh-huh.
I see.
This won't take long.
Uh-huh.
Good, good.
Good. Thanks for calling, Tom. Bye.
You've put me in a difficult position, Sue.
It seems you know everything.
You're George.
I wonder if you can understand...
...if you can take the long view...
...the view of a person in my position.
You did it?
No decision is easy, Sue.
It only looks that way when you're young.
When you're older...
...everything is complicated.
There is no black and white.
Only gray.
But our society faces momentous decisions.
Decisions about the right to die...
...about abortion, about terminal illness...
...prolonged coma, transplantation.
Decisions about life and death.
But society isn't deciding.
Congress isn't deciding.
The courts aren't deciding.
Religion isn't deciding. Why?
Because society is leaving it up to us, the experts.
The doctors.
You're crazy.
Americans spend $125 billion a year on health.
More than defense.
Because Americans believe in medical care.
These great hospital complexes are the cathedrals of our age.
Billions of dollars, thousands of beds...
...a whole nation of sick people turning to us for help.
You...
You ought to see somebody.
- They're children, Sue.
- Ha-ha-ha.
They trust us.
We can't tell them everything.
Our job is to make things easier for them. I'm sure you agree.
You're killing people.
We must always take the long view...
...not of the individual, but of society as a whole...
...because medicine is now a great social force.
The individual is too small.
That's the drug.
It produces abdominal spasm and peritoneal symptoms.
It must be very painful.
It's too bad.
But look at it from the practical standpoint.
Somebody has to make these decisions.
We can't wait around forever.
If society won't decide, we'll decide.
We'll make the hard decisions.
This is Dr. Harris.
Schedule an emergency appendectomy in O.R. 8.
It's a member of the house staff,
Dr. Wheeler.
I've examined her.
She requires immediate surgery.
Okay, honey, now just sit up.
Come on, that's it. That's good.
Yes. Here we go.
It's...
...the drug.
Yes, yes, it's gonna be just fine.
Doctors make the worst patients.
They know too much, I guess.
Dr. Edwards, 1011.
Dr. Edwards, 1011.
Susan. Susan.
Why'd you run away?
I was just talking to your mother.
She was worried about you.
- Mark. Mark.
- Everybody's been worried about you.
Mark.
Honey, I love you.
You're gonna be just fine.
No, Mark, listen.
You have to stop this.
I'm fine. I am.
- But your appendix is not fine.
- No, Mark.
You've got plus-four peritonitis, guarding and spasm, honey.
- No.
- Susan, you do.
No, I don't.
There's no question about it.
Mark. Check my white count and sed. rate. It's normal.
Please.
Huh.
- The tests aren't here.
- Unh.
But with these physical signs, it has to be appendicitis.
Please!
It's better to be safe and have the operation.
- Unh.
- Besides, you're in the best of hands.
Dr. Harris himself will do the procedure, huh? How about that?
The chief of surgery is taking your case.
I don't want him.
- Well, how's our patient doing?
- Fine. Just slightly delirious.
That's normal with appendicitis.
Besides, we all know doctors make the worst patients.
You gonna scrub in?
Dr. Harris, we have O.R. 7 ready for your case.
I wanted O.R. 8.
It isn't ready yet.
- I specifically requested O.R. 8.
- It'll take a couple of minutes.
Well, hurry it up. Our patient can't wait all night, can she?
You scrubbing in?
Uh, excuse me.
Let me just answer this page, sir.
Yeah, this is Dr. Bellows.
Yes, Dr. Bellows.
It's that serious, huh?
Is what that serious?
All right, I'll be right there.
Dr. Bellows?
We're ready in O.R. 8, Dr. Harris.
We'll start at once.
Bellows?
Patient on surgical two's got convulsions.
- Join me as soon as you can.
- Yes, sir.
You can take her in.
You certainly are lucky with Dr. Harris doing the operation.
Couldn't ask for a better man, huh?
- I want—
- Now, now, just lie back.
You're going to have a nice sleep.
Just relax.
Easy, we'll take good care of you.
I found the oxygen line.
It starts in the basement...
...and it goes up the main tunnel...
...and then it plugs in the ceiling that goes to O.R. 8.
Do we have enough sponges?
We better order some more
4-0 Chromex. We're almost out.
We have to do this one right.
House officers deserve the very best of care in their own hospital.
I'm giving you Pentothal.
Take some good, deep breaths, dear.
- In and out.
- Unh.
The patient's film, Dr. Harris.
They look normal, don't they?
Pity acute appendicitis doesn't show up more clearly in the x-rays.
She has an inny.
A what?
An inny. The bellybutton.
Some are innies, some are outties.
Hers is an inny.
Let me know when she's fully under.
She's ready for you.
Scalpel, please.
- What's that?
- It's a PVC.
There's another one.
Too light?
I don't think so, sir.
Maybe you'd better deepen anesthesia.
Blood pressure's dropping.
I don't understand.
- Want me to stop?
- No.
It'll be all right, sir.
- I'll be happy to stop a moment.
- It's okay, Dr. Harris.
You recommend I go on?
Son of a...
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
Here it is.
Hmm.
Looks normal.
Never know it from her symptoms.
It's nice to see the chief get caught sometimes.
Happens to the best of us.
Okay.
All right.
- You can bring her out now.
- Right, sir.
- Uh-oh, Dr. Harris.
- Yes?
She's not coming around.
Just give her a minute.
I'm sure she'll be just fine.
I don't know, sir.
She's okay, sir.
She's just fine, Dr. Harris.
Nice case, Dr. Harris.
Mark. Mark.
- Don't let him do the operation.
- I know, baby.
I know.
We're waiting for you, Dr. Harris.
FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON
Let's play a little parlor game, shall we?
Ah, the rope.
The rope is very important.
We're going to sacrifice one of the girls of the tribe... to the great god Kraal.
Our most beautiful virgin, naturally.
Kraal doesn't give a damn about these details!
- Come now. Kraal doesn't like to wait.
- Are you going to kill me?
- Yes! But only after much torture.
- Are you serious, George?
Kraal and I have never disappointed a young virgin.
Oh, so that's what Kraal is!
Jacques.
Now serve our guests.
- George, what's that razor for?
- You'll see.
George, stop it.
You're hurting me, George!
I haven't even started yet.
And your husband's here.
What are you worried about?
You know we all love you.
We chose you out of the whole tribe.
But I'm afraid, George, really.
Please, untie me.
Sorry, it's too late.
- Great Kraal, do you want this virgin?
- George, untie me!
Now I deliver this maiden's lifeblood to your fire!
All right, friends, do with her as you will.
Leniency will not be tolerated!
What's happened?
Jack, where are you?
Silence!
Behold the purifying fame... which draws nigh, sinner!
Prepare yourself.
Nobody move!
Who did it?
Who had that knife?
Doesn't any one remember?
I had it, but someone grabbed it from me when the lights went out.
- And you don't know who it was?
- I know perfectly well.
Well, who?
I'm not talking, George.
Let the murderer talk.
- They're going away.
- Who?
Over there. Don't you see?
The sailors and the yacht.
They can go to hell.
I don't care.
It's just that I'll be left alone to take care of everyone.
Including me, darling.
What a bunch of complainers.
For people like them a houseboy is like a second mother.
Why not leave them then?
We'll hire you, Jacques.
Why the mysterious meeting?
Business matters.
How about being a little more affectionate, "mommy"?
Come on, hold me.
Does anybody here understand my husband?
For instance, why did he send the yacht away?
I'm pretty sure it wasn't to buy food.
I mean, we are on an island.
That's right. One of us could get sick or something.
Not much chance of that.
No one gets sick in this house.
George's orders.
George's orders!
Jill, I have a premonition about this island.
I'm rarely wrong about these things.
Trudy, what are we going to do about poor little Peggy?
She doesn't like the island.
We'll have to get a different one.
I'm talking about this mysterious business meeting.
Nice. When are you going to have a show?
I had one about a month ago.
George set it up for me.
- Why did you marry such a beast?
- All men are beasts.
But George turns into a real charmer when he starts signing checks.
So you married for money.
Nine million dollars. I would have married my own grandfather for that.
I'm done.
When are they coming down?
Hi, Isabel.
Do you like wildfowers?
There are lots of them around.
Thanks.
- Won't you help out in the kitchen?
- Me, in the kitchen? Never!
Isabel, aren't you afraid, wandering all over the island by yourself?
No. Anyway, I think my father and mother will be back soon.
Maybe even tomorrow.
Her operation was a while ago.
Enough of this, Professor.
We want to buy.
You can name your own price.
We'll give you a million dollars down here and now.
Listen, you can have a million down from each one of us, if you like.
I've told you before:
I don't give a damn about the money.
I came here to rest.
Each one of us has in his pocket a check for a million dollars.
- Swiss bank, made out to cash.
- A down payment.
And you can cash them anytime you like.
Three million dollars.
I'm just not interested in money.
Please, listen for once.
We want to buy your formula.
What about all your years of research?
Now you don't want to sell?
I'm not sure yet.
I need to give it some more thought.
Please, try to understand.
My best friend was killed because of these experiments.
I know, but that has nothing to do with your formula.
- What about my conscience?
- Your conscience? That's a laugh!
You want your name in the history books.
It'll be there... the discovery's yours.
Maybe you want me to throw in my wife too?
That's enough!
I want to get off this island.
Come on, Professor.
Why did you send the yacht away?
It looks stormy, and we haven't got a harbor for that big a boat.
Never mind. Jacques can take me over tomorrow on the launch.
And my wife said this was going to be a vacation!
Help me, Trudy.
I'll bet he's never said no to you.
You're wrong. He doesn't change his mind unless he wants too.
He's one of a kind.
- I married him for it.
- I know.
He's also a great scientist... but I'm not about to give anything up.
I want that formula... at any price.
Can't you accept the fact that a scientist... may want to work for humanity and not for money?
We crass industrialists work for humanity too.
We sell things.
We just don't get sentimental over it.
He doesn't sell, he gives.
There's an important convention in Geneva next Monday.
He's going to announce it there.
Look, you'd better not do anything rash... because the three of us don't want to give up anything, like I said.
Is that a threat?
- What is it?
- I came to get Trudy.
- We're supposed to go for a walk.
- You don't need me, do you, darling?
No, go ahead.
All right.
I won't be gone long.
I just wanted to warn you.
I had no idea it bothered you so much, Trudy.
I never would have married if I'd known.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.
And anyway, you could always divorce him.
What for?
What do you care about him?
I can't believe you married someone... who could take you away from me...
No, Trudy, he'll never take me away from you, I swear.
Well, I see Marie is paying the houseboy another visit.
- Where? I can't see her.
- There, on the launch.
Jacques, can you hear me?
Darling.
Don't you feel well?
- So what was I telling you?
- That I'm a dirty whore.
That's why I'm taking a shower.
At least now I'll be a clean whore.
Then you asked how I could sleep with the houseboy.
After all, one does have to do something for the working classes, no?
Anyway, you were saying that your wife is very bad.
I'm listening, if you want to go on.
You see,
I don't care that he's a houseboy.
It all boils down to a matter of good taste.
WhyJacques, when there are a lot of better choices around?
- I'm not the jealous type.
- I don't know what the hell you mean!
You threw yourself away on a houseboy.
Don't be ridiculous.
It was just a pastime.
- If you want to know what I think...
- Dear wife, I don't ask you to think... only to do something.
Just what the hell do you want me to do?
A wife should help her husband.
In this case, how?
What you did with the houseboy... could be of help in convincing the professor.
And now tell me who's the dirty whore, you bastard!
If that's your idea of what I should do to help you... you can count on it.
I'll be glad to help you out with all my pals, okay?
That's fine, darling.
Start with George.
Come up to the house.
It's no use staying here.
Who could have done it?
No, we mustn't touch him until the police get here.
Yes, I know.
If we don't do something about him, the crabs will take care of it for us.
The police will have a nice white skeleton to look at.
PoorJacques!
You killed him, didn't you?
I can't figure out whether you're dangerous or just stupid.
You forget, my dear husband:
I like my men alive!
Hello! Hello!
Save your breath,
Professor Farrell.
Looks like it's out of order.
What's all the yelling about?
George, did you throw this damn thing out of whack?
It was working before.
Hello. Hello!
Didn't you want anybody to call the police?
They don't worry me at all.
That's right. You're the big fish that nobody can touch.
I'm getting out of here.
I'm taking the motorboat.
Come back here!
Professor, where do you think you're going?
You can't go!
- It's not there.
- What?
You sent it away, like you did with the yacht.
No, I didn't.
Help me look for it.
Where could it be?
We're the first ones to put a houseboy in deep freeze.
Jill, darling, stop it, please!
You've got to forget it.
It's all over.
Stop it!
You stop it! Go away!
Just leave me alone.
Jill, you can't go on like this.
Come on, darling, try to stop.
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.
Houseboys come and go, but there's always a bottle.
Let me have that.
Death makes me thirsty.
Jill, honey, stop it!
Death makes you feel dirty.
Come on, darling.
You can't go on like this.
I'm going out for a breath of air.
- Not a bad idea.
- A shower for me.
Come on, that's enough now, please.
You know, you're crying just like a bad-tempered child.
- Come on, honey.
- That's enough. Stop it!
I don't know what you're up to, George.
I just know you wouldn't stop at anything!
You fool! Shut up!
See what you can do with her, Trudy.
You've got a way with women.
I swear, Trudy, he'll pay for this!
Jill, darling, listen to me.
Don't you know a woman keeps quiet about these things?
She may even kill a man, but she keeps quiet about it.
Of course, darling, that's what we'll do.
We'll leave this place, whenever you want.
Just a minute.
Come in.
I was thinking.
So far we've done nothing but talk.
Here is one million dollars.
If you decide to deal just with me, you'll get five more... and no one will know about it.
You're wasting your time.
I'm not selling my formula.
No need to decide now.
Think about it.
If you want to cash it, just remember 2-2-3-3-3.
The bank account number.
- Who gave you this?
- Nick.
- Does that mean you're selling?
- No. I'll give it back to him.
Nick, take this back.
I don't want it.
- Give it some thought.
- I'd rather not.
You never know what might happen.
I'm leaving it on the bed.
Isabel!
What's this about?
Give me that shawl. It's mine.
Sure I'll give it to you.
Wait! Where are you going?
Come here.
- No, please go. Leave me alone.
- Didn't you say it was yours?
Yes.
Take it. Don't be afraid.
All right, now, I want to know what this is all about!
Professor, what are you doing here?
I came to tell you
I left the check in your room.
Here.
You scientists are all alike.
You refuse to sell a formula that would make you a fortune... and you leave a million dollars lying around as if it were nothing.
Well, it's time to wake up.
A million dollars? Wow!
What's your formula?
An atomic bomb?
No, just a new type of industrial resin.
You're so different from the others.
- What others?
- Everybody.
Have you thought about how many things you could buy with a million dollars?
A lot of things.
- What's your name?
- Isabel.
But a million dollars is not all that much, really.
For instance, Professor... once you've bought a yacht, a couple of Rolls-Royces and a nice villa... your million is gone.
What happens after that,
Professor?
Another formula.
If it isn't Trudy, the beautiful icicle.
- Want some?
- No.
Well, I do.
I want all of it, every drop.
That's better.
Now let's try something else.
Know something, Trudy?
This is the best formula your husband has come up with yet.
You are a beautiful woman, full of passion.
Trudy, a man like me... and a woman like you.
My hand on your skin.
Do you feel it, Trudy?
I feel I've been looking for you forever, as though we were...
You don't understand.
You're crazy.
There's been a murder here, and you expect me to stay calm.
We can't just sit around and make small talk.
Listen, I don't care about the six million dollars...
Nick promised to give me today.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
The good professor accepted a check from me... for one million dollars, as it happens.
That wasn't what we agreed.
I know, but we didn't expect to play fair, now, did we?
You know damn well.
I left that check in your room, Nick.
Funny, I didn't find it there.
The last thing I expected... a visit from you.
- Where's the check?
- The check?
I left it here.
On top of your brassiere.
A check in my brassiere... how sweet.
I hope you find it.
Take a look. You're sure to lay your hands on something nice.
Jack, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry, but I just can't help it.
You're sure there's no way to call the police?
That's what they all say.
We have nothing to hide from anyone.
But I keep seeing Jacques dead.
I just know something's going to happen.
Try to guess what it is.
Only if you're willing, of course.
It's going to revolutionize the world market!
I swear, if I can't get my hands on that formula legally...
The ring!
Too bad, Nick.
You want to play dirty, don't you?
Now, if you were to go along with me... and there's still time... it would be better.
For you, of course.
Who are you trying to frighten?
We're exactly alike, the two of us.
We're two rotten bastards cast from the same mold, George.
Never forget it, all right?
- Trudy, I didn't see you and...
- And?
And I got a bit frightened.
You know I'm good about keeping appointments.
You're so silly.
Everything seems to frighten you.
I just can't stop thinking there's a murderer among us.
Everyone seems to be waiting for something that's not happening.
But whoever killed Jacques might kill someone else.
Trudy, who could it have been?
Don't think about it anymore, Jill.
Let's try to forget the whole thing, at least for a while, all right?
All right. Forgive me.
I want to show you a beautiful spot.
You'll see.
A gunshot!
The other side of that rock!
Hurry!
Fritz!
- He's dead, Jill.
- Did you hear that? Up there!
Come on.
We've got to warn the others!
Nick! George!
Come here!
Someone's killed the professor!
- They shot him!
- Hurry!
Someone dragged him into the water. Why?
So that his body wouldn't be found.
By the way, there's no chance you made a mistake, is there?
Of course not!
I saw him. He was dead.
And so did Jill. I believe you.
But it's strange.
Whoever pulled him out there didn't cover the tracks.
So? What does that mean?
It means that whoever did it was in one hell of a hurry.
Please, let's get back to the house.
I'm afraid out here.
He was in a hurry.
What for?
To get back to the house in time to be called out to look at the corpse.
You mean one of us?
There's not the slightest doubt.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
- Just for you to confess.
- What?
We think you know where the formula's hidden.
But I don't.
He never told me anything.
Not even where he hid my check?
It was for a million dollars!
When I went out, my husband was sleeping... but one of you woke him up and made him go out.
That's the person we should be looking for.
Why did you go out in the first place?
- Why did you meetJill?
- That is none of your business!
On, no? I left a million dollars here on this table... and I want it back!
Anyone else want to try?
I'm ready.
Have you had breakfast yet?
What's the water like?
Any breakers?
I should take you out and drown you.
That would teach you to answer me.
Right, Peg?
Looks like we're all going to wind up subzero.
- Am I right?
- You asking me?
Why did it have to be her?
Why did you want me to bring her?
What harm did she ever do to you?
Start talking or I'll kill you!
Only murderers kill.
Jack, where are you?
Answer!
Where are you?
Where the hell are you hiding?
Jack, answer!
Where are you?
Isabel, have you seen
Jack anywhere?
- Would you like something to drink?
- Maybe later.
Look!
Oh, God! Not him too!
Where were you?
- Here he is, George.
- We looked for you everywhere.
Where's Marie?
This time, seltzer water won't turn the trick.
What's the matter with you, if I may ask?
I can't stay here any longer.
You must let me leave.
- I'm afraid of all of you.
- Even me?
I don't feel
I ever knew you, George.
I know there's a way of getting off this island, isn't there, George?
But you didn't want anybody to go.
You kept us all here.
Why, George? Do you realize the professor would still be alive?
And Peggy and Jacques.
And poor little Marie.
Well, I didn't kill them, you know!
Maybe it was you after all!
What? Stop it.
You can think what you like.
I can't go on!
Nick, may I ask what you're doing?
Nothing.
Just looking for that check.
And you expect to find it in my desk?
What are you doing?
Why did you turn off the record player?
What the hell are you up to?
I'd like at least my voice to stay around.
My name's Trudy Farrell.
One of these three men murdered my husband.
The first one is George Stark, the man who invited us all here.
Number two is Jack Davidson... a business associate of the aforementioned George Stark.
The third man's name is
Nick Chaney.
I suppose he, too, does business with George.
One of these three men...
We're all a little upset.
- Why don't we try to get some sleep?
- No.
Why not, George?
You got another one of your clever ideas? What is it?
We sleep here, all four of us.
- You think so, do you?
- Sounds risky to me, George.
Knight... bishop... queen.
Checkmate.
- But not a bad plan.
- Very clever.
Don't you agree?
The murderer will kill us all at once!
Well, I'm not playing.
He won't find me.
Let him go, George.
Let him risk his life if he wants to.
- Nick's gone out.
- Trudy, are you starting that again?
The other two are still here with me.
It's an obsession.
Each person can watch over the others.
If the murderer is among us and makes a wrong move...
He hasn't so far! we'll find out just who he is.
Will you please stop it!
It's getting on my nerves.
Never mind all that!
I got something in this shaker you won't believe!
I'm losing my mind!
Trudy, you come over here too.
We can at least keep each other company.
Strange, there's no one here.
You two take a look upstairs.
If there isn't anyone here, how did they get off the island?
Unless some friends happened to pass by and picked them up.
Could be, sir.
There's no one here.
There doesn't seem to be anyone upstairs, sir.
I'll be damned.
Well, that's all we can do.
My head is killing me!
Do you two feel all right?
George!
We've been drugged.
Somebody put something in that drink.
It can't be.
I made it myself.
If it wasn't you, who could it have been?
Who could have put a drug in our glasses?
Any one of us.
What for?
It was probably meant to kill us, but it wasn't strong enough.
- Who could it be?
- It had to be one of us.
We all fell asleep except Nick.
- Strange... we're all still alive.
- At least for now.
Shall we bet who dies first?
The dead one wins.
The yacht should be here already.
It won't be much longer anyway.
- What happened?
- It's very simple.
The machine kept on recording while we were asleep.
- And they didn't see us.
- That's right. It's absurd!
Not only absurd... impossible!
We were here.
Evidently we weren't.
What did you say?
You want us all to go crazy?
So that's your game, eh?
Why don't you kill us like you did the others?
You're the one who's crazy, and I was blind not to see it before!
But you're through now.
I'll get you first!
Well! A very interesting point of view.
I must confess
I had underestimated you, Trudy.
Oh, really? Why?
Do you think thatJack is right?
That I'm the killer?
Sit down, Trudy.
It doesn't matter what I think.
I'm not a man of thought.
I'm a man of action.
Take this, my dear.
It's my million dollars.
I don't think you're crazy, and money's important, isn't it?
Very important.
I see you're quite clever, George.
You want me to help you?
Just wait here.
All right. I trust you.
Damn it!
It won't start.
- Trudy, Jack, where are you?
- Right here.
I saw what you found, and you'll be sorry you did.
You know, if you hadn't,
I would have let you live.
Stay where you are.
I'm the one that got rid of the launch.
And the telephone.
And you killed Nick. But when?
While you and Trudy were asleep.
But we were all drugged!
The sleeping pills were only in your two glasses.
Why?
So that when the sailors came, they wouldn't find you... so they would think you had gone.
You won't get away with it!
Where will you put the bodies?
I'll hide them in the launch, and then I'll sink it.
They'll find it!
The water's very deep, and I have no other choice.
Look, Jack, you said you didn't want to kill me.
That was my original plan.
I wanted you alive, to take the blame for everything.
- After all, you killed the professor.
- I did? How do you figure that?
- I killed the others, but not him.
- I didn't either!
- I don't believe you!
- And Peggy?
She had to die too.
She knew too much.
And leaving witnesses behind would be bad for my health.
Trudy, is that you?
Come in, Jack.
Don't be afraid.
I'm unarmed, as you see.
I heard that you don't like people around who know too much... and that you killed the professor, which was not part of our plans.
I didn't kill your husband.
So if it wasn't George, it must have been you.
- Now why would I do that?
- I don't know.
There are lots of things you don't know... while I know that you can't shoot me.
I'm the only who knows where the formula is hidden... and you find that very interesting, don't you?
So there's not much you can do but stick to the bargain.
Just like you, right?
You've already pocketed two checks... and if I want the formula
I'll have to give you mine too.
- That's right, Jack.
- Okay.
Come with me.
For all these reasons... this court finds you responsible... for the death of your friend and colleague, Dr. Kruger... whom you murdered with the express intent and purpose... of stealing the formula of an important discovery of his... for your own unlawful gain.
You are condemned to be hanged by the neck until dead.
You're probably a little surprised that I've come.
Do you understand how much I love you?
I worshiped you from the moment I first looked into your sweet, gentle eyes.
I even loved you after I found out you'd killed that man for his formula.
You believe me, don't you?
I'm not judging you.
You're the only man I'll ever love.
I don't mean to scold you, but why the pentothal bullets?
And then why did you keep on with the pentothal?
That's what really did it.
That's what my father does with animals, to save them.
I didn't know it would have the effect of making you talk... and that you would tell that officer everything you had done.
It was a real piece of bad luck.
How could I have known about that?
When my father shoots animals with sodium pentothal... they just lie there.
They don't talk.
I thought I could save you.
They were going to kill you, you know.
- Thanks.
- That's all right.
You know, maybe you...
Maybe I what?
You could help me.
I'm fat broke.
You spent three million dollars?
No, just two.
Darling, come closer.
I cashed Jack's check and George's check, but not Nick's.
I would do it but I need the account number.
They ask you for it.
It's a very simple number.
I love you, Fritz!
I'll pray for you, my love!
- Drive to Lausanne.
- Yes, miss. Where is that?
Switzerland.
Three hundred?
Not a happy figure, Herr Schmidt.
You guaranteed seven hundred and fifty.
I don't care what your problems are.
Look, you fulfill your contract.
Seven hundred and fifty, all in prime condition, on the job.
In Dusseldorf. Monday.
Smoke bother you?
Where there's smoke there's fire.
Brighten my day.
Call back.
Mr. Amafi.
Just one moment.
Good morning, Mr. Amafi.
Schmidt's making a delivery on Monday.
Seven hundred and fifty to Dusseldorf.
From the Ivory Coast?
Only three hundred.
The rest from Senegal.
Tell Angelo to come in.
And get yourself a cup of coffee.
Yes, Mr. Amafi.
Yes?
Names, dates, places.
He's been a busy boy.
Are you sure he's the Emir's son?
It took some persuasion, but he finally talked.
For the benefit of the others, an example has to be made.
Kill him.
What about his father?
He's got a lot of clout.
He can't throw a spear all the way from New York, now can he?
"Kill him. "
What's happening?
Some Africans are looking for you.
I don't know any Africans, brother.
You come!
- Central Answering, can I help you?
- Yeah, baby. Anything?
- Is that you, Mr. Shaft?
- That's right.
A Mr. Ramila's been calling you every 10 minutes since 2:00.
You come.
You tell Mr. R, if he calls again, that I got too many friends with troubles.
I don't do business with strangers.
Freeze.
Where did you study stick fighting,
Mr. Shaft?
Conducting the New York Philharmonic.
The Emir will be pleased.
Also by the fact you're already circumcised.
Mr. Shaft, the temperature is 110 degrees.
Are you comfortable?
Shit!
I'd be more comfortable if you'd forget to pay your light bills.
We want you to walk back and forth across the sand for the next eight hours.
If you survive, we will talk.
Man, I already got my tan. Let's talk now!
I said walk! Walk or die!
Very ingenious, Mr. Shaft.
Forgive us, Mr. Shaft.
This is Emir Ramila.
Leader of the Manta tribe in East Africa.
Out of my turf.
This is Wassa, my brain and Ossiat, my strong right arm.
They will prepare you.
Mineral water, Mr. Shaft. Quite pure.
Give me some scotch, man.
I know a great deal about you.
But until tonight, it was all hearsay.
- I had to know.
- Know what?
Would you kill a man?
You fired two shots at Ossiat without hesitation.
Yes, I learned. You would kill a man.
About those shots.
Why is the brother still breathing?
Next time, between the eyes.
How good are you with the stick?
Cat named Shaft ain't gonna be bad with the stick.
From childhood, the men of my tribes used the stick...
...to herd cattle, ward off hyenas, and to fight.
If you were awkward with the stick, it would have taken too long to train you.
Thanks for the offer, but I live in a restricted neighborhood, no hyenas.
You want to call me a cab?
Third question:
Could you survive under desert conditions?
I liked what you did, burying yourself in the sand.
We've found our man, Mr. Shaft.
You!
Okay.
I'll walk.
I make you a most generous offer.
Is that American or Hong Kong?
$15,000 now, $10,000 later.
And what do I have to do?
Become a slave.
Colonel Gondar, John Shaft.
The Colonel is with the Central
Police Authority in Addis Ababa.
He's working with us and with the Organization of African Unity.
A good deal of time and money has been invested in selecting you, Mr. Shaft.
And I guess what you did is looked in the Addis Ababa yellow pages...
...and there I was, John Shaft, investigator. Right?
It was somewhat more involved than that.
What's this slave jive?
Two months ago, a truck crossed the border from Italy into France.
The driver managed to escape.
The French authorities gave the men water and time to rest...
...then hustled them back into Italy and marked the incident closed.
What were they? Italians?
No. Young Africans.
This particular group was smuggled from the Ivory Coast to Italy, then into France.
Smuggled? Why?
To do all the dirty, back-breaking jobs white Europeans refuse to do.
Road gangs, factories, kitchens...
Maybe they needed the bread.
The recruiters are luring thousands of young Africans into Europe every month.
They've no work permits, no social security.
If they complain, they're deported.
They work a 16-hour day, 7 days a week, for literally pennies.
This, Mr. Shaft, is slavery in the 20th century.
Then just arrest the cats who are hustling the people and that's the end of that.
We want the men at the top.
We need a trained investigator.
Somebody they don't know.
To infiltrate their organization.
To do this, he has to let himself be recruited in Africa.
So, get an African investigator.
They know all our men.
- Get someone who's not an investigator.
- We did.
My son let himself be recruited in East Africa.
His body was found last week in Paris.
In a ditch.
An uptown dude like me.
They'd spot me a mile away.
Not if you're briefed in tribal ways.
And learn the Manta dialect.
I was 21 before I found out that "isn't" is another way of saying "ain't. "
Aleme, come in.
This is my daughter, Aleme.
Aleme has come to instruct you, Mr. Shaft.
They vanished as mysteriously as they appeared.
But they left behind our spoken culture...
...their drums, their copper spears, their beaded crowns.
Nobody knows what happened to them.
But our tribes are descended from these proud ancestors.
Don't laugh, Mr. Shaft.
Your survival depends on how much you can remember.
Who's laughing?
I was just thinking, they made us study Shakespeare in school.
Was he ever a Johnny-come-lately...
...compared to your cats grooving on poetry a thousand years ago.
Sure blow their minds at P.S. 64!
Our officials fall into two categories.
Macha. Tulama.
Not bad. You are progressing.
Why don't you get rid of that Jolly Giant there...
...so that you and I can get down to the finer strokes?
Ossiat has guarded me since I was a child.
Sometimes I think of him as my living chastity belt.
Damn!
Man that size, baby.
That's a whole lot of chastity.
I'm still in my first age-grade.
We call that Fareita.
No one is permitted to marry while they're in Fareita.
What do you do for relaxation?
I enter Chela, my second age-grade, this February.
Then, even the Emir's daughter may have sex and marry.
After my clitoridectomy.
Your what?
My clitoridectomy, female circumcision.
You mean, when they cut off your...
Are you afraid to say the word?
My clitoris?
Yes.
That's what they do in the time of Chela.
Hell, no wonder the natives get restless.
The emphasis in our marriages is not upon sexual pleasure...
...but upon the rearing of children.
Listen, baby...
February's just around the corner.
How are you going to know what you're missing unless...
...you give it a little wear and tear before they take it away?
- Are you volunteering?
- You're damn right.
Do not kiss!
Where's your stick?
It's time for your lesson.
Shit!
It's back there. Why don't you get it for me while I warm up?
Tingat. Wulan.
Saho.
Here is your first payment, Mr. Shaft.
A check for $15,000.
And your airline ticket.
You leave in the morning!
From up here it doesn't look so big, does it?
I mean, New York. It's not so big.
LA's got more square miles.
Tokyo and London both have more people.
Oh, you don't speak English.
You must be African.
Manta.
My name's Williams.
If there's anything you need, let me know.
Standard Oil?
By god! Now, that's something!
Can't speak the language, but knows about Standard Oil!
How about General Motors?
Coca Cola.
Are you okay, Mr. Shaft?
Go catch your plane to Addis.
Who are you?
I'm not with Standard Oil.
Then I guess he's not with Coca Cola.
Thanks.
"He will never live to reach Africa. "
Yet I am told he's already boarded Ethiopian Airlines...
...Flight 175, at Orly, en route to Addis Ababa.
How can you explain that?
They had somebody with him out of New York.
He took my man by surprise.
Shaft was simply lucky.
First editions always worry me.
Luck can run out, even for you, my black brother.
Consider him a dead man.
I was under the impression you were to kill whoever the Emir hired in New York.
Wasn't that our agreement?
The Emir might have suspected me.
This man, Shaft, seemed too dangerous on his home ground.
But in Africa...
Picture, sir?
He's quite tame.
I hope you'll both be very happy.
Colonel Gondar sent me.
This way, please, sir.
We have a choice of poses. You can kneel and put your arms around him.
You can straddle and ride him.
Or you can put your head in his mouth.
Is that right?
You are to go at once.
Thank you, sir. Keep the receipt.
I'll see you get your picture tomorrow.
Sorry for this cloak-and-dagger business.
The incident at Orly gave us a nasty shock.
That incident at Orly gave me a nasty shock!
You trust her?
She's a cousin of mine.
I'll never turn my back again on a cleaning woman.
Who was the cat in drag who tried to kill me?
A Sardinian named Bocco.
An assassin with a long criminal record.
And the dude who saved my ass?
He works with us.
Well, it seems we've brought you a long distance for nothing.
Obviously, the opposition knows about you.
If you choose to call it off, we'll understand.
What, and blow $25,000?
Only money brings you here?
Hell, no. I just love having my picture taken with lions.
Your forebearers were dragged in chains from this continent...
...and dumped onto the cotton plantations of America.
I'd think you'd want the assignment for stronger motives than money.
You're wrong! My folks weren't in cotton.
They were in tobacco.
The Emir tells me you've learned how to use this.
This particular fighting stick is a rather special one.
Thirty-six exposures. Extra film in here.
You'll leave your bag with me and take this one.
There's food in here and this.
Tape recorder.
To record, turn clockwise.
To stop recording, turn it back.
Wait a minute. I'm not James Bond.
Simply Sam Spade.
Wear that pouch around your waist.
Under this robe.
- I hope that's a 40 long.
- You'll be living in it.
With these sandals, until the recruiters issue you Western work clothes.
If you get that far.
What about some iron?
Iron?
A piece.
No gun.
Too difficult to hide and a dead giveaway if somebody searches your bag.
Anyway, you've got your stick.
Is that right?
We've selected a zabana who speaks English. He won't leave your side.
- A"zabana"?
- A bodyguard.
If a gun is too conspicuous, a bodyguard will be like putting it on the 6:00 news.
Once you leave Ethiopia, you'll be in a territory...
...where everybody has zabanas.
Even the zabanas have zabanas.
Yours is named Kopo.
He will join you along the way.
Study this.
It's a route we've laid out which should bring you into contact with the recruiters.
If you live long enough to get to Paris, there's a telephone number written here.
Memorize it and call the moment you arrive.
And burn that map and that number before you leave this room.
I wish you luck. God knows you'll need it.
Here!
That's all! Got to make it last.
Spot! Come here!
Come here!
Dummy, come here!
Follow me.
No one will see us.
My people build these nests to keep crows away from the corn.
Is that a fact?
The farmer gets up here and fires away.
How did you get rid of your big shot,
Old Ossiat?
He just had his sixth child. So I slipped away while he was celebrating.
I passed your bus near the border, but when I got there you weren't on it.
Only that dead man.
So I doubled back.
I had to see you.
John, they know who you are.
Well, I figured that. They already tried to kill me twice.
Don't worry, they can't make it.
Were you disappointed I wasn't a virgin?
Hell no, baby.
You had some good teachers.
John...
This is hardly the time to talk about it...
...but I've made an important decision because of you.
Well, my daddy told me, he said, "John...
"... the one time you should never ever make an important decision...
"... is right after you've made love. "
It's about my clitoridectomy.
That's an important decision, all right.
When February comes,
I'm not going to let them do it.
I am Kopo, your zabana.
Put out your hand.
What is the meaning of this gesture?
It just means,
"Brother, I am glad to see you! "
Come!
- What was that all about?
- He's the district headman.
Everything that happens around here he knows.
He says the white man this week takes our people...
...from the town of Maiberra to the north.
Then we go north.
He says that in Maiberra, when the sun stands two more times above our heads...
...two men will die.
Maiberra?
Get in line! Get in there! Move in!
Sign.
What I sign?
Sign you say you give back money.
Food, clothes, boat.
How much you pay me?
200 francs each month.
What's your name?
Jowi.
Okay, Jowi.
Jowi!
Take your dog and bury him.
Nobody's ever cried for you, have they, baby?
Nobody even knows you're gone.
Son of a bitch, you know who I am, don't you? Who told you?
Who sent that cat after me at the airport?
And on the bus?
Talk, motherfucker, talk!
"Marco Sassari. "
Another late, not-so-great Sardinian.
Died December 12 from a stiff neck...
...in a town called Maiberra...
...as the sun stood overhead.
The headman said that two men would die.
He was wrong.
Only one man died...
...and two dogs.
Quick, come! We go! Come!
Now! All of you!
This Zubair.
He take you cross desert.
I no forget you.
You speak English?
Little.
Ziba, you beat him?
I beat.
Good. I don't like Ziba.
You ride front with me.
You know how to ride camel?
No ride camel. Ride ass.
You learn to ride camel.
I show you. Come on.
Sit here. Cross leg, like this.
See? Easy. Now you.
Cross leg! Cross leg! Cross!
Slow down.
I'd give ten years of my life if I could do that.
To be able to see the world only in sexual terms.
And to feel it, the way you do, Jazar.
Such diligence, Mr. Wassa. I'm impressed.
Imagine, you flying all the way from Africa to be sure your laborers are doing well.
Look at them.
Happy in their work.
Are you happy in your work?
Piro and Sassari are both dead.
Shaft killed them.
The last time we talked it was Shaft's life or yours.
He will be boarding Vanden's boat tomorrow morning.
I flew in to ask you to contact Vanden.
Get him to delay his departure.
I will not contact Vanden.
He's too weak in the stomach.
I suggest you get down to El Jardia today...
...and deal with Mr. Shaft personally.
May I help?
How?
I could divert his attention while Wassa did whatever he wished to do.
The real reason, my pet.
I'm bored. I need some excitement.
We both do.
Listen, Mr. Wassa.
I don't love this young lady.
I don't even particularly like her.
But she's the only person in the world
I've ever found who can get it up for me.
I want her back by Friday of this week.
If anything should happen to her...
...or if Shaft is still breathing by this time tomorrow...
...I'll have you killed...
...wherever you happen to be.
The young lady will meet you at the airport in one hour.
I wish I could watch you with Shaft.
Where will you do it?
On the boat.
I like the way it rocks you back and forth.
Get it on tape. Play it back for me Friday.
That's a delicious idea!
If you do it, I'll buy you an emerald.
How large an emerald?
Boat come tomorrow.
You be here first light.
Now, you go to town.
Get girls. Buy gifts for home.
No money.
I give. You sign paper. You pay later.
Hey! You, my guest. Good shot.
You come to town with me.
No. Leave it here. It's safer.
Where we go, the girls, they steal!
No wonder they call Africa the Mother Country!
But, Mama, I ain't gonna fight it.
Where's Jowi?
Come on!
Ciao, baby.
I want names, baby!
I want to know every name you know!
Who's paying you and who sent you after me?
If I tell, they kill me!
What the fuck do you think I'm going to do.
Now, talk!
I'm your friend.
I kill the man who sent me.
I do this for you.
Talk! Talk!
Now, talk, or I'll break the other one!
Next time, you mother, don't bite off more than you can chew.
All that lot?
I am to be paid for 41.
What do you think we're running, the Queen Mary?
I am to be paid for 41!
- A hundred more.
- For what?
I bring you happy men.
They sign, you pay.
Stow it, Sadi!
The man's entitled to his money.
That's the contract.
Any expenses advance have to be collected on delivery before the next leg of the trip.
Don't worry.
We'll get it back when we dock.
May Allah be with you.
All right, gentlemen!
Everyone into the hold!
Come on, move it!
Sadi, get them stowed below.
Get them out of those robes and into work clothes!
Well?
When did he bathe last?
Very soon now, in 500 feet of water.
Not until I spend the night with him.
What if he hurts you?
I'm counting on it.
If anything happens to you,
Amafi will kill me.
If I don't get to spend the night with this man...
...I'll tell Amafi you raped me.
You know what he'd do to you?
When it's dark, have the Captain bring them up on the deck...
...in small groups, for fresh air...
...and for exercise.
They are going to kill you.
Don't pretend you don't understand.
You are John Shaft.
Jowi. Jowi.
Look, Mr. Shaft, I am offering you life.
Why?
If you help me...
...I'll help you.
Your place or mine?
I do hope you're not looking for the shower.
I like natural men.
Who's planning to kill me?
Wassa.
So that's where it leaked.
How long is your phallus?
My what?
Your cock.
Baby, by now it's shrunk down to 20 inches.
Wassa, that son of a bitch!
You can usually tell by the size of a man's nose.
Or the length and thickness of his thumbs.
I always look for a man with prominent nose...
...and long, thick thumbs.
Baby, you're not turning me on.
I got too many things on my mind.
A man who's been in the desert as long as you have?
You know...
...the man who pays my bills...
...thinks I'm oversexed.
And whatever gave him that idea?
Baby, this just may blow your mind, but I ain't about to fuck you.
I'm taking you out of here now, as a hostage.
Do it later. Please.
Please.
Move it, baby.
No hidden gun. Look for yourself.
We've been recorded.
By what network?
He asked me to put our love affair on tape.
What's his name?
If I tell you, will you come to bed?
Tell me first, and then I'll decide.
He's the one you are looking for.
Vincent Amafi.
Head of the whole business.
You're going to take me to him, yes?
I know he'd like to meet you.
Where is he?
Paris.
Paris.
We may as well be comfortable together...
...while we cross the Med.
What's your name?
Does it matter?
My God!
Baby, my nose may not be too prominent...
...but I've got two of the longest, thickest thumbs...
You saved Amafi the trouble.
Get dressed, baby!
Why?
There's a motorboat on deck.
We're taking it for a ride.
You know something?
You're the first man who's ever made love to me the way a man should.
Fantastic, baby.
Write my congressman later.
Come on, get dressed!
Whatever you say, John.
Untie it!
John!
Thanks, baby.
- Hello?
- Your call, Mr. Amafi.
Oh, yes, Operator. Put him on.
Good morning, Captain.
A bloody rotten morning!
Wassa's dead, shot to death.
My first officer deserted at sea.
The police are due any minute.
And the girl?
Who the hell knows?
Probably gone off with Sadi.
The men you brought across, where are they now?
In the trucks, on the way to Paris!
Where else should they be?
Idiot! You let them go?
Listen, with a goddamned corpse aboard...
...and a hold full of illegal Africans, how could I explain them to the police?
This is going to cost you extra money,
Mr. Amafi.
Otherwise, from now on, you can get yourself another captain.
Angelo.
Come on! Come on!
Perreau is here!
Your friend Perreau is here!
Come on! Listen to Perreau!
Me, Perreau. Your friend.
Me tell you what to do...
...where go, where work.
I pick up money. Your money.
Save you time.
Pay back cost of your journey...
...this room, clothes, food.
Perreau, I take care everything.
Now, this room cost you each
100 francs a month.
We only earn 200 francs a month.
But this room, we pay half?.
No space in Paris. Very costly.
No room, you in street.
In street...
...police come.
Ask question. Send you home.
But, how you go home?
Owe money!
So, go prison.
Lock up.
100 francs a month, everybody stay happy! No?
This is a clock. Alarm clock.
Perreau set time.
You sleep three hours.
Then, clock ring. You get up.
I come, pick you up, we go work.
Here... francs!
Francs for soap...
...candy...
You divide.
Three hours.
I come back.
We friends of Jowi. Jowi here?
Jowi?
Jowi! Jowi!
Jowi not here! Oyo, his friend, that room!
Oyo? Your name Oyo?
Inspector Cusset...
...John Shaft.
A pleasure, monsieur.
All of us are impressed...
...and grateful.
Pictures and tapes...
...starting with the cat who tried to take my seat on the bus in Addis...
...ending right here in Paris with a little gopher named Perreau.
- He'll pick us up in three hours.
- We'll process this immediately.
Then, if you are not too tired...
...a police stenographer will take down your entire statement.
- I'm not too tired.
- Perreau? The name is unknown to me.
But, a little gopher, you say, coming to pick you up.
Surely he can't be the kingpin of African recruiting.
Kingpin's a cat named Vincent Amafi.
Another unknown name.
We'll see if we find a monsieur Amafi and put him under surveillance.
I'll find him.
I'm grateful, monsieur, but from now on we will do the work.
I've got a personal thing with Mr. Amafi.
I remind you, monsieur, you are now back in a civilized country...
...where due process of law prevails.
Inspector, I resent that implication.
My country was building churches while your people were still living in caves.
Forgive me, Colonel.
I didn't mean to imply-
Get your stenographer and I'll give her
10 minutes and then I've got things to do.
Amafi did this trying to find me.
The law will punish him.
Fuck the law!
What does it do about the shitheads who charge 100 francs a month...
...to stay in a craphouse like this?
Why don't you really clamp down on the slave trade?
I'll tell you why!
The black ghetto of Paris is as far away...
...from the Champs Elysées as 125th Street is from Park Avenue!
You need a bunch of poor bastards to work on your roads and in your damn kitchens!
So, don't lay any of that law-will-punish-him shit on me!
Alarm clock, she work!
Where do you take the money you collect?
- Where does Amafi do business?
- Perreau, he knows nothing!
Rue Chalet, 11!
Stay here, keep your head down!
Damn close, baby.
- I heard shooting-
- Damn right!
Look around and check those files!
Anything that could lead us to Amafi!
Now, tell us, where is Jowi?
Don't know! Don't know!
Jowi?
This is where they killed him.
Killed who?
My brother. He wrote this in our language.
What does it mean?
Castle.
Mountain.
Fort.
Castle, mountain, fort?
"Château Marquis. Château Michelle.
"Château Montfort.
"Built by Count André Montfort in 1787.
Family residence...
"... until commandeered by German occupying forces.
"Used as Gestapo headquarters and prison from 1942 to 1944."
Where is it?
"Situated 14 kilometers outside of Paris on the main road to Amiens. "
Call Inspector Cusset and tell him where I've gone.
- Has he told you?
- No! Nothing!
You dumb bastards!
Trying to run away, to go to the police!
I've given thousands of jobs to Africans.
They don't complain!
But because of you troublemakers and that bastard, Shaft...
...I have to leave this country. So...
...I'm going to bury you all along with the evidence.
Almost there.
Mr. Shaft?
Yeah, me.
I played the tapes.
I listened to you making love to her.
And her to you.
Why did you have to kill her?
One of your men threw a knife.
She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Then why wasn't her body still onboard ship?
I promised her a boat ride.
Well, she would have liked that.
All right, throw out your iron.
There's only one way out of here.
I've wired this place for demolition.
I've got 40 hostages down below.
Unless you drop your gun and step out where I can see you...
...I'll set off the charges.
You're bluffing, man.
Look down at your feet.
No point in trying to pull those lines.
The wires you can see are for the upper staircase only.
I've got a detonator down here for this half block.
All right?
Out... where I can see you!
Hey, Jowi!
Monsieur, unless you hurry, you are going to miss your plane.
Where does a guy get a cab around here?
Merci.
A I'aéroport.
One of our passengers has asked if you'd mind company.
Put her right here, baby.
English subtitles conformed by
SOFTITLER
They found us again.
Another one has found us.
We have to go further.
Not yet.
- Mr. Crockett?
- Yes.
My name is Mears. Ben Mears.
I'm looking for a place to rent.
- Hmm. For how long?
- Ah, six months maybe.
- Family?
- No.
- Furnished?
- Yes.
I can't think of any.
- How about that house on the hill?
- Which house?
- The one as you come into town.
- The Marsten House?
- Is that for sale or rent?
- It's sold.
I can't think of anything, not offhand.
You might try Eva Miller's boarding house.
It's real nice.
It's on Railroad Street.
- You go...
- Yeah, I remember.
- You remember?
- Thank you very much.
Funny about the Marsten House.
Vacant over 20 years.
Uh, Cully's going to Portland tomorrow.
Good afternoon, Mr. Crockett.
You sure fixed it up.
You think so?
You like it?
Fine job.
Sure a lot different from that doctor's office I sold you.
I'd have to agree with you.
Very tasteful. Very tasteful.
Yes?
Thank you.
Mr. Barlow, um...
Will arrive. Soon.
A lot of people have been waiting.
For Mr. Barlow.
You know how it is with a small town.
People don't have that much to do.
Ah, yes, well,
I can assure you that people will find Mr. Barlow well worth the wait.
Especially you, Mr. Crockett. I've told him already how helpful you've been.
Getting us the house and the store.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Are you a writer?
- Yes.
- What do you write?
- Books.
- Have I read any?
- Have you read any books?
- Your books.
I don't know.
How do I get breakfast?
Oh, the kitchen's open to one and all.
Just keep your things stored separate.
- Uh, do you work at night?
- Sometimes.
- Well, you can't work too late, because...
- I won't.
- Well, I hope you like it.
- I'm sure I will.
- How come you came here?
- Real estate man sent me.
Uh, no, I mean to Salem's Lot.
Strangers don't usually come here this time of year. Not yet.
I'm not a stranger.
That's no way to leave a book.
You know, a book like that, you're gonna break the binding.
It's you, isn't it?
It is you.
People ought to respect a book.
Even if it isn't especially well written.
- It's well written.
- Do you mind if I sit down?
No, not at all.
Why did you call it Air Dancer?
Did you read the book?
Well, no, not all of it, um...
In fact, I was just getting into it.
- In fact...
- In fact, you got bored.
No, not in fact.
I just, um...
Wanted to finish this first.
- I'm gonna read it.
- Oh, you don't have to.
Wait, what's your name?
Susan Norton.
I teach art at Holly Elementary.
My father's a doctor in town.
You know, the reason that I, um, actually took your book out of the library is because I read your other one.
- Title?
- I don't remember.
Do you want to have some dinner?
- No, you got a boyfriend.
- Um...
Well, not exactly.
It says here you're married, no children.
- Still married, still no children?
- Ah...
She died. I got no children.
I got some memories. Some of them good, some of them not so good.
You didn't answer my question.
- Which one was that?
- Dinner.
I'd love to.
Good evening.
- Good night.
- See you tomorrow.
And, uh, tomorrow night.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Look, he's got to make a delivery and a pickup.
Besides, he always calls.
You know that.
Good night, honey.
Weasel.
What are you doing out here, Weasel?
Sitting.
Spying more like, huh?
- Oh, no, Parkins.
- Cully set you to it?
No, no, no.
Better not.
That, uh...
- That writer who moved into Eva's...
- Yeah.
- Right down the hall.
- I heard.
Can you, uh...
Can you keep an eye on him?
Well, what's he done?
Keep your eye on him and your mouth shut.
- You got that?
- What's he done?
Murdered 18 people.
18 people?
Every one of them an old man who kept asking,
"What's he done?"
Oh...
Keep an eye on him for me, huh?
There, Faithful.
Hi, honey.
What are you watching?
Nothing.
Wanna stay home tonight?
Sure, why not?
Well, don't get drunk.
I want some fun in tonight.
You know what happens when you drink too much.
I'm gonna get something out of the freezer.
- Twenty minutes?
- Hey...
Bring me a beer.
Mmm.
Thank you.
So, you're staying at Eva Miller's?
I don't mind telling you, she was quite a dish.
We kids used to watch her sashaying down the street.
- Bill.
- Well, we did.
- Men.
- Men.
- Would you like some coffee, Mr. Mears?
- Oh yes, please.
- How do you take it, Ben?
- Black.
- Dad?
- You know what I think of caffeine.
- And you still drink coffee.
- Mornings only, and I don't recommend it.
Yeah, Eva married this fellow called Weasel Phillips.
And he came up to about here on her.
Thin as a heron's leg.
Smelled like a skunk.
Never made a decent living.
Nobody could figure out why.
They got divorced, but he's still living over there.
Life in a small town.
What's his book about?
Well, his latest one, it's about, um...
Two men.
Not one of those?
- What are you doing in here?
- Nothing, Eva, nothing.
- What's that?
- Just a piece of paper, Eva.
Nothing on it. Just paper.
He got a lot of scribbling here, too.
- Something about a boy...
- A boy and a house.
"The house was a monument to evil, sitting there all these years,
"holding the essence of evil in its smoldering bones."
Monument? Whose monument?
The Marsten House?
I don't know.
He stopped in the middle of a sentence.
"Sitting there all these years, holding the essence of evil."
Writes real good.
- Thank you very much for the dinner.
- Good to meet you, Mr. Mears.
- I'll get you a copy of that book.
- Sorry about the peas. She's done better.
Goodbye, Dad.
Well...
They liked you.
Well, your father, maybe.
My mother doesn't like anyone except Ned Tebbets.
- And, who's he?
- Oh, someone I've been seeing.
- Have been or had been?
- Mmm, a little of both.
What is he really doing in Salem's Lot?
Writing a book, he says.
- Did he say about what?
- No, he didn't say, and I didn't ask him.
So, uh, tell me about Ned Tibbit.
Tebbets.
- After college?
- New York.
I worked in an ad agency.
I was a junior.
I did layouts mostly, things like that.
- You like it?
- I loved it.
But then, something happened, the agency lost a big account, and had to cut back, and, all of a sudden there I was, out on the street looking for a job.
It's a cruel city.
- Anyway, finally...
- You had to come home.
Retreat.
Sanctuary. I was all beat up.
I was glad to have a little loving care.
How long since, um, your wife died?
Two years.
- Is that what you're writing about?
- No, I'm...
I'm writing about a house.
A house?
- The Marsten House?
- The Marsten House.
I see.
No, I don't see.
Hey, uh, where are we going?
Well, there's the Dell, the movies in Bangor.
And then there's the lake.
And where do you want to go?
Let's go to the lake.
Are you uncomfortable with me?
Why, should I be?
No, I just have a habit of asking questions.
- Well, I have a habit of evading them.
- Perfect match.
I like you, Ben.
Modern, aggressive female, partially liberated, states her feelings.
- Well...
- Does that make you uncomfortable?
No, it makes me feel good.
How long will you be staying?
Oh, we'll see how the book comes.
- Are you a slow writer?
- I'm medium.
I hope it's a long book.
Crockett Realty.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes.
Yes, sir, right away.
- I will be right back.
- Okay, honey.
Please don't say that.
Someday you'll forget.
All right, honey.
I forgot.
Getting warmer.
That's very good of you to come over, Mr. Crockett.
I need your help again.
Always glad to be of assistance.
Yes, I appreciate that.
And, as I've told you, you will be amply rewarded.
Now, I'd like you to have your truck at the Portland docks tonight.
7:00 sharp, at the Custom House Wharf.
All arrangements have been made.
7:00, Custom House.
Two movers will be sufficient, I think.
Two men.
I have a very valuable, uh, sideboard, a Hepplewhite, that has to be picked up.
It's to be taken to the house.
You understand?
- Sideboard taken to house.
- Yes.
And your movers will put it down in the cellar.
They can get in through the outside bulkhead...
Uh, below the kitchen window, as you know.
You won't be there?
No, I must drive into Boston.
I'll be back tomorrow morning.
And there's just one other thing.
You will procure four stout padlocks.
- Four?
- Mmm-hmm. Four.
And your men will leave the keys for all four locks on the basement table.
And when they leave, they will padlock the bulkhead door, the front door, the back door and the shed garage.
You have that?
I have it.
Thank you very much, Mr. Crockett.
I'm extremely pleased that I can always call on you.
That you can.
And Mr. Barlow?
Oh, I've told you, you should be meeting him soon.
Very soon, Mr. Crockett, and
I'm sure that he'll find it a pleasure.
The winds of revolt swept through the township of Jerusalem's Lot, soon to be known as Salem's Lot.
Down with the British. Hooray for freedom.
Men took out their long rifles, kissed their wives and children goodbye, and marched off to join George Washington.
Daddy, come back safe.
Daddy, let me come with you.
I'm old enough to fight.
I'll be back, but not until we've won the right to be free men.
The war was long and bitter.
Some men from Salem's Lot fought at Valley Forge, suffering through that long, cold winter.
Others helped gain victory at Saratoga and triumph over Cornwallis.
And when the war ended...
Where is Daddy? Won't he ever come home?
Yes, Salem's Lot had its share of heroes, living and dead.
But they had fought for the greatest treasure of all, liberty.
O beautiful for spacious skies
Mr. Burke.
Are the kids still running the pageant?
What?
Are the kids still running the school pageant?
With a little editorial help from me.
Very little, as I remember.
My name is Ben Mears.
You probably don't remember me.
Oh, of course I do. I've read your books.
I wouldn't have written them if it hadn't been for you.
Well, you just said a very large thing.
I'd like you to explain it.
- Can't we talk about it tonight?
- Oh, sure.
I don't know how you can work here.
- It'd scare the hell out of me.
- Oh.
It's kind of nice here.
During the day.
It's pretty and it's quiet, you know.
Too quiet, especially at night.
Well, I'm hardly ever here at night.
They are.
What's up?
I need a strong back tonight.
Want to make, uh, 50 bucks?
- Fifty bucks?
- That's for two of you.
You're gonna need another strong back.
- What about you?
- Me?
Yeah, I got something else planned for tonight.
Hey there, teacher.
Can I carry your books for you?
Oh, uh...
- Sorry. I'll...
- No, that's all right.
Do you have your car with you?
No, I came by to see Jason Burke.
Thought I'd wait around for you.
Take a walk home.
- I won't do that again.
- Hey, come on.
Um, will you wait for me here, please?
- Get in.
- No.
- Susan...
- You have no right to do this.
You said you loved me.
- You'd said it.
- That was 100 years ago.
It has nothing to do with him.
So you were doing something up at the lake.
Oh, please.
What time do you think you'll get back home, honey?
Well, with all the junking around, locking up, those things take, uh, five, six hours.
Be back midnight or after.
You stay away from her, you hear?
I'll try.
You try real hard.
She's all mine, right, honey?
You big, bad bear, go on.
He was just kidding.
Look, if he suspected anything, would he kid?
Cully.
You know, you shouldn't leave your truck double-parked like this.
Now, you wouldn't want me to go all the way to Portland without saying goodbye to Bonnie, would you?
What's in Portland?
Gotta make a pickup for him.
Custom Wharf.
You know what it is?
A lot of old junk from Europe, I guess.
Don't know why anybody would wanna open an antique shop here.
- You?
- I guess they know what they're doing.
Don't leave the truck sitting here like this, huh?
I might have to ticket you.
I'll be back to get you.
Come on now, Faith, just calm down.
I'll be back soon.
Go play with the people.
Wouldn't leave a dog in there.
Oh, he's all right.
He'll go to sleep in a while.
He's a good old dog.
Faithful, come on.
I said I'd be back soon.
- Is that dog gonna whine all night?
- He'll be all right.
- You know where to go, what to do?
- Sure.
Uh...
Leave the truck here when you get back.
I'll pick it up in the morning.
You betcha.
Shut up!
What's this all about anyway?
You got any idea?
He wants Boom-Boom Bonnie to think he's going to Portland.
As a matter of fact,
Crockett himself set up this trip.
Larry Crockett?
What's he got to do with this?
Larry Crockett and Boom-Boom Bonnie?
- What's he gonna do?
- Well...
What would you do if you had a 12-gauge sitting in your garage?
Jason.
- Have a drink?
- I don't mind.
Uh, Canadian on the rocks.
- Mmm. Got us a native, huh?
- That's what he is.
Return of the native.
Or is it the prodigal son?
I got it, I got it.
- This way.
- All right, all right.
Oh, what did you say was in this?
- A sideboard.
- Man...
Sideboard.
You know...
It's funny, this crate feels very cold.
Well, it's been sitting out here.
I don't like it.
I mean, it's really strange.
It feels cold.
Well, why don't you pry?
You wanna pry it open?
- You wanna pry it open?
- No.
- Let's move it out, fellas.
- All right, we're going.
- Do you want to pry it open?
- No, no.
Let's just get it to the Marsten place.
Get rid of it.
Hell of a way to make 50 bucks.
- It's cold in here.
- Yeah.
It sure is. It shouldn't be.
It's a warm night. Turn on the heater.
Hey, that thing is moving.
Moving?
- Watch the road.
- Stop the truck.
- We should open the thing up.
- We can't do that.
But something's wrong.
It's getting cold in here.
- Let's just get it delivered.
- I want to open it.
Come on!
Man, just let me drive, will you?
Honey, it's safe.
Oh, Tiger, I'm gonna lose respect for you.
No.
Well, I don't wanna go to a motel again.
I want you right here in my own little bed.
It's more exciting to me that way.
No.
No, I'm not gonna talk like that on the phone.
You just get over here, and I'll whisper things in your pearly little ear that'll make your hair stand up.
You get here, or else...
A fire started in the old mill.
It spread rapidly on both sides of Griffin Road and burned toward the Marsten House on Pabscuitti Hill.
A fire started in the old mill.
It spread rapidly on both sides of Griffin Road and burned toward the Marsten House on Pabscuitti Hill.
The wind turned the fire back toward town.
Volunteer fire companies came from all...
Mark?
Whatever are you doing?
Rehearsing for the pageant.
Well, keep it down.
Your father's trying to figure his quarterly taxes.
All right. Oh, Mother, uh...
Danny and Ralphie Glick are coming over after they finish their homework.
We're going to rehearse.
Have you finished your homework?
- Oh yes, a long time ago.
- All right.
Just as long as you and the Glick boys don't disturb your father.
"The Marsten House on Pabscuitti Hill."
The wind turned the fire back toward town.
Volunteer fire companies came from all over the county to help fight the threatening flames.
Bright boy, Mark Petrie.
Wrote most of the pageant this year, just as you did.
- Both talented.
- Another writer, huh?
Very possibly.
I'd certainly be proud if I'd helped develop two authors.
Make a lifetime of teaching worthwhile.
- Well, you got me started.
- You had the gift.
I wanted the opportunity to continue, but, you moved away.
- Let's see, you were...
- Eleven.
Mmm.
Tell me, why the Marsten House?
I remember that figured in your pageant, too.
- Maybe because my aunt worked there.
- Hmm.
Did she ever tell you anything about what went on inside the house?
No, never.
Or Hubie Marsten?
No, she never talked about him.
But you remember that even then that house had a reputation for being a haunted house.
Every town has one.
I went up there once.
On a dare. You know how kids are.
I was sweating scared.
I sneaked around.
Got into the house.
What did you see?
Ghosts.
Everything. Every sound.
Every shadow.
I'm not sure what I saw. I, uh...
I think I saw Hubie Marsten, hanging by his neck.
His face green, his eyes puffed shut, his hands livid.
It was ghastly.
And then he opened his eyes, and he looked at me.
He looked at me.
And I took off. And I ran.
I ran as fast as I could.
I've never forgotten that.
There was something. A feeling of...
Jason, do you believe a thing can be inherently evil?
I've seen trees that looked like tortured spirits.
A house?
The Marsten House, for instance?
Can it be evil in its stone foundations, in its wooden beams, in the glass of its windows, in the plaster of its ceilings, evil?
The man who built that house...
Yeah, Joshua Vaughn.
Killed his wife and a servant.
And hanged himself in his bedroom closet.
Hubie Marsten's sister and wife died mysteriously.
Rumors of poison, never proved.
Then he came here.
And the young boys in the area started to disappear.
Some people suspected Hubie Marsten, but it was never proved.
Never proved.
And now we have a Mr. Straker.
- And a Mr. Barlow.
- Who no one has ever seen.
- And, you think...
- I think...
That an evil house attracts evil men.
But, if a house attracts evil men...
Why did it attract me?
It is moving.
- Look at it!
- We're almost there. Now, shut up.
Shut up!
What's this one?
It's a ghoul.
Girl?
"Ghoul," like in "school."
We don't have anybody like that in our school.
Oh, Mr. Peterson.
What is a ghoul?
A ghoul is an evil demon who, uh...
He preys on corpses, feeds on human beings, robs graves, things like that.
Why are you so hung up on this stuff?
I don't know, I just am.
- It's weird.
- Let's try this again.
Danny, Ralphie, your mom called.
Wants you home.
Okay, Mr. Petrie.
We know our lines okay, don't we?
Most of them.
Well, why don't you come over to our house tomorrow night, okay?
- Okay, Mr. Petrie?
- Sure.
- See you later, Mark.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Mr. Petrie.
- Good night, boys.
Mark.
When are you gonna outgrow all this?
Soon, I guess.
Well, I... I'd better fix this.
Well? Look.
The road.
The road nothing.
It sure is cold.
Come on, let's get it done.
It's freezing!
Look, I'm telling you, it's not natural.
It just ain't natural.
We gotta get it out.
Let's just grab ahold. Let's get it done.
What was that?
It's just an owl.
I never heard one before.
Sure you have, hundreds of times, millions.
- We shouldn't have gone through the woods.
- It's a shortcut.
Look, you can even see the lights of Jordan Avenue. See them?
- No.
- Hey, I'm going.
Wait. Danny, wait!
Hey, I want to know.
- Come on. Come on.
- I want to pry it open.
We can't. He'll hear.
- Who?
- Him.
Straker.
Well, I want to do it anyway.
I'll get something from the truck.
Listen.
You hear that?
Somebody's up there.
There's somebody up there.
Rats, probably. You heard rats.
It was someone. Let's split.
- Wait, we forgot to padlock the door...
- Throw them down there.
Here are the keys. Throw them down, too.
Close the doors!
Did you happen to notice the time when the boys left?
Oh, you did?
Well, then they should have been here half an hour ago.
Ask Mark if the boys said anything to him.
You know how kids are.
Henry!
Danny. Danny, what happened?
- What happened, son?
- Where's Ralphie?
- Ralph...
- Where's your brother?
I don't know.
Get Dr. Norton.
- See you.
- Yeah.
Faithful.
Here, boy.
Faithful?
Kiss me.
Come here.
That's good.
Isn't that better?
That's good.
It's better here, isn't it?
Well, well, well.
- Cully.
- Cully.
I guess I owe Weasel Phillips a case of beer after all.
Cully, look, this isn't...
- He broke in and he tried to rape me.
- He was?
- He broke in.
- A rapist?
- Is that it?
- Cully. Cully.
I'll take care of him.
- I didn't...
- Shut up, rapist.
- Cully, listen.
- Get up.
Out of the bed. Out. Out of the bed. Out.
Cully!
- Cully.
- Get up.
- Cully.
- Shut up!
Listen, Cully...
Please. Please don't do anything.
You don't want to go to jail, do you?
I'm not going to jail for killing the man who raped my wife.
That is what he did, isn't it, honey?
- Yes.
- No!
- She invited me, I swear.
- No! Cully. No.
- You invited him?
- Yes.
No! He called me, and he said that he had to talk to me, and...
- So, you invited him over?
- No!
Cully, no.
Cully, look, you don't want to go to jail for the rest of your life for what is a lie.
Come here.
Come on. Come on, in the living room.
- We've got to talk this over.
- Right, right. Let's talk it over.
We're gonna go in the living room, and we're gonna talk it over.
And then I'm coming back, hear me?
Come on, Larry.
In the living room. Man-to-man stuff.
Oh, I like your shorts.
You must, too, keeping them on like that.
- Where did you get them?
- Boston.
Sure look good on you.
Stay right there, puss.
Turn around, Larry.
Look, I know how this must look to you.
I can understand how upset you are, but let me explain what happened.
- You see...
- Now, grab the barrel, Larry.
- Huh?
- Barrel. Grab the barrel.
Easy!
Very easy.
That's it.
Now, this shotgun's got a five-pound pull on it, and I've got about three on it now.
Good boy.
Now hold it up in front of your face.
That's it, right in front.
That's it, right in front.
Careful.
You move that barrel, Larry, and I'll blow you away.
Good.
Good.
And, now...
Just hold it, Larry.
Hold it steady.
Steady, Larry. Don't move! Don't move!
There.
You see how much self-control you can have?
It's terrific.
You're doing fine, Larry, just fine.
Now, close your eyes, Larry.
Close them.
Here I come, puss.
Here comes big, bad bear.
I know you're gonna say, um,
"Don't make a big thing out of this."
No, I wasn't gonna say that.
Maybe, uh...
"Look, I can't make any commitments right now."
I wasn't gonna say that either.
What were you gonna say?
I wasn't gonna say anything.
Okay?
Told you I ask too many questions.
And I don't give enough answers.
Maybe we talk too much.
Maybe we do.
Sounds like a traffic jam.
Maybe they saw our car.
I'm gonna go take a look.
Crockett?
Crockett? Crockett?
You heard another car drive off. Then?
A car or a truck.
Which one?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Do you?
No.
Where were you people?
We were over there.
Over there?
- Parkins.
- Yeah?
Come here, will you?
Okay, okay, okay.
- You heard two cars.
- Or a car and a truck.
One drove off, huh? And then?
Oh, one more thing.
I think I heard someone get out of one car.
I'm only supposing that
'cause I didn't see it.
And get in the other car. Or truck.
That's what I think.
That's what you think?
Quite a night, huh?
First a kid disappears, then this.
You're not leaving Salem's Lot, are you?
I'm not leaving.
Don't.
- It's late.
- Where are you going?
To the hospital.
Danny Glick has collapsed.
What?
Ralphie Glick, Danny and Larry Crockett, all in one night?
Quiet little town of Salem's Lot.
Well, it's only all just happened since...
Since I came here.
Well, you didn't have anything to do with it.
I mean, you didn't even know the Glick boys, or Larry Crockett.
I met Larry Crockett.
I did see the boys rehearsing a school play.
That's not what I'm thinking.
You remember I came here to rent the Marsten House?
Yeah.
Somehow, I...
I think that my coming here has acted as a kind of catalyst.
Awakened an evil in this town.
- Oh, that's...
- Nonsense?
How is he?
Um...
Danny's never had an attack of asthma, has he?
- No.
- His file's with Dr. Goldring.
All right. I'll get the file from Goldring.
But, for now, um, any history of rheumatic fever?
Danny? No.
He's a healthy boy. No major problems.
Has he had a TB skin patch this year?
TB? Danny's got TB?
No, no. Marjorie, we're just trying to find out.
He's a healthy boy. He's athletic.
He's a normal boy.
All right, well...
We want to keep him here for some more tests.
What tests?
We just don't know yet.
Faithful?
Royal, you seen my dog?
No, I ain't seen him.
Faithful!
Faithful...
Nolly, have two men cover this area.
Come on, move it. Let's go.
That's it, that's it.
Don't touch that.
Nolly, get me an envelope!
He always wears a black suit.
Who?
Straker.
Inspector.
How nice of you to drop in.
Plain old constable.
I see you're just about ready to open.
Not quite. Just about.
Everything in?
Everything that's important, yes.
Coffee? Tea?
A glass of sherry, perhaps?
No, thanks.
Never drink on duty?
You are on duty?
I'm always on duty.
Hmm, that makes me feel safe and snug.
Mr. Barlow arrived yet?
Mr. Barlow is in New York.
Coming soon?
Hard to tell. He may go to Europe on a buying trip.
So, you'll be opening without him.
If necessary, yes, of course.
What's Mr. Barlow's first name, by the way?
Official question?
No, just curious.
My partner's full name is Kurt Barlow.
Kurt with a K.
We've been working together in London and Hamburg. This is our retirement.
Modest, comfortable.
We're hoping to build a reputation for ourselves in this area, perhaps throughout New England.
You think that's possible, Constable?
Anything's possible.
- How do you like that old house?
- Needs work.
But we have time.
Not bothered by yowens?
Yowens?
Kids. Local word.
You know how kids like to devil new folks.
Oh, no. No children. No.
We seem to have misplaced one.
Is that so?
Yes. Yes, it is so.
The thinking now is that we may not find him. Not alive.
Oh, that's a shame.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
I don't suppose so.
By the way, what happened to your black suit?
- My black suit?
- The one that I always see you wear.
I have two black suits.
They're up at the house.
- Am I breaking some town ordinance?
- No.
I'd like to see those suits.
Could we go to the house and get them?
I'll bring them down tomorrow.
They need cleaning anyway.
Any reason?
Some.
Bye.
Ciao, Constable.
- Ciao?
- Ciao.
That's a familiar Italian expression meaning goodbye.
- I didn't know you were Italian.
- I'm not. The word is.
Well, you learn something new every day.
Mmm-hmm.
No, no. It's not a kidnap.
The boy is missing.
Probable foul play.
Yeah, I'd like to check out a couple of feelers.
First is a Benjamin Mears.
Uh, M-E-A-R-S.
Writer.
Yeah, the book's called Air Dance.
And the other one is Conway's Daughter.
What?
No, I haven't read them.
Don't know if many have.
Yeah, the other two are sort of stapled together.
There's a Richard K. Straker.
No, I don't know what that stands for.
And Kurt, with a K, Barlow.
S-T-R-A-K-E-R.
And B-A-R-L-O-W.
Yeah.
Any, uh, any connection between Mears and the others?
That's one of the things I wanna find out.
I understand what you're saying, Ben.
I'm not given to unscientific belief, but I will admit that there are a great many things that science hasn't as yet answered.
If ever.
But, I can't, for the life of me, understand any connection between Larry Crockett's death and the Marsten House.
He rented the house to them.
- But he died of a heart attack.
- You're sure of that?
Absolutely.
The autopsy left no doubt whatsoever, none.
It could've happened at the Marsten House and he was taken to the lake.
Yes, well, it...
Let me tell you, the local gossip leans in a different direction.
All right, what about the Glick boys?
That could be something else.
What is wrong with Danny Glick?
We haven't completed our tests yet.
But, it could be...
And I'm trusting you to keep this to yourself.
It could be pernicious anemia.
Coming on overnight?
We don't know how sudden it is.
- You don't really believe that?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- We're going to the movies in Bangor.
Uh, Ben, could I say something to you?
- Don't make it too long, Dad, okay?
- Sure.
Now, everybody knows that you and Susan were up at the lake.
Yeah... Look, I want you to know...
Now, you seem like a pretty nice fella to me.
And I think you respect Susan, and I believe she respects herself.
But you could've been a little more discreet, right?
Yeah.
When may I expect them back?
A couple of days.
No more than that, please.
I'll try.
I don't have to do this, you know.
I understand.
Appreciate it.
I'm under some suspicion?
Well, yes.
The disappearance of the boy.
Yes.
Because I'm a stranger.
- Guess so.
- And a little odd.
You know how we are here.
Ah, no different from people in small towns all over the world.
I appreciate your candor.
Am I being charged?
No, but I'd like you to stay around.
I fully intend to.
Now, the suits...
Don't forget.
As soon as, um, crime lab...
FBI. In Bangor.
A-ha.
And, no damage, please.
I want them back in excellent condition.
And, um, cleaned.
I'll see to it.
Ciao. That's Italian for...
I remember.
Goodbye, Constable.
- You playing hooky?
- No.
This is my hour break of which exactly 26 minutes is left.
Just wanted to say hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Mmm.
My father asked you to be discreet.
- Well, I didn't tell you that.
- No, he did.
Then he told me to go ahead and show my feelings.
Yeah, well, the man contradicts himself.
Well, Dad's a New Englander.
He's been taught one thing and feels another.
Classic conflict.
I have one, too.
I got a phone call this morning.
Ned?
Not that easy.
From Boston. Job interview.
They saw my portfolio.
- Oh!
- It'll only be for two days.
Hmm.
Oh, no, thanks. No, thanks.
So, it's off to Boston?
It's not that far.
Uh...
- When do you leave?
- Tomorrow, after class.
Can you come with me?
Uh, Danny Glick's funeral's tomorrow.
I wanna stay for that.
- Why? You weren't...
- I just need to be there.
I wish you weren't going.
Me too.
I have to.
- Where are you staying?
- With a friend. Girlfriend.
- I'll give you the number if you like.
- Yeah, okay.
You know, it's only an interview.
If I got the job, I wouldn't have to start till the end of June sometime.
That's not so bad, is it?
Well, I guess it'll have to do.
Let us pray.
"Lord God, through your mercy,
"may those who have lived in faith find eternal peace.
"Bless this grave and send your angel to watch over it.
"As we bury the body of Danny Glick, welcome him into your presence
"and with your saints, let him rejoice in your presence forever.
"We ask it through Christ our Lord. Amen."
Amen.
"With faith in Jesus Christ,
"we reverently bring the body of this child
"to be buried in its human imperfection."
"Let us...
Have plans for tonight?
More or less. Susan's gone to Boston.
I heard.
Hope she gets it.
Do you?
Well, whatever's best.
Should I believe that?
Not entirely, but that's what I want to feel.
Royal?
Royal?
Everything's all right.
I'm glad I stayed.
How about the job?
Tomorrow?
So, uh...
So when are you coming home?
Friday.
Well, there's really not much point, is there?
No. Tonight, I'm having dinner with Jason Burke.
No, Jason. Just Jason and me.
Yeah.
I miss you, too.
Yeah.
Ben.
Ned Tebbets was around here today fixing a toilet, and threatening to fix you.
- Hey...
- I just thought I'd tell you.
You're a nice guy.
I'd hate to see you get all busted up.
Thanks.
Do you think it's affected him?
Well, you have talks with him.
Yes, but still, you never know.
He doesn't show it much.
I wonder why.
He's got to be feeling something.
I mean, after all, the Glick boys were on their way home from seeing him.
Did you look at him at the funeral?
He keeps his feelings in hand.
I don't want him going in the woods anymore.
I'll go up and see him.
How are you, son?
Fine, Dad.
Finished your homework?
Long time ago.
Can you get out of these?
Easy. Put them on me.
Go ahead.
Let's see. Where's the key?
Oh, I don't need it.
- Not too tight?
- I want it tight.
Okay?
There.
What do you know?
- Here, want to tie me up?
- No, I don't think so.
I can get out of any knot. You can try me.
Hands behind the back.
Some other time, son.
You know, sometimes I wonder, you know, why you're so interested in monsters and magic and...
Why do you think that is, Mark?
I always have been.
I can't explain it. It's the way I am.
Mmm.
Like, you were interested in numbers, so you became an accountant.
At least I can earn a living.
I'll earn a living.
Okay.
That's it?
Thanks. Hey, wait.
Uh...
Hi. Just had FBI Boston on the phone.
Rundown on Ben Mears, Straker and Barlow.
What'd they say?
Straker is British by birth,
58 years old.
Applied extended visa 18 months ago.
No criminal record at all.
Barlow?
Born, Germany.
Left in '20s, before Hitler.
Naturalized British.
Changed his name from Breichen.
- Anything else?
- Oh, yeah, thanks.
Uh, been in the import-export business with Straker since 1943.
He travels alone but seems to keep to himself.
Straker's the one who stays in front.
- He shown up yet?
- Barlow?
- Yeah.
- No.
What about Mears?
Mmm.
- Mears.
- Yes.
He was born here in Salem's Lot.
Left at the age of 10.
His wife died in an automobile accident two years ago.
He's a left-winger.
Against nuclear power, stuff like that.
No record?
Hmm. Travels a lot. There's no, uh...
No connection between Mears and the other two?
Wouldn't seem so.
Then why's he so interested in the Marsten House?
And why did they buy it?
There's a connection.
There's a connection, I'm telling you.
- Jason.
- Well...
- Well, how's the book coming?
- Oh, hard.
Tough way to make a living, huh?
Well, it's not much of a living, but it's the only way I know.
The Marsten House still center of the story?
Yep.
What about the Glick boys?
- Thank you.
- You connect them with the house?
Everything in Salem's Lot is connected with that house.
You can see it from every part of the town.
It's like a beacon throwing off an energy force.
Mike.
Hello, Mr. Burke.
Mike, are you on something?
- No.
- Drugs?
Sick. I feel sick.
Since when?
Hmm?
First, I found my dog dead.
Then there was the funeral yesterday.
I fell asleep on Harmony Hill.
Didn't wake up till morning.
This was after Danny Glick's funeral?
Yeah.
I went back to finish. Royal wasn't there.
I started to feel sick. Can I have a drink?
Miss. Whiskey.
What do you remember, Mike?
- Singing.
- Singing?
Sweet.
Sweetest singing I ever heard.
A feeling like drowning.
And eyes.
- Eyes.
- Whose eyes?
Bright and...
Scary.
- Whose?
- Don't remember.
I dreamed.
You slept there all night?
Yeah, all night.
What about last night?
I remember a dream.
Somebody out there.
And I...
I let him in.
Who?
- I don't know.
- Listen to me, Mike.
Mike. Mike, I want you to stay at my house tonight.
Will you do that for me?
We'll arrange to see Dr. Norton tomorrow.
All right. I don't care.
Open the window.
Open the window, Mark.
Open the window, Mark. Please.
Let me in.
It's okay, Mark, I'm your friend.
He commands it.
No, Mark.
Go away.
Go away!
Son, are you awake?
Yeah, kind of.
Did you have a bad dream?
I... Maybe.
I don't remember.
You called out in your sleep.
I'm sorry.
Do you want anything?
No.
Good night then.
Good night, Dad.
Come in.
I hope these will be all right.
Mike?
Turn your head, Mike.
This way.
Where did you get these marks?
I don't know.
Now, call me in the night if you want anything.
Anything. Even if you have a bad dream.
Will you be sure to do that?
Yes.
Now, anything. I mean it.
I'll be right down the hall.
I will.
Mr. Mears, telephone.
Telephone.
Oh, oh. Uh, uh...
All right. Just a minute. Just a minute.
What is it, long distance?
No, it's Jason Burke.
Oh. What time... what time is it?
It's a little after 4:00, and Mr. Burke sounds very upset.
Oh, oh, uh...
Yeah, Jason?
What's the matter?
Um.
Well, give me about 10 minutes.
Well, hell no. I'm a... I was a Baptist.
Jason.
Do you have, uh, uh, a rosary or a crucifix?
Yeah, in my bedroom.
Mr. Berk asked for it?
- Yes, please.
- Well, he's not Catholic.
- I don't even think he goes to church.
- Please.
He's all right, Jason. He's sleeping.
The window's open.
It was closed and locked.
I made sure of it.
Sun's coming up.
Look.
It's blood.
A single drop.
Mike. Mike, wake up.
There's no pulse.
Marks on the neck?
No. Nothing, nothing.
No marks. Nothing.
- You think I'm crazy?
- No.
- Do you believe me about the marks?
- I guess I'll have to.
But where does that put us, Jason?
It puts us in the position where we have to do something.
Could he have died of a virus or something?
Well, Ben, the window, the marks on his neck, and I heard him invite someone into the room and...
Oh, that terrible laughter.
All right.
Do you know what will happen to you if we whisper a word of what you've just told me?
Right. "Funny old duck living alone on Taggot Stream Road.
"How can we trust him to teach our children?"
I can't help you, Jason.
I saw a body, nothing else.
And I'm an outsider, a writer, a crazy.
But if we do nothing...
There is something we can do.
We can check this all out.
Call Dr. Norton. Call the constable.
Yeah. Let the machinery take over.
Don't even tell Dr. Norton he's dead.
- Not dead?
- Well, how do we know he is?
Let the medical people check it out.
Let them find the cause of death.
All the times Mike drove that, not guessing how soon he'd be riding in the back.
Mears, I want you to testify for the coroner's jury.
- I'll be there.
- That's good.
Got to do my paperwork.
Duplicate, triplicate.
Don't punch, spindle or mutilate.
We all have to do that, don't we?
Yeah, and they say it's a free country.
Uh, Jason.
What is it you wanted to tell me?
Have there been any other people complaining of feeling weak? Uh...
- Well, had bad dreams?
- No.
There soon will be.
Bill, do you believe in ghosts?
Ghosts? No.
- Witches? Wizards?
- No.
- Werewolves?
- Of course not.
Vampires?
Bill, come on inside.
I'm going to tell you something.
And I'm going to ask your help.
And maybe you'll give it, if you don't decide I'm absolutely crazy.
Good morning, Eva.
I heard.
Awful.
Poor Mike.
I'm tired.
I'll just have a cup of coffee and get some sleep.
Why in the world did Mr. Burke want that crucifix?
Maybe because he thought
Mike Ryerson was Catholic.
He should've known better than that.
He had Mike in school.
All his people were Lutherans.
Well, it looks like you're gonna miss the opening.
- What opening?
- Those antique fellas.
- Straker?
- Uh, him and the other fella.
Did that other fella ever show up?
I don't know about that. All I know is they're opening the store today.
Wouldn't Dad like this?
Huh? Uh,
I guess so.
Oh, Mr. Straker.
Uh, my husband's birthday is next week, and I...
Oh, dear.
It's quite reasonable, you know.
There's no chance that...
I'm sorry, but...
I understand.
I could hold it for you till the end of the week without any obligation.
Oh, I'd appreciate that. Thank you.
Done.
An English desk here, 18th century.
Values continue to escalate.
Interesting little Welsh cupboard in oak.
And my favorite chair. It was with me in London in my establishment.
English.
Georgian.
Oh!
You have some expertise.
No, not really.
I just know something about silver.
My aunt had some Georgian.
We had to sell it when she died.
Oh. What an unfortunate way to acquire knowledge.
My aunt was housekeeper at the Marsten House, your house.
Oh, really? That's interesting.
I've always been curious about that place.
Perhaps I can satisfy your curiosity.
A lot of peculiar things have happened in that house.
Mmm-hmm.
The story goes that the man who built it murdered his wife and a servant.
And though it was never proved, he was suspected in the disappearance of several children.
Yes, it was terrible, wasn't it?
Interesting.
Remarkable, yes.
- Mr. Straker.
- Yes?
Do you believe that evil can be inherent in a house?
About as much as I believe that trees have souls.
Well, perhaps they do.
Oh, you're the writer.
On vacation or vocation?
I am writing about the Marsten House.
Ah!
And you'd like to visit.
Well, why not?
Mr. Barlow is on a buying trip, but the moment he arrives.
You'll enjoy Mr. Barlow.
And he'll enjoy you.
You snake.
Try to steal my girl.
Pretty good beating you took, fella.
No fractures, though. Slight concussion.
You understand me?
- Yes.
- Good.
We're gonna keep you here overnight anyway, for observation, all right?
Mmm. Yes.
Your friend Ned, he was arrested.
He's sitting in the town jail.
I don't think he's gonna be that foolish again.
Anyone else sick? Hospital?
Couple of new admissions, but nothing, uh...
- No.
- What Jason and I told you...
Ben, it's out of the question.
I don't believe it, and no one else will.
You just take it easy, all right?
I want a crucifix.
All right. If it'll make you feel better,
I suppose we can arrange it.
Look at me.
Look at me, teacher.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Look.
No.
Look.
Look.
No.
No.
Get out.
Get out. I revoke my invitation.
You will sleep like the dead, teacher.
No.
Marge?
Marjorie?
Marjorie?
Marge.
Margie? Marjorie?
Honey?
Marge.
Marge. Marge.
What is it? What are you saying?
- What?
- What?
- Marge, I'm gonna call a doctor.
- No!
- You sure?
- I'm okay.
- Honey, I want Dr. Norton to see you.
- No.
- Marge.
- I'm weak.
- Weak.
- You haven't been sleeping ever since...
Oh.
- I've been dreaming about him.
- Sure.
- About Danny.
- That's natural. It's all right.
He comes back, and he says, "Mommy, Mommy,
I'm so glad to be home."
He says he's my baby.
My baby.
Hi.
Dad called me.
Oh, oh.
It was, uh, just a little knock.
Uh, I know you're okay.
There's more, Ben.
Ned Tebbets died last night.
What?
They found him dead this morning in town jail.
Dad examined him.
Pernicious anemia.
- Just like the Glick boy.
- Yes, only Ned had high blood pressure.
And Danny's mother died this afternoon.
- Same symptoms?
- I think so.
- What did your father say?
- He wants to talk to you.
- And Jason Burke.
- Jason Burke?
- He's here, Ben.
- Here?
In the hospital. Intensive care.
- What?
- Heart attack.
He's stable.
Susan.
You've got to go back to Boston.
There's a kind of plague in this town, people are dying.
Don't you understand what's happening?
- Do you?
- I do.
It's in the Marsten House.
It's got to be rooted out.
It's got to be destroyed.
Do you know the priest at St. Jude's?
- Father Callahan?
- Father Callahan.
But I am an agent of the Holy Catholic Church.
You see, the overall concept of evil in the Catholic Church has undergone a radical change in this century.
- Evil with a small "E."
- Satan with a small tail.
- Witches, incubi?
- Vampires?
In Salem's Lot.
Haven't you noticed anything out of the way, peculiar?
Well, the Malloys weren't at Mass this morning.
Mrs. Malloy never misses.
Mrs. Glick...
But she'd suffered a terrible blow.
Ned Tebbets.
Mike Ryerson.
- He's gonna do it.
- Well, at least we'll know then.
We'll have the medical evidence.
Now, now, listen to me.
- You have to get some hawthorn.
- Okay.
Okay, and...
- And just put it all over the house.
- Okay.
And the crucifixes from Father Callahan...
- Mother's never going to...
- She has to!
They're breeding on one another.
The vampires are creating vampires.
It's a geometric progression.
Two times two, times four, times eight.
- This is just...
- In another couple...
Ben.
Ned Tebbets' body has disappeared from the morgue, and a baby that died this morning is gone.
Marjorie Glick?
She's in the funeral parlor in Cumberland.
I'll get my car.
Hawthorn.
I think a lot of this comes from Mark's hobby, collecting masks, uh, assembling monsters from kits.
He's always been preoccupied with them, and it's not healthy.
Let's not make those judgments now.
Mark, you're sure it wasn't a dream?
It wasn't a dream.
It was Danny Glick.
Nightmares seem real.
His subconscious fear made Danny seem real to him.
And they were very close friends.
I'll get it.
Poor little boy.
You can do nothing against the master.
Stop, holy man.
Or he'll cut the boy's throat.
Back. Back, holy man. Back, shaman.
Back, priest.
What would you give for this miserable boy?
What do you ask?
What would you give to reprieve him this night, to save him for another night?
- What do you want?
- The master wants you.
Throw away your cross, face the master.
Your faith against his faith.
Could you do that?
Is your faith enough?
Then do it.
And trust him to let the boy go?
Run.
I think they're dead, Father.
Run.
I'm going to kill you.
Now, your part of the bargain.
- I'm a priest.
- A priest?
Throw away the cross.
Face the master.
Faith against faith.
What do you think?
Her condition is very similar to Mike Ryerson's.
There's no surface lividity, no signs of rigor.
I'm gonna call home, make sure they're all right.
They'll be fine if they follow instructions.
I'll make sure they do.
Bless this cross.
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.
No atheists in foxholes.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me...
He maketh me to lie down beside still waters.
He maketh me to lie down.
He maketh me...
He maketh me to lie down in green pasture.
He restoreth my soul.
Bill.
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake.
Bill!
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil.
Bill!
I will fear no evil.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Danny.
Where are you, Danny, darling?
Bill! Bill! Bill!
- Ben, they're...
- Don't look at her eyes.
Oh, God.
I called a friend of mine in San Francisco.
He's, uh, he's turned on to the occult.
He says that, uh, we have to get to Barlow during the day.
Before sunset.
In his coffin.
And drive a stake through his heart.
What about Straker?
Straker's human. He's mortal. He's...
He's, uh... He's the watchdog, he...
He's the thing's bodyguard.
He prepares the way.
How can he be killed?
Any way. Any way at all. Gun, knife.
Any way at all.
- Why did they come here?
- How the hell do I know?
Because you're somewhat isolated, you're somewhat inbred. Full-blooded.
Barlow must have wandered this planet for centuries, looking for new places to victimize.
It's unbelievable.
I've seen it.
Still, Ben, it's unbelievable.
Good girl.
- Where's your mother?
- She's up in your room.
- She's all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.
What happened?
Marjorie Glick rose and joined the undead.
- The undead?
- She's a vampire, too.
Soon, this whole town of Salem's Lot.
Susan, you're gonna have to leave town.
Mother and Dad?
Your father's gonna stay and help me destroy this creature.
Now, tomorrow before sunset, you take your mother and anyone else that you can persuade to go, and you leave town.
Where's Gillespie?
Parkins called in sick.
It's the first day he's been off the job. Ever.
Are you... You feeling all right?
A little tired.
I didn't sleep much last night.
I was dreaming.
Funny.
I dreamed about Ned coming to see me.
It was a funny dream.
He may have gone into town.
You look pale. Are you all right?
Just tired.
I... I dreamed all night.
All night.
Sweet, sweet dreams.
Weasel.
Young.
Just like old times.
Kissing me on my neck.
Oh, Weasel.
Maybe you better go lie down.
Yes, I will.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark?
Susan.
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you in.
Let's get out of here.
He killed my parents.
You can't do it.
My father and Ben... Listen.
Please.
- You go.
- Only if you do.
I can't.
We'll come back with my father and Ben.
They'll help us. We need help.
What's that?
He's here.
Come.
That will hold you till tonight.
What will happen tonight?
Yes.
What have you done with Susan?
Ah...
What did you do to her?
I've taken her to where she wished to go.
To meet the man she came here to meet.
- Where are you going?
- South Carolina, visit relatives.
You can't do that. He's up there.
He's in the house.
- Who?
- Barlow. Barlow!
He's a vampire. He's got to be destroyed.
What the hell's so funny?
You're crazy.
There aren't any such things as vampires.
Well, then, what do you say is happening here?
- Something is happening here.
- I don't know. Some kind of craziness.
- You're scared.
- Whatever it is, I'm not staying.
- You're the constable here.
- Was.
- Running!
- Running, running!
And you're staying?
You're staying.
All right, since you're staying, come here.
Come here, will you?
Here. Here.
Maybe this will do you some good.
Coming!
This town's falling apart and you're running?
Gillespie is leaving town.
Have you seen Susan?
- They should be gone by now.
- No.
Ann's still waiting for her at home.
- Father Callahan in there?
- No one's there.
- Is it blessed?
- It is holy water.
Ben?
Ben, Susan's in there!
Mark.
- They're in there.
- Where?
I don't know.
- You run. You run as fast as you can.
- No.
- Keep running!
- No.
Ben.
I told you to go.
- No.
- Run!
No!
Help me!
No, please! Ahh!
Ben.
Bill.
Bill!
It's getting dark.
The cellar.
Wait.
Mark, wait.
Mark, wait.
Mark!
Mark?
Mark.
- I'm all right.
- Easy.
- It's just the ankle.
- Can you stand?
Yeah.
He's here.
I know he's here somewhere.
Yeah. Here.
It's the root cellar.
We have to get him out of here.
Must weigh a ton.
We have to get him out of here.
Push!
The sun's gone down.
- He...
- Don't look at him!
Mark.
Get out.
Susan?
Sorry, Susan. Forgive me.
The wind.
It's blowing towards town.
Susan.
The town will burn.
It will drive them out of their hiding places.
All of them?
No.
It will purify Salem's Lot.
And the others will be on the run.
And on the hunt.
For us?
For us.
They found us again.
Another one has found us.
We have to go further.
Not yet.
Ben?
I found you.
I know.
I love you.
Yes.
You were so difficult to find.
I know.
But we're together now.
We'll always be together.
We'll always be young.
We'll love each other.
Forever. That is his promise.
Forever?
Forever.
Kiss me, Ben.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
There'll be others.
Do we go now?
When I was a lad, a journey down the rivers of England was a truly blithe experience.
"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive," as Wordsworth has it.
Brooklime and flag iris, plantain and marsh marigolds rioted on the banks.
And kingfishers swooped and darted about, their shadows racing over the brown trout.
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm happy to be able to tell you that these ravishing sights will be restored to us again in the near future, thanks to the diligent efforts of your government and your local authority.
All the water above this point will soon be clear.
Clear of industrial effluent.
Clear of detergents.
Clear of the waste products of our society, with which for so long we have poisoned our rivers and canals.
Let us rejoice that pollution will soon be banished from the waters of this river, and that there will soon be no foreign...
Look!
What is it?
It's a woman!
What's that
'round her neck?
She's been strangled!
Looks like a tie.
Yes, it's a tie, all right.
Another necktie murder.
Come on.
Move out of the way.
Please come away from here, Sir George.
It's another necktie murder.
What are the police doing about it?
That's what I'd like to know.
Why can't they find him?
He's a regular
Jack the Ripper.
Not on your life.
He used to carve 'em up.
Sent a bird's kidney to Scotland Yard once, wrapped in a bit of violet writing paper.
That'll do, Herb.
I'm quite sure the lady doesn't want to hear any more about it.
Or was it a bit of a liver?
I say, it's not my club tie, is it?
Cheers,
Squadron Leader.
Chin chin.
Good morning.
Look, it may come as something of a surprise to you, Blaney, but in this pub we sell liquor, we don't give it away.
Still less do we expect our employees to steal it.
I was going to pay for it.
Oh, yeah,
I'm sure you were.
Well, that's the last drink you're gettin' on this house. Go on. Get out.
I told you I was going to pay for it.
I always pay for my drinks.
Even for your watered-down gin.
Now, don't come the innocent with me, you bastard!
My stocks have been well down this past month.
Now, you watch what you're saying!
What, to a thief?
What's going on?
Our friend here says that
I've been pinching his booze.
Ridiculous!
He always pays.
- How would you know?
- Well, I work with him, don't I?
And what else?
What's that supposed to mean?
Look, just keep out of this, will you,
Babs? Come on, Blaney, outside.
- You're fired.
- You can't do that.
He never stole nothing in his life.
He puts the money in the till.
I've seen him.
A thief or a boozer, it's all the same to me.
I don't need either one as a barman, quite apart from the fact that half the time he's pulling your tits instead of pulling pints.
- Now, look here...
- He can't keep his hands off you.
The customers are always talking about it.
And what about you?
Always fingering me.
You keep your lying mouth shut,
Babs, or you can get out as well.
I'm off.
Keep the change!
I'll send for my things later.
Just a minute!
There's a little matter of £10
I advanced you on your salary.
Are you planning to steal that as well?
There you are. You know what to do with them.
You shouldn't let him talk to you like that.
I know.
What are you gonna do, love?
I don't know.
Another pub perhaps.
Are you all right?
You just gave him back the 10 quid you borrowed.
I had to.
He didn't think I had it.
Don't worry,
I've got a bit left.
Well, this is Covent Garden, not the garden of love.
How 'bout starting work?
Oh, get stuffed.
Look after yourself.
I'll call you.
Thanks, guv.
- Hello, Dick.
- Hello, Bob.
I was just coming over for a quick one.
Why aren't you back there polishing the sausages or watering the gin, or whatever it is you do there before opening time?
I have just been given the push.
What for?
You weren't pissing in the beer again?
Forsythe and I had a set-to.
Oh, him.
You duffed him up, I hope.
He's a bastard.
He was on my back right from the start.
From squadron leader to barman in one easy lesson!
He wouldn't leave it alone.
He's the boss' brother-in-law, isn't he?
- Forsythe?
- Yeah, I think so.
Brother-in-laws are the worst.
Or should I say,
"Brothers-in-law"?
What are you gonna do now?
I haven't decided yet.
Well, if you're in schtuk, you know where to come.
Thanks.
George!
That's the last one.
Thanks, Mr. Rusk.
Why don't you go and have a chat with your ex?
She's doin' all right, isn't she?
I haven't seen her for ages, as you know.
There's no use opening all that up again.
No, I suppose not.
Well, as I say, you can always rely on me.
You're all right for a few quid?
Yes. Thanks all the same.
'Cause if you're not...
No, no. Really.
I just got paid.
Well...
Have some grapes.
Here you are.
I'll get you a box.
Finest muscats, fresh in this morning.
Here you are. Take one of these back to your girlfriend, Babs.
Get her to peel you one.
"Beulah, peel me a grape."
That's what my ol' mum used to say when I was a kid.
Well, at least you won't starve to death.
Are you sure you don't need a few bob?
No, I'm okay.
Well, you don't look okay.
Anything else the matter?
No. What should be?
I don't know.
Well, remember, anything I can do, anytime, it's a pleasure.
Ta.
It won't be the same in the Old Globe now.
Well, Babs is still there.
Yeah, that's true.
And she's prettier than you.
A matter of opinion.
Bye, now.
Hey, wait a minute.
Here, give us your paper.
Here you are. This will make you a fortune.
This afternoon in the 3:00,
Coming Up.
Never been out before, but very well-fancied at home.
Now, this is a four-horse race, and the other three have all won before.
So she'll start about
20-to-1, maybe more.
20-to-1?
Put your word on it.
She can't lose.
A little birdie told me, and my little birdies are reliable.
Well, thanks again, Bob.
Anytime.
Don't forget,
Bob's your uncle.
Good morning, Mr. Rusk.
Hello, Sergeant.
What's new?
Not much.
This necktie fellow's giving them a bit of a headache, though.
Can't seem to get a line on him.
Have you tried advertising?
Oh, very funny.
Look, you're one for the birds.
Ask 'em all if they've ever had a near miss with a bloke like that, would you?
Or if any of their girlfriends have.
Sure.
Mind you, half of them haven't got their heads screwed on right, let alone knowing when they've been screwed off.
Have you met my friend Dick B...
Funny fella.
Well, don't worry, Sergeant.
I'll put the word about.
Thanks, Mr. Rusk.
A large brandy.
What're you gonna have, Doctor?
A pint and a morsel of cheese'll do me fine.
Let me order us a hot lunch.
We have plenty of time.
Hello, Mr. Usher.
What's good today, Maisie?
Stick to the shepherd's.
I would.
Right. That's two shepherd's pies, then, please.
And two pints.
I see our necktie murderer's been up to it again.
I saw the newspaper headlines as we came away from the court.
Hmm.
I wouldn't envy the lot of any medical man giving evidence at that trial.
Why not?
Why, surely it's easier in these days of legally diminished responsibility.
In many cases you may be right.
But not here.
The man who's killing these women is a criminal, sexual psychopath.
And the legal profession has never really known how to treat them.
I suppose you could call them social misfits.
We were just talking about the tie murderer, Maisie.
You better watch out.
He rapes 'em first, doesn't he?
Yes, I believe he does.
Well, I suppose it's nice to know that every cloud has a silver lining.
Oh.
On the surface, in casual conversation, they appear as ordinary, likable adult fellows.
But emotionally they remain as dangerous children, whose conduct may revert to a primitive, subhuman level at any moment.
Large brandy.
You mean they'll kill at any time, just as the mood takes them?
Exactly.
And, being governed by the pleasure principle, they're particularly dangerous when their desires are being frustrated.
Are you deaf? I distinctly said a large brandy.
There's scarcely enough in that to cover the bottom.
Actually, you can make it a triple.
I wonder if the police have got any sort of line on this fellow.
Oh, I shouldn't think so.
With psychopaths there's usually no linking motive.
Let's hope he slips up soon.
In one way,
I rather hope he doesn't.
Well, we haven't had a good, juicy series of sex murders since Christie.
And they're so good for the tourist trade.
Foreigners somehow expect the squares of London to be fog-wreathed, full of hansom cabs and littered with ripped whores, don't you think?
Hey, Dick!
What about
Coming Up then?
No, I'm afraid I haven't any time.
Thanks all the same.
No, Coming Up, the horse.
It won by a mile.
20-to-1!
What did I tell you?
Made a fortune.
Thanks a lot.
Anytime.
Hey, wait a minute!
This is my ma.
Ma, meet Dick Blaney, the best pilot who ever pulled a pint of beer.
Hello, Mrs. Rusk.
Pleased to meet you,
I'm sure.
She lives down in Kent, in the Garden of England!
Still got the grapes then?
Oh, yeah. Keep 'em for later.
You tell her to take the pips out.
They're bad for the appendix.
Ta-ta.
Bye. Thanks again for the tip.
I told you,
Bob's your uncle.
20-to-1!
20-to-bloody-1!
Christ! Damn it to hell!
Well, my dears,
I'm sure I can say on behalf of
Mrs. Blaney as well as myself, that it's moments like this that make all our little efforts here so worthwhile.
You mean, you just don't do it for the money?
Of course, Mrs. Davisson, this is a business, and financial considerations prevail.
But our ultimate satisfaction is the making happy of two lonely people.
Nice of you, Miss Barling.
Keep up the good work!
Well, it's up to us now,
I guess, eh?
Yeah. And good-bye,
Mr. Salt.
Bye, Miss Barling.
Thank you.
It's been our pleasure. And I know you'll both be very happy.
After all, I know you're both mad about beekeeping.
And there's nothing like a shared interest.
I'm sure we will be. Come on, Neville.
Best foot forward.
I suppose we should go straight and get the marriage license, my dear.
What's your rush?
Let's go to my place first.
Did you know, Neville, that my late husband, Mr. Davisson, was up at 5:30 every morning of his life?
And by the time he brought me my cup of tea, which he did punctually at 9: 15, he would've cleaned the whole house, and he was so quiet about it, that in 14 years, he never woke me once.
Not once!
Oh, a neat man, was he, then?
He liked a tidy place.
So do I, come to that.
Dandruff. We'll have to get you something for that.
Afternoon.
You're new here, aren't you?
I've been here for over a year now.
What can I do for you, sir?
You can inform Mrs. Blaney that one of her less successful exercises in matrimony has come to see her.
And who shall
I say is calling?
Mr. Blaney.
Or if you preferred it, ex-Squadron Leader Blaney, late of the RAF and
Mrs. Blaney's matrimonial bed.
I see. Is Mrs. Blaney expecting you?
She must be.
Everybody expects a bad penny to turn up sooner or later.
Mrs. Blaney, there's a
Mr. Blaney to see you.
Mr. Blaney? Send him in, will you please, Monica?
Hello, Brenda.
Hello, Richard.
What are you doing here?
I just thought
I'd call around.
Well, come in.
Take a seat.
Thanks.
It's good to see you.
You too. You look fine.
I'll be with you in a minute. I've got to finish writing up a few notes.
How is everything then, Brenda?
You making a fortune?
Things are going very well.
Streets of London thronged with lonely hearts beating a path to your door?
That's it.
I'm amazed that in an age where practically everybody considers marriage is hell that you can find any clients.
Okay, Richard, if you've just come around here to insult me,
I think, perhaps you...
I'm not insulting you, for Christ's sake!
Will you please lower your voice.
Why?
I don't care if Vinegar Joe out there does hear me.
Why don't you get her married off, by the way?
Preferably to a 700-pound
Japanese wrestler.
That should iron out some of her creases a little.
Monica, dear, it's nearly 4:30.
Why don't you take the rest of the afternoon off?
I'm sure there's some shopping you'd like to do.
Well, thank you, Mrs. Blaney, if you're sure you don't need me.
I'm quite sure, thank you.
Good night.
Why do you always come to see me when you've had too much to drink?
I don't always come to see you when I've had too much to drink.
As a matter of fact, I don't always come to see you.
I haven't seen you for over a year.
You were half seas over then, and violent.
I do hope we're not going to have a repeat of that.
Me violent?
Don't be bloody ridiculous.
Would I raise a hand to the goddess of love?
What Brenda Blaney brings together let no man put asunder!
I didn't say you were violent to me.
But you certainly acted the fool and threw the furniture about a bit.
Just look at the state you're in.
Really!
Oh, leave me alone.
Bachelors are supposed to be untidy, aren't they?
I thought tidiness was most women's dowry, or don't you preach that here?
Oh, we are bitter today.
What's the matter?
I'm sorry.
I had a bad day, that's all.
I lost my job.
How?
Well, I got fired, that's how.
What do you think,
I mislaid it?
For pinching a glass of brandy.
My employer thought I wasn't going to put the money in the till.
Till?
I was working, until this morning that is, as a barman.
And another thing. I was given a very good horse by a great friend of mine, one Bob Rusk.
And it came in at 20-to-1, and I didn't have enough cash on me to back it.
I'm sorry.
Well, these things always go in threes.
I wonder what the rest of the day has in store.
Dinner with me, I hope.
Well, that, of course, would be delightful, but...
I mean, of course, on me.
We'll go to my club.
But I must finish these letters first.
Here's the address, in case you've forgotten it.
How will it be if we meet there 'round about 7:30?
Fine.
Thanks for a lovely evening.
It was great. I mean that.
Thanks for joining me.
It was a damn sight better than the leftovers at the Globe, not that I'm in for any more of those, of course.
You ought to get married again, Richard.
Oh, no.
You ought to know I'm no good at it.
How long did we have?
Nine years, was it?
- Ten.
- Ah.
Ten years.
It was a good job you got out when you did.
I don't know.
I suppose I was lucky the agency worked out for me.
What you mean is, that you're lucky you haven't had to rely on me these past two years.
I didn't say that.
But you meant it.
Look, Richard,
I suppose some people are good at organization and others aren't.
That's all I meant.
And I'm not, I suppose.
Rubbish! You know what filthy luck I had.
Was it my fault that the roadhouse didn't go?
It was going fine
- till they opened the bloody motorway.
- I know.
Was it my fault the council tore down the riding stables?
I know. I know life can be very unfair.
But you never used to be sorry for yourself.
Where's the Richard Blaney
I married?
Richard Blaney, EFC. Do you remember the citation?
"For inspiring leadership, skill, and tenacity of purpose."
You divorced him.
That's what happened to him.
Now, you tell me, what sort of skill do you need to deal with shopkeepers and interfering bureaucrats?
Everyone's listening.
Well, let them.
I'll bet they've never had to tear down their own livelihood with their own hands.
It's all right for you.
You just go and build it up somewhere else.
You're like that.
You're good at business.
I'll bet they're all good at business here.
I'll bet you're making a fortune out of that agency.
And why not? If you can't make love, sell it.
The respectable kind, of course.
The married kind!
Now look what you've done.
Oh, sir.
Let me help you.
Leave me alone!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Come on. We'd better go.
Will you be all right?
You did say you hadn't enough money to put on that horse.
Don't worry. You've done enough for one day.
You had a coat too, didn't you?
Yeah. That one there.
Mine's the pink one.
No, no, no.
That's not allowed.
Rules of the club.
Thank you.
It's all right, Richard. I've got it.
Here. Thank you.
So, this is it, huh?
Can I come in?
I'd like to see where you live.
Go along now. Run along home.
It's late.
You call this late?
It's late enough for a working girl.
Come on, Brenda. I won't be long, I promise.
All right, but only for a few minutes, mind.
Okay, thanks.
I won't need you.
It just fell out of your pocket, guvnor, onto the floor.
And I was just putting it back when you were asleep.
It sort of jerked out, like, on the floor.
I was putting 'em in a bit quiet, like, so as not to waken you.
You keep your hands out of my pockets, or I'll break your arms!
Honestly, there's nothing I detest more than someone taking liberties with a fine gentleman like yourself.
Oh, it's you again,
Mr. Robinson.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Well, I'm having my lunch just now.
If you want an appointment, perhaps you'll be good enough to see my secretary.
By the way, how did you get in?
Oh, no problem, really.
Just a question of using your head.
I waited in the courtyard till
I saw her go out to lunch.
It all seems a bit elaborate.
Yeah, perhaps, but...
You're the one
I wanted to see.
I thought I'd already explained to you that we cannot help you.
Oh, come on now.
I know that you can be most helpful when you try.
Look, Mr. Robinson, you want women of a specific type.
How shall I put it?
Certain peculiarities appeal to you, and you need women to submit to them.
Here we have, I'm afraid, a very normal clientele.
As I say, we can do nothing for you.
And now if you'll kindly let me get on with my lunch.
I don't think you're really trying your best for me.
I mean, if you can fix up a lot of idiots, then why not me? Hmm?
I've explained.
You're different.
How so?
I have my good points.
I like flowers and...
Fruit.
People like me.
I've got things to give.
I'm sorry.
I thought matrimonial agencies were supposed to bring people together?
Not people like you.
Somehow I don't think our clients would appreciate your conception of a loving relationship.
I get on with all sorts of people.
Good. Then you don't need us.
You're not the only matrimonial agency, you know.
Then go elsewhere.
Not that any reputable agency would service you.
I've been elsewhere.
But...
This one, for me, is the best, because...
I like you.
You're my type of woman.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm serious.
I respect a woman like you, and I know how to treat you as well.
You know, in my trade...
We have a saying.
We put it on the fruit.
"Don't squeeze the goods till they're yours."
Now, that's me.
I would never do that.
You know that, don't you?
Excuse me. I've just remembered a call I've got to make.
There's no need to call the police.
What made you think I was going to call the police?
Just intuition, I suppose.
Oh, English?
Yeah, of course it is.
That's a very frugal lunch you've got there.
Frugal...
And mean.
Certainly not enough to support a lady with your opulent figure.
Rather too opulent, I'm afraid, these days, hence the frugality.
Why don't you come out and have a slap-up lunch with me?
No, I really can't leave the office just now.
I'd buy you the best lunch in town.
No, I c...
All right.
It's a deal.
You mean it? You'll come and have lunch with me?
Of course.
Just let me wash my hands.
I thought we were going to lunch.
Yes, of course we're going to lunch.
Afterwards.
Ah!
All right. I know what you want, but not here.
Let's go back to my place.
But this is your place. You've got nothing to worry about here.
No, my secretary may come back any minute.
Really?
How long do you give her to eat her frugal lunch?
Fifteen minutes.
She may be here any minute.
The outside door is locked.
She's got her own key.
I don't believe you.
Do you know what happens to wicked girls who tell wicked lies?
Oh.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Leave me alone. Please!
Take the money out of my bag, but please, leave me alone.
In my bag there's, there's enough money there to buy any woman you want.
It's yours.
Take it! Just take it!
I don't buy women.
It's you I want.
You're my type.
You are. Yes.
You are my type of woman.
Please, let me answer the telephone.
If you don't, the caller will come around here in person.
I told you, I locked the outer door.
We won't be disturbed.
Oh, God!
Leave me alone.
All right. All right,
I won't struggle.
But I like you to struggle.
A lot of women like to struggle.
Please, don't tear my dress.
I'll take it off if you like.
Lovely.
Lovely.
Lovely.
"Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night..."
Lovely.
"Nor for the arrow which flieth by day..."
Lovely.
"Nor for the pestilence which walketh in darkness..."
Lovely!
"Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday..."
Lovely.
"He shall give his angels charge over thee
"to guard thee in all thy ways."
Lovely!
Lovely!
Lovely!
Lovely!
Lovely.
You bitch!
Women!
They're all the same.
They are.
I'll show you.
My God! The tie!
Dear Jesus, help me. Help me.
Hello?
Anyone there?
Brenda, it's Richard.
Hello.
Hello, Globe?
May I speak to
Barbara Milligan?
Is that you, Blaney?
Listen, you've got a bloody nerve ringin' up here in my busiest time.
I don't know where she is. She's probably in the other bar.
I most certainly will not nip 'round and fetch her.
She's busy and so am I...
Hello, Dickie.
Is that you?
Get a move on. It's not a lonely hearts club.
Here, guv.
Give us a pint.
Yeah?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm okay.
Look, I need my things, but I don't particularly fancy meeting Forsythe.
Do you think you could pack 'em up, and put 'em in my bag and meet me this afternoon?
Are you sure?
It'd be great if you could, but I don't want to mess things up for you.
Don't worry. It's my half-day today, silly.
Where shall I meet you?
I'll be opposite the Leicester
Square Odeon, 4:00. Okay?
Okay, at 4:00.
I've gotta run now. Bye.
Don't start lending him money.
You'll never get it back.
Why don't you mind your own business.
- He's no good for you, Babs.
- And you are?
Hey, guv!
Take a whiff of this!
How far from here was the place you had lunch, Miss Barling?
About five or 10 minutes.
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon, one and all.
This is Miss Barling, sir.
Sergeant Spearman, would you do the honors?
Certainly, sir.
The murdered woman is a Mrs. Brenda Blaney.
She ran this business here, sir, and was found by her secretary, Miss Barling, on her return from lunch at approximately 2:00, sir.
Afternoon.
Afternoon, sir.
Has Miss Barling any ideas?
She certainly has, sir.
She says she saw the murdered woman's ex-husband leaving the building just as she came back, sir.
I saw him clear as day.
It was Blaney, all right.
He came out of the door downstairs and walked down the alley.
The beast!
I'm sorry, Miss Barling.
I must press you.
Are you sure it was Mr. Blaney?
Absolutely!
I'd know him anywhere.
You see, he came here yesterday afternoon, and was perfectly horrid.
He'd been drinking and insisted on seeing Mrs. Blaney.
And did he see her?
Yes. She'd never turn anyone away, not even him.
What happened?
Oh, I don't know.
They started having a row almost immediately, and Mrs. Blaney came out and said I might go.
Well, quite naturally I didn't want to embarrass her, so I left.
As I did so,
I couldn't help overhearing that Mr. Blaney was becoming very violent, both in his language and his behavior.
Did he strike Mrs. Blaney?
Yes, I think so.
There was the sound of a blow.
I see.
Miss Barling, could you describe Mr. Blaney for us?
What he looked like, what he was wearing and so on.
Well, yes, I think I can.
He was a man in his 30s, about an inch or so under 6' tall.
He had dark hair, green eyes and a mustache.
I estimate his weight at about 155 pounds.
He was wearing a rather old-fashioned jacket with leather patches on the shoulders and at the elbows.
In my opinion, it was quite unsuitable for London.
He was also carrying a raincoat.
That's an extraordinarily precise description, Miss Barling.
In my job I've learned to keep a sharp eye on men, Inspector.
Excuse me.
I found this handbag on the desk, and there's no sign of any money.
That doesn't make sense.
I cashed a check for £50 for her at the bank only yesterday lunchtime.
It makes perfect sense to me. Where does she keep her money in this bag?
Sometimes she zips it in the pocket.
Have this face powder identified, will you, Sergeant?
There might be some on the stolen money.
We might be lucky.
All right, sir.
What about fingerprints?
With all the clowns who come in here, sir, there'll be dozens.
Coburg Hotel, Bayswater.
Hey, wait a moment.
How can you afford a hotel?
I'll tell you later.
Okay.
So, what you been up to, Dick?
Well, last night...
I allowed myself to be pampered by the handmaidens of a Salvation Army hostel.
I tell you, after mixing with some of the types in there, one's clothing needs fumigation.
Smell that.
Phew!
You mean you slept there?
Yeah. Spasmodically.
What? With all the old men?
Yes, that's it.
We had a high old time.
The conversation was mature, the Red Biddy flowed down the odd throats, and the good fellowship of the open road prevailed.
Red Biddy.
What's that?
Blended red wine. Half vino,
half mentholated spirits.
But why, Dick?
Reasonable terms for bachelors, that's why.
30 pence a night, in fact.
I don't understand.
I mean...
How can you afford the Coburg?
Well, I managed to get some money.
- Since last night?
- Yeah.
I collected an old debt.
Oh. That was lucky.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
Double room, please.
What are you up to?
Not here!
Would that be with two singles, or the matrimonial-size bed?
The mat...
Double bed. Please.
Yes. I see.
322 should suit you.
The Cupid Room.
Really?
Yes. It's very cozy.
If you'll just sign the register.
Yes, of course.
"Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Wilde."
Now, look here, Dick Blaney!
Oscar, if you don't mind.
Dick, will you stop playing games?
I can't possibly...
Excuse me. That'll be £10, plus service charge of £2.
Perhaps you'd care to settle now?
- There we are.
- Thank you.
Room, please?
322, Bertie.
Follow me, please.
You've got 322.
That's nice.
Yes. The Cupid Room,
I think she called it.
Love's little arrows have struck quite a few hearts in there, sir, I can tell you.
Oh, yeah.
Can I get you anything from the pharmacy, sir?
No, thank you.
- Ta.
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey!
- Sir?
Hang on. Can you send this to the cleaners for me?
- Certainly, sir.
- And this.
Tell them that it's urgent.
And might as well take the other half as well.
Tell them that
I want them sprayed.
Sprayed, sir? With what?
DDT, my good man.
What else?
Sir?
Death to the lurking roach, porter.
Confusion to the insidious louse.
Get 'em cleaned and pressed, eh?
Yes, sir.
Oh, dear!
Hey, Glad, take a look at this.
Oh! Oh, that poor woman.
It's the jacket, Glad, I'm talkin' about.
The jacket! See what it says?
"The police are anxious to interview a man
"seen leaving the matrimonial agency
"about the time of the murder.
"When last seen he was wearing a tweed jacket
"with leather patches on the shoulders and elbows
"and carrying a raincoat."
That's a funny way to patch a jacket.
It's meant to be like that, Glad.
The party in 322 was wearin' it.
Do you mean... Do you mean Mr. Oscar Wilde?
That's not his real name, silly.
Oscar Wilde, indeed!
He's the fellow the police are looking for.
Don't you see?
He's the necktie murderer.
And we've got him upstairs at this very minute!
Oh, dear!
I only hope that girl isn't wearing a necktie at this very moment.
I can't believe it!
Not in the Cupid Room!
You know, Glad, sometimes just thinkin' about the lusts of men makes me want to heave.
Hello. Will you give me the police, please?
Hello, police?
I'm the porter of the Coburg Hotel, Bayswater.
Could you come at once? I've got this fellow you're looking for here.
You know, the necktie murderer.
He came here with a girl.
Come away, Glad. You're not to do anything suspicious.
Open up!
Open up! Police!
They must've gone down the back stairs.
But I ask you, in all conscience, is it likely I would murder a woman
I'd been married to for 10 years?
If it was true, it would be horrible.
And rape her, after 10 years of marriage?
Violently rape her?
I don't know. I'm always hearing of kinky things.
Perhaps you was jealous of her.
Of Brenda?
Oh, come off it.
I didn't know Brenda.
It's possible.
Maybe you just wanted to get rid of her.
But I had got rid of her.
We were divorced, remember.
We had been for two years.
There was no question of alimony.
She earned far more than me.
You got that money from her, didn't you?
You never collected a debt.
Well, yes, I did.
But she gave it to me the night before when we had dinner.
20 pounds.
Why lie about it, then?
I suppose I was ashamed to admit it, that's all.
That makes sense,
I suppose.
But here, wait a mo.
If Brenda gave you the money at dinner, why'd you sleep in the doss-house?
You could've afforded a hotel.
I didn't realize that I had it.
She slipped it into the pocket of my raincoat.
Oh, go on, Dick.
Why don't you pull the other one?
It's got bells on it.
But it's true!
I suppose she didn't want to embarrass me.
You've got to admit it is pretty tall.
Well, it's not as tall as me sleeping in a doss-house with
20 quid in my pocket!
If I knew I had it, I'd never have gone there, would I?
Maybe.
Maybe!
You smelled that jacket!
Would you sleep there if you didn't have to?
It wasn't that bad, that jacket.
I still think it's a bit suspicious, your sending it to the cleaners.
Suspicious of what?
In them sex cases, they always do a lab test on the clothes.
It stank to high heaven!
That's why.
You know it did.
Barbara, I swear
I'm telling the truth.
Now, do I look like a sex murderer to you?
Can you imagine me creeping around London, strangling all those women with ties?
That's ridiculous.
For a start,
I only own two.
Well, it's true. That jacket was a bit smelly and...
I suppose if you had known about the money, you wouldn't have stayed with a lot of old men like that.
Then you believe me?
Thousands wouldn't.
Thanks.
I must be soft in the head lettin' a suspected strangler put his arms around me.
Shows you trust me.
I suppose so.
Hey, what we gonna do? The police will be looking for you!
I don't know.
I haven't thought yet.
Well, there's only one thing you can do.
Go and see 'em. Tell them what happened, like you told me.
No, I can't do that.
You've got to!
They'd never believe me.
Why not? I did.
You're not the law. I'm probably their only suspect.
You just have to go along and persuade them to search for someone else.
I mean, one look at you and they'd know you wasn't a sadistic killer.
Blaney!
Come on!
Dicko!
Haven't done any of this cloak-and-dagger stuff since the Suez business.
That's when I first met Dicko, in the squadron, you know.
He was a bit of a split-assed type then too.
Hetty, you remember Dicko, don't you?
Of course. Come in.
And...
This is Miss Milligan.
Hello, Miss Milligan.
Pleased to meet you.
I bumped into them in the park.
How fortunate!
We haven't seen you in ages, Dick.
How's Brenda?
Do you still hear from her?
Well, she's dead,
I'm afraid.
Yes.
And you killed her!
Steady on, Hetty.
He didn't do it.
He's just been telling me all about it.
Has he, now?
You see, he was seen near the place where Brenda was murdered.
So the police think he's the strangler chap. But he's not, of course.
All he wants is a place to hide out.
And you suggested he should stay here.
Well, yes.
It seemed a good idea.
Nobody ever knows who's staying here.
You're a bloody fool, Johnny, getting yourself involved like this.
But he didn't do it.
Of course he did it!
What, old Dicko?
Yes, old Dicko, the chivalrous knight of the skies!
He always treated her like a shit!
Really, Hetty, I think you're absolutely wrong.
Don't you remember that disgusting divorce petition?
The things you did to her!
Divorce petition?
Oh, didn't he tell you?
Did he forget to mention he was divorced from his wife on the grounds of extreme cruelty?
Thank you very much.
Well, is it true?
Yes!
Both extreme mental and physical cruelty.
Depravity was mentioned, I think.
It had to read that way, but there wasn't a word of truth in it!
The lawyers made the whole thing up.
You see neither of us wanted to wait three years until I could get a divorce on the grounds of desertion, so I allowed her to divorce me on the grounds of cruelty.
Extreme cruelty.
I wonder if the police have read a copy of it.
My God!
Yes, I'm sure they'll be fascinated.
He's innocent,
Mrs. Porter, I know he is.
You know it?
How do you know it?
Well, as you say, they'd been divorced.
There was no call for him to do her in.
There's no spiteful act
I'd put past old Dicko here, especially if he were drunk.
Were you drunk when you did it?
Was that it?
I didn't do it, Hetty.
I didn't do it! I swear!
Then why don't you go to the police and explain to them instead of involving Johnny?
I didn't want to involve him.
He insisted.
That's right, I did. Can't abandon a chap in trouble.
I still say, why don't you go to the police and inform them?
They'd never believe him, that's why.
He's the only suspect they've got, poor lamb, and with all the evidence against him, they'd lock him up without so much as a by-your-leave.
Oh, please hide him,
Mrs. Porter, just for tonight, until we can think what's best to do.
Of course we'll hide him. Can't throw an old comrade to the cops.
Well, if you want to be arrested for harboring a wanted man or subverting the course of justice or whatever, on your own head be it, Johnny.
But I wash my hands of the matter.
Thank God we're off to
Paris tomorrow morning.
That's all I can say.
That is, if we're not all in jail!
I'm going shopping.
Perhaps I'd better go.
Nonsense, old chap.
Don't worry about Hetty. I'll calm her down. You can use the sofa tonight.
I must be off.
I'm ever so late already.
What do you do,
Miss Milligan?
I work in a pub.
Same place he used to be.
Really?
Why don't both of you slip out of the country till this whole thing's blown over?
Come and give me a hand at the Bulldog.
Bulldog?
It's an English pub I've opened in Paris.
They're the new thing there.
That's a great idea.
Why don't we?
Not likely. I never was any good at French.
Well, you don't have to be.
It's an English pub.
As long as you can say non, you'll be all right.
Well...
Come on, Babs.
You don't like the Globe any more than I did.
Look, meet me at Victoria Station tomorrow morning, 11:00, by the flower stall.
We can shoot down to the coast and get a day trip to France.
You don't need a passport.
Okay.
Splendid!
Froggies will roll over and die at the sight of a real English barmaid.
I must go now, really.
You know Forsythe.
Mum's the word, eh?
Don't tell a soul I'm here.
Cross me heart and hope to die.
Thanks for lookin' after him.
Not at all, my dear.
I'll come see you to the lift.
Enjoying that, are you, sir?
Sergeant, my wife is currently taking a course at the Continental School of Gourmet Cooking.
Apparently they've never heard of the principle,
"To eat well in this country, one must have breakfast three times a day."
And an English breakfast at that.
I don't mean your café complet.
Beg pardon, sir?
It's a cup of coffee half an inch deep in floating bits of boiled milk, and a sweet bun full of air.
That's what I had this morning.
I see what you mean, sir.
I'm a...
A Quaker Oats man, myself.
Excuse me, sir.
This has just come in.
It's the lab report on the £10 note that Blaney used to pay the hotel bill with.
Yes.
Well, as you'll see, the note bore traces of face powder identical to that which we found in Mrs. Blaney's handbag.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, Sergeant, we were in luck after all.
Yes, sir. That just about does it for him, I'd say.
Looks very much like it.
I've never run into any of these jokers before, sir.
What are they like?
Oh, they vary, but not a lot.
The important thing to remember is they hate women, and are mostly impotent.
Impotent?
Don't mistake rape for potency, Sergeant.
In the latter stage of the disease, it's the strangling, not the sex, that brings them on.
Above all, of course, they're sadists.
You know what they are,
Sergeant, I'm sure.
Oh, yes, sir.
And if you don't, you can read all about it in there,
Mrs. Blaney's divorce petition.
It tells you a great deal about the habits of our hero.
Yeah?
Right. Put him on.
Yes, Chief Inspector
Oxford speaking.
My name is Forsythe, Inspector.
Felix Forsythe.
I run the Globe Public House,
Covent Garden.
Now, I see from the newspaper you're in charge of these strangling cases.
Yes, Mr. Forsythe, that is so.
Good, because I've got some information to impart.
Now, this man you're looking for, the one with the patches on his suit.
I know him. He worked here as a barman.
His name is Richard Blaney.
He's a right bastard.
Are you quite certain it's the same man?
Gone off with your barmaid? What exactly do you mean by "gone off"?
Well, she's been out all night with him and hasn't yet returned.
And I felt it my duty to tell you that I consider her to be in great danger.
That is, of course, if she's still alive and kicking.
Well, thank you for your information, Mr. Forsythe.
Tell me, what does this barmaid of yours look like?
Well, then, I can set your mind at rest on one point at least.
She was alive and running at 8:00 this morning.
8:00 this morning?
Well, where is she now?
We opened at 11:00!
What I want to know is, is she coming back here or not?
She's left all her clothes here.
I expect she'll turn up sooner or later.
These days, ladies abandon their honor far more readily than their clothes.
Thank you for your information, Mr. Forsythe.
I'll send someone over.
That was Forsythe, manager of the Globe Public
House, Covent Garden.
Well, I tell you what, Jim, I'm glad
I'm not in the potato business.
Got enough troubles of me own.
Yeah, you're not a bad judge, Bob.
The potato business is poison, always was.
It costs a fortune to dig 'em up, another fortune to transport them.
And what do you have at the end?
Hardly any money for them.
Mostly you can't sell them.
I've got to send a truckload back up to Lincolnshire tonight.
And what will they do with them?
They'll plow them back in.
Can you beat it?
And they say there's people hungry in this world.
True, Jim.
And there are a few thirsty as well.
Come on, have one with your Uncle Bob.
Good afternoon!
Just a minute. Where do you think you've been?
Your half-day was yesterday afternoon, not this morning.
You took a hell of a chance, didn't you, spending the night with a murderer?
How do you know I spent the night with anyone?
Now come off it.
You took his clothes to him. You didn't come home. It stands to reason.
Why don't you mind your own bleeding business?
Don't talk to me like that, girl.
I was worried about you.
I thought you might be next.
I even phoned the police.
- Police?
- Yeah. They wanna talk to you.
They're sending a fella over from Scotland Yard.
Why?
Why? Because they want your lover. That's why.
They wanna pick him up and put him where he can't strangle any more women!
And you'd better help 'em.
The sooner that madman's behind bars the better.
Don't you talk about him like that!
You don't realize how lucky you are to be alive!
Christ Almighty, Babs, if I wasn't shorthanded, I'd take you down to Scotland Yard myself!
As it is, right after closing time...
I won't be here!
And you can stuff your rotten job right up your jacksy!
Come back, you!
Oh, balls!
Got a place to stay?
Oh, it's you, Bob.
Yeah.
I heard that ding-dong you had with Forsythe.
Oh, he's a right bastard.
Well, of course he is.
You can stay at my place till you get something sorted out, if you want.
I won't be in your way. I'm going up north for a few days.
No strings?
Now, do I look like that sort of a bloke?
All blokes are that sort of a bloke.
Are you really goin' away?
Sure! Tonight.
You can have the place to yourself.
I'll take you there now.
And if you like,
I'll go back to the Globe and pick up your stuff for you.
Now, I can't say fairer than that, can I?
Oh, thanks, Bob.
I'll just stay the one night if you don't mind.
Suit yourself.
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to...
I'm going to my sister in Southall.
Leaving your boyfriend in the lurch a bit, aren't you?
He has to make up his own mind what to do.
Well, you know, I'd like to help him if I could. Where's he hiding out?
- I can't tell you, Bob. I promised.
- Oh.
Come on, Babs.
Dick and me have always been mates.
You know that.
I can't.
All right.
Keep your little secret.
You know, changing jobs can be a blessing in disguise.
It gets you out of a rut.
A girl like you ought to travel, see the world a bit.
The Cape, California, Jaffa.
Where the fruit comes from, that's where I'd like to go if I wasn't tied down here.
But you, you can do as you please!
You've got the whole of your life ahead of you.
Here we are.
I'm on the second floor.
I don't know if you know it, Babs, but you're my type of woman.
Is that you, Tim?
Hello, dear.
Hungry?
- Yes.
- Good.
I'll bring it right in.
It's a soupe de poisson, dear.
I know you'll enjoy it.
Say, I have no doubt of it.
Don't wait for me. I'm just going to see to the next course.
Well...
What's new in the case?
Any sensational breaks?
No. I'll be glad when we get
Mr. Richard Blaney inside, though.
Any idea where he is?
No, our only lead to him left her job this morning.
What's more, I don't know where she is either.
You're certain he's the one?
Oh, yes, he's the one, all right.
There's not even the complication of another suspect.
It has to be him.
We have him identified as leaving the matrimonial agency at the time his ex was killed.
We have the clothes which he found necessary to send to the cleaners in a hurry.
And we have the evidence of the face powder in the Salvation Army hostel.
I don't follow you, my dear.
I didn't think the Salvation
Army girls used makeup.
No, Blaney slept in a Salvation
Army hostel the night before last.
Did he, dear?
Yes.
He was incautious enough to tell them his name.
I don't think an ex-RAF officer would sleep in such a place unless he was broke, do you?
No, I don't.
So, let's assume he was.
Last night, however, he slept in the...
Coburg Hotel in Bayswater and paid for his extremely expensive room with a £10 note.
The note bore traces of the same face powder we found in
Mrs. Blaney's handbag.
I mean, the murderer not only strangled Mrs. Blaney, he stole money from her handbag as well.
Ergo...
Blaney is the thief and also the murderer.
That ties it up then.
Well, I think so.
And furthermore, there is a waitress at Mrs. Blaney's club who can also testify to Blaney's aggressive behavior towards his wife the previous night.
He doesn't seem to have been very discreet, does he?
No. Discretion is not traditionally the strong suit of the psychopath, dear.
Believe me, that's what we're dealing with.
You ought to read his wife's divorce petition.
What exactly is in this soup?
Why? Don't you like it?
Mmm.
It's delicious.
But I find the...
Ingredients are somewhat mystifying.
They're smelts, ling, conger eel, John Dory, pilchards and frogfish.
And now, since that must've been fairly satisfying,
I thought a simple roast bird would be enough.
Caille aux raisins.
Hmm?
Quail with...
Grapes.
I must say,
I'm very worried.
- About Mr. Blaney?
- Yes.
He's gone off with a barmaid he used to work with.
I think she's in very great danger.
You're wrong, Tim.
Absolutely wrong.
It can't be this fellow.
How long did you say he was married?
Ten years.
Well, there you are.
A crime de passion after all that time?
Look at us. We've only been married eight years, and you can hardly keep your eyes open at night.
Well, that as may be.
But I don't knock you about or make you do degrading things.
No, the evidence speaks for itself.
Besides, you can't make normal judgments about psychopathic killers.
They can be triggered off at any time.
We've got to find him before his...
Appetite is whetted again.
Christ all-bloody-mighty!
See you, mate.
You bitch!
Where's that bloody pin?
Hey, you're spilling your load!
What?
The potatoes. They're falling on the road.
Argh!
Hey, do you see what I see?
Here, what's wrong...
Who is it?
Perhaps you can tell us.
- Wake up!
- What?
Get out of here.
What is it?
Brenda wasn't enough for you.
You had to kill another girl too!
- What girl?
- You know, all right.
That girl you brought here yesterday.
Babs?
As if you didn't know.
You strangled her like all the others!
She's been strangled?
Don't you play act with me.
Get up and get out of here.
I'd call the police myself if I knew how to do it without getting involved.
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
It's true, Dicko. It just came over on the radio.
They found her in a potato truck in Lincolnshire.
The fellow at the pub where you worked identified her.
He knows where they found her.
He put her there!
What are you talking about? I haven't left this room all night.
Liar. I don't believe you.
Hetty, it doesn't matter whether you believe him or not, because it said on the radio that Miss Milligan had been dead for at least 12 hours when they found her at 3:00 this morning.
Now, that means that she must've been killed before 3:00 yesterday afternoon.
And Dick was here with us from the time she left to the time we went to bed.
So he couldn't have done it.
Poor kid.
I still don't believe it.
They're only guessing when she was killed.
We didn't go to bed till 11:00, and Dick was here with us then.
They can't be eight hours adrift.
Hey, Dicko?
Don't you see what this means? You're in the clear! We can give you an alibi.
Yes. Yes,
I suppose you can.
But there's no supposing.
Yeah, and we'll simply tell the police you were here with us.
Would you do that? Would you do it now before you go away?
Of course, old boy.
Delighted.
You'll do no such thing!
What?
Not unless you want to go to jail for harboring a wanted man.
But he's not a criminal.
Well, the police think he is!
And they have a lot of evidence against him.
Yes, but we know he didn't kill Miss Milligan.
We've got to tell them he was here with us.
But we don't know he didn't kill Miss Milligan!
For all we know the time given out on the radio might've been a trap.
But what is certain, if you go to the police, they will probably charge you with being an accessory after the fact.
And they certainly won't allow us to go abroad, and they will probably put us in jail.
Well, Hetty's right, damn it.
I mean, you can see that,
Dicko, can't you?
You mean you won't come to the police with me?
Well, I don't see how I can.
I mean, you heard Hetty.
But you're my only alibi!
Well, I'm sorry, old chap.
You see, I've got to get to Paris today.
I can't afford to be kept here.
But you can afford to stand by and see me go to jail for life!
Is that it?
Well, it's not as bad as all that, old chap.
They'll find this strangler chappie pretty soon and they'll...
Of all the cowardly shits!
It's "I'm all right, Jack, and haul up the ladder," isn't it?
You pair of bastards!
Well, if that's how you feel after all we've done for you,
I think you better had go!
I'll call the manager.
And involve yourself?
Don't worry, I'm going.
I'm a little choosy with whom I spend my last hours of freedom.
Look, Dick,
I'm sorry about all this.
I'd suggest that you came to
Paris and worked in the pub, but they're watching all the ports and stations.
It said so on the news.
Well, that lets you out then, doesn't it?
Your responsibility for me ends here.
Clear this area, please. Thank you, madam.
Stand back, please.
Looks as though we've got half the law in London in the market this morning.
Yeah. It makes it very difficult to give short weight.
I suppose they're trying to find out if anybody saw Blaney put in poor, old Babs on that potato truck.
You think he did it, do you?
It stands to reason, doesn't it?
Why? Don't you?
I'm not as eager as some to turn on my old mates.
What are you talkin' about?
Blaney wasn't a mate of mine.
I suppose you know I had to sack him for stealin'.
Get off.
Yeah, Blaney was a thief, right bastard.
I even told that
Chief Inspector, but he didn't believe a word, did he?
Well, I expect he's laughing on the other side of his face now.
You reckon?
Yeah, definitely, definitely.
He wasn't so cocky when I saw him at 7:00 this morning.
I've just been down to
Scotland Yard to identify her.
From photos, you know.
They took 'em, and they...
Rushed 'em down special.
She wasn't a pretty sight, I can tell you.
Some people have all the luck.
Yeah. I better get a move on, I suppose.
Business will be pretty brisk today.
You know how morbid some people are.
Absolutely! Jumping up to identify dead girls at all hours of the morning.
See you later.
My God, Dick!
Whatcha doin' here?
Look, I'm sorry, Bob, but I had nowhere else to go.
The people I was staying with left for Paris this morning.
I wouldn't have come now, except that you did say if I needed anything, anytime...
Yes, yes, of course!
But you took a hell of a chance coming here this morning.
The whole place is teeming with coppers.
Wait a minute.
Well, you'd better hole up in my place for a day or two till we get something sorted.
Yes. I thought maybe if you had the room.
I know it's a hell of an imposition getting you involved and everything, but...
Well, you've got to believe me.
I haven't murdered anyone!
This whole business is insane!
I mean, you know me.
I wouldn't get involved in anything like this.
Of course you wouldn't, Dick. No.
The police, as usual, have got the whole thing arse about face.
I mean, these sort of killings always boggle the mind.
That man must be a sexual maniac.
Mind you, there are some women who ask for everything they get.
But you? Don't make me laugh.
You're not the type.
Now, don't worry.
You've done the right thing coming to your Uncle Bob.
Right. Well, let's get over to my place now.
You know where it is, don't you?
- Yeah.
- Great.
I'll go first, and I'll take the bag.
- You'll be less conspicuous that way.
- Okay.
You follow, but take the long way around.
Go down to the Strand, you know.
And then work your way up
Southampton Street.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Well done, boy! Come in.
Make yourself comfortable.
Very cozy.
Yes, well, it's my little nest.
You know, my home.
Home is the place where when you have to go there, they have to take you in.
That's what my ol' mum used to say.
You met my mum, didn't you?
Yes.
Great old lady.
I better get back to the shop.
See you later, eh?
Yeah, sure.
There's something to eat in the kitchen.
The booze is here.
So get on with it, right?
Bob, I'm really grateful for all this.
You know that.
I told you, think nothing of it.
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Keep away from the windows.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Ta-ta.
And don't do anything
I wouldn't do.
Are you
Richard Ian Blaney?
Yes. What is this?
You're under arrest. Come quietly, and you won't get hurt.
Is this necessary?
We take no chances with bastards like you.
- He's clean, sir.
- Is this your bag?
- Come on, you.
- Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Rusk.
You've been very helpful.
Anything to oblige, Sarge.
No reward, I'm afraid.
Better luck next time, eh?
Well, you know what they say,
Sarge, "Virtue is its own reward."
Well, if you want any more help, I'll be in my shop.
All right.
We know where you are.
How's that kid of yours gettin' on with the violin?
Richard Ian Blaney?
Yes.
As the result of my inquiries, you'll be detained in connection with the willful murders of Brenda Margaret Blaney,
Barbara Jane Milligan and others.
You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish.
But anything you do say will be taken down in writing and may be used in evidence.
Mr. Oxford, could you spare a second over here?
Rusk. It's Rusk!
Hold him back.
Where was this found?
Over at Henrietta Street where we picked him up, sir.
Any identification?
"Miss Barbara Milligan, Globe Public House.
Covent Garden, London, WC2."
Are you agreed upon your verdict?
We are.
Do you find the prisoner,
Richard Ian Blaney, guilty or not guilty of the murder of Brenda...
JUDGE:... Ian Blaney, you have been found guilty of a terrible crime.
On its ghastly and wicked nature I will not dwell.
I only tell you that you must entertain no expectation or hope that you will escape the consequences of it.
The sentence of this court is that you serve a term of life imprisonment for not less than 25 years...
Rusk did it!
I told you all along!
Rusk!
I keep telling you.
Rusk, where are you?
One of these days, you bastard! Rusk...
Where are you? Rusk?
One of these days, I'm gonna get out and kill you, you bastard!
I've got nothing to lose now!
I might as well do what
I'm being locked away for!
You remember that!
You remember that!
Rusk did it.
Rusk did it!
I told you all along!
Rusk? Rusk, where are you?
One of these days, I'm gonna get out and kill you, you bastard!
I've got nothing to lose now!
I might as well do what I'm being put away for.
You remember that!
You remember that!
- Do you see the sign, Hartletts?
- Yes, sir.
Well, it's the fair-haired chap in the brown suit standing right underneath it.
- Did you see him?
- Yes, I did.
Right. We'll go around once again, and I want a good, close mug shot.
Yes, Inspector,
I remember him well.
He came here on two or three occasions.
Every business has its own special cross to bear, I suppose.
And yours is men like this?
That is so.
Most of them are easy enough to get rid of, but...
Mr. Robinson here was particularly insistent.
He simply wouldn't take no for an answer.
Mr. Robinson?
Yes, that is the man's name.
Here we are.
Mr. William Robinson.
You see, Inspector, he wanted us to find women for him who enjoyed...
Well, certain peculiarities.
You mean, who were sexual masochists?
Who enjoyed being hurt?
That sort of thing?
Quite.
Perhaps you'd better see it for yourself.
Naturally we told him we couldn't oblige, but as I say, he kept coming back.
Is it likely, do you think, that if Mr. Robinson couldn't get what he wanted from your agency, he would go to others?
Oh, yes, very likely.
Men like this leave no stone unturned in their search for their disgusting gratifications.
Excuse me, Inspector.
Do you have any special reason for seeing Mr. Robinson?
Yes, Miss Barling, we do.
And I'd like you to keep my visit confidential.
Of course.
Get the doctor quick.
It looks like an ambulance job.
I told you it wasn't
Blaney, didn't I?
I told you you were on the wrong track.
A woman's intuition is worth more than all those laboratories.
I can't think why you don't teach it in police colleges.
So you think it's Rusk, do you?
You think he's our man?
Well, of course.
Anyone can see that.
He knew both Mrs. Blaney and that
Barbara what's-her-name, didn't he?
Yes.
Well, there you are.
You told me the man's a sexual pervert.
That's why he kept the clothes and put them in poor Mr. Blaney's case.
We have no proof of that.
It stands to reason.
Don't you mean intuition?
What does your intuition tell you I want for dinner tonight?
Steak and a baked potato.
But you're getting
pied de porc à la mode de Caens.
It looks like a pig's foot!
That's what it is.
I put it in the same sauce the French use for tripe.
That's comforting.
Well...
When are you going to arrest this Mr. Robinson, or Rusk, or whatever he's called?
When I have the proof I need.
It takes a little longer to acquire than intuitive insights.
How much longer?
When will you have it?
In a few minutes
I hope, dear.
Really?
You old slyboots. Tell.
Well...
We know that if
Rusk is the murderer, he traveled up in the potato truck with his victim.
How do we know that?
Did you ever hear of a corpse that cut itself out of a tied sack?
What would he want to take the corpse out of the sack for?
Well, obviously, he was looking for something.
How do we know that?
Well, the corpse was deep in rigor mortis.
He had to break the fingers of the right hand to retrieve what they held.
You know, it would be so nice to get back to plain bread in this house.
What do you think they held?
A locket? A broach? A cross!
It had to be something that would incriminate him.
Something that he missed when he put the body on the truck.
A monogrammed handkerchief, perhaps.
Not a cross, I think.
Well...
I don't see why not.
Religious and sexual mania are closely linked.
Anyway, whatever it was, he found it, which was unlucky for us.
But we did have one piece of good fortune.
The truck driver told us that he stopped at one place on his journey, and that was at a pull-in somewhere out of London.
- A pull-in?
- Mmm.
It's a cafe frequented by truck drivers, dear.
They serve humble foods like bacon and egg sandwiches, sausages and mashed potatoes and cups of tea and coffee.
How is it so fortunate that this driver stopped there?
Well, it's not so much that he stopped, but that he stopped only once that is important.
The only place our man could've escaped from that truck was at that cafe.
I sent Sergeant Spearman out there earlier today to see if he could find anyone who could remember Rusk being there.
I'm expecting him back at any minute.
Well, eat up, dear. You'll want to be finished by the time he arrives.
Tasty, very tasty.
Not a lot of meat on it, mind.
No sense in gorging, dear.
I'll take mine and eat it while I'm beating my egg whites for the soufflé.
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Good evening, sir.
I hope I'm not interrupting your dinner.
No, not at all.
Come in.
Thank you, sir.
Put your hat and coat on the sofa.
Good evening, Sergeant Spearman.
What would you like to drink?
Good evening, madam.
Well, I don't know that I...
Oh, that's all right, Spearman.
You're off duty, now.
How about a margarita?
It's delicious.
Tequila, triple sec, fresh lemon juice and salt pressed
'round the rim of the glass.
You'll love it.
Thank you, madam.
Sergeant Spearman, you are positively glutinous with self-approbation.
You might as well speak out.
Yes, sir.
The woman behind the counter at the cafe positively identified Rusk from the photo I showed her as being a man who called at the café the night the body was discovered.
And that's not all.
What are you waiting for, Sergeant?
A roll of drums?
No, sir. Sorry, sir.
The woman also said that Rusk was disheveled and very dusty and asked to borrow a clothes brush.
This is the brush she lent him, sir.
You see there?
What do you say, Spearman?
Potato dust?
Here you are, Sergeant.
Cheers.
Cheers, madam.
Did you hear all that?
Yes, I told you.
I knew all the time.
Quite.
Get this down to the lab as soon as possible, will you?
Very good, sir.
It rather looks like we put the wrong man away this time.
What do you mean "we"?
You put him away.
All right, Spearman, you can get along now.
Good night, madam.
You haven't finished your drink.
I'm sorry, madam. I have to get down to the lab in a hurry.
Good night, Spearman.
Good work. Very good work.
Thank you, sir.
Poor Mr. Blaney.
You've got to get him out,
Tim, immediately.
He's in hospital at the moment.
But I'll talk to the assistant commissioner in the morning and get the case reopened.
He won't like it, but there's quite enough evidence for a pardon.
Will they give him any compensation?
I expect they'll give him some money, but there's no real way to compensate in cases like these.
Poor man.
I think the least you can do is ask him 'round for a really good dinner.
Let's see.
It will obviously have to be something substantial.
I think a Caneton aux cerises.
What's that?
Duckling...
With heavy sweet cherry sauce.
Well, after that jail food he's been having,
I expect he'll eat anything.
Excuse me.
I must see if my soufflé's started to rise.
Hey!
Are the pills working?
He's sleeping like a baby.
Do you think we gave him enough?
Christ, mate, he's had half a dozen.
Good. Now I'm off to get that bastard, Rusk!
All right, all right.
Let's make sure.
It's now or never! I'm due back inside tomorrow.
George? George!
All right, George.
Right, son, better be going.
Mind you, do him up good.
Here, take this strip of mica.
You may need it to open his door.
It might be locked.
Doctor? Sister?
Get a trolley, nurse.
Well, Sister, there seems to be no evidence of a cerebral accident.
We'll have to admit him for observation and then sort it out.
Could he be an epileptic or a diabetic?
Not very likely in his sort of job.
We're certainly going to need blood samples.
Sleeping pills! They've given him all their sleeping pills.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
Hello?
Good God! When was this?
Right. What's that?
Yes. Five minutes.
I'll wait outside.
I'm off! Blaney's escaped, and
I bet I know where he's gone.
I often wondered whether Blaney threw himself down those stairs in a suicide attempt or just as a means to get into the hospital.
And now, of course, we have our answer.
No. No! It's not...
Mr. Rusk.
You're not wearing your tie.
I...
Mr. Asby?
It's me, Jesse.
Just go about what you're doing.
Hello?
John?
Can you hear me?
What's the matter? John?
Answer me, John!
Can you hear me?
John, are you there?
Yeah.
I've got to see you.
- Is this Cal?
- It's me.
It's your brother.
Does he know you're here?
At 2:00 a. m., man?
I'm at the office.
That's your problem, baby.
Where have you been all day?
Around.
I've been trying to reach you.
I put $5,000 in your bank account this afternoon.
Payment in advance.
For what?
Pick me up now. I'm in deep trouble.
What's up?
Get here. Fast.
I'll tell you when I see you.
Yeah, okay.
I've been trying to reach my sister, Arna.
I've got to warn her.
Have you heard from her?
I think I can put a hand on her.
If you can reach her, tell her to get home and keep the doors locked till we get there.
Yeah, okay.
Check to see if there are any other bodies inside.
Looks like Cal Asby to me.
What's he look like to you?
What's left of him.
Maybe you two had a little conversation before this happened?
What did he tell you, Shaft?
Stay away from black honkies with big flat feet.
Looks like there's only one dead, Captain.
I was hoping maybe you could shed some light on that.
He never hurt anyone in his life.
He loved this community...
...and everybody here loved him.
He was planning to break ground for that Child Care Clinic...
...over in Harlem sometime next month.
But now...
How did you feel about that?
With him.
All the way.
Don't shit me, Kelly!
You fought him tooth and nail about laying bread on that ghetto clinic!
Fellas...
...help me move this next door.
After all, I can't leave it here.
Right there is fine.
Thanks a lot.
Would you close the door on your way out, please?
Listen, before I forget...
...have Jack check those two front doors on the chopper.
I don't know what the hell you got the idiot there for anyway.
Because he's the best.
What do you think I got him there for?
Sorry, Gus.
I'll go use the phone in the bedroom.
Kelly says the safe's empty.
Gus, do you hear me?
Kelly said the safe's empty!
Pour.
I don't understand how Kelly says the safe is empty.
Did you ask Mr. Kelly to pop by?
Yes.
I told him if he didn't have the $250,000,
I'd personally have his ass.
Possibly Mr. Kelly needs a little more time.
You shouldn't crowd people, Andy.
It's not cool.
You've got to give a man a little elbow room.
I'll give him elbow room, black son of a bitch!
You have a tendency to overreact, Andrew.
You see...
...Mr. Kelly means not only the $250,000 he owes me...
...but, remember, he's got the key to Queens.
Relax.
Relax.
I don't want too many boys hanging around.
- They won't be there.
- Make sure they're not there.
What're you buzzards doing here?
You go to a lot of funerals, Shaft.
Willy and me, one day we'll drop in on yours.
Real soon!
You're not invited.
In that case, we'll send you a wreath with love.
What about Asby and his numbers?
What will we do about that business?
Ain't our war, Willy.
Kelly's in charge now.
We got enough troubles of our own.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! What happened?
Keep an eye on her.
Right on time, Mr. Kelly.
Just trying to help, man.
Yeah, right.
Look, do me a favor.
When you got a moment, let me take a look at the partnership papers.
Okay.
I want to thank you for being so helpful.
At a time like this, John, it's the least I can do.
Arna tells me you'll be handling her end of the business.
You don't have any objections to that, do you?
No, no.
Since you are in such a bereaved state,
I might hang around and help you out.
Who knows, between both of us...
...maybe we can figure out who knocked off Cal.
Lately we seem to be traveling in the same circles:
Bombings, funerals...
...houses of the deceased.
Sad circles.
Let's go to the precinct and talk about it.
Okay, baby.
Get in the vehicle.
I got my own short.
I'll follow you.
Okay.
Come on! Come on!
What's going on here?
Chief, get this bastard off my back.
You little son of a bitch!
Tell him I got rights! Tell him!
What did he do?
Deli on Northern Boulevard for $300, gas station for $27...
...then he run a stolen Chevy into a squad car!
I got rights!
Fuck your rights! Go sue the city.
Come on.
Come on, kid.
Relax.
Don't you know they're trying to rehabilitate you here?
You try any of that shit on me and none of us will walk out of this room!
Come on, Shaft.
Sit down, Shaft.
I'll sit when I'm sure that ape will stay in his cage.
What the hell do you want with me?
What are you into with Cal Asby and Johnny Kelly?
I was into a funeral for an old friend.
Now, how's that any business of yours?
It's been the business of every man in this building...
...ever since Asby and Kelly set up a numbers racket in Queens.
- What's your connection with it?
- What's wrong with numbers?
A man needs a little action.
You've got off-track betting here in New York.
You've got a lottery system all over the world.
Everybody needs a long shot.
Now, ain't that right, Captain?
I'll throw up if you keep lecturing me on the psychodynamics...
...of what people need.
It's against the law, that's what's wrong with it.
Well, I'm glad you clued me in, Captain.
Get us some coffee, Cooper.
You talking to me, Captain?
What do you want me to do, sing?
Get the coffee, man!
Make mine black.
You didn't have to say that to Cooper.
Something just came over me, Captain.
I'm really ashamed.
I'll tell you what I got, Shaft.
You jiving Asby's sister...
...he catches a bomb...
...and Kelly takes over.
Maybe you two got it bracketed...
...and now you figure to run the numbers in Queens.
Like that so far?
Rap on.
And at the funeral, who do I see you with?
Bumpy.
And you figure I'm bringing Bumpy in?
Why not?
You finger Asby and bring in Bumpy.
You know, you private shits will do anything for a buck.
You pull Harlem and Queens together, and hell, man, you're fat.
Do you just sit around and think these things up...
...or do they just come to you in a flash?
How come we never hassled Cal Asby?
Go ahead, ask me.
'Cause he was probably laying heavy bread on you guys every month at the precinct.
He ran a wheel, okay.
Poor man's racetrack.
But man, you can't cut that out.
But he didn't deal in shit, whores or loan-sharking.
Everything was cool.
And now, with Asby dead...
...and Kelly running things, who knows?
Anybody can move into the vacuum.
Maybe your pal, Bumpy.
Or Mascola from downtown.
You've heard of Mascola?
Does a lot of TV work every time a Senate Crime Committee's in town.
Three sugars.
With cream.
So what do you want from me?
Put the word out.
Nobody better try and come in here and mess up the status quo.
And nobody's coming in here to sell shit to our kids...
...or put whores on our streets.
Is this program being recorded, or we going out live?
Look, man, I can cool you off the old-fashioned way.
We have a nice steel pad back there.
Okay, let's go.
But I can't be any help to anyone in a steel pad.
Okay, Shaft.
On the street.
But if you're smart...
...you'll keep in touch.
Asby-Kelly man.
Santa Claus.
You have hit the number, brother.
Count it.
Thank you, brother.
Same thing tomorrow, right?
Asby-Kelly man.
How are you, brother?
802 is the figure for today, brother.
That's $3 on your wife's burial policy...
...$1.50 on yours and...
She says she wants 717.
717. Fifty cents.
Thank you, brother.
Hey, man, please, don't shoot!
Take the money.
I've got a wife and six kids and an old Buick to support.
You won't get hurt as long as you keep talking.
Where's Kelly operating out of?.
Man, I can't.
Please, brother. Take the money.
I'm just the runner, man.
Where?
- Brother, I can't! Kelly will kill me, man!
- I said, "Where?"
"Every night when moon come up
"Big Bamboo he fill my cup
"Round 'bout six when moon come down
"Big bamboo nowhere around"
Shut up!
You used to say I had an operatic voice.
You were gonna give me voice lessons.
Just knock it off!
No damn fluid!
Maybe it's the wick.
It's the wicks that always go first.
Bitch!
Are you going to hang around here all day and shake?
Here, I pay the rent.
If I want to hang around all day that's my business!
You think I need you?
I don't see you packing.
Just watch!
- What the hell are you doing?
- You better not!
That's just for openers.
Bitch!
Yeah?
So?
So, it's you.
Another day's gone by and we're getting nothing but weather reports.
Easy on Mr. Kelly, now.
Look, man, I need more time.
You have a friend in court.
The man says to go easy on you.
You might suggest if he's in the neighborhood, he stop by...
...and we have a little chat.
The boss says if you wouldn't mind...
...get your ass over here right now!
No class. Simply no class.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Rita, I said I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Make it a couple of years!
Yes?
Kelly there?
We don't give out that kind of information.
Tell Kelly that John Shaft wants him.
If he's not in my office by 5:00,
I'll take this door off the hinges.
Why wait till 5:00?
Obviously you're not a friend of the family.
Not anymore, I'm not.
Not after a nasty slap in the face.
Best thing for that is an ice pack.
Why, thank you, Mr. Shaft.
Why don't you come in and show me how to apply it?
On second thought...
...no ice.
You might catch cold.
I suppose it's immodest of me to walk around like this in front of a stranger.
But any enemy of John Kelly's is an old friend of mine.
Funny...
I used to love the guy.
When do you expect him back?
I hope never.
So, what am I doing in a place like this?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you take your things off?.
Wait a minute.
I didn't mean all that!
Baby, look, it's hot in here.
Besides, I don't want you to feel overdressed.
You'll never guess where we found it.
How many times have I told you not to frisk our guests?
Mr. Kelly is no hoodlum.
You're sitting on my table, Mr. Kelly.
That's better.
I thought this was going to be a friendly conversation, Mr. Kelly.
I've been carrying that piece since I was 10 years old.
A lousy. 25 caliber.
I always figured he was a faggot.
Watch it!
Bring me up to the moment on our situation.
It's not good, Gus. It's not good at all.
How so, Mr. Kelly, how so?
Pascal, give me the parsley.
He had the money in the safe.
You're sure about that?
We signed the papers.
He was buying me out. In cash.
I had a couple of my boys outside.
They saw him take a shopping bag...
...and something out of the safe and go into the funeral home.
The money must've been in that bag.
Has it occurred to you, Mr. Kelly, that when you blew up your partner...
...that you may have also blown up my money?
Yeah, I had nightmares about that, too.
But then I've got a Photostat copy of the bomb squad report.
There was no money in the debris, so it's got to be somewhere in that funeral home.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
I'd invite you to dinner, but I suggest you have more pressing engagements.
Like getting up $250,000...
...by tonight.
There you go again, creating pressures and posing deadlines.
No, Mr. Kelly.
What I had in mind was something altogether different.
Not only do I want the money you've gambled away on my crap tables...
- ... but I want half of your action in Queens.
- Come on, man!
"Come on, man! "
We should make superb partners,
Mr. Kelly.
After all, we're both creative men.
Who else plays the clarinet better than I do?
- Or makes a better Shrimp Newburg?
- No way!
It's all tied in to the insurance and the funeral operation out front.
And besides, Cal's sister owns his share.
If you want your half, you get it from her.
You can hardly expect me to give up my half.
Hey, look, man.
She's got a guy. His name is John Shaft, and he's a bad dude.
I can't mess with her half.
Ever hear of John Shaft?
You see, Mr. Kelly, nothing to worry about.
Pascal hasn't ever even heard of him.
He's already into it.
He's sitting on my shoulders, Gus.
I can't make a move!
Could we be of assistance with the problem?
Assuming, of course, that we're partners 50-50 in your wheel.
Try to think fast, Mr. Kelly.
- You'll take care of Shaft?
- Depend on it.
Where the hell have you been with the goddamned elevator?
You ought not talk to a lady that way.
Where's your fucking manners anyway?
Do you have to go?
I've got to split, baby.
Rita?
Still want to see him?
Drive that cat crazy?
Rita! Open the door!
Rita, open the damn door!
Got a back entrance?
Rita, open the door!
Goddamn it, open the fucking door!
What's the matter with you?
Rita, open this goddamn door!
What the fuck! Kick the son of a bitch in!
I said, "open the door! "
Rita, open the damn door!
What's the matter with you?
You mean this door?
Ciao, baby!
Open the damn door, Rita!
What's wrong with you, woman?
Open the door!
Will you open the goddamn door?
What the hell's the matter with you?
Open this damn door!
I'll kick the son of a bitch in, in a minute!
I can't believe it!
But there it is, in writing.
Sorry, baby.
I wanted to open your eyes earlier.
Let you know what Kelly's scene was.
But to do that, I had to let you know what your brother was into.
Unbelievable, especially when you think...
...about the child care center he was going to build.
Your brother was a good man.
At least he put the money back where it came from.
That's more than I can say for Kelly.
Exactly what do these papers mean?
It's simple. Kelly was borrowing money from your brother for years...
...to pay off his gambling debts.
Your brother finally drew the line.
That paper is an agreement from Kelly for his interest in the business...
...in return for $250,000.
If your brother was alive,
Kelly would be broke and out on his ass.
The rest of it is obvious.
Come on, come on.
- What is it?
- Upstairs. Move it.
Flowers.
- Leave them at the door.
- Sorry, you've got to sign.
Just a minute.
Who put the contract out on me?
Get some things together and let's get out of here!
- I want to see your boss.
- What about?
Insurance.
Only insurance he needs is me, sweet pea.
I'm not here selling insurance, and you know it. Where's Bumpy?
He ain't buying no coffins either, unless he's buying yours.
Bring him in.
He's clean, Boss.
Clean as Mr. Clean himself.
Clean Kelly, pristine and clean.
Have a drink.
Thanks, Bumpy.
Take a seat.
No, man, I'm on the move.
Ain't a damn thing wrong with standing.
I've been expecting you, Kelly.
- What kind of help do you need?
- What makes you think I need help?
Man don't come calling on his competitors unless he needs help.
We're not competitors, Bumpy.
Anybody in my business is a competitor.
A man who knows my game can always...
...come into my neighborhood and try to play it.
So, what do you want?
I'm shopping for a new partner.
Kind of dangerous being your partner.
How much is it gonna cost me?
...up front.
What does that buy me?
25 percent of the action.
Gus Mascola would ask you for a hell of a lot more than that, baby.
How about 50?
No.
Why don't we make it 60 percent of the action?
What's that extra 10 percent?
Just in case we need a contract on Mascola.
You're really putting the screws to me!
He might not like the idea of this new arrangement between brothers.
- He might want to take counteraction.
- I can handle that.
But...
...there is one more little problem.
Nothing we can't handle together, brother.
If Cal's little sister owns half the business and you own 60...
...that don't leave nothing for me.
Now look, baby boo...
...there's troubles and troubles.
This one is yours.
Yeah, Boss?
Willy will show you out.
See that he gets the money first thing in the morning.
Yeah, okay.
Boss, you trust this Negro here?
Hold it, Willy!
You don't have to worry about trusting a dead man.
Cigarettes?
No, thank you, baby.
What else can you offer me?
Well, I'm off at 4:00.
Hey, baby, where's your woman?
Traveling kind of light tonight.
$100 says that back door doesn't lead to the parking lot.
I'm not a gambling woman.
I'm a gambling man.
I thought it was my action you were digging here.
Never took you for a gambler...
...but if that's your meat, that's the door.
You're pushing mighty hard, my man.
Maybe I ought to push the boys in the back who've been taking all your money.
Extend him for another $5,000 and not one cent more, do you understand?
Listen, Gus...
You told me you would take care of Shaft.
That's what I told you.
Well, he's right out there at a ringside table.
He's not here to see the floorshow.
There's gonna be trouble.
That's fine with me.
We made a deal!
And I just called it off.
You see, I made a test run, a sort of a "house call" on Mr. Shaft.
It didn't work out so well.
It cost me a dead second cousin...
...and a friend's kid brother with two hits in the chest.
Aren't you gonna settle the score?
Who's he here to settle with, me or you?
You're a gambler. So am I.
Now, I'm betting that you're Shaft's target for tonight.
Suppose I just let him do his thing, say, knock you off.
You're the one who totaled his girlfriend's big brother.
Come to think of it, why should I do anything to keep you alive?
You haven't even come up with the money you owe me yet.
Tomorrow, I told you! You got it?
Have you considered renewing your partnership with Cal Asby?
Come on, man, he's dead!
Precisely!
You don't know what that dude is into.
He's Bumpy's boy.
You understand that?
They're looking to take over my wheel in Queens.
Shaft's working for Bumpy?
Now you're getting smart.
We'll send Mr. Shaft back to Bumpy...
...with a message they understand uptown.
Let's go.
It's in there.
Let him in.
Are you looking for me?
I've been hearing quite a bit about you,
Mr. Shaft. You're quite a boy.
I prefer "man. "
All right.
"Man. "
What brings you around here?
Forgot to tip your boys when they delivered the flowers.
The only reason I don't spill your guts out right here and now, "man"...
...is that it's easier for me to send you back to Bumpy with my message...
...than to call Western Union.
And the message is:
"You keep the hell out of Queens! "
What round did you go out in, man?
You ain't pretty as you used to be.
You better see a plastic surgeon about your condition.
- What condition?
- Your mouth is too close to your asshole!
Sit down, Shaft. Save your energy.
That's real professional work.
Who did the job?
He was talking when he should've been listening.
Dude named Mascola.
Figured I was working with you.
"Stay out of Queens. " That's what the man said.
What business have I got in Queens?
Has Kelly been here to see you?
Lots of cats come and go around here.
Figured you ought to know,
Kelly's been hanging around with Mascola.
Yeah, that Kelly. He's a busy boy.
Deal here, deal there.
Undesirable character.
Wait outside, Willy.
What do you want from me, Shaft?
I didn't ask you for anything.
Just delivered Mascola's message.
I'll see him tomorrow.
That damn Italian is serious!
Willy! Get your ass in here!
I'm coming, Bumpy!
Used to be cowboys and Indians, now it's us and them!
You call Kelly.
You tell him his loan's been canceled.
And tomorrow you'll go along with Shaft and get that Mascola...
...'cause I want him bad, real bad.
Now, get to it, baby!
You sure were right about that waterbed!
I thought you'd dig that, baby.
$10,000 for this thing!
You have to be kidding!
You want me to look nice, don't you?
What do I care what you look like with your clothes on?
Service.
Haven't you had enough service?
Zip my dress, please.
I have a tendency to spoil you, baby.
Do it, do it, do it.
Is this trip absolutely necessary?
Just wash the window, man.
Again?
You love it.
I love it.
What are they doing in there?
They've already done it.
Now it's our turn.
I've got to go.
You're looking good, baby.
Do your number.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
I'll take the white boy and give anybody 6-to-5...
...it don't go another two rounds.
You got trouble with him, Junior!
Come on, man!
Come on!
What the hell did you come along for, the ride?
I heard you was good. I want to see how good you can do your thing.
Come on!
Cook, Junior!
That's how it's done, Junior.
I ought to step on your damn throat...
...but I'd rather see you and Kelly fry for killing Cal Asby.
And he's my next visit. I owe it to him!
And he owes me!
Like what, $250,000?
I see you've done your homework, boy.
Let's get out of here!
You gonna leave him like that?
A man can fall out the window, you know.
And him, too.
Don't you know we already got enough shit on the sidewalk?
I'm sorry, Gus.
Where the hell were you?
You sent me out to get the peppers.
Did you get the real hot ones?
Yeah, I got the real hot ones.
Good.
I'll tell you what you do.
Take them one at a time...
...and you shove them up your ass!
Have you been keeping this room clean back here?
Tell me, Jesse...
...did you see Mr. Asby the night he was killed?
Yeah, I was straightening up in the chapel.
I heard somebody in here.
I came in to see. It was Mr. Asby, all right.
What was he doing?
Just standing.
And did he have anything with him?
I don't-
Yeah!
I think he did have something with him.
Yeah, I remember. A shopping bag.
Like he had gone to the store and was taking groceries.
Groceries?
That couldn't be, though.
- Why not?
- He didn't have it when he left.
I came out to say goodnight but he had already gone next door...
...to the insurance office.
And he didn't have it with him then.
That's funny.
Nothing in there, Mr. Kelly.
I dust and vacuum these boxes twice every week.
And they're all still here...
...except the one over there that poor Mr. Asby was buried in.
Thank you, Jesse.
Thank you very much.
Stay on their tail.
What the hell do you want?
I thought we was gonna keep in touch.
Didn't you get my message?
I left it on Cal's doorstep.
Yeah.
Where's Arna Asby?
You should've asked that yesterday before Mascola sent her flowers.
I'm asking you now.
Are you gonna protect her or are you gonna hassle her?
You leave that to me.
Now, I know she's here in your pad, and I'm gonna see her.
Open it up.
Be my guest.
Son of a bitch! She'll go to jail for that!
I told you she didn't want to talk.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
That's a very important black lady in there.
You wouldn't want her death on your record.
Especially after protecting her so.
Open this door, Miss Asby!
It's Captain Bollin!
You get away from there!
I don't know who you are!
I'll be back with a warrant and witnesses.
You two better be here!
It's me, baby.
You almost shot a captain.
The man's gonna be back here with a warrant...
...as soon as he can find a judge to sign it.
For me?
No sweat. Gun's registered.
You thought someone was breaking in.
To protect yourself, you picked up the gun and fired a few shots.
But why are they after me?
Nothing personal.
They're after Cal's money and his operation in Queens...
...and anybody who gets in his way including his kid sister and me.
But can't we just let them have it?
You're forgetting the clinic that Cal wanted to build for the kids in Harlem.
The funeral home, the insurance company, it's all good business.
You don't just want to give it away.
When Bollin gets here, that's the captain's name...
...let him in, talk to him, tell him anything you want, but keep him here.
As long as he's here, no one can get to you.
Not now, baby, not now.
Bollin has left his baby-sitters.
What the hell is she doing here?
You sure are a hard man to find!
Too many people looking for me, baby.
Can you drive that thing?
Anything with a stick shift is my meat!
Is that right? How about driving it up a one-way street for me?
All right.
Here's the keys.
Just jump in and start it up.
You left them at the post.
You do that good.
I've been racing since I was 14.
Men or cars?
Baby, keep both hands on the wheel.
Is that snow?
It sure ain't cotton.
What's he doing?
He's digging a grave, Gus.
- Hell of a time! Where've you been?
- Mother Ike's.
Mother Ike's, my ass!
- Mother Ike's, my ass!
- Come on! Come on, I said!
Shithead!
I'll give you "shithead"!
I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Stick with him, do you understand?
We'll be right there.
Get Jack and Al right away.
Jack, get up! Al!
Come on, get your ass up!
Good morning, Mr. Kelly.
What have you got there?
Money.
The money's right there in the box.
I just have to get it out.
Then what, Mr. Kelly?
You'll get what I owe you.
Then it's me and you running the wheel together and everything else.
Go ahead, get it.
Go ahead.
Find it, Mr. Kelly?
Maybe it's in his wallet.
I can't.
Give him a hand.
- Roll it in.
- Come on now!
Roll it in!
Looks like it's payday, Mr. Kelly.
Toss it into the bag. I'll count it later.
That's all of it.
Okay, Kelly.
Come on, Gus. Now wait a minute.
Drop the guns and freeze!
When this starts kicking it won't stop, so nobody get cute!
Who's next?
Move!
Move over there!
Come on, get down here!
All right, let's go!
Get down!
2-4 Whiskey, where the hell are you?
Come in, 2-4 Whiskey, come in!
Careful, Al, the boss is in there!
Harass him, but don't hit him!
I've got to pull out!
Too damn many wires ahead!
Rita, get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Move it! Move it!
Move!
Come on!
We've lost him in the boatyard.
Move! Move it!
Get out of there! Get out!
Get in!
Get up there!
What happened?
The bastard got a boat! Let's go!
Come on! Come on!
We've hit him!
What happened here, Shaft?
Mascola's over there.
Kelly's already at Oakland Cemetery right next to Cal Asby.
And you still got a lot of burying to do.
That's all well and good, but where's the damn money, man?
I don't know.
But I have a feeling it's on it's way back to where it came from. Back to Harlem.
Okay.
Adios.
Adios, mother-

'This spring was the first I felt tired, and realised I was ageing.
'Maybe it was the rotten weather we'd had,
'or the rotten cases I'd had - mostly chasing missing husbands
'and then their wives once I'd found them, to get paid.
'Or maybe it was just the plain fact that I am tired and growing old.
'The only real pleasure
I'd had at all
'was following Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees.
'Well, it's the middle of July now and things are worse than in spring.
'In the spring, I wasn't holed up in a dingy hotel ducking the police. '
Hello.
Let me have Richmond 4421, please.
Lieutenant Nulty, please.
Nulty!
I'm at the Casa Marina, room 502.
Is Moose there?
Come alone.
- I asked if Moose was there.
- And I said come alone.
Two more murders.
That's a total of seven.
Do you know where Marlowe is?
Casa Marina.
He asked me to come alone.
That's not a good idea.
Now, you understand why we want him brought in, don't you?
Yes, Commissioner.
Good.
Wait here.
- How long?
- Until you make Lieutenant.
- Yeah?
- It's Snow White.
- With or without the dwarfs?
- Without.
Come on in.
Malloy with you?
Relax. There's nowhere he could hide, under the bed or...
This case has busted wide open and you're the patsy.
- I wanna tell you...
- It won't change anything.
You gonna listen or aren't you?
Sit down, will you?
Sit down!
I was working on a $25-a-day breeze, looking for a 15-year-old runaway from Carmel - an honours student, majoring in men.
She had all "A's", none of them on a report card.
She had only one other interest - dancing.
 It seems to me
I've heard that song before
 It's from an old familiar score
 I know it well...
It's funny how a theme recalls a favourite dream
 A dream... 
You know, you remind me of Harry.
You're very much like Harry.
The same type - strong and silent.
I used to dance with Harry like this.
I may not be the most beautiful girl... but I could make a man as happy...
Really upset when it ended, but I got over it.
- What did you say your name was?
- Harry.
My parents sent you, didn't they?
I'm not going.
Look, do you want to dance your way out, walk out, or be carried out?
Makes no difference to me.
Do you realise we missed a dinner party to drive here from Carmel to get you?
Can't you settle that on the way?
There's the matter of $25 plus $5 in expenses.
Pay him, Charles.
And give him a tip.
I don't accept tips for finding kids.
Pets, yes -
$5 for dogs, $10 for elephants...
Thank you.
Get in the car.
Next time she runs away, get somebody else.
'I was tryin' to stabilise below the belt
'when this guy the size of the
Statue of Liberty walks up to me. '
What are you, a cop?
No, I'm your fairy godmother.
'I started to walk away... '
Private dick, huh?
'when a hand I could have sat in took hold of my shoulder. '
What's your name?
Marlowe, what's yours?
- Moose Malloy.
- Get down!
'He didn't bat an eye.
Fear wasn't built into his frame. '
I want you to work for me.
You want me to find the guys who were tryin' to shoot you?
I want you to find my Velma.
I ain't seen her in seven years.
She ain't wrote in six.
Where the hell have you been for seven years?
In the can.
The Great Bend bank robbery?
Eighty grand?
I did it solo.
Ain't that somethin'?
Yeah.
I want you to find my Velma.
Look, man, that's a long time not to hear.
- She'll have a reason.
- Sure.
Why the hell were they shootin' at you?
Maybe we ought to go to Florian's.
That's the last place Velma worked.
What was she like... this, um... Velma?
Cute.
Cute as lace pants.
That's somethin' to go on.
'He walked me slowly across half of LA until we got downtown. '
Hello, Momma, how you doin'?
You the last of the good time Charlies...
This is a coloured neighbourhood now it's been that way for a long time.
Let's you and me go up.
Maybe nibble a couple.
They might know something about my Velma.
How the hell would they know anything? It's a coloured joint.
Let's you and me go on up, huh?
OK, but leave off carryin' me.
I can walk by myself.
I go to the bathroom by myself and everything.
Uh-oh, look who's here.
A shine palace.
52 years old and ain't never had enough of nothin', but used...
What did I do this time?
I'm looking for a white girl named Velma.
Hey, Henry.
No white boys here, brother.
Just for the coloured.
I'm looking for Velma.
Velma, you says? No Velma here.
No hooch, no girls, no nothing.
Just scram, white boy. Just scram.
Velma used to work here.
Velma USED to work here.
Velma done retired.
Send him home, Henry.
You shouldn't laugh.
Maybe I should do this.
Well... looks like you just may have the lonely job of spending that eighty grand all by yourself.
Now, you goin' to tell me where your boss is?
Mr Montgomery is in the back.
Big fella.
Can I speak to you a minute,
Mr Montgomery?
- What's that?
- A sawn-off.
That's illegal. Besides,
I don't think it'd stop him anyway.
All I wanted to know was where my Velma is.
He tried to tell me with this.
Jesus! You've had a busy day.
It's a good thing you don't get out of the slammer too often.
- I want you to find my Velma.
- Yeah, I will.
Meanwhile... ah, maybe you'd better beat it, huh?
Because the cops might think you've sprained your parole.
You got somethin' there.
I'll keep in touch.
- I'm in the telephone book.
- OK.
- Help me find my Velma, huh?
- Yeah.
Hey, ah... Malloy?
This Velma. She got a last name?
Valento. Velma Valento.
Velma Valento.
'The fifty bucks felt snug against my ribs.
'The joint had emptied out,
'so I called you, Nulty, and had a few drinks.
'Mr Montgomery didn't seem to mind. '
Right here, fellas.
Big, black and dead.
35 minutes.
That's not bad for a killing.
Lucky it wasn't somethin' serious.
Don't worry about it Marlowe.
It's just another shine killing.
No space in the papers, no pictures, no nothin'.
Your picture will be in the papers - front, sideways, back, numbers, don't you worry about it.
No sweat.
It was self-defence, Nulty.
The guy that killed him is your... client?
Yeah, that's right.
When he gets in touch, tell him come to the station, sign a deposition.
Oh, he can write, can't he?
Oh, yeah... he might be a little shy.
For that kind of a killing who cares? You explain it to him.
We gotta follow procedure or I get in trouble... with Eleanor Roosevelt.
Eleanor Roosevelt.
'I couldn't find any Florian in the phone book
'but I had a vague hunch about the fleabag across the street.
'I sparred with the night clerk for a minute,
'but it was like tryin' to open a busted sardine can.
'Abraham Lincoln's picture loosened him up. '
I'm looking for anybody that knows the place across the street...
Florians?
When it was a white joint?
There's a man, played in the band, upstairs in room 210.
Is there an elevator around here?
- If it is, I ain't seen it.
- Thanks.
'The corridor gave me the willies.
'It was the kind of place
I've always dreaded I'd wind up in,
'alone and broke. '
Who is it?
My name is Philip Marlowe.
I'm a private investigator.
I'm not with the City, the State or the Feds.
I'm not with any collection agency.
I'm looking for a... Florian. You used to work for him, didn't you?
Come in.
Thank you.
- Please, sit down.
- Thanks.
The clerk tells me you used to have a band across the street.
Yeah. Tommy Ray and the Sunrays.
I had a couple of records.
You ever hear 'em?
- What you play?
- Trumpet.
This, um... Florian, did he have a first name?
Mike.
- Know where I can find him?
- He's dead.
Was he married?
Could be.
Know where she lives?
What's in it for you?
- A job.
- Who for?
A fellow's tryin' to find a Velma Valento.
Remember her? She worked there too.
I didn't know they had names.
This, um... Mrs Florian have a first name?
Jessie.
You... ah, don't know where I could find her, huh?
Couple of bucks in it.
Well, if it comes back to you... get in touch, eh?
You never know.
So long.
Mister! Mister!
- Hey mister, my daddy wants you.
- What for?
- Are you a policeman?
- No. Are you?
- No. I'm a baseball player.
- A baseball player. Come 'ere.
'Tommy Ray said she was listed under her maiden name, Jessie Halstead.
'Turned out she was living in a dried-out brown house
'with a dried-out brown lawn.
'He told me a pint of bourbon could be my best friend.
'I wondered if I should add it to the expenses. '
Hello. Anybody home?
Mrs Florian?
Jessie Florian?
Tommy Ray says you are.
That a fact? You got a name?
Oh.
Marlowe.
I'm a, ah... private detective.
Can't be about Mike, he was put in a coffin four years ago.
I feel like a fly out here.
Come on in.
I didn't have time to get fixed up or nothin'.
All the company I got.
At least it doesn't give you an argument.
Yeah.
Well, Philip Marlowe, private investigator.
Come in.
Tommy Ray still living across the street with that nigger he married and that kid?
Yeah, same place.
Just about ruined him in show business, marryin' a nigger.
He come to Mike's funeral.
What d'you want to know?
I'm looking for a girl.
Velma. Velma Valento.
A hot day, huh? Funny, when I'm thirsty it's all I can think about.
It just so happens I, ah...
Ooh! Careful mister.
Don't want to be dropping anything this valuable.
Why don't you, ah... step out and get us a couple of glasses?
- Take a load off your feet.
- Thanks.
Velma. You know,
I was in show business too.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Did a... song and dance act.
That's how I met Mike.
I used to work for him.
He had a nice place for entertainment.
I sure miss the business.
Anyway...
Jessie Harry.
That was my, ah... That was my name.
I was good.
Had an agent and everything.
Hmm.
Did you ever catch my act?
No, I don't believe I ever did.
 I'm blue all day Monday
 Thinkin' of you Sunday
 That's one day when I'm with you
It seems like I cried all day Tuesday
 I died all day Wednesday
 Oh, my, how I long for you
 And then comes Thursday... 
I was good, honest I was.
I'm sure you were.
Better than Velma. Maybe not as pretty, but I had a lot of pep.
It's funny, she was the only tramp ever worked for Mike that he didn't use like a mattress.
Oh? How come?
I guess he was afraid. She had this boyfriend, a half-crazy hooligan.
Built like a beer truck -
Moose Malloy. He's in the can.
Hmm... I get it.
He's out of the can and he's lookin' for her, huh?
You, ah... wouldn't have any idea where Velma is, would you?
But I can find out.
If I like a guy, ceiling's the limit.
How about another drink?
Sure.
This stuff dies painless with me.
Don't know what hit it.
You wouldn't happen to have a picture of her around, would you?
But Tommy Ray must have one.
He didn't even know her name.
Why would he say that?
What was the name of that hotel again?
Crescent.
Tommy Ray, please.
Tommy! Jessie Florian.
Oh, it's OK, it's OK. He's here.
'It took her nearly ten minutes to convince Tommy Ray I was kosher.
'Then I went back to Ray's hotel to get a picture of Velma
'that he'd held out on me. '
Andrew, got that picture?
'I figured there were plenty of girls as cute as lace pants,
'who'd passed through Hollywood in the last seven years.
'Most of them had taken those pants off while tryin' to make it.
'A friend who ran a club gave me an agent's name who knew most of them.
Cute little redhead.
Song and dance gal.
I never forget a face.
Nice legs, too.
And generous with 'em.
But it's not a Velma.
It's a...
Linda! Linda... Gilbert.
What happened to her?
Did a couple of Busby Berkeley pictures, then she went nuts.
But I really mean... ah, nuts.
Where is she?
Camarillo.
May I?
'Changing her name to Linda Gilbert didn't help her make it,
'or keep her out of an asylum.
'When I saw her I knew why she hadn't contacted Moose.
'She wasn't getting in touch with anybody ever.
'I'd found Velma in only two days.
DiMaggio was doing pretty good too.
'He'd now hit in 33 straight games.
'Nine away from the consecutive game hitting record. '
Hi, Mr Marlowe.
Kiss your five bucks goodbye,
Georgie.
Di Maggio's going all the way.
We'll see. He's got nine more games to go. Each game gets tougher.
I know what pressure is, Mr Marlowe.
One time I won 19 straight.
So you better watch how you spend that five bucks.
- What about this Hitler?
- What about him?
- He invaded Russia.
- So did Napoleon.
It's a lot easier than hitting a 42 straight, right?
Read all about it.
Hitler invades Russia.
'I was thinking
I was out of work again,
'with my bank account still under a duck,
'when I smelled my next client. '
You're Philip Marlowe, private detective?
Check.
'He smelled great. '
Come on in.
You've been recommended to me as someone who can be trusted to say, ah... keep his mouth shut.
I'd like to discuss a matter.
My name's Lindsay Marriott.
Sit down.
Well, what's the problem?
It's a... very slight matter.
I'm meeting some men tonight to pay them. I want someone with me.
Do you carry a gun?
- Sometimes.
- You won't need it.
I'd probably be better off going alone... but I'm not much of a hero.
And I'll be carrying a... large amount of money.
Yours?
No. I'm acting for a friend.
You want your hand holding?
I don't like your manner.
I get a lot of complaints about that. Who recommended me?
I have to confess that... I picked your name out of the phone book.
Well, why didn't you take the Triple A Detective Agency?
Or any that come before me?
I liked your name best.
Really, I did. It's strong.
OK, go ahead.
Have you heard of Fei Tsui jade?
- No.
- It's the only kind of real value.
A few nights ago, a friend was wearing a necklace of it... and she was held up.
- What's it worth?
- Well over a hundred thousand.
What's the plan?
Go where I'm told, hand over the package of money and receive the necklace back.
How much?
$15,000, that's why I decided to have you with me.
And I'm willing to pay you a hundred dollars.
Now, wait a minute,
You want to go off and park in some dark petting place.
There's only one problem.
By now this thing's been very well planned.
There's not much likelihood of them roughing you up, as long as you play ball.
But I don't think they'll like the idea of twins, one of us might get hurt.
Not much I can do, Mr Marriott.
However, I will take your $100 and tag along for the ride.
I'll carry the shopping money.
That means you'll come.
What the hell, you're goofy about my name.
Speaking of names, this friend of yours, what's her name?
I'd prefer not to mention it.
- Meet me at Beach Road at eight.
- Check.
At eight, then.
Hey!
I like your name too.
Been judging a flower show in here, Marlowe?
That the winning daffodil that just walked out?
I'd a hunch you'd be around, so I sprayed.
You said Malloy would come see me when he called.
Just pretend you're a detective and figure out what happened.
Can we talk alone?
He makes me nervous.
I feel I should be slippin' him a Finn.
I don't have to take that shit from you, Marlowe.
Wait outside. Come on, wait outside!
And don't steal the doorknobs.
I need Malloy. I gotta bring him in.
The heat's on from upstairs.
What happens if you don't?
They gonna take that new suit?
Why do you care about him?
Since King Kong, I've been a sucker for any gorilla who falls in love.
I'll nail you for aiding and abetting.
Aiding what? You've got a dead
Negro. Nobody cares. What's changed?
Who tried to kill Malloy?
We're working on it.
Who's in charge, Billy Rolfe?
What's that mean?
Malloy's girl is in the booby hatch.
My nose is twitching, that's what.
An ex-con kills a coloured fella in self-defence, you wash your hands.
Suddenly you want to get him.
Come on, Nulty, level with me.
I don't expect that crooked son of a bitch to level, but you!
We're police and you're a private dick.
We could take your license.
Remember that!
I'll tie a string around my finger.
Oh, jeez, Marlowe.
Call me when he gets in touch.
'I started to think of ways
I could tell Moose about Velma,
'but none of them were any good.
'I forced myself to think of my new client, Marriott.
'And I knew one thing: as soon as someone says you didn't need a gun,
'you'd better take one along that worked.
'I was having some Chinese food when a dark shadow fell on my chop suey. '
You found my Velma yet?
Yeah, I found her.
Where is she?
Moose, I'm sorry,
I really am, but...
She's dead?
She might as well be.
She's in Camarillo... and she ain't coming out.
- You're lying.
- I wish I was.
It's somebody else.
It's Velma.
I told you it was somebody else.
I want you to find my Velma.
You mean that's not her?
No more funny stuff, huh?
Hey Moose, wait a minute...
Is there something...
'Why had Tommy Ray given me a phoney picture? I wanted to find out. '
He ain't been here all day.
It's just not like him.
Is my daddy comin' back?
'I was bailing out some rich dame's necklace.
'but I couldn't get that kid's face out of my mind.
'I stopped twice to find out if Tommy Ray had returned.
'He hadn't. '
Here's your fee and the 15,000 we discussed.
Right.
We're to make the exchange at the barrier at the bottom of the canyon.
OK.
You hop in the back.
Get down out of sight.
They may be watching all the way.
This car sticks out like spats at an Iowa picnic.
Well, there's the barrier.
Aren't they here?
Shh! Get down. Keep quiet.
Looks like a try-out to see if you'll obey orders.
That can't be.
- I'm going to take a look around.
- No!
Don't you want your $100's worth?
- They said stay near the car.
- I'm not going far.
Why'd he come to you?
He got my name out of the telephone book.
- Think we believe that?
- Found your card on him.
They're free with bubble gum.
You left your car on Beach Road?
Why was it at Marriott's?
- Obviously somebody drove it there.
- What happened to the $15,000?
I bought Defence Bonds.
Let's start again, huh?
From the beginning.
Why don't I make it easy on us and tell you what you want?
This fairy hired me to exchange a necklace for cash.
We drove to the woods,
I shot him, buried the $15,000, drove to his place, walked 15 miles back, knocked myself out and called the police.
- We could book you now.
- Go ahead.
What do you THINK happened?
Marriott wanted the money and figured me for the fall guy.
Yeah, then killed himself.
He had an accomplice who was to knock us out and take the money.
Instead, he killed Marriott, not me, cos he figured you'd fit me into the frame.
It fits the facts.
It's a theory, anyway.
Lieutenant, the Commissioner wants to see you.
Bring him in my office.
You're in over your head this time, Marlowe.
Maybe so. If I am, what are you going to charge me to fix it?
I don't think I can, Marlowe.
Even if I wanted to.
You can go now. We'll find out more about Marriott before we need you.
And forget about Malloy.
What do you mean?
He's lammed to Mexico.
- Who says?
- The Commissioner.
Well, now...
I said lay off the case!
That's a little more like it.
Right on the line. No more of that lammed to Mexico bullshit.
How come Nulty? Why?
Get outta here, Marlowe.
And remember, I warned you.
'It didn't matter you were going to look into Marriott's murder, Nulty.
'I still had a job to do.
'Marriott hired me to protect him,
I let him down.
'As far as I was concerned,
I was still working for him.
'Most of the fences I knew
'wanted to smell my breath when I mentioned Fei Tsui jade,
'but one sent me to a joint in Chinatown. '
Yes?
Fei Tsui jade.
- You got?
- No.
I no got. I want.
- Everybody want.
- Who got?
Only big collector got.
- Who?
- Grayle.
Baxter Wilson Grayle?
He got.
Thanks.
'Judge Baxter Wilson Grayle,
'the most powerful political figure in LA for a quarter of a century.
'His butler kept saying the judge was unavailable,
'until I said I was the last person to see Lindsay Marriott alive.
'The house wasn't much, it was smaller than Buckingham Palace
'and had fewer windows than the Chrysler Building. '
Mr Marlowe. Come this way, please.
Thank you.
Hello, Mr Marlowe.
Hello.
'Her hair was the colour of gold in old paintings.
'She had a full set of curves which nobody had been able to improve on.
'She was giving me the kinda look
I could feel in my hip pocket. '
This is my husband,
Judge Grayle, Mr Marlowe.
Please sit down, Mr Marlowe.
Mix Mr Marlowe a drink, Nelson.
Yes, ma'am.
- You're not what I expected.
- In what way?
The last person to see poor Lindsay,
I thought would be a friend.
- If you know what I mean.
- He just asked me to tag along.
He had to ransom a Fei Tsui jade necklace stolen from a friend.
- Thank you.
- That'll be all, Nelson.
I'm a private detective.
I understand you, ah... collect
Fei Tsui jade, Mr Grayle?
I have a very fine collection, but nothing's been stolen.
He said it was from a woman.
I wonder what he had in mind.
We only have one necklace.
- Oh, priceless?
- Mm-hm.
You don't have to bother with this, honey. You should get some rest.
I think I will go lie down a while.
Glad to have met you,
Mr Marlowe.
Thank you, sir.
Mr Grayle hasn't been feeling well for some time. He tires easily.
Hell, I like drinking.
Was he an old friend, Mr Marriott?
Sort of.
He accompanied me places.
Well, Lindsay had to tell me something to get me to go along.
You're a very good-looking man to be in this kinda business.
Well, I hope you don't hold that against me.
Poor Lin.
He was rather a heel, but to die like that is terrible.
- Did you trust him?
- Yes.
Why?
I don't know, I trust some people.
I trust you.
Why don't you come here and sit beside me?
I've been thinking about that for some time.
Ever since you first crossed your legs, to be exact.
These damn things are always up around your neck.
Do you do this sort of thing often?
No, I'm usually pretty busy... at the monastery, praying with the other monks.
How long did you know Marriott?
Oh, years. I liked him.
I'd like to know who killed him.
Would you find out?
I'll pay you, of course. A lot.
- A lot?
- Mm-hm.
Marriott lived like he had a lot. He wasn't borrowing from you, was he?
You're a little old-fashioned, aren't you?
Your name's Phil, isn't it?
Philip, what's yours?
Helen, kiss me.
Who was that?
- That was Mr Grayle.
- Forget him.
I'm trying to.
He understands.
What the hell can he expect?
I know, he tires easily.
I tell you, it's all right.
He's a sick man.
You'd never know from the muscle he carries in this town.
That kind of muscle you can use from a wheelchair.
- Where can I call you?
- I'm in the telephone book.
- What's wrong?
- There's nothing wrong.
Oh, jeez, you are old-fashioned, aren't you?
From the waist up.
'After I'd parked my car and started for my office,
'I realised
I'd forgotten to tune in the news.
'The Yankees were in Washington against the Senators.
'DiMaggio would break the record if he hit in both games.
'I couldn't wait to get to my radio. '
Howdy.
Howdy.
'I thought I recognised the smile,
'but I knew there was nothing
I could do about it.
'This phone kept ringing.
It was driving me nuts.
'I prayed someone would answer it.
'I didn't realise it was ringing inside my head. '
Where you want him?
Sit him down, sit him over there.
'I'd once seen a photo of Francis
Amthor, LA's famous madam.
'And there she was... in the flesh. '
Hey. Did I deliver, huh?
Go on, honey.
OK, girls.
Nice to meet you, Mr Marlowe.
I'm so glad you could make it.
Nice to have a night out with the boys.
Please, don't smoke, Mr Marlowe.
I don't like it.
Honey, go on to your room.
I just wanna speak to Moose Malloy.
I'm only gonna ask you once.
I told you. I don't like smoke.
Who told you to get up?
I think you're a very stupid person.
You look stupid, you're in a stupid business and you're on a stupid case.
I get it, I'm stupid.
You shouldn't have done that,
Marlowe.
'The room was full of smoke.
'The smoke hung straight up in the air in thin lines.
'Straight up and down like a curtain of small, clear beads.
'It didn't dissolve, didn't float off, didn't move.
'It was a grey web, woven by a thousand spiders.
'I wondered how they'd got them to work together.
"'OK, Marlowe", I said. "You're a tough guy. Six feet of iron man.
"'190 pounds stripped and with your face washed.
"'Hard muscles and no glass jaw.
You can take it.
"'You've been sat down twice.
"'You've been shot full of hop
"'until you're as crazy as two waltzing mice.
"'Now what does all that amount to?
Routine.
"'Now let's see you do something really tough, like gettin' up. "
'I crawled along the floor, thinking:
"'How the hell can I get under that door?"
'I sensed somebody else in the room.
'I wished it was part of my nightmare, but it wasn't.
'It was Tommy Ray.
He'd never blow another horn.
'I was torn between making myself walk
'and wanting to lie down on the bed.
'It was a lovely bed.
It was made of rose leaves.
'It was the most beautiful bed in the world.
'They'd got it from Carole Lombard.
It was too soft for her.
'I was still fighting it, though, still walking.
'Then some footsteps I heard made up my mind for me.
'I had to get back into bed, like it or not.
'I decided to play dead. I didn't have to be a hell of an actor. '
Come on, hillbilly, rise and shine.
Come on, Amthor wants you.
Hey, you ain't croaked, are you?
'If I had any sense, I would've tried to get out of there.
'But sometimes I'm short on sense.
'All I could think of was getting my hands on Francis Amthor.
'It was an old house,
'built as they don't build them any more.
'Fitting and proper for housing the oldest profession. '
Uh-huh. No, no.
That buzzer's no good tonight.
I put one of your boys to sleep.
You've been a very sick man, sir.
I can't recommend you being up and around yet.
I may look sick, but don't let that fool you.
I'm in a rare mood tonight.
I can hear the banshees calling.
I haven't shot anybody in a month.
Whisky?
Nah, you first.
I've run out of trust in this joint.
To your health, sir.
What remains of it.
I had a nightmare.
Silly idea, I dreamt I was shot full of dope and locked up in a room.
They knocked me on the head and took me some place where they did that to me.
I vaguely remember somebody asking about Moose Malloy.
You were saying?
I made no remark.
What's so important about Malloy?
Why was Marriott killed?
What's the matter?
Cathouse got your tongue?
What the hell is it about Malloy?
Look, this is a gun.
When you got a gun on you, you're supposed to do what you're told.
Not when you're about ready to collapse.
What is it? What?
Tell me, come on. What do you want?
Johnny's with your Doris.
Wait a minute, where do you think... Stop!
You goddamned tramp!
What have you done to me!
Move it, move it. Let's go!
Where's my robe?
'I had only one place to go, Nulty.
'And I prayed to God that I could make it.
Georgie!
Jeez!
You look like you went 10 rounds with Joe Louis.
- Did DiMaggio do it?
- Sure.
Thanks, Georgie.
Ha! Ha!
Thanks, Georgie.
So long, Mr Marlowe.
'I went back to my office after a week,
'after the toughest few minutes of my life,
'telling Tommy Ray's wife she was a widow,
'and the kid that his daddy was gone forever.
'But DiMaggio was still going strong... on his own record, now.
'Would he hit safely in every game forever? It seemed that way.
'And why not? He was only 26 and playing baseball in the sunshine.
'He heard little boys cheer... not cry. '
Hello.
It's me.
I began to think you'd won the Irish sweepstakes and took off.
Ha! What else were you thinking?
- Thinking about tonight.
- What about tonight?
The White Orchid. There's a private party honouring my husband.
This is an election year.
I can't very well get out of it.
Why don't you meet me there around nine?
You're on. Nine o'clock. Bye.
A bourbon on the rocks and a scotch on the rocks.
You're right on time.
Your husband has a lot of friends.
Well, everyone in politics does... enemies too.
What about Burnette?
Is he friend or foe?
Friend.
He owns this club.
- Do you know Laird?
- Yeah.
A lot of us in the DA's office thought of him as a hood.
- And the DA?
- He thought I oughta leave.
How did you meet?
He owns a top-rate gambling boat off-limits.
I think Baxter helped him straighten out a problem with the water taxis.
Mr Burnette would like a word with you, Mr Marlowe. It's important.
Go on, Philip. I'll be back.
Nice to see you, Marlowe.
You look good.
You're cute, too.
We go back a long way. To the time you wanted to see me spanked.
- I still do.
- What for?
All I do is run towns, elect judges and mayors, corrupt police, peddle dope, ice old ladies with pearls.
Well, you're mixing with some pretty fancy people now, aren't you?
Well, yeah...
You're not doing so bad yourself.
You're the first guy I've seen with
Judge Grayle's wife who wasn't...
About that guy, Marriott, did you know him well?.
She's the one who gambles, he just tagged along.
OK, what's so important?
I need a little help. You ever do a job, no questions asked?
There's always one question.
How much?
Fine.
Two grand.
Two grand! What for?
I wanna talk to Moose Malloy.
Hah! I don't blame you.
He's so gay, witty and charming.
What's the matter?
Can't your boys find him?
No. The police can't either.
I have friends, Marlowe.
That's how I know
Moose is your client.
I've only seen him twice.
That's more than anybody else.
Two thousand dollars?
It's gotta be some talk.
If you're worried about his health, you can be there.
How nice. As a mediator, or to stop the bleeding?
Buy yourself a new suit, Marlowe.
- Mrs Grayle.
- Hello, Laird.
I'll be on my boat.
- I'll see you...
- Sooner the better, Marlowe.
Where to?
- To my place?
- What for?
We've got everything we need with you.
'She was incredibly beautiful.
And she was something, Nulty,
'really something.
'I had no intention of letting Moose in a room with Burnette,
'but there was something going on.
What?
'Taking the money was the best way to keep in. '
'Two close misses.
He had to be real good to do that.
'Good enough to hit... if you wanted to.
'Somebody put a show on for me.
'Why?
'My car was being fixed when
I got the call from Mrs Florian.
'It was Sunday and I'd been hanging around hoping to hear from Moose.
'I suggested we talk on the phone... Stupid!
'You can't pour bourbon on the phone. '
Thanks.
Where you been? I've been tryin' to reach you for days.
I've been sick.
In a hospital?.
Yeah. Pet hospital.
Hey, take it easy on me, will you?
Your friend, ah... Tommy Ray... he got killed.
What?! My God!
Why?
You know... he gave me a phoney picture of Velma.
I been in touch with Velma.
How'd you find her?
Through the grapevine.
Sure it was her?
Honey, I never forget a voice.
OK, the next time you talk...
She won't talk to no one but Moose.
I'd like to talk to him.
It's been two weeks.
What'll I tell her?
She call every day?
Same time?
Don't let on to the Moose it was me tipped you off.
No, no. Look... the next time he gets in touch,
I'll call you, give you his number.
So she can call him direct, right?
- Don't go so soon.
- I've got to, honey.
Let me have a rain check.
'I was followed for the next couple of days, but it didn't bother me.
'I knew I was safe while nobody found the Moose.
'As long as he breathed,
I breathed. '
Hey, Georgie. Keep an eye on that car. Tell me if you see it again.
- Hello?
- This is Moose Malloy. Remember?
Remember Yeah, somewhat
Where you been hiding?
Where nobody found me.
Those are the best places.
Listen, Velma wants to talk to you.
You found my Velma?
Almost... She'll only talk to you.
We have to wait for her call.
Where?
I could come to you.
I wouldn't like that.
Well... OK, I'll think of something.
Listen, how well do you know
Laird Brunette?
Never heard of him.
How about Baxter Wilson Grayle?
- How many people is that?
- One.
I never heard of him.
I just thought of a place.
'I called Mrs Florian, left Georgie's number,
'now it was up to Velma.
'I had lots of questions for Moose, but he had one thing on his mind. '
Why don't she call?.
How the hell do I know?
You said my Velma would call.
I've been slapped, scratched, punched, knocked unconscious, drugged and shot at looking for Velma... so quit tryin' to make a milkshake out of my insides.
Stop it!
Hello?
'It only took a second to know who it was,
'you could see the seven years inside melting off him. '
Hiya, babe.
It's been a long time.
15 minutes.
I got it.
Yeah.
Here.
Pay me back when you can.
Come on, I'll drop you off.
Thanks.
See you later, Georgie.
So long, Mr Marlowe.
'It was one of those transient motels,
'something between a fleabag and a dive.
'I felt like seeing Velma myself,
'but this was a real moment for the big guy,
'and three would be a crowd.
'If ever anything didn't belong...
'that car in the alley was it. '
Moose! Get down!
Phew!
'I'd hit them, but I didn't know if they were dead or alive.
'But that didn't stop Moose.
He was checking for his Velma. '
You were set up, Moose.
Don't you understand?
She said she'd be here.
Who's tryin' to get to you, Moose?
What's goin' on?
Was there somebody else in the robbery?
Are they tryin' to shut you up, or what?
They must have my Velma somewhere.
Who? Moose, tell me, WHO?
'He showed his appreciation in his usual, gentle manner. '
Supposed to call me when he got in touch, remember?
The Commissioner told me lay off, remember?
Don't be such a wise-ass. We could charge you with three murders.
Recognise him?
No, why don't you ask Marlowe?
I bet there's not a state they're not wanted in.
You're like a slot machine, Marlowe.
You'll do anything for six bits.
What's his girl's name?
- Velma.
- Think they got to her?
- Could be.
- How?
Come on.
Jessie?
Jessie?
Jesus, what a way to live.
Maybe she beat it.
This is the kind of place
Jessie Florian beats it to, Nulty.
This is all she's got.
Look at those neck bruises.
You look at 'em.
Jeez, what a way to die.
Marlowe.
Marlowe!
This card which you found on Marriott's body.
It's the same one
I gave to Jessie Florian.
Then they knew each other.
Moose got in touch last night. He's worried about Velma, wanted to talk.
- You get anything from him?
- Not much.
I figure they called Mrs Florian after they missed killing Moose.
Who are they?
Whoever THEY are, they knew he'd go to Mrs Florian's looking for Velma.
So they gave her a new radio, a couple of bottles, she came cheap.
They asked her to call when Moose showed up.
Only I showed up instead.
But... she made the call anyway.
They got Tommy Ray to give me a phoney picture to keep me busy.
They got Velma to call Moose.
They might've been holding Velma since Moose got out.
Why?
You don't think anybody else's voice would've got Moose to that motel?.
That was the end of Tommy Ray and Mrs Florian.
Probably Velma herself's pushing up daisies now.
Why are you telling me all this?
Because I'm going out on that boat with Malloy.
I don't think I'm coming back alive without the cops.
If I went on that boat
I'd get busted.
At least you're honest about it.
An honest cop.
I'm supposed to bring you in!
If I let you go... If, Marlowe...
I'd be sticking my neck WAY out.
Thanks, Nulty, but that's not what I need. What I need is another drink.
I need a lotta life insurance, a home in the country!
I need a vacation! I'm tired!
Everything I touch turns to shit!
I've got a hat, a coat and a gun, that's it.
We've known each other a long time, Nulty.
You've got to let me go or Tommy
Ray's kid will haunt me for life for letting them kill his old man.
He will, you know.
Does Burnette know you're coming?
Not unless you tell him.
Give me five minutes to start back to town, then do anything you want.
Hey, Nulty,
- Thanks.
- Sure.
'I had Moose meet me at a penny arcade outside the hotel.
'Then we went to meet Georgie who'd got us a boat. '
I think I found a boat for you.
I didn't tell 'em anything,
Mr Marlowe.
Where's the boat, Georgie?
Out there.
Can you get us aboard the Lido?
The water taxis will take you.
I don't like taxis.
I'll take you for a good enough reason.
How much is the reason?
$50, $10 extra if you bleed in my boat.
See you later, Georgie.
Let's go.
'Marriott dead, Mrs Florian dead,
Tommy Ray dead, Francis Amthor dead.
'Only Burnette, with his $2,000 wish to see Moose, was left.
'The answer had to be on that boat. '
Turn around, we're going on the boat.
Pull over, Hank. Stop the car.
Are you crazy?
Seven people are dead, Rolfe, SEVEN!
And the police are driving away.
You're talkin' about Burnette's boat, we gotta tell him.
- Marlowe's not worth...
- Not worth what?
Missing our weekly pick-up?
Who would you turn back for?
Your father, mother, wife or kids?
Or is Brunette the only one?
Look, I'm outta here. You've got a little too much religion for me.
Anybody else want to get out?
Don't try to warn anyone. If you do and we get out of this, you're dead.
Come on, Hank. Turn on that siren.
This is a police car.
What are you doing down here?
Ahh!
You gonna take us to Burnette now?
Burnette's in San Diego.
Whoa!
Now would you take us?
OK, put me down, I'll take you.
Tell him to open the door.
Hey, boss, it's me, Nick, open up.
Boss?
Are you in there, boss?
No. I fell overboard.
It's me, Nicky!
It's important.
What's so important?
Ahh!
Just keep the body where we can see it, Burnette.
You want to see me?
What do you have in mind, Burnette?
You gonna run Moose for Mayor?
Or tell him why you tried to drill him after he spoke to Velma?
- You know where Velma is?
- I don't know any Velma.
I'd stop lyin'.
Keep away from me, Marlowe.
You'd better start talkin', fast.
You can come out now, Mrs Grayle, you're missing all the fun.
Helen, come on out.
Come on out, Helen.
Hi, babe. Long time no see.
You're looking great, babe.
Hello, Moose.
Well, hooray
Now it all makes sense, everything.
Velma from the gutter, whore from Amthor's.
Take away his gun, honey, and we can go.
Don't you understand?
Prostitute marries millionaire judge.
Knows nothing about her background, not even that she was in a robbery and let her boyfriend take the rap.
I've got the eighty thousand,
Moose, just like I said.
She's lying, Moose. She and Burnette cooked up the whole thing.
Only two other people knew who she had married, Amthor and Marriott.
They're both dead.
Amthor told Burnette one of her girls married a judge, that was enough.
Everything was hunky-dory,
Moose, till now.
Take his gun, honey.
After they'd missed killing you on the street...
Hold it right there, Moose.
They sent me and Marriott on some cock-and-bull story and killed him because they were afraid he'd crack.
Shut him up, Moose.
He's making it all up.
Moose, even a band leader for Christ's sake, a friend of hers, he got wiped out!
Don't you see, Moose?
She's using everybody!
Why?
OK, dragon-lady, who's next?
Hey, boss, are you in there?
It's me, Mickey and the boys.
We're out here!
You OK, boss?
You'll never get off this boat alive.
Hold it, police!
Open up, Marlowe. It's me, Nulty.
'Moose never would've hurt her.
'It didn't matter to him she hadn't written in six years.
'It didn't matter that she turned him in for a reward.
'The big lug loved her.
'And if he was still alive,
'it wouldn't matter that she'd pumped three bullets into him.
'What a world. '
Come on, Marlowe, open up, it's me, Snow White.
Let him in.
You're a hero, Nulty. Headlines.
This is no misdemeanour, like a coloured killing.
You'll probably wind up being Commissioner.
What happened?
Let him tell you, I'm too tired.
'Bagby and Smith,
'a couple of run-of-the-mill pitchers, stopped DiMaggio.
'Maybe they had a little extra last night. Like Nulty had tonight.
'I had two grand inside my breast pocket that needed a home.
'And I knew just the place. '
"Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn."
"Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed."
"Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land."
"Let him not breed in great numbers,
"for he will make a desert of his home, and yours."
"Shun him... for he is the harbinger of death."
Nova.
- Where will you go?
- Follow the shoreline.
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.
Of that I'm sure.
All my life I've awaited your coming and dreaded it.
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.
Your breed made a desert of it ages ago.
It still doesn't give me the why.
A planet where apes evolved from men.
There's gotta be an answer.
Don't look for it, Taylor.
You may not like what you find.
Zira. Cornelius. Untie me.
- What will he find out there, Doctor?
- His destiny.
Damn you all to hell!
- Food...
- No. No, no, skipper. It's me again.
Just me.
- Brent...
- Sir?
- Did you contact Earth?
- I tried to, sir. Not a crackle.
Skipper, I took an Earth time reading just before reentry.
What'd you get?
Three thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five.
- AD.
- Almighty God.
Well, we were following
Taylor's trajectory.
Whatever happened to us must have happened to him.
What about us? Where are we?
Well, in my opinion, skipper, we've passed through a Hasslein Curve, a bend in time.
I don't know what planet we're on, but the fact is, we're both of us here, we're breathing, we're conscious, we got plenty of oxygen, water...
Here.
No, we're gonna be all right, skipper.
We're gonna be all right.
As soon as you feel better, we'll run a navigational estimate.
God, if I could only see the sun.
It's up there all right.
You can feel it.
Yes. But which sun?
I don't know. I don't know.
Our computer's shot.
We're lucky to be alive.
Lucky? No.
If it's 3955 AD, I...
Oh, my God. My wife.
My two daughters.
Dead.
Everyone I ever knew.
Everyone.
Who are you? I... Don't be afraid. I just...
Just tell me where I am.
Can you understand me?
My name's Brent.
Brent.
No. No, no, I don't wanna hurt you. I...
I just wanna know where I am.
Where are you from? I mean, your people.
Where are they?
How do I... How do I get to them?
Which way?
Can you... Can you talk?
Right, right. So you can't talk.
What's that?
Taylor!
Where is he?
Taylor. Taylor.
Nova.
Nova. Nova. Come on.
That's the idea. Taylor. Nova. Here.
Taylor. Taylor.
Here. There's a prize.
You go to the head of the class.
Why don't we just settle down and found a colony?
All the kids'll learn to talk.
Sure they will.
Now, where in hell do we go from here?
We might make it yet.
Taylor. Taylor.
Just tell me what happened to him.
Is he hurt? Is he alive? Where is he?
That wasn't here.
A minute ago, that wasn't here.
I'm not the only one. She sees it too.
Listen. Listen, now. If you lose me...
If you lose me, try to find Zira. Remember?
Zira. Go find Zira.
Zira.
This tag. Did he give it to you?
Where did you get this?
Look, is there... is there someone... some other... someone who can talk?
Look, you take me to Taylor.
Taylor.
Taylor. Now. Which way?
My God! It's...
It's a city of apes!
I'll tell you one thing that every good soldier knows.
The only thing that counts in the end is power!
Naked, merciless force!
Members of the Citizens' Council,
I am a simple soldier.
And as a soldier, I see things simply.
I don't say all humans are evil, simply because their skin is white.
No! But our great Lawgiver tells us that never, never will the human have the ape's divine faculty for being able to distinguish between evil and good.
Because the only good human is a dead human!
It's a bloody nightmare.
But those fortunate enough to remain alive will have the privilege of being used by our revered minister of science, the good Dr Zaius.
- Zira, stop. You're in danger.
- So is the future of science, with that rabble-rouser fomenting a senseless military adventure.
The forbidden zone has been closed for centuries, and rightly so.
However, we now have evidence that that vast barren area is inhabited.
By what or by whom, we don't know.
But if they live, and live they do, then they must eat.
Now we must replenish the lands that were ravaged by the humans with new, improved feeding grounds.
And these grounds we can obtain in the once forbidden zone.
It is therefore our holy duty to put our feet upon it, to enter it, to put the marks of our guns and our wheels and our flags upon it!
To expand the boundaries of our ineluctable power!
And to invade! Invade!
Invade! Invade!
- Zira, as your husband, I beg you to stand.
- Only for my principles.
All right. For your principles and mine.
Only please stand.
I gotta get out.
Yeah, I gotta get back up there.
I don't know how, or what with, but I'm not staying here.
Well, General,
I only pray you know what you're doing.
How can you have any doubt, Dr Zaius?
You're aware of the reports we've received of strange manifestations in the forbidden zone.
Manifestations which you, if I might add, as minister of science have been unable to fathom.
Twelve.
Twelve of my finest scouts just disappeared. Vanished into thin air.
Eleven.
Very well, eleven. Eleven.
And the twelfth returned with incredible stories of huge walls of fire, strange, violent earthquakes, his mind gone, shattered no doubt by some un-simian torture.
Well, General,
I still think you're being hasty.
No, Doctor. Decisive.
So we invade, or we stop.
- It's as simple as that.
- And as dangerous.
What is more dangerous than famine, Doctor?
The unknown.
If I had any proper sense of scientific purpose, Cornelius,
I shouldn't cut up the healthy heads of humans.
I should dissect the diseased brains of gorillas to find out what went wrong.
And how would you put it right?
I'd wet-nurse their babies on the milk of chimpanzees.
The milk of kindness.
At least our child when it's born won't be breast-fed on bile.
You know, my dear, the trouble with us intellectuals is that we have responsibilities and no power.
I think I'll make a chocolate icing.
Do you like chocolate?
- What, dear?
- No, no, no. Of course you don't.
- But I do.
- lf we had that power here in our hands, we'd be worse than them.
I don't agree.
Gorillas are cruel because they're stupid.
- All bone and no brain.
- Zira, my dear,
I wish you would not talk like that.
Somebody is liable to hear you.
- Nova!
- What are you doing here?
Taylor?
No, not Taylor. My name's Brent.
- You talked.
- That's impossible.
In a whole lifetime devoted to the scientific study of humans,
I've only found one other who could talk.
- Yes. Taylor.
- Taylor. Is he alive? Have you seen him?
- Where? Where? Tell us.
- Where? Where? I don't know where.
I'm trying to find him.
The longer I stay around here, the less I'm beginning to care.
We loved Taylor.
He was a fine, a unique, specimen.
Why, if it had not been for Zira here, he would still be here, a stuffed specimen in the great hall of the Zaius Museum with his two friends.
With his two friends?
I don't plan to stay here quite that long.
Can you get me some food, some water?
A map, so at least
I'll have some idea where I'm heading?
- You want that taken care of, too.
- I'll get the map.
Now, if you will look up here...
Yes, towards the north.
This was the last place that we saw Taylor and Nova.
- What is that damn stuff?
- You wouldn't know if I told you.
Just relax.
Among other things, I'm a trained vet.
- Great. Go on.
- Taylor was riding with Nova here, between the lake and the sea.
They were heading into the territory we call...
Yes, I know, the forbidden zone.
- Who told you that?
- Your glorious leader back there.
- Zira!
- Quick. Quick.
- Cornelius, open the door.
- Put the things away.
Open it!
Dr Zaius. How nice.
We were just about to have something to eat.
Not until I've talked some sense to that headstrong wife of yours.
- Where is she?
- Good day, Dr Zaius.
Good heavens.
Has there been an accident?
Cornelius hit me.
For my bad behavior at the meeting.
- I don't blame him.
- I don't resent it.
But his nails need clipping.
Enough of this nonsense.
Are you so blind, you two psychologists, that you're unaware that we're on the verge of a grave crisis?
- You heard the Ursus' speech.
- Militaristic tripe!
- Zira!
- Perhaps.
But now he has the incident he requires to go on a rampage of conquest.
- But that is appalling!
- To remain silent while this bully Ursus is permitted to destroy everything in his path is no longer possible.
As minister of science, it is my duty to find out whether some other form of life exists.
- Where are you going?
- Into the forbidden zone, with Ursus.
Another manhunt, Doctor?
Someone, or something, has outwitted the intelligence of the gorillas.
- That shouldn't be difficult.
- Zira.
We apes have learned to live in innocence.
Let no one, be it man or some other creature, dare to contaminate that innocence.
Why, is innocence so evil?
- Ignorance is.
- There is a time for truth.
And the time is always now.
Are you asking me to surrender my principles?
I am asking you to be the guardians of the principles of science during my absence.
I am asking for a truce with your personal convictions in an hour of public danger.
And you shall have it, Dr Zaius, or I shall hit her again.
Let us have no violence, Cornelius.
- Now, I'm relying on you both.
- And we are counting on you too, Doctor.
If I should fail to return from the unknown, the whole future of our civilization may be yours to preserve or destroy.
So think well before you act.
Well, goodbye, Dr Zaius, and good luck.
Now we can finish this up and get you out of here!
Yeah, get me outta here, please!
I've seen the humane way they treat humans here. I don't much care for it.
- Have you a horse?
- Yeah, out in the scrub.
I'd better get you another set of clothes.
The kind fit for humans like yourself.
You'll pass. Get rid of this.
And this too.
If you are caught by the gorillas, you must remember one thing.
- What's that?
- Never to speak.
What the hell would
I have to say to a gorilla?
But you don't understand.
Only apes can speak. Not her, and not you.
If they catch you speaking, they will dissect you, and they will kill you, in that order.
Cornelius is right. Be very careful.
And get out of those things that you're wearing as soon as you can.
Thanks.
- Thank us by finding Taylor.
- Yeah, if he's still alive.
Four.
Seven inches.
Sergeant, wait!
This is a type E cranium. Very unusual.
Weak occipital development, and substandard lobe...
Female. It's been a long time since we've been able to study specimens of such extraordinary clinical interest.
- Bring them inside.
- No!
No, you can't have them.
They are marked for target practice.
Take them away.
- I'll take the key.
- To the target range!
Wait! Wait!
I'd better double-lock the door.
Good luck. All right!
God Almighty!
This used to be my home.
I lived here, worked here.
What happened?
What could have happened?
My God, did we finally do it?
Did we finally really do it?
O God, bless, we pray You, our great army and its supreme commander on the eve of a holy war, undertaken for Your sake.
And grant, in the name of Your prophet, our great Lawgiver, that we, Your chosen servants, created and born in Your divine image, may aspire the more perfectly to that spiritual godliness and bodily beauty which You in Your infinite mercy have thought fit to deny to our brutish enemies!
So be it.
There they go,
Dr Zaius trotting along beside them.
Don't be too hard on the old boy, Zira.
His motives are honest.
He has only one motive, to keep things exactly as they have always been.
I say that it's time for a change.
But Zira, we chimpanzees are too few.
How can we take initiative when they are in control?
Love yes, war no!
- No more lies, no more crud!
- No more guns, no more blood!
Stop! Stop! Stop the war!
- Freedom! Freedom!
- Whoa!
- Freedom!
- Peace!
Peace and freedom!
- Get off the road, young people.
- Freedom!
- We want freedom!
- Get 'em out of the way.
- Wait.
- We want freedom! We want peace!
We don't want martyrs, do we?
We want peace! We want freedom!
- Sergeant? Do it quietly.
- No clubs, no clubs.
We want peace! We want freedom!
Gorilla brutality!
Sergeant!
Are you what we were, before we learned to talk and made a mess of everything?
Did any good ever come from all that talk around all those tables?
- I don't know where they are.
- I wonder where the hell we are.
- We're near the forbidden zone.
- Hell, that's where the army is headed.
- They'll roll over us, blow us to bits.
- Why can't we go back to our outfits?
Because the sarge says to keep lookin' until we find them.
Nova! Nova, Nova, wake up.
We gotta get goin'. Come on.
That hum.
You hear it too?
All right, come on. We're gonna follow it.
Well, whoever, or whatever, something's guiding us.
Whatever they are, they breathe air.
There's an intelligence working here.
That sound is either a warning or a directional device, I don't know which.
It doesn't much matter.
They know we're here.
Put my hands round her throat!
Off!
Hold her throat down until she dies!
No!
Get out!
Get out of my head!
I reveal my inmost self unto my God.
What did you say?
What do you mean, "there's no point"?
Will they hurt her?
No, maybe not physically, but here.
Here. You can hurt here, I know.
Your lips don't move.
But I can hear.
I know. I mean...
I know what you're thinking.
Nothing. I saw nothing.
Who are you?
Brent. Who are you?
I see. "The only reality in the universe."
Well, that's nice to know.
I got here by accident.
How did you get here?
You're wrong.
Why would I want to spy on you?
I'm not even sure you exist.
Of course I know who I am.
I'm an astronaut.
I was sent here on a rescue mission.
To find a fellow astronaut. Taylor.
Well, from this planet, but from another time, 2,000 years ago.
I know. I know it sounds insane.
And it's my insanity.
No. No, I don't know how to get back.
We came through a defect.
A slippage in time.
That's what must have happened to Taylor.
I'm sure he tried to get back.
Yes, my skipper's dead. I'm alone.
Who?
"Nova"? What's that?
Some star or galaxy? What's "Nova"?
All right, all right! Yes, I know her.
I know her!
No, no. She's harmless. Let her alone.
All right.
Just tell me what you want to know.
She helped me. To break out ofApe City.
No, wait. Wait a minute!
Stop it!
I can't understand you if you're all screaming at me at the same time.
I can't separate it!
He's right. He has only limited intelligence.
We should speak aloud, and one at a time.
Are we to understand that you were in the city of the apes?
- Yes. Yes, two days ago.
- What sights did you see?
- You're talking.
- Certainly we can talk.
It's a primitive accomplishment.
We use it when we must.
- When we pray.
- When we sing to our God.
You mean that thing out there?
An atomic bomb?
- Your God?
- You don't understand, Mr Brent.
The Bomb is a holy weapon of peace.
Holy weapon of peace!
Mr Brent, we are a patient people.
But we are determined to know what the apes want. War or peace?
Try to understand.
The only weapons we have are purely illusion.
You just imagine that he hurt you.
Traumatic hypnosis is a weapon of peace.
Like the visual deterrent.
Or the sonic deterrent.
Let me make a last appeal to your reason, before we inflict more of this on you.
These are weapons of peace, Mr Brent.
- Like all our weapons.
- Mere illusions.
Illusions. Damn your hypocrisy!
Is that bomb out there... is that an illusion?
It's operational, isn't it?
The firing mechanism. It's intact, isn't it?
We very much need your help, Mr Brent.
- Why?
- We are the Keepers of the Divine Bomb.
- It is our only reason for survival.
- And yet as you see we are defenseless.
Defenseless against the slobbering, monstrous, materialistic apes.
I'll help nobody.
- Go ahead, annihilate each other.
- I forgive you your language.
There are times, I know, when your sanity is about to give way.
I hope that does not happen.
- I hope you can tell us...
- Exactly what the apes are planning.
We've caught some of their scouts.
They're hideous creatures.
And we've had them here, standing precisely where you are now.
Either their skulls were too thick, or they really knew nothing at all.
Neither do I. Can't you understand that?
I don't know anything.
You make us very sad, Mr Brent.
She can't help you. She can't even talk.
- Don't harm her.
- We never harm anyone, Mr Brent.
You're going to harm her.
- The apes are semiarticulate...
- You're lying.
How do you know?
How do you always know?
Nova.
- Now...
- Tell us of the apes.
The apes are marching on your city.
Bugler, sound the advance.
Ursus!
Ursus, I warned you.
Look what we are faced with!
- I told you you should wait.
- Brutal butchery!
I swear those responsible shall pay with torture and with death!
If you have any pity, get your soldiers to shoot our poor people.
I can't order them to do what the Lawgiver has forbidden.
"Ape shall not kill ape."
Hold your positions!
He bleeds!
The Lawgiver bleeds!
The spirit of the Lawgiver lives.
We are still God's chosen ones.
This is a vision, and it is a lie!
The vision was false!
Bugler, sound the advance.
Advance!
Stupid animals! They don't have the brain to hold our illusions.
- We have no defense.
- Except our Bomb.
- Call our people to High Sanctuary.
- Do you know the range of their city?
- Yes.
- Set in the mechanism and wait for me.
I want a public thought projection, at adult and infant level.
Adults to the cathedral, infants indoors.
Is now and ever shall be
World without end, Amen
The heavens declare the glory of the Bomb and the firmament showeth His handiwork.
His sound has gone out unto all the lands and His light unto the end of the world.
He descendeth from the outermost part of heaven.
Nothing is hid from the heat thereof.
There is neither speech nor language, yet His voice is heard among them.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
My strength, and my redeemer.
Glory be to the Bomb and to the Holy Fallout, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
O mighty and everlasting Bomb, who came down among us to make heaven under earth, lighten our darkness.
O instrument of God, grant us thy peace.
Almighty Bomb
Who destroyed all devils
And created angels
Behold this moment
Behold the truth that abides in us.
Reveal that truth unto that Maker.
- I reveal my inmost self unto my God.
- Unto my God.
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The good Bomb made us all
He gave us eyes to see with
And lips that we might tell
How great the Bomb Almighty
Who made all things well
Let everyone go to his private shelter.
Empty the streets.
They are to find the City of the Dead.
May the blessing of the Bomb Almighty and the fellowship of the Holy Fallout descend on us all this day, and forevermore.
I trust this simple ceremony convinced you of our peaceable intentions.
- I'd like to thank you for your cooperation.
- When may we hope to be set free?
You may hope whenever you please, Mr Brent.
How could we hope to let you go on the eve of war, Mr Brent?
You know too many of our secrets.
Like your friend.
- Taylor!
- You're... Brent!
- My God! Taylor!
- Brent, how in the hell did you get here?
The same way you did.
Spaceship, Ape City, subway...
- By yourself?
- No. No, Nova found me.
- Is she with you? Where?
- I don't know.
They separated us.
They were trying to make me kill her.
Mr Taylor, Mr Brent.
We are a peaceful people.
We don't kill our enemies, we get our enemies to kill each other.
I'm fighting.
I'm fighting. I don't wanna...
Taylor. Taylor!
Taylor!
Unto God
I reveal my inmost self.
He's hurt bad.
This isn't exactly sterile.
We'll do the best we can.
Taylor. Taylor, they got a bomb.
Atomic bomb.
It's operational. They intend to use it.
- What type is it?
- I don't know.
I don't know what type.
I've never seen it before.
- Well, didn't you see a series number?
- No numbers.
Just some letters on one of the fins.
Greek letters.
Alpha and...
- And omega.
- What?
The Doomsday Bomb.
My God!
What a lovely souvenir from the 20th century.
They weren't satisfied with a bomb that could knock out a city.
They finally built one with a cobalt casing.
All in the sweet name of peace.
Those bloody fools.
They don't know what they've got.
I mean, they pray to the damn thing.
If they shoot it off at some of those apes, it could set off a chain reaction in the whole atmosphere.
Burn the planet to a cinder.
How's that for your ultimate weapon?
This must be what your scout reported.
A subterranean passage.
I think it's worth exploring.
What will you do, Holiness?
Everything necessary.
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm thinking just that.
Nova? Nova, you...
Oh God!
We should let 'em all die.
The gorillas, every damned...
Look what it comes to.
It's time it was finished. Finished.
Taylor.
Come on, come on. The bomb.
Yeah.
Why not?
They're obscene!
Follow me!
Sergeant!
Arrest that creature!
- This is the instrument of my God.
- He can speak!
Your God, eh?
Sergeant.
Your God didn't save you, did he?
Ursus! Ursus, are you mad?
That weapon is built by man.
You can't shoot it down with only a clip of bullets.
If we can't shoot it down, we'll pull it down. Rope!
Block and tackle! Get on it!
But you don't know what you're doing!
It'll kill us all!
I'll find a way to stop it.
Get him! Over there!
Ursus! Someone at the pillar.
Zaius...
- Taylor!
- It's Doomsday.
The end of the world.
- Help me.
- You ask me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction!
You bloody bastard!
In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe lies a medium-size star.
Mr. Wells?
Mr. Wells?
- Yes, Mrs. Schmidt?
- You've got company, Mr. Wells.
That's some bender you've been on, pal.
They're gonna have to put a night shift on Jack Daniel's just to keep up with you.
Mrs. Schmidt, call the police. 485-2581.
Tell them to get an ambulance here fast.
Tell them we got a dying man.
Police emergency?
Can you send an ambulance?
We've got a man here. I think he's dying.
The address is 1405 Beechwood.
It's not as bad as the time in San Diego.
Ira, I got a deal for us.
Harry, who did it?
It's a chance for us to make a lot of dough.
Harry, you're dying. Tell me who did it.
How did it happen?
Don't worry, Ira, I'm cutting you in.
Fair deal.
Just don't try to throw a scare into me.
It won't work.
I'll lay it all out for you.
Just get me to a hospital.
God damn you, Harry!
Letting somebody walk up and drill you like that... point-blank.
Nobody can palm a.45.
Jesus Christ.
You never had the brains
God gave a common dog.
Sorry you're going off, pal.
You were real good company.
The best.
The very best.
Margo, that's him.
Jeez, Charles, he doesn't look so hot to me.
Let me tell you, kiddo,
Ira Wells used to be one of the greats.
Whatever it is, Charlie, the answer is no.
What do you mean no?
Did I say a word? Did I?
- No.
- Yeah.
Ira, Margo. Margo, Ira.
- Mr. Wells...
- Margo here's a pal of mine.
How do you feel about cats?
- I beg your pardon?
- Cats. How do you feel about them?
I'm not sure.
What I mean is that somebody stole Winston.
- Somebody stole who?
- Winston, my cat.
Somebody stole him.
I have a picture of him.
- What the hell is she talking about?
- I wanna show it to you.
See, Brian stole Winston.
And he said he would strangle him if I don't pay him the money.
Margo owes this guy $500 for a long time.
Come on, Charles, six months is hardly a long time.
He gets PO'd at her... and steals the cat and threatens to kill it if she doesn't give the dough.
- So pay him.
- I can't pay him.
I don't have the money to pay him.
I see. You want me to find the guy that stole your cat and bring it back, right?
- Thanks, pal.
- He's easy to identify.
I can't help you out.
Try the fire department.
- I'm out of the business.
- His collar is...
Come on, this is the kind of play you can handle easy.
Mr. Wells, if it's money...
I had planned to offer you $25.
I have it right here.
- Charlie, how long have I known you?
- I don't know, 16, 17 years.
In all that time, did you ever hear of Ira Wells taking a two-bit job?
I heard what you said.
This is not a two-bit job.
I mean, if I offended you,
I'm very sorry, and I apologize... because I didn't mean to offend the great Ira Wells.
Charlie, I want you to know
I appreciate you coming to Harry's funeral.
I enjoy talking to you.
Maybe I don't act like it, but I do.
There aren't many guys left from the old days.
I think you ought to teach your pal here some respect for her elders.
Yeah, well, maybe you should learn a little respect... for other little creatures that are walking under your...
- Where are you headed?
- I'm going to the track, Hollywood Park.
This little kitty is just a little honey bun!
Give this little cat a break!
It's Bank Vault going away
by a length-and-a-half.
Wild Chase is second by four lengths.
Easy Victor, on the inside, is third.
Kewpie Doll and Top Target are tied.
The rest of the field is well back. Down
the course Bank Vault pulls away.
Wild Chase is leading.
Easy Victor and Kewpie Doll
unable to close any ground.
... and Kewpie Doll is the fourth horse.
Timing the race for six furlongs,
covering three-quarters of a mile...
one minute, ten seconds flat.
In the winner's circle is Bank Vault...
with Hollywood Park's leading apprentice
jockey, Benny de Angelino...
getting his fifth in the current leading.
And for those looking for a hot bet
on Friday the 13th...
this might have been the horse
they were looking for luck on the 13th.
All right, Charlie, give out with it.
I thought you was going to the track.
How long has it been since I've seen you, Charlie?
Close to a year, isn't it?
Somebody puts the freeze on Harry Regan... next thing I know, you show up at Harry's funeral with some dolly... and a song and dance about a stolen cat, and all that hot comedy.
What's it all got to do with Harry?
Harry was working for the dolly.
Are you telling me that Harry got himself killed on account of some cat?
Listen.
I know Margo maybe six or seven years.
Used to be a client of mine.
One night, a couple of weeks ago, she comes into this bar where I'm working...
Just sort of temporary.
The talent business is slow.
Anyway, it turns out that she's mad as hell about this guy stealing her cat.
I'm listening... and all of a sudden
I remember Harry Regan.
And I think to myself,
"He's still in the business...
"if there's any business left for him to do."
He took the job.
So he finds this guy that stole the cat and starts to follow him.
- Yeah.
- Who is this guy Harry was tailing?
I wouldn't know him from a hole in my sock.
The dolly?
- The dolly? What about her?
- Where does she live, Charlie?
Some place called La Paloma... over on Franklin, near Vermont.
That's where you live, isn't it, Charlie?
Yeah.
As we begin to meditate...
take a deep breath.
Charlotte, listen to me.
Tonight is important.
I don't want you to get uptight about it.
Because this guy books a lot of Holiday Inns all over the country.
I think it's a good place to start.
I mean, it's a good place to work out a lot of problems.
You're gonna be absolutely terrific tonight.
Who's taking you?
- What's he gonna wear?
- Imagine the joy...
Wait. I'll tell you what.
I think he should wait outside.
No, because that's very important.
I'm telling you, the entire picture, the entire impression, is important.
Charlotte, this is another self-destructive act, in my opinion.
Listen, if I am gonna handle your career... and if I am going to be...
Wait a second, Charlotte.
Charlotte, listen, I got to go.
No. Somebody just walked in.
I'll see you at 10:30.
You're gonna be terrific.
Think positive. Okay, bye-bye.
Why don't you just come in and make yourself comfortable?
... descending into the boundless water...
as it rises over...
your tired, weary body.
You begin to relax.
Harry Regan was a pal of mine close to 24 years.
Whoever it was that killed him is gonna be goddamn sorry.
Mr. Wells, I can understand your feeling that way.
I mean, as an actress,
I understand it as a motivation.
- What about this guy who took your cat?
- Brian Hemphill.
He's this guy, he's really sort of a tuna.
He just hangs around, you know.
And we used to have this thing going, kind of a sexual interlude.
It never really came to anything.
Now Brian and his friend sometimes give me money... to schlep things to this guy in Bakersfield.
- Things? What things?
- You know, things.
Material things.
I mean, worldly possessions:
Washing machines, TV sets, clock radios. Things.
Did it ever cross your mind these things might be hot?
Who's to know? I mean,
I'm not by nature a curious person.
I'll bet.
- I mean, go with the flow.
- That's what I always say.
This guy in Bakersfield, he paid you off in cash, right?
Yes.
Then you'd bring the dough to this punk,
Brian, then you'd get your cut?
Yes.
Only on this last trip, you decided you wanna keep the money yourself, right?
So Brian gets mad because he wants his dough. So he steals your cat.
- And you go crying to Harry Regan.
- It was just a loan.
I did not take the money, it was a loan, just till I get my dress business going.
- Your dress business?
- I design all the clothes I make.
- I thought you were an actress.
- Are you kidding? I did the whole star trip.
I just never could learn how to push myself, you know.
I don't like to go begging.
I don't want anybody to do me any favors.
I just never could learn how to play the Hollywood game.
My shrink says that I'm a very conflicted personality.
- Jesus Christ.
- But my astrologist...
What is that supposed to mean?
Back in the '40s, this town was crawling with dollies like you.
Good-looking cokeheads trying their damnedest to act tough as hell.
I got news for you:
They did it better back then.
This town doesn't change.
They just push the names around.
Same dames, screwing up their lives just the same way.
All right. What about this guy Brian?
Where can I find him?
Who's to know. He just hangs around.
- Where is around?
- Around is around.
I mean, around is no particular place.
The only time I hear from him is when he calls me up to torment me about my cat.
The next time he calls you up,
I want you to set up a meet.
All right.
Mr. Wells, listen,
I don't want you to get the wrong idea...
- about me schlepping those things...
- Doll, I'm not interested in your life story.
Just set up a meet with your friend Brian.
Yes? I'm coming.
Just a minute.
I don't care what you say, you understand?
- Yes?
- Hi, I'm Margo Sperling.
We'd like to talk to your husband.
No, my husband passed on seven years ago.
What's going on in here?
We were playing canasta right there in the living room.
Kid, the you-know-what has hit the fan.
Look, I wouldn't make a federal case out of everything, Charlie.
Mrs. Schmidt, would you leave us alone for a couple of minutes?
I have some personal business to talk over with these people.
Of course, Mr. Wells.
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Anytime, Mr. Wells, your friends are more than welcome.
- Thank you.
- I like the color of your sweater.
- Thank you.
- Very much.
- The man's a killer, you ding-a-ling!
- Don't call me a ding-a-ling!
Hold it!
This happens to be where I live, okay?
It may not look like a hell of a lot to you, but it suits me.
Now, Mrs. Schmidt, that's my landlady, we get along just fine.
At least we did until a few days ago.
If you two would simmer down... tell me what's going on, I'd appreciate it.
Okay. You wanted to take a meeting with Brian, right?
So he called me.
I'm listening to him carefully because I've known him a long time.
And Brian's not very evolved.
In fact, he's rather de-evolved.
I was talking to him, and I'm very sensitive to the vibrations he gives out.
Because I know what karma he has...
- What is she talking about?
- She said you was looking for this guy...
- because of what happened to Harry.
- That's what I said.
She said if he didn't come here you'd come gunning for him.
- That's right.
- The punk that nailed Harry's coming here?
Wait a second. You are so paranoid.
You don't know for sure.
You don't know that that's true at all!
- Maybe Brian didn't even do it.
- I got a pretty good idea.
Charlie may be a chiseler and a crook, but he's the best information man in town.
Wait a second. What is that for?
It's for if Charlie's right.
Please. Come on. No, don't do this.
Do you know people who play with guns are generally impotent?
What's ever settled with a gun?
Come on, hold on a second.
Now, just a second.
How many people you're gonna shoot?
Hold on a second.
I think it's him. It's him.
Mrs. Schmidt...
I'll use the living room for a few minutes, if you don't mind.
That's fine, Mr. Wells.
Just don't make a mess.
Come on, lighten up on this cops and robbers stuff.
I can handle this.
Christ!
Watch it!
He's getting away. Don't let him!
- Take it easy.
- Go, get him.
- Are you crazy?
- Plug him!
God damn it! Kill him! You could get him!
I could get a heart attack, that's what I could get... running all that way.
How far do you think I'd get with this leg of mine? That's one.
Two: Whoever that guy is, he's no snob about how he kills people.
It's a goddamn.45 he's using.
There are a lot of ways to play any game.
I play mine on the house percentages.
485-2581, Mr. Wells. I remembered.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Schmidt.
- I'm sorry about all this.
- It's no bother.
Where's my cat, you creep?
Come on in, doll, before you catch a cold.
All right, Charlie, hand it over.
What do you mean?
Whatever you took off the stiff.
Hand it over.
Jesus, kid,
I always said you were the best.
Didn't I tell you he was the best?
What's that?
Stamps?
- The Whiting job.
- Who? Whiting?
About 10 days ago, some place out in the Valley.
Whiting? Who's that?
Whiting had a stamp collection worth almost $50,000.
- Who's Whiting?
- There's a murder one tied to it, right?
Okay, don't tell me. What do I care?
Two guys broke into a house out in the Valley.
They tied up Whiting and his wife, and started to lift the stamps.
Then something must have gone wrong... because they beat up Whiting and killed his wife.
Disgusting. I don't wanna hear any more.
- That's what Harry was onto, right?
- I don't know.
I don't wanna hear any more.
Harry knew about the stamps and he also told you.
That's why you knew what to look for on the punk.
Kid, I swear he didn't tell me anything.
Hear that? That's the cops.
They'll be here in a couple minutes.
Either you start to play it on the square with me, or I'll feed you to them.
- Which, considering your record...
- You wouldn't do that.
Okay, here's the house number.
Harry is tailing this guy, Brian, looking for Margo's cat... when Brian and this pal of his pull off the Whiting heist.
The next day, Harry met me and laid out the whole thing.
Wants me to check out the reward angle.
I nose around.
Sure enough, Continental Insurance is offering $15,000 for the goddamn stamps.
You guys were gonna split it.
Just the kind of cheap grift
Harry would go for.
Listen, Charlotte,
I'm having a lot of trouble.
- I had a lot of big trouble...
- Kid, you know who just kicked off?
That dame, the one that almost nailed you back in '53.
Jesus, what was her name?
- Madeline? No. Marilyn Thornton.
- That's her.
- I'm still carrying some of that lead.
- I'll talk to you later.
Pit city. I mean, pit city!
Not only did I still not get my cat back, thanks to you... not only did I almost get mowed down here tonight... not only did I sit here with yellow socks... and perjure myself in front of the entire
Los Angeles Police Department... on top of that,
I promised a singer that I manage...
I would be there for a very important audition.
And of course, you can probably tell,
I'm not there.
And on top of that, I got my period.
Listen, doll, let's get something straight.
As long as we're gonna be working together... try to act like a lady, will you?
Who says we're working together?
Do you have any ideas about who might have wanted to kill him?
No, I don't.
What about the guy that helped your boyfriend pull off the Whiting heist?
Ray Escobar.
Mr. Wells, a truly evolved person... doesn't go around ratting on her friends, if you catch my drift.
This guy, Escobar, who is he?
There is no point in this discussion.
If you only knew how far behind
I've gotten in everything... just because of all this ridiculous...
And I don't even have my cat yet!
I don't wanna even talk about it, because I'm finished.
I mean, I am finished. Finalissimo!
Kid.
Let me talk to Margo alone.
I don't wanna be talked to alone, or talked to in a crowd.
I don't wanna be talked to by you, Charles.
- Just hear me out, okay?
- Please!
- Look, sugar.
- I'm not listening.
You're two payments behind on the car, right?
I know, because you already tried to hit me up for loan.
What do you think you owe the dentist for your caps?
- Om.
- Okay.
What about that trip to Vegas? How much do you think you're in hock for that?
And what about the Japanese lessons?
Let's see. How much do you figure that's all totaled up to... at least $4,000?
Now can you think about $15,000 in reward money... strictly on the up and up, split two ways.
Well?
Boy, it's really lucky for you that I just happen to be a self-destructive person.
Okay.
Start talking from the top.
Okay, as long as we're gonna be working together.
Brian had this creepy friend.
Far be it for me to go around passing judgments on people... but Ray Escobar is truly Pittsville.
They had some kind of arrangement, a deal going with this guy named Birdwell.
- Ronny Birdwell?
- Yeah.
He's a fence. New since your day.
Got a setup over on Sunset place.
Check around the street, Charlie.
See what you can pick up on Escobar.
- Can do.
- That's it?
Charles, wait!
Give me a lift out to the airport.
Jesus, Margo! It's 2:00 in the morning!
- Okay, so I'll buy gas.
- One more thing, doll, about my fee.
My fee.
- I get $25 a day plus expenses.
- What's he talking about?
Listen, sweetheart, you're talking to Ira Wells, not some low-rent gumshoe.
- I'm the best, and I get paid like the best.
- All right.
Okay.
Birdwell?
No. I work for Mr. Birdwell.
My name is Jeff Lamar.
- Won't you come in, Mr. Wells?
- Thank you.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
No hard feelings, sir.
I know that.
Come on.
This is Mr. Wells.
You said on the phone you had something
I might be interested in.
Before we do any talking, better warn this cheesehead.
Next time he tries anything with me,
I'll kill him.
I won't give him a chance. I'll kill him.
Okay, pop.
Now that you've got that off your chest, what's your business?
The Whiting job.
- Postage stamps, right?
- That's right.
- What's that got to do with me?
- The word is, it could be tied in to you.
I'm gonna tell you I don't know dick about the Whiting job, right?
You'll tell me you'll take this hotshit information... of yours to somebody else.
Then I'll tell you I'd be interested if the price is right.
Then we'll dance for a couple of hours.
So let's just cut to the chase.
You like music?
I got a Panasonic hi-fi over there that is a sensation to the ears.
Automatic record changer, air suspension, plus an eight-track tape.
Last week a pal of mine was tailing one of the guys that pulled the Whiting job.
He turned up dead.
I'll throw in a couple of suits.
Manufacturers' name brands.
Hart Shafner and Marx,
Botany 500, Petrocelli. What do you say?
Bullshit!
His name was Harry Regan.
I mean to have the louse that nailed him.
I never heard of any guy named Regan.
I'll tell you, pop,
I'm in a kind of line of work...
- that you pick up things, you know?
- I can see that.
It could be I have some information about your buddy.
Come on, Ronny.
How do you know he really has anything...
- and isn't just jerking you around?
- You know something, punk?
If he was to finger you,
I'd give him a Petrocelli suit.
Stamps are a specialty item.
Not just anybody can move them.
When a guy pulls a heist like that, he's got the fence lined up in front.
- So far, I couldn't give less of a shit.
- Maybe.
But one of the punks that pulled the Whiting job works for you.
Brian Hemphill.
You are peddling Brian Hemphill.
I know the son of a bitch pulled the Whiting robbery.
You know who told me? The cops.
Yeah. I was down at the station house already.
Two hours, they kept me there.
They ran my ass ragged.
I told them the same thing I'll tell you.
I fired Hemphill two months ago.
He was a thief, he was robbing me blind.
I haven't seen the little turd since.
I'll tell you something else.
They know he was shot last night.
They're looking for a pal of his.
You're a little late, pop. About 40 years.
Come here.
I like you.
I admire a guy your age that's got the balls to try a hustle like that.
Right, Lamar? What's your size?
- What?
- In the collar and sleeve?
I got a shipment of Van Heusen shirts yesterday that will knock your eyes out.
On account of what Lamar did to you.
You're a 17-34. Something else.
The police know that Brian Hemphill is an alias.
His real name is Earl Hampton.
He did time in Illinois for robbing a jewelry store.
This is you. It's perfect.
You wear that, you'll drive the girls crazy.
Okay, pop?
No hard feelings.
Must be around here somewhere.
There he is. Ira.
Where are you headed?
I'm on my way to the Brown Derby to meet Louis B. Mayer.
Where does it look like I'm headed?
Where were you all morning?
I must have called you 20 times.
- I went to see Birdwell.
- What did you wanna do that for?
Trying to figure out why two guys who heist $50,000 in stamps... are still hanging around town, waiting for the cops to wise up... and grab them on murder rap.
I could have told you that.
Because they are dumb. They're D-U-M-B.
- I'll remember you said that.
- How'd it go?
With Birdwell? Piece of cake.
Didn't I say he was the greatest?
Didn't I say that before? Damn.
Wait a minute!
Come on, start this thing. Mr. Wells!
Wait a second!
For crying out loud, don't tell me how to drive when I'm driving!
This car is not only a toilet, but you are the attendant.
There he is.
Did you dig up anything on this guy Escobar?
But it's gonna cost.
Yeah?
I found a guy who knows another guy... that saw Escobar holed up someplace over in Santa Monica.
- That's the part that costs.
- He wants a C-note for the address.
You got that kind of dough?
- What about you?
- $46. That's all I've got.
It might interest you to know that I dug up a few items about your pal Brian today.
Such as, his real name is Earl Hampton.
Did a stretch in the pen a couple of years back for armed robbery.
His name was Earl Hampton.
$68, but that's every penny.
I'm not kidding. I mean, every penny.
Birdwell tried to put some muscle on me and I had to get tough with him.
He's starting to crack, but it's not Christmas yet, understand?
- You shouldn't put that in first.
- I beg your pardon.
If you still wanna cash in on the reward money, I got to move.
I got to move fast.
How come I'm the one that has to raise the money?
How come nobody else here in this group has any cash?
What's wrong with you, Charles?
Why don't you try to come up with a little scratch once in a while?
You two have a real class act.
Charlie, take a couple of hours and dig up anything you can on Birdwell.
- There's something screwy going on there.
- Got you.
I'll tell you what you do.
Call up Tom Wyman.
He works out of the Bureau of Detectives, downtown.
Tell him I told you to call.
He owes me a favor anyway.
Kid, Tom's dead.
He's been dead almost six months.
Then find somebody else.
Jesus Christ, Charlie, use your brains!
All right. I'll try to raise $100.
Birdwell showed up out here about six years ago.
Went to work for a guy who had a fence operation out in the Valley.
A couple of years ago, the guy retires... buys himself a condominium in Florida.
- Birdwell buys him out.
- That's it?
What did you expect, Gone with the Wind?
If three people get killed, I expect more than a condominium in Florida.
Nothing's ever good enough for you.
That's three.
- The word is he's got dolly trouble.
- Any dolly in particular?
His wife.
- She was chippying around on him.
- With?
Jesus, kid. All I had was a couple of hours.
Want one?
Are you kidding?
You know what one of those would do to my gut?
Must be tough.
Does Birdwell know his wife was cheating on him?
If he does, he's playing it close to the vest.
I gotta have a Coke.
- Did you bring the dough?
- Please use the scoop.
Yes, I brought the dough, and I want it all back, you guys.
I mean it. From the top.
I'm keeping track, too.
There's been $50 for Mr. Wells,
$20 for expenses... plus 75, 85, 95, 100...
10, 25. You count it.
And I want a receipt, too.
Come on, hurry up.
I've got this guy waiting outside.
- This is Pepsi.
- Hurry up. Come on.
You know what I had to go through to hassle up this dough?
I laid off four ounces of pure red Columbian... for $15 an ounce.
I mean, it's disgusting.
Some freak over on Pico thinks I'm Santa Claus, I swear to God.
$15 an ounce.
- You have a lot of faith in me, don't you?
- Come on. This is just business.
$15 an ounce.
This grass was so great, I can't tell you.
There was so much resins in it, it made your lips stick together.
How long have you been pushing?
Who says I'm pushing?
You've got a lot of nerve.
I'm not pushing.
You think if I was a pusher,
I'd have a little empty purse like this?
You make it sound like I hang around schoolyards... trying to prey on 12-year-old kids.
Anyways, I'm only doing it till I get my shrink paid.
That makes sense.
I had a session with her today... and I told her all about you.
- Don't you wanna know what I told her?
- Not particularly.
I told her that you were cute.
You told her I was cute?
Got it.
Okay, that's all for me, right?
Everything's cool?
Because I am out of here.
Wait a minute. Just stay put.
- Stay put? Why?
- Stay put.
I've got a job for you.
Look, I don't wanna go in there.
Let me just sit in the van here.
I can keep watch.
According to Charlie, this is where Escobar is hiding out, right?
Yeah.
- You know him, right?
- I know him.
He's gonna be nervous. He'll have a gun.
- He'll have a what?
- He'll have a gun.
You can look at me and say,
"He'll have a gun"?
- You bought into this, toots.
- Look, just back off. I mean...
- Come on.
- Let me explain something to you...
I'm not good at this stuff.
Maybe I could just...
- Okay.
- Get the key.
Ira?
Okay, you've seen enough.
Let's get out of here.
Ira, don't make any noise.
Winston. Ira, it's Winston.
Winstie, is that you? It's Winston, my cat.
Look, he's okay. Hello, Winstie.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I got my cat back.
I take back everything
I ever thought about you.
I swear to God. Thank you.
Let's get out of here.
Everything's copasetic.
I am not gonna tell you again.
I swear to God... if we don't get out of here,
I'm gonna start to panic.
- You're an actress, aren't you?
- I'm begging you.
Act calm.
- Ira, don't go in there.
- Stay put.
Ira, wait a second.
It's all right.
Don't leave me out here. Come on.
Please let me in.
Come on. It's not me, it's Winston.
He needs to stretch his little legs.
I think he's been brainwashed.
- Holy moly, where did she come from?
- I found her in the bathtub.
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- You got any ideas?
- Listen, both of you.
- I'm the one who hired you.
- I'm warning you.
- Lady, do me a favor. Put that thing down.
- Margo here is not too stable.
- Yeah.
She's liable to try something dumb.
- Just a minute.
- Just hold your water.
Maybe I'm wrong, but you don't look like you've had a lot of experience... handling a.357 magnum.
Even so, at this close distance, you couldn't miss.
If something happened, it wouldn't be a great loss to the world... but you'd go over on a manslaughter.
That's minimum eight to twelve.
That's right.
That's better.
- Mister...
- Wells. Ira Wells.
I'm a detective, private detective.
I'm sorry about before, about the part with the gun, but I was so afraid.
Mr. Wells...
I am going to be totally open and honest with you.
I'm going to lay myself naked before you.
I hope you appreciate that.
- He'll try.
- Get me a glass of water, will you, doll?
Why don't you ask her what she's doing here in the first place?
- What did I ever do without you?
- Very little, I'm sure.
- Now, then, Mrs...
- Birdwell. Laura Birdwell.
- You seem like a very intelligent man.
- I've had my moments.
I really cannot relate on this level.
I'm in a great deal of trouble.
I don't know how much
I can open up to you.
Why don't you just tell it to me in your own way, Mrs. Birdwell?
Laura.
I got a call this afternoon from a man who said his name was Escobar.
- He said he had certain items.
- Here you go, ace.
You drink too much of that, you're gonna start seeing red rats.
Could I please have a glass of water, a Coke or something?
Sure. Any friend of the hunk's is a friend of mine.
I'm very nervous.
You can understand that, can't you?
I can understand that.
What could I do?
I tried to reason with him... but he sounded like a truly desperate character.
I had no choice.
When I got here, the door was open.
I was about to leave, and I heard you coming.
And I thought...
You can imagine what I thought.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Why was this Escobar blackmailing you?
I was seeing this man.
We were having an affair.
- Your husband didn't know about it?
- Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Just fix the goddamn Coke, will you?
Mr. Wells...
Ira.
I'm sorry, doll. What I never told you... is this is the hardest goddamn way in the world to make a buck.
Ira, look.
Damn.
Be careful.
Come on.
Watch it!
Okay. Start the motor.
All right. Now you can turn on your lights.
- Don't miss the light.
- I'm not gonna miss the light.
Just watch what you're doing, that's all.
Let's go to the cops.
We really should just go to the cops.
Let's do it, please.
Not until I find the guy that nailed Harry Regan.
That is such bullshit.
- I mean, that is such total bullshit!
- Yeah. Sure thing, doll.
Speed up.
He's getting a little too far ahead.
It's disgusting.
You don't care about Harry Regan.
I'll tell you what this is.
This is one last chance for you... to go around shooting off guns at people.
Playing cops and robbers.
You're getting off behind all this blood and guts. It's true.
It's very immature. You need help.
- Now, wait a minute. Watch it.
- I can see. I'm watching.
Tail him.
Slow down.
Where the hell did he go?
Hold on!
Holy moly, wait a second. Hold on.
Jesus Christ!
Hush, baby. It's okay!
Ira, I feel so incredibly high,
I can't even tell you.
I feel like I've dropped acid.
Have you ever dropped acid?
- Not in the last 10 minutes.
- Do you get this feeling...
Can you see anything about me that's different?
- Do I have a different kind of expression?
- You look higher.
I look high right now? I am high.
Did I give you sugar?
- I haven't had the tea yet.
- I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm thinking.
Look at these little things in here.
Don't worry, they just float around.
They're herbs. They won't hurt you.
Everything's incredibly okay, because I feel so high. I'm not kidding.
I feel wonderfully high!
I saw that space, I had some possibilities which I considered, and I made choices.
That's all, I went right through it.
Didn't I? It was incredible.
I had my hands on the wheel.
Didn't I take care of business?
- You did.
- I did it. I went right through it.
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I did a great job.
I know you think I'm trouble.
You probably think I'm talking like I'm a crazy person...
- but I feel just like Nick and Nora.
- Who?
You know, The Thin Man.
Phyllis Kirk and Peter Lawford.
Wait a second. I just got a flash.
This is incredible.
Escobar and Brian robbed this man Whiting, right?
Yeah. They killed his wife while they were at it.
How come they didn't take it on the lam?
How come they stuck around town?
- Ask yourself why.
- I have asked myself.
Ask yourself again,
'cause I'm gonna tell you the answer.
Because they found something besides the stamps at Whiting's.
They found something that they could blackmail Laura Birdwell with.
- Are you following me?
- I'm following you.
She said she was having a sexual relationship with another man... other than her husband.
What if the guy she's making it with... turned out to be Whiting?
You didn't think of that one, did you?
What about it?
- That's pretty good.
- Pretty good? That is fabulous.
I mean, if I do say so myself.
I'm gonna go down to the police station... and get a private detective's license.
If we teamed up, we'd be great together.
That's just what this town has been waiting for.
A broken-down old private eye with a bum leg and a hearing aid... and a fruitcake like you.
I don't know. You're not so old.
If you lost a few pounds... and stopped wearing those baggy suits, you'd look 10 years younger.
Anyway, we'd be a team.
We'd be working together.
Don't you get it?
You've got the experience, and I'm this very on-top-of-it person.
This could be big bucks for us.
The more I think about this, the better an idea I think it is.
This is the most fantastic thing.
The apartment next door is vacant,
I just remembered.
You could move right in there.
This could be perfect. We could...
It would be like a duplex, a kind of suite of offices.
I think that would be perfect.
We could have cards printed up.
I feel it. I have that intuitive kind of thing.
I wouldn't mind having you next door.
It'd be okay.
- I got to go.
- I could stand the company.
I wouldn't mind it. I know what you're going to say. Don't start.
You're gonna say,
"There's gonna be problems."
Of course there's gonna be problems, because that's what life is.
If I were really truthful with you, and I'm gonna be truthful... in my mind, you're a pretty old-school kind of person... kind of old-fashioned and everything.
And I don't have to tell you that I'm kind of weird around the edges.
I mean, you're a slob, too, to be truthful... and I'm a Virgo.
That makes me a little crazy.
But don't you see? The combination is what makes something interesting.
Listen, doll, let's get one thing straight.
I'm a loner. I always have been a loner.
I was a loner when I was a kid.
I was a loner when I was married.
Probably why we broke up.
I'm by myself now because I like it that way.
Nothing personal, but I don't like to talk a lot.
There's too damn much talk in the world as it is.
Listen, I know what you're saying, because...
I know what you mean about being alone.
We're not very different in that department.
I'm a loner, too. I prefer to be alone.
I am alone most of the time.
Thanks a lot, but I don't think it would work out.
I don't want you to over-interpret what I'm saying.
It was something to do.
It was an exciting kind of thing tonight... and I got carried away with it.
Don't worry about me because everything's okay.
I'm not really upset, and I don't know why I'm doing this.
It's just because I was excited tonight, and it seemed like a good idea... and I thought of making these little cards and...
Doll, I'll call you tomorrow.
- You looking for Mr. Whiting?
- Yeah.
- He's not here.
- Do you have any idea when he'll be back?
He hasn't been home for a few days.
If he doesn't get back by Friday, his azaleas are gonna look like shit.
- Really? That's tough.
- You with the police?
- That's right.
- You look kind of old to be a cop.
Don't worry, this is just a disguise.
Listen, when you see Mr. Whiting, tell him to call me at this number.
What do I look like, some kind of social secretary?
No, you certainly do not.
Hi, pop.
Think fast, kid.
Where's the rest of your iron?
Knife. Front pocket.
No hard feelings, pal.
I'm not as young as I used to be.
Okay, pal... let's go see what we can find.
Jump in.
- What?
- This nose-picker here... is crazy enough to try some kind of a dumb play and get himself drilled.
Stay in the middle and tread water.
Show your hands all the time.
- Screw you. This is a cashmere jacket!
- I said, "Jump in."
- This old fart's crazy.
- Jump!
Crap.
Shit!
If you've got something to say, say it and get the hell out.
- Ever hear of a man named Escobar?
- Could be.
- He's dead.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm always sorry to hear any of God's creatures stepping off.
You got any idea who did it?
If I was the cops,
I'd come looking for your wife.
Laura? You're crazy.
Maybe, but she was at Escobar's place last night.
- How do you know?
- I was there.
Had a nice talk with her.
If you were there, you could have killed him.
I wasn't the one
Escobar was blackmailing.
I've got a Vitamaster portable steam bath inside.
Plugs into any 110-volt outlet.
Got a pilot light, automatic timer.
It's an effective, fun way to relax.
Where's your wife? I'd like to talk with her.
She went out, about an hour-and-a-half ago.
Never saw a woman yet who could stand the sight of something like this.
- Must be a couple of days old.
- Jesus Christ, Ronny! Tell him, will you?
I don't know where Laura is.
She disappeared a couple days ago.
Did you know your wife was chippying around with Walter Whiting?
Laura and I have been married three, almost four years.
She's not a happy woman.
Reason I know she's not happy is because she's always talking about it.
I say screw her. What does she know?
A couple of months ago,
I get this call from a lady, Mrs. Whiting.
She's a real fruitcake.
Starts screaming about her putz husband fooling around with Laura...
- and if I don't stop it, she will.
- Come on, I'm sinking.
So I have this encounter with Laura.
Confrontation, know what I mean?
I'm following you.
Laura says she's not only boffing this guy Whiting... she can't stand the sight of me and wants a divorce.
I realize I'm at the moment critique in my marriage.
- Immediately, I get very calm.
- Ronny, please!
I figure this direct confrontation shit is getting me nowhere... except maybe six more months of unhappy crap.
Plus, if in a fit of rage, I should happen to lay one finger upon her...
I'll pay for it the rest of my life.
That's the kind of woman my wife is.
I figure there's got to be an easier way to deal with it.
That's when you decided to have Whiting hit.
Nudged, not hit. Just nudged a little.
Listen, Wells, you find Laura, you bring her back here... and I promise to deliver you a brand-new Coupe DeVille... your choice of color.
I told you before, I'm looking for the louse that nailed Harry Regan.
All new tires. Radials.
Leather seats, headrest, stereo radio, plus a tape deck.
When you want to talk business, give me a call.
I'll throw in 27 tapes. All guaranteed hits!
Popular stars of today, yesterday...
Charles Hatter, my name is Ronald Birdwell.
You got the wrong guy.
You work with a man named Ira Wells.
Right?
I believe this putzola Wells... is behaving in a cheap, immoral fashion.
That's why I've come to ask you for help.
If you choose to take my position... we're talking about a financial package in the five-figure department.
If you don't, it's toilet time.
What I'm looking for is a handgun.
Automatic Colt, .32 caliber, nickel-plated... serial number 473320.
That's simple, isn't it?
A gumball named Ray Escobar used to have it.
He's dead. The gun's disappeared.
I'm depending on you to find it for me.
Comprendo?
Here's my card.
Not to worry, pal. I have confidence in you.
Lamar.
Then I started choking him with his necklace.
I said, "Let's go see your boss."
- This guy is like his bodyguard?
- Yeah.
He's a flunky.
- Check?
- Yeah, thanks.
He's walking ahead of me.
Birdwell's just coming out of the pool.
Looked like a pregnant porpoise.
So I got this joker at this end of the pool, and I stick my rod in his ribs.
I said, "Jump in."
He says to his boss, "This old guy's crazy."
I said, "I'm not crazy, I'm just deaf."
- "Jump in"...
- Wait. He said you were crazy to you?
- Well, sure...
- That makes me mad.
You know what he said? He said,
"I've got a 100% cashmere jacket on.
"I'm not jumping in."
I said, "You're going to jump in."
Get a load of how he jumps in.
Just like this.
He has his shoes on and everything?
- What is it?
- I don't know.
I don't feel so good. My gut.
Maybe I better sit down.
- What is it?
- Jesus. God help me.
What is it, Ira?
Somebody call a doctor.
Ira, are you all right?
I'm fine. I feel fine.
Everything's going to be all right.
I called the ambulance.
They'll be here any minute.
- Help me up, will you, doll?
- Take it easy, okay?
Ira, wait a second.
We'll get you to the hospital.
I'm not going to any goddamn hospital.
You gotta go, so they can find out what's wrong with you.
I know what's wrong with me.
I got a perforated ulcer.
It's starting to bleed again.
In the hospital, they'll want to operate.
Let them. That's better than walking around like this.
I will not go through another goddamn operation.
Lay back down.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's my gut. It's my life.
I won't let anybody call me a goddamn coward.
I went through two operations last year on my gut. Two operations.
Do you realize what it's like in a veterans' hospital... lying on your back for six months, with tubes going every which way?
Maybe I don't have much of a life right now, but it's better than that.
But I'll be goddamned if I let those butchers open me up again. Never!
- I'll blow my brains out first...
- Stop it. Just stop it.
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, doll.
- Want me to go in the house with you?
- No.
- Are you going to be all right?
- I'm fine.
Mr. Wells.
Yes, Mrs. Schmidt?
- May I speak to you for a minute?
- Sure.
I don't know how to say this, Mr. Wells.
You've always been such a good tenant.
Paid your rent on time, you were quiet, until these past few days.
But if you're going to keep young women in your room at night...
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
$42.50 a month, and it's all yours.
Mr. Wells, I'm really terribly sorry about what happened last night... running away like I did.
- Had a nice talk with your husband today.
- You talked with Ronny?
Yup.
He told me if I found you, brought you back to him...
- it would be worth a brand-new Cadillac.
- You wouldn't do that, would you?
Don't be too sure. I could use a car.
Mr. Wells. Ira.
Last night, I felt a very deep compassion coming from you.
I felt a really deep sense of...
Mr. Wells, if you won't help me, there's no one else I can turn to.
I'd offer you a drink, but I don't think there's enough to go around.
Right now,
I think I need it more than you do.
- You kill Whiting's wife?
- No.
Ronny, my husband, is a very violent human being.
When he found out about
Walter Whiting and myself...
I was terrified of what he might do.
And I had this gun... and I gave it to Walter for protection.
That's what Escobar was using to blackmail you with.
He said it was my gun that killed Mrs. Whiting.
And he said... if I didn't pay him that he would hand it over to the police.
All right. Let's go see Whiting.
I don't know where he is.
I swear I don't know.
Listen, lady, any day now some hotshot detective at Homicide... is going to tumble on the fact that this is more than a simple robbery.
When they do, they're going to come looking for Whiting.
If the cops tag him for killing his wife... they'll nail you as an accessory just as sure as I'm sitting here.
There's this place over at Fountain and La Cienega where we used to meet.
All right. Let's go.
Things haven't really been going so great lately.
Not as well as they might have gone... but I don't think that's reason enough for you to give up everything.
Charlotte, there's one thing I want to say.
You know this town doesn't change.
They just push the names around.
If you want to change managers, far be it for me to stand in your way.
I'm just not that type, so go ahead.
I'm telling you, Mr. Wells,
Walter wouldn't be here without me.
We'll see.
No. Walter.
Walter?
God. Oh, my God!
Ronny did this. Ronny killed him.
Hi, this is Margo Sperling. Is Ira Wells in?
Oh, God. No.
If he calls, would you tell him, please, to call me? It's very important.
Margo. Okay, thanks a lot.
- C.S. Hatter Productions.
- Charles, it's Margo.
Do you know where Ira is?
I've got to talk to him.
How the hell would I know?
What's the matter?
Something funny has happened.
I was going to feed Winston tonight.
I've had a lot of trouble getting him back
on schedule since the kidnapping...
and I looked down
and I found this gun laying on the floor.
- No shit.
- I'm pretty sure it's real...
- and I want to find Ira...
- Margo, don't worry. I'll handle it.
I was here this afternoon.
My husband must have followed me.
Mr. Wells, I'm scared.
If my husband can do something like this to Walter... he'll do the same thing to me. He'll kill me.
You've got to help me.
It's raining everywhere these days, lady.
That gun of yours, the one you gave Whiting...
- it was a.32, right?
- I think we should call the police.
Why don't you do that?
I'd like to be around when you try and explain to the cops... that Whiting's wife was murdered in this dump.
Mrs. Whiting caught you and her husband here one night.
There was a fight.
When it was all over, she ends up dead.
Mr. Wells, some of the things
I told you before were untruths.
Still not there?
Tell him that I called again...
Wait, I think this is him. Thanks a lot.
- Ira...
- Hiya, doll.
Margo Sperling. Ron Birdwell, Jeff Lamar.
I'm tied up right now.
I'm working on something.
Would you mind waiting in...
Don't you push me.
Okay.
I'd like to invite you in, but I've got work that I have to finish... so please don't sit down.
What do they think they're doing?
Listen, remember that gun that we were talking about?
This guy Birdwell, he's willing to buy it.
- What about Ira?
- Let me tell you something.
Ira Wells was a broken-down old bum who was never any good to start with.
That schmuck blew every chance he had.
And he'll blow this one, too, if I let him.
We'll give him a couple of thou... let him go to the track and act like a big shot. You know.
Get them out of here.
How the hell long are you gonna stay in there?
- Just a minute, pal.
- I mean it, get them out of here...
- and you get out, too.
- Easy, now.
Hold on. Listen. I'm running into a little...
I'm through shitting around with you, you putzola.
I want you to give me the gun.
Mr. Birdwell, I'm the one that has the gun.
I mean, it's in my possession.
Charles told me what you are offering and I'm...
Wait!
Hit her, for God's sake.
She's got the goddamn gun.
- He has a point, Lamar.
- Wait a second.
If you lay a hand on me, you're gonna pay for it in your next life.
Violence has never solved anything.
If you come one step closer,
I'm gonna break this right in your face.
Answer it.
Hello, doll. Ira.
I'm at Whiting's place.
He's dead.
I've got this whole thing figured out.
- Ira...
- Doll... in case you're interested,
I know who killed Harry Regan.
It was Birdwell.
Stay put, okay?
I'm on my way over to your place.
Don't hang up...
Lamar... how would you like a new Coupe DeVille, color of your choice?
Mr. Wells, I cannot tell you how good it feels... to have finally opened up and told the truth... to have opened up the dark side of my soul.
It's like stepping into the sunlight.
I'm all right.
Listen, he's an old guy. He's not even well.
He needs an operation, one on his stomach.
I know we could talk this over and work something out.
There's no reason to get him.
Mr. Birdwell, let me give you the gun.
Why don't I do that?
I don't know why
I didn't give it to you before.
I know how much you want it, and I don't even care about the gun.
I'll do that, okay?
I'm going to stand up.
See? I'm standing up.
I'm just going to walk across the room.
Here I am. I'm walking across the room.
I'll open this drawer. See me opening it?
Just take it and go.
What about me? What about yours truly?
We had a deal.
"Twelve bills for the gun."
That's a direct quote.
You know, that old guy isn't so dumb.
He's right about Harry Regan.
I killed him.
- Ronny.
- You okay?
Darling, you must think
I'm such a terrible person.
Ira!
Do something. I told you he was sick.
You don't look so good, pop.
Ronny, you ever been to Florida?
They got these old turtles that crawl up on the beach at night.
As a kid, I'd sneak up with a two-by-four and flip them over on their backs.
They looked just like that.
A doctor. I want...
- What did you say, old man?
- I want a...
You wanna know something, punk?
You were born dumb, and you're going to die dumb.
Now get up.
Get up!
Hurry up!
Park it over in that chair.
All right, sit down.
Keep your hands nice and quiet.
And your mouth shut up.
- Are you all right?
- Never been better.
Pretty nice. Pretty slick.
You knew if I fell for it, they'd fall for it, right?
Of course I didn't fall for it.
You son of a bitch, don't you even do that to me again.
What if I had fallen for it?
I could have had a heart attack.
Here's someone I really care about, drop dead at my feet.
How am I supposed to feel about that?
Mentally deranged, that's how.
Probably for the...
Doll, you're still alive, aren't you?
That's another thing. Don't call me doll.
I don't like it.
- Pop, she's a real loony bird.
- You're not?
You don't mind if I sit down, do you?
I've had a tough day.
Kid, just hear me out before you do anything crazy.
We've got this guy between a rock and a hard place, see?
We're in a position to make an A-number-one deal.
Nice to see a man who loves his wife.
Get used to something.
She doesn't love you back.
- Ronny, do something...
- Be quiet.
Laura kills Mrs. Whiting at that love nest over on Fountain Avenue.
She calls Brian Hemphill and gets him to clean up her mess.
Escobar and Brian move the body back to Whiting's house... and fake the stamp caper to throw the cops off the track.
That's water over the dam.
Let's cut to the chase.
Escobar's got the gun Laura used on Mrs. Whiting and blackmails her.
Somewhere along the way...
Birdwell realizes if he can get a hold of that gun...
Laura will have to stick to him like glue for the rest of her life.
Why are you putting my wife under this pressure?
He and this joker go looking for Escobar.
They catch up with him at that palace he had in Santa Monica... put the arm on him... but Lamar gets carried away and kills him.
I can see... this is going to cost me.
By now Whiting's starting to get nervous.
He's in this mess way over his head.
He decides to go to the cops.
Laura couldn't afford that, so she had to kill him.
That's a lie.
That's when you came to me, hoping I'd play the sap for you.
- He's lying.
- No, that's exactly what happened.
You figure I'll want to talk to Whiting.
You take me there, I'll sniff around, and think your husband killed him.
- You don't believe him, do you?
- I'm not saying you're right... but what's the price?
I've been in this business 31 years, give or take a couple of months.
I've always played it on the up and up.
- Call the cops.
- Hold it!
Put that thing down.
You haven't got the ass to swing it.
All my life I've been a loser, from the day I was born.
What makes you any different now?
What makes you think
Birdwell's gonna sit still... for some chiseler like you to take that kind of dough off?
I'll make him, that's why.
Because I've got him by the short hairs.
Yeah, you'll make him, just like Harry Regan made him.
Harry goes to Birdwell, tries to deal himself in... but Birdwell can't gamble on... some two-bit chiseler gumming up the works... so they meet someplace for a payoff.
Birdwell unloads a.45 point-blank into his stomach.
You dumb son of a bitch.
- Didn't I tell you you'd blow it?
- Mr. Wells.
Sit down and shut up.
Six figures.
He was going to pay us six figures.
Police emergency?
It's 3626 Franklin. Apartment 405.
We have a dying man here. Step on it.
Jesus Christ.
How did I ever get mixed up with you in the first place?
You're right, Charlie. I'll never learn.
- I think maybe I better sit down now.
- Yeah.
All right.
- I think I'll sit down.
- Okay.
- You believe in reincarnation?
- I don't know.
Never thought much about it.
I hate to think of Charles just floating around in the eternal void.
I like to think he's gonna drop around again sometime... even if he was pretty non-evolved.
You know what I mean?
Charlie did the best he knew how.
That's for sure.
Where you headed?
I was going to take this number 10 to Highland... then transfer to number four.
That should let me off a couple of blocks from my house.
- What about you?
- I don't know.
Mrs. Schmidt asked me to move out.
That place next door to you, is that still empty?
I don't know, I don't think I could take it.
You just never say anything, for God's sake.
It's not fair. I've to keep up my side of the conversation... and your side of the conversation.
Yeah, that's it. You just never say anything, for God's sake.
I want some feedback from you.
I want to know what you think about things... and what you think about me.
Jesus Christ, would it kill you, if, once in a while, you wore a goddamn dress?
So he caught it.
- But I told her.
- You told her?
I told her, "I don't believe your father dived 400 metres
"and harpooned a whale."
Was I right, Cookie?
Of course you were.
It's not money I'm after.
I told you, it's not blackmail.
I'm obliged to report it.
I know it's disastrous for you.
Wait. My shoelace is undone.
Lori, have a look at that car we just past. Who's inside?
Here.
There are two people inside.
I can only see the one who's talking.
Yes, I can wait a few days.
After that I'm not sure.
- Goodnight, Cookie.
- Goodnight, Sweetie.
- Don't work too late.
- I'll just finish my crossword.
Sleep tight.
Lori...
I told you, it's not blackmail.
Not blackmail... not blackmail...
This hot chick calls me.
She says,
"Your shirt is ready to collect."
I go into the changing room to try it on, and wham!
She whips off her t-shirt and is naked underneath.
- What did you do?
- I bought another 30 shirts!
See you later. It's all yours.
He's asleep.
Damn him.
Oh my God!
Wait there.
- Watch that stick!
- Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
- What did you say?
- I said sorry, it was my fault.
- That's what I thought.
- Here, your cane.
Tell me, what happened here?
A robbery, I think.
Someone beat up the guard.
- When?
- Last night. I'm not sure what time.
- Are you a cop?
- No, I'm a journalist. Excuse me.
- What is your name?
- Giordani.
Press.
Who's the inspector? Spimi?
He's inside. They're all there.
I didn't see anything.
He came from behind.
Over here.
It must be something big.
All the top brass from headquarters are here.
- What was stolen?
- Not a thing.
Any photos?
Professor Terzi, the big boss and his assistants:
Esson, Casoni, Mombelli.
And Braun the German. All here.
Hello, Spimi.
I'll sum it up for you so you might leave us in peace.
It happened at 10:15pm.
The doctor on duty noticed it.
The thief beat up the guard, broke in, then stole nothing.
Not a test tube, not a paper clip, nothing.
Not even a piece of paper.
Odd, eh?
Where's my father?
Anna Terzi. The boss' daughter.
What do they research here?
Genetics, biology.
Biochemistry. Heredity.
They even do pre-nuptial visits for people with loads of cash who want top quality offspring.
They come in, see a pretty nurse, jack off, and bang!
They're told if they have a hereditary disease.
- Or if their gun's jammed.
- Just this bang-bang thing, then?
No, they also do other important studies, top secret.
Our research is undertaken with international partners.
It's highly confidential so I must ask you...
Ah, Anna. Come in.
My daughter.
These gentlemen are investigating the case.
Sit down, dear.
Anna helps me in my work.
She knows everything.
So, gentlemen, as I was saying, our research has far-reaching implications.
Without further tests it can't be made public.
It could be misunderstood, so since nothing was stolen...
Excuse me, Professor, we can't rule out espionage.
Documents could have been copied without being taken away.
Casoni, I'm in charge of this institute.
I can make decisions without your advice.
Not only that.
There's no evidence to suggest espionage.
Unless you know something we don't.
- What? I know nothing.
- Exactly.
There's no point fabricating stories.
However, I asked my staff to check if any documents have been disturbed.
They reported that nothing was out of the ordinary.
So... the professor is right.
We shouldn't overreact.
Hello? Yes, he's here.
Just a moment.
I'm not interested in the reason.
I know, but as I said last night...
I can't see why...
I see. OK, see you at 5:00.
- Hi, Bianca.
- Hi.
Why are the police here?
They nearly didn't let me in.
Someone broke in last night.
Really? What did they take?
Look, I can't leave right now.
I still have some things to do.
I'll pick you up at home later, OK?
- I'm sorry.
- All right.
Listen to me.
I'm the only one who knows what was stolen. And who stole it.
- Are you going to tell the police?
- No.
I'm not telling anyone for the time being.
But this could be a big boost for my career.
- When's she arriving?
- Any minute now.
Hey, we forgot about the starlet.
Come on, she's getting off.
That's it. Big smile.
- Smile, please.
- Hello, boys.
- Stand still.
- Is this OK?
Smile, bitch.
Your train just crushed a guy.
- Hi, Cookie.
- Hi, Sweetie.
Shall I read the paper?
RESEARCHER
BEHEADED BY TRAIN ls the puzzle hard?
- You try. Go on.
- 'C'... 'H'...
- Chopper.
- Like this. 'C'... 'H'... Ear. Cheer.
He's dead.
Who's dead?
The man who was in the car last night.
- The one talking, remember?
- Yes.
The paper says,
"Train Crushes Scientist.
"Dr Calabresi, famous researcher at the Terzi institute
"was killed in an accident at the city's main station."
- There's even a photo.
- Describe it.
A small photo of the man.
Then there's a bigger one.
It shows him falling... in front of the train.
Who wrote the article?
Carlo Giordani.
- Do you remember me?
- Of course. How are you?
- Who are you?
- Lori. This is my uncle.
- I just came to ask...
- Come into my office.
I didn't have time to introduce myself yesterday.
Please sit down.
Here we go.
My name's Franco Arno.
I've come about the death of Dr Calabresi.
You must have noticed the coincidence: the theft at the institute and the death of a scientist, all in the space of a few hours.
But actually, it wasn't really a theft.
And Calabresi's death was an accident.
Our photographer even got a photo.
That's just what I wanted to talk to you about.
The photo shows Dr Calabresi as he's falling, right?
Your photographer - did he ask the laboratory to enlarge a detail?
Or was the whole photo printed?
How do you know all this?
How do I know? Let me explain.
I was blinded in an accident.
But before that
I was a journalist, like you.
Oh, I didn't know.
Wipe that look of pity off your face.
I can't see it but I know it's there.
Believe me, I wasn't...
That's much better, now then...
- Was the photo cropped?
- Cropped?
I don't know, let's find out.
Ask the photographer to look closely at the film.
No, I didn't print it all.
I cropped the left side.
- Have you got the film?
- Yes.
Look at it under a magnifying glass.
Well, I'll be damned.
I hadn't noticed. There's a hand.
It's a bit blurred but you can certainly see it.
It looks like...
...someone pushed him under the train.
Print it. All of it. I'm on my way.
All right.
I bet you were an ace reporter.
Let's get the photo.
Why didn't you tell the cops?
Who'd listen to a blind man and a kid?
Anyway, this is more fun.
I love solving puzzles.
What's wrong?
My friend, the photographer, is dead.
He was killed, then disfigured.
You should go. I've called the police.
Let the cream thicken for ten minutes.
Add pepper, nutmeg, butter and a drop or two of cognac.
Meanwhile, put the pasta in a warm bowl and...
I don't give a damn about your wife's pasta.
- I was just making conversation.
- Very kind of you.
I'd like to know where Spimi has got to.
I'm here.
I had to wait for the doctor's report.
He thinks it's a maniac.
First, he strangles Righetto.
Then uses a razor, or a blade.
Something very sharp.
Thanks. See you later.
Do me a favour, Giordani.
Don't link the two deaths.
It might alert the murderer.
Or murderers.
Do you believe the maniac theory?
That's what the doctor says.
But what do you think?
I don't have any leads.
Only a hunch.
What was Calabresi like?
A bit lifeless.
He lived alone. He was from Padua.
Did he have a wife or a lover?
You're never satisfied, are you, Giordani?
He was engaged and madly in love.
Her name is Bianca Merusi.
A nice girl.
That's all for now.
Mombelli. About 40. Talking to Casoni.
Casoni is about 28. They're arguing.
Now Esson, about 40, in a hurry.
Here's Braun, the German.
Very elegant.
He has a chauffeur driven white Jaguar.
And finally, Terzi and his daughter Anna.
A handsome guy, doesn't look his age.
As for Anna... She's quite a peach.
The cops are on Terzi's tail.
- Why's that?
- I'll tell you why.
They know that the key to the puzzle lies inside the institute.
Calabresi was killed because he discovered something.
Something very important.
- Who is it? Lori?
- Yes.
Say hello to Giordani.
Hello.
- Hi, Cookie.
- Hi, Sweetie.
Why do you call him Cookie?
Cookies are sweet and I love them dunked in chocolate.
We're both alone in the world.
I have no family and she lost her parents.
We're more than father and daughter.
- Well, I'll be off.
- Where to?
To talk to Bianca, Calabresi's fiancée.
If I were you, I'd go and see
Professor Terzi's daughter.
He's a widower, you said.
Yes.
Men who are alone confide in their daughters.
Meanwhile,
Lori and I will drop in on Bianca.
We have a little hunch, don't we?
Yes.
All right. You follow your hunch.
You're starting to enjoy this.
More exciting than your puzzles.
LATEST DETAILS
ON PHOTOGRAPHER'S MURDER
THE WEAPON: A RAZOR?
Honestly, these reporters.
Have you read the article?
It says that the killer might be a barber.
Those are the exact words.
Right, Pepe?
A mad barber? I ask you.
Where do reporters get their ideas?
Put your head back.
Feeling a bit hot, sir?
It's totally absurd.
Let's suppose one of us goes crazy and cuts someone up with a razor.
We wouldn't just hack him at random.
Think about it.
Years and years of handling our customers' throats.
Always careful to avoid the slightest slip.
If one lost his rag, what would he do?
Lop off a nose or an ear?
No, he'd grab a razor, and zap!
A clean slash.
Did I hurt you?
I haven't finished.
- Do it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
Then she adds some ham, chopped very finely, and a tiny clove of garlic.
Do you like garlic?
- No, it gives me heartburn.
- Pity.
- Yes?
- Professor Terzi, please.
- You are?
- Never mind, it's urgent.
- The professor isn't in.
- And his daughter, Anna?
She's not in either.
- The institute is on fire.
- What? A fire?
- Hey, where are you going?
- Where's the professor?
- Out, I said.
- In here?
- I bet he's upstairs.
- He isn't.
- We'll see about that.
- What is it?
This madman forced his way in.
- Who are you?
- Carlo Giordani.
I'm a reporter. Can I talk to you?
- No, I'm busy.
- It's important. it's about the murder.
What murder?
- Calabresi's.
- But it was an accident.
So they say, but it was murder.
Very well. Come up.
I'll see you later.
- Signorina Merusi?
- Yes.
Would you mind if we talked?
Esson? Come up a minute, please.
Goodbye.
You could do with learning some manners.
Poor Esson. Take pity on him.
I just refused to be his mistress for the hundredth time.
What's your name?
Carlo Giordani. As I said earlier.
- Are you always so frank?
- Not always.
Why the secrets with my father?
I gave him some information.
And he gave me some.
- And then?
- He decided to investigate certain facts.
- And me others.
- Such as?
To do with the institute.
There's no need to be mysterious after forcing your way in.
You are rude. Bloody journalist.
You're not so refined.
Look at the way you're sitting, showing off me your legs.
Can't say I'm impressed, although your legs aren't bad.
You don't like my manner?
I've tried changing but I can't.
So be it.
What a tirade!
I deserve it. Let's call a truce.
Take me somewhere. Come on.
I'm sorry I can't help.
If the police can't find it in this house, how can I?
It was just an idea.
Excuse the intrusion.
Lori, what did she have round her neck?
A watch on a gold chain.
An old watch with a photo of the dead man.
Hello. it's Bianca.
We may be in trouble.
Some guy has been round.
See the car behind us?
It's the police. Watch this.
They're mad.
There aren't any seatbelts.
- Scared?
- No.
Crazy idiots!
Thanks.
My father founded the institute.
He recently hired four genetics experts.
They're working on two projects.
One is on a revolutionary new drug.
The other is a government project.
It's highly confidential research into the variation of chromosomes XYY which apparently indicates criminal tendencies.
I've read about research in the US - an interesting theory.
Not just interesting, it's explosive.
It's already been used by the defence in four criminal trials.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm just a bit edgy.
So many odd things have happened.
Like what?
Nothing important.
It's probably just my imagination.
You asked about my father's assistants.
Esson you've met.
He's English. Well respected.
Outside of work he has a good sense of humour.
But at work he can be very hard.
Even violent.
Mombelli's a good technician, but without much ambition.
He lives in my father's shadow.
And Casoni.
The prodigy of the group.
He got his doctorate very young.
He's had a brilliant career with international recognition.
Then there's Braun.
- A strange guy.
- In what way?
He hangs out at St Peter's Club.
Professor Braun?
- Yes?
- Can we talk?
Of course. Join us.
No, thank you.
It's a delicate matter.
All right.
I'll be right back.
Please, sit down.
So, what is it?
- Well, I just...
- Wow, what wonderful eyes.
- Really?
- Stupendous.
Blue shot with red. Very rare.
It's rare? I didn't know.
- What do you do?
- I'm a journalist.
Don't go.
I want to talk to you about the institute.
It's OK, Manuel. Everything's fine.
Calabresi was in fact murdered.
- Really?
- And I have a hunch.
Someone at the lab is selling information about the secret drug.
That's your opinion.
What can I say?
- Am I right or wrong?
- I'm not the least bit interested.
There's a spy. So what?
I'm a scientist, not a detective.
I've already been questioned three times by the police.
Very embarrassing.
What did you tell them?
Everything I know.
That is...
...nothing.
Do you want some advice?
Leave the investigating to them.
Industrial espionage is hot stuff.
A dangerous game.
You might get your fingers burnt.
The car.
At the station.
Stop.
Wait here.
5:00pm - Station Appointment with...
Here's what we've got so far.
The five scientists.
With Anna, that makes six.
And Bianca Merusi.
Seven.
The missing photographs.
Eight.
The break-in at the institute.
Nine.
- Anything else?
- No, nothing else.
That's all, then.
Nine leads to follow.
A cat with nine tails.
Cat o' nine tails - the navy whip.
If we could grab just one, we might solve the puzzle.
We must be quick because the killer is getting desperate.
- Shall I get it?
- No, let me.
- Hello.
- It's Bianca Merusi.
I know who murdered my fiancé.
Yes. Of course.
I'm...
Just a minute. Don't hang up.
I heard a noise in the back.
I'll take a look.
No, I'm not imagining it.
I found a note that proves it.
Give it to the police for me.
Yes, I want the murderer caught.
But I want to stay out of it.
All right.
I'll explain when I see you.
OK, see you in a short while.
She was murdered.
That's why she didn't show up.
Damn it.
The police found something interesting in her flat.
But I don't know what it was.
I also have some news.
This came this morning.
A PUZZLE ENTHUSIAST
AND A REPORTER DECIDED
TO FIND OUT WHY
SOME PEOPLE DIE
AND ENDED UP
ON THE SAME LIST
I thought we'd kept out of it but no such luck. He's onto us.
Looks like it.
- Does it worry you?
- I'm not worried about myself.
It's Lori I'm worried for.
I've sent her away.
To an old friend's.
Good.
So, what next?
We drop everything and save our skins.
That would be sensible.
By the way, I've been investigating our researchers.
Mombelli is clean, but Casoni...
He was fired from his last job.
I couldn't find out why but his past is a bit dubious.
Aren't all our pasts a little bit dubious?
Braun is living the high life.
Villas, yachts, parties.
Where does he get the money?
Professor Terzi, may I talk to you?
I'm afraid I'm about to go out.
- It's important. May I come in?
- Very well.
This is strictly confidential.
- Swear you won't publish it.
- Of course.
First, we're on our way to developing a wonder drug which will eliminate hereditary diseases and deformities.
Second, there's the XYY.
As you know, chromosome structure is made up of X and Y genes.
To simplify this, a shape has been devised in the form of a triangle, like this.
It's composed of rows of alternating X and Y genes.
This triangle ends with an X and a Y.
Except that in very rare cases the structure ends in an X followed by two Ys.
Well, recently an American research team examined the inmates of a prison and made an amazing discovery.
Of the 200 convicted murderers examined, a very high percentage had the extremely rare XYY pattern.
So this XYY pattern indicates a criminal tendency?
At least a tendency to abnormal aggression.
You can see that this would challenge both psychoanalysis and the present state penal system.
So, to totally eliminate crime and violence, you would simply examine children at birth and isolate those with the XYY pattern.
I see.
Any thoughts about the break-in and the murders?
Of course.
But don't expect me to tell you.
I value my life too highly.
No, I have no suspicions.
It's just been a series of accidents and coincidences.
The police and press are the ones looking for connections.
But there aren't any.
- So everything's normal?
- Absolutely.
Have many people had the XYY test?
Who told you about our research?
Professor Terzi.
About 500 people in total.
Including the staff from the institute?
Yes. All of us.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very busy.
Goodbye.
- Goodnight.
- How are things?
Not so great.
The humidity is bad for my rheumatism.
Inspector Spimi?
No, he's just gone out.
Ask him to phone Carlo Giordani.
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Come in.
- Nice place.
- Thanks.
- How come...?
- What?
Paying a visit at this time of night.
I wanted a chat.
A chat? With me?
Are you tired of your friends?
I might want new friends.
Why did you come?
Stop being so defensive.
I just didn't expect to see you.
Well, I'm here now.
Right.
I'm sorry. Would you like a drink?
I've only got milk.
No, thank you.
Do you know how many people make love every second?
- No.
- 780, on average. Seriously.
And I wouldn't like to lower the average.
I realised that.
But I wanted to see what trick you'd use to get me into bed.
None at all.
- Milk?
- Yes, please.
- Hello.
- It's Arno, they tried...
- What?
- ...to kill me by tampering with my gas.
I only just had time to open the window.
Oh my God.
No problem at your end?
They'll probably try. Watch out.
Right. Thanks.
Did you drink any?
- Got the idea?
- What's going on?
They tried to kill me, the milk.
It's poisoned.
You be careful too.
Stay away from the city.
You think I should?
My father wants us to go to our country place this weekend.
Then go.
For the weekend, you said?
When will you be back?
Sunday night.
Polecat, hound dog, skunk.
Coon, turd, crud.
Slimeball, bed-wetter, snot-nose.
The priest: 125.
Gigi the Loser:
137 insults without stopping.
The winner is Gigi the Loser.
Cough up.
Ball-breaker. I forgot that one.
I see you're in good form.
You got some new ones.
I had a Tunisian cellmate.
He knew a few that I didn't.
Have you got a minute?
- Gigi, I need a favour.
- Go ahead.
- For old times' sake.
- Anything you say.
I need a little job doing.
Only you can do it.
Have you gone crazy?
Forget it, I'm straight now.
I'm helping Mother in the shop.
No, this is different.
Do you like melons? I have loads.
It's easy. It will be fine.
Nothing's easy for me. I get arrested just for looking at a Cinquecento.
It's no coincidence that I'm called Gigi the Loser.
Look, it's not a robbery.
We're not stealing anything.
- We're just opening a few drawers.
- Locked?
Well, probably.
Breaking and entering - three years and seven months.
Wouldn't it be funny if Professor Terzi came back and surprised us?
Done.
It happens.
- Not bad.
- Come on.
- Are you sure no one's in?
- Definitely.
You said no one was home.
Son of a bitch.
I was misinformed.
Wait. Now we're inside, let's do it.
Yes, but we're locked in.
Can't you even open a door?
All right, but make it quick.
Gigi, come here.
Callard and Smith. 1953.
Piece of cake.
"Anna Marini, born 26th April 1948 and resident in this city...
"...declares that Fulvio Terzi adopts Anna Marini."
She's not his daughter.
Open it.
"I founded the institute.
It will carry my name.
"There's something wrong with me. I am unable to have normal relationships...
"Professor P. says it's a question of induced fantasies.
"Anna is a very beautiful girl.
She will become a splendid woman.
"I adore her. I ask myself, does a father normally have these feelings?
"Anna has turned 18.
I am happy when she is near me.
"Why does Anna despise me?
She doesn't love me. I'm sure of it."
Let's go.
What did you find out?
Don't get mad. I can't tell you.
We have a press conference tomorrow.
A press conference?
But you promised...
To give you exclusivity?
Try to understand, it wouldn't be right.
You're a real bastard.
Naturally. Cops are all bastards.
We force confessions, we're corrupt.
We bash students' heads in.
On the other hand, I've got some gossip mongers for assistants.
Morsella, for example.
He has a very loose tongue.
He can never keep a secret.
I'll shut him up one of these days.
I bet if you went to see him he'd probably let slip that in Bianca Merusi's closet we found 10 million lire cash and a file on the Terzi drug.
Can you imagine?
She seemed so innocent.
She seduced Calabresi to get inside the institute.
- Aren't you teetotal?
- Yes, I still am.
If you insist, Morsella will tell you
Braun and the girl met often.
It certainly wasn't for sex.
He's queer.
- Have you arrested him?
- Don't ask me.
Ask Morsella.
He might say that Braun hasn't been seen since Bianca died. Morsella!
What a big mouth.
Good thing I keep an eye on him.
GERMAN SCIENTIST
SUSPECTED OF THREE MURDERS
- Signor Giordani?
- Yes.
May I come in?
I have some news which may interest you.
I'm sorry, but I don't recall...
Don't try, we've never met.
May I?
My name wouldn't mean anything.
I read your article about Braun.
I know you're looking for him.
I can tell you where he is.
But hurry, he's about to leave.
Look, my paper isn't rich.
It's not a question of money.
I just want him caught.
For reasons I won't trouble you with but which you can imagine.
I prefer to avoid the police.
That's why I've come to you.
If you hurry, you can find Braun in a villa on the outskirts of the city.
The address is Via Rovereto 20.
Thanks.
You may despise me.
You may think I'm an informer.
What I'm doing is contemptible.
But I must take revenge.
Do you know the boy with Braun,
Manuel?
Braun stole him from me.
Manuel was with me first.
We were together for three years.
When Braun goes to prison,
I hope Manuel will come back.
If not, I'll kill myself.
Professor Braun? Are you here?
Don't worry, I'm not with the cops.
Where's Braun? Tell me.
- Bastard, you know where.
- Damn it, has he left?
- You've never been here before?
- I asked you where Braun is.
Over there.
Another dead end.
We're back at square one.
- Do you want some help?
- My hands still work.
Besides, I like eggs done my way.
There's cheese.
We've got scandal but no killer.
- These grapes are good.
- Help yourself.
There's just one thing missing.
And that is?
The note Bianca told us about.
- The killer must have it.
- Maybe.
But Bianca was a shrewd operator.
She may have hidden it.
Her bag would be too obvious.
An old watch with a photo of the deaf man.
Maybe... maybe that's it.
Come on.
Help me.
Wait.
Your cane. Fancy burying the girl with the damn locket round her neck.
Talk about taking secrets to the grave.
SECTOR G
Pity we had to come at night.
Ever heard of daytime grave robbers?
- Are we grave robbers now?
- What else are we?
If someone jumps on us, you're on your own.
I'll hang on to you.
- Damn, it's certainly quiet.
- Right. But something's here.
What?
- Did you hear that?
- Yes. Keep still.
- It may have been a cat.
- Maybe.
They say cats love graveyards.
Did you not know that?
Wait.
This is it. Here we are.
It's padlocked.
It shouldn't be hard to open.
- Shall I go in?
- Go on.
- Come on.
- OK, I'm going.
- If you hear anything, call me.
- Go on, hurry.
- They haven't put her away yet.
- Good.
How's it going?
I'm unscrewing.
- Can you hear anything?
- Nothing.
- It stinks.
- We're not on a mountain hike.
Found it!
Open it.
- Nothing. Only the face.
- Open the back.
- Nothing.
- It's empty.
Bring it here. Give it here.
Hurry.
Come on!
What's that?
A small spring.
Break it.
It's here, I've found it.
What does it say?
It's stuck together.
I'm worried I might rip it.
We'll read it later.
There. Put it back.
That's it.
Arno?
Arno, what's going on?
Open up.
For God's sake open the door.
Shit.
Giordani?
Say something.
Where are you? Don't play games.
I'm here.
Giordani.
Where are you?
Let's get out of here quick.
What happened up there?
Lori... He's got Lori.
He wanted the note.
- But you didn't give...
- I had no choice.
- It was the only evidence.
- Now we have some more.
- What would that be?
- I stabbed him. I heard him yell.
We may be in time to find Lori.
- She left a while ago.
- I said to keep her here.
- The taxi driver brought a note.
- What note?
- This one.
- Let's see.
Are we going to see Cookie?
Why don't you answer?
Tell me or I won't get in.
Will the driver who went to Via Frentani 12 report immediately to Piazza Duomo?
Thanks.
- Hello.
- I have the child.
I'll kill her if you tell the police.
No, I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep her for a few days.
Keep your mouths shut.
I have some business to finish.
If anything happens, you'll get her back with her throat cut.
Arno, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
Someone who's killed four times won't hesitate at killing a child.
Have you got friends in the police?
The wound is proof, it's not easy to hide.
All right. I'll do it.
I'll help you.
- Remember...
- We'll do it your way. No publicity.
Morsella...
Morsella, come up.
I need to talk to you.
What's wrong?
In there.
Well? What happened?
Lots of things.
A lot of them to do with you.
First, you're not Terzi's daughter.
- I'd have told you...
- You're more than that to him.
Yes. I'd have told you.
- Let's talk.
- We'll talk some other time.
There are more important things to deal with.
First. the night you came to my flat, the killer left shortly before.
- What are you saying?
- Second, you held the glass before I threw it away but didn't drink from it.
Maybe you knew it tasted bad.
Another coincidence, tonight Arno stabbed the killer.
How did you hurt your hand?
You added things up when you found out about me and Terzi?
It got me thinking.
Stupid narrow-minded journalist.
Two and two make four.
An Italian-style equation.
Whore plus liar equals murderer.
And I thought
I'd met a civilized man.
Excuse me,
I found this broken vase upstairs.
Is it a deep cut?
Let's go. We're done here.
Everyone comes in through the main door, except the directors.
They have their own keys and come in by a side door.
Come on.
- Where now?
- This way.
No, I can't.
You go. I'd rather wait here.
As you wish.
Nothing here either.
Check these rooms.
Nothing here either.
- Not here either.
- We're done.
It's no use. She's not here.
We can only inform headquarters.
Then start a full-scale search.
Do you agree?
Yes. Fine.
- Where's the phone?
- On the 5th floor.
Casoni?
They put your life at risk.
I warned them.
Giordani? Where are you?
Over there!
Stay there. Don't move.
Stay or I'll run this right through you.
- It's you?
- Leave him, Arno.
Don't come any closer or I'll kill him.
I had to do it.
I had no choice.
I found out that I had the XYY variant.
That I was predisposed to murder.
- They would have thrown me out.
- What did you do with Lori?
I replaced my file with a negative one.
No one would have known but for Calabresi.
He tried to blackmail me.
I had to kill him.
Shut up.
I'm not interested.
Where is Lori?
- I killed her.
- Leave him. He's mad.
You'll never get her back.
I killed her.
How could you kill an innocent child who was only eight years old?
Cookie?
Cookie!
All right, Curly, enough's enough.
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.
I just had them installed on Wednesday.
Down the hatch.
- She's no good.
- What can I tell you, kid? You're right.
When you're right, you're right.
And you're right.
I'll pay you the rest next week.
We only caught 60 tonne of skipjack down in San Benedict.
And they don't pay you the same for skipjack as they do albacore or tuna.
Forget it, will you, Curly?
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.
What kind of a guy do you think I am?
- Thank you, Mr. Gittes.
- Call me Jake.
Careful driving home, Curl, huh?
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.
Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. Gittes?
- Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?
- Mr. Gittes.
Now, what seems to be the problem?
My husband,
I believe, is seeing another woman.
- No. Really?
- I'm afraid so.
I am sorry.
Mr. Gittes, please, do you think we could discuss this alone?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
These are my operatives, and at some point, they're going to have to assist me.
I can't do everything myself.
Of course not.
Now, what makes you certain that your husband is involved with someone?
A wife can tell.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Yes, of course!
- Then go home and forget everything.
- But, l...
I'm sure that he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.
Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?
You're better off not knowing.
I have to know.
Very well.
What is your husband's first name?
Hollis.
Hollis Mulwray.
- Water and Power?
- He's Chief Engineer.
Chief Engineer?
Mrs. Mulwray, this...
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook.
It takes time...
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
Okay, we'll...
We'll see what we can do.
Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop a streetcar, and within 25 minutes, end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.
Now, you can swim in it and you can fish in it, but you can't drink it, and you can't irrigate an orange grove with it.
Now remember, we live next door to the ocean, but we also live on the edge of a desert.
Los Angeles is a desert community.
Beneath this building, beneath our streets, is a desert.
And without water, the dust will rise up and cover us as though we never existed.
Now, the Alto Vallejo can save us from this, and I respectfully suggest that $8.5 million is a fair price to pay to keep the desert from our streets and not on top of them.
Hear, hear!
Mayor Bagby, let's hear from all the departments again.
I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.
Mr. Mulwray?
In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over 500 lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.
Core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster.
It couldn't withstand that kind of pressure.
And now you propose yet another dirt-banked terminus dam with slopes of 2.5:1, 112 feet high, and a 12,000-acre water surface.
Well, it won't hold.
I won't build it. It's that simple.
I'm not going to make the same mistake twice.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Quiet! Quiet!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get those goddamn things out of here!
- Hold some of them.
- Tell me where to take them!
You don't have an answer for that so quick, do you?
You steal water from the Valley, ruin the grazing, starve the livestock!
Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?
That's what I want to know!
- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.
I had to go back three times to pick up the watches.
Yesterday he went to three reservoirs, a men's room at a Richfield gas station, and The Pig'n Whistle.
The guy's got water on the brain.
So what do you got?
This?
Well, they got into a terrific argument outside The Pig'n Whistle.
What about?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud.
I heard only one thing, though.
"Apple core."
- "Apple core"?
- Yeah.
My God, Walsh, is that what you spent your day doing?
Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh.
J. J. Gittes and Associates.
This business requires a certain amount of finesse.
What is it, Sophie?
Duffy's on the phone.
- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!
He's found himself some cute little twist, the old buzzard...
Okay. Slow down. Where are you?
I'm at Glendale and Douglas.
They're in Echo Park in a rowboat.
A rowboat!
Okay.
Echo Park.
Water again.
Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.
You'll love it.
Here. Let me...
When you get so much publicity, you got to get blase about it.
Let's face it, Jake, you're practically a movie star.
- Just look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.
Sure is.
Fools' names and fools' faces.
- What's that, pal?
- Nothing.
You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? And what do you do to make ends meet?
Mortgage department,
First National Bank.
T ell me, did you foreclose on many families this week?
We don't publish a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.
Neither do l.
No, you have your press agent do it.
Who is this bimbo, Barney?
Is he a regular customer or what?
Hey, listen, pal, I make an honest living.
People only come to me when they're in a desperate situation.
I help them out.
I don't kick families out of their houses
- like you bums down at the bank do!
- Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...
Maybe you'd like to step down out of the barber chair and maybe we can go outside and discuss it.
- What do you think?
- Oh, come on.
Jake, let me tell you about the guy who got tired...
I don't know how that thing got in the newspaper.
It was so quick,
I didn't even know it myself.
- Thank you.
- I make an honest living!
Of course you do.
Anyway, this guy who got tired of screwing his wife
- said to his friend, "What do I do?"
- An honest living, you understand?
So the guy says, "Why don't you do what the Chinese do?"
He says, "What do the Chinese do?"
He says, "The Chinese they screw a little and they get tired..."
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!
Sophie, go to the little girls' room for a minute, okay?
- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.
I want to tell you a story.
So, there's this guy, Walsh, you understand?
He's tired of screwing his wife.
- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.
You're always in such a hurry.
So his friend says to him,
"Hey, why don't you do it like the Chinese do?"
So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"
The guy says, "Well, the Chinese, first they screw a little bit,
"then they stop and they go and read a little Confucius.
"Come back, screw a little bit more, then they stop again,
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.
Walsh, just listen to me for a second.
I mean, you'll love this.
Now, then they go back and they screw a little bit more, and then they go out and they contemplate the moon or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.
So, now, the guy goes home and he starts screwing his own wife, see.
So, he screws her for a little bit, and then he stops.
He goes out of the room and reads LIFE magazine.
Then he goes back in, he starts screwing again, and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey" and he goes out and he smokes a cigarette.
Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.
He comes back in the room, he starts screwing again, he gets up to start to leave again to go look at the moon, she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"
Jesus!
That Barney!
Mr. Gittes?
Yes.
Do you know me?
Well,
I think I would have remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Never.
That's what I thought.
You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.
You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?
Not that Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.
And since you agree with me that we've never met before, you must also agree with me that I never hired you to do anything, certainly not spy on my husband.
I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.
Well, you're going to get it.
Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.
I think there's been some misunderstanding here.
There's no point in getting tough with me. I'm just...
I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes.
My lawyer does.
Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.
I suppose we'll be hearing from your attorney.
- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?
Since lunch.
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?
Sir?
Is Mr. Yelburton there?
Is he still in the building?
Very well. Thank you.
Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.
J. J. Gittes.
It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office.
Certainly.
We're a bit nervous around here with all this business in the papers about Mr. Mulwray.
Right this way.
You know, after you've worked with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know his habits, his values.
You come to know him.
And either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
And Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.
Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.
Do you know where Mulwray's having lunch?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Well, tell him I'll be back.
I will.
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?
In case I have to get in touch with you again.
- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.
You don't take a bath in it.
They wrote you a letter!
But then you'd have to be able to read.
Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?
Well, I hope so. He's working for us.
Doing what?
Well, frankly, there have been some threats to blow up the city reservoirs.
- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.
We've had to ration water in the Valley and the farmers are desperate.
But what can we do? The rest of the city needs drinking water.
- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?
When Mulvihill here was Sheriff of Ventura County, the rum runners landed hundreds of tonnes of booze on the beach and never lost a drop.
He ought to be able to hold on to your water for you.
J. J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.
Please.
You wait.
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.
Bad for the glass.
Mr. Gittes.
Actually, I came to see your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
- lced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.
- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.
My husband's at the office.
Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray, and he's checked out of his apartment at the El Macondo.
That's not his apartment.
Anyway, l...
The point is, is I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray, whoever set your husband up, set me up.
L. A.'s a small town. People talk.
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.
- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.
So let's just drop the whole thing.
- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.
- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?
...I don't want to drop it.
I better talk to your husband about this.
Why? What on Earth for?
Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Well, I've been accused of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
Look, somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here, and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.
I'm not supposed to be the one who's caught with his pants down.
So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.
Why should it be a problem?
- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was pretty, in a cheap sort of a way, of course.
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?
- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!
It couldn't be more personal.
Is this business or an obsession with you?
Let's look at it this way.
Now, this phony broad, excuse the language, she tells me she's you. She hires me.
Now, whoever put her up to it doesn't have anything against me.
They're out to get your husband.
If I can see him, I can help him.
Did you talk to him this morning?
No.
I went riding rather early.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I was riding bareback.
You...
You might try the Oak Pass or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.
Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.
Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.
I'll stop by.
Please call first.
Sorry, closed to public, sir.
Oh, that's all right, Officer.
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.
- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?
- What's going on here?
- Loach!
Hello, Jake.
Lou. How are you?
Lousy cold I can't seem to shake, but otherwise, I'm okay.
- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.
There's no smoking here, sir...
That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.
I'll see he's careful with the matches and doesn't burn himself.
Thanks, Lou.
How'd you get past the guard?
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
You look like you've done well by yourself.
I get by.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself.
Maybe you have.
Yeah, going through other people's dirty linen.
Yeah. Tell me, you still putting Chinamen in jail for spitting in the laundry?
You're a little behind the times, Jake.
They use steam irons now.
And I'm out of Chinatown.
Since when?
Since I made lieutenant.
Congratulations.
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.
Who?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Yeah.
I'd like to talk to him.
So you'd like to talk to him, huh?
You're welcome to try.
There he is.
Looks like he was washed down the entire length of the run-off channel.
- Could he swim?
- Of course.
Obviously, the fall must have knocked him unconscious.
Mrs. Mulwray, this alleged affair your husband was having.
The publicity didn't make him morose, or unhappy?
It didn't make him happy.
There is no possibility that he would have taken his own life?
No.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young lady in question?
No.
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.
You and your husband never discussed her?
He...
We did.
He wouldn't tell me her name.
We quarrelled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.
A complete surprise?
I thought you hired a private investigator.
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.
Yes, but I did that because I thought I would put an end to a ridiculous rumor that had no basis.
When did Mr. Gittes inform you that these rumors had some foundation in fact?
Just before the story broke in the papers, Lou.
You wouldn't happen to know where I could find her?
No.
- Or her name?
- No.
Of course not.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.
If we need any more information, we'll be in touch.
Of course you have my deepest sympathy.
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.
- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- T ake it easy, guys. Let us get through.
We better do this in a hurry.
Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!
You want a picture, guys? Here it is!
"Gittes", two T's and an E.
Thank you for going along with me back there.
I just didn't want to explain anything.
I'll send you a check.
A check?
T o make it official that I've hired you.
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.
Jake, what are you doing here?
Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.
Thought I'd drop by and see who dropped dead lately.
Yeah? Isn't this something?
Middle of a drought, and the Water Commissioner drowns.
- Only in L. A.
- Yeah.
- Looks pretty banged up.
- Well, it's a long fall.
So how are you doing, Morty?
Never better, except for this darn cough.
- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.
Who you got there?
Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.
Quite a character.
Lately he'd been living in one of the downtown storm drains.
Had a bureau dresser down there and everything.
All right, there.
Yeah. He drowned, too.
Come again?
Yeah. Got drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
The L. A. River?
Yeah, right under Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?
Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.
It's not completely dry.
Well, he ain't gonna exactly drown in a damp riverbed, no matter how soused he is.
We got water out of him. He drowned!
Hello.
Howdy.
You were riding out here the other day, weren't you?
Do you speak English?
You were talking to a man a few days ago. He wore glasses...
Yes.
What did you talk about, do you mind my asking?
- The water.
- What about the water?
- When it comes.
- When it comes?
What did you tell him?
It comes in different parts of the river.
Every night a different part.
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.
Hold it there, kitty-cat! Hold it!
Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?
You're a very nosy fellow, kitty-cat, huh?
You know what happens to nosy fellows?
No? Want to guess? No?
Okay. They lose their noses.
Next time you lose the whole thing.
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.
Understand?
- Understand?
- Don't you understand, Gittes?
I understand.
All right.
So some contractor wants to build a dam, and he makes a few payoffs. So what?
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
They'll claim you were trespassing.
Don't want Mulvihill.
I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Then what do you do?
Sue the shit out of them.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.
- Who?
- Ida Sessions.
Don't know her. T ake a number.
Sue people like that, they're liable to be having dinner with the judge who's trying the suit.
I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.
She says you know her.
Okay.
Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Oh, yes, we have.
- Are you alone?
- lsn't everyone?
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm a working girl.
I didn't come in to see you on my own.
When did you come in?
I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?
- Shut the fuck up.
- Beg your pardon?
- Y es, I remember.
- Beg your pardon? Is something wrong?
No. I was just checking a detail or two with my two associates.
Go on.
I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray.
The point is, if it ever comes out,
I want somebody to know that I didn 't know what would happen.
I understand.
Who was your employer?
That could be helpful to both of us.
Oh, no! Oh, no.
No.
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.
No, Mr. Gittes.
Just look in the obituary column of today's L. A. Post-Record.
The obituary column?
- You'll find one of those people.
- "Those people"? Miss...
Sure.
How do you like them apples?
Ma'am.
Thank you for coming.
- Yes, sir?
- Drink?
T om Collins.
With lime, not lemon, please.
Tom Collins with lime.
I got your check in the mail.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
How much would you like?
Oh, stop it, the money's fine.
It's generous.
But I think you short-changed me on the story.
- I have?
- I think so.
Something else besides the death of your husband was bothering you.
You were upset, but not that upset.
Mr. Gittes, don't tell me how I feel.
Sorry.
Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, all of it quicker than the wind from a duck's ass.
Excuse me.
- Then you ask me to lie to the police...
- lt wasn't much of a lie.
If your husband was killed, it was.
This could look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
But he wasn't killed.
Mrs. Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.
Well,
I suppose I am.
Actually, I knew about the affair.
- How did you find out?
- My husband.
He told you?
And you weren't the least bit upset?
I was grateful.
Mrs. Mulwray, you'll have to explain that.
Why?
Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my metier.
When a wife tells me that she's happy that her husband is cheating on her, it runs contrary to my experience.
Unless what?
She was cheating on him.
Were you?
I dislike the word "cheat".
Did you have affairs?
- Mr. Gittes...
- Did he know about it?
Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him every time I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Is there anything else you want to know about me?
Where were you when your husband died?
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
- I mean I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone, too.
For very long?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.
It's difficult for me.
Now, I think you know all you need know about me.
I didn't want publicity.
I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now.
Is that all?
By the way, what does this "C" stand for?
"Cross."
- It's your maiden name?
- Yes.
Why?
No reason.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
No. I'm just a snoop.
No. I have my own car. The Packard.
Wait a minute, sonny.
I think you better come with me.
But why? There's nothing more to say.
Will you get my car, please?
Okay, go home.
But in case you're interested, your husband was murdered.
Somebody's been dumping thousands of tonnes of water from the city's reservoirs, and we're supposed to be in the middle of a drought.
He found out about it, and he was killed.
There's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue.
Involuntary manslaughter, if anybody wants to take the trouble, which they don't.
It seems like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine by me.
But, Mrs. Mulwray,
I goddamn near lost my nose, and I like it.
I like breathing through it.
And I still think that you're hiding something.
Mr. Gittes...
J. J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
I take a long lunch hour.
All day, sometimes.
Noah Cross worked for the Water Department.
Yes.
- No.
- Well, did he or didn't he?
He owned it.
He owned the Water Department?
Yes.
You mean, he owned the entire water supply for the city?
Yes.
How did they get it away from him?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the water.
Mr. Mulwray?
I thought you said Cross owned it.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
- They were partners?
- Yes! Yes, they were partners.
Mr. Yelburton will see you now.
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.
These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Yeah. Must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Yes. Hollis was the best department chief the city's ever had.
My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Cut myself shaving.
Well, you ought to be more careful.
That must really smart.
Only when I breathe.
Only when you breathe.
Don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray.
- I never was.
- I don't understand.
Neither do l, actually.
You hired me.
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Well, let's look at it this way.
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.
He had a reputation that was hard to get around.
You decided to ruin it.
Then he found out you were dumping water at night.
Then he was...
Drowned.
Mr. Gittes, that's an outrageous accusation.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will.
Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought, that's news.
Mr. Gittes, we're...
We're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate orange groves in the Northwest Valley.
As you know, the farmers out there have no legal right to our water, but we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under.
Naturally, when you divert water, there's a little run-off.
Yeah. A little run-off.
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- ln the Northwest Valley.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.
- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?
Yes.
I don't want to nail you.
I want to find out who put you up to it.
I'll give you a few days to think about it.
Call me. I can help.
Who knows?
Maybe we can put the whole thing off on a few big-shots, and you can stay the head of the department for the next 20 years.
- Drink?
- No, thank you.
What is your usual salary?
$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates, plus expenses, plus a bonus if I show results.
Whoever is behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Money.
How they plan to make it out of emptying reservoirs, that I don't know.
I'll pay your salary, plus $5,000 if you find out what happened to Hollis, and who is involved.
Sophie, draw up one of our standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
T ell me something.
Did you get married before or after
Mulwray and your father sold the Water Department?
Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?
Yes, of course.
It was sometime after.
I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Then you married your father's business partner.
You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.
Does my talking about your father upset you?
Why, no.
Yes. A little.
You see, Hollis and my...
My father had a falling-out finally.
Over you or over the Water Department?
Not over me. Why should it be over me?
Then it was over the Water Department.
Yes.
Hollis felt that the water should belong to the public, and I don't think my father felt that way.
Actually, it was over the Van der Lip Dam.
You know, the dam that broke?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.
They never spoke from that time on.
You sure about that?
Of course I'm sure.
Sign here.
The copy's for you.
- Mr. Gitts?
- Gittes.
How do you do?
You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gitts.
I like that.
Thanks.
If you were a bank president, that would be one thing, but in your business, it's admirable.
And it's good advertising.
It doesn't hurt.
It's why you attracted a client like my daughter.
Probably.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
How'd she get that idea?
I think I gave it to her.
I hope you don't mind. I believe they should be served with the head.
Fine. Long as you don't serve chicken that way.
T ell me, what do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant.
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah.
Where from?
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
Honest?
As far as it goes.
Of course, he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Of course, but you've no reason to think he's bungled the case?
- None.
- That's too bad.
T oo bad?
It disturbs me. Makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride.
Financially speaking, of course.
What are you charging her?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I get results.
Are you sleeping with her?
Come, come, Mr. Gitts.
You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
If you want an answer to that question, Mr. Cross,
I'll put one of my men on the job.
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Gitts...
- Gittes.
- Gittes.
You're dealing with a disturbed woman who just lost her husband.
I don't want her taken advantage of.
- Sit down.
- What for?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
Why is that funny?
It's what the District Attorney used to tell me in Chinatown.
Yeah? Was he right?
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.
Mainly that you're rich, and too respectable to want your name in the newspapers.
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.
Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.
I'll double whatever your fee is and pay you $10,000 if you find Hollis' girlfriend.
- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Maybe.
If Mulwray was murdered, she'd be one of the last to have seen him alive.
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece towards the Sheriff's re-election.
I let them practice up out here.
Yeah.
Do you remember the last time you saw Mulwray?
At my age, you tend to forget.
It was five days ago outside
The Pig'n Whistle, and you had one hell of an argument.
I got the pictures in my office, if that'll help you remember.
- What was the argument about?
- My daughter.
What about her?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.
I'd like to help her if I can.
I had no idea you and Hollis were that fond of one another.
Hollis Mulwray made this city, and he made me a fortune.
We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what the argument was about.
My daughter's a very jealous woman.
I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
How did you find out?
I still got a few teeth left in my head, and a few friends in town.
Okay.
I'll...
I'll have my secretary draw up the papers.
T ell me, are you frightened for the girl or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
I'll look into it, as soon as I've checked out some orange groves.
Orange groves?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could you tell me where the plat books for the Northwest Valley are?
Part of it's in Ventura County.
We don't have Ventura County in our Hall of Records.
Well, then, I'll settle for Los Angeles County.
Row 23, section C.
Weasel.
Say, sonny, why do they have all those names pasted in the plat books?
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.
Well, that means that most of the Valley sold in the last few months.
If that's what it says.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.
I'd like to be able to read across.
Why, thank you.
Hold it right there!
All right, quit it. Quit, now!
Search the man. See if he's armed.
I said see if he's armed, not empty his pockets!
Search him. Search him!
He ain't armed.
All right, mister, who you with, the Water Department or the Real Estate Office?
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!
You come near me with that thing again, you're gonna need a pair of them!
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
I said cut that out! Give the man a chance to say something!
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.
I'm not with either one of them.
Then what you doing out here, mister?
A client hired me to see...
T o see if the Water Department was irrigating your land.
Irrigating my land?
The Water Department's been sending you people out here to blow up my water tanks, they put poison down three of my wells.
I call that a funny way to irrigate.
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch who's done it to us.
Mulwray's dead. You don't know what you're talking about, you dumb Okie.
Well, that's that.
What's going on?
You didn't look too good, so we thought we better call your employer.
Thanks for coming.
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L. A. into building it.
But the water's not gonna go to L. A., it's coming right here.
To the Valley?
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.
I was at the Hall of Records today.
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,
Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000, and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.
They're blowing these farmers out of their land and then picking it up for peanuts.
You have any idea what this land would be worth with a steady water supply?
About $30 million more than they paid for it.
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.
Jasper Lamar Crabb.
Jasper Lamar Crabb.
- We got it!
- What?
- We got it.
- What? What is it?
"A memorial service was held at the Mar Vista lnn today
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."
He passed away two weeks ago.
Why is that unusual?
He passed away two weeks ago, and one week ago he bought the land.
That's unusual.
Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?
Yes, I hope so.
It's Dad.
I can't seem to handle him anymore.
- Can l, sweetheart?
- My goodness.
Nothing with Dad. It's me.
Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel with everyone else.
- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.
Of course, I'm anxious for him to have the best, and money is no object.
Perhaps if we met with your father.
- There is one question.
- Of course.
Do you accept people of the Jewish persuasion?
I'm sorry, but we don't.
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.
We just wanted to be sure, didn't we, hon?
Would it be possible for me to see a list of your patients, just to be certain?
We never reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy.
You would appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
That's exactly what I wanted to hear you say.
Good.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
No. Allow me to show you.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just if you'll confine yourself to the main building.
It's almost bedtime.
We understand. Come, my sweet.
Charlie! You ought to know better than that!
Sit down. Have a chair.
They're all there. Every goddamn name.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000-acre empire.
They can't be.
They may not know it, but they are.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.
Well, I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
Why?
Did you know you were a very wealthy woman?
Oh, I'm not.
- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.
Some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property at Long Beach, but we lost it.
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.
Where did you get this piece of material?
At the Abbacore Club.
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.
It's a fish.
My grandson is a member, and they take very nice care of us.
How do they do that?
Oh, give us things, not just like this old flag, but...
But what?
We're a sort of unofficial charity of theirs, Mr. Gittes.
Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.
Goodbye, ladies.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.
Can we leave the lady out of this?
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.
Get in the car.
Maid's night off?
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?
- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.
Easy. It's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
I guess you're right.
T o you, Mrs. Mulwray.
Frankly, tonight, you saved my...
You saved my neck.
T ell me, Mr. Gittes, does this often happen to you?
What's that?
Well, I'm judging only on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if this is how you go about your work,
I'd say you'd be lucky to get through a whole day.
Actually, this hasn't happened to me for a long time.
When was the last time?
Why?
It's an innocent question.
- ln Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?
As little as possible.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
They do in Chinatown.
Why did you leave the police force?
Do you have any peroxide, or anything like that?
Surely. Will you come this way?
My God!
It's a nasty cut.
I had no idea...
Sorry!
There.
Is it painful?
It must be painful.
What's wrong?
Your eye.
What about it? What?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh, that.
It's a flaw in the iris.
- A flaw?
- Yes.
A sort of birthmark.
Did you wear a uniform?
Sometimes.
Must have looked cute in blue.
Give me a break, will you?
I don't know you.
I want to know more about you.
Not now.
You really don't like to talk about the past, do you?
I'm tired.
No. Why does it bother you to talk about it?
- lt bothers everybody that works there.
- Where?
Chinatown. Everybody.
To me, it was just bad luck.
Why?
You can't always tell what's going on.
Like with you.
Why was...
Why was it bad luck?
I was trying to keep someone from being hurt.
I ended up making sure that she was hurt.
Was there a woman involved?
Of course.
Dead?
Yes, hello?
Oh, my God.
No, look, don't do anything.
Don't do anything until I get there.
I have to go.
- Where?
- Just that I have to.
- I want to know where you're going.
- No, please. Don't be angry.
It has nothing to do with you or with any of all of this. It's just...
- Where are you going?
- Please...
Trust me this much.
I'll be back.
And there is...
There is something that I should tell you about.
The fishing club that old lady mentioned...
- The pieces of the flag... Yes.
- The Albacore Club.
- lt has to do with my father.
- I know.
He owns it... You know?
I saw him.
You saw my father?
- What... When?
- This morning.
You didn't tell me.
Well, there hasn't been much time.
What...
What did he say?
What did he say?
That you were jealous.
And that he was afraid what you might do.
Do? To whom?
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.
He wanted to know where she was.
I want you to listen to me.
Now, my father is a very dangerous man.
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.
Are you trying to tell me that he might be behind all this?
It's possible.
Even the death of your husband?
It's possible.
Now, please, don't ask me any more questions now, just wait. Wait for me here.
I need you here.
No, no. Here.
Give me the keys.
You...
It's either that or you drive yourself to the police.
The police?
Come on, Mrs. Mulwray.
You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there.
- She's not tied up.
- You know what I mean.
- You're holding her against her will.
- I am not!
- Okay. Then let's go talk to her.
- No!
She's...
She's too upset.
What about?
Hollis's death.
I tried to keep it from her.
I didn't want her to know until
I could make plans for us to leave.
You mean she just found out about it?
That's not what it looks like,
Mrs. Mulwray.
What does it look like?
Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
You're insane.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police.
I don't care what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I will if you don't.
She...
She...
She...
She's my sister.
Take it easy.
If she's your sister, she's your sister.
Why all the secrecy?
I can't.
Is it because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Is that it?
I would never have harmed Hollis.
He was the most gentle, decent man imaginable.
And he put up with more from me than you'll ever know.
I wanted him to be happy.
I borrowed your husband's car.
I'll bring it back in the morning.
But aren't you going...
Coming back with me?
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anybody about this.
That's not what I meant.
Yeah.
Well, I'm tired, Mrs. Mulwray.
Good night.
Gittes?
- Gittes?
- Yeah?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
- Who?
- Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.
- Yeah, I do?
- Sure, you do.
I tell you what, pal.
If lda wants to see me, she can call me at my office.
848- 1/2 East Kensington. Echo Park.
She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.
Find anything interesting, Gittes?
What are you doing around here?
Didn't you call me?
How come you happen to know her?
I don't.
Come here.
I want to show you something.
- lsn't that your phone number?
- ls it?
I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Well, just to make sure, we had Loach here give you a call.
What happened to your nose, Gittes?
Somebody slam a bedroom window on it?
Nope. Your wife got excited.
She crossed her legs a little too quick.
You understand what I mean, pal?
Loach.
They look familiar?
- Yeah. I took them. So what?
- How did she happen to have them?
Either you tell me or I guess.
I don't know the answer.
You must really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I don't think about it that much, but give me a day or two and I'll get back to you.
- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures, Gittes.
What pictures?
This broad hired you, not Evelyn Mulwray.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Somebody wanted to shake Mulwray down, she hired you.
That's how come you found out he was murdered.
- I heard it was an accident.
- Come on, Gittes.
Who the hell do you think you're dealing with, a bunch of assholes?
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
You were following him day and night.
You saw who killed him.
You even took pictures of it.
It was Evelyn Mulwray, and she's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since.
- You accusing me of extortion?
- Absolutely.
I don't think I need a day or two.
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.
Not only that, but I wouldn't extort a nickel from my worst enemy, Escobar.
That's where I draw the line.
I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.
We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.
What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean, then dragged him up to a reservoir because she thought it would look more like an accident?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
Why is that?
He found out they were dumping water there.
That's what they were trying to cover up.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on. I'll show you.
Come on, Lou. You're in charge.
Make a decision.
- It's too late.
- Too late for what?
They only dump the water at night.
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.
- Yeah, I know who he is. Go on!
- He says...
- I know what he says.
- Shut up.
Go on!
Yelburton says there's irrigation in the Valley, and there's always a little run-off after they do that.
And he says Gittes knows this, and he's been going around making irresponsible accusations all last week.
Lou, let's swear out a warrant for her arrest.
What the hell are we waiting for?
He just made lieutenant.
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.
Have your client in my office in two hours.
And remember,
I don't have to let you go.
I've got you right now for withholding evidence.
Loach?
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?
These her bags?
Is she going on a trip?
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
- ls she going on a vacation?
- Mrs. Mulwray no home.
"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have a look around, huh?
Yeah, yeah. Bad for the glass.
Oh, yes. Bad for glass.
Salt water very bad for glass.
Salt water?
Very, very bad. See?
What's that?
Right there.
There.
- You wait.
- You wait.
How are you? I've been calling you.
- Yeah?
- It's all right, Kahn.
- Have you slept?
- Sure.
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
She's having a bath right now.
Why do you want to see her?
Going someplace?
Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch.
Jake?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar.
But... Now look, what's the matter?
What's wrong?
- I told you, we have a 5:30...
- You're going to miss your train.
Lieutenant Escobar.
- Lou?
- Yeah.
Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.
Yeah. Soon as you can.
Why did you do that?
- You know any good criminal lawyers?
- No.
Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.
They're expensive, but you can afford it.
Will you please tell me what this is all about?
I found these in your backyard in the pond.
They belonged to your husband, didn't they?
Didn't they?
- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Yes, positively.
It's where he was drowned.
What?
There's no time to be shocked by the truth.
The coroner's report proves that he had salt water in his lungs when he was killed.
Just take my word for it, all right?
Now, I want to know how it happened, and I want to know why, and I want to know before Escobar gets here, because I don't want to lose my license.
I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest, most insane thing...
Stop it!
I'm gonna make it easy for you.
You were jealous. You had a fight.
He fell. He hit his head.
It was an accident!
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.
You don't have the guts to harm her, but you got the money to keep her mouth shut.
- Yes or no?
- No!
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about your sister, because you don't have a sister.
I'll tell you...
I'll tell you the truth.
Good. What's her name?
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?
She's my daughter.
I said I want the truth!
She's my sister.
She's my daughter.
My sister, my daughter!
I said I want the truth!
All of it!
She's my sister and my daughter!
Kahn, please, go back.
For God's sake, keep her upstairs.
Go back!
My father and l...
Understand?
Or is it too tough for you?
He raped you?
Then what happened?
I ran away.
T o Mexico.
Hollis came and took care of me.
I couldn't see her.
I was 15.
I wanted to, but l...
I couldn't.
Then...
Now I want to be with her.
I want to take care of her.
Where are you going to take her now?
Back to Mexico.
Well, you can't take the train. Escobar will be looking for you everywhere.
Well, how about a plane?
No, that's worse.
You better just get out of here.
Leave all this stuff here.
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.
All right.
Those didn't belong to Hollis.
How do you know?
He didn't wear bifocals.
Katherine, say hello to Mr. Gittes.
Hello.
Hello.
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?
Sure.
J. J. Gittes and Associates.
- Sophie, get me Walsh.
- Yes, Mr. Gittes.
- Jake?
- Yeah.
Listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes.
What? What the hell's the matter?
What...
Relax and I'll tell you.
Wait in the office for me about two hours.
If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?
I know where it is. Just do it.
1712 Alameda...
Come on in, Lou.
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.
I don't suppose you have any idea where she went.
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Where?
Her maid's house.
I think she knows something's up.
What's the maid's address?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down.
No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.
What for?
Because if she ain't there, you're going downtown, and you're gonna stay there until she does show up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Tell us about it on the way to San Pedro.
- Let's get the little lady.
- Lou, can I ask you a favor?
I'd like to bring her out myself.
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her.
And to me.
You never learn, do you, Jake?
I guess not.
Okay. But...
I'll give you three minutes.
Just three minutes.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Yes?
Hello.
Mr. Gittes! Come in!
Well, this is some surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?
No, thanks.
How about a glass of wine?
- Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...
- I know.
No, thank you, Curly, very much, but I would like a glass of water, though.
Come on out in the kitchen with me for a second, huh?
Sure thing.
- Curly, where's your car?
- ln the garage.
- Where's that?
- Off the alley.
- Can you give me a ride somewhere?
- Sure, soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
- I'll tell my wife.
- T ell her later, Curl, huh?
Just drive slow for a block or two, will you, Curly?
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.
How much do you owe me?
Gee, Mr. Gittes, we're going out tomorrow.
I know you been real good about it, but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Forget it.
How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada?
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.
I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks out of it for you.
Maybe even 100.
- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in, too.
1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown.
Wait for me until 8:30.
If I don't show up, take them to your boat.
You sure this is okay?
Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?
Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?
An hour.
Oh, there you are.
Well, you don't look too much the worse for wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.
- Where's the girl?
- I've got her.
- ls she all right?
- She's fine.
Well, where is she?
With her mother.
I got something
I'd like to show you, Mr. Cross.
What is it?
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?
I guess I can manage.
What does it mean?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Right here, in that pond.
You drowned him.
And you left these.
The coroner's report shows Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Hollis was always fascinated by tide pools.
You know what he used to say?
I haven't the faintest idea.
"That's where life begins."
Sloughs, tide pools.
When we first come out here, he figured if you dumped water into desert sand and let it percolate down to the bedrock, it would stay there instead of evaporate the way it does in most reservoirs.
You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley.
It's what I am doing.
When the bond issue passes Tuesday, there'll be $8 million to build an aqueduct and a reservoir.
I'm doing it.
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens when they find out that they're paying for water that they're not gonna get.
Oh, that's all taken care of.
See, Mr. Gitts, either you bring the water to L. A., or you bring L. A. to the water.
How are you gonna do that?
By incorporating the Valley into the city.
Simple as that.
- How much are you worth?
- I have no idea.
How much do you want?
No, I just want to know what you're worth. Over $10 million?
- Oh my, yes.
- Why are you doing it?
How much better can you eat?
What can you buy that you can't already afford?
The future, Mr. Gitts!
The future!
Now, where's the girl?
I want the only daughter I've got left.
As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
I don't blame myself.
See, Mr. Gitts, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of anything.
Claude, take those glasses from him, will you?
It's not worth it, Mr. Gitts.
It's really not worth it.
Where's the girl?
You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys?
Mr. Cross, these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...
You're under arrest, Jake.
Good news.
Withholding evidence, extortion, accessory after the fact.
I didn't extort nothing from nobody, Lou.
This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.
He's the bird you're after, Lou.
I can explain everything.
- Lieutenant?
- Just give me five minutes.
That's all I need.
- He's rich! Do you understand?
- Shut up!
He thinks he can get away with anything!
Shut up or I'm gonna lock you in to the wheel of that car.
Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.
- Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.
- He's crazy, Lou!
He killed Mulwray because of the water thing!
- I'm telling...
- Water?
Would you just listen to me for five minutes?
Loach, lock him to the wheel of that car.
Lou, you don't know what's going on here. I'm telling you.
Katherine!
Katherine.
- I am your grandfather, my dear.
- Come, miss.
- I'm your grandfather.
- Come, miss.
Katherine, get in the car.
- Go on, go on.
- But, ma'am...
No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.
I'll follow. It's all right.
Get away from her. Get away!
Evelyn. Please, please, be reasonable.
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!
Evelyn!
How many years have I got?
She's mine, too.
She's never going to know that!
Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.
You cannot hope to provide.
Evelyn, put that gun away!
Let the police handle this!
He owns the police!
Get away from her.
- You'll have to kill me first.
- Get away! Get...
Katherine, close the door.
Halt!
Oh, no!
Better call the captain.
Get an ambulance.
- No!
- Turn him loose. Turn them all loose.
- Lord.
- No!
Lord.
Lord.
No! No!
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.
- As little as possible.
- What's that?
What's that?
You want to do your partner a big favor?
T ake him home.
T ake him home!
Just get him the hell out of here!
Come on, Jake.
Go home, Jake.
I'm doing you a favor.
Come on, Jake.
Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.
All right, come on. Clear the area!
On the sidewalk!
On the sidewalk!
Get off the street!
Get off the street!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I would like to propose a toast... to Michael and Elizabeth Courtland... this world's last romantics.
Happy tenth anniversary!
Happy anniversary!
And if you'll allow me, a special toast to this man... a man of endless energy and ambition... the cream of the new South... my dear friend and new senior partner... in what will soon be the finest real estate development in New Orleans... the new Pontchartrain Estates!
Thank you, Bob.
Bob has very generously referred to me... as part of the cream of the new South.
I think that might be a little bit genteel for me.
I would be more inclined to consider myself more of... oh, skim milk of the Middle West or something.
Energy... ambition.
I would hope... that we could direct those qualities... to try and retain... for the new South... some of the graceful values of the old South.
- Daddy.
- What?
- Will you dance with me?
- Will I dance with you?
What will you do if I dance with you?
I'll dance with you.
Let's bring Mommy in, okay?
- Good night.
- Good night, John.
Bob, thanks again.
Thank you, Bob.
Good night, Debbie.
Good night.
Thank you.
It was nice having you.
Good night, Carl.
Mommy! Mommy!
Honey?
Turn it on.
Come on, kid. Talk, damn it!
Tell your daddy how much you want him to bring that money!
Daddy, please bring the money, please!
- That's real good.
- Please come get me and Mommy, please!
That's good. That's real good.
Yes?
I'm supposed to bring this to Mr. Courtland.
Come in.
- What is it, son?
- Mr. Courtland?
The man said you'd give me a tip.
Five dollars! Gee, thanks.
- What did he look like?
- Who?
The man who gave you the bag.
Just a man.
Let's start at the beginning.
Slow down.
Come on, kid! Talk, damn it!
Tell your daddy how much you want him to bring that money!
Daddy, please bring the money, please!
Please come get me and Mommy, please!
Call the police.
I guess I'll have to take my money out of the Pontchartrain project.
I know, Court.
Just thinkin' about it makes me sick.
You know, I'm not gonna take advantage of this.
We're gonna develop the land just as you planned.
We'll build your park.
Hell, I like trees.
If you pick up the option, you're not obligated to do my plan.
You can do anything you want with it.
You know that.
I want to do this thing for you.
Thanks, Bob. I appreciate that.
Of course, there's still a week on the option.
If the police can get your money back, it'll be just like before.
Well, I guess somebody oughta get to the bank.
I'll go there myself.
Inspector Brie is here.
He'd like to see you right now.
- Would you send him in?
- Okay.
Hello, Inspector.
Thank you for coming out. Sit down.
Thank you.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
No, thank you, Mr. Courtland.
It's an excruciating situation.
I guess I don't have to tell you that.
Preparing for the worst and hoping for the best.
I've seen many cases very similar to this.
They all ended up with the successful return of the hostages... and the apprehension of the kidnappers.
It's just a matter of intelligence and calm nerves.
Just try to leave this as much as possible to us, Mr. Courtland.
There's nothing you can really do.
I'm willing to pay the money.
The money isn't important.
That's the hell of it, Mr. Courtland.
These men are professionals.
If they're caught without the loot, they give up.
If they got the money in hand, we may have a very dangerous fight.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
It is, of course, finally your decision.
What would you do?
Something the lab has developed.
Something the lab has developed.
We go through the drop as instructed.
False money and a small radio transmitter... in a locked briefcase.
We track the pickup man by radio truck.
He leads us to the hostages.
Foolproof.
At no point will the lives of your wife and daughter be in danger.
Just leave it to us.
Give me an estimation.
I got it, I got it!
You oughta be happy, little girl.
Your daddy come through with the money.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Mommy, Mommy!
Daddy brought the money!
What the hell is that?
Transmitter.
Son of a bitch!
Look at this. This is what your old man thinks you're worth!
- Nothin'!
- Mommy!
This is Detective Brie.
This is Detective Brie of the New Orleans police force.
The house is surrounded.
Come out with your hands raised and you will not be harmed.
- What do we do?
- Be calm. Get the knife.
Don't panic.
Cut those ropes and let's get outta here.
Break that window open.
Mommy! Mommy!
Don't shoot unless you want the kid to get it!
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.
Peterson, this is Brie.
We're on the Broussard Road approaching the bridge.
Are your roadblocks in place?
All set on your side, Inspector.
I'm helping an oil truck off the road over here.
Get it out of there!
We're on the bridge now!
The wife and daughter of New Orleans businessman Michael Courtland... were killed yesterday... when a kidnap-rescue effort sadly backfired.
Over here is Inspector August Brie, who's in charge of this case.
Inspector, can you tell us exactly what happened here?
I'm sorry.
I can't divulge any information at this time.
It's just been too tragic, that's all.
The police did all they could.
The search for the bodies remains fruitless... hampered by the explosion of the automobile... and the currents of the Mississippi.
Here are your tickets.
Now, remember, you leave at 12:30 tomorrow.
You arrive in Rome at 9:10 and you take the Rapido to Florence.
- Do you have your passport?
- Yeah.
I'll put these in your briefcase.
You about ready, Michael?
I won't be a second.
What's that Italian's name,
D'Annunzio?
He's a bit of a bore,
I'm afraid.
A rich one, though.
I hope his English is better than my Italian.
You let me take care of him.
He's very susceptible to flattery.
He's gonna love it when I tell him he's as wise as Caesar... and as honest as the pope.
You know, I'm gonna like this trip, Bob.
Really, I'm lookin' forward to it.
I can find out what you were doing on the Florentine junkets all these years.
Food, money... and above all art, my man.
I'm a lover of fine art.
- It's my only vice.
- You're just a Renaissance man, Robert.
He said 8:00.
Oh, thanks, Bob.
You know, I think you're right.
I should have come back to Italy years ago.
I told you, old boy.
It's the birthplace of western art.
One thing that puzzles me.
How do these old guys get such young wives?
- I'll ask them.
- Don't.
I think so too. Would you like to see a picture of my wife?
Picture of your wife?
Go ahead, show him a picture.
As Americans say, "Such a jewel."
Wonderful woman.
And cook... such a cook.
She's lovely.
This is Maria.
Such a wonderful woman.
- And I have six children.
- She's lovely.
Lovely lady.
Aren't you glad you asked?
A fantastico woman.
That's why I have to make so much money.
She loves money, and she deserves it.
- Everybody likes money.
- And women.
Oh, not everybody likes money, signor.
You take my partner here,
Michael.
He and I own, in New Orleans... one of the biggest, best plots of land in the suburban city.
For 15, 16 years... he has refused to build anything on that land.
Nothing but a tomb.
If you gentlemen will excuse me, it's a little late.
Late? He thinks it's late.
Hell, I haven't even danced yet.
You should have stayed with us last night, Court.
We aren't getting any younger.
Found that out, did you?
You're not upset about last night, are you?
So what are we gonna do today?
I don't know. I thought we might just do a little sightseeing... absorb a little culture and a little less wine.
That sounds great.
Isn't this the church where you and Elizabeth met?
I'll be right back.
Well, how was it, Court?
The same.
Well, you about ready to go back to the old U.S. Of A., Court?
I thought I'd like to stay around a few more days.
Oh?
I'd like to go back to that church again.
Why do you wanna do that?
Will you come with me?
Well, okay, if it'd make you feel better.
Oh, my God.
- You sure you're gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
- I just need a few days.
- All right.
You take real good care of yourself now.
Thanks, Bob.
Oh, that's all right.
I speak English.
You are American?
You like the Madonna?
It was painted in 1328... by Bernardo Daddi.
That's early Renaissance.
- You a student?
- No.
I used to be... what do you call it?
Bilingual secretary.
Then one day I read about the restoration project... and I said, "Sandra, the Madonna needs you."
So I quit my dull job, and here I am... an art historian.
I can't think of anything more important.
Well, at least they don't holler and scream at you... when you talk to strange men.
What do you do?
I'm in land development, real estate.
Ah. Well, that sounds important.
It's not.
My name is Courtland.
Michael Courtland.
Happy to meet you.
I'm Sandra.
Sandra Portinari.
You've been doing this work a long time?
Oh, I'm not doing the restoration.
I'm just a workman.
But I prepare everything for the specialist.
You see, several years ago... long after the floods... moisture seeped into a portion of the altarpiece... and it began to peel... revealing an older painting underneath.
Then the art scholars had to decide what to do.
Should they remove and destroy a great painting by Daddi... to uncover what appears to be a crude first draft underneath it?
Or should they restore the original... but never know for sure what lies beneath it?
What would you do?
Hold on to it.
Beauty should be protected.
Good. That is what the scholars decided to do.
Now you have a free lecture, and you don't have to read the brochure.
I wondered if I might... repay you for your lecture... and ask you to dinner somewhere.
You don't understand.
Dinner can be a pretty serious affair here.
Lunch. I know a place nearby.
Signor, I thought it was the Italian men who picked up the American women.
All right. Lunch.
But I have to work another hour and a half before I go.
I'll wait.
So you were in Florence before?
A long time ago.
I was stationed near here after the war.
I wasn't even born, but my mother often told me... how hard times were then.
You live with your mother?
Not anymore. I have an apartment near Ponte Vecchio.
But I was raised by my mother.
My father deserted us a long time ago.
That's sad.
What was Florence like during the Occupation?
Confused.
I'm really not an expert on the Occupation.
My mind is elsewhere.
I met my wife there.
Oh, the plot thickens.
Let us sit and tell sad tales... about deserted daughters and lonely husbands.
I thought you had a familiar melancholy look... when you came into the church.
That wasn't...
She died a long time ago.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
It's just that a single girl... meets a lot of men, mostly Americans... who want to tell her about their wives.
It's not very flattering.
What was she like?
Elizabeth...
She was very much like you.
Like me?
She was Italian?
No, she looked very much like you.
Do you have a picture of her?
I really have to go now.
May I see you again sometime?
Sure.
We could have a nonserious dinner.
- Seriously.
- When?
- Tonight.
- Tonight?
Is that all right?
That's only five hours from now.
Plenty of time to change.
All right, but I have to go see my mother at the hospital after work.
I'll meet you there.
Oh, it's the San Giovanni.
I know.
All right.
See you. Ciao.
Ciao.
You're very fond of that restaurant, aren't you?
Yeah.
That's where you met Elizabeth.
No, we met in the church where you're working.
We used to eat in the restaurant though.
Tell me about her.
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.
Well, as I said before, she's very much like you.
I mean, she looked very much like you.
She had brown hair... and wore it longer, kind of different, you know.
And she wore pink lipstick.
And she never wore rouge.
Oh, her walk...
Her walk was 180 degrees different than yours.
- Different?
- Yeah.
- She had a very Bryn Mawr walk.
- Bryn Mawr?
Yeah, very Bryn Mawr.
What do you mean, "Bryn Mawr"?
Bryn Mawr?
That's kind of a walk.
It's... Well, it's...
It's... I don't...
Just walk, and I'll...
Just go ahead and walk upstairs.
No, that's an Italian walk.
What do you expect?
It's a good walk, but it's just not a Bryn Mawr walk.
A Bryn Mawr walk is a kind of a glide, you know?
Those girls used to wear long polo coats in those old days, long raincoats.
They kind of glide, like they're late for class.
They move fast and just kinda glide.
This time now, just glide.
I'll talk you through it, okay?
- All right.
- Don't sashay so much. Just glide.
- All right.
- Go ahead.
Just glide.
No, not like a model.
Just glide.
That's it. That's it.
She called me Mike.
Mike?
Listen, I am a good Catholic girl.
I obey everything the pope says.
You know?
What would the pope say if I saw you tomorrow?
You forget I have a job to do.
Tomorrow night.
Let's wait a couple of days, all right?
Saturday.
I'm free all day Saturday.
- What time?
- Oh, 11:00?
I'll be here.
All right.
Good night.
Move to your right.
All right, come closer now.
Come closer.
A little closer.
What is that, a love sonnet from an Italian boyfriend?
No, it isn't. Jealous.
That's Dante.
"While life endures... you should not ever be inconstant to your lady... who in death doth lie.
So speaks my heart and afterwards doth sigh."
You know, as a child...
I used to go to the church... where Dante came to watch Beatrice.
Beatrice, la bella donna, would sit here... with her father... and there...
Come here.
- Over there.
- I'm her father.
The young Dante, 23 years old... would stand and watch Beatrice.
And here... in between... sat the Lady of the Screen... a lady Dante pretended to love... so that Beatrice would not be embarrassed... by his continual gaze.
You still love Elizabeth, don't you?
That's why you want me.
How did she die?
I killed her.
I'm sorry, but I must go to the hospital right away.
- My mother's very ill.
- I'll go with you.
- It's not your problem. I go alone.
- Please.
All right.
Well, let's hurry then.
Mama.
Come closer.
I can't see you.
You love my Sandra?
Oh, Mama.
I must know now.
Good.
You love him?
I don't know.
He marry you.
You'll have to forgive my mother.
She's always been a matchmaker.
You rich?
You gangster?
You marry him.
Mama, we hardly know each other.
You get to know him... after you're married.
No matter how many times I read it, it still says the same thing.
Look at that.
"Hold St. Louis Cathedral for May 2.
Break out the champagne.
I'm returning Tuesday the 19th for a church weddin'.
Love, Michael."
Poor Court.
He's a goner now.
I tell you, Jane.
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't have believed it.
It was like Elizabeth had stepped out of her tomb.
Yeah, well, you'll see soon enough for yourself.
- Do you think she's a gold digger?
- I don't know what to think.
Maybe we should call Dr. Ellman.
- What good would he do?
- He's been treating Court for years.
But Ellman lives in 1975.
Michael lives in 1959.
- Mr. Michael!
- Judy.
Good to see you too.
I want you to meet Sandra.
Sandra, this is Judy, a lifelong member of this house.
Hello, Miss Sandra.
Mr. Michael wrote me about you.
- Let me help you with this.
- Thank you.
It's beautiful here.
Now, this D'Annunzio-Florence deal is lookin' awful good, Court.
Looks like the old goat is finally gonna invest some big money with us.
Now, I've got a preliminary breakdown here... of the basic estimated development cost and cash flow... for the joint venture proposal.
I'd like you to look those over if you would.
You wouldn't file an in personam suit against me... if I asked you to table all this for a while, would ya?
I mean, with the wedding plans and everything, I'm just not up to it.
- Would you mind, for a while?
- Can do, Court.
Can do. That's what a partner's for, I guess.
Well, our friends are certainly looking forward to meetin' Sandra.
They'll all meet her on the big day.
Big day of the big wedding.
Big day of my new life.
How do you say in Italian?
"La vita nuova."
Look, Court...
I know this is none of my business... but don't you think maybe this is all a little hasty?
A little premature?
You're right.
It's none of your business.
Yes, Miss Sandra?
There's a locked room upstairs.
What is it?
It was the master bedroom.
Why is it locked?
I don't know, Miss Sandra.
I don't clean it anymore.
I want to see it.
Can you open it for me?
I don't have the key.
Mr. Michael keeps it.
Where?
Well, I guess it's all right.
He keeps it in his desk.
"February 14, 1952.
I think the days in Florence... will be the happiest
I will ever have.
New Orleans is a nice town... and Mike is very good to me... but it is all so different now.
He is busy at work all day... and sometimes I wonder if Mike loves me as much as his business."
There it is, darling.
Isn't it beautiful?
And on the 19th... it'll be all ours.
It's so big.
And Mike, 200 guests.
That's a lot of people.
Just a small ceremony would be fine.
No, it's more than a ceremony.
It's a celebration... and there should be thousands... and everything's got to be... very special.
Yes. If you say so.
Good morning, Robert.
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good morning, Jane, Shirley.
What are you doing here, Doc?
This was the only way I had to get in touch with you.
You're a hard man to get a hold of.
What can I do for you?
I thought we might just sit down for a while and have a personal talk.
Purely a social visit.
Why is it psychiatrists are such lousy liars?
Would you come in here, please?
Did you all ask Dr. Ellman up here?
He called to find out how you were.
We thought you might wanna be talkin' to somebody.
That's fine. Thank you.
Michael, why don't you talk to Charlie?
- That's fine.
- It's for your own good.
I went by and saw Sandra yesterday.
I didn't think you'd mind.
You didn't think I'd mind?
You invade my privacy and you ask if I'd mind?
Will you listen to yourself?
Stop and listen to what you're saying.
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- I know exactly what I'm doing.
I don't want anybody interfering with my private life.
You're talking with somebody who already knows you... knows you better probably than anybody else.
Sandra and I talked about a lot of things yesterday.
I don't think you're being fair with her.
You shouldn't marry out of a sense of guilt... or out of some morbid preoccupation with Elizabeth.
And now Sandra is obsessed with the idea of Elizabeth.
That's all she wanted to know about yesterday.
She's caught up in your fantasy.
You must know what's happening.
Give yourself some time.
Let your relationship with Sandra grow first.
And I want you back in therapy.
If not with me, with some other doctor.
But give yourself some time.
Right.
Except you got it wrong.
We'll talk about it... after lunch.
Good.
We'll work everything out.
Just come on down to my office and...
I just don't want you to do anything impulsively that you'll regret.
Bye-bye.
What's happening?
- Why are you home?
- Because you're here.
Because my heart's here.
Because I never want to leave.
Where are you?
We've been so worried.
Look, we're both really sorry about that.
We didn't mean it.
We only thought you...
Okay, he's here.
Just a minute.
It's Michael.
Michael, old boy, where are ya?
Well, now, don't you think it's...
Now, don't be hasty.
Okay, if that's what you want.
He wants us to put his share of the company into a trust fund.
- He's already sent the papers.
- Where is he?
Who knows?
- Tomorrow.
- What?
Let's get married tomorrow.
We can have the justice of the peace perform the ceremony right here.
- Why tomorrow?
- I don't wanna wait.
What about St. Louis Cathedral and all your friends?
We can have it cancelled.
Besides, I don't have any friends.
I found that out today.
Would you be disappointed?
Well, no, not at all.
And now, in accordance with the powers invested in me... by the state of Louisiana...
I now pronounce you man and wife.
I've waited so long.
Now...
I am your wife.
I am Elizabeth.
I came back for one reason, Mike.
I came... to give you a second chance to prove your love.
I've always loved you.
Never leave me alone.
I want to be with you always.
Always.
I am happy now.
Now I am your wife.
I am Elizabeth.
I came to give you a second chance.
I'm sorry to call you so early.
Something's come up.
You've gotta go to the bank with me now.
We've gotta get $500,000.
- Don't ask me...
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you part in the car.
- What's this money gonna be used for?
What's your collateral? Am I loaning, investing or just giving it to you?
It's a second chance for me.
You don't understand, but...
- You wanna come inside?
- No, I don't!
- You're under incredible strain.
- I know I am!
- You should talk to Dr. Ellman.
- The hell with Dr. Ellman! Please hurry.
- Why do you want to go to the bank?
- I wanna get $500,000.
- You don't have that kind of cash.
- I've got some money.
- Have you seen our books lately?
- We've got land.
We've got the Pontchartrain property.
We've got other property.
- And you wanna give me half?
- I'll give you anything!
It's only for a short while.
Please come.
If that's what you want, I'll do it.
We'll get the papers, and you sign.
- You can act crazy, I don't have to.
- Anything!
I'll take that land to protect it from you. I gotta look after the company.
- All right! I'll wait in the car.
- I'll just get dressed.
You're gonna have to sign these papers.
Right there.
Old Court.
Just can't come up with the money... not for Elizabeth and not for you.
Mommy.
Look at this. This is what your old man thinks you're worth.
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Mommy! Mommy!
Cut those ropes and let's leave.
Break that window open!
Don't shoot unless you want the kid to get it!
It looks like your daddy doesn't think you're worth a dime.
I'm sure your Uncle Bob will.
I don't want this.
I don't want any part of it.
I don't want this.
I don't want any part of it.
$50,000 is a lot of money to turn down, darling.
- You keep it. You earned it.
- It wasn't supposed to be like this.
It was a dirty business from the start and you knew it.
I told you Court would either give up the land... or be declared mentally incompetent to manage it.
And you agreed. So don't start getting an attack of conscience now.
At least you kept him out of bed.
Look at it that way.
Do you realize what I've done?
I wanna go back to him.
I wanna confess everything.
I wanna beg him to forgive me.
Look. You hold on.
Just keep your head a minute.
We just swindled a man out of millions.
Now, the law isn't exactly gonna look lightly on that... if you go back to Michael and confess.
You made a dirty deal with me and you executed it flawlessly.
You're the best investment
I ever made.
Old Court fell for your Elizabeth act hook, line and sinker.
So now I think you're entitled to the due wages of sin.
You don't understand!
What am I gonna do now?
It's a little late for existential questions, darling.
You just take the money. Believe you me, it'll help you to forget.
What am I gonna do?
- I can't take it.
- Come on!
Look! Move!
Hurry up!
Have you got the money?
- This isn't enough.
- It's all for you.
What about the others?
- They're all dead.
- Christ!
Smart business deal this turned out to be.
Courtland surprised all of us!
So just take the money and get out of here!
Uncle Bob.
Where's Mommy?
She's dead, honey.
Your daddy didn't pay the men... and they killed her.
You see. I gave the man the money.
I'm taking care of you now.
Now, you're gonna go with him... on the plane to a faraway place where
I've got friends you can live with.
Now, I'll be there in about a week to see if everything's okay.
But where's Daddy?
He don't want you anymore, honey.
Now you go with the man.
- Go on!
- No!
- Go with him!
- Uncle Bob, no!
Go with the man!
Uncle Bob!
Father, I do not ask forgiveness.
I know there can be none.
I was never killed with Mother.
I was ransomed by La Salle and brought to Florence... where I lived with Mrs. Portinari.
I was raised believing you killed Mother.
I hated you. I lived for the day when I could revenge her.
Then La Salle came to me with his plan to swindle the land from you... and I got my chance.
But you were not like he said.
I never thought I would...
Iove you.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are sorry to disturb you at this time... but we have just encountered some unexpected turbulence.
Would you please return to your seats immediately and...
Excuse me.
It wasn't there.
The money wasn't there.
It wasn't there.
You got me out of bed... forced me to give you $500,000.
You were actin' crazy.
Of course the money wasn't there.
I had to protect it from you.
I have the real money.
I was only lookin' after your own good.
It's all yours now.
And this will surely keep you from throwin' it away.
I killed her.
She came back a second time... to let me prove I loved her... and I killed her.
Now she's gone.
You just can't seem to keep a woman, can you?
You self-righteous son of a bitch!
What did you think you were anyway?
Steppin' on anybody you wanted to... tellin' people what to do and when to do it.
Sittin' on your ass... while a fortune slipped through our fingers!
Do you know how rich we could have been?
But you don't care about money, do ya?
You never did.
You just threw away millions this mornin' for that lyin' little bitch.
Go ahead and kill me!
You gonna kill her too?
She was in it with me, you fool!
She was in it from the start.
She's goin' to Rome... with $50,000 of yours.
You didn't just throw away a fortune.
You just threw away your whole life.
TWA flight 702 to London... scheduled for departure at 10:30.
Passengers now boarding at gate 16.
When's the next flight to Rome?
Rome... Tomorrow evening, 8:00 p.m.
You wanna make a reservation?
Would that be first class or coach, sir?
First class.
Excuse me a minute.
All right.
Sir, you are in luck.
Our 8:00 flight from Rome has just returned... to check out an engine malfunction.
Now, the problem appears to be cleared up... and the flight is rescheduled to take off at 11:00 p.m. From gate 36.
If you want me to fix this for you...
Daddy!
You came with the money!
Daddy!
Amy?
Daddy.
Hello?
You weren't at work today, were you, Elizabeth?
Waiting for my call?
Look, you've won
I'm leaving
Don't go
Come to the window
All those windows out there,
I'm behind one of them
What do you want?
I've had it I'm getting out
Don't leave me, Elizabeth
Where are you going?
Somewhere you'll never find me
I'll find you I don't give up
Sweet dreams, Elizabeth
How many?
Two thousand tenants.
Fascinating.
In addition, we can handle up to 5,000 visitors a day.
That's a lot of people to have over for drinks.
You have 80 miles of wiring, piping, cables...
- In this apartment?
- No, over the whole building.
That's a relief.
There's a restaurant in the foyer which serves what we consider the finest seafood.
We also have a gift shop and a wedding chapel.
- Mother will like that.
- Oh, Mother wants you married, huh?
Mother wants herself married.
It's looking pretty good now that she's got this aluminum siding salesman from Toronto.
I think they're going to move here.
She wants to be close to me.
Maybe we can show her one of our two-bedroom apartments.
Well, I'm afraid not.
I was lying.
No aluminum siding salesman. No mother.
I've developed this strange sense of humor and it sometimes gets me into trouble.
- Trouble?
- You don't have to worry.
I'm actually just a normal person.
I work hard, I take showers,
I turn the radio down after 10:00.
I won't tell jokes to the neighbors.
The building is equipped for change.
For instance, if you're in a westerly room and you're exposed to the setting sun, our computers increase the flow of air-conditioned air.
So your temperature is always perfect.
There's no comparable building anywhere.
How about that one?
Oh, you know, that building doesn't look as tall.
Probably doesn't even have one computer.
Honestly, I love it.
It'll be like living in the top drawer of a glass box.
I'll take it.
Hello, little Cyclops.
Welcome to your new home.
Don't forget, you're supposed to take the curse off the Ionely nights.
Lonely nights and Ionely days coming your way.
Cut it out, Michaels.
Hello, L.A.
This could be the start of a meaningful relationship.
Mr. Frimkin? Hello, I'm Leigh Michaels.
Fine, thank you. And you?
Yes. I worked at WXN, New York, for five years.
Uh-huh. I was born in Carthage, New York.
I'm 29 and I'm single.
I hope that's not going to be a problem,
Mr. Frimkin.
Being single, I mean.
Yes, I did. NYU.
Yes, that's right. They have an excellent school of journalism.
Uh-huh. Now, I've heard that Potsdam had a very good school also.
What year was that?
Ought-six?
Uh-huh.
Well, that would make you in your late 80s, isn't that correct?
Because that means you won't be hitting on me, will you?
You will?
Stranger in town.
Pardon me?
Oh, of course, I have lots of ideas for new programming.
For instance, instead of the same old movie reviews, how about a Chicano who only reviews Westerns?
We could call it "Rio Taco" or "Bite the Burrito."
- Of course I can start right away...
- But what? Get me that copy fast.
I don't know your cameraman, your board, your format.
Two cameras, one kitchen set and a cook.
Whatever happened to on-the-job training?
We're a small station in a big market.
This is it.
- Your new home.
- Now wait...
I can't, you can't.
- Where am I?
- Just forget everything?
I haven't unpacked, I almost greased three boy scouts and a pimp on the way over here,
I haven't shown anyone my résumé,
I could be a janitor.
- What am I looking at?
- Your SA, your PL button.
I don't believe this is happening.
I have 45 minutes till my next interview.
- Leigh Michaels.
- Sophie.
- You got 15 seconds.
- No!
You're right, 12 seconds.
We've got a four-second station I.D., fade in to camera one, you're on your own.
Camera one, ready to fade up.
Slice each kidney into four,
and we cut up the bacon into one-inch squares
Zoom in, one.
Quarter the onions and part the pieces
Now, they take 5 or 10 minutes and if you want
Zoom in, camera one.
Okay, tighter on the food.
Now we serve with the plain rice and a green salad
Ready, two, for close-ups?
Fifteen seconds to go.
Take two.
Video, check your levels on camera two.
Camera one, swing in for end title card.
Get ready to dissolve.
Serves four people
Dissolve.
Five, four, three, two, one.
We're out.
We got a winner here.
I can feel all the new sets tuning in.
Tomorrow you do the Flaming Chef and the 3:00 News Update.
Be in my office at 4:00 this afternoon.
Does this mean I get the job? Mr. Frimkin?
Frimsin. A man of few words.
I guess you got a new director.
This is it.
No windows, no pictures, and an air-conditioner that won't stop.
Yeah, well, maybe it'll keep me from falling asleep.
- You got a place to live yet?
- Yeah, Arkham Tower.
Fancy.
The only way I could afford it is with the nice, fat bonus they gave me at my last job.
If they were so nice to you, how come you left?
- Who was he?
- Obvious, huh?
Familiar. I've seen the same look in my mirror.
Who was he?
She.
Hmm.
- Don't worry, you're not my type.
- I'm not worried.
- Yes?
Is Miss Michaels there?
Yes, she is. Just a minute.
- It's for you.
- Who knows I'm here?
- They're paging you.
- One?
Mmm-hmm.
- Hello?
Michaels?
Yes, it is.
Hello, is this Leigh Michaels?
Yes. Yes, it is.
I thought so
That's weird.
Our modern, efficient switchboard probably cut you off.
I tell you, sometimes I don't know about this place.
Hello, ladies.
What we don't have in charm, we make up for in Steve.
I want to thank you for helping out in there.
I was really winging it, and I appreciate it.
- I can be helpful in other ways.
- Not really.
I'm afraid so.
How about it, a little after-hour orientation?
No, thank you. Thanks, but, no thanks.
Shouldn't make a big mistake like this on your first day.
No, thank you.
- How about dinner tonight?
- No, thanks.
Struck out.
Okay, but...
I won't give up.
Hound dog.
That's just the beginning.
He's like a Mountie.
Well, this time he's not going to get his whatever.
I gotta go.
I have 45 minutes to put in an appearance at my next interview, and I better go by my apartment.
You know, I think this is gonna work out.
It won't be like New York.
Yeah, that's what I mean.
Hello?
Oh, Mr. Burglar, are you here?
I think it only fair to warn you that I studied with Bruce Lee before he died.
I have a black belt to prove it.
I'll loop it around your neck on the way out.
Let's see, 555-2131, good solid number.
Yes, Mr. Leone, please.
Hello, Mr. Leone,
Leigh Michaels from 4320.
Yes, I just found it. Uh-huh.
When did they put it in?
Well, because they didn't shut my door on the way out.
Oh, you were here and you locked it yourself?
Awfully early to be drinking, isn't it...
No, no, no. You remember me, big joker?
Just a minute, Mr. Leone.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
No, no, everything's fine.
You just seem to have ghosts in the building.
There is no new evidence on Elizabeth Solley,
25 years old, single, a night duty nurse at the Baxter Clinic,
who jumped through a window in her 6th Street apartment,
and plunged nine stories to her death in an apparent suicide
Police confirmed this morning that Miss Solley
had been taking large dozes of sedatives and was frequently absent from
- Hello?
- Hello, Leigh
- Hello, Steve.
- You moved in?
- Yes, I'm getting settled.
- You need any help?
- No, I don't need any help.
- I'm just asking, that's all
- Thank you, but no thanks.
- Come on, Leigh
Hey, listen a minute.
You know what no means, right?
- No, it's okay. Just no.
- Why not?
Steve, no!
Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, all right.
- Hello?
- I got a great idea
- How about dinner tomorrow night?
- No, Steve.
At the tone, the time will be
8:42 exactly.
No date, but at least you know what time it is.
Can't take it, huh? Too bad.
Hello?
The least you can do is some heavy breathing, Stevie
- Good evening, Miss Michaels.
- Hello, Eddie.
That's real class.
A doorman who says good evening.
I come home, I open the door, and the cat throws up on the floor.
Big news.
KXA in Fort Worth offered me a job.
Assistant to the executive in charge of programming.
You can't leave. I'd fall apart.
TV sets all over the city would explode.
- You're right.
- Oozing green slime.
Are you going to take that job in Fort Worth?
It's a definite possibility.
I have friends there.
- Great.
- Nice.
- Very nice.
- Thank you.
Where's the... Never mind, I see it.
It's sickening.
You have a view from every room.
- A letter from New York?
- Listen to this.
"Congratulations. You have won a free six-month vacation to Europe."
Fantastic.
"Once a year, Excursions Unlimited, chooses a recipient
"of their all-expense paid travel incentive vacation,
"designed to promote
Excursions Unlimited.
- "To qualify for your six-month vacation..."
- Oh, here it comes.
"To qualify for your six-month vacation you must identify your destination
"from the vacation presents
"that will be sent to you over the following months.
"Various presents designed for your use and enjoyment
"at a specific European location will arrive under separate cover
"If you correctly identify your vacation destination,
"the all-expense paid trip is yours.
"Yours truly, D.G. Hill."
- It's got to be a pitch.
- Yeah, but for what?
If you tell them where they're going to send you, they send you there.
- It can't be real.
- It looks real.
Just some strange garbage.
And speaking of strange garbage, let's eat.
- Well, hi, pretty lady. Buy you a drink?
- No, thank you.
Okay. Later.
Much later.
Hello.
I'm Leigh Michaels.
Paul Winkless.
Well, it's very nice to know you, Paul.
Hey, there.
Haven't we met before?
Can I buy you a drink?
We'll flip for it.
You're very lucky because I used to have this quarter that had tails on both sides.
- Heads or tails?
- Heads.
Hmm.
White wine, please.
Could I see the quarter?
Uh-uh.
Miss? White wine, please.
Just testing.
Uh-huh. What are you testing?
- I have strange fears.
- Really? What?
Being raped by dwarfs.
You could have been sitting up there on stilts. I had to check.
I understand.
- You know, you're really a little...
- Yeah?
I would say,
- fashion designer.
- You would?
Well, you would have another guess.
Okay, I don't know, cheerleader.
- Close. Proctologist.
- Wonderful.
Would you like to tell me?
I direct live TV.
Seriously?
That's my problem, all right.
Whenever I get around to finally telling the truth,
- no one believes me.
- I believe you.
Uh-huh.
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to go to my mother for problems, you know, boys, grades, stuff.
And she'd say,
"Now, Leigh, there you go being whacky again."
Whacky?
I was the only kid I know with whacky appendicitis.
What?
Well, I've known you about two hours, and I'm already telling you about my appendectomy and my mother.
Yeah, well, that's my job.
Getting to the truth, the absolute truth.
You're working for my mother?
No, actually I work for the Philosophy Department, USC.
- A philosopher?
- That's right.
- An endangered species.
- Yeah.
So how do you do it?
How do you get to the absolute truth, Professor?
I try to be as direct as possible, as in, will you come home with me? Tonight?
Not tonight.
Well, that answers the question.
A question.
I'm not sure about "the" question.
That's my car.
I had a real good time tonight. I really did.
Good.
Hey.
No jokes?
A good comedian knows when to stop.
You're sure about tonight?
I need sleep. Real sleep.
- Can I see you again?
- You're a brave man, and I'm real glad you asked.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Not bad, L.A. Not bad.
Hey!
Hey, don't forget my number.
Hey, Paul?
Paul?
Paul?
Dummy.
You meet a man and suddenly it's all toes.
It's a hell of a life, isn't it?
Hmm...
What have we here, my dear?
A new refrigerator.
Hello?
Present number one
Siberia? Uganda?
Hello?
Miss Michaels, we're checking to see if your air conditioning is still working
My air conditioning? But I...
Sorry to bother you, Miss Michaels.
That's okay, Charlie,
I was getting too clean anyway.
This was left downstairs for you.
- Who brought it?
- I don't know. They left it by my desk.
- Okay, Charlie, I'll catch you later, okay?
- Thank you.
- Hello?
Present number two
I hope it fits
Wasn't so great, was it?
No, no, it was... It was delicious.
Thanks.
- You want some more wine?
- No, thank you.
Hey, what is it? Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
I'm tired because I'm working, and I'm working because I'm tired.
I'm just working all the time, I'm sorry.
No. You've been quiet all night.
Okay, Professor, see what you think about this.
And I've been getting some weird phone calls, too.
Nothing exciting, just weird.
When I was in New York, this guy called me and wanted me to take photographs of my underwear and send... Send them to him.
Not me, just my underwear.
Look, do you mind if I hang on to this for a couple of days?
Be my guest.
I'd like to know about it, you know.
Yeah, so would I.
Right. Well, I better go. It's late, and...
- Look...
- No, it's all right.
I just...
I'm really attracted to you, and I don't want you to think that I'm not.
It just takes me a little while, that's all.
I'm not complaining.
I guess I was.
It's just my usual paralysis when I start to like someone.
Who was he?
Well, that's a long story.
Everything about me is a long story.
Well, I've got plenty of time.
Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You are one of the world's true bozos.
- Hello?
Sweet dreams, Leigh
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.
I have some bad news, there's no such company.
- Doesn't surprise me.
- I checked with the city.
They'd need a license to operate in Los Angeles, right?
No license, no record of Excursions Unlimited.
Listen, if... If it continues,
I think you should call the police.
What do I say?
Somebody's sending me presents and wants to take me on a six-month vacation? Make them stop?
Look, I have a class. It begins in about 20 minutes. I'll call you. I...
I want to talk to you about this.
Hey, Paul, thank you.
Yeah.
We...
We roll in 20 minutes.
We'd better check these things out.
Yeah. I'll be right there, Sophie.
This is impossible. It's the Roman revenge.
You curl this stuff up against your spoon and then watch it wriggle off.
Smoking your dinner?
Yeah, I'm afraid
I'm not very hungry tonight.
Or yesterday, or the day before.
Yeah, I guess I better watch it or I'll turn into the Thin Man, dry up and blow away.
Look, I know something's wrong.
It's none of my business, but if you want to talk about it, I'm here.
Thank you. That's real kind.
It's never really made you uncomfortable, has it?
- What?
- My preference.
It's nice to have a woman friend who isn't threatened.
Well, I'm with men all the time, and they don't threaten me.
So why should you?
- Excuse me.
- Are you getting any sleep?
Not much.
It's the phone calls, isn't it?
Yeah, letters, presents.
Maybe the creep will take one of his own trips soon.
Is there anything I can do?
What can you do that I can't?
I guess I'm just gonna have to ride it out.
Look, I've got to meet someone, but I can cancel it if you feel like talking.
- You go. It's okay.
- You sure?
Yeah. I should go home, try to get some sleep.
Okay.
- I'll take care of the check.
- Thanks.
- Late date?
- Not exactly.
I've got to decide if there's anything left to salvage here, or if I should really go to Forth Worth.
I'll be home later.
You call me if you need me.
- Yeah.
- Okay, bye-bye.
Can I have the check, please?
What's that?
Pouilly-Fumé Ladoucette. '71.
I didn't order anything.
Compliments of the gentleman at the bar.
- What did he look like?
- Just a man.
- Hello?
I'm sorry you didn't like the wine
Who are you?
Have you started to enjoy the view?
Police Department Tramer speaking
Yes, my name is Leigh Michaels.
I live at 4320 Arkham Tower.
I just received the latest in a series of crank phone calls.
He knows my name, where I live, where I'm working.
- Did he threaten you?
- No, not exactly, but...
I sympathize with you, miss, but I can't send anyone out to check on a phone call
In case he does anything, give us another call
In case he does anything?
I'm sorry, miss
Well, if he kills me, you'll be the first to know!
No!
Yes. Yes, I changed my number, and I'm still getting the calls.
Twice a day, two, day and night.
Well, if I keep a written log, how long will it take to get the authorization?
One week? But...
Yes, yes, I understand, but in the meantime...
All right.
Never mind.
Every time the phone rings
I think I'm going crazy.
Every time I go outside
I wonder if he's watching me.
It's all right. It's all right.
I'm gonna go to the police.
I already did that.
This time it's my turn.
This is not gonna go on.
It's all right. It's all right.
Don't call them now
- Please stay with me tonight
Of course
What time is it?
Hi.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
It's 6:30.
Why so early?
I have a class at 7:30. Aesthetics.
You believe that?
I was hoping we could get in with some little extracurricular activities.
- Tonight, all right?
- You're on.
Oh...
I'm gonna call Gary Hunt at the LAPD today.
I think we should speak with him.
- Can you see him tomorrow?
- Sooner the better.
What are you smiling at?
- You better go.
- I'll be at my office if you need me.
Okay.
Bye.
Up and at 'em.
All right, jerk.
I'm ready for you now.
Hello.
Leigh,
I like you better without the robe
Take it off
There are hundreds of windows up there.
He could be behind any one of them.
He's seeing everything.
That's why we insulate our lives.
Locks, change our phone numbers, guard our space with television cameras and guns.
He's trying to hurt you without touching you.
He's working from as far away as he can get, and still get to you.
- I think you should move.
- No!
He's not gonna chase me out.
I don't care how hard it is.
How dare he invade my life.
We don't know which window.
It's impossible to tell from here.
- Wine?
- Thanks.
I feel better already.
To be able to see in here, he's gotta be between 30 and the top.
Great. That narrows it down.
I know why he does this. It's kind of fun.
Pervert.
There's a woman on 33, cheating on her husband.
That guy can't be her husband.
He looks like Al Pacino.
How can they live this high?
They must get nosebleeds.
Where is everyone? Cooking dinner?
Rich executive in the penthouse is a connoisseur of classical music.
And moving downward, man on 47 loves horticulture.
And love is in bloom on 38.
You know, if we watched the lobby long enough, we could see this guy coming in.
If we knew who to look for.
I don't care who he is. I don't wanna know.
- Aren't you curious?
- I'm scared.
You're probably right.
Who wants to know their own rapist?
- Cut it out, Sophie.
- Well, that's what he's doing.
Rape is when a man consciously keeps a woman in fear.
We have an appointment with Hunt in an hour.
Will you stop?
Afternoon, Miss Michaels. A letter for you.
Who gave this to you?
It was on the desk when I came on duty this afternoon.
"From D.G. Hill,
President of Excursions Unlimited.
"We regret to inform you that you have not qualified
"for our travel incentive vacation."
What a shame.
"Your participation has reached final point
"and our only course of action
"is removal."
He doesn't like the drapes.
"Removal."
I'm sorry. It's just not enough.
He's scaring the hell out of me.
All right, what do we call the crime?
Peeping Tom? Attempted rape?
How about
"First degree scaring hell out of?"
You wanna know what I can do?
I can try to get you a tap, but the phone company will not install a tracer until they've completed a whole logging process.
And that's it? What else?
When he calls again, blow a whistle into the phone.
Get your phone number changed, get an unlisted number.
I've done that.
You can't do anything but give advice?
No. No, I can't.
Not until he does something.
Like what? Rape? Murder?
I don't blame you for the way you feel.
But you don't know who he is, you don't bring me anything in that he's done that wouldn't be thrown out of court.
No threats, no assault and battery, no motive.
I can't arrest a man for sending presents in the mail and dialing wrong numbers.
I'm sorry.
- That's terrible.
- Come on.
I can't believe it. My life is falling apart, so why am I laughing?
- You're drunk.
- I am not. You are.
- I am.
- I think I am.
- Oh, yeah?
- Leigh, I'm sorry about the Hunt thing.
I thought that he would...
I don't know. I don't know what I thought.
I'm going to the DA tomorrow.
That's funny?
Well, I'm going to Fort Worth.
- You're taking that job?
- Yes.
- L.A. Has lost much of its charm lately.
- No, you're not.
I'm gonna talk you out of it just as soon as I sober up a little.
- Maybe tomorrow or the next day.
- You know,
I think you should do your sobering up somewhere besides your own apartment tonight.
Why? He's not chasing me out of there.
Besides, I don't even think he's interested anymore.
- You know, he doesn't have a view, right?
- That's true.
- Let's leave them off, shall we?
- Whatever you say.
Isn't this a little soon to be coming back?
This is where I live, and he's not gonna drive me out of here.
Just... Leigh, let it ring.
It's 11:45 Out late tonight
I hope you like the drapes, because they're staying where they are.
I want to see you
Yeah, well, that's tough.
Look through the telescope
Who are you?
I'm not far away
Come, look for me
Leigh, look at this!
There's a guy outside with a telescope.
Which he's now pointing toward this building.
That's him.
That's the man from the garage.
Yeah, Inspector Hunt, please.
That place of all places.
They're there. Here we go.
I wanna see.
- Oh, she deserves to watch this.
- Sure.
Gotcha!
When did you take these?
Couple of months ago
You know, you're very photogenic, but this kind of stuff is illegal
When did you take that one?
- Never saw that one before
- But you mailed them to the lady
I had nothing to do with that one
I wanna stop looking, but I can't.
He's lives on a good-sized pension but he works part-time as an electrician.
So he knew how to rig your lights to dim.
He just spliced into the circuit with a rheostat.
He had a key to your building.
He said the laundry room had better machines.
- No
- What were you doing with the telescope?
Stargazing
Then why did you have it pointed toward Arkham Tower?
I was in the middle of setting it up
Now, look, I'm getting jacked around
I don't like this
Just open your ears and listen to me
I did not do a damn thing!
I wouldn't say that
We got nothing on him but a few dirty pictures.
But at least we got him.
Hey, what if he does the same thing in Des Moines?
I mean, what else is there to do in Des Moines?
He's gonna be tailed for 24 hours a day for the next six months.
I don't think he stands a chance.
Yeah.
But maybe I do.
I guess we can open these now.
This is why I got this place.
Isn't that beautiful? I love L.A.
You know something?
If I were you I'd leave those closed, especially when I'm around.
Aye, aye, Professor.
Mr. Edison, Mr. Telephone, Mr. Leone.
You guys can all wait. And who are you?
Hmm?
So the guy sent you one last farewell letter.
Got any more phone calls?
Leigh, there's something
I want you to understand.
Sometimes we do things that are a little irregular.
And we certainly won't get any medals for them, but as long as they get the job done we feel they're all right.
What I want you to understand is, we pressured this guy out of town.
He lost his job, he lost his pension, and I personally put him on the plane to Des Moines.
I will be getting reports every week from Des Moines.
He still lives there.
Now come on, Leigh.
You just gotta let this thing go.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I gotta catch a plane at 8:30.
I came to give you these keys.
He's still there.
- What are you talking about?
- He wasn't the one.
I don't see anything. The place is dark.
Where's Hunt?
He won't be back till 11:30.
Paul's in San Francisco.
If I call the police again, they're gonna think I'm crazy.
- You watch the lobby.
- Wait a minute.
I need an edge.
Something like this.
No.
- I kind of hope I run into him.
- No, Leigh, you can't do this!
Yes, I can.
I'm at the lobby
Can you see me?
I see you. The penthouse is still dark.
I'm going up See you at the top
I made it. Absolutely no one saw me.
Couldn't have worked better.
It's still clear
I think I'll try some romantic lighting.
What are you doing?
Don't worry. I'm just getting in the mood.
Let me check the lobby.
It's still clear.
I'm in Sophie, the door was open
- Creep's got some fancy place here
- Hurry up.
Are you okay?
- So far.
Sophie, I found it.
It's a huge big telescope, and some sort of weird tape recorder that looks like it's hooked into the telephone.
That's it
Now hurry up and get out of there!
This is unbelievable.
He's got a notebook that's logged every time he's called me in here.
Every entry.
We got him
I'm gonna try focusing this thing
Leigh.
Open the drape.
I hear something
Leigh
Listen to me, the front door!
Leigh! He's in here now!
- No, no, no!
- Sophie?
- No!
- Sophie! What's...
- Leigh!
- What's... What's happening?
Sophie!
Sophie!
Sophie! Sophie!
Sophie!
Sophie!
Sophie!
Belongs to J.D. Nichols.
Bachelor, advertising executive.
Now, he's been away on assignment for the past two months.
Kind of fancy, isn't it?
Okay, let's wrap it up.
I ran a check on Sophie.
She booked a flight to Fort Worth at 8:30.
Columbia Airlines 447.
The ticket was used. She made the flight.
No! He killed her.
I saw it through that window.
She didn't leave any forwarding address, but her landlord said she was going to spend some time with friends for a couple of weeks.
So I called KXA in Fort Worth.
They said they'd look into it.
They promised she would call me as soon as she started work.
She's dead!
What does it take to get that through to you?
He set up that other guy and he killed Sophie.
Come on, Leigh. Let's go home.
I saw it.
I was here.
It happened less than an hour ago.
Nothing happened here tonight.
Nothing except the police breaking and entering in the middle of the night.
He's better than you thought.
He's still doing it and he's getting away with it.
He's controlling all of us now.
He's got his distance.
He's got you believing he doesn't exist.
Oh, he exists, all right.
In Des Moines, Iowa.
You left the shower on, Leigh
You okay?
Hey! Hey, you stopped it yourself.
You hit the stop button.
Leigh, Sophie is dead
Remember how it sounded?
Listen to me, the front door!
Leigh! He's in here now! No, no!
Leigh!
I mean, how could you tell?
It was her voice. I know her voice.
Do you still believe me?
Yes.
You're the only one who does.
Well, he had to be close, within a block, maybe in his car.
So he put somebody else on the plane in place of Sophie.
And eventually she won't show up in Fort Worth, and eventually they'll do something, but that may be weeks.
In the meantime what else is he gonna try?
You know, this guy, he's amazing.
Seems to control two high-rise apartment buildings, the elevator systems, the electrical...
I mean, who could do that?
Who could do that?
I mean, who could control all of that, and yet remain totally invisible?
I'm not so sure you want the maintenance and safety department.
The fire department might be a better bet.
No, no, we've already spoken to the fire department.
See, I'm doing a piece on buildings in L.A., and we'd just like some general information, if you could.
- All right, go ahead. I'll see if I can help.
- Good. Who...
Who's in charge of inspections of apartment buildings?
Our monitors make routine inspections on all structures.
Monitors.
A monitor is a bonded employee of this department.
He would have master keys to every building in the city.
Every building.
Yes, he's got sensor devices, light, heat, cold, whatever the lock is programmed for.
He's also got skeleton keys, he's got bolt picks, bolt repressors, all that stuff.
Could he control elevators, say?
Oh, sure, sure. He can get in anywhere.
But now, look, we do notify people before an inspection, and the sensor devices are only used in case of an emergency.
Yes, of course.
How many monitors do you have working for you?
Only one.
A very solid, responsible man who's been with us for about 10 years.
Herbert Stiles.
If you want to speak with him,
I can put you in touch in a few weeks.
Right now he's on vacation out of town.
No, I wonder if we could take a look at some of your records?
- Here.
- What?
January 16th, Stiles checked out the electrical system in Arkham Tower.
Look at this.
He inspected the air conditioning ducts last year, computer relays the preceding year.
I've got four other buildings that he's inspected in the last 12 months.
I wonder...
Yeah, how close do his tours of inspection coincide with crank phone calls,
"Excursions Unlimited" letters?
Suicide.
Yeah, I know, I could be all wrong.
Look, I'm going to the police station.
I'm gonna check their records against these dates and his vacations.
I'd be curious to know if they match.
Terrorizing women may be his idea of a perfect vacation.
I have to check in at the studio.
I haven't seen Frimsin since yesterday.
I've almost forgotten what I do for a living.
- I'll pick you up there in two hours.
- Right.
I won't be long. Please wait a few minutes.
Yes, ma'am.
- I got him.
Where are you?
Stiles' house.
I broke in a few minutes ago.
- Get out of there
- It's okay.
I took a taxi so he wouldn't recognize the car, and the driver's outside.
- Did he
- No, he didn't see me break in.
Listen, it's all here.
The telescope, tape recorder, the printing press, everything.
I also found some brochures on surveillance equipment.
This morning I saw something in my apartment on the floor.
It was a mike. He's been bugging me.
He called the first day at the studio to make sure that I wasn't gonna be there, so he could put the bug in.
He knew when we went to the police, he knew when Sophie was alone.
I want you to leave, now,
and meet me at Hunt's office
I've matched up three women, all in their 20s,
all single, living alone, who committed suicide
during the periods he was supposedly on vacation
All of them lived in buildings he inspected
Now, we'll get him, but together
Okay. I'll meet you there in an hour.
Just have something to do first.
Forget your keys?
Yes. You scared me half to death.
Okay, now look, I gotta get going.
I got another call, okay?
You know, if you want me to take you someplace...
Arkham Tower.
You're hiding, aren't you?
You're afraid of me.
You're afraid to get too close.
Come on.
Face me.
I'm still scared.
You've got a good chance.
Just like that?
I don't even get to see who you are?
Help! Murder!
You got too close.
Clint, look out!
Oh! Now you did it.
Oh, am I glad you're not hurt.
Those canoes aren't very stable.
It was just one of those things!
Just one of those things, Mac.
I admit it, it was stupid.
We were out testing this baby, and I thought we'd sneak up on you and make a few waves.
- I guess I blew it, huh?
- The sound you hear is the wind rushing through my brother's head.
Look, all I can say is I'm sorry.
Just let me have a list of all your stuff, and I'll replace it.
You got any diving gear?
You can't dive here.
The bottom drops off.
And besides that, the mud is so thick, you couldn't see two feet.
Believe me,
I've been down there.
We're both really sorry, really.
My name is Clint Crockett, if you wanna know.
I'm Karen.
Smith.
What, just Smith?
Pickett Smith.
Hello.
It is a canoe.
And there is a stranger with them.
Damn it, Stuart, get down there and find out what the devil's going on.
Jason, they'll be up here in two minutes.
If it's too much of an an inconvenience for you...
Ah, there's the pirate camp.
How are you at badminton?
How about tennis?
I play-
Clint loves to play games he's sure to win.
- How are you at Ping-Pong?
- Lousy.
Hey, look, I just wanna dry out a little bit.
- Then I'll be on my way.
- You'd better forget it, pal.
You're fresh blood for our fun and games.
Now, how would you like to partake in a nice friendly wage?
At least we owe you a drink or two and some lunch.
- Really, I don't wanna intrude.
- Intrude?
No, tonight's very family, very traditional, but this afternoon is practically a picnic.
We'd love to have you.
How about it, buddy?
All right.
Mr. Smith, this is my uncle,
Stuart Martindale.
- Pickett Smith.
- Mr. Martindale.
How do you do?
What happened?
Well, I was testing the new engine, ran into Smith's canoe, and I swamped him.
Seems the canoe swamped you.
Something like that.
Mr. Smith accepted our offer to stay for lunch.
Delightful.
I'll tell Maybelle.
You tell Jason.
As soon as Grandpa gets a look at you,
Karen will show you to my room.
You will do that, won't you, Karen?
- I will.
- We'll get you some dry clothes.
See you then.
Clint, where you going?
Gotta change clothes, Grandpa.
Karen, what's going on?
Grandpa, this is Pickett Smith.
Mr. Smith, Jason Crockett.
- Hello, Mr. Crockett.
- My cousin, Michael Martindale.
- Hi.
- Well, Karen?
Grandpa, Clint didn't know what he was doing out there, and we nearly ran Mr. Smith down, so we fished him out.
Now we're gonna offer him a little food and drink.
After he gets changed out of his wet clothes.
Just a moment.
Mr. Smith, I saw you out on the lake early this morning.
You've been paddling around this island for hours taking pictures.
Yes, sir.
Don't you know that's against the law?
- Oh, Grandpa.
- No, sir, I didn't.
There's a sign out there that says private property.
Who you with anyway?
I'm a freelance photographer.
I'm doing a pollution layout for an ecology magazine.
Take any pictures of frogs lately?
I saw the biggest bullfrog this morning, this big.
Damn creatures are everywhere.
Croak all night.
Well, you know I sent Grover out to take care of that.
Mr. Smith, did you happen to see a man spraying in that small bay on the north shore?
Later. This man has gotta change out of his wet clothes.
- Grover's not back yet?
- He'll be back, Karen.
I'd like to call my editor.
Can I use your phone?
Oh, sure, right there, and when you're finished,
I'll introduce you to the rest of the family.
It's dead.
Oh, you'll get a dial tone.
We're on a regular line.
It's dead.
It's probably just the holiday.
It'll come back on soon.
Oh, Karen, look.
Look what the kids did.
- Cute, huh?
- It's adorable.
Jenny, uh, this is Mr. Pickett Smith.
This is Clint's wife, Jenny.
Hi, Jenny.
Hello.
Well, where's Clint?
He's upstairs changing his wet clothes.
What happened?
It's a long story.
Yeah, it usually is.
Come on.
I'll introduce you to the rest.
Okay, you all, time out.
A quick hello to Pickett Smith.
This is my aunt Iris.
- How do you do?
- How are you?
And my cousin Kenneth Martindale.
And Miss Bella Berenson.
Pickett Smith.
- Hi.
- Welcome to Crockettland.
Hi. I'm not quite awake yet,
Mr. Pickett.
But I can hardly wait to see what you look like.
Well, now you can take that shower that you were promised.
Uh, Clint and Jenny's bedroom is the second door on the right upstairs, okay?
Okay.
Kenneth, where do you suppose he came from?
Mom, your guess is as good as mine.
There. Finished.
Do you think Daddy will like it?
The monarch I just caught?
I think it's the largest specimen ever found in this state.
And the other one I got at the Vermont farm.
Butterflies are really in,
Mrs. Martindale.
Oh, I'm so glad I'm in, Bella.
Now, where's that metallic paper?
I must get this wrapped before lunch.
Didn't I tell you that a weekend here would be something else?
Do you find it a little weird for a middle-aged lady to chase butterflies?
Honey, if that's her thing,
I do believe she's entitled.
Me, myself, I just never had the energy to run after anything.
Perfect timing, pal.
Caught you looking at my jersey, didn't I?
Looks like you were quite a jock.
Well... it was my wife's idea.
You see, she's still impressed with me ever since
I was the school's highest scorer.
Oh! Yeah?
I don't think I've ever heard of Mid-West Valley Central.
Not everybody has.
But I hope my two go there.
You'll meet them later.
That picture, that's Jenny when she was a cheerleader.
Pretty girl.
Yeah, I'd say she was, too.
Always was.
Recognize old Clint? Huh?
I'm the same weight now
I was when I was playing.
Not one extra pound.
It's really funny.
Jenny, she's got a few more extra little tiny bags under her eyes.
That's about all.
Come on, why don't we help ourselves to some dry clothes?
I think it'll make us both feel pretty good, huh?
Do it, girl. Do it.
Yeah!
Pretty, pretty, pretty!
- Ah-ha.
- Mr. Kenneth, I have a message from your grandfather.
With or without the profanity,
Charles?
I was told to quote him exactly.
"Has your damn watch stopped?"
Message received, Charles.
Has your agency ever thought of packaging your grandfather and giving him a new image?
He knows he's not popular with the public or his family, and he revels in it.
Well, he treats me nice enough.
He wouldn't dare admit that we've shaken him up.
Nobody ever invites guests for Fourth of July, and I bring you.
A girl. Worse.
A sexy model.
And that ain't all either.
But would Jason ever admit we shook him up? Never.
Well, it looks like most of the family have joined us.
Clint, any reason why your children should be 12 minutes late?
Where are they, Jenny?
Grandfather, you know how difficult it is to get those kids away from the pool.
And on a day like this?
Well, I told them.
I told those kids 20 minutes ago to get out of their wet suits and change for lunch.
Jenny, far be it from me to tell you how to raise your children, but if you forbid them the use of the pool until they've learned the rules of being at meals on time--
Well, it's not my fault.
I'll make sure they understand that, sir.
Hey, everybody, look!
Look! Look what I found!
Look what I found.
He's gigantic.
Don't be so stupid, Jay.
Don't, Mike! That's mine!
Now, listen, Jay, Tina, you're both late.
Now go sit down and eat your food.
Jay, you were right.
He was gigantic.
Oh, I hate those things, and that make so much noise.
Just making everybody crazy.
Oh, nonsense, Jenny.
You see many frogs along the shore, Mr. Smith?
Yes, sir, a few.
More than you consider usual?
I guess so, but sometimes they have a summer like this.
Animals overpopulate.
They'll die off by next year.
You sound like you might be an ecology expert. Are you?
Yes, sir, to an extent.
Well, you see,
I have an impatient family.
They can't wait till next year.
How do they get rid of the frogs now?
Well, it seems like everyone in our family is hung up on frogs.
They really do keep us awake every night--
Those of us who don't consume a fifth of vodka every night, that is.
Which reminds me, how do we get rid of 'em?
I have suggested pouring oil in the water to choke them off.
That would help, wouldn't it, Mr. Smith?
Yeah, but you'd be killing a lot of other things at the same time.
And make my home smell like a refinery.
Well, I can't sleep.
It's not the end of the world, Jenny.
Well, it seems so.
With all our technology and all my money, we still can't get rid of these frogs.
Interesting, isn't it?
Yes, sir, it is.
But you'll think of something.
Well, I suggest you do me a favor.
Go take a good look round.
Come back, give me an honest report so I can quiet down this nervous group.
All right.
You have a deal.
Good.
These things feel a lot better.
Thank Maybelle for drying them for me, will you?
I surely will, and congratulations.
You seem to have impressed Grandpa.
- That's good.
- You have a nice trip.
Okay. I'll see you later.
Mr. Smith, may I see you a moment?
That'll be all, Michael.
I was just on my way out,
Mr. Crockett.
Would you mind closing the door?
Now, if I might ask a small favor.
It's obvious you can't see the whole island before dark.
I don't think I have to see the whole island.
But if you would take the north road, keep your eyes peeled for my man Grover.
He left about 6:00 this morning to do some spraying up in that little bay up there where the mosquitoes and the frogs are pretty bad.
But it's my belief he's A.W.O.L. with that little lady friend from across the lake.
If you do see him, will you tell him I want him?
Yes, sir, I'll be glad to.
Wanna take one of these?
Oh, no, sir.
I don't think a stuffed bullfrog would add a thing.
Maybelle?
Oh, I couldn't.
Not now.
Oh, come on.
Live a little bit.
Oh, well, why not?
But don't tell anybody.
Hey, a toast to Crockettland.
Mmm.
You know, um... my name's Maybelle, too.
Kinda thought so.
Born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi.
- Oh, Bella?
- Yes?
There's always hot coffee and a friendly conversation in the kitchen if you ever need it.
Thanks, Maybelle, 'cause I think
I might be needing it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Oh, well, just kind of relax, and you'll get it after a while.
That's an unusual dress, Bella.
Did you make it?
No, I didn't make it.
I designed it.
And I think it's fantastic.
We are talking about the dress, aren't we?
That noise is driving me insane.
Won't they ever stop?
Stop complaining, Jenny.
It'll stop soon.
Daddy, what if Grover's lying in a ditch somewhere?
I hope he's not hurt.
Serve him right if he is.
Oh, Grandpa, that's awful.
You make it sound like the worst of the ugly rich.
We are the ugly rich.
Well, we're entitled to be ugly, Karen.
God knows we pay enough taxes.
Daddy, did you know the government is forcing us to put strainers on our paper mills?
It's called antipollution control, Iris.
Oh, what's the difference what it's called?
It costs millions, and our dividends will be shot to hell.
Where'd you find Grover's Jeep?
- Far end of the island.
- And still no sign of Grover?
- No.
- Hell, I'm not surprised.
You can't depend on help these days.
Not unless they've been with you from the very beginning.
Is it still dead?
Yeah.
That dumb phone company.
Can we buy you a drink before dinner?
No. No, thanks.
- Can I see you alone a minute?
- All right.
- Is anything wrong?
- No.
How much longer,
Maybelle?
In a few moments.
I did everything with him I could, but we gotta get that body out of there.
Yeah. Well, thanks for telling me first.
I appreciate it.
No use frightening the others, today of all days.
Yeah, I gather tomorrow's quite a celebration.
This week with my family is the one permanent thing left in my life.
15 years ago, nature threw me for a loss, dumped me in this chair.
We have four birthdays in July--
Mine, Karen's,
Stuart, and Michael.
We've celebrated together for years.
We'll celebrate until I'm 100.
Right here.
Yes, sir, well, you have my birthday eve congratulations.
I'm sure it'll be a great day for everyone.
If I can't reach the village,
I'll have Clint or someone run me back across the lake.
What do you mean?
Stay here.
Stay here till morning.
And what about the body?
I don't believe it.
Look at this.
- Somebody kill it!
- Stand aside.
Charles, take it out.
Well, what's everybody standing around for?
Let's eat.
Frogs attacking windows, snakes in chandeliers.
Those aren't exactly normal things, Mr. Crockett.
I don't think there's much to worry about.
I'm sure I can get the state to spray some pesticides.
Yes, sir, I'm sure you can.
You can kill a hell of a lot of other things, too.
Mr. Smith, that is where you and I part company.
I still believe man is master of the world.
Does that mean he can't live in harmony with the rest of it?
You call that horrible racket out there harmonious?
Mr. Crockett, I know it sounds strange as hell, but... what if nature were trying to get back at us?
Nonsense.
Then how do you explain it?
We just sit and wait.
It seems like all I ever do around here is baby-sit, hope they don't do something that might annoy him, and they always do.
The family--
Boy, they don't like me.
And you.
You're out drinking in that speedboat all day and all night.
Well, I hate it.
It's only a couple of weeks a year.
It's "Yes, sir," and "No, sir," all day long.
The only one that matters is him.
What about me?
Shouldn't your wife come first?
Now listen to me.
I said listen to me.
Now, that old man is not gonna live forever.
And that means a million dollars or more to me.
All we have to do is just play our cards right.
I don't think that I can stand--
Just shut your mouth!
- Pickett?
- Hi.
- You all right?
- Sure.
Just looking around a little bit.
I'm getting like Jenny.
The frogs are driving me crazy, too.
It's like a different world out here at night.
This place must seem like a different place to you day or night.
How long you been doing this?
- What?
- Taking pictures.
Only real job I ever had.
Do you always work outdoors?
Whenever I can.
You must really like it.
- Yeah, I like it.
- Why?
Well, it lets me travel a lot... see a lot of country, meet some good people.
I'm on my own time.
Nobody on my back.
Freedom, I guess.
What were you and Grandpa talking about tonight?
Nothing. Just talking.
Did you have to close the door?
When you came back in the Jeep tonight,
I knew something had happened.
Now, what was it?
Come on, Pickett.
Tell me.
What is going on here that Grandpa doesn't think his own family is entitled to know?
I just don't know what it is.
All right.
It's getting damp out here.
I'm going inside.
Wanna come?
No, you go ahead.
I'll see you in the morning.
All right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Happy birthday, Grandpa.
- Happy Fourth of July, Grandpa.
I thank you, children.
Getting all ready for the excitement?
When do we get to do the Roman candles?
- And sparklers?
- When it's time. When it's dark.
After the birthday cake and everything.
You're old enough to know that by now.
Don't just stand there.
Go off and play somewhere.
- Okay.
- Another year gone by, Mr. Crockett.
Another happy day for everybody.
Yeah.
Thank you, Maybelle.
Another year ended, another year beginning.
Charles seeing to the decorations?
Oh, yes, sir.
Anybody seen Clint?
God forbid I should come before his training program.
Not quite like it was in college, huh?
That's just the trouble,
Grandfather.
It's just like it was in college.
Jenny, perhaps you'd like to help with the decorations.
If you've got the time.
Thank you. I'd love to.
Uh-oh. Something tells me it's the Fourth of July.
Or the Martians have landed.
Well, at least they didn't start before 8:00.
Obviously, some of the family haven't heard them yet.
Did you rest well, Mr. Smith?
Yes, I did. Thank you.
- Is there anything you need?
- Nothing.
Well, I'm going to mend my net.
I'll see you all later.
Welcome to another day in the life of the Crocketts.
- Want some more coffee?
- No, thanks.
Luau nearly came by your room last night.
Why didn't you?
The floorboards creak too much.
I'm sorry Jason Crockett doesn't keep his floorboards in better condition.
I liked talking to you last night.
We'll have to do more of it.
All right, I'm ready to play
"King of the Log."
Hey, Smith!
He's not here.
Where is he?
Michael, when you're through pounding, why don't you warm me up a little bit?
No. No, I don't want to.
Aw, come on!
Come on.
Just don't hurt me.
The idea is to just step on that log... and stay on it.
Put your left hand behind your back like that, and that's all your have to do.
Just like that.
Come on, Michael.
Get him.
I've had enough!
The boy's a loser.
Your boyfriend get lost?
I wish I could be so lucky.
How would you like to fight me for my log?
That's really not my kind of game.
What is your kind of game?
I don't think you'd dig it.
It's a little slower than that and, uh... sophisticated.
Try me.
I'm not gonna be here that long.
Morning, Mr. Crockett.
Happy birthday.
Oh, thank you.
Had your breakfast?
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Hey, Smith, how about some games?
Later, Clint.
I wanna talk to him.
Yes, sir.
I thought maybe I'd look around your island a little more,
Mr. Crockett, if you don't mind.
I'll check out the phone line for you.
Michael, why don't you take the Jeep, go and see if you can find a line down somewhere?
Certainly, Grandpa.
Mr. Smith, seems to me you got something on your mind.
Care to tell me about it?
Sir, I don't wanna spoil your day here, but something's gotta be done with that body.
I'll tell you something else,
Mr. Crockett.
You overdone it with those pesticides and poisons here.
I'm afraid to think what's happened.
There you are, Mr. Michael.
Just in case.
Thanks, Maybelle.
And this year I believe I've thought of everything.
A new badminton bird, a new net, and four new rackets.
Oh, and, Kenneth, would you go into the greenhouse, dear, and get some cymbidiums and some of those pale green orchids?
You know, the little, teeny, tiny ones?
I just don't have time, and Maybelle isn't quite up to it.
Oh, a papilio glaucus.
I must get my net right away.
It's the least I can do.
Now, wait a minute.
I wanna show you my new beanbag punch.
No way.
Son, go get him.
Hey, cut it out, Dad.
Mix it up with him. Show him.
I'd love to see him on his ass.
I don't wanna show anybody anything.
If you're chicken, at least you could find something useful to do with yourself.
I suppose I could, um, put up the targets for rifle practice.
Or I could, uh, make sure that there are a proper number of beanbags.
I might even volunteer to play gin with granddaddy.
But you won't.
No, I won't.
Cymbidium.
Cymbidium, cymbidium.
Hmm.
Cymbidium.
Cymbidium, cymbidium.
I hope you realize that was your last meal on the Crocketts.
Grandfather, I don't know when you wanna start the games.
Not everybody's back yet.
But, uh, you usually do start by now.
Who's not back?
Michael and who else?
Iris went off after a butterfly about a half an hour ago.
Kenneth said something about the greenhouse, about choosing some flowers.
Karen, go in the house and see if he's there.
If he is, tell him to get out here.
All right, Grandpa.
Jason, I'm sure Iris won't be very long.
If you're so sure, what are you standing there for?
Go find her.
- Okay. Yeah.
- Easy.
Wait a minute.
There's a lot of strategy in this once you get the hang of it.
Is that what you call it down here?
Yeah, that's what we call it down here.
That was nice.
Charles, have you seen Kenneth?
He asked Maybelle to get out some bowls for the flowers.
- That was an hour ago.
- Well, that's peculiar.
Grandpa's getting very impatient.
- Have you seen Kenneth?
- No.
What's the matter?
Is that still not working?
Mm-hmm.
What is going on here?
I don't know.
And your Grandpa is getting pretty tough out there.
I thought you were the one supposed to be able to handle him when nobody else could.
Yeah, and then comes the point when nobody can.
I'd better find Kenneth, or there's gonna be some real fireworks.
Hmm.
Okay.
Quiet, Colonel.
What is it?
What does he see?
What's going on?
Clint! Get me out of here.
Clint, keep your wife quiet.
Grandfather, something terrible is happening.
You be quiet!
Mr. Crockett, we all know how important your plans are to you--
You couldn't possibly know.
We're going ahead with this celebration today just as I planned, just as I've celebrated all my life, and nothing's going to stop it.
Christ!
- Kenneth, no!
- Bella, there's nothing you can do.
No! No!
He's dead! He's dead!
He's dead! He's dead!
Who's dead?
K-- K--
Oh, my God. I knew it.
You sure? How?
He's dead all right, Mr. Crockett.
There's bottles of poison broken all over that greenhouse.
He's been asphyxiated.
Karen, take me inside.
Clint, I'm gonna need your help.
I'd be glad to do anything I can, Mr. Smith.
Thank you, Charles.
- But why?
- Because I want you to and Grandpa Crockett wants you to.
But what's the matter?
Why is everybody acting so funny?
Just get up in your room and play.
How do you figure...
I don't know, Charles.
- Is there a place we can put him?
- Yes, sir. I'll show you.
Iris?
Iris!
Iris.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, no.
Oh...
Iris!
Aah!
Thank you, Maybelle.
Grandpa,
I think that we've got to--
We've just got to get out of here.
What about Mike, Iris, and Stuart?
When we get help, then we can find out what's happened--
Now, listen to me, all of you.
I'm just as heartbroken over this tragedy as any of you, but there's plenty of time later to do what has to be done.
Later?
Why wait, Grandpa?
Because I won't let anything interfere with today's schedule.
Not anything.
The year ends and the year begins.
It always has. It always will.
Always?
What do you mean, "always"?
I'm not interested in what you think.
Pickett, you've got to help us.
We don't know what to do.
Well, I know what to do, and we're going to do it.
Just because of one death, an accident, that's no reason for everybody to panic.
Two deaths, Mr. Crockett.
Two very strange deaths.
- Who else?
- What did you see?
Grover's dead.
Found him yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Because I thought it best not to.
Didn't want to spoil your day.
Whose day?
What happened to him?
He was in the swamp.
He'd been hit by a snake.
Is that another accident, Grandpa?
Is that another coincidence?
Karen, and everybody... this conversation is ended.
No, it isn't.
Look, I don't know what's going on around here, or if it's happening anywhere else, but we're a bunch of damn fools if we don't face the fact that we're in a hell of a lot of trouble, and we're gonna have to get together and fight it.
Keep on talking, Pickett,
'cause you're the only man around here who's saying anything.
First of all, we're gonna have to try to find Iris, Stuart, and Michael.
I'll be very honest with you.
I don't think we will.
Not alive, anyway.
But whether we find them or not, we've got to get off this damn island.
All of us. Now!
We'll take the powerboat.
If we have to, we'll tow the canoe.
And leave this house empty?
Deserted?
I don't think there's gonna be anyone around to worry about today, or haven't you noticed?
There hasn't been one boat out on that lake all day.
Do you think that's happening everywhere, Mr. Smith?
Well, if it is, we all better get out of here together.
Well, I forbid it!
I control these people, not you.
Nobody controls me, Mr. Crockett.
Now, I am asking to get off this island, by myself or with somebody else.
I just wanna go!
You can leave whenever you feel like it.
Mr. Crockett, begging your pardon,
I do believe Mr. Smith made good sense.
We must all go together.
What are you saying?
Are you contradicting me?
Just because of one small crisis, you want to run?
Mr. Crockett, really, it's not a small crisis.
You got to see that.
I see who's loyal and who isn't.
That's what I see.
Now, if you wanna go, both of you, well, go.
Do you?
Maybe you haven't heard about it, stuck out here in vacationland, but five score and seven years ago, they just started letting people make up their own mind.
Mr. Crockett,
I wish you'd change your mind, for your own safety.
- Mr. Crockett--
- Do you want to leave?
Then leave. Get out!
All three of you, go on!
- Clint?
- Yes, sir?
Take 'em across the lake and leave 'em.
Take a good look round.
Then get right back here!
I can take care of that, sir.
Ladies, gentleman, you have about five minutes.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for your hospitality.
I'll write you my thank-you note when I get back to civilization.
You're in for one hell of a battle,
Mr. Crockett.
You better get ready for it.
Jessie?
Jessie?
Damn it, where are you?
Pickett, is there anything we can do to help?
No, nothing.
Either one of you know how to handle these things?
- I'm afraid not.
- I've always hated guns.
Karen, even under these circumstances, is there any reason why we can't get something to eat?
Of course not, Grandpa.
I guess the kids must be pretty hungry, too.
What would you like?
I'd like the menu that was originally planned, starting with a double old-fashioned for me.
- All right.
- Well, where's Clint?
Shouldn't he have been back by now?
All depends on how many beers he took with him, doesn't it?
Yeah, I guess so.
Clint?
Clint!
Clint!
Help!
Aah! Help!
My God.
They're all over out there.
- Got any gasoline around here?
- In the tool shed.
- Here, Grandpa.
- Thank you.
You see that?
Soon as I went after them,
- they scattered.
- And very intelligently, too.
The frogs are thinking now.
The snails are planning strategy.
They have brains as good as ours.
Is that your point?
- Where's Mommy and Daddy?
- Where's Mommy, Karen?
Well, your Daddy hasn't come back from across the lake yet, but I think your Mommy just went outside.
- I didn't see her out there.
- Mommy!
Wait!
Mommy, Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy!
Pickett?
That settles it.
We're leaving. Come on.
Where are they, Karen?
Why isn't Daddy in the boat?
We don't know, darling.
We just don't know.
How we gonna leave?
Like chickens with their heads cut off.
Grandpa Crockett,
Daddy's not in the boat and it's out there all by itself.
She's right, Mr. Crockett.
There's no one in it.
- We're all leaving now.
- The Crocketts are staying!
Grandpa, after all that's happened today, do you think it makes any difference whether we stay?
I'm staying, and you're staying.
But don't you understand?
I can't let the children stay.
And I can't let you stay either.
If anyone gives orders in this house, I do.
If you want to disobey me, all right, go ahead.
I thought you, at least, were different.
Thought you had the Crockett strength, the guts.
But if you want to leave, go.
Go on.
Get the hell out of here.
Just stand up and be counted.
That means are you with me or against me?
You understand?
Are you gonna be all right?
You worried about me?
Well, thank you for your concern.
I'm going to be perfectly all right.
I get into that elevator by myself.
I get into bed by myself.
That's where I'm going, and I'm going to sleep like a baby.
- Can I take that shotgun?
- Take anything you like.
Don't bring it back.
Many happy returns of the day.
To me.
Okay, let's go.
Bye, Grandpa.
Grandpa?
Okay, kids, we're leaving.
You're gonna have a chance for one Fourth of July race anyway.
Now, when I say,
I want you very carefully to run down to the dock, okay?
And watch out for the frogs.
On your mark, get set, go!
Stay with 'em a minute.
Oh, my God!
- What's wrong, Karen?
- Nothing, darling.
- Stay down. Keep real little.
- Okay.
- Hold on to the sides.
- Okay.
Keep real steady.
- What happened?
- We're on a snag.
Damn.
Pickett, be careful.
- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus!
Pickett--
Damn.
Hello?
Hello?
- Nobody here.
- Karen?
Oh, darling, just hold my hand.
Come on. Get going.
Come on.
Hello.
Is anything wrong?
We had a little trouble.
Can you give us a lift?
Oh, sure, I'd be glad to.
- Hop in.
- Great. Come on!
Did your car break down?
No, it's a long story.
Thanks for stopping.
Well, we're headed for Jefferson City.
I just picked my son up at camp.
- Hi. I'm Bobby.
- Hi.
We've been on this road for practically three hours straight, and you're the first souls we've seen in an hour.
It seems very strange that everybody's disappeared inside on a holiday.
Hey, wanna see what I caught?
They were all over the place at camp.
Ever seen a monster big as him before?
Quiet, Colonel!
Colonel!
Hello? Hello?
Hello!
Hello?
But it can't be dead.
It rang!
Oh-- oh--
There!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Someone's shooting!
At approximately a sniper, utilizing a telescopic rifle opened fire on pedestrians.
His first victim, Alfred P. Majors, was killed instantly when a .22-caliber bullet passed through his temple.
14 other citizens were mortally wounded.
Due to the tie-up, police found it impossible to reach the scene of the homicides, and emergency vehicles were unable to get through.
At 12:24 p.m., the police helicopter patrol pinpointed the sniper
as being perched on top of the water tower at the Haskell Publications building.
But, before appropriate action could be taken, one of our officers took the initiative of climbing the water tower in an effort to talk the sniper down.
- He say anything?
- Um-mm.
Hey, Pete, he's gonna come down.
Listen, I'm not coming up to arrest you.
I just wanna talk... find out who you are, why you've done this.
Pete!
Get down here!
Pete, the helicopter's on its way.
They'll take care of it.
Get outta there!
We have plenty of time, none of us are going anywhere.
I'm Peter Nicholas.
Is there anybody you want us to call, notify you're up here?
My name is Harold Gorman.
Do you want us to get in touch with your family?
I don't care.
I-I don't believe my son had anything to do with this.
He was a very good student.
I-I mean, he couldn't possibly have killed all those people at that distance.
People have told me that it is physically impossible.
Now, there might... there must have been a lot of people firing from those roofs, and the... and the police are... are covering that up.
Th-they're... they're blaming my son.
I grew up in a Catholic boys' school in the Bronx, graduated DeWitt Clinton
High School, a year at Fordham University before I joined the force.
Where did you go to school, Harold?
Why should you tell me all these things?
I want you to know me.
We don't kill people we know, do we, Harold?
Only strangers.
That's why
I'm coming up, Harold, so you can see my face.
Hi...
Hi.
I'm... I'm 34 years old.
How old are you, Harold?
I'll be 22 the seventh of July.
I'll never be 22, will I?
Well...
We can't bring anybody back to life, Harold.
Nobody can.
But there are a lot of people down there would like to know why you did this.
You mad at somebody?
It was a nice day.
Yeah.
You into drugs, Harold?
I don't do that. I don't hang around with those kind of people.
Can you tell me why you did this?
Yes.
You promise you won't tell anybody else?
I can't... I can't promise that,
Harold, you know.
It's my job to find out.
Well, I'll tell you anyway.
God told me to.
Don't!
Peter, hey.
It's okay.
What happened on that roof?
- Nothing.
- It's okay.
It's somebody else's turn to play hero.
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna pick on you today.
I'm giving you a day off.
Ahem, this is Miss Forster.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I took that class before.
They let me live.
All right.
Okay, bye-bye-
Again, Spanish Harlem.
I really should have a police escort.
I suppose the teacher
I'm subbing for got mugged in the boys' lavatory.
How'd you like to be mugged by a detective?
Maybe they're holding her for ransom.
Anything I could get for you?
I have to get dressed.
- Um-mm.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't understand how his aim could be so accurate.
It was one of those old mail order rifles.
The sights weren't even properly calibrated.
Insane people seem to be graced with unexplainable powers.
I read that.
I'll bet you did.
I wonder what guided his hand.
Are you gonna tell me all those people were meant to die?
Oh, come on, Peter.
You're acting like some kind of rookie who's never been through his kind of crap.
You've heard every story in the book.
I'm driving out to Hempstead to see Martha.
People don't change.
It's really our decision, not hers.
The laws of New York State have grown up.
Anybody can get a divorce.
I think she's ready to be reasonable.
Why don't you try being honest with her?
You really have her believing that
I'm the one standing in your way.
Doesn't she know that you sneak off to mass every morning... like a thief?
Does she know that you confess everything to the priest?
Hey...
Peter.
I'm not out to hurt you, Peter.
I feel sorry for you.
You really believe.
But where is all the joy it's supposed to put in your heart?
I'll come again.
We'll talk soon.
Did you come here to ask me for something?
You want everything to stay just as it is.
That's fine with me.
But... what will your girl do when she finds out?
Aren't you afraid that she'll leave you?
It happened before.
Talk to me, Peter.
Is there anything you need?
No.
No.
I'm fine.
No.
Dr. Morello, 361.
Dr. Morello, 361.
Hey, this isn't really in your jurisdiction.
His wife said that he was sitting at home reading a magazine.
He suddenly got up, went down to the supermarket, took a knife, and started stabbing people.
John?
Why did you do it?
Take your time, John.
I know you can hear me.
Why did you attack all those people?
Why did you pick up the knife?
God told me to.
John? John!
Hello.
Don't ask who I am or how I know.
There's going to be another of those killings today.
Hey, who is this?
Hold on a minute.
Pete, get on the line.
This is your specialty.
Uh, excuse me, would you repeat that again, please?
Look, He has willed it to be.
Five more will die today along the route of the parade.
The St. Paddy's Day parade?
There'll be 5,000 dead-drunk, you mean.
Let me take this.
Uh, what do you mean, "he"?
Uh, how does he will people to kill?
You'll see. There'll be one of your own... a policeman.
- Which one?
- I don't know.
Maybe he hasn't even been chosen yet, but it's going to happen.
At what time?
At what point in the parade?
Sam! Sam!
Get down to the parade.
I'm not supposed to march in the parade.
Come on, there's gonna be a shooting.
I'll be there in a minute.
Listen, get me
Sergeant Duff, will ya?
He's on the parade route,
44th Street and 5th Avenue.
Oh, he's there.
He marches every year.
Find him, will ya?
Switch the call through to one of the cars.
This is Duff.
Sarge, is there any way of delaying the parade?
Stop the parade, sure.
Somebody's about to go berserk and shoot some people in the march.
It's gonna be a cop, probably a patrolman.
Yeah, I hear you, but I don't believe it.
Well, follow the march, will ya?
Keep your eyes open.
- It's gonna happen.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
Probably up where the mayor's watching, in front of the TV cameras.
Somebody's trying to terrorize the people in this city and they're gonna do it in a big way.
We got a tip there's gonna be a shooting.
Somebody in uniform, one of our guys.
Follow the march.
Stop the parade?
Rain or shine, that parade has gone on every year for 75 years.
Something new is gonna be added this year.
Look, it's too late, anyway.
The march starts in three minutes.
Pete, it's obviously a crank call.
All that bullshit about being "chosen."
Nicholas, stay here.
The Irish have waited all year for this day.
You are not gonna ruin it for them.
You got that?
- How many dead?
- I don't know...
God told me to.
God... told me to.
We gotta get the parade moving.
You rode in on the subway with Patrolman Jennings, right?
- Yeah, I did.
- Did you see him, uh, talking to any strangers on the train?
No, it was crowded.
Everybody headed for the parade.
But I did see him lean over.
He was talking to a kid on the train there.
How... how... what'd he look like?
Well, he was in his 20s, blonde hair, thin build.
Yeah, I rode Gorman up to the roof.
How did I know he had a rifle stashed in that package?
Well, was there anyone else in the elevator with him?
Yeah, I guess so.
I take hundreds of people up and down every day.
No, no, no, no, I mean, uh, a young man with... shoulder-length hair... blond?
People like that got no business in here.
Look, they try to come in and use the toilets, they shoot up.
We keep the toilets, all of them, locked.
Did... did you happen to see a young man like that
on the day German went up to the roof'?
Like I say, you don't see many of those.
Yeah...!
It was that day.
But I can't, for the life of me, picture him.
Did you see him the day of the murders?
Was he in here talking to anybody, a stranger or someone?
Yeah, hair down to his shoulders, like a girl, one of those hippie-types.
You have always to watch them or they rip you off... stealing from markets.
I must have seen his face, but it's like he didn't have any.
Did your son have many friends with long hair?
Well, my boy, he didn't hang around those types.
That's why I remember this one particular boy.
Uh, how old was he?
Was he about Harold's age?
I only saw him through the window.
My eyes are no good.
His face was a blur.
I couldn't focus my eyes on him.
That's odd, isn't it?
Did your son ever mention his name?
Uh, yeah, I think it was...
Phillips.
Yeah, from uptown,
Washington Heights.
You know, I knew he'd get my Harold into trouble.
I mean, anybody who would walk barefooted around the streets of New York City had to have something wrong with him.
Yeah, Bernard...
Bernard Phillips.
That's the name my son gave me.
- Bernard Phillips.
- Okay, okay.
- Bernard Phillips.
- Thank you very much.
Nobody seems to be very specific when it comes to this boy.
He was never drafted, never worked, never on welfare.
Lived a charmed life.
When you find him, ask him how he pulled it off, will ya?
Maybe he was blessed.
Never went to church, either.
Yeah, no... no religious preference, I guess.
Hey. You got all the blessings, who needs religion?
Yeah.
Check the school records?
They don't exist.
There are people like that.
Ahem.
Yeah? Who?
Have you tried juvenile offenders?
How 'bout where he was born?
Start at the beginning.
22 Broome Street,
Little Italy, right?
Maybe somebody's still left who knew him.
Uh, Mrs. Phillips?
Can I ask you some questions?
Say it! Come on, say it!
Gah... guh...
Say it!
God... God...
God...
- Come on, say it!
- Goh-hh!
You look pretty bad yourself,
Lieutenant.
Ah, I'm just numb.
You won't believe this, this is the first time I've been hurt.
You better stop by and get some stitches in that hand.
Didn't even get hurt when I was a kid when I fell off my bike.
Gonna have a nasty scar.
Did you find out anything else?
Uh, just there was a mistake in her identification card.
What's that?
Listed her
as a Mrs. Phillips.
So?
She wasn't a missus anybody.
She was a virgin.
I've delivered
9,000 babies in my career.
I truly could not tell whether that child was a male or female.
It was as if... as if the sexual gender had not yet been determined.
It was as if it were...
as if it were being... developed.
And you chose to call it a male?
Well...
I suppose I thought it was the best thing to do.
Inn:
The... the woman was not at all upset, you know, when I... when I broke the bad news to her.
She didn't even seem surprised.
And so, when she referred to the infant as a male,
I just...
I just went along with it.
I wonder how that... how the child turned out.
Yeah, male, female, or something else entirely.
You felt no animosity towards your family?
No, why should I?
I wasn't even thinking about them.
I was reading the sports page wondering what the Jets were gonna do.
When you had decided to get up, go to the closet, take the gun off the shelf, right?
Well, it, uh, just occurred to me, yeah.
- It just occurred to you?
- Mm-hmm.
It just occurred to you to shoot your wife?
No, I shot Jerry first.
Jerry was your son?
Yes, he was seven.
What did your wife do when she saw you shoot your son?
Uh, she wanted to stop me, and then she ran.
And then you shot her in the back.
- Twice, I think.
- And then your daughter.
What's her name?
My daughter?
Lindsay.
She... screamed and she ran into the bathroom.
The bathroom is the only room in the house with a lock on it.
Inn:
I said to her, "Lindsay, open the door for Daddy."
I said it was "only a game."
I told her that
Jerry and Mommy were all right.
The gun was a toy.
It was all in fun and if she came out, I'd let her play with it.
I'd show her how to do the trick.
Well, in a little while,
I heard a laugh.
Then I heard a click.
She came out.
She was laughing.
I was laughing when I shot her.
You don't feel any pity, do you?
Any remorse?
- I don't think I ever felt so good.
- How come?
Well...
I, um...
I... I thought
I'd do something for Him after all He's done for us.
He's given us everything, and asks for so little.
How could I refuse?
Huh?
How could I?
I mean, He wouldn't ask me to do anything that wasn't right.
They're with Him now, and they must be very happy.
You say He...
He spoke to you?
Inside me.
He guided my hand.
Do you know something?
I didn't even have to aim.
No, I...
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that
He asked too much of me.
But... you don't love God the way I do.
- You're a religious man, then?
- Not until today.
It... it happened all at once.
I've been searching for this all my life.
What was it in the Bible?
God asked Abraham to kill his son, Isaac.
Sacrifices to your god are nothing new.
Why are you looking at me
as though I were the first?
Life doesn't matter, not on this Earth.
Pete!
Son of a bitch!
You see this? This was your kid's.
You blew the back of his head off, you stupid bastard!
Easy.
Take it easy, Pete.
Take him out.
Get him out, will ya?
Get him out.
He's a nut.
They'll put that bastard in a home.
He'll never serve a day behind bars.
In five years, he'll be back out on the street.
We've seen his type before, Pete, you and I both know that.
But you, I've never seen you fly into a rage like that.
You've gotta be careful.
You might hurt somebody.
- I heard you got hurt.
- Yeah, yeah.
- A lady invited me up.
- Huh.
Uh, you ever..
You ever have a case where a crime was committed, and people say that God made them do it?
There's always some psycho around that says he's acting
"in the name of the Lord."
You know, I had women claim that they were laid by the Almighty?
But, when you looked into it, you found it was her stepfather or their high school teacher or someone else in authority that slipped it to them.
Huh. Girls have wonderful imaginations, Pete.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, my friend, Callahan, on the Jersey State Police...
God rest his soul... he had... he had a case like that back in '50, in the winter of '50 or '51.
Uh, the dame said,
"God did it."
24 years ago?
Yeah, I'm sure it was '51 because that was the year my eldest was confirmed.
There were a lot of elements in that case that couldn't be explained.
So, they did the next best thing.
They forgot about it.
Sit down,
I can't see through you.
I don't mind having company, but I don't wanna miss my show.
...back with more "Time is Money!"
All right, it's a commercial.
Now, will you tell me about Mrs. Phillips?
Huh? The night that you found her?
Hell, if I'd been her husband,
I would've beat the tar out of her.
She was hysterical!
I almost didn't take her into the car.
Oh, not that I didn't play around from time to time, but... she didn't look seductive, you know what I mean?
She looked like she'd been through hell.
Let me in!
Please, let me in!
Here.
Put this coat on.
Well, what'd they do to you?
Men like that ought to be hung up by the what's-its.
It wasn't men.
You don't know what you're talking about now.
I'm gonna you to State Police Headquarters.
You know, put this on you, please.
Not that way!
They're out there!
There's nothing out there but the city dump and an old dirt road that ain't been used since before the war.
Okay, okay!
We won't go that way.
I'll tell ya, lady, first police car
I see, you're getting out.
And don't get any ideas about accusing me or nothing.
- It was as large as a house...
- What?
But it didn't set on the ground, it hovered.
Huh?
And they raised me up and I floated up into it.
- What...
- Then, they took all my clothing away, but they were very gentle, but I couldn't see them.
Nothing, except a single light that blinded me.
Sure, okay.
What are you talking about?
Where are we?
Those are the lights of Jersey City over there, and then... well, where do you think we are?
- They took me from Nantucket Island.
- Huh?
I was walking on the beach alone.
I-I like to be alone sometimes.
It was a sound... a hum, overhead.
And then I couldn't move.
I couldn't do anything.
I-I looked up, and it was over me like a heavy cloud, only it was very low.
And then, it started coming down over me.
I want to talk about it.
Please, say something!
I-I know I'm making you afraid, but talk to me!
Uh, well, what else did they do, these people?
They... they put me in the middle of this light... this warm, glowing light.
- What time is it?
- Oh, it's 10:34.
It seemed so long.
It was only a little after 10:00 when I went out for my walk.
Wha... in Nantucket?
And half an hour later, you're in
Jersey Sound with your clothes off?
Hey, come on, that's crap.
Well, it mustn't have taken very long.
Hey, did they look like us?
I mean, they have no clothes on, too, huh?
They have, uh...
I mean, did they, uh... did they fool around some, huh?
And that's the last I saw of her.
Well, I figured I was lucky.
She didn't cry rape.
Right?
Yeah.
She was raped, all right.
A child was born of that union.
I checked the birth record.
What're you talking about?
Hey, listen, why don't you take the missus, go down to Miami, get yourself some rest?
Look, I can prove it.
I'm gonna find him.
Stop talking, Nicholas.
You're gonna screw yourself up good.
Yeah, I know.
You've come to the wrong man, Lieutenant.
I'm not a police reporter.
I'm a science editor.
But you're interested in the outbreak of unpremeditated homicides, aren't you?
Well, who isn't?
So?
So, in every one of these cases, the murderer has insisted that he committed the crime because God told them to do it.
That's been kept quiet by the Department.
They don't want complications.
Lieutenant, the religious editor is on the second floor.
Religion, by its nature, indicates belief, faith of some kind.
I'm talking about facts.
Cold, hard facts.
The kind you like.
You've tried the others, haven't you?
Nobody would print it?
That's right.
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out?
Every priest and rabbi from Staten Island to Yonkers would wanna hang me by my moustache for making them read sacrilege over their corn flakes.
'Cause you had the guts to print that stuff about God being an ancient astronaut.
Now millions of books are being sold on this stuff... this subject.
You got people to listen.
Eh.
What do you think would really happen if somebody actually believed that God was exercising His will directly over the city streets?
I mean, good deeds, much less mass murders.
Yeah, they'd be frightened, they'd be shocked.
Maybe the killing will stop if it's been acknowledged.
You're probably too young.
When I was around when Orson Welles told the people over CBS that the Martians were in New Jersey, and believe me, the show was not that convincing, not that good.
And you want me to tell them that God is at 57th Street and
Madison Avenue coaching snipers?
You know, I'd like to see it.
- All the atheists would love it.
- What's that?
God to show up.
It'll finish the churches, all the churches.
All my enemies would be out on their pious asses.
Total chaos, that's what I like.
Out of chaos comes reason.
Out of reason, science.
Crazy Lieutenant,
I'll write, they'll print.
Don't expect headlines!
Second section, the bottom of the page.
And if anybody objects, we'll print more and bigger!
That's journalism!
His father was a motorman on the BMT.
He, um... developed Parkinson's disease or something.
So, Peter became the sole supporter of his two brothers and two sisters.
Um, stepbrothers and sisters, actually.
He put both of the boys through college.
They went instead of Peter.
You know he was a foster child from the
Catholic Children's Home.
Uh...
The Nicholas family took him in when he was only a baby, so Peter felt he owed it to them.
Where are they now?
His adopted brothers?
One's in California, and the other died in Korea.
Any history of nervous disorders?
Does he sleep well at night?
Why don't you ask his wife?
He hasn't spent a night with her in the past four years.
He admits that.
He goes to church a lot, doesn't he?
I mean, not just on Sundays.
This is beginning to sound like an inquisition.
I'm going home now, gentlemen.
Now, listen, we just hoped you could make some sense out of all of this.
I mean, uh...
You know, people who are too goddamn religious make a lot of trouble for everybody.
He truly believes, and that sets him apart.
Religion can ruin a man.
You'll see to that.
Police continue to follow the outbreak of religious violence that has spread across the city in the past week.
Crowds, proclaiming the birth of a new God have attacked wantonly in mobs and without apparent motive.
Psychiatric experts label the phenomenon a classic example of mass hysteria, but can offer no other explanation.
- Phew.
- Lieutenant.
What the hell are you doing here?
You know better than to come down here.
Oh, come on, man, it's after 10:00.
What you afraid of, the cleaning woman?
Come on.
Jesus Christ.
Hey, man, look,
I am very pissed, man.
I mean, my bag man said that he made the delivery.
But my people are still getting busted.
It's the best I could do.
The Captain said he wanted some arrests, so I gave him a few.
I've been trying to figure out a way to deal with you without anybody coming after me.
Now with all this bullshit about God,
I think I found myself a sucker.
This isn't like the others.
Now you're gonna come up with new crackpot theories.
It's not enough that you caused this, that you leaked it to the press, you made a panic from one end of the city to the other.
The murderers always stayed with their victims.
They never made an effort to escape.
There was some other reason for Jordan's death.
Somebody had it in for him.
He was in business for himself.
Now, what kind of an accusation is that to make about a dead officer?
Jordan was working both sides of the street and you know it.
Maybe the boys up in Harlem held him responsible for their recent problems.
First it's God, then it isn't, huh?
I'm just saying it should be looked into.
Get off my back.
You're a pretty classy chick.
What happened?
Doesn't your man look out for you anymore?
My man gave me this.
He, um, used to be in business with the late Lieutenant Jordan, wasn't he?
How would a cop like you know that?
Thought you was one of those honest ones.
Uh... when I knew him, his, uh... his name was Brown, Joe Brown.
He's been out of town for a while.
How come?
I don't know.
Joe Brown... must be a million of 'em.
What's his name this month?
Zero.
'Cause that's exactly what he gives us gals that work for him.
Zero.
I'm convinced that the man who is in touch with us is everything that He claims to be.
Yes, He's proven His control over any number of human beings.
And He's always careful to inform us of His intentions before each of these atrocities.
Unfortunately, one of us has betrayed
His confidence to the police.
I'm sure
He knows who that person is.
Why must He precipitate such a bloodbath?
I mean, can't He communicate by any other media except violence?
Exactly.
Why can't He perform miracles?
Cure a few thousand people?
Wouldn't that be more impressive?
The only way the Lord has ever successfully disciplined us has been through fear.
Cure a man and you impress a few people who already believe anyway.
Kill a multitude, and you can convince a nation.
You ought to know that, Hirsch.
It worked with the Egyptians.
He killed off all their firstborn and then they let your people 90, didn't they?
I wonder if the cost of salvation isn't a bit high.
He's only made one request.
There's a policeman... a detective, who seems to threaten Him.
He wishes us to convince this man to join us without doing him harm.
Why would He be interested in a detective?
My boss, Mr. Richards, wants to see you.
Get in, please.
Thank you, John.
Will you wait downstairs?
Come in, won't you?
- Why don't you leave Him alone?
- Who you talking about?
- You know very well.
- What does He do?
Give you tips on the market?
I'm surprised that you can be so light about this.
You've seen Him recently, then, huh?
I've just come from Him.
Can't you feel His power still in me?
He trusts you?
Why?
We were chosen.
All of us.
Without so much as a letter, not even a telephone call, we knew to gather in New York on the first of the month.
He reached inside of our minds... honored us by His choice.
Oh... "disciples," huh?
He could've disposed of you just by willing it.
Must've had a reason to keep me around.
Perhaps He feels if He could convince a person like you...
Don't tell me that He needs to build up His confidence.
The last time the living God came forward on this earth,
He's the one who got murdered.
Did He ever mention
His mother to you?
Well, she's deceased, isn't she?
Did He ever talk about a time back in 1951, she was walking on a beach at night in Cape Cod, and... found herself in a meadow in New Jersey?
I don't wanna hear any more of this.
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't feel very well.
- What's wrong?
- I... I don't feel very well.
- Sit down.
- Get my chauffeur.
Get me a glass of water, please!
Here.
- Drink it slowly.
- I can't. Can't swallow...
Hold on.
Take it easy.
Come on, it's not your heart.
It's not your heart!
It's Him!
Come on, fight Him!
Fight Him!
He's trying to show me what He can do.
Fight Him!
Fight Him! Fight Him!
Fight Him!
Fight Him!
Damn You.
Kill me.
Kill me!
All right, police!
Everybody, stand back.
I was waiting for one of you to find me.
I tried.
I'm sorry...
I tried.
I'm really not very good at it.
Wish I could pray.
Logan, huh?
That's your name?
I-I warned you about the killings at the parade.
He forgave me.
He gave me one more chance.
- He's waiting.
- Let's go there, Mr. Logan.
- I can't. Not now.
- Why not?
I can't tell Him I failed.
You won't have to.
I'll tell Him for you.
Come on, let's go.
Uh...
He never comes upstairs.
I always go down to the furnace room.
He likes it there.
It's warm, and, uh, no one sees Him.
He stays in hiding?
Isolation.
It isn't necessary for Him to actually... contact us directly anymore.
He can make us know what he wishes...
'cause He learned how.
He's growing.
He's changing every day, becoming more powerful.
That's okay.
You're strong.
You've shown Him... you could exercise your will.
You brought me to You and now
You're afraid to let me see You?
Why is it so important
I believe?
What makes me different from the others You killed?
Accept Me. No questions.
Why are You afraid of me?
You're afraid
I'll find out something?
You can't kill me, can You?
Because I'm different, too.
I'm starting to feel it.
To find out.
I told you that you could be hurt.
Your stitches haven't yet healed.
Sister, we're investigating a series of crimes and we need your help.
Um, we need the adoption records for the year of 1941.
We don't usually release that information.
Oh, I know you don't, but it's very important for us to locate the natural parent of this child.
Well... the child would be a grown man by now.
Oh, yes.
I don't see how it could do any harm, could it?
Not at all.
Now, those records are probably been moved to the new building.
Uh, there's no record of the father's identity.
The child was born out of wedlock.
No, that's all right, we're more interested in the mother's name.
Mullin...
Elizabeth Mullin.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
I phoned earlier.
- About Miss Mullin.
- Yes.
You didn't tell her
I was coming?
There's no need to.
She's not going anywhere.
None of them are.
Would you tell me something about her, please?
She's an old maid.
You know the type?
- I'll bring her down for you.
- I'd rather see her upstairs,
- if that's all right.
- Sure, come on.
Oh, listen, you know, we can't be responsible for the condition of the rooms.
You know these people, they like things their own way.
There's this lady who lived next door to her who died a couple of days ago.
I mean, she just died sitting there looking out of the window.
Nobody even missed her till dinnertime.
Well, you know what they say...
"there's only one cure for old age."
It's second door to the right.
I'll just knock on the door, if you don't mind.
I'm sure you have something else to do.
Miss Mullin?
Miss Mullin?
You have a visitor.
May I come in?
Yes.
Come in. Shut the door before there's a draft.
It's a hot day.
You should open the window.
If you don't mind, I'm satisfied with the temperature in here.
What do you want?
Do I know you?
I'm a policeman.
I hope you'll be able to help me with some information.
Well, you've come to the wrong party.
Well, this is about something that happened a long time ago...
35 years.
My memory's all I have left.
None of the other parts work very good anymore.
Uh... you remember the New York World's Fair?
The original one in Flushing Meadows?
Oh, yes.
It was grand.
My father helped build it.
He was a construction worker.
Helped build the Perisphere.
But you wouldn't remember that.
You weren't even born then.
Do you ever remember talking to a policeman before?
About some problem... officially, I mean.
No.
About the same time as the World's Fair?
You don't remember making a statement to some officers in Queens County about a terrible experience you had?
Why would you want to know about that?
Well, let's just say
I think it might be important.
They wouldn't believe me then.
Why should you believe me now?
They made me tell the story over and over again.
All they did was laugh.
Pretty soon, I began to believe it never happened.
Few weeks later,
I realized I was right.
That was the first time my father ever hit me.
They sent me to an aunt for a few months.
Finally, I came back and... the baby was born in Queens Hospital.
So, you... you were coming home after the fair.
It was past 11:00 p.m.?
I can tell more what I felt than what I saw.
There was motion and the soft sound of engines, and... I seemed to be floating.
It was a ball of light all around me.
I... I felt it pass through me.
And the purring sounds stopped.
And I... I found myself wandering down the street near my home.
It was the next day.
Nobody believed me.
And I realized I was going to have a baby and nothing could stop it.
I swore to my father, in Jesus' name, that I never had slept with a man.
I never had.
I never have.
Oh, you...
you know Miss Simmons down the hall?
She never has either and she's almost 80.
I guess we're the only two virgins left.
I carried that baby inside me for nine months.
I hated it.
I couldn't understand.
I even thought of committing suicide, but... we were... we were Catholics, you know?
Didn't the church help you?
Yeah, they... they took the baby, and... they did put him up for adoption with a good Catholic family.
Yes.
They did just that.
Somebody at the hospital told me it was a boy.
I never felt it was mine.
It seemed to have a life of its own.
I'm glad I didn't see it.
Why have you waited all this time to come?
Who are you really?
You're him, aren't you?
I don't know.
I might be.
What are you?
I don't know any more than you do why they put me here.
For what reason?
What are you going to do to me now?
Oh, please.
Haven't you hurt me enough?
I was never the same after what you did to me.
Never. Please, don't... don't... don't... don't... don't touch me.
- Haven't you done enough?
- I didn't do anything to you.
Some other force wanted me born, wanted me to be carried by you, wanted me to... wanted me to live half my life before knowing what I was.
Why Pick on me?
Why me?
I never hurt anyone in my whole life.
- Why do you have to hurt me now?
- Don't you see?
What happened to you was over after I was born.
What's happening to me is just beginning.
You get out of here!
Don't touch me!
Don't ever come back!
What are you doing to her?
What did he do to you, ma'am?
Don't touch me.
Don't touch...
You're no cop!
- Calm down, ma'am...
- I don't want anybody to touch me.
I don't want anyone to touch me.
I don't want you ever to touch me again!
Do you know who I am?
I suppose you're Casey.
Please, come in.
He hasn't been home for three nights.
I'm afraid.
Peter isn't an ordinary man.
He never has been.
Why weren't there any children?
I mean, he seems to have some sort of hang-up whenever I mention kids.
I had three pregnancies.
Each one ended in a miscarriage in the fifth or sixth month.
Doctors could find nothing wrong with me.
There was no reason for the miscarriages.
No reason.
None.
I didn't know about that.
He never mentioned it.
He wasn't sorry.
Oh, he said all the right things.
But I felt he was relieved when the babies weren't born.
He was always frightened of having children.
An irrational fear.
It's crazy, but somehow I felt he knew they wouldn't be born.
How would he know?
The doctor convinced me... to have an operation so there wouldn't be any more pregnancies for my own well-being.
Father Dowling sanctioned it in the name of the Church for health reasons.
So...
I'm alone.
Sometimes
I sit here and wonder,
"Who did I live with all those years?"
I'm sorry, I have to go back to the city.
What kind of a man would hope and believe that his children would be stillborn?
Can you tell me, what kind of fear is that?
I was worried.
I thought you might've come here.
"Come home," you mean.
No, that's all right, that's all right.
No, I'm glad you're here.
I've never seen the two of you together before.
Odd, isn't it?
The two people you love the most.
Makes saying goodbye easier.
See, he's going away.
That's so, isn't it, Peter?
Well, you don't have to keep these for me anymore.
All my life,
I felt so close to God.
And it wasn't Him after all.
I wish I had saved some of that love for you.
I wish I could do it now.
Do you think you can set me free so easily?
Martha... help her if you can.
Like you've always helped me.
You came to her.
Would you have come to me afterward?
Yes.
Yes'
You don't have to do this.
You're going to get hurt.
Casey, the choices aren't mine, they never were.
Oh.
Honey, you don't even know who I am.
You won't let me get close.
There's nothing left.
Can't you see?
Look at me.
Look at me!
Can't you see?
Yes, I see.
We're all just gonna let go of each other.
Okay?
Okay?
Okay-
Corner two.
Hey, Zero!
Man, you got one of your customers waiting.
Hey, man! I've been waiting for you for three hours!
What you got there, huh?
What is this shit?
- Turkey, you holding out on me?
- No, man!
- Huh?
- Come on.
Come on, empty your pockets.
Inside out!
How do I know you haven't got a tape someplace, huh?
Huh?
Come on, man.
What you pushing me for?
- Come on, man.
- Child, move!
I dealt for you before,
20 times, man.
I just gave you a hundred dollars!
What's the matter with you, man?
Look at this guy, man!
Get in there!
Dude pushing on me... what's the matter with you, Zero?
Come on, man.
All right, drop your pants.
Drop 'em!
I ain't hiding nothing, man.
I'm gonna be good to you.
Ahem.
I'm gonna give you three bags.
Man, I just gave you a hundred dollars.
Inflation, brotha!
Man, I can't go out there with this.
They'll kill me.
It's either them or me.
Come on.
Who killed Lieutenant Jordan?
Flush the shit down the toilet.
Move!
Don't be afraid.
You crazy mother.
Alone you gonna bust my ass?
They ain't gonna let you do that to a brotha.
Hah!
Hey, wait a minute, man!
We're not the same, you and me.
I found you by myself this time.
You've tested yourself since we last met, and now you've experienced it.
I'm not gonna do it again.
In all living things, one set of genes is dominant.
In me, all that is human became recessive.
And you, my brother, if I may call you that, are the reverse.
That is why it took you so much longer to come to realize what you are.
That is why it's so difficult for you to break with the human portion of your character.
Why did they put the both of us here?
You were not like them, so they tried again.
If there are others, they'll be like me.
Your children would have been like me... if you hadn't willed them to die.
I didn't!
The history books are full of virgin births.
Who were
Moses and Jesus, really?
Our ancestors.
They were put here to create!
I can bear your child.
Together we could start a new species.
No! No!
It was meant to be.
It's meant to be.
You've never felt pain.
Mr. Nicholas... can we ask you a couple of questions, please?
Yes?
Could you tell us, sir, when you went to the building that night, were you aware that you were gonna commit an act of homicide on a person named
Bernard Phillips?
Yes, yes, I was.
You were. Sir, sir?
Can I just ask you... your reasons for performing this atrocious murder against a 24-year-old boy?
"God told me to."
Pardon?
God told me to.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Charles.
You're looking splendid.
I feel splendid.
Every day, and in every way, you're feeling..
Better and better.
- Indeed.
- Well, won't you sit here?
Wouldn't you like me to..
Not unless you want to.
No. I'll be quite comfortable here.
Thank you.
Doctor, I'm surprised.
Oh, of course. You quit.
Three months ago.
You know, there was a time when your forgetfulness... would have made me feel very rejected.
- Not now, hmm?
- Well, a little rejected, perhaps.
- Did you do it intentionally?
- Why should I do that?
Well...
I'm a patient you consider to be completely rehabilitated... on your recommendation soon to appear before the sanity board... your reputation on the line.
A little test, perhaps, hmm?
Not very long ago, an obvious trick like that... would have sent you into a towering rage.
And poor old Clouseau would have silently... and passively submitted to another massacre.
It's a miracle you were somehow able to keep putting him back together again.
Poor old Clouseau.
There was a time when I couldn't even speak his name.
And there was also a time when you would joyfully have killed him.
Yes.
I was a sick man, wasn't I?
We've come a long way, haven't we?
And you're not even a little bit bothered when you think of Clouseau?
Not even a little bit.
- Do you believe me?
- If you say so.
Well, I could be lying.
You are a good psychiatrist, but I may be a better liar.
For your sake, I hope you're not.
Sooner or later, you'd run into Clouseau... and then back here for life.
No more chance of another hearing.
Coming here day after day, watching you chain smoke into an early grave... and knowing on certain mornings, you'll be particularly morose and testy... because you've had another fight with your wife... like this morning.
- How do you know that?
- It's the only time you doodle.
I keep forgetting you used to be chief inspector of the Sûreté.
And will be again.
But Clouseau is chief inspector now.
Till the better man comes along.
Well, in that case...
I think Inspector Clouseau had better start looking to his laurels.
What? You mean...
The board meets at 2:00 this afternoon.
This afternoon?
If everything goes as I expect it to, you'll be out of here this afternoon.
- Thank you.
- See you at 2:00.
Clouseau!
Now, now, Doctor.
Some people would consider your methods most unorthodox.
I was just making sure that you're not a better liar than I am a psychiatrist.
Come along. Good.
How.
Help!
Grab hold of this.
Pull. Pull on this.
Help!
Out with the bad air, in with the good.
Out, in.
- Don't look, Fiona!
- Out, out.
And now the kiss of life.
Pervert!
Dirty old men!
Please, there is no need to thank me.
- Thank you?
- For saving your life.
Someone...
I was hit on the head.
Yes, you have received a bump upon the head.
- "Beump"?
- What?
- You said "beump."
- Yes, I know that.
It is a large bump.
You could receive a concussion from such a bump.
- Allow me to assist you.
- No!
I'm all right. I'm fine.
Never better.
Just a little shaky.
Probably the shock of...
I mean, the surprise of seeing you here again today.
Well, I received a report... from the sanity commission... that they were going to review your case today... so I thought a few words from me on your behalf...
Oh, God...
I mean, how generous of you, but...
Well, I'm not without influence, you know.
Yes, I know that.
Yes, I have become a rather important official... in the department.
I've heard you are the new chief inspector.
Yes.
Yes, we made quite a few changes since you went crazy.
For the better, I'm sure.
By the way, Sergeant Chevalier sends you his kind regards.
Oh, Sergeant Chevalier.
Good old Sergeant Chevalier.
How is he, anyway?
Well, you know, there are leaders and there are followers... and I'm afraid Sergeant Chevalier will always be a follower, no?
Oh, yes.
And you, my friend Clouseau... a leader, huh?
Always a leader?
Onwards and upwards to the top, hmm?
- It is my karma.
- What?
- My destiny.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, a few more years on the force... and I might even be persuaded to run for the public office.
You can count on my vote.
And you, my friend, can count on me... to do everything in my power to get you out of this place.
Oh, yes. I know how you feel.
My hat. Well...
Are you all right, former Chief Inspector?
Yes!
Yes, I'm perfectly all right.
See?
One moment, and I will have you extracted.
I'm fine. I am perfect.
Every day, and in every way...
I'm getting better and better.
Somewhere over the rainbow
I'm afraid that this is just not your day, my friend.
But it is my day.
It is, my friend.
After three long terrible years... it is at last my day.
I will not permit... repeat... not permit anything... repeat... anything to spoil it.
Now, I will walk you to the gate... and I will kiss you good-bye... and you will drive off in your new car... which should rightfully be mine... and then I will have my interview with the sanity commission.
And they will set me free, and then...
I will kill you.
- Kill you!
- Francois!
Start the car!
Kill!
I'll kill him!
I want to kill him!
I've got to kill him.
Oh, allow me.
Cato?
Forty winks.
It's the phone.
The phone is ringing.
Relax. I'll get it.
This is Chief Inspector Clouseau's residence.
This is Chief Inspector Clouseau... speaking on the phone.
What? Oh, put him on.
Good evening, Commissioner.
How are you? How is Madame and all the little commissioners?
I see.
Well, you can rest assured... that I shall take every precaution that is necessary.
Thank you, Commissioner, and good evening.
I have just received word that former Chief Inspector Dreyfus... has escaped from the insane asylum.
For some reason, the deputy commissioner... thinks that he might try to kill me.
Obviously, the poor man is crazier than anyone gives him credit for.
Nevertheless, I am ordered to take every precaution.
See that the back and front doors are locked... while I slip into my new hunchback disguise.
Both doors are locked now.
Who are you?
What have you done with Inspector Clouseau?
Chief Inspector Clouseau.
Fooled you, didn't I?
Oh, Chief Inspector, that is fantastic.
If you think this is fantastic... wait till you see the full effect with the hump.
The bells!
They deafen me!
Chief Inspector Clouseau?
Yes, this is
Chief Inspector Clouseau.
Who is speaking?
My name is Duval.
Claude Duval.
I have the honor to be chairman... of the Jacques Clouseau presentation committee.
The presentation committee?
For me?
For what purpose, may I ask?
For what purpose, you ask.
How modest of you.
The purpose, monsieur, is to honor... one of the city's most dedicated... brave and selfless public servants.
You are most generous, monsieur.
Most.
Yes, I must admit I have often wondered, considering my years on the force... and my numerous accomplishments, why recognition was not forthcoming earlier.
Absolutely right.
Nine years faithful service at the Sûreté... and not as much as a single decoration in all that time.
Yes, that is quite correct.
However, as you are no doubt aware...
I have recently received an important promotion.
Really?
I have replaced the lunatic Dreyfus as chief inspector.
I know, and I'm sure Paris sleeps the more safely because of the change.
You're very most kind.
But I can assure you when it comes to matters of keeping the peace...
I'm always on my toes.
Chief Inspector.
One moment, please.
Can't you see that I'm on the phone?
Oh, yes, Commissioner.
Fortunately, there was sufficient air still left in my hump... to keep me afloat until the rescue.
Yes. Well, thank you very much,
Commissioner. Good-bye.
That was the commissioner.
He was most concerned.
Well, you have been very, very lucky, you know.
Yes, I know. Poor Cato will be in the hospital for weeks.
Do you know what kind of a bomb it was?
The exploding kind.
Mark my words, Francois.
Sinister forces are at work.
And this mad bomber must be apprehended at all costs.
Make sure you issue an all-points bulletin immediately.
- Yes, sir.
- What about my clothes?
Oh, Sergeant Chauvin is rounding some up for you.
While you're waiting, perhaps you'll sign the order... to transport Jean Tournier to prison.
Tournier the bank robber?
I shall be happy to sign that order.
Ah, it's life for you this time, Tournier.
At last, we are rid of you.
I have to go to the toilet.
All right.
Thank you.
All right, Tournier.
That's long enough.
Now this is my plan.
Step number one:
I will recruit the world's greatest criminal minds. Step number two:
I will build an organization so sinister, so powerful... by comparison, the Cosa Nostra will seem like the Vienna Boys Choir.
- Here is the list.
- But half of these men are in prison.
- We'll get them out.
- Impossible.
I'll bet you 20 million francs it isn't.
- Where would I get 20 million francs?
- I thought you'd ask that.
Step number three: Next Thursday at precisely 2:00 p.m... you and six men will enter the main branch of the Paris credit bank.
This afternoon, at approximately five minutes to 5:00... three men dressed in building maintenance uniforms... entered and robbed the Paris credit bank.
The leader has been identified as Jean Tournier.
How much did they get?
Millions. Here's the report.
All right. That will be all,
Francois. Thank you.
Twenty million francs.
And now, the next step.
Hugo Fassbender and his daughter have been kidnapped.
- Professor Fassbender?
- Yes. Paris has a theory.
They're sending over their top man... a Chief Inspector Clouseau.
He just sent this telegram. "Arrived
Gatwick Airport, B.R. 121, 12:38 p.m."
Yes? Who are you?
- Jarvis, sir.
- And what is it you do?
- I am the butler.
- Ah, the butler. Yes, yes.
Can you tell me where you were on the night of the kidnapping?
- Asleep in my room, sir.
- Asleep in your room.
- Can you prove that?
- No.
Make a note of that,
Sergeant Yard.
Tell the staff to assemble in the drawing room.
I will interview them in a few moments.
Yes, sir.
- What was your name again?
- Jarvis.
Jarvis, that's right. Perhaps you'll be kind enough to show me around the house.
Very good, sir.
I suggest we start with the upstairs.
- This is the upstairs, sir.
- Yes, I know that.
This is a door.
Yes, that is a door.
- Yes, I know that.
- It's not locked, sir.
Obviously.
Stay where you are.
I prefer to handle this alone.
Is there anybody hiding there in the dark?
Nothing like a good warm-up when you're on a case, you know?
Tell me, which switch did you use to turn on the lights?
The light switch, sir.
Strange. It didn't work for me.
Yes.
Unless I miss my guess, this would be the gymnasium room.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. It is a good room.
Yes.
This reminds me of my younger days at the Sûreté police academy.
The parallel bars... my speciality.
I was something of an athlete, you know. Yes, yes.
I was known as the Pavlova of the parallels.
Oh, yes.
Yes, it's all coming back now.
Yes, I remember it...
Well, that felt good!
Well, now. I expect you're all wondering why I asked you here.
It's obvious that the knight that wore that suit... did not last very long.
Yes, yes. I know.
Now.
Yes. As I was saying...
You were saying you supposed we were all wondering why you called us.
Look. There is no need for you to speak unless I ask you a question.
- What is your name?
- I'm Shork, the gardener.
- And what is it you do?
- I'm the gardener.
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
- I did.
- Don't be funny with me, monsieur.
This is a very serious matter... and everyone in this room is under the suspicions.
- "Reum"?
- What? What was that?
- You said, "Reum."
- Yes, I know that.
And there is a very good chance that someone in this room... knows more about the murder than he is telling.
- Murder?
- What was that you said?
- I said murder.
- What murder?
Well, I don't know.
You said murder.
I said murder?
You said murder!
No, I said murder because you said murder!
- I said murder?
- You said someone in this room... knows more about the murder than he's telling.
Now listen...
- What was your name?
- Shork.
- The cook.
- Gardener.
Now we are getting somewhere.
You...
Oh, dear!
Are you all right,
Mr. Stutterstutt?
- Who is this man?
- He's Mr. Stutterstutt.
I see, and what is your job,
Mr. Stuckerstuff?
He's the beekeeper.
I'm not asking you.
I'm asking Mr. Stuffsucker.
What's that? What is he saying to you?
What? What was that?
He says he's got a bit of a cold, and he's lost his voice.
Lost his voice. A beekeeper who has lost his voice... a cook who thinks he's a gardener... and a witness to a murder.
Oh, yes. It is obvious to my trained eye... that there is much more going on here... than meets the ear.
Before you are dismissed,
Mr. Stiffsticker...
I suggest you count your bees.
You may find that one of them is missing.
You ruined that piano!
What is the price of one piano... compared to the terrible crime that has been committed here?
But that's a priceless Steinway!
Not anymore. What is your name?
Mrs. Leverlilly.
Mrs. Loveliver.
I would take a shrewd guess... that you are the housekeeper, right?
I have been with Professor Fassbender for 30 years.
That would account for your exaggerated hysteria... over a simple blemish on the furniture.
Blemish!
Whatever has happened to the piano can easily be repaired.
What has happened to Professor Fassbender... and his daughter is another matter.
And it is my job to bring the guilty party, or parties, to their justice.
Now, then, what do we know?
One: That Professor Fassbender... and his daughter have been kidnapped.
Two: Someone has kidnapped them.
Three: My hand is on fire.
Drummond, what's going on?
Good afternoon, sir.
Inspector Clouseau has been interrogating the staff.
Inspector Clouseau,
Superintendent Quinlan.
Oh, Inspector.
Superintendent.
Why don't you just tell Potters that he's incompetent... and request that he be taken off the case?
Because we've got enough trouble with France... without suggesting that their greatest detective is a fool.
Steady.
Where is he now?
He is shadowing the Fassbender farm.
Hello, sailor.
- Yes?
- Who are you?
Chuck. Who are you?
What's that?
I am Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau of the Sûreté.
- How exciting.
- I think I will just take a look around.
Yes. Well, you'll have to make use of the bar first or take a table.
- The show starts in a few minutes.
- In that case, I will take the table.
Right. Follow me, Jock.
- Jacques.
- Jack?
Ladies and gentlemen, once again... it is my profound pleasure to introduce... the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis!
What's a queen
Without a castle
You're right
No queen at all
And you'd be right again to say
The winter's day
Is cold
Till you
Come
Until you love me
I always will be wanting
This need I need
Can come from only
You
Until you love me
I'll live a life of longing
For that's the next best thing
I can do
No way of knowing
Which way you're heart is going
To go
I don't think you know
Take as long as it takes
Your love
To grow
Until you love me
Not one dream can come true
In all my dreams
There is a place
For you
And so I'll keep those dreams
Until
You love me
Too
Why is it that this afternoon you are Jarvis, the Fassbender butler... and tonight, you are...
- Inspector, before you get all...
- Madame or monsieur, I must warn you.
You had better watch your step.
- Something wrong, Ainsley?
- Of course not, Bruno.
No, the inspector was just warning me that I had to watch my step.
You see, back in France, he's known as king of the tango.
- Tango?
- Oh, I'd love to.
- The kidnappers are here.
- Kidnappers?
Okay. Let's go.
You want to call Paris now?
Look at it this way.
It can't possibly get any worse.
Professor Fassbender!
What an honor to have you and your charming daughter as my guests.
- Who the devil are you?
- Ah, yes. Who the devil, indeed.
Come. Sit down.
Let us just say for the moment... that I'm your host and that I will do everything in my power... to make your stay here at Mondschein
Castle as pleasant as possible.
Providing, of course... that you reciprocate by giving me something that I very much want.
And that would be?
I am fascinated by your work on time-space relationships... particularly the vortices of electromagnetic aberrations.
I see.
And do you work for a particular government... or do you expect to sell my discovery to the highest bidder?
Neither, Professor.
Nothing so mundane.
You and I... we're going to join forces, Professor.
We're going to build the Doomsday
Machine and conquer the world.
- Have a sweet.
- You're mad.
Mad? On the contrary... every day, in every way...
I've been getting better and better.
Mad? Was Hannibal mad?
Or Alexander? Surely Napoleon was the maddest of them all. Mad?
We shall see, Professor.
- I shall tell you nothing.
- I think you will.
I'll die first.
Show Miss Fassbender to the schoolroom.
Daddy?
What are you going to do?
Something so very, very painful, so hideous... your father will have no choice but to cooperate.
All right.
I'll tell you anything.
The Wolverines certainly have to put some points on the scoreboard.
I'm sure that Green will come out throwing.
He's got to get that ball down deep into Navy territory.
Green now on third down.
Looks to the left, throws it...
All right, team! Let's go!
Throw's complete to Rhodes!
He's inside the 15! He's to the 20!
The clock is running down.
Can the Wolverines do it?
- What happened?
- Where's the game?
- Who is that?
- Hello there.
- He's on every station.
- Well, call the F.C.C.
Hold it! He's saying something.
Mr. President, everybody, calm down.
Calm down, hell!
This is an emergen...
An emergency.
Did Michigan score?
Please, let's hear what the fellow has to say.
It is little enough to ask... the life of one man... against a holocaust... that could destroy the globe.
What the hell's he talking about?
Quiet.
That's why I say again... give me Clouseau.
- And we can all sleep secure in bed.
- What's a Clouseau?
And so, next week...
I shall give the world a demonstration of the awesome power I hold.
On Saturday, October 9th... at precisely 3:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time... the United Nations building...
Will vanish from the face of the earth.
And the gun goes off.
The game is over.
Call the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Pentagon.
Find out who won the game!
That's a photograph taken by an American news photographer... while the broadcast was in progress.
Paris has identified him as one Charles Dreyfus... former chief inspector of the Sûreté.
- You're joking.
- And more recently an inmate... at the state facility for the criminally insane.
Until he escaped.
Here's a text of his speech.
He obviously controls equipment... sophisticated enough to pirate the satellite.
"Give me Clouseau, and we can all sleep secure in our beds."
Thought that might interest you.
That's one crazy chief inspector talking about another crazy chief inspector.
What does he mean anyway?
"Give me Clouseau."
Listen to this. "Little enough to ask the life of one man... against a holocaust that could destroy the globe."
You missed the best bit. Look.
He also threatens to make the U.N. building disappear.
- Operation Looking Glass?
- Fassbender.
Give me Lovell. Home Office.
- Where's Clouseau?
- I've no idea.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, once again... the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis.
Monsieur Jarvis?
- Sir, the coroner's report.
- Ah, yes.
It's amazing. Even after he had been stabbed twice... he was still able to break the kidnapper's neck.
- Ah, pity.
- Yes, he had a lovely voice.
I meant pity that the kidnapper's dead.
We might have got something from him.
- I did get something out of him.
- What?
What's that?
- A clue.
- Clue?
- What?
- You said a clue.
Yes. A brochure clue... advertising the Oktoberfest in Munich.
It begins the day after tomorrow.
And you think the dead man was planning to go there, perhaps to meet someone?
Yes. Perhaps to meet... the lunatic Dreyfus.
At one time, partners in the war against crime... now archenemies.
- You'll need help.
- I prefer to do this alone.
Yes, but if Dreyfus is what we suspect, he probably has an army behind him.
Of course it won't be easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is.
That is why I have always failed where others have succeeded.
For me, the greater the odds, the greater the challenge.
And, as always,
I accept the challenge.
Well, I am off to Munich.
Most ingenious.
The old closet ploy.
I really must congratulate you.
If there's one thing I do enjoy... it's a good closet ploy.
Well, until we meet again and the case is solved.
The case is solved.
Four minutes.
We're gonna look like a bunch of Dipsy Doodles if this is a hoax.
Well... we would look very foolish if we didn't take every precaution... and it turned out not to be a hoax.
Dr. Fassbender and Operation Looking
Glass are certainly no hoax.
God. A weapon like that in the hands of a crazy Frenchman.
You are certain?
You can do it?
- Theoretically, yes.
- For your daughter's sake, I hope so.
Ah, the dreams I had.
All the terrible things I was going to do to that sweet child if you failed.
- Look, I've done everything you asked.
- Not yet.
When the U.N. building vanishes... then you will have done everything
I asked.
What do you suppose they will call the crater?
The Dreyfus Ditch!
- There should be no crater.
- No crater?
But I want a crater.
I want wreckage, twisted metal.
Something the world will not forget.
- They will not forget today.
- They won't? Wonderful.
I have to tinkle again.
Don't do anything till I get back.
Too late. The countdown started.
One minute.
Thirty seconds.
Seven, six... five, four... three, two, one!
Ignition!
Today... the U.N. building.
Tomorrow, who knows?
I think by now that the nations of the world are aware of the... the awesome power which I control... a power so great... if I choose,
I could wipe out an entire city.
After all, what is the life of a man... compared to the destruction of a whole city?
I give you seven days.
Seven days.
Okay.
Well done.
So, now we wait.
All this to get one cop?
But we have some of the finest hit men here in Europe.
- In this very room.
- Why don't we take care of it ourselves?
- Because you wouldn't stand a chance.
- Come on.
- You don't know Clouseau.
- He can't be that good.
Good? He's not good.
He's terrible.
He's the worst.
There is not any man like him anywhere in the world.
Compared to Clouseau, this Doomsday Machine... is just a water pistol.
That's why it will take all the great nations... with all of their trained assassins... and all of their sophisticated murder weapons... to eliminate Clouseau.
Taxi, please.
This gentleman...
- What are you doing?
- That's my case.
Lucky for you, I am in a hurry.
Otherwise you would have been arrested.
And when it comes to the matter of eliminating Clouseau... nobody wants to have anybody else get the credit for it.
It's a matter of national pride.
I think we all agree, Mr. President, that we simply cannot afford... to allow any other country to get hold of Fassbender's machine.
Crazy or not, anyone who has gone to the lengths that Dreyfus has... in order to eliminate one man... it's reasonable to assume... that Dreyfus will smile very kindly... on the one who eliminates
Inspector Clouseau.
I think that's pretty far-fetched.
Mr. President, if I told you one week ago... that the U.N. building would disappear... and that a certified lunatic would blackmail the entire...
You made your point.
What do we do?
Well, Mr. President,
Clouseau is in Munich.
I ordered one of our top people to Munich yesterday.
- Yesterday?
- Well, just in case.
He's just reported in.
Clouseau has gone to the Oktoberfest.
I wonder if we have enough time before the others act.
Germany's already acted, and bungled it.
According to the latest code transmission... twelve countries have got their top assassins in Munich... and they're all converging on the Oktoberfest.
My God, it will be like a shooting gallery.
Try one of my pretzels.
They're good.
What are you doing to this poor, motherless child?
You great big bully.
There, there, little boy.
Sir.
- I better call the President.
- You know what time it is?
He wants me to call.
Put me in, Coach.
What's the score?
Yes!
It's okay. How many?
Twenty-six, Mr. President.
Holy cow. No wonder Dreyfus wants that Clouseau killed.
He's a one-man army.
Who's left?
Just the Russian and the Egyptian.
My key, please.
127, please.
Good evening,
Inspector Clouseau.
I couldn't sleep, and I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
I hope you don't mind.
You Frenchmen are so romantic.
Thank heaven
For little girls
Swine maid.
Oh, forgive me, darling.
I've just washed my hands.
They must have been freezing.
Freezing? Yes.
Something wrong?
Wrong? Oh, no.
What could be wrong?
Then come back to bed.
Yes, of course.
Into the bed, you know.
And take off those so-silly pajamas.
You may rest assured you will never see these so-silly pajamas again.
That I can assure you.
Darling?
Yes, I won't be a moment... darling.
Hurry, darling.
I'm just going to take a bath.
A bath?
Excuse me.
Yes.
Hello, this is
Chief Inspector Clouseau.
There is a beautiful woman in my bed and a dead man in my bath.
If you're going to take a bath,
I want to take one with you.
Darling, it's freezing out here.
Let me in.
Madame...
I arrest you for the murder of the man in this bathtub.
What?
And I must warn you that anything you say will be taken down... and used in evidence against me... you.
Who is he?
I don't know.
He looks familiar.
- He looks like you.
- Looks like me?
Tournier, the bank robber.
What is he doing in your bathtub dressed up like you?
It is a question
I could very easily ask you.
But he has been shot... and I do not carry a gun.
Obviously not, no.
I am Olga Berriossiva.
Until one hour ago,
I was a loyal Russian agent... under direct order from the presidium to kill you.
To kill me?
I was considered a perfect liquidator... because no man had ever been able to involve me emotionally... until tonight.
Do you think that you could fall in love... with an ex-Russian agent?
Well, of course... everything is possible, yes.
- But you are not the same.
- Huh?
Oh, well, of course... dead men in bathtubs have been known... to make quite a difference, you know.
Anyway, this is the man who can lead me to the lunatic Dreyfus... who it is my sworn duty to apprehend.
I, too, had a sworn duty, but I have forsaken it... become traitor, given up everything for you.
With me... it is the duty that comes first.
Oh, make an exception just this once.
I wish that I could.
You can. I guarantee it.
No, you see, I...
- Look!
- What?
That tattoo. When I arrested Tournier, he did not have that tattoo.
- It looks like the Mondschein crest.
- Mondschein?
- Mm-hmm.
- What is that?
An infamous family who ruled Bavaria in the 15th century.
I read somewhere that the Mondschein Castle... had recently been sold.
You read somewhere that... they had sold the castle?
Fancy them selling the castle, just like that.
The castle!
Yes. Dreyfus.
He is in the castle.
Farewell. I am off to Mondschein Castle.
Must be getting a cavity.
When can my daughter and I leave?
When Clouseau is no more, perhaps.
I have done everything you asked.
You've done everything I've asked so far... but I have not asked everything.
What you mean is that you have no intention of letting us go.
You plan to continue your reign of terror... whether Clouseau is eliminated or not.
I must admit the thought had occurred to me.
- You are mad.
- And you are redundant, Professor.
Redundant and fallacious.
Madness does not preclude achievement.
You cannot operate the machine without me.
Not yet, but when you have taught me.
And if I refuse to teach you?
Then I would have to take the matter up with your charming daughter.
- What kind of a man are you?
- A madman.
- You said so yourself.
- Boss!
It's true.
- When?
- This morning, in his hotel room.
He's dead!
He's dead in his hotel bedroom!
Hurray! I'm free!
Oh, I'm so happy, Professor.
I'm so...
Good day.
My name is Professor Guy Gabroir... medieval castle authority from Marseilles.
Tell me, do you have a room?
I do not know what a "reum" is.
Ah! A room!
That is what I have been saying, you idiot.
Room.
Does your dog bite?
Nice doggy.
I thought you said your dog did not bite.
That is not my dog.
Anything I can get you, boss?
I can't stand it any longer.
Get me a dentist!
Dr. Shurtz lives here... but he has gone fishing.
I don't know.
I will tell him.
Did I hear you say a doctor lives here?
He's a doctor and a dentist.
He made mein teeth for me.
They want him up at the castle.
Up at the castle?
Where can I find him?
Dr. Shurtz has gone fishing.
- He probably won't be back until...
- Show me his zimmer.
- Hmm?
- His room!
Hello!
It's Dr. Shurtz from the village, you know.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
- Dr. Shurtz is here.
- Where?
Ah, here, Doctor.
Please hurry.
I am in agony.
All will be well soon.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Yes.
The burn.
I can set it later.
- Please hurry.
- First of all, I will need... some hot water and towels.
Get some hot water, Harry, and lock the door.
- I don't want to be disturbed.
- And lock the door, Harry.
He does not wish to be disturbed, you know.
Please, Doctor, hurry.
I can't stand the pain.
Yes. Now, then let me see.
- Ow.
- What?
- My eye.
- I thought it was your tooth.
- But it is my tooth.
- I wish you would make your mind up.
I don't normally make castle calls in the middle of the night.
Doctor.
Wait while I...
Yes, that's...
There it is.
Now, open wide, please.
Now, let me see.
Tell me when this hurts.
Is it that one?
Is it that one?
Ah, there is the naughty one.
- Are you going to pull it?
- Pull it?
Yes, of course I will pull it.
Please give me something to put me out.
Put you out?
Yes. Here, first you must wear... this special anesthetic cotton wool, you know.
Wear it over the eyes.
On no account look out from under it.
That will ruin the whole effect of the anesthetic on the eyes.
- You want me to hold it like that?
- Hold it like that on the eyes... while I get some...
Please hurry, Doctor.
I can't stand the pain.
Yes. Coming soon.
What are you doing?
Just rearranging the furniture... in order to give you the full effect of the anesthetic.
Doctor, I'm in agony!
Not for much longer.
That was hell down there.
What's wrong?
Whoever built this house put the stairs in the wrong place.
Do you mean you fell down the stairs?
I was preoccupied with the anesthetic, you know.
It's really hot in here, isn't it?
Now, the... anesthetic.
"Nitrous oxide."
What's that?
That is the anesthetic, you know.
Oh, good.
Yes, it is good, yes.
Please, Doctor, the pain is getting worse.
Please, hurry up.
A few whiffs of this, and you won't feel a thing.
- All right.
- Now, breathe deeply.
- How's that?
- It's fine.
How do you feel?
A little dizzy.
- What's so funny?
- I don't know. Nothing.
- Then why are you laughing?
- I don't know.
- Why are you laughing?
- Because I can't help it.
Yes.
I love it.
- Come on.
- It's gonna hurt.
Good. Lovely.
I will have to use more leverage.
I don't know what you gave me,
Doctor... but it's giving me hallucinations.
Your whole face has changed.
It has?
How's this?
Grotesque!
We just got word, boss.
Clouseau is still alive.
I knew it.
He has pulled the wrong tooth.
There's only one man who would pull the wrong tooth.
It's Clouseau.
Kill him.
Get Fassbender and his daughter into the control room.
What about Clouseau?
Priorities.
First I will pick a target.
Then Clouseau.
Now we'll see who has the last laugh.
They've all betrayed me, and now they will have to pay.
What shall I destroy?
Buckingham Palace? Too small.
How about London?
Not big enough.
England! Yes, England.
Good-bye, Piccadilly
Farewell, Leicester Square
You are just in time,
Professor.
Within five minutes,
I shall destroy England.
England!
No more cricket.
No more warm beer, Professor.
No more fish and chips.
No more...
England!
Do something.
You brought it on yourself.
It's too late.
Wait!
Do something!
Come back! Help me!
Look!
You've gotta help me.
Help, Professor!
Cato, my little yellow friend,
I'm home.
I gave Cato the night off.
But what has happened to my room?
Darling?
My darling.
Darling, sing to me.
Sing to you? Oh.
Come to me
And the world
It will be ours tonight
Where did you go?
- Your voice?
- Yes, that was my voice.
That was my voice singing a little song we used to sing... in the Resistance to keep up the courage.
Was it hard for you in the Resistance?
Very hard, but not as hard as it is now.
Darling, relax.
Resistance is over.
My darling.
My beautiful darling.
What?
I sit here and I can't believe
that it happened.
And yet I have to believe it.
Dreams or nightmares.
Madness or sanity,
I don't know which is which.
I'll just take a minute!
Don't worry, the farm will be great for her.
Apartment was beginning to scare me, too.
For the first time in months, I'm free.
Forget the doctors.
Forget that place.
I'm okay now.
We'll start over.
Hey, Jess!
Come on, we gotta get moving!
Don't tell them, act normal.
Find anything good?
It's great.
What's it say?
"Frail as the leaves that shiver on a spray.
"Like them we flourish,
"like them, decay."
See?
You're less frightened already.
Cast off!
What have we got in the case?
My mother-in-law.
I wished it was mine.
Where you folks going?
Other side of Brookfield.
It's a farm on Cove Road called the Old Bishop Place.
Do you know it?
Yes, I do.
Well, we'll be on the other side very soon.
This is your new hometown, Jessica.
Was that it? Wait, wait!
Can we go around again?
Okay. Waltz us around again, Woody.
Don't blink or you're gonna miss it.
- Look what they're driving.
- Damn hippies.
Creeps.
Some welcoming committee.
I think maybe it's our mode of transportation.
Look at those bandages. I think these guys are left over from the Civil War.
It's cheaper than a station wagon.
Good riddance.
Oh, God, it's fantastic!
The...
I'm so excited.
The stuff for supper is on top and the bedding and the sheets like that are all in the very front.
Woman's work is never done.
Jessica, why have you come here?
Get it open?
You okay?
Don't tell them. They won't believe you.
Yes.
Well, let's go in.
Do you like it?
What's wrong?
It's okay, Jess. I saw it, too.
- What's the matter?
- Someone's upstairs.
No kidding? That's great, eh?
Stay here.
I really did see something.
I believe you.
We know you're in here, now come out.
That's the girl!
Hold it!
What are you doing here?
I mean, I'm sorry if we frightened you but you just scared the hell out of us.
Oh, that's all right.
Who are you?
This place belongs to me now.
I just found this place and I thought it was abandoned, so I just sort of moved in.
Then I saw this hearse coming up the drive.
We must've scared you as much as you scared us.
Well, I'll get my things.
And let's get the rest of the stuff, Woody.
- Woody?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Is this your room?
- Yes.
I mean no.
Where will you go?
Town?
Sounds good enough for me.
You don't care where you go?
Do you?
Well...
Yes. I think I do now.
Have you any transportation?
Well, how will you get to town?
It's a couple of miles, isn't it?
Look, why don't you stay and have dinner with us and spend the night?
Oh, thanks. I guess I'll keep moving.
Please do. We have plenty and we can drive you into town in the morning.
Please.
Please.
Stay.
Well, why not?
Good.
I'm Jessica.
Hi. I'm Emily.
- That's far enough.
- It better be.
That's great.
You go to school?
I went and then I dropped.
Then I went again.
And if I like it around here,
I plan to drop again.
I probably should go back to school but I don't know why.
What do I need a degree for?
But don't you live somewhere?
Oh yeah, sure, but...
I haven't been there for a long time and I'm not sure
I'm ready to go back yet.
Nice.
Do you play?
No. I can't even carry a tune.
Stay forever
My love
My love
We're together
My love
My love
Leave the world
You know about
And stay with me
My love
Stay forever
My love
My love
We're together
My love
He likes her.
Leave the world
You know about
It's blood, Jessica, it's blood.
It's blood.
Blood, blood.
Wow!
He's terrific!
I mean, really.
He's an important man.
He was with the Philharmonic.
Are you gonna play somewhere around here?
No, he's gonna farm, raise apples, have a garden, get back to nature.
He's a nut.
I'm the nut.
Coffee is being served in our living room.
Great to have a fire.
Didn't you have a fireplace in New York?
New York?
Have you ever been to New York?
No. I've always wanted to go there.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
- It's a mad city.
- Gosh, it's...
How long have you been here?
Ages.
Did you ever get Ionely?
Oh, sure. Sure.
But sometimes it's not Ionely.
Sometimes
I hear things.
Like, you know, when I'm alone and it's very quiet, like now.
You can let your imagination go and listen to the stillness and watch it get dark, and the shadows come to life.
You know what I mean?
Have you ever had anything like that happen to you?
Well...
Yes.
Like, like what?
Like...
Once, I was going to your concert and I was afraid I was gonna be late, and I was very exhausted around that time because my father had just passed away.
And
I woke up, and suddenly I saw my father.
And I heard his voice.
He was calling to me.
"Jessica."
It was probably me begging for her to be on time.
For a change.
Let's have a s饌nce.
Why not? Don't you believe in spirits?
Nothing's ever completely dead.
Right. I even hear the Twist is coming back.
I'm calling on the spirits of everyone who ever died in this house.
If you're present, give us a sign.
Give us a sign.
All the dead, come to us.
Me? Oh, I can't.
Call them.
I'm calling on all the spirits of everyone who's ever died in this house.
I'm calling on all the spirits of everyone who's ever died in this house.
Give us a sign.
Give us a sign.
I'm here, Jessica.
Jessica, I'm here.
Come to us.
A toast to my bride, Abigail,
and to all the Bishops.
Abigail.
My Abigail.
Oh, God, it's sad.
We gave a s饌nce and nobody came.
- I guess we'll say good night.
- All right.
- Good night, Woody, old pal.
- Good night.
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.
Gee, that really, you know, got to me.
"Sacred to the memory of Venture Smith, an African.
"Though the son of a king,
"he was kidnapped and sold as a slave.
"But by his industry,
"he acquired money to purchase his freedom."
That's our motto, that's like us.
"Died, September 10th, 1805,
"in the 77th year of his life."
Venture.
Oh, aren't they beautiful?
In memory of...
Anyway, who's left to remember them?
Angel faces.
They look so merciless.
Hey, honey, come on.
Jess, come on.
You really believe in that kind of stuff?
I don't know.
You believe in that kind of stuff?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
I guess it's just been a long time.
And I don't know you yet.
Things like that.
Take me for a walk.
Your friend Jessica seems
- unhappy.
- No.
No, no, she's okay.
She was away for six months.
Got back a couple of weeks ago, better.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You're very beautiful.
Thank you.
I guess we've all moved around, we're all running from something.
That's why they have this place.
Duncan blew his savings for it.
He's broke now.
We're going to have to sell some stuff to get money to live on.
Are you going to live here, too?
I don't know yet. They asked me to.
I'll stick around and help Dunc get started with the work in the orchard.
Then who knows? I'll probably move on.
We're all kind of wandering spirits, you know?
I guess so.
Don't be in such a hurry.
Don't worry,
I won't go away.
I'm coming to get you!
I'm coming to get you!
Give me some soap.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Do my back.
There you go, ma'am.
Great!
This is great!
- One scrub girl needed immediately.
- This is my ancient Finnish method.
Oh, good! Oh, that feels good.
Okay, let's switch.
Isn't this the life?
Don't you feel happy?
That's nice.
Oh, that feels great.
Okay, I'm finished.
- Where to?
- I'll go fix lunch.
Oh, no. Wait, I'll do it.
No, no, stay, swim.
I have to pack anyway.
Okay, thanks.
Well, I'm going in for another little swim.
- Wanna come? Anybody wanna come?
- You swim, we'll watch.
Lazy.
Jessica.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Dunc!
Oh, God!
Jess, what's the matter?
Out there. In the water.
- I was swimming in the cove.
- It's okay, it's all right.
There was this thing.
And it touched me.
Thing? What thing?
I don't know, but it was white.
It was kind of awful, like a kind of shark.
- Jessica...
- Believe me, please.
That's nonsense.
Jessica, there is nothing in this cove.
Look!
- No, no, no.
- Well, look at it.
We'll get you dry. We'll get you dry.
Jess, look! Look! There's nothing here!
Now he thinks I'm getting sick again.
But I'm not.
Liar, liar. Liar, liar.
Well, if we hope to find anything around this place that we can sell in town, we'd better start looking for it.
No money, no food.
So let's go.
It's you.
Are you ready?
Can't we keep this, Duncan?
Put it in.
You're going to sell this?
- Yeah.
- We hope so.
But they're people. They have history.
You can't just sell them like an old car.
People who sell old cars.
Let's go, Jessica.
Okay.
Hop in, Emily.
I thought you said you wouldn't go away.
Did you believe me?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
- Let's ask her to stay.
- You want to?
All right.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, we'd like to ask you to stay.
I'll unpack your stuff.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Glad to have you.
I won't go away, Jessica.
I'll never go away.
Do you find her attractive?
Who? Emily?
Right.
Yeah.
Hello?
Can you sell me some eggs?
Come on down here and get them.
I'm looking for some place to sell antiques, like lamps and a table.
If there was a place,
I sure wouldn't tell you.
Do you mind?
Hey, watch it!
What happened?
They probably get back in their cages after dark.
What a bunch of weirdoes.
Duncan, why are they all bandaged?
You know, the chicken farmer had something, too.
On his neck.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Anything special you're looking for?
I'm Sam Dorker.
- Hi.
- Sam.
Hi, Sam. I'm Duncan.
This is my wife, Jessica.
- Glad to see you.
- Hello.
- Are you passing through?
- No, we just moved here.
We're new in town.
More refugees from urban blight, eh?
I had a shop up until two years ago in New York on Second Avenue.
Where?
Oh, between 52nd and 53rd.
We lived on 49th and 3rd.
- Oh, really?
- They tore the building down and...
Well, I just couldn't take it.
They built a pizza parlor next door to me.
I just couldn't stand the smell.
But I love it up here.
The air is fresh and clean.
- Oh, yeah.
- And the fishing is just great.
The man who owned the shop before me lived to be 96 so I expect to be here for some time.
Well, what can I show you?
I've got a marvelous old grandfather clock here, if you've got room for it.
It's a real steal at $375.
I'll steal it!
And at the other end of the scale...
Oh, you like that. I was just about to show you that. That's a male fiori lamp.
- Do you understand Italian?
- No.
Male fiori, that means flowers of evil.
Or evil flowers.
And they got it painted right on there.
Now, right up here
I've got some marvelous old things, real early Americana.
Got a marvelous, old deacon's bench up here.
It'll seat eight in a pinch.
That's a joke.
Mr. Dorker, we're really not interested in buying, we're selling.
Oh, well, lead on, MacDuncan.
- What've you got?
- Well, sir, I've got a couple of nice jugs, and a chair and a table.
And some bottles, a couple lamps, real nice silver frame.
Bridle, some other stuff.
Flowers of evil.
How can anything this pretty be evil?
It's just old, that's all.
When we have money again,
this is the kind of stuff
we're gonna buy for the house.
That's some very nice stuff.
Some of it. Some of it.
What about this? It's silver.
Yes, I guess so.
Very nice. Very nice piece.
But I...
What?
The Bishops.
There's no mistaking the Bishops.
Well, we bought the old Bishop place.
- Who'd you deal with, old Harold?
- No, Harold's gone to Florida.
It was an agent that showed me the place. Why?
He tell you the stories about Abigail Bishop drowning?
1880, and all that? It's quite a story.
Sam, how much do you think this stuff's worth to you?
Well, I... Let's see.
I can give you $150 for it.
And $50 more for this.
But even some of the little jewelry costs more and you said they were very nice pieces.
Well, frankly, I feel very funny about buying them.
I think I'll have some trouble trying to sell them around here.
But think what you could get for them in New York, Mr. Dorker.
Duncan, couldn't we keep this?
$250 is the best I can do.
Well, all right. Come on, we'll take it.
You know the story about the Bishops is really extraordinary.
Yeah.
Abigail never got to wear that wedding dress...
Mr. Dorker.
She drowned in the cove behind her house.
Your house, I mean.
Never found her body.
The legend is that she's still alive.
Some say she's a vampire and roams the countryside.
Mr. Dorker, we're sort of in a hurry.
Could we have the money?
Of course.
That was very rude, cutting him off.
Don't do it again.
You're making me sick by worrying about me so much.
We won't be long. I'll make dinner.
Hi, Woody!
Oh gosh, it's so beautiful.
Can we really stay?
We'll try.
Hey, don't touch that. It's poison.
- What is it?
- It's a mole.
It has no eyes?
Duncan, get a container so we can keep it, please.
Okay. I'll get a box from the house
- and I'll come back for you.
- Okay.
I'll be all right.
Just hurry before it gets away.
Okay.
It was the antique dealer.
Dead, right here.
I swear it, I saw it.
Duncan, it's true.
He was lying right here.
And there was blood!
I know what you think of me but I swear it's true.
And there was a girl.
I'm scared. Is it happening again?
Duncan, that's her!
Here, who are you?
- Why did you run?
- You see?
Tell him, tell him you led me to the body.
Tell him. Who are you?
Why have you been following me?
What do you want?
Don't push her, Jess.
Give her a chance.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Did you see a body? Did you?
Tell me what you want.
Did you see a body?
What?
You can't speak?
What's that?
She led me to the body.
- What's the matter with her?
- She knows who killed that man.
What man?
I don't know.
Did you see anybody?
Did you see someone attack somebody?
Attack? Attack.
Did you see anybody? Did you?
For God's sake, Jessica, leave her alone.
You still don't believe me.
You don't believe there's anything strange going on.
I think it's...
- It's all strange.
- You think I'm crazy?
Admit it.
Admit it.
Who's that?
There was this enormous cake that was terrorizing England.
Angel's food or devil's food?
Devil's food cake.
And it would ooze into the windows and into the doors and engulf the people.
It'd eat everything in its way.
It was traveling down the coast from Scotland.
Whenever it would come to a town or a village, it would call out.
"Here comes the cake.
"Here comes the cake."
BBC sent out...
He wants her.
He'll never believe me again.
No one will.
Did it happen?
...little old lady...
Did it happen?
...and she's got her ear to the...
Come, Jessica. Come with me, Jessica.
"Who's there? Who's there?"
And a voice comes back,
"It's not the cake!"
Duncan's mine now.
You think he loves you?
He's mine now.
I'm just... I'm kind of a little tired.
Think I'll say good night.
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
Good night, Jess.
The mole's sleepy.
Well, I'm very tired. I think I'll go up.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Take care of your wife, there.
Good night.
Good night.
You sleeping?
You know the name of that big tree out in the yard?
Jessica.
That's a maple.
I know how to tell a sugar maple.
How?
Well, see, a maple's sort of pointy in its corners.
But a sugar maple has a "u".
It's a "u" for sugar.
That's you, sugar.
Jess?
I think you should go back to New York for a while.
You could see your doctor.
- Lf you want.
- Well, yeah, but where'll we get the money?
I'd find it.
Where?
I'd find it.
Sure you would.
I just can't take it anymore, Jess.
Why don't you leave me then?
- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.
Yes, you are. Don't cry.
- Don't cry.
- No!
- Don't get excited.
- You think I'm hopeless?
- You be quiet!
- No.
- Be quiet!
- No, leave me!
- Hush! Will you be quiet?
- Leave me!
- Will you be quiet, they'll hear you!
- Leave me!
Who cares?
What are you doing?
Oh, I just thought it would be better to sleep apart tonight.
I'll go.
I'm not sleepy anyway.
Good night.
No!
No! No!
- I don't believe you.
- No!
I think that the same creature or whatever it is that killed the antique dealer killed the mole.
I know you all think I did it.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Hey, Jess, wait!
- Where are you going?
- To find a telephone.
- Be back for lunch?
- Long before.
I'm alive. I'm still alive.
Abigail never got to wear
that wedding dress.
Drowned in the cove...
I'm here. I'm here.
I was just looking at the picture.
It looks so much like you.
My Lord, it does.
Gee, how weird.
What's the matter?
Nothing, it's just that it does, it looks so very much like you.
It's an old print.
It could look like anybody.
No.
No, it's...
It's the eyes.
You're so warm.
I'm sorry you're so upset.
Jessica, come, Jessica.
My eyes, look in my eyes.
Come with me, come. Come with me.
It's so stuffy in here.
- Come on, let's go for a swim.
- Yeah.
It's stuffy.
I think you need to swim.
You need some air.
Yeah, I just don't want to get too near the cove, you know.
- Water kind of frightens me.
- Oh, sure.
If you don't want to swim, we could just lie by the water and get some sun.
Come on.
Come.
Follow me, Jessica. Follow me.
I'll put some lotion on your back.
That's good.
Oh, that's good.
That's very good, thank you.
Leave me alone, please.
Please, leave me alone.
Get away from me.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Are you all right? I was just playing.
- Please, that's all right. That's all right.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes, thank you.
You okay?
No, that's all right.
Please, it's all right,
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry.
Jessica, Jessica.
Nobody's here.
Nobody's here.
Jessica.
Come to me. This way, Jessica.
This way. This way, come.
Here, Jessica, here.
Follow, follow me. Follow, follow me.
Here, Jessica, here.
No!
Jessica, Jessica.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay, Jessica. Stay.
You're home now.
You're home now.
Jessica.
Jessica, I'm here.
I'm here.
Where's Duncan?
Where is he now?
He said he'd be back before lunch.
I want you. What have you got...
I need you.
What have you got to live for?
You want to die. Why go on?
You want to die.
You want to die. Why go on?
You want to die.
I'm still here.
I won't go away, Jessica.
I'll never go away.
You'll never get better.
I'm still here. I'm in your blood.
I'm in your blood.
Jessica, I'm here.
I'm here.
No!
What's the matter?
- Can you help me?
- Where you going?
- Town.
- Come on, get in.
Close the door.
Hello?
Emily?
Jessica?
Hi.
I thought everybody had gone.
Not everybody.
Where's Jessica?
Oh, Jessica left.
What do you mean?
I said, what do you mean?
Don't worry.
She just walked to town to find Duncan.
So, we're alone.
Yeah.
Well?
Do you like my new dress?
My new, old dress?
Yes, very much.
- You've been working in the orchard?
- Yeah.
Where are you going?
I should really wash this stuff off.
- Should you really?
- Yeah.
Is something wrong?
You.
I see what you've been doing with my friend.
I thought you liked me.
You know I do.
Do you like me now?
Yes.
Show me.
Here we are, little lady.
- Thanks.
- Take care of yourself.
Have you seen the man...
The driver of the hearse?
No.
But you must have.
It's parked right here.
No, I didn't.
The girl that led me to the body,
she was warning me.
She was warning me.
Jessie!
Jessie!
Jessie!
Honey, honey, no.
It's all right.
- You'll be okay now.
- I'm sorry.
It'll be okay now, Jess.
I'll take you home.
Come on.
Come on.
What happened?
Oh! Great.
Hurry up, it's cold.
It's not real, Jessica. It's not real.
It's not real. It's all in your mind.
It's in your mind. Duncan's mine.
Your mind. You're home now.
You're home. Duncan is mine now.
You're home now.
You're home now. He's mine now.
No!
Woody! Woody!
Woody!
Woody!
Woody!
The ferry isn't running for you.
I sit here and I can't believe
that it happened.
And yet I have to believe it.
Nightmares or dreams.
Madness or sanity,
I don't know which is which.
This is Captain Moretti to Unit 5.
Pick up Brannigan.
Use a forklift if you have to, but get him.
APB on Lieutenant James Brannigan.
Knock knock.
Breaking and entering is against the law, Brannigan.
I rang. You didn't answer.
I was working.
Doing your own engraving now?
Hey, wouldn't know old Abe without his mole.
Where's Larkin?
No serial number, no prints, can't be traced.
Nobody'll know who dumped you.
I don't spook, Brannigan.
Oh, all right.
The government wants Larkin for taxes.
The Chicago Police want him for extortion.
Cut out the dedicated cop act.
Everybody in this town knows you want Larkin.
And the grand jury finally indicts him and he disappears like a short beer.
I'll give you five seconds to tell me where.
You count.
Hey, wait a minute, wait, okay.
He left town.
- How?
- I don't know.
- Where?
- I don't know.
No, wait a minute, I don't know.
You got to believe me.
All right, cool it.
You must be getting old, Angell.
Trying to push second-rate paper like this.
Manny, this is Warehouse 17,
Polk Street,
I got a paperhanger.
Turn around, big man.
Angell, you're a real bush leaguer.
Yeah.
You know something,
I don't think it's loaded.
You dirty, lousy Mick, you got no rules.
You got no...
Are you all right?
Are you all right, Jim?
Now listen, Jim, Moretti's steaming.
He's got the whole Chicago PD looking for you.
Nice to be wanted.
You're wanted, all right.
There's an APB out on you.
Listen, Brannigan, you're dead.
There's a contract out on you.
Try explaining that to your parole officer.
Larkin's put up 25 Gs to get you knocked off.
You're gonna be walking down the street, or sleeping, or sitting on the can, and the next minute, Brannigan, you are dead! You lousy Mick, you!
Brannigan.
He's on the inside, far end of 17.
Not him.
Who?
You.
The Captain wants to see you. Now.
You got a warrant?
I don't need a warrant, Jim.
You're a public menace.
- All right.
- Get in.
It's my car.
Joe will bring your car.
Careful with the paint job.
British Airways Flight 570, nonstop 747 to London, will depart from the B Concourse.
Well, you made it.
All right, Captain, you going someplace?
No, Lieutenant. You are.
I am?
What is this, Moretti?
Passport, airline ticket and $500 expenses.
I packed a bag for you.
That is my bag.
I put everything in that was clean.
Here, don't catch a cold.
Moretti, you're gonna make somebody a nice little wife.
I'm doing you a favor, Jim.
Yeah?
Ben Larkin got out of town a couple of days ago.
I know that.
He's in London. Scotland Yard's got him.
- London?
- You got extradition papers.
Miss Allen.
I thought you might like to bring him back and personally kick him in a cell.
Miss Allen, this is Lieutenant Brannigan.
- Hi.
- She'll find a seat for you.
All right.
Just follow me, Lieutenant.
Anywhere.
Nice day.
Want to walk, Mel?
All right, you're on.
By the right.
Keep up, there.
First order of business.
Call off the wolves.
Even the elevator man looks like he's from Scotland Yard.
It may not be as simple as that.
What broke loose?
The word was in the street, Ben.
Somebody talked, somebody listened.
Chicago is sending Jim Brannigan over with extradition papers and handcuffs.
He'll be at Heathrow anytime now.
I told you I wanted that big Irish bastard wasted.
It's being taken care of, Ben.
That won't help your extradition problem.
There'll only be a dozen Chicago cops on the next flight with more papers.
Well, I'm not running. I like this town.
I like the women, the clubs, the action.
I always did.
Ben, please.
Listen to what I worked out.
Now, in Devon, at an airport nobody's used for years,
I've got a pilot who'll take you to Ireland, where you'll skip immigration and customs.
Then you head on south to Ecuador, Venezuela.
Oh, that's just great.
I end up eating bananas, listening to my arteries harden.
Ben, I'm talking to you as your lawyer.
Your friend. Not a tour guide.
The Cook County grand jury can't touch you down there.
Look, the boys will take care of you.
They have to.
They've got more skeletons than most graveyards.
And you know what closets they're hanging in.
Fields, we didn't build this organization by running from grand juries just to save our hides.
- We stick together.
- That's what I'm saying.
To the boys, you're still number one.
They'll see that you live like a king.
They'll use me as a conduit.
I'll funnel the cash to Switzerland, launder it in Panama, and ship it to you by bank drafts or letters of credit, whichever you prefer.
That's good. That's good.
You know, Mel, those bananas will taste a hell of a lot better when I know Brannigan's lying in some gutter.
It's done.
- Who you got?
- Gorman.
We used him before.
Good. He's a pro.
Enough of the walking. Let's ride.
British Airways Flight number BA 570 from Chicago now arriving at gate number 2.
Is Flight 570 in yet?
Yes, it's just arrived.
Could you make the announcement, then?
Yes.
Have a nice stay.
Thank you.
Would Mr. James Brannigan,
British Airways passenger from Chicago, please report to the British Airways information desk.
James Brannigan to British Airways information desk, please.
How long are you expecting to be with us, Mr. Gorman?
Mr. Gorman?
Oh, sorry. A week.
Business or pleasure, sir?
Strictly pleasure.
Air India Flight number Al620 for Bombay and Tokyo now boarding at gate number 8.
Lieutenant Brannigan?
Yes. How did you know?
Headquarters told me to look for someone slightly smaller than the Statue of Liberty.
Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher, sir,
Scotland Yard.
They've made some real improvements since I was last here.
Thank you. This way, sir.
Where's my man?
The prisoner, Ben Larkin.
Oh, Commander Swann is handling the extradition.
And the return-ticket reservations?
Sir Charles has taken care of that.
He's expecting you for lunch at his club, sir.
Sir Charles. Sir Charles.
I've been assigned as your driver, Lieutenant.
And to generally take care of you while you're here.
To keep an eye on me, you mean.
Well, not quite. It's more of a PR job.
Anyway, it'll make a nice change from the Vice Squad.
- Okay, sir.
- Right.
Mel, I'm the one that's going to take the heat.
Now, nothing can screw up.
Stay cool, Ben.
It's ticking like a Swiss watch.
- Morning, Mr. Larkin.
- Good to see you, Jules.
- Morning, Ben.
- Morning, boys.
Get me a box at the dog races tonight, Gates.
Oh, yeah. Call Jimmy the Bet.
And tell him to put
£400 on Triple Cross.
Ready when you are, Mr. Larkin.
Good.
You've been to England before, sir?
That's right, Miss Thatcher, during the war.
Well, I expect you'll find London's changed quite a bit.
But it's basically the same, still a very beautiful city.
If there are any places you'd like to revisit, any pubs or any...
Right now, what I'd like is about eight hours of sleep, a shower and a change of clothes.
And to get my hands in Larkin's lapels.
Yes, sir.
I sound like a bear cub with a toothache, it's just...
I understand, sir.
My father flew with the RAF.
He said there were only three things wrong with the Yanks.
Yeah?
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
I really walked into that one.
And deserved it. I'm sorry.
Might we start again, sir.
Why? We're doing fine.
I was just thinking, can I call you Jenny?
Of course.
Boy, I knew a great gal named Jenny.
She used to lend me money when I was broke.
Did she contribute any other philanthropies?
We were friends. Good friends.
Damn good friends.
- Right, Mr. Larkin.
- Hello, hello, hello.
Lie down facing this way.
- All right.
- And relax.
Excuse me, Jackson,
I've got a steam bath out there.
Well, the pool's down there, but you'll have to go outside.
I'll show you the way.
It's right around the back.
Excuse me, Tom, there's a delivery.
What? I don't know anything about a delivery.
- Neither do I.
- It's a rush order.
Where should we drop it?
Better put it out there.
Through the open door.
Grand Central Station.
Hey, muscles.
It's a bit tight here.
Can you give us a hand?
Excuse me a moment, Mr. Larkin.
Now, what's all this?
That's great.
You like that, do you?
How do you like that?
Morning, sir.
Here we are, sir. The Garrick Club.
See you later, sir.
Aren't you joining us?
If I walked in there,
I'd cause a dozen heart attacks.
It's a men's club.
Rules strictly enforced.
Too bad.
Sir?
Brannigan. Jim Brannigan to see Commander Swann.
Yes, sir. That'd be Sir Charles.
He's in the lounge bar upstairs.
Thank you.
Begging your pardon, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brannigan, it's a club rule.
Fine.
Strictly enforced, I presume.
...and that was the last I saw of her.
Excuse me.
- Lieutenant Brannigan?
- Right.
Charles Swann. Pleasant flight?
Just long.
Would you like a glass of sherry, then?
Well, actually, I'd like a boilermaker.
That's a whiskey neat, you'd say, and a beer chaser.
- Cold, if you can find it.
- Certainly, sir.
I think we can manage that.
A good old Polish drink.
Now, where do we pick up this Larkin?
Well, he's under surveillance.
Surveillance?
You come to the States for a prisoner, and we'd have him standing by handcuffed at the airport.
Yes, but you see, under our judicial system,
Mr. Larkin has the right to apply for bail.
Well, unfortunately, we have the same law.
That's how we lost him.
Rather careless, wasn't it?
I think you can rest assured that won't happen here.
Spot of lunch?
Why not?
Then we'll pick up your friend Larkin.
Should I call you Sir Charles?
Oh, I think Swann will do nicely, thank you.
I only use the Sir for theater tickets and table reservations.
May I lead the way?
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Actually, the title is a military courtesy granted to one of my ancient ancestors.
Probably for holding somebody's horse at a coronation.
- How's this?
- Thank you.
No castles or booty?
No, I'm afraid not.
But every Maundy Thursday, for some totally unaccountable reason,
I'm granted the inestimable privilege...
- Morning, Barker.
- Morning, Sir Charles.
...of dropping a sprig of myrtle in the River Thames at Westminster.
The Dover sole is excellent.
Thank you very much. Dover sole?
Commander, it's my breakfast time.
I'd sure like two over easy, some bacon crisp and a short stack.
Right. I think what my guest would like is two eggs lightly fried on either side, a couple of rashers of bacon and a modest portion of pancakes.
Not too modest on the pancakes.
- Right, sir.
- And Dover sole for me, please.
Thank you, sir.
Lieutenant, you shouldn't be wearing that particular item.
Well, a fellow at the front desk said
I had to put it on.
Not the tie, the .38 caliber Colt Diamondback.
Commander, I always wear this.
Well, I'm afraid it's placing you in violation of
British law and Scotland Yard regulations.
Well, it isn't in violation of United States law, and I work under the Chicago
Police Department regulations, which makes it obligatory.
Then I strongly urge you to resist any temptation to use it.
Well, I don't think
I'll be needing it in here.
Excuse me, Sir Charles.
Gentleman to see you at the door.
Excuse me.
Barker.
Bring the Lieutenant a whiskey and a beer chaser, will you.
You mean a boilermaker, sir.
Make it two.
What for?
Mr. Larkin has been kidnapped.
It can't happen here, huh?
Well, cheer up.
All we can lose is our jobs.
- Oh! Gorman?
- Yeah.
A friend of mine said you had a package for me.
Two questions. From where and for what?
From Chicago, to hit something.
Right on, bucko.
Half now, and half at ice time.
When he's on ice, you mean.
It's a bit light.
It's just my usual commission.
Off their end. Not mine.
Don't be difficult, friend.
Why don't you stay awhile and talk to Luana?
Nice and gentle, love, I'm not kinky.
You are what you're paid to be.
This is all that Larkin left behind at the athletic club.
We don't know that Larkin was really snatched.
Of course not.
But we do still have that masseur unconscious in hospital.
That's might be just an act.
At this particular point
I don't think that's an assumption the Yard can afford to make.
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd get some men out thumping on the streets, passing out some e pluribus unum.
That's what 90% of police work is today.
The murder rate in your country, I'm sure, gives ample testimony to your superior police methods.
Well, Commander, I didn't come over here to argue police methods.
But a certain Ben Larkin is missing.
And I intend to use my best efforts to find him.
Without interfering with the Yard, of course.
Oh, Lieutenant.
I am still a little concerned about a certain item you're wearing.
Oh, well if that bothers you, wear it in good health.
The old school tie.
Well, guv, what do you think of our friend Brannigan?
Well, he's an American.
Sir Charles.
Why would a bona fide lord want to be a cop?
Because he's good at it.
Why are you a cop?
I don't know. Runs in the family.
But it stops right here.
My son is a lawyer.
Hello, Central? Central 77 here.
Mollie? Do me a favor, will you?
Call Richard and tell him I'll be late.
I don't know. About 7:00. Thanks.
Monkey wrench?
You mean a spanner?
Did I throw one in your social life?
Well, not quite.
Not that Richard is exactly a paragon of patience.
Well, just blame it on your Yankee slave driver, who still hasn't eaten.
Would you mind grabbing a bite before we go house hunting?
I wouldn't mind at all.
Thank you very much.
Lieutenant, I'll see you in the morning.
- Maybe around nine?
- About that, goodnight.
Mr. Lawyer, the next voice your hear belongs to Ben Larkin.
You'd better listen.
Fields, I've been grabbed by a couple of hoods.
They're tough.
So you do exactly what I tell you, or I'm a dead man.
Now, you've got five envelopes with this tape.
First, put £50,000 in each envelope.
Get old, used bills.
Then you make the drop in person.
Come alone to the mailbox in the middle of Piccadilly Circus at exactly 11:35 a.m. tomorrow morning.
You got that?
Next, stay away from those damn limey cops.
They could screw things up.
There's a gun at my head, Fields, so don't blow this one.
Or my guys will tear your heart out.
Why did you double-cross him, Fields?
What does that mean?
Larkin told you to stay away from the cops.
In Chicago, I would have.
But considering the reputation of Scotland Yard,
I decided it was in the best interests of my client to put the matter in their hands.
You're a real Eagle Scout, Fields.
We don't even know that that's Larkin's voice.
Inspector, Mr. Larkin called in to complain about our surveillance, sir.
The call was routed routinely through Central where it was in turn re-directed to the switchboard of our department.
In rather sulfurous language,
I must say,
Mr. Larkin demanded...
Yes, thank you, Mike, thank you.
The point is, we taped Larkin's call, voiceprinted it.
They matched.
Do you think you can raise that money by tomorrow morning?
That's no problem.
Fortunately, Mr. Larkin has generous and influential associates in the States.
Translation, Commander, hoods.
A bank draft is on its way.
Mob money, squeezed out of hookers and skimmed off of casinos.
Yes, well, I think we perhaps better get on with it, Mr. Fields.
Commander, what will you be doing?
Well, our interests are mutual.
The safe return of Mr. Larkin.
We'll keep you informed.
It's a bit dicey.
Not a copper in sight.
They're down there, all right.
I can smell them.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.
Rolls-Royce approaching the circus.
Drop completed.
Prepare for pickup phase.
Well, now we'll see.
Mailman's just passed me.
Approaching the island now.
It's too damn simple.
Pickup completed.
Right, job completed. Let's go.
We'll take it.
It's a messenger on a motor scooter.
We're on him.
Right. Get going!
- Like I said.
- Too damn simple.
That's right. Too damn simple.
Don't get too far behind.
Give Harry a hand, there.
Hold it!
Can you swim?
- Yeah.
- Go get it!
I'll sink with these boots on!
Oy, give us a hand.
After a few questions.
What's the idea of throwing this money in the river?
Money?
I don't know nothing about no money.
Some bloke mailed the instructions, with a five-pound note.
Newspaper.
What?
They pulled a Murphy.
Hey, what about me?
A Murphy?
Okay.
Yeah, they tunneled from underneath.
Yes, of course. And then they switched envelopes by means of...
A false bottom.
As simple as that.
A magnet.
Ruddy sewers.
They'll be miles away by now.
I'll be right back.
Hello, Mrs. Cooper.
Good afternoon, Mr. Brannigan.
Would you like a coffee?
Oh, thank you, no.
Some people are waiting for me.
Oh, pity.
Oh, Mrs. Cooper.
Yes, Mr. Brannigan?
Did I have any visitors today?
No, I don't think so.
Thank you.
Oh, there was a man here.
Something about the central heating.
What happened?
Your central heating friend left me a present.
- We must call the police.
- He is the police.
I have never seen anything like it in my life.
- You're insured?
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Jim?
- In here.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm afraid that the...
I'll show you.
You mean he's put another one in there?
I mean...
- That's what I mean.
- Yes.
Yeah.
Larkin paid 25 grand to get me that view.
- All the usual checks being made?
- Yes, sir.
All been fingerprinted, guv.
I want a complete report on all sales of gelignite
- during the past two months.
- Right, guv.
And try and trace that damn thing.
- Where is he?
- He's downstairs at Mrs. Cooper's, sir.
Oh, don't you look nice.
Well, thank you.
I'm sorry I haven't a room available, but I'm sure I could make room for you in my place.
Oh, that's very kind of you, but...
- No, really, it'd be a pleasure.
- Lieutenant.
Jennifer, don't you think we ought to show our visitor a bit of British hospitality?
Why don't you take him out for a spot of dinner?
Yes, sir.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
And leave the police work to the Yard.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Cooper.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Cooper, thank you.
Enjoy yourself, Lieutenant.
I will.
Perhaps you'd care for a cup of coffee. Come along.
Well.
It says For Sale.
Well, I'm sure I can persuade them to rent it to you for a week.
If you don't mind me as a neighbor.
Why should I?
It puts me closer to my driver.
It's been a lovely evening, Jim.
Yeah, pleasant.
And I hate to change the mood.
But, Jenny, I want you to do me a favor.
You shouldn't have that, Jim.
That's a felony.
- Is that so?
- Yes, that is so.
Commander Swann was not amused.
I had all these names run down by the Department.
They all check out except that one.
- Jimmy the Bet.
- That's right, do you know him?
Yeah, he's a bookie. He's also a grass.
What you would call a stoolie.
He's got his eye on every keyhole in London.
Is it important?
Anything that has to do with Larkin is important.
He's in blackmail, extortion, hard drugs.
You name it, he's in it.
Jenny, I just happen to be working the other side of the street.
Is that all?
Well, a couple of years ago,
I was making it tough for him.
And one night he hit back.
Pair of shotguns.
But he obviously missed.
But the rookie riding with me took a blast in his face.
He left a widow and a couple of nice kids.
I'm sorry, Jim.
You must have been close to him.
Oh, it'd make a good story, but that's not the reason.
The truth is, I hated his guts.
He didn't like me.
He had a degree in criminology and...
Well, to hell with that.
My job was to keep him alive until he could get smart enough or tough enough to take care of himself.
I blew it.
What's that for?
I don't know.
You're just so damn solid.
Fat, you mean.
- Telephone for you, sir.
- Thank you.
Hello?
Yes, Inspector. Yes, right away.
He wants us back at the office.
Yes, well, there's no doubt this fingerprint is Larkin's.
Oh, forgive me for interrupting your evening, Lieutenant.
Jenny, the artist has a sketch of our mad bomber up in 194.
- Pick it up for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Your theory that Mr. Larkin may have staged his own kidnapping doesn't quite work.
Is that so?
Someone sent us a personal contribution from Mr. Larkin.
Did you print it?
Of course.
Third finger of the left hand.
And it was accompanied by a demand for an additional 350,000 quid.
That brings the ante up to a million and a half dollars.
The additional payment was in the nature of a penalty because Mr. Fields consulted the Yard for assistance.
- These gentlemen play rough.
- And smart.
They certainly made bloody fools of us in that Piccadilly caper.
All my years in the Yard, I've never received a finger in the morning post.
God knows what they'll be sending us next. On, thanks.
Well, that's it.
It's only based on your landlady's description, of course.
But we've wired copies to Interpol, the Sûreté and the FBI.
Does it ring a bell for you?
No, but if Larkin has a contract on me, he'd hire top talent.
Then I want you on the next flight to Chicago.
You care, Commander, you really care.
I want you in Chicago alive, you big sod.
I don't want you in London as an unsolved homicide.
We're short-staffed as it is.
We have the same problem in Chicago, Commander.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Oh, Lieutenant.
I'll take that particular item.
You mean the...
The notepad.
I guess I picked this up by mistake.
Of course. That's what I assumed.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.
Listen, darling, I've got a problem.
I've got to stay on duty till 2:00.
Well, here comes my problem.
Oh, Jim, this is my fiancé,
Richard Nelson.
- Jim Brannigan.
- Oh, how are you?
So, you're the guy who's been ruining our love life.
I'm glad you're not 20 years younger.
If I were, you'd have to worry.
Well, we're not finished yet.
One more call. Sorry.
- Goodnight, love.
- Goodnight.
Okay, where to?
Jimmy the Bet.
Oh, you watch him.
He's a tough customer.
- Evening, Jimmy.
- I've got no time for bird cops.
I got £1,000 on this fight.
Jimmy, it isn't social, it's official.
Open up.
It still isn't social. I'm a cop.
It shows, flatfoot.
And I found your name on a notepad of Benny Larkin's.
Is he one of your customers?
I got nothing to say to you. Out!
Benny Larkin's been kidnapped.
You're gonna give me some information.
I can ask questions easy, or I can ask them hard.
Which will it be?
This is what I answer questions with.
It's mighty persuasive.
I guess the questions can wait.
But not for long.
Now, would you like to try for England's free dental care, or are you gonna answer my questions?
I'll ask you just once.
- Name a name.
- Al Drexel.
- Did you hear another?
- No, I swear it.
Where can I find this Drexel?
A pub, he goes there, the Lamb Tavern.
He goes there midday.
Well, thanks, Jimmy.
You know something, that Jackson's a bum.
He won't make it through the eighth.
Any trouble?
No trouble. Little hard to understand his accent.
That's Scotch rump steak, sir.
Right, well, I'll have that one, please.
I don't mind this turning into a shopping tour as long as it ends up with Drexel.
I say. Talk of the devil.
That's him in the gray suit, walking towards the pub now.
Fine, would you just give me time to get a little friendly.
Mind if I butt in, partner?
It's a free country.
- All right, Navy?
- Yes, sure.
Yeah, it's a pleasant country.
I wouldn't argue with that.
Last time I was here, people were getting bombed a different way.
Doris, let's have some service here.
The man's dying of thirst.
All right, darling, what do you want?
Well, I want some Guinness.
How about you?
- Same again, please.
- Good.
- Navy?
- No, I've got enough, thanks.
How is the second-best Navy?
- You should know.
- Nice one, Ted.
Well, partner. Cheers.
Wait a minute, friend, we're having a drink.
Drexel, I'd like a few words with you.
Let's step outside, shall we?
Scotland Yard. Can't you smell it?
Is it illegal to have a drink?
May I suggest, sir, that you keep out of this.
This is strictly police business.
Oh, tell him to show you his badge.
Drexel, I said outside. Now come on.
That cuts it!
Sorry.
Hey, what are you doing?
What's the idea?
Well, who the hell started it?
Awfully sorry.
And I love you so
Let the sun shine
Let the sunshine in
Let the sun shine
Let the sunshine in
Guv.
Guv!
Mike, have you got it?
Seems likely, guv.
Gwendolyn Rooke.
Female, Caucasian, aged 26.
Well, get on with it then.
The subject resides in Balham.
I'm sorry, lady. If I were you, I'd...
Look out!
And has access to blueprints and charts for telephone and sewage conduits...
...under Piccadilly Circus.
This place is getting kinda unfriendly.
- You're right.
- Where are we going?
Let's go to my place and have a drink.
You all right?
Come on, partner.
We'd better get out of here.
The Yank's got our pigeon.
As far as I can see.
Yes, well, perhaps we'd better look her over.
See what Miss Rooke has to say for herself.
Oh, and, Mike, while you're at it, run this lot of rowdies in, will you.
Right, guv.
Excuse me. How's your wrist?
Constable. Arrest that lot, will you.
Come on, sir. Come on.
It had nothing to do with me.
I'm only here for the beer.
I think you'll find the evidence is conclusive, sir, if you would just examine the map.
Yes, of course. Thank you.
Thanks, Mike.
Last month, the 16th, to be exact, you made copies of maps detailing the electrical and sewage conduits beneath Piccadilly Circus.
That's what I'm paid to do, sir.
Of course.
But to whom did you give those copies?
To one of my supervisors, I expect.
Miss Rooke, both you and I know that that is not true.
Protecting a criminal, Miss Rooke, is a crime in itself.
And I suggest that in your own best interests you stop lying to me.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't upset yourself.
Miss Rooke.
I've always been a good girl, sir.
I'm sure you have, my dear.
But to whom did you give them?
To my boyfriend, Freddy.
Freddy.
Now, now, come on.
Watch it, partner.
- I'm only just...
- You're a handful.
I like Americans. They think big.
Wait till you see what I've got here.
Take a look at this.
Look at what?
I've got a deal going here that'll make your hair stand on end.
Oh, no, you're getting too familiar.
I've only just met you.
We're only acquaintances yet.
Well, you know what I think you need, fella, is a cup of coffee.
- I need another drink.
- Come on.
- I can't stand coffee.
- Get in the kitchen.
Come on, let's have a fight, Marquis of Queensberry rules. Let's have a drink.
Give me a minute and I'll fix you right up,
- if I can find the coffee.
- I don't want any coffee.
Maybe you'll have to settle for tea.
All right, Buster, the friendly hour's over. Wake up.
Come on, get up.
Hold it up, down there!
Get off, you stupid-looking mutt.
Sorry!
Police, son. Follow that car.
What? Police? What car?
- Right-hand drive.
- Of course.
Well...
I say...
This is actually a new car, you know.
It's not really supposed to go beyond 4,000 revs.
Till the 1,000-mile inspection.
Please look out!
I was rather hoping to keep it for a year or so, I...
I wonder if I might get you a taxi or something.
Hang on.
- I feel sick.
- Not in here!
Oh, nuts!
Oh, no!
I waited a year for delivery.
Very good. Thank you.
Well, Lieutenant, how did you enjoy your sightseeing tour?
The view from the bridge was terrific.
Incidentally, regarding that automobile, where would you liked it shipped?
Well, you bought it, you know.
Ooh, handsome.
Freddy!
- Yes, Mike?
- Nothing, guv.
It's not fair. My eyes are murdering me, looking at all those bloody pictures.
You'll smoke when I tell you.
Listen, I know my rights.
You start talking to me about rights, and I'll tear you limb from limb.
Now, who did you sell those plans to?
I don't know what the bloody hell you're talking about, man.
Poor, ignorant, wee laddie, isn't he?
They do have libraries inside, Freddy, and I'll put you away for so long, you'll come out a bloody PhD!
Swann.
I'd tell that fellow what he wants to know.
He likes to hurt people.
Today at a bar, there was a fight.
He bit a fellow's ear off.
Him?
And that's not all.
What, him?
We'll be in touch. No more calls.
Look, I've really had you, you creep.
Okay.
Okay.
He gave me £100 to sell him the plans.
- Who did?
- Charlie.
Charlie Kane.
Put him up.
That's him. That's Charlie.
- Take him away.
- All right, come on.
And that's our man, that's the fellow that nailed Drexel.
- Are you sure?
- I saw him.
Boy, oh boy, it's really coming together.
That was Fields. His friends are calling at 11:00 tomorrow with instructions for the next payment.
Give us time to put a tracer on the call?
I wish we could.
They're calling on a marine frequency.
They ain't amateurs.
Hello, Jim. Where are you going?
Have you got the keys to your car?
I forgot my notebook.
Sure, I'll get it.
No, you'll get your hair wet.
You wanna bet?
Jenny, look out!
Jenny! You all right?
Are you all right?
- No.
- What's the matter?
Well, look at my hat.
Oh, your hat.
Let's get out of this.
Yes, sir.
Damn it, I'm having to take more flak than an air gunner over Normandy on this case. Forget the Commissioner.
Now, we've got the Home Secretary blowing his top, demanding to know what kind of a lunatic I've turned loose.
This isn't Chicago, you know, Brannigan.
That's right, Commander.
You can't buy a decent hamburger anyplace around here.
You're a bloody magnet for trouble.
First the man hired to kill you blows up an apartment, and then you demolish an automobile in what must be one of the most brazen, reckless stunts in the annals of this city.
Look, Commander...
And then, last night, you turn a perfectly peaceful
London street into a shooting gallery.
And if I hadn't done some shooting,
Jenny would be lying on a marble slab right now.
Exactly. Simply because she was mistaken for you.
I've asked you politely.
Now I'll ask you impolitely, give me that gun.
I haven't got it.
Well?
This just arrived from the FBI in Washington, DC, guv.
You got a name for him?
Name of John Gorman.
An habitué of New Orleans, Louisiana.
- Last known address...
- Do you know him?
Well, I know about him.
The word is that he's a stud who won't quit.
Well, we'll pick him up. Send out a top-priority signal to all stations.
Right away, sir.
Yes?
Joseph Brannigan, long distance.
Hello?
Hello, big stuff. Sure, fine.
You did?
Well, what's the dope?
Well, now let me get this straight, now.
Jupiter Equity Fund.
He bought 20,000 shares at $49, sold them at $3.
That makes Melvin a living, breathing pauper.
Sure, I will. Be home soon.
Your son?
What's his line of work?
Ballet.
I should have guessed.
No, he's Assistant
District Attorney for Cook County.
Anything in that conversation
I should know about?
Commander, I wish it were Christmas.
Have I got some kind of a present for you.
Yes. Right, thank you.
Mr. Fields is on his way up, sir.
Do you know where he's parked?
- Nine, lower level.
- Right.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Got to the bank at the stroke of 10:00, and it took eight clerks until now to get this package together.
We were worried about you, Melvin.
Make yourself right at home, Brannigan.
I have.
We're now ready and willing to make the payment.
Mr. Fields, we have some new information.
And we are now very close to a breakthrough in this case. Very close.
Within four hours, or five, at the most, we expect to have Mr. Larkin home safe.
I strongly suggest, therefore, that, in the best interests of your client, you delay payment for those few hours.
No way.
This time I do exactly what they tell me.
You pay that money now, and you'll get Larkin back in chunks.
The Lieutenant quotes chapter and verse, Mr. Fields.
This is a gentleman who rejoices in the name of Charlie the Handle.
Identified as a member of the kidnap team.
He will lead us to Mr. Larkin.
Kind of unusual, Melvin.
Couple of professional cops telling you what's best for your client.
Knock it off, Brannigan.
If Larkin's friends in the States find out I'm in bed with the Yard, they'll part my hair with a blowtorch.
It's all there, you don't have to count it.
Well, if you lose Larkin and that loot, they'll part more than your hair with that blowtorch.
Earthy, but accurate, I would have thought.
If you'll accept my apologies,
Mr. Fields, I really must insist that you give us the time.
Something's coming in, sir.
Put it on the speaker.
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.
Now you contact us on marine frequency 15.2. Repeat, 15.2.
We will use different frequencies to contact you, and you will have only four seconds to make the change.
Calling Mel Fields.
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.
Are you there, Fields?
This is Mel Fields.
Now, I'm going to give it to you just once, so get it good.
This is how you make the drop.
You leave the hotel in exactly 10 minutes.
And make sure you come alone.
Have you got that, Fields?
Yes, I've got it.
But I've run into a slight snag.
What's the problem?
There's no problem.
But the bank needs four or five hours more to get the money together.
What do you think, Geef? Coppers?
For his sake, I hope not.
Listen, Fields...
Come on, Mel.
Bring the money here. Bring it!
All right. You've just bought yourself four hours.
And then you've had it.
Then you've had it.
All right.
You've got four hours to get Larkin back.
But if you don't, I make the payment.
And I won't tell you where or when.
Fair enough.
And, Commander Swann,
I want your word that there'll be no surveillance of any kind.
You have my word, sir.
Oh, and be sure to call room service if you need anything.
I will.
Find anything?
She's clean, sir. Except for this.
Long-range homing device.
You can't trust anybody these days.
Stay back, not too close.
It's okay. He's alone.
Well, come on, make the payoff and let's get the hell out of here.
Not yet, Ben.
What do you mean, not yet?
Charlie. Geef.
- You're early, Fields.
- Yeah.
Has he been a good boy?
He never raised a finger.
Oh, bad joke, Geef.
Good job, Charlie.
Well, come on, get them off!
Get back, on your big fat... rear.
Well.
What's going on?
You know, I think it's about time.
Yes.
But this is my party, Charlie.
Ben, the first time we met, you told me something
I've never forgotten.
It's my golden rule, you might say.
Never trust anybody.
Mel, have you gone out of your...
We pulled it off, Ben. We did it!
Oh, I'm sorry about your finger, Ben.
I'm really sorry.
I bet you are, yeah.
For a million bucks, it was worth it.
And don't forget the first payment
I've got stashed away.
How do I get this thing off?
The key's over by the mirror.
It's first class for you all the way to South America and on into the sunset.
And this makes up for that bath
I took in that Jupiter stock.
Yeah, sorry about that.
We got wall-to-wall alibis.
Oh, Scotland Yard will swear that I cooperated.
I made the payments.
And even that big clown Brannigan backs up our story.
As long as he's alive.
You know, Mel, for a minute, when you had that gun on me,
I thought you were gonna get greedy.
You know, for a minute, Ben,
I was tempted.
But what the hell kind of world would it be if you couldn't trust somebody?
We've been had.
Knock knock.
Brannigan!
I wouldn't.
Unless you wanna sing soprano.
Earthy, but I agree with my friend.
They're all yours, Lieutenant.
Don't worry about me, James.
Bye-bye.
And I mean bye-bye.
That fella don't quit easy, does he?
Well, do you think you can hang on to them until I can get them a couple of airplane tickets?
Oh, I think we can manage that, yes.
I just hope you don't lose them back in the Colonies.
Safe trip.
Thank you.
How about a lift, Yank?
Jim!
Jim! Jim!
I'm all right.
Over here!
Now!
Get behind that car!
Well, I'm going to miss this old town.
It's going to miss you.
I'm not sure if I agree with what my old dad said about you Yanks.
You mean that part about us being overpaid?
No, over here.
Jenny, it's been great.
It has.
So long.
- Do you think they'll come, sir?
- They'll come, all right.
Here. Stamp those and mail them.
It's ringing.
Would you walk Myron the other way?
My leg looks like a tree in this fog.
Come on.
What a godforsaken spot to get lost.
It's true. I saw a much better spot a few miles back.
Hello?
Good.
Tell them we're lost.
- The phone's dead.
- Why'd you say "hello"?
- I could've sworn...
- What?
- Sounded like somebody snipped the wire.
- Really?
What did it sound like?
Snip.
- Some fog, eh, Pop?
- I've already heard the weather report.
Drive, please.
It's as thick as pea soup.
Not a soul around for miles.
Know what I think?
Perfect place for a murder.
Conversation like television set on honeymoon:
Unnecessary.
Where are we going, anyway, Pop?
Who is this Mr. Twain?
What'd he mean, "dinner and a murder"?
Questions like athlete's foot:
After a while, very irritating.
To stop car, please.
- What's wrong?
- Stop car, please.
To shut engine off, please.
Listen.
I don't hear nothing.
What do you hear?
- Double negative and dog.
- So it's a dog. So what?
If not mistaken...
...dog belong to Mr. Dick Charleston.
- Who's Dick Charleston?
- I am.
You don't happen to have seen a little white... Wang!
A white Wang?
Sidney Wang! What are you doing in this godforsaken spot?
No doubt, same as you.
Looking for bridge that lead to home of host, Mr. Lionel Twain.
You too, huh?
Must be important to invite two such detectives.
Excuse, please, to introduce
Japanese son, Willie.
Japanese?
But I thought...
Mrs. Wang and I couldn't have children.
Willie: Adopted number three son.
Careful on this road.
It's treacherous.
Treacherous road like fresh mushroom.
Must always...
Idiot! Not finish mushroom story.
You're idiot!
Sorry, but I see nothing.
This fog's as thick as bouillabaisse.
- Nuts!
- I beg your pardon?
Nuts, nuts! There are no nuts in my chocolate!
You let that imbecile in the shop give you raisins.
He didn't have any nuts.
- The man in the shop?
- That's the reason I took the raisins.
Never mind.
We'll soon be there for dinner.
Hot soup.
Something is not right in all of this, huh?
I can feel it in my bones.
- In your what?
- In my bones.
Buns? You have buns?
You bought buns and didn't tell me?
- Where are the buns?
- No, monsieur.
The bones in my body.
You shouldn't speak with an accent when you know I'm hungry.
If you ask me, Sam, this is a wild goose chase.
- Nobody asked you.
- Yes, they did.
You asked me back there if I thought...
That was then. This is now.
Nobody knows what tomorrow will be.
That's the way it is, whether we like it or not.
Sam, I really worry about you sometimes.
Cut the malarkey.
This trip is strictly business.
- What do you got on Twain?
- He was born in San Francisco in 1906.
His mother was Catholic, father an Orthodox Jew.
They separated two hours after the marriage.
- Any children?
- Yeah, one daughter, 32.
Her name's Irene, but she goes by Rita.
Just like a dame.
Don't stop, angel. You're doing fine.
He was arrested in 1932 for selling pornographic bibles.
Charges were dropped when the church didn't turn over the bibles.
There's nothing on him until '46 when he was picked up in El Paso...
...for smuggling a truckload of rich, white Americans...
...into Mexico to pick melons.
He was sent to the state hospital for mental observation.
I think we picked ourselves a queer bird, angel. Anything else?
Yeah. Get this, Sam.
Twain has one interesting physical characteristic. He has no pinkies.
No pinkies?
Twain's only got eight fingers?
No, no. He's got 10.
He just doesn't have any pinkies.
- You did your homework good.
- Thanks.
- Where'd you dig that up?
- I wrote Twain and asked.
Good thinking.
- What's the matter?
- Wouldn't you know, out of gas.
I saw a station about five miles back, Sam.
I want you to know I'm gonna be waiting for you, baby.
Here's the bridge, Pop.
Doesn't look safe to me.
One way to find out.
Drive across.
Aren't you gonna come with me?
Weight of two men may be too much for bridge.
Then why do I get to drive?
Because I smart enough to get out first.
I'm not gonna make it.
It's gonna collapse.
Not worry.
Father find other way to house.
I made it, Pop!
I made it!
Good! Good!
Now come back and get adopted father.
Look at invitation.
What number of house?
- Two-two...
- Correct.
2-2, Twain's house.
Continue.
- Did you see that?
- No.
Neither did I.
Stop! Do not move.
Something's wrong here.
- What is it?
- Do not ask questions. Do as I say.
When I tell you jump, you jump.
One, two, three...
...jump!
Holy Shanghai!
Nice counting.
But how'd you know?
Look on ground.
Even had correct shoe size.
Someone gone great trouble...
...to make welcome guests not so welcome.
Ring bell, please.
Are you nuts?
Someone's trying to kill us.
Yes. Should make exciting weekend.
Ring, please.
I wish it was Monday morning.
Well, here goes.
They're killing someone in there!
- Calm yourself.
- Didn't you hear her scream?
No. You heard scream.
More experienced ear heard doorbell.
Listen again.
Mr. Twain has macabre sense of humour, yeah?
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.
But in what condition?
Roof in need of repair.
Indeed. I'm afraid the house is falling apart.
- May we come in, please?
- I'm sorry. I thought you were in.
You are Mr. And Mrs. Charleston?
Not quite.
I am Inspector Wang of Catalina, please.
This adopted son, Willie.
I trust you had a pleasant journey despite the storm?
Strange weather.
Storm only outside when inside.
That. That's just one of Mr. Twain's little toys.
An electronic device.
Mr. Twain, as you will soon discover...
...prefers his atmosphere murky.
- May I have your bags, sir?
- No, no.
Son will get bags.
That is why I adopted him.
Very good, sir.
One moment, please, while I close the door.
Now, if you will follow me,
I will show you to your room.
Very large house.
No other servants?
I'm not sure.
I've never seen anyone.
Mr. Twain asked me to see that you're made comfortable...
...and to say he'll join you after dinner.
After dinner?
Host not have dinner with guests?
No. Mr. Twain prefers to eat out.
- Wait, please. What that?
- That? It nothing. Just the cat.
That cat?
You feed cat dog food?
I'm afraid he's a very angry cat, sir.
Mr. Twain had him fixed, and he didn't want to be.
Big house, huh, Pop?
Big house like man married to fat woman:
Hard to get around.
Here we are.
I'm sure you'll find this suitable.
- It's a cold house.
- I've taken care of that.
You'll find a nice, cosy fire in your room.
It's a bit smoky, sir.
I'm afraid that fireplace hasn't been used in years.
- At least the bed will be warm.
- If you wish anything, please ring.
- Where buzzer?
- It's behind the bed, sir, there.
Dinner will be at 9:00...
...and Mr. Twain likes his guests to dress.
The doorbell. Excuse me.
Wow! What a creepy guy.
Why would anyone want to hire a blind butler?
For one thing, very cheap.
How butler know how much he get paid?
Drink this. You'll feel better.
If Myron hadn't barked, we'd have missed the statue falling.
It wasn't meant to kill.
It's a warning.
Somebody's trying to frighten us. Why?
Whatever his reason, he's doing well.
- Why hasn't anybody answered?
- Don't ring it! Knock, don't ring.
I won't, I promise.
- What is it now, Myron?
- Up there, Dora. Look.
- A blind butler.
- Don't let him park the car, Dickie.
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.
We let ourselves in.
Dick and Dora Charleston.
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.
Your room is ready, if you'll just follow me, please.
Don't mind him. It's just the cat.
- We left our luggage in the trunk.
- I'll get it later...
...when I park the car.
- Was that Mr. Wang's car out front?
- Yes. They're resting in their room.
I've put you in the same wing as Mr. Wang.
Isn't that nice?
We're in Wang's wing.
Not many people come to the manor these days.
It's nice to hear guests again.
- Thanks. You are?
- Bensonmum.
Thank you, Benson.
Bensonmum.
My name is Bensonmum.
- Bensonmum?
- Yes, sir. Jamesir Bensonmum.
- Jamesir?
- Yes, sir.
- Jamesir Bensonmum?
- Yes, sir.
- How odd.
- My father's name, sir.
What was your father's name?
- Howard Bensonmum.
- Howard Bensonmum?
Leave it. I've had enough.
Here we are.
The late Mrs. Twain's room.
She died in here.
- Oh, dear.
- Died of what?
She murdered herself in her sleep, sir.
- You mean suicide?
- Oh, no.
It was murder, all right.
Mrs. Twain hated herself.
We keep this room locked.
- Why is that?
- Mr. Twain loved her very much.
He's kept her room just as it was the night she choked herself...
...nine years ago.
Madam loved it here.
She said it was the cheeriest room in the house.
- The doorbell.
- That was Mrs. Charleston.
- I thought she was here.
- I am.
I will not stay in this filthy room.
Very well, madam.
I'll attend to it during dinner.
- Thank you, Benson, sir.
- Mum!
- What?
- Bensonmum. Ma'am.
Baking flour.
- What?
- This dust is baking flour.
And these cobwebs... Candied sugar.
All placed here for the purpose of frightening us.
And that mouse...
Obviously a mechanical toy.
- Silly.
- What is?
I am. It's real.
- Stop the car. We're here.
- That's why I stopped.
- Open my door.
- You have chocolate on your face.
The candy bar's on your face.
- Imbecile, that's my moustache!
- Lick it and see.
Wipe it off.
My hands are sticky.
Hold still, please.
Sloppy.
All in good time.
Yes?
Who's there?
Who's there, I say?
Filthy neighbourhood.
Didn't I say "jump"?
"Un, deux, trois, jump."
Why don't you listen?
- Leave me alone.
- Sloppy.
Who are you?
You must be the new kitchen maid.
I hope you can cook.
Answer me. Speak up.
What's that?
I can't hear you.
A little shy, are you?
Never mind.
There will be 10 for dinner.
Here is the menu.
Is that understood?
And dinner will be at 9:00.
When I want you, that bell on the wall will ring three times.
All right. Get to work.
Operator.
I am saying, "Hello, hello."
- It's dead, sir.
- What?
Who is? Who are you?
The butler, sir.
The butler, eh?
I thought as much.
That phone has been out of order for the past week, sir.
Is that a fact?
And I say that this wire has been snipped not one hour ago...
...as you can plainly see.
What is your name?
Your little jest escapes me.
I am Monsieur Milo Perrier.
He was injured by a falling gargoyle...
...while standing in Chinese footprints.
We rang, a woman screamed...
...a mouse ran through the door.
As you can plainly see,
I miss nothing.
Since we can't call a doctor...
...I will need a cold compress and hot chocolate, n'est-ce pas?
We don't have n'est-ce pas, sir.
Just Hershey's.
I'll call the maid.
I'll fetch it for you myself, sir.
In the meantime, if you'll be good enough to follow me to your room.
Get up. Get up.
There's something about him
I do not trust.
Notice how his eyes never look at you.
He's blind, monsieur.
Nonsense.
There's the house now.
- What's the matter?
- My feet are killing me.
Why didn't you tell me we needed oil before I went back for gas?
I gave you $50 and the gas was $5.00.
Maybe you'd come back. Maybe not.
I couldn't risk it.
- Don't you trust me, Sam?
- Trust you?
The last time that I trusted a dame was in Paris in 1940.
She said she was going to get wine.
Two hours later, the Germans marched into France.
I'm sorry, Sam.
Sorry nothing.
Give me my change.
Dinner will be at 9:00.
I'll have the maid bring your chocolate.
- One moment, my good man.
- Sir?
Thank you. That will be all.
He's blind, all right.
Those were my funniest faces.
It's not exactly the Copacabana, is it?
I don't feel good about this.
Maybe tonight your luck runs out.
Maybe so. There's a number on the wall for all of us.
If tonight's the night they pick mine, so be it.
After you, sweetheart.
- First, kiss me, Sam.
- I don't kiss.
Just this once, Sam.
I don't like kissing.
Now leave me alone.
My God!
- He's dead!
- I beg your pardon?
Sam Diamond is lying out there.
He's been crushed to death.
I'm going to faint.
Catch me.
Madam. Madam, where are you?
Hold it right there.
Freeze, blinky!
Get your hands up.
Turn your face to the wall.
All right, angel.
You can get up now.
Turn around, Jeeves.
Your concrete Christmas present came two seconds early, no thanks to you.
I apologize for any unfortunate mishap, sir.
- May I put my hands down?
- Don't test your luck, Shakespeare.
I got your invitation to dinner...
...but I didn't realize
I'd be the main course.
I had a kid brother who got it the same way...
...working on a case like this two years ago.
That boy would've been 63 on Tuesday.
For two cents, I'd take this...
Get him away from me! Get him away.
Get him away before I stuff him like a tiger trophy...
...his limey pals like to hang up on saloon walls.
Please.
He has a dreadful temper, hasn't he?
9:00, time for dinner.
Is everything ready?
I don't smell anything.
Very light on the seasoning, are you?
Put the soup in a tureen and keep the squabs on low.
I'll serve cocktails.
When you hear the bell, bring out the chilled asparagus...
...and turn up the flame on the squabs.
Have you got that?
You didn't tell me how I look.
No different than always...
Ravishing.
- Do you love and adore me?
- I love and adore you.
- You have the best tush in high society.
- Years of horseback riding.
Getting to bottom of things?
- Ah, Wang. You remember...
- Of course.
- Nice to see you, Ah Wang.
- Always a pleasure.
What a beautiful gown.
Tell me where you got it.
This? This an old dress.
Had it for years.
Please to meet adopted son, Willie.
East meets West in a most bizarre setting.
I didn't know you were invited.
You know Wang.
I had the pleasure of dining in Shanghai...
...many years ago with Inspector Wang.
You remember. Yes.
You had "hong ching chu" and I had "kow dung woo fong."
My wife, Dora. Inspector Perrier.
I'm sorry. Our room is so dusty.
My fault.
I should have blown first.
May I present my secrétaire and chauffeur Marcel Cassette.
- Recovered from your accident, Marcel?
- But how did you know?
From the way you bend.
Your right side smashed in by a Citroen.
I detected a slight metallic sound...
...so I think you have an artificial hip. Steel?
Aluminum. You're as quick as ever,
Charleston.
And you, Charleston...
...did not approve of
Mrs. Charleston dying hair blond?
I beg your pardon?
Mrs. Charleston hair red.
You have blond hairs on shoulder.
That means she has dyed red hair to blond then back again to red.
Or else you have been...
So sorry. Wang is wrong.
Shall we go to dinner, please?
- Boy, Pop, you sure put your...
- Shut Japanese mouth.
It must be ghastly to have a hip removed.
- Does it hurt?
- Only in damp weather.
- Are you all right?
- Pay no attention. You'll spoil him.
Get up. Get up.
- As I was saying, Mr. Charleston...
- Hey, Pop.
A treacherous road like fresh mushrooms...
I know. Dog stick tongue out of picture.
Treacherous road like fresh mushrooms.
He's a charming fellow.
African death mask.
Died in some tribal ritual.
Wonder where others are.
Others?
What others?
Invitation to dinner and murder finally clear to Wang...
...with appearance of Monsieur Perrier.
It's obvious that the world's greatest detectives were invited.
Five of us, darling.
Three are here.
Two have not yet arrived.
- Miss Jessie Marbles of England.
- And...
Sam Diamond of San Francisco.
I know who you all are.
The lady in the dress is my secretary and mistress, Tess Skeffington.
- Sam, don't.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
She doesn't like it when I'm brutally honest.
Then again, we're all in a brutal business.
Never considered murder to be business, Mr. Diamond.
Is that right, Mr. Wang?
Maybe not for you, since you put your money in vegetables in the late '30s.
Our friends don't know that you own 50 percent...
...of the bean sprouts and the bamboo shoots grown in China.
You can imagine how much chicken chow mein...
...goes into his pot each year.
- Do I have the figures right?
- Right.
What does this have to do with anything?
Or you, Mr. Perrier.
You work both sides of the big drink.
Pretty good pickings, solving crimes for barons...
...and putting your fees into Swiss banks.
Three trips a year buys a lot of hot chocolate.
See here, Diamond...
You see here, Mr. Charleston of
New York, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills.
Crime's a hobby to you, isn't it?
It’s a game to wile away the time while you wait for room service...
...while your wife's dough buys martinis and your $300 suits.
That's nice, when all you gotta do...
...is give your wife a grab now and then and take the dog for a leak.
Sorry to shock you, but I never went to finishing school.
My school is the streets...
...and the barrel of a revolver is my teacher.
I get $50 a day in expenses when I can get them, gentlemen.
I owe Miss Skeffington three years back pay. Ain't that right?
- I don't care about the money.
- Neither do I.
If one of you would be so kind as to give my friend...
...a glass of cheap white wine,
I'm going down to find the can.
I talk so much sometimes,
I forget to go.
Please excuse Sam.
He was shot in the head last week.
He shouldn't be out of the hospital.
- I think he's damned honest.
- Dickie, language.
Miss Jessica Marbles and nurse.
Miss Marbles.
So we finally meet.
I've admired you ever since
I was tiny little detective.
Thank you, Mr. Wang.
I am Jessica Marbles.
This is Miss Withers, my nurse.
She's been with me 52 years.
I have to take care of the poor dear now.
Are you all right, Miss Withers?
Do you want your medicine now?
She's off. I could use a good, stiff shot, Mr. Charleston.
I believe booze, as you call it, is your department.
- My pleasure, madam.
- Who's the old geezer?
Jessie, baby!
- You have a bullet hole in your back.
- You should see the other guy.
Quiet, please.
Observe strange sound.
My God, it's the face.
It's coming from the face.
He's going through his final moments.
- What could it mean?
- It means dinner, sir. We have no gong.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to make a toast.
Our host, Mr. Lionel Twain, is indeed a most unique man.
One:
He's succeeded in gathering...
...the world's greatest detectives...
...to investigate a crime not yet committed.
Two: He's set traps for us:
A bridge that almost collapses, falling statues.
Does he mean to kill us?
Not yet. He could've done that at any time.
He's merely trying to whet our appetites for the game.
Three: Why five detectives instead of one?
Because he intends to take us all on...
...a feat that no criminal mind has yet attempted.
Before this hellish weekend begins...
...I propose that we toast...
...to either a most beguiling and charming man...
...or to an insidious, fiendish madman.
- Bottoms up.
- One moment.
Point four: Wine poisoned.
An ancient, tasteless, colourless and odourless Oriental herb...
...that kills instantly.
Observe, please.
Great Scott, Mr. Wang.
You saved our lives.
Not quite, Mrs. Charleston.
Bon appétit.
Since Wang was the one who could detect poison, only he was tested.
Point five:
Mr. Twain is both beguiling and fiendish.
- Get a doctor, quick.
- No, no. It's all right.
My wine is not poisoned.
It was just a bad year.
Good work, Mr. Wang.
We must all be on our guard through every course of the meal.
You're all forgetting one thing.
This makes the butler suspicious.
He poured the wine.
How would he know which one to serve the poisoned glass to?
That's very simple.
Blind people have a very keen sense of smell.
Since we're Anglo-Saxon and Mr. Wang's son is Japanese...
...it wouldn't be hard to sniff out the Chinaman.
See here.
That's a tacky thing to say.
It's a tacky world,
Mr. Charleston.
- Isn't that right, angel?
- That's right.
Quiet, please.
Butler approaches.
I apologize. I'm having communication problems with the cook.
Who poured the wine?
Mr. Twain, sir.
It was left for me in the refrigerator.
I was told to give Mr. Wang the glass with the sticky stem.
And you didn't ask why?
I was lucky to find the refrigerator.
- If I may serve the soup now?
- By all means.
Yes, I'm famished.
One moment.
- Where is the soup?
- In your dish, sir.
There is nothing in my dish but my dish.
- I don't understand, sir.
- Here, take the spoon.
Taste it for yourself.
I see what you mean, sir.
If you'll excuse me, I'd better have a little talk with the cook.
Murder by starvation.
Maybe that's his game.
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Ask the moose.
He's been watching since we came in.
Ten people for dinner, and I'm serving them hot nothing!
You can't get good help today.
You're fired, you understand?
Fired!
I want you out, do you hear? Out!
And stay out.
Something just occurred to me.
- The seating's all wrong.
- How so?
- I'm sitting next to Dora.
- So what?
- She's your wife.
- Exactly.
The husband's never seated next to the wife.
I should be on the opposite side.
Will you trade?
- Now, Mr. Charleston?
- Now, Mr. Wang.
Another test that could have cost us our lives.
Saved only by the fact that I am well-bred.
Lucky it wasn't me.
I'd have been chopped liver.
Silence, please. Do not panic.
No person move from place.
Someone just came in.
I hear footsteps.
Wait! Quiet, everyone!
- I smell something.
- What is it?
Good God! Franks and beans!
I'm afraid that's all we have, sir.
You know how I get when you touch me there.
My hands are in my pockets.
- They're my pockets.
- Sorry.
Dickie, behave yourself.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm your host, Lionel Twain.
Good God, what an entrance!
A bit theatrical, Miss Marbles, but I do so love illusion.
Please forgive my hat.
I'm losing my hair.
I thought Twain was an older man, say 72, 73.
Seventy-six to be exact,
Mr. Diamond.
How do I look so young?
Quite simple.
A complete vegetable diet,
12 hours' sleep a night...
...and lots and lots of makeup.
- I trust you're all comfortable.
- Comfortable, Mr. Twain?
Is that what you call poisoned wine and near decapitation?
No. I call it inspiration.
You haven't explained the mechanical and culinary attempts on our lives.
Merely games, Monsieur Perrier.
Pitting wits with you, so to speak.
Pit your wits with me and you won't have wits to pit with.
You're spitting on the nurse.
Sorry, old lady.
Crazy broad should be in bed.
We have been here four hours...
...and there hasn't been a hot dinner or a corpse.
- I must therefore bid you adieu.
- I bid one adieu as well.
No one is leaving this house.
What meaning of this, Mr. Twain?
I will tell you, Mr. Wang, if you can tell me...
...why one of the most brilliant minds of the century...
...can't say prepositions or articles.
"The," Mr. Wang.
"What is the meaning of this?"
That what I said.
What meaning of this?
The meaning of this is...
...that I have decided to prove, beyond any doubt...
...that the greatest criminologist in the world is sitting at this table...
...and you are all looking at him.
No, don't look at each other!
Look at me! I'm the greatest!
I'm number one!
To me you look like number two.
Know what I mean?
- What does he mean?
- I'll tell you later. It's disgusting.
In all your adventures, monsieurs and madames...
...none of you has ever had an unsolved murder.
Your reputations exist on this single fact.
But what would the world say if the five greatest detectives...
...found themselves trapped in a house, shut off from the world...
...only to discover a dead body...
...stabbed 12 times in the back with a knife...
...and not one of you able to solve the crime?
- You mean murder?
- We're talking shop.
Yes, murder, Mrs. Charleston!
On the stroke of midnight...
...someone in this house will be murdered.
Left out one small detail,
Mr. Twain.
Who victim?
"Is the." "Is the."
"Who is the victim?"
That drives me crazy!
- Sounds like a short ride to me.
- Does it?
Well, we shall see who is sane and who is crazy around here.
Mr. Wang...
...the victim is here at this table at this very moment...
...and so too, ladies and gentlemen, is the murderer.
- Murder-poo?
- Yes, dear.
We're going to have a lovely murder-poo.
Push her wheelchair down the driveway.
We got business.
- You know who's gonna get it?
- Intimately.
- And how it'll be committed?
- Definitely.
And what time murder take place?
"The" murder. Precisely.
It's not my business, but doesn't that mean you're the murderer?
No wives. I refuse to discuss this with wives.
All fingers do point to you.
Not much of a challenge.
Shall I make it more interesting?
One million dollars to the one who solves the crime.
Wagered against your reputations.
One million dollars, tax-free.
In addition, the paperback rights and the film sale.
It's 11:00, amigos...
...just one hour before death strikes someone in this room.
See you at midnight.
See here, Mr. Twain!
- He's gone!
- No, he's not. He's down there.
Fast little bunny, ain't you?
I've never moved, Mr. Diamond.
I'm still down there.
A stunt with mirrors.
Is that so?
Willing to risk seven years' bad luck?
Try it, Mr. Diamond.
It's your funeral, butterball.
Wait. Sometimes it doesn't work.
You've won this round,
Mr. Diamond.
My turn comes at midnight.
I hope he knows how to stop that thing.
Anybody offering a million bucks to solve a crime that ain't happened...
...has lost more upstairs than hair.
What do we do?
Sit and wait to be butchered?
And what has happened to the butler?
Why has he not returned?
With our dinner?
- Go look for him.
- No!
- No one to leave this room.
- Why not?
Twain say victim at this table.
If we stay together, crime cannot be committed without witnesses.
He's right.
You're one smart Chinaman.
Let's join hands. The chain's stronger if the links are unbroken. Join hands.
Stop that.
- Stop it, I said.
- What is it, Diamond?
She's giving my palm the finger, the dirty broad.
Naughty, naughty, Miss Withers.
- Good God!
- What?
Look!
- What's she doing?
- She's screaming.
- What's happened?
- Something wrong in kitchen.
- With our dinner!
- Patience.
- Is someone there?
- Someone with dinner?
Cook cannot speak or hear.
"I think butler is dead.
My name is Yetta.
I don't work Thursdays."
Ask her if she sleeps in.
We'll investigate.
Someone must go.
Not alone. Mr. Charleston,
Mr. Diamond, stay.
Miss Marble, Mr. Perrier and Wang, we'll investigate.
That's right, just let it all out.
Here. Oh, dear.
Careful, Wang!
Fingerprints.
- Where?
- Yours.
Here, take my handkerchief.
- Is he?
- He look like...
Seems like.
Touch nothing!
Fingerprints.
Quite so.
Pencil.
No pulse.
No heartbeat.
If condition does not change, this man is dead.
No signs of foul play.
Hold on!
What's this?
What do you make of this, Perrier?
Poison, n'est-ce pas?
Not n'est-ce pas. Cocoa.
So at last we have our murder.
Not quite. Twain say murder victim sitting at our table.
Butler not at our table.
Butler only killed to divert us from real murder still to come.
Look!
One of the knives is missing.
The butcher's knife, I'll wager.
- The others are in danger.
- What's exact time?
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight...
Tell me when to stop. 59, 60...
28 minutes to main murder.
Back to dining room.
Must all be together at midnight.
One moment!
Handkerchief.
- What is it?
- A bill.
Everything here has been rented:
The butler, the food, the chairs.
- You mean?
- Yes.
This entire murder has been catered.
It's Twain's doing.
The man is mad.
Mad, yes, but no fool.
I only hope we are in time.
Door locked.
Diamond probably locked it from the inside.
Good thinking on Diamond head.
Diamond, it's Perrier.
It's all right. Open up.
Diamond? Charleston?
Are you in there?
Go back to kitchen, get dining room key from pocket of dead butler.
Don't say "dead butler." It's bad enough I have to reach in his pocket.
Holy merde.
Miss Skeffington!
Miss Skeffington!
Miss Withers!
- He's gone.
- Who?
The butler's body is missing.
Here's the key.
- Where you find key?
- In his pocket.
- What pocket?
- The butler's.
- Butler gone, but pocket there?
- Exactly.
Someone stole him but left his clothes.
Open the door.
Something is very wrong here.
Hello. Where is everyone?
Room filled with empty people.
I'll try the other door.
It's locked from the inside.
Both doors locked from inside, yet no way out.
I don't like it one bit.
I like it, but don't understand.
Maybe other way out of room, secret passageway perhaps.
Wrong. There are no secret passageways, Mr. Wang.
- You spoke?
- Not me.
I spoke.
There! Voice come from cow on wall!
Moose! Moose, you imbecile!
What have you done with the others, you short madman?
Stumped already.
Need some clues, Mr. Perrier?
I need no clues from you. I find my own, you demented lollipop!
Man who argue with cow is like train without wheels.
- Soon get nowhere.
- I'm sick of fortunes!
- Man who's sick of fortune...
- I said I was sick of this!
- Quiet, gentlemen, please!
- Cow talk again.
In need of a hint, Miss Marbles?
You all mistake what you assume
They never left the dining room
Count the numbers one to 10
Turn the knob and try again
What does that mean, they never left the room?!
- They did.
- Do not mistake what you assume.
- Back out in hall.
- What for?
We assume others not here, but cow say they are in dining room.
Let us look once more.
Please close door, Mr. Perrier.
- I can't see what good...
- Quiet.
Seven, eight, nine, 10.
Miss Marbles, be so kind as to open door.
Where were you?
We was worried.
Where were you?
Here. Didn't you say not to leave?
- You have not left this room since?
- Certainly not.
Answer simple...
...but question very hard.
- Where's the butler?
- Completely murdered.
Poisoned. One of the butcher's knives is missing.
We came back here, but the doors were locked.
I went to get the key from the butler.
His body was gone.
He'd been stripped and his clothes left.
I don't understand. Why would anyone want to steal a dead, naked body?
Well, dear, there are people who...
That's tacky. That's really tacky.
Then we returned here...
...opened the door, but the room was empty.
You were all gone.
The moose had told us not to assume that you'd left the dining room.
So we counted to 10 and tried it again.
And here you were.
I'm not one to use hyperbole, but I'll tell you this.
For the first time in my life,
I had the ca-ca scared out of me.
I like her.
I really like her.
- Gunshots, monsieur.
- Gunshots, Pop.
Gunshots, Dickie.
This time Charleston and I will go.
Everybody else stay here. Let's go.
What do you make of all of this, Wang?
Is confusing.
"It"! "It" is confusing!
Say your goddamn pronouns!
Open the door.
- Good God!
- What is it?
He's back.
And au naturel.
I don't get it. First they steal the body and leave the clothes.
Then they steal the clothes and bring the body back.
- Who would do that?
- Possibly a deranged dry cleaner.
What about the gunshots?
Why shoot him when he's been poisoned?
We heard shots, but I don't see bullet holes. Not on his head or chest.
- Look all over him.
- All over his body?
Somebody has to.
I'm standing guard.
I'll stand guard. You look.
We'll take turns.
You look over the first dead naked body, I'll look over the second.
Hurry up.
We only got eight minutes.
See anything?
No, I don't see a bullet hole anywhere.
- Hold it. I see something.
- What is it?
Forget it.
Not a bullet hole.
If he wasn't plugged, what about the shots?
- Divide and conquer.
- What?
Another diversion.
He gives us meaningless clues, dangles red herrings...
...bedazzles us with banalities...
...while seconds tick away towards the terrible murder.
You're good. Not my kind of cop, but smart, and you smell good.
You're not a pansy, but what the hell are you?
Classy, I suppose.
- Dames fall for a guy like you.
- I don't see...
Ever make it with a waitress?
A waitress.
Big, fat waitress.
I don't know about society dames...
...but you ain't had it till you made it with a big waitress.
If you're ever interested, you give me a call.
Bizarre little twit.
I'm still not sure about this guy.
- What are you doing?
- I have to wash...
I'll be out in a minute.
I'll go ahead.
I'll tell the others.
You're never gonna believe this, folks.
All right, where are you?
What the hell is going on here?
Wash up later.
We got problems.
Locked from the inside.
That can only mean one thing...
...and I don't know what it is.
You're never gonna believe...
I'll be out in a minute.
I don't remember closing that door.
What happened?
What were the gunshots?
Did anybody leave since we were gone?
- It happened to you too.
- Where's my Dickie?
Sorry. Where's my husband?
Two minutes to midnight, if anyone is interested.
It ain't possible, I say.
Eight people in a dining room can't turn into an empty room unless...
- Unless what, Sam?
- Unless it never happened.
I see your point, Diamond.
When is a room with people not a room with people?
- When it is two dining rooms.
- Exactly!
Two dining rooms?
Two dining rooms, two everything.
Twain electronic genius.
He's devised a way to move the room...
...silently, in the flash of an eye...
...to be replaced by an exact duplicate.
- I knew it all the time.
- Please.
I'll demonstrate.
I'll walk out the door...
...close it, knock three times, enter, and you will all be gone. Observe.
I have it figured out.
There are two of everything.
Dickie, that's old news.
Everybody take their seats.
- I'm scared, Sam. Hold me.
- Hold yourself. I'm busy.
Take the same seats from before.
Forty seconds!
I'm very worried about Mr. Perrier.
I'll look for him.
No. Sit, please.
No one to leave room.
The other door.
It's locked. I can't open it.
Hurry, man!
We have 15 seconds!
Move your hand, chauffeur.
Don't ask.
- Why are you wearing the butler's outfit?
- I said don't ask! I don't know.
It all happened too quickly.
The cook.
Where's the cook?
- She's gone.
- Never spoke.
Ten more seconds.
Quickly, sit and join hands.
Impossible for murder to happen without witnesses.
Three... two... one!
It's over.
We're safe and sound.
That's probably the cook.
Come in.
The poor woman's deaf.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Come in!
Not sound like cook to me.
Mr. Twain.
You appear to be wrong.
Nobody here murdered.
Please to come in.
Is he dead?
With that in him, in the long run he's better off.
- Touch nothing!
- Stop that.
We're experienced criminologists.
I find it insulting and redundant to say "touch nothing."
- Quiet, woman.
- Up yours, fella.
Most amusing. Bickering detectives like making giant lamb stew:
- Everything go to pot.
- Be quiet!
Shut up, all of youse!
Nobody move!
- Stay where you are!
- What is it?
I have to go to the can again.
I don't wanna miss nothing.
I'm going too, Sam.
I'd rather do this alone, Tess.
Thanks anyway.
The cook.
What, darling?
It's obvious.
The cook murdered him.
The butler's dead.
All of us were in this room.
No one could get in.
That leaves the cook. Right?
Wrong.
What makes you certain of this?
To drive a knife that far up a man's back, you need a strong arm.
And this arm don't look that strong to me.
- Is that her arm?
- It ain't the pussycat's tail.
Don't be alarmed, miss.
It ain't real.
For that matter, neither is the cook.
I found this before I got to the can.
Got a little surprise for you folks.
- Look!
- A mannequin!
A dummy, perfect in every detail...
...with the exception of not being able to make her speak.
Hats off to the man with the shiv in his back.
Except that he's dead, he's no dope.
Nice going, Sam.
I hope you realize that someone in this room is a murderer.
For sake of ladies present...
...may we return to drawing room?
My son will cover up Mr. Twain.
- Why do I do the work?
- Your mother not here to do it.
Come, please.
Excuse me.
I'm getting a headache. Isn't there a way to turn off that machine?
Maybe some gadget outside the window.
It's raining this time.
Let's get to business and sort the facts.
It is now 12:30 Sunday morning.
The doors and windows will open at dawn.
One of us will be a million dollars richer...
...and one will go to the gas chamber to hang.
One, Monsieur Perrier? Why not two?
We all have associates.
Why not six or eight?
I don't trust any of youse.
Maybe I'm a patsy set up for a fall, but I'm not falling for youse.
Not even me?
Why don't you fall in love with the Jap kid and get off my back?
Can we get back to case, please?
Time is late and my eyes are getting tired.
- Thought they always looked like that.
- Knock it off!
Sorry. This case is getting on my nerves. I'm sorry, slanty.
Thank you. Now then, facts, please, facts.
Mr. Twain predicts murder. Predicts victim to be at table, correct?
Correct.
This is official.
Correct.
Predicts murder to take place at midnight and number of stab wounds.
How, if he not in collaboration with murderer?
- What if Twain did it himself?
- Murdered himself?
For what possible reason?
And how?
The motive is simple: Ego.
If we weren't to solve this, he'd be the world's best detective.
With an ego like his, that he died for it is a small price to pay.
Any man who can create this chamber of electronic marvels...
...would be able to devise a machine to stab him in the back 12 times.
That was wonderful.
I'm so proud.
- Let's go to bed, quickly.
- One moment.
Very interesting theory...
...but you overlook one very important point.
- And that is?
- It's stupid.
It's most stupid theory
I ever heard!
- Do you have a better one?
- Yeah, much better one.
You see, I have been doing my homework.
For example,
I have information...
...that your wife's portfolio of stocks...
...was seriously depleted in financial crisis.
In short, you are flat broke.
You've been borrowing for two years...
...at 17% interest from Mr. Lionel Twain.
Broke? Is this true?
I was saving it for your birthday.
One million dollars would buy...
...great many tight suits, would it not?
- See here, Wang...
- Dead broke?
Almost, darling.
I have $1.17 and some stamps.
But I didn't murder Twain.
You do believe that?
- We'll talk. We'll see.
- It could have been any one of you.
Each one of us was out of that room at one time...
...giving ample opportunity to commit the crime.
As for motives, there's more than ego and cash.
For example, revenge.
Meaning what, Mr. Charleston?
I'm not the only one who's had a past experience with Twain.
He was quite a ladies' man in his day.
Are you suggesting someone here...
Was once in love with Lionel Twain.
He was engaged to and jilted...
...Miss Jessica Marbles.
Jesus H. Christ!
Jilted 54 years ago at the altar.
Left her there in that same tweed outfit.
- Is this true, Jessie?
- I was not jilted.
I walked out on him.
He wanted to fool around before the wedding.
And being the lady you are, you refused.
Not completely. But it got out of hand.
He was horrid, but I didn't kill him.
That's good enough for me.
What about you?
I'm not a Frenchy!
I'm a Belgy!
And as for other motives, how about patricide?
The killing of one's own parent?
You mean that Lionel Twain was the father of someone in this room?
He wasn't my father.
He was my uncle.
He was very good to me.
He would take me to the circus and give me candy.
We stopped going when I was about 26.
I'm sorry, Sam.
Twenty-six?
What kind of a circus was it?
Forgive me, but I was talking about patricide, not uncle-cide.
Twain may have been your uncle...
...but he was the illegitimate father of...
...Monsieur Sidney Wang!
It not true.
I was adopted.
I have my papers.
That is why I have adopted all my children.
I was wondering.
He loved me very much...
...but he was not very observant.
One day when I was 19, he called me to his study...
...noticed for first time I was
Oriental, and kicked me out.
- I could have...
- Killed him, Wang?
As easily as you,
Monsieur Perrier.
Lionel Twain killed the only thing you ever loved:
Marie-Louise Cartier.
Your sweetheart?
My poodle.
He was a most cruel man.
Monsieur would come to France every season...
...to hunt poodles.
The day they brought...
...her bloodied collar to me,
I vowed I would...
- Knock him off?
- Yes, gladly, if I had the chance.
But I did not.
Someone here beat me to it.
There's more than one reason that we was invited here.
Not only was Twain testing us as detectives...
...but we all have motives for doing him in.
Have not yet heard your motive, Mr. Diamond.
My motive is unimportant.
Let's say that I hated him enough to kill him.
You are closed man, Mr. Diamond.
You hide many things.
Could it be that Mr. Twain discover your secret?
I don't know what you're talking about.
We know different, do we not, Miss Skeffington?
Twain picked up Sam in a gay bar.
I was working on a case. Working.
Every night for six months?
I got 50 bucks a day and expenses.
I hate them queeries.
Twain...
...had Polaroid pictures of Sam in drag.
I was in disguise.
Lots of dames go in those joints.
I never kissed nobody.
I never did nothing to a man that I wouldn't do to a woman.
And I didn't kill Twain.
Bitch.
Most interesting.
All had perfect motives for killing Twain.
Wonder which one was one who done it.
We still have the night to get through.
If anyone's going to solve this,
I say we get a good night's sleep.
And I suggest we all lock our doors.
One of us is a mad killer...
...and not to be trusted.
Who do you think is the murderer?
Must sleep on it.
Will know in morning when wake up.
What if you don't wake up?
Then you did it.
Go sleep, please.
- Good night, Dad.
- Should have adopted pussycat.
Should I turn off the steam, Pop?
Not steam.
Someone just put deadly snake in room.
Wake me when it come near bed.
I want you to know, Dickie, if you're the murderer...
...I’ll still love you.
It wouldn't be right for us to make love, but I'd love you.
No fear of that, pet.
Let's see what we have here.
We have one missing, dead, naked butler...
...one host with a knife in his back...
...and one scorpion crawling up our sheets.
- Is that what that is?
- They can kill instantly.
I suggest we don't move.
For how long?
Quite possibly for the rest of our lives.
Good heavens!
I know who the murderer is.
Solvey-poo?
Yes, Miss Withers.
The murderer is...
Good God! Gas!
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
I'm old.
No, no. The other kind of gas.
The kind that kills.
- Sometimes my gas...
- It's seeping in through the vent!
It's locked from the outside.
Help!
Doesn't smell that bad to me.
Help!
Did I do right, Sam, telling them about the gay bar?
Perfect. They took the bait like a dumb halibut. Let them think I'm a pansy.
While they're suspecting me, one of them will let his pants down.
Why do you keep all those naked muscle men magazines in your office?
Suspects.
Always looking for suspects.
What's that ticking sound I hear?
"That ticking sound is a bomb that will go off in 30 seconds.
- Signed, the murderer."
- The door!
"P.S. The door is locked."
I'm sorry about this, Tess.
- Me owing you all that money too.
- That's all right. What will we do?
I got an idea.
I don't know if this will work.
Turn around!
- I'm turned.
- Whatever you do, don't turn back.
- If anything...
- Do as I say.
- I will, Sam.
- Good. Because I think I'm gonna cry.
- What are you doing in my bed?
- There's no place to sleep.
Sleep in the car, you chauffeur.
Unfair. I will tell everyone you wear a toupee.
- They already know.
- Why do you wear it?
I didn't know you knew.
Certainly I know.
It's a terrible toupee.
A bomb. Across the hall.
Quickly, the door!
It's locked from the outside.
You look taller to me.
Why is that?
Monsieur, I'm not getting taller.
If you aren't getting taller, there's one alternative.
The room is getting shorter!
The ceiling is coming down!
- What'll we do?
- I don't know!
But this is exactly how they make goose liver pâté.
Not so fast, please.
Do not cross out Wang name.
Cross out "snake" instead.
Nice shot, Pop. Sure wish you weren't such a heavy sleeper.
And now...
...if you please.
One million dollars...
...Mr. Bensonmum.
Banzai, Pop!
Very clever of you, Mr. Wang.
Oh, yes.
As you can see, I can see.
So I see.
Tell me, as the only survivor, how did you deduce it was me?
Went back to theory seldom used today:
Butler did it.
I hadn't thought of that.
How do you account for my dead body?
Body made of plastic, same as plastic cook.
While we examine plastic butler...
...you murder Lionel Twain.
You're a clever little laundry man, Mr. Wang.
But not quite clever enough!
I'll take that one million dollars,
Bensonmum...
...alias Irving Goldman.
Irving Goldman?
Yes.
Irving Goldman was the attorney of the late Lionel Twain.
Lionel Twain died five years ago.
His body was discovered in Goldman's filing cabinet.
Am I correct, Mr. Goldman?
Yeah. Correct, Miss Marbles.
But how did you escape the poison gas?
Quite simple.
I covered my mouth...
...and let Miss Withers here breathe in all the gas.
- Sicky-poo.
- Yes, dear, I know.
- The million dollars, please.
- I wouldn't, Goldman.
Or is it Goldman?
Actually, it's Mr. Marvin Metzner.
Marvin Metzner?
Very good, Mr. Charleston.
But how did you know?
The bill in the dead butler's hand stating the weekend had been catered.
- Only an accountant would keep that.
- Get the money and let's go.
Goldman died last month while skiing.
He jumped 200 feet into a low-flying plane.
I can't wait much longer.
You've not lost your touch,
Mr. Charleston.
But how did you elude the deadly scorpion?
We didn't.
He stung Dora.
- We have 15 minutes to reach a doctor.
- Explain later.
We'll make it. Never fear.
The prize money.
Belongs to me, monsieur.
Marcel, being one of the world's strongest men...
...stopped your ceiling from crushing us at four feet, five inches.
It may be months before we're able to straighten again...
...but a million dollars will buy a lot of back braces.
Eh, Miss Irene Twain?
Daughter of Lionel!
What?
I prefer to be called Rita.
But how did you know?
Never underestimate a Frenchman's nostrils, Miss Twain.
At dinner tonight...
...I smelled your Chanel No. 5.
You did away with all of them:
Metzner, Goldman and your father.
If you had your way...
...you'd do away with all men, would you not, Miss Twain?
Men who have made you suffer...
...because you were born with brains...
...talent, money, everything but that which you most desired:
Beauty.
It is a statement of fact...
...that as a man you are passable, but as a woman...
...you are a dog.
That's your opinion, big boy.
And now my money, please.
With luck, I can still make dinner at Maxim's.
I'd just order a tuna sandwich...
...because that dough is mine.
That's right, I'm alive.
Miss Skeffington dropped your bomb down the john.
It blew up as she flushed.
The seat missed her head by an inch.
I'm all right, J.J.
J. J?
That's right, folks.
He outsmarted us all.
Sitting behind that desk is the real Sam Diamond.
My name is Loomis.
J.J. Loomis. I'm an actor.
I do impressions.
I did the Carson show six times last year.
Diamond hired me for the weekend.
Miss Skeffington is Vilma Norman.
She's a cocktail waitress at the Water Bed Motel in Carmel.
Diamond hated all of you.
You're getting big money, and he had that office in San Francisco.
If he proved he was number one, he'd get your clients.
But since I put all the pieces together...
...I figure that money belongs to me.
Isn't that right, Mr. Diamond?
Wrong.
That would've been so obvious, a child could have guessed.
No, colleagues.
What you seem to overlook...
...is the most simple and direct solution.
That I am indeed Lionel Twain.
You've all been so clever for so long...
...you've forgotten to be humble.
You've tricked and fooled your readers for years.
You've tortured us with surprise endings that made no sense.
You've introduced characters at the end that weren't in the book before!
You've withheld clues and information...
...that made it impossible for us to guess who did it.
But now the tables are turned.
Millions of angry mystery readers...
...are now getting their revenge.
When the world learns
I've outsmarted you...
...they'll be selling your $1.95 books for 12 cents.
It's checkout time, ladies and gentlemen.
I have your bills ready.
Credit cards will be accepted.
- Even the scorpion was a fake?
- Everything. The bridge, the maid.
- But you're sure about the scorpion?
- Positive.
Even the fog. He made that with a dry ice machine. See.
How awfully unromantic.
Then if he really was Lionel Twain...
...you must really be Sam Diamond.
- That's right, baby.
I was in disguise, in disguise, in disguise.
You work hard for
50 bucks in this racket.
I guess that means we won't see each other again.
Well, that depends.
I'll be around if you need me.
All you gotta do is whistle.
- You know how to whistle, don't you?
- Certainly. What do you mean?
Never mind. Forget it.
You ruined it.
I don't understand.
Was there a murder or wasn't there?
Yes. Killed good weekend.
Drive, please.

THE HYPOTHESIS
OF THE STOLEN PAINTING
Human consciousness has expired.
On the cadaver he squats,
gloating, mired.
Seated in triumph, he turns to crow.
Each time
he deals the corpse a blow.
Victor Hugo
What do you see? What do you feel?
Is it pain or is it ecstasy
that keeps you afloat in space?
P.K. BAPH. VI. 141.
No sinister adjuncts
lend their banal significance.
No hint of melodrama
injects its facile role.
Simply by interpreting
in his sober, magisterial style,
the dynamism of these figures and
by capturing gesture and attitude,
the painter reveals
the ardent fanaticism of these men,
their implacable purpose.
J. Alboise in L'Artiste, 1889.
Ingenious,
somewhat studied compositions
recalling the witty groupings
employed with felicity by Gérôme.
Adding a novelist's skills
to those of the painter,
he plays cleverly
on our curiosity as spectators
who arrived too late.
M.F. Lajenevais,
Revue des Deux Mondes, 1889.
Rare is the artist so assured
of the present and the future.
He is not merely an instinctive
master of composition.
His sense of history preserves him
from the pitfalls
of dusty scholarship.
It was also said,
"Always a painter,
Monsieur Tonnerre
"is now an artist, in the highest sense of the word."
And yet...
Alas! And yet...
How could such paintings
provoke a scandal?
And yet...
How is it
that only six paintings...
Seven.
How is it that a simple scandal,
a mere stir in fashionable Paris
became transformed
into an affair of state?
Alas.
Today we look and look again
at these paintings.
There is nothing shocking
about them,
no common link between them,
not even a unity in style.
In some,
the striking thing
is the attention to detail
but also a lack of care
in the overall composition.
In others,
the flowing strokes
and vivid colours
but also the static quality
of the compositions.
Y et others indulge
the excessive illusionism
of a theatrical décor
but also
seem contradictory
in their composition.
That these six paintings should pose
such questions is understandable.
Seven paintings.
But a scandal,
intervention by the authorities...
Alas! Thrice alas!
And yet...
And yet only seven paintings preserve their mute testimony.
A scandal so great
that the authorities,
for once in agreement,
felt impelled to bury it.
The press was silent,
spies infiltrated the salons
and others, diversionary scandals,
seemingly by chance,
overtook the people
most concerned with these paintings
executed more or less skilfully
by an obscure disciple of Gérôme:
the painter Tonnerre.
Two comments...
Two comments concerning the paintings.
And two further comments.
Two further comments, but these of a more general nature.
Firstly, the seven paintings do have a common factor.
Although one of them was the object of particularly virulent attacks
- we shall see why our parents were driven to react in this way - and although two or three others among the paintings were held to be purely and simply shocking, the fact is that the scandal centred on the exhibition as a whole.
On all the paintings, each and every one of them.
Secondly, if we closely examine each painting in turn, we cannot but be struck by a number of curious details.
This one, for example.
We see two Crusaders in the act of playing chess.
The composition is theatrical, you say.
Yes, but what does that mean,
"theatrical?"
The gestures?
The positioning of the figures?
No, not at all.
The effect you describe as theatrical derives from one simple detail: the lighting.
From the two rays of light, one entering by the window on the right, the other by the window on the left.
Which implies a world with two suns.
This, I might add, is only one example.
To turn now to the two comments of a more general nature.
Let us consider the historical context and say, firstly, the paintings did not show, they alluded.
And what our fathers saw, at the point when the eight powers intervened, was The Ceremony.
And, at that time in ceremony, whose ritual is now lost, which today we can scarcely begin to imagine, the ceremony was on the verge of becoming a matter of common knowledge.
This could not go on.
Which is why, some months after the exhibition, police raided the painter's house and burst in on the ceremony.
And why the authorities had no alternative.
They had to act quickly.
Secondly, the painter Tonnerre defended himself.
From Italy, he made his appeal.
Affectingly, by letter, he declared his innocence.
Cleverly, he turned the rules of the game upside down.
He declared that the ceremony did not exist.
That what was known by that name, what the police saw with their own eyes was merely a re-enactment of his paintings through medium of tableaux vivants, no more no less.
We can imagine today what the reaction to this defence must have been within the ranks of the eight powers.
We can guess how some people must have smiled ironically and others laughed quite openly.
It was inevitable that our parents should have reacted in this way.
But we have other means of analysis today.
And I think I know what the painter Tonnerre really meant to say when he protested his innocence.
Guilty as sin, he was.
What a terrible revelation.
They were the ceremony.
And yet...
The paintings do not show, they allude.
The paintings... re-enacted through the medium of tableaux vivants do not allude.
They show.
After opening the door
the collector shows us
into a drawing-room
overlooking a large garden.
He approaches the window.
With the aid of binoculars,
we can see at the foot of the garden
the reproduction of a mythological
scene in a tableau vivant.
Near a lake,
the Huntress muses with her bow.
Sheltered by the foliage,
Actaeon's eyes
waver between this vision of Diana
and a glimpse of his prey.
Is the third figure
really necessary?
Why this third person?
And why does he hold a mirror?
Well, the mirror you mention would have been to dazzle the prey.
In this sense the role of the third figure in the Diana and Actaeon would assume an unexpected importance.
It will indeed have escaped no one that, extraneous to the scene, this third figure invades it purely to watch the watcher.
In another sense, it is not impossible that the prey is none other than Actaeon himself, metamorphosed as a punishment for having dared cast his eye on the goddess.
Y et what is there in this painting
to make us think
it is the first of a series?
What leads us from it
to the one we may consider
the next in sequence?
At the risk of upsetting a somewhat facile train of thought,
I would like to inject a certain doubt.
Suppose the Diana the Huntress theme were merely a red herring.
Suppose the anomalous elements were merely snares.
And that the trail must be sought elsewhere.
A trail indicated by a detail, minor but nevertheless exposed to full view.
Let us allow that, as an absurd piece of hunting equipment, the mirror offers a thematic clue which might further our pursuit.
The collector is asking us
to ignore the narrative element,
the arrangement of objects
and even the object
of the character's scrutiny.
Look at the mirror.
The mirror reflects the sun's rays.
Let us trace their direction.
Here we see the sun's rays
reflected by the mirror
and falling onto a basement window.
A game of chess is interrupted
by the arrival of a Crusader.
One then realizes that the sun is
entering by the window on the left
while the same rays, reflected by the
mirror from the preceding painting
are cast on the scene
through the window opposite.
Thus the riddle of the two
contradictory rays is solved.
The Arrival of the Crusader.
I think that the untenable aspect of the theme will not have escaped anyone.
Whence comes this Crusader?
What does he interrupt?
How, coming directly from the Crusades, could he burst in on the scene and surprise the players?
And these players, what are they hiding that they should be surprised by the arrival of a new character?
A new character...
The disturbing presence of the page will, I think, have escaped no one.
The page who makes a great show of his consternation before the other characters in the painting whereas we, and we alone, can glimpse his secret smile.
If we accept
that this painting follows
the preceding one in the series,
which can we take to be the next,
and why?
I think you will have noticed that the characters are Templars.
As you see, the painter has respected the hierarchy within the Order.
Let us now consider this hierarchy.
On the lowest level, almost marginal to the composition, is the page.
Then the two Templars, equal before the Grand Master.
Respecting the painter's intentions, let us carefully observe the Grand Master.
What is his attitude?
Let us examine with renewed attention each detail of his clothes, the severity of his eye, the clenched left hand.
Let us accept the astonishing gesture of his right, indicating the mirror.
A mirror reflecting what?
The window behind which,
in the first painting,
another mirror reflects the sun
shining through
this painting's window.
Crude conjecture.
Perhaps one might now venture the
hypothesis of a group of paintings
whose interconnection
is ensured by a play of mirrors.
Conjecture.
One might see the painter's oeuvre
as a reflection
on the art of reproduction.
Certainly not. That is not the way to look at this painting.
The effect must be considered in a totally different way.
Otherwise we shall become entangled in the snare set for us.
In this particular case, the thing to be considered is the form of the mirror.
With due care, however, for therein lies another snare.
We must not linger over the significance of this form to the theme.
It is common knowledge, more common within each day, that the crescent moon is a Saracen symbol.
No one can fail to be aware that the presence of so impious a token within the Order is surprising, to say the least.
Today, though they find it difficult to accept, everyone knows that the presence of this token in the Order was, alas, probable.
But this is of no consequence.
None of this matters.
What matters is the form itself, the fact that this crescent should be reproduced in another painting which I now invite you to consider.
A series of paintings
linked by minor details
sometimes skilfully inserted
extraneously to the theme:
the ray of light in the mirror,
the second mirror
in the shape of a crescent.
And now...
I would like to draw your attention to the extreme care with which the painter has placed the mirror.
So that it is really impossible to err in arranging the tableau vivant.
Is such care likely?
What else is the painter's purpose but to draw our attention to what is reflected in the mirror when the tableau is arranged?
Look, it is he one sees reflected in the mirror.
But now let us consider the lighting effects.
The chiaroscuro, obviously, is arbitrary.
Why should certain figures, perhaps not the most important, be privileged and others remain a shadow?
But setting aside the lighting, let us concentrate on the figures.
All becomes clear.
Let us reverse the lighting.
Let what was plunged in shadow emerge into the light and what was clearly visible return to the darkness.
The mask.
There is the link with the next painting.
We must then ask:
which is that painting
and why does the mask lead us to it?
Now the collector explains
that this painting does not exist.
That it is the stolen painting
and that all we know of it
is that there was a mask.
A certain number of problems
now present themselves.
If the previous painting
does indeed lead us to this one,
then obviously there will be
a hiatus in the series.
And with the trail lost,
how can we establish
the order of the paintings?
No one will ever know what in this painting was to have led us to the one I postulate as the next in the series.
Here is the scandalous painting
rejected by the Salon in 1887.
Apparently exhibited in private,
it was, inexplicably,
acquired by the state.
What, in this painting, could have provoked a scandal?
Was it enough simply to show people of some social prominence in attitudes which are in fact quite commonplace while claiming that they had agreed to act as models for the painting?
Might this painting not be interpreted as a means of stifling the rumours which lay behind the scandal and which tarnished the reputation of a respectable family?
But in that case, where would the scandal lie?
Maybe... the fact of having posed for this scene from family life, no matter how commonplace or innocent it be, maybe this fact in itself was felt to be totally unacceptable.
In fact, although the scenes are indeed commonplace, it is nevertheless true that the fact of having exhibited themselves, the fact of having assembled the protagonists of a scandal might be interpreted as ostentation, as acknowledging and condoning what public opinion would have described as an "unspeakable vice".
But are these scenes indeed so innocent?
Can we assert that they are entirely free from certain obscurities?
Who knows but that these scenes reveal aspects of the scandal instantly recognizable to the initiated?
There is certainly something disturbing about these scenes from daily life.
We may note that in each of them someone has just committed, or is preparing to commit,
That in both cases, a third character is in the act of watching and that through his air of frank disapproval, this character provokes the desire to commit the forbidden act.
A disapproval that he displays to the spectator but conceals from the characters.
Perhaps in order to guard himself against any eventual accusation of complicity.
The grouping tells us, however,
that those who have been
discovered, as it were,
are pointedly turning their backs
on the spy.
Knowing this,
and accepting this situation,
the spy therefore
does indeed participate
as an accomplice
in the public exposition
of the moments
preceding and following
the reprehensible act.
And since the reprehensible aspect of this act resides in the intention, is not the exposition of these moments much more so?
Does this not open up limitless possibilities for interpretation?
Possibilities reaching beyond the act itself, which, as we need not now deny, did indeed take place.
But was this not enough to provoke a scandal?
Furthermore,
I should add that these events and public rumours have come down to us by way of a little roman-à-clef.
A brief résumé of this little novel will give us some idea of the enormity of the events which rumour endeavoured to conceal.
The beginning of the novel describes a betrothal scene.
Tha Marquise de I. has invited her friends to a reception to announce the engagement of her niece O. who is also her ward, to the Marquis de E., a friend of the family.
The Marquise is presented from the outset as a domineering woman swayed by vaulting ambition.
The anonymous author makes no secret of his sympathy for the Marquis, portrayed as a man of thirty-five, kindly by nature and forced by the ruin of his family into a marriage of convenience.
The Marquis is shown as the victim of a cunning plot devised entirely by the Marquise de I.
At the end of the first chapter the Marquise suspects her niece's betrothed of a questionable interest in young L., her nephew and ward.
The latter is described as a boy of very winning ways not entirely unaware of the interest he has awakened in the Marquis de E.
The author has earlier informed us that the Marquise had planned to marry the two cousins, the young L. and the young O., thus uniting the fortunes of the collateral branches of the family.
In securing her niece's hand, the Marquis de E. spoiled her plan.
But her discovery of the interest shown in the boy by the Marquis leads her to devise the sinister plot which is revealed in Chapter Two.
This is to encourage the relationship between the Marquis and young L. in order to provoke a scandal which, by ruining the reputation of the Marquis, would make impossible the marriage to the girl O.
At this point, matters are complicated by the entry of a new character,
El Señor de H.,
Knight of the Order of Malta and Spanish envoy to the Holy See.
Since this person is also attracted by young L., he provokes the jealousy and rivalry of the Marquis de E.
E. and H., being friends of long standing in view of their affiliation to the same secret society, agree to settle their quarrel through a game of chess with the loser undertaking to renounce all claim to the hypothetical favours of the boy L.
The betrothed girl happens to witness this scene.
Perceiving the disquieting implications of the scene without really understanding, she tells to her aunt.
The latter, we learn in Chapter
Four, is now resolved to act.
In pursuance of her plan, she therefore summons the Marquis.
Arriving at the appointed place, the Marquis finds the Marquise partially unclothed challengingly exhibiting herself before his eyes.
Understanding the allusion to his lack of interest in the fair sex, he loses his temper and offers to strike her.
The girl, witnessing the scene, assumes it to be a lovers' quarrel.
Convinced that she is betrayed, she determines to confront her aunt.
In Chapter Five, realizing that she has aroused new feelings between the betrothed, the Marquise summons the girl O. to a clandestine meeting.
At this meeting, the Marquise apprises the girl of her fiancé's unnatural tastes.
Seeing this revelation as a mere stratagem to part her from him, the girl reacts violently.
Their quarrel is witnessed by H. who decides to propose an alliance with the Marquise with a view to alienating the boy L. from the Marquis.
Thus it is that, for the fist time in the story, young L. takes the initiative and confesses his love to the Marquise.
This scene is witnessed by the girl, now doubly jealous of her aunt but unable to choose in her heart between young L. and the Marquis.
She confides in her fiancé.
These revelations cause the Marquis to fall into a deep depression intensified when he witnesses a strange scene between young L. and H.
In this scene,
H., a stag's head in his hand, is attempting to persuade the boy to pose as Diana the Huntress.
The Marquis, bursting in the scene, provokes his friend H. to anger.
He reproaches him with his lack of integrity in failing to keep his promise to renounce the boy.
Intervening to reproach E. for having abandoned him to a foreigner, the boy aggravates the quarrel.
In Chapter Ten, we come to the scene of the duel between E. and H. during the course of which young L. is simultaneously arbiter, second, sponsor and occasion of the duel.
In despair, believing herself the cause of the duel, O. intervenes.
While the Marquise watches from a distance, at last savouring the scandal she has anticipated for months.
Unfortunately, both adversaries miss their mark and H.'s bullet accidentally wounds the girl O.
Police arrest the protagonists but intervention of E.'s family secures their prompt release.
Accused of attempted homicide and obliged to plead insanity to escape the law,
H. is confined to an asylum not far from Paris.
In the penultimate chapter, we find the girl O. affected by her wound.
In the delirium of her fever she sees herself as St. Theresa and her cousin as the angel conducting her to heaven.
The Marquis visits her, but seeing him as the devil himself, she repulses him violently.
In renewed delirium, now imagining herself to be a Babylonian harlot, young O. repulses her angel of redemption and still seeing the Marquis as the devil, implores him to conduct her to hell thus obeying a command given by St Theresa.
Following a long and grievous convalescence,
O. forgives the Marquis de E.
We find all the characters assembled at a family gathering.
Suddenly Señor H. reappears, having fled the asylum with the aid of members of the secret society, alerted by the Marquise.
H. publicly accuses E. of failing to keep his promise by continuing to importune young L.
The latter intervenes to accuse H. of alienating him from his aunt.
The girl O., finally grasping the situation, breaks with E.
But the story does not end as the Marquise would have wished.
That very night, the boy L. is carried off by H. aided by members of the sect and taken to their mansion in the rue de la Pompe.
Promptly alerted by the Marquise, the police intervene and interrupt a strange ceremony involving young L. as both priest and sacrifice.
The protagonists all find themselves in prison and are released on payment of a substantial bail.
Young L. is found hanged in his cell and the talk is either of suicide or a crime.
Can we accept that what lies behind
these paintings is merely a novel?
We can then say
that the protagonists
simply portrayed the novel's theme
as if it were a ceremony.
We have not yet seen or said everything.
Two paintings remain.
We have travelled a difficult road
to come this far.
Will we manage
to travel it to the end?
Will we remember all the arguments
and counter-arguments developed?
Will we have time
to expound other doubts,
to point out the innumerable
thematic clues to the intrigue?
In this painting we may perceive certain elements of previous paintings.
This group, for instance, recalls the painting
Tortures of the Inquisition.
This one, The Game of Chess.
This character evokes Diana the Huntress.
But the other characters?
The naked women?
The clowns and demons?
We shall explain them through the hypothesis of the stolen painting.
The collector
once again requires us
to forget the thematic clue
and to concentrate
on the composition.
In this painting, as in the preceding ones, characters are grouped in threes.
Each group of three recalls a scene from an earlier painting, although there is, so to speak, no linking story.
Let us turn our minds
back to the previous painting.
From there,
let us follow the thematic clue.
We see that the story
moves from painting to painting
like the hands of a watch.
Let us ask where this series of
scenes from family life is taking us.
We will now examine the characters
of the scandalous painting.
Let us trace
each character's gestures,
painting by painting.
We now see that, in moving
from one painting to the next,
the characters
are slowly completing the circle,
each in his own way.
The circle is not perfect, you will say.
But what we have here are really curves which form circles of unequal diameter if completed by imagination.
And these circles may be classified roughly in three groups, of decreasing importance.
And the circles of each group are combined, their respective product is, of course, a sphere.
Spheres which we can in turn imagine as combined or not but which still evoke spheres.
But any movement
effected by a human being
leaves an imaginary trace
comparable to a curve.
We shall return to this.
Curved lines which suggest circles.
Circles leading to the sphere.
The blazing sphere which dominates
the last painting in the series.
Baphomet, an androgynous demon.
The principle of non-definition.
In defiance of time.
An immaculate body without soul caressed by the breezes which are wandering, bodiless souls.
Assailed through the seven orifices by wandering souls seeking their reincarnation.
Souls already despairing of the day of resurrection.
Is this not what we have seen repeated in all the paintings?
Is it not the very heart of the paintings, their occult theme?
The real cause of the scandal?
Worshipped by the Templars, religion within a religion of a state within a state?
Still worshipped today in secret ceremonies masquerading as mere debauches.
So that is the real reason
for the scandal?
It is.
But if all the paintings portray
the cult of the androgyne,
what is the role of the painting
Diana the Huntress?
I shall explain through the hypothesis of the stolen painting.
The collector, visibly exhausted,
now invites us to consider
the Tonnerres
from a fresh standpoint.
What you have seen are merely some of the ideas these paintings have inspired in me over the years.
Hence, perhaps, their fragmentary nature.
But today... now that I have once again recreated The Ceremony for you, a doubt assails me.
And I ask myself if the effort was worthwhile.
I have, I confess, many doubts.
The enigma has been solved, certainly, and that should satisfy us.
But we are not satisfied.
What matters to us, we humble mortals, that the authorities should fear the celebration of a cult because this cult is the expression of something more vast?
What matters to us, we humble creatures of this world, if this "something more vast" be a revival of the cult of Mithras?
Can we summon interest in the fact that a cult like this is, in effect, the equivalent of military discipline?
And that military manoeuvres, pomp and parades are merely one aspect of the ceremony these paintings complete.
Can we feel fear at the revelation that military life and all that these paintings represent
are the ceremony whose solemn expression signifies the mutual annihilation of the celebrants... total war?
No, I do not think so.
I do not think so.
Any such elucidation would take too long for us to grasp.
Furthermore, the cunning stratagem whereby it is divided in three superimposed riddles would hardly speed us towards our goal.
And yet,
I know that something will be retained.
I know that at this very moment the paintings are beginning to fade from memory.
I know that the snare set by the painter Tonnerre is beginning to show results.
The gestures, the same gestures repeated from painting to painting loom up, in isolation, to better efface the paintings themselves and what they represent.
So, let us forget.
Let us allow the paintings to fade... to vanish... to vanish... so that all that remains is the isolated gestures, the gestures of The Ceremony.
So saying,
the collector
courteously shows us to the door.
Subtitling: B.B. COM - Paris
- Hello.
- Hello, Uncle George.
- Doesn't she look well?
- She always looks good.
All right, old chap, you've made your point.
Lovely to see you!
We haven't moved anything.
Mind the arch.
Yes, I remember.
Damn!
There goes my grand entrance.
Oh, Sarah.
- What was it?
- Did I break it?
- Of course not.
- It wouldn't matter if you had.
- Where is it?
- This goes on the newel post?
- Yes, that's right.
- It's the one thing that is new. I forgot.
- It's all right.
Now I know where it is.
You'll find everything the same up here.
Now...
...nothing has been touched in your room.
But Sandy is going to be sharing with you.
- Just for the first few days.
- Okay.
Well, here we are.
Dinner was wonderful.
Well, just pot luck, I'm afraid.
I've been rather disorganised today.
I wish you'd disorganised that hospital a bit.
- Was the food that awful?
- I didn't eat for five weeks.
I remember when
I was in the hospital...
Sarah, is there anything else you'd like, dear?
You know what I'd like? A nice glass of port to put me off to sleep.
- It's on its way.
- No, I'll get it.
- Let's see if I can find the right bottle.
Yes, of course.
As I was saying, when
I had my appendix out...
We don't want to hear that revolting story again!
It isn't that one.
It's the one about the food.
Sarah, that's the whisky, dear.
Oh, you're right.
Got it.
Right, well, I'll go into the kitchen and help Sandy with the dishes.
- Shall I pour it for you?
- It's okay.
If you don't mind my playing blind man's buff with your vintage port.
Not at all. Help yourself.
Anyhow, if I spill any, it'll match the carpet.
Oh, I've just remembered.
As I was leaving for the station,
Steve rang.
Did he?
Well, I guess it's a bit late to call him right now.
I don't think he'd mind.
Still, I don't feel quite up to it tonight.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Tired?
Well, I did find it rather a strain today.
I can imagine.
I think the hardest part is not rushing to help her every minute.
Well, that's exactly what she wants: no fuss.
The best thing is to let her find her own way, and just not pay her too much attention.
She's very determined to manage herself.
She's certainly your sister's daughter.
I know. She is the same as she was.
A whim of iron.
You don't mind me sharing, do you?
Why should I mind?
Only, er...
Mother thought it would be a good idea until you...
Well, until you get used to things again.
I know. She's right.
You will be a help, Sandy.
- Sarah.
- Mmm?
What's it like?
Bloody awful.
- Good night, Sarah.
- Night.
- Good night.
- Night.
Now, who would do that?
GEORGE". Spoiling things for the sake of spoiling them.
It might have been an accident.
GEORGE". It's envy.
They're not prepared to work so that they can own something worthwhile.
They can't bear the existence of other people who will.
Darling, you'll get it repaired.
Will you please stop going on about it?
If it had been an accident,
I wouldn't mind. Accidents happen.
But this is so bloody nasty.
I just wish I could do something.
- The insurance will pay for it.
- That's not the point.
What happened?
Somebody scratched the car. You'd think the world was coming to an end.
They did it deliberately, that's what I can't get over.
Badly scratched?
The whole of the front end.
You should see...
- You can probably imagine what it's like.
- Life is going to get difficult if you keep trying to eliminate the verb "to see" from your vocabulary.
Yes, I suppose it is. I'm sorry.
It's a shame about the car.
Sarah. A bit further to your left.
You're heading for the cellar door.
Oh!
Right. Thank you.
Honestly, did you ever hear such a fuss?
Oh, you know what men are like with their cars.
You're late.
- Yeah. I missed the bus.
- Catch up, then. There's a good chap.
Fix the mower, then get on with the lawns.
Yeah.
Who is it?
You don't know me, but I know you.
I heard about you.
The name is Barker.
- I've been got in to help your uncle.
- How do you do?
They shot him, didn't they?
The horse.
What do they want to shoot the poor creature for?
They had to.
He broke his leg when we fell.
That's what they say.
Sarah! Sarah!
Telephone. It's Steve.
Here we are.
- It's okay. You're alone.
- Thank you.
Steve?
Welcome home.
I've been waiting for you to call me.
Well, I only arrived last night.
How are things going?
Oh, still finding my way about, falling over the furniture.
I thought I'd pick you up tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Yes. I've got some new horses
I'd like you to meet.
- All right. That will be lovely.
- Okay.
- I'll be over sometime after lunch.
- Right.
- See you tomorrow, then.
- Fine. Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
We may not be here when you get back.
We promised to go over to the Fenners'.
You know how the Fenners drag on.
- Of course.
- Steve's car is coming up the drive.
I'd better go.
I'll take that.
- Ciao.
- Bye-bye, dear. Will you be late back?
I don't know.
- Well, Sandy will be here.
- Right. Slow down.
Uncle George, bye-bye.
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.
Sarah, could you manage here on your own?
I mean, if you got back and I wasn't here, could you manage by yourself for a while?
- Who is he?
- Someone I met in town the other day.
- I promised to meet him. You mind?
- Of course not.
- Are you sure you'll be all right?
- I'll be all right.
Steve.
No, miss. We've got a mare in foal, so Mr Reding sent me.
- He said to apologise.
- Oh, I see.
This way.
Careful! Mind your head getting in.
- Sarah, thanks.
- Okay.
Come on.
Wait. Come on.
Hold it.
Come on. Come on.
- What was that?
- Diddicoys.
Diddicoys. Gippos. Gypsies.
- Don't know why they allow 'em.
- They don't do much harm, surely?
No.
And they don't do much good neither.
Jacko...
Sarah!
Hello.
Hello!
- You look marvellous!
- Thank you.
Come on, let's go to the house.
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
How are you, Sarah?
Well, I'm fine, actually.
Your foal. It's a bad time of year for a foal, isn't it?
Yeah. Yes, it is.
- It'll probably never survive the winter.
- No, not a chance.
When the poor mare gets pregnant, they hand it to me, and expect me to work miracles.
I should have refused, I suppose, but they're such good customers.
Look, Sarah, you know I wanted to visit you.
Yes, I know.
I suppose you had your reasons.
Yeah, I did.
Can't you tell me about them?
It is important to me, you know.
- Yes. What is it?
- It's the mare, Mr Reding.
- Do you want to come along?
- Of course!
Mind the step.
Hey, it's over.
How are they?
Oh, they're all right for now.
Isn't there anything you can do to save the foal?
Oh, there's lots to be done, and it'll be done, but I don't hold out much hope for it.
Hey!
- Hello. He's friendly.
- Yes, he is.
He's one of the new ones.
He's got plenty of spirit.
- What colour is he?
- He's chestnut.
He's your kind of horse.
Can I ride him?
- Of course.
- I mean, now.
Sure. Why not?
Oh!
George.
Don't you think you should be getting ready?
Please hurry, darling.
Remember the traffic last time.
I'll climb in and out of the bath.
Ready in half an hour.
Sandy, do you want some tea before we go?
No, thanks.
I'm going to play some records.
I'm not as brave as I thought I was.
You don't have to be.
Come on, let's get on with it.
Give me your leg.
- Okay?
- Yeah, so far.
All right. I'll take your reins and we'll go on a little walk.
Just relax and see how it goes.
Come on.
How do you feel now?
A lot braver.
- We're in the upper field, right?
- Right.
- And the old oak tree is over there?
- Right again.
Give me the reins.
- Let me see if I can find it.
- All right.
- Betty?
- All right, I'll get it.
I'd forgotten how lovely it is up here.
I shall miss it.
What do you mean?
I'm only here for a few days. I'm going to
London next week on a training course.
Training? What for?
I'm not rich, you know.
I have to work to support myself.
- Yes, but what's the training for?
- Oh, physiotherapy.
There's quite a lot of blind physiotherapists.
And I'd be doing something useful.
Does that mean you'll be staying in London?
Well, I have friends looking for a flat for me now.
I wish you wouldn't, Sarah.
I mean, I thought we might pick up where we left off.
Things aren't quite the same, are they?
No, they're not.
It's not just today. It's something you'd be burdened with forever.
Don't go, Sarah.
No, they'll all be out by now.
So you'll be here on your own?
I'll be all right.
Anyway, I'm not alone.
There's a gardener around somewhere.
Well, I don't know. I think I'll stay.
I'm on my home ground now.
- All right, I'll stop fussing.
- Okay.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Barker!
Barker, I'm making some coffee.
Do you want some?
Barker?
- Who is it?
- It's me, Steve.
Get yourself dressed and come down here.
Steve, it's only seven o'clock!
I was just running a bath.
Leave it. I'll take you as you are.
I've got a surprise.
Okay.
Sandy?
- Steve!
- Good morning.
I had to creep out.
They're all still asleep.
Late night?
They must have had.
I didn't even hear them come in.
Come with me.
What? Where are you taking me?
Never mind.
I've got a surprise for you.
- I forgot it was your birthday.
- My birthday? That was ages ago!
I know. All the more reason.
- Almost there.
- What?
- All right?
- Yes.
Turn around.
I was going to wrap him up, but I ran out of pink ribbon.
Oh, Steve!
Steve!
Happy birthday.
Can I ride him?
Whatever you want. He's yours now.
Yeah.
- Leg up!
- Right.
His name? I don't know his name.
Dandy Star.
Dandy?
You can change it if you want.
Dandy.
Dandy Star.
Okay, we're here.
All right.
- Here, let me do that.
- Okay. Thank you.
Come on, round here. That's it.
- Steve?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
It was all done for an ulterior motive anyway.
- What?
- You've got responsibilities here now.
You can't just leave him and go off to London, can you?
Hmm. See what you mean.
- I'll come over later and bed him down.
- No, I'd like to do it myself.
If I can't manage, Uncle George or Sandy can help me.
Okay, good. Come on.
I've got to go now.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Isn't it time these people got up?
- Oh, let them sleep it off.
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
Bye.
Hello?
Oh.
Hello! Anyone up yet?
Aunt Betty?
Sandy?
Sandy!
Sandy!
No!
Aunt Betty!
Aunt Betty!
Help me. Please, help me.
It's Barker.
Barker.
What happened?
What happened?
Heard a shot.
I started to run towards the house.
There was a man in the doorway.
The kitchen doorway.
I saw the gun go up.
I kept passing out.
I'll go get help.
Corning back.
He... he left something behind.
Coming back for it.
What? What's he left?
Silver bracelet.
On the floor, over there.
Where?
Where?
Right ahead of you.
- Where?!
'Keep going.
Keep going.
I can't find it!
In front of you, to the right.
I found it! Barker!
It's got writing on it.
Engraving.
What does it say?
Barker?
Barker!
Easy, boy.
Home, boy, home.
Dandy!
Dandy!
He"? me!
He"? me!
He"? me!
Please!
Please!
What's the matter?
Come on, dear.
Come on.
That's better. Better if you cry.
Get it all out if you cry.
Now, darling.
Now, that's all right, lovely.
No one's gonna harm you.
Come, darling, drink this.
Come on, you drink it.
Now, now, now, now, now.
Shhh.
It's all better. It's all gone.
Shhhhhh.
Where? Which house?
Manor Farm.
Here, that's the place where Jack...
You don't know who this bloke was?
You heard him, but you don't know who he was?
Wait.
His?
I don't know. I think so.
There's writing on it, a name.
- What does it say?
- There ain't no name on it.
No, there's writing on it.
What does it say?
It's blank! I'm taking you to the police.
Two steps.
Now slide across.
Tom.
Don't worry, Mother.
I'll take care of everything.
What's happened?
He must have slipped his halter.
I suppose so.
Let's have a look at him.
There's some blood over here.
There's no cut.
No.
Call the Rextons and tell them
I'm coming. You two come with me.
- Max, take care of the horse.
- Right, sir.
Come on, we're here.
Where is this?
Where are you taking me?
- Never you mind.
- Wait! No, don't. No, don't!
Get in there!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Let's go and check the house.
In here, governor.
That bloody fool! I told him to stay away from there!
- He went there last night but wouldn't...
- I've got to find him!
Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
Roll everything up. We're moving out.
Right, son.
A maniac's on the loose. I'll drop you at the phone down the road.
Get the police up here.
We'll look for Sarah.
Help! Anybody, help!
Help, anybody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Wait a minute, governor.
Switch off the engine a minute.
I thought I heard something.
No, I guess not.
Hang on, governor. There!
You're right.
It's over by the old clay pit.
Sarah!
It's all right.
You'll soon feel more relaxed.
Just rest.
Complete rest and quiet.
Thank you.
I'll look in and see you this evening.
Right.
Would you like something to help you sleep?
No, thank you.
All right. Goodbye. See you later.
Goodbye. Thank you, doctor.
Oh, doctor...
...would it be all right if I had a bath?
Oh, yes, but keep the pressure off your foot.
Okay.
Jack, get in here!
- Yeah, but...
- Come here!
Yeah, well, I'll see you, all right?
Go on. Go on, Jack, off with your big brother.
What's up, Tom?
Where are you going?
To the house?
The police are taking care of that.
I'll leave someone with you.
- Where are you going?
- I'll see you later.
Steve!
We're looking for a gypsy.
A gippo?
Is that all she said, a gippo?
Well, there's a camp down Hulcote Wood.
Yes, it'll be quicker to go cross country. We'll take the horses.
No, not you. You stay here and make sure she's all right.
Come on!
- Please.
- You went to the house!
- No, Tom, listen to me.
- You went up to the house!
All right, I went up there! I went there!
And you left this! You stupid, murdering bungler, you left this!
But it isn't mine.
Listen, I gave mine to the girl.
It's the truth!
Listen t0 me. Please, listen.
You've gotta listen!
No! No, look, it's a mistake!
It's a mistake!
Look, he thought it was me. He thought
I did it because lwent up to the house!
I went to the house because
I had a date with Sandy.
She didn't turn up, so I went to see why.
When I got there, I couldn't make nobody hear. The house was empty!
He thought it was him.
His name's Jack, the same.
Yeah, but it's not mine!
I keep telling you, it's not mine!
I gave mine to the girl, to Sandy!
Oh, it's not mine, I swear it!
Well, they ain't gonna believe a gippo, are they?
This says "Jacko".
It's all right.
It's all right, Sarah.
It's all right in here.
It's all right.
To us our course by lot is given... charge and strict watch,
that to this happy place... no evil thing approach or enter in.
O Lord, you give us strength and guidance... to keep thy worlds in the image of his truth.
Let no evil thing... approach or enter in.
There is danger.
Toward the sun.
Action. Come on, girls.
Shake those heads.
Put feeling into it.
Thanks.
The living room.
Three bedrooms, did you say?
And a maid's room and a bath.
You could use that for a child.
Do you have children? No.
Uh, you are married?
Not yet.
Oh, Jesus, Alison!
Another unfurnished apartment.
Think of all the stuff you have to buy.
Well, at least I can get a full-length mirror.
A what?
Just once...
I'd like to check my clothes without having to race Michael to the mirror.
She'll like this.
Your lady?
Say, are these the only closets for this room?
What are you in, menswear wholesale?
No, she's a model.
Are you in that line?
Modeling?
Well, you look kinda... well-dressed.
I'm a lawyer.
Uh, lawyers must spend pretty heavy on clothes, huh?
How much is this one?
600 a month.
Save your money.
Marry Michael.
I will. Jenny, it's just that I've been with him for two years... ever since I got out of the hospital.
I just need some space.
I just need some space now.
1,000 a month is the least they'll take, huh?
Got people lining up.
Look, I need more room.
I wanna get married.
Happy marriages are made in
$1,000-a-month apartments.
Don't they dust in this place?
I'll let you know about it though.
Ah, people are standing in line for this.
Where?
Don't call us, we'll call you.
Thank you.
Thanks. I'll call.
I still love him, Jenny.
I just need to get a place of my own.
I have to prove to myself that I can take care of me.
Maybe just for a year or two, you know.
Maybe just for a year.
Is your hair lustrous?
Is your hair easy to manage?
Try using Glamour shampoo.
You're missing one of my finer performances.
Yeah, I caught it last night, thank you.
Tell me what one man can do with 16 convertibles.
Get a lot of fresh air?
All bought... with money embezzled... from the Hudson Bank of Albany.
Will you get him off?
Depends if the judge is a car freak.
Say, what do you say we celebrate his going inside by getting married?
Oh, Michael. Are you gonna ask me that again?
Well, we've been living together for... for God knows how long.
Yeah, but I want to get my own apartment.
Listen, you don't have to get your own apartment.
We can still meet.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Hello.
Yeah. Hi.
Yeah, just a minute.
It's Baltimore. It's your mom.
Hello, Mom?
- What's the matter?
- It's my father.
Severe migraine. Shock.
Perhaps we should go, Mary.
Mom, I just can't go.
Take one of these.
Best go without her.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye, Alison.
See you at school tomorrow.
- Dad!
- Who the hell is that?
Get out of here!
I told you never to come in this place!
Get out of here! Get out!
Get out of this place!
I told you never again!
Get rid of that thing!
Get out of here!
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God!
Are you going to be all right here, Mom?
It'll be no worse.
Well, then why did you stay with him?
I had nowhere to go.
Welcome back, Miss Parker.
Ah!
We must stop meeting like this.
How was it?
Awful.
Oh, hey...
Uh, every real estate agent in town called you back.
Oh, good.
You're serious about getting your own place?
I don't want to be left with nowhere to go.
- What?
- Just something my mother said.
I'll be gone for a few days. Long enough to defend my convertible freak.
Hey!
Present.
Just to show you
I still love you.
And I love you.
Hello.
Hello. Is this Miss Logan?
Yes. Can I help you?
Yes, I'm inquiring about the advertisement in today's paper.
The fully furnished apartment in old Brooklyn house.
View of Manhattan skyline.
It's not gone yet, is it?
No.
Good. Can I come by?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Our questionnaire.
Also, we need another signature... for our commission.
Then can I see the apartment?
Oh, I see no reason why not.
You'll be living alone?
Well, I'll have an occasional visitor.
Oh, a model?
Yeah.
Have I seen you on TV?
Is your hair lustrous and easy to manage?
Oh, yes.
Shaking your hair in the fields.
Oh, it must be a glamorous profession.
I'm sure the landlord will approve.
From Baltimore?
Yes.
Hmm. How nice.
I find New Yorkers have no sense for anything but sex and money.
Well, I guess there's something to be said for that too.
It's one of the nicer tree-lined blocks in New York... and only 20 minutes from the center of town.
Oh, and just around the corner there's a supermarket and a cleaners.
I'm sure you'll find it all most convenient.
Shall we?
Oh, and you can keep a bicycle here if you want.
The furniture fits beautifully.
I'm sure you'll agree.
Can I see the rest of it?
Oh, of course.
Note the utility and workmanship of the items, Miss Parker.
Oh, I really like the view.
Oh, it's spectacular, isn't it?
How much did you say this place was?
$500 a month.
Oh, I'm afraid that's a bit too much.
400 is not excessive.
I thought you said 500.
A $50 deposit will be just fine.
Do you have a pen?
Uh, yes.
You've made an excellent choice,
Miss Parker.
Miss Logan?
Yes?
There is somebody staring at me from that fifth floor window up there.
Oh, I'm sure you've been stared at before.
Yes, but...
That's Father Halliran in 5A.
He's been here for years.
He's a priest.
He's kind of senile.
He just sits by the window.
He's blind.
Blind?
Well, then what does he look at?
Quick. Give me the other camera.
I'm not going to get it like this again.
Alison, move to the left.
For Christ's sake, hold 'em still!
- Jack, help me.
- Here, birdie! Here, birdie!
Oh, my God!
- Get them on the cement!
- Come back! Come on!
- Oh, Christ!
- Oh!
Let's get it together again, fellas.
Is there a Miss Parker here?
- Alison!
- Jack, may I?
Why not? The ship's sinking.
Hello? Michael, hi!
Oh, it's going just terrific.
Two Afghans are eating six peacocks.
I'll see you at 8:00.
Okay. Bye-bye.
It was at the base of my skull, and then there was a tingling sensation in my arms and my legs... and then everything just went numb.
Anything now?
Not a thing now.
I mean, they put an ice pack on my head and five minutes later I was just fine.
- Is that clock right?
- Yeah, it's five to 8:00. I'd best be off.
Aren't you going to stay and say hello to Michael?
Never destroy a tender moment.
Oh, we've only been apart for two weeks.
Well, here.
Thanks a lot for the vase.
Hey, listen, be happy here.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, you're welcome.
Oh, my love to Michael.
Okay. Bye.
Bye-bye.
Chazen is the name.
Charles Chazen.
I'm your neighbor in 4B.
Oh.
And this is Mortimer.
He's from Brazil.
And this, on the other hand, so to speak... this is Jezebel.
Say hello to that nice lady, Jezebel.
That's it, darling.
He's got indigestion.
Well, hi, I'm Alison.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
May we, uh...
Oh, what a lovely apartment.
Absolutely lovely! I was wondering when
I was going to meet my new neighbors.
My, and you're so pretty.
Haven't I seen you before on television?
Now, don't tell me.
I know. You were in, uh...
I've done some TV commercials.
Oh, really? I thought you were an actress. Let me see.
Herbert Hoover!
A noble president.
Oh, dear, he's my favorite.
Isn't he lovely?
That doesn't look like him.
Of course it does, darling.
I... I admired him so.
"I shall go to Korea," he said.
And got him elected.
That was Eisenhower.
Really? Well, Hoover must have said something, didn't he?
"Give me liberty or give me death."
That's it. That's it.
Oh, a great man!
Oh, my dear, your taste is impeccable!
I wish you'd help me redecorate my poor place someday. Would you, hmm?
Were you waiting to go out?
I'm sorry.
I'm waiting for a friend.
Ah, well!
Friendships often blossom into bliss, as they say.
And speaking of bliss, Mortimer loves to have his stomach rubbed. Would you?
Do you know all our neighbors?
Yes, I know all of them, and they're very nice people.
Except that priest who lives above me. He's... Well...
However, he's quiet most of the time.
Then there are the two women on the first floor, and...
To tell you the truth, my dear,
Mortimer and Jezebel are my only true companions really.
It's way past their bedtime.
Isn't it, sweetheart?
You wanna come with me?
That's it.
Now, if there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.
- There is.
- Just mention it.
Can I use your phone in case of an emergency?
The phone company hasn't had a chance to put my phone in yet.
Of course, if I had one it would be a pleasure, but I don't.
Whom would I call, after all?
Now say good night, Jezebel.
Say good night.
Maybe she's just got a cold.
I think so. She's very unpredictable.
Good night, my dear.
Good night.
Remember, you eat and drink with moderation.
This is the Arc de Triomphe, as you can see.
- It's upside down.
- I took it standing on my head.
This is the Laughing Cavalier, better known as the Mona Lisa.
You notice there's glass in front of it because someone tried to desecrate it just...
You have some of the most boring friends.
Well, we always make out in the movies.
Not here.
Hey, I hear you fainted today.
Who told you?
Your boring friend, Jack.
Well, I'm okay.
Al, come back.
Marry me.
It's only been two years since Karen.
Karen and I were not like you and me. Forget it.
I can't forget it.
Think of us.
Au revoir to Paris, and welcome to Siam!
Ingrates!
I'll be one second.
Who's this?
Charles Chazen.
Minus parakeet and cat.
This man looks like a prune.
Well, I think he's cute.
Oh.
What's this?
I found it in my father's room.
I didn't know you were Catholic.
Does it matter?
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Hello?
How may we help you?
I just moved in upstairs and I just thought I'd introduce myself.
I'm Alison Parker.
We don't get many visitors.
I'm Gerde and this is Sandra.
Hi. Why don't you stay and have some coffee with us?
Oh, I shouldn't.
Oh, I insist. Cigarette?
No, I don't smoke.
Good. Sit.
I've already put coffee on.
Or would you rather tea?
- Oh, coffee's fine.
- Good.
Have you met anyone else in the building?
Yes, I met Mr. Chazen from upstairs with his animals.
Have you lived here long?
Don't be alarmed if Sandra doesn't speak. She seldom does.
- Help yourself. Enjoy.
- Thank you.
The crucifix you're wearing... where did you get it?
That's from my family.
It looks French from Alsace.
The gentleman who left here this morning... is, uh, that your boyfriend?
Yes.
Seems an adequate lover.
Sandra here lived with a man for some time.
He treated her badly.
Are you in ballet?
Excuse me.
We're very proud of our apartment.
It took us a long time to furnish it properly.
W- What do you do for a living?
We fondle each other.
Fondle. Caress.
Going so soon?
It's rather rude to eat and run.
I didn't eat. I drank.
Hello, Alison, my darling.
Have you been shopping?
Making friends?
You could put it that way, I guess.
Peculiar couple, aren't they?
To each his own, I say.
However, there are some things...
Alison, Jennifer, we're ready.
You okay?
Yeah, I just don't think I got enough sleep last night.
You should hear my neighbors.
About time.
Now, Alison, darling, you will turn and set the bottle here.
Make sure I can see the label. Okay?
Quiet, everyone.
Roll 'em.
Seventeen, take one.
Action.
Cut it.
It was no good, darling.
I have to have the bottle just here.
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
- Take two.
- Action.
Cut. The bottle is wrong again.
Take eight.
Cut. Jesus, darling. All you have to do is get the label so we can see it.
Take 14.
Action.
That looked all right. Cut.
By George,
I think she's got it.
It's out of focus.
Unbelievable. All right, we'll use take 10. Alison, take a break.
I think you ought to know we'll go into overtime.
How much longer have we got?
About half an hour.
Oh!
Oh, my God!
- Get somebody over here.
- Call an ambulance!
That's just what I needed.
Look, get another girl in her dress, and then we'll use somebody else's hand for the close-up. All right?
Jesus Christ!
I've got these little white pills.
They're supposed to relax me.
Are you sure they checked you thoroughly at the hospital?
Yes, I was tested for four hours, and they said if it got any worse
I'm to consult a neurologist.
- Well, I'll come over.
- No, it's okay.
Jennifer's here and she's gonna give me a ride home.
Isn't there anything I can do?
You can use some influence to get a phone put in my apartment.
Got an easier one for me?
No. Bye.
Vicky, what's the matter?
It's Charles.
I think someone shot him.
Where is he now?
He's at the house.
I didn't dare call the police.
I'll come with you.
What if Harry sees you?
It's too much of a risk.
Who is it?
Who's there?
It's me.
My dear,
I have a surprise for you.
Oh, I've had such a bad day.
Then my surprise will make you well.
Come on.
Well, I'll only stay for a few minutes. Okay?
All right, darling.
Did you leave your photograph?
Yes, I left my picture for you.
You like this flower?
Yeah. I grew it myself.
Come on! Come on!
Alison, I'm going to blindfold you.
And don't peek until
I tell you you may.
I promise.
All right now, step forward.
But be careful.
Be very careful and in we go...
And...
Open up! Open up!
Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!
Surprise. Now, I want you to meet Jezebel's other guests.
Everybody, listen. Listen. That's right.
I want you to meet Alison Parker.
She's just moved into 2A.
That's right. Right, right.
Come here.
This is Mrs. Clark from 4A.
Miss Parker, dear.
Hi. How do you do?
Glad to meet you.
This is Miss Emma Clotkin... and her twin sister, Lilian, from 3B.
My pleasure!
Glad to have you.
Malcolm Stinnett.
Th-Th-The Clotkin's cousin.
This is my wife, Rebecca.
Hi. What apartment do you live in?
We used to live in the one above you.
But the ceiling leaked so we moved to Murray Hill.
They couldn't let it anymore.
We come back here a lot.
You know Gerde and Sandra.
Have a hat and noisemaker for the party.
Everybody, listen!
The polka! Everybody, the polka!
I used to dance at the Foxland Casino in the Bronx.
And one and two, and one and two, and one and two,
and one and two, and one and two.
The gals would sit in one side, the guys would sit in another.
Then we'd meet.
We'd go one and two.
- It brings back memories!
- I remember!
Around we go and around we go and around we go and around we go.
All right, here we go.
Around we go, and around...
- Oh, well, never mind.
- Oh, more. More.
No, dear. It's time for the cake.
Good.
Now, everybody, now tune up your voices.
Black-and-white cat, black-and-white cake.
Ready.
Happy birthday, dear Jezebel
Happy birthday to you
Ah, dear sweetheart!
Note the utility and the workmanship of the items, Miss Parker.
My dear, your taste is impeccable!
I'm sure you've been stared at before.
This is Mortimer.
He's from Brazil.
He's blind.
Black-and-white cat, black-and-white cake.
Surprise! Surprise!
Surprise! Surprise!
We used to live in the apartment above you.
But the ceiling leaked.
Gramercy 7-9945.
Yes, let me have Brenner, please.
- Hello.
- Yes, Jim, this is me.
I've, uh...
I've got something for you.
Alison was just here in my office.
Some story about footsteps and clanging metal in the apartment above her last night
when it's supposed to be empty.
I'd like you to get over there for me.
It's 10 Montague Terrace.
Yeah?
Brooklyn Heights.
Hi.
Hello.
I hope this isn't too inconvenient for you.
Oh, not at all. It's because my associate is interviewing in the office.
Do you mind? Come along.
We're this way.
I've ordered some coffee for you.
Thank you.
It takes forever in this place when it's crowded.
Here.
Is everything going well with you?
Oh, yes. Renting out apartments by the dozen.
Well, I'm glad somebody's doing well.
You're not?
Not exactly. I haven't been able to get much sleep lately.
Oh, not the old priest?
No, it's the others.
The others?
Mr. Chazen in 4B.
He keeps coming around.
And those ladies downstairs really carry things a little bit too far.
The Clotkin sisters... they are very strange.
And that old Mrs. Clark...
I don't know where she comes from.
I don't know what apartment she lives in.
But what really scared me, there was somebody upstairs... walking back and forth last night.
Just banging on some sort of metal or something.
I couldn't get to sleep at all.
And this is what you... you wanted to see me about?
Yes.
My dear Miss Parker, aside from the priest, and now of course you, nobody has lived in that building for... three years.
Well, if they're squatters, there's certainly no sign from here.
True, I haven't been here for a long time,
but whole families?
Oh, he exists.
I am here, Holy Father.
I have come that you may shed your burden in peace.
This is where the lesbians live.
Be my guest.
The furniture was different in here before.
Oh, come now, Miss Parker.
These pieces have not been touched in years.
The landlord's renovating all the apartments.
Renovating?
Well, rather slowly.
Well, it certainly doesn't look as if anybody was clattering about here last night, does it?
My God, could I have just been dreaming?
So the only other one you thought you were in was, um...
Mr. Chazen's apartment.
Miss Parker, it's getting late, and
I have to get back to my office.
Just one more.
Happy birthday, dear Jezebel
Happy birthday to you
Where's the cake?
Believe it or not,
I attended a birthday party here last night... for a cat.
Oh, I'm sorry I missed it.
I want to see the old priest.
I'm sure he can't hear.
Have you ever met or spoken to him?
No.
Well, then how does he live?
The Diocesan Council of New York own the building.
I'm sure they see he's cared for.
Well, I'd like you to let me in, please.
That would be highly improper.
Watch the office.
Will you be back later?
Miss Parker?
Yes.
Mr. Lerman said to tell you that he had to go out of town tonight to get a client out on bail.
All right. Thank you.
Hello?
What do you want from me?
Who are you?
Well, well, well.
You have an ill effect on your women, Mr. Lerman.
This isn't police business.
A girl running through the streets at 4:00 a. M... saying she's knifed her father, blood on her... that's police business.
You know the girl, Gatz.
You know how she is.
I haven't seen her, not since your wife Karen's... suicide.
Don't get in too deep.
Closed. Closed, closed.
The case is closed.
Mrs. Lerman jumped from the 59th Street Bridge.
Miss Parker... mistress of the bereaved husband... took an overdose, but lived.
And now, here we are again... in a hospital waiting room, you and me.
Except this time... there's no corpse for you to invent murder theories about.
Certainly not the lady's father.
He died in Baltimore three weeks ago.
Cancer, we were told.
And no body in the apartment.
Just a poor, deranged girl... who thinks she killed someone.
You can have five minutes.
She's still heavily sedated.
Will the following doctors go to the emergency room stat.
Dr. White. Dr. White...
Alison?
It's me, Michael.
Can you hear me, Alison?
She can't respond.
She should be better in a few days.
Can't we be alone?
Mr. Brenner's office.
- Is Mr. Brenner there, please?
- He's not.
Did you call here before, sir?
When do you expect him?
Uh, I don't know.
If you'd like to leave your name...
Hello? Are you there?
Gatz, we've had a complaint.
Michael Lerman?
Senior partner in his law firm called the deputy commissioner.
And said I threatened him with a closed case... his wife's suicide.
And you did.
Not so much a threat, sir.
More an observation.
Lerman took you apart in court, Gatz.
He made you look like a liar.
If we didn't exaggerate some of the evidence every crook in town would go free, instead of only 90% of them.
That's over.
We all took a beating on it.
Now, just lay off him unless you've got any real evidence.
Thin pickings.
The blood on the girl was her own.
"O" Rhesus-negative.
There was no sign of a struggle in the room where she claimed she killed someone.
No body.
She's in the hospital blurbing about neighbors that don't exist.
Except one... a priest. And he wouldn't know it if the building burned down.
Anna Clark.
One of the invisible neighbors.
That's funny.
I know that name from somewhere.
Did you ever see her before?
That's Anna Clark.
She was at Charles Chazen's birthday party.
"Mrs. Anna Clark.
"Convicted murderess.
"Sent to the electric chair at Sing Sing...
"March 27, 1949... for the murder of her lover and his wife."
"When her lover refused to leave his wife, she chopped them up in bed with an ax."
Charming.
Do you remember reading about her?
Black-and-white cat.
Black-and-white cake.
Hmm?
That's what she said.
- How long has he been here?
- About a week.
Any identification yet?
Nope.
Nothing on the body... cards, notes.
Nothing. He was cleaned out and dumped here.
The print boys have just taken impressions.
Okay.
Does he fit anyone on the missing persons list?
Well, we're checking.
When you find out his blood group, call me.
Right.
Doctor, what about her psychiatric condition?
I'd like to get her stronger before putting her through heavy psychiatric examination.
Going over her fantasy won't help at the moment. All right.
Thanks very much.
You're welcome.
The doctor says you shouldn't take so many pills. They're depressing you.
They are?
Uh, I've got to call the office.
You sure that was the last time you saw him?
You take it.
Hello.
Mr. Brenner's office.
Who is this?
So you found a body.
Multiple stab wounds. Probably done on the same night the Parker girl claimed to have killed someone.
"Probably."
Blood type
"O" Rhesus-negative.
Same as was on the girl.
Same as the girl.
It narrows it down.
To half a million people in New York City.
And Michael Lerman's name, address and phone number in Brenner's file.
That's all?
He kept names and addresses in the office only.
Nothing in his apartment.
Where he kept his real files, we don't know.
Accused of extortion
10 years ago.
He was a detective in name only.
He did, uh...
What's the fashionable word?
Uh, dirty tricks.
Meaning?
Meaning, we have a New York lawyer, Michael Lerman, boy genius with a drunken wife who wouldn't divorce him, a wife who let it be known from time to time he took bribes in plea bargaining sessions.
Maybe Brenner conveniently pushed her off the bridge.
Maybe Lerman wants to scare the Parker girl to death.
Maybe...
That's a handful of "maybes."
Most cases start with maybes.
Ask us in.
Miss Parker.
I hope you're feeling better.
- I thought you were...
- Warned off?
I've got permission to talk to you, Michael.
Alone.
I can go for a walk.
Darling...
It's all right.
I can still walk.
A half hour will be enough.
We have our body, Mr. Lerman.
A man who knew you very well.
I never saw him before.
Give us this day our daily bread, and deliver us from evil, amen.
You came to be heard.
It's eight years since
I've been to confession.
Then talk here.
I've rejected Christ.
I need to come back.
Is there anything else, my child?
I've committed adultery.
And I've tried to take my life twice.
There is more?
I saw my father.
I stabbed him, but he's already dead.
It makes me feel like
I should take my life again.
Since you have abandoned the Church and Jesus Christ,
you have been lost...
and without guidance.
Once you have re-embraced him, the guilt within you... that breeds suspicions and deceptions... will vanish.
The Lord brought you here.
The Lord will protect you.
For each one of us... he has a purpose.
Embrace Christ, my child.
Trust again.
And if you have any doubts or fears, come back... to me.
I was worried.
It's been three hours.
Was it?
I went for a walk.
For three hours?
And then I went to the church.
Why'd you go to a church?
'Cause it helped me.
Well, you do look better.
You know that man?
The detective?
Mmm. A one-ulcer man in a two-ulcer job.
You know, I was thinking, just maybe you didn't imagine what happened.
I'd like to take a look at that house. With those?
Yeah.
A gift from a grateful client.
Okay,
now where exactly... did you step?
Well, I ran for the door, and he was right here in front of me.
It was right here, Michael.
Well, then why didn't the police technicians find any blood?
Maybe somebody washed it up.
No. No, there would have been a residue left on the carpet.
Michael, there's something really different about this room. Hmm?
When Miss Logan showed this room to me,
I thought the carpet was gold.
Well, I've been to parties in worse places.
The table was there, a gramophone was over here, there were plants everywhere.
And this bookcase...
"'Charter House of Parma. '"
"Techniques of Torture by Allard. '"
You'll like this one for variety.
What do you mean?
All the pages are the same.
Alison, there's nothing strange about this book.
What do you mean?
All the pages are different.
All the pages are the same.
All of them!
Alison, either one of us is lying, or one of us is seeing something that isn't there.
Tell me, what do you see in this book?
Latin. I see nothing but Latin.
Everything in there is Latin!
Okay, come here.
Come here. Come here.
I want you... to write down... exactly what you see.
Right there. Okay?
"'Tibi... sortu...
"'cursus...
"'tuum...
vigiliaque...'"
Jesus, Alison!
You really are seeing Latin.
Suppose he hears you, but he can't answer the door?
Well, maybe he doesn't want to.
Alison, if something happened, he knows.
Michael!
The lock's been changed.
Now, you say that Miss Logan told you that the Church owns this building?
Well, that's what she said.
I want you to go back to my apartment and wait.
I'm gonna get this translated, and I'm going to the diocesan council...
and see if somebody will talk to me.
Ah, Flavius, my dear.
You must always remember what he said to Sophocles.
Come.
Ah! Eldridge!
Um, no.
I'm, uh...
I'll see you Wednesday, professor.
Wednesday?
That's when I go old-time dancing.
But every Wednesday is my tutorial.
- What's your name?
- Alice. Alice Marchak.
Alice?
Oh! It's written here.
You're right.
When do I go old-time dancing, then?
Here, Professor.
I phoned?
Ah, yes.
Form of early Latin used, oh, three or four hundred years before the Caesars.
Tea?
No, thank you.
Can you translate this?
You know, when you phoned...
I thought you had a serious problem, something challenging.
Well, I'm glad to see that it won't take too much of your time.
What does it say?
A word or two, now,
I must be certain.
Now, a few seconds, Eldridge.
Uh, Lerman.
Michael Lerman.
Yes, Eldridge Lerman.
Right.
Okay. All right.
Yes, there we are.
Well.
"To thee...
"thy course...
"by lot is given...
"charge and strict watch,
"that to this happy place...
"no evil thing... approach or enter in."
What does it mean?
You would have to check the book.
You can get it in English.
The book?
Yes.
By Milton.
The English religious writer, from his great work...
Paradise Lost.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
- Oh, Father, you frightened me.
- This is my church.
Well, I was just here a couple of days ago, and there was another priest here.
Another? Here?
He had a big r... He had a big ring on his finger. It was very heavy.
It had the figure of Jesus Christ on it.
I know of no such priest.
Perhaps he was a visitor!
Yes. Yes.
Monsignor Franchino?
Can I help you, Mr. Lerman?
Yes. They told me downstairs in the office that you were the man that I should see.
I was told you wanted some information... about one of our clergy.
A Father Matthew Halliran.
You are a lawyer?
A client of ours, now deceased, has left some money to a Father Matthew Halliran,
10 Montague Terrace,
Brooklyn Heights.
He lives on the fifth floor.
At least that's what we're told.
Let me look at the files.
Oh, yes.
I recall the man now.
Father Halliran... has led a difficult life.
He has a chronic case of palsy... and he doesn't take kindly to visitors.
We have to satisfy ourselves that he's the right man for the bequest.
He was pastor at the Church of the Heavenly Angel... in Flushing, Queens.
He retired in 1952... after the congregation was disbanded and the church torn down.
I'd like very much to see him, if I could.
He has become sedentary, a recluse.
Even a legacy would do him little good.
- The Church takes care of his needs.
- Could I look at that file?
I wonder if, uh,
I could have a copy of this.
Church property.
Oh, yes, uh, this quotation.
Uh, I just had it translated from the Latin.
I was wondering if it might be familiar to you... a religious writing or something?
No. It's not familiar.
Are you sure?
I have never seen it before.
Thank you very much for your trouble.
Jennifer.
It's Alison.
She called me.
Hey, how you feeling?
Terrible.
- The headache back?
- And the dizziness and the nausea.
And I'm losing control of my reflexes.
By the time I got here she'd fainted.
Did you call the doctor?
No.
Why not?
'Cause I was scared!
I keep dreaming that I see that priest in the window, and there's a funny light behind him.
This man Perry called.
He said to meet him tonight at
9:00 at the Grand Army Plaza.
Can you stay with her tonight?
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah. I have to, darling.
I'll be back, but I'll be late.
Jennifer will stay with you.
Dr. Orton's number's in the book.
If you need him, he'll come.
I just don't wanna be by myself.
Don't worry about a thing. I'll just be gone for a couple hours. Okay?
Hello, Perry.
Been a long time, Mr. Lawyer.
It's all there.
You take a high chance.
Let's go.
Open these two locks.
Sure.
"Father Matthew Halliran."
William O'Rourke?
Father Halliran?
"William O'Rourke, disappeared July 12, 1952... after attempted suicide."
They're the same man.
William O'Rourke became a priest named Halliran.
Yes, but why?
I just open doors.
Before Halliran, there was
Father David Spinnetti, who started life as Andrew Carter.
Declared missing, Carter reappeared as Spinnetti...
and died...
the day that Halliran started life as a priest.
Before him, Mary Thoren... becomes Sister Mary Angelica.
All of these people, going back for years, lived ordinary lives... and then became priests or nuns.
And all of them, sometime or another, attempted suicide.
"Alison Parker,
Sister Therese"?
"Father in Baltimore. Attempted suicide. Meets Michael Lerman.
"Second attempted suicide on the death of Lerman's wife, killed July 17, 1976."
If these files are right,
Father Matthew Halliran dies... the same day that Alison
Parker disappears... and becomes Sister Therese.
Tomorrow.
When did you get in?
A couple of hours ago.
Nice of you to drop by.
Anyone I know?
You don't trust me, do you, Jennifer?
Not much.
I think Alison may die.
Tomorrow.
She had a bad night and I heard her calling out, but that's ridiculous.
Look, Jennifer, there's no way that I can explain this to you.
Try me.
Look, that girl upstairs needs our help.
Now, I can be with her all day today, but tonight I have to be somewhere else.
- The house?
- I'm not asking you to believe anything.
I'm just asking you to be with her tonight.
You know I'm giving a party tonight.
Fine. Fine. We'll come. She can stay the night with you.
But please, whatever you do, don't leave her alone after midnight.
Promise me.
Jesus, Michael.
You're really frightened.
Thou art not a God that has pleasure in wickedness, nor will the evil dwell with you.
Let all those who put their faith in thee rejoice.
Amen.
God be with you this night.
I can't make this party,
Michael.
Darling, it'll make you feel better.
That's what Charles Chazen said.
Alison, it's really important that you're with people tonight.
Jennifer will take care of you.
I'd rather be with you.
I have to see this thing through.
The house?
After tomorrow, it'll all be over.
What do you know?
God, I love you.
I love you.
Oh, I just wish I knew what was happening to me.
Rebecca and Malcolm Stinnett.
Sell.
Gerde Engstrom.
Emma and Lilian Clotkin.
Anna Clark.
All people the Parker girl said she met.
All killers, all dead.
She went to a party with eight dead murderers.
Doesn't everybody?
Alison!
She's aged him.
I said, "'Whenever. '"
And she said, "'I don't know. '"
Hello.
Well, you're the last.
I was dressing.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
No one's started eating yet anyhow.
What's wrong with Alison?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Michael, let me go with you.
Take good care of her, will you.
Here's the doctor's number, just in case.
Excuse me.
Be careful.
Call the doctor!
Oh, no! Get a doctor!
"Through me you go into the city of grief.
"Through me you go into the pain that is eternal.
"'Through me you go among people lost.
"Abandon hope, all ye who e..."
The entrance to hell.
Talk!
Talk, you bastard!
Why the charades?
Why Chazen? Why Mrs. Clark?
You'd better say something, or I'm gonna strangle it out of you!
Goddamn it, I'll kill you!
You tell me what happened, or I'll kill you. I swear to God, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Michael!
Michael.
O God, help me!
O angel of God, my guardian, please help me.
Ohh!
Michael!
It's all right.
Listen. Listen.
The Latin you saw in that book was an ancient warning... from the angel Gabriel to the angel Uriel.
Michael, what are you talking about?
The angel Uriel was stationed at the entrance to Eden...
to guard it from the devil.
Since that time, a long line of guardians... sentinels...
have guarded the world against evil.
Right now it's Father Halliran upstairs.
But tonight...
you become the next sentinel.
The people you saw here...
the lesbians, all of them...
are reincarnations.
Devils.
The only way they can stop the new sentinel... is to make you commit suicide.
That's what they were trying to do.
The cat!
Kill it, Michael!
Oh, don't.
You don't understand.
I was killed by Monsignor Franchino for trying to strangle Father Halliran.
I'm damned to eternal hell for my sins,
for having Brenner murder my wife.
I am one of the legion.
Welcome home.
Don't be afraid.
I was waiting for you.
You're such a sweet child.
I just love... having you around.
Please!
So much noise!
It hurts my ears.
Now, quiet, my dear.
Quiet.
You are here to join us.
I call ye and declare ye now returned!
May horror and confusion expedite our glorious march!
Rise, and enter now into full bliss!
Hi.
Yes.
You are the chosen of the Lord God, the tyrant and our enemy.
You are she who is to guard and protect...
the entrance to this Earth.
Now you must destroy yourself,
kill yourself.
Be one with us.
No!
A queen in our kingdom.
Here. Take it.
Take it, my love.
Take it.
Take it, my love, and remember, friendships... can blossom into bliss.
Be with him.
Here.
Let this knife lead you to us, make you well again.
Be well again.
Stop!
Guard us against evil,
and your soul that is doomed for your attempted suicides...
can be saved.
Resist.
Resist! Resist!
Attack! Stop them! Stop them!
No, no, you must fight it.
You must fight it!
Resist! Resist!
That's the enemy!
That's the tyrant!
Resist!
Forgive us!
Bow down.
Down. Down.
All of you.
You say you'd like an apartment by the river.
Let me see now.
We've got a new block in Brooklyn overlooking the Manhattan skyline.
If you'd like to come by,
I'd be happy to show it to you.
Shall we say 3:00, then?
Your first time in New York?
Been transferred here.
I'm sure you'll like this apartment.
Spectacular view, isn't it?
And all fitted out to the very highest standards.
Lovely kitchen.
Are the neighbors quiet?
Oh, yes. There's a Mr. Jenkins on one side... nice man.
He plays violin with the New York Symphony Orchestra.
And the other side?
Oh, the woman who lives in 5A.
She's a recluse.
She's no problem at all.
She's a nun.
It was October 24 in the year 1891, that I heard for the first time in four months from my friend Sherlock Holmes.
On this particular day, a telegram from his landlady, Miss Hudson, had been delivered to my surgery, imploring me to return to my former rooms without delay.
Oh, Dr. Watson, thank heavens you've come!
I'm at my wits' end!
Why? What has happened?
Since you left us, these last few months, he's been very strange.
He's barricaded himself up there, he won't take his food, he keeps the oddest of hours.
I think he's taking...
Mrs. Hudson! I know there's someone down there with you!
I heard the cab stop before the door.
- He keeps babbling on about some...
- Mrs. Hudson!
If that gentleman answer to the name Moriarty, you may show him up and I will deal with him!
- I better go to him.
- Oh, be careful!
Moriarty... was a name
I'd only known him to mutter when in the thrall of one of his cocaine injections.
- Is that you, Moriarty?
- It is I,Watson.
Watson?
You see it is I.
- Holmes, let me enter.
- Not so fast.
You may be Moriarty in disguise.
- Prove you are Watson.
- How on Earth am I to do that?
Tell me where I keep my tobacco.
Tobacco?
Well, as a rule, it's in the toe of your Persian slipper.
Holmes!
Very well.
I'm satisfied.
I assure you, my dear fellow, my plight is quite genuine.
What is it?
Have you ever heard of Professor Moriarty?
You have! You must have!
I can see it in your face!
Holmes, I assure you...
Very well... very well.
But you see how it adds to the genius of the thing!
That man pervades London, the western world, even, and no one has ever heard of him!
That man is my nemesis, Watson.
My evil genius.
Tea?
Thank you, yes.
Sit down, my dear fellow, sit down.
How have you been otherwise, Holmes?
Never better.
It's almost spring, have you noticed?
With all this rain and fog, you'd never think it.
For years past, Watson,
I've been continually conscious of some power behind the malefactor.
Some deep, organizing power which guides and inspires crimes of the most varying sort...
Here you are.
Thank you very much.
Yes, it is rather wet weather.
I was saying it yesterday to Mary...
He's the Napoleon of crime, Watson!
He's the organizer of half that is evil and nearly all that's undetected in this great city, in the annual of contemporary crime.
You see, he's a genius.
He's a philosopher.
An abstract thinker.
He sits, motionless like a spider in the center of his web.
But that web has a thousand radiations.
And he knows well each and every quiver of them.
Oh, his agent may be caught, but he...
He is never so much as suspected!
Until now, that is.
Until I... his archenemy... managed to deduce his existence and penetrate his perimeters.
And now, his minions, having discovered my success, are on my track.
On my... on my track... they are on my track!
But, Holmes,
What do you propose to do?
Do?
Well, for the moment
I think I shall nap.
Nap?
It would cast an unworthy shadow on a great man's memory, for me to detail what effects this horrible drug had produced upon his faculties.
I returned home grappling with
Holmes' fantasies concerning Moriarty when I discovered a gentleman answering to that name in my consulting room.
Oh! You startled me.
Dr. Watson, is it?
Professor Moriarty.
To what do I owe the honor of this late visit?
Oh, I apologize for the hour, but I wish to be discreet.
My business is urgent.
- Here...
-Thank you.
I... I come to you sir, because I know from your published accounts that you are Mr. Sherlock Holmes' most intimate acquaintance.
I enjoy that distinction, yes.
Then perhaps you could help me to avert a scandal.
Doctor...
Your friend is... well... persecuting me is the only way I can put it.
Persecuting you?
I don't know how else to say it.
He follows me about London, dogs my steps, waits for me outside the Roylot School.
I... I'm a teacher in mathematics.
And-- Oh, yes!
And he... he sends me these.
"Moriarty, your days are numbered".
That sort of thing.
Doctor, Mr. Holmes is convinced that I am some sort of... criminal mastermind of the most depraved order.
Oh, I know he is a great and a good man.
All England resounds with his praise.
But in my case, he fosters a ghastly illusion, and I've come to you as his friend, rather than turning the matter over to my solicitor.
No, no, no, that'll not be necessary.
My friend is not in health, that is all.
You see, had you known him when he was in full possession of his faculties...
Oh, but I did.
- But how?
- I knew both the boys,
Sherlock and his brother Mycroft.
I was their tutor at Squire Holmes' state in Sussex.
Brilliant lads they were!
Oh, the Holmes brothers.
I should've liked to go on, but... then came... the tragedy.
Tragedy?
What tragedy?
You mean you... you don't know?
I assure you Holmes has never spoken of his family or his early life.
I've met his brother, of course.
He lives at his club in Pall Mall.
Oh well, if Master Sherlock hasn't told you, then I fail to be-- see that I should be the one to divulge...
- Professor...
- Oh, no, no, no!
I cannot, will not be indiscreet in this matter.
I only came to you because...
I needed so badly your help to end this most embarrassing thing.
Good evening, Doctor.
My dear John, what is to be done?
Only one thing, Mary...
Thank you, Jenny.
Holmes, must be weaned of his cocaine addiction.
There is only one man in Europe who is in a position to help us.
A doctor in Vienna, he wrote this article in The Lancet.
I've cabled him regarding Holmes.
He's replied to my cable, and he agrees to help, provided we can get him to Vienna.
Vienna?
He will never go there.
You know he does not like to leave London.
He says it generates an unhealthy excitement in the criminal classes
- when they learn he's abroad.
-True.
But, we shall provide him with an incentive he can't resist.
A false trail convincing him that
Moriarty has ï¬‚ed to the continent.
I know how Holmes thinks, you see.
I've sorted it all out.
Of course you have.
Would you please tell Mr. Holmes to be silent?
I did not know Mycroft Holmes well.
I remember being astonished when, after seven years,
Holmes informed me of his existence.
Beyond the fact that both brothers were brilliant, however, the similarity ended.
Mycroft Holmes preferred to live out an eccentric bachelorhood circumscribed by the walls of his club, beyond whose confines he was rarely known to venture.
Dr. Watson, is it?
Indeed I am, sir.
I have not seen you since that unhappy affair of the Greek interpreter.
Mr. Holmes.
Tell me, what urgent business have you that concerns my brother?
What's happened to him?
How do you know anything has happened to him?
I've not seen you these three years, and then it was in the company of Sherlock, whose doings I know you chronicle.
Suddenly you pay me a visit at a time when most married men are at home with their wives... and you arrive without your alter ego, and your medical bag, although I know from your own statements in print that you've resumed your practice.
Your face is drawn and haggard, proclaiming a problem of some sort.
And it is not too long a shot to infer that my brother is the cause of your distress.
Tell me.
In as few words as possible,
I told him of his brother's condition, and the promising article in The Lancet.
When I mentioned the visitor to my consulting room, he ï¬‚ushed uncomfortably.
Professor Moriarty?
He appears to know both of you from the time...
Quite!
And you believe this Viennese doctor can help him?
The medical profession, you see, is willfully ignorant of the problems of addiction.
He appears to have made a study of it, in addition to his other work, hysteria in children.
Peculiar range of interest, isn't it?
He sounds Jewish.
Mr. Holmes... time is of the essence!
At the rate your brother is using cocaine he'll be dead within the year.
And I have no idea how on earth we could get him to the continent.
- No idea.
-That, you may leave to me.
And Professor Moriarty as well.
- Do you have his address?
- Indeed, yes.
Ah, Jenkins, we shall need a cab.
Yes, sir.
This'll do, cabby. Stop here, will you?
- Just wait a minute, will you?
- Right, sir.
This is more than a street from the Professor's house.
If what you say is true, however... it's as well to be discreet.
You see?
He is keeping watch.
- Now what?
- I don't know.
Wait a minute!
Now, quickly.
- May we come in?
-Yes.
Pray, do not adjust the gas,
Professor.
My brother may return at any moment.
Do not do to let him see any alterations in your rooms.
Oh, very well.
What do you want?
This is the most ungodly hour to come calling.
I want you to take a brief leave of absence from the Roylot school.
No more than three days.
And journey to the address on that piece of paper.
Three days?
In the memory of our past association.
But this is far...
We know where it is, sir,
I give you my word.
And when I get there, what do you wish me to do?
I wish you to disappear completely.
Come back and then resume your post.
- Nothing more.
- Resume my post... if it's still there.
Really, this is asking really altogether too much.
I hardly think so.
I have no great desire to rake up the past, Professor.
But I'm perfectly capable of it.
Well, of course, if you put it like that,
I have very little choice.
When must I leave?
Now.
John, dear, this telegram just arrived for you.
It has begun.
Yes.
I must bustle.
Can your practice spare you for a few days?
The game is afoot, and your assistance will prove invaluable.
Bring Toby to 114, Munrow Road,
Hammersmith.
Take precautions. Holmes.
What does he mean,
"take precautions"?
But surely that won't be necessary.
I've always followed his instructions to the letter.
Ask Collingwood to take my rounds for me, will you?
When will you return?
I can't say. Would you, please?
I'm off to fetch Toby now.
Any further questions?
Just one. Who is Toby?
Toby is a bloodhound.
Readers may recall Toby's remarkable powers, from my account of them in
The Sign of the Four, in which his superior olfactory sense was materially responsible for the capture of Jonathan Small and his horrible companion.
More recently,
Holmes had employed Toby to trace an orangutan in the sewers of Marseille.
It was a case which, though I have omitted to set down, was not without features of interest.
Holmes!
Holmes!
Where are you, Holmes?
No need to track, Watson.
I'm right here.
- Hello, Toby.
- Oh, good God!
Forgive me, my dear fellow.
But you know I cannot resist a touch of the dramatic.
And the setting was so perfect, that I succumbed to temptation.
This way, Watson.
- The Professor has bolted.
- Moriarty?
Non other.This is his house on the corner.
I've stayed my nights keeping watch on it.
But last night I made a fatal error... and relaxed my vigil long enough to pay a visit to the pub at the end of the road.
Mind the vanilla extract!
You mustn't worry.
I've not lost my wits, but you might have stepped in it.
Now, come forward now, carefully, now, now!
Smell.
It is vanilla extract.
Much better than creosote for following.
Go on, Toby, sniff it, boy, sniff it.
I poured this here when I so improvidently abandoned my post last night.
And it worked better than I could have hoped, you see?
Here is his foot, that stepped into it as he got into the carriage, and this narrow slit is the carriage wheel itself.
Now, Toby, follow the wheel.
Watson, get the bags!
We're off!
Where do you expect this trail to lead?
I assure you
I haven't the faintest idea.
I only know that at some point Toby will exhibit some confusion.
That will be when the wheel of the cab we are following and the Professor's foot go their separate ways.
Don't smoke my dear fellow.
The animal has enough to content with as it is.
Sorry.
Where are we?
Victoria, I think. Yes.
Come on. Come on Toby!
Like Gloucester at the end of his cliff, eh, Watson?
Yes, yes.
What now?
And now, if you would be so kind, find out what time the next...
Continental Boat Express... leaves for Europe.
I, in the meantime, will remove what remains of this disguise.
I cannot visit the continent looking like a dustman.
- And the hound?
- Oh, we'll take him with us.
I don't think we've exhausted his usefulness quite yet.
Porter!
Straight away!
I fear the fog has delayed us.
Yes, true, true, but it has also delayed him.
Now, where have they put my Gladstone?
There it is.
Here you are.
Thank you, sir.
Would you excuse me, my clear fellow?
I'll be back in a moment.
There was no point in remonstrating about Holmes' use of cocaine.
In fact, until we reached Austria,
I was ironically dependent upon it.
Every time the train stopped, we provided Toby with the remainder of the vanilla extract from a bottle, and proceeded to promenade with him around the stations, always without success.
It was at the station of Linz that an incident occurred which, though seemingly unimportant at the time, was not without significance later.
Stop!
Saved from a provenation, Watson.
Conductor, whose private coach belongs to that private carpet?
They all belong to the Amin Pasha, gentlemen.
- The train is leaving.
- And who might that be?
Be? Why, he is the Premier of the entire Ottoman Empire.
And he's the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo.
I hope Toby hasn't made some ghastly mistake.
Or else this would be the wildest goose chase in history.
I have every faith in that nose.
In all my working years as a detective,
I've never known anything like it.
Now, Watson, wherever our path leads will take us to Vienna.
I didn't realize Vienna was so lovely.
Charming. It would appear the Professor engaged a cab.
- Oddly surprising
- But unfortunate.
How can we proceed, Holmes?
I did not lose my faith entirely in the nose of our singular friend.
I just merely refuse to get him out until I must.
Now come on,Toby, earn yourself a Viennese schnitzel.
Surely he can't find him.
Well, you may be entirely correct,
Watson, but don't forget that cabs that cater to the railway trade invariably return to the terminal after they've dispensed with their fare.
At least that tends to be the rule in London.
Let us find out if the same rule applies in the continent.
Well, To by?
No, it's hopeless. He's lost the scent.
Very well, Watson, let's go to a hotel.
Cab!
YES, Toby?
I think he's onto something.
He's found it. He's found it!
Invaluable creature.
Sometime in the last twelve hours, you picked up a fare here: small man of advancing years, very pale.
Ja.
Very well, take us to his destination.
If I can remember where.
Let me refresh your memory.
Now it comes to me.
How fortunate. Watson, the luggage.
Toby, you're a genius.
We are the last thing he expects.
What a confrontation, eh?
Why do you suppose Moriarty's chosen to visit Vienna of all places?
I have no idea, I assure you.
I say, Watson, you're very pale.
What's the matter? Are you ill?
No, no. I don't think so.
- This is where you brought him?
- Ja, to this house.
Very well.
Well, Watson?
Good boy, Toby.
Good boy.
Holmes, there's something
I think you should know.
Not now, Watson.
We mustn't disturb his concentration.
But, Holmes.
We are here to see Professor Moriarty.
- Herr Professor who?
-This is Sherlock Holmes.
Herr Holmes. Come in.
I will take your coat.
You will follow me, please.
This way.
You come.
- We appear to be expected.
- Yes.
You will wait in here, please, and I will call Herr Doctor.
I will take der hund, and give to him the something to eat,ja?
Thank you, I think not.
Holmes, surely no harm will come to Toby.
The Professor would never dare anything so precipitated.
You think not? Perhaps not.
Very well.
But no bones, mind, you understand?
- No bones.
- No bones,ja, no bones.
Come with me, hund.
Come, come.
Well, Watson, what do you make of it?
I don't know what to make of it.
Do you?
Good morning, Herr Holmes.
And you too, Dr. Watson.
I am happy to welcome you gentlemen to my house.
You may remove that ludicrous beard, and kindly refrain from employing that ridiculous comic operetta accent.
I warn you, you best confess or it will go bad for you,
Professor Moriarty.
My name is Sigmund Freud.
You are not Moriarty.
But Moriarty was here.
- Where is he now?
- He's in a hotel I believe.
I see.
You knew of this deception from the first, Watson.
You are the last person
I would have suspected capable of betraying me to my enemies.
You do your friend an injustice,
Herr Holmes.
He and your brother paid Professor Moriarty to journey here, in the hope that you would follow him to my door.
- And why did they do that?
- Because they were sure, it was the only way that they could induce you to see me.
And why were they so eager for that particular event?
What reason occurs to you?
Who am I, that your friends should wish us to meet?
Beyond the fact that you are a brilliant Jewish physician, who was born in Hungary and studied for a while in Paris, and that certain radical theories of yours have alienated the respectable medical community, so that you have severed your connections with various hospitals and branches of the medical fraternity.
Beyond this, I can deduce little.
You are married, with a child of 5.
You enjoy Shakespeare and possess a sense of honor.
This is wonderful.
Commonplace.
I'm still awaiting an explanation.
But first you must tell me how you guessed the details of my life with such uncanny accuracy.
I never guess.
It is an appalling habit, destructive to the logical faculty.
A private study is an ideal place for observing facets of a man's character.
That the study belongs to you exclusively is evident from the dust.
Not even the maid is permitted here, or she would scarcely have ventured to let matters come to this pass.
Go on.
Very well.
Now, when a man collects books on a subject, they're usually grouped together, but notice, your King James Bible, your Book of Mormon, and Koran are separate-- across the room, in fact, from your Hebrew Bible and Talmud, which sit on your desk.
Now, these books have a special importance for you, not connected with the general study of religion, obviously.
The nine-branch candelabra on top of your desk confirms my suspicions that you are of the Jewish faith.
It is called a menorah, is it not?
- Ja.
-That you studied medicine in Paris is to be inferred from the great number of medical texts in that language.
Where else would a German use
French textbooks but in France?
And, who but a brilliant German could understand the complexities of medicine in a foreign tongue.
That you're fond of Shakespeare is to be deduced from this book which is lying face downwards.
The fact that you have not adjusted the volumes suggests to my mind that you no doubt intend to referring to it again in the near future.
Not my favorite play.
The absence of dust on the cover would confirm this hypothesis.
That you're a physician is evident when I observe you maintain a consulting room.
Your separation from various societies is indicated by these blank spaces surrounding your diploma, clearly used at one time to display additional certificates.
Now, what can it be that forces a man to remove these testimonials to his success?
Why, only that he has ceased to affiliate himself with these various societies, hospitals, and so forth.
And why do this, having once troubled to join them all?
It is possible that he became disenchanted with one or two of them, but not likely that his disillusionment extended to all.
Rather, I postulate it is they who became disenchanted with you, Doctor, and asked you to resign from all of them.
Why? I have no idea.
But some position you have taken, evidently a medical one, has discredited you in their eyes.
I take the liberty of inferring a... theory of some sort, too radical or shocking to gain ready acceptance in current medical thinking.
Your wedding ring tells me of your marriage.
Your balkanized accent hints Hungary or Moravia.
The toy soldier on the ï¬‚oor here ought, I think, to belong to a small boy of 5.
Have I omitted anything of importance?
My sense of honor.
Well, it is implied by the fact that you have removed the plaques from the societies to which you no longer belong.
In the privacy of your study, only you would know the difference.
And now I think it is to you to do some explaining.
In candor, I ask you again why I have been brought here.
- You cannot guess?
- I never guess.
I cannot think.
Then it is you and not I who is being less than candid, Herr Holmes.
For you are suffering from an abominable addiction.
And you choose to wrong your brother and your friend, who have combined to help you throw off its yoke.
You disappoint me, sir.
Can you be the man I've come to admire not merely for his brain but for his passion for justice?
In your heart of hearts, surely you must acknowledge your illness.
And your hypocrisy in condemning your staunch friends.
I have been guilty of these things...
I make no excuse.
But as for help, you must put it from your minds, all of you...
I have summoned all my will to the task, and it's no use.
My feet are on the inexorable path to destruction.
A man may sometimes retrace his steps.
Not from the fiendish coils of drug addiction. No man can do it.
I have.
I've taken cocaine, and I'm free from its power.
It is now my intention to help others.
If you will allow me, I will help you.
You cannot do this.
I can.
It will take time, and it will not be pleasant.
For the duration, I've arranged for both of you to stay here as guests.
Would that be agreeable to you?
It's no use, even now I'm overcome by this hideous compulsion.
I can reduce this compulsion for a while.
Do you know anything of the practice of hypnotism?
You propose to make me bark like a dog and crawl about the ï¬‚oor?
Through hypnosis, I will banish your craving when it exerts itself.
In this way, we shall artificially reduce your addiction until the chemistry of your body does it naturally.
Now, I want you to keep your eyes fastened upon this as it swings.
I want you to think of nothing else.
Nothing else.
Quickly, we must search his possessions.
Doctor, I think I have it.
Don't be certain.
This is not an ordinary patient.
- It's water.
- Can it be?
Then, where?
Too heavy, too heavy.
Oh, Doctor.
When and where did Herr Holmes begin using cocaine?
And do you have any idea why?
For as long as I've known him, he's used it.
I believe he begun by taking it between cases to relieve the ennui.
- A seven percent solution.
-To relieve the ennui, the boredom?
How did you become interested in the drug?
It's a sideline of mine, not directly connected with my researches.
A friend of mine died last year as the result of its horrible properties.
I was partly responsible.
I wrote a paper on it afterwards.
The piece I chanced upon in The Lancet.
Ja.
You are mainly involved in research, then?
I was trained as a neuropathologist, with a background in localized diagnosis, but there is no formal designation for what I am now.
I began by mapping the nervous system, but I became interested in charting the mind itself.
I'm interested in an area of the brain
I call the unconscious.
The unconscious?
You are an alienist.
I'm interested in hysterical cases, and I use hypnosis to dig into their unconscious mind where I believe the hysterical symptoms originate.
For example...
Herr Holmes' dependency on cocaine strikes me as a symptom.
Not a hysterical one, I grant you, but nonetheless a symptom.
An effect, rather than a cause.
What makes you say that?
Well, it's elementary my clear fellow.
Knowing something, as I do, about drugs and drug addiction,
I do not believe that a man succumbs to their negative appeal out of mere boredom.
A snake!
A snake!
For pity's sake! Do you see it, Watson?
- What's that noise?
- Don't worry, dear.
Doctor, may I present my wife?
A pleasure, madam.
- Freda.
- Yes, madam.
Watson! Do you see it?
You see it, Watson?
It's a swamp adder.
The deadliest snake in India.
It's there! Get away!
There's a snake here.
There's a snake in the grass.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes...
You had a dream?
A dream...
Yes...
Strange...
I don't often remember them.
But this one you do?
Yes.
- And it was about a snake?
- Yes.
A snake... that's right.
I dreamt about a case I once had attempted to solve.
A rather diabolic plot, to murder a young lady.
You did?
Watson and I... stood vigilant by her bedside.
The snake came down a bell rope by her bed, through a false vent in the ceiling.
Every night, the murderer would... let it come down... until, one night... she most inevitably succumbed to it.
You and Dr. Watson, you... scorched the snake?
Yes.
But in my dream, a very curious thing...
The viper... turned into Professor Moriarty.
It's odd, don't you think?
Strange, yes.
Professor Moriarty?
Do you place much stock in dreams,
Doctor?
I don't know what dreams tell.
Lately I have been toying with the idea that...
You see it?
Do you see it?
Watson! Watson!
- Watson, let me go!
- Holmes!
The snake!
You don't understand!
You insufferable cripple!
Sherlock Holmes' attempt to escape the coils of the cocaine, in which he was so deeply enmeshed, was perhaps the most harrowing and heroic effort
I have ever witnessed.
In both my professional and personal experience, in both military and civilian life,
I can recall nothing... to equal the sheer agony of it.
How long will he have to suffer?
It all depends to what extent he has saturated his system with the drug.
- Could it be very dangerous, this process?
- Yes.
- How dangerous?
- He can die.
No, no, no!
Herr Holmes, please, go back to bed!
Go back to bed.
Please, you need rest.
Good morning.
A little breakfast, Herr Holmes?
Your fever is broken, and your pulse is normal today, Herr Holmes.
How do you feel?
Not well.
Yes, you do.
You are much improved.
In fact, today we are going to force some food into you.
Do you remember Professor Moriarty?
My evil genius.
Yes. What of him?
I know what you want me to say, Doctor.
Very well, I shall oblige you.
The only time...
Professor Moriarty truly occupied the role of my nemesis... was when it took him... three weeks to make clear to me the mysteries of elementary calculus.
I'm not so much interested in hearing you say it, as in your understanding it to be true.
I understand it.
Good.
Watson, is that you?
Come closer.
I don't remember very much of the... past few hours.
Or was it days?
But I seem to recall... shouting at you... terrible things.
Did I do that, or did I just imagine it?
You just imagined it, my dear fellow.
Because... if I did do that...
I want you to know... that I did not mean it.
You hear me?
I did not mean it.
Holmes...
Come, Doctor,
I think he is going to sleep.
He'll be all right, won't he?
Perhaps.
He will need hypnosis periodically, still.
What troubles you?
We are not being successful?
Perhaps.
There is an old maxim that warns of the cure being worse than the disease.
Come Doctor, we owe ourselves an hour or two of fresh air.
In order to effect what
I would describe as a total cure, it is necessary to trace the origin of his compulsion.
The reason for his use of cocaine.
If we cannot exorcise the reason, then he will continue susceptible.
How does one do that?
By, using the same method that your friend uses when he solves a mystery...
Well!
Jews in Maunberg.
This place has gone downhill since I was here last.
You haven't been here in quite some time, sir, that much is evident.
In the last five years, the Jewish membership of Maunberg has gone up fifty percent.
This is the same Dr. Freud...
Dr. Freud?
Not the same Dr. Freud who was asked to leave the staff of the Algemain Krankenhaus because of his charming assertion that young men sleep with their mothers.
By the way, Doctor, did you sleep with your mother?
Cheers!
If you would step out, mein herr, my seconds will call upon you at your convenience.
Your quarrel is with me, sir.
He merely called the challenge.
I've challenged him for myself.
Please, Doctor, let me fight my own battles.
Well?
As you wish, Herr Doctor.
- Do you know who I am?
- I do not know who you are, but I know what you are.
And that is quite sufficient.
I am the Baron Von Leinsdorf.
And I am the injured party.
The choice of weapons is mine... and the time is now.
I feel dreadful for getting you into this.
- Can you beat him?
- I doubt it.
But at least we have avoided dueling.
Men must find less violent methods of resolving their differences.
- But if you loose...
- My dear fellow, it's only a game.
Would you wager on the outcome of this match, Herr Doctor?
I prefer not to cloud the issue.
Spin for sides, please, gentlemen.
Rough.
One set to the best of five games.
15-love.
30-love.
Freud gave up point after point.
Though, as the play continued, his game improved.
Nein!
The Baron leads two games to one.
Lovely.
You did rather better that last game.
I hope to do better still.
Have you seen his backhand?
- It's terrible.
- Yes.
Love-15.
His backhand, his backhand.
Very good.
In a contest as surprising as any I had ever witnessed, intellect prevailed over brute strength.
Game, set and match to Dr. Freud.
Very well done. Congratulations.
Is honor satisfied?
Perhaps you would care for some dessert, Herr Holmes?
Some strudel?
Oh, thank you, no.
I have something for you,
Herr Holmes.
It's not a Stradivarius.
It belonged to an uncle of mine, but I thought you might like to use it while you are here.
Thank you for this.
Eat some strudel, Herr Holmes.
Siggy, a special envoy from the hospital is here.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
He says it's an emergency.
Holmes, really, you must take some nourishment.
Attempted suicide.
My coat, please.
I'm all right for the moment.
That remains to be seen.
Your craving could reassert itself at any moment.
I think you'd rather come with me.
It may prove instructive.
Come on, Holmes.
I'll get your hat and coat.
She's lucky to be alive, if you want my opinion, Dr. Freud.
She threw herself off the Olgarten Bridge last night and into the canal before anyone could prevent her.
We put her under sedation when she was brought in.
It should be wearing off now.
There she is.
- But isn't that...
- Precisely.
Lola Deveraux, whose head of red hair was, till recently, the toast of four continents.
That lady possessed a remarkable mezzo soprano, and displayed a fondness for lilies, did she not?
A passion.
She was surrounded by them.
So much so that she called herself the Lady of the Lilies.
She was a patient of mine some months ago.
Remarkable woman.
But see, Herr Holmes, where the ravages of cocaine lead.
I thought I had cured her.
You did.
I cured her?
She's had a terrible relapse and tried to destroy herself.
I think I've never seen anything so fiendish.
Fiendish? What do you mean?
She has not relapsed voluntarily.
See gentlemen, these bruise marks on the lady's wrists and ankles,
She's been bound hand and foot, and force-fed with drugs.
What?
Only her own courage and determination enabled her to escape confinement.
Note these grind cuts on her feet.
She used them, without shoes, to break a window in her prison, and then used the shards of broken glass to free herself from her bounds.
Second story window.
How did you deduce that, Holmes?
Look at these.
She destroyed them sliding down to the ground, probably... holding onto a drain pipe.
But why should she then suicide, after struggling to free herself?
Elementary, my dear Freud.
Once free, her addiction began to reassert itself.
To satisfy it meant returning to captivity.
There was only one other method of dealing with her dependence on the drug.
We mustn't take what he says too seriously.
- After all, he's still going...
- I know what you're thinking, Doctor.
I doubt the evidence would sustain another interpretation.
He's not that sick.
But if his conclusions are accurate...
It's all right, FrÃ¤ulein Devereux, you're quite safe now.
Oh, Dr. Freud.
Safe...
Oh, my God.
FrÃ¤ulein Devereux.
FrÃ¤ulein Devereux, this is Sherlock Holmes.
Ah, yes...
The great English detective.
How do you do?
FrÃ¤ulein Devereux... can you recall anything of your abduction?
I was at the station...
On my way to Monte Carlo.
A man arrived with message for me.
A message from whom?
Please feel free to speak,
Miss Deveraux... being an addict myself, I have every sympathy for your condition.
From my friend... the Baron Von Leinsdorf.
He was planning to join me... in Monte Carlo... but it wasn't from him.
It was simply a ruse to draw me out of the station.
Once outside...
I was bundled into a landau with the... blinds drawn.
I was gagged, tied, blindfolded...
Where I was ta ken, or by whom...
I cannot say.
Or Why?
No idea why.
One last question...
Can you describe your abductor... the man who approached you in the station?
It was a little man.
Dark haired... he wore a bowler.
- It was days ago.
- I know, I know.
But... try.
His skin was very bad... pockmarked.
And his teeth were bad too.
He walked with little nervous...
-jumps.
- How was he dressed?
Like a tradesman?
I really didn't notice.
I haven't seen him since.
Please...
Gentlemen, would you leave us alone for a few minutes, please?
Of course.
Madam, your strength is an example to us all.
Now... we have to begin all over again,
Doctor?
Ja.
Are you afraid?
Afraid?
A woman as beautiful as I, has seen everything fearful by age seventeen.
I'm not afraid, only tired.
Very tired...
Herr Holmes, you will be serving me,
Miss Deveraux, and yourself if you work along with me in this matter.
- It's impossible.
- Why?
- Work is the very thing you need.
- Dr. Watson is right.
At this point, work will greatly facilitate your cure.
That may well be, but have you considered the effect my condition might have on Miss Deveraux's case.
No, gentlemen.
Having owned my addiction,
I must also own the time in need of constant supervision.
Your hypnotic therapy may be required at any time, Doctor.
In fact I'm not so sure that...
I don't need it now.
No, you best hand this matter over to the Viennese police.
A man who believes his mathematics tutor to be the...
- serpent from Eden...
- What?
Serpent from Eden?
Is not the person to grapple with the intricacies of Miss Deveraux's abduction.
But, Holmes, you said yourself the lady's courage was an example.
That I cannot follow, I fear.
- Doctor...
- Herr Holmes, the Vienna police are no better than Scotland Yard.
Now, assume you were concerning yourself with this case... what would be your next move?
Will you please take me home and hypnotize me.
I tell you I'm having an attack.
I will hypnotize you right here... if you answer my question.
You are blackmailing me into helping your patient?
You are both my patients, and I will decide what is best for both of you.
Now kindly answer my question.
You leave me no choice.
Very well.
My first move, if I were concerning myself with this affair.
Would be to follow that man there.
That man? Why on earth follow him?
- What's he to do with it?
- He seems to be waiting for someone.
He's waiting for us.
He followed us here from the hospital.
- How do you know that?
- Because I saw him!
Now, keep your promise.
Why? Why should he be concerned with us?
Dr. Freud, you see but you do not observe.
A faculty you must cultivate.
Describe that man to me.
- You can see him yourself...
- Describe him!
He's wearing a bowler... dressed as a tradesman... long ragged coat, black shoes, scarred face...
He's the man who abducted
FrÃ¤ulein Devereux.
- Now... will you keep your promise?
- Yes.
Devil take him! Come on!
Why a chemist?
Well, think, Watson.
Chemists dispense drugs... and drugs were the steady diet of our abducted Miss Devereux.
And the likelihood is, that whoever held her prisoner knew of her dependence on them... and wished to reestablish it.
See, when somebody has turned into an addict they turn into a slave.
However, if one is cured by some miracle, as Miss Deveraux was, their addiction is very likely a secret confined to the past.
Yet, whoever kidnapped her knew of it.
Somewhat intimately.
However, it's dangerous to theorize in advance of the facts.
Herr Holmes!
Herr Holmes, Dr. Watson will follow that man!
- I will take you home.
- No! Come on!
He's playing with us.
Why?
Ought we to let him go?
No.
I must say, he doesn't look the sort to initiate such an abduction.
Doubtless you are correct, Watson.
He is merely a supernumerary in our drama.
Hired by one of the principals.
But who and why?
To have her ransomed by her lover?
Do you know the Baron?
Oh, we had the occasion once to play a set of tennis.
Tennis?
- Who won?
- Dr. Freud did, the Baron has no backhand.
No backhand?
That is interesting.
What is this place?
There's no one here.
They're here.
They're here.
Doctor, I think I have need of your services.
- Now?
- If Dr. Freud would be so kind.
I don't know if you can see the watch.
I beg you to try.
Yes, yes... sit, sit. Look at me.
Don't cover your face.
Open your eyes!
Concentrate on the watch.
Focus on the watch.
As it swings back and forth,
I want you to think of nothing else.
Now you are getting drowsy.
Now you are falling asleep.
You are falling asleep.
Now you are asleep.
You are fast asleep and the urge for cocaine is diminishing.
The very thought of cocaine is making you sick...
They are just horses.
They're not just horses.They're the most intelligent horses in the world, and they've been trained to kill!
- Oh, my God.
-Wake up, Holmes!
Bring him out of it, man!
Bring him out of it!
Distract the horses.
I must have some time.
- Wake up, Herr Holmes, do you hear?
- Come on, come on.
Come here.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Wake up, without your craving for cocaine. Wake up.
Are you all right?
- What has happened?
- We have entered a trap.
Someone has arranged for us to get trampled to dead.
Come on, come on.
Come to me.
Come on, come on.
We must make ourselves a target.
Quickly!
This way!
Stand right where you are.
Don't move till I tell you.
Jump!
Watson!
Watson, are you all right?
Very well, thank you.
Hurry, man.The hospital.
I fear we may be too late.
Why the hospital?
Is it possible you do not see?
The little man we followed, his job was merely to lead us astray?
I gather his instructions were somewhat more specific, nevertheless astray will do.
It would give them time!
Time to do what?
My dear.
I had no idea.
Oh, darling.
But it's all right now.
Dr. Freud came and told me where you were.
He didn't want me to see you, not for a day or two... but I couldn't wait.
Oh, Carl.
Oh, if you only knew.
Do not speak about it.
It's all over now.
I have come to take you away.
- But, Dr. Freud said--
- I made him change his mind.
After your terrible ordeal as a prisoner in that warehouse, the last place you ought to be is a cold, impersonal hospital.
The warehouse.
Yes.
Come on, my darling.
It's all over.
Ah, sister.
FrÃ¤ulein Devereux is leaving.
You had better come along with me and see that she is taken care of properly.
Of course, Herr Baron.
Where are you taking me?
Somewhere safe, away from all this.
Is something wrong?
No.
Just give me my ï¬‚owers.
- As I feared.
- It's impossible.
Do you see what you've done?
Do you know what havoc you've wrought by forcing me to take this case?
Oh, I bungled it.
Why? Why was I so stupid just to listen to you?
Why do you insist on taking all the blame,
Herr Holmes?
What is this egocentric streak of melodrama in you that does not allow anyone to share in your triumphs or disasters?
I followed the wrong man!
You are a human being, not a machine.
Gentlemen, please, please get a hold of yourselves!
This is not the time to apportion blame!
A woman is in danger.
Women are always dangerous.
Dr. Watson is right.
There's no time for this discussion.
Where can they have taken her?
Not home, certainly.
Perhaps to her original prison.
No, no, no.
Out of the question.
They have no way of knowing what she found out about the place or how much she might have revealed to us.
We know its location, surely.
And that is reason enough for not returning there.
Its location?
How do we know that?
Watson, Watson, Watson.
She was found on the Olgarten Bridge after a heroic escape down a drainpipe.
As an addict, how much strength could she have had?
From how far off could she have gone?
- Dr. Freud.
-Ja?
What buildings front the Danube Canal by the bridge?
Warehouses.
They won't take her there again.
Well, the situation calls for more than ratiocination.
Doctor, would you kindly return home and bring Toby?
Ah, yes, Toby.
I think perhaps you should accompany me.
You needn't worry, Dr. Watson will prevent my stealing hospital's supplies of cocaine.
You underestimate us both,
Herr Holmes.
Time is wasting, Doctor!
Will you bring the dog here as fast as you can?
I am on the case, and you have placed me there.
Now you must follow my instructions.
And have the goodness to fetch Dr. Watson's revolver.
I don't think you ought to have spoken to him like that.
No sign of a struggle.
Curious.
Hold on. What's this?
A lily.
Perhaps she had it in her hair.
Hardly with a stem this long,
I think.
Watson!
Look at this!
Ingenious creature.
She's left us a trail. Come on!
What about Dr. Freud?
Shouldn't we wait for him?
To hang, Dr. Freud!
Come on!
You see?
I was right!
Look there!
There's another, Watson.

Something with red hair,
I think.
- What do you feel, old man?
- Red hair.
Oh, I definitely fancy red hair tonight.
Not quite your color, madame.
All right.
Mademoiselle, ale.
What you see is what is available.
Wait a minute.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Would you like to have a look?
- Really, madame.
- You too.
Watson.
- Watson.
- It's nice, isn't it?
Voile, gentlemen.
Here is Chloe.
She has red hair.
Something a little more fiery, don't you think, Watson?
No, I don't see anything in here.
- What's in there?
- You can't go in there.
Come on, Watson.
Watson, the queen wouldn't like it.
Through there!
Dr. Freud.
I see.
It's all right, Herman.
Really, gentlemen, for this sort of amusement, you need not come to my establishment.
How did you get here before us?
By trying to think where they would hide FrÃ¤ulein Devereux if, as you posited, they would no longer use the original hiding place.
Knowing something of FrÃ¤ulein Devereux's past, it occurred to me that the safest place to hide a demimonde might be among a bevy of demimondes.
You are beginning to think like me.
We followed a trail of lilies.
I take it, however, that we have not found FrÃ¤ulein Devereux.
Not FrÃ¤ulein Devereux.
Doctor, please get up from the bed very slowly and move to one side.
Try not to disturb anything.
Watson, lock the door.
She's one of the sisters of mercy at the hospital.
Precisely. She was probably abducted along with Fraulein Devereux to prevent her describing the men who took her away.
Well done, my dear Doctor.
But it was only one man, not men.
I found no trace of a struggle.
The ladies accompanied him willingly.
Why?
Eliminate the impossible, my dear Doctor, and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
- The Baron?
- Bravo! Excellent.
Really, Doctor, I must congratulate you.
Yes, the Baron.
The only person so intimately connected with Miss Deveraux's present that he might know something of her past.
He planned to use this stuff to keep her tractable.
But why?
Why abduct his own mistress?
We have not yet concluded our examination.
Throat slit, left to right.
It's a ritual slay.
Common in Muslim rites and practices.
Sharp, curved blade.
The body is still warm.
Rigor not yet set in.
Muslims? You mean religious differences at the bottom of all this?
I can't believe it.
Murdering nuns in brothels...
Watson, don't move your foot!
What have we here?
Turkish.
"Latakia."
Many people smoke Turkish cigarettes.
Yes, but only Turks smoke this brand.
The cigarette paper is indigenous to the Ottoman Empire.
Our Turkish tobacco is shipped raw and processed in Europe and in England.
It must be... a strand of carpet.
Also Turkish.
I think I know what has become of our Miss Deveraux.
It's only a theory, mind, but I venture to suggest it fits the facts.
Doctor, have you ever heard of the Amin Pasha?
Of course. But what can he have to do with all of this?
Everything, or I am much mistaken.
It is my theory that he was a ardent admirer of our Miss Deveraux.
As I recall, red hair exercises a peculiar fascination for the Pasha.
Circassian women frequently do for Muslims.
No doubt he met her at Monte Carlo, in the company of the Baron.
Holmes, the lady is still in danger.
You mustn't succumb.
Don't worry, Watson.
I won't.
Even
- Watson.
- Herr Baron.
The revolver.
You will empty your pockets.
Give all the cocaine you brought to Dr. Watson. Watson!
Now, I will make a series of statements, and you will agree or disagree, depending on their accuracy.
Is that understood?
_ Say Yes!
_ Yes!
- The Baron--
- I see everything.
The whole thing turns on two psychological points: the Baron's compulsive gambling and the Amin Pasha's fascination for red headed women.
Bravo, Doctor.
Your powers of observation and inference would make you a great detective.
The Baron is a compulsive gambler.
- Yes
- He lost a fortune this season
- at Monte Carlo.
- Yes.
The Amin Pasha bought up all his outstanding notes in order to control him completely.
Really, Doctor, you positively scintillate.
What next?
He offered to tear up the notes in exchange for FrÃ¤ulein Devereux.
Whom he wish to add to his seraglio.
- His harem.
-Yes.
The Baron agreed and hired you to abduct his mistress.
Yes.
Knowing of her former narcotic addiction, you were instructed to revive it in order to render her pliant and dependent.
Yes.
So much for the psychological point of view.
It's the next series of steps that confuses me.
Well, if you will permit me, perhaps I can explain them to you.
Shut up!
All that is necessary is to combine your methods and my own.
I am all attention.
The Baron's plan is clear.
In another day or so, he could have turned a perfectly docile woman over to his creditor.
But she foiled his plans by escaping.
It was then a race to see which of them could recover her first.
The Baron was desperate.
Without her, he was lost.
He managed to trace her to the hospital somehow and was on the point of spiriting away this morning.
It was his black carriage that we passed on our way in.
But something stopped him.
See, I think he recognized you,
Doctor, from your tennis match.
He ascertained, after we left, that we had been to see Miss Deveraux.
It was now essential to get us out of the way for a time, and this gentlemen here sorted that.
Watson! Grab him!
Sit him down!
Yes.
The Baron abducted her again.
This time in person.
And she went willingly enough under the circumstances.
But something arosed her suspicions.
Perhaps it was his insistence that the nun accompany them.
And she left us a trail of ï¬‚owers.
He brought her here to hide while he located the Pasha.
Isn't that true?
- Yes.
- But they were probably dogging his footsteps from the beginning, and this is where they overtook him.
Q.E.D.
The ladies--
They do seem to cause trouble.
Don't they?
Where is the Pasha now?
He told the Baron he was only in the city for a few days.
Something about a government conference in Istanbul.
- What?
- What?
Do you recall a Turkish gentleman leaving here?
The Amin Pasha.
The Amin Pasha.
Yes, of course I remember him.
Though I have missed him.
He commissioned a special--
He has his own cars, you know.
I put together the train myself, what, three hours ago.
- Bound for Istanbul?
- Ja.
We also will commission a special.
That one there, if you don't mind.
Doctor... there is no need for you to accompany us.
If you'd sooner depart.
I would not.
That woman is my patient.
- Stout fellow.
- Good!
- Then we are off!
- No, gentlemen, please.
It takes time to commission a train.
And money.
And we must telegraph ahead to clear the points.
Watson.
Where was this train originally heading?
- This is the Dresden Local.
- It is now the Orient Express.
I'll do it!
All right, she's clear!
Come on, Watson.
Let's get some steam up.
Watson, take over.
The man's tired.
We've got to make more steam.
We need your help.
I will not.
This is railway property you are stealing.
The Amin Pasha is stealing a woman!
She's been carried out of the country against her will!
Is this true?
And you-- you are the police?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Out of the way.
The last of the coal, Holmes.
We have burned everything,
Herr Holmes.
I know.
FrÃ¤ulein Devereux is forfeit.
We've lost.
Just a moment.
That isn't true.
Come down, and do likewise!
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, gentlemen.
No, no, you must not do that.
That is railway property.
- Keep her going!
- No, please, gentlemen.
Please, gentlemen.
What are you doing here?
Get back to the controls.
Here.
Let me help you!
Berger, take these and put them in the firebox.
Don't forget the roof.
Look at this!
What are you doing?
Here!
Herr Holmes, look.
The Pasha's special.
Berger, Berger, you're a wizard!
We are right behind them.
No more points to switch.
Put on all the steam we have!
Open the valves!
We must catch them before they cross the Danube.
Watson! Watson!
It's the Baron.
They're closing the barriers!
Stop the train!
Ram them.
Sorry!
That's the Baron, all right!
Doubtlessly making sure that his goods arrive in Istanbul undamaged.
- How is he?
- Flesh wound. He'll live.
Berger, how can we put on more speed?
Release what we're pulling.
There she goes!
Quickly.
Quickly.
Holmes! Holmes!
Look! He's done the same thing!
Fritz, the brake.
Brace yourself!
He's made a fatal mistake.
Fritz, keep her close.
Pour on every ounce you can.
Watson, I'll trouble you for the service revolver.
What will you do?
What I can.
Keep her close.
Faster!
More speed!
Faster!
Closer!
Bring her closer!
Well, what are you waiting for?
You are very brave with a revolver, but are you so confident with a saber?
If you want the young woman, shouldn't we fight for her?
- What are you doing?
-To see what's happening.
FrÃ¤ulein Devereux may need me.
- I'm coming with you.
- No. Stay here!
Your leg will not bear!
Keep watch here!
Shoot, Holmes!
Shoot, man!
Shoot!
Stop!
Throw it down, infidel.
They will die to reach you.
Not before you do.
I do not believe in this manner of solving problems, but you leave me no choice.
Call them off.
You haven't the nerve.
I'm finding it.
Tell them to put down their knives.
FrÃ¤ulein Devereux.
Watch your step, Holmes!
More wood, Berger!
More wood!
No backhand, Holmes!
No backhand!
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you.
Well done, Holmes!
Bloody well done!
Life is going to seem very quiet after you've gone, Herr Holmes.
You have important work of your own, I know.
We will meet again.
Perhaps.
Doctor.
Ja?
Your hypnotic therapy has saved me from a terrible addiction.
And beyond that, your judgment has saved my life.
Your judgment and Watson's here.
For him, there'll be a lifetime to repay the debt.
What can I do for you?
Let me hypnotize you once more before you go.
What?
But I tell you I'm cured.
I know, but there is another part of your mind to which I would also like to say farewell.
When did you first start using cocaine?
When I was twenty.
Where?
In the university.
Why?
Why?
I was unhappy.
Why did you become a detective?
To punish the wicked and see justice done.
Have you ever known wickedness personally?
Have you?
Yes.
What was this wickedness?
My mother deceived my father.
She had a lover?
Yes.
And what was the injustice?
What was the injustice?
No! No!
- He shot her.
- No!
Your father murdered your mother?
Yes.
And the lover?
What became of him?
He ï¬‚ed.
Who was he?
Who was he?
My tutor.
Professor Moriarty?
Yes.
Professor Moriarty.
All right.
Sleep now.
Sleep and remember nothing.
Do you understand?
You remember nothing.
- I understand.
- Good. Now sleep.
- The Napoleon of crime.
-What?
Holmes was right about him from the very beginning.
Professor Moriarty,
I mean.
It becomes clear.
As he himself would observe, see how much is explained by these facts.
We understand not only the origin of his addiction and his hatred of Professor Moriarty, but also his suspicion of women, so well recorded by you, Doctor, and also his choice of profession: detector of wickedness, punisher of injustice.
You are the greatest detective of them all.
I'm a physician whose province is the troubled mind, which means that, in this case,
I have simply borrowed some of your friend's techniques--
- Holmes?
- ...and applied them to himself.
You will recall we spoke of an area of the mind called the unconscious.
Well, he has led me to it.
He has given me the clues himself.
But how?
I will confine myself to an observation made by your English playwright.
The one he has deduced
I'm so fond of reading.
We are such stuff as dreams are made on.
Wake up, Herr Holmes.
Did I tell you anything of importance?
I vaguely recall you asking me questions.
It was not very interesting.
We must hurry.
Your train leaves within the hour, and my wife would like to say farewell.
Also my son, upon whom you have made a distinct impression.
He speaks of studying the violin.
And I would like you to have this one, by the way, as a souvenir.
What will become of Miss Deveraux,
I wonder, after all she's been through.
Oh, she will emerge unscathed.
Women are like cats.
Have you never noticed?
Invariably, they land on their feet.
Oh, come, come. You're unfair.
She's been through a great deal, Holmes.
And not so much as thanked us for saving her from a deal worse, to say nothing of enquiring after any hurts we may have suffered in her behalf.
I've come to a conclusion about Miss Deveraux.
A theory based on Dr. Freud's techniques.
I believe that a woman of her caliber-- a lady-- would not descend to a life of shame without a valid cause.
This isn't a train.
It isn't, is it?
We are going back to London.
You are, my dear chap.
I'm not.
At least not for the time, anyway.
I need some time to myself, Watson.
A little holiday.
I don't like this, Holmes.
I don't like it at all.
When will you return?
Oh, one day.
In the meantime, inform my brother of my decision, and tell Mrs. Hudson my rooms are not to be touched.
Is that clear?
- Holmes--
- Rest assured, my dear fellow.
It's only that I must complete my recovery.
Give my best to Mrs. Watson.
Good-bye, To by.
But how will you live?
When my arm is better, you would do well to follow the concert career of a violinist named Sigerson.
But my readers-- your readers--
What Will I tell them?
Anything you like.
Tell them I was murdered by my mathematics tutor.
They'll never believe you, in any case.
Good-bye, Watson!
Good-bye, Holmes!
Good-bye!
A chair, sir?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
-This way, please.
Thank you.
Are you surprised?
Well, I confess I am.
I was not aware that you were bound for Budapest or even contemplating going abroad.
It is an odd coincidence.
But I'm not sorry for it.
Journeys alone are always so tedious, don't you find?
Especially when they are long.
Will this be a long journey?
That all depends.
But I do think it will seem shorter if there are two of us.
Don't you?
I hope it will not seem too short.
It was about 11 o'clock in the morning.
I was wearing my dark blue suit...
... with powder-blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief...
... black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them.
I was neat, clean-shaven and sober.
I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be.
I was calling on ten million pounds.
I'm Philip Marlowe.
General Sternwood's expecting me.
Do come in please, sir.
Thank you.
If you'd wait here, sir,
I'll let the General know you're here.
- Tall, aren't you?
- I don't mean to be.
Handsome, too.
- What's your name?
- Reilly.
Doghouse Reilly.
- What do you do?
- I'm a detective.
American?
Yeah. I came over here during the war and couldn't find my way home.
- Are you making fun of me?
- Now why would I do that?
You are tall...!
I like you.
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Ahem!
The General will see you now,
Mr Marlowe.
Whoo!
- Who was that?
- Miss Camilla Sternwood, sir.
You ought to start weaning her.
She looks old enough.
This way, sir.
In here, sir.
- This is Mr Marlowe, General.
- Sir.
You're looking at a rather dull survival of a gaudy life.
A cripple...
...both legs paralysed.
And just half his lower belly.
- Brandy?
- Thank you.
I... I used to drink this with champagne.
So you know Inspector Carson?
Our paths cross now and then.
He recommended you.
He said you had...
...that American quality of insubordination.
- What do you know of "me"?
- Well, you're very rich.
Your wife died several years ago and you moved to England.
You have two daughters - very pretty, but... a trifle wild.
The older one married an Irishman called Rusty Regan.
I'm very fond of Rusty.
Norris...
He was the breath of life to me while he lasted.
- What happened to him?
- He went away.
He went away, a month ago.
Without even saying goodbye to me.
That hurt a little.
I'll be hearing from him one of these days.
Meanwhile, I'm being blackmailed again.
Two or three months before
Rusty came, about a year ago...
...I paid £5,000 to a man by the name of Joe Brody...
...to leave my younger daughter
Camilla alone.
I met her in the hall.
Yes. I'm afraid my girls have all the usual vices.
She tried to sit on my lap.
I was standing up at the time.
Uh, what about the, uh... what about the note?
"On demand I promise to pay
Arthur Gwynn Geiger £1,000."
Signed Camilla Sternwood.
- I'd pay.
- Why?
It's a little money against a lot of annoyance.
I have pride, sir.
This, uh, bookseller - Geiger.
He says this is a gambling debt.
Well, I pay this, how many more will turn up?
In that case, I'll come down on him.
He'll think a bridge fell on him.
I'm sure you will.
What are your charges, Mr Marlowe?
£50 per day plus expenses - when I'm lucky.
That seems reasonable for removing morbid growths from people's backs.
The matter is in your hands.
Don't ask my daughter Camilla about it.
She'll just suck her thumb and look coy.
And now, Mr Marlowe,
I must excuse myself.
I'm tired.
The General instructed me to give you a cheque for whatever you require, sir.
Instructed you? How?
By the way he rang his bell, sir.
- You write his cheques?
- I have that privilege, sir.
That should keep you from a pauper's grave. No money just yet, thanks.
There is one other thing, sir.
Mrs Regan wants to see you.
The older daughter?
How did she know I was here?
She must have seen us go into the greenhouse, sir. She lives up there.
So, you're a genuine private detective?
I didn't know they really existed.
What are you staring at?
What looks like trouble.
- Did you like Dad?
- I liked him.
He liked my husband.
Rusty.
Oh, Rusty was a lot of fun for Dad!
More fun for Dad than he was for me!
- Did he say anything about Rusty?
- He said something.
He wants to find him?
Well, yes and no.
I don't see what there is to be cagey about.
I don't like your manners.
No, I grieve over them myself in the long, lonely winter evenings.
What is it you're afraid of, Mrs Regan?
Then he... didn't want to see you about Rusty?
- Why don't you ask "him"?
- Forget it.
Please... Mr Marlowe?
Please... Could you find Rusty if Dad asked you to?
When did he go?
Oh, about a month ago.
They found his car in a hotel garage somewhere.
- They?
- He "didn't" tell you, then.
That is not what your father wanted to see me about.
Is that what you've been trying to get me to tell you?
As a matter of fact, yes.
Very well. Then I'll be trotting along.
She had lovely legs.
I will say that for her.
I did a little superficial research, even though the job her father had given me...
... was a lawyer's job.
If Mr Arthur Gwynn Geiger...
... Rare Books and First Editions...
... turned out to be a blackmailer...
... it was still a lawyer's job.
Unless there was a lot more to it than met the eye.
At a casual glance I thought
I might have a lot of fun finding out.
Can I help you?
Do you have a "Chevalier Audubon" 1840
- the full set?
Not... at the moment. No.
What about a "Ben Hur" 1860?
- The one with the erratum on page 116.
- I'm afraid not.
You "do" sell books?
What does this look like? A banana?
Do you collect old manuscripts?
- No. Only unpaid bills.
- I see.
- Is Mr Geiger expected back?
- I'm afraid not until later.
Well, I'll just sit and wait in one of your charming chairs.
- It'll probably be very late.
- Oh, that's all right.
I've nothing else to do except... sit here and think about my trigonometry lesson.
Yes.
Of course.
I knew what the book would be, of course.
Handsomely printed, indescribably filthy.
A book to rent from a library of elaborate smut.
On my way back to the shop I'd asked about Mr Arthur Gwynn Geiger...
... the librarian.
I'd learned that he was about 50, tall, with a glass eye.
He drove a beige Alvis car.
All right now, dopey.
That's the girl!
Sorry, honey, you're too late.
They've taken your pictures away.
Come on now. Let's go home. Come on.
Oh! Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. Is Mrs Regan home?
- No, sir.
- I hope the General's asleep.
- Evening is his best time for sleeping, sir.
You'd better get the maid.
This requires a woman's touch.
Oh, dear me, yes. I'll get Mathilda.
- May I call you a taxi, sir?
- No.
As a matter of fact, I'm not here.
You're just seeing things.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'd told a dying old man that
I'd come down on a blackmailer...
... but someone else had done it for me with a gun.
I was left with the book from Geiger's bedroom.
It seemed to be names and addresses, all in code. Probably his customers.
And probably Camilla Sternwood, who he was blackmailing.
Yeah?
Morning, Marlowe. It's Carson.
Did you see General Sternwood?
Uh-huh.
Then perhaps you know why his Bentley...
...is washing about in the sea near Ramsgate.
The car's a mess, and so is the man inside it.
I'm driving down to take a look.
Interested?
What's the story?
He went through down there.
Must have hit pretty hard.
It was high tide at one last night and no one round here saw anything.
Broken neck seems to be the cause of death.
What about that bruise?
- Looks like someone hit him.
- I'd say suicide.
He ploughed an awfully straight furrow down the pier. We don't suspect foul play.
- Do you know the man?
- The Sternwood chauffeur.
I saw him polishing the car yesterday.
Did your job for the General have anything to do with him?
- Not at all. I don't even know his name.
- Owen Taylor.
Yes, that's his name. About two years ago the General called me.
Taylor had run off with that crazy daughter. The young one.
I helped trace them to Scotland, where you can get married quickly.
And?
Next day the older sister comes and says
Taylor was gaga over her sister Camilla...
...and she put him up to the marriage thing. Meanwhile we'd checked...
...and found he'd done six months for robbery a few years earlier.
Screwy family.
I guess now you gotta go against them, huh?
I'll have to ask them some questions.
Try to leave the old man out of it if you can.
Why?
He's got enough trouble.
And besides he's sick.
You mean he pines for his dear lost friend Rusty Regan?
Look, I know nothing about Rusty Regan.
Regan hasn't harmed anybody that
I know of. I'm not looking for Regan.
- Oh, it's you.
- Mr Geiger in today?
No, I'm, er... I'm afraid he's not.
What was it that you wanted?
I was just kidding about those first editions I asked for.
I have to be very careful. I've, uh... got something that Geiger wants.
Oh, a salesman.
You'd better come back tomorrow, then.
Hey, knock it off. I'm in the business, too.
Look, if he's sick, I can go on up to the house. I haven't got for ever.
That wouldn't do any good. He's out of town. Now just come back tomorrow!
OK.
Tomorrow, then.
I'd like to give you a card, but, uh... you know how it is.
Yes. I know how it is.
Taxi!
Can you follow that van?
- It ain't moving.
- Just suppose it does.
- Sure!
- OK, let's go.
We're gonna lose him.
Can't you go faster?
Ohh, be quiet!
We've lost him.
What the hell! Try left.
I said turn left!
Look, if you don't like my driving, you know what "you" can do.
Stop! Stop here!
- What about the fare?
- I gave you £5 when I got in.
What about a tip, then!
The name on the bell read J Brody.
A man called Joe Brody had received
£5,000 from General Sternwood...
... to stop playing with Camilla and find some other little girl to play with.
It could be the same J Brody.
Are those for my friend
Joe Brody in No.3?
Yeah. 100lbs a box, easy.
And I've got a bad back.
Well, you shouldn't join if you can't take a joke.
Thanks.
Well! You "do" get up!
Well, doesn't everyone - eventually?
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Perhaps I "was" a little rude.
We were both rude.
You don't put on much of a front.
You can't make much money in this business if you're honest.
- And you're honest?
- Painfully.
How come you end up in this slimy game, then?
How come you end up marrying a gunrunner?
Let's not argue again - hm?
I've been trying to get hold of you all morning.
About Owen Taylor?
You know about that?
Carson at the Yard thought I did.
Seems he knew more about it than "I" did.
He told me that Owen at one time wanted to marry your sister.
It wouldn't have been too awful if he had.
After all...
...he was in love with her.
We don't find too much of that in our circle.
Is that what Dad wanted to see you about? Hm?
- Camilla?
- He still hasn't asked me to discuss it.
You'd better look at those, anyway.
How much do they want?
£10,000 by tonight, or else they give them to a porno magazine.
And the demand came how?
This woman telephoned shortly after those arrived.
She said there could be police involved...
...and if I didn't pay I'd be visiting my sweet little sister in jail.
Can you get the 10,000 cash?
Mm... I could probably get it from Eddie Mars.
- Who?
- Eddie Mars.
He owns the Cheval Club.
I was there last night, playing roulette.
You "would" like roulette.
All the Sternwoods love losing games.
Like roulette.
Like marrying men that walk out on them.
Like Dad riding in steeplechases at 68...
...and being rolled on and crippled for life.
Can you do anything?
I think I can.
I like you. You believe in miracles.
I think I can get the 10,000.
After all, I've been a good customer to Eddie Mars.
And there is another reason why Eddie should be nice to me.
Eddie's wife, Mona, is the woman my husband, Rusty, ran away with.
Doesn't that interest you?
I'm not looking for Rusty.
She has a great little body, doesn't she?
Yeah.
You should see mine sometime.
Hold it!
You remember me - Doghouse Reilly?
Come on. Let's go inside, huh?
How much do you remember about last night?
- I was ill last night. I was at home.
- The hell you were!
Before I took you home, you were on that chair on that orange scarf.
You remember all right.
What do you want?
I wanna know who killed Geiger.
Did Joe Brody do it?
Joe Brody? Him?!
Oh, come on!
Let's not be clever, for God's sake!
This is the time for a little old-fashioned simplicity. Did Joe Brody kill him?
- Kill who?
- Oh, Christ!
- Yes. Joe did it.
- Why?
- I don't know.
- Have you seen much of him lately?
I hate him.
Then you'd like to see him turned in for the killing, huh?
You're not Reilly! You're Philip Marlowe, a private detective! My sister told me!
So you "do" remember. You came back for the photos and couldn't get in the house.
Well, the photos are gone, so don't worry.
Just forget you were ever here.
Leave it to Reilly.
I've got to go "now"!
I was hoping to see Mr Geiger.
We don't know where he is.
Oh, really?
- You are friends of his, of course?
- We just dropped by for a book.
- Books, eh?
- Yeah.
- Well, we'll, uh... trot along now.
- The little lady can go.
But I'd like to talk to you, soldier.
Stay awhile.
Blood.
Quite a lot of blood.
Is that so?
- I'll call the police.
- Yeah, you do that.
Who the hell are you?
Philip Marlowe. I'm a private investigator.
- From America?
- Way back.
- How come you had a key?
- I own this house.
Well, well!
You're Eddie Mars, aren't you?
I knew you owned the Cheval Club, but I didn't know you went in for pornography.
I'm after Geiger for... personal reasons.
I'm not part of his rackets.
Maybe you killed him to muscle in.
Geiger didn't turn up at the store today.
I hear somebody moved his stock out.
- I like to know what my tenants are up to.
- Funny. "My" landlord never bothers.
Marlowe...
Stop believing you're so amusing...
...and stay away from this house.
And stay further away from me, all right?
I'll just drift.
Oh, by the way... how's "Mrs" Mars?
We have a mutual friend, she and me.
An Irishman named Rusty Regan.
- You Joe Brody?
- So what?
You've got the books, Joe.
I've got Geiger's list of customers.
The ones he was trying to blackmail.
I think we ought to have a little talk about that.
Well, I'm listening. Cigar?
Tut, tut, tut!
So many guns lately.
- So few brains.
- Why did you come here?
Why not ask your friend to come in?
She must be tired of holding her breath.
Come in, Agnes.
I knew he was trouble.
The sucker list I have,
Geiger's list, is in code.
Must be about, uh... 500 names on it.
If those are Geiger's regular customers,
I reckon it to be about...
...half a million pounds a year profit.
That's worth killing a man for.
- He's crazy!
- Shut up, Agnes!
I do think the blackmail's a mistake, though, Joe.
I'd just stick with the dirty books.
You're a very funny fella.
- Who exactly has this lovely racket?
- You do now.
- I didn't kill Geiger.
- I know someone who'll say you did.
Oh, that little whore!
She would!
Great. I thought it was you who grabbed those nude photos of her.
How about a little cash? I'm running low, and Agnes and me want to move on.
No chance.
You win.
Keep him covered. If he gets jumpy, use your own judgment.
I want my pictures, Joe!
Come and get it, Joe!
Joe, give me my pictures!
Wait a minute, Camilla.
- Christ! Don't let her kill me!
- Just stay put. You'll be all right.
Come on, honey, get up from there.
You look like a Pekinese.
The photos, Joe. Give.
Is this the lot?
Yep.
- Can I have my photos?
- I'll take care of these. You go on home.
- Home?
- Yeah. You go home and wait for me.
- You take care of Camilla, don't you?
- Check.
- Can I have my gun?
- Later.
Camilla likes you a lot.
Mm!
Why did you blackmail Mrs Regan instead of the old man?
I tapped the old man a few months ago.
He paid me off to leave that idiotic daughter.
I'd have left her, anyway. I reckoned her elder sister could raise a few thousand.
- Business been bad, then?
- I'm a bookmaker.
The punters have had all the luck lately.
- Where'd you get these?
- Someone gave them to me.
A half-smart guy.
That's all I ever meet!
You've got your photos.
You obviously aren't going to the police.
- Nobody has anything on me.
- Except for a couple of murders.
- Now what does that mean?
- Where were you at 10.30 last night?
I thought maybe I could persuade
Geiger that he needed a partner.
I wondered if he had any protection...
... but only women seemed to go to his house.
Last night it was Camilla Sternwood.
So I drive round the back where there's a brown Bentley parked.
I know it belongs to the Sternwoods...
...from my memorable days as
Camilla's friend, so I waited.
Tell me more.
I waited about ten minutes, then I walked down to the house.
I saw someone going in through the kitchen door.
Bye-bye.
I saw the killer run down the back garden...
... into the Bentley...
... and off.
So you went after him and took the negatives?
I followed him quite a long way. Then...
... the kid skidded into a phone box and I caught up with him.
I developed the photos.
When Geiger didn't turn up at his shop, didn't answer his telephone...
... I reckoned he'd been killed.
So, with Agnes's help,
I borrowed his stock.
Not her again!
If it is, she doesn't have her gun.
That should comfort you.
Not much.
- Is that you, Brody?
- Yeah. Wait a minute.
Me or the cops?
- Who are you?
- A friend of Geiger's.
- Leave me alone!
- This is a small pistol, kid.
Would you like a small hole through the middle of your gullet?
Now look. We're going to walk slowly down to my car.
You're going to drive me to Uncle Geiger's house.
- What's your name?
- Karl Lundgren.
Well, you shot the wrong man, kid.
Joe Brody didn't kill your boyfriend.
All right, you've got a key. Let's go.
- Who says I have a key?
- Your friend Geiger gave you a key.
Why don't you shoot me?
Seems to be three people who have a key to this house. You, me and Eddie Mars.
That means you or Eddie Mars dragged
Geiger's body out of here and hid it.
I think you.
Now where is it?
You are so helpful!
Here they are, then...
68 of the world's most beautiful girls for the Miss World contest...
What, Marlowe?
I said, I've been very busy these past several hours.
I think it's time we all had a little get-together.
I've called Commander Barker.
All this is in his area.
Always glad to help the department.
- Ah, Jim!
- Hello, Stephen. How are you?
I was at a reunion dinner.
What's all this about?
Mr Marlowe's a private detective.
Caught this man Karl Lundgren...
...who shot a man dead in Randall Way a couple of hours ago.
You caught him?
All by myself.
Willis!
What have you got on the Randall Way killing?
A corpse called Joe Brody, and a brunette, Agnes Lozelle.
She was there when Brody was shot.
Claimed she didn't see the killer.
- Is that all?
- It only happened an hour ago.
Mr Marlowe here just delivered the man he says murdered Brody.
Here's his gun.
Tell your story, Marlowe.
You heard about the car fished out of the sea with a corpse in it?
No.
The dead guy was chauffeur to a family named Sternwood.
Last night he shot and killed a guy named Geiger in this area.
I couldn't bear to hear all this twice.
You may as well make a statement of it at the same time.
I told my story.
I left out two things, not knowing why at the time.
I left out Camilla's visit to Brody's apartment...
... and Eddie Mars's visit to Geiger's house in the afternoon.
I told the rest of it just as it happened.
Sign it.
So it seems the chauffeur, Taylor, committed suicide?
- That's my guess.
- Who hid Geiger's body, then?
Lundgren must have. I suppose he came back while I was taking Camilla home...
...dragged Geiger's body to the garage...
...then decided he hadn't done right by his friend...
...so he came back and laid him out on the bed.
We'll keep the books. These blackmail notes from General Sternwood are yours.
Thank you.
And let me tell you something.
I'm a close friend of old man Sternwood.
In my time I've done all I can to save him grief, but in the long run...
...those girls are bound to do something no one can hush up.
This didn't start with Geiger.
It started with Rusty Regan disappearing.
What started?
I think that's what the old man really wanted you to find out.
It was close to eleven when I got back to my apartment.
I'd concealed a murder and suppressed evidence for 24 hours...
... but I was still at large and nobody seemed unduly worried.
As I got to the door
I heard my television was on.
I wasn't in, so I guessed somebody else must be.
My, we "are" tough tonight!
And how we do keep our friends waiting, don't we!
I smell of policemen.
I'm too tired to talk. I'm too tired to eat.
And I'm too tired to think.
Don't worry, there's no damage.
You see, we didn't feel that it was necessary.
And besides that, the lobby was becoming so... fearfully boring.
It's fascinating on the way out.
Why don't you try it?
May I tell you something, soldier?
I'm nice to be nice to.
But I'm not nice not to be nice to.
Listen hard.
You'll hear my teeth chattering.
There were police at Geiger's.
Did you keep me out of it?
Why should I?
Did you?
Yeah, I kept you out of it.
I don't know why.
I guess it was just complicated enough without you.
Thank you, soldier.
- Who killed Geiger?
- The chauffeur.
I hear you're looking for Rusty Regan.
A lot of people seem to think I am, but, uh... I'm not.
Well, just in case you are...
...I might have an idea for you.
Why don't you pop round and see me at the club? Any time.
Maybe.
You see, Marlowe, I have a funny feeling... that it would be very amusing...
...to meet you again.
General Sternwood's residence.
- This is Marlowe. Remember me?
- "Mr Marlowe! Of course!"
Is Mrs Regan in?
I believe so, sir. Shall I just go and see?
No, just give her a message, will you?
Tell her that I have the pictures, and that everything is all right. You got that?
Oh, yes. You have the pictures, and everything is all right.
May I say thank you, sir?
Of course.
Carson asked me to help you,
Mr Marlowe.
That's as much as I can.
There are 17,000 or so people reported missing at this moment.
We don't find many of them. If murder's suspected, there's a big search...
...otherwise...
Here's the file on Rusty Regan. Look at it.
Take notes. It mustn't leave my office.
The General took a great fancy to him.
He's crippled and lonely...
...and Regan used to sit around and keep him company.
Do you know Eddie Mars who owns the Cheval Club?
I know of him, yes.
Some say Regan went off with his wife, Mona.
Well, if this is a picture of wife Mona, I don't blame him.
You think Regan was killed?
He sold arms to the Irish.
Took risks.
But normally, if they're murdered, we find them.
The General should offer a reward for Regan.
The government doesn't give us the money it takes.
Do you think Eddie Mars killed them both?
I think the same as you think: He ran off with a woman who meant more to him...
...than a rich wife he couldn't get along with.
- You met Mrs Regan?
- She'd, uh... make a jazzy weekend...
...but she'd be a bit wearing for a steady diet.
My wife wouldn't even make a jazzy weekend.
I never married.
Philip Marlowe here.
Norris here, sir.
General Sternwood is unwell, but I have read the papers to him...
...and he assumes your investigations are now complete.
And he has instructed me to send you a cheque for £500.
That's very generous of him. I'll return the notes he gave me and destroy the photos.
Then we may consider the matter concluded, sir?
Why not?
Very well, sir.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Benny! The gentleman's car!
Your boss invited me.
Remember?
Mr Marlowe.
Good evening, my lord.
Mr Mars, there's a Mr Marlowe to see you.
Let him have up to £2,000. No more.
Ah, soldier! How good to see you again!
Do sit down.
Ah. Well, maybe a drink?
You hinted that you had something for me.
What is it?
- Have you been here before?
- No, I don't get any kick out of gambling.
There's a friend of yours in there gaming on the wheels.
I hear she's doing rather well.
Charlotte Regan.
How much do I owe you?
Owe me? For what?
For keeping me out of the newspapers.
You said you had some information.
Information?
Information...
About what?
You have a short memory. Rusty Regan.
Oh, that! I heard you got all that from...
...Gregory at Scotland Yard.
- You heard?
- Yes, well, we are...
...we are good friends, he and I.
Look, soldier, you've been good to me.
I pay people who are good to me.
I didn't come here to make a touch.
I get paid for what I do. Not very much by your standards, but I make out.
You didn't knock Regan off yourself, did you?
No.
- Did you think I had?
- I wouldn't put it past you.
I thought you weren't looking for Rusty Regan.
I know someone who would like to know where he is.
General Sternwood.
Geiger was trying to blackmail him.
The General didn't say so, but I figure he was scared Rusty Regan was behind it.
Geiger worked that on everybody. He'd get notes that weren't legal and try it on.
If it didn't work, he'd just drop it.
Well, he certainly dropped it this time.
Dropped it and fell on it.
Look, Marlowe, you were looking for Geiger.
Geiger's dead, isn't he? You're finished.
That's right. Finished and paid off.
Think I'll take a walk around the club.
The door over there leads out behind the tables.
Thanks, but I'll go in the same way the suckers enter.
- We are still friends, aren't we, soldier?
- Sure we are.
Then maybe one day
I'll be able to do you a "real" favour.
You wouldn't have somebody tailing me around in a grey Humber, would you?
No.
Why the hell should I?
I can't imagine.
Place your bets, please.
21, red. Red win.
Scotch and water, please.
Dom Pérignon, George, for the lady in pink.
- Doing all right for a change, is she?
- Eight straight wins in a row.
She can't lose, can she?
You wanna bet?
You rake it up fast enough!
If somebody wins you get nervous!
I'm afraid the rules are a maximum of £5,000 on the even bets...
...so if you take off... about 6,000.
Just spin the wheel. Hmm?
I'm sorry, madam.
I just work for the house.
Just spin it!
Is anything the matter, Mrs Regan?
If you've finished playing...
...perhaps our chauffeur can drive you home.
One more play, Eddie. Hm?
Everything I have on red.
You're already over the limit.
If nobody else objects.
Seven, red.
Red win.
I think I've got the system!
- Shall I call for your car, sir?
- No, I think I'll get some air.
The car park's just down the alley, sir.
The attendant does have your keys.
Thank you.
Quitting while you're ahead?
Why not?
Makes a change!
It's a gun, lady. Yell and it's all over.
Hello, Lanny.
I told you - never do that.
You're covered.
Marlowe.
Good guess.
Now set the bag down between your feet. Slow and easy.
Tell me I can't get away with it.
People just keep giving me guns!
Town's falling to pieces!
On your way, Lanny.
No hard feelings, uh, Lanny?
You keep it quiet, I'll keep it quiet.
OK?
Nice work, Marlowe.
- Are you my bodyguard now?
- Yeah, looks like it.
What are you doing here?
Eddie Mars wanted to see me.
What about?
He thought I was looking for a man who people say had run away with his wife.
- Were you?
- No, I was not.
Then... what "did" you come for?
To find out "why" he thought
I was looking for a man...
...who people say had run away with his wife.
- And did you find out?
- I did not.
- What's Eddie Mars got on you?
- He just doesn't like me winning.
I suppose he's the one that sent that loogan after you.
- Loogan?
- The guy with the gun.
Are you a loogan?
A loogan is on the wrong side of the fence.
Is there a wrong side?
What's Eddie Mars got on you?
- You mean a hold of some sort?
- Yeah.
Wittier, Marlowe.
I don't pretend to be witty.
How's the General?
Not good.
I do not want him to die hating us.
You shoot people, don't you,
Mr Marlowe?
You're a killer.
Me?
You're one of those quiet, deadly men.
No feelings.
You've enough shady friends to know different.
They're all soft, Marlowe, compared to you.
Killer!
Where do you live?
Westminster.
By the cathedral.
Do you care to show me?
- You want to see it?
- Yes...
What's Eddie Mars got on you?
- So that's the way it is.
- That's the way it is.
You bastard!
You rotten bastard!
Look...
Kissing you is nice, but your father did not hire me to sleep with you.
What's Eddie Mars got on you?
Say that again and I'll... scream!
Go ahead - scream.
Why do you think he has anything on me?
Oh, come on!
He let you win a lot of money...
...and then he has some comedian come at you with a gun.
You're not even surprised!
I think it's all an act.
You know something?
You have a wonderful way with women.
So you won't be a sister to me?
If I had a knife, I'd slit your throat...
...just to see what would run out.
I told you the first time I met you,
I'm a detective.
I work at it, lady.
I don't play at it.
Hi!
I'm all undressed!
You know, I had almost worked that out.
In another second I'd have said:
I bet you're all undressed.
You're cute.
It's nice, but I've already seen it all.
Remember?
The porter let me in.
I told him that you wanted me to meet you here.
Well, now that we know how you got in...
...suppose you tell me how you're going to get out.
Not going. I like it here.
We have to keep on being friends.
It's a matter of professional pride.
I'm working for your father.
He trusts me not to pull any stunts.
I'm going to make a drink. You want one?
Yes, please.
If you're all dressed when I get back, you get the drink, OK?
- Gimme!
- No, no! Not till you get dressed.
You jerk!
I will give you three minutes to get yourself dressed and get out of here.
If you're not out by then
I will throw you out...
...and you can get dressed in the hall.
Now get started.
The next morning the grey Humber was outside.
A small man sat in it, alone.
He might be a cop with time to waste...
... or a smoothie in the detective business trying to chisel his way into my case.
Or maybe he was the Bishop of Bermuda, disapproving of my night life.
In my office an envelope contained a brief formal note and a cheque for £500...
... signed for General Sternwood by Vincent Norris.
That made it a nice day.
I was wondering whether to get the car put right, buy a suit...
... or pay off some of my creditors, when the man from the grey car showed up.
Come in.
Maybe you know me.
Sure.
You've been following me around for the past couple of days...
...like a fella trying to pick up a girl, lacking just that last inch of nerve.
- Look, I am Harry Jones.
- And you knew a guy called Joe Brody.
How do you know that?
Well, you're too short to be a cop.
You don't belong to Eddie Mars.
Nobody except Joe Brody's friends would have that much interest in me.
Yeah, well...
Agnes sent me. You... you've met Agnes?
Only bookseller with enough sex appeal to stampede a businessman's lunch.
Er... you made a crack up there...
The day Brody got himself killed.
You said Brody must know something special about the Sternwoods...
...or he would never have risked blackmailing them with that photo.
- What did he know?
- I'm selling that. £200.
We've got to get out, Agnes and me.
She's too big for you. One of these days she'll roll over and smother you.
- That's not nice.
- No, you're right.
- What have you got for the money?
- Will you pay it?
- If it does what?
- Helps you to find Rusty Regan.
I'm not looking for Rusty Regan.
Oh, yeah?
- Go ahead.
- Oh, I knew Rusty.
I mean, not that we were that close, but, er... well enough to say...
What's going on then, Rusty, eh?
And he'd answer or not, according to how he felt.
They were all there that night.
Eddie Mars with Charlotte Sternwood...
... and the reason for them being there - Mona Grant.
She was a singer.
Mars was mad about her.
And so was Rusty.
Charlotte Sternwood hung around the joints like she couldn't sleep nights.
## Won't somebody dance with me? #
# Start up a... ##
Eddie Mars got Mona Grant, the singer. They married.
And Rusty got sore and married
Charlotte Sternwood.
The marriage was a bit, er... and Rusty started to see Mona the singer.
And then... they both vanished.
Together, people said.
Most of that's on the record, Harry.
It's not worth £200.
Yeah, but then... a new fella enters the scene. Lash Canino.
Who?
Lash Canino. The brown man.
I was in this pub collecting bets for
Joe Brody and, suddenly, there he is.
The brown man. Brown suit, brown shirt, brown car. Brown girl he had, too.
And a foot!
Well, he'd been shot, hadn't he?
Left leg all in plaster.
Canino is tough like some guys "think" they're tough.
He'd bump a guy off between drinks.
Eddie Mars calls him in when he has something special.
At the office I tell Joe I seen Canino.
He puts that together with
Rusty and Mona disappearing.
Joe collected 5,000 from the Sternwood family once before.
Now he reckons he can get a line on the lovebirds and collect twice...
... from Eddie Mars and the General.
So he tails Canino.
He follows him to the park.
And there's Charlotte Sternwood waving banknotes about...
... as if she's gonna feed the pigeons.
But Canino picks them up!
Joe figures Canino knows something about Regan...
...and is trying a little squeeze on the side for himself.
I still don't see £200 in it.
If Charlotte thought anything had happened to Regan...
...Mars is just the type she'd go to.
But what if Eddie's wife, Mona the singer, never really ran away with Regan at all?
What if she's being kept just outside London, in a hideaway...
...so the law think she and Regan went off safely together...
...when all the time she's being held on her own, out there?
That's an address I'll pay for.
- Agnes found her. She'll tell you where.
- "You" tell me. I've already met Agnes.
No, no. I promised her. She'll tell you, when she... when she's holding the cash.
- Do you know Burlington House?
- Small, sick businesses go there to die.
Brody's office is on the ground floor.
Eight o'clock? Right.
Bring the cash.
Harry...! Eddie doesn't like you seeing private detectives. That's naughty!
You don't know that I...
Marlowe told Eddie Mars that someone followed him in a grey Humber.
"Your" car, Harry.
I, er... A-Agnes wants to sell some information to him.
Sell what?
Er... er... photos. Photos of the
Sternwood girl that Geiger took.
Our information is that
Marlowe already has them.
Agnes kept some, you see. She's like that.
Ahh!
And where is Agnes?
I don't know. I don't want to get her into this. I... Mr Can...
Well, she's, er...
She's at 68 Redlynch Court, Kensington.
You and I...
...will go and visit her.
And don't you be fooling me!
No, that is the truth. I...
Here's to the truth!
Heh-heh-heh-heh!
Hah!
To Agnes and the truth, Harry!
Hello?
Is Harry there?
Not at the moment, Agnes.
Marlowe?
Where is he?
Look, I've got the £200. If you give me the address, I'll bring it to you.
Do you know the Italian gardens in Hyde Park?
Give me the money.
Hmm. This should get me away.
What happened to Harry?
Canino got wise to him. Now forget about Harry. What about my information?
Joe was tailing Canino whenever he could. He saw something in it...
Yeah, Harry already told me that.
About two weeks ago he followed him...
...up the A1 to a turn-off near Klimpton.
Then he lost him.
It became a thing with him. Saturday and
Sunday he'd drag me around the area...
... hoping to pick up Canino in that brown car.
A couple of weekends ago we saw them.
We passed them by a pesticide plant.
The girl driving was Eddie Mars' wife,
Mona. She was wearing a blonde wig.
Canino the watchdog was taking her out for air.
Joe tailed them from in front, and just beyond a place called Hunt's Garage...
... the car swung off left up a track.
Joe sneaked up there that evening and took a look.
There was a radio going, and Canino's car was outside.
Nothing else happened, so... I came back.
- And that's it, huh?
- Hmm.
Wish me luck.
I got a raw deal.
Like hell you did!
Agnes was wiping herself off the slate for good.
Three men dead: Geiger, Brody, and
Harry Jones, and she went walking off...
... with my 200 in her bag and not a mark on her.
The case had been about a little blackmail.
But all along it had been about Rusty Regan.
Everyone I had met was more interested in him than in anything else:
Rusty Regan, who'd run off with
Eddie Mars's wife, Mona.
But he hadn't.
I was thinking over...
... the scattered pieces of information that swirled like light snow in a heavy wind...
... when fate stage-managed the whole thing.
We're closed!
Open up, Lou.
Ah.
Come in.
Three men beat and robbed a couple up the road last week, so we lock up at night.
I've got two flat tyres and only one spare back there. I need help.
Klimpton's two mile up the road.
Try there.
The road's full of tacks!
Somebody ought to sweep them up.
Lou!
You "do" operate a garage.
Now give the man a hand.
I thought they swept those tacks up.
I skidded on the curve.
Lou...
...take two jacks.
- Where are you headed for?
- London.
Well, he'll be a while.
Drink?
This is not the road to London!
I must have taken a wrong turn.
Yeah!
Decent old car you got there.
You could get money for that today.
- Do you want to sell it?
- Lou, just fix the flats!
I "am" fixing them - ain't I?
You slept well, Mr Marlowe.
What time is it?
12.30. You have a date?
Maybe.
Where are your boys?
Out digging a grave?
They had to go somewhere.
Leaving you alone?
You don't look too dangerous.
I thought they were keeping you prisoner.
Then why did you stick your neck out?
Eddie wasn't doing you any harm.
If I didn't hide out, the police would be certain Eddie murdered Rusty Regan.
Eddie "did" murder Rusty Regan.
- Eddie didn't do anything. He's no killer.
- Not personally, no. He has Canino.
Canino killed a man "tonight". A harmless little man trying to help someone.
- I saw him do it.
- I don't believe Eddie was in on that.
I thought platinum hair went out of style.
It's a wig, silly...
...till mine grows out.
- Who did "that" to you?
- I did. Why?
Yeah, why?
To show Eddie I'd do what he wanted me to do. Hide out.
That he didn't need to have me guarded.
I wouldn't let him down. I love him.
Good grief!
- Excuse me.
- Going? So soon?
I've been stuck here for two hours, drinking lager.
- Nature calls.
- I'll wait for you.
I got lonely. I needed to talk to someone.
In about ten minutes I'd say this place is going to look like a police convention.
It'll be a lot better for you if I'm not tied to this chair.
Lady, you "need" me.
You're involved in a murder.
- Maybe two.
- I didn't know about those!
That's not the way "I'll" tell it.
I can't do anything about the handcuffs.
Canino's got the key to those.
Better come with me if you want to keep on living.
I'm not afraid of Canino!
I'm still the boss's wife!
Eddie and I didn't do anything!
Eddie's a handful of mush.
Canino can take him with a teaspoon.
What do you mean, you can't find him?
No! No message!
I want to tell Eddie, personally...
...just how "stupid" you really are!
Now get your things together!
We're leaving!
You're playing too rough, Marlowe.
There have been a lot of killings around here. I haven't been getting my fair share.
You're lucky the girl's story backs you.
I guess it comes under self-defence.
- And what does Eddie Mars come under?
- He's here.
We're very big on statements today.
He admits he hid his wife.
He even agrees it was rather silly.
He says he knew Canino, but only as a customer. He didn't know Harry Jones.
Geiger was his tenant.
So Mars just walks away free and happy, huh?
Unless you've got real evidence.
- Do you still think you can find Regan?
- I do not. I'm not even going to try.
In real life the good guy never gets the girl.
Yeah, that's the way it is.
Yeah.
Mr Marlowe?
The General would like to see you, if it's convenient, sir.
Well, it's, uh... two o'clock now.
I can be there in an hour.
Thank you.
This way, sir.
In here, sir.
Mr Marlowe is here to see you, General.
Sit down, Mr Marlowe.
I didn't ask you to hunt for my son-in-law Rusty Regan.
- You wanted me to, though.
- Well, you assume a great deal.
I usually ask for what I want.
I think you put those Geiger notes up to me as a test.
Your man Norris thought, with Geiger dead, the case was over.
And you didn't?
Why would a man like Geiger give you evidence of debt...
...and expect you to pay up like a gentleman?
He wanted to find out if anything was pressuring you.
If there was, you'd pay.
There "was" something pressuring you.
You were afraid Regan was not what he appeared to be.
That he stayed around to try to find ways to play games with your bank account.
I don't care about the money.
I have no illusions about my daughters...
...but Rusty...?
Are you still trying to find him?
No, sir. I've been warned off.
The cops think I play too rough.
I'll give you £10,000 to find Rusty.
I don't even have to know where he is.
A man has a right to live his own life.
I just want to know that he's all right.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, General.
Oh, he...
He spent hours with me.
Sweating like a pig.
Telling me about the Irish revolution.
Just a big curly-headed Irishman from Clonmel...
...with sad eyes...
A smile so...
...so wide...
I may be vain in my judgment of a man...
...but... he seemed pretty clean to me.
Find him for me, Marlowe.
Just find him.
I'll try, sir.
You'd better get some rest.
I guess I'm just a sentimental old goat.
And no...
No soldier at all.
He was used up. He looked more like a dead man than most dead men look.
But he'd asked for what he'd wanted all along: Rusty Regan.
Regan who hadn't gone off with Mona the singer.
I felt the answer was very close.
Maybe right here...
... in the General's back yard.
Bored?
You're not angry with me?
I must say, for people with money you and your sister don't have much fun.
Here. I brought your artillery back.
I've cleaned it and loaded it up for you.
Take my advice.
Don't shoot at any people with it...
...until you learn to be a better shot.
Teach me.
- Huh?
- Teach me to shoot. I'd like that.
- Here? It's against the law!
- I know where. Down by the old ruins.
Teach me?
All right.
- Like it?
- What is it?
2,000-year-old Roman ruins.
Hey, watch that thing!
It's loaded!
I'll set this can up over there on the wall.
Don't shoot till I'm back beside you, OK?
OK.
My, but you're cute!
It's a good thing I loaded this thing with blanks. I had a hunch what you might do.
You don't care about us, Marlowe.
You kill a man last night, and now you come and frighten my sister into a fit.
- Well?
- How is she?
She's all right, I suppose.
She's fast asleep.
- What did you do to her?
- Absolutely nothing.
I came back to the house after seeing your father. I gave her back something...
...which belonged to her.
She wanted me to teach her to shoot.
She wanted me to see an old ruined castle.
She wanted to kill me.
She fired all six shots straight at me.
Sweet little thing, isn't she?
Hard to prove.
Prove what?
That she fired at you. You were alone, the two of you. You can't prove a thing.
I was thinking of another day...
...when there were real bullets in that gun.
I was thinking of the day that Rusty Regan disappeared.
I came home the other night and found her naked in my bed. I threw her out.
I guess Regan must have done the same thing at some time.
You can't do that to Camilla.
- I suppose you want money, too?
- How much money?
Is that what Canino got for getting rid of the body...
...after you'd gone to Eddie Mars for help?
But that's small change...
...compared to what Eddie expects to collect one of these days, isn't it?
Eddie Mars used Geiger to blackmail your father. It was, as they say, a test case.
Your father sent for me, which showed he didn't scare easily.
Eddie had to know that.
He had something on you and Camilla...
...and he wanted to know if he also had it on your father.
If he had, he could collect a lot of money in a hurry.
If he hadn't, he'd have to wait until you inherited your share of the ten million.
So he, uh... stage-managed his wife's disappearance with Rusty Regan...
...to fend off any inquiries.
He didn't want that body found.
It's in the lake by the ruin.
If my father finds out about all this, he'll...
It's not his dying, you understand...
But what will he be thinking about
"while" he's dying?
I'll give you three days.
Put her in private care.
You don't want money?
Oh, sure.
All I itch for is money.
I'm so greedy that for £50 a day, plus expenses on the days I work...
...I risk my future, the hatred of the cops, of Eddie Mars and his pals.
I dodge bullets, put up with saps, and say thank you very much...
...if you have any further trouble, please call me. I'll just put my card on the table.
I do all that for a few pounds.
And maybe just a bit to...
...protect what little pride a sick and broken old man has in his family...
...so that he can believe that his blood is not poison...
...that his little girls, though they may be a trifle wild, are not perverts and killers.
Take her someplace where they'll keep her away from guns and knives and junk.
Hell, she might even get herself cured.
It's been done.
What did it matter where you lay once you were dead?
In a stagnant lake or in a marble tower on top of a hill? You were dead...
... you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that.
Oil and water...
... were the same as wind and air to you.
You just slept the big sleep...
... not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell.
Me, I was part of the nastiness now. Far more a part of it than Rusty Regan was.
But the old man didn't have to be.
He could lie quiet in his canopied bed, with his bloodless hands...
... folded on the sheet, waiting.
His heart was a brief, uncertain murmur.
His thoughts were as grey as ashes.
And in a little while he too, like Rusty Regan...
... would be sleeping the big sleep.
THE TALL BLOND GUY WITH ONE BLACK SHOE
Somewhere in New York...
You were arrested at customs in New York...
...trying to get through with a car containing 40 kilos of heroin. Do you confess?
Yes. I've asked for a lie detector test.
Because I'm telling the truth.
And you say that you're not...
...a drug trafficker?
- No, I'm not.
Whom are you working for?
- The counter intelligence of my country.
I came from the USA on a mission.
I'm not a drug trafficker.
What kind of mission?
The head of my service told me to get the drugs to the USA.
He should be held responsible for the matter.
I'm innocent.
Somewhere in Paris...
Yes. Come in.
Back from holidays already, sir?
Sit down.
What's this mess, dear Bernard?
I'm more surprised than anybody, sir.
- Really?
Yes. I found out through the press.
I'm astonished.
Somebody's making a fool of me.
It's nasty.
Very nasty, sir.
- This trafficker pretends...
...he's working for me, but he isn't.
- He's not working for me either.
Well for whom does he work then?
- I don't know, sir.
This situation could cost me my job. You will...
...succeed me as head of the service.
- No matter who'll succeed you...
...I'm sure he'll try to follow in your footsteps.
With the same goals and energy.
Thank you, dear Bernard.
Have you ever seen this trafficker?
Never, sir.
It's a fake!
A fake? That's possible.
Bloody well done then, but it's possible.
Alright... that was all.
You can go to work.
Bernard.
Bernard?
Yes, sir?
Did you receive my case of wine?
Yes, I wanted to thank you.
You shouldn't have...
- I said to myself:
What's a good present to give to Saint Bernard?
First I thought of a cask of rum.
And then I remembered that our friend Milan...
...loves good wine.
- But a case of Mouton-Rothschild!
And from 1970.
- It's excellent.
Store it in a good cellar and drink it to my health in ten years.
I hope we'll drink it together, sir.
Why not?
Yes, sir.
The thing with the car failed.
I didn't find dear Bernard in very good shape.
No, not very.
- He should take a holiday.
Come in, dear Perrache.
- He just arrived home, sir.
Excuse me, sir. How was your holiday, sir?
It was a good holiday, Perrache.
Very good.
Very quiet.
We had a good rest.
Mother came back in great shape.
A cure of 10 days makes her
10 years younger.
We didn't have great weather, but the climate is very invigorating.
When we came back to Paris, we felt like we were suffocating.
The cure is mainly about fresh air.
There is no pollution yet in the Puy-de-Dôme.
It was nice. And the mud baths were marvellous.
Hot mud really relaxes the nerves.
And afterwards they put you under ice cold water.
He's also bugging your apartment.
A car full of drugs...
...microphones in the statues.
Milan doesn't stop at anything.
He's behind the affair with the car, but I can't prove it.
I discovered the microphones by coincidence.
It was well done.
He's working hard for it.
- I hate careerists.
They never get very far.
- We should remind him that...
...it's not his job to do what he can to replace...
...you as the head of the service.
Why the microphones?
- Milan played a dirty trick on me...
...and he's expecting me to hit back.
It is fun to imagine him...
...trembling with fear behind his phone tapping equipment.
He should keep that on.
He'll catch a cold.
Milan deserves to be taught a lesson.
I don't want an assistant who confuses intelligence with dirty games.
The best duck pâté
I've ever had.
Mother had three servings.
She wouldn't listen to reason.
I told her: "Mother, you're going to be sick".
But, dear Perrache, I didn't make you come here...
...to tell you about my holiday.
Tomorrow morning, at 9:30, a man arrives at Orly.
This man should be able to help us quickly clear up...
...this dirty American mess.
You have to look after him.
Alright, sir.
I hope we can keep the service out of this affair.
Of course, sir.
- This man will need protection.
Make sure he's safe and take Poucet and Chaperon with you.
I have faith in them.
- Yes, sir.
Nine thirty at the airport.
Don't be late, Perrache,
It's important.
And a big secret.
Understood, sir.
- Do you like Italian food?
What?
Tomorrow morning, at Orly, at nine thirty...
This man should be able to help us quickly clear up...
...this dirty American mess.
- Damn!
The guy we're meeting...
Who is it?
I don't know
- Excuse me?
I don't know. Go to Orly, tomorrow at nine thirty and pick a man.
I don't understand.
- Yes, pick one. Choose anybody.
A man from the crowd.
As anonymous as possible.
It doesn't matter at all who you'll pick.
It's make believe.
What matters is that
Milan takes the bait.
I'll tell you what you'll be looking for at the airport, dear Perrache:
...an asshole trap!
Who is this guy we have to protect?
Well? Who is it?
- You don't need to know.
Follow him discretely.
He can't notice a thing.
Arrival from Sydney.
Flight Air France nr 704, gate 17.
Is your guy from Australia?
Arrival from Sydney,
Air France flight 704, gate 17.
Choose anybody...
...a man from the crowd...
...as anonymous as possible...
Choose.
It's make believe...
Choose.
Is he from Australia?
- No.
It's nine thirty.
Arrival from Munich...
He's from Munich.
Arrival from Munich,
Lufthansa flight 320, gate 12.
Is he a musician?
Is that him?
- No.
Maybe he missed the plane.
He'll be there.
Is he black?
That's him.
A tall blond guy with a black shoe.
Michel!
Excuse me, sir. I made a mistake.
François Perrin, 32 years old, single.
Violinist. Lives at 24 Rue de I'Alouette,
7th arrondissement. Arrived from Munich.
There's no file about him?
- No, sir.
Not with the intelligence service, not with Internal Affairs.
He made a phone call from the airport.
- To whom?
To his dentist.
- And the violin case?
I want to know tomorrow who he is and what he's going to do.
That's not a lot of time. 24 hours.
- It's all the time we have.
We have to neutralise him right away.
- Do we kill him?
I want to know what he's up to.
Go to work.
Do what it takes. Discretely.
We don't want to get caught.
Poucet and Chaperon don't know you.
Alright, sir.
- Botrel!
Why a black shoe?
Why a violinist?
- You said to pick anybody.
Yes, but why a violinist?
Because he had a black shoe.
Hello! Hello! Hello!
What? Who's speaking?
- Its doctor Müller from Munich.
You're a murderer, a butcher.
You executed him in a terrible way.
Poor Prokofiev!
Maurice, don't be an asshole.
I'm soaking, just out of the bath.
You didn't recognise me, idiot.
Do we still meet at 4?
Listen, Maurice, I lost a filling at the airport. My tooth hurts.
Whatever, I'll be there at 4.
- I swear. I called the dentist.
Doctor Michaux can't see me until tomorrow morning. And it hurts.
Alright, see you at 4.
- But...
Keep listening. Don't miss it when Toulouse contacts him.
Alright, sir.
- We have to make him leave the house.
What's the name of the dentist?
- Michaux.
It's Mr. Perrin.
- Keep it open. What?
He says he's suffering badly.
- Keep it open. Alright, listen...
I'll do him in between.
Tell him to come in an hour.
Keep it open.
In an hour? Perfect.
Hello?
Hello? This is Dr Michaux's practice.
The doctor can see you...
...in an hour if that suits you.
- Alright. Well, that's great.
That's very friendly. thank you.
It's hurting a bit less.
But I'll be there in an hour.
He changed shoes.
He changed shoes.
Renault 15, orange red.
Number plate 2868 X 075.
Hello?
He's not going to the dentist.
He's not going to the dentist.
Hello, sir.
He's not going to the dentist.
- Why not?
I don't know, sir.
- Why isn't he going to the dentist?
Why not?
- He's going to the park.
Excuse me, sir, what?
- He's going to the park.
He's going to the park...
He's going on the lake.
He's renting a boat.
- What's he doing on the lake?
Yes, what's he doing on the lake?
- He must have noticed us. No problem.
We'll wait for him at the dentist's.
What's he doing on the lake?
He's rowing.
Ah, yes. He's rowing.
- Rowing. - Rowing.
Not too close. Go to the island.
- I'm hot.
He's on the island.
In the restaurant.
He's throwing bread at the ducks?
Damn.
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, can you hear me?
I can hear you fine.
Hurry. He's finished lunch.
They made him leave his place and they're bugging the apartment.
They must be finished by now.
Milan took the bait.
He brought all his men.
- Our little plan has already shown us...
...who are in Milan's secret team.
That's good, isn't it?
There are too many people I don't know in my own service.
Alright. You can go have lunch.
- There was a black guy at Orly...
A big black guy wearing a woollen coat.
I picked a tall blond guy...
...with a black shoe over a tall black guy with a green woollen coat.
Listen, old man, if you want to produce literature, wait until after you're retired.
Enjoy your lunch.
Won't you finish your leaks,
Louis?
No, thanks, mother.
Yesterday was Bernard Milan's birthday.
I hope you remembered?
- Yes, mother, I remembered.
Born in Epinal, in the Vosges, on 28 March 1940.
Only son, late arrival...
His mother, Marie Bugeaud.
45 years old, teacher.
His father, Gérard Perrin, 55 years old, teacher and amateur violinist.
Two teachers, retirement came quickly.
Uneventful childhood.
His father introduced him to music.
Practising catholic.
- Homosexual?
No. Goes to the conservatory of Strasbourg at the age of 13.
Leaves at 15 to spend a year at a sanatorium.
Lost his virginity to the head nurse.
- How do you know?
A letter.
Relax, muffin, I'm not pregnant.
Cured, he goes to the conservatory of Paris. First price...
28 months of military service.
Participates in none of the colonial wars.
Serves his time in army bands.
First violin in a string orchestra for 5 years now.
Often travels abroad.
Also to the USA.
There! He worked in the USA.
I knew it.
But none of our people know him.
- But of course.
He's a super agent, working on his own.
- We took this picture from his place.
In a drawer, under a pile of shirts.
There's a message on the back.
Decode that for me.
As fast as you can.
Our specialists have been on it for an hour. - Good.
Seemingly, an uneventful life.
- A perfect cover.
So, do we kill him?
- No.
I want to know what he's up to.
His eyes give him away.
What's he doing?
No. I told you a hundred times you have to hold the violin correctly.
Look, hold it well and make it really long.
Pull, push, look at me, pull, push...
What kind of a clown is he?
François Perrin - Violin lessons
Too loud.
- Yes, the water mike is too loud.
Well, turn it down.
- No. I'd turn the others down too.
What's that idiot doing?
- Very bizarre.
Yes, it's bizarre.
He flushed?
What do you mean, he flushed?
No, I don't understand.
There must be a reason.
It's broken.
You're nervous, dear Bernard.
- I didn't see you.
And the difference is that I always see you.
I have another little present for you.
It's a concerto for violin and orchestra, played by a very talented young man.
Listen to it tonight, to relax.
The violinist's really very talented.
What is it?
What is it?
- Paulette.
Hello, my love.
- Hello, Paulette.
Paulette, Paulette, Paulette, listen.
I have to talk to you, Paulette.
I've been thinking a lot in Munich.
We can't go on like this.
We have to make a decision, Paulette.
We can't continue the secrecy, the lies.
Are you recording this?
- I dreamt of you last night.
Paulette, please. I'm telling you this is not fair...
...towards Maurice.
- Maurice's a loser.
He gets what he deserves. I dreamt you were tearing off my clothes.
You had big burning hands and you tore off my clothes.
Paulette, please, leave my shirt on.
You've torn it. Are you happy now?
You're hurting me.
Hold me with all your strength.
- Stop. You're making me fall.
Oh, François...
- Paulette! Paulette! Paulette! Paulette!
Paulette!
- François! François! François!
François! François! François!
- Paulette! Paulette! Paulette!
François!
- Paulette! Ah, Paulette!
François...
- Paulette! Paulette!
François...
- Paulette.
How does a horse sound?
- No.
Yes, how does a horse sound?
- No.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Stop that, shit!
So, was Munich nice?
- I'm really a loser.
No.
Yes. I should have gone to the dentist, but I got scared.
Why?
- Afraid.
I went to have lunch at the lake.
They expect me at the dentist and
I go to the lake. I'm a loser.
Well, go tomorrow. Does it hurt?
I don't know...
Scared...
By the way, do you know who's coming at 4?
No.
- Maurice.
Maurice? What for?
- We're going bike riding in the park.
That's funny. I play horses with you at 2 and I see your husband at 4.
He wants to get me in shape.
If only he knew...
Whose little ear is this?
- Mine.
Whose little eye is this?
- Mine.
Whose little mouth is this?
- Mine.
Whose cigarettes are these?
- Mine.
They're being bugged 24/24.
A florist's van's driving around the building constantly.
Milan won't have a clue, because he set up the trap himself.
We just put the cheese in the cellar and Milan built the trap around it.
And what's going to happen to the little cheese?
Excuse me?
- What if Milan gets rid of the tall blond guy?
That would be very stupid.
Doesn't it bother you to send this clown to the slaughterhouse?
Does it bother you?
The tall blond guy with the black shoe... you picked him.
Does that bother you now?
- No, sir.
Ok, hurry up, lazy bastard!
Hurry up. To work!
- Don't be stupid, Maurice.
Come one, let's go!
You've got some egg there.
- Don't be stupid, Maurice.
I bought cigars. Do you want one?
- That's nice, yes.
You'll smoke it later and think of me.
Ok, go! To work!
He's leaving on bike with a guy.
Yes, a bicycle.
I want a photo.
He's supposed to go to the park, unless he decides to go to the dentist now.
Don't be stupid, Maurice!
Don't be stupid, Maurice!
I can't follow a bike through Paris.
Go.
Careful, they're turning.
- I can see that.
It's punctured.
- Or he didn't put the valve on right.
Do you think?
Or his tires are porous.
Shit!
Look at those little bikes.
Having a flat?
No, we're playing a game.
- There's no more quality, these days.
I remember before the war...
I'm talking before the war, gentlemen...
...they produced quality then.
- Smoke this, grandpa.
Thanks, boys... thanks.
This is going to take a while.
- His bike's completely messed up.
Now, they're running.
They put their bikes away.
He stopped. The tall blond guy stopped and is talking to someone.
Micro canon.
Come on, you can't stop every
500 meters, lazy bastard.
Come on, we've hardly started.
- Maurice, I have to talk to you.
No way. You're not quitting. Go!
- It's about Paulette.
Play me the complete recording of the woman again.
Paulette! Hello, Paulette.
I have to talk to you, Paulette.
I've been thinking a lot in Munich.
We can't go on like this.
A good shower and you'll feel great.
What's that?
- Listen, Maurice...
See you tonight.
- What an idiot. What an idiot.
Maurice's a loser.
He gets what he deserves.
I dreamt you were tearing off my clothes.
You had big burning hands and you tore off my clothes.
Hey, stop!
Paulette! Paulette!
Paulette!
The guy on the bike's behind us.
- How does a horse sound?
No.
- Yes, how does a horse sound?
No...
Paulette has an affair with a florist.
- What?
Paulette has an affair with a florist.
I just caught them...
...in a delivery van. They were going for it on the plants...
...and they said terrible things.
- Come in and sit down.
What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. Shaving cream...
...in my toothpaste.
- I stopped next to this van...
...and I hear Paulette' voice.
I fell off my bike...
...for the first time ever.
- Paulette and a florist? That's absurd.
Stop that. It's irritating.
- I told you I had shaving cream...
...in my toothpaste.
- First, I thought I was dreaming.
And then she talked about me. She said:
"Maurice is a loser."
And then she said terrible things.
François, my wife's hysterical.
Go wash your mouth.
The guy sounded a bit like you.
- Which guy?
The florist.
But that's crazy. Paulette with a florist in a van.
It's nuts!
- But I'm telling you I heard them.
She asked him what a horse sounds like.
- But... what?
She asked him to sound like a horse.
He did and I fell off my bike.
What are you doing?
I'm calling her.
- But I'm telling you it was her...
...in a van with a horse...
- Hello, Paulette.
Hello, François speaking.
I'm here with your husband.
No, I'm fine. I'll give him to you.
Hello? Who's that?
Is that Paulette?
Good, no, yes, yes...
Yes, oh no, no, no, yes, alright. I'll be there right away.
Yes, we did go for a run.
She's been home for an hour with my mother.
Well, see? You were dreaming.
But...
- It's strange, François.
They found the mike in the flowers.
- Damn!
We're not getting anywhere, this way.
- We're going in circles.
We're going in circles.
We're going in circles.
He's been making fun of us since the start.
He's playing with us.
He's very good!
- We have to take him to the property...
...and execute him.
- No. We're going to try something else and...
Hello, yes? Musical instruments?
Musical instruments. Old ones.
Go to some antique shops and...
...rent some recorders, sitars, violas d'amore, violas da gamba...
I don't care. Send it all to
85 Rue des Vignes.
We're going to have some fun.
Mr Perrin?
I saw your little ad for violin lessons at the record shop.
Can I come in?
The lessons are not for me, but for my son.
I have a six year old and he loves music.
Six years is the right age, I think.
I'd prefer lessons at home.
He's so young.
My father also collected old instruments.
He died last year.
He left it all to me.
- I see.
I don't know much about it but I think some instruments are interesting.
If you like, I can show you when you come to the house.
The little one's on holiday at the moment.
He won't be back until next week.
I don't intend to keep the collection.
Too many memories.
I see.
You could at least have a look.
But you'd have to be quick.
When?
- Let's see...
Tomorrow is impossible.
So is Wednesday.
What are you doing this evening?
- Today?
I invited a few friends.
Would you like to come over?
This is my address: 85 Rue des Vignes.
See you tonight.
No, tonight's impossible.
I have a concert in Gaveau at nine.
You can come over after midnight.
I go to bed very late. See you later.
She's leaving the building.
No, we don't know her.
Tall, beautiful, blonde, leopard-skin.
Distinguished, you know?
Stop.
There he is.
- There he is, sir.
Come.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Did the concert go well?
My friends just left.
Yes, they're such early birds.
Maybe I'm here too late.
- Not at all. I was expecting you.
What would you like?
Champagne, whisky, cognac?
I'd like a bit of champagne.
It's great... here.
Yes, there are some nice items.
- A giraffe piano.
The rest is in the cellar.
- In the cellar?
We can have a look later if you like. Have a seat.
Not there. On the couch is more comfortable.
It's so good to relax.
I'm glad the others are gone.
So nice. A bit of intimacy from time to time.
Yes, that's true... that's true...
The others are gone. That's true...
- You seem tense.
Do I intimidate you?
- No, no, not at all.
It's hard to believe.
- What is?
All that...
But it's nothing special.
- Yes, yes. For me, it's very special.
The most beautiful woman who ever rang my doorbell...
...and that same evening, I'm drinking champagne in her apartment.
Is it cold enough?
Yes, yes, perfect.
- Are you hungry?
No, not right now.
Would you mind if I take of this jewellery?
I've had a hard day.
I'd like to get comfortable.
- By all means.
I'll be right back.
Serve yourself a drink if you want.
What is this...
What is this...
He's very good.
I see...
I lost my cigarette...
It's better like this.
Take of your jacket.
You'll feel better.
Why don't you take off your clothes?
What?
Take off your clothes.
I wouldn't mind a bit of champagne.
You're pulling my hair.
- No, it's stuck.
What's happening?
- The zipper's stuck.
You're hurting me.
- Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
It's the first time it got stuck.
Damn! Damn!
Damn!
Well?
- I don't know... it's crazy.
I can't stay here all night.
- No. We need a pair of scissors...
...to cut the bit that's stuck.
- In the bathroom.
I'll get it.
- Ouch!
Oh, sorry.
- I have to go with you.
Yes, that's better. Wait.
Don't get up. Stay on your knees.
Right. Now slowly go to the bathroom.
I'll follow.
I'm sorry. That's it.
It's a nice little apartment.
After you. Please.
What kind of a clown is this?
Done.
Did you hurt yourself?
I'll keep your hair.
Ok, go.
I'm sorry. It's crazy.
Aren't you hungry at all?
- I wouldn't mind a little bite now.
Cold chicken, roast beef, ham?
- A bit of chicken would be nice.
Oh no!
We'll have dinner on the bed.
My nose's bleeding. I think it stopped.
The bagpipes hit me.
The bagpipes?
- The bagpipes.
But I'm better now. I'm better.
Eat.
- I'm sorry. I'm not hungry anymore.
I'll turn off the lights. You get undressed and get into bed.
You've had enough problems for tonight.
The platter.
I think I knocked it over.
How many sugars?
- Two.
He's taking his time to get undressed.
Are you separated from your husband?
- Yes.
And the little boy's in the countryside?
- Yes.
With his grandparents?
- Yes.
What does that idiot care?
- No comments please.
I'm in bed.
Some coffee?
Some coffee?
- No, no, no.
My feet are frozen.
- That's alright.
What a strange day.
- Why?
It started this morning. My mates nailed down my shoes in front of the door...
...of my room, in a hotel in Munich.
- I see.
They're always playing pranks on me.
I left my shoes outside...
...so they would be polished and they nailed them down.
I had to go home wearing one brown shoe and one black shoe.
And then there was toothpaste in my shaving cream.
And shaving cream in my toothpaste.
And nobody finds that strange.
And then I went running in the park, with a friend and he had visions.
Otherwise a very normal guy.
Sports-loving, strong.
Not the type for hallucinations.
And suddenly he hears voices.
And then at the concert tonight,
I snapped a string.
And now I'm in bed with you.
And then you kiss me.
And my feet are frozen.
Ok, they're having sex.
They're making love at
85 Rue des Vignes.
As you can see, your protégé enjoys certain perks.
Do you feel good?
- Yes.
Me too.
I'm going to tell you something
I never told anybody.
Yes?
It's a secret.
- I see.
I'm not only a violinist.
I also do something else.
I'm a composer.
- What?
I'm also a composer but nobody knows that.
I wrote an opera. It took me three years.
And I'm still working on it.
I'll publish it when it's finished.
What?
- I feel like dedicating it to you.
What are you doing?
- I'll play it to you.
What?
- Only the main theme.
You're not going to play the violin now.
- You're the first one to hear it.
I'm warning you. It's very modern.
- Come on, François!
What's that?
- What is it?
Turn down the volume.
Enough.
Don't you like it?
- It's very beautiful, but not now.
It's very beautiful but who wants an opera at 3 AM?
Are you angry?
- Not at all.
Come here then.
Yes, you're angry.
- Absolutely not.
Come here.
And there we go again.
We won't get anywhere tonight.
Take him to the property.
- Yes, sir.
Oh là là! You made me lose a night, idiot!
You should have confronted him.
Toulouse's paying him and I'll pay him more.
Can't you use your head from time to time?
When? When he gets my hair in his zipper?
When he hits himself with bagpipes, writes an opera, makes love to me...
...very well, by the way.
- We're going in circles, damn.
We're going in circles.
- Sir...
What?
- I don't think he's a pro.
Well, I don't care what you think.
Get dressed and go to the shop.
Oh, my Christine!
Oh, my Christine.
Christine?
- No, it's Paulette.
Ah! Hello, Paulette.
- Who's Christine?
Listen, Paulette, don't come to my place this afternoon.
I met a wonderful girl last night and I think I love her.
Are you pulling my leg?
- No, I'm not joking.
Poucet and Chaperon are the problem.
If we could get rid of them...
...there'd be no problem. Easy.
- Easily said...
I want the violinist here in one hour.
- Perrache just arrived at Toulouse's.
I won't wear a coat this morning.
- It's not cold, sir.
I'll stay in the office for a bit.
I have a meeting at the ministry at 11.
I see.
- Yes, the violinist finished his job.
He's going to report to us at 11.
Some people are in for a nasty surprise, Perrache!
Find me the violinist right away and kill him.
You have one hour.
Hello?
- François? François?
I'm calling you because I'm sad.
I can't stop crying. It's crazy.
Have pity on me, François.
I love you.
Yes, yes, I love you.
I'm lost when I'm not in your arms.
I won't ask you to sound like a horse. I promise, François.
But don't leave me, darling.
You must have achieved what you wanted. Milan has gone mad...
...and the violinist is a dead man.
- Look at the road when you're driving.
Tell Poucet and Chaperon to stop surveillance and go home.
They did a good job.
Stop surveillance... but then the tall blond guy will be killed.
Stop questioning my orders and look at the road.
Tell Poucet and Chaperon to go home. Do it.
Chaperon? Perrache speaking.
The boss wants you to tighten surveillance.
They're going to try something, this morning. Be very vigilant.
They're going through the garden.
We're too old for this.
- Hush! Don't move.
Where's my tie?
I think it's in the living room.
Hello?
Hello, François. Christine speaking.
I have to talk to you.
I'm in the café on the corner.
Yes. Come right away.
It's very urgent.
Hello, Christine? Christine?
Talk to me, Christine.
Hello, Christine...
What are you doing here?
Go home. Mr. Milan doesn't want you hanging around here.
Understood?
He's gone.
- Yes.
Don't move.
Come on, we're not going to shoot each other, are we?
We're colleagues. We're not going to kill each other, are we?
A blonde. Beautiful. She was here
3 minutes ago. She made a phone call.
Yes, she left.
- What do you mean, she left?
Well, she just left.
Maurice! Sorry, I can't see you now.
I'm meeting somebody.
There are 3 corpses at your place.
What?
- 3 corpses at your place.
I came to kill you.
There are 3 corpses at your place.
What's wrong with you now?
- Come have a look.
But...
But Maurice, why did you want to kill me?
- You two jerked me around.
Both of you. I caught Paulette on the phone, hypocrite!
Hypocrite! Bastard! Go in.
Well?
I don't understand...
- Come, sit down.
There were 3 corpses in this room.
- Yes, of course.
I'm not crazy, François.
- Of course not.
I heard Paulette on the phone.
- Yes. And you heard her...
...have sex in a van yesterday and today you saw 3 corpses at my place.
Not a good sign?
- I'm not a doctor, you know.
Drink a glass of water.
- A glass of water?
Yes, it'll do you good.
A big glass of water
I'm not thirsty.
- Look at your face.
I'll get you a glass of water.
- But I'm not thirsty at all.
Here.
I'm not doing well, François.
Not well at all.
There are 3 victims, sir:
Two of Milan's men and Chaperon.
- Excuse me?
They had it out with each other, but I assure you...
...the tall blond guy is fine.
- I thought I told you to tell...
...Poucet and Chaperon to go home.
- Really? I must have misunderstood.
I told them to tighten surveillance.
You definitely misunderstood.
I'm very sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to go against you.
I only wanted to protect an innocent person.
Well, you failed anyway.
Now is the hour of truth.
Milan's entering the scene.
On one side, there's Milan with...
...all his gang and on the other side the tall blond guy with the black shoe.
This should end in a big showdown, like in good western movies.
I have to go for a pee.
- Alright, go then.
Come with me.
- Oh, come on.
Please, come with me.
- Leave me alone.
Christine!
Christine!
You were told not to come back here.
Get in.
Christine! Christine!
Christine!
- Sir, your glasses.
Lucien!
- My God!
François?
François!
Get up.
Come here.
Turn around.
- Like this?
Very good.
I'm colonel Milan, the assistant of your boss.
Oh! Sorry, sir.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
Perrache!
Perrache.
The tall blond guy with the black shoe.
Who is it?
It's an asshole trap, sir.
What's going on with you?
- Nothing. I'm fine.
Maurice. But Maurice...
- Go upstairs. Everything's fine.
Everything's going smoothly.
You'll see everything's fine.
You don't seem to be doing too well.
- I have a musician's insurance.
Social security...
If I find a good clinic...
...they'll refund me everything.
Hello, madam. Goodbye, madam.
Christine. Where were you?
I looked for you everywhere.
I'll tell you an incredible story.
Mysterious death of colonel Milan.
Toulouse says:
"Milan was a remarkable man."
Maurice.
Darling.
- Bye bye, Paulette.
Maurice.
Stay here. Don't move.
Come say goodbye to François.
Goodbye, François.
The doctors are reducing his tranquillizers. He's getting better.
He has no more nightmares.
See you tomorrow. I'll be there at 2.
- See you tomorrow.
Everything will be back to the way it was, darling.
Better go home.
He'll catch a cold.
Come.
Have a good trip. Be good in Munich.
- Bye bye.
Going to Munich?
- No. To Rio, in Brazil.
Ah, to Rio.
That's not the same desk.
No, let me.
I'll check it in myself.
Hey, sir!
Christine? Are you alright?
- I'd be better in your arms.
Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you.
When he'll be back from Rio...
- Yes, sir.
...and come back he will, you must contact him.
After all, the guy has a talent.
Everybody has the right to a private life.
Article 9 of the Penal Code.
THE TALL BLOND GUY WITH A BLACK SHOE
- Must I go directly home?
- Would you like to get a drink?
No. They won't serve me.
They think I should be drinking fruit juice.
Like I can't handle liquor!
Thank you.
The next one's on me.
Just tell me about Legnani.
- Right now?
- Yes.
The painter... he went to
Brazil with his mother and 2 sisters, to find theirfortune.
When they returned, they were apparently wealthierthan before they left, but motherwas dead.
They came back and built that little house.
Excuse me.
- How did they live?
- What?
- How did they live?
- He was poor...
He borrowed from everyone...
Even though they had a fortune, he had nothing. His sisters controlled the money.
You know, I knew him.
I was 7 or 8 years old.
She was dying. My mom was sick. He came to draw her.
We called him the Painter of Agony. He liked to paint people who were dying.
He was a little crazy.
We could also say the same about his sisters.
By painting death he was trying to control nature, to confront death.
He was obsessed with death.
And the dying.
Could you recognize the sound of his voice?
Could you recognize it?
It's the kind of voice you don't forget.
He talked like a psycho!
Like a machine gun...
Then suddenly he would stop and start chanting.
- Psycho!
- Wait.
He was really crazy because of his sisters.
- Plug it in. Quick.
- Yeah. Okay.
Listen to this.
There's nothing on this damn thing!
- Did you touch it?
- Not since the other night.
This tape was important to me, bitch!
What's wrong?
I didn't touch it!
I'm sorry...
I'll be right back.
Francesca!
Coppola?
Are you awake?
I slept a little bit, but I had a bad dream.
I'm sorry.
I'm scared, you know.
Me too, but for me it's different.
I'm more afraid when I sleep.
There are a lot of things here, and they're heavy!
- Is everything packed?
- Yes, just take it downstairs.
Incredible. Look, dear...
"To verify the death experience of these models to reproduce the very last moments of death, his sisters provided him with victims for his art"...
...Sisters!
Why did he write in third person? Like a researcher, to communicate with the dead mother of Legnani.
He talks of communion...
...and human sacrifice.
There's a possibility that a man, today, can communicate with the dead, during the ritualistic painting.
Stop it!
That's enough!
Shut up! I'm begging... stop talking about it!
I can't stand this place anymore. I want to leave.
Rio de Janeiro.
From Rio de Janeiro.
What? What is it? Tell me.
Probably the answer to all the craziness.
Who is it?
- I'm sure it's them!
- Them?
- I must leave now.
- Take me with you.
No, stay here, get some rest.
Don't open the doorfor anyone.
Beautiful flowers, beautiful flowers in the garden, show my love foryou.
Beautiful flowers, beautiful flowers in my garden, how do they grow, my lord?
Even today the sisters are committing murderthough art.
- What does this mean?
- Who's there?
Ah, it's you!
What are you doing here?
It's them! I tell you the painter's sisters are...
...the killers in the fresco!
Look! Take a look!
It's true, they look the same.
Where did you find the picture?
We're beginning to understand what my friend had figured out
- before he died.
- I don't know
- why you're so excited.
- I feel possessed by this!
The painting...
...the death of Antonio... it's all too strange!
Yes, I believe you, but I may not be on the right path.
I look at that cross and have serious doubts.
- You're scared too?
- Yes.
God forgot to give me courage. I'll admit it...
Promise me you'll stop this crusade, heading the wrong way.
Why?
I've seen many like you break down in the confessional.
Did you know the old lady at the house is dying?
I was visiting her...
I gave herthe last-rites.
Let me see.
Yeah, it's definitely them.
But tell me, where did you find this picture?
It even surprises me that those two would allow a picture to be taken at all.
I've never seen one before.
Yeah, I know.
Well, what can you do?
I think being a psycho is contageous.
When my wife was young she was beautiful.
She was infatuated with Legnani, but he would only talk about what he did with his 2 sisters.
A sad little house, close to the railroad tracks...
They moved there after the trip to Brazil, and they brought back a beastly savage religion.
One night, after he worked on the fresco, Legnani decided to end it all. Whenever he painted, he was in such frenzy...
...madness engulfed his soul.
He couldn't separate the reality from the illusion.
Blood and colors mixed together in his tortured brain.
His sisters pushed him...
He finally stopped it all.
He forced them to watch as he covered his body with alcohol and set it ablaze.
He ran into the wilderness, his body was neverfound.
- I told you: "presumed death".
- Why "presumed death"?
How many times must I repeat?
If it says "presumed death"...
4th of June, 1931, it says
"presumed", not "confirmed".
Do you understand?
Presumed!
Caught on fire.
Run off. Period.
- Must I repeat it again?
- No...
Presumed death...
So he could still be alive.
What! With burns all over his body, such a man wouldn't be too difficult to recognize!?!
I need 3 copies of these certificates fortomorrow.
Look them up in the masterfile.
How many times do I say it.
This is not my job.
By the way, you haven't finished yourwork at the church, right?
- No. Why?
- Because it's been destroyed.
Can you tell me who did this?
I don't know anything about it. Someone, perhaps.
Maybe it was the Holy Spirit!
You poor son of a bitch.
Maybe we should call a real specialist.
Leave me alone, you degenerate.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Francesca!
Where are you?
Ah, there you are.
- It's been over an hour.
- I made a phone call.
- To whom? Do I know him?
- No, you don't.
I called the home office in Rome.
I resigned my teaching job.
- You don't want to stay here?
- No.
Stefano, you know I hate it here.
I hate the amblance in this house.
I want to run away.
Something bad is going to happen at any moment.
You said we would always be together.
You're never here...
...I feel so alone and I'm so scared.
Understand?
Do you want to leave me?
No, I won't leave you.
There's a train that leaves tomorrow...
...at nine o'clock... let's go.
So stop crying.
Why didn't you wake me? Are you going back to the church?
Last night you promised we would leave together.
Why did you lie to me?
I didn't lie. I have a bit of time.
I need to check something.
You can count on me.
I'll give up everything foryou.
My love.
Somebody there?
Good day.
I brought back the bike.
It's outside.
- So you're leaving.
- Yeah, I'm leaving.
- Can you tell me something?
- Sure.
- Do you sell muriatic acid?
- Of course. Want some?
Who brought some recently?
It was used to destroy the fresco.
I sell it often to everybody in the village...
...Who knows?
You don't write it down?
Why? I know everybody.
Everybody buys it.
It's used to clean.
I sell it to everybody.
Take me home. I need to pick up Francesca.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
- They abused me.
Who?
Them, all of them.
They were afraid I would talk, but she thought she could buy my silence with a bit of booze.
But no more! The last drink!
The sisters are still here.
Alive.
Get closer. Listen...
I'm the only one who has seen them in action, and it's horrible.
- What do you mean?
- They tried to get me, but I escaped.
When I was little,
I went to school with them.
Everybody thought
I was stupid because I didn't go to church, but I had a good reason.
I knew what was there. I knew the danger. I don't want to...
...die there. Others shut their eyes. Ignored it. But me...
...Coppola is still alive!
Why Coppola is still alive?
Because I ignore the others.
- You think I'm rotten?
- No.
- For real?
- Yeah.
Here the walls have ears.
My friend died because of that.
True?
I don't know about yourfriend, but I know...
You're curious.
There's a place where people like you...
...lose their heads!
Come with me! Quick!
Is it you?
It's here.
This is a weird house.
Many people have disappeared here.
Why'd you bring me here?
I know the missing people are all here. Buried here.
There's an example.
Once, I thought I would end up in this hole too.
Stefano?
Stefano?
You weren't expecting me, were you?!?
You take care of kids, right?
So take care of me!
You aren't scared of me, are you?
- Nobody's scared of Lidio.
- No!
You like me, don't you?
There are many things I want!
Your skin drives me crazy!
Don't you want me?
Give yourself to me!
Why resist. I'm stronger!
Stop it!
Why are you fighting me, bitch?
- Don't scream!
- Stop it!
You'll wake up the old lady!
- Shut up! Don't fight me!
- No! No!
I'll take you to a house with odd windows... smiling...
Go get Francesca.
I'll wait foryou.
Stefano, don't take long.
Come fast!
Francesca!
Francesca, are you ready?
Francesca, are you there?
Madam, have you seen...?
Francesca!
No!!
Francesca!
Coppola!
Yeah, it's here.
Follow me. This way!
I know where they took her.
- There, right there.
- Hurry up. Dig!
Cigarette?
What now, chief? Continue?
This probably surprises you, but nothing's here.
I'm sure there's something.
I saw bones, blood...
Who showed you that?
Who brought you here?
Coppola, Mr. Solmi's chauffeur.
- Coppola? Are you sure?
- Yes.
Okay me, let's go.
Coppola is a drink idiot.
He made you look stupid, but you're not the first.
Hey you! Where did you find him?
By the ravine nearthe church.
We'll get him to you in a moment.
- He's heavy as a bull.
- Pull a little.
There must be more alcohol than water in his body.
What are these scars?
I've never seen them before.
They're war injuries.
He stepped on a mine.
God, he looks terrible.
Take the body to the morgue.
Come on, men.
Does anybody know where he was all day?
No, he hasn't been home for a week.
Oh well, check on it.
You. I don't want you to go anywhere. Stay with me.
No, betteryet. Come to my office in the morning.
Understand? Sir?
I understand.
Come on, let's go.
I'll take you to the hotel.
- I have to find them first.
- It's not the right time. Let's go.
Yes? One moment.
- You're wanted on the phone.
- Who?
I don't know.
- Hello?
- Hi...
...It's me, Francesca.
Come! I'm waiting foryou...
...at the house.
My love...
...I'm scared.
I'm waiting foryou at home.
Come now... hurry up!
You degenerate!
Aren't you ashamed?
Come, come closer.
I'm going to show you something.
See. It's my little brother.
He will return to us soon.
We continue to bring models to him.
He lived through others people's death.
Come with me.
You are a friend of our little brother, aren't you, sir?
My colors... from my veins...
Purity, Death...
Do you know how we keep him? Formaldehyde.
Lidio brings us new formaldehyde every day, but today Lidio stopped to see your girlfriend.
He raped her, he killed her.
We had planes for her, but he messed everything up.
We had to find a replacement.
Come, don't be scared.
He looks like the man in the fresco, doesn't he?
Bravo! You didn't miss!
Hold him!
He's moving too much!
Get him from the other side!
He's probably hiding in this bushes.
It's useless to keep looking.
He won't get far.
Tomorrow we'll come back and get his body.
We'll get him.
Please, I beg you!
Open up!
Solmi!
Hello, give me the police.
Open up!
My God, Stefano!
What happened?
You're my only hope.
I know what's going on here, it's them.
I know everything.
Call a doctor, please.
The painter's sisters...
Legnani's sisters are still alive!
Alive...
...still alive...
One of them owns the house!
- The paraplegic?
- Yeah, they're alive.
The other one... I didn't see herface...
That's a nasty wound. It would make a nice portrait.
Legnani would make a masterpiece out of it!
But you are...
Beautiful flowers, beautiful flowers in the garden, show my love... for you... my lord...
Laura, come see!
... motorway and the...
With no option but to return to Adelaide last Sunday
Hello?
Hi, Mark.
Did you just ring a minute ago?
No, no. No reason.
Oh, will you hold on a sec?
Hello again.
No, no, we won't be able to.
Peter's being a real shit.
You know he is when he digs his heels in.
Actually, we're, uh, not talking at the moment.
You're still going to Eldon, aren't you?
I mean, just 'cause I can't.
Marsh? Marsh, you there?
Hey, what's going on, Mar?
Sorry, I dropped something.
I didn't catch what you said.
Where's Peter gonna drag you off to?
I don't know.
Some beach up north. Should be really great with the weather we're having.
Shit.
If I had a pint, for sure.
You're the one that wants to get away early.
Oh well, is everything ready, is it?
- Nearly.
- Huh.
I thought you were gonna ask Mrs. What's-er-name to feed Cricket.
I didn't feel right about asking someone we don't even know to babysit YOUR dog.
- Well, I'll ask her.
- She's not home.
I don't think Cricket's gonna starve to death with three whole cans of dog food there.
If ya think she's fat, she can go without.
She's too fat anyway.
You can't just prop a pile a of dog food down on the porch and expect her to...
Look, why don't we take her?
We'll take her.
Look at the poor ol' bugger, y'know?
She's knows we're going away.
Then why don't you and Cricket go away and I'll stay at home and bark at the birds!
Speculations concerning the flying saucer
I was listening to that.
The public... sleeps..
What's that?
Get in touch with Mark or Frieda?
Yes.
Told him we couldn't come?
Yes!
Can they struggle along without us this weekend?
- They still going to Eldon?
- Yes!
Aren't we talking?
Luv, look, uh...
I'm not trying to start anything, I'm not.
I just think that, uh...
All things considered, you know, we...
We.. we should back off for a while, all four of us.
You can lie in the sun. Recuperate.
Recuperate?!
Anyone would think I'd been sick!
- Oh no, it's me too, luv, I need a change.
- Oh, my...
Alright.
Alright, you're not wild about camping but you're not exactly roughing it either.
2000 dollars worth of camping gear
I should hope not! For that we could have had a VIP suite at the Southern Cross.
Oh, you'll be an authority on hotel rooms.
Fucked!
I see.
Jesus.
Bit quiet for a long weekend, isn't it?
Too far from the highway to make that much difference.
All we get round here is the lost and the locals.
Ya in from the Smythe?
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah?
- Where ya headin'?
- Moonda. Moonda Beach.
Where's that?
It's just about five miles up the road, isn't it?
You heard of any.. Moonda Beach, Kim?
- No.
- Just before the abbatoir?
Ah, there's all bloody tracks and scrub up that way these days.
Ain't seen much traffic. Not since the sand mining moved out.
Oh... '63.
'64, whaddya know?
Never heard a name Moonda Beach there.
- Where are we?
- Oh, we're nearly there.
It's just down the road.
Come on!
Shit!
Hey, Cricket!
G'day, girl.
You knew, didn't you?
That was close.
I ran over a kangaroo tonight.
Well, that looks promising.
Ah, gettin' close now. I can smell the ocean.
That's the same tree.
It's not the same tree. How could it be?
We're going round in circles, Peter.
We've been on the same track for nearly an hour.
- How could it be..
- Then where are we, Peter?
May I offer a suggestion?
Let's go back and spend the night at the hotel.
We'll sleep in the car.
- Here?
- Yeah.
We must be close now.
We'll catch some sleep and we'll find the beach in the morning.
- I'm sorry for the...
- Shh!
Stop, Cricket!
Good morning!
Where are we?
We're here.
Sun is shining.
- Birds are singing.
- Your bacon's burning.
Shit!
Fuck!
What'd you do with my clothes?
What do you want clothes for?
I mean, who's gonna see you except me, and a seagull?
You know, we, uh..
We just missed the marker last night.
We'd gone another hundred yards we would've made it.
Well..
Don't congratulate me for doing such an extraordinary, splendid job of cutting up the camp.
Clever boy.
What have you been doing to the tree?
- Chopping it down.
- Why?
Why not?
Hey, come with me. I want to show you something.
Ta-daaa!
What do you reckon, ay? What do you reckon?
What do we do for toilets?
Toilets? She wants toilets.
I'm not the outdoors type, Peter.
I love you.
Cross you heart and hope to die?
- What's that?
- What? - There, in your hair!
Bastard!
What did you call me?
- Nothing!
- Ay?
Nothing!
Say uncle!
Uncle.
Uncle with sugar on top.
If you don't get off, I'll piss myself.
Oh no!
Bully.
Go find a rat!
Go get a rat! Get a rat!
Go fetch a rat!
Peter!
The tree with the arrow carved in, is it just down the track?
Yeah, I'll told ya last night.
If we'd gone another hundred yards, we woulda been...
No, a track in theory. How could we have gone around in circles?
Obviously, we didn't.
I was right the first time.
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
What's the matter? Cricket, shut up!
There's a thing in the water!
There was a dark shape out there in the water!
It coulda been a shark or something.
What've you'd done if I'd died?
What kind of question is that, for Chrissake?
What would you've done? Suppose.
Christ! I don't know.
Would you've remarried?
You didn't die so let's forget about it.
Alright?
What'd you want for to eat tonight, steak or chicken?
What's wrong with a bit of fresh fish?
Nothing. Except we haven't got any.
Well, catch some.
I'll think I'll defrost something anyway.
Peter, where's the insecticide?
In the tent.
What do you think that noise was last night?
Sounded like a baby crying.
You're not going to tell me it's a tomcat. Not out here.
I don't know, luv.
Not sure I heard anything at all.
Where are you going?
Oh, I thought I might go for a bit of a wander.
What are you gonna do?
Think I might...
Christ!
You all right?
Jesus Christ!
Funny thing shouldn't of gone off. It was on safety.
I put the safety on it.
Get the stick! Go on, fetch the stick!
Fetch the stick! Fetch the stick!
Drop it.
Come on! Come on!
All right!
All right, you guys!
This is Clayton, see?
Shit.
Very funny.
I'm very cranky.
Sorry.
S' alright.
- I just can't get it..
- Don't worry about it. Y'know, it's alright.
Dr. Larkin said it could take a couple of weeks.
Well, it's, uh, been a couple of months.
Well, I'm very sorry, Peter. I can't help it.
Is it.. painful?
Or is it more of a mental block?
What exactly is the problem?
- I'm only a man who's gonna have..
- It's only temporary!
Saw another car down the end of the beach.
Don't get the place to ourselves.
Look, what's shitting you anyway?
- I told you, I've got a...
- No, I mean what's REALLY shitting you?
I'm bored!
For Chrissakes, bloody false act, get off your ass and do something!
Instead of smoking cigarettes and reading dirty books?
Amuse yourself!
I wanted to go to Eldon, remember?
Well, alright then, take the car and piss off. Go on, piss off!
Peter, I'm not the type for crapping in the sunshine and yawning around campfires.
The water's too cold, the sun's too hot.
Alright, then, so what am I supposed to DO?
Oh, why don't you go fuck yourself, Marsha?
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
Peter, it was heading straight for...
I know, I know.
It's all right.
I saw the thing.
But it's OK, I'm alright.
I'm OK now, darling.
It's OK.
Bit precoccupied, my luv?
Let's go home.
We just got here.
Make it worth your while, gorgeous.
How you like where I leave my dirty socks?
- Should of married your mother.
- You've got better tits.
I'm serious, Peter.
About marrying my mother?
About going home.
Why?
Beat the traffic.
You're kidding, aren't ya?
Yes!
What'd you do with the chuck?
I put it back in the fridge.
Luv?
Marsh?
- Yeah-ha?
- This chuck's gone off.
- Couldn't have.
- Well it has.
Fuck, it's bloody rotten. You musta left it out too long.
- Impossible.
- Well, have a look at it.
It couldn't go off that quick.
It's got mold on it.
Luv?
I wasn't kidding. Let's get out of here.
- Oh, come on.
- I don't like it.
A little bit of mold...
I'm not talking about a fucking chuck!
There's that thing in the surf.
It's dead. Anyway, most sharks are harmless.
Peter, it wasn't a shark.
Of course it was a shark.
Hey, what's this?
I think it's an eagle egg.
Hey, I wonder if you can eat eagle eggs.
We can make an omelet.
Gonna crack a beer. D'ya want one?
No thanks.
An eagle attacked me!
Jeez!
Eagles don't attack people.
Spear guns don't go off with the safety on.
It's was the chuck.
He was probably after the chuck.
You can smell that thing a mile away.
It was a she. She wanted her egg.
But, you didn't even see it!
Why in the name of God did you do that?
Just an egg.
It's a living thing.
What's the matter with you?
You KNOW what's the matter with me!
You didn't have to smash it!
I didn't have to have an abortion, Peter!
- What are you doing?
- Leaving!
- Oh, for Chrissakes, Marcia.
- No, no that's it!
I've had it. You stay and play with the wildlife.
I'll be at the hotel.
Are you coming or not?
Not!
Hello again.
What's wrong with it?
I've switched it on the alternate battery to run the fridge.
Well, switch it back!
No.
Try the horn.
Marsh?
Hey!
Hey Marsh?
Hey Sweetheart? Sweetheart.
Get out of there.
No possum.
What's ya doing there, ay?
Want a nice grape?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on. Take the grape.
Come on.
Marcia! Marcia, open up for Chrissakes!
Open up!
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
We'll leave in the morning.
Oh man!
How's your head?
Fine.
Bloody possum.
- I'll do that.
- I don't mind.
I thought we'd get an early start.
Let go the guitar!
Don't scratch it.
Sorry.
Thought we might have time to drive back by the Indian route.
You mean via Hilda?
No sense in wasting the rest of the weekend.
Well?
- Can I help you with the tent?
- I'll do the tent.
Right, I'll finish packing here.
Spilt the sugar.
I'm sorry, I'm only trying to help!
Well, if you want to help, why don't you go out for a walk or something and let me do the packing.
I don't want to go for a walk.
I told you it wasn't a shark.
No, it certainly isn't a shark.
Then what is it?
A "bunya."
A what?
It's a dugong.
A sea cow.
Apparently there used to be thousands of 'em.
All along the coast until the lot were killed off for oil.
Ugly!
It's not very pretty out of the water, is she?
Crabs have been at her, by the look of it.
Stinks.
Well..
There's the source of the noises you've been hearing.
She's probably got a pup in the area.
I reckon the young sound just like a human baby when they cry.
You poor old lady.
...it'll take ten minutes to get that thing in there...
Peter, it's...
I don't want to go anywhere.
- I just think it's a pity to rush off, that's all.
- You promised.
I'm not saying I want to spend another night here, y'know.
- You promised.
- Look, look.
What's the difference if we leave this afternoon or...
You promised!
All right, I'll drive to the other end of the beach and see the people camped there, that's all!
Couple of hours!
We'll be back here and out of here by 1 or 2 at the latest.
They won't be there. They've gone.
What ya think I'm scared of the dark, Marcia?
If you go down in the woods today.. you might get a big surprise
If you go down in the woods today... you won't believe your eyes.
Back to being cannibals, are we?
You wanted to drive up the beach, we're driving up the beach.
What else do you want?
It's not a question of what I want, Marcia.
I mean I realize that I can't always everything I want.
I accept that.
What you don't seem able to accept is the fact that the reality of our.. situation demands...
You being philosophical?
There's no point in talking rationally to you when you're being philosophical.
I think I see things more clearly than you do, Marcia.
I can stand back and deal with situations in perspective.
I really do see you so much more clearly now.
Self-indulgent maggot.
You drag me to this awful, ugly place...
You poke your head out of your 2000 dollar shellac
...and call it reality. Take it from me.
You're not Tarzan and I'm certainly not Jane by a long shot.
What are you trying to prove?
Reality, my pet, is at 5 pm and dinner parties for the right people and making a whole lot of bread.
Those are your own words, you bastard.
Is reality screwing the neighbors and murdering the unborn?
You prick!
You were so damned hot for Freda you pushed mark and me together.
And then you bellow like a wounded tomcat when the whole groddy plan backfires in your face.
If it wasn't murder..
Why didn't you tell me right away?
None of your business.
Do you think I'd of agreed to having it destroyed?
Nothing was destroyed!
You said it cried. Those were your words.
Oh stop it! You pig!
I'd rather sleep with mad dogs than sleep with you again!
Oh that's it, yeah, that's it. Blame me instead of yourself.
- You didn't want a kid.
- Me?!
Me, I love kids.
Shit, I despise you.
It was all a grotesque mistake, wasn't it?
You knew it wasn't mine.
So you panicked and you attacked.
Just like you attacked that eagle's egg.
Oh, spare me the grotty symbolism.
Hmph! This week it'll be a divorce, next week it'll be guitar lessons.
You won't leave me though, sugar.
Because weak as you think I am..
I'm all you've got.
We'll see.
How we relish the tast of human flesh, ay, luv?
Neo-cannibals.
Estranged cannibals... filing for divorce on Monday.
Long weekend, sugar.
You'll have to miss tennis and do it Tuesday.
- Well, where are they?
- They were here yesterday.
Well, they're not now.
What are you doing?
- I'm gonna have a look around.
- Peter.. - I'll be five minutes, alright?
Five minutes, I swear to God, I'll take the car and I'll leave you here!
...today, conducted its first nuclear test this year..
Say, fella.
Don't look at me like that.
See if we can get out of here, ay?
Marcia!
No!
Let me go!
Can't we go any faster?
The last thing we need now is a broken axle.
Well, what took you so long?
Look, we're gonna have to notify the authorities.
You notify the authorities 'cause I'm going straight home!
Where's Cricket?
Cricket?
Cricket!
Was she with us when we went down the beach?
Don't know. Haven't seen her since this morning.
Cricket!
Look down the beach, will ya? I'll look around here.
It's getting late. We're not gonna make it!
Well, we'd better hurry then, hadn't we!
Cricket!
Cricket!
Cricket!
Cricket!
Peter!
It's still alive, Peter.
Can't be.
It is!
Come and look at it.
Ah, Jesus! We can't just leave without her!
Look, it's not gonna take very long to go down to the other end of the beach!
- I think I'm gonna hit you!
- Look, Marcia!
I'm not leaving without Cricket.
Cricket's dead.
You're lying.
I buried her.
Where?
In the bushes.
You're lying!
I'm not going without Cricket.
Be dark soon.
Well, well, well.
Cricket!
Cricket!
Marcia! Come back!
Wanna come in here?
Come here with me?
You wouldn't leave me, wouldja, girl?
Ay?
You wouldn't leave me... wouldja?
Cricket.
Shut up, Cricket!
Cricket! Shut up!
Jesus.
Aw, Jesus, Cricket!
Get out of the car, Cricket!
Get out of it!
Get out of the car, Cricket!
There's some more flowers, kids.
Go pick 'em.
Yeah!
That's a pretty one!
- I don't have one.
- Well, go look for one, over there.
Oh, that's beautiful. Let me look at that.
Let me look at that!
Now you can take them home to your parents. Don't they smell nice!
Hi.
Too much trouble to pick the mail up off the floor, Geoffrey?
Hello?
Look at this flower.
All right! Attaway!
You know, I think I actually found something rare.
What?
- This plant. I think it's a grex.
- A what?
G-R-E-X. That's when two species cross-pollinate and produce a third completely unique one.
And listen to this:
"Epilobic, from the Greek epi: upon, and lobos: a pod."
"Many of the species are dangerous weeds and should be avoided."
Dangerous?
In the garden.
See? Look how quickly it roots.
"Their rapid and widespread growth was even observed in many of the war-torn cities of Europe."
"lndeed, some of these plants may thrive on devastated ground."
Why don't we go up to Vail for the weekend? Fly up Friday, hm?
OK, maybe. Sure.
Geoffrey! I'm trying to read!
You're in a good mood.
Well, I got something to look forward to tonight - playoffs.
Geoffrey.
- What?
- I'm reading.
OK! I'll put the earphones on.
There, see? Happy?
Never mind. I'll go downstairs.
Comment? Qui est là?
Who is it?
Department of Health.
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bennell.
How nice to see you.
What is that supposed to be?
It is cervelles en matelote.
In English, what would I be eating if I ate that?
- Ah. Calves' brains in red wine.
- Red wine and what else?
Mais, c'est impossible. It's impossible.
It's a secret, Mr Bennell.
You don't have any secrets from the Department of Health, Henri.
A good young Burgundy, brown stock, thyme, parsley - just a sprig.
Capers,... a fresh bay leaf, and garlic.
- That's all?
- Oui. Yes.
- What is that?
- A caper.
No.
Do you presume to tell us what is in this stock?
- It's a rat turd.
- A what?
A rat turd.
- A caper!
- A rat turd.
A caper!
If it's a caper, eat it.
I'm gonna bring you up for permit revocation, Henri.
You're charging way too much to be serving crap like that in here.
But, Monsieur, it is an accident.
You know how careful we are.
Hello?
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.
- Wake you up?
- No. Hi, Matthew.
- They busted the window of my car.
- Oh, no!
Threw a bottle of wine at it - not even good wine.
The Warriors won, so I guess your household's happy.
Yes.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.
If you go to sleep now, you can get up early.
Oh, Matthew...
If you can come in at 7.30, you can run the tests before 8 o'clock.
Stop! Matthew... stop.
I'm not coming in before 8 o'clock
- in the morning!
- I gotta force the abatement hearing.
- Wednesday's their only free slot.
- No, Matthew!
I will not be there before eight!
I nominated you for
Civil Servant ofthe Year award.
It's true. I think you'll win.
OK, OK, OK. I'll be in at 7.30.
I'll run a salmonella test for you.
Thank you. See you in the morning.
Good night. I'll see you in the morning.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Geoffrey, my God!
How long have you been up?
Not long.
What are you doing?
Geoffrey?
I wanna throw the book at him. Those scallops are just cut-up pieces of skate.
I'm sorry. I can start the tests right away.
It's OK...
And something's wrong with the potato.
Either the sour cream is phoney, or the chives.
I'm sorry. I got up on time.
It was Geoffrey.
- What did the mad dentist do this time?
- I don't know. He was just weird.
He's crazy. All dentists are crazy.
- Are you late?
- No.
He was weird not the way he usually is.
That can only be an improvement.
Well, it's not. It's got me really nervous.
Tell him to shape up or get out.
- It's his house.
- Make him an offer.
- Here's something that'll cheer you up.
- What?
Ever seen one of these up close?
- What is it?
- What does it look like?
- A caper?
- A caper?
What is it?
- A rat turd, but the sauce was delicious.
- I got you a rat.
- Did you find one?
- I've got it. It was a biggie.
OK, we'll get a declaration of "unsanitary" on him.
- I'll talk to you later, OK?
- OK.
- What can I do?
- Nothing. Don't worry. Go on.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hey, come on. Tell me what I've done.
- I understand today's plan.
Something's come up, Elizabeth.
I have to go back out again.
Now? Weren't we going to the game?
The Warriors.
I gave the tickets to a patient.
You're not gonna see tonight's game?
No choice.
Geoffrey, what is the matter with you?
I'm fine. I just have to go to a meeting.
Meeting? What kind of a meeting?
Elizabeth, I don't think
I have to justify my every move to you.
Geoffrey, this isn't like you.
Please, come on. I just want it to be nice...
Elizabeth, what's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Come in!
Hi.
How you doing?
Is it true that if you think you're losing your mind, you're not?
Well, I hope so.
I know this is gonna sound insane.
What?
Geoffrey is not Geoffrey.
- How do you know?
- I know.
On the outside Geoffrey is still Geoffrey, but on the inside
I can tell there is something different.
Something is missing.
- What?
- Emotion, feelings.
He's just not the same person.
Really, you know what I mean?
I know it sounds crazy.
Yeah. I know what you mean, I think.
Have you eaten?
- I'm not hungry.
- Have some celery.
- I'm not...
- Eat, eat, eat.
We can eat outside. It's a beautiful night.
Take that meat there, will you?
Chop it up.
And hand me the ginger, the stuff that's chopped up there.
You wanna know something else?
This is really weird.
I went to see his sister Nora to talk to her about it.
But I couldn't. I stopped myself.
She changed, too?
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.
D'you wanna go see my friend David Kibner?
- The psychiatrist?
- Not like that.
Talk to him. He would put things into perspective.
- I'm not crazy.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.
He would eliminate whether Geoffrey was having an affair, or had become gay.
Whether he had a social disease, or had become a Republican.
All the things that could have happened to have made you feel he had changed.
D'you know what I mean?
You wanna go see him?
You think I'm nuts.
No, I don't.
Can you still do the thing with your eyes?
If you're not crazy, you can do that thing with your eyes.
You're not crazy.
This is delicious.
You're a great cook.
What time is Geoffrey getting back?
He said not to wait up for him.
D'you want some more wine?
- Morning!
- Hello.
One, two... Mrs Teng, this one's got a coffee stain on it.
Here.
- That's not coffee.
- That is coffee. I put it there myself.
Maybe not come out.
You doctor, right?
Me? No. Health Department. Civil servant.
Do you need a doctor?
My wife... sick.
- What's wrong with her?
- She wrong.
- She's not right?
- That not my wife.
You mean, she's...?
No, no. Different.
That not my wife!
How you doin', Harry?
Hey, pooch. How you doin', boy?
Where you been? You've been driving me crazy. I've been looking all over for you.
What's the matter with you?
You all right?
Talk to me, Elizabeth.
I keep seeing these people all recognising each other.
Something was passing between them all.
Some secret.
It's a conspiracy. I know it.
There can't be a conspiracy.
Matthew, I'm telling you, something's going on here.
Something that scares me.
I tried to see Geoffrey today, to talk to him.
He's always in his office in the morning.
It really was weird.
Geoffrey was meeting all sorts ofstrange people.
Things were being passed between them.
- None were people you knew?
- I didn't know any of them.
Maybe they were patients of Geoffrey's.
Oh, no, no, Matthew. I know they weren't.
I followed him from one end oftown to the other, and everywhere he went he had these meetings with strange people.
I felt so stupid sneaking around spying on him, but I can't talk to him. What can I do?
OK. Well, Kibner will be able to explain something.
I don't need a psychiatrist.
Just forget that he's a psychiatrist.
Just think of him as an intelligent man, which is what he is.
It's a book party. He's a celebrity.
He's very famous.
And you will like him, if you forget that he's a psychiatrist.
I don't know... I don't know.
Matthew, I've lived in this city all my life, but somehow today
I felt everything had changed.
People were different.
Notjust Geoffrey, but everybody.
Yesterday it all seemed normal.
Today everything seemed the same, but it wasn't.
It was a nightmare.
It really became frightening.
It was like the whole city had changed overnight.
Did I ever tell you the one about the English Camel Corps? Did l?
They're trapped in the desert, in the Sahara desert.
They've been surrounded by Rommel for 40 days and they've run out of food.
And the captain comes and makes an announcement to the men.
He says,
"Men, I have some good news and some bad news for you."
- One of the men says...
- Wait. You have told me this.
Can I tell it to you again?
Look out!
Oh, my God! Lock the door!
- They're coming!
- We should help.
Help! Help! They're coming.
They're coming. Listen!
- He's smashed out of his skull.
- He's terrified.
You're next. Please! Please!
You're next. We're in danger!
Listen to me... Something terrible!
Please. You're next!
Here they are. They're already here!
Help! You're next!
- They're coming. They're coming...
- He must have done something.
The policeman'll help.
Oh, my God.
That poor man.
What was he talking about?
I'll phone a witness report in from the bookstore.
Matthew, thank God you're here!
These people are driving me nuts.
- Are we gonna have dinner?
- No, I can't.
- Is there a phone?
- Around the corner.
- Elizabeth Driscoll, Jack Bellicec.
- This is the Elizabeth?
The book is awful. Kibner's book is awful.
His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage.
How can you say that about a man like Kibner?
Not a man like Kibner.
I'm saying it about Kibner.
He dashes a book off every six months.
Takes me six months to write one line.
- Why?
- Cos I pick each word individually.
- What's so hot about that?
- I wasn't even talking to you, was l?
On the corner of Leavenworth and...
- Turk.
- Turk? Turk.
Is that him?
Yes.
Yes!
"What's so hot about that?
What's so hot about that?" I don't know...
You must have a report on it cos there was a motorcycle officer there
- and an ambulance on the way.
- They follow me.
- They don't understand me.
- You don't have to prove yourself to them.
- That's easy for you to say.
- Of course I saw it.
- The man was running down the street.
- It's romantic, sentimental,
- He landed on my car.
- post-industrial nonsense.
Just a second. I'm talking to the police.
- No, he was bleeding on the road.
- What seems to be the trouble?
Hello? Yeah.
Don't ever give your name to cops.
Leavenworth and Turk. I'll hold.
But he isn't my husband!
It's someone who looks like him.
He's an impostor!
Now, Katherine, he's your husband.
You know him and I know him.
I had to wait until today cos he has a scar on the back of his neck and when his hair is long you can't see it.
- He went to have a haircut today...
- And the scar was gone.
No! It's still there!
Of course it's still there.
What did you expect? He's still Ted.
- Excuse me, can I say one thing?
- Please! He's still your husband Ted.
- I know something...
- Katherine?
- Could I say one thing?
- Katherine!
Just a minute.
- Katherine.
- Just give me a minute, will you?
Will you trust me?
Will you please trust me? Will you?
I work for the county.
This is a public-spirited gesture.
- I will give you my name...
- Kibner wants people to fit the world.
- I wanna report this.
- I want the world to fit people.
- We'll talk about this later.
- Where's Homer? Or Kazantzakis?
- Where's Jack London?
- Where's Elizabeth?
- I'm afraid!
- I understand, I know.
I understand. Let me have your hand.
- Katherine, just trust me.
- Isn't he wonderful?
Come on.
There. That's not so bad, is it?
Who's this behind me?
- It's Ted.
- That's right.
Hold on. Come on, just hold on.
Hold on. Just relax now.
- You gonna be all right? You feel better?
- Yeah. Yes.
- You wanna go home now?
- Yes.
- Will you come and see me tomorrow?
- Please... tomorrow.
Tomorrow we'll all talk.
OK? The three of us?
OK, but I better take her home.
Yes. It's OK.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.
- All right?
- OK.
Thank you.
They don't wanna hear about the accident.
It's a big conspiracy.
- What's a conspiracy?
- Everything.
Excuse me.
I understand what you're trying to say.
My name is Elizabeth Driscoll, the Public Health Department. Call me.
Katherine! Come on, Katherine.
That woman's husband is not her husband.
I saw him with Geoffrey. He's one of them.
She knows about it
- and nobody's helping her.
- No. Somebody's helping her.
I'm glad you heard that. David, Elizabeth.
I've heard it all week. It's popular.
- What is?
- I was trying to tell you
- that I also know somebody...
- Who's changed.
- Yes.
- Can we go outside and talk about it?
Listen, there's a lady up top - red hair, blue dress. She's interested in your work.
I've heard the same damn story this week from six patients.
People are changing, becoming less human.
It's happening all around us.
That's not what we're talking about.
This has nothing to do with the man I live with.
It has everything to do with it.
Don't you see?
People step in and out of relationships because they don't want responsibility.
That's why marriages are going to hell.
The family unit is shot to hell.
- David, you're not listening to her.
- Stay out of this!
You see, that's the point.
I'm listening, but he doesn't think I am. Why?
Because he doesn't expect me to bother enough, or to care.
- Bellicec, for the last time, stop!
- Stop what?!
- Stand still, be quiet, and shut up!
- Jack!
How did you feel about that?
Why in the store? He's a nut.
How did you feel?
You were probably shocked.
You wanted to shut your feelings off, maybe make believe it wasn't happening cos then you don't have to deal with it.
I wanna deal with that woman in the bookstore.
Why?
Do you identify with her?
Yes.
OK.
Come on.
Suppose I were to tell you that Katherine is trying to escape from a relationship.
- He's treating her.
- So why'd he push me against a wall?
- She's upset.
- She looks fine.
- She is upset, Jack.
- You look upset to me now.
Do me a favour, will ya?
Go home and I'll call you later.
- Go home and leave us alone for a bit.
- Go home?
- OK?
- OK. OK.
Thank you.
You're jumping to a bizarre conclusion.
That this man you live with has been replaced by somebody else.
Isn't it more likely you want to believe he's changed because you're really looking for an excuse to get out?
I don't know.
Will you think about it, please, before you make a move?
Before you jump and destroy something you have. Will you?
Please?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I just gave her a psychological Band-Aid, Matthew.
I should talk to her some more.
You could bring her by my office tomorrow around four.
What's the matter with her?
It's like there's some kind of hallucinatory flu going around.
People get over it in a day or two.
All I can do is treat the symptoms.
She's gonna be OK?
A good night's sleep wouldn't hurt.
- Is it contagious?
- Oh, Matthew!
- Take her home to her boyfriend.
- That wasn't what I was thinking.
I was just wondering if the Health Department should look at it.
Who knows? I don't know.
I wish I did.
OK.
Take her home, Matthew.
Ah, Jack. How was the book party?
Is that Kibner's new book?
Didn't get to read your poetry?
I'm sorry, Jack.
Good evening. Bellicec Baths.
Yes, we recommend the 1 5-minute soak in Calistoga volcanic ash, that's followed by an Aqua-Surge whirlpool dip.
Hey, can you help me outta here?
Bellicec!
I'm talking to you. Give me a hand.
Help me outta this thing.
Stan...
Every week we go through this.
- Why can't you be more cooperative?
- Get me a towel.
You are really gonna get hurt one of these days.
Give me another towel, would you?
Come on.
Nancy, shut the music off.
It's for the plants, Stan.
Screw the plants. I hate the music.
It's wonderful for my plants.
They just love it.
Plants have feelings, you know, just like people.
It's fascinating. This type of music stimulates the growth of the plants.
They've done tons of experiments on it.
- Come on, Nancy. Turn the music off.
- Relax.
You're not gonna enjoy this if you don't.
Oh! Mr Gianni, what are you doing here?
This is must reading, Mrs Bellicec.
Worlds ln Collision by Velikovsky.
Oh, yes. I've read that many times.
Have you read Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon?
That's must reading, too.
- Well, it's awfully late, Mr Gianni.
- You're so smart.
Oh, Mr Gianni, you've been sitting in that mud too long.
It is possible to overdo it, you know.
Oh, by the way, thank you for that plant you gave me last time.
I'll walk you inside.
You don't have to.
Geoffrey?
That was sweet of him.
You all right?
I'll see you tomorrow morning.
Thank you, Matthew.
You've really made me feel better.
And I'm gonna think about what Kibner said.
OK.
Thanks for helping. Goodnight.
See you.
Jack?
Honey, where are ya?
I don't wanna disturb you if you're thinking, but I could do with some food.
I haven't eaten all day. Oh...
Oh, Jack, you're gonna suffocate.
My nose...
Let me out! Let me out!
My nose is bleeding.
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's Matthew.
- Come on in.
- What happened?
Back here.
- Matthew, I called you here as a friend.
- Oh, Jack...
Do you report things like contagious disease or a body in a place of business?
- Let him look at it.
- You found a body?
- No, not necessarily.
- I thought it was Jack.
Is that him?
Yeah, under there.
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's no joke.
What is it?
- What the hell is it?!
- Just keep calm, Nancy.
Is it contagious?
- Did any of your customers see this?
- No.
It'd ruin us.
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't do that.
- Why?
- Nancy, don't.
Because I think Jack is right.
It's not immature exactly.
He's got an adult face.
- It's a monster. It's got hair all over it.
- It's vague.
Nose, lips, hair.
Hands, everything, but no detail, no character. It's unformed.
Jack, don't touch it.
You don't know where it's been.
No respiration.
It's got no fingerprints.
No fingerprints?
Like a foetus.
You just said it was an adult.
I said it was an adult because it was tall.
- How tall are you, Jack?
- Six foot four.
- How much do you weigh?
- Why?
- Oh, no.
No, Matthew.
Oh, Jack!
- Who are you calling?
- Elizabeth.
Why?
Why are you calling Elizabeth?
- Matthew...
- Why?
Hello?
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?
It's Matthew, Elizabeth. Hello?
What's the matter?
Elizabeth, can you hear me?
Who is this?
Hello?
- Where are you going?
- A friend of mine is in trouble.
- What are we to do?
- Phone David Kibner.
Ask him to meet me here right away.
There's his number.
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired.
Stand up.
- Stand up! Now walk around!
- Honey, I'm dry! I'm very dry.
I'll get you a drink. Just don't fall asleep.
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks, sweetie.
Dr Kibner will be here soon.
I'm gonna lie down and think, honey.
I'm just gonna think.
Jack, wake up! lts eyes!
Oh, Jack. It opened its eyes.
See?
Hon?
Wake up.
Wake up!
I can't find anything in here that looks like a body.
- No body?
- What!
- Did you check the last...
- I looked everywhere.
Hey! Did you... Hey!
- Did you check the last booth on the left?
- There's no body there.
It's got to be in here!
- Did it have a pulse, a heartbeat?
- It opened its eyes.
- You actually saw that?
- I saw its nose bleed.
It had white hair, that touched my hand.
There's something in here.
Nancy lost an old guy in here once.
He had a heart attack and sank.
Face it, Bellicec.
You've got some friends who enjoy practical jokes.
I don't have any friends, Dr Kibner.
Then some enemies.
Look.
Who opened this up?
Wait a second, wait a second.
Who is it?
- Matthew, the body's gone.
- Somebody's took it.
- No. Did you see it?
- There was nothing here to see.
Who are you waking up now, Matthew?
Police? I would like to report a body.
Take her to my place fast.
Don't let anybody in until we get back there.
Lieutenant, these fellas reported the body.
- You both saw it?
- No, I'm the only one. Matthew Bennell.
- Mr Bennell, show me where you saw it.
- It's right up here.
Where's Elizabeth?
- Where?
- There.
- It's Elizabeth's double.
- Where?
Lots of leaves and a pot.
It was there, David.
I swear to God it was there!
Officer, there was a duplicate of Elizabeth Driscoll,
- and it's been taken.
- The missing woman?
- She's not missing.
- Where is she?
- She's at Matthew's.
- Don't tell him that!
- Then there is no missing body.
- That's right.
- There is and he's taken it!
- No, he took Elizabeth.
- You took Elizabeth away?
- Yes!
- You broke in here.
- I had to because she was not safe here.
So you took her out of here.
No! I took her from there.
Her other body was in here...
Please stop.
Matthew, that's enough! Please stop!
- Lieutenant, I'm Dr David Kibner.
- Ah, the psychiatrist.
My wife reads your books.
- I'm glad. It sounds complicated,...
- David...
..but my friend has had some difficult emotional experiences recently.
But I think this is something we can work out amongst ourselves.
- All right, I'll leave this part of it with you.
- I appreciate it.
You can't accomplish anything here.
We gotta get outside.
I think you might wanna consider filing an unlawful entry against Mr Bennell.
I know what you're saying, but outside...
No, I'll take Dr Kibner's word that Elizabeth is all right.
- Fine, then let's go.
- OK.
Will Elizabeth be coming home?
No.
I have to pick up some of her clothes.
All right.
All right, let's back up and go through it once more, step by step.
You all thought you saw a body at the baths.
You thought it was dead.
You didn't know what it was.
You touched it. All of you touched it.
- Nancy, you saw it open its eyes.
- It looked right at me.
- And, Bellicec, you saw its eyes open.
- No, I saw its nose bleed.
If you saw its nose bleed, and Nancy saw its eyes open, he must have been alive.
No, David. You're looking at it as if it was human. It was not human.
- Matthew, what else would it be?
- It was something, but not human.
- It had white hair on it.
- It was growing.
The one at Jack's was...
It was like Jack, but not as developed as the one at Elizabeth's place.
It had tendrils on it.
The one at her place was duplicating her.
If Matthew hadn't taken me away, the same thing that's happened to Geoffrey would have happened to me.
Elizabeth, would you please tell me, in your opinion, exactly what is happening?
People are being duplicated.
And once it's happened to you, you're part of this thing.
It almost happened to me!
Look, the reason you don't believe Elizabeth is because the other body disappeared.
It disappeared because Geoffrey took it.
Well, then what happened to my other body, then?
Oh, people, will you please listen to yourselves?
Will you listen to what you are saying?
I can deal with a body being moved and even with a body getting up and leaving, but when you start talking about his other body, being duplicated...
Listen to how that sounds.
We know how insane this sounds!
But what do you think we're doing?
Do you think we're making it up?
Do you believe that my body looked like me and that her body looked like her?
D'you think we're crazy?
You are trying to make us believe that we are seeing things. Why?
All I'm trying to do is help.
You call me in the middle of the night and ask me to help. That's all I'm trying to do.
Well, I'm sorry if we woke you up!
If we inconvenienced you,
I guess we owe you an apology.
I mean, I mean...
I guess that's a rotten thing to do!
You've upset my wife, too.
David, I don't know what it is or where it comes from, but I saw it and I'm gonna fight it.
Matthew, my friend,... I believe you.
I've known you too long not to believe you.
What do you wanna do?
Well, if I could get official support,
I'd institute the emergency procedures that we use for cholera or legionnaires' disease.
- What do you want me to do?
- I can handle the Health Department.
But if panic breaks out, we'll need the police and the Guard, and that means the Mayor and...
The Mayor's a patient of yours, isn't he?
How did you know that?
What do you want me to do?
Would you ask him to accept my telephone call?
I'll call him in a hour. I'll be at my office.
If you have any other ideas, get in touch.
Call me.
Thank you.
The sooner the better.
This smells lovely.
- I want you to listen to me.
- I am listening to you, Nancy.
I am not seeing things.
I know I saw what I saw and I know it was turning into you, Jack.
Now, that body we found...
That flower. Where did you get that?
- In the vase with the others.
- Just stuck in there?
- Yeah. Why?
- Geoffrey gave me one last night.
So what?
A customer, Mr Gianni, brought one of those to the baths.
So what?
- Put it down, Jack.
- It's a pod with a flower on it.
- I could not find that flower in any book.
- Jack, put it down.
- It's a pink flower, honey.
- It could be toxic.
I have seen these flowers all over.
They grow like parasites on other plants.
- Where are they coming from?
- Outer space.
- They're not from outer space.
- Why not?
- They're not.
- Why?!
What are you talking about?
A space flower?
Why not a space flower?
Why do we always expect metal ships?
I've never expected metal ships.
There must be other ways they get in our systems.
Right. They could be getting into us through touch or fragrance.
We would never even notice it, not from the impurities we have.
I mean, we eat junk and we breathe junk.
I don't know where they're coming from, but I feel as though I've been poisoned.
We've gotta take those flowers in and have them analysed.
- There's something here.
- They could get into us and screw up our genes like DNA, recombine us, change us.
Oh, of course!
This is the same way those rockets landed years ago, so those spacemen could mate with monkeys and create the human race.
It's happening now!
- Who do you wish to speak to?
- David Kibner.
He's not in right now.
He'll be back this afternoon.
Could you leave a message for him?
Matthew Bennell. B-E-N-N-E-L-L.
- And your number, please?
- No, he's got my number. Thank you.
James Grala, Deputy City Attorney.
Can I help you?
My name is Matthew Bennell.
B-E-N-N-E-L-L.
I'm a deputy public health inspector.
- Is this another call about impostors?
- Yes.
- We're the first agency you called?
- Yes.
Good. Listen, Mr Bennell, we don't wanna create a panic.
No-one here knows.
I'd like you to stay by yourphone for a while.
I'll have somebody call you back and take down all you know.
All right, thank you.
This is a busy lab, Elizabeth.
We don't test flowers.
- They go to the Depart of Agriculture.
- I know where they go!
I think this is our problem.
I think it is affecting people.
How?
Look, Allen, I have already said that I'll do all the testing.
You don't have to lift a finger. Can l?
You've been consistently late, Elizabeth, and you're behind in your work, so I'll do the tests for you.
Thank you.
- It'll take 48 hours.
- Allen, 24.
I can't understand why you've become so emotional about a little flower.
Hello.
- Mr Bennell?
- Yes.
- From the Health Department?
- Yes.
- It's Ted Jessop, the Mayor's assistant.
- Yes.
- You've come across something strange?
- Yes.
I'd like to suggest we meet in Union Square.
- We can't talk over the phone.
- Right away.
So you'll meet me here again tomorrow,
Mr Bennell?
Yeah.
Don't say a word to anyone. Keep it quiet.
Whatever you say.
- Please deposit 15 cents.
- Operator, I put in a quarter...
This is Judy Hinkell, the Mayor's special assistant.
Yes. My name is Matthew Bennell.
The Mayor's in conference, but Dr Kibner called him personally to express his concern.
And, Mr Bennell, we're asking for your discretion because this thing might be abating.
Hello?
- Matthew Bennell?
- Yes.
I'm Michaels, from the Federal Preparedness Agency.
These reports ofstrange, unexplained, diseased bodies.
My understanding is you haven't analysed anything
- and you have no tissue samples.
- No, I'm...
Mr Bennell, it seems you'rejust winging your conclusions. Keep an open mind.
I had no intention...
Don't mention to anyone about duplicate bodies.
- I was gonna treat it...
- Excuse me, my otherphone is ringing.
- Yes?
- This is serious business, Mr Bennell.
- Is thisjust a case ofparanoia?
- No, no, no.
Know what mass hysteria looks like,
Mr Bennell?
- We don't want to create a panic.
- We have a primary authority.
Be cautious.
You sound distressed.
- I think the horizon looks bright.
- People are returning to normal.
No, no. She all right.
She better now. Much better now.
- Did your husband ask you to come?
- No, no.
I want everybody to see that I'm back to myself again.
No, wait. Please.
I'll see you soon, I hope.
Matthew, I'm not getting a thing here.
Where is the...
I'm not getting any news here.
Isn't there a 24-hour news?
I would think you'd have a good reception on the hill.
There's a repair truck out here.
Could that be to do with it?
She just needs something to help her sleep. Tomorrow she'll be good as new.
I would suggest you get some sleep, too.
You've done everything you possibly can.
Can I give the Bellicecs a ride?
No, I'm not going back there.
- We'll just get a motel.
- You can stay here.
Thank you.
Come on.
I appreciate everything you've done,
David. Thank you.
- Get some sleep.
- Sure. See you.
Matthew. Matthew.
Matthew, they're growing.
They're everywhere!
Wake the others!
Elizabeth, wake up!
They're growing out of these pods.
- I'll get the police.
- Elizabeth, wake up.
They get you when you sleep. Sit up!
Elizabeth! Elizabeth, would you wake up?
Hello. Police.
Officer, I would like to report four bodies in my backyard.
You OK?
- Wait there, Mr Bennell.
- How do you know my name?
Hang up, Matthew.
- I didn't tell you my name!
- Hang up.
- I didn't tell them my name!
- They're all a part of it.
They're all pods, all of them.
- Who are you calling?
- Washington.
The CIA? The FBl? They're pods already.
I've got a friend in the Justice Department.
I can dial direct.
- What are you gonna tell him?
- Oh, my God!
They grow out of those pods!
They cut our power.
Matthew, they're barricading the street.
No!
- What number are you calling from?
- Operator? I was dialling direct.
I'll try the number, Mr Bennell.
- They're coming up here.

What's going on?
Oh, nothing.
Both of 'em.
- Harry, pooch, wake up!
- Look, there's a pod.
All those with families in Berkeley, Oakland and Elizabeth.
Unit Seven, special assistance.
Could we have you over by the Health Department?
Red city, please.
All with red city families.
Look at them!
Right out in the open.
That's how they do it.
That's how they spread it.
All those people are changed.
Unit Seven, special assistance.
Could we have you over by the Health Department immediately?
Matthew, we'll never be able to stop them!
Yes, we will.
We can't!
Look it, they control the whole city.
We'll find a way somehow.
Oh, Matthew, I can't go on!
I wanna go to sleep.
I can't stay awake any more.
You have to.
You have to stay awake.
Would somebody in transportation report to the Grove Street terminal?
Yup. Boccardo's pills.
He eats these like candy... or he used to.
Take some.
- What are they?
- Speed. It'll keep us awake.
- How many are you supposed to take?
- It says "Take one".
Take five.
They know we're here.
Jack, my God!
No.
Would have been a lot easier if we'd just gone to sleep last night.
David, no!
- Oh, my God! No! No! Matthew!
- Don't touch her!
David, don't let them touch her!
Don't let them touch her!
Don't let them touch her.
- What are you gonna do?
- We'll leave the city!
- Please, Geoffrey.
- David, let us go.
- Let us leave the city!
- You don't have to leave the city.
Nothing changes.
You can have the same life.
But what happens to us?
You'll be born again into an untroubled world, free of anxiety, fear,...
- Wait.
- ..hate.
- David, you're killing us.
- That's not true. David's right.
Your minds and memories'll be totally absorbed. Everything remains intact.
You've never agreed with him in your life before! What are you talking about?
What are you...
David, you're killing me.
- What is this supposed to do?
- Just a mild sedative to help you sleep.
- I hate you.
- We don't hate you.
There's no need for hate now... or love.
I love you, Matthew.
There are people who will fight you.
They'll stop you.
In an hour... you won't want them to.
Don't be trapped by old concepts.
You're evolving into a new life form.
Come and watch.
We came here from a dying world.
We drift through the universe from planet to planet, pushed on by the solar winds.
We adapt... and we survive.
- The function of life is survival.
- Elizabeth!
Open the freezer, quick.
- This door?
- Yup.
Shut the door.
How are we gonna get outta here?
Through the door. Come on.
What's that?
I've lost Jack.
We got separated.
I don't know where he is. I've looked everywhere. Have you seen him?
Nancy, this building is surrounded.
How did you get in?
I've been wandering among 'em for hours.
They can be fooled.
How?
Don't show any emotions.
Hide your feelings.
- And when you sleep?
- We'll watch over each other.
- OK.
- Let's find Jack.
We're going to beat them. OK?
OK.
Hey! The lines are over there.

He must be here somewhere.
Let's go this way.

Oh, no!
I had to help wash him so I saw him naked. 
I never realised he was so small, so short
Yes, Inspector...
Judge Varga used to come here every Sunday.
He liked talking to the mummies.
He'd make the dead reveal the secrets of the living.
-He'd talk to the mummies?
-Of course.
You're from Rome. There are some things you can't understand.
Open it.
See him?
Bernardo da Corleone a great 17th century lawyer.
In those days the dead person's family would come and tell the deceased their secrets.
And our Don Bernardo, who at the time was still alive, would come down to the crypt at night and get the corpses to tell him everything.
So he knew everthing about everybody.
Everything about everybody.
"Let me talk about little white jasmines..."
This fatal,just-picked blossom symbolises the purity of his existence.
And its scent evokes the goodness he brought to the courts and to his family.
It was this Spring blossom which caught the last breath of Judge Varga, who will now appear before the ultimate Judge and be admitted to His Kingdom.
For thirty years he fought against crime and the Mafia, and the Mafia has killed him.
He was the Mafia!
He was the Mafia!
Organised crime has never been so daring before.
It's the first time a judge has been murdered.
Mafia! You're the Mafia!
You're the Mafia!
It's an appalling crime aimed against the whole judiciary... and it's a challenge to the State's authority!
Why is your name linked to the dead judge and garbage? 
They attack me because I was his best friend.
What about the garbage?
Come and have a look.
Hear that?
They're not striking for more pay.
They even have cars to come to work.
They're starting a cholera epidemic just to screw me.
Where does Judge Varga come into it?
Varga was murdered because he was about to arrest them.
Not these wretches, but their puppeteers.
Give me a hand.
This guy's dead.
He has no pulse.
Judge Varga knew every secret behind every door.
He had drawers full of court files.
He acted on some, but ignored the others.
You were his friend.
You admired him, didn't you?
I liked the man.
He wasn't in it for money.
He thrived on power.
Inspector.
A  phone call from Rome.
Sorry. I need your authorisation to move elsewhere right away.
Where?
They killed another judge some 100km from here
The two crimes may be linked.
Go, but keep me informed.
The Minister is concerned.
Shall we arrest him?
Why?
As usual, they won't talk.
This guy heard nothing, saw nothing, knows nothing.
Do you get many lemons?
Alot. They want to cut it down to build houses
Tell me something ...
Did you know the judge?
Of course. He issued the orders to resume the farms. 
What was he like?
Like this town...
Just what they wanted.
Sargeant.
Captain.
Is this you?
It might be.
Did you bring us all this way just to identify a photo?
Why were you at Judge 
Varga's funeral?
Were you a friend too?
We had ceased to be on friendly terms.
But when he was a junior judge...
When you killed that unionist...
Everyone was acquitted.
Sure. But this time you've gone too far.
You shouln't mess with judges.
Inspector, you're wasting your time with us. And you know it.
If it's payback as you call it, that's between the judges.
Brave Chief Judge Calamo is dead.
He's the third judge to be killed.
The police do nothing to stop this mad slaughter.
And their inertia gives rise to all sorts of speculation.
We're being killed off and our reputations are tarnished.
The judiciary is sound but parliament is ineffective.
The government is weak.
They're the reason the country is plunging into chaos.
Find me that raving maniac.
Only a maniac would go around killing judges.
Get this into your heads.
As chief of police, your head will be the first to roll.
You're our best man , but yours will be the first head to roll.
Stop the damaging stories about the murdered judges.
What's this?
The late Chief Judge Calamo had them in a drawer.
He had several million in the bank.
What on earth are you doing?
Piecing together three lives.
Don't waste time with the dead.
We need somone who's alive and guilty.
Stop looking for rationality.
We're dealing with a paranoid.
If he's paranoid, it's with good reason.
What did you mean by
"paranoid with good reason"?
Three judges have been killed in twenty days, in three towns quite near each other.
All killed the same way, by bullets from the same gun,. which must be a rifle and silencer.
Enough evidence to suggest a vendetta.
A vendetta?
By whom?
A victim of a judicial error.
Do you know whether the three judges were ever on the same case?
Yes.They worked together for eight years
Doctor. The plane is ready to take off.
Let me say one more thing.
Actually I knew there'd be another killing in this town.
I have'nt made a mistake.
I was here when they shot Calamo.
Then the papers are right 
You're a jinx.
Anyway, I've come up with some facts.
Three people from this area were unjustly sent to jail for several years.
A chemist whose wife tricked the judges, a mechanic rumoured to be gay, and a trucker who's now a hobo.
So, what's your next step?
One of the trio is the killer.
- How are things?
- Bad.
- What's bad?
- Everything.
- And before?
- Before what ?
Were things better before?
- No.
- So ?
So... Here we are.
What do you think about these judges being killed?
Were you sentenced by Varga?
He was the prosecuting judge in that trial.
He asked for 30 years.
He said he regretted there was no death penalty.
Did Judge Sanza deliver the sentence?
Judge Sanza gave me a discount... 27 years.
But he wasn't alone.
I know.
Judge Rasto was there too.
And Rasto is still alive.
What do you want from me?
Later they proved
I was innocent.
True.
You were innocent and spent four years in jail.
I've served 52 years unjustly.
Spending four in jail was no big deal.
Jail is a safe place.
- Who's there? What do you want?
- Police.
Leave me alone.
You've made my life miserable.
Enough. Get out of here!
Come here.
Do you remember Judge Varga?
Chief Judge Sanza and the other one Calamo ?
Bastards...
They were all bastards.
And so you killed them.
- I wish I did.
Do you live here?
Have you a gun?
Go and get it.
You get it.  
Clear off!  
You don't answer me like that. Understand?
What shall we do?
No one's seen him.
He might be sleeping.
Stay here and keep an eye out for him.
Yes, doctor.
Is Dr Maxia here.
That's me.
Can I help you?
I'm inspector Rogas.
I'd like a word with you.
At your service.
I'll be back shortly.
Please sit down.
Thanks.
This is what I want to know.
I'm told you're the only friend of the chemist, Cres.
Friend!
It's hard to use the term in Cres' case.
Let's say a frequent caller.
- So you see him often?.
- Yes, yes.
Actually, I'm the one who keeps an eye on him.
I try to get him to mix. with other people.
Seen him today?
- No.
I don't think Cres went out at all today.
I knocked on his door but no one answered.
He ofter pretends he's not at home.
You mean it's happened to you too?
Yes, often.
Cres is always in the house?
Are you sure he couldn't have gone somewhere else.
As far as I know the only trips Cres takes are inside the walls of his own house.
- See?  He's not here.
- So he does go out?
Then, it's not true that he's not always here?
Strange.  Maybe he's left.
I'll go see if he switched the meter off.
What's all this music?
Cres is crazy about tangos.
He collected thousands of them, inspector.
Tangos of all kinds, from lots of places
He's put speakers all over the house.
This is the wife of Cres.
She used animal welfare to frame him.
Do you think 
Cres was innocent too?
He prepared the chocolate rice.
He cooked it quite ofter.
Yes, my husband !
Well then do any doubts still linger?
No.  Not unless we think this poor woman designed a diabolical scheme to incriminate her husband.
Even to the extent of sacrificing a life, of a poor innocent cat.
For years the only companion in her lonely existence.
That would be absurd!
He wanted to murder his wife.
He set up a fake suicide.
You must find him guilty.
The woman, where is she now ?
Your guess is as good as mine.
She took off while he was still in jail.
She stripped half the house, and left him with her portrait.
And he's placed it in front of his bed.
Doctor!
Is the headless figure Cres?
I think so.
Maybe his wife did it out of spite.
Who was next to you here?
Probably Cres.
Probably?
Don't you have any photographs of Cres?
I did have a few, but he took them all back.
Who is it?
I'm inspector Rogas.
Come in.
The judge is is waiting for you.
Come in.
The police inspector is here.
Your honour.
Good evening.
Inspector Rogas.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Certainly
Well?
Forgive me for calling on you at this hour.
But I've been trying in vain to see Mr Cres, the chemist.
But his house is locked.
And no one is answering.
What do you want with the chemist?
Nothing in particular.
I looked up his file..... a strange case indeed.
I need to put a face to it.
I want to meet the man.
But the Cres trial has no link with anything nowadays.
It was much talked about.
And the sentence was very controversial.
Weren't you one of the judges?
I was only the recorder.
The decision was made by 
Judge Varga and Chief Judge Sanza .
And they've both been killed.
Forty metres.
They fired from over there.
Who lives there?
It's a condemned building
A fire was lit in one of the rooms.
The killer must have spent the night there.
He must have known the judges' habit pretty well.
Aren't they removing the corpse?
Doctor, there's an ambulance strike.
We can't find a vehicle.
Use one of our cars.
Do you need the union's approval?
Were you really here when he was shot?
Not  exactly. 
I saw the judge last night... but I didn't kill him.
Why did you visit the judge?
Nothing important,
Just routine .
Surely you must have some clues...
It's the fourth since you began investigating.
Gentlemen, talk to the local police.
Inspector, our readers want to know...
Hey!
Ah. Look who's here!
One judge is a police matter, but kill four, it's political.
So you'll give me a political interpretation.
Don't you read the papers?
No, especially yours.
Good!
Let's get away from here.
Your colleagues won't give me peace !
Come on.  
Get into my car!
Too bad you don't read  our paper, it's the only one defending you.
Defending me.  How ?
We're not into witch hunts.
We are not about raising tension in the community.
We want to do out jobs.
Without any interference from above.
So that's what you write!
Well done. 
At times the police even suit the Communist Party!
If they all did their job like you do.
But I do it for you.
We were school mates and we went fishing together.
But trust your friends.
It's all politics.
It's your government cronies who play dirty politics.
Listen...
You can be frank with me
- What's behind all this?
- None of what you might think.
Nor of what my government gronies think.
I'll tell you a story, off the record.
A nice story.
It's about a man, his wife and a cat
This one?
No.
This one?
No, I'm afraid not.
This one?
I believe this one resembles him a little.
But it's only a drawing not a photograph!
Enough time's spent on this, we have to finish!
You!
Give me your description again.
Wanted.
A man, 175 cm tall, stocky with greying brown hair. perfect teeth, slightly aquiline nose.
... JUDGE ASSINATED ...
... JUDGE PERRO SHOT DEAD
AT 6.30PM IN ROME ...
These brutal and appalling crimes are an attack on law and order.
MESSAGE FROM THE HEAD OF STATE
They are the diabolical fruit of the actions... of groups of young agitators who preach violence as a means to an end, and sow seeds of delirium in weaker minds.
It is time to say
'Enough, we will be strong!'
You saw the assassin?
I heard a shot and saw two youths run away. That's all.
You were just passing by at that moment?
Yes but I heard nothing, though.
I was on my bicyle when two youths knocked me over.
Why were you at the scene of the crime ?
I was in the basement, 
I'm a printer.
I went upstairs to get a little fresh air.
I heard a woman shout and saw him on a bicycle.
At last! While you waste your time on your little toy. chasing your phantom lunatic, the true killer is exterminating judges, leaving the country in a state of panic.
Actually, it was you who mentioned lunatics. You came here to tell me.
But you were there and had to see what wasn't there.
Meaning?
Pleas sit down.
I was saying they were everywhere.
At Varga's funeral, where Sanza was killed...
They even set up camp.
A demonstation and a camp site don't prove murder.
What about the eyewitnesses?
There were eyewitnesses to Judge Perro's murder?
Nobody seen him shot, they saw someone run away.
Enough talk.
You're an excellent detective.
The best criminal investigator we've got.
But this now is a political affair.
We have already made too many mistakes.
It is imperative firstly to restore the good name of the police.
You will work with the political squad.. and collaborate with Inspector Bloma.
This way.
Get this to the Minister quickly
Yes Sir.
The telephone calls are continuously recorded?
But where're all the tapes stored?
Don't you worry!
After they're of value to the 
Justice Ministry they destroy them.
Rogas, come here a minute!
Isn't that your friend there?
The communist journalist?
- Is he being watched too?
- No, only his leader... Amar.
"Times are difficult."
"This meeting must end with a clear decision."
"A party like ours can't be surprised... and influenced by the actions of the government."
Let's see what are they sending us now.
Ah the Justice builings.
"Then, the chancillor, wrote:
The demand, response:"
"I have been coming to the capital all these months..."
"I brought cheques from the petroleum companies... to the secretariate of the Christian Democratic Party"
"who then distributes them according to the quota.. to all the other parties, except the Communist party"
"Nothing to the Communists ?
"To the Communists, no."
"To some affilliates of theirs but not much"
Senta! Put in the tape of the shooting of the Z Group.
Si, doctor.
We are monitoring this group's publications, in the last 6 months.
And we focus on articles.. that attack Magistrates and Judges.
Can I have the article from Permanent Revolution?
Thanks.
It's the newspaper of the Group Z.
This is Galano, head of Group Z.
The most fanatical.
Listen what he has writen about judges!
The article is tittled
"The Monsters"
"Bony and withered, often obese and flaccid...
"their faces marked by infamy of their office, every year dressed like clowns as bishops don't dare.
They're the high magistrates who inaugurate the judicial year telling us to lock more people up."
- Stand up!
- Me?
Yes you, stand up.
- Start walking.
- Where?
Walk up and down until we tell you to stop.
Turn round
Start walking
Start walking
Do you recognise him?
Is it him?
¡ Derecho ! Turn round
Start Walking
¡ Adelante !
¡ Muevete !
Do you recognise him?
Is it him?
Back to square one.
The two youths bumped into you and you fell off your bicycle.
I didn't say I fell.
I was knocked over.
Same thing.  You saw them run away.
The darker guy was limping.
I didn't see any dark guy.
It does'nt matter.
But he did have a limp.
Maybe.  It was so quick.
One moment.  How quick?
As a flash.
Then they got into the car.
A car?
You never mentioned a car.
You never gave me a chance.  You kept asking about those youths.
Bring the girl here.
Sit here.
- You saw the car, didn't you ?
- What car?
The car in the street when Judge Perro was shot.
Ah yes, the big foreign car.
How do you mean foreign?
Why didn't you tell us about the car?
So what if there was a car?
I see so many cars in a day.
They're part of my job.
- Was the car parked?
- Yes. It was.
I went up to it to see if
I could do some business...
That's why I noticed it was big, nice and foreign.
- Switzerland
- Then?
Nothing. They started the engine and took off.
- With the youths?
- What youths?
Those hippies.
They suddenly started running.
I saw them get into the car. 
What is he talking about ?
When the car took off, the hippies ran away on foot.
Okay, let's start from scratch.
This is your statement.
I'll read it to you.
'' At 6pm on the 25th, in front of the
Justice Building.
I was about to cross the street,... when I noticed my shoe strap was undone.
I bent down to do it up and heard a shot."
- Then?
- I turned around.
- What did you see?
- Two youths ran into this guy.
- And then?
- They ran off up the street
- And the car?
- Went in the opposite direction
Ha! He couldn't have seen anything... because he was leaning over the dead man.
I insist.
They got into the car.
You were shit scared.
You didn't see anything.
Listen Bloma,
I have thought it over carefully
I won't work with someone else.
Even the chief thought
I wasn't right for this.
Maybe you have a point.
A break will do you good.
Yes but first I have to ease my conscience.
I have to tell a guy he's about to die.
Good morning,inspector.
May I speak to 
Chief Judge Riches?
Who are you? 
I am inspector Rogas.
Wait here.
Inspector.
Come back tomorrow.
He can't see you now.
Okay.
That car it's the 
Police Commissioner's?
- Is he with the judge ?
-  And why are you asking? 
It's not for me.  But at least get in touch with the boy.
By the way the school fees are due.
Don't worry.  You know I've been away.  I'll do it tomorrow.
Marco says he never sees you.
- When did you see him?
- Last Sunday.
- Was he all right?
- Yes, he was fine.
Don't forget the college fees.
Yes yes, bye.
And now a news update
General De Sarmiento was today appointed
Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces
He was sworn in before the joint chiefs of the air force, the army and the navy.
The ceremony was followed by a military parade which included a special police unit.
Various diplomats were in attendance...
General de Sarmiento was today appointed
Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
He was sworn in before the joint chiefs of the air force, the army and the navy.
- Is that Rogas? 
- Yes. Good evening doctor.
Why did you visit Riches?
To warn him he's in danger.
So you're still insisting in chasing your lunatic.
The judge will be killed in any case.
The chief judge is well protected.
I know. Today I saw all the security forces at Riches'.
I even spotted your car.
We were'nt with Riches.
We had a function next door at the Portuguse Embassy.
Okay, go and see Riches,.. but don't alarm him.
- Hello
- Hello. The Portuguese Embassy?
- Yes, who's speaking?
- I'm the police commissioner's chauffeur.
My boss forgot his briefcase at today's function.
What function was that ?
The ambassador is away in Lisbon.
Sorry.  It must be a mistake.
Thanks.
- Yes?
- It's Rogas.
- Hi.
- I need a favour.
Find the owner of a white mercedes with Swiss plates.
Any other details?
First two numbers are 9 and 7.
You find out the others.
Sit down.
So.  You think I'll be killed.
Yes.  I believe they'll try.
The subversives or that other guy?
The other guy... Cres.
Ah, That's right....
The chemist.
He tried to kill his wife,
His plan was too naive.
What did he get?
5 years, upheld by you on appeal.
Not by me.
I meant by the court over which you presided.
So!
- He was innocent.
- Really?
I think he was.
Was he innocent,.. or do you just think he was?
I do think he was innocent, but I can't be sure.
I see...
You can't be sure about it.
Yes, I have a doubt.
I think it was an error, a judicial error.
Judicial errors don't exist.
- You're a practising Catholic?
- Pracising, no.
A Catholic nevertheless.
Sure, like everyone else.
I presume you go to mass from time to time.
Ever considered the issue of bread and wine,.. turning into the body and blood of Christ?
Each time...
Each time the priest eats that bread,.. and drinks that wine, the mystery is fulfilled
That must always happen.
It can never be otherwise.
The priest may be unworthy in thought or deed, but simply due to the status he holds,.. each time the mass is celebrated the mystery is fulfilled.
When a judge delivers the law,.. he is exactly like a priest officiating at mass.
A judge may have doubts he may question himself, even torment himself,. but at the very moment he delivers judgement,.. he can't harbour doubts. At that moment justice is done.
Always?
One priest celebrating mass had blood on his hands.
Because he had doubts.
That has never happened to me.
No judgement has ever left blood on my hands.
No conviction has ever left blood on my gown.
It's obviously a question of faith.
I don't think you've quite understood.
I'm not a Catholic.
Nor am I a Christian.
However, I've never had any of these weaknesses.
I've never believed in Voltaire's
"Tratado sobre la tolerancia" on tolerance and judicial error.
Virtue, pity, innocent victims of judicial errors....
What errors?
A judge who can freely kill with his sentences...Ba!
Voltaire was the first to sow doubt about the judicial system.
When a religion allows for people's doubt,.. that religion is dead.
That's why we had Sartre, 
Bertrand Russell, Marcuse... and the delirium of today's youth.
You mean Voltaire is to blame?
Yes.  But Voltaire had an excuse.
In his day they didn't realise the danger of those ideas... but today's mass culture has made that danger mortal.
If things go on like this, the only viable form of justice will be a form of punishment known in war as decimation.
The way I punish is to kill one soldier in ten.
Today there are no more individuals!
Today, there is no more individual responsibility!
Your job, my dear friend has become ridiculous.
It was fine in peace time, but now we're at war.
Robberies, kidnappings, sabotage...  This is war!
And as in war the answer is decimation.
One, two, three, four, five...
Out!
One, two, three, four, five...
Cres, convicted!
Cres has a .22 calibre rifle,.. and it is loaded with a bullet for you.
Keep going.  Back all the way.
Park down there.
Go on! Go on! Stop!
Who lives below Judge Riches?
- Mr Pattos..
- The shipping tycoon?
Yes.
Inspector.
Mr Pattos.
What are you doing here?
- Sorry, I didn't think...
- What did you not think?
That you'd meet me in my friend Pattos' place?
I didn't think I'd be intruding in a reunion of frieds.
Too late now.  So?
- I was looking for someone.
- Looking for me?
No, someone who just come in.
One of my guests?
Please come in.
Come with me.
The inspector was surely looking for me.
Are you here to arrest me?
My dear Evaristo, you are a big liar..
You always denied the police tapped our phones.
The inspector's presence here proves my case.
- Is this right?
- Not that I know of.
How amazing!
Did he expect to get any other answer?
I know nothing about phone tapping.
It is done sometimes,.. but always with prior judicial approval,.. and only criminal suspects are tapped.
It is never done for political reasons.  Never..
That means I'm a criminal suspect,.. because my phone is definately tapped.
In fact, it's not even my phone.
The phone belongs to my host, Norcio,
There,here's the great progressive writer.
No, No.  You're not my guest you're the guest of my wife.
I'd never take an arsehole like you into my house... a provincial intellectual like you!
They brag on about permanent revolution...
You wish the inspector had come here to arrest you.
Then you'd be a hero.
- Wilfredo, Don't be ridiculous!
- Shut your mouth!
What a reactionary remark
'Shut your mouth'.
Just because I'm your wife, because you're my husband!
No. Because you're a parrot, not a woman!
There's nothing can be done.  You're a typical communist, catholic, bourgeois.
Yes, for a long time, not to keep up with the latest fashion!
Now that we are winning, communists, catholics, the bourgeoisie,.. you're all queueing up to jump on the bandwagon! 
No my dear, I don't like it!
Including you and that arsehole who wanted revolution!
Hello,hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Mo more of these family quarrels.
We're here to enjoy ourselves.. to eat.
Champagne?
- a whisky ?
- No, thanks.
Have a drink, Rogas.
You're not on duty.
Your assignment here is over.
Come with me..
To them it's a game.
- A game?  I wouldn't say so..
- Yes, yes a game.
Including me, 
I'm playing the game too..
I'm like a umpire... delivering both protection and threats..
Don't let appearances fool you, Rogas.
Despite the confidence, they're still scared.
More scared than they've ever been.
When the party's over they'll flee in all directions.
No one will sleep in their beds tonight.
Who do they fear?
They think you coming here was part of a plot... and your sudden appearance was planned.
My dear Rogas, subversive groups like Calano's are useful to us.
And to our Communist Party friends.
Friends?
Your know what the situation is like.
My party, which has run the country for 30 years,.. will be forced to rule with the Communists.
Your own job would be easier,
Rogas if Mr Amar, that party's leader, was in my chair.
This ministry would work.
It'd be fun to see Mr Amar and his party grappling with these groups.
Yes, well. And what should we do?
Continue harassing these groups as much as you can.
Arests, controls, searches... but always with the approval of the judges.
Before they're all killed!
If you're here to arrest Galano?
At least give us back our minister!
Hang around, Rogas. We will continue our conversation.
Hot coffee and cold milk.
Waiter, a whisky.
Find out who they are and what they want from me.
How can I? 
We're always being watched.
If they find out, 
I'm finished.
I didn't tell you to do it inside.
Why not use your own lab?
You did it with the oil bosses.
Give me a cigarette.
Come on, give me one.
Thanks.
Placing a bug under the commissioner's arse.
I'm fucked!
And now, Minister, allow me to address a burning issue.
Ever since I left the house of the president of the Supreme Court,..
I have the feeling that I'm being followed by professionals.
By people specifically suited to that task.
As if trained in a state or private police corps.
If people in high places, deem it necessary,.. to give me protection,...
I can only be grateful, ... but I should point out that such surveillance,... which is very expensive with so many officers involved,... would be better directed at protecting the judges.
You'll never get out of here unless you confess first!
And that goes for everbody!
To the Security Minister
It's the tanks.
Their motors run all night.
The meeting's at the armoured division barracks.
Listen, this is him.
Take it easier with those judges...
Rewind, Rewind.
Play it again.
Those judges..
Take it easier with those judges...
Rogas is on our back.
He's smelt a rat.
Come on, once more.
Those judges
Take it easier, with those judges.
Rogas is on our back.
He's smelt a rat.
- Is that it?
- Isn't that enough?
- Is that you, Rogas?
- Yes, good evening, doctor.
Why did you visit Riches?
To warn him he's in danger.
So you're still insisting in chasing your lunatic.
The judge will be killed whether it's by my lunatic or your group.
The judge is well protected.
I know. Today I saw all the security forces at Riches'.
I even spotted your car.
It's a plot.
The chemist Cres killed his judges, and now they keep killing the others.
We come across so many plots, they prepare one a day.
We've managed to keep them in check so far.
But this time you've got to do something fast.
We must wait,..
We can't risk everything by behaving rashly..
You don't understand.
I'm not saying you pre-empt their counter-revolution,.. but just inform parliament or the press.
We can't alarm everyone.. because you have certain impressions.
What impressions?  I have proof.
They're all implicated.
If that's the case, it's no use discussing it any further.
You must see Amar.
Only the party secretary can decide.
Amar is like all the others.
In a room of the National Gallery... a groupe of visitors discovered two bodies.
The police have now identified the victims...
Mr Amar, the secretary of the Communist Party, and police inspector
Amerigo Rogas.
Both victims were probably shot with the same weapon, a gun which Inspector Rogas was still holding in his hand.
Here's the chief of police's interpretation
Inspector Rogas had just return from a very stressful mission... to find the judges killer,
When he returned to the capital he showed signs of mental imbalance.
As a result he was placed on leave.
He was seeing plots everywhere. and started looking for non-existent evidence.
Perhaps he thought even the secretary of the Communist Party... was part of some imaginary plot.
He killed him and then turned the gun on himself.
So it seems we've accepted their version.
Everything points to him being the killer.
I don't believe it, I knew Rogas well.
He was no lunatic. There was a plot.
They felt so confident, they went all the way.
And now they have invented the ultimate provocation.
A police inspector kills the party secretary.
Even if that's so, what do you want?
A civil war?
A confrontation?
No
But we won't be accomplices.
What accomplices?  What would we be if we took part in their game.
Incite the people in the square?
This is wh1at they want?
So people will never know the truth.
Truth is not always revolutionary.

The scene is Berlin, the evening of Saturday,
November 3, 1923.
A pack of cigarettes costs four billion marks, and most everyone has lost faith in both the future and the present.
Mr. Abel?
Your brother´s already at home.
This is for both of you.
Thank you, Frau Hemse.
Thank you.
You can sit down.
So, you don´t speak German at all?
Damned nuisance.
Fräulein Dorst has her Sunday ruined.
- What´s your name?
- Abel Rosenberg. l´m 35. l was born in Philadelphia.
My folk come from Riga in Latvia.
My brother Max and his wife Manuela, the three of us came to Berlin a month ago...
No, at the end of September.
Max hurt his wrist, so we couldn´t perform anymore.
We were circus artists.
We had a trapeze act.
The reason of your brother´s suicide?
Depression?
Unhappy love affair?
Alcoholism? Drugs?
Nervous breakdown?
- Fed up with life generally?
- l don´t know.
An unexplainable impulse, was that it?
Well, it happens.
Did you get in touch with his wife? l tried to last night and this morning, but l can´t find her.
You didn´t live together, all of you?
Max and Manuela got divorced two years ago.
After the circus let us go,
Manuela went to work in a cabaret. l will go see her there this afternoon.
They open at 3:00 on Sundays.
May l see your papers, please?
Yes.
You´re Jewish?
- Why?
- Nothing. l was just curious.
You may now go.
Thank you.
What are your plans?
How long will you stay in Berlin?
As you know, there is great unemployment.
We are not going to take care of you when your money runs out.
Yes, l know.
Good-bye, Mr. Rosenberg.
Good-bye, lnspector.
Good-bye, Fräulein Dorst.
Abel!
Are you going to have lunch?
So am l. lt´s on me. Come.
How are things, my dear Abel?
And how are Max and Manuela?
Do you think his wrist will be better soon?
We all miss you, you know.
The circus needs you.
You´re wondering what l´m doing in Berlin when the circus is in Amsterdam. l´m looking for new acts, my boy.
Come in, come in.
Nowadays l could get any damned star l want.
They all know l pay in dollars.
We´re playing to full houses all the time. l could have twice as big a tent, and it would still be full.
Look what l read in the paper this morning. l´ll try to translate it.
Listen to this.
´´Terrible times are at hand
´´when circumcised anti-Christian Asiatics on all sides
´´are lifting their gory hands to strangle us.
´´The massacre of Christians
´´by the Jew lsaskar Zederblum, alias Mr. Lenin,
´´was enough to make a Genghis Kahn blush.
´´A Jewish terrorist pack, trained to murder and assault,
´´is prowling through the country,
´´butchering honest citizens and farmers on portable gallows.
´´Will you wait until you see thousands of people
´´hanging from lampposts in your town?
´´Do you want to wait until a Bolshevik commission
´´starts its murderous work in your town, just as in Russia?
´´Do you want to stumble over the bodies of your women and children?
Existence today is nothing but dread.´´
Do you need money? l can lend you some.
Look.
Here are some billions.
Take them. l don´t need them.
Why don´t you say something, Abel? l don´t believe in all this political crap.
The Jews are as stupid as everybody. lf a Jew gets into trouble, it´s his own fault.
He gets into trouble because he acts stupid. l´m not gonna act stupid, so l´m not gonna get into trouble.
Now you know, Papa Hollinger.
Thanks for the soup... and the money. l have to meet Manuela at 4:00.
Take care.
Hello, Abel.
What´s wrong?
When l got home last night,
Max had blown his brains out. l knew he´d do that. l...tried to keep an eye on him... but l didn´t really think he would...
He had a...sort of joke these last few weeks.
Do you know what that was? l would ask him sometimes.
He just said the money was good, and he told me to mind my own business.
There´s a letter for you.
His handwriting is impossible to read. l can´t. Can you? l can´t make out...
Wait.
Something...
´´There´s... poisoning going on.´´
´´There´s poisoning going on´´? l didn´t see much of him these weeks.
You lived in the same room.
We had a fight...
...a fistfight...
...over a whore. l didn´t hit him hard. l was worried about his bad wrist.
Christ, finale! l´m not ready. Please help me.
- l didn´t know you performed.
- Neither did l.
One of the girls got influenza and l said,
´´Why can´t l take her number?´´
Take care of Max´s money.
There´s nowhere to hide it here. lt´s funny seeing everything from the side like this. l seem to recognize you.
Did we smoke our first cigarette together?
No?
But if l say Amalfi, a summer day 26 years ago...
Our parents had cottages next door to each other.
You had an older sister called... let me see...
Rebecca. Right?
Do you mind letting me by? l´m in a hurry.
Why, of course...Abel Rosenberg.
So...get off the chair and get your wet jacket off.
And l´ll make you some real tea, nice and hot.
That´ll do you good. lt´s only the man that changes the toilet cans.
He comes every
Monday morning around 4:00.
Oh, God.
We used to spend the summers in Amalfi.
And Mama had trouble with her lungs.
Max and l used to play with a boy named Hans Vergerus.
His folks came from Düsseldorf.
The father was some kind of big shot, a Supreme Court Justice or something.
Mama didn´t like Hans. l guess no one did.
But everyone thought he was some kind of genius.
Once...
...we caught a cat and tied it down.
Hans cut it open. lt was still alive.
He let me see how its heart beat.
Fast, fast... l ran across him again ten years ago in Heidelberg...
...when we were there with the circus.
Yes, l remember that. l saw him again today.
Hans?
Did you see him?
He was at the cabaret.
No.
Manuela? lt´s morning.
The advantage of knowing influential people is that you can have real coffee for breakfast.
The fire is going nicely, but it will take a while before it gets really hot.
Do you get firewood the same way? l do know a woodkeeper, as a matter of fact.
But l don´t know anyone who can get me butter, so you´ll have to eat marmalade. lt´s made of chemicals, the label says. l owe you a dollar. l have to keep track.
Never mind.
Well, you...
You should keep this money before l spend it all on booze.
- Do you drink so much?
- Whenever l have the money.
You´re not going back to the circus?
What good is it without Max?
Well, we´ll get a new partner, of course.
- You know that´s impossible.
- l know nothing of the kind.
We´ll make a new number together, just you and l.
Abel, we could make a magical act. l know a marvelous magician.
Markus, you know, he´s just retired.
We could take over his show. l don´t know.
Since this business with Max, l´m just...
Ever since l met Max, you´ve been my big brother.
We´re going to stick together now. l wake up from a nightmare and find that real life is worse than the dream.
Abel, everything is all right.
We have everything we need. l just can´t figure it out.
Last night they were beating a man.
The police just turned their backs.
Abel, listen to me now.
You´re awfully tired.
You´ve been drinking much too much lately. l´m going to look after you now. ln a few days everything will be much better. You´ll see.
We´ll talk things over.
But now l must hurry. l have to go to work.
Work?
Yeah, l have two jobs.
- This time of the morning?
- Yeah, this time of the morning.
- l can´t be late.
- What sort of job?
Well, l don´t know exactly. lt´s secret anyway.
- Secret?
- No, l was joking.
- lt´s an office. l stick stamps...
- What kind of office? lt´s import and export. l´m not really sure.
What´s the name of the company?
What the hell is the name of the company?
Ferkel. Ferkel und Sohn.
Where is this office? ln Bayerstrasse.
Stop nagging me.
You sound like a jealous husband. l´ll be home around 2:00 and we´ll have dinner together.
Try and get hold of some meat while we still have the money.
- Twenty-two bucks.
- We´re rich.
- Herr Rosenberg?
- Yes?
Would you mind coming in here for a moment?
My name is Frau Holle. l am Manuela´s landlady.
Manuela just had time to tell me about you on her way out.
You are welcome to stay here with me for a short time.
These sudden changes in weather make my back ache, so l must stay in bed all the day.
Still, it´s nice with a peep of sun in November, isn´t it, Herr Rosenberg?
Would you care for a glass of sherry? l am very attached to Manuela. lf you forgive my saying so, l am as fond of her as if she were my own daughter.
Prosit, Herr Rosenberg.
She is so kind and naive. lt´s as if all the terrible things going on around us didn´t concern her. l think your sister-in-law is heading for trouble, Herr Rosenberg.
The odd thing about Manuela is that she doesn´t defend herself.
Nothing must happen to her.
Take this new job now.
There´s something odd about it.
The Society for Church Democracy-- what is that, Herr Rosenberg? lt isn´t even in the phone book. l must go now, Frau Holle.
How much is the rent?
Should l pay in advance? lt doesn´t matter.
But if you have money, l don´t mind.
You have dollars, haven´t you?
Shall we say $3 a month?
Or is that too much?
No, of course not.
Have you been crying?
No. Why? lt just seemed so.
Forgive me, Herr Rosenberg.
Good-bye, Frau Holle.
Good-bye, Herr Rosenberg.
We have been waiting for you.
May l ask you where you´ve been all night? l couldn´t very well sleep in that room.
- Where have you been?
- With my sister-in-law.
She lives at 35 Bergmannstrasse, doesn´t she?
- Yes, l think so.
- Think?
- l think it´s number 35.
- Well, now you know.
- May l pack some things?
- Not yet, Rosenberg. l must ask you to come with us to the morgue to identify someone.
- l have to?
- l´m afraid l must insist.
Well, then, we´d better get going. l´d advise you to smoke down there. lt helps.
- Do you recognize that girl?
- Yes.
- Who is she?
- Greta Hofer.
- How do you happen to know her?
- She was engaged to my brother.
- When did you see her last?
- A week ago.
- Was your brother on good terms...
- Yes, l think so.
Fräulein Hofer´s been assaulted.
Cause of death...drowning.
Do you recognize this man?
No.
- Are you quite sure?
- No.
Think hard, Rosenberg. lt´s important.
- He´s like someone.
- Who?
He´s like my father.
- You can do better than that.
- That´s all.
He´s like my father.
My father died five years ago.
Someone stuck a very thin hypodermic needle into this man´s heart.
A liquid of some sort was injected into the left ventricle, a poison that must have caused him hideous pain before he died, which probably took several hours.
So you haven´t seen this man before?
Have you seen this woman before?
Yes.
Who is she? l don´t know.
- But l´ve seen her.
- Where? l think she delivered papers. l used to meet her at Frau Hemse´s boardinghouse.
Once, she helped me up the stairs when l was too drunk to make it on my own.
- Her name is Maria Stern.
- l didn´t know her name.
She hanged herself in the basement room where she lived with her husband and two children.
But she left a very strange letter.
Totally muddled.
She said she had been frightened to death and that the pain was unbearable. l don´t think l can take this.
Come along.
Come on!
Have you ever seen this boy?
No.
He worked at the cabaret.
You never saw him there?
No.
He used to stand near the entrance working the spotlight.
You must have seen him.
Yes, it´s possible.
We are not certain how he was killed.
He seems to have been run over by a truck, but something tells us he´d been assaulted or tortured first.
Why do you want me to see all this?
During the last month, seven mysterious deaths have occurred... in your vicinity, Herr Rosenberg.
You don´t suspect me? l think we need a cup of coffee.
This can´t be called coffee, but it´s something.
Not very chatty, are you, Rosenberg?
Can you account for the movements on the evening of Sunday, October 28th?
- You can´t?
- l was drunk.
Ask me about October 19th. l was drunk then, too. l´ve been drunk every night since l left the circus.
Something doesn´t add up.
No? lf you were so well known-- good income, good reputation-- why did you start drinking? l´m an alcoholic.
Famous trapeze artist... alcoholic?
Maybe l didn´t feel welcome in your beautiful city.
Why do l have to stay here?
You may be able to help me with seven unsolved deaths.
Tomorrow everything´s gonna disappear.
Why bother with a few murders? l´ll tell you, Rosenberg. l bother for my own sake. l know that the catastrophe could be here in a few hours.
They say the rate of exchange for the dollar is five billion marks.
The French have occupied the Ruhr.
We have just paid a billion in gold to the British.
On every damned job there are Bolshevik agitators. ln Munich, a Herr Hitler is preparing a putsch with thousands of starving soldiers and madmen in uniform.
We have a government that doesn´t know which way to turn.
Everyone´s afraid.
So am l. l can´t sleep for fear.
Nothing works properly except fear.
On Friday l wanted to go to Stettin to see my old mother.
She´ll be 80. But there was no timetable anymore.
There was a train that might go, but no timetable, Rosenberg. lmagine!
A Germany without timetables!
So what does lnspector Bauer do? lnspector Bauer does his job.
He tries to create a little patch of order and reason in the midst of chaos.
And he´s not alone, Rosenberg.
All over Germany, millions and millions of petty officials, just as terrified, are doing exactly the same.
You get drunk every day, huh?
That´s also respectable, Rosenberg.
But l´d be happier if you swung on your trapeze with your pals.
That way you´d fight your fear more effectively.
So now you know why l sit here investigating something l think is extremely odd, not to say horrible.
And now l must ask you to keep quiet for a few minutes while l write a few lines to lnspector Lohmann, who is working on another case that also seems insane.
Sit down, Herr Rosenberg.
What do you suspect me of?
- Aren´t l entitled to a lawyer?
- This is a chat, not interrogation.
You´re taking it out on me. l need a cigarette. l know why you´re doing this. lt´s because l´m a Jew. l am here because l speak English.
You are allowed to smoke.
You have ten minutes. l spoke with lnspector Bauer.
He was very kind and understanding.
He wants to help you.
He said you went crazy.
What´s wrong, Manuela? l´m just worried.
My savings are stolen. l suppose you don´t know where they´re gone. l didn´t know you had any savings.
They´re gone anyway.
Luckily l´m in charge of Max´s money.
That´s just it. lnspector Bauer told me they found Max´s money on you when they searched you.
He asked me if l knew where
Max had gotten hold of this money. l said it was our savings, as we were in Switzerland with the circus and several of the artists changed their money into dollars before they went on tour to Germany.
Who do you think stole your money?
What´d you say?
Yes?
You´re not listening.
You´re sick.
- What´s wrong?
- She´s sick. l´m all right. l haven´t eaten today. l´d like to point out that you have only a few minutes left.
- Manuela.
- Yes, Herr Rosenberg? l am going to let you go,
Herr Rosenberg. ln spite of the way you attacked me and my colleagues.
My God, the way you swung at us.
But then, you are a circus artist.
What are you looking at? l´m not looking, l´m wondering. l´m wondering whether l ought to tell you what l am wondering about.
But l think not.
Fräulein Dorst will show you where you can collect your belongings.
We´ll keep your brother´s dollar bills for the time being.
We´ll give you a receipt, of course.
- What are you doing here?
- l dropped in to see Manuela. l just heard about your brother´s death.
You can go to hell.
What?!
You got any cigarettes?
There are some cigarettes on the shelf.
Who is it?
- Come in a moment, Manuela.
- l´m awfully tired.
Could we talk tomorrow when l come home for dinner? l wish to speak to you now. l can´t sleep because of the pain.
Besides, l am worried.
Has it something to do with me?
You wouldn´t have asked that before, Manuela. l´m dead tired. l think l have a cold. l want to go to bed. lt´s about Herr Rosenberg. l won´t have him staying here in my house.
- But why?
- He seems unreliable and arrogant!
Besides, the authorities don´t approve of my letting unmarried couples share a room. l have changed my mind!
Herr Rosenberg must move tomorrow!
But he´s paid his rent.
There´s the money. l have changed it into marks. lt´s illegal to have dollars.
You ought to know that. lf Herr Rosenberg is leaving, l´m leaving as well.
You must do as you like. l think you´re rotten! l think you are a witch!
We´ll get by. You´ll see.
As long as we stick together.
Have you slept with Hans Vergerus?
Yes, l have.
- Often?
- Don´t be silly, Abel. l want to know.
Three times, maybe four. l don´t know.
- Does he pay you?
- No.
Yes...once.
- Why did he pay you only once?
- l don´t know.
- Why don´t you know?
- l felt sorry for him.
Are you in love with him?
- l don´t know.
- You don´t know? l feel sorry for him...maybe me.
Maybe he needs some kindness.
Where did you go today? l went to the office.
Then l came home to have dinner with you. ls it import and export or something to do with the church or neither? What? l work at a whorehouse in the morning. lt´s not forbidden as far as l know. lt´s a very respectable whorehouse-- only for diplomats and managing editors and famous actors. lt´s so classy.
Be nice to me, Abel.
Please be nice to me, Abel.
Please be nice to me.
Tuesday, November 6th.
The newspapers are black with fear, threats, and rumors.
The government seems powerless.
A bloody confrontation between the extremist parties appears unavoidable.
Despite all this, people go to work, the rain never stops, and fear rises like vapor from the cobblestones. lt can be sensed like a pungent smell.
Everyone bears it like a nerve poison, a slowly working poison, felt only as a quicker or slower pulse, or as a spasm of nausea.
Abel, l´m too late. l overslept. l´ll be home at 2:00 for dinner. l don´t know why l´m bothering you.
My name is Manuela.
My father was a magician.
My mother was a circus rider. l´ve been living in circuses all my life.
My husband was a circus artist as well.
Maybe it´s wrong of me to trouble you, but l need to talk to somebody who understands.
This last week l´ve been going to morning masses. l´m confused.
And then someone told me that you were an American. lt´s very comforting.
My German isn´t very good.
My dear woman, would you come to the point? l have to get to another service. l see.
Well, maybe you´ll come again.
All this guilt is too much for me. l feel it´s my fault that Max committed suicide.
You´re responsible for someone, and then you fail your duties and you stand there empty-handed and ashamed, wondering what you could have been doing.
Now l feel l have to take care of Max´s brother Abel as well,
- and that´s even worse.
- Worse?
Well, he´s just like Max.
He never says what he´s thinking.
He just charges ahead with all his feeling and he looks so frightened.
And l try to tell him that we´ll help each other, but that´s only words for him.
And everything l say is useless.
The only real thing is fear.
And l´m sick. l don´t know what´s wrong. ls there any forgiveness?
Would you like me to pray for you?
- Do you think that would help?
- l don´t know.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
- ls it a special prayer?
- Yes, yes. Let me think.
We...We live so far away from God...
...that he probably doesn´t hear us when we pray for help.
So... we must help each other, give each other the forgiveness that a remote God denies us. l...say to you...
...that you are forgiven for your husband´s death.
You´re no longer to blame.
And l beg your forgiveness...
...for my apathy...
...and my indifference.
Do you forgive me?
Yes, l forgive you.
That´s all we can do. l must hurry.
The parish priest becomes annoyed if l´m late.
Young woman, l have to close up, please.
What the hell does this mean? lt´s a place where we´re going to live. lt´s nice, isn´t it?
Yesterday when you came to the cabaret, l´d just been telling Hans Vergerus about all our trouble.
He suggested at once that we could move into this flat that St. Anna´s Clinic has the use of. lt just became vacant.
Please say it´s nice.
We don´t have to pay any rent for the time being.
He also said that you could work in the clinic´s archives.
We could stay here and decide what we wanted to do. l´ll be damned if l´ll live here or accept charity from that goddamned Hans Vergerus.
Maybe it´s better if we work things out alone. l probably won´t see you for a while. lt´s best not to mix things up.
There is no point in continuing here in Berlin.
Look around you, Mr. Rosenberg.
Sixteen people, and what a program.
May l offer you anything to drink? A cognac?
A cognac for Mr. Rosenberg.
What do you think, Mr. Rosenberg?
A cabaret and a brothel... ln Beirut, for example.
A totally different climate.
A totally different ambience.
We´ll close earlier tonight and shorten the program. lt´s useless staying open. l´ve never seen anything like this rain.
Maybe it´s the flood.
Cheers, Mr. Rosenberg.
How do you like my English accent?
Marvelous. l lived for some years with a woman fakir from New Jersey.
She taught me all the English l know. l´ve been expecting this.
Can´t you sleep? l have to be drunk to go to sleep. l´ve half a bottle of gin in the small suitcase out in the kitchen.
You know, actually it´s quite nice to have a fever.
You can daydream.
You fall asleep and then you wake up.
Everything´s mixed up.
Suddenly you´re 6 years old, and then l´m 15. lt´s all so clear.
That damn engine. lt´s started up again.
- What engine?
- Don´t you hear it? l can hear something rumbling.
Yes! lt´s an engine.
That bathrobe you´re wearing belonged to Papa. lt´s quite touching. l can remember sitting in the sunshine watching Papa practicing a new number. lt didn´t work very good.
Mama came out of the wagon and said,
´´You´re not doing it right.´´
And she showed him how to do it.
He just stood and looked embarrassed with a sheepish smile on his face.
Now what´s the worst thing?
People have no future.
People have lost the future. l´m getting drunk...finally.
May l introduce myself? l am Dr. Soltermann, and this is my colleague
Dr. Silbermann.
We are, as you might have guessed, in charge of St. Anna Clinic´s archives, the largest hospital archives in Europe and one of the largest in the world.
We have floor space of several thousand square meters, and our card index includes over 100,000 entries.
But then, the St. Anna Clinic has been in existence for 357 years... in various guises, of course.
May l show you to your place, Herr Rosenberg?
Yes, thank you.
Dr. Silbermann and l are very grateful to have an assistant.
We have been complaining to our chief, Professor Vergerus, for years to no avail.
So you must know you are very welcome, Herr Rosenberg.
You are very welcome,
Herr Rosenberg.
Don´t you think Dr. Soltermann speaks very good English?
- Very good.
- Dr. Silbermann is far too kind. l spent seven years in England before the war.
My doctor´s thesis dealt with erotic perversions in the writings of Ben Johnson, an interesting but limited subject.
We go here, please.
May l ask, Herr Rosenberg, if you have had any previous experience in archive work?
- No. Unfortunately l´ve--
- l was afraid so, but never mind.
Today l can give you a responsible task that calls for very little archive experience. l´m very grateful.
How do l find my way out?
At dinnertime either Dr. Silbermann or l will come for you.
You can rely on us.
We won´t forget you.
By the way, one thing l almost forgot-- all our material is strictly confidential. lt mustn´t be taken out of here, and you mustn´t read or try to decipher the documents that pass through your hands.
All the files are full of reports of inconceivable human suffering, of the battles of science, its victories and defeats.
This will be your place,
Herr Rosenberg.
We begin work each morning at 8:00 and finish at 6:00.
We have dinner at 1 :30.
We take turns to fetch it from the kitchen of the clinic.
We are also entitled to take home our supper in a special container.
These days that´s a priceless emolument.
Good morning, Herr Rosenberg.
Excuse me for asking.
What am l supposed to do?
You see these gray files here?
There are yellow files of a cheaper kind.
Your first task will be to remove the contents of the gray files...
...and transfer them to the yellow files, after which you will number and letter them in the same way as the gray ones.
Good luck, Herr Rosenberg.
- How´s it going?
- lt´s hard work.
- You´re not well.
- No.
Did you have something to eat today?
We have dinner in the hospital staff dining room.
When do you knock off? l think l get away at 7:00. l can take supper from the kitchen. lt´s part of the salary.
How are you getting on in the archives?
Fine. l don´t think l ought to stand here any longer.
They´re terribly strict.
You suddenly look so thin and pale. l´m all right, Abel. lt could have been worse. l must hurry.
- Couldn´t you just say you´re sick?
- l don´t dare.
- You were nearly run over.
- Thanks.
- How do you like it here with us?
- l´ve only just started.
- And Manuela?
- Ask her yourself.
Let´s meet one evening, the three of us. l´m in a hurry.
Dr. Soltermann went home after dinner.
He´s in poor health. l´m usually alone here in the archives nowadays.
With Dr. Soltermann away, l can say it.
Something terrible is going on here.
What?
Here, at the clinic.
Do you know what these are,
Herr Rosenberg? l don´t understand German.
They are reports, detailed reports, marked ´´secret.´´
So?
Reports concerning certain experiments undertaken at the clinic under the supervision of Professor Vergerus. l don´t get it.
Can you guess what kind of experiments, Herr Rosenberg?
How could l?
Very strange experiments.
Strange?
Experiments with human beings,
Herr Rosenberg.
The engine is driving me wild. l didn´t notice it.
But you do hear it, don´t you?
Yes, when you mention it.
- lt´s a trap.
- What is?
Don´t be an idiot.
We´re locked in.
Don´t get hysterical, Abel.
My head is splitting!
- You sure this gas isn´t leaking?
- lt isn´t.
- How can you be sure?
- Because l´ve tried it.
Then you did think it was leaking, didn´t you?
Stop raving at me like a lunatic. lf you want to leave, go!
So you want me to get out? l just say if you want to leave, you can go. l´ve done everything l can to keep us together. l just can´t go on anymore.
Do you hear what l´m saying? l can´t go on anymore! l give a damn about your fear! l give a damn about you!
Then you want me to leave.
No. l give up. l give up. l can´t.
- Just stay close.
- No, l can´t.
Lie still. l can´t stay like this.
A little while, Abel?
Go away.
Come home with me. lt´s warm.
You can have it any way you want.
You have dollars, don´t you?
Go to hell!
Where do you think we are?
Come on. Come on.
You´re trying to kill me!
You´re trying to drain me!
You´re trying to suck me!
Stella says l can´t fuck!
That bitch is jiving the whole goddamn world.
She´s got fangs in her cunt, man.
Fangs! ln her cunt! l saw them! l did! l saw them!
Mike, tell her that you and l have screwed seven times in at least seven different ways.
Mikaela, you know Monroe, and you know damned well he can only fuck faggots.
And if you say he even half screwed you, you´re lying.
Do you remember that time?
Do you remember that time, Stella, you had to go to the hospital because you thought you had syphilis?
- l didn´t have syphilis!
- But you thought you did.
Who was that sweet man who laid up next to you every night, stroking you, making you feel fine, at the risk of catching it?
You´d like some? lt´s nice.
- l didn´t have syphilis!
- But you thought you had syphilis!
You looked lousy!
You are lousy.
You used to be so beautiful.
She used to be so beautiful.
But now you are the worst bitch on the whole of Steinstrasse.
You l could screw anytime. lt´s just that...that... that big-mouth bitch that makes me nervous! l could screw you... l could screw you any amount of times.
You see, l´m not a queer! lt´s just a goddamn lie
Stella goes around telling everybody because l won´t get in between her legs!
A man could die in there!
You l could screw anytime!
- Here?
- What do you mean, here?
You say you could screw her anytime.
- Could you do it now?
- You´re like that!
Sure! Sure, l could! Sure! lf you think you´re going to watch for nothing, then you´re crazy.
Come on, Monroe, let´s show him what you´re made of.
- l´m going to bet on this.
- How about it?
You´ll be a rich man, Monroe.
Let´s go, Monroe, before l´m down.
You can have all the money from that guy who won´t tell us his name.
Wait, wait, wait.
Quiet now.
No fair laughing. l´ll help him.
He has to do it himself.
Say it, say it.
Say it, say it, say it. lt doesn´t work!
Say it!
Say, ´´Do it, Daddy.´´
Say, ´´Do it, Daddy´´!
Say it.
Monroe, don´t cry.
Don´t cry, Monroe.
We won! We won!
Stop laughing. Stop laughing!
On the morning of Wednesday, November 7th, there is no milk to be had in Berlin.
Many food shops remain closed.
They have nothing to sell.
The Reichsmark has practically ceased to exist.
The wads of bills are now counted by weight, and no more notice is taken of the printed value.
When you began your employment, l pointed out that working hours are from 8:00 to 6:00.
Could you be so kind as to show me to my workplace? l can´t find my way.
Of course.
Are there other people here in the archives?
Of course.
Every day we are visited by scientists from other institutions.
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
You behave most improperly to an old man. lt´s all so absurd and humiliating.
Surely you realize l won´t tell you anything, no matter how rough you are.
Unlike you, l have a conviction.
Something unheard of is happening down there in Munich.
A savior is born.
The delivery is taking place in pain and blood.
A terrible time is at hand.
But what are 30 or 40 years of suffering and death?
What do you or l matter?
What do even millions of lives matter?
There are plenty of human beings, Herr Rosenberg.
Kill me, Herr Rosenberg. l won´t resist.
My body is weak, but my soul is strong and calm. l think it´s better l lock the door so that no one will disturb us.
Dr. Soltermann warned me against you, but l didn´t believe him.
You say nothing.
Look at the screen and you´ll see some interesting pictures.
They were taken during our experiments here at the St. Anna Clinic.
This is a resistance experiment.
This woman, 30 years old, volunteered to look after a four-month-old baby with a brain injury who screams day and night.
We wanted to see what would happen to this completely normal, fairly intelligent woman if we shut her in with a child that never stopped screaming.
As you see, after 12 hours she is still quite self-possessed.
Now, however,
24 hours have passed.
We can see now that she is affected.
Her sympathy for the sick child has been wiped out, her feelings replaced by a deep depression, which in its turn paralyzes every initiative.
She has left the child to its fate.
Here we can see quite clearly the thought of ridding herself of the child has developed.
But it took another six hours before she carried out her intention, a remarkable resistance.
Unfortunately our camera didn´t manage to document the actual deed.
Our technique has not been quite perfected.
You would like to see more, wouldn´t you?
For seven days, this man was shut up in a cell so constructed that he could not move his arms, legs, or head. ln addition, he was deprived of all sound and was in total darkness. l know what you are going to say, Abel.
You are wondering how we could get anyone to agree to such an experiment voluntarily.
No trouble, l assure you.
People will do anything for a little money and a square meal.
These pictures are not particularly instructive but may be of physiognomic interest.
The subject was give an injection of Thanatoxin, a drug that produces violent anguish.
What you will see is someone subjected to unbearable agony.
Here you see him just as he´s given the injection.
You notice that he is quite balanced and is laughing and joking.
An unusually nice boy, incidentally.
He was a student of political science at the university.
We are now at the condition of dread, which is getting worse and worse. ln a few moments he´ll commit suicide.
Watch carefully. lt happens without any warning.
He picks up the revolver.
You can´t see it properly.
Now you can see it.
Then he puts it in his mouth.
The gun is not loaded, of course.
That student really did shoot himself a few days later, although the effects of the Thanatoxin had completely worn off.
Your brother Max... met with the same misfortune.
By the way, he was one of our best assistants.
He was really interested in our experiments.
He wanted to try out the Thanatoxin. l advised him not to, but he insisted.
His fiancée also helped us quite a bit.
They were very attached to each other and lived for a time in one of the apartments that you, yourself...
This is one of our most recent and interesting experiments.
The subjects are administered carefully controlled doses of Kapta Blue, a virtually odorless gas. lnitially the gas plays tricks with the behavioral centers, throwing the entire emotional balance out of kilter.
The subjects are stripped of their social defenses, lose their inhibitions, teeter madly between quickly changing moods which possess them.
Their reactions are so farcical, at times one can hardly keep from laughing.
Of course, repeated exposure to Kapta Blue can cause some permanent damage.
Perhaps you are wondering what my intentions were with you and Manuela, placing you in one of our experiment rooms.
Will you believe me if l tell you l had no intentions at all?
Except to help you.
As you saw, the building behind your rooms had been vacated.
Some time ago we were forced to transfer our activities to a more out-of-the-way place.
We must take great care.
Besides, our economic resources are limited.
We are financed entirely by private means. l´m not a monster, Abel.
What you have seen are the first faltering steps of a necessary and logical development. l know you have told lnspector Bauer of your experiences. l also know that justice, represented by the plodding inspector, has begun to move, slow and creaking.
He´ll be here soon with his police and his rusty guns.
But in a few moments, l´ll bite on this cyanide capsule. l did consider burning the archives and destroying the results of our work, but it seemed too melodramatic.
The law will confiscate our results and then file them. ln a few years, science will ask for the documents and will continue our experiments on a gigantic scale.
We are ahead of our time, Abel.
We are to be sacrificed. lt´s only logical. ln a day or two, maybe even tomorrow, the national units in South Germany will attempt a revolt led by an incredible scatterbrain called Adolf Hitler. lt will be a colossal fiasco.
Herr Hitler lacks intellectual capacity and method.
He doesn´t realize what tremendous forces he is about to conjure up.
He will be swept away like a withered leave the day the storm breaks.
Look at that picture.
Look at all those people.
They are incapable of a revolution.
They are far too humiliated, too afraid, too downtrodden.
But in ten years...
By then... the 10-year-olds will be 20, the 15-year-olds will be 25.
To the hatred inherited from their parents, they will add their own idealism and impatience.
Someone will step forward and put their unspoken feelings into words.
Someone will promise a future.
Someone will make demands.
Someone will talk of greatness and sacrifice.
The young and inexperienced will give their courage and their faith to the tired and the uncertain.
And then there will be a revolution, and our world will go down in blood and fire. ln ten years, no more, those people will create a new society unequalled in world history.
The old society was based on extremely romantic ideas of man´s goodness. lt was all very complicated since the ideas didn´t match the reality.
The new society will be based on a realistic assessment of man´s potentials and limitations.
Man is a malformation, a perversity of nature.
That is where our experiments come in.
We deal with the basic construction and reshape it.
We set the productive forces free and control the destructive ones.
We exterminate what is inferior and increase what is useful. l always liked you and Manuela.
She showed an affection for me which l hope was sincerely meant.
Against my better judgment, l tried to help you.
Comic, isn´t it, Abel?
One day you can tell all this to anyone who is willing to listen.
No one will believe you despite the fact that anyone who makes the slightest effort can see what is waiting in the future. lt´s like a serpent´s egg.
Through the thin membranes, you can clearly discern the already perfect reptile.
You were given Veronal.
You´ve slept for two days.
What day is it? lt´s the morning of November 1 1th.
- Can l have some water?
- Yeah. l´ve been in touch with Hollinger.
He thinks he can use you in his circus.
The German state will pay for a train ticket to Basel.
That´s where the circus will be for the next two weeks. l take it for granted that you will accept his kind offer, no? l think so. lt would be the simplest way, Herr Rosenberg.
A constable will go to the station with you.
The night train is supposed to leave at 1 1 :20.
Thank you.
Good-bye, Herr Rosenberg.
By the way,
Herr Hitler failed with his Munich putsch.
The whole thing was a colossal fiasco.
Herr Hitler and his gang underrated the strength of the German democracy.
Good-bye, Herr Rosenberg.
On the evening of Sunday, November 1 1th,
Abel Rosenberg escaped the police escort which was taking him to the railroad station.
He was never seen again.
Here comes the President's helicopter,
Marine helicopter number one...
landing in the Plaza on the east side of the east front of the Capitol.
Helicopter hovering gently, just off the ground.
Amazing timing. The President flying all the way across the world...
across the Atlantic Ocean...
arriving almost exactly as scheduled at 9:30...
in the Capitol Plaza...
so that he can go up the steps of the House of Representatives...
go into the chamber, and address the members of the House and the Senate...
the Supreme Court, the diplomatic corps of Washington...
all of whom are inside waiting for him...
in the chamber of the
House of Representatives.
Mr. Speaker...
the President of the United States.
And the President, accompanied by the Escort Committee...
comes down the central aisle, approaching the podium...
greets members of his Cabinet...
and those who are waiting to be confirmed as members of his Cabinet...
as he reaches the rostrum.
Shakes hands with the
Speaker, Carl Albert...
A happy President, smiling.
Ladies and gentlemen, President
Nixon will, in a moment...
address the Congress and the people of the United States.
Thank you.
Car 727. Car 727.
Open door at the
Watergate office building.
Possible burglary.
See the security guard.
Are you sure you want us?
517 is closer and they're in uniform.
They're getting gas. You take it.
Unit 1 to Unit 2.
Unit 1 to Unit 2.
- What?
- We're home.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
We have some activity here.
Silence is advised.
Shut it off.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
Lights on the eighth floor.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
Is there anybody there?
There's people, people on the balcony. Armed people.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
Base 1 to Unit 1. We may have some problems.
Someone's here.
- Hold it, you...
- Police!
Put your hands up!
Drop that jacket!
Walkie-talkie, two 35mm cameras.
Got it. That's good.
All right, stay there.
I already got something for you. Did you see this?
A couple sleeping in bed, car hits the house... goes through the bedroom, comes out the other side.
Good morning. Crash.
Lewis is over at
Democratic headquarters.
One of the burglars had $814.
One $230, one $215, and one $234.
Most of it was in $100 bills and in sequence.
- Woodward?
- Yeah?
There's been a break-in at the Democratic headquarters.
- There's been an arrest.
- Local Democratic headquarters.
They were bugging the place.
Check the time of arraignment, and get over there.
And, Woodward, it was National
Democratic headquarters.
All right.
- Anything else?
- Anything else?
Break-in, car crash. That's not bad for a Saturday.
Okay, let me know what happens. Hello, Carl.
Got anything on that couple?
Harry, I know somebody on the staff over at Watergate.
Bernstein, why don't you finish one story before trying to get on another?
I finished it.
- The Virginia Legislature story?
- I finished it.
All right, give it to me.
I'm just polishing it.
I'll work the phones.
Polishing it? Yeah, you work the phones.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, who are the lawyers for the five men arrested at Watergate?
Do you know?
- Well, these two were assigned to it.
- I'm sorry?
These two were appointed to the case.
But only now it turns out the burglars have their own counsel.
- The burglars have their own counsel?
- That's right.
That's kind of unusual, wouldn't you say?
For burglars it's unusual.
- You know the name of the counsel? -
I don't know. Some country-club type.
You are charged with soliciting prostitution...
at 14th and east street.
And you get as your solicitor, one Perry Woodstock.
Your Honor, Mrs. Hawkin has in the past been a reliable, hardworking parent.
Parents are sworn over. I think
$300 would be acceptable...
Excuse me, what is your name?
I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
- Markham.
- Markham.
Mr. Markham, are you here in connection with the Watergate burglary?
I'm not here.
Okay.
Well, clearly, I am here... but only as an individual, not as the attorney of record.
Who is?
Mr. Starkey.
- Do you have any...
- Whatever you want... you'll have to get it from him. I have nothing more to say.
Starkey.
S-T-...
Mr. Starkey was very helpful.
Four Cuban Americans and another man, James W. McCord.
Look, I told you inside,
I have nothing more to say.
I understand that.
What I don't understand is how you got here.
I assure you there's nothing very mysterious involved.
Well, a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of the lawyers... assigned to represent the burglars.
So?
They never would have been assigned to represent the burglars... had anyone known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel.
Only, the burglars couldn't have arranged for their own counsel... since they never even made a phone call.
So, if no one asked you to be here, why are you here?
I don't want you to take this personally, Mr...
- Woodward.
- Woodward.
It'd be a mistake to do that.
I just don't have anything to say.
Did one of the other men involved in the break-in call you?
What reason do you have to assume that there were other people involved?
Well, one of your clients was arrested with a walkie-talkie.
They're not my clients.
Now, I don't want to talk about this anymore.
You're a lawyer and you're here.
One of the defendants, Mr. Barker, and I met at a social occasion once.
- Where?
- I have nothing else to say.
A Miami social occasion?
Mr. Starkey says the
Cubans were from Miami.
L-62, James McCord.
L-63, Bernard Barker.
L-64, Virgil Gonzales.
L-65, Eugenio Martinez.
L-66, Frank Sturgis.
Please step forward, Attorney Starkey.
All charged with Burglary 2.
- Mr. Starkey, will you represent all five?
- Yes, Your Honor.
And are all five gentlemen charged with burglary, second degree?
Yes, Your Honor.
Your names, please, and state your professions.
Bernard Barker, anti-communist.
Anti-communist? That, sir, is not your average profession.
James McCord, security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
- Where in the government?
- Central Intelligence Agency.
Where?
The CIA.
Sturgis, Frank A., salvage operator.
Holy shit!
Eugenio Martinez, known as Gene Valdez.
James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin.
Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini.
All five of them had at least one alias.
Is there any proof they were trying to bug the National Democratic Chairman?
It's obvious they were trying to bug O'Brien.
They wouldn't go to all that trouble to bug secretaries.
- There's no proof.
- Wait a minute.
I called a lawyer in Miami I know.
He said four of the guys who were arrested were from Miami...
Gonzales, Martinez, Sturgis, and Barker.
Yeah, Barker. And all four of them were involved in CIA activities...
- No, they weren't.
- Yeah.
No, only one of them was admitted
CIA, and the CIA won't confirm that.
In fact, they deny even knowing McCord.
Yeah, but I just think it's obvious that with all that money and equipment... they weren't out to work by themselves. Somebody hired them.
I'm not interested in what you think is obvious.
I'm interested in what you know.
What we don't know is why they wanted to bug Democratic Headquarters.
Whether they were working for themselves... or other individuals or other organizations.
Could be a story, or could just be crazy Cubans.
Bachinski, when you get there tonight, take it easy.
The police are nervous.
Yeah?
Bachinski, calling from
Police Headquarters.
A friend just showed me what they found in the hotel rooms...
of the Watergate burglars.
There's something here you might want to look into.
Hang on. Okay, go ahead.
There's a strange entry in two of the burglars'address books.
- Yeah.
- One says, "H.H. At W.H."
The other says,
"Howard Hunt, W. House".
You can dial the White
House direct, can't you?
Yeah.
- What's the number? - 456-1414.
- White House.
- Howard Hunt, please.
Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.
He might be in Mr. Colson's office. I'll connect you.
Thank you.
- Charles Colson's office.
- Howard Hunt, please.
- Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.
- Do you know when he'll be back?
No, I don't.
Okay, thank you.
- Have you tried the Mullen Firm?
- I beg your pardon?
He also works as a writer at
Mullen & Company Public Relations.
Do you have a phone on that or an address, please?
No, I don't. I'm sorry.
All right, thank you.
Harry?
Who's Charles Colson?
Who's Charles Colson?
Sit down.
You know, I'm glad you asked me that question.
The reason I'm glad you asked me is because... if you had asked Simons or
Bradlee, they would've said:
"You know we're going to have to fire this schmuck at once because he's so dumb!"
Who is Charles Colson?
The most powerful man in the
United States is President Nixon.
You've heard of him?
Charles Colson is Special
Counsel to the President.
There's a cartoon on his wall.
Caption reads, "When you've got them by the balls...
"their hearts and minds will follow".
Mullen & Company.
- Howard Hunt, please.
- One moment, please.
Howard Hunt here.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
Yes, what is it?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number... were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Good God!
Do you care to comment?
In view that the matter is under adjudication, I have no comment.
Hello?
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
I was told that you had worked with a Mr. Howard Hunt.
Why would anyone say that?
You do know Mr. Hunt?
No, I don't believe so, and I can't imagine why anyone would say that.
Listen, I'm really sorry, but
I was on my way out. Goodbye.
Could we just confirm a couple... Bye.
- Did you say the Washington Post?
- Yes, that's right, the Post.
Your publishing firm was listed in some papers in connection with a Howard Hunt.
Yeah, he's one of our authors.
He wrote spy novels, I think.
What type of spy novels were they?
Were they modern, or were they period...
You say, "wrote"? You mean he's no longer with you anymore?
No, not at this time.
How long has it been since you've heard from him?
A couple of years, I think.
Could you tell me some of the names of the novels that he has written?
- Hello? Is this Mr. Paul Herrera?
- ¿Quién?
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
Bob Woodward of the...
Do you speak English?
Momento, momento.
Do any of you guys speak English?
Do any of you guys speak Spanish?
- Señor.
- Sí.
Never mind. Thank you.
Thank you. Never mind.
- Hello.
- Mr. Bennett?
- Yes.
- This is Bob Woodward...
of the Washington Post.
Sorry to bother you at home.
I was wondering if you could confirm some information... on one of your employees,
Mr. Howard Hunt?
What kind of information?
It's just profile information mostly.
We know, for example, that he works for Mullen & Company... or did work for Mullen & Company as a writer. He's also a novelist.
We know that he works in the office of
Mr. Charles Colson at the White House.
And the CIA.
And the CIA.
If you're conducting that kind of investigation...
then certainly it comes as no surprise to you that Howard was with the CIA.
No, no surprise at all.
Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970.
From '49 to '70. Now, this is on deep background... but the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
What else you got?
According to White House personnel...
Hunt definitely worked there as a consultant for Colson.
That's Charles Colson, the
President's Special Counsel.
Did you call the White
House Press Office?
I went over there. I talked to them.
They said Hunt hadn't worked there for three months.
Then a PR guy said this weird thing to me.
He said, "I'm convinced that neither Mr. Colson...
"nor anyone at the White House...
"had any knowledge of or participation in...
"this deplorable incident at the
Democratic National Committee".
- Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
- Absolutely.
So?
I never asked about Watergate.
I simply asked what were Hunt's duties at the White House.
They volunteered he was innocent when nobody asked if he was guilty.
Be careful how you write it.
Looks like we've got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
Harry, this isn't a police story anymore. This is national.
We need a top political writer on it.
Well, they don't want it.
They're all over the goddamned map covering the Primaries.
Besides, this guy has busted his ass.
He's been on this paper for only nine months.
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a humper!
What's he been writing about, rat shit in restaurants?
- He's got no experience.
- He got a few of them closed, didn't he?
Minor incidents. Small government agencies.
Have Mr. Moffitt come in here, please. And see if Mr. Bradlee's free.
I want Ben to hear this.
Sure Moffitt'll want the story for the National desk... now that we've built it into something.
Even Bernstein's busting his ass!
I read that cockamamie memorandum he wrote on the break-in.
All right, so some of it was bullshit.
What is the matter with you?
You told me yourself you were going to fire him last month.
Look, he wants on the story bad. They both do!
He knows a lot of people.
Howard, they're hungry!
You remember when you were hungry?
Hello. Can you get me Nigel...
Right away.
- How's it going?
- What are you doing?
- Polishing it a little.
- What?
- Polishing it.
- What's wrong with it?
Nothing. Nothing. It's good.
Then what are you doing with it?
I'm just helping. It's a little fuzzy.
May I have it?
I don't think you're saying what you mean.
I know exactly what I mean.
Not here, I can't tell from this whether...
Hunt works for Colson or Colson works for Hunt.
- May I have it, please?
- Some of the conclusions...
- May I have it?
- Yes. I'm not looking for a fight.
I'm not looking for a fight, either.
I'm just aware of the fact that you've only been here nine months.
What's that got to do with anything?
I've been in the business since I'm 16.
What are you saying?
I'm trying to tell you that if you'd read mine and then read yours...
- May I read yours?
- Yeah.
I walked by, gave yours a glance, it didn't look right... so I just figured I'd refine it a little.
The first paragraph has to have more clarity... if the reader's going to understand it.
You don't mention Colson's name till the third paragraph.
I think mine's better. But you go ahead and read it.
If you think yours is better, we'll give yours to the desk.
I've got Colson's name up front.
He's a White House consultant and nobody knows it.
You're right.
Yours is better.
If you're going to do it, do it right. Here are my notes.
If you're going to hype it, hype it with the facts.
I don't mind what you did.
I mind the way you did it.
Woodward. Bernstein.
You're both on the story.
Now don't fuck it up.
Steuben, what's the name of that girl that you bombed out with...
- that works in Colson's office?
- Sharon Lyle.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- You're attractive.
You are very attractive.
You know, my girlfriend told me to watch out for you.
- Who?
- I'm not giving any names.
Steuben said you worked for Colson.
Steuben's crazy. I never worked for Colson.
That's what he said.
I worked for an assistant. Colson was really big on secrets, anyway.
Even if I had worked for him, I wouldn't know anything!
Did you know Howard Hunt?
Didn't he work in the office?
Yeah, I knew Howard.
- Nice?
- He's a nice person.
He's secretive, he is secretive, but a decent man.
Do you have any idea what he did?
The White House said he was doing some investigative work.
What do you say?
- He was doing investigative work.
- On what?
- Different things.
- Like what?
She warned me.
I'm not going to take my book out. I'm just asking you.
The scuttlebutt for a while was that he was investigating Kennedy.
Go on.
The White House was real paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
I remember seeing a book about
Chappaquiddick on his desk.
And he was always getting material out of the White House Library... and the Library of Congress, and anything he could find.
White House Library.
Hi, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post... and I was just wondering if you can remember... any books that a Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy?
- Howard Hunt?
- Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I think I do remember.
He took out a whole lot of material.
- Why don't you hold on and I'll see?
- I sure will. Thank you very much.
- Mr. Bernstein?
- Yes, ma'am?
- I was wrong.
- I beg your pardon?
The truth is, I don't have a card that says Mr. Hunt took any material.
I don't remember getting material for...
I do remember getting material for somebody, but it wasn't for Mr. Hunt.
All right.
The truth is, I didn't have any requests at all from Mr. Hunt.
The truth is, I don't know any Mr. Hunt.
I was just wondering if you have any books... Hello?
Yes, we're checking that information now.
We'd just like to find out just what it was that Hunt did... when he worked out as a White House consultant on the Pentagon Papers.
Yes, I'd appreciate that, if you could.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
I just got off the phone with the White House librarian.
You want to look at the notes on it?
This is some stuff from the
Eisenhower campaign in 1952... that Hunt was connected with.
Did you call the White
House Communications Office?
No, I just got off the phone with the librarian.
- 524-743. - I know the number.
Between the first and second quote there's a complete contradiction.
It's a space of about five seconds.
- My feeling is...
- Was this all...
Mr. Clawson's office.
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
- Could I talk to Mr. Clawson, please?
- One moment, please.
Thank you.
When she came back she said she didn't even know...
- Ken Clawson.
- Mr. Clawson, this is Bob Woodward.
Carl Bernstein of the Washington
Post had a conversation... with a White House librarian... on some books a Mr. Howard Hunt took out on Senator Edward Kennedy.
She first said that Howard Hunt had taken out books on Senator Kennedy... and then she denied even knowing who he was.
I was wondering if you'd like to comment on this confusion.
Listen, let me call you back on this matter.
- I'm going to check on it for you.
- All right, thank you. Bye.
- Call back?
- Yes.
- This was all one conversation?
- Yeah.
She says first of all, "I think
I got a bunch of books on Hunt".
She comes back five seconds later, she says,
"I don't even know a Mr. Hunt".
It's obvious someone got to her.
Not enough proof. I mean, if there was just a piece of paper... that said that Hunt was taking out books on Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.
Like a... I don't know, library slip.
Hunt also took out books from the Library of Congress... but what's more important is that somebody got to her in that space of time.
- How do you know somebody got to her?
- Because she said that Hunt...
There was a lot of books that Hunt checked out.
And then she comes back and she don't even know him.
- Woodward.
- Mr. Woodward, Ken Clawson calling back.
- I've just talked with the librarian.
- Yes, sir.
She denies that the conversation with Mr. Bernstein ever took place.
She said she referred him to the Press Office.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you say she denies even knowing... about the conversation taking place?
That's right. She said someone did call her asking about Mr. Hunt...
but all she did was refer him to the Press Office...
and she denies that...
- any other conversation took place.
- Total bullshit.
- I hope that's been of some help to you.
- Thank you.
- We've got to get something on paper.
- The Library of Congress.
Mona?
Excuse me, Mona, could you take any calls for me, please?
- Sure.
- Here's my note.
If I get any calls...
- Will you be back later?
- I don't know when.
You want all the material requested by the White House?
All White House transactions are confidential.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- We need a sympathetic face.
- We're not going to find one here.
You want every request since when?
- When did he start?
- July of '71.
I imagine the whole last year.
I'm not sure you want them, but I've got them.
Maybe they pulled the cards.
Maybe they changed the names.
There might have been a card there, and we missed it.
Hey, wait a minute.
I met a White House aide once at a social occasion.
- So?
- He might confirm.
- Do we need W.H. In White House?
- Not in the second paragraph.
- I don't think we do. Do we?
- White House will be enough.
- White House.
- Just use White House. Forget the W.H.
I want to know about Colson. What was his job at the White House?
- Special consultant to the President.
- I gotta say it.
These notes on the White House librarian, are they accurate?
The White House librarian, the notes, are they accurate?
Yeah, but I wanna hear him say it.
- Okay, let's have it.
- Here you are, Ben.
It's a good, solid piece of American journalism...
that the New York Times doesn't have.
You haven't got it.
A librarian and a secretary saying Hunt looked at a book.
That's not good enough.
A White House aide told me that
Hunt was investigating Kennedy.
Who was it?
Who was it? You want the name, you mean?
No, how senior, how high up?
I don't know titles.
"Showed a special interest".
No, we said the White House was investigating Kennedy.
"Showed a special interest in him".
Jesus, the story's stronger than that.
The White House librarian says
Hunt checked out a lot of books.
We got a secretary in Colson's office said Hunt was sitting...
All right, Carl. Ben, that's a Page 1 story.
Stick it inside someplace.
This is a goddamn important story.
Get some harder information next time.
Asshole. Bradlee's just sticking up for the Kennedys.
- We didn't have it, that's all.
- Bullshit. We had it cold.
- No, we didn't.
- Why didn't you say something?
Do you think bitching about it is going to get the story where we want it?
Throw it in the can.
- Yes?
- This is Woodward.
I want to talk about
Watergate. I know...
We're not going to talk about that subject.
- We talked about Wallace.
- But this is different.
That was about the shooting of a man running for President.
- This is different.
- How?
Not about this story.
Don't call me again.
Good luck, Mr. President.
Taxi.
- Where are you?
- Stuck.
The story's stalled on us.
And you thought I'd help?
I'll never quote you.
I wouldn't quote you even as an anonymous source:
You'd be on deep background.
You can trust me. You know that.
Go on.
- Can you tell me what you know?
- You tell me what you know.
Hunt worked for Colson at the White House.
Hunt was investigating
Kennedy at Chappaquiddick.
That should tell you a lot.
What else?
We're beginning to hear a lot about a lawyer at CREEP named Gordon Liddy...
who's...
Gordon Liddy... was fired by Mitchell because he wouldn't talk to the FBI.
- You'll hear more.
- Will he talk?
I was at a party once, and...
Liddy put his hand over a candle, and he kept it there.
He kept it right in the flame until his flesh was burned.
Somebody said, "What's the trick?"
And Liddy said, "The trick is not minding".
The story is dry.
All we've got are pieces.
We can't seem to figure out what the puzzle is supposed to look like.
John Mitchell resigns as the head of CREEP... and says that he wants to spend more time with his family.
Sounds like bullshit. We don't exactly believe that.
No, but it's touching.
Forget the myths the media's created about the White House.
The truth is, these are not very bright guys... and things got out of hand.
Hunt's come in from the cold.
Supposedly, he's got a lawyer with $25,000 in a brown paper bag.
Follow the money.
What do you mean? Where?
I can't tell you that.
But you could tell me that.
No, I have to do this my way.
You tell me what you know and I'll confirm.
I'll keep you in the right direction if I can, but that's all.
Just follow the money.
- Goddamn New York Times.
- What is it?
Phone calls from burglars in
Miami to the Committee to Re-Elect.
Fifteen phone calls.
At least 15 phone calls and those phone calls were made as early as March 15... which is a full three months before the break-in.
"$89,000 issued in the name of a prominent Mexican lawyer".
$89,000 in Mexican checks?
Why didn't we get this?
Who are their sources?
I even know someone who works at the phone company.
Carl, if John Mitchell wanted your phone records... you'd be running around yelling invasion of privacy.
Was the New York Times article accurate?
- Yeah, but I can't get you a fuller listing.
- Why?
They've subpoenaed all of
Bernard Barker's phone records.
I think they're trying to find out if the
Watergate burglars broke any Florida law.
- Who subpoenaed them?
- Miami DA.
- What's his name?
- I don't know his name.
But, the guy who's heading the investigation is named Dardis.
Dardis. What's his first name?
I don't know his first name. I guess you'll have to find that out.
Hi. I'm Carl Bernstein, I have a
9:15 appointment with Mr. Dardis.
Yes, Mr. Bernstein, I'm afraid that Mr. Dardis... won't be able to see you this morning.
His calendar is really quite full.
There must be a mistake. I made the appointment with him personally.
- I called from Washington.
- It should've been made through me.
If you care to wait, I'll see if I can squeeze you in later.
Oh, thanks very much.
I guess it's difficult when he makes his own appointments.
Yes, well, we try to handle it.
It's 4:00, we'll be back in
15 minutes. You want anything?
- Coffee, black.
- Coffee, black.
I'm still here.
I'm so glad.
If you could just get me in to see him for five minutes, I'd appreciate it.
- No, Mr. Bernstein.
- I have to get back.
We're going to try.
Oh, hi. He's expecting you.
I do have a couple of things to do. I'll be at the Sheraton if you want to reach me.
If he has any space tomorrow, I'd appreciate it. Number's on the back.
- Fine.
- Thank you for your patience.
Thank you, Mr. Bernstein.
Tomorrow it should be better.
I guess so.
Mr. Dardis' office.
Hi. Please tell Mr. Dardis that
Mr. Bernstein has just left.
He'll be available all day tomorrow.
I think we can probably squeeze him in around 4:30.
Yes.
And please tell Mr. Dardis that he doesn't want to be late for his 6:30 appointment.
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.
Mr. Dardis' office.
- This is Mr. Martinson over at the County...
- I beg your pardon?
Martinson, over at the
County Clerk's office.
There's some records here that Dardis wanted right away.
Could you come and get them? We're closing.
Well, yes, I'll be right over.
Could be easier, too.
All right. Hold it.
- What?
- Excuse me.
Hi. Can I help you in some way?
I'm Carl Bernstein. I've been waiting since 9:00.
- Would you wait outside?
- I've been waiting out since morning.
- Go ahead. Finish your call.
- Wait outside, please, will you?
No. I'm the reporter from the Washington Post.
We talked on the telephone yesterday... and you told me to come on down here and I'm here.
Okay, yeah. I've got the press here.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
If you didn't want to see me
I don't know why the hell... you didn't tell me when
I was in Washington?
I just wasted a whole goddamned day here. My paper's waiting for a story.
You tell me yesterday to come here.
You said I got a 9:30 appointment.
- I've been waiting out here the whole day.
- Caught me on the worst day possible.
The man I work for has just started a re-election campaign.
Now, we're gonna have to see each other tomorrow. Okay?
No, sir, I'm facing a deadline and my paper's saving a space for me.
- I just don't have a minute now.
- Well, I'm sorry...
Mr. Dardis, I'm really very sorry about this. Mr. Bernstein...
I beg your pardon, ma'am, but this gentleman... made the appointment with me specifically.
And I think the Washington Post deserves the same courtesy... as any of the people waiting out there, with all due respect.
I'll buzz you in about five minutes.
The lady takes good care of me.
The fact is we just can't go into it this evening.
It's going to have to wait till tomorrow. Okay?
I just wish you could've told me that before I left... because I gotta go back to my paper now and write that story... one way or another, that's all.
Do you want to see Mr. Barker's phone records and his money records?
You told me on the phone if I'd come here you'd show everything you got on Barker.
- That's all I want.
- Well, that's what I've got.
Well, that's fine.
Okay, you and I are going to have to have an agreement... that you're not going to reveal the source of your information.
All these are cashier's checks on a bank in Mexico City.
- All these checks from Mexico?
- Sí.
How come? Did the money originate there?
Well, I doubt it started off as pesos.
Wait a minute, what's this one?
What's... Okay, $25,000.
- Who's that?
- Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
We haven't been able to ascertain who that is.
Bob, listen, I think I got something. I don't know what it is.
But somewhere in this world there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
And we've got to get to him before the New York Times does.
Because I think they have the same information.
Got a pencil? Write this down. Quick.
Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
D-A-H-L-B-E-R-G.
McGovern, who at first had voiced complete support for Eagleton...
has more recently expressed doubts...
and said that Eagleton must make a decision...
whether to stay or leave the ticket.
You're the one that wanted the articles...
- on Dahlberg, Kenneth H. Dahlberg?
- Yeah.
Couldn't find anything in the clip file at all.
Oh, wonderful.
I did find one picture though, if it's any help.
Thanks.
Minnesota.
Minneapolis...
I base that conclusion upon my conversations with his doctors...
and my close personal and political association...
- Outside line, please.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
...the joint decision...
that we have reached tonight, health would not affect.
But the public debate...
over Senator Eagleton's past medical history...
continues to divert attention from the great national issues...
that need to be discussed.
I have referred to the growing pressures that ask...
for Senator Eagleton's withdrawal.
Hello?
- Could I please... Mr. Dahlberg?
- Yes.
- Kenneth Dahlberg?
- Yes.
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
- Yes?
- About that $25,000 check... deposited in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars...
Mr. Bernard Barker...
As you know, sir, the check has your name on it.
We were doing a story on this... and I was wondering if you would care to comment or explain?
I turn all my money over to the Committee.
What committee is that, sir?
The Committee to Re-Elect?
- Yes.
- Why would you do that?
I raise a lot of money. I'm
Midwest Finance Chairman.
For the Committee to Re-Elect?
- Hello?
- Yes, that's right.
How do you think your check got into the bank account of the Watergate burglar?
I'm a proper citizen.
What I do is proper.
Oh, I understand.
I've just been through a terrible ordeal.
My neighbor's wife has been kidnapped.
How do you think your check got into Barker's account list?
- Committee to Re-Elect the President.
- Could I speak to Mr. Clark MacGregor?
- One moment, I'll connect you.
- Thank you.
Yes?
- Mr. MacGregor?
- Yes.
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
- Hello?
- Yes.
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
I just spoke to a Mr.
Kenneth Dahlberg... who says that he is
Midwest Finance Chairman.
Yeah, I know Ken Dahlberg.
Well, I can't seem to get an explanation on why a check... for $25,000 made out to Mr. Dahlberg... that he apparently sent to the
Committee to Re-Elect the President... would end up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar.
I don't know.
- But you're head of the Committee, sir.
- Look, I just came aboard.
John Mitchell was the head of the Committee. He might know.
Well, what would the explanation possibly be...
I don't know.
You're implying that I should know...
and if you print that, our relationship will be terminated.
Sir, we don't have a relationship.
The issues of the campaign are peace and prosperity...
not a campaign check.
- Bob.
- Sir, no one is saying...
...this happened before I came on board.
- Mr. Dahlberg is on line 2.
I'm running a campaign for the re-election of the President.
We've raised $60 million and you're asking about a $25,000 check.
Mr. MacGregor, excuse me, could you hold one second, please?
- All right.
- Thank you. Yes?
- Hello.
- Mr. Dahlberg?
- Yes?
- Could you please hold one second, sir?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Mr. MacGregor?
- Yeah?
Can I call you right back, sir? I'm very sorry.
- Yeah, okay.
- Mr. Dahlberg.
Yes. I'm sorry I hung up before.
I wasn't sure you were a
Washington Post reporter.
I believe we were talking about a $25,000 check.
Obviously this is difficult for me.
I'm caught in the middle of something and...
I don't know what.
What do you think it could be?
I deal with a lot of important people.
People who work for the Committee? Hello?
For the Committee.
- The Committee to Re-Elect the President? - Yes.
You see, I raised that money in cash...
and I have a winter home in Florida.
- Is that Miami?
- Boca Raton...
and I didn't want to carry all that cash around.
- Now, you can understand that.
- Of course I can.
So, I had it exchanged for the cashier's check.
And how do you think it got into Barker's account?
I know I shouldn't be telling you this...
I gave it to Mr. Stans.
I beg your pardon?
I gave it to Stans.
Maurice Stans?
- The head of finance for Nixon?
- Yes, in Washington.
Now what he did with it, I really do not know.
I see. Were there any other checks that you might be aware of, that could...
That's all I have to say.
Mr. MacGregor... Mr. Dahlberg...
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.
- Bob?
- Yeah.
- Carl Bernstein on line 1.
- One?
- Yeah?
- Woodward?
- Bernstein.
- I think I got a lead on Dahlberg.
- I just... I got it.
- What?
I just talked to him.
I just hung up from him.
Bernstein, listen, it goes all the way to Stans!
- What're you talking about?
- It goes all the way to Stans.
He gave the check to Stans for the Committee to Re-Elect!
- Did he say that?
- He said it. I've got it in my notes.
- Jesus.
- It's down on record, Bernstein.
That money winds up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar?
- Yes!
- Fantastic. I'm coming home.
Okay.
... catapulted the unknown Senator from
Missouri into national prominence...
by naming Eagleton as his running mate.
... bolstering of support for the Democratic ticket...
Scott, what happened with that Taiwan thing you were telling us about?
Japan is going to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan... when they recognize Red China.
The irony, of course, that's a direct result of Nixon's visit to China.
Jesus, what did he tell them? What did he say to them?
Incidentally, that's a great parallel story... if you're going to do that piece on détente.
Right, "Queen Elizabeth proclaims a state of emergency...
"to deal with what we call a 'dock strike' ".
Breaking it off...
I'll give you a human interest.
"Thirty-one days of rain in the Philippines...
"is being blamed on the theft of a statue of Jesus".
We had one like that before.
- I'll put my best writer on that.
- What about the one in India?
Laugh, gentlemen, it'll be the only story everyone reads.
Okay, National?
We have the Bremer diary.
"Wish to kill Nixon".
He took a car trip to New York,
Ottawa, and Washington to kill him.
We have the "Senate approving the ABM Treaty".
ABM.
Of course, we have "McGovern offering the VP spot..." to everybody.
- Yeah, that's news.
- I have...
Because everybody's been offered it.
Now, I'll tell you what will be news.
When somebody accepts it. That's news.
Here is some great art.
McGovern and Humphrey at breakfast, smiling their asses off.
Isn't that great?
- He says, "I am George's friend..."
- Why is that man smiling?
Sounds friendly. Very friendly.
"I'll be helping him in ways he never dreamed possible".
Breakfast followed by lunch.
Okay. Metro?
Well, we got the schoolteachers on Capitol Hill.
They want a 17% increase in pay or this fall they go on strike.
Harry, I think we could mention that this might be the time... to go to the front page on the district home rule.
- Oh, come on!
- Listen to him.
Ben, this time it could go all the way.
The House is going to vote next week on a Senate resolution.
Okay then, well, when they pass it, we'll run with it.
Okay, fellas, let's go around again now. Foreign?
Taiwan emergency, Philippines.
Okay, fine. National?
I'll stand on the
Eagleton follow-ups...
McGovern not being able to get a replacement.
He's offered it to Humphrey, Kennedy, and Ribicoff. All turned him down.
That's the Page 1 lead right there.
You're ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions.
Nobody cares about the
Dahlberg repercussions.
Now look, it was our story that got the General Accounting Office... to start an audit with CREEP Finance.
We printed that didn't we? When the frigging audit's done, we'll print that, too.
Let me tell you what happened today.
I was having lunch at the Sans Souci, and... this White House guy, a good one, a pro... came up and asked me, "What is this
Watergate compulsion with you guys?"
Compulsion? This is a story.
This is not compulsion.
I said, "Well, we think it's important".
And he said:
"If it's so goddamn important, who in the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?"
Now, what do you expect him to say from the White House?
"You're doing a great job"?
Why don't you ask him what he's really saying?
He wants to take the story away from Woodstein and...
- give it to his National desk.
- At least I have... some experienced guys sitting around who know the politicians...
- who have the contacts.
- We're aware of that.
You said it. Sitting around.
Ben, it's a dangerous story for this paper.
- What if your boys get it wrong?
- Then it's our ass, isn't it?
We all have to go out and work for a living.
National gets eight columns.
Nine for Foreign.
Metro, 15.
That's it, fellas.
Hey, Scott, I need to see you.
How dangerous?
Well, it's not just that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me... or that everything we print, the White House denies... or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
What then?
Look, there are over 2,000 reporters in this town... are there five on Watergate?
Where did the Washington Post suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom?
Why would the Republicans do it?
McGovern is self-destructing, just like
Humphrey, Muskie, the bunch of them.
I don't believe their story.
It doesn't make sense.
Yeah, Bernstein.
Now? All right.
Woodward, Bradlee will see us now.
Answer the phone for me, will you?
Are you trying to find the lowest possible common denominator...
Ben, it's the hottest item.
- It's in over 500 papers.
- What is it?
Yesterday's weather report for people who were drunk... and slept all day.
Jesus! Send it out...
to the San Francisco
Chronicle. They need it.
- How about the crossword puzzle?
- No.
Anagrams?
- No space, Mickey.
- Goodbye.
The last thing you bought from me was the obituaries.
- Make him buy something, will you?
- All right.
Hey, what do you guys want?
The GAO report's due out the morning of Nixon's renomination.
Sit down.
Well, that's two weeks from now.
Since they're only responsible to Congress... there's no way the White House can control the investigation.
There's a source over at General
Accounting that tells us... there's a whole rat's nest of illegal shit going on over at CREEP.
- Like what?
- Like a slush fund.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars of unaccounted-for cash.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars?
Any comment from CREEP?
Yes. Unavailable for comment. They're not talking.
But what else besides the money? Where's the goddamn story?
The money's the key to whatever this is.
- Says who?
- Deep Throat.
- Who?
- Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak... his source in the executive...
Garage freak? Jesus, what kind of a crazy, fucking story is this?
Who did you say?
He's on deep background.
I call him "Deep Throat".
Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing...
Nixon's guaranteed the renomination...
and the Post is stuck with a story no one else wants.
It'll sink the goddamn paper.
Everyone says, "Get off it, Ben".
And I come on very sage... and I say, "You'll see.
You wait till this bottoms out".
But the truth is, I can't figure out what we've got.
What else are you working on?
We're after a list of CREEP employees.
- Where is it?
- It's classified.
- How are you gonna get it?
- We haven't had any luck, yet.
Get some.
Anything else?
You made a mistake in there.
What?
You said to Brad that we haven't had any luck yet... and that's the thing that he jumps on. You can't talk about luck.
If you can't talk in specifics, you shouldn't say anything.
Is there any place you don't smoke?
- What?
- Hold it.
- What're you doing?
- Kay Eddy.
Doesn't she go with a guy that works for the Committee to Re-Elect?
- The E.R.
- All right.
- Eddy? Hey. Kay, can...
- Just a second.
- 757-6521. - Okay, I'll get back to you on this, thanks.
Don't you go with a guy that works for the Committee to Re-Elect?
- Not anymore.
- You did go with him, though.
I think you were engaged to him, weren't you?
- Yeah.
- You got out of it?
- So?
- You're looking better.
Look, we need a list of the people that work there.
Do you think that...
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
It's personal.
What do you mean? You said it was over.
You're asking me to use a guy I care about.
- No. We're not asking you to use him...
- Well, sure...
...just to help us. I mean, we'd do the same for you.
My only chance of getting that story is if I see him.
I don't want to see him again.
- Do you have to see him?
- Sure, I have to see him.
No. Do you have to see him that way?
Can't you just call him up on the telephone... and say you want to have a drink with him, just feel him out?
You say the relationship is over.
What the hell do you have to lose?
Forget it.
We don't want you to do anything that would embarrass you... or that you don't feel right about.
Forget it.
Don't let her just get off. I think she was going to say something.
You just overdramatized it, she was going to give us what we want.
It's over.
- What?
- It's over.
Is this the whole list?
Look what it says. "Personnel,
Committee to Re-Elect the President".
This is all in alphabetical order.
You can't tell who works for who.
Well, find out the department heads like Mitchell, Magruder, Stans.
Here. John Mitchell.
- What's the number?
All right. Find somebody who has a number close to it.
- They probably work for him.
- There's a 303.
Okay.
Okay, we have to find out how the money got from Maurice Stans to the burglars.
Somebody who worked in Finance.
All right. Here's the head of
Finance. Maurice Stans, 269.
If we can just get somebody who works under Stans.
- Sloan? You need him?
- He's the treasurer.
- What's the number?
- Hugh Sloan, 287.
Is there a secretary?
Wait a minute. Manley.
Here it is. Irene Manley?
1406 Lee Jackson Memorial Highway.
- Hi, I'm Bob Woodward.
- I'm Carl Bernstein.
We're from the Washington Post.
We'd like to know if we could speak to you for a few minutes.
We understand your daughter works for the Committee to Re-Elect.
- Wouldn't be anything embarrassing.
- Would you object to just...
- Yes?
- Hi.
Miss Milland? Betty Milland?
- I'm Bob Woodward.
- Carl Bernstein.
We're from the Washington Post.
I know you're trying to do your job. I mean...
You don't understand the pressure that we're under.
It'll just take a couple of seconds. If we can just come in for a couple of...
- No, I really don't...
- We don't want to come in.
We understand that there was some documents... that were shredded at the Committee.
Well, there...
There's often shredding.
We do that a lot.
- Were you there during the shredding?
- Yes, I was.
I see. Were there any department heads from... the Committee who were also present?
Yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night.
John Mitchell? The Attorney General?
He was carrying a raincoat over his head.
I thought he was going to go...
Did he supervise the shredding?
Can I not answer any more questions? I'd just soon not...
Okay? Maybe I could call you?
- Are you being told not to talk?
- Will you call us?
I don't know.
I'll try.
What about all that shredding that took place after the break-in?
Need to know more about the papers that were in shredding.
I think you've some idea what's in the papers... when the former Attorney
General comes to the office... when it's taking place at the Committee to Re-Elect... and got a raincoat over his head. Why's he in a raincoat?
Could be raining is what could've happened.
Let me go through the story again.
You got a woman who's frightened at the door. Works for CREEP.
She said there's shredding taking place.
We don't know what's in the papers.
We know the former Attorney General comes in with an overcoat over his head.
It could be raining.
There's a lawyer present.
We don't know what he asked them. She wouldn't talk about it.
Now, will you please tell me where there's a story?
There's a story in the fact that the interview did not take place in her home... but in the office of the
Committee to Re-Elect.
How's there a story in that? It's not enough!
There's a story because there's a lawyer in the office.
- I mean, you're more resistant than she is.
- That's right.
- Why?
- Because there's not enough fact.
Well, let's just turn around and go back and question her again.
- This won't take long at all. We just want...
- Please go away, okay?
Will you please leave before they see you.
- Who did you mean by...
- Who do you mean, "they"?
Could you give us their names?
We haven't revealed the sources of people that have talked to us.
You know, I really can't talk about this because...
Would "they" be members of the Committee?
Someone got to that woman.
It's the key to the whole cover-up.
How can you write that there's a cover-up?
We don't know that there's a cover-up!
Well, then, I don't know what the hell you need.
So, you tell me what you need.
I need more fact for a story is what I need... and I think you should need the same thing.
Okay, if you get in the car... and there's music playing in the car, hypothetically.
There's music playing in the car for 10 minutes... and there's no commercial.
What can you deduce from that?
- Is it AM or FM?
- Come on, Bernstein!
Is it AM or FM?
A guy can come up to me on the street and he can ask me an address.
Now, is the man interrogating me, or is he lost?
What kind of a story do I write?
What kind of a deduction do I make from that?
Because you don't have a gut feeling that the woman is trying to help us?
No, I don't have enough gut feeling and I wish I did.
We're from the Washington Post...
Abbott, Addis, Agusto, Albus...
Is there something that strikes you as odd about this?
- What?
- It's almost like there's a pattern...
to the way they're not talking.
The way they say "no"all the time. I think it's odd.
- Mrs. Hambling?
- Yes.
Hi, we're from the Washington Post.
I'm Carl Bernstein, this is Bob Woodward.
A friend of the Committee said that we could contact you.
- Who was it?
- We can't reveal that.
You can talk to us. We don't reveal our sources.
You people...
You think you can come into my home, ask a few questions... have me destroy the reputations of men that I work for and respect?
Do you understand loyalty?
Have you ever heard of loyalty?
- Hi.
- Yes?
I'm Bob Woodward.
Carl Bernstein. We're from the Washington Post.
Yes.
I've read what you've written. I want to thank you.
I've been a Republican all my life, but this goes beyond party politics.
Would you mind if we asked you a few questions?
No. Come in. Would you like coffee?
Sure.
What they've done is a threat to the Constitution.
It goes against everything we stand for.
Could you be a little bit more specific than that?
I'm afraid your articles have just scratched the surface.
You don't mind if I just take a few notes, do you?
No.
How long have you worked at the Committee?
Committee?
Yes, the Committee to
Re-Elect the President.
Oh, I don't work at the Committee to Re-Elect the President.
I work at Garfinkel's, in the accounting department.
- Miss Abbott?
- Yes.
Judith Abbott?
Carolyn Abbott.
We're just doing something wrong.
- Never been there.
- No.
We're doing something wrong.
It's just not good enough.
How can you keep going at something past the point when you believe it?
We just have to start all over again.
Nasmith, Narrow, Ness...
Nickels, Nixon...
Ed Nixon.
Jolson, Jones...
Jordan, Jost.
If we could only get somebody that worked for Finance to talk.
I can't believe it.
- What about the bookkeeper?
- Which bookkeeper?
The bookkeeper that worked for both Slans and...
- Oh, you're all right.
- Sloan and Stans.
I've been there. I've called her twice. There's no answer.
I say we should start again.
Abbott, Addis, Agusto...
Albus, Aldus, Alexander...
Balowski, Clan, Donstille...
Boyle, Brenner, Bromley...
Jost, Nasmith...
Narrow, Ness, Nickels...
Martini, Sandstrom...
Skroes, Skully...
Skully. We've been there twice.
All right, Willcox, Windfall, Winter...
Two weeks work, half the names crossed off and what've you got?
People aren't talking, Harry.
And it's the way they're not talking that's unnatural.
Harry, we've been up all night. We went over all the quotes of the people.
- Slamming doors in our faces.
- It's like they're getting instructions.
Want to hear some real news?
That GAO report in which you placed so much faith... well, it's been postponed till after tonight's renomination.
- What do you mean?
- Hughes got a call from Stans in Florida.
Says he has new information, not to republish without it.
They're going to bury the report until after the renomination.
The Grand Jury indictment will be out soon and every indication says... the indictment will stop at the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.
And that's the end of your story.
The vote of all the delegates has been recorded.
The vote for Richard Nixon...
is 1,347.
The vote for Paul McCloskey is one.
And therefore I declare the nominee of the Republican Party...
for President of the United States...
President Richard Nixon.
Four more years!
The President, and the future President of the United States of America!
Wonderful young faces I see out there.
Your enthusiasm, your idealism, your hard work.
This is your first vote, and years from now...
I just hope you can all look back...
and say it was one of your best votes. Thank you.
Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and...
I just want to ask you a couple of questions.
Well, you don't want me. You want my sister.
It's for you. It's Carl Bernstein.
Oh, my God. He's the guy from the Post. Get rid of him.
Could I just borrow one of your cigarettes there?
Sure.
You've really got to go.
Sure. Could I just get a match?
I can understand your being afraid.
There's a lot of people at the Committee just like you... who wanted to tell the truth but some people wouldn't listen.
Certain people have gone back to the prosecutors and the FBI... to give information which they were never asked.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance... and we were just wondering if you were... promoted to work for Mr. Stans immediately after Mr. Sloan quit... or whether there was some time lapse?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
Can I get you some coffee or something?
Yeah. Thanks very much.
Door sticks.
Could I just sit down for a second?
Sure, you can sit down, but I'm not going to tell you anything.
Okay.
I was just curious why you lied just then.
Have you been threatened if you tell the truth?
No.
Never in so many words.
- How do you like it?
- Just milk.
- Thanks.
- Okay, I'll just get that.
I saw in the wires that Mrs.
Stans was in the hospital.
Is she feeling better?
The GAO, the General
Accounting Report said that... there was $350,000 in the safe of the
Committee to Re-Elect the President.
Were you aware that it was that kind of funds from the very beginning?
A lot of people are watching me. They know I know a lot.
Was it all in $100 bills?
A lot of it was.
I thought it was an all-purpose, political fund... you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
$350,000 for dinners?
How was it paid out?
Not in one big chunk.
There was a list of 15 names and the amount of money... given to each person next to the name.
What happened to the list?
It was destroyed. It was the only record.
Don't pay attention to this. This is for my memory.
I have a very bad memory.
You won't be quoted by name.
In fact, we get confirmations before we print anything.
I can't be... positive that that money was used for the break-in, you understand?
Yes, I do.
- But, people sure are worried.
- Which people?
Think you could help me with the disbursement of money... in terms of the number of people that were involved? How many?
A group of them. About five.
I don't know their names.
Would Mr. Sloan know?
- Would he...
- I don't want to say anymore, okay?
I won't be much longer.
I wondered if you could just help me a little bit about... the money. We hear all kinds of figures.
- There's so much of it.
- How much is "so much"?
In one two-day period,
$6 million came in.
- Six!
- Six million, cash.
We didn't know where to put it all.
I thought it was all legal.
I mean, I guess I did until... after the break-in when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
- This is Mr. Liddy?
- It's all so rotten.
It's getting worse.
And the only one I care about is Hugh Sloan.
His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right.
So, he quit.
I was wondering... if Hugh Sloan was being set up now as a fall guy for John Mitchell.
What do you think?
If you guys could get John
Mitchell, that would be beautiful.
Coffee's cold.
Is there any evidence that... any of Mr. Mitchell's assistants... were part of this?
I had all the evidence. It was destroyed. I don't know who destroyed it.
- I think Gordon did a lot of shredding.
- Hard evidence?
Well, I can't say that it would positively prove that they planned the break-in... but it would come pretty close.
Can you tell me anything about who got the money?
We have... had some help on this from a couple of sources... and this is a way of confirming it.
I don't want you to feel that you're in a position... where you have to disclose names.
I can just ask you initials... and then that way you're not divulging any information.
We have some idea.
Would that be all right?
Was there an "M"?
Can you just nod either way?
Did it go that high up?
"L"?
I don't want to say any more, okay?
I'm sorry. You said "L"... or... I get confused.
Could we just go back for a second?
In one six-day period, over $6 million came in.
You wouldn't believe what was going on inside that woman.
The stuff was just ready to pour out.
I'm pouring down cups of coffee trying to get it out of her... before she throws me out of the house.
- Give me your notes so...
- These are the notes.
- These are the notes?
- I've got stuff on napkins, matchbooks...
I'm writing in the bathroom while she's getting coffee.
- I'm a walking litter basket!
- You're crazy.
You'd be crazy, too, if you were operating on 20 cups of coffee.
Could you give me something I can get down?
I got it. I got it all.
Okay. Write.
- Mitchell was in control.
- Wait a minute.
- There were men working under Mitchell...
- How many?
I don't know how many, but the men working under Mitchell... received the money from the slush fund.
Do we know how much money?
We're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars.
And these men are the key to what that money was used for.
Boy, that woman was paranoid.
At one point, I suddenly wondered how high up this thing goes... and her paranoia finally got to me.
I thought what we had was so hot, that any minute CBS or NBC... would come in through the windows and take the story away.
You're both paranoid.
She's afraid of John Mitchell, you're afraid of Walter Cronkite.
- Right.
- Can we go back to what she said?
Here. "L," "P," and "M."
- What do you mean?
- It's "L," "P," and "M".
- She'd only give initials.
- Initials?
The initials are the name of the men that worked under Mitchell. "L," "P," and "M."
You couldn't get the names?
If I could've gotten the names,
I would've gotten the names!
I'm with the woman, trying to get anything I can.
She said "L," "P," and "M," that's all she would give me... are the people who worked under Mitchell.
She said something about
Mitchell. She hates him.
She said, "John Mitchell...
"If you guys could get John Mitchell, that would be beautiful".
Wait a minute, what's this here?
What are you writing about Sloan?
"Sloan was the treasurer of the Committee to Re-Elect.
"His wife is pregnant and she made
Sloan quit because apparently...
"he no longer wanted to be a part of it".
We've got to go see Sloan.
Okay. Make a note of it. So, what have we got?
Where's that matchbook?
- Here.
- "L," "P," and "M."
Okay, "L," "P," and "M."
- "L" could be La Rue. It could be Liddy.
- "L" is Liddy.
- How do we know that?
- Because she said it.
Right here. She said, "At the time of the break-in...
"there was so much money floating around...
"that I know Gordon got part of it".
So I said, "You mean Gordon Liddy?"
She said, "Yes".
So, "L" is Liddy. Okay, that leaves "P" and "M."
"P" could be...
Parkinson. It could be
Porter. It could be...
Wait a minute! There was a guy once.
There was a guy we talked to last week.
Didn't he say that there was a Bart Porter... who at one time was a member of the Committee to Re-Elect?
Porter was called before the Grand Jury investigation.
So "P" is definitely Porter.
"P" could be Porter.
"P" is Porter, "L" is Liddy.
All that leaves is "M"!
"M" could be McCord? That's out.
It could be Mardian.
It could be...
- Magruder!
- I think it's Magruder.
- I think it's Magruder, too.
- Why do you think it's Magruder?
Because he was second in command under Mitchell.
Why do you think it's Magruder?
Because at one time he was a temporary head... of the Committee to
Re-Elect, before Mitchell.
I don't want a cookie.
We've got to get that bookkeeper to say it was Magruder.
Never get her to say anything about "M."
We have got to go back there and try to get her to say it.
If we could make names of the initials... then we'll know the people at
CREEP who paid off the burglars.
We'll at least know who got the money.
The indictments that came down from the Grand Jury today... stopped... with the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.
Carl, we have got to go back there and get that bookkeeper... to say who the names are and not initials.
She ain't going to give it to you... because I was with the woman for six hours.
- We have to try.
- Then you'll have to trick her, threaten her.
- She's not going to do it.
- Wait a minute.
- You know what we could do?
- What?
- Listen, we go back there...
- Yeah.
...and you ask her who "P" is.
- Yeah.
And then I say, "No, don't worry about it...
"we know 'P' is Porter".
I just bury it.
Okay. Now, wait a minute.
I say to her, "Who is 'P'?"
- And then you say to me...
- I say, "No, we know 'P' is Porter".
- You mean, you try to fake her out?
- Right.
- And what if she denies it?
- We're screwed.
- So?
- But if she doesn't, we know we got it.
- We know "P" is Porter.
- Try it.
Hi.
They'll see you.
Not if you let us in, they won't.
And I'm Bob Woodward.
- They'll see your car.
- We parked around the corner.
You have answers for everything, don't you?
If we did, we wouldn't be here.
You wrote what I told you.
Oh, no. Not your name.
No one knows it was you.
Could you tell us who got the money?
And how much?
You mean like, "What did you do with the $25,000, lady?"
What?
Little jokes they're making down at Finance these days.
If people are to be convinced... that Stans and Sloan are innocent, then our reporting must be precise... and you can help us.
Who is "P"?
"P" we know, is Porter.
You said, "$25,000."
Is that how much Porter got?
Was it more?
Was it more than $50,000?
Was Magruder the only
"M" to receive money?
Who told you about Porter?
I'd like to move on now to the subject of the break-in at the Watergate...
and the controversies that keep coming up out of that.
It has recently, very recently been reported now, that...
some documents were torn up...
at the Committee to
Re-Elect the President.
Are you investigating the tearing up of those documents...
Well, I think that came out in a story in the Washington Post.
- Yes.
- I think the investigation...
that has just concluded itself...
has probably been one of the most intensive...
that the Department of Justice and the FBI has ever been involved in.
Some 1,500 persons were interviewed...
1,800 leads were followed,
333 agents were involved...
14,000 man-hours...
fifty-one of the 59 FBI field officers were involved.
And that, I think...
is a great credit to justice in this country.
Did you know that documents had been destroyed?
No, I did not.
All these neat little houses and all these nice little streets.
It's hard to believe that something's wrong in some of those little houses.
No, it isn't.
- Hello, I'm Carl Bernstein.
- Bob Woodward.
We'd just like to talk to Mr.
Sloan for a couple of minutes.
- He's resting right now.
- Are you Mrs. Sloan?
- You're the two from the Post, aren't you?
- Yes.
This is an honest house.
That's why we'd like to see your husband.
Faced with certain criminal charges that might be brought... against some people that are innocent, we just feel that...
It's really for his benefit.
No, it's not.
No, it's not.
Deborah, tell them to come in.
Thanks.
- Hi, Carl Bernstein.
- How do you do? Hugh Sloan.
- Bob Woodward.
- How are you doing?
I appreciate you giving us the time.
You know, the reason that we're here, basically... is that we've talked to certain people who... have indicated that the reason you left the Committee... was because you no longer want to be part of it.
Yeah, right. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation... why the money was handed to
Liddy and Mitchell's aides.
Try to understand this.
- I'm a Republican.
- I am, too.
Well, I believe in Richard Nixon.
I worked in the White House for four years and so did my wife.
What happened on June 17, I don't think the President knew anything about.
Is it possible that some of his people might have known?
I'm not sure about that.
Do you think the truth will ever come out at the trial?
- That's another thing I'm not sure about.
- Why?
Well, obviously, because certain people lied to the prosecutor.
No. We were never told flat out, "Don't talk!"
But the message was clear, though.
In other words, by their very silence, there was a cover-up.
Well, they didn't urge us to come forward and tell the truth.
"They," meaning the White House?
Well, the Committee's not an independent operation.
Everything's cleared with the White House.
And I don't think the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
That report on the cash... in the CREEP safe, that $350,000?
- No, more.
- Was that a correct figure?
No, it was closer to $1,000,000.
And, as treasurer, you could release those funds?
When so ordered.
We don't know the names of the people who could order you.
- We just know that there were four.
- No, there were five.
Mitchell, Stans,
Magruder, they're obvious.
- There had to be a White House overseer.
- Yeah, Colson.
No, Colson's too smart to get involved directly with anything like that.
It's Haldeman.
Right?
I won't talk about the other two.
They both worked at the White House?
One of them did, the other one's not in Washington. But that's all I'll say.
- Kalmbach.
- Nixon's personal lawyer.
- Right?
- Nixon's personal lawyer?
I can't say anything. I'm sorry.
- Well...
- When's the baby due?
Soon. Next month.
- Are you going to stay here?
- No, I don't think so.
Decided where you're gonna go?
I've been looking for a job in the private sector, but it's...
It's very hard. My name's been in the papers too much.
You know, one thing I'm just still not completely clear about?
When you handed out the money, how did that work, exactly?
Badly.
I think what Bob means is, that ordinarily, what was the procedure?
Routine. I'd call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department.
He'd say, "Go ahead, give out the money".
This was all done verbally?
Yes.
Okay, we know there were five men who controlled the slush fund.
Mitchell, Stans, and Magruder.
Yeah, those three we've got. And all three have been named by two sources.
What about the other two?
- Kalmbach.
- We're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
Maybe we better wait until we get all five, huh?
Certain on Mitchell?
We know that he approved payments to
Liddy while he was Attorney General.
- You've got more than one source?
- Yes, Harry.
- Who are they?
- Sloan.
Sloan and who else?
There's another guy at Justice who so far won't confirm... the names of the others who control the fund. We're working on it.
- What about Deep Throat?
- He's not a source on this.
- But do any of them have an axe?
- No.
Personal, political, sexual.
- Is there anything at all on Mitchell?
- No.
- Then can we use their names?
- No.
God damn it! When is somebody gonna go on the record in this story?
You guys are about to write a story that says the former Attorney General... the highest ranking law enforcement officer in this country is a crook!
Just be sure you're right.
- Essex House, may I help you?
- John Mitchell.
Yes?
Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post... and I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour.
Tomorrow we're running a story in the paper... and we just think that you should have a chance to comment on it.
What does it say?
"John N. Mitchell, while serving...
"as United States Attorney General...
"personally controlled a secret cash fund...
"that was used to gather information about the Democrats...
- "according to"...
- Jesus.
"...sources involved in the Watergate investigation".
- Jesus.
- "Beginning in the spring of 1971...
"almost a year before he left the Justice Department...
"to become President
Nixon's campaign manager...
"on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund".
All that crap. You're putting it in the paper?
- Well...
- It's all been denied.
You tell your publisher, tell Katie Graham...
she's going to get her tit caught in the big ringer if that's published.
Christ, that's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Sir, I was just wondering if
I could ask you some questions?
- What time is it?
- It's 11:30, sir.
11:30? Is it morning or night?
It's 11:30 at night, sir.
Sir, the Committee to Re-Elect has issued a statement to our story... but there are just a couple of questions...
Did the Committee tell you to go ahead and publish the story?
You fellows have got a great ballgame going.
As soon as you're done, we're going to do a story on all of you.
Sir, there's just a couple of questions...
Call my law office in the morning.
There's no question you properly identified yourself?
He said it right off the top.
Mitchell know he was talking to a reporter?
Yeah, but I think I woke him up.
- Get good notes?
- Verbatim.
He really said that about Mrs. Graham?
Well, I'd cut the words
"her tit" and print it.
Why?
This is a family newspaper.
You know, once when I was reporting...
Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word.
They were looking for a successor for J. Edgar Hoover.
I wrote it and the day it appeared,
Johnson held a press conference... and appointed Hoover head of the FBI for life.
When he was done, he turned to his top guy... and the President said,
"Call Ben Bradlee and tell him, 'Fuck you' ".
Then everybody said, "You did it, Ben. You screwed up.
"You stuck us with Hoover forever".
I screwed up, but I wasn't wrong.
How much can you tell me about Deep Throat?
How much do you need to know?
Do you trust him?
Yeah.
I can't do the reporting for my reporters which means I have to trust them.
And I hate trusting anybody.
Run that, baby.
The Washington Post reported that while still in office as Attorney General...
John Mitchell had personally controlled a secret Republican fund.
Mitchell denied any such involvement and called the story ludicrous.
The new charge also brought a response from Vice President Agnew...
at his stop in Tampa.
I have full confidence in Mr. Mitchell...
and in the people in the
Republican organization.
And I think that that kind of unattributed report...
at a time like this is counterproductive.
We must bear in mind that those who published it...
have already shown their sympathy for the other ticket.
A band and some young cheerleaders...
All non-denial denials.
They doubt our ancestry, but they don't say the story isn't accurate.
I mean, did you understand one thing he was saying?
What I can't figure out is, what is a real denial?
Well, if they start calling us goddamn liars, we better start circling the wagons.
When do you think they'll start doing that?
When they get out of Tampa.
Joe, come on. What's going on with you guys at the FBI?
I've been trying to get to you for weeks.
Your secretary says you're not in.
Last night I called, you said you couldn't talk... and this morning, as soon as our
Mitchell story hits the stands... you call me and say you've got to see me right away. Why?
Look, you guys have been causing big trouble at the Bureau.
Why?
Our reports are showing up in your paper almost verbatim.
I mean, you've really been on the mark, except for Mitchell.
Now, we didn't have that...
- that he controlled the funds.
- Right.
Our agents have been busting ass... but we're gonna go back now and see if we've missed anything.
What I don't understand is all the people... who might know details of the bugging operation... the FBI hasn't even talked to.
And why have you conducted your interviews of CREEP personnel... at CREEP headquarters... instead of at their homes where they might feel freer to talk?
Joe, wait a minute.
Why have the interviews at
CREEP always been conducted... within the presence of the lawyer who works for CREEP?
Look, you know I can't answer for the whole Bureau.
- Oh, come on, I'm just...
- I do what I'm told.
I followed my orders. Period.
What orders?
Wait. Woodward!
Wait!
Bob!
Out of the blue. Out of the blue.
Okay, this morning I get a tip to call a guy by the name of Alex Shipley... who is now the Assistant
Attorney General of Tennessee.
Now, the guy told me, that called me, that said...
He said that Shipley was asked in the summer of 1971... by an old army buddy, a Donald Segretti... to join a group of other lawyers... for Nixon's campaign to sabotage the Democratic candidates.
Listen, make a left when you can. We'll go to my place.
Sabotage Democratic candidates?
That's right. Now, I was able to make a couple of calls today...
and I got Segretti's records for the year...
His travel records for the years 1971
Does the FBI know about...
- Did you say left or right?
- Left!
We're going to my place. We gotta go over the records.
- Does the FBI know about Segretti?
- The FBI interrogated Segretti... and found out he wasn't involved in the break-in so they dropped it.
They didn't follow through on it.
- Where is he?
- He's in California.
- Jesus, look at this.
- What?
Segretti crisscrossed the country at least a dozen times.
He only stayed in cities where there were Democratic primaries.
Well, if the break-in is just one incident in a campaign of sabotage... that began a whole year before Watergate... then for the first time, the break-in makes sense.
This isn't so crazy.
This thing didn't start with the bugging at the headquarters.
Segretti was doing this a year before the bugging.
And a year before, Nixon wasn't slaughtering Muskie.
He was running behind Muskie, before Muskie self-destructed.
If he self-destructed.
- Hi. Donald Segretti?
- That's right.
I'm Carl Bernstein from the Washington Post.
Hi.
What can I do for you?
Well, my paper just sent me out here to try to persuade you to go on the record.
Why me?
I guess because you were the head coordinator... of Nixon's sabotage campaign against the Democrats.
- Carl, you want some coffee?
- You read my mind.
Carl, tell me something.
What do you imagine the head coordinator does?
Well, I guess basically you're involved in recruiting other people like yourself... other lawyers.
- Lawyers?
- Like Alex Shipley.
I made it clear that I would not do anything violent or illegal.
What do you mean by illegal?
Watergate, I mean, that's... The whole bugging. That's horrendous!
And what kind of stuff do you guys do then?
Nickel-and-dime stuff.
Stuff. Stuff with a little wit attached to it.
You mean, when you sent out on Muskie's stationery that...
Senator Hubert Humphrey was going out with call girls?
Listen, if anything, it helped the man's image.
What was the one on Muskie's stationery that you sent out... that said that Scoop Jackson was having a bastard child?
So, sometimes it got up to a quarter. Off the record.
I think one of the most interesting ones was the Canuck letter.
What about it?
Come on. Where you claimed that
Muskie slurred the Canadians.
No, I didn't write that.
Do you know who did?
Carl, when you guys print it in the papers, then I'll know.
Smart guy, Donald.
You're no dummy.
I'm a lawyer, Carl.
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer... and I'll probably wind up going to jail and being disbarred... and I don't know what I did that was so goddamn awful.
I'll tell you something.
None of this was my idea.
I didn't go looking for the job.
Well, that's important.
Chapin came to you.
You know what?
It's funny, but I keep forgetting that you guys knew each other in college.
You were friends at SC, you and Chapin. Who else was there?
There was me...
Dwight...
Ziegler... all the USC mafia.
And that's when you got involved in meaningless student elections...
when you start to try to get your man in so you stuffed ballot boxes and...
What's that term you guys use for screwing up the opposition?
- Rat-fucking.
- That's right.
You were just doing the same kind of stuff... when you were out campaigning for President Nixon.
Let me tell you something, we did a lot of worse things in college.
Look, let me ask you something, Carl.
What would you have done if you were just getting out of the army... been away from the real world for four years... didn't know what kind of law you wanted to practice... and one day you get a call from an old friend... asking if you want to go to work for the President of the United States?
Chapin was the appointment secretary for Nixon when he called.
Yeah. Listen, if those sinister things really happened...
I don't think Dwight knew anything about them.
He just did what he was told.
Told by who?
What's the topic for tonight?
Rat-fucking.
In my day it was simply known as the double-cross.
In our present context... it means infiltration of the Democrats.
Segretti won't go on the record... but if he would, we know he would implicate Chapin.
And that would put you inside the White House.
Who?
Be specific.
How high up?
You'll have to find that out for yourself.
I don't like newspapers.
I don't care for inexactitude... and shallowness.
The CREEP slush fund that financed the rat-fucking... we've just about got that nailed down. I don't know how...
Did you change cabs?
Yeah.
Does the FBI know what we know?
Does Justice?
Why haven't they done anything?
If it didn't deal directly with the break-in, they didn't pursue.
Who told them not to?
Don't you understand what you're on to?
- Mitchell knew?
- Of course Mitchell knew.
Do you think something this size just happens?
Haldeman had to know, too.
You'll get nothing from me about Haldeman.
Segretti said that...
Don't concentrate on Segretti.
You'll miss the overall.
The letter that destroyed the Muskie candidacy... the Canuck letter, did that come from inside the White...
You're missing the overall.
But what overall?
They were frightened of Muskie, and look who got destroyed.
They wanted to run against McGovern.
Look who they're running against.
They bugged, they followed people... false press leaks, fake letters.
They canceled Democratic campaign rallies.
They investigated
Democratic private lives.
They planted spies, stole documents, and on and on.
Now, don't tell me you think this is all the work of little Don Segretti.
The FBI and Justice know this?
- Carl?
- Yeah.
Why don't you pick up your messages more often?
- Right. You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.
Who's Pete Teller?
I haven't the slightest idea, Carl. I have this whole place to take care of.
- Carl?
- Yeah, one second.
Tell him to leave his phone number next time, all right? Hi, Sally.
Listen, do you guys know about the Canuck letter?
Yep. I'm sorry, I'm late.
I just wanted to make sure you knew who wrote it.
What?
You mean the letter that sabotaged the Muskie candidacy?
All right, come here.
When did he tell you this?
Gotta tell Bob.
- Woodward.
- What?
One second. Very important... Come here.
Tell him what you told me.
Here, sit down.
Just exactly the way you said it to me, say it to him.
Ken Clawson told me he wrote the Canuck letter.
The letter that said Muskie was slurring the Canadians.
Clawson?
The Deputy Director of White House
Communications wrote the Canuck letter.
- When did he tell you this?
- When we were having drinks.
- Where were you?
- My apartment.
- When did you say he told you?
- Two weeks ago.
What else did he say?
He didn't say anything?
Come on, you're hedging.
You think he said it to impress you to get you to go to bed with him?
- Jesus.
- No, I want to hear her say it.
Do you think he said that to impress you, try to get you to go to bed with him?
Why did it take you two weeks to tell us this, Sally?
I guess I don't have the taste for the jugular you guys have.
You're claiming it was all a misunderstanding?
Absolutely. Sally's got it all wrong.
I never told her that
I wrote that letter.
We were just shooting the breeze about the election.
She's an awfully good reporter.
I don't remember her getting that much wrong before, do you?
Look, that's a real bullshit question, Woodward.
That is a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Listen. One last thing.
Do you remember where this shooting the breeze took place?
What do you mean, where?
I mean, was it a restaurant, or her apartment, or a bar?
Now, look. I'd forgotten the entire incident...
but it most certainly wasn't in her apartment.
- Do you remember when it took place?
- I don't have time for this. I'm a busy man.
Did you get all that?
What did he say about meeting in a bar or restaurant?
He said he forgot the entire incident.
- That means he didn't deny it.
- That's a non-denial denial.
Wichita, Kansas?
Yeah, he said that's a bullshit question, Woodward...
I know what he said. But
I'm from Wheaton, Illinois.
Hey, Bob, Carl. He's on the phone.
- Who?
- Clawson.
Get over there on line 4 and transcribe this, will you? Four.
- Four?
- Okay. Yeah.
Yes, Ken.
Sally, for Christ's sakes, don't tell them I came to your place.
Why not? What's wrong with coming over for a drink?
You and me? In your apartment?
Well?
Jesus Christ, you just shot me down.
If that appears in the papers that
I'm over at your house, having...
- Do you know what that does?
- No, I don't see why.
You don't? You don't?
- There's nothing bad about it.
- Well, there sure is.
This is just incredible.
Well, I have a clear conscience.
Sally, I have a wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat.
She said that he was in her house having drinks.
Now, look, I don't care where it happened. What happened is what counts.
When we asked him about it, he said he forgot the entire incident.
- Yeah?
- Ken Clawson on the line.
- Ken Clawson on the line.
- Jesus.
Ken. What's up, kid?
Ben, now, look, this whole thing that's going on over there, Ben...
I want you to know that I never claimed authorship of the Canuck letter!
Says he never wrote the letter.
It's some kind of misunderstanding, a confusion, I want you to know...
Slow down, Ken. You sound frazzled.
Now, Ben, please, listen.
If you're going to refer to that alleged conversation with Sally Aiken...
you can't print that it took place in her apartment.
I have a wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat.
"A wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat".
Right, Ken, right. Yeah.
Now, Ken, I don't want to print that you were in Sally's apartment.
Thank God.
I just want to know what you said in Sally's apartment.
- Hello.
- Bernstein...
I just got a tip from our FBI source.
The secret cash fund financed Segretti.
- Jesus.
- All right. Now, listen.
Chapin hired Segretti, we know that.
And we know Haldeman hired Chapin.
Haldeman has to be the fifth name to control the fund.
Sloan knows.
We've only got four out of the five who controlled the fund.
It has to be Haldeman.
I don't think we've got it.
We know the fifth is a top White House official.
But no one has said it.
No one has named Haldeman.
- No one's denied it.
- That still doesn't prove it was Haldeman.
If you go to bed at night and there's no snow on the ground... when you wake up and there's snow on the ground... you can say it snowed during the night, although you didn't see it.
But if we can't prove the fifth man is Haldeman, we're wiped out.
Everything in that campaign is done with his approval.
We know that everybody who works under Haldeman... does so with his knowledge.
And everybody is under
Haldeman, except the President.
Common sense says it's Haldeman.
If we go and see Sloan...
and we tell him that we know that he named Haldeman to the Grand Jury...
Then all we would need to do is have him confirm it.
Right.
- Want to do it that way?
- Yes.
Let's go back and see Sloan.
We can't go now 'cause he's not home yet.
He may not be answering, but he might be there.
- Hi.
- Please.
Listen, we've already written the story. We just need you to define...
Deborah's in the hospital and my in-laws are coming...
- Two questions?
- We understand.
Two questions?
The cash that financed the Watergate break-in... five men had control of the fund.
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach.
We have confirmations on those four.
- We just found out Haldeman's the fifth.
- I'm not your source on that.
We're not asking you to be our source.
All we're asking is to confirm it.
I'm not your source on Haldeman.
Okay, look, when you were questioned by the Grand Jury...
You had to name names.
- Of course, everything they asked, yes.
- Lf they asked you. All right if they...
I don't know... Say we wrote a story that said that Haldeman... was the fifth name to control the fund.
- Would we be in any trouble?
- Would we be wrong?
Let me put it this way.
I would have no problems if you wrote a story like that.
- You wouldn't?
- No.
- That's okay. Yeah.
- Okay.
- Oh, you had a baby.
- Yes, my wife did.
- Little boy or girl?
- That's terrific.
It's a girl.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- We're sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.
- Will you give our best to her?
- I will.
Well, I think that, Woodward, and I am curious of the fact...
that the FBI, in its entire inquiry, never talked to the...
Or did any inquiries into the second most-powerful man to the President.
You don't seem to understand.
No, you get nothing about Haldeman out of me.
But we don't need to know anything, Joe.
Tomorrow we're going with a story on the FBI.
Now, what does that mean?
And we're going to establish in that story... that you guys just about blew the whole investigation.
Oh, no, we didn't miss so much.
You didn't know Haldeman had control of the slush fund?
Oh, yes, we did. It's all in our files.
- Not about Haldeman.
- Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman.
Look, now, look, I'm very busy.
I've got to go put the kids to bed.
That's the confirmation right there.
Wait a minute, wait a sec. Did he say John?
- He said Haldeman.
- He said John Haldeman.
What the hell difference does it make if he said Isaiah or David?
There's only one Haldeman.
Yeah, well, Isaiah or David aren't assistants to the President.
I don't know, it still feels thin.
Christ, I just wish we knew if we could print this.
Now wait a minute, we didn't make them do these things... but once they did, they're fair game!
Harry, let's go over your sources again. I want to hear it.
Sloan told the Grand Jury. He answered everything they asked him.
That means there's gotta be a record somewhere.
He told the Grand Jury, the FBI confirms. What more do you need?
I happen to love this country.
You know, we're not a bunch of zanies out to bring it down!
Harry, weren't you arguing the opposite way?
No, not at all.
All right, now hold it.
One thing has nothing to do with the other.
We're about to accuse Haldeman who only happens to be... the second-most-important man in this country... of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House.
It would be nice if we were right.
- Have you double-checked your sources? - Jesus.
- Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
- Absolutely!
- Woodward?
- I'm sure.
I'm not. It still seems thin.
Get another source.
How many fucking sources do they think we've got?
- Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm?
- He won't confirm, I told you that.
What about the guy in Justice?
You can't call him. He's right next to the Grand Jury.
- We have no choice. It's trouble.
- It's 20 minutes to deadline.
I don't even know if I can get him on the phone.
- Dr. Kissinger's office.
- Deputy General's office, please.
Do you know when you expect him back?
No, sir. I believe he's left for the evening.
If you'd like to leave a message...
Oh, could you hold, please?
Hi, this is Carl. I'm sorry to disturb you now... but we're going with the story that Haldeman was the fifth man... in control of the fund and they're hassling us here.
We've got three confirmations. If you could help us, I'd appreciate it.
I won't say anything about Haldeman. Not ever.
I understand. We wouldn't want you to do that.
We know it's against the law for you to say anything.
If there's a way you could warn us to hold on the story, we'd appreciate it.
I'd really like to help you, but I can't.
Look, I'm going to count to 10, all right?
If there's any reason we should hold on the story... hang up the phone before I get to 10.
If the story's all right, you just be on the phone after I get to 10, all right?
- Hang up, right?
- That's right.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
We're straight. All right, I'm going to start counting, okay?
- We all right?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'm counting.
One, two... three, four, five... six, seven... eight, nine, ten.
You got it straight now? Everything okay?
Everything's fine.
Woodward!
We got it.
- He confirmed.
- What happened?
I said if I get up to 10 and you don't hang up, it's solid.
- Did he confirm it?
- Absolutely.
We've got to tell Bradlee!
Bernstein got another source.
The guy at Justice confirmed.
If there's any doubt, we can run it tomorrow.
You don't have to. The story's solid. We're sure of it.
I just got off the phone with him. It's gold.
Okay, we go with it.
Woodstein!
- You know what it's about?
- No.
Sloan, who resigned as campaign treasurer...
after the Watergate break-in...
showed up for a deposition in the common-cause suit on...
disclosure of campaign contributions, and denied naming Haldeman.
Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment on testimony before the Grand Jury?
I'd like my attorney to answer that question.
Gentlemen, the answer is an unequivocal "no".
Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr.
Haldeman in that testimony at all.
It is in his testimony that
Mr. Sloan acknowledged...
- that it was an espionage fund?
- No, not at all.
Did he mention any use of funds for espionage activity?
None, whatsoever. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.
Sloan expanded his denial to include his statements to the FBI...
and to all federal authorities. A short time later at the White House...
News Secretary Ronald Ziegler delivered a strong attack...
on the Washington Post.
Why is the Post trying to do it? You have a man...
who is the editor of the Washington
Post by the name of Ben Bradlee.
I think anyone who would want to honestly assess...
what his political persuasions are, would...
I think come to the conclusion, quite quickly...
that he is not a supporter of President Nixon.
I respect the free press.
I don't respect the type of journalism...
the shabby journalism that is being practiced by the Washington Post.
All I know is that the story that ran this morning...
is incorrect and it's been so...
stated as being incorrect...
by not only me, but by the individual...
whose Grand Jury, secret
Grand Jury testimony...
they based their story on.
And that individual has denied that he ever so testified.
No sooner had Ziegler finished, than the President's campaign manager...
Clark MacGregor, met with reporters.
Using innuendo...
third-person hearsay...
unsubstantiated charges, anonymous sources...
and huge, scare headlines...
the Post has maliciously sought to give the appearance...
of a direct connection between the White House and the Watergate.
A charge which the Post knows...
and half a dozen investigations have found to be false.
The hallmark of the Post campaign is hypocrisy...
and its celebrated double standard is today visible for all to see.
I'm not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.
- Then what went wrong?
- Nothing.
Just tell us what went wrong?
Didn't you say that the FBI had the information on Haldeman in the files?
- No.
- Because we have it in the notes... from the conversation we had on the telephone right here.
We have to go talk to your boss if you don't talk to us.
What the hell are you talking about? I'll deny everything.
We're not trying to get anybody into trouble.
We're just trying to find out if we made some errors.
If we made a mistake, then we'll come off the story.
Just tell us if we're wrong.
Tell us if we screwed up.
I'm not talking about it.
I am not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.
In fact, I can't even be seen talking to either one of you bastards.
- What are you afraid of? Who got to you?
- Are we being set up?
- Are we, Joe? Tell us!
- Are we being set up?
- Just tell us, we won't print it.
- Fuck you.
And fuck you!
Honest to God, I just don't know.
- Oh, I see.
- It's in the notes!
Yeah, we had another call on a long list and I've got another call, I've gotta go.
- Did you mean Bob Haldeman?
- Yeah, Bob Haldeman.
Jesus, what was our mistake?
Maybe there was no mistake.
Then they're just setting us up.
Then the whole thing was a set-up?
And they just hung us.
More denunciations. You'll have to make a statement, Ben.
One senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
I knew we had enemies, but I didn't know we were this popular.
Wow, look at this.
My non-denial denial.
Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.
Okay. Foreign?
All right, here's our headline.
Radio Hanoi reports the United
States-North Vietnam agreement... for a settlement of the Vietnam War.
Woodward, what did you find out? What'd he say?
What time is it?
- You fell asleep?
- God damn it!
Over here.
You let Haldeman slip away.
Yes.
You've done worse than let Haldeman slip away.
You've got people feeling sorry for him. I didn't think that was possible.
In a conspiracy like this... you build from the outer edges and you go step by step.
If you shoot too high and miss, everybody feels more secure.
- You put the investigation back months.
- Yes, we know that.
And if we're wrong, we're resigning.
Were we wrong?
You'll have to find that out, won't you?
Listen, I'm tired of your chicken-shit games!
I don't want hints.
I need to know what you know.
It was a Haldeman operation.
The whole business was run by
Haldeman, the money, everything.
It won't be easy getting at him. He was insulated. You'll have to find out how.
Mitchell started doing covert stuff before anyone else.
The list is longer than anyone can imagine.
It involves the entire U.S.
Intelligence community...
FBI...
CIA, Justice. It's incredible.
The cover-up had little to do with Watergate.
It was mainly to protect the covert operations.
It leads everywhere.
Get out your notebook. There's more.
Your lives are in danger.
Hi, I finally got Sloan on the phone.
Why the hell didn't you tell me over the phone?
- Woodward says phones aren't safe.
- Can't trust them.
- Come on in.
- We can't come in, sir.
Woodward says there's electronic surveillance.
- Surveillance? Who's doing it?
- It's being done.
People's lives are in danger. Maybe even ours.
What happened to that
Justice source of yours?
I guess I made the instructions too complicated.
Because he thought I said "hang up" when I just said "hang on".
- Oh, Jesus!
- The story is right.
Haldeman was the fifth name to control that fund...
- and Sloan would've told the Grand Jury.
- Sloan wanted to tell the Jury.
- Why didn't he?
- Because nobody asked.
Nobody asked him.
The cover-up had little to do with the break-in.
It was to protect covert operations and the covert activities... involving the entire U.S.
Intelligence community.
Did Deep Throat say that people's lives are in danger?
Yes.
- What else did he say?
- He said everyone is involved.
You know the results of the latest Gallup Poll?
Half the country never even heard of the word "Watergate".
Nobody gives a shit.
You guys are probably pretty tired, right?
You should be. Go on home.
Get a nice hot bath, rest up 15 minutes... then get your asses back in gear.
We're under a lot of pressure, you know, and you put us there.
Nothing's riding on this except the
First Amendment of the Constitution... freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country.
Not that any of that matters... but if you guys fuck up again, I'm going to get mad.
Goodnight.
And now, fellow Americans...
the Honorable Chief Justice will administer the oath of office...
to the President of the
United States of America.
Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. President, are you ready to take the constitutional oath?
If you will place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand...
and please repeat after me. "I,
Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...
"I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...
"...that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States...
"...that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States...
- "...and will, to the best of my ability...
- "...and will, to the best of my ability...
"...preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States...
"...preserve and protect and defend the Constitution of the United States...
- "...so help me, God".
- "...so help me, God".
Thanks. Here are the keys.
What?
God damn it! Come on!
You're at a party, damn it!
Sheila, come on back!
Where the hell are you going?
- Sorry, Marty.
- No, she's all right.
He was my friend. No, he was my friend.
But he was a nice man.
- I don't want it now.
- Are you all right?
Guess what?
Your father has had his body defrosted into life, and he wants this house back.
Almost.
Clinton requests our attendance on his yacht for a week.
No kidding?
- Oh, God. Could it be?
- I wouldn't count on it.
No, I think he's just bored and wants to play parlor games.
- But we'll go anyway.
- Ever the dreamer.
- Give me a sip of that.
- It's ginger ale. Do you want one?
Write something new.
Forget Freak Show.
Clinton's never gonna produce it.
And he's never going to give it back to you.
Probably.
Okay. Who else besides me?
Both of them or just him? That's good.
No way. Yeah, well, who else is coming?
That's different. Of course I'll come.
We've been dying to sign her for months.
Hello? It's a bad connection here.
I said I have been dying to see you for months!
Listen, what about Bridey Murphy?
Is she coming?
What do you mean, what do I mean?
This is the same B-group that was at your house... the night Sheila got bounced through the hedges.
Yeah, well, I'm giving it to Joyce Haber:
"Clinton Green's Anniversary Wake."
That's what I said. It's not right for Haber.
We'll just keep it our secret instead.
I loved your... That's a piece of dreck.
I loved your wire and I can't wait to see you, really.
I've lost 50 pounds. I'm a hollow reed.
Kiss, kiss.
Call Haber and give her the dish.
Disguise your voice as a woman.
"My year of mourning being over."
Is he kidding?
I mean, we went directly to Streisand's opening at The Sands... right from the cemetery.
Get me Freddie, will you?
Freddie, I want to go to South France, honey.
Settle down, please, everyone!
Thank you. Now, girls, shall we try?
Big smiles, everyone.
- Britain's best bow-wows...
- Bark...
For Buffers.
- Very good...
- Phone, Mr. Dexter. It's your wife.
Yes, darling?
From whom?
Oh, good God!
- Bark!
- When?
Very good. Send a confirming telegram from both of us.
Very well, then, from me.
Darling, I must hang up now.
One of my cast is peeing on my leg.
Something Garbo never did, even at her moodiest.
Bye, now.
Sorry.
All right, everyone off. Once again, please.
Now animation. Wave the little tins.
Ready. Go!
- You ready, darling?
- Yes.
- Ready, gentlemen?
- Ready!
- Do you enjoy Rome?
- Do I!
- I enjoy Rome for countless reasons.
- Why do you leave?
I've just finished my picture starring Kirk Douglas and I'm exhausted.
- And the heat.
- Where do you go?
For a week on the yacht of a famous producer.
I'm not afraid. My husband will be there to protect me.
But I'm afraid our plane will leave without us.
If you gentlemen will excuse us.
No, grazie.
No!
He didn't mean anything...
You don't do commercials for liquor companies.
Why can't we just go on a vacation like normal people?
Let's board.
I don't want to leave the luggage, and I ain't carrying it three feet.
- Is your back okay?
- Yeah, so far.
I pray it stays that way and that Clinton stays in a good mood.
Where is everybody?
You don't think they're below playing sardines or something, do you?
I'll bet Clinton's got games planned for every day.
Just as long as he sticks to the days and leaves us some nights for ourselves.
Hey! Tommy! Lee!
It's a mistake!
What do you think, gang?
Thrilled, pleased, disappointed?
It's fabulous, Clinton.
I didn't know you were coming.
- You're thrilled about it.
- I'm delighted.
Clinton can take his frustrations out on you.
But he's always sorry after it.
- How are you, Tom?
- Hey, C.G.
- Tom, how was your flight?
- Flight was good.
All right, people. Let's line up by the prow.
- What is this, a pogrom?
- Now, come on.
- When do you wish to sail, Signor Green?
- When do I wish to sail?
Let's get out of this joint tout de suite.
All right, gang, let's line up right here.
Husbands and wives separate.
Lee, between Alice and Anthony.
Right in here.
Philip, you there. Christine.
Tom, on the other side of Christine.
Left profile, darling.
He's Italian.
I took the wrong three weeks of Berlitz.
All I know is scusi and pronto.
Pronto will be enough.
All right, let's smile, or whatever you people do for a living.
Take that hat off, Christine.
All right, now squeeze in close.
Come on. Squeeze in close or you'll be out of the picture.
And I don't mean this one.
Perfect!
A study of six hungry failures.
Just kidding, gang.
He'll watch his mouth when you sign with me. When is lunch?
Come on, people.
Vittorio will show you to your cabin.
I hate my luggage more than life.
- Whose is this?
- That's ours.
Vuitton from rewriting spaghetti westerns?
- What's Vuitton?
- Good.
Who did this room, Parker Brothers?
Sometimes it rains.
- What's the scoreboard for?
- That's for later.
Sorry.
That's all right. That's what they're for.
It's only Sheila's favorite.
All right. Everybody... down to the latrines for a shave, shower, or douche, depending on your hang-up.
I think it's fabulous, Clinton.
This is the bathroom.
- You like it?
- It's really beautiful.
What period would you say it was, Clinton?
Louis XXXIV.
Come on, gang, let's get this show on the road.
It's fabulous, Clinton. Absolutely fabulous.
- It's like your mother's.
- It's like our maid's.
Tom, Lee, you have to share a john.
Get to know each other.
- Philip.
- Come on, love, let's try it out.
- What's for me, something special?
- Yes.
Can't wait to see it.
I love it! But where does the crew sleep?
Alice and Anthony got the double because he didn't want her sulking for six days.
- And because he knew you wouldn't sulk.
- Everything with Clinton is points.
Understand? Points.
- Do you understand?
- Too well.
I don't mind Clinton, you know.
I just don't want him running our lives.
Wonderful. Anthony and Alice have brought their cassette player.
- Bottled water?
- Cabin-o five-o, capice?
Nice little ass, but I think he's afraid of me.
Now, what do you think we're doing here?
- You're here, too.
- Clinton's project.
Which is?
He's been hinting about making a picture on the life and death of Sheila Green.
- That is truly bizarre.
- No, not really.
She's still a compulsive subject with Clinton.
But he never really cared about her.
Yes, he did. He cared about her very much.
He cared a lot about her
Arizona real estate holdings... which we are sailing on right now.
Finding the guy who hit her is just another game with Clinton.
Absolutely. But what a game.
And now Tom gets to write it,
Philip gets to direct it... and what's her face...
I mean my new client, Miss Alice Wood... gets to thrill you as Sheila Green, who rose from call girl to columnist.
Listen, just do me this.
Minutes from now, when Clinton talks about this, and he will, just be surprised.
Well, I'm thinking of calling it...
Don't be shocked now.
The Last of Sheila.
Fox and Paramount are interested.
It's the perfect woman's picture.
Every bit as big as Love Story.
Except she never gets to play that good hospital scene.
I think it's the picture we've been waiting for.
If we're available, of course.
Provided they're not opening a new shopping center in Anaheim, you will be.
Two hours to game time, gang.
Let me describe the week's entertainment for you.
The last time I played a game was charades...
At my house, the night Sheila was killed.
- As a matter of fact, everyone here was...
- Was there.
Except Lee. You were home sick in Santa Barbara, you said.
No, I was home, sick of Santa Barbara, I said.
I like any game where you don't have to move.
Well, you don't have to for this one if you're smart enough.
- Meaning?
- Well, it's sort of...
I call it "The Sheila Green
Memorial Gossip Game."
- Sounds fascinating.
- And I haven't even described it yet.
- I couldn't. I'm stuffed.
- Now, I've dreamed up odds...
- Can't you take a joke? Come here.
- Pay attention, please.
I dreamed up six secrets, one for each of you.
Six little pretend pieces of gossip.
Now keep them secret.
Give me.
- Can we look at them?
- It'll help.
How do you think these things up?
"This one's only taken me a month to prepare, he said modestly."
- It's marvelous.
- It's what I've always wanted to be.
It says, "You are a snoop."
No, don't throw it away. Keep them till Saturday. And don't show them.
Anybody who wants to peek at mine gets a kiss.
What's the game?
The idea is to discover everybody's secret.
Without peeking, of course.
And prevent the others from discovering yours.
And how do we do that?
Every day, we'll park in a different port... where you can discover the proof of one person's secret.
I'll announce what secret it is to look for and give you a clue... which will tell you what to do and where to go on shore.
Now, if you solve the clue properly, it'll lead you to where the proof is.
Suppose you announce, let's say, "pyromaniac."
Let's say that's my secret.
Why should I bother looking for the proof?
Because when the person whose secret it is discovers the proof...
I'll put a card out saying the game for that evening is over.
And those who haven't found it don't score, right?
Right. If you could direct as fast as you catch on to games... you'd never be a has-been again.
- What do we get if we win?
- Better billing.
Let's play!
According to the old pizza slinger that runs this tub for me... the launch will be back to pick you up at 7:00 p.m.
That's when you'll get your clue for this evening.
- For whom are we looking tonight?
- The person with the shoplifter card.
Vittorio!
All right, who's got the shoplifter card?
Come on. We're not gonna really do this, are we?
Run around this bombed-out backwater with a silver key up our tokhes?
It probably means that you're the shoplifter.
Is this the only clue we're gonna get?
- It must open a door somewhere.
- Brilliant.
It's a game.
I thought you were going to enjoy it.
Vittorio, honey, I wanna talk to you.
If we're playing...
Stop coming on to Vittorio, Christine.
He doesn't know what the key means any more than you do.
It's my secret!
Everybody got their key?
Vittorio will be back to pick you up again at 10:00 sharp.
Be on the docks by that time...
or you'll have to swim back to the boat through the oil slick and the beer cans.
And no conferring.
This is an individual competition.
Quit pouting, Alice.
You're having a terrific time.
Kill.
Don't hate me. I followed you.
I know it's against the rules, but we could knock this off together.
You know, actually, I speak a little frog.
- Christine.
- Just don't tell Clinton I did it, okay?
Look at this chintzy toast rack.
Maybe it's a letter holder.
What do you think?
I think Steve and Eydie would love it.
How much is it?
90 francs. What is that? 90 divided by five?
- Merci.
- Are you kidding? That is $18.
I think that's outrageous.
Where'd she go? Lee!
I'd very much like to be allowed to compare... this key with the keys of your rooms, if that's all right with you.
Lee, what did you find? Lee, wait for me!
- What did you find?
- I'll give you a hint.
The word in French for key is clet.
C-L-E-F. Get it?
Don't tell Clinton I told you, okay?
- I never saw that one before.
- She's probably a war baby.
I knew this hotel was an at-cay ouse-hay.
It's the same key that whore had on the corner.
Which corner, madam?
- Don't touch the dummy, dummy.
- Jesus.
Figure out what happened and get your buns out of here...
- before one of the other dodos comes in.
- All right.
Tick-tock.
Obviously, this is the shoplifter's room.
Everything still has a price tag on it.
Yawn.
And this is a detective whom he's killed.
And this bottle of perfume is a clue to the shoplifter's identity.
Do you move your lips when you read?
Perfume, scent, money.
No. French money is francs, not cents.
Chanel No. 5.
Very good, Clinton.
Where did you get the money?
Here are all the known photographs of the brutal shoplifter...
who has terrified the sniveling merchants of the Riviera for the past 20 years.
Here is the only headshot taken by Bruno of Hollywood.
Clinton, I'm dazzled! Closed circuit?
What did you think it was, black magic?
Is this it?
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- Don't get your hopes up, darling.
It's not our host, who's standing behind the door.
You go play pinball machines.
- Have fun.
- Now, now. See you at 10:00.
- You get it?
- Not yet.
I could give you a hint.
I want to figure this one out all by myself.
You seem a little worried. You okay?
I'm fine.
Go on, get out of here, you shoplifter.
Here is the only headshot taken by Bruno of Hollywood.
- I found the proof. What now?
- We get out of here.
Ketchup's beginning to attract silverfish.
- Don't hit me.
- No. Thank God you speak French.
Listen. Did you get fixed up with one of the go-go boys in there?
Are you kidding me?
I spent the last hour ditching guys... who thought I was offering them the key to my hotel room.
Hotel.
Fellows, I got the key. I knew it would...
Any of you guys belong to a '57 Dodge pickup truck?
Shit!
Not here, for God's sake.
Everybody's walking around. Listen.
I want to see you tonight.
I'd like to talk to you.
It's about this game.
I know we said we'd be careful... but I don't think anybody will be on the top deck. I mean late.
Hi, bunny.
You mean there's no such thing as 18-karat silver?
No, gold, my dear. Only gold.
If I'd been thinking more clearly...
I wouldn't have wasted 15 minutes in some masseuse's apartment... while she showed me her scrapbooks from World War II.
- Is it your back?
- Yes. All that running around.
All right, Brownie troop,
I just want to ask you two questions.
Who solved it, and how many?
- Didn't you, sweetie?
- No talking about the game.
I'll be more into it tomorrow night.
You'd better be, honey, or Sandra Dee will be playing Sheila.
- Terrific!
- Go tell them to turn it down.
Are you mad? I'm not gonna play housemother to those two.
- Alone at last.
- Not while Clinton's...
Good Lord. I was gonna say not while Clinton's on board... and it came out "not while Clinton's alive."
Boy, you don't forgive easy.
I've lived around Clintons all my life, starting with Daddy.
That same hearty way of bringing people to their knees...
- and then handing out little presents.
- Like this job.
- Why are you doing this?
- Come on.
She wants a bigger bed.
Point noted.
Come over here.
Let's forget Clinton for a while.
And starlight filled the corners of the room.
- You're an incurable romantic.
- It's curable.
I swear to God, I'm not. That's it.
- What's that all about?
- Turn off your questing mind for a while.
We went through a shuffle at the model agency, and I was broke.
Jean wasn't keeping me anymore, and I don't know... suddenly I just got this urge to take something, anything.
I told myself it was because I was broke... but really, it was just this urge.
So I ripped off a leopard coat.
Big brown buttons and slash pockets.
Poor thing. But, of course, I got caught.
"Would you please accompany me to the manager's office?" they said.
And you know who got me out of it?
No, scratch that.
We know how jealous you get, don't we?
Anyway, I got bailed out and nobody knew.
But nobody knew me then.
That's why I was so out of it tonight.
Clinton swore to me it was just a coincidence... but, you see, it's not just me.
Look, darling.
You see?
And I thought of you.
And I thought that Clinton's got something on each of us.
He's just mixed up the cards, that's all.
It's rotten.
But I'd like to know what the others are.
I wonder what he's got for Anthony.
That's the thing about secrets.
We all know stuff about each other.
We just don't know the same stuff.
How did he find out?
Sheila, probably.
Have you got the shoplifter card?
That would be ironic.
You won't tell.
What card do you have?
How will you get through this trip... without jumping on my bones and eating me alive?
What card do you have?
Please? Tell me.
Please.
Is she still upset?
- Talk about a body.
- Please don't.
She's looking upset again.
That's because she doesn't like games.
- She always loses.
- Will you stop it?
Why don't you go down the hall and get yourself a job?
You're so mean to me.
Isn't she mean to me?
Boo-hoo.
Jesus.
You started without me.
Lee, my darling, what are you doing out here at this ungodly hour?
Have I ever told you how sweet you were to me when I was a child?
Nothing could have been simpler.
I mean it.
At Daddy's legendary Sunday lunches.
I can still see you on Olivia de Havilland's lap.
It's funny, you know.
She was one of the few people... that Sheila ever had anything good to say about.
Couldn't you sleep?
Yes, if I took a Seconal, which I'd rather not do just yet.
Lord, I hope that Clinton really does intend to do this movie.
Tom has done nothing but rewrite jobs for so long now.
Need I tell you the two years we've tried living off Clinton's options on Freak Show.
Hardly paid for the pool maintenance?
If a glass of second-rate brandy at this hour... might excuse a certain tactlessness... why don't you dip into capital and produce your own picture?
Private finance is not that uncommon nowadays.
Can you imagine how Tom would feel about that?
Heigh-ho, gang.
Going over your hand signals for the bridge tournament?
How'd I feel about what?
If after a sudden blackout, we all discovered we were dead... as a result of some terrible crash and were on our way to the great beyond.
- With Clinton as God.
- Yes.
Give me a sip of that.
- It's bourbon.
- Right.
Well, I hear that calisthenics are at 8:00 sharp.
We wouldn't want to incur disfavor at this point, would we?
Good night.
He's a nice man.
Come on back down.
- I only had one.
- Don't worry about it.
Let's just get some sleep.
I'd kill myself for a hot bath.
Clinton has the only tub.
- You want one of these?
- I may not need it, Doctor.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
There's something going on.
I'm getting some strange vibes.
- I'm gonna have a talk with Clinton.
- At this hour?
He never sleeps, like Dracula.
He hasn't had a good eight hours since the night Sheila was killed.
Do you think we'll ever hear the last of Sheila?
Tommy, let's just make this movie, and put the money in mutual bonds... and go home.
Go to sleep, dear boy.
They'll give us conflicting reports about it in the morning.
Clinton, I've been thinking on the subject of managing Alice's career.
I mean, we do think of her career as our career. But still, my...
My aspirations do run closer to the production end of things... if you know what I mean.
Production, casting, et cetera.
What would you say, and please, be absolutely frank... to me asking you... for an associate producership on this upcoming film?
What would I say?
I would say...
"Boo-hoo."
There's nothing worse than a hustler with bad timing.
Crissy, put a little of this on my back, will you?
I'd really love to, but it would throw my schedule off.
I have to do 25 minutes on my front today.
To make up for the 25 minutes you spent on your back last night.
Honey, put some gunk on her back, will you? We don't want her to burn.
Anyhow, as I was saying, they shoot you full of these rhino tranqs... and then they wrap you in these hot sheets.
You wake up five days later about 30 pounds thinner... and screaming for hot turkey sandwiches.
I mean, it's...
- You listening to me?
- Kind of.
I'm here because I've got a client to keep and one to get. What's your excuse?
I'm trying to hold on to a husband who's trying to hold on.
With your money?
I like you best alone.
People have been telling me that for years.
You know that guy on the corner... who winds up his little mechanical men, and they run crazily around?
- I'm that guy.
- Oh, Clinton.
"Oh, Clinton," what?
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, what?
I'm sorry Anthony didn't handle that better.
Cut. Print.
Vittorio!
Christine, the crew are having their naps.
Jesus! Watts, Pakistan, and now naps for sailors?
Honey, would you drop me down a Tab?
My mouth is so dry I feel like they could shoot Lawrence of Arabia in it.
You know, Christine just said that her mouth is so dry...
- they could film Lawrence of Arabia in it.
- Right.
Tommy! Come on in.
Tell us about the rewrite you did on Fistful of Lasagna... or whatever the hell it was.
You never talk about your work.
Why is that?
Philip, listen. I've been mulling over the opening sequence.
What do you think?
We zoom in close on a sleeping bag... somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, right?
It's Sheila's mother in labor.
Think it'll play?
Sorry, Clinton, I didn't quite get that.
Shall we play what?
Jesus, go back to sleep, Lee.
Stand up, Christine!
I hope you were taking movies.
Where's your robe?
Get her a drink.
Look at me. I got a new hairstyle.
Get me a glass of water and a couple of lesbians.
Did you hear what I said?
My, that was limpy.
What's the matter with you people?
I'm so tired. I just have to take a nap now.
Wake me up when the credits are over.
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's all right.
Vittorio, God damn you, where are you?
All right! You listen.
You've got some explaining to do.
Don't you know enough not to turn those eggbeaters on... when we're ditching around out there?
This is a goddamn luxury cruise, not an obstacle course!
Look, I've been asking around, and none of us... was in sight of any of the others for just those few seconds.
- Alice claims to have been in her cabin.
- I was in the lounge with Guido.
- Lee was on the top deck.
- I was in my cabin.
According to the rules of the genre, we should now be looking for a motive.
Even Clinton could have climbed up the other ladder and started the engines.
Not pawing through my bag of tricks there, are you, Dad?
No, Clinton.
- Trying to get my attention?
- It's my back.
Don't you slip a disc.
No, don't answer that.
We don't want this topic to degenerate into the discussion phase.
Take a pill. Vittorio, get my friend two blue with the purple stripe.
- Maybe if I stayed out of tonight's game.
- Jesus, I'd really hate that.
But qué será. As long as you're ready for Saturday night, which is your biggie.
- Saturday?
- Yes.
You like it?
I love it.
Tiny islands fascinate my ass.
I've got this crazy broker in London... that sends me these brochures on all the islands for sale all over the world.
Little impoverished islands.
A few thousand dollars cash... and you're practically king to six shepherds and their families.
Or whatever.
I read every word on every island.
Then you know what I do?
I tear them neatly in half and drop them in the wastebasket.
Then I say to myself...
I'm still weak, Clinton, but I'm eating solid food.
I say to myself, "If there's one thing I hate, it's to have my island speech interrupted."
I say to myself:
"No, you poor people...
"you don't deserve a good king like me."
That's what I say.
Three hours to magic time. Bye-bye!
Heidi-ho, gamesters!
Everybody on the deck.
There they are.
It really touches me, the way you people humor me day after day.
Here they are, gang, your clues for this evening.
Read them and weep. Good work, Tom.
All right, the launch will be back to pick you up at 8:20 sharp. Be ready.
Hey, Clinton! Who are we looking for?
Tonight, the homosexual.
In a monastery?
Where else?
"The isle off the Church of Saint Pierre."
Shouldn't that... That must be "of." "O-F."
"This isle, now largely uninhabited by modest fisher folk...
"was once the domain...
"of the devastating monastery of forgotten men..."
- This must be a put-on, yeah?
- Clinton's fine Italian hand.
"Travelers engulf from many lands...
"to the site of this former 11th century refuge...
"of perverts, onanists, catamites...
"and other riffraff of the day."
We have just 15 minutes.
Just enough time for me to get dressed as a catamite, if I knew what it was.
Right.
Honey, I know this isn't the kind of junk you keep in your head, but...
But what?
Can you ever remember hearing any gossip about Alice being arrested?
For taking something from a shop.
I'm going to grab a quick shower before we take off. Just be a minute.
Okay?
Do you think there's a homosexual aboard the yacht?
God, I don't know.
Is there a dividing line today?
Don't patronize me.
Patronize? Is that the word you really mean?
- What's the matter now?
- I'm sorry.
- Is this game only a game?
- I'll be right out.
I'll be up on deck.
It's all rather like a Hammer film, isn't it?
He's got the sound department working overtime.
It's weird.
And I'm scared.
"In these ruins, monks' robes must be worn at all times...
"in respect for the departed brothers."
I fear it's to be a costume party.
"The evening tour commences at 9:00 p.m. and ends at 9:30 p.m., regardless.
"To begin before will enrage the spirit of Fra Pervertus.
"The vows of silence must be observed.
So keep..."
So keep what? What does it say?
I don't like that at all.
What time is it?
It begins.
That's Clinton.
- All we have to do is find him.
- Vows of silence.
It's the sound of music, for God's sake.
How are we supposed to know which place to look for him?
We're wasting time.
Clinton, what am I supposed to do?
Listen, I know it's you.
I heard you cough.
Now, the others there, they're on tape. Right?
That's disgusting.
- But clever.
- You'll ruin it.
You're supposed to be Alice, obviously.
And you're supposed to be on the other side, so I can use the slider.
- Much more effective but the door's stuck.
- God damn it!
How'd you find me so fast?
That "isle off the church" pun in the brochure.
- Not up to par, Your Eminence.
- I'll fix the door.
They must have loused it up when they moved it.
- Can I help?
- No, just piss off... my son.
God damn you!
For shame.
Damn.
Wanna kiss me?
You could do with a little more rouge.
- Is the volume too high out there?
- Too low, if anything.
Shit, nothing's going right.
Maybe if I open the door to the chapel a little wider?
Ollie, Ollie, oxen free!
Just give us the news, please.
Come out, wherever you are.
Am I the first?
What do I do now?
Clinton, don't leave me.
I hate being scared.
Scared.
Then Alice has the homosexual card.
Just keep your voice down and get the hell out of here.
Clinton, this is just the best game
I've ever played.
Darling, it's brilliant. It's really brilliant.
Hello?
Clinton? Is somebody there?
What's going on?
That's not fair. Clinton, you can't do that.
Vittorio thought that Guido had picked him up and vice versa.
But he's not in port, and he hasn't slept in his bed.
- It's part of the game. It's a clue.
- He hasn't filled in the scoreboard.
Maybe he's still romping around Dragonwyck.
Or perhaps lying in a box of earth with a stake through his heart.
He seemed edgy last night.
The door was stuck.
- The cassette wasn't loud enough. And...
- What door?
- The confessional...
- "Loose lips sink ships."
Who cares about the game at this point?
Something's flooey. Now, where is he?
That's funny.
Out! Just out!
Apparently, there is a God.
- Don't touch anything.
- I won't.
It must have been the storm.
Loosened the stone.
- What do we do with the ladies?
- Tell them to wait.
Shouldn't we notify the authorities?
On an island with two cafés and a weaver?
- Something's wrong.
- I hope you brought your fingerprint kit.
I see Clinton finally got this door open, breaking it in the process, as usual.
- Alice is sick.
- Oh, dear.
We're going back.
What?
A vital clue?
Clinton didn't smoke cigarettes.
There's no seaplane.
The police will arrive late tonight or early in the morning by craft.
It takes six to eight hours.
We will harbor here until.
Good. Thank you very much, Captain.
I guess that means an inquest and reporters.
- You better get your left profile ready.
- Shut up, Christine.
They can't very well bury him at sea, can they?
No, there's too much pollution in the Mediterranean already.
Poor Clinton. It's such a shame.
It would have been such a big grosser for him: The Last of Sheila.
Hey, now, he's dead.
How can you sit around here and talk about some goddamn movie... and he's dead... Will you stop hawking that ice bucket?
I'm just gonna have my Bloody Mary straight up.
Me, too. Bourbon.
Christine, listen,
Clinton's misadventure is unfortunate... but an accident is an accident, and a film is a film.
Has it occurred to anybody that this isn't the first accident?
Yesterday, the propeller.
Last night, the stone.
What do you mean?
Suppose the propeller wasn't an accident.
Suppose it was a mistake.
You mean someone was trying to kill Clinton?
- Why should anyone want to kill Chris?
- Yeah, we're not in Hollywood.
Come off it, Tom.
Look, I assumed Clinton was swimming near the propeller. I heard him yelling.
- Didn't you? Didn't we all?
- What fantasies are you building?
Who did not solve the game last night?
Why did you say "that's funny" when we were standing outside the chapel?
Because it was locked when I left last night.
Then why was it unlocked this morning, and why did Clinton put the sign out?
Because the game was over.
It was, but it shouldn't have been.
I had the homosexual card, and the game should have gone on until I found him.
Exactly. There were some interesting points in the chapel.
Interesting how?
Obviously, he was leaving.
The storm shook the place and the stone fell on him.
Not unless he was crawling.
Why would he be crawling?
The stone that fell on Clinton's head came from the base of the column.
It was grooved.
The tops of the columns are shaped like acanthus leaves, the bottoms are grooved.
Interesting point number one.
Then, there was that piece of wood.
What's that?
I found it in the folds of Clinton's robe.
It's from the grille on the door to the priest's box.
Interesting point number two.
I didn't see any grille on the priest's door.
- Right. You never found him, you said.
- What do you mean, he said?
There was a grille last night, but not this morning.
That grille was removed. Why?
Where's the rest of it?
And what was this doing in the priest's box?
Clinton didn't smoke cigarettes.
Newport.
I'm not the only one who smokes Newports.
Come on. There are cartons all over the ship.
- I'm smoking one.
- What's the difference?
- Did you smoke in there?
- No.
- You?
- I never found him.
Of course. I forgot.
- Honey?
- I don't know. I don't remember.
- But surely not in the priest's box.
- Of course not.
Interesting point number three.
A cigarette nobody smoked.
I don't think Clinton died near the pillar at all. I think he died in the priest's box.
And not from a stone falling or otherwise.
So what do you think happened?
I think he was about to leave when somebody came in.
I am not saying one of us.
Somebody came in, smashed through the grille...
With what, pray tell?
I don't know.
Maybe something he brought with him.
- He or she.
- The candleholder, perhaps.
Crossed my mind.
Maybe it was an accident.
Maybe. But at any rate, he decided to make it look like an accident.
I'm theorizing that he or she stood there for a moment...
assessing the situation, which would account for the cigarette.
Slipped the sign under the door so there wouldn't be any more interruptions.
Dragged Clinton over, placing him near the pillar...
smashed the stone down, thereby making his first mistake.
He assumed the stone was from the top of the column. It wasn't.
But there was very little light.
Now, he had the problem of the wood.
What problem?
Darling, he couldn't very well leave the grille broken.
He hoped, with the frame empty, it would go unnoticed.
Unfortunately, second mistake:
One piece had lodged in Clinton's robe.
The only thing left then was to get rid of the splintered pieces: probably in the sea.
And the game was over.
Hell, I think we can agree that none of us did it, can't we?
I mean, who would?
I really mean, who wouldn't?
But who really would?
Right. After all, we're not the only people around.
What about some of the weirdoes on this ship? What about Vittorio?
That's not what Tom has been saying.
Tom has been saying... that one of us did it.
Or haven't you been listening?
- Hold it.
- I don't care, that's your problem.
Hold it, please. I'm sorry, I was only exploring. I haven't accused anyone.
Yet.
Look, let me just get this out.
Five minutes, and then I'm gonna have five scotches and take a long nap.
- You think you know who?
- No.
Then stop telling us what you don't know and tell us what you do.
There is someone who might clear this up for us.
- Who?
- Clinton.
So help me God, if this is a hoax and he comes through that door...
I'm gonna throw this cut glass ashtray right in his face.
There's no hoax. Clinton's dead all right.
Just say what's on your mind.
- Okay.
- May I have another?
I think it's tied up to the game we've been playing this week.
Do you have the cards he handed out the first night?
We passed it.
I have no idea where mine is.
All right. I'll go and look for it.
Thanks.
I wonder what we're gonna feel like an hour from now.
When Tom's finished writing the scene,
I'll tell you what attitude to play.
I've done it before, you know.
I'm beginning to wish
I hadn't started all this.
You could stop right now.
It's gonna be interesting.
Thank you.
All right. Now, if everyone will please put their cards... if you'll pardon the expression, on the table.
There's only five there.
Where's the other one?
- Tom?
- I'll show mine in a minute.
I'd like to see it now.
Give him a chance.
All right.
We all knew about two of these secrets.
We've already played them.
"Shoplifter" and "homosexual."
The others, we're seeing for the first time.
"Ex-convict." "Informer." "Child..."
Excuse me. "Little Child Molester."
And mine.
So, this was Clinton's idea for a week of fun.
Him assigning us secrets, us discovering them.
And it was a good game.
But some of us began to suspect there was more to it than met the eye.
That Clinton had not assigned these six secrets at random... but that each player had been, at one time in his life... guilty of one of them.
Oh, no.
Not guilty of the secret he was assigned.
Clinton was a far more elegant game player than that.
And he didn't want us refusing to play on the first night... which we well might have done had we been assigned our own secrets.
So it was more than a game.
It was a private joke.
- What does your card say?
- In a minute.
A man is dead.
Evidence indicates that it's murder.
And we've discovered... the murdered man was playing a sadistic game with his guests.
A game whose central theme was six hidden shreds from the past.
Any questions?
Yeah, but you see he knew that I never meant to...
Christine, wait.
That's bullshit!
Nobody would have knocked Clinton's brains in because of some stupid secret.
I agree.
Look at these cards.
Enough to make us squirm. Sure.
Enough to remind us of just how nasty Clinton could be. Sure.
But enough to kill him?
No.
Do let's see your card, old boy.
"Hit-and-run killer."
- What is this sick joke?
- No.
Clinton always took his games seriously.
He wouldn't have spoiled this with a joke.
It seems clear enough he believed one of us guilty of a hit-and-run killing.
Sheila.
The game was to be Clinton's revenge.
- On?
- The person whom he thought... but couldn't prove, to be guilty of Sheila's death.
On the last night, Saturday, my turn, he was gonna pull the plug on that person.
How do you know?
He told me yesterday when he gave me the pill for my back.
Okay, everybody.
What are you waiting for?
Let's all get up and run around in a circle.
This is musical chairs, isn't it?
Isn't that what this is, musical chairs?
In Tom's mind, anyway.
Why, it's just one of Tom's damn fantasies.
But you're all still here.
Okay...
I'll start.
I had a thing with Clinton.
It wasn't much more than me feeling sorry for him.
It didn't last long.
And it's in the past now.
More than ever, right now.
Tom, am I just being slow?
Are you claiming that homosexual card, meaning you're in the clear?
Because I don't know about the rest of you.
And I'm in no position to challenge your little story, charming as it was.
But then it's equally true that Clinton could've come up with dirty half-truths... about you, you, you, or any of us.
I mean, what gives you the exclusive right to that card?
Fair enough. I just looked at the cards and saw only one that applied to me.
If the same is true of you, Anthony, then that's another story.
And it may mean that Clinton's game is invalid.
Well?
Are you trying to say
I'm a homosexual now?
Nobody says you're anything.
I just looked at the cards and said I was the homosexual. That's all.
But that was in the past.
They're all in the past.
Anybody want to say anything?
I mean, if ever there was an "unofficial investigation," this is it, right?
Or should I tell you that Lee and I once heard rumors... about a shoplifting incident concerning somebody in this room?
Okay.
Thanks.
Shoplifter, that's me. It's the only one.
I stole a coat. Et cetera, et cetera.
Don't look so shocked, Anthony.
I'll swipe you some ID bracelets and you'll forget all about it.
All right.
Me for the five scotches.
- Tom, if I may?
- Sure.
That leaves the other four of us somewhat dangling, wouldn't you say?
Hello.
What can I say? I was a secretary, and I was just too eager.
So I dropped a few names to the House
Un-American Activities Committee.
Then those people didn't work for a while.
Now they work.
Sometimes I try and get them work.
Sometimes I see them on the street, and sometimes they cross the street.
So what?
- There is one thing that confuses me.
- Shoot.
I'm just pursuing a thought, you understand? But as I see it... the logical person to have killed Clinton is you...
- because...
- Because... No, go ahead.
- I need some ice.
- That's right.
Because no one else felt so threatened.
You were the only one...
Who knew about the hit-and-run killer card.
I was the only one meant to know about it.
Clinton would never have given that card to the person he thought to be the killer.
I was horrified when I saw the card.
I spoke to Clinton about it.
He laughed. Said he just made up a lot of melodramatic secrets.
But I'm guessing the killer overheard our conversation... and understood Clinton's real motive.
You're cold, Tom.
You think it's me, don't you?
Your wife was 100 miles away... and your sophisticated director friend here seems cool enough... but I'm a little nervous.
- Besides, you dislike me too much.
- I have no reason to dislike you.
- I feel it, though.
- Anthony, I don't think this is the moment.
I think it's the moment.
My moment. Time for my theory.
Now, today, we saw all the cards for the first time.
It didn't take us long to find the truth in three of them.
And your mind worked fast.
I could almost hear it ticking over as you quickly labeled Lee... the ex-convict, arrested in some anti-war rally.
Sentence suspended sort of thing.
And Philip here?
He can kid his way along with some witty child molester jokes.
And that leaves me.
I've done time.
I've been in prison twice, for assault.
And I can prove it.
Can anyone else here make that particular claim?
Disappointed, Tom?
Actually, I was arrested some years ago.
- No.
- I was. I was arrested.
Not just arrested. You see that card?
"Arrested" is quite different.
As a matter of fact, I...
At this point,
I don't think we can go any further.
What?
What I mean is, we've established what we set out to prove.
What is this?
I mean, we can't...
We all agreed to this...
We can't draw any ironclad conclusions.
It's all theoretical.
That's just fine. It's theoretical.
But it's hardly fair to stop now, is it?
Is it, Philip?
I mean, you want to choose from what's left?
We've got... dented fenders, or... how about a little petting in the playground?
Stop, everybody, please.
By which I just mean let me get this over with.
I was drunk. I was too drunk to drive.
No, Tom, stay there, please.
I am so sorry I didn't tell you.
I know you would've helped me do the right thing, but I just couldn't.
I drove down the coast to the party.
I overshot the driveway.
My car skidded. I didn't even see her.
I panicked. So I turned around and drove all the way back to Santa Barbara.
The next morning I wrote that silly note about having to visit my school friend.
And I took the car and I drove as far away as I could. Las Vegas.
I traded cars at the car rental place, and then, that afternoon, I drove home.
And I thought I was safe.
Until the game.
It was things that you said, Tom.
I started to think, and then...
I was the one who looked at the card.
I know the point of the game.
I think it's vicious and I'd like you to stop it.
Go away.
Why did you wait so long?
I only found out last week.
Harry's Rent-A-Car,
Las Vegas. Remember?
- It was...
- I happened to meet Harry.
It was an accident.
It was only an accident.
I swear, Clinton, I'm sorry. I didn't...
He said he hoped you weren't still worried about the damage to the car.
I couldn't get control. I was drinking!
The police never checked on out-of-state cars.
Please don't tell them. Please, Clinton!
You want to let the whole world know?
That's what gave me the idea for the game.
Because the harder you try to keep a secret in, the more it wants to get out.
- See you Saturday.
- No!
Please!
Son of a bitch!
Clinton? Is somebody there?
What's going on?
You're so smart.
You didn't think it could be me.
He kept whispering.
He kept taunting me over and over again.
- Darling, he was so mean.
- Lee, you don't have...
I would like to go downstairs and make a clean exit by myself.
Okay?
Don't worry, everybody, I'm okay.
Sorry, Tom, but that
"clean exit" line bothers me.
Lee, open up.
God damn it, Lee, unlock this door or I'll break it down!
I like you, but go away.
I want a nap.
Then we'll talk about all kinds of stuff.
I'm okay.
I swear to God, I'm okay.
All right, darling, if you say so.
I'll come back in a little while.
Okay?
Is she all right?
The door is locked, but she talked to me.
She just wants to be alone.
- It just never occurred to me.
- You thought it was Anthony.
I don't even know what I thought.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.
You got other things on your mind.
What do you think?
Think there's anything we can do to help?
Let me know what you come up with.
My God, what a sick business this is!
- Are you all right?
- I am not.
I am in a deep state of shock.
Anthony just told me... the deal that Alice's ex-agents made for her on the Douglas picture... and I will never get over it.
Would you like some cake?
- Yes, please.
- How's Tom?
- He says he doesn't want anything to eat.
- What about Lee?
Not a sound. He's been down half a dozen times already.
She's probably passed out.
I never knew she was a boozer.
- In and out.
- She was AA for a while.
Still locked. She doesn't answer.
- The captain must have a master key.
- I got it.
Shall I wake her? I don't know.
- You want me to go with you?
- No, thank you.
Lee, darling?
When I saw her in that chapel, murder was scrawled all over her face.
When I write my autobiography, that line is gonna need a little help.
- I felt undercurrents all evening.
- Now you felt undercurrents.
You know, I knew it. Something told me it was gonna be a bummer in there.
That door creaked open even before I touched it.
And then Clinton getting so physical, and that awful, faraway look in his eye.
Who is it?
I'm sorry.
That's okay. Have you met my fiancé?
- Have you seen Lee?
- No, why, is anything wrong?
What?
Lee is not in her cabin.
Where is she?
She's not in your room, not with Christine, and Alice and Anthony are asleep.
Now what do we do?
I don't know.
Where's the captain?
How old do you think she was?
Don't think about it.
Thirty-five? Thirty-seven?
I hope you're around if I die.
- Wait a minute.
- I don't like getting morbid.
I sure hope someone's around.
Is it terrible to wonder if you can get a good hairdresser in this town?
Christine, you don't really need all that for one night ashore.
I've always dreamed of being interrogated in some cellar... by some slob with steel teeth.
And I want to look terrific tomorrow.
Hey, listen. Must be a taxi strike.
If we don't get to the Majestic, they'll give our rooms away.
I'll be right back, okay?
Besides, Guido said he'd take me dancing tonight if I'd pay the check.
Isn't he cute?
- I can't tell you how sorry I am.
- I know. Are you free later?
Listen, darling, thanks for not letting on about us yesterday.
Well, I thought...
There was enough flak in the air, right?
Well, there was.
Why don't we cool it for a while, aside from the bad press angle?
Let's be honest with each other.
Somehow, your being available and my not being, it's not the same.
You'll always be the world's most attractive man.
God, what a thought I just got.
Namely?
If you get married again, give me a call.
Isn't that awful?
See you tomorrow.
Goodbyes after an ocean voyage are always so sad.
Whose fault is all this?
Clinton's? Lee's?
Mine?
Or Sheila, for being a tough broad... who liked to wander around Bel Air at 2:00 in the morning?
- Does that make any sense?
- Nothing makes any sense.
Something Clinton said... keeps rattling around in the back of my head, if I could remember it.
You'll be at the Majestic?
My invitation was for a week on the yacht.
I didn't bring any pocket money.
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.
- Anthony?
- Tom.
What's going on here?
Are you waiting for the other members of your coven or what?
I've been calling your hotel.
Something's not at all right.
What are you doing?
I'm experimenting.
Look at this cigarette.
It's the original stub.
It's what I went down to ask Lee about last night.
Later, I dismissed it from my mind as a whim. But tonight...
It's the shape.
That bothered me, too.
Stamp it out.
Now... try this one. Quickly, just once.
No, let it burn out.
You see, if it's dark and it's awkward for you... you may stamp on the filter instead of the lit end.
- lf you only have one shot at it.
- As Clinton did.
It was in the box where he was killed, after all.
Bear with me, please.
Now, remember, we both thought this came from the priest's box.
It doesn't. That wood was carved.
This is plain.
It's from the side grille.
How did it find its way into Clinton's robe?
Someone broke the grille.
- You're saying, who?
- Could we be shy one actor in the piece?
Meaning someone who saw the whole thing.
Now, none of it would seem quite so sinister... if it weren't for this.
We found Lee in Clinton's stateroom.
But her cabin was locked from the outside.
What could she have locked it with?
The only key to the cabins was in the wheelhouse.
She probably went into the john and out through my cabin.
No, because your door to the bathroom was bolted from the inside.
I had to unbolt it myself.
There's got to be some explanation.
The point is that anybody could have taken the key last night.
Then again, maybe Clinton broke the grille, nobody else was there... and I'm just puttering my way through the debris of my rusty imagination.
He kept whispering.
Where's the ice pick?
That awful, faraway look in his eye.
- What?
- I said, where's the bloody ice pick?
I don't know. It was...
It's been missing since yesterday afternoon.
The back of Clinton's cowl was stained with blood.
Of course.
You can't strike a man in the face and the back of the neck with the same blow.
Meaning that Lee only thought that she killed Clinton.
Did the police examine the body?
What was the point of it?
Why bother? She confessed.
Thomas, we've lost our touch.
A good director and a good detective ought to pay more attention to detail.
Allow me, please.
This is the director's cut.
The important moment happened before Lee came into the chapel.
Whoever it was lit a cigarette and dropped it through the grille.
And then, as Clinton leaned forward to stamp it out...
stabbed him in the back of his neck with the ice pick.
Then, I assume, he started to leave the field, but...
Just give us the news, please.
...the timing was unlucky because Christine entered.
Christine was sitting there last night chattering about the game.
That door creaking open even before I got to it... and then Clinton getting so physical.
Tom, the door was open when I came into the chapel.
Me, too. He wanted it to stay open so everybody could hear the tape.
Exactly.
So who closed it? Why did it creak open when Christine came towards it?
Because he was trying to get out.
Yes.
He was compelled to improvise.
He impersonated Clinton.
But the grille that he had smashed meant that he couldn't let her into the left side.
So he forced open the door at the opposite end.
Now, he might have hoped to make a run for it...
but the sprung door meant that Christine...
would have a clear view of anyone trying to sneak out of the chapel.
I happened to notice that when we discovered the body.
Small wonder that Clinton had an "awful, faraway look in his eye."
Then Alice has the homosexual card.
Just keep your voice down and get the hell out.
The moment Christine left, he intended to duck out as soon as he possibly could...
but the timing was still unlucky because somebody else came in:
Lee.
She wasn't going to go until she'd had her showdown with Clinton.
So he drove her into a state of hysteria...
convinced that she'd panic and run.
This is taking an awful chance... because she could have raised her voice enough to draw attention.
But luck was on the murderer's side... because Lee presented him with the best possible solution.
She exploded.
She killed a dead man.
And needlessly committed suicide.
Somebody killed my wife.
Not Christine.
Alice? Anthony.
Oh, my God.
- Tom...
- Hold on, I'll be right back.
I like any game where you don't have to move.
You don't have to for this one if you're smart enough.
No, no, don't throw it away.
Keep them till Saturday.
As long as you're fit for Saturday night, which is your biggie.
- Saturday?
- Yes.
She was AA for a while.
If you're smart enough.
She was AA for a while.
What did you find?
The beginnings of an idea.
You seem pleased with yourself.
I've had the beginnings of an idea, too, for a scenario.
It's about a middle-class writer... who is married to a beautiful and wealthy young woman.
Is this an original or an adaptation?
After a few years, she begins to bore him.
Not her money, she herself.
And then, while rewriting a picture in Rome... he renews his acquaintance with a cheap... but not untalented young actress.
Aren't we getting a little off the subject?
I told you something had been nagging me.
Something Clinton had said or done.
He said we didn't have to move to play the game if we were smart enough.
And just now...
I noticed this.
I thought he was being unusually finicky when he was lining us up.
See anything odd?
What's odd?
Everybody's been posed under a letter.
So?
Now have a look at these secret cards.
There's something peculiar about one of them.
Come, Tom, where's that puzzle mind?
"Little Child Molester."
"Little Child Molester"?
As opposed to what, Big Child Molester?
I still don't get it.
The word, "little." What's it doing there?
All right.
The first night, the "Shoplifter."
The second night, the "Homosexual."
We don't know which the third was to be... but Clinton told you that the hit-and-run killer was to be last.
So let's try the "Ex-convict" next.
And then, just for fun, "Informer."
"Sheila."
Clinton needed "little" to give him the "L."
God knows he could have found six other secrets for us... but he wanted to make a game for himself, too.
How to find six secrets that formed an appropriate acronym.
The "L" was his only problem.
Clever son of a bitch.
Cleverer than that. This photograph... showing the six of us carefully posed... under each of the initial letters of our assigned secrets.
Something in plain view the whole week.
Something he could lord over us
Sunday morning.
"Shoplifter, Homosexual, Ex-convict...
"Informer, Little Child Molester.
"Hit-and-run Killer"?
The last of "Sheila" should be an "A."
"Hit-and-run" doesn't begin with an "A," does it, Tom?
- It's a mistake.
- Not Clinton's.
I remember something else about the first day.
You started to crumple your card.
This one is smooth.
That was dumb, Tom.
What was your original card?
All right, let me make an educated guess.
Something about Lee.
Arsonist? No, that doesn't sound like Lee.
Adulterer? No, that's you.
"A..." Alcoholic?
That's the secret. Like the others, not too heavy, not too light.
After all, Clinton was only a minor-league sadist.
His aim was to make us uncomfortable, not violent.
As he kept saying, it was only a game.
You made it more than that.
You killed him.
Why should I want to kill Lee?
Alice.
Lee's estate must be worth about $3 million?
$5 million.
You'd always known that she'd killed Sheila, hadn't you?
Sure.
I knew it the day I got my statement from Harry's Rent-A-Car.
Dented fenders, Vegas.
I didn't have to be a genius to put two and two together.
Fade in. Exterior. Day.
The yacht, the game.
You get the "Alcoholic" card and realize what Clinton is up to.
Not until Alice so generously told me her leopard coat story.
That late?
At any rate... selecting the ice pick... a classic woman's weapon...
When did you take it, I wonder?
Private finance is not that uncommon now.
Can you imagine how Tom would feel about that?
You skipped down to expunge Clinton...
type up a new card that would incriminate Lee... and toddle off to sleep soundly to await the alarms of the morning.
I should've recognized the hatred on your face outside Clinton's door.
Was that to have been the moment of truth?
Alas, Clinton and Christine were having their own moment of truth.
Dissolve.
The next day, you did substitute the cards...
and arranged for Lee to see the wrong one...
making her think
Clinton had sadistic plans to expose her.
The stage was set.
Subsequent investigation of the cards would now point to Lee... as the only person with a motive strong enough for murder.
Would you care to explain how I started the propellers with Guido in the room?
That was my contribution.
You wanted Clinton dead, too.
You see, I'd helped Alice... out of her little unpleasantness those many years ago.
So when we began playing the game, looking for a shoplifter...
I knew some ugly truths would be trotted out.
Not in the least mine.
I wanted it stopped.
As you pointed out so astutely yesterday,
I blundered... but it gave you the courage to carry on.
What do you think?
Am I gonna get away with it?
You pretended your back was hurting... to coax Clinton into revealing... what day your secret would be played.
As long as you're ready for Saturday night, which is your biggie.
It was only Tuesday. Four days' grace.
Clinton's choice of a location was a gift.
But you had to... make sure that you found him before
Lee confronted him with the false card.
So you followed me because I'd been boastful enough to hint...
that I'd figured out the clue.
After my session, you came in...
and proceeded to play Clinton's game as well as your own.
Maybe if I open the door to the chapel a little wider?
What the hell?
Then you put on your little ventriloquist act... for Christine and Lee. I should've realized.
We'd all seen you impersonate Clinton.
Going over your hand signals for the bridge tournament?
How'd I feel about what?
You know too much to live.
How convenient for you that Lee... exploded.
But how inconvenient for you that she thought quickly... and arranged everything to look like an accident.
You must have been furious. So you...
rearranged everything to look like a murder that looked like an accident.
She had picked up the right stone.
You replaced it with the wrong one.
I'll bet that other stone, stained with blood, is still in the corner.
As well as the cigarette that Lee actually smoked.
But, no matter, you knew that the next day... when you conducted your brilliant investigation...
Lee would naturally assume that she had made the mistake.
And it was brilliant. What better detective than the man who's committed the crime?
Every hesitant conclusion, every stumbling interpretation.
And when you suddenly panicked, protecting your wife... it was dazzling, dear boy.
- It's after 12:00 already.
- Is it?
Good. That gives us plenty of time... because the crew is happily celebrating the death of their master in the port.
Aren't we lucky?
I think so.
If you're thinking of setting up for another fake suicide sequence...
I must warn you of the dangers of improvisation.
This last exploit had far too many loose ends... even though you had four days to prepare it.
You even planned for the obligatory confession scene... the morning after the murder.
You knew that she would need some fortification...
when you started turning the screws.
You felt you were safe because no one else on board drank bourbon... which, incidentally, you don't pour out of a porthole... and then toss the bottle overboard.
Your pour it down a drain.
Unless there's something else you're anxious to get rid of like...
Seconal.
I don't have any gloves.
Hey, you guys, knock it off!
Jesus Christ, look at this place.
Actually, we've been having a little difference of opinion.
We've all gotten squirrelly on this trip, but aren't you carrying it a little too far?
About the Last of Sheila project.
But it's all straightened out now.
- What are you doing on board?
- I'm trying to sleep.
Well, not exactly.
Guido took over for Vittorio and asked me to keep him company.
So we went into Clinton's room to listen to the stereo... and instead of getting mood music, we get you guys yakking on the intercom.
Dictate it tomorrow when you can get a secretary.
He killed her, she killed him.
That's a good idea... but we're agreed on the basics, wouldn't you say, Tom?
Now that the truths are known... we've begun to see this as a big project.
There are gigantic themes here, worthy of Dostoyevsky.
There's innocence... guilt... hatred... loyalty.
Lee's ambitions for Tom were such that we, as survivors... feel bound to tell Sheila's story in all its pitiless purity, sparing nothing.
Big budget?
I feel $5 million should cover it.
Alice's price just went up.
Tom, nobody can write it better than you.
Who handles you again?
Actually, I'm keen on having the first draft done by a complete outsider.
Someone who will bring a naiveté to our little inbred circle.
Tom will be needed as technical advisor.
And just before shooting, for a few...
Rewrites.
Rewrites, exactly.
I think I'll turn in.
I'm almost dead on my feet.
So much to do tomorrow... and still a few pages to type tonight.
Sealed letter to my solicitor... protecting the copyright sort of thing.
In these perilous times, one can't be too careful.
Coming, Christine?
Let me hit you with a couple names.
Yul Brynner as Clinton.
Paul and Joanne as Tom and Lee.
I hope it's got enough content for them.
Who have I got for Alice?
I know, Carly Simon!
The soundtrack album alone will pay for her clothes.
Now, don't scream. Virna Lisi.
No, darling, as me!
English
Cripes! It's old lady Rowe!
Come on.
Holland?
- Holland!
- Keep watch.
It's okay. Go ahead.
Cripe's sake! Hurry up!
- Aha! I finally caught you, Holland Perry!
- I'm Niles!
I don't care if you're Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the dirty Democrat!
You stay out of my piccalilli farrago!
Let me go! Let me go!
No sass, boy. No sass!
You're gonna go in there and clean up that mess. Hear me?
Rats! Rats! Rats!
Hundreds of rats! My God!
We'll all be down with bubonic plague!
Holland Perry, I'm going to tell your father on you!
Set your foot on my farm, Holland Perry,
and I'll do more than take my rug beater to ya!
Do you hear?
I'm going to tell your father on you!
Geez, someone oughta
tell her Father's dead.
Let's go. Apple cellar!
Wait! Cousin Piggy's out there.
Hey, Winnie! There's Niles!
Niles!
Niles! Niles Perry,!
You know your grandmother doesn't want
you boys playing in that barn!
Niles, do you hear me?
You'll miss lunch.
Get on up here right now.
Niles, files, run 20 miles!
Tee-legged, tie-legged,
bow-legged Niles!
Little pitchers has got big lips.
- Where you been?
- Around.
Hi, Uncle George.
What say, skipper?
Great day for the race, isn't it?
- What race?
- The human race!
What's got into Mrs. Rowe?
I never heard such a caterwaulin'.
Thank God I don't have to work for that crazy old thing.
There's one of my sunshine boys now.
Hi, Aunt Vee.
Why don't you boys set up the card table in the parlor, where it's cool... and play mah-jongg?
Christ, Valeria, kids don't wanna play mah-jongg.
It's summertime.
They wanna go ride old lady Rowe's cow.
Or is that udder nonsense?
- Yowsah, yowsah!
- Oh! George!
Russell, you'd better go hose off... or you're gonna catch flies.
Hey, Rider!
Toonerville Trolley's leaving!
Niles, go tell that brother-in-law of yours to get out here.
- We're both gonna get fired.
- Yowsah!
Yowsah! Yowsah!
Yowsah! Yowsah!
Yowsah! Yowsah!
Hi, Rider.
Hi, Sis.
Hey, kiddo.
Eat! I swear, you kids must think
I'm runnin' a restaurant around here.
- What's playing at the movies?
- Bet we saw it.
I'll bet we didn't.
We saw it- Naughty Marietta and Murder in the Blue Room.
- Come on, Rider!
- Comin'!
You take care
of the son and heir.
It's not gonna be a boy.
It's gonna be a girl. I told ya!
I know you told me, but you don't say how you know.
He knows. Last year, on Mother's birthday, he predicted a storm.
- And what did we get?
- Hail!
Hail Columbia is what somebody's gonna get if they don't eat.
Eat!
- Rider!
- Oh, honey, bring home some sarsaparilla.
- I have a craving.
- God. Pregnant women.
Can I tune in?
Sure.
Yowsah. It's gonna be a girl.
You witch.
What's in the oven?
Ah! Them is your grandmother's surprise.
Eat!
Alexandra is ready for lunch.
Yes, ma'am. I know.
Let me take it up.
You're gonna have to sit with Mrs. Alexander.
Make her eat.
Otherwise she won't touch a thing.
Niles, put the paper under my arm.
Mmm!
That'll only upset her.
- Tell Mother I'll read to her later.
- All right.
Ouch! Oh!
Did ya eat?
Did ya eat?
Holland.
Holland. You in here?
Damn you. What are you doing
in the dark anyway?
I'm thinking.
Close the door.
Thinking? About what?
Old lady Rowe.
Damned old bitch!
What is it?
A snowman.
Ada made it.
People always call it a hawk.
It's really a peregrine falcon.
Peregrine for Perry.
It is my ring, isn't it?
You gave it to me, didn't you?
Cripe's sake, yes.
I gave it to ya.
Now, will you forget about the ring.
Just wanted to make sure.
Look, the ring was granddaddy's.
When he died, it went to Father,
'cause he was the oldest.
Then when Father got killed
I got it... because I was the oldest.
Only by 20 minutes.
I'm still the oldest.
So I can do anything
I want to do with it. Can't I?
I told you you can have it.
It's yours, and I don't ever want it back.
What about this?
Shut up about that.
If you ever tell anybody on me-
Shh! Listen!
I thought so.
You are playing in here.
You know we're not supposed to.
What's that?
That's Grandpa Perry's ring...
and it's supposed
to be buried.
I'm gonna tell. You just wait until my daddy gets home.
You just see if I don't tell.
Holland.
H-He saw the ring.
I know.
Don't worry, little brother.
- He's gonna tell Uncle George.
- No, he's not.
You can have the ring back.
This too.
Take 'em.
I don't want 'em, Niles.
I gave 'em to you.
Come on, little brother.
Let's get outta here.
Father.
- Father.
- Hey, Niles! What you doin'? Now, come on!
I'm gonna tell!
Only Piggy Lookadoo would have rats for pets.
Rats for a rat.
Come on, Holland.
Let's get outta here.
You killed it, Holland.
You killed it.
Mother!
Mother!
Niles.
Mother, you came down.
So I did.
Are these for me?
Yes. Just for you.
How lovely.
From Ada's garden?
Mm-hmm.
Mother, come and sit.
Please sit and talk.
- But I'm not dressed.
- No one will see.
- Just the two of us.
- All right.
It's all right,
Mother. Please!
No.
I can't. Not today.
What have you been doing today?
Oh.
Reading, as usual.
You still reading
The Good Earth?
Forever The Good Earth.
The librarian says she'll get Anthony Adverse.
Maybe Monday.
Monday.
Now, what's today? Wednesday.
I hope the ashes went out.
It's Friday- fish night.
And it's summer.
No ashes.
Of course. How stupid!
Your birthdays are in March.
I remember.
You and Holland both got those cowboy outfits... with the fancy stitching on the boots and-
What's that?
Just some stuff.
It was Father's.
Mother, are you okay?
Yes, of course, darling.
Russell!
Russell!
Niles, I need a spool of mercerized cotton.
Can Russell borrow your bicycle and go to town and get it?
Sure, Aunt Vee, only it's got a flat.
- Can he borrow Holland's then?
- Sure, Aunt Vee.
Thank you, dear.
Russell!
Russell!
Russell, where are you?
Answer me!
I'm king of the mountain!
I'm king of the mountain!
Hey, Piggy! Your mother wants you to go to the store.
Piggy Lookadoo's gonna ride your bike!
Dushechka. Dushechka!
Baboushka!
Dobryi dyen, baboushka.
Dobryi dyen.
What are you doing there all by yourself? Did you fish?
Not yet.
Summer sure is long.
Life is long, child.
I hate shad.
I prefer the roe.
Roe! Ecch!
Like polliwog eggs.
Such a face!
Dushechka, you are a clown.
Why do you boys not play together?
Holland doesn't like
Piggy Lookadoo.
Does he not?
Perhaps summer is long for Russell too.
Why doesn't Holland like Russell?
Child?
Answer me.
Do sunflowers really follow the sun all day?
A Russian superstition, perhaps.
You miss Russia, don't you?
Sometimes.
But God does not mean that we should miss too much what he takes from us.
Besides, now...
I have other sunflowers.
Ada... can I be something else today?
Bigger than a flower.
Please?
Let's play the game.
The great game.
The great game, is it?
Please? Please?
Very well.
The great game it shall be.
- Oh, boy!
- Come on.
Look there, child.
Look.
Try to be.
Now think as I have taught you.
Look hard.
Feel inside it...
into its head, its heart.
Imagine it, dushechka.
Imagine it.
With all your being... you do feel.
Now.
Now!
Then fly!
Away! Away!
Away, child.
It's scary!
Don't be frightened.
What is it like? Tell me!
Free!
Mr. Angelini!
Look! Look at me!
Niles, what is it?
- It hurt.
- Where does it hurt? Tell me.
It-
It was just sh- pointy, all sharp- pointy.
Here.
- Oh.
- L-It's all right, Ada. Honest.
Did I do good?
Oh, very good.
- Good as Holland?
- Better than anyone.
I love you.
Oh, I love you too.
Come now. Let us get you some root beer.
I'm gonna catch a shad with lots of roe for you!
I'm king of the mountain!
I'm sorry, boy.
I'm just so sorry.
It's all right, Mr. Angelini.
It wasn't your fault.
It was an accident.
Oh. Are we going to be able to go to the firemen's carnival?
Geez! Why not?
Ada says we're in mourning again.
"Ada says. Ada says."
There's seven years bad luck.
See what Ada says about that.
Hurry, folks!
Take home
a five-pound box of candy!
Here it is!
Take home some candy!
All rides are 10 cents!
Don't you ever get hungry
Get a Coney Island red hot!
And help yourself to the mustard!
Big, fat and juicy Coney Island red hots!
And cold drinks, folks!
All right, folks, come over!
Tell you what you're
gonna see on this side!
From the four corners of the world,
and at great expense to the management...
we have brought together some of the most
unusual attractions ever seen under one roof... and all for the price of one admission.
You're going to meet Big Bertha!
Four hundred and fifty pounds of beauty on the hoof.
Yes, sir, she shimmies, she shakes like a bowl of jelly.
And as an extra added attraction,
ladies and gentlemen...
we're going to bring to you
nature's cruelest trick- the hydrocephalic baby, ladies and gentlemen.
Plus Mr. And Mrs. Katz-
Niles! Come on!
- Plus Bo-Jo, the dog-faced boy!
- Come on!
Plus the two-faced man!
All on the inside, ladies and gentlemen!
All for the price
of one admission!
- We're gonna get caught!
- Damn it, Niles. Come on!
Oh, damn!
Hurry, hurry, hurry,!
Fun house!
More fun than a circus!
Come in! Stay as long as you like!
Come out when you're ready!
Come on, Holland. Let's scram.
Holland! Holland! Wait!
Hold on!
- Shh.
- What's going on?
I'm waiting for her to disappear.
Don't be a dumbbell.
No one can do that.
I know! I wanna find out how he does it.
It's just a stupid trick.
He ain't even a Chinese.
He's got tape on his eyes.
So? Come on. Let's go.
No, wait!
I gotta figure it out.
- Yeah? How?
- I'll play the game on him.
Damn phony.
- We saw a magician today.
- Oh, did you, now?
Only it was a dumb fake.
How do you know this?
I played the game on him and figured out the trick.
Holland didn't believe me.
But I really did. It was easy.
I mean, sometimes it's so easy... it doesn't seem like
I'm doing it at all.
It is a special game for special people.
My baboushka taught me, and I taught you children.
But sometimes
I don't know how I do it.
Of course you know.
I've told you.
There is no trick to it. Just imagination.
But do not play the game too much, dushechka. Da?
There are other things in life besides the game.
And children should play with other children.
But I like to play with Holland.
But you should make other friends.
Holland's my friend.
Sing to me, please.
Oh.
Now it is time for all good boys to be in bed.
Butterfly kiss?
And tomorrow... it will be time for all bad boys... to make apologies to Mrs. Rowe.
I saw her today.
And in the morning... her damaged preserves will be replaced in person...
by the one responsible.
I'll tell Holland.
Please be sure he understands.
I'm coming!
Good afternoon, madam.
What is this? Halloween?
- This is for you.
- For me?
What is it?
- For the piccalilli I broke.
- Piccalilli?
- And I came to apologize.
- Oh, I remember you.
- Where's the other one?
- Niles won't come.
He says I broke it, so I had to apologize.
Huh. I accept it.
May I come in, please?
- You want to come in?
- Yes, please.
Well, all right.
You can come in.
My, my.
You boys have grown so.
- Here you are.
- Thank you, ma'am.
You're musical!
I play the piano.
- I can do tricks too.
- What kind of tricks?
Shh.
I'll show you.
All right.
What are you doing there, Holland?
Shh. It's a better light for the trick.
Oh.
Shh.
You're very mysterious, aren't you?
Shh.
You're not going to pull
a rabbit out of there, are you?
No. Guess again.
I got your pain pills.
Oh, my child, thank you.
Why do people have to die?
Well, all of life must die.
'Tis nature's way.
Every bird... every tree, every flower... has its time.
They put you in the ground.
As we come from the earth, so we are returned to it.
I don't like to think about that.
When I was very young, like you...
I was frightened of death too.
So, to set my mind at peace... my baboushka told me when it came time to die I must not be afraid.
I must look for an angel... who would come from paradise.
And this angel would smile... and fold me in her beautiful white wings... and carry me off to heaven.
Baboushka called her-
Which means...
"the angel of the brighter day."
And from that time
I was no longer afraid of death.
You see?
And when I came here... and found this church... this angel became for me...
the angel of the brighter day.
You see?
Do you still believe she will come?
Oh, yes.
Will the angel come for me when I die?
If you believe... then surely she will.
Thank you, Mr. Clifford.
Thank you, sir.
Alexandra.
Mr. Angelini, can I borrow your clippers?
Thank you, Mr. Angelini.
Here's the Anthony Adverse at last!
Thank you.
It's positively gargantuan!
It'll take me all summer to read this.
I'll read to ya.
When you were younger,
I used to read to you two.
Now you read to me.
What was that story you both used to love so?
The one about the pig that got roasted with an apple in his mouth- poor, greedy thing.
One of Holland's favorites.
That was Piggy Lookadoo.
But Holland's real favorite... was the story of the changeling.
You know, the fairy tale about the elves stealing the baby?
It's a horrid story.
I don't like things like that.
- What about Uncle Tom's Cabin?
- Terrific!
Eliza crossing the ice carrying her baby... and the dogs chasing her, and then Simon Legree with his whip... and Topsy's eating watermelon... and little Eva dies and goes to heaven.
- Remember?
- I remember.
And you said to me,
"Mother, what did you do in the Civil War?"
Are you hoping?
Yes, darling, I'm hoping.
Everything is going to be all right now.
Everything's going to be all right.
- Guess what.
- What?
We're gonna have another show in the barn this summer.
A magic show with a trick.
- What kind of a trick?
- I can't tell.
We want it to be a surprise.
Oh!
I have a present for you.
- Another present?
- Close your eyes. Come on.
Okay. You can open 'em now.
Guess which one.
Left or right?
- Left.
- Wrong.
Open it.
You have to warm them up.
It only takes a second.
They're Mexican jumping beans, Mother.
Don't you think they're cheerful?
Yes, very.
- Niles.
- Hmm?
Do you know what this is?
Sure.
It's the family crest.
A peregrine falcon.
"Peregrine" for Perry.
Like the weather vane?
Mm-hmm.
And the ring?
Mm-hmm.
Here comes the vegetable man!
Corn and beans! Corn and beans!
Succotash time!
I gotta get Mr. Pretty his root beer, or he'll have a conniption!
Don't you dare track dirt in.
I just washed my linoleum.
Here you go, Mr. Pretty!
Well, thank you, Niles.
That'll sure wet my whistle.
- Here.
- Thank you, Mr. Pretty!
- Now where you goin'?
- Swimming!
You know,
I been wonderin' all week-
Your neighbor lady, she go away or somethin'?
Mrs. Rowe?
That's what we been wonderin'.
Well, usually she boils up a mess of tripe on Fridays... and I bring her some dandelion greens for it.
But I can't raise a soul.
Well, between you and me...
I don't think Mrs. Rowe's such a good housekeeper.
You wouldn't believe the smell over there.
Let me have
a couple of cakes.
Swiss chard's nice today.
Mrs. Alexander
don't like Swiss chard.
Going for a dip.
Be back soon.
What's the last thing
you'd like to see...
before you die?
The last thing?
I mean, if there was
one very last thing... you could wish to see before you die, what would it be?
Listen...
if I was dying...
I'd be too busy doing just that,
and so would you.
I'd wish to see... her.
- See who?
- The angel.
You know.
Ada's angel in the church.
Just before I died... the angel would swoop down... and take me in her wings... and carry me off to heaven.
That's what Ada says.
- How do you know she wouldn't take you to hell?
- Angels don't go to hell.
Only bad people do.
Come on, Niles, will ya!
Wait a minute!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
That damn Uncle George.
He said he was gonna do it,
and he did.
Come on.
Hey, Holland,
we get enough of this stuff... we could use it to catch us when we do the magic show.
You know, like a mattress.
Know what I mean?
There isn't gonna be any magic show. Not now.
Why not?
Figure it out, little brother.
Think it all out.
We build the stage over the trap door... you turn the cabinet,
I drop down...
and then what happens?
You run out, around the back stairs... and appear in the audience like Chan-Yu did.
- Okay, how do I run out?
- Through there.
Through here?
See what I mean?
That damn Uncle George.
Well, we're gonna need more cattails anyway.
Lots of'em.
So let's get 'em.
Come on.
Hey! Come on, will ya!
Niles, we will eat soon.
Go wash. Put on some clothes.
Right now?
- Where are you going?
- To Mrs. Rowe.
She's alone over there and may have taken sick.
Can I come?
No! Child, don't look.
Run. Go get your Uncle George.
Tell him to call the constable.
She's dead!
- Who? Who?
- Who's dead?
Old lady Rowe- l-I mean, Mrs. Rowe!
- Ada says come!
- Oh, my God.
And call the constable!
- George. George!
- Get on the phone.
George, come here!
- George, Mrs. Rowe is dead, and Ada's over there alone.
- I'll be right there.
Evelyn? It's Torrie Gannon.
We've had some more trouble over here.
Can you locate the constable?
When you find him,
have him come to Mrs. Rowe's house...
out on Valley Hill Road
right away.
It's urgent. Thank you.
I told ya! I told ya!
I knew someone would find that stuff!
Goddamn it, Niles!
I told ya!
You said she'd never find 'em.
You said put 'em in the desk!
- You said she'd never come in here!
- Never mind what I said.
She found it, and she's got it.
She's got it, little brother...
and you'd better get it back.
Get it back.
I mean it.
Tell her you want it. It's yours.
It doesn't belong to her.
It was Father's ring.
I gave it to you. It's not hers.
Yeah, but it's supposed to be buried.
She knows that.
What are we gonna do?
I told you what to do.
Get it back.
Mother.
Mother, come away.
Mother, please.
Please, Mother.
Mother, you hurt your hand.
Oh, Mother.
You found the tobacco tin.
L-I'm sorry.
Niles... what are you doing with Father's ring?
It was supposed to have been buried.
Yes, Mother.
But-
Tell me, Niles, please.
What are you doing with the ring?
- It's mine.
- Yours?
How can it be yours?
Holland gave it to me.
H-He did, Mother. Honest.
When?
When did Holland
give you the ring?
- In March.
- March?
When in March?
After our birthdays.
After your... birthdays?
Where, Niles?
In the name of heaven, where was Holland when he gave you the ring?
We were in the front parlor.
Did he give you this too?
Yes, I gave it to him.
Now give it back, Mother.
Ada! Ada!
Ada!
Mother-she fell!
What's the matter, little brother?
Leave me alone.
Mother's gonna be all right.
You'll see.
She can't walk anymore.
She can't even talk.
She's paralyzed.
- Who says?
- Everybody.
You heard the doctor.
What does he know?
She'll get better.
Wait and see.
It was just an accident.
Niles?
Niles!
Are you all right, child?
Yes.
I do not think so.
Tell me.
Tell Ada, please.
I get scared sometimes.
What frightens you?
I don't know.
Sometimes we are frightened of things we do not know.
But when we speak of them... we see there is nothing there to be afraid of.
He's there.
Who?
Holland.
Holland scares me.
Niles.
This is Holland's harmonica, is it not?
Yes. He said he lost it.
Do you know where I found it?
No.
At Mrs. Rowe's house.
Do you know how Mrs. Rowe died?
She had a heart attack.
D-Did Holland go to visit her that day?
He went over, like you said, and a- and apologized.
And?
And he said Mrs. Rowe gave him cookies and lemonade.
It was an accident. Honest.
He didn't mean to.
It was just a game.
Go on.
He was mad at her
'cause she told on him.
So he played a trick on her with a rat to scare her.
I told him.
I told him don't.
- He doesn't mean to be bad, but sometimes-
- Stop it!
It's true. It's true.
He's bad, but he doesn't mean to be.
- Honest.
- Enough now.
I shall not hear anymore.
Come.
- Now, child, tell me what you see.
- No, no!
- Look there and tell me.
- No!
No. No.
Very well.
Very well then.
Play the game with me.
Please, child.
Play the game.
I don't want to play the game. Please!
You must.
Concentrate.
There.
Now tell me, what is it like?
Cold.
What else?
Dark.
Dark? How?
Dark... l-like the apple cellar.
It's a prison.
I can't get out.
It's locked.
I want to get out, but I can't.
Tell me what you see.
I see a box.
Black.
Handles.
The box is wood.
Mahogany. It's-
- It's a-
- Go on!
It's a... coffin.
Go on. Further.
I see a face.
Whose face?
- I don't want to!
- You shall. You must!
Holland! Holland!
Holland, help me, please!
Say the truth! Now!
Out loud, so we shall both hear it.
Holland is dead!
Remember?
On his birthday.
He is dead, Niles!
Remember?
Remember?
Holland!
Holland! Holland!
Holland! Holland!
Oh. Oh.
Are you all right, child?
Da.
Da.
Oh, child, I am so sorry.
But you had to see the truth.
It was only a game.
We were playing a game, you and I... like all the other games we play.
Only the time has come for all the games to stop.
It is wrong, you see?
Dangerous.
Oh, my dushechka.
I could not bear to see you so unhappy, to watch you all alone... so I pretended with you.
I pretended Holland was alive... because you wanted it so.
I thought in time such fantasies would pass...
and you would come
to see the real world.
Have I seen the real world yet?
Da, dushechka.
I know it now.
Your world is very real... for you.
Only I could not see.
Perhaps I could, but I would not see.
It was wrong of me to want you to play the game.
The wrong was mine because I taught you.
Oh, God,
I have done this thing. L-
Oh.
I did not know how far it had gone.
It was only because I loved you.
Do you still love me?
Child.
I have not loved your mother... more than
I have loved you.
There is nothing in my life...
I have loved more than you- nothing.
But everything is different now.
It is different now.
Nothing can ever be the same.
Not for any of us.
Everything has gone too far.
It must stop now.
Are you going to send me away?
Away?
Why?
Where would you go?
Away.
No, dushechka.
You shall never be sent away.
We'll be together always?
Always.
Always!
But no more games. Da?
Da.
Sleep now.
Sleep.
Come on, little brother.
It's all right.
Don't be scared.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Remember?
Go ahead. Open it.
Oh, that's sad.
Isn't that sad, little brother?
Talk to him, little brother.
Holland.
Think. Concentrate.
Think hard.
Play the game
the way she taught you.
You're good at the game.
Go ahead and do it.
He has something for you.
Holland.
Hello, little brother.
Hello.
Are you all right?
Yes.
And I have something for you.
You do?
Take it.
Take it.
- It's stuck.
- Take it.
I can't. It won't come.
Your finger's all swollen.
I know, I know.
Take it.
I'd better not.
Ada would get mad.
She said to bury it.
Ada says the ring is cursed.
"Ada says. Ada says."
Take it.
Holland, it won't come off.
It won't.
Hey, wait.
I've got an idea.
Come closer.
In the garden by the gate-
You're good at the game.
Go ahead and do it.
Concentrate.
No!
Yes. Do it, little brother.
It's easy. Do it, Niles.
Come on. Do it.
Do it now.
Now.
Holland.
Holland.
Hi.
What are you looking so worried for, little brother?
I thought maybe you wouldn't come.
Of course I came.
What do you think?
Ada says we can't play the game anymore.
No more game? Why?
Ada says it's wrong.
"Ada says."
What's wrong with playing the game, for cripe's sake?
She says it's dangerous.
Dangerous.
Yeah. And I'm getting scared, Holland.
What are you scared of?
I don't know.
But Ada's right.
Something awful could happen.
We can still play the game.
She doesn't have to know.
We could play it in secret.
- She'll know.
- How?
Ada knows everything.
She can tell what you're thinking about if she wants.
If she finds out, it's gonna make her unhappy.
I don't want to make her cry again.
You didn't see her upstairs.
She was crying.
I'm scared for her too,
Holland.
Look, little brother.
Getting scared isn't gonna do any good.
Besides, if you get scared...
you're not gonna be able
to play the game at all.
And I won't be around then.
Don't say that, Holland.
We can be together.
We can always be together.
But don't say that.
Cripes!
Don't ever say that.
No.
Well... sure.
If you want me to.
But don't say that, Holland.
I can't help it.
I'm just scared, that's all.
I'm scared.
I'm really scared.
Okay. I'll try,
I will. Honest.
But we better be careful.
They're coming!
They're coming!
Ta-da! Mother of the year.
Hi, Torrie.
Oh!
Let me see the baby.
Oh, isn't she beautiful?
Oh, what a lovely-
Let me hold her.
Oh, she's my dear child.
She'll have
a lot of mothers around here.
Look at that little face.
- Look, look!
- She's smiling! Oh!
She has to eat in an hour.
Mother.
I brought you some lunch.
And after you have your soup...
I'll read to you.
Won't that be nice?
I had to take Anthony Adverse back.
It was overdue.
I've been working on the magic show.
I'm trying to make it work.
Ada says it's a puzzle, but I'll get it.
Oh! The baby's home.
It's a girl, just like I said.
And she's beautiful.
Mother... please don't cry.
I don't like to see you cry.
Everything is going to be all right.
Once you used to read to us.
Now it's the other way around.
"Once upon a time"-
Fairy tales always seem to begin like that, don't they?
"Once upon a time, there were some elves...
"who happened upon a cottage in a wood...
"where they spied a baby in a cradle.
"The mother was nowhere to be seen.
"And the elves,
being bad and mischievous creatures...
"who loved nothing so much as doing harm to others...
"stole the child and left in his place a changeling...
"an ugly creature
of impish countenance...
that no mother
could possibly love."
I'm sorry, boy.
Leno, he's...
It's broke.
Leno fix.
Leno- Leno fix.
Leno fix. It's broke.
Leno fix.
It's broke. Broke.
If the baby cries, just let her.
Don't go spoiling her now.
We'll bring some ice cream home after the show, Aunt Vee.
Thank you.
Yankees are playing tonight, and I'm-
- Winnie, you sit up front.
- Oh, thank you, Rider.
Oh, close that door!
The wind is fierce.
Have you seen Niles?
- No. Isn't he in his room?
- No.
Niles!
Niles?
Child, what are you doing down there?
Playing.
Come up, please.
Bring your things.
- Niles.
- Hmm?
Were you playing the game?
No.
Ashford One,
calling Indianapolis ground.
Ashford One
calling Indianapolis ground.
Come in, please.
We're here, Ashford One. Over.
My windscreen's iced over. Going to have to
come in blind. Can you head me?
We can head you, Ashford One.
Is Mary there with you?
Yes, I'm here, Jack.
It's me, Mary.
We're all rooting for you.
That-a-girl, Mary,
Chin up. Buster's here too.
And I'm gonna put you right down... and you're gonna go to sleep, yes, you are.
Wait just a minute.
You'll soon be in your bed.
Yes, sweetheart.
Ooh, what a pretty girl.
Ooh. Ooh, you're so pretty.
You're so pretty.
Yes, you are.
What is that?
What are you doing there?
Go away! Get away, you crazy old man.
Get away. Get away,
you damn fool!
Get away! Go on! Get out.
- All right.
- What is it?
It was that damned Angelini. He scared me half to death. Right there at that window.
Oh, honey, shush.
Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
You run along.
I will sit with the baby.
Well, he scared her half to death too.
Damned idiot.
Thank you, child.
These hands told me this weather was coming.
I will go sit with your mother.
- Put down the netting, please.
- Okay.
Ada! Ada!
Ada, Ada, Ada!
Anything under there?
Get some light over here.
You see what I mean?
There's Angelini's ladder right where he left it.
Christ. It's the Lindbergh thing all over again.
- Fowler. This way.
- George.
Uncle George!
Uncle George!
You there!
No!
More cars comin'.
Where's Charlie
with those other dogs?
There's Charlie's truck now.
It's about time!
Has anybody
found her, Bob?
Nothin'in here.
Child, have you seen Rider?
- Come on!
- Niles?
Oh, go inside, please.
Get up on there.
Let me up the ladder.
Rider! Rider!
The Italian took the kid.
Could be miles away by now.
- Rider!
- Ada?
What's the matter?
What are you doing out here?
Where is Rider?
Torrie needs him.
I think I saw him down by the pond. Rider!
Rider!
Come on up here.
- Where are ya?
- Here!
Come on!
Rider, Torrie is calling
for you.
The doctor is trying to get her to sleep.
Niles!
Niles!
Come on! Be careful!
Come on.
Get a move on!
Holland!
Where are you?
Holland, where is the baby?
I know you've got the baby.
Holland. Damn you!
Where are you?
- Holland!
- Niles.
Where is the baby?
Holland's got the baby.
He put some pain pills in your tea.
He stole the baby.
He's bad.
He'll never go to heaven.
Holland killed Russell.
He stuck the pitchfork in the hay.
He was mad 'cause
Russell saw the ring.
The ring was mine.
Holland gave it to me.
He told me to take it.
He made me do it
with the rose shears.
Poor Mother.
But she found it.
Holland pushed her down the stairs.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God, Niles!
Holland wanted the ring.
He always did.
He killed Father.
He pushed the door down on him.
Holland!
Holland!
Where is the baby?
Please, Holland!
Niles, listen to me.
Say it now.
Holland is dead!
- Holland did not take the baby!
- No! No!
- Niles did it!
- No! No!
No, no, no!
Put that
son of a bitch on the truck!
All right, now.
Goddamn it, talk!
- Where's the baby?
- We're gonna ask you one more time.
We got Angelini over here at the barn!
Oh, my God.
- My God.
- George, what is it?
What is it? What's happ-
George, what is it?
Oh, my God! No!
That poor little baby.
Oh, Jesus.
That little baby.
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no.
Oh, no!
You're gonna get the chair, you bastard!
The chair's too good for him!
Holland!
Holland.
Damn you, answer me.
Holland, please!
Who are you?
Me? I'm me.
Niles Perry.
Are you?
Are you sure?
Somebody's up there.
Who is it?
I know. I know.
I know who it is.
It must be.
It must be.
No! No!
Niles, wash up now.
Time for lunch.
THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE
YOUNG WOMAN MYSTERIOUSLY MURDERED!
THIRD IN LITTLE OVER A MONTH!
"Ll Giorno", please. Thanks.
The usual garbage!
- Come on, Carlo, we'll be late!
- Relax! They'll wait.
- The thing you wrote was a success with the experts. - I'm glad.
Sam Dalmas, great hope of American literature, now writing manuals on the preservation of rare birds.
- Be funny if I won a prize forit.
- How's Giulia? - Fine.
She's out of town on a modeling job. She'll be back tonight.
- How are things going?
- Very well.
- I'm taking herback to the States with me. - Really serious.
- Looks like it.
- Good morning. - 'Morning.
Back home I'll look for a friend of mine to return a favor.
I was going through a bad period, a little short on inspiration.
"Go to Italy", he said, "you need peace, tranquility, that's Italy".
"Inspiration'll come to you.
Nothing everhappens in Italy!"
May he roast in hell!
Anyway, I came. I believed it!
Saw the country and the monuments, then spaghetti, the atmosphere...
Great! Only I'm dead broke! And I haven't written a line in 2 years.
I wouldn't have the plane fare home if you didn't give me this job.
Which you carried out beautifully!
Here's your check, Mister Dalmas.
- Hey, Sam, don't you want a copy?
- Who needs it? I have this!
Hey! Open the door!
Hey! Hey!
How do I open the door?
I can't get in!
How do I open the door?
Hang on, just hang on!
Open the door!
Call the police!
I called the police!
Herpulse is weak but it wouldn't appearto be serious.
She hasn't lost too much blood.
- Okay, get on with it. - Yes, sir.
- Check forfingerprints. - Okay.
Good evening.
- I'm inspector Morosini.
Tell me about it. - What's that?
What happened? I want to know everything you saw and you heard.
- How is she? - She'll be alright, thanks to you.
- What's yourname? - Sam Dalmas.
- Are you English? - No, American.
I was walking in front of the gallery and I saw these lights.
I looked up here and I saw these two figures struggling.
Put her down carefully.
- She was so good. - Let me through
I'm the owner of the gallery.
Monica!
Monica.
Monica.
- What happened?
- She's in no state for questions.
- Is it serious? - No, nothing serious, just a flesh wound.
- Monica.
- Come on. - Let go of me.
I'm Alberto Ranieri, she's my wife.
- Excuse me. - Speak to me, what happened? - You're tiring her.
- Dear, who did it? Who?
- We don't know.
- I hope yourwife may be able to tell us... - Right, we'll go.
What was she doing in the gallery at this time of night?
She was going overthe books,
I was supposed to pick herup.
- Monica!
- Go ahead!
- Stand back. Let the stretcher through. - Poor girl!
- Stand back now, please!
- Right, that's it.
- Where were we? - There were something wrong with that scene.
Something odd.
I can't pin it down, but I have a feeling that something didn't fit.
- Think about it. Isolate it.
- I've tried, I can't pin it down.
Let's see if I can help. You saw someone run out through this door.
Yeah. But it was so dark underhere, the doorwas almost...
Don't touch anything! Try keeping yourhands in yourpockets.
Just to avoid temptation.
It saves time and trouble.
On the mezzanine was noted a statue of a warrior, a bronze on the wall and a sculpture resembling a branch of a petrified tree.
On the ground floor an irregulartrail ofblood stains from the service door at the rear to within 10 feet the front window.
Apart from that there's no other sign of a struggle. You got that?
- According to you, she came down these stairs. - She did.
Now we'll measure from the window to the stairs.
Blood.
I've had it, I can't take anymore!
We've been through the whole damn thing six times!
I've told you everything, every detail...
I don't know that woman,
I'd never seen herbefore.
Let's start over again, maybe there's a detail you've forgotten.
Let's go back to this strange figure you saw, describe it.
It was dark, I was too far away, it was nothing but a dark figure.
I'm tired, I leave for America in two days and I got a lot to do.
- Really? Have you made the reservation? - Yes.
- Have you yourpassport on you?
- Yeah.
- May I have a look at it a moment? - Yes.
Thank you.
- Hey!
- Hey what? - My passport.
- We'll take care ofit. - You're kidding! I can't move without it.
We don't want you to. You're too important to us as a witness.
You saw something which, though you can't recall it, is clearly vital.
And until this point is cleared up,
I can't allow you to leave.
I didn't mind coming here, but...
During the past month there have been three unexplained murders.
The victim were women, three crimes without any apparent motive.
It's clearto me that there's a dangerous maniac at large here.
What makes the inquiry difficult, as far as we're concerned, and it's forthis reason we require your cooperation, it's I'm certain this man is, as far as his appearance goes, sane.
In his daily life he's completely normal, like anybody else.
- Even like you.
- Me? - Yes, like you, why not?
Let's suppose you're insane:
You entered there and attacked her.
But when you tried to escape you're casually trapped between the doors.
You're crazy! You can't grab a foreigner and accuse him of murder.
- No one's accusing you. - Giving me the third degree. It's illegal!
I want to call my consulate!
Go ahead. Call anyone you want.
Call the president of America.
- Atough nut. - Just humorhim...
- Here's a copy of Monti's report.
TWA? I want to cancel a reservation. Sam Dalmas.
Number one twelve,
New York, day aftertomorrow.
Yeah, thank you.
Look out behind!
- Are you hurt? Can I help you?
- Don't worry, I'm okay. Thanks.
Wow! That's the most enthusiastic welcome I've everhad.
Hey! It's been a month now.
You had a hard day at the office, dear?
No, I just witnessed an attempted homicide.
I was given the third degree by the police,
I had my passport confiscated, so we can't leave, and just now I had my head nearly decapitated by a meat cleaver.
You know, the usual.
Now you just tell me all about it.
Funny thing it's this is the truth.
Bring in the perverts. Look at them and see if you recognize anyone.
The murderer'd have gone back to the gallery to see if she was dead and we can't rule out the possibility that he is a pervert.
Aldo Sarti, age 42, eight convictions.
Sandro Larrani, age 35, exhibitionist, twelve arrests.
Mario Zandri, age 66, four convictions.
Giacomo Rossi, age 50, three convictions for corrupting minors.
Rubatelli Luigi, alias Ursula Andress.
- No! Petrini! - Yes? - What's this character doing here?
How many time did I tell you Ursula belongs with the transvestites?
- I should hope so! - Come, I have something interesting to show you.
We have subjected this glove to a microscopic examination and we came up with a few interesting facts.
The blood stains are of the same group as Monica Ranieri's from which we deduce the murder was wearing it at the time.
These grains are tobacco ash from which we can tell he smokes cigars.
The traces of tobacco on the glove are peculiar of Havana cigars.
This was our most exciting discovery.
Microscopic particles of a type of fibermade only in England.
- We found it inside.
- That's a good start anyway.
That means that we now know he's a man who smokes cigars, who dresses with elegance and who is left handed.
We deduced it from the wear on the glove.
Now we feed what we discovered into the computer and get the result.
- Have you done that, yet? - Yes.
- Good, then we'll have a look.
This is an outline of the man we are after, reconstructed with an accuracy of plus orminus 10%.
In a moment will follow the first personal data.
Statistically speaking, the description could fit about
150.000 inhabitants of this city.
Of those, most of the ones we feel are the most likely, are in jail.
What're you waiting for?
Do you think it's easy to check the alibi of 150.000 people?
I've got nothing to go on.
It's only a hunch.
But I'm sure that you really did see the murderer's face that night.
- But I told you...
- Concentrate, Mr. Dalmas, please!
Try to rememberwhat you saw.
No, it's not use. I've run through it over and over again.
I can't get it out of my head, but I can't manage to pin it down.
Monica Ranieri has left the hospital and returned to her apartment in the via Bruxelles, number35.
Can I go now?
- What floor?
- Third.
I'm really sorry, Mr. Dalmas, but my wife can't see anybody.
She's under sedation at the moment.
You understand afterwhat she's been through.
What did you want to speak to her about?
Nothing much. I just wanted to talk to her about that evening.
I'm convinced I saw something that may lead to the attacker's capture.
I wanted to check what I remember with what yourwife remembers.
My wife has already told the police everything she knows several times.
I can see no reason for subjecting herto that ordeal again.
I see.
- May I ask you a question?
- Certainly. - How tall are you?
Six feet one, I think. Why?
- Nothing, just curious.
- Anything else? - No.
I apologize if I've disturbed you.
Looking foryour cigarettes?
- Yes.
- Here!
Be seeing you, Mr. Ranieri.
- Didn't I tell you not to bet that horse? - Yes, I know.
One's no good, you gotta get two orthree to...
- First victim. - Right.
- Sales girl in an antique shop.
- She left at the same time and was found murdered in a park. - Park.
It was a mile from the shop in the opposite direction from herhome.
- First question. - What?
- Why so far away and in a park?
She could have gone to meet herboyfriend. Second victim.
Atart, she was killed under a bridge where she took her clients.
They suspected herpimp. His name's
Garullo, but his alibi is ironclad.
Where can I find this Garullo?
- You can't, he's in jail. At least he was a month ago. - Great.
- Okay, numberthree.
- Numberthree.
- That was a student.
- Student.
- She was killed on her way home from the movies. - Movies.
Okay?
Enough?
Okay, we start with the first one, that antique shop.
- Good morning.
- Good morning. - Can I help you?
- Yes, I'd like to see something...
- You're interested in porcelain.
You have marvelous taste.
These peaces are beautiful.
Simply divine.
- How much is this one?
- Three hundred.
But I won't be unreasonable about it. Not with you.
My goodness.
- Isn't this the shop where that girl worked? - Pardon me?
The girl who was murdered.
The poor, poor girl.
What a terrible way to end.
- What was she like? - Lovely girl. But a little unusual.
Yes, it was said that she preferred women.
- I couldn't care less.
- Of course not. - I'm not racist!
I rememberthat night as ifit were yesterday.
We hadn't made a sale all day!
Then just before we closed, we sold a painting that was in the window.
- Did you make the sale? - No, the girl did. I was checking the books.
And then she went out without even say goodnight.
Soon after, they found her.
- What was the painting?
- It was strange.
Naive but macabre at the same time.
Would you like to see it?
- You still have it? - I've only a copy, we took a photo.
I would like to see it.
I will show you.
Let me see, here it is!
- Can I borrow it? - No, we don't normally allow that. - Please?
- Hey, what's wrong? - I don't know, that painting. It bothers me.
What is it?
It's a photo of a painting that somebody mixed up in the murderers.
Looks a little perverted to me.
Darling!
It gives me the shivers.
- Thanks, sergeant.
- Forget it. - Look!
- Something wrong, Miss?
- No, nothing, thanks.
- Good night.
- Good night, Miss.
No! No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Tell me something.
Is it really necessary?
- What? - Running around playing the detective?
Isn't it slightly ridiculous and rather dangerous too?
- Nah!
- Thank you.
I feel I'm closerto the truth than either one of us realizes.
What's happening to me? This damn thing is turning into an obsession.
- Who is it?
- Morosini.
- Hello. How are things?
- Fine, come in.
For a minute out there I thought
I'd got the wrong address.
- Doesn't anyone else live in this building? - No.
They're going to tearthe building down soon.
My lease doesn't run out till next week, so I'm staying on.
- Care for a coffee?
- Thanks I would.
In fact it's just what I need.
I've been up all night.
Thanks.
How come?
Here.
- When?
- Last night.
A blonde, 28, lived alone.
The usual blank wall. No clues, no tie in with the otherthree.
The press is putting two and two together.
They think they see a link between the fourmurders.
- Giulia, this is inspector Morosini. - Good morning.
Excuse me, I think we've met somewhere before.
- No, I'm sure we haven't.
- Hey, look at this. - Not another.
As you may've suspected, there is an ulteriormotive formy visit.
I would like you to come down to headquarters with me.
- Why don't you just leave him alone? - No. - Let me finish.
He isn't even Italian and you're making him risk his life.
They tried to kill him. What makes you so sure they won't try again?
You're blackmailing him, you're hanging onto his passport and at the same time you're appealing to his humane instincts.
Shall we go?
Take care, won't you?
I'm sorry.
- Alright, now then.
- Now then, nothing!
I've gone over and over, absolutely nothing.
I saw them struggling on the mezzanine. That's as far as I get.
I can't think of anything else.
But I know there's something.
- Thanks.
- What are yourplans?
I think
I'll stick around for a while.
Need any help foryourinvestigations?
- I thought I was being followed.
- Foryour own protection.
Yes, I would like some help.
I'd like to see that pimp Garullo.
- That's easy. - They've arrived forthe television interview.
I'll make a fool of myselfin front of millions television viewers.
- What'll you say? - I don't know,
I'll make up some spectacularlies.
That briefly is the situation.
Forthe moment I can only say that we have certain information which I am sure will soon lead us to the murderer.
I urge all citizen to remain calm and report anything suspicious to the police immediately, thank you.
Get back to me as soon as you can, let me know if you need anything.
Inspector Morosini?
- Hello? - I wanted you to know how much I enjoyed yourtalk on TV.
- Who's this? - Who, but the person you are so anxious to find.
- The unknown the city fears!
- Tape the call on Morosini's line.
You got no clue. Not a suspicion, you know that and so do I.
It isn't right to trick the public.
I'm not scared, you'll have a 5th murderbefore the end of the week.
Hello?
- Careful, it's heavy! - It's one of the best example of cosmic art.
But we never stand still, in some days we're opening a show of sculptures and bass reliefs.
- You'll be changing everything.
- We'll replace everything. Yes.
- Mr. Ranieri? - Yes? - Would you take a look to check the position?
Yes, I'll be with you. Will you excuse me? Nice seeing you here.
Nice to see you, too.
I want to thank you forwhat you did forme that night.
They said if you hadn't been there that madman would've killed me.
I'm betternow, but...
It was so frightening that I don't think I'll ever quite forget it.
- Please, come here. - Thank you.
- Not at all. - Good-bye, thanks.
What do you think of placing it like this?
It's not perfectly vertical, but from below you can see it better.
Yes, of course, you're right.
Yeah, she was my girl so long.
Where are you going?
- You said "so long".
- I always said that.
If I don't I stutter.
- I see.
- What do you wanna know?
I'm trying to help the police find the killer.
That's good, so long.
But I don't know what to tell you.
They picked me up a week after
Rosita was murdered, poorkid.
There I am in jail and those girls have to get along without me.
No protection, with that monster loose on the streets.
- What've they got you in for?
- Nothing. I was framed.
They got it in forme. They say I'm aiding and abetting prostitution.
But I'm innocent. Look at me, do I look like a pimp?
Look me in the eyes, do I look like a guy who exploits women?
I got nothing against accepting present every now and then, right?
- Sure. Can you give me any help?
- It wasn't nobody in my bunch.
We don't play those games.
It must've been some rich guy.
You know, a gentleman.
They're the ones who get those kind ofideas.
These guys have a particular code ofhonor, which is very different from anything anybody else has.
- And this particular... - That man's been following us forhours.
He's Morosini's man, he's ourbodyguard.
It would appearthat this guy "So long" has got kind of a harem...
- Hey, taxi!
- Well, I feel like walking.
"So long" expects everything from women and nothing from men.
Stop!
No!
Run! Run!
All right, you wait here.
Go in there, it's me they're after.
When you get away, call Morosini.
- There's a guy with a gun afterme. - I don't see anyone.
- There he is!
- Who is he?
Mrs. Johnson.
Excuse me, have you seen a man with a yellow jacket and a blue cap?
- Yes, sir.
- Where did he go? - In there.
I gave his liver a good working over. To the tenth I laid him out.
Yeah, I rememberthat.
It's about time we began talking about some of the problems we face.
Pipe down, will you? There's the problem of the insurance coverage.
The indemnity forpermanent disability... Listen to me!
He had a glass jaw!
He died without consciousness.
Fractured spine and skull.
Do you think you could recognize him?
I didn't see his face clearly.
I want every man at that convention tracked down.
I want pictures, criminal records, every particularyou can dig out.
I want two of ourtop men detailed to coverthe two behind us, they're to be watched day and night.
I'm very sorry to have got you into this mess.
Take my advice, go back to the United States.
I feel that I'm getting closer to the truth every minute.
The murdereris obviously of the same opinion.
That's why he's trying to kill me.
The more he tries, the more he risks discovery.
Stop, let's see your driving license.
- We had great fun. - I'll arrange things so we can stay together.
- I love you.
- Me too.
- Bye!
- Bye, Gina.
The sons ofbitches, they really tried to get you, so long.
- Yeah. And I wanna find him.
- Sure, I'll help you, so long.
Let me think.
Yeah, that's it.
I know the guy foryou?
- Who? - He ain't cheap, but there's nothing he doesn't know.
- Okay.
- Hey!
This is strictly between you and me. No police, so long.
Don't worry.
Call the Caramba pull hall and ask for Faina. Say "So long" sent you.
Elevator, get an elevator...
- Who are you?
- I'm Faina.
Faina! Come on in!
I couldn't just made five flights.
I gotta work out.
- Who's that? - She's a friend, you can trust her.
- Here, sit down.
- No, thanks.
Now get this straight, I don't know anything, I don't know anybody.
And I don't see anything!
What do you want to know?
The othernight a man tried to kill me with a pistol and a silencer.
He got away and went to the Lux Hotel...
- What's the matter? - This place bugged? - No, now listen to me.
There was a convention of ex prize fighters. He was dressed like one.
- You want to turn him in, right?
- No, I wanna talk to him.
Can't help you... Hundred.
- Hundred what?
- Hundred thousand. - Oh, yeah!
Oh, come on!
Here.
No, keep it.
Ten, twenty, thirty... hundred.
- When will I hearfrom you?
- Never.
Maybe tomorrow morning.
Hello?
Yes?
Get smarter, Mr. Dalmas. Take my advice, mind your own business.
Stop playing detective.
It's not healthy.
That was a warning yesterday.
Wasn't it enough?
- What do you suggest I do?
- Go back to America.
Forget about the murders.
There is a limit to my patience!
- Who's speaking? - Is the girl there with you? - Yes.
She's young and very beautiful, would you like herto die?
Because if you don't drop everything I will kill her!
Go back to America. Forget about the murders. There's a limit...
Did you hearthat creaking sound?
I want to know what it is.
What makes a sound like that?
It's all we have to go on.
I'll find out.
Well.
What are you gonna do now?
I don't know. It was simplerwhen
I only had myself to think about.
Damn painting.
There's got to be a lead somewhere.
- Maybe the first victim looks like the woman. - Too roughly drawn.
It could be anybody.
- Hello? - This is Faina,
I couldn't find out anything.
But if you're interested there's an ex-fighternamed Needles.
He might know something.
Lives not farfrom yourplace.
- Via Angiolieri, 39.
- Via Angiolieri, 39.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Now look at it on the oscilloscope.
I wanted you to know how much I enjoyed yourtalk on TV.
Right.
Now we'll listen to the other one.
Be smart, take my advice, mind your own business.
Notice any difference between the tapes?
The waves on the first machine are different from those on the second.
Exactly, every human voice, no matterhow well it's disguised has a peculiarpattern ofharmonic intensities in the vowel sound.
When we analyzed the vowel groups of each of these two tapes, we made an unexpected discovery.
The first registered at 5 decibels on the lowerrange and 12 high, while the second reading it only barely registered to 4 and 10.
- The explanation? - The voices don't belong to the same person.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
- That means there are two killers! - It would seem so.
Unless it's one trying to confuse us by dragging a partnerin.
In that case, he was no doubt the one who tried to kill you.
- The one you found murdered. - Now we listen to the sound you gave us.
We isolated the sound and compared it with hundreds of similar ones.
We've exhausted the field of sounds produced by industrial machinery, factories, demolition sites, through to electric doors, cranes, coin operated machines, domestic appliances.
But so far, we've been unable to equate it.
- What now?
- All we can do is keep trying.
Okay, thank you.
- Sorry I won't be around forthe finish. - You're leaving?
Day aftertomorrow.
I've said that before, haven't I?
Forty pages in the last days. This adventure started me writing again.
- Glad to hearit. - It's broken me loose. Here, pack these too.
I'm writing frantically again.
- Whateverhappened to those leads you were following up? - Nothing.
Listen to this.
This came overthe telephone.
It'd have been a great lead if we could've figured out what it was.
Go back home. Forget the murders.
There is a limit to my patience.
- Is the girl there with you?
She's pretty... - Hold it!
Let me hearit again, will you?
Dalmas!
There's a limit to my patience.
- Is the girl there with you?
She's very... - Well?
I don't know, it reminds me of something.
- I guess I'm wrong.
- Great!
Wait a minute.
Leave it, I'll do it.
I don't believe it!
- I just can't believe it.
- What? - That we're leaving.
Listen, why don't I take the tape?
If I think of anything
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
So long!
These are the last few hours in this house.
Do you really love me?
- Sure. How much time have we got? - How much what?
- How long till the plane leaves?
- Eight hours. Why?
That may be just enough.
What do you want to do now? Sam!
- Hello! Is this the Trouvaille?
- Yes.
I'm Dalmas, I borrowed the picture of the painting of that murder.
- Yes, I remember you were so charming. - Yes.
- Can you tell me the name of the artist? - Sure, Berto Consalvi.
Berto Consalvi.
- Where can I find him? - He lives in a town not farfrom here.
- It's about an hour and a half by train. - What's the name ofit?
- Aviano. - Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, it's a pleasure.
I can just make it,
I've got to talk to that painter.
The first girl was murdered just afterhe sold that painting.
There's gotta be a connection. I'll be back in 5 hours. Finish packing.
There's no need to worry so long as you don't leave the house.
Two detectives are watching the door. Bolt it and don't open it.
- I love you. - I never should have believed you. I'm a fool!
If you need anything, call
Morosini. You know the number. No!
- Thanks forthe lift. It would've been some walk! - You're welcome.
Get out ofhere, the man's crazy.
You neverknow what'll happen next.
- Thanks forthe advice.
- Follow it!
If you wanna carry on, you don't need to go looking forthe door.
He'd been walled up, the whole building, doors, windows.
- There's got a way to get in it.
- It doesn't mean he'll let you in.
If yourface ain't right, he'd tell you what you can do with it!
Consalvi?
Berto Consalvi?
- Go to blazes.
- I want to buy a painting.
- What do you want it for?
- Formy house.
Hey!
- Why did you wall up yourhouse?
- To keep out the busybodies.
Nobody gets in here unless I want them to! Besides there are cats.
Who told you about me?
Nobody, I saw one of yourpaintings. I liked it.
- What was it? - It was one about a murdererkilling a girl.
I don't do that crap anymore.
I'm going through a mystical period.
- I only paint mystical scenes.
- Why?
Why? Because I feel mystical.
Lfit's any of your damn business.
No, no, it's not.
- What was yourinspiration for that painting? - You wanna eat?
Yeah.
That was a real story a long time ago.
Thanks, that's fine.
- How long?
- Ten years, more orless.
A maniac got hold of a girl I knew.
He tried to cut herup.
I just stopped him in time.
They put him in an asylum forlife.
Genius!
Hey, you want to buy a painting ornot?
- Do you?
- Yeah. Sure.
Come with me.
I got just the thing.
Early Consalvi, very rare!
Hey! Shut the window!
There you are! Got you!
Naughty Theodore.
Blasted cats, crafty creatures.
They always manage to find a hole to slip through and they're always away in a flash.
- Why do you lock them up? - The less they move the fatterthey get.
- Why do you wanna them to get fat? - Why?
I eat them.
- Oh, no! - What's the matter?
Don't you like cats?
I don't know. I never ate any.
Never, huh?
- Here, take this one.
Two hundred thousand. - Oh, no!
- No? Alright, one hundred and fifty. - Oh, no!
- A hundred!
- Oh, no!
Fifty thousand!
Get lost!
- Hello? - You still mad at me?
- Where are you?
- I'm at the station in Aviano on my way home. - How did it go?
I talked to him, but I didn't go anywhere.
There's a railway strike, I'll be about an hour and a halflate.
- What about the plane? - Don't worry I'll be there in time.
- Everything okay?
- Yes. - Carlo phoned.
- He discovered something.
- What? - He didn't say.
I told him you had left and you'd call him as soon as you get back.
Sam...
Sam.
Sam?
You won't leave this house alive.
Help! Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Giulia? Giulia!
Giulia!
Sam?
- How do you feel?
- Alright. Did they get him?
No, he must've slipped out through the cellar or something.
What time is it?
Just after 4:30.
You slept around the clock.
Peeping Tom, huh? So sorry!
You were supposed to call me, you know? I've got news foryou.
The phone's been out of order.
I think I've finally figured out what that cracking sound is.
- It's peculiar. - What is it?
- The call of the Hornitus Nevalis.
A magnificent bird with long white feathers that look like glass.
What's so strange about it?
The only place in the world that bird can live is Northern Siberia.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
How about a drink? I deserve one.
It's almost impossible to keep one of those birds alive in captivity.
There's only one specimen in Italy and that has to be kept...
- What's the matterwith you?
- Wait a minute.
- You mean there's one here?
- That's what I try to tell you.
It's practically a miracle but they're managing to keep one alive.
- Where? - Where else would you keep a rare bird? The zoo.
- The cage is nearthe back of the zoo. - It's quite a walk.
It's not farnow.
They have to keep it isolated.
It doesn't get along with the other animals. They have to move it.
It can't even stand the smell of them. There it is!
Ranieri! He called from his flat.
I remembernow.
The telephone's right next to that window.
Monica!
Come on, Giulia!
- Open the door!
- Right, leave it to us!
Give me the knife!
- Don't shoot.
- Let her go. - There's no way out.
Give yourself up.
- You can't get away.
- Drop the knife. - No!
- Don't move. There is no way out.
- No!
Drop the knife!
Keep away from me.
Keep away!
- That's enough!
- What has happened?
- Where'd he get you?
- Giulia! Come on!
Save me!
Please! I don't want to die!
Help me! I don't want to die!
I can't hold him.
Yes, it's true, I'm the murderer.
I killed all of them.
Please, take care of my wife.
She tried to stop me.
I loved her.
Poor devil, I feel sorry forhim.
Morosini here, put me through the homicide.
- Have you seen the girl I was with? - No, she was behind us.
- Isn't she here? - No.
Have you seen her since then?
No, I haven't.
Thanks.
- Have you seen a girl with blond hair? - She came down a while ago.
- Sure? Which way did she go?
- She ran offin that direction.
- With two others.
- Thanks.
His head busted open like a watermelon!
Excuse me, have you seen a girl go by in that direction with blond hair and a gray raincoat came down to about here?
Sure.
Have you seen a girl with blond hair and a gray raincoat?
- I saw her going there. - In that door? - That's what I said.
Thanks.
- This one here?
- Yes.
Carlo! Oh, my God!
What have you done with Giulia?
Answerme!
It was you!
It's the otherway around.
Like a knife in yourhand. You were trying to kill yourhusband.
It was the otherway around.
That's what I knew I've seen!
Help me.
Help me.
Now you're going to die!
You're going to die!
You're going to die!
Like all the others.
Right, come on, quick. Now, one at each end. That's it, now lift!
That's enough, hold it!
No, I'll pull you.
That's it. Are you alright?
- How did you find out?
- Giulia.
Giulia?
Yes, she'll be alright.
And you'll be alright too.
Come on, I'll help you up.
As inspector Morosini, in charge of the investigations, had told you, the final curtain fell on what kept the city in a state of shock.
Monica Ranieri is in custody at the psychiatric hospital.
Herhusband lost his life in a last attempt to turn suspicion on him.
What lead this unbalanced creatures to commit horrible murders?
Good evening. Sorry.
The person best qualified to answer this question is Professor Renoldi, the well known psychiatrist who was our consultant during the inquiry.
- Please, would you explain?
- Certainly.
Forthe moment we can only make conjectures.
Ten years ago Monica Ranieri, who had evident paranoid tendencies, was brutally attacked and suffered a severe trauma.
Still, she recovered sufficiently to return to a normal life.
Hermental disturbance remained dormant forten years.
Until she came across a painting which depicted the horrible scene.
Herlatent madness came to life violent and irresistible.
She didn't identify herself as depicted, but with her attacker.
In orderto explain the behavior ofherhusband, who attempted murder to protect his wife, we must assume that he suffered from an induced psychosis.
He was influenced by his wife to become homicidally psychotic.
I can hearhim saying it now: "Go to Italy it's a peaceful country".
"Nothing everhappens there."
Good night, John.
- Good evening, Your Excellency.
- Good evening, Mrs. Russel.
Did the...? Did the meeting go well?
Oh, very well, indeed.
In fact, I feel certain now that the opera gala will be a triumph.
Isn't that marvelous?
It's so exciting, so ecumenical, so...
Precisely. Good night, Mrs. Russel.
Good night, Your Excellency.
Great.
Perfect. Is that a shot?
Thank you.
- Janet, hi!
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello, how are you?
- You look so lovely.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations on your...
And I have no intention...
Excuse me.
Uh-oh. There we go.
My fault. Very much my fault.
Hey, come over here.
I wanna talk to you.
Sit down.
Now, what's this about you leaving?
I wanna take a ride along the coast, and then I have to get back to the city.
And don't worry.
I promise I'll be here for your wedding.
You better. I need you.
So, what's going on tonight?
Oh, nothing special.
I'm gonna go to a movie.
- By yourself?
- Yes.
Gloria, this has got to stop.
Just because you've had one bad experience doesn't mean that you give up.
I haven't given up.
I came to this party, didn't I?
Ever since the divorce, you lock yourself in that library and hide behind those glasses.
Look at you.
You used to be a cheerleader.
You used to show some cleavage.
- What?
- Let's see some skin.
Shake your booty, take some chances.
- What are you playing, old maid?
- I'm not playing anything.
That's the trouble.
- OK. OK, I get the message.
- Sure, you do.
Now, take tonight. Why don't you go out there and mingle, pick someone...
Oh, just a second.
- She's right, you know.
- What?
Nice party. Lot of chances.
Didn't anyone ever tell you that eavesdropping is not nice?
My single worst problem as a child.
I'll never forget my mother and parole officer getting together with the priest
- and discussing the difficulties I had...
- Excuse me. I've gotta go.
You're gonna love this. Hey, come on,
I'm sorry. I was just kidding around.
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
Yes, and it seems to be in your mouth.
OK, I deserve that.
But listen, it's Gloria, right?
You're a really nice girl, and I'm a nice guy, and you're very pretty with or without cleavage and...
What do you say?
Would you like to take a shower?
- I don't pick up strange men.
- Well, that's your problem.
So why don't you try it?
~ When you go for it
Well... ~
Hi. Thanks.
I'm really in a bind.
I've gotta be in the city by 5.
- Well, I'm going to...
- Thanks.
OK.
- What was wrong with your car?
- Radiator.
Oh, too bad. Do you live in the city?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
- So do I. It's fun, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Looks like we might have some rain.
Of course, you never know with San Francisco weather.
One day it's wet and foggy, and three hours later it's bright sunshine.
- What's your name?
- Gloria.
- That's a pretty name.
- Thank you.
Mine's Bob Scott.
Everybody calls me Scotty.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's really nice to meet you.
It's not every day I get rescued by a girl in a yellow convertible.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.
Yeah. I'm trying to give them up myself.
- You'll live longer.
- Yeah.
That's my plan.
- Come on, Gloria. It'll be fun.
- Oh, I don't know.
Look, I'll meet you in front of the theater.
- Where'd you say it was?
- The Nuart on Union Street.
Come on, Gloria, take a chance.
What have you got to lose?
I'll buy the popcorn.
Oh, all right.
But it is a retrospective, you know.
Hey, I love old movies.
Damn it. Three left.
Gloria, do me a favor.
Would you hold these for me till this evening?
I'm trying to keep it down to a pack a day.
- OK, if it'll help.
- It will be a big help, believe me.
Out of sight, out of mind.
I'll just put them in your purse.
Gee, gotta run.
- See you at the movies.
- Eight o'clock sharp.
Well, hello, there. I didn't think you were gonna make it.
I know, the weather's awful outside.
That's why I bought my ticket and came on in.
Cigarettes?
Oh, I don't think they let you smoke in here, Scotty.
Here, have some popcorn.
Go ahead, take it. I'm finished.
- The film.
- Oh, well, you haven't missed much.
You see the man in the overcoat?
He's waiting for the Chinese sailor, the one Alan Ladd thinks kidnapped the old gypsy.
But the secretary told the cab driver that...
Wait a minute.
There's going to be a murder.
Oh, I'm sure of it.
The police... Contact the police.
Well, actually, the cab driver is with the police.
Except the Chinese sailor doesn't know that.
What?
The Dwarf.
Beware of The Dwarf.
Gee, Scotty, I don't think there is a dwarf in this movie.
Scotty? Are you all right? Scotty?
Come quickly!
There's a man dead in there!
- Where?
- In there!
I'm sorry.
You'll have to see the manager.
- Where is he?
- In his office.
But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
- Handsome Harry...
- Are you the manager?
Yes.
Quickly. A man's been killed!
- Killed? What? Where?
- In there!
Stop the film. Call the police.
Fred, turn off the projector.
Put on the houselights.
- Quickly, come with me.
- Not in my theater.
Harry!
All right! OK!
- He's gone.
- What the hell is this?
- I mean, my date. He was right here.
- Who?
My date. He was right here.
I swear.
Your date is the one who's supposed to be dead?
Yes. He was sitting right next to me.
I gave him my popcorn. Where is it?
OK. All right, lady.
Just come with me.
- All right! We'll have it on in a minute.
- You've got to believe me.
- Yeah.
- Did you see my date?
Look, we'll talk about it in the lobby, huh?
- I believe you, really.
- Did you see my date? Did you...?
Come on. We'll talk in the lobby. OK!
All right!
You tell Fred to start that projector and bring down those houselights!
You've gotta believe me!
Lady, you made a fool out of me in there!
I saw you out front.
- You didn't have any date.
- No, he came in late.
He was all wet and bleeding.
Sylvia. Where you going, honey?
Look, I'm sorry, Harry.
Intermission's in 20 minutes, and I gotta go warm up the weenies.
But, Sylvia... Sylvia.
He said, "Beware of the dwarf."
Dwarf? Listen...
...why don't you do me and you a great big favor.
Why don't you just go home and sleep this whole thing off.
I don't understand. He was dead.
I don't know what could have happened to him.
Listen. You shouldn't go to picture shows like this and smoke that stuff if it's gonna affect you the way it does, huh?
Dingbat!
Oh, Mr. Hennesey. It's you.
Whatever happened to you, my darling?
- You look like you've seen the dead.
- I have.
In that case, come inside.
Tell me about it.
We'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
But it was so real. And that warning about the murder was so sinister.
Well, my darling, Gloria, people just don't drop dead in cinemas, watching horror movies and whispering, "Look out for the elf."
It was, "Beware of the dwarf."
Well, whatever.
He was playing a prank, that lad.
So you shouldn't take it so seriously.
- Well, he did act rather strangely.
- Well, you see?
So you don't think I should call the police?
The police? Whatever for?
I don't know.
I just have this strange feeling that somebody's trying to kill me.
To kill yous? Well, you gonna call the police and tell them that you have a strange feeling?
I mean, they got killings of their own to worry about, you know?
You're probably right.
They have killings and executions and assassinations.
I think it's time we made
"murder" a four-letter word.
- Would you have a cookie?
- OK.
- They're good.
- Aren't they?
Well, when you've been an anthropologist as long as I have, you're working most of the time in the field.
You acquire what my old father used to call "culinary expertise".
I remember in Africa, in Kenya,
I was studying the Ibutu tribe, fascinating society, and we could take a leaf from their book, if they had books.
But they did have this wizened old witch doctor, and his name was Kiyato, and he was a pretty good cook.
Here, I've got a picture of him.
I'll show you.
Esme! Get away from those cookies!
Esme, get away!
Get away from that! Hear?
Oh, poor Esme. You frightened her.
Well, she's getting too uppity.
She steals me out of house and home.
Don't you, you wicked girl?
Don't you?
Where was I? Yes, the Ibutu.
This is a commendable society.
It has severe taboos on murder and light taboos on sex.
Thank you, Mr. Hennesey.
You've been wonderful.
Well, you're my favorite tenant.
And if anything disturbs you in the middle of the night, you just scream and I'll be upstairs in a flash, kicking ass.
Good night, I'll remember that.
Esme...
Pope Pius XIII, on the first leg of his American tour,
today addressed a special meeting
of the United Nations
General Assembly in New York.
Stressing the urgency of world peace and international harmony,
the smiling 72-year-old pontiff received a warm reception
with the U.N. delegates frequently breaking into spontaneous applause
during his speech.
New York is the first of five stops for His Holiness in this country.
He'll meet with the president and congressional leaders tomorrow
in the nation's capital, then travel to Chicago and Los Angeles,
with a final stop here in San
Francisco, before flying on to Japan.
Vice president Abernathy arrives in Guam tonight,
ready to begin talks tomorrow with foreign ministers
of the now defunct SEATO pact.
The purpose of the new meetings is to establish a new framework...
- You wanna have lunch today?
- Yeah.
Listen, I got a lot to tell you.
- Oh, yeah? What?
- I'll tell you at lunch.
Really, Gloria. Do you know the percentage of rapes from hitchhikers?
- Have you any idea?
- No.
Plenty. And look at you, with no protection.
Well, now, he didn't seem to be after sex.
Rape is not an act of sex.
Rape is an act of violence.
Remember that.
Suppose that guy attacked you instead of pulling that weird stunt in the theater, huh?
What would you have done?
I would have hit him with my umbrella.
Talk about ancient.
Really, honey, you gotta drag yourself into the '70s.
You gotta get some merchandise.
You see this?
It's called "The Screamer".
They make a grab for your tits, you just flick the switch.
Then you got your mace. Zap.
Right in the face.
And finally, for infighting, the punch of power.
Crunch. Right in the nuts.
You certainly are prepared.
Nobody's gonna mess with Stella unless Stella wants to be messed.
I don't know, all this stuff...
Gloria, sweetheart, we live in a violent society. Weirdoes all around.
Get them before they get you.
- Good night, Mrs. Monk.
- Oh, good night.
- Taking your work home with you?
- Oh, yes.
I'm on to a fascinating sleuth, you know, research is so exciting.
- Well, you're the best. Good night.
- Oh, well. Good night.
Oh, by the way, Gloria,
I almost forgot.
While you were out to lunch, someone was inquiring for you.
He said he knew your pastor and would get in touch with you later.
A nice little man. You know, a dwarf.
Well, good night again.
Oh, you frightened me.
I thought you were a dwarf.
You gave me quite a shock.
The library is closed.
Didn't you hear the bell? Oh, well.
Doesn't matter.
Anyway, I've already locked the front.
You can go out the back with me if you want, but I just have a few things to do before...
That way!
- Take me home.
- What?
Take me home, please.
Sure.
- My place or...? Or yours?
- Which is closer?
Well, I have a little pad just around the corner.
Perfect.
- Do you mind if I finish my drink?
- Oh, no! Please. Do you have to?
No. No, I don't have to, Miss...
Mundy. Gloria Mundy.
Moria Glun... Moria Glundy.
- Can we go out the back way?
- The back way.
Fine with me, Gloria.
Anything you say.
My name is Stanley Tibbets.
Do you go to these bars often, Gloria?
I mean, not that there's anything wrong with that. I mean, human desire...
It's a fascinating thing.
I mean, take me for instance.
I... I have an interesting job.
I... I work for the city.
- But every now and then...
- Couldn't we walk just a little faster?
Oh, you seem to be in a hurry.
Not that I object.
I mean, God, any man would love a woman who lays it on the line.
Take, for instance, the average woman, who takes two weeks of dinners before you even get to first base.
I mean, I've been in America for two years, and...
- Mr. Tibbets, please!
- Oh, call me Stanley.
Here it is, my own little beaver trap.
Oh, don't turn the lights on just yet.
I'll go and close the curtains.
Oh, sure thing, baby.
Anything you say.
How's that?
Oh, listen. I don't want you to think that
I'm acting too strangely, but I have to...
No, no, no, no. No, I understand.
Make yourself comfortable.
- Oh, thank you.
- Let me get you a drink.
- That would be nice. Thank you.
- What would you like?
I've got it all.
I don't know.
Leave it to me. I know just the thing for your mood.
How about that music?
- Fine.
- Great beat.
- Yes.
- Hidden speakers. Quadraphonic.
- Really?
- Yeah, I got it all.
Here we are, foxy loxy.
- Gloria.
- Gloria.
- Tastes like Tabasco.
- It's called Spanish fly.
I've never had it before.
Well, I know a few people...
...in Spain.
What about that, then?
- Look, Mr. Tibb...
- Stanley.
Stanley, I hope you don't mind that I stay here just a moment.
- I just wanna make sure...
- No. No need for explanations.
Listen, as you say over here,
"You're put on this world to do your thing.
"I'm put on this world to do my thing.
"And if, perchance, our things...
"...do...
"...meet...
"...that's... That's groovy."
- I just wanna look out the window.
- Fine. Fine.
Do you...? Do you mind if I make myself comfortable?
- Huh? No.
- No!
Do you have any binoculars?
What'd you say? Binoculars?
Are you into that too? Me as well.
I read about it in Penthouse.
Just a second.
Here you are, sweet thing.
- Thank you.
- Anything you want, doll face.
I got it all.
OK, Gloria!
What are we waiting for?
Oh, my God!
What's the matter, baby?
Well, what is this?
What are you doing?
Why are you undressed?
I don't believe it!
Did you think that I...?
Didn't you want to...?
Stanley, really.
- Where did you get the idea that...?
- It was just a bit of fun.
You know, a... A few laughs.
- What's this on the wall?
- That is... nothing.
It's... a training film.
It's purely educational.
- And what's over here?
- Oh, God!
Oh, my God. Did you...?
Where did you find all this stuff?
I'm sorry, I don't do this very often.
I never knew there was such diversity.
- Please come back!
- It's amazing, just amazing.
- I got this for my nieces.
- Oh...
- No, I... I borrowed it for a party.
- Here, here, let me do that for you.
- Maybe I should call you a cab.
- Yes, please.
Mr. Hennesey?
Formal sentencing will be in two weeks.
It's expected he will be given the maximum penalty.
Continuing on his international goodwill tour, Pope Pius XIII
arrived today in Washington for an informal visit with the president.
The two talked for more than an hour, after which the pontiff was honored
at a huge White House reception attended by what appeared to be
nearly every major dignitary in the nation's capital...
... world peace and universal brotherhood.
Next up, the vice president arrives in San Francisco.
But first, this message.
~ Plop, plop, fizz, fizz
Oh, what a relief it is ~
~ Plop, plop, fizz, fizz
Oh, what a relief it is ~
Come over here.
Where is it?
- Where is it?
- What?
Lady... I don't want any trouble.
Just give me what
Scott gave you yesterday.
But he gave me nothing.
What did he give you in the car?
I swear he gave me nothing except a pack of cigarettes.
- Where are they?
- In my purse.
Where's your purse? Where?
Over there, on the couch.
OK, stay.
No...
Hello? Police?
Oh, something terrible's happened.
What?
A murder. I wanna report a murder.
Oh, all right, but hurry!
Hello? Yes.
A man broke into my apartment, and I think I've killed him!
Well, no.
No, it happened just now.
Just now, I came home and he was here.
What? What?
Oh, all right, I'll hold on, but hurry!
Gloria Mundy.
430 Vallejo, second-floor apartment.
Please, come right away...
Oh, no!
No! No!
Hello. How you feeling?
You. What are you doing here?
They're from the police.
Are you all right?
I'm inspector Ferguson, ma'am, and this is my sometime partner,
Lieutenant Carlson.
They said you'd called about a murder.
I had to break the lock.
The body! Where's the body?
- What body?
- The dead body!
It was right there!
Didn't you see it?
Who?
And the phone...
And the window...
Oh, my God, it happened again.
- What's happened again?
- Just like last night.
- Just like in the movie theater.
- What?
The dead body.
It's gone! It vanished!
Well, maybe it was embarrassed.
Come on in here.
I think you better sit down.
But you don't understand.
The body has disappeared.
- Whose body was it?
- I don't know.
A man with a scar.
He tried to murder me, but I stabbed him with the needles.
Oh, narcotics, huh?
No, knitting. And...
Oh, I put them back in the basket.
And the poker too.
Or did you do that?
Hey, relax.
All we did was get an emergency call on a homicide.
We got here, broke in the door with your landlord, and found you unconscious on the kitchen floor.
I carried you to the couch...
- You carried me?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
And you woke up insisting that there's a dead body around here.
Look, I know it sounds strange, but somebody cleaned the place up.
- And took away the dead body?
- Right.
Wait a minute!
I've got it!
It must have been the albino.
Who's the albino?
He's the one who killed the man with the scar.
You said you killed the man with the scar.
I did. Except he killed him after I killed him.
See, I didn't really kill him.
I just stabbed him with the needles.
Right after he heard the cuckoo.
Oh, you don't believe me, do you?
But it's true. It really happened.
You believe me, don't you,
Mr. Hennesey?
My darling, if you believe it,
I believe it.
There's some very mixed-up people out there.
They're puny spirits with small minds.
Like that man told you in the movies last night,
"Beware of the midgets.
They're taking over the world."
Mr. Hennesey, he didn't.
He said, "Beware of the dwarf!"
A dwarf?
Well, whatever. Now, you're not to worry about anything.
I'm here to make sure that you're safe. In fact...
...l'm going to put a brand-new lock on this door, right now.
A big one, yeah.
Oh, he doesn't believe me.
He thinks I've been dreaming or something.
Don't be silly.
Gloria...
...did you drop acid a little earlier tonight?
No. No, you don't understand!
A man tried to kill me here tonight.
- The albino?
- No, no!
- The man with the scar?
- Yes!
See, the albino tried to kill me earlier,
- but I smashed him with my umbrella.
- Your umbrella?
I'd never met the man with the scar before.
Unless he's the one that was driving that black limousine.
Why did he wanna kill you?
- Who?
- Man with the scar.
I'm not sure, but I think it was because of the cigarettes.
- He wanted a cigarette, or...?
- No, he wanted the whole pack.
Kind of greedy.
The albino must have wanted the cigarettes too.
So he killed the man with the scar to get them.
Right.
And I'll bet he's the one who killed Scotty.
- Scotty?
- Who's Scotty?
Look, Gloria...
...I know you've been through something here tonight, real or imagined. But I just wanna bring you down to earth a bit.
You gotta see how absurd this whole thing is.
We have no dead body, there's been no sign of violence.
Our suspects are albinos and chain-smokers.
Wait a minute! I've got it!
The albino is working for the dwarf.
I tell you, I've been on some dumb calls in my time, but this one tops them.
Where'd you meet this ding-dong, anyway?
What's all that stuff about having her for lunch down at the station house tomorrow?
You're not even supposed to be riding around with me.
- It's fate, Fergie. Kismet.
- Kismet, my ass.
- Listen, this girl is weird, Tony.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But she's got the prettiest green eyes
I've ever seen.
Yeah, they're blue.
And behind those blue eyes is a fruitcake with a homicidal umbrella.
- Wait a minute!
- What?
You have the prettiest green eyes I've ever seen.
Cut that out.
I hate it when you do that.
- Don't do that anymore, all right?
- Let's go, beautiful.
Gloria, I don't believe you.
How can you be so gullible?
You have got albinos chasing you down the street, prowlers breaking into your apartment.
Don't you see?
They're only after one thing.
- They wanna get into your pants.
- I don't think so.
And now you have this cop inviting you down to the station house on your lunch hour.
Do you think he's not gonna try for a little nookie?
He's really nice.
- Gloria, I'm your friend, right?
- Right.
And I wouldn't steer you wrong, would I?
No.
Take these.
Without them, you are a walking light bulb waiting to be screwed.
Let's see. One, two, five, six.
Six.
They used to have the most beautiful dude ranch near Phoenix.
"Happy Trails", I think they called it.
Of course, this was before the war.
Here we are, with a 13 and a Double Word Score.
- That makes 26.
- Twenty-six.
Ever see that Arizona Highways?
Oh, it is the most beautiful magazine, isn't it?
Let me see, now...
One, two, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, four... 15.
Such lovely pictures.
I wonder if they still put it out.
Why, I see them now and again at the library.
And here we go.
Eight, nine, ten, 11...
And double that...
We have 15, we have 26, and double is...
- Fifty-two!
- Wait, Elsie.
I think you're wrong.
I think you spell that word with a hyphen.
Really?
I was just taking a shot.
There she is!
Oh, no.
Oh, yes. They tried it again.
Gloria, just sit back and enjoy the fire.
I'm pouring you a nice, warm albino martini.
Here you go.
Drink this, and it's off to bed.
You should have been a doctor.
OK, we'll play whatever you like.
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, go right ahead.
You know, it's funny.
My father was a doctor.
- Wanted me to be one too.
- What happened?
Well, I went to medical school.
It was tough. All those books.
Then I joined the paramedics.
That was tougher.
Besides... I always had a yearning for the criminal life.
- But you're a cop.
- Same difference.
- How's the milk?
- It's great.
- Lieutenant...
- Tony.
I don't understand.
Last night, you didn't believe the story I told you, did you?
- I believed that you believed it.
- What about tonight?
Did you believe I was kidnapped?
I know the address of the building they held me in.
- It seems that...
- Look,
I promise I'll check that out first thing in the morning.
And the license plate of the black limousine, 121 TCE.
- Got it.
- Tony, I'm not lying.
No one thinks you are.
Why would anybody wanna kill me?
Hey.
Come on.
You're safe here.
I checked all the windows and the doors, everything.
You trust me, don't you?
Here, finish your milk.
Good girl. Full?
- Feel better, don't you?
- Yes.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Oh, I'm not working tomorrow.
I'm home.
Fine.
Would you like me to carry you to your bedroom?
No, thanks. I can walk.
OK, then I'm gonna take off.
Don't worry, Gloria.
If there really is somebody out there trying to kill you,
I promise you, we'll find out who and why.
Well, the room checks out.
Nobody up there.
Landlord said it's been empty for months.
It's rented on a yearly basis to a guy called... Stiltskin.
Stiltskin...
I've heard that name somewhere before.
Oh, no.
I thought when you were suspended,
I'd have a three-week vacation.
I was framed.
You're lucky you've still got your badge.
Arresting the mayor for speeding and then cuffing him.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm telling you, he was wearing eye makeup.
Get out of here!
Hey, listen, this is serious.
What was that story, wasn't too long ago, about a guy named Stiltskin?
You been talking to Donahue?
No, why?
You know this guy?
Yeah, I've seen him around.
Works undercover, right?
He did. His name's Bob Scott.
And we just fished his body out of the bay.
Scotty.
Yeah, he was working on a tip that a major assassination is gonna take place here in the city, Thursday night.
- Tomorrow night.
- The biggest hit man west of Chicago has been hired for the job.
His name is Stiltskin,
Rupert Stiltskin.
Stiltskin?
Yeah, alias "The Dwarf".
Holy shit.
Oh, no. He's nice, really.
He brought me home last night, and...
And then he had the police bring my car back this morning.
- Who is it?
- Special delivery.
Just a second, Stella.
Somebody's at the door.
- Miss Mundy?
- Yes.
Just a moment.
Hiya, toots.
I've been looking forward to this meeting for some time.
- You... You're a dwarf.
- True, true.
J.J. MacKuen's my name, and life's my game.
Not life insurance, but life everlasting.
Interested?
- Oh, my God.
- Sure you are.
Please. If I'm gonna do this right,
I've got to have your undivided attention.
She'll call you right back.
You... You're the dwarf.
Well, actually, we prefer to be called "little people".
It was you who was asking for me at the library.
True, true. But, unfortunately, our paths didn't cross.
No matter.
Today, I have brought with me a little present that my employer wants you to have.
And all that is required of you is to consider the possibility of coming closer to God.
Keep away from me!
Miss Mundy, why take this attitude?
I'm merely a salesman of the divine Word.
Look upon me as an instrument who will release you from the worries of the world and bring you the promise of eternal rest.
Keep away from me.
Miss Mundy...
...do you believe in life after death?
Somebody help me!
Stop this thing!
Please, help! Oh, my goodness.
- Gloria.
- Tony!
Gloria, what are you doing?
Did you see him? That was him.
That was the dwarf.
That's who Scotty told me about.
He tried to kill me.
Oh, I knew he was out to get...
"The New American Bible.
The translation you can believe in."
"J.J. MacKuen."
Oh, he was a Bible salesman?
You mean I...?
That's right, honey.
You have attacked an innocent dwarf.
X-ray technician, please call extension...
Mr. MacKuen?
It's Gloria Mundy.
- Who?
- Remember me?
You came to see me this morning.
Oh.
How are you feeling?
So-so.
Thanks for the flowers.
Oh, that's all right.
My pleasure.
Here, I bought you some more.
I felt it was the least I could do.
I'm awfully sorry.
Well, I was thinking of leaving the job anyway.
Oh, really?
Yeah, I never should have taken it.
I'm too pushy. I annoy people.
That's my personality.
And you can't move merchandise like that anymore.
They... They look like lovely Bibles to me.
Oh, they're top quality.
It's me that's no good.
I come off too strong.
Well, you did give me quite a shock.
You don't have to apologize.
I'm a putz.
Oh, no, Mr. MacKuen.
I think you're being a little hard on yourself.
Well, maybe everything will turn out for the best.
Really.
I always feel that you can see a positive side to everything.
Yeah. I was thinking of opening up a gas station in the desert and I think you helped me make up my mind.
I'm so glad I could help.
Oh, no!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just gonna kill a fly.
I'm sorry.
- Well, I guess I better be going.
- OK.
I'll come back tomorrow after work.
Oh, no, no. I'm sure I'm gonna be out of here by tomorrow.
Oh.
All right.
Well, it was nice meeting you again. Bye.
Oh, that poor little man.
To think that I was responsible, that I was capable, that all that violence is within me.
Yeah, I know.
And lucky for him, you didn't have your umbrella.
Come on, let's go.
Tony's waiting for you at the station.
Gloria, I need your help.
Somebody's gonna be murdered tomorrow night, and we gotta prevent it.
I want you to take a look at something.
- You recognize these people?
- That's the man with the scar.
- Right.
- That's the albino.
Right, his name is Whitey Jackson.
- I don't know.
- That's Rupert Stiltskin, alias "The Dwarf". He's the head of the assassination team.
Scarface wanted to double-cross his buddies and gave Scotty some evidence about tomorrow's job.
They found out about it, killed Scotty.
Scarface wanted to protect himself.
Tried to get the evidence back.
But they were onto him.
They killed him.
So the evidence was in the cigarette package that Scotty gave me.
- Right.
- Well, but they took the cigarette pack when they took Scarface's body.
- Right.
- Then what do they still want me for?
I don't know, but they do.
And that's why I've been assigned to protect you.
You have?
Well, what does that entail?
The usual.
We move into your house, set up a round-the-clock surveillance and send out for pizza.
I traced the number on that black limousine.
- Great!
- What is it?
You're not gonna like it.
It's registered to the archbishop of San Francisco.
Fancy layout.
- Yes?
- Lieutenant Carlson, ma'am.
Is Archbishop Thorncrest in?
Just wanna ask him a couple of questions.
Certainly.
Won't you please come in?
That's right.
We really expect almost everyone to be seated when the motorcade arrives.
Of course.
Exactly.
Well, thank you.
And thank you so much for calling.
Goodbye.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Lieutenant Carlson.
This is Inspector Ferguson.
This is Miss Mundy.
Very happy to meet you.
Please, sit down.
Now, what is it
I can do for you?
We're investigating a black limousine...
Oh, you found the car.
Good news.
- Did you catch that rascal, Turk?
- Who?
Turk Farnum, the man who stole the car.
Don't tell me he got away.
We've had no report that the car was stolen.
No report? But yesterday I...
- Miss Casswell?
- I'm sorry, Your Excellency.
I thought I'd give him one more day to come back.
- After all, he's such a...
- Really, Miss Casswell.
The car has been gone two days.
Now, I think somewhere we have to draw the line on christian charity.
Could you describe this Turk?
- Large, heavyset.
- Bald?
Yes. He came to us as a chauffeur about...
- What was it? Three months ago?
- Yes.
From St. Damien's halfway house.
You see, he's an ex-convict.
We'd have a file on him.
- What's his present address?
- He lived above the garage.
Miss Casswell, why don't you show the lieutenant Turk's quarters.
Maybe they'll come up with something.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Would you come this way, please?
Miss Casswell, then come right back here.
I want to have a word with you.
He was such a nice man.
A little simple, perhaps.
But then, he had very little education.
You see, no one was ever kind to him.
Throughout his whole life, no one had ever given him a chance.
- There's nothing around here, Tony.
- OK.
Miss Casswell, does the name
Stiltskin mean anything to you?
- No.
- How about Whitey Jackson?
Is he that football player that wears the pantyhose on television?
No.
Well.
Now the shit has really hit the fan.
Oh, Stella, he's not like that at all.
- I like him.
- How's he feel about you?
- I think he likes me.
- Oh.
That's OK. If they say
"I like you", it's not so bad.
It's when they say "I love you" that you gotta watch out.
Listen, I have to go.
Just have Mrs. Monk see what she can come up with.
They've never heard of it around here.
OK, Gloria. Be careful.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Mrs. Monk, what do you know about the Tax the Churches League?
Well, I'm calling it a day.
Any more news on Turk?
We've checked everything on his file.
All known associates, places he frequents, clubs, bars...
Nothing so far.
Well, I just asked my girlfriend at the library to find out about the
Tax the Churches League.
That's a funny group for Turk to belong to.
Hey, I play detective.
You play lady in distress.
Hey, wait a minute.
It's my ass they're after.
I'm sorry. You're right.
That was a stupid, glib, chauvinist remark and I apologize.
It is your ass they're after, and it's my job to see to it that I get there first.
What do you say to two juicy steaks and a bottle of wine?
Well, you could start by saying "hello".
I'm gonna take you home.
OK, Fergie, listen.
If anything should come up, you know where to get ahold of me.
Right. Good night.
Hey, this is the way to the bridge.
I thought you said you were gonna take me home.
I did.
My home.
Oh, you're really full of surprises.
I never met anybody who ever lived on a houseboat before.
That's fantastic.
Well, my brother built it, and when he got married,
I moved in.
It's so beautiful here.
Yeah, on a clear day you can see Alcatraz.
How nice.
Be careful here.
It's very slippery at night
- on the gangplank.
- OK.
- Hold onto something.
- OK.
You OK?
- Nice fire.
- I just turned on the switch.
- Come here.
- Hey. Hi, little one.
- Hi, little dog.
- Hey, Chaucer, what do you think?
You play your cards right and she'll take you out for a sea-gull dinner.
Chaucer and I, we've been getting along just great.
- Yeah, he likes you.
- He told me all about Monica.
How do you know about Monica?
I think this is for you.
What is that?
"Darling, you are out of eggs and cottage cheese.
"I'll pick them up tomorrow.
Love, Monica."
Oh, that Monica. She's my maid.
She sounds very efficient.
She's terrific.
She comes in twice a week and really clears the decks.
Trims the sails?
Blows the pipes.
How long has she been doing all this?
Well, she won't be back.
Monica drowned this morning, and...
- Just like that, huh?
- Yeah.
I think we both knew it was coming, and it was kind of sad for both of us.
Good shot.
How about a joint?
No, thanks.
You sure? You know what they say,
"Cops have the best dope."
No, I don't do that anymore.
I don't think it's necessary.
Right.
Just testing.
Never touch it myself.
Not me, nope.
You're funny.
And you have the prettiest green eyes I've ever seen.
They're blue. Drink your milk.
So go on.
What happened after the divorce?
Nothing. I went back to the library to work...
...and I guess I did become kind of a hermit.
My girlfriend Sally, she's getting married on Saturday.
Oh, you know her.
The one at the party.
Oh, yeah. The one that kept telling you to start taking chances.
Right. Look what happens.
Oh, it didn't work out so bad.
I almost got killed.
Well, yeah, but you met some pretty interesting people.
True.
I guess you can't trust first impressions.
What does that mean?
Well, when I first met you -
- I thought you were a bore.
- Yeah?
- What about before that?
- Before that?
Yeah, when you first saw me.
I thought you were a klutz.
And what about before that?
- Before...?
- Yeah, when you very first laid eyes on me.
What were you thinking?
I thought you...
I thought you had a nice smile.
You did?
What else?
I...
I thought you were cute.
What else?
Oh...
What did you think of me when you first met me?
When you first laid eyes on me?
I thought...
I thought you had a nice smile.
What else?
I thought you were cute.
Extremely cute.
What else?
I thought it would be nice to kiss you.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
- Me too.
- You did?
Then? Right then?
Thought it would be nice to kiss you.
See?
You should always trust your first impressions.
You know something?
I'm really glad that you were assigned to protect me.
I do my job pretty well.
You do your job very well.
Thank you.
Hey, Chaucer, how you doing?
That's a boy. Go on.
Go make breakfast.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You look very pretty.
Come here.
- I could get used to this.
- Me too.
Yello.
Hi, Fergie.
What?
All right, tell Coleman
I'll be there right away.
Listen, you meet me at Gloria's.
I want you to stay with her all day.
Right. Bye.
- Come on. I'm taking you home.
- I have to go to work today.
No, you're not.
Fergie's gonna stay with you all day.
We may have a lead.
I think they got Scarface.
What's happening?
- Recognize the corpse?
- Scarface?
Yeah, we found him over there.
An early-morning fisherman spotted him.
- Anything on the body?
- Nothing.
I guess it's back to basics.
Search the area, try to find some witnesses, huh?
Yeah, Morgan's on that.
I don't mind telling you, Tony, that this one's got me scared.
An assassination is gonna take place tonight, and we're digging up nothing on nothing.
I know.
There's gotta be something somewhere.
What is it? What's the clue?
What have we overlooked?
I thought Sergeant Ferguson was supposed to be here.
- He was.
- Well, why is it...?
Esme.
Esme.
Come on.
We'll get you out of here.
How about that, huh?
How'd you like to take a little bath?
Would you like that?
How'd you like a little soak in the bathtub?
- What do you think?
- Oh, my darling. My dear.
I'd have never had me a daughter, but if I did,
I'd want her to be you.
Oh, Mr. Hennesey, that's sweet.
Well, this is my bridesmaid's dress.
And look, I just do that and goodbye, bridesmaids, and I'm ready for a night out on the town.
I think I'd rather see you as a bride.
- I'm working on it.
- Come on. Gonna take a little swim.
Hello?
Fergie.
Yes, if Tony wants me to,
I'll be there.
What's the address?
If it's that important,
I'll come right away.
What? Bring my umbrella?
But it's beautiful outside.
Hello?
Hello?
He hung up.
I wasn't trying anything. I just told her what you told me to tell her.
Watch your mouth.
Watch it.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Tony?
Fergie?
Run, Gloria. It's a trap!
Let go of me!
- She got away.
- Oh, goddamn it.
Get her.
Hello there, can I help you?
- Just a minute.
- We're having a special today.
- A rub in a whirlpool.
- No, no. Listen...
Pay for one and you get one free.
Excuse me.
This will just take a second.
Take your time, pussy pie.
We've got all day for an afternoon's delight.
~ I feel the earth move
Under my feet ~
~ I feel the sky tumbling down
A- tumbling down ~
~ I just lose control ~
Oh, sing it, Stanley, baby.
~ Down to my very soul
I just... ~
Oh, my God, it's you.
Why? Why are you following me?
Why? What have I ever done to you?
Stanley! What are you doing here?
- Never mind. You've gotta help me.
- Oh, please.
Please, don't tell anybody you saw me here. It's my first time.
I swear. I'll never do it again.
I promise.
Be quiet.
What's so bad, anyway?
I didn't do anything.
I never do anything.
Stanley, listen to me.
You've gotta help me.
Help you?
I don't know this place.
But it's a matter of life and death.
It's very important.
What do you want me to do?
Hey, give me that.
There's a phone out by the pool.
Go out there and call the police.
The police?
- Oh, my God, the police?
- Yes, tell them to get here right away.
- Tell them to raid the place.
- A raid?
You want me to go and call for a raid?
Are you crazy?
Do you know what they would do to me?
The headlines. Hey!
Listen. Many lives are in danger.
My life, your life.
There are men out there who are killers.
What? But why me?
They don't know me.
I'm not even using my real name.
Take this dime.
Now, get out there and call the police.
You don't have to be here when they get here.
Go on. Go and I'll keep an eye on your clothes.
But I can't do it.
God. Never do it again.
Hello.
Yeah, well...
Yeah, I'd like to see...
Could you get me the police?
Help!
- It's a matter of life and death.
- Tell Tony Carlson! Tell Lieutenant...
Hey, hey. What's...?
What are you doing here?
What?
This is what you want?
All right.
Thank you very much.
- Anything from the FBI?
- No, nothing.
- How about the C.I.I.?
- Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing on nothing.
This is just great.
Are you Tony Carlson, the cop friend of Gloria's?
- Yes.
- Well, we found this file at the library on the Tax the Churches League.
I thought I would bring it over.
It has some pictures there, and Gloria felt maybe it would help...
Wait a minute.
This is Miss Casswell.
No, I think that's Delia Darrow.
It says there that she and her husband founded the league and then in 1963 were sent to prison.
They tried to kidnap the Reverend
Billy Graham. Where's Gloria?
Dickinson, find out everything you can on this Delia Darrow.
Right.
Really, I don't know what happened.
I wasn't doing anything.
Really. Look, I've never been to one of those places before.
I thought it was a health club.
- What weirdoes.
- Look, thanks for coming by.
It's the first real lead we've had today.
I will tell Gloria.
She's back at the house.
No, she's not.
I spoke with her landlord, and he said that she left this morning to meet you.
What are you talking about?
That's what he told me.
I expected to see her down here.
Hey, what... Where you going?
I didn't... I didn't know what sort of place it was.
- Who cares?
- Look, of course I paid the money, but I wanted a massage.
I had this bad back.
I've got this pain up and down here.
All I wanted was a little...
Hey, watch those hands, buster.
God.
- Didn't you get the address?
- No.
She just said Fergie called and told her to meet you.
Come to think of it, she was a little puzzled when he told her to bring her umbrella.
Damn it, I should have stayed with her.
Do you think she's been kidnapped by this fellow, Stiltskin?
I'm sure of it. But I think I know where to begin looking.
Wait!
If Gloria's in trouble,
I'm going with you.
No way. I can't be responsible for your safety too.
Watch.
Oh, shit!
Black belt, 1945.
OK, but hurry up, we haven't got much time.
- We've gotta get to the archbishop's.
- Esme.
You be a good... Esme!
How many times have I told you?
Do not eat the cigarettes!
Come on, let's go.
Right. Do you think Gloria's at the archbishop's?
I wouldn't be surprised.
Hello, Turk. Been looking for you.
- Very impressive.
- Jungle training.
Drag him in the bushes.
Meet me around back.
Fergie.
What's that?
Must be that idiot, Turk.
God knows what's keeping him.
We're late as it is.
- You all right?
- Tony...
Tony, you gotta...
You gotta stop them.
- What?
- Stiltskin was hired to kill the pope.
- The pope?
- At the opera tonight, before the reception.
- And the archbishop too?
- That's not the archbishop.
They killed him.
That's his twin brother.
His twin brother?
What about Gloria?
Where is she?
They got her upstairs.
I'm all right. Go on.
Don't move, lieutenant.
Drop the gun, or I'll shoot.
I don't get this. Stiltskin's dead.
Police know all about you.
There's no way for your plan to work now.
They may know about Delia Darrow, and they may find out about Charlie here, but the plan is still gonna work.
The statement will be made.
Don't you think we should get out of here? Turk's disappeared.
- What are we waiting around for?
- All in good time, Charlie.
It's only 6:45.
The quarry is just entering the trap.
You see, lieutenant, your relentless pursuit forced us to come up with a contingency plan.
It is foolproof.
If by the end of the first act the pope has not yet been dispatched,
Whitey Jackson will open fire from the organ bay.
He will also fire if the pope unexpectedly leaves his seat or if the police arrive in the auditorium.
But why kill the pope?
He means nothing to you.
He is a symbol, a symbol of the vast wealth and corporate power of the world's churches.
Like my dear, dead brother.
Always the good one...
...hiding behind the skirts of this sham called organized religion...
...whose sole aim is to rob true spirituality of its life...
...and perpetuate an implacable authority.
Shut up, Charlie.
Don't excite yourself.
My brother.
Is this a stable?
Or is it a palace for the prince of the church?
In the past, people rose up and slaughtered their kings.
Tonight's the beginning of a revolution long overdue.
Ten years ago, we attempted a peaceful campaign for the taxation of these billion-dollar corporations.
But...
...they support the economic system.
And so the economic system supported them.
We were attacked, laughed at...
...and finally imprisoned.
But it was there, in those hellholes, where the mind is bound and the spirit is shackled, that we realized that the single most effective way to bring about radical change is the historically proven path...
...of violence.
Oh, Mr. Hennesey...
She was one tough old mama.
Come on.
We gotta get to the opera house!
But the opera house is clear across town, and it's already past 7.
The opera must have already started.
~ If you want to know who we are ~
~ We are gentlemen of Japan ~

On no account are they to take any action until I arrive.
- Take care of Fergie.
- You might need this.
- It's 7:15! We'll never make it!
- We'll make it.
- Tony, this is a one-way street!

- You crazy?! My Luigi...
- You break my restaurant!
- I'm a police officer.
- Are you crazy?!
- Don't worry. Enjoy your dinner!
Nothing to worry about!
There's nothing to... I am a police officer. It is an emergency.
We must leave.
We'll give back the telephone...
- Police! Police! Luigi!
- It's a very large order. Big order.
- Large order.
- They're breaking my ristorante!
Hey, you! Look, I'm a police officer.
I gotta get to the opera house, and you gotta drive me.
- Far out!
- Great, yeah. Get in the front, Gloria.
It's a life-and-death situation, so move over, buddy.

He's with the FBI.
Gloria, get in.
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait! Wait!
Tony! Hello.
Tony, there's an old couple back there.
They don't speak any English.
They just arrived in America.
That's great. Just tell them to hold on tight. I can't stop now.

OK, now, when we get inside,
I want you to point out the albino.
You're the only one who's seen him, he may wear a disguise.
Oh, God! He'll be in one of the two organ bays, won't he?
That's what the lady said.
Look out. Hold on.
You guys, come on!
Oh, it was very nice meeting you. Bye.

- To the grids, backstage.
Tell Coleman to meet me backstage.
You come with me.

Lower the curtain.
And bring that other thing down.
Take this. Get them down.
- You really took a chance up there.
- I know.
- You all right?
- I'm perfect.
Bring up the curtain, bring up the curtain!
Can't you hear that applause?
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
On the mountain top
I see something black
Is it cow shit
Or my beloved
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...
and welcome once again to The Crazy Daisy Show.
We have sophisticated entertainment, a window into reality...
a breath of cold air from another world.
As the Chastity Belt Foundation and the Aristotlese Aplanalp chain stores... proudly present the semifinalists in the Miss World 1984 Contest!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great deal of pleasure... to present Mrs. Martha Aplanalp, well-known philanthropist... and chairman of the Chastity Belt Foundation.
A great sponsor and a great mother.
Dear Mrs. Martha, first the question, why the Chastity Belt Foundation?
Surely in these modern times that seems to be a bit old-fashioned.
Oh, we're not old-fashioned - not in the least.
At Chastity Belt, there are no metals... no elastic supports... no tranquilizers.
Through the guidance of our sensational method... your own body kills the animal.
We advocate simple triumph of the will.
It is painless and ever so rewarding.
No wild dreams.
No - No peculiar behavior.
Solid health and purposeful direction.
It's so good to hear about health and purposeful direction in these sick times.
Right on! Sock it to me, baby.
A network of muscles forms the protective armor around the pelvic region.
If not controlled and kept at bay... wild impulses will turn everyone into beastly animals... chaotic natural beings.
Semifinalists from 77 countries have been selected and sent here this evening.
They are, of course, the most desirable, prominent... and well-preserved virgins available.
This year's stake for the lucky young winner is $50 billion.
Fifty billion dollars, the estimated fortune of Mr. Aplanalp... uh, Mrs. Martha Aplanalp's boy, her pride and joy.
The richest bachelor in the world...
who decided suddenly this summer to give up his bachelorhood...
to sponsor the Miss World Contest and marry the winner...
the most cherished girl on the planet Earth.
There's a saying in the Aplanalp family:
"When we buy something, we buy the best, and we buy it brand-new."
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Mittlefinger.
Turn over here, Doctor.
Yes, uh, Dr. Mittlefinger certainly is an extraordinary man.
Um, has to his credit the delivery of three army generals... four members of Parliament,
Eskimo sextuplets, uh...
and, of course, many, many more people... and women.
I, uh - I'm really thrilled to be able to perform at this important function... and, uh, I'm anticipating some delightful specimens.
Each new flower brings a new joy, a new excitement.
Can we start the show?
Of course.
Uh, so let's meet now the first contestant...
Miss Southern Rhodesia.
Another historical moment, a window into reality... an event never attempted live on television before... and coming to you on The Crazy Daisy Show.
If you'll just step up here.
Would you be good enough to remove your pants?
Oh, my pleasure.
- Dr. Mittlefinger-
- So kind.
Brilliant master of deep insights and even deeper insights.
Innovative explorer of the abysses of the human body and soul.
Tell us, Miss, uh, Southern Rhodesia.
Tell us, how do you feel now?
Oh, I'm great. Oh!
What's happening?
You're tickling me.
I'm really sensitive.
You're tickling me with your little light.
This little light.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we proudly present Miss Congo.
Remove your panties please, honey.
Hey, baby. You mean my bananas?
Oh, yes, of course. Delicious.
There are different types of hymen, a delicate little piece of skin... that informs us about a girl's initiation into the world of adult pleasures.
I mean the sinful, disgusting pleasures of the flesh... and unusual sensual... excitation.
Now, here comes Miss Yugoslavia, a picture of radiant health.
Yes, well, this young lady is certainly self-assured.
Now, moving right along, folks...
let's meet Mademoiselle Canada.
Would you take your pants off, please?
I don't wear any.
You never wear any pants?
Not for a special occasion like this.
Splendid. Splendid.
By far the most beautiful thing here.
In all my years of practice,
I've never seen anything so sweet.
A rosebud.
The whole world is our country
Liberty is our law
And just one thought...
The whole world is our country
Liberty is our law
Just one thought burns in our hearts
Wanderers on land
And sea
For an idea
We leave our loved ones behind
The whole world is our country
Liberty is our law
And just one thought...
The whole world is our country
Liberty is our law
Just one thought burns in our hearts
But all your exiled people
Shall return to you
And brandish the torch
To demand their rights
The whole world is our country
Liberty is our law
And just one thought...
The whole world is our country
Liberty is our law
Just one thought burns in our hearts
When I buy something, 
I always buy the best.
You know, yesterday,
I bought a diamond mine in South Africa.
Today, another buy.
The best-bred bride available.
Must be about 785 diamonds in there.
You know that?
- About that?
- Oh, yeah. Maybe more.
And they all came from my diamond mine.
Yeah!
Yes, sir, baby.
Here we go.
Yeah. Hand-carved.
- You know who this fella is?
- No.
That's Karl. Karl Marx!
Yeah.
He's the guy that shot the Russian Czar. Yeah.
Shot him dead, right in the head. Yeah.
That started World War I, honey. Yeah!
I got it from a Russian business connection. Yeah.
He buys a lot of my diamonds.
- You see that little fountain down there?
- Yes.
That's my next buy. Yeah!
It's gonna be my biggest undertaking in landscape architecture.
I'm gonna buy it from the Canadian government.
I'm gonna renovate it, redecorate it.
Get rid of the water, turn off the falls.
I'm gonna install an electronic, synthetic... laser moving image in livin' color.
In livin' color, honey! Yeah.
And we're gonna have a huge quadraphonic sound system.
Yeah! Of the royal waters. Yeah!
We're gonna have the best sight and sound system available. Yeah.
Unaffected by weather conditions.
My empire.
Milk for the entire country.
Let's see the bride.
- Whoo!
- Hey!
Mama!
Whoo!
Now, you may ask, do I have time for marriage?
And I simply state that marriage is a great gimmick for saving money and time... which is money!
I have come to understand the real meaning of marriage.
I simply can't afford any more waste.
I can't afford any more chaos in my sex life.
All right. Everyone has to relieve himself, but why waste it?
Okay. You bang some broad, you feel good for a half a second... but then you realize you've gotta run to the phone to call your doctor...
'cause you gotta have a V.D. test.
You soothe your balls... and you get a headache.
- That's right, my son.
- Well, not for me no more.
I guarantee that.
My mama kept telling me,
"Son, look after your health."
Well, Ma, I sure as hell aim to.
Come over here, honey.
Best little heifer in town. In the world!
No chemical substitutes.
All ingredients checked and double-checked... and certified pure.
Not an easy thing to find these days, is it?
Well, I done it.
So now I have acquired a lady of the house...
a personal jewel...
but above all...
a purified sanitation system for unchecked waste.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Mama! Yahoo!
Hey, Mama! Yahoo!

Oh, it's sweet to be hungry
It's finger-licking good

Hey, Potemkin!
Aren't you from that famous revolution that failed?
I mean the one in 1905.
Captain, I am your new lover.
The annunciation!
I'm starving for love.
I'm hungry for love.
Those who starve know how to make love.
They're charged with electricity.
Where is this boat going?
All the way.
All the way?
To the bottom.
You need a good sailor on this boat. 
Come. I'll treat you well.
What a joy to meet... an authentic... sexual proletarian!
Beast!
Fascination!
Forward!
Optimistic tragedy!
Oh, sailor!
Stick your sword in! You won't hurt her!
"Man" - how proud that word sounds!
Forward, people, to battle
The red flag, the red flag
Forward, people, to battle
The red flag will triumph
The red flag will triumph
The red flag will triumph

Long live communism and freedom

I expected something else to happen.
Nonsense. He can do anything. 
He's the most powerful millionaire in the world.
Which means, quite simply, that for your own good, you better forget this marriage.
Then I think I should get alimony.
I advise you strongly... to refrain from thinking anything.
Thinking sometimes can be a very dangerous exercise.
Very dangerous indeed.
Hmm. This is insane.
Yes.
Maybe we should ask for a psychiatric examination.
There are people with similar symptoms.
They become confused.
They spend the rest of their lives behind the walls of asylums.
- This house is mine!
- Forget it!
- Alimony!
- Oh, yeah?
Never!
Be reasonable!
Jeremiah. Jeremiah.
Take care of her, Jeremiah.
This is mine!
This is mine!
This is mine! Mine!
Take care of her, Jeremiah.
She's overtired.
She doesn't feel very well.
Poor girl.
Where am I? Oh!
Hitler! Dirty Jew.
They call me Neanderthal.
Fascist pig!
I'm not just anybody.
Dirty Commie.
Why, they even wanted to put me on exhibit... in the Museum of Natural Sciences.
My portrait is used in Szondy's test.
I am listed in Krafft-Ebing.
I am a certified psychopath.
I am even quoted by Lombroso. And... my size is superhuman.
- Afraid?
- No.
Hmm.
I have my own advertising slogan:
Try me. I'm delicious.
See this chocolate complexion?
Try it.
It's sweet.
Finger-licking good.
Ooh.
I'm Catholic, and it's a spiritual thing for me.
I'm Muslim, and I have a real thing for you.
Oh.
Oh, you damned fool!
This is my only property.
This is my diamond mine.
I'll do something to you that my father taught me.
Are you happy?
- Hello, sir. Where are you off to today?
- Oh. Paris.
May I have your ticket, please?
Thank you.
It weighs a ton.
What have you got in there?
Oh, books. Lots of them.
Books weigh a lot.
I'm taking a refresher course in philosophy.
Marcuse, Supek, Vranicki, Sartre.
- You know, i-i-it's heavy.
- That would be 55 pounds overweight.
Oh, I'll pay the difference.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I have presents for you.
A real Arabian carpet.
You like it?
Made in China.
Vodka from Berkeley, California.
For you.
And my friend...
Leonide.
And my name is Luv Bakunin.
Do you like my friend?
Oh.
Entrust your fate to no one!
People!
The policeman's boot crushes your desires and feelings.
Let's be realistic and demand the impossible.
A good bath, for instance.
I haven't had one in four months.
Let's be realistic, comrades
And demand the impossible
A hot bath, for instance
Don't stay here.
This boat is full of corpses.
It doesn't matter.
The whole world is full of corpses.
IN THE KATYN FOREST
Let's be realistic, comrades
And demand the impossible
Is there life on the Earth
Is there life after birth
Is there life on the Earth
Is there life after birth
It's a joy to be alive
It's good to be glad
Good to survive
It's great to be mad
It's fun to have nothing
Do things in the nude
Oh, it's sweet to be hungry
It's finger-licking good
Is there life on the Earth
Is there life after birth
Is there life on the Earth
Is there life after birth
The portrait. The portrait. 
Somebody.
The portrait.
Get the portrait in place.
I want you to face the camera and look terribly Mexican...
'cause I didn't fly you all over here to look like a French extra.
And start to sing very nobly.
To see this world of violence
And so much suffering makes me high
To live more fully I will die
Such passion cries out for forgiveness
River of blood, carnage
I will shout
"I want more!"
Night of the sun, oh my heart, to celebrate the explosion
With the motor of history driving me on
I'm a wild stallion
My golden mane flies in the wind
As I seek out good times
My valiant sword stands ever ready
Cut! Cut! 
What's the matter, love, now?
What's got into you? Don't you know we're working on a limited budget here?
Don't you know I've got to be back in London by tomorrow night?
Let's do it again, and this time, let's get it bloody right!
Rewind. Rewind.
- So, are you ready?
- Ready.
To see this world of violence
And so much suffering makes me high
To live more fully I will die
Such passion cries out for forgiveness
River of blood, carnage
I will shout
"I want more!"
Night of the sun, oh my heart, to celebrate the explosion
With the motor of history driving me on
I'm a wild stallion
My golden mane flies in the wind
As I seek out good times
My valiant sword stands ever ready
This wild stallion cannot be tamed
Stirring up passion wherever I go
This is my song
A thousand steeds will rise from my grave
Untamed and unafraid
You are so beautiful.
I know.
Your eyes are irresistible.
I must see you tonight.
See me now.
Mmm.
Let's get a picture of Sacré Coeur!
Stand right there!
It's him!
Master, we must have a picture.
Oh!
Oh. 
Ow.
At last! At last!
Instant cinema!
Have you sent for the doctor?
Where's my veal chop?
Hello, maestro.
I knew you were a hell of a lover, but this really knocks me out.
And I am not easily surprised.
Knocks me out too, señor.
It's a real love cramp.
The man's organ is erect.
The woman's love muscle closes tightly around it.
Sometimes it tickles, but sometimes they get stuck.
Happens to dogs too.
- You're gonna cut it off?
- Don't worry. Have no fear.
- Latin lover.
- Sí.
Hors d'oeuvres for table 12.
Ah!
Arriba! 
- Can I have an autograph, please?
- Sí. Sí.
Will you sing something for us, maestro, please?
With the motor of history driving me on
I'm a wild stallion
My golden mane flies in the wind
As I seek out good times
My valiant sword stands ever ready
This wild stallion cannot be tamed
Stirring up passion wherever I go
This is my song
A thousand steeds will rise from my grave
Untamed and unafraid
When I left for Spain... in the war against all war and against fascism... my doctor said to me,
"Comrade... don't go!
You're too weak.
You're so delicate."
He said, "Life is so fragile.
It must be protected."
"From what?" I asked.
"From water? Fire?
Wind?
Men?
You can wipe your ass with your advice", 
I told him.
I told my husband...
"Freedom and communism start today."
"Love starts today"...
I told my lover.
"We can't wage revolution with lies",
I told the secretary of my party cell.
I told my soldiers,
"Our aim in this war isn't to die on the field of honor.
Whoever falls and dies is a real schmuck, a total idiot!"
Everyone has deserted me.
Only a few old soldiers come visit me now and then.
Don't stay here.
Wow.
My name is Anna Planeta.
You can fuck me if you are lucky, Mr. Sugar.
Three blind mice
Three blind mice
See how they run
See how they run
They all ran after the farmer's wife who cut off their tails with a carving knife
Did you ever see such a thing in your life as three blind mice
Three blind mice
See how they run
See how they run
They all ran after the farmer's wife
I'm building the head... of Immaculate Conception.
Conceive your child in the brains... of a - 
Nice and flat so I can cut little slices.
Can I cut it now?
No one's answering.
Shall I cut it?
Oh!
Delicious!
Who wants a slice?
Aaah!
Is it cow shit
Or my beloved
Oh! Oh!
Everyone I loved is dead.
I feel good.
It always starts out that way.
It always starts out so well.
Sugar everywhere.
I don't believe it.
This boat is full of sugar.
Sugar is dangerous.
Fine weather today.
How can you say that?
Sugar is dangerous.
Makes you live dangerously.
Are you afraid of the past?
I brought all this sugar here, but the bitter taste still lingers.
In any case, the traces can't be erased.
What about the witnesses?
The witnesses must disappear.
Oh.
Oh.
That's good.
Go on.
No explanation?
Not everything can be explained.
I was so jealous when Vakulinchuk was killed.
I was so jealous when Vakulinchuk was killed.
My God, how sad you are!
Is the tear ready?
Anna!
Darling, this is going to be the highlight of your career.
From now on, when people eat chocolate-
I mean the brand we advertise-
they will not feel the same.
I want them to feel as they're eating you.
Action.
Chocolat.
Easy, easy.
Perfect.
Perfect. Very beautiful.
- Okay.
- Sensational!
Okay.
Mmm. Right.
We're gonna sell the chocolate.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Let everything be known... and let everything be clean.
Our scouts had trouble in certain parts of the world.
It's not easy to find a girl who's both pretty and a virgin.
Our boys did quite a job, 
I'll tell you.
CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING
Most of the time, it started like this...
Practical Treatise of Magic
Fill this out, please...
But, the next morning...
This is yours, miss.
Thank you sir.
No, I don't drink coffee.
It's not for me.
It's for you this time.
Here Lil, for your collection
This one's from Borneo
Java?
And the last one?
Klimanjaro.
Some people have the fun
The past?
No. Past, future.
House of God, liberation from prison.
The Chariot.
New start. Conquest.
May I?
You woke up lucky today.
Oh, Death!
No. It's positive there.
Movement. Change. The end... becoming radiance, triumph.
Conquest. The Sun.
How useless!
Don't burn yourself
You do me, now.
The Past. The Hanged Man
What is below is above.
Your future is behind you.
And you plunge into the depths... of night...
My future is...
Your grandfather the hermit, protects you.
You don't move. You don't advance.
You advance, but in total immobility.
Stagnation!
Triumphant stagnation.
At least triumphant.
Consequently, my future is in the present.
Exactly.
That's fine. I like paper...
I like the smell of wax.
Another puff?
Now?
It'll be better tomorrow.
Let's hope so
Well, let's go... home.
The cigarette?
I'll keep it.
Back to literature.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you please smoke discreetly.
The children are really noisy.
Is the white elephant back?
No, he's gone to Australia.
The naive larks and the ladies of Flajolie are out.
It's like the spider.
Death with a blue ribbon.
In front of the mirror?
In front of the mirror
July 11th
Don't let your cats out.
I'm sorry. I woke you?
I thought it was the ones who are after me.
Don't you think you need a bed?
I've to wash.
A shower...Must take a shower.
You  had 3 calls while I slept.
First door on the left.
It's crazy!
My last African safari... was really crazy.
We were dying of heat.
Every day in the savannah chasing animals.
I had a hoa consquitador.
A hoa consquitador.
That quite adore me.
He wasn't dangerous,
I'd put him around my neck.
When the natives killed the tiger, the biggest one they said.. it was the tiger of Bengal!
Bengal the area of Africa we were in. You know it?
It's a blue and brown bird.
The Pigmy Emperor had invited me... but Zouha the Giantess was jealous.
She wanted to marry the emperor who'd given me the tiger skin.
But since the Pigmy king had giben it to me...
No bear skin?
Zhuba wanted my skin. My skin.
So, I escaped.
I almost croaked coming back from the jungle.
I lived through hell.
I lost my hair, all over, plucked clean.
I was scared to death.
I was traumtoed.
Tomatoed?
Yeah freaked out.
I was invited to Hong Kong.
A cool place,
I'll tell you about it.
There was a Japanese guy who did acoopuncture.
He did it to me.
I stayed for a month.
Afterwards my hair came back.
All red at first, and then normal again.
And then I came back.
Who's that?
That'^s Gregoire... alias Gýilou.
A distant cousin from the Luberon
We were childhood lovers.
We had innocent little games.
Playing doctor and all.
On sundays we'd get married in the gras behind the rectory. naked as worms, serious as popes.
Now Guilou's coming back.
He's written. I'm waiting.
But he wants us to wear white and go to churtch.
What's this relic?
A spare forget-me-not.
Forest of knots?
- The forget-me-not of the poor.
It isnt't forget-me-not it's a daisy.
It was a daisy.
We've to take care of that.
Can you take alcohol?
You can't take alcohol?
No, it's OK!
I have a first-aid certificate.
How'd you get that?
They were after me.
Or I thought it was them.
I fell down. I was afraid.
But who are they? Afraid of what?
I'd been hired to work in a house... then, 2 days ago...
-before it was fine-
2 days ago, I found in my room, a bracalet with the  name of a foreign girl,
I thought it belonged to the firl who was there before me.
So I took it to my boss.
When he saw it he turned pale.
I thought he'd hit me.
He locked himself in his office with his wife.
She was crying, he was shouting and I listened.
Then the other woman came.
So, I left.
I moved a bit away and poked around... in the drawers... and then, in one drawer,
I found... two passports with foreign names, and one was the name on the bracelet.
But the photos were ripped out.
Yesterday. when I wanted to continue... everything was locked, the drawers, the closets...
I tried to force a drawer... and they came in.
I ran away, and now they're after me.
Who are they?
My boss and the two women.
What did you do in the house?
Nanny.
There were children?
Of course!
How many?
One.
A little girl?
Yes.
How old was she?
Oh little, 7 or 8.
And the women?
Were they dark or fair?
Dark and fair.
But I don't know about them.
They were very secretive.
What did he look like?
Gloomy?
Him? Like your fish.
Black.
It's OK now.
Relax.
I'd really  like a bloody mary.
I have a headache.
Relax.
Lie down.
Take this.
Swallow it all at once.
What's the address of that house?
But, the next morning...
Hello,  Lil?
It's Julie.
No, not very well.
I don't know.
I'm not coming in today.
I'd rather no, just a vision.
I'd rather rest.
Anyway, I'll be in tomorrow.
Allright!
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye.
What was the address of that house?
I told you yesterday.
7 bis rue du Nadir aux Pommes
That's it.
Gregoire?
Ah, Guilou!
Yes, it is Julie.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
You sond so close. How odd.
You're in Paris?
Since when?
This morning!
I wantr to see you.
Today, yes today!
Wait!
Three o'clock.
St. Vincent Square.
Big kiss. See you in a minute.
To my Julie.
The child has become a man.
It seems people live here...
Nestor! Small world isn't it?
Guess who?
I recognise these soft hands. the scent of this skin the rhythm of this breath.
Guilou, you haven't changed a bit!
Do you remember the Monday? when I gathered 313?
311 because there were
5 purple poisoned coichicuros.
The days of blindman's bluff,
I couldn't find you.
When I got home it was dark.
I didn't get dessert.
The day before, when we plated "Hot-Cold", you were hotter with another.
Josette chsed me.
And the Rectory?
Has thr Rectory lost non of its charm?
Nor the young girl her naivety?
It's just as I'd imagined it.
Nothing's changed!
The gossamer caressed our bare feet... they were silvery and soft...
When I pressed you against the hedge to kiss you
There was no one around. red mouth smeared.. strawberries crushed in milk... sugared kisses, four o'clock... snacks...hot.
Kisses and rhubarb jam... cigarettes stolen from Uncle Ed... we made blue smoke rings.
The forget-me-not song... white sun, dark stomachs... and the wind howled and we danced. and we loved Exstasy!
Ecstasy! Perverse and mystic sodomisation.
Homosexual spleen in the attic... disguised as Alsatians!
Sodom. Gomorrah.
Biting your teeth Burning loins
Hot lava...sleep...
Sleeping, dying of kisses, sleeping, kisses...
Sleeping... Kisses...
Sleeping... Kisses...
Give me death, my beloved!
And now, dear friend go jack-off among the roses
You have become an unspeakable monster of vulgarity
I want never to see you again.
Good-bye forever. Forever good-bye
It's from the man over there
Go thank him.
Miss Julie?
Miss Julie has gone far away.
I don't think she'll ever come back
Where to?
Rue du Calvare in Montmartre.
Tonight you're going to get it!
I'm going to get it?
You'll be suprised.
OK, go ahead. Keep it up.
I'll keep my trap shut.
Violins!
If this keeps up, I'm splitting.
I'm eating.
Shut up
I'll tell you a story because
I'm better off than you. and your hang-ups aren't worth beans
I've met this girl...
I left my boyfriends.
Shut up! Listen!
I've met this woman... an American, a real American.
With butterfly sunglasses?
A terrific young woman... she's in all the papers...
I live at her house.
Shit! Listen! I'm not joking.
She has a pink swimming pool.
I'll invite you guys to swim someday
In a pink heart.
A heart shape.
You're crazy!
She wants to make me  her pygma... shit! Her pyg...ma...lion!
And we can sunbathe
Naked!
She's super rich.
She's loaded, her name's always in the papers.
She's taking care of me because she says I've got something... she's going to make me a great... lady ýf the dance.
Introduce me to her
- No. I've got first dibs.
And then me.
Know what she wants to do to me?
- Is she attractive?
You'll think so.
I've been with her 2 days.
How old is she?
We have to place her, you know.
What color hair?
- Red
A red-head!
Pale with freckles...
She gave me a massage, you know...
Well she has a masseur and he did it.
He's got slanted eyes.
Would she do me?
- She might do guys.
I think behind her there must be... a big political boss...
I don't know about politics.
But there's money.
Not to mention names, but there reminds me of...
Yeah an American, it's the same thing he's in the papers
She's like him.
A guy you never see, a billionaire...
Except you see her It's the same degree.
What's his name?
The man, Marylin's producer.
And what's your bitch do?
My bitch!
Get lost, you're crazy!
You're not coming swimming!
- Yes.
She doesn't want slobs.
I'm sure I know her.
She's not a dyke, you know.
She's just come from America?
But she's got a flat in France. a flat that's an entire house.
Where?
Somewhere. She told me not to tell, it's a secret.
Your lady's making it all up.
You're really dumb.
She's broke.
She lies to get you to bed.
Stupid ass.
I've been to her place.
I've seen her money,
She has servants...
Don't be so agressive.
I'm not. You're just jealous.
Nobody cares about your American.
When you see her you will.
I wondered if there's any truth in your story
Listen Alice, it's really Wonderland.
You can't imagine, I'm ecstatic.
Lucrece is zero next to her.
- I say that for Alice.
I'm getting used to it.
You're so disgusting.
Don't worry,
I know how to choose.
I have good taste too.
So do I, they're really something.
Where did all this happen?
Stupid idiot. 2 days ago.
2 days...it's not true.
I'm not telling you anything.
You're too dumb.
Lay off!
Shut up!
You said that already.
Don't get mad!
What time?
- Six thirty.
Time to do make-up.
Oh, my sister.
Go ahead Miss Stuck-up.
Miss, your fare please.
Hey, this way.
Did you have a good day?
I don't remember anything.
I've to get made-up.
And now, the astonishing... the amazing... the breathtaking... the bedazzling... the most mysterious... most marvellous... mos scabrous... most sulphurous... and so much more!
She's the...
Mandrakore!
It's fake.
It's phony.
It's fake, sweetie.
What were you just telling me?
You've an ideal?
Me? An ideal?
I'd be suprised if you didn't.
Well, anyway...
It's not worth talking about.
You could take the kid out some night
I can't take these days,
I'm busy with my American.
Where?
I don't know the mvoies.
Once in a while to amuse him
Eh, Paulo?
Would you like that?
Have you seen my gloves?
Look what you've done!
May I have kleenex, please?
Is your nose alright?
Yes, but this make-up makes me break out.
I'm tired of this mask, my skin's tight.
You're not the only one.
That's our job.
I'll become a clown, I'll replace... old Julien.
A sad clown.
What do you think?
I'll do something like this.
I'll attack them now.
They won't know you?"
They wouldn't anyway. Think they come for my mug? No way, my ass!
They sleep and drink.
Did you see how they were tonight?
I like the little assholes, as long as they pay.
What are you doing?
Is tomorrow's act ready?
All ready?
OK, great.
What do you think?
Yeah, it's alright, but you should add. some feathers.
She's crazy.
In the back.
Yeah, I've some.
Do you have green? Not there!
Lay off.
She really could do it.
Feathered Myrtille.
Hello, kids.
Hello, M. Dede.
Celine, I've something to tell you.
Tell me here.
I don't have secrets.
It's good news, come on.
Wait 2 minutes for me, OK?
I like you a lot.
You're talented, full of exburance and promise.
I've got you on contract.
And how!
Well, I'm negotiating it at the moment.
What do you mean?
I lose on it, but it's for you career.
An international tour,
Ankara, Istanbul...
Bagdad, Beirut...
Well, then?
You're making fun of me.
- Not at all.
In those places, a great artist, and French too...
It's worth gold, or better... not gold, oil my dear.
I like oil better, no, shit, I mean gold.
You'll see, you'll make some.
Old Dédé told me that... that he's got a tour for me... an international tour to Ankara, Beirut...
Wow, Beirut!
It can't be true,
I don't believe it.
Is he joking?
He says I'm worth oil, no, gold. I don't know...
Do you think it's a joke?
And this one, what's this?
My cousin.
An American cousin.
With a pool?
Of course. pink...and heart-shaped.
Shit, what's got into you?
Nothing! Nothing!
I remember nothing. It's no use.
The little sleep.
Look, I don't get any of this.
You've just forgotten, that's all.
You were in shock.
I don't know.
I'm not getting anywhere.
I don't remember anything.
Look, you're just going... you're going nuts, huh?
Try...force yourself.
That's what I'm doing,
I'm not getting anywhere.
Look, let's start over again, OK?
Try to remember from the moment...
I am starting over.
It doesn't help.
OK, but start from where you happened to show up  at the club.
Where'd you catch the taxi?
Alright, we'll start all over.
This is going to be very funny.
So...
I was...
You were... pushed out of the house... propelled.
Then I was... all wobbly...
I felt dizzy...
I was pretty mixed-up.
Anyway, I managed to get to the taxi... and once in the taxi...
I took... the candy that was in my mouth... and put it in my purse.
What candy?
This one.
What's wrong?
I see it.
What do you see?
It's a dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone swear such a thing
But I was witness to this vow,
I am the guarantor.
If you try to disregard it,
I'll stop you.
Do you think so?
What is pretty does no harm.
But if you say so...
Do not say that word.
You choose the wrong day for trying to seduce Olivier.
Is that all?
You pretend to ignore the vow.
Don't go in there!
Wâs it in the right or left yesterday?
I don't remember.
You could lose, but you always win.
You know it is forbidden her.
My own kingdom, my house, my garden, my flowers, my travel books, for me it was enough.
It would have been enough for the rest of my life.
But they had to take it away.
He claims it is hereditary.
Well, the scent of these plants doesn't help things.
Look what I've drawn for you.
Madlyn...
Ties of blood must be renewed.
Must I tell this ghastly story to its end?
My dear friend, what you have begun, you must complete.
Miss Angele!
Where'd I get them from?
It's odd you know... they mean something to me... their faces are familiar.
They come from far away...
- Yes, they must.
From very far. But they don't look like they've travelled...
Where do they come from,
Zanzibar, Mozambique?
When you're finished with your z'ing, and your childishness.
Look who's talking.
I don't know if my mind went blank, or it's hazy dreams.
It's a mish-mash.
It's like... four petrified images of puppets.
Yes, puppets... but it shouts... it munches candies... it faints... it tells stories... it goes from grey to blue... and it swoons!
It takes stairs every which way!
And to thicken the sauce, a little blood!
Wonderful!
Know what?
No, not yet,
I'd rather not know.
Why? It'll be great.
You don't know the best part...
While you're sitting down..
You know the lady in white?
She's my sister.
My twin sister.
We're as  alike as 2 peas in a pod.
The one whose hands are dirty?
I'm broad-shouldered, but I won't take all the blame.
Your acquaintances are pretty weird...
You should talk, sweetie, yours aren't so clean-cut either
You make do with what you have.
What you have, you have to get.
It's clear you've never eaten shit, the day you do, I'll laugh.
To survive in this life, you need... dough.
Can't it, honey.
Don't make me cry.
But, the next morning...
What's the address of your house?
7 rue des Pommes?
It's 7 bis... rue du Nadi aux Pommes.
I should have taken my saw.
Miss?
My Poupie!
It's not true...I must be dreaming.
How you grown!
After all these years.
My little partridge, my bengali how glad I am to see you!
Do you want your tea?
You know, the other morning
When mother came to take me away...
Oh, a baker's dozen.
After being coddled by you for 6 months.
She told me that you'd been kidnapped by a playboy and taken by helicopter to the Peloponese.
Your father did well to leave.
God rest his soul.
And what's become of your mother with her problems and her men?
I never liked her.
My doll uncles...I liked them.
They were so polite.
Do you ever hear from her?
She flits around.
She sends me a card now and then, the las one was from Java.
So, she's still the same.
Poupie, do you remember?
The little girl from the house over there?
After you left, well, she was very sick...
After you left, she was very weak...
One day, everyone left.
I never saw them again
They never came back.
No news of them.
She was my age.
Remember how the house scared you?
And no one came back?
Never.
The shutter have been closed since then.
Maybe someday, an heir will come, the shutters will open. and I'll have some company.
I'd like to see my old room.
It's just the same, with all your dolls.
I haven't touched it.
Oh, five to! I've to go.
Already?
But now that I've found you
I'll come for tea.
I promise I'll come get you.
It's been too long.
It's broken.
It's in pieces.
Do I swallow them all?
Absolutely not!
You have to take them in order.
There's 5 pieces.
Well, start with the biggest, and end with the teensy weensy one.
In order.
Here goes.
The kleenex will ruin it.
If you only knew the memories the dress brings back to me.
The sea?
The mountains?
Both.
The Borromean Islands?
Yes, six in the evening, the scent of the lemon trees, the Kursaal orchestra.
She was so pale, so fragile
More than I?
Out of my sight?
Who? What? Is it?...
What, out of her sight?
The dress or the girl?
It's the same ones.
They talk strange.
It's a whole tear, era, school.
Grand tragedy! smells like mothballs.
Let's continue.
Medium big.
How is your hand?
Better. But I must be careful.
Every moment is dangerous.
Careful. They are fragile.
Miss Angele. Come quickly.
They're doing the same thing as yesterday.
They'll do the same tomorrow.
The same, every day.
They do it full time?
- They'do it perpetually.
Permanent?
- Perpetual.
They're doing a perputal day.
How about that.
What's next.
Alright, I'm going to do it.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Hello Madlyn.
Did you sleep well?
Today is a big day.
You know I hate little games.
Come, be a sport, Miss.
What a heady scent
Well?
Well what?
Don't keep me waiting.
Which hand?
Was it in the right or the left hand yesterday?
I don't remember.
You could lose but  you always win
You know it is forbidden her.
Madlyn, I've told you not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
I've already told you, the harm you do her.
I do her no harm.
Don't get involved in this, Olivier.
I know better than you how to handle her.
I've taken care of her for 8 months.
Let me act alone.
I know better that you what I do.
The child is resting.
Please lower your voices.
I don't know if I should understand you.
After all... think what you like.
Today, I'm Angéle.
Yesterday it was me.
But it's still her.
I wonder what she's up to.
And him, what's he up to?
Who's he with?
With Camille?  With Sophie?
With Camille and Sophie and Angéle.
What do those ladies want from him?
That's what we may learn in the next episode.
What did you want to say?
Nothing you don't already know, deat Camille.
I'm listening...
You can choose the wrong day for trying to seduce Olivier.
Is that all?
You pretended to ignore the vow he made when his wife died.
What's vow?
My sister spent her time trapping people with her vows.
Don't insult the day when you speak of her.
But, if I must repeat it all to you...
Know, that Nathalie made him swear... not to remarry, to preserver the happiness of their child.
As long as Madlyn live,
I've always known
I was there. I heard her.
"Because I don't want Madlyn to suffer what I suffered at her age".
It's a dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone swear such a thing.
Perhaps. but I was witness to this vow,
I am the guarantor.
If you try to disregard it,
I will stop you.
I promised Nathlie
Her wish will be respected.
Let's make a wish.
Despite my watchfulness, I lost the key to the red cupboard.
What key?
Have you seen it?
There's a running battle here.
Yes, something's going on.
I think one of them is a real slut.
And you know which? The blonde.
With here fragile airs and stuck-up ways.
She's too secretive.
Thet's a professional bias, watch out for blondes and all
It's too obvious that she's guilty for her to be.
Funny thinking.
We'll decide by the judgement of Solomon
The one who ends up with it... wins.
Alright, hang on tight.
He doesn't have any.
He's had it.
There's another.
Monsieur wouldn't consider the mountains?
A dreadful thing has happened!
Do not go in there!
Do you think it could be...
Angele?
But, the next morning...
I'm sick.
Me too.
I want to sleep.
Me too, in fact I'm sleeping.
My legs are gone.
Mine too. But who's going...
You're smart.
Who's going to go today?
I'm going.
You want to go? You're dying to go.
You're there already.
It's not worth going.
We have to be serious.
Let's leave it to fate.
Got a coin?
I'll look in my shoe.
No more money.
Be careful, and give me back my change.
I'll eat it.
It's Swiss chocolate.
Heads I win, tails you lose.
Damn!
I'm struck dumb!
Watch out!
Tails, you lost...
How odd...
I'm going to give you...
A little massage?
An artifice.
What colour?
Pink.
Mauve.
Marshmallow.
Better than red, give me your shoulder.
My little tattoo.
What are you doing?
A double number.
It stings.
Double 33.
Don't cough.
What do I do with it now?
You can go there.
Take your bicycle.
Watch out for traffic.
If I never come back... kiss Harold goodbye for me.
Would you stop staring at me, you.
Put on some make-up, your nose is shiny.
The day... is divided into 4 parts, corresponding to the 4 seasons, and the 4 weeks of the month.
Morning or spring, noon or summer, period of growth.
Afternoon autumn, period of realisation.
This is Guilou.
How are you?
I've thought a good deal.
- About what?
We're through.
What?
Since the day before yesterday...
What is this...
I've decided.
Is this really Gregoire?
I've decided.
You wanted it this way.
Decided what?
Could you let me get a word in edgeways.
How did things go after the square?
You're the one who wanted it to end badly.
Badly?
I'm becoming a Trappist.
Is this a game?
You're pulling my leg.
I'm becoming a Trappist.
We will never speak again.
You're talking to me now.
Tell me what's on your mind.
If you want to break, we will
We already have broken up.
I just want to tell you that it's your fault.
What's my fault?
We can only say goodbye.
So goodbye.
A Trappist!
Oh, shit!
Go masturbate in the daisies like a Gregorian!
"To Julie, the child has become a nun..."
He's hanging on.
Power and virtues... of baby dinasours' eyes
The favorite food of the baby dinasaur. who was a discerning gourmet, was clover. for maximum efficiency. use the minimum the word clever
Replace it with clover
Of course...
Beirut?
Mother?
Oh excuse me.
I interfered...
Celine? She's out.
What?
It's important.
I see...
Of course.
You can count on me.
I'll tell her.
Alright.
What's this?
Where's the Mandrakore?
Who are you?
Don't get excited man, it makes you twitch.
The Mandrakore is out.
She gave me the scoop.
Don't worry. I'm show people.
Who are you anyways?
Haven't you heard? of the Kamakazi?
Your men are leaving!
Do your best.
Stay cool. It's in the bag.
Excuse the delay.
Artists, you know...
The Mandrakore is pure gold!
Naive, I'm so naive
Red-headed miss, fingers of bliss.
Naive, I'm so naive!
When I see you, sirs.
If I want to make you sigh,
I light up your eyes.
If I want to do more,
I just lay it on.
Bluestocking, that's what I am.
The shady miss, a touch like a kiss.
Bluestocking, that's what I am.
When I see you, gadzooks.
I have no heart, not even for a guy.
Life's played tricks on me
When I pick up a man,
I say right away, you'll be alright with me.
But when he's through the door, old loves come back once more.
And memory reappears.
Like a dream... of a past, that is mine.
And kills me!
Excuse me, but I ...
I always allow myself to be overcome by... irrepressible waves of feeling.
When I was childish, they told me I was a real star... a shooting star... and floating star, because...
I had a big rayon tutu.
They said I was suppleness itself, because I could put my legs around my neck, and now,
I want to express my temperament, my spontaneity.
I'm very lively.
And..I can do... the candy woamn, and the headstand woman, on my little finger, and the Snake Woman.
And... lots of other things...
And you, anyway, what can you do?
Yeah, show me what you can do.
You're here oggling me.
Oggling every inch of me...
Behind refrigerated glasses...
You're not worth beans!
Bunch of...pimps!
Cosmic pimps... cosmic twilight pimps!
Voyeurs and perverts!
What is all this?
Come and get me!
Come on!
I'll show you!
Want some fun, bunch of idiots...
Are you chicken?
Come on. Let's go!
Well?
Oh, shit!
Wait! Wait!
It's a misunderstanding.
It's nothing really.
Wait, I'll take the hairs off.
OK. Both at once.
Good morning, Miss Angele.
Good morning, Madlyn.
But why this violence?
These flowers are so pretty.
I thought I'd told Mlle Camille that for children, the sweetest smels are harmful odours.
These flowers are so pretty.
I thought I'd told Mlle Camille that for children, the sweetest smell are harmful odours.
Do you think?
What is pretty does no harm.
But if you say so...
Mademoiselle takes risks.
I'll leave you the roses... because of their thorns.
Good does not always do good.
Mademoiselle takes risks.
I'll leave you the roses... because of their thorns.
Good does not always do good.
Am I disturbing you?
You never disturb me.
I was thinking... that today is..
Madlyn's first birthday since her mother died.
And since I look so like my sister...
What are you saying?
Olivier, give me the key to the trunk.
I don't want to see those dresses again.
May I please have the key to the little chest.
I understand your reticence.
But, perhaps today...
Madlyn would be so happy.
Look at me. Nathalie's dresses would so become me.
How lucky that we have the same complexion.
I don't know if I should understand you.
I thought that today...
Now, finally...
I should have those dresses.
Mother left them to the one who could marry first.
Since my sister's death, they've been kept reverently.
They lie languishing in the attic, wrapoed in mothballs and rose leaves.
The same styles return every 20 years.
I could wear them as they are.
Think of Madlyn!
How happy she'd be!
Excuse me, my dear.
It's nothing.
Did you sleep well?
Today is a big day.
You know I hate little games.
Come, be a sport Miss.
What a heady scent!
It's getting deep.
I've told you not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I've already told you, the harm you do her.
I do no harm.
Don't get involved in this, Olivier.
Will she get him?
The child is resting.
Please lower your voices.
I don't know if I should understand you.
That's what you like.
See, I told you.
But I didn't believe it.
Someone's used my syringe again.
It's inadmissible and it could be dangerous
Madlyn's still asleep, should we wake her?
He does not wish her awakened.
He has spoken to you about it?
No, it is I who am troubled.
These frequent naps...
Thiss sleepiness is abnormal.
He claims it is hereditary.
The scent of these plants certainly doesn't help.
Sophie, look what
I've drawn for you.
I didn't frighten you?
Isn't my flower pretty?
Do not say that word.
If you only knew the memories this dress brings back to me.
The sea? The mountains?
Both.
The Borromean Islands?
She's not bad, you know.
I know I've already seen it.
...the Kursaal Orchestra
She was so pale, so fragile.
More than I?
Out of my sight!
Who? What? Is it?...
That! That thing!
You know quite well.
Your whims again, Sophie.
Come with me
I must speak with you.
What did you want to say?
Nothing you don't already know, dear Camille
I'm listening.
You choose the wrong day for trying to seduce Olivier
Always the same thing.
I'm fed up.
But if I must repeat it all to you.. know that Nathalie made him swear...
Stop. I'm having fun.
It's funny.
You'll tell me later.
Good night.
"Because I don't want Madlyn to suffer what I suffered at her age."
It's dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone swear such a thing.
What a bitch!
Despite my watchfulness,
I lost the key to the red cupboard.
What key?
Have you seen it?
So she took a bottle.
On it was written, "drink me".
She drank it, the liquid inside it, and became tiny.
Mummy!
Help me!
Take care of her.
Don't be afraid.
Why are you hiding?
That was Camille.
It wasn't your mother.
Don't be afraid.
Do you want a candy?
I have one here.
It's over.
I'll never be able to.
She hates me.
I'll never get her to love me.
I am tired, discouraged again.
It's just as it was 10 years ago. when Nathalie and I were young.
She loved me either.
But she was so clever.
It was never Nathalie's fault
It was always mine.
Why are you so shy, Camille?
Why aren't you more like your sister?
You must get out. Let's go dancing to the theatre, to the country.
Come, Camille, come!
She was the first to say those things.
But I was silent and refused everything.
Why?
Why, they wondered.
But I knew why.
I knew what was hidden behind her kindness, her compassion. yes, her compassion
She wanted to destroy me, to make me disappear...
And she...
What a shock?
I don't see anything now.
Let's put them back in.
See what's next.
Wait. I want a smoke.
Intermission? OK?
No. I'm going on.
OK, you continue, then you can tell me about it.
Wait. I'm coming too.
Coming? Hurry?
You are very gloomy.
I don't like to see you thus.
Your concern touches me, Sophie.
But I have good reason.
Camille's appertion?
Camille is not the question.
I understand.
It's what she has awakened in you.
Don't think of the past.
Think of the present, the birthday we are celebrating.
Look.
The doll I bought for Madlyn.
I'm sure she'll love it.
You are second mother to her.
You are a second mother to her.
Everthing I've done.
I've done for you, too.
Don't forget it.
And I hoped that you could perhaps... that we could....
Alas, Sophie...
Madlyn can draw us no closer.
But you would wish it?
I wanted to be sure.
Nathalie's vow...
I respect it as much as you do.
But you won't hear of it anymore.
There's not much of what I thought.
Not at all.
How is your hand?
Better
But I must be careful.
Every moment is dangerous.
Happy birthday, Madlyn!
You know, inspiration is so fragile...
Please.
You can't refuse.
Madlyn would be so happy.
Please, for us.
You are cruel.
A sonata.
Another sonata.
How deep!
No, I don't know.
I'll begin again.
My hurt hand...
You are so beautiful with all this red.
It's said you are the best catch in New England.
I must put my glass down.
It's divine.
I'm drunk!
So beautiful...all this blue.
With this blue, really?
Hold me, Olivier!
I've lived only for you.
My heart followed your steps.
Oh the naughty girl!
The rogue.
A very high tower, an enchanted prince, and a tree with daggers.
The Blue Bird!
Yes!
What blue bird?
You don't know that story?
It's very funny.
An enchanted prince. wishes to join his beloved in her prison tower.
But a wicked witch put daggers and razor blades in the tress and the bird is wounded. and bleeds...
Oh stop! All that blood!
Blood ties must be renewed.
Must I tell this ghastly story to its end?
My dear friend, what you have begun you must complete.
Excuse me, it's time for the child's nap.
Madlyn, be good.
Don't worry, my dear.
You won't be disturbed.
I haven't often the chance to tell you how satisfied I am with your services.
I am given compensation accordingly.
Not in the way I would like.
Madlyn is very lucky... very lucky...
I finished.
Me too.
Madlyn is very lucky.
I'm so disappointed.
Listen...
It's just padding.
We don't know who did it.
We don't know anything more.
What do we do?
It's full of holes..
I don't know.
It's like swiss cheese.
We don't know the end.
I hate that.
Anyway, we're not going back.
Listen. I have an idea.
At the library...
At the library?
Take this off. I can't stand it.
Bend your head forward.
Wait.
The sun is coming up.
In a return to the source... as natural as temporal...
It's the beginning.
...of the four basic elements.
Water.
Air.
You don't think it's polluted?
No, I don't think so.
Very gently!
It's the most fragile part.
You can pour it all.
Earth.
Clover.
How much?
Two stalks.
No, two big ones.
The same size.
Wait, a little one's cheating.
Fire.
The fire will shoot out from the four cardinal points... and from it's conflagration you'll ontain... the memory potion... called "herbed wine" by the ancients.
Because of the clover.
P.S. Beware of side effects.
Take in small doses.
OK, let's go.
We'll both start at the same time.
Can Harold have some?
A little drop.
One drop.
He swallowed it.
It's good.
Very good. Some more...
It's so good.
Let's have another. It's a part-time.
But I feel funny...
I feel fine.
But, really fine.
Mademoiselle takes risks.
Compared to the candies...
Someone's used my syringe again.
It's inadmissible, and could be dangerous.
Madlyn's still asleep, should we wake her?
He does not wish her awakened.
Your whims again, Sophie.
Help me!
Take care of her!
I knew what was hidden behind her kindness her generosity.
She shone all the brighter to the point of blinding them all.
She knew how to destroy me, make me disappear. stiffle me...
I had my own kingdom.
It was enough, my house, my flowers... my picture books... my travel books... but they had to take it away.
Your sister's getting married.
Your sister's getting married.
They'll come to live here, it's logical, it's family.
And they love each other...
They must have secrets, they must be left alone.
Wouldn't you like to travel, Camille?
See the places you've dreamed of?
Borneo, Shangai,
Macao, the Sunda Islands...
With gentle words they drove me out, and with so much money...
I travelled a lot.
Around the world twice, but it was as if another were doing it.
Only at night, was it I... in my dreams...
Always the same dream, the same house...
My house
Now she's dead. I'm alive. Free.
And it's my house.
The won't drive me out again.
I'll do anything.
Anything.
The child will have to give in, don't you think?
And blood ties?
They must be more important than everything else.
They must be renewed.
Mustn't they?
Don't you think?
Why don't you ever answer?
I have to recover, give me some more.
Blood ties must be renewed.
My head aches.
Everything's spinning.
Julie, I see you here... and there...
Why are you behind my back?
Where?
-There.
Where?
- There
Harold's tipsy too.
Madlyn, be a good girl.
Don't worry my dear,
You won't be disturbed.
I haven't often the chance to tell you. how satisfied I am with your services.
I am given compensation accordingly.
Not in the way I would like.
Madlyn is so lucky to enjoy your constant care
Could Monsieur make propositions that... are more precise?
I had thought of taking Madlyn to the sea.
You could come with us.
Impossible! The more sight of a... fish...makes me amnesiac.
Monsieur wouldn't consider the  mountains?
A dreadful thing has happened!
Do not go in there!
You are quite mysterious, my dear friend.
Your concern tickles me, my sweet.
But I have reasons for this mystery.
Both our lives depend on it...
Has my coming troubled you?
Let's see...
Wait, my turn.
Your arrival awoke in me another world that slumbered.
What you've done, we've done together.
We have given birth to night.
What would I do without you?
I hope... that we might still gather the stars of the 1001 nights?
What I've done
I couldn't have undertaken... but your presence, my sweet.
This monstrous child...
Will you not reproach me for it, someday?
My sweet, nothing could bring us closer.
My darling,
I wanted to hear you say it.
Our desires will crystallise together.
I'm scared.
Me too.
I'm scared, but we have no choice.
- We've got to to do something.
Let's go.
Have to save her.
If we never came back, what would we do?
Happily, we've still got... dinasour looks and clover
We must save the kid, all the costs.
I want to get her out.
We'll...get her out.
We'll get her out, but we can still be scared.
We can sleep too, even if we are scared.
I don't want to sleep.
I might dream if I sleep.
Everything's spinning.
I can't sleep.
I laugh when I'm afraid
Me, when I'm sick.
I feel sick to my stomach.
Once upon a time.
Twice upon a time.
Thrice upon a time.
Only, this time... it won't be like that not like the other times.
We'll get her.
Stop the machines.
But, the next morning...
Shit, we got here too early.
Time for a cigaratte.
Clever.
Clover.
Clover.
Clever.
First round for us.
I can't see straight.
Where?
Don't try to be clover.
Up to the staircase.
A real mortuary.
We'll run into stuffed ghosts.
What do we do?
In there.
Let's go.
OK. You change. I'm going in.
You look like a kapo from  the country.
You think you're so clover!
I'm going to brighten up your façade.
Make oranges grow on an olive tree.
Misss...Angéle...Terr,
Mys...tery...Angéle...
What do you mean?
This woman's a drag queen.
No, a defrocked nun.
Everything's spinning...my God.
Have a drink from the flask.
Give me yours.
Time's spinning too.
I'll be late for the commomile scene.
Here, take this one.
Eye of lynx and wooden head, yeah.
I've forgotten my lines!
I thought I'd already told you, that the finest scents are the best perfumes.
That's good enough.
Alright, let's go.
I don't remember.
You could lose, but you always win.
You know it is forbidden her.
I've told you not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
The harm you do her.
I do no harm.
Don't get involved in this, I know better than you know to handle her.
I've taken care of her for 8 months.
Let me act alone. I know better than you what I do.
May I have...the key to the red cupboard.
I don't know if I should understand you.
It's taking off.
I'm not a  bit clover.
I put the key in the silence,
I mean I mixed up 2 scenes.
We're in deep shit, they'll be on to us.
They didn't notice.
And you, Miss Ter, have you some juicy secrets to tell me?
Imagine, my dear,
I glimpsed Camille in the attic, rumaggin about in her things.
Did she say hello?
I sneezed. She didn't flinch.
They're up to their neck in this.
The 2nd act is about to begin.
See if the coast is clear.
Someone's used my syringe again.
You nuts?
It's incomprehensible and totally shocking...
Madlyn is still asleep?
Perhaps we should wake her?
But he, caught between two fires...
Let her sleep.
He has spoken to you?
Has he said something to you?
It's me...I'm...
I'm getting stuck...these.. these whiffs of...
It's hermetic.
Well, the scent of these plants doesn't help things.
Look what I've drawn for you.
Let's see.
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Isn't my flower pretty?
She's the mur...der...ess!
Shit!
The bitch! Tea without sugar!
I didn't know I was so emotional.
The bastards!
They didn't even offer me champagne!
It's not funny.
Well, I've won our bet.
We'll talk about it when we're through with this.
I thought I was done for.
Whether it's Sophie or Camille, makes no difference.
We'll continue as planned.
Help me!
Take care of her.
Do not hide under the pillow.
Don't be afraid.
It wasn't youre mother it was Camille.
Do you want a candy?
I have one care for you.
Open your mouth.
You'll sleep now.
Sleep.
My house, my garden, my flowers...
My travel books...
I'm going to swoon.
It would have been enough...
I'm going to faint.
Your sister's getting married...
They'll come to live here, it's logical.
They love each other.
Lily-livered. Go drink some potion.
Wouldn't you like to travel, Camille?
See the places you've dreamed of,
Shanghai, Macao, the Sunda Islands..
They gave me gentle words, and money, lots of money
I went around the world twice...
You're later. I've been waiting for 2 minutes.
I had to answer the call of nature.
I'm not made of clover.
Anyway, don't worry.
They won't get us now.
Eye of lynx, we've got it made.
It's said you are the best catch in New England.
You are so beautiful with all this red.
You're so palid with all this black.
I must put my glass down.
It's divine. I'm drunk...
- We're not in a melo anymore
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo...
Oh great clover, it's your turn.
Madlyn's hand.
Excuse me, it's time for the child's nap.
You'd lost your charm.
Not that way, follow me.
Put your leg here.
Wait.
Together now.
It doesn't hurt to fall off the moon.
But we failed again.
The dinosaurs took back their eyes.
Someone we know!
What will we play now?
No more playing, ever!
We're going out.
We'll take you boating.
It's raining.
Got a smoke?
We'll chew it, OK?
Miss, you lost your squirrel.
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR
Tell her what you got. - Male,
Caucasian, appears to have been shot.
Where? - In his room.
- Very funny, Harold.
The wound is just below the heart.
- Shot once? - Seems to have been.
Turner...?
Dr. Lappe, I'm sure he's going to be here any second now. - Really?
Mr. Turner is late again.
Let's get back to work.
- We can do that in five minutes.
You know what Joey would say?
- Come on!
What kind of a slug?
- You're missing the point.
The machine will come back with a rephrase. - What do we feed in?
Turner, Joseph. - 17 minutes late.
- Make it 12, there was a headwind.
Dr. Lappe, anything in the early pouch for me?
Dr. Lappe?
Nothing in response to your report.
Please analyze the book on your desk by 4 o'clock. - Yes, sir.
I'd move the Tolmiea to the light, the leaves are getting a blight.
At ease, Sarge, at ease.
It's going to rain today, at 10:20.
There must be more details.
- I only read two chapters.
No other clues?
- What time did they find him?
Doesn't say. Just early evening.
- They never said what caliber.
Apparently a .38.
- Why "apparently?"
The entry wound was characteristic of a .38, but the slug wasn't recovered.
Hey, we're getting somewhere.
- You guys figure it out.
I have Far East journals to read.
- Was the slug in the wall?
No, there was no exit wound.
We're not getting anywhere.
Finish the book.
Hi. What we've got so far...
Ice.
Instead of lead. Ice.
The murderer pours water into a .38 caliber mold and freezes it.
He shoots the guy with the ice bullet.
The cops find a few drops of water.
No bullet, no ballistics.
- That's great!
What is this?
Beautiful calligraphy.
- What is it? - It means heaven.
Nothing else? - It can mean
"the best" or "tops". Why?
I'm not sure. - We're going to Sam and Mae's tonight, right?
Talk to Sam about it.
- About this?
I did. He said, "that's interesting, but it's not my department."
Which means he doesn't think there's anything, just like Dr. Lappe.
And you. - There's not much.
A mystery that's been translated.
A mystery that didn't sell and has been translated into odd languages.
Turkish, but not French.
Arabic, but not Russian or German.
Dutch.
- Spanish?
Yes.
Where did you get that about the ice?
Dashiell Hammett? - Dick Tracy.
Are you sure about this ideogram?
Look at this face. Could I be wrong about an ideogram?
It's a great face.
But it's never been to China.
Ray, when can I get some computer time? - Dick Tracy?
A very underrated detective.
- There's some free time at 2:45.
No, stay on schedule, I'll get it.
Four pieces, right?
- Right. - Hold it!
Five.
- Affirmative, five.
Where is Mr. Heidegger? - He called in sick. - Probably hung over again.
This is extraordinary.
I was just checking the files and I came across an inquiry he sent to
Persian Gulf command.
He did that for me.
- It never went through my office.
I asked for some research, he didn't feel it was important.
I wish you people would go through channels.
What's on your mind?
This was in the pouch from New York Central.
HQ in Langley says there's no other source to support your theory.
Call this working on that book?
- I'll have it by 4pm.
We have people to service machines.
- These things just look complicated.
I wonder if you are entirely happy here.
Within obvious limits, yes, sir.
- Obvious limits?
I can't tell people what I do.
- Why can't you accept that?
I actually trust a few people.
That's the problem.
It's your turn to bring in lunch.
What time is it?
- The rain's gonna stop by 11:30.
You can wait 8 minutes.
That's not a proper exit! - He always goes out that way when it rains.
Personnel should enter and exit by authorized means only!
Shakespeare, how is it? - Terrific.
The rejection slips just pile up.
Know the feeling.
I always wanted to be Escoffier.
Maybe it's not too late. Van Gogh was 30 before he began to paint.
No mayonnaise on Dr. Lappe's.
On the other hand, Mozart was 3 when he started piano, and composed at 6.
Fast starter, probably better.
- Van Gogh never sold a painting and Mozart died a pauper.
- Am I in the Public Library?
Hey, that's a very bright man!
- Educational. That's why I come here.
I come in here to get sick, just like everybody else.
No butter on Ray's sandwich.
He gets very panicky about butter.
Mr. Jennings is in the back.
He'll sign for it.
Here are the...
Mrs. Russell, the Curtis report...
Would you move from the window, please?
Pardon?
Would you move from the window?
I won't scream.
I know.
Small breakdown in security there?
What are you doin'?
What the hell are you doing?
Sleep at night, will ya?
This is the Major.
- Joe Turner.
Identification? - My name is Turner.
I work for you. Now listen...
Identify yourself.
What is your designation?
Condor. Section 9, Department 17.
The section has been hit. - Level?
Level of damage! - Everybody.
Dr. Lappe, Janice, Ray, Harold...
Are you on a company line?
- No, I'm in a phone booth.
You're in violation of communication procedures, Condor.
Listen, you S.O.B... I came back with lunch and the whole house was dead!
Has the incident been discovered by anybody outside the company?
I don't know. I don't think so.
- Are you damaged?
Damaged...? No.
- Are you armed?
I have Mrs... I can't remember her code name... Nightingale.
She was afraid of being raped.
I've got her gun. - Identify it.
It's a.45 automatic.
Will you guys bring me in, please?
I'm not a field agent.
I just read books! - Leave the area.
Alright.
Do I come into headquarters now?
Negative. Find a secure location.
- Where?
Avoid any place you are known.
Do not go home.
Surface again in two hours and call the Major.
That'll be 14:30 your time.
- Wait a minute, 2:30, right.
Walk away from the phone.
Don't hang it up. - Don't hang it...?
This is the Panic Officer.
Section 9-17 may have been hit.
Activate following procedures:
NY 1-2-7, D.C. 4-6-9.
Replay the report upcoming. Standby.
Augie 1 to New York Center:
- Go ahead, Augie 1.
Who am I talking to?
- Higgins, Deputy Director. Go ahead.
Hit confirmed. Six cold items.
- Quality? - Clean, fast, first rate.
Did you say 6? It should be 7.
- I repeat: 6. Here's a rundown:
Lappe, Chan, Russell, Jennings.
Martin and Mitchell.
- Alright Augie 1. Find 7.
"Condor".
Researcher, Tidepool, likes to read comics.
Who is it?
Hey, you ring my buzzer?
It was a mistake, buddy.
Not you guys!
Hey, who are you?
Hey, who the hell are you?
Augie 3. We found item 7.
Ralf Heidegger. He bought it at home.
Okay, button it up, Augie.
I'll send you more janitors.
I need Langley, right away.
- Yes, sir.
Grover speaking. - Higgins, Deputy
Director, N Y. Give me Department 17.
Somebody took out one of your sections: 9-17.
New York. Somebody got mugged, maybe? - They were hit.
They're bookworms! - They got 7 out of 8. We're on the shuttle. 30 mins.
One of my people is still okay?
- Condor. You know him?
No. Can he say what happened?
- He was literally out to lunch.
What happened? - He's not in yet.
His first call was a little wild.
Who's bringing him in? - Higgins.
He's already booked on the shuttle.
I want a chopper on the pad, fuel for New York, now.
They're waiting for you.
- What? - Your two friends.
They just got here.
Said you gave them the keys.
Mr. Turner?
This is the Major. - This is Condor.
- Standby. Routing you to N Y Center.
Condor on 1-1, Mr. Higgins.
Hello, Condor.
Who's this? - Deputy Director Higgins,
New York Center. Where are you?
I need a code name, why don't you?
Where are you?
Here.
You alright?
- Are you insane? Everybody's dead!
Take it easy and we'll bring you home.
Here's how:
Do you know the Ansonia Hotel?
- Broadway and 71 st. - 73rd.
There's an alley behind the hotel.
One hour from now, at exactly 15:30,
I want you to enter that alley from the 73rd Street side.
Will you be there?
The head of department came from D.C...
He'll bring you home.
I've never met him. - Don't worry.
He's studying your photos now.
I don't know you either.
- We'll meet.
He'll carry a Wall Street Journal.
- There were two guys at my house.
What were you doing there?
- I was homesick. Who were they?
They were ours.
- What were they doing in my house?
I'm not going in any alley and fuck the Wall Street Journal!
Turner, it's been a long, bad day.
You've been under... - Damn right!
Alright. We'll bring a familiar face.
Somebody you know.
Who's left? - You've got a friend in statistics named Sam Barber.
You guys are something...
- Will he do?
Yes. Sam will do.
Alright, Turner. Stay well for 60 minutes and you're home.
Can I ask a question?
- Sure.
What is happening?
- I'll talk to you in 60 minutes.
You've got 55.
This is ridiculous.
- It's standard procedure.
To pick up a friend?
- And you, Mr. Wicks? - No, thanks.
Side arm?
- Have you got a.45?
You bet.
- Hey, let me help you with that.
How long have you known Condor?
- Joey...
Before he was a bird even.
We went to CCN Y. My wife Mae, too.
Was she ever Condor's girl?
- Here you go, Mr. Wicks.
Tell me what happened today.
- When?
This morning. About those murders.
What murders?
Here he is.
Hey, Sam. Where's that other...
What are you doing?
It's him, it's him!
Katherine Hale. H-A-L-E.
...172-208-875. Amount $51,86
Where's there enough snow this early?
- In Vermont.
What's open, Sugar Bush?
- Not downhill.
This is cross-country.
- Don't like the lift lines?
474, thank you.
Kathy!
Kathy, where have you been?
Let me give you a hand.
Wait, I don't know...
- Be quiet.
Get in the car.
Don't make a sound, don't be dumb.
Please don't hurt me. - Where do you live? - Brooklyn Heights.
Alone?
- I live with a friend...
You live alone. Come on, let's go.
Leave the stuff.
Hi, Kath.
You should have said hello.
Where is it?
- Here.
"Condor shot us both."
That was the only statement he could make before they operated on him.
And the other man, Barber? Is he dead?
- Before he hit the ground.
A remarkable shot.
A half-inch above his flak jacket.
Was Condor qualified with a handgun?
"Two years military service,
Signal Corps,
Telephone lineman, switchboard maintenance, 6 months overseas,
Separated 9/61, worked at communication research college."
The question was:
Is he qualified with a handgun?
No, sir. M-1 rifle and carbine.
Evidently it was sheer luck.
Or else...
Or else what? - Condor isn't the man his file says he is.
Where did he learn the basic moves?
- He reads.
What the hell does that mean?
- He reads everything.
I don't understand...
- Yes... very good.
Has Operations got anything?
- Absolutely nothing. - Extraordinary.
It was very well executed.
- It requires planning, communication, tracks.
I'm not asking for footprints but a blade of grass, a broken twig...
Yes, sir. Wicks seems to be all we've got. - Where do we have him?
We don't.
They rushed him to emergency before we got word.
Maybe we should leak the name of the hospital. Get Condor to make a move.
Don't expect too many mistakes from this man.
He does seem rather more interesting than just another reader researcher.
Example: Has he gone into business for himself? Was he turned around?
Does someone operate him?
Sexual? Broke?
Vulnerable?
Could he be a soldier of fortune?
Did he arrange the hit?
Is that why he's still in flight?
Still, he may be an innocent.
But then, why didn't he come in gently, with Mr Wicks?
"Tentrex Industries". - It's a cover.
I work for the CIA.
Jesus, your assignment for today was to go out and kidnap a girl.
Look it up. "Tentrex Industries".
And look up the number for the CIA in
New York. - You mean it's listed?
Under US Government Agencies.
Is this what you do?
This photography?
It's the same number. You could have had the card made. - But I didn't.
You really get into it, don't you?
- Sit down!
I told you I had a friend.
I take 151/23/4. What size are you?
- What are you, a clown?
I'm scared! - So am I! - What for?
You've got a gun! - Yes!
That is not enough.
I work for the CIA,
I'm not a spy.
I just read books.
We read everything that's published in the world.
And we feed the plots, dirty tricks, codes into a computer and the computer checks against actual CIA plans and operations.
I look for leaks,
I look for new ideas.
We read adventures and novels and journals...
Who'd invent a job like that?
Listen!
People are trying to kill me! - Who?
- I don't know, but there's a reason.
There is a reason!
And I just need some safe quiet time to pull things together.
Here?
- Here.
It's only fair...
Where's the guy with the shirts?
- He's skiing in the Green Mountains.
We want to go cross-country skiing for a couple of weeks.
Away from everything.
What time's the news go on? Six?
- Six o'clock. - 40 Minutes.
No, please...
Lie down against the wall.
Put this arm behind you.
Now you listen to me:
I am tired.
I've got to close my eyes for a while.
I can't think straight.
If you try to move or climb off the bed,
I'll know it. I'll feel it, and I promise I'll hurt you.
Can't I stay in the other room?
I believe what you told me.
No, you don't.
I don't know if I do.
That includes Condor, of course.
Yes, I owe you Condor.
Otherwise...
- "Otherwise" does not exist.
Will Condor take long?
- Do you want an estimate?
There is a time factor.
- Always with you people.
Condor is an amateur.
He's lost, unpredictable and perhaps even sentimental.
He could fool a professional.
Not deliberately, but precisely because he is lost.
He doesn't know what to do.
Unlike Wicks, who has always been entirely predictable.
The man Condor killed in the alley? - Some friend of his.
A close friend? - I suppose so. Why?
- It interests me.
What was his name?
- I don't know. He was nobody.
He was somebody for Condor.
Get his name and adress.
Have it for me when I call you.
What about Wicks?
Do you want the firm to question him?
They will, you know.
We don't want that.
Cost you nothing.
I was careless with Condor.
Wicks will be done for nothing.
What time is it?
- It's news time.
Lonely pictures.
So?
You're funny.
You take pictures of empty streets and trees without leaves...
It's winter.
Not quite winter...
They look like...
...November.
Not autumn, not winter, in-between.
I like them.
Thanks.
The shootings behind the Hotel Ansonia remain a mystery.
The victims' identities have not been revealed...
Victims?
Can you say anything about a motive?
- Not at present.
Have you identified the victims?
- Insurance company employees. - What?
Did the victims know their assailants?
- Absolutely not.
One man dead, one seriously wounded in an alley in Manhattan.
And the man with the gun is still at large. - Sam!
Jesus Christ, victims...
What is he saying?
What happened in that alley?
I didn't shoot him.
You shot somebody. - But not Sam!
Nobody in that alley said anything about the CIA.
But they were there.
You're telling me... - They had to have been to change that story.
What did Higgins say?
He said he wouldn't be there.
The section chief was coming in...
He'd have to reach Sam.
Sam would have to call Mae.
I need your car. - Grand theft! You don't want trouble with the police.
This guy in Vermont. What'll he do if you don't show up?
He probably call soon.
Will he show up here?
- The gun gives you the right to rough me up... - Rough you up?
- Yes, what are you doing in my house?
Have I raped you?
- The night is young.
You don't believe anything I've said.
I believe you're in trouble. In danger.
But I don't know what kind and I'm not sure how much of it is made up.
It doesn't matter.
Wait a minute.
I'm trying to understand...
What are you doing? Let me go!
You bully!
Don't tie me up, please!
This is...
...unfair!
- I know.
You're early.
Come on in.
Is Janice working late?
So is Sam.
Pour one for me, too, will you?
It's their own fault if we're zonked when they get here.
We'll give 'em an hour and if they're not here, it's just you and me, just like old times...
What is it?
What is it, Joey?
What's wrong?
How do you know Sam's working late?
What do you think he's doing?
- Did he call? - 2 or 2:30.
What did he say exactly?
He had the Center call.
Who? - I didnt't recognize the voice.
It wasn't the usual lady.
Third damn time tonight.
It's some creepy burglar.
I want you to get out of here.
- I can't, Joey, I'm cooking!
Go to Bill and Eileen's.
Stay there till I call you.
Don't argue! Move!
Go upstairs and stay there.
Do what I'm telling you!
Stay there.
I'll call you.
- Joey, you're scaring me!
Yours?
No.
Fifth floor, ladies' underwear.
Kids...
Probably the same everywhere.
That's the second floor.
I do it all the time.
After you.
- Go ahead.
Anybody here good with a coat hanger?
I locked my keys in my car.
I'll give you some money.
You can't tell me you never busted into a car before. 5 bucks.
I don't have much time.
Okay? Come on.
Alright, 5 bucks.
I want you to answer the phone.
I'm not answering any phone!
Answer it!
Tell him what a great son of a bitch you are!
I want you to be casual and nice.
Where the hell are you?
Ben?
- Who do you think it is?
You're supposed to be up here by now.
- I know...
I was held up.
That's no excuse. Come on.
Does this trip matter to you?
It matters.
- Yeah, sure...
No, it does! - This has happened over and over. Last minute some excuse.
No, this is different.
- What's up?
The car...
...broke down.
- What broke down?
The generator went.
- That's gonna take for ever.
Maybe not.
I tried to call you before, but...
The generator...
...it's going to take too long.
Look, forget about the car.
Take the bus first thing tomorrow.
I'll try.
Try...?
What's going on? Are you okay?
I'm okay. I'm fine.
- You don't sound so fine.
I wish you would understand.
I do. I do. It's just that
I'm disappointed, that's all.
I really wanted to be with you up here.
I know.
We'll have time.
- Yeah.
Get the very first bus out in the morning, okay?
Alright.
Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.
Listen, I'll be going.
In the morning.
Where?
Was it alright?
Alright?
Outside. Was it safe?
I'm not sure.
I wish I knew more.
About you.
Yesterday...
Today...
I don't remember yesterday.
Today it rained.
Why did you tie me up like that?
You thought I'd call the police.
I wouldn't have.
Why?
Sometimes...
...I take a picture that isn't like me, but I took it, so it is like me.
I put those pictures away.
I'd like to see those pictures.
We don't know each other that well.
Do you know anybody that well?
I don't think
I want to know you very well.
I don't think you're going to live much longer.
Well, I may surprise you.
You're not telling the truth.
What? - You want somebody, who's not gonna live much longer.
At least somebody who'd be on his way.
You take pictures.
Beautiful pictures...
...of empty streets and trees with no leaves in November.
Why haven't you asked me to untie your hands?
How much do you want?
I just want to stop it.
For a few hours, for the rest of the night.
Then I'll go.
What was his name?
What did Higgins say?
Your Department Head'll bring you in.
- I've never met him.
Anything in the early pouch?
HQ at Langley says there's no other source to support your theory.
HQ at Langley says there's no other source to support your theory.
Wicks!
You didn't sleep well.
- You didn't?
No, you didn't.
You were up early.
I had some thoughts.
I've got a plan.
I don't know if it'll work or not, but...
...I'll need your help.
- Have I ever denied you anything?
When things quiet down, you really are a very sweet man to be with.
You had bad dreams.
You talked in your sleep.
What did I say?
- Who's Janice?
Was she a volunteer, or a draftee like me?
She was...
...a friend.
She's dead.
Do I have permission to shower?
- You don't have to help.
I'll help. You can always depend on the spy fucker.
I'm sorry... - No.
- No, I didn't mean...
I didn't mean to say that.
I'm really sorry.
I'd like to help you.
18... Isn't that...?
- Yes.
A.I.D. In I.C.U. 1098.
Insured package for Katherine Hale.
Leave it on the stoop.
Somebody's got to sign for it.
She's not here.
Okay, you can sign.
Her name on top, yours on the bottom.
Wonderful. - Government pens.
I don't have another pen.
I'll get one.
Now listen: You're okay.
You're okay!
Can you get dressed?
You're okay! Get dressed, hurry.
Stella's Boutique.
Extension 1891, please.
- Pardon me?
Is this 6623799?
- Yes, it is.
There's no extension 1891? - We're lucky if we have any phone service!
Operator.
What's the area code for Washington,
D. C.? - 202.
CIA, Langley?
Extension 1891.
Let me speak to Mr. Wicks.
He's not here just now.
May I ask who's calling?
How do you feel? Okay?
- What did you do to those people?
What people?
I don't know who they are.
I file a report and a guy in Washington reads it.
Then he comes to New York to shoot me.
- Did you know him?
No. - Did you know the mailman?
- No, but the guy in Washington did. - And the next one? - I won't wait for him.
Has he gone double or dirty?
- I don't know, sir.
Is he still in New York City?
- I wouldn't be.
Question: Is there an intelligence network undetected by the CIA, linking Arabic-speaking countries with Spanish-speaking?
We're already visible, let's not become conspicuous.
If our agents aren't enough, use freelance.
Use whatever it requires, but end it.
Okay, let's get it over with.
Thanks.
Applications are here.
See Mr. Addison. Turn right, first door on your left.
Mr. Addison?
He's in Clearance.
You passed it on your left.
Sorry, thank you.
I didn't get the job.
Looks good...
I have this friend and he asked me to give you a message.
Quote: "Mr Higgins, this introduces a friend of mine, 'Sparrow Hawk'.
Please accompany her to the Nassau Street exit, now."
Personally, I'd do it, because he has this huge gun and he's looking at us right now.
I'll save this for you. Shall we?
To your left, please.
Okay, sit up!
Back up against the panel.
Take it easy, I'm not armed.
They could be DF-ing us if you have a transmitter hidden. What's this?
DF? You do read everything, don't you?
- Something is rotten in the Company!
You never complained till yesterday.
- You never killed my friends before!
Who's she?
- Who hit the Lit. Society?
We had a big meeting about that.
Your name came up.
"Five Continents lmports".
Ring a bell?
Where did you get that?
- The mailman.
The one you sent with the uniform, automatic gun...
We never use mailmen. - Would you know a tall blond man, 6ft 4?
Strong like a farmer, not American.
Accent, maybe Alsace-Lorraine?
Yes?
- Was the letter delivered?
The return receipt has not arrived.
- You should have done it yourself.
A more complicated package had to be handled.
But I might have underestimated this one.
I was told you never make that kind of mistake.
What will you do?
- Wait.
Then what? - People who move leave word of change of adress.
I want to see that report.
- Do you know him?
Professionally, yes.
- He kills people!
Yes.
He works for the Company?
- Did once. He's a contract agent.
Freelance.
Where did you see him?
It would help if I knew.
- Help who?
Who'd hire him now?
- Anybody. - Terrific answer!
I know.
- What's his name?
When I knew him, Joubert.
Who'd hire him? You don't look him up in the Yellow Pages! - Right.
Have to be somebody in the Community.
- Community?
Intelligence field. - "Community"?
You guys are kind to yourselves!
I want to see that report. - It went to headquarters and disappeared.
Who read it?
- You mean besides Wicks?
You tell me.
I pick up traces of an intelligence network the company doesn't know.
And I report it. Now why is that going to make anybody mad?
Unless it was the Company's network and you didn't want it blown!
Somebody is lying, Higgins.
Come on. Why is everybody so shy?
I'm not shy.
I don't know. That's what worries me.
I don't know.
- Ask Wicks. - Wicks died.
Someone yanked him off the life-support system at the hospital.
Get me in, Higgins.
What good would that do, if they are inside, what good would that do?
What should I do?
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're sorry?
I get it.
You expect me to draw fire!
Like a penny arcade bear parading back and forth waiting for somebody!
And you'll pick him up before he does it, or after?
I'm gonna cross-check all the names.
Nice talking to you, Higgins.
- Wait, where will I find you?
I'll find you.
Do you trust him?
Trust...
- Does he trust you?
He can't trust anybody. - How could anybody sneak in and fool them?
Maybe nobody did. - Then...
Maybe there's another CIA...
...inside the CIA.
The light's gone off!
It's a hotel room.
- What hotel?
There's no tag. It's Room 819 in New
York. - There's a code on the edge.
You in the trade?
I read about it in a story.
- A story about locksmiths?
The lock manufacturer can give you the name of the hotel.
I don't want to read about you in the newspapers.
Will you make the call?
I'm doing a survey.
Do you believe the condor is an endangered species?
Your room number, please.
I just had an interesting call.
- Who is this?
In reference to an all but extinct bird, the condor.
Have you had such a call?
- You're a fool to call me here!
You had no such call?
- No.
Must have been the Audubon Society.
They're still in New York City.
Langley, Computer.
State your program at the tone.
G... Carriage return.
TRS. Tone, symbol for number.
Computer is ready.
That number is 202-227-0098.
CNA, Mrs. Coleman.
Harold Thomas, Customer Service requesting a CNA on...
One moment please.
That would be
Mr. Leonard Atwood, 365 Mackenzie PI.,
Chevy Chase, Maryland.
Cross-check this tape against Wicks and hold for any intersects.
Hat size...
"Lucifer"...
- Alright, run "Lucifer".
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.
This is the Major.
- Condor. Find me Higgins.
Routing you, Condor. Stand by.
Hello, Condor.
Holiday Inn, 57th Street.
- Is that where you are?
Room 819. If you move it, you'll find the Alsatian. - Where are you?
Where are you, Condor?
- Quiet down...
Higgins?
Yeah, I'm right here.
Who is Atwood?
Where are you, Higgins?
Aren't we pals anymore?
Something?
Major?
- Got him!
Let me see that.
What's he doing in Brooklyn?
We can get...
- Wait!
What's going on? - The son of a bitch wired together 50 phones!
What? - Everybody in Brooklyn is talking to each other!
I didn't know you smoked.
- I quit three years ago.
You look pale.
- It's the light in here.
What will you do there?
See a guy.
- More secrets...
Like those pictures you hide.
Yes...
Someday I'd like to show them to you.
If you live through this.
You could drive me to Washington.
No.
You have a lot of very fine qualities.
But...
- What fine qualities?
You have good eyes.
Not kind, but they don't lie, and they don't look away much and they don't miss anything.
I could use eyes like that.
You're overdue in Vermont.
Is he a tough guy?
He's pretty tough...
What will he do?
- Understand. Probably.
Boy...
That is tough.
All aboard for Baltimore and Washington D. C...!
Kathy... I need time.
Eight hours or so, that's all.
Till noon, to do what I have to do.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- No.
Are you going right to Vermont?
Yes.
What I mean is, don't call anyone.
Don't stop, please.
Don't tell anyone about...
Jesus, I didn't...
Hey, you take care of yourself.
- I'll do my best.
Do your best.
Why aren't you further along?
- With the Company, sir?
You seem perfect for it.
Are you perfect for it, Mr. Higgins?
I try to be, sir.
You were recruited out of school?
- No, interviewed in Korea.
You served with
Colonel Donovan in the OSS?
I sailed the Adriatic with a movie star at the helm.
It doesn't seem like much of a war now, but it was.
I go even further back than that.
Ten years after the Great War, as we used to call it before we knew enough to number them.
Do you miss that kind of action?
- No.
I miss that kind of clarity.
Yes?
Thank you.
He's being held at New York Center.
Mr. Higgins, you do understand the Company's position?
There's nothing in the way of your doing this, is there?
What is this? What's going on?
Who are you?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm Condor.
Sit down.
What do you do for a living?
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you do...
...exactly?
Deputy Director of Operations.
What section?
- Middle East.
What are you working on?
What are you doing?
What's the secret worth murdering everybody at the A. L. H. S.?
There's no secret.
- Wicks showed you my report.
Yes.
It was your network I turned up.
Doing what?
Doing what?
What does Operations care about a bunch of books, a book in Dutch?
A book out of Venezuela...
Mystery stories in Arabic.
What is so important about...
...oil fields?
Oil...
That's it, isn't it?
This whole damn thing was about oil!
Wasn't it?
Yes, it was.
Don't turn around.
Put your thumb on the hammer.
Release it slowly.
Set down the gun on the desk.
Don't move.
You were quite good, until this.
This move was predictable.
What?
Did you touch anything else?
You're working for the Company again!
The desk? The lamp?
Jesus, they took you back!
Just for this. For Atwood.
He's with the Company! Why...?
I'm not interested in "why", more in
"when", sometimes "where".
Always "how much".
I suspect he was becoming an embarassment.
As you are.
So you're not finished?
- Pardon?
Oh, no, I had no arrangement with the Company concerning you.
They didn't know you would be here.
I knew you would.
Didn't you send the mailman?
That was a business arrangement with Atwood.
But you see...
Come on.
Tell me about the girl.
What about the girl?
She was chosen... how?
By age? Her car? Appearance?
- At random.
Chance.
- Really...?
Can I drop you?
I'd like to go back to New York.
You have not much future there.
It will happen this way:
You may be walking, maybe the first sunny day of spring.
And a car will slow beside you, and a door will open and someone you know, even trust, will get out.
And he will smile. A becoming smile.
But he will leave open the car door and offer to give you a lift.
You seem to understand it all so well.
What would you suggest?
Personally, I'd prefer Europe.
- Europe? - Yes.
The fact is, what I do is not a bad occupation.
Someone is always willing to pay.
I would find it...
...tiring. - Oh, no, it's quite restful. It's almost peaceful.
No need to believe in either side, or any side.
There is no cause.
There's only yourself.
The belief is in your own precision.
I was born in the US, Joubert.
I miss it when I'm away too long.
A pity.
I don't think so.
Can you drop me at the station?
It would be my pleasure.
For that day.
Higgins!
Why do call so late?
We were worried. - Likewise.
Is the car for me? - Yeah, it's safe.
You have a few hours of debriefing.
Let's say for the purposes of argument, I had a.45 in my pocket, you'd take a walk with me, right?
Which way?
West. Slowly.
Stay in front of me 3 or 4 steps.
Where are we going?
Wave them on ahead.
Do we have plans to invade the Middle East?
Are you crazy?
- Am I?
Do we have plans?
- No, absolutely not.
We have games. That's all.
We play games. What if?
How many men? What would it take?
How can we destabilize a regime?
That's what we're paid to do.
- Walk on.
Go on.
So Atwood just took the games too seriously. He was really gonna do it.
Renegade operation. There was no way.
Not with the heat on the Company.
What if there hadn't been any heat?
What if I hadn't stumbled on the plan?
Different ball game.
There was nothing wrong with the plan.
The plan was alright.
The plan would've worked.
What is it with you people?
You think not getting caught lying is the same as telling the truth?
No. It's simple economics.
Today, its oil.
In 10 or 15 years it'll be food, plutonium. Maybe even sooner.
What do you think the people will want us to do then?
Ask them.
- Not now, then.
Ask them when they're running out.
Ask them when there's no heating.
When their engines stop.
When people who've never known hunger go hungry.
They won't want us to ask them, they'll just want us to get it.
Boy...
...have you found a home!
7 people were killed.
- The Company didn't order it!
Atwood did.
And who is Atwood?
He's all you guys.
7 people killed.
And you play fucking games!
Right.
And the other side does too.
That's why we can't let you stay outside.
Go on home.
Go on. They've got it.
Just look around.
That's where they ship from.
They've got all of it.
What did you do?
I told them a story.
You play games. I told them a story.
Oh, you poor dumb son of a bitch!
You've done more damage than you know.
I hope so.
You'll be a very lonely man.
It didn't have to end this way.
- If course it did.
How do you know they'll print it?
You can take a walk but how far if they don't print it?
They'll print it.
How do you know?
DEEP RED
Great!
Really, that's good. Very good.
Maybe a bit too good.
Too clean. Yes, too precise.
Too... formal.
It should be more trashy.
See what I mean?
Remember that this sort of jazz came out of the brothels...
...and this phenomenon, as the latest studies confirm, is not restricted to superior species but includes vertebrates and invertebrates as well.
Butterflies, termites, zebras, all these animals, and many more, use telepathy to transmit orders and relay information.
This is a proven fact that can easily be demonstrated.
For instance, if we put a butterfly in a cage, within a few hours, it will be able to gather many other butterflies around it which will quickly swarm in, in answer to its call, even covering a distance of several miles. This is telepathy.
The faculty comes naturally to the newborn in the early stages of life but they lose it as they acquire means of verbal communication.
On the other hand, certain rare individuals, for reasons as yet unknown to us, do not lose this faculty.
One such exception is Mrs Helga Ulmann who is here in Italy for a series of conferences.
Helga has extraordinary telepathic powers.
We've been amazed by her natural inclination for the paranormal.
I will let her tell you herself.
Helga Ulmann.
I would like to point out immediately that my faculties have nothing whatsoever to do with magic, the esoteric or fortune-telling.
I pick up facts the very moment they occur or have occurred but nothing of what is to come.
I can feel thoughts the very instant they are formed.
Some I can even sense a long time afterwards, being so strong, that they linger about the room like cobwebs.
You, sir.
Yes you, in the third row, with your right hand in your pocket.
You're clutching a bunch of keys.
Four keys, one of them very long.
It's true. Look, they're right here!
Your name is Pietro...
Forgive my pronunciation... Valgoi?
Yes, Valgoi, that's right.
Mr Valgoi, excuse me.
May I ask you something?
Do you know Mrs Ulmann by any chance?
- No.
- Forgive my persistence.
Could you have met her before and told her your name?
How could I? I live in Bologna.
I only arrived in Rome three hours ago!
It's absolutely impossible.
Good, thank you, sir.
No, no!
Out! Out! No!
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
There is something...
...someone.
No, I don't know what it is.
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
Helga?
I can't explain what it was.
Something strange and sharp, like a knife entering my flesh.
Please forgive me, but it's all right now, thank you.
I feel it again.
It's here. I can feel death.
I feel a presence.
I have entered into contact with a perverse mind!
Its thoughts are of death.
Go away!
You...
...have killed and you will kill again!
That children's song and that house down there and...
...death.
And that blood!
I'm scared, I'm scared!
Helga, it's all right!
Calm down, that's enough!
Yes, let's hide everything, as if nothing happened in the house.
Everything back the way it was.
No one must know, no one must find out!
Just forget, forget everything...
...forever... forever.
Are you OK?
Anything I can do for you?
Get some help?
It was all so clear, believe me.
It was so frightfully clear.
Like a thorn piercing my brain.
I heard his twisted thoughts, cruel and yet childish at the same time.
How odd.
Before, in front of the audience,
I couldn't express all the sensations that gathered in my mind, but I'll write them all down tonight at home.
I'll let you have it tomorrow.
You may use it as you see fit.
I'm saying this because now, you see,
I also know who that person is.
- What's the matter?
- No, it's nothing.
Those evil thoughts must be here, stagnating in this room.
Just a moment ago it came back to me.
I must admit I'm frightened.
I'm really frightened.
I really need some rest.
I'm feeling very tired.
Shouldn't we talk about that right away?
I'd like this article to be published while I'm still in Italy.
Yes, I am alone.
Yes, I am a bit jumpy, but don't worry.
We'll talk again tomorrow?
Hinno, Marc!
Hinno? What does that mean?
What are you talking about?
A client just said it to me in the bar.
He said it's a Tahitian word.
Or was it Madagascar?
I'm so damn drunk,
I can't even remember!
Anyway, it means alla salute, cheers, à votre santé, skål!
Listen, Carlo, when I was in America
I met a lot of people like you.
Heavy drinkers, they don't last long, you know?
Who says I want to last?
You're speaking like a true masochist.
You obviously have the vocation.
Definitely not a masochist, on the contrary.
You know...
...as long as I'm drunk...
...I'm as happy as a lark!
And I play better too!
I mean, the piano is like the body of a beautiful woman and I tickle her.
Cut it out!
Speaking of pianos, my half hour of fresh air is up.
I'll go back in to bang out a few more notes.
Otherwise, I won't get paid tonight.
On your feet, then. Up!
You know what, Marc?
The difference between you and me is purely political.
You see, we both play rather well.
But I am the proletarian of the pianoforte while you are the bourgeois.
You play for the sake of art and you enjoy it.
I play for a living.
It's not the same thing.
My, my! One of your philosophies
I wasn't aware of yet!
Actually, I just thought of it.
I'm really sharp when I'm drunk.
What was that?
A scream, I'd say.
Who knows, maybe a rape.
I drink to you, deflowered virgin!
Bye, Marc.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Five fatal blows, twelve wounds.
Probably from a hatchet or a butcher's cleaver.
The victim seems to be about
35 to 40 years old.
She has abrasions and cuts all over her body.
So, you're a foreigner, then?
Yes, I was born in London but I lived in America for several years before coming here.
And what are you doing in Italy?
I'm a pianist. Jazz.
I teach here at the conservatory.
- I teach jazz.
- And you play the piano, right?
So, in that case you don't have a job, right?
- I told you, I'm a pianist.
- Yeah, sure.
So, then, that's your only job.
Playing an instrument isn't a job?
What is it, a joke?
What are you saying?
No, I would never say that.
In fact, in my family
I have a cousin who plays the...
What?
The violin.
Strange paintings, huh?
Yes.
Did you move, change or take anything from here?
Are you crazy? We're very careful not to move anything.
Why? Is there something wrong?
No, no. I mean...
It's just an impression.
Sorry, you were asking?
Ah yes, the victim. After you.
You knew her, didn't you?
I already told you, I live upstairs.
Her name was Helga Ulmann.
- Coffee?
- Thank you.
Tell me about the raincoat the murderer was wearing.
Wait a minute. I didn't say the murderer was wearing it.
All I said was that I noticed a man with a dark raincoat walking away from the building.
Good evening. Hi, everybody!
Get lost!
You can't come in here.
Why not? With a crime like this, the first thing you do is call the press.
Get your hands off me!
I told you, you can't come in here!
This is a complex investigation.
Look who's here.
Gianna Brezzi.
Yes, Captain.
- Who told you about the crime?
- I have my sources.
The victim was rather famous, even in Italy.
In fact, she gave an important lecture this very afternoon.
What did this famous lady do?
She was a sort of magician.
She could read people's minds.
Well, I never!
I thought she was...
You! Yes, I'm sure of it. You're the one who saw the whole thing.
The eyewitness extraordinaire!
Fabbroni, get me Mingozzi.
I have something to tell him.
- Then call the station.
- Yes, Captain.
Why must I go to the police station?
I told you everything I know!
Your statement has to be typed up officially.
You know how it is with bureaucracy.
All your details are needed: place and date of birth, passport, etc.
My head is splitting!
And you, what the hell are you doing here at this hour?
I'm on my way home after four hours at the police station.
Oh yeah, right.
I forgot about the murder.
How did it go?
What kind of question is that?
How do you suppose it went?
Come on, I'll walk you home.
No, thank you.
I can make it by myself.
I can make it, I said!
Oh, my poor head, my head.
Tell me, how much did you drink?
Who knows? Who can remember anything about this night?
But I'm sure it must have been a lot.
Why not come to my place for coffee?
No thanks. Thanks anyway.
I'd rather sleep in my own bed.
Bye.
Carlo? Carlo?
Did you see that man leaving the building?
A man?
Yeah, a man in a dark raincoat.
Right after the murder.
I think he's the killer.
Wait, wait...
Yes, I saw him for a second from the back.
Listen, Carlo. Something very strange happened to me, and I don't know if it's true or not but when I went into that woman's apartment the first time
I thought I saw a painting.
But then a few minutes later it was gone.
What happened to me?
To you, nothing. But maybe the painting was made to disappear because it represented something important.
- What did you say?
- It represented something important!
No, I don't think so.
If I remember well, it was some sort of composition of faces.
It was very unusual.
Maybe you've seen something so important that you don't realise.
I'm just trying to understand, because...
You know, sometimes, what you actually see and what you imagine...
...get mixed up in your memory like a cocktail...
...where you can no longer distinguish one flavour from another.
But I'm telling you the truth!
No, Marc.
You think you're telling the truth, but in fact you're only telling your version of the truth.
It happens to me all the time.
That man there with the raincoat, that's Giordani.
He's a professor in psychiatry and a parapsychology enthusiast.
A great friend of Helga's.
He practically kept her.
The man with the glasses is Mario Bardi.
He's also a clairvoyant and was a good friend of poor Helga.
Let's go.
By the way, I wanted to thank you.
Good to be brought to the attention of murderers!
Come on!
You may not believe me, but I don't have a steady boyfriend right now.
- Me neither.
- I should hope not!
- I meant a girlfriend!
- That's why you're always so jumpy.
Me jumpy? Oh, please!
I'm not jumpy at all.
Yeah, right. Stop fidgeting!
And your hands are shaking.
Tell me, what's going on?
How many times must I tell you,
I'm an artist?
In case you've forgotten, we artists are very sensitive people.
We don't have elephant hide like you journalists.
Elephant hide?
I'm told I have very delicate skin.
You can touch it. Come on, try.
- Yes, not bad.
- It's fantastic.
I know how to stop your jumpiness.
What? Here at the cemetery?
Are you crazy?
I have other things on my mind.
Do you understand?
- Sure, you're scared senseless.
- I'm not scared!
Right.
You're almost shitting yourself.
And it's all my fault.
I'd like to see him.
I'm curious to see him face to face.
You'd be better off returning to England.
I actually decided to stay.
- You just decided?
- Yes, maybe.
Anyway, I need to concentrate.
I must try to remember.
I'm sure I saw something important that night but I can't remember what exactly!
Are you driving?
No, Marc, wait!
I have to get in this side.
The other door is jammed.
Oh, sorry!
Long live Italy!
That seat broke the other day.
Is it uncomfortable?
Why don't you help with this murder story?
If you could give me a hand on this scoop, maybe I can get away from reporting on the environment.
- What have you done?
- Nothing.
- You've locked the door!
- Why, shouldn't I have?
It jams.
We'll need a mechanic to open it.
That's all we need. Damn!
The car's not exactly new, you know?
- Just drive fast, will you?
- Why?
I'm a bit claustrophobic.
All right.
Tell me, Enrico, why do Australian boomerang sellers go bankrupt?
I don't know that one.
Because the goods are always returned!
Funny, don't you think?
- Is Carlo not in yet?
- He never shows up before 10:00.
Can you tell him I was looking for him?
I need to speak to him urgently.
Everything in the house.
Let's hide it all.
No, no one will ever find out.
We must forget.
We must forget everything.
Forever.
Forever. That's all.
She was pointing towards the middle of the sixth or seventh row.
And you can't remember anything?
Not even a face?
No, that's impossible.
All the lights were on us and the stalls were in darkness.
I must say, I do seem to recall, while Helga was speaking,
I noticed some kind of movement in the sixth or seventh or maybe the eighth row.
- I can't say exactly.
- What kind of movement?
Sorry, what did you say?
Could you repeat that, please?
I said what kind of movement?
It's hard to say.
As if someone had stood up and left the row, but it was just an impression more than anything else.
With the lights on, we couldn't see anything.
You see?
You're not jumpy any more.
You can even button your shirt without shaking at all.
Look, will you cut it out about being jumpy?
It's a question of my nature.
It's my artistic temperament.
Why did you become a pianist?
Well, my psychiatrist would say it's because I hated my father...
...so when I press the keys, it's like smashing his teeth.
Actually, it's because I love music.
What about you?
Why are you a journalist?
Because I like working.
I think a woman has to be independent to be equal to a man.
Oh, God, let's not start on gender equality!
It's all rubbish, not true at all.
Men and women are different.
Women are delicate... Fragile.
What? Delicate?
Fragile?
- Why are you clearing the table?
- Come here.
- What's this?
- Arm wrestling.
Come on.
Then we'll see who's delicate!
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Are you afraid?
That was cheating, completely.
You can't start before I'm ready!
- It doesn't count. Play by the rules.
- You too!
We do it properly or not at all.
Still want to try?
Will you play by the rules without cheating? Properly?
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
Let's go.
Both elbows on the table, no sudden movements.
- I know the rules!
- We'll start when I say, OK?
Ready?
Steady... steady, wait...
One...
...two...
...three...
Go!
That doesn't count either!
You lifted your elbow off the table.
That's a dirty old trick!
- You're a cheat! It's so ridiculous!
- You're right.
- You go around challenging people!
- You're big and macho. I surrender.
So, where are we going now?
Where are we going?
I'm not going anywhere with you.
If anyone is going anywhere,
I'm going by myself.
Oh, sure, but where?
I'm off to see a friend, if you must know. I have things to do.
I can't sit here all day arm wrestling just to keep you amused!
I'm on to something important, but I'm not saying what. Clear?
Listen, don't be angry now.
Why can't I go with you?
- We started this together, right?
- No.
Statistics prove you can't work seriously with liberated women.
So, whether you like it or not,
I'm going on my own.
Have it your own way, stupid!
I'll do my own investigation, and we'll see who comes out on top.
What's that?
Another arm wrestling match?
Yes, sort of.
So be it. Wait!
You didn't tell me when I'll see you again.
Never.
Oh, really?
How about later tonight?
- When will you be back?
- I don't know.
I'll try to call you.
OK. But I'll tell you again that I don't...
If you don't want to, just say so.
I was just trying to say that I don't know what time I'll be back.
All right.
Bye.
Tell me the truth.
Do you find me so unattractive?
No.
So, what's wrong, then?
My scent? What?
Nothing at all, why?
Oh, nothing. I was just wondering.
Yes?
Excuse me, I'm Marc Daly.
I'm a friend of Carlo's.
Oh, do come in, Marc.
I know you by name.
Carlo mentions you very often.
You're an engineer, aren't you?
No, I'm a pianist.
I teach at the conservatory.
A pianist? Please, come in.
What can I offer you?
Coffee, a drink of something?
No, thank you, nothing.
I just came to see Carlo.
He wasn't at the Blue Bar, so...
A drink? Is this all right?
It's Coca Cola!
I'll just make some coffee...
No, please. Don't go to any trouble.
I just came to see Carlo.
I'll call him, then.
I'm so absent-minded.
I'm sorry, Carlo is not here.
He's gone out.
But come here, Marc.
Come and talk to me.
Take a seat.
Tell me about yourself.
How long have you been an engineer?
- No. Madam, I'm a pianist.
- And I'm an actress.
Or rather I was an actress.
Look at those photos.
What do you think?
Was I good or not?
Yes, I'm sure. I just wish
I'd had the opportunity to...
Never mind. When I married
Carlo's father, Carlo wasn't yet born.
He made me give up my career.
Now, it's all gone.
It's not important now.
I console myself playing the piano.
- Do you play the piano?
- The piano? I'm a pianist.
Oh, what a magnificent combination!
A piano playing engineer!
Could we play a duet?
No, unfortunately
I don't have time.
I really need to see Carlo urgently.
Do you know where he is?
He went to see a friend.
Someone called Massimo Ricci.
28 Via Crescenzio.
Sorry, my mistake.
I'm looking for a friend, Carlo.
His mother gave me this address.
Is he here?
Yes, do come in.
Thank you.
You don't know how ill he's been.
I wish I knew what's come over him.
He's still very sick.
See. He's been like this for over an hour.
He started drinking, as usual.
Maybe more than usual.
Then he started talking nonsense.
Look who's here.
You caught me red-handed.
Good old Carlo.
He's not only a drunk but a faggot as well.
Surprise!
I don't give a damn about your preferences!
But I already told you, you won't last long if you drink so much.
And I told you, who wants to last?
The liver is gone, and so are the intestines.
Come on, try to get up. Put your head under a cold tap. It will do you good.
Then I'll take you out for some fresh air.
I love that guy.
But he's always so sad.
He drank a lot today.
Then he started talking nonsense.
I think he's cracking up.
He said he wanted to go away.
Then he wanted to make love.
Then he wanted to sleep.
He kept getting worse.
And then he started to scream.
I was about to call a doctor.
Would you like some coffee?
No, it's very late already.
I need to go, or I'll be thrown out of the Blue Bar for good.
Are you coming with me?
Yes.
Bye.
Sorry... for what happened before.
Don't be silly. Call me.
Goodbye.
- Why did you come looking for me?
- I wanted to ask you something.
Remember the other night, the night of the murder?
I said I thought I saw a painting in that house.
But a few moments later it was gone, remember?
- Vaguely.
- Do you have a light?
You said that maybe the painting represented something important.
Then you said a lot of things about memory and truth.
Things I didn't understand at the time.
Yeah.
I remember something a bit muddled but I can't remember what I wanted to say.
I was probably talking nonsense.
I was really drunk.
Listen to me, Marc.
Why don't you just pack up and clear out?
What are you doing messing with this business anyway?
Why are you aggravating a madman?
A maniac?
Anyone committing such a monstrous crime has to be a maniac.
If you must know,
I'm attracted to madmen.
I can't help it.
I have a morbid fascination for them.
But wait, wait. Listen.
That painting was definitely there.
I didn't imagine that.
And I feel there's something important about it.
So now... it's become a kind of challenge with my memory.
- A challenge.
- Right, a challenge.
I challenge myself too, all the time.
And I always lose.
But this is different for you.
If you lose, apart from the challenge, you'll end up getting murdered yourself!
...police have set up several checkpoints.
There's been no further news on the murder of German mind reader, Helga Ulmann.
Police are concentrating their investigation on a person seen leaving the scene of the crime that very night.
According to an unofficial newspaper report, the eyewitness can identify the mysterious night visitor.
Carlo should be careful.
If they find out he's a good pianist, they'll get rid of him for sure!
Whoever you are, please help me!
Marc? It's me, Gianna!
What are you talking about?
You won't get away.
I'll kill you sooner or later.
Hello?
- What is it? Hello? Hello?
- Listen, Gianna!
There's somebody in the house.
He spoke to me. He wants to kill me!
- Should I call the police?
- Wait a second.
Hello?
No doubt about it.
That's the same song I heard last night.
And if I remember correctly you said Helga talked of a children's song in the theatre.
That's right, and this song may well be the recurring theme of the crimes.
You see, we're starting to form what I presume to be the right profile.
The murderer is a paranoid schizophrenic.
Anyone who kills with such a frenzy surely does so in a state of temporary insanity.
In everyday life, this person could appear quite normal.
Like you or me.
When he kills, he must recreate these specific conditions which trigger the release of all his madness.
A particular time and day of the week, even clothing.
Something that recreates the same images that frame a context that provoked trauma in the past.
I'd like to add something that is somewhat less scientific to this business of the children's song.
If you recall, as well as a child singing,
Helga also mentioned a house.
And I remember having read a strange book, quite some time ago.
I think the title was "The Modern Ghost and the Black Legends of Today".
The author spoke of a haunted house where the neighbours could sometimes hear singing, like this little song.
The book implied an act of bloodshed was once committed in that house.
Do you have that book?
No, but I think you could easily find it in the folklore library.
The Modern Ghost and the Black Legends of Today
"THE HOUSE
OF THE SCREAMING CHILD
"In a house near Rome, a strange thing happened.
"One night, a hunter woke before dawn
"and heard a child singing in a high shrill voice.
"Soon after, the voice stopped and he heard screaming and weeping."
No, nothing.
No news other than what Bardi gave me. No name, no address.
So, what are you going to do now?
I'd like to contact the author.
Can you write down her name?
Her name is Amanda Righetti.
Got it.
What the hell! What are you doing?
Why did you put the phone right here?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, listen.
Will you try to find out her address?
It's important.
She should know where this house is.
She probably knows other useful stuff too.
Listen, I'll call you back.
I can't hear a thing in this bar.
- What did you say?
- The address! Oh, this is impossible!
Can't you wait until I'm done?
It's like a sauna in here!
- When you come, remember the birds.
- Don't worry, Miss Amanda.
I don't understand why you keep these strange lndian blackbirds.
I feel less lonely. They imitate things, the television, our voices.
Oh, it's like having a madman around the house!
I'd be scared.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you, Elvira.
Elvira!
The child.
The house.
The ghost of the house.
You have two choices. You can either flee to Lebanon, quickly...
Or I can try to find out what's going on as soon as possible.
How long will the police take to find me?
Did you take a taxi to Amanda's?
No, a rental car.
Why haven't you fixed this seat?
- I feel silly sitting so low down!
- I forgot. Sorry.
They'll find you by your fingerprints.
I bet you left them all over the house, right?
It would take another Florence flood to wipe them clean!
Say they find the body tomorrow morning.
They'll check the prints against the usual suspects.
It'll take them a while to connect both murders, but in the end they'll be after you.
You only have a couple of days. It's not long.
No, it's not.
But first, I have to find this.
What a nice house. It looks strange.
Do you know where it is?
I wouldn't have to look for it if I knew!
- So, what are you going to do?
- I'm not telling you.
It seems like everything here has ears.
How could the killer know
I was coming here?
I have no idea.
One thing's for sure.
I'm not telling anyone my next move.
This is so unbelievable!
You're so nice!
Hey, darling,
I hope you don't think that I'm...
Listen, I'm doing this to protect you, to keep you out of danger.
- I promise, as soon as I...
- Blah, blah, blah!
I swear, as soon as I discover something, I'll tell you.
Why don't we stop this stupid childish competition?
We should be working together.
You know, two brains are better than one.
Just where do you women keep your brains?
Let's be honest.
Women have brute force, you beat us at arm wrestling, but men have the monopoly on intelligence.
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yes, very clear.
At last.
A little drink?
I have Anisette,
Sambuca, Caffè Borghetti.
Don't you have anything less sickly?
Whisky? Cognac?
Yes, that's better.
We'd be more comfortable at my place, don't you think?
Maybe, but we're fine here.
Yes, but I think it would be better at my place.
OK, let's go.
Who do you think you are, idiot?
I've never met a man as arrogant as you!
You must have been spoilt rotten by women!
Anyway, it's because I don't have a boyfriend right now. That's all!
You've got such a big head.
- Oh, damn.
- What's wrong?
Guess.
Yes, it's a dracaena indivisa.
I'm sure of it. An exotic tree that grows in the Canaries.
It's highly delicate.
It suffers if exposed to cold.
We've never imported it.
It's very rare in or around the city.
- No, sir, never handled it myself.
- Thanks.
No, never.
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
Absolutely.
But it was a long time ago.
I remember because I'd just opened.
I ordered some from the Canaries.
Unfortunately, most died.
The climate here isn't right for them.
I had lots of complaints.
I never ordered them again.
- Who did you sell them to?
- I'll check.
I'll look up the old invoices.
Why do you care?
I'm an architect.
It's for an environmental study.
Well, let's see what we can find.
Where's my bottle? Spit out my bottle, for Christ's sake! Damn you.
Captain, finally!
I've been looking for you for an hour!
What do you want?
Does no one check these machines?
They do, but they steal the drinks.
Of course!
This place is full of thieves!
- Sorry, sir, but you're not thinking.
- Not you, idiot.
So, are you doing overtime?
Yes. The strike's been called off for now.
Our requests are examined by the Ministry.
- But we're planning a sit-in.
- What are you planning?
A protest sit-in.
We all gather outside in the courtyard and stay there for one, two, four hours...
- What did you want to tell me before?
- I almost forgot.
The chief is here and he insists on speaking to you.
Oh, crap!
Hello? Is that Professor Giordani?
This is Marc Daly. I need to talk to you. It's very important.
No, I'd like to see you right now, if possible.
Amanda Righetti was murdered.
Her arm was out to the side and her finger was pointing at the wall.
It didn't look natural to me.
It was as if she was trying to point something out.
Do you think they've discovered the body by now?
Yes.
Maybe the pointing finger is a figment of your imagination.
I'll go over there and take a look.
You never know.
FOR SALE
TO LET
I'm just the caretaker.
The house belonged to Carl Schwartz.
- Where is he now?
- He died.
He was a German writer, an odd sort of fellow.
He bought the place in '68, I think.
Before then it had been empty for a long time.
People used to say it was haunted by ghosts.
Schwartz never heard the rumours.
He just thought the price was right.
Knowing him, he'd have bought it with the ghosts.
- And who lived there before?
- I don't know. I came here in '67.
This writer, Schwartz.
Do you know how he died?
An accident, poor fellow.
He fell out of a window.
I'm the one who found her, you know?
This morning, very early, around 8:00.
I come every morning to clean the house.
I could have died of shock!
The police kept me for hours asking all sorts, wanting to know everything.
But what could I tell them?
What do I know?
It hasn't been half an hour since they took out the body!
Poor Amanda.
Who could have done that?
A maniac, who else? It's always a maniac and they never catch them!
Where was the body?
In the bathroom.
Come, I'll show you.
Look at all this blood.
It's everywhere.
I'm going to clean up a bit.
I leave before it gets dark.
I'm not staying here alone!
Excuse me, I want to at least clean these marks off.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, it's you, Francesca.
Oh, if you only knew what I've been through.
No, no. They've gone.
Yes, they took her away.
Yes, they questioned me.
It was never-ending!
A big man with a moustache said I was an important witness, that I could help him.
I know quite a bit.
Of course I told him everything!
Oh, don't worry,
I'll take the 6:30 bus...
IT WAS...
What are you doing?
Why are you running the hot water?
I just wanted to find out who murdered Amanda.
With hot water?
Yes, with hot water.
Do you know if the police found anything?
Just a little doll.
- Anything else?
- I heard them mentioning a child.
Of course.
A child.
That's right.
A child.
My daughter will go with you.
I don't have time right now.
- There's no rush to return the keys.
- OK. Thank you.
Olga!
Come back this minute!
Come on!
- What is it?
- You little witch.
I told you not to do that again!
Now off you go!
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
Don't worry, my father's just a little crazy.
Bye.
Go home.
I'll return the keys later.
- Be careful!
- Why?
- There are ghosts in there!
- What ghosts?
I don't know, but everyone around here says so.
Bye.
Mr Daly!
- Mr Daly!
- Yes?
Thank goodness!
We didn't see you come back.
- Anything wrong?
- No, I was about to leave.
The lights were cut off a couple of years ago.
No one was living here.
What happened to your forehead?
It's nothing, just a scratch.
A piece of glass fell on my head.
I warned you to be careful.
Giordani.
- Hello, Gianna?
- Hi Marc. Having fun?
I'm having a ball.
I finished two crossword puzzles.
Well, I have a tough puzzle to solve here.
They killed Giordani not long ago.
The neighbours called the police.
They heard screaming.
- What happened there?
- Nothing, it's just a scratch.
Listen.
Seriously, I have to admit
I don't know what's going on right now.
This son of a bitch knows everything!
He knows every move in advance.
Sorry, but I don't remember where you said I should flee to?
- Lebanon.
- Yeah, right.
Lebanon.
But I'd have to fly to get there and I'm scared of flying.
It's nothing to be nervous about.
Just think you'll be landing soon, one way or another.
Thank you.
How about we take the car and drive to Spain?
We? You mean that I can come too?
- Yes, if you'd like to.
- Of course I'd like to!
We'll have a fantastic holiday!
Sun, sea, bullfights, parties, flamenco... How does it sound?
Sure, of course.
I suggested it, after all.
I don't know about you but I'm on the verge of a breakdown.
There's no point staying here and talking about it.
Come on. Let's not waste any time.
You go back home and pack.
I'll be back in an hour!
We'll have to rent a car, because mine isn't good for long trips.
I know.
I love you!
And who's this?
An old girlfriend.
Her name is Carol.
- From Rome?
- She's American. She lives in Paris.
You used to go for vamps, then?
You like super sexy women.
Hello? Good evening.
This is Marc Daly.
- Oh, the engineer.
- No, the pianist. Remember?
Could I speak to Carlo?
Is he home?
He just went out. Would you like to come here and wait for him?
We could chat.
Time flies when you have company.
Besides, maybe you didn't know, but I used to be an actress.
- What an idiot.
- I could recite... What did you say?
Nothing, sorry. Good evening.
Why didn't I notice that before?
Gianna - I'm at 24 Via Susa.
Marc x
I was right.
There's no window.
Great!
Forget it. It's too late.
What happened?
I found your note and I hurried here.
I saw a reddish light in one of the windows.
So I looked for you. You'd passed out, lying in the flames.
You know, you're lucky to be alive.
A few more minutes and you'd have been roast chicken!
Damn it! It's all lost.
The body, the walled-in room and that picture on the wall.
Yes, 24 Via Susa. My name is
Gianna Brezzi, I'm a reporter.
Yes, of course it's urgent.
Try and hurry up.
Yes, hello, Fire Department?
I want to report a fire at 24 Via Susa.
What's the phone number here?
Please hurry, the fire has been burning for a while.
I want to know how it started in the first place.
Well, if there are ghosts...
- Who gave you this?
- I did it.
That's impossible!
You couldn't have seen it!
Who gave it to you? Don't lie to me!
Leave her alone. She made it up.
She's a strange child.
If you could just see what she does to animals! She likes the macabre.
That may be true, but she couldn't possibly have imagined this!
It's identical to the one in the house!
I saw it at school.
Good girl. Now tell me where you got this. Just tell me.
One day, as a punishment, they made me clean up the archives.
There were lots of drawings, and in a '50s file, there was one just like that.
- Where do you go to school?
- The Leonardo da Vinci School.
LEONARDO DA VINCI
STATE MIDDLE SCHOOL
HEADMASTER
SECRETARY
ARCHIVES
There must be a million of them!
They're all divided by subject and academic year.

- What is it?
- Didn't you hear that?
No, what was it?
I don't know. I can't describe it.
You keep at it.
I'm going to take a look.
What do you say, I call the police and tell them we're here?
Yeah, you're right.
Gianna.
Gianna!
Marc, help me.
Gianna, darling!
Stay calm, darling.
All this for some shitty article!
You know who it is?
Yes, I know.
I found the picture.
Did you get that?
It's not far, you'll see it right away.
The name is over the door.
Leonardo da Vinci.
Don't hide.
It's no use hiding.
I know who you are now.
I read your name.
Carlo.
I got here too late.
What a shame.
So, now what are you going to do?
Kill you.
And I'm sorry because I like you.
But I have to do it.
I told you to stay out of it.
Pack up and clear out, I said!
Why didn't you listen to me?
Because you're stupid and stubborn.
Don't you realise it's all your fault?
You wouldn't let it go.
If you hadn't got involved, if you hadn't stuck your damn nose in...!
You'll pay for this.
He could have killed you!
- Over there! The wall!
- Stop or I'll shoot!
- She's out of danger.
- When will she wake up?
Not until tomorrow. The operation was difficult, but successful.
She's a strong girl, don't worry.
No, that's impossible.
He was with me when Helga was killed.
He saw the killer too.
It couldn't have been him!
It had nothing to do with him.
So why?
POLICE INVESTIGATION
Maybe that painting was made to disappear because it represented something important.
Something so important that you wouldn't even realise it.
Important.
That painting...
A mirror.
What an idiot.
It was just a mirror.
There never was a painting there.
What I saw was a reflection in the mirror.
I saw the face of the murderer.
Damn you... Damn you!
You caused my son's death!
He had nothing to do with any of this!
He was...
He was only trying to protect me.
He never hurt anyone!
What do you know about what happened?
Now, don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
It's all right.
I'll take you to the clinic myself.
No, I told you,
I'm not going back there again.
I told you. You can't force me again.
But it's for your own good, dear.
You heard what the doctor said.
No.
Afterwards, he says, they always embrace.
The animal digs his sweaty brow into his cheek,
and they stand in the dark for an hour,
like a necking couple.
And of all nonsensical things,
I keep thinking about the horse,
not the boy, the horse,
and what he might be trying to do.
I keep seeing the huge head, kissing him with its chained mouth,
nudging, through the metal, some desire absolutely irrelevant
to filling its belly or propagating its own kind.
What desire could this be?
Not to stay a horse any longer?
Not to remain reined up forever, in those particular genetic strings?
Is it possible, at certain moments we cannot imagine,
a horse can add its sufferings together,
the non-stop jerks and jabs
that are its daily life...
And turn them into grief?
What use is grief...
To a horse?
You see...
I'm lost.
What use, I should be asking, are questions like these to an overworked psychiatrist in a provincial hospital?
They're worse than useless.
They are, in fact, subversive.
The thing is...
I'm wearing that horse's head myself, all reined up in old language and old assumptions, straining to jump, clean-hooved, onto a whole new track of being
I only suspect is there.
I can't see it, because my educated, average head is being held at the wrong angle.
I can't jump, because the bit forbids it, and my own basic force, my...
Horsepower, if you like...
Is too little.
The only thing I know for sure, is this.
A horse's head is finally unknowable to me.
Yet I handle children's heads, which I must presume to be more complicated, at least in the area of my chief concern.
In a way, it has nothing to do with this boy.
The doubts have been there for years, piling up steadily in this dreary place.
It's only the extremity of this case that's made them active.
I know that the extremity is the point.
All the same, whatever the reasons, these doubts are now not just vaguely worrying, but... but intolerable!
Forgive me.
I'm not making much sense.
Let me start properly, in order.
All right.
Come on. Break it up. Come on!
Through this gate, into another field. I couldn't see it, but I knew I had to get through that gate. If I could get through it, then that was it,
I could see everything.
All right. All right.
Take one, Mary Ann.
I don't want one.
Mary Ann, come on.
Don't bother me.
You don't have to listen to them all the time.
Oh, I know, but, uh...
- Why not?
- You want one, take one.
Stop being so ignorant!
All right. All right, now.
Settle down.
Sucking it up?
That's no good. Shall we smash it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
No.
No?
Come on, we'll smash it.
No.
All right, now. Now pick up your right leg.
No.
Pick up your right leg, man.
Why?
Because you'd please me a great deal if you did.
I said, "No"!
Come on. Up.
Now scream! Jab it! Louder. Go on!
Scream! Scream!
That's it.
It began one Monday, some months ago,
with Hesther's visit.
Martin, I'm sorry. I should have called first, I know.
Not at all.
You're a welcome relief.
Have a filthy coffee?
No, please, no.
It's really rather urgent.
Take a couch.
Martin, I've just come from the most shocking case I ever tried.
My fellow magistrates wanted to send him to prison on the spot.
I mean, luckily, I got him remanded for a report.
Who's he?
A teenager. The name's Strang.
Ah.
What's he done? Dosed some little girl's Pepsi with Spanish fly?
What could possibly have thrown your court into such tory convulsions?
He...
Blinded 6 horses with a metal spike.
- Blinded?
- Yes.
All at once, or over a period?
All at once, the night before last.
Where?
In a stable over at Chalk Ford.
He worked there on weekends.
What did he say in court?
Nothing. He just sang.
Sang?
Martin, you've simply got to take him here.
You think this hospital is suitable?
How dangerous is he?
No, I mean, you, personally.
Now look, Hesther, before you say anything else,
I can take no more patients at the moment.
I can't even cope with the ones I have.
- You must.
- Why?
Thank you. Oh, for... damn!
Hello, Pat?
Yes. Now, my advice is, cancel her leave for a month.
See what difference that makes to her dad. Yes, exactly.
Now, why?
Because there's no one else within 100 miles of that desk who can handle him, and perhaps understand what this is all about.
The regular hospital will be useless, and so will the other doctors here.
That's an absolutely unwarrantable statement.
Well, it's true.
They'll be very cool and professional, and underneath, they'll be disgusted and immovably English, just like my court.
Well, what am I? Polynesian?
Please, Martin.
This is the last favor
I'll ever ask of you.
- No, it's not.
- No, it's not.
I mean, he's obviously abominable.
I know that already.
Why me? Why, Hesther?
'Cause there's something extraordinary about him.
In what way?
Terrible, if you like.
I don't quite know what I'm saying.
I'm...
Just knew I had to come here.
Take him, Martin.
It's very important.
What did I expect of him?
Very little, I promise you.
One more dented little face.
One more adolescent freak.
The usual unusual.
Now, this room will be completely yours.
No one will come in without your say so.
There's a bell if you need anything.
There's a lavatory down the corridor, 2nd door on the left.
I think this is one of the nicest rooms in the whole place.
Don't you, Mr. Pearce?
Absolutely.
Sometimes, I blame Hesther.
She brought him to me.
But of course, that's nonsense.
What is he but a last straw?
A last symbol. That's all.
I was ripe for the confrontation.
Alan Strang, Doctor.
Ah, thank you.
Hello.
My name's, uh, Martin.
Yours is Alan.
Won't you sit down?
For today, I just want a few simple facts.
Uh, is... is this your full name?
Alan Strang?
And you're 17, is that right? 17?
You work in an electrical shop during the week.
Electrical and kitchenware.
Well?
Double Your Pleasure
Double your fun
With Double-good, Double-good doublemint gum
Yes.
Now let's see, you live with your parents, and your father's a printer.
What sort of things does he print?
Double Your Pleasure
Double your fun
With Double-good, Double-good doublemint gum
I mean, does he do leaflets, calendars? Things like that?
Try the taste of martini
The most beautiful drink in the world
It's the bright one
The right one, that's martini
I wish you'd sit down if you're going to sing.
Don't you think you'd be more comfortable?
There's only one "T" in typhoo
In packets and in teabags, too
Any way you make it
You'll know that it's true
There's only one "T" in typhoo
That's a good song.
I like that better than the other two.
Sing that one again.
Double Your Pleasure
Double your fun
With Double-good, Double-good
Now, listen.
This is not a loony bin.
It's not a prison.
If you behave yourself, you'll have a reasonably all right time.
If you don't, you'll be packed off to a mental hospital, and you'll find things much more restricted.
So it's up to you.
You'll be seeing me every day.
Your session will last exactly 45 minutes.
And I expect you to be absolutely on time. All right?
By the way...
Which of your parents is it who won't allow you to watch television?
Mother?
Father?
Or is it both?
Come in, David.
Uh, take Strang, here, on a tour of the...
Hospital, before lunch.
You'll find it quite pleasant.
There's a piano room, a darkroom for photographers, even a television room.
3 nights later, I had this very specific dream.
In it, I am a chief priest in Homeric Greece.
I'm wearing a wide gold mask, all noble and bearded, like the so-called mask of
Agamemnon, found at Mycenae.
I'm standing by a thick, round stone, holding a sharp knife.
In fact, I'm officiating in some
immensely important ritual sacrifice
on which depends the fate of the crops,
or of a military expedition.
The sacrifice is a herd of children,
about 500 boys and girls stretching in a long queue,
across the plain of Argos.
I know it's Argos, because of the red soil.
On either side of me stand two assistant priests, wearing masks as well...
Lumpy, pop-eyed masks,
such as were also found at Mycenae.
They're enormously strong, these priests, and absolutely tireless.
As each child steps forward,
they grab it from behind and throw it over the stone.
Then, with a surgical skill
that amazes even me,
I fit in the knife, and slice elegantly down to the navel, just like a seamstress following a pattern.
I part the flaps, sever the inner tubes, yank them out and throw them, hot and steaming, on the floor.
The other two then study the patterns they make,
as if they're reading hieroglyphics.
It's obvious to me that
I'm tops, as chief priest.
It's this unique talent for carving that's got me where I am.
The only thing is, unknown to the others,
I'm beginning to feel distinctly nauseous.
And with each victim, it's getting worse.
My face is going green behind the mask.
Of course, I redouble my efforts to look professional, cutting and snipping for all I'm worth,
mainly because I know that if those two others so much as suspect my distress,
and the implied doubt that this repetitive and smelly work
is doing any social good at all, then I'd be next over the stone.
And then, of course, the damn mask begins to slip.
The priests both turn and look at it.
Their gold pop-eyes suddenly fill with blood.
They tear the knife from my hand, and I...
I wake up.
Mrs. Strang, have you any idea how this could have occurred?
No, Doctor.
It's all so unbelievable.
Alan was always such a gentle boy. Always.
And he loves animals, especially horses.
Thank you.
- Especially?
- Yes.
He even has a picture of one, up in his bedroom.
His father gave it to him a few years ago, off a calendar he'd had printed, and the boy's never taken it down.
And, uh, when he was, uh, seven or eight,
I used to have to read the same book to him, over and over again, all about a horse.
Really?
It was called prince, and no one could ride him.
You say he kept the picture of the horse in his bedroom?
Yes.
Could I see it?
Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
- Uh...
- Thank you.
It's, uh... Uh, please, it's this way.
Uh, I do remember telling him one very odd thing.
Did you know, Doctor, that when the Christian cavalry first appeared in the new world, the pagans thought that horse and rider was one person?
- One person?
- Yes.
Of course.
Actually, they thought it must be a God.
In here, please.
This is Alan's room.
Remarkable.
Yes.
Mrs. Strang, is there...
Anything else you can remember you told him about horses?
Anything at all?
Oh, well, they're in the Bible of course.
"He saith among the trumpets, ha-ha!"
"Ha-ha"?
The Book of Job.
Such a noble passage.
Do you know it?
"Hast thou given the horse strength?
"Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
"The glory of his nostrils is terrible.
"He saith among the trumpets, Ha-Ha!"
That's marvelous.
Yes.
Yes... Oh, there's Mr. Strang now.
Uh, Frank,
I've got the doctor here.
We'll come down.
Uh...
He's very upset.
You understand, of course?
Uh, this is Dr. Dysart, dear.
Mr. Strang. How do you do?
I was just telling
Dr. Dysart, dear, how... how Alan always adored horses.
Oh, yes?
Yeah, in fact, we've always been a very horsey family.
Uh, well, uh, my side of it has.
Uh, my uncle used to ride every morning on the downs behind Brighton, all dressed up in a bowler hat and jodhpurs. He used to look splendid.
Uh, "indulging in equitation," he called it.
Uh, I remember telling Alan how that word came from "equus."
"Equus"?
The Latin word for "horse."
Oh, yeah.
Alan was absolutely fascinated by that word, I know.
I suppose because he'd never come across one with two "u"s together before.
My dear, have you offered the doctor a cup of tea?
Oh, no, no, dear, I haven't. Oh.
You must be dying for one.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes.
My, uh.
My wife has, uh, romantic ideas, if you receive my meaning.
About her family?
Yes. She thinks she married beneath her.
I dare say, she did. I don't understand these things myself.
Would you say that she's closer to the boy than you are?
Oh, they've always been as thick as thieves.
I can't say I entirely approve...
Especially when I hear her reading that Bible to him, night after night, up there in his room.
You mean, she's, uh, religious?
Some might say excessively so.
Mind you, that is her business, but, uh...
When it comes to dosing it down the boy's throat, well, frankly, he's my son as well as hers.
Bloody religion.
Well, it's our only real problem in this house, but I... it's insuperable.
I don't mind admitting it.
You must excuse my husband, Doctor.
This one subject is something of an obsession with him.
Isn't it, dear? You must admit.
Call it what you like. All that stuff, to me, is just bad sex.
What has that got to do with Alan?
Everything. Everything, Dora.
I don't understand.
What are you saying?
Mr. Strang, exactly how informed would you judge your son to be, about sex?
I don't know.
You didn't actually instruct him yourself?
Well, not in so many words, no.
Uh, did you, Mrs. Strang?
Well, I spoke a little.
Yes, I had to.
Oh, let me help you.
Uh, what sort of things did you tell him?
I'm sorry if this is embarrassing.
Uh, I told him the biological facts.
But I also told him what I believed, that sex is not just a biological matter, but a spiritual one as well, that if God willed, he would fall in love one day.
Uh. sugar?
Yes, thank you.
Uh, that his task was to prepare himself for the most important happening of his life.
And after that, if he was lucky, he would come to know a higher love, still.
There, now. There, now, Dora.
Dora, it's all right. Come on.
Oh, God. Laugh. Laugh, as usual.
No one is laughing, Dora.
Dora.
Equus.
Eh...
Equus!
Equus!
Equus!
Equus! Equus!
Eq... Equus! Equus!
Equus!
Suddenly, I realized whose face I'd seen in my dream.
On every victim across the stone,
it was his stare accusing me.
But what of?
Well...
How are you this morning?
Sorry if I gave you a start last night, I...
I was collecting some papers from my office, and I thought I'd look in on you.
Do you dream often?
Do you dream often?
Do you?
It's my job to ask the questions, yours to answer them.
- Says who?
- Says me.
Do you dream often?
Do you?
Now, look, Alan...
I'll answer if you answer.
In turns.
Very well.
Only, we have to speak the truth.
Very well.
So.
Do you dream often?
Yes.
- Do you?
- Yes.
Do you have a special dream?
No.
Do you?
Yes. What was your dream about last night?
Can't remember. What's yours about?
I said, the truth.
That is the truth. What's yours about?
The special one.
Carving up children.
It's my turn.
What is your first memory of a horse?
I can't remember.
You have no recollection of the first time you ever noticed a horse?
I just told you. It's my turn.
All right.
Are you married?
I am.
Is she a doctor, too?
My turn.
What, uh...
What is, uh, "Eq"?
You shouted it out in your sleep last night.
I thought perhaps you might like to talk about it.
Plop, plop, fizz, fizz
Oh, what a relief it is
Plop, plop
Come on now, Alan, you can do better than that.
So, Double Your pleasure double your fun
You Can Double Everything
Rolled into one, one
All right, good morning.
What do you mean?
We're finished for today.
Only had five minutes.
Too bad.
Didn't you hear me?
I said, "Good morning."
Well, that's not fair.
- No?
- No.
The government pays you £50 an hour to see me.
I know, I heard, downstairs.
So, go back downstairs and hear some more.
That's not fair.
You're a swizz.
Bloody swizz! Swizz!
Do I have to call a nurse?
She puts a finger on me, and I'll bash her.
She'll bash you a damn sight harder, I can assure you of that.
Now, go.
On a beach.
What?
Where I first saw a horse.
Sod.
How old were you?
How should I know? Six.
- What were you doing there?
- Nothing.
Digging.
Sandcastles?
Well, what else?
Go on.
That's a terrific castle.
It must've taken a long time to build.
You can stroke him if you like.
He won't mind.
His name's Trojan.
Easy there, Troj.
Easy, boy.
Easy there, Trojan.
Oh, you can hardly reach from down there. You want to come up?
Come on, then.
No, come round this side.
You always mount a horse from the left.
I'll give you a lift up, okay?
Now, do nothing at all.
Easy. boy! Easy!
Don't be frightened, now.
Hold on tight to his mane and grip with your knees.
That's it. Come on, now. Let's go.
Do you want to go faster?
All you have to do is say, "Come on, Trojan, bear me away."
Say it, then!
Bear me away.
I can't hear you. Say it!
Bear me away!
Come on, Trojan!
Alan!
Alan! Alan!
- Alan!
- Alan!
Alan!
Alan!
What... Come back here!
Alan!
Alan! Alan. Hey, you!
Easy, boy, easy.
What do you imagine you're doing?
- Imagine?
- What is my son doing up there?
It's all right, Frank.
He's not hurt, is he?
Don't you think to ask permission before doing a thing stupid like that?
It's lovely, Dad.
The boy is perfectly safe.
Please don't be hysterical!
Don't you be la-de-da with me, young man.
Come down, here, Alan, you heard what your mother said.
No.
- Come down here at once.
- No.
- Right this moment! I said, this moment!
- No.
Frank.
Ugh!
Watch it! Are you mad?
Alan!
Do you want to terrify the horse?
You're a public menace, you know that?
Easy, Trojan.
How dare you pick up children and put them on dangerous animals!
- Dangerous?
- Frank, the boy's hurt.
Look at his eyes, they're rolling.
So are yours.
Frank, he's cut himself.
The boy's hurt.
I'm not, I'm not! I'm not!
I'm not, I'm not! I'm not!
I'm not, I'm not! I'm not!
That's all I remember.
And a lot, too.
Thank you.
Do you know...
Do you know, I've... I've never been on a horse in my life?
Nor me.
You mean, since that?
Yeah.
Never?
No.
How come?
I didn't care to.
You mean to say, you never rode, even when you were at the stables?
No.
Wasn't that part of the job?
No, didn't have to.
Why not? Surely it would've been fun, after being cooped up in that shop all week.
Just didn't care to, that's all.
Anyway, it's my turn. I told you a secret, you tell me one.
All right.
There are patients who have things to tell me, but they're ashamed to...
Say them to my face. What do you think I do about that?
What?
I give them this little tape recorder.
They go off to another room, and they send the tape back through nurse.
They don't have to listen to it with me.
Stupid.
Quite simple, really. You press this button and speak into this.
Anyway, our time's up for today.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Maybe.
Maybe?
If I feel like it.
Stupid.
I thought I'd go in tomorrow, and see the boy.
Would you come?
Frank, it's not right, your not...
But you should.
You've got to tell him.
The doctor, I mean.
He should know about that.
You think it's important?
Yes, I do.
Why?
Well, it just could be.
It was sexy. That's what you want to know, isn't it?
Hello?
Hello, Doctor.
I hope it's not too late.
Uh, no, Mrs. Strang.
Uh, no, it's just that, uh,
Mr. Strang and I were talking, and we felt there was something you might want to know.
Could I come and see you tomorrow?
Why don't I come to see you?
I'm talking about the beach, that time that I told you about.
I was pushed forward on the horse.
There was sweat on my legs from his neck.
His sides were all warm...
The smell...
And turning him...
All that power, going anywhere you wanted.
And then, Dad...
It's about the picture...
Of the horse.
Uh, the one on his bedroom wall?
I'm afraid I... I didn't quite tell you all about it... last time.
I didn't think it was that important.
You see...
It actually took the place of another kind of picture altogether.
What kind?
It was a reproduction of our
Lord on his way to Calvary.
Uh, Alan insisted on buying it with his own pocket money,
and hanging it where he could see it, last thing at night.
My husband was very displeased.
And, to be fair, it is a little extreme.
Then, one day,
Mr. Strang and I had one of our tiffs about religion,
and he went straight up the stairs,
and tore it off the boy's wall.
Alan went quite hysterical.
He cried for days, without stopping.
But he recovered when he was given the picture of the horse?
Oh, yes.
Uh, he hung it in exactly the same place.
And we had no more of that awful weeping.
Mr. Dalton?
My name is Dysart. I'm a doctor.
I'm dealing with Alan Strang.
I mean, I'm treating Alan Strang.
I know this is an intrusion, but I,
I'd like to have a talk with you.
I realize this must be difficult for you.
Difficult?
For lack of a word.
If I had my way, that boy would be dead.
I should have killed him that night.
Of course, now you've got him in hospital.
Private room, three meals a day, remedial therapy, ping-pong, basketwork.
Hmph.
- Mr. Dalton...
- No, no, no. Quite right.
We've got to be, uh, modern about it.
After all, there are no criminals now.
We're all capable of everything.
I know. I've heard all about it.
Forgive and forget...
Two months ping-pong...
He's paid his debt to society, eh?
Mr. Dalton?
Damn you!
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
I keep seeing it.
Over and over, I see it.
Jill's had a breakdown.
- Jill?
- The girl who worked for me.
Complete and utter breakdown.
She'll never get over it.
Of course, she blames herself, being the one who brought him here to begin with.
He was introduced to the stables by a girl?
I just told you, didn't I?
Jill, Jill Mason.
Excuse me for being stupid, but was that his girlfriend?
How should I know?
No, he met up with her somewhere, asked for a job.
She told him to come and see me.
Piss off now, will you?
Yes, I'll be going.
One thing, when he first appeared, did he seem at all peculiar?
I mean, odd in any way?
No.
He did bloody good.
He spent hours with the horses, cleaning and grooming, way over the call of duty.
I thought he was a real find.
Apparently, the whole time he worked for you, he never actually rode.
That's true.
Wasn't that peculiar?
Certainly, if he didn't.
What do you mean?
I mean that, on and off, that whole year, I had the feeling the horses were being taken out at night.
At night?
Oh, just odd things I noticed.
I mean...
Too often, one or other of them would be sweaty first thing in the morning, when it wasn't sick.
Very sweaty, too.
And its stall wouldn't be nearly as mucky as it should be, if it had been in all night.
Stupidly enough, I never paid much mind to it at the time.
It wasn't until I realized
I'd been hiring a loony that I came to wonder if he hadn't been riding all the time, behind our backs.
All right, it's obviously just my fancy.
This thing has shaken me so badly,
I'm liable to believe anything.
Why should anybody do that?
Why should any boy prefer to go riding by himself at night, when he could go off with others during the day?
Are you asking me?
He's a loony, isn't he?
This girl, Jill Mason, could you tell me where she lives?
Her mother keeps a shop, a mile down the road.
Sells the antiques.
Thank you.
You won't see her.
And something else.
When the horse first appeared,
I looked up into his mouth.
There was this chain in it.
I said, "Does it hurt?" And he...
The horse said...
It was always the same, after that.
Every time I heard one clop by, I had to run and see.
Up a country lane...
Anywhere...
Just to watch their skins...
And the way their necks twist.
The sweat comes in the folds.
Words like "reins,"
"stirrups," "flanks..."
"Dashing his spurs against his charger's flanks..."
Even those words made me...
The way they give themselves to us.
That was it, too.
They could stamp us into bits anytime they wanted, and they don't.
They just let themselves be turned on a string all day, absolutely humble.
They give us all their strength, and we just give them stripes for it.
They'll run forever.
They'll gallop till they die, they will... if we don't say "stop."
They live for us...
Just for us...
Their whole lives.
Years, I've never told anyone.
My mum wouldn't understand.
She likes equitation,
bowler hats, jodhpurs.
My uncle dressed for the horses, she says.
But what does that mean?
Horse isn't dressed.
It's naked.
It's the most naked thing you ever saw, more than a dog, a cat, or anything.
Even the brokenest-down old nag has got its life.
Put a bowler hat on top of it... filthy.
Putting them through their paces, bloody horse shows.
How do they dare?
No one understands. No one.
Except cowboys. They do.
But they're free. They just swing up, and it's nothing but miles of grass.
I bet all cowboys are orphans.
I bet they are.
No one ever says to cowboys,
"Receive my meaning" or God.
"All the time, God sees you, Alan.
God's got eyes everywhere."
No, I'm not doing anymore, I hate this.
You can whistle for anymore. I've had it.
I'm very busy, you know.
That's why I came to see you.
Mr. Strang, is there something you're not telling me?
What do you mean?
The last time we met, you said that religion was at the bottom of all this.
So it is.
Well, just because his mother reads him the Bible?
Night after night.
Fifty years ago.
That would've been considered proper conduct for a mother.
Mr. Strang, I know
I'm being impertinent.
I'm prying, and I'm nosy.
But if you want to help Alan, you've got to help me.
Anything will do, Mr. Strang.
Any bloody thing!
Your wife told me about the picture.
No, it's not that, it's...
It's about that.
But it's worse.
I wanted to tell you the other day, but I couldn't in front of Dora.
Maybe I should have.
It might show her all that stuff leads to, she drills into the boy, behind my back.
What kind of thing is it?
It's something I witnessed.
Where?
At home, 18 months ago.
Go on.
It was, uh, it was late.
The boy had been in bed hours, or so I thought.
Go on.
As I came out of the bathroom,
I heard...
I heard the noise of this chanting.
Chanting?
Yes, you know.
By the Bible, you know, one of those lists his mother was always reading to him.
Those "begat, so and so, begat..." you know, genealogy. But, uh...
What did Alan's list sound like?
Well, I remember the sort of thing I...
The first word I heard was...
Prince.
- Prince?
- Yeah.
Prince begat Prance.
And Prance begat Prankus.
And Prankus begat Flankus.
And Flankus begat Spankus.
And Spankus begat Spunkus the great, who lived threescore years.
And Legwus begat Neckwus.
And Neckwus begat Fleckwus, the king of spit.
And Fleckwus spoke out of his chinkle-chankle.
What?
I'm sure that was the word.
I've never forgotten it.
"Chinkle-chankle."
And he said "Behold, I give you
Equus, my only begotten son."
Equus?
There's no doubt of that, he repeated that word several times.
"Equus...
"My only begotten son."
And then...
He took this...
String.
And he put it in his mouth, and...
With his other hand...
He picked up this...
Coat hanger, this wooden coat hanger...
Equus.
And he...
Equus.
Equus.
Well, you see why I...
I couldn't tell his mother.
Religion. Religion is the bottom of this, don't you see?
Did you speak to him about it later?
No.
I can't speak about things like that, Doctor.
It's not in my nature.
No.
I see that.
Here, let me help you.
Just run it under the tap.
I must tell you that it's been an enormous help...
Mr. Strang, is there...
Something else?
There is, actually. There's one...
There's one thing.
That night that he...
That he did it, that, uh, that awful thing in the... in the stables...
That night, he was out with a girl.
How do you know that?
Well, I just know, that's all.
Was that girl Jill Mason?
I don't know her name.
Excuse me, Mr. Strang, what do you know?
- I can't say anymore.
- Mr. Strang...
Ask him! Just ask him about taking a girl out that very night. It's...
Thanks for the tape.
It was excellent.
Yeah, I'm not making anymore.
One thing I didn't quite understand, you began to say something about the horse on the beach talking to you.
Tsk. Stupid, horses don't talk.
So I believe.
I don't know what you mean.
Never mind about that.
Tell me something else.
Who introduced you to the stable to begin with?
Someone I met.
Where?
Hello, can I do something for you?
No.
You're always staring in here, aren't you?
Me?
Yes. Every day, at lunchtime.
I've seen you.
Not me.
Course it's you. You looking for a job, or something?
Is there one? I can only do weekends.
That's when most people ride.
We could use extra hands.
It will mainly be mucking out.
Oh, I don't mind.
Please.
Come up on Saturday.
I'll introduce you to Mr. Dalton.
And you went?
Yeah.
Hello!
You came, then.
Let's find Mr. Dalton. My name's
Jill, by the way. What's yours?
All riders are accompanied, madam.
No riders are allowed out on their own.
All right, I'll put her down for 3:00.
What is the name, please?
Mrs. Shawcross.
Thank you. Goodbye.
This is Alan Strang, Mr. Dalton.
Oh?
You ever worked in a stable before?
- Can you ride?
- No, I don't want to.
It's not extra, you know.
It comes with the job.
No, I just want to work here.
You like horses?
Well, we can certainly use the help.
There's enough work around here for six lads.
Four quid a day. Saturdays and Sundays. All right?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Now, I expect the place neat, dry and clean at all times.
The main rule is, never pretend you know something when you don't.
Actually, the main rule is, enjoy yourself.
Remember, 7:30 on the dot.
Horses don't oversleep, you know. See you later.
This is Nugget. Come on, that's it. Yeah.
Come on, come on.
He's my favorite.
This is a body brush.
You use it with a currycomb.
Now, you always groom the same way, from the ears, downwards.
Don't be afraid to do it hard.
The harder you do it, the more the horse loves it.
Push it right through the coat, like this.
Work towards the tail, and right through the coat.
See how he loves it?
Giving you a lovely massage, aren't I, boy?
Here, you try.
Nice and easy.
Never rush.
Work towards the tail, and right through the coat.
That's it.
Again.
You've got a feel for it, I can tell.
It's going to be fun teaching you.
Jill! Jill!
What?
Mr. Dalton wants you, please. Right away.
Keep that up for 15 minutes.
Then do old trooper.
See you later.
All right, I'm off now.
I'll be back after lunch.
If anyone rings, just put it in the book.
Two rides this afternoon.
That's the lot.
Was it good? Touching them?
Must've been marvelous, being near them at last,
making them fresh and glossy.
Tell me,
you worked at the stable every weekend?
Yeah.
You must have seen a lot of the girl.
Tell me about her.
Did you like her?
- Come on, Alan, tell me.
- All right.
Was she friendly?
Yes.
Or standoffish?
Yes.
Well, which?
What?
Which was she?
Tell me, did you, uh... Did you ever take her out?
- Did you have dates with her?
- What?
Tell me if you did.
"Tell me!"
"Tell me, tell me, tell me" on and on.
Standing there, nosy parker.
That's all you are, a bloody nosy parker, just like my dad.
"Answer this, answer that," never stop.
- Well, I'm sorry.
- All right.
Well, now it's my turn.
You tell me, answer me.
We're not playing that game now.
We're playing what I say.
All right.
What do you want to know?
Do you have dates?
I told you, I'm married.
I know. Her name's Margaret, she's a dentist.
You see? I found out.
What made you go with her, then?
Did you used to bite her hands when she did you in the chair?
That's not very funny.
Do you have girls behind her back?
No.
Then what? Do you fuck her?
All right.
Come on, tell me, tell me, tell me.
- That's enough now.
- I'll bet you don't.
I bet you never touch her.
You've got no kids, have you?
Is that because you don't fuck?
Go to your room.
Quick march.
Alan.
Give me those cigarettes.
Give them to me!
Now go.
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.
The boy's on the run, so he turns defensive. What am I, then?
Wicked little bastard. He knew exactly what questions to try.
Not that there's anything novel about that.
Advanced neurotics can be dazzling at that game.
They aim unswervingly at your area of maximum vulnerability, which is, I suppose, as good a way as any of describing Margaret.
Now, stop it.
Do I embarrass you?
I suspect you're about to.
My wife doesn't understand me, your honor.
Do you understand her?
No.
Obviously, I never did.
I'm sorry.
I never like to ask.
But I always imagined you weren't exactly compatible.
We were. It actually worked for a bit.
I mean, for both of us.
She, for me, through a kind of...
Briskness, a clear, redheaded, inaccessible briskness, that kept me keyed up for months.
Mind you, if you're kinky for northern hygiene, which I am, you can hardly find anything more compelling than a Scottish lady dentist.
It's you who are wicked, you know.
Not at all.
She got exactly the same from me.
Antiseptic proficiency.
I was like that in those days.
I see us in our wedding photograph, Dr. And Dr. Macbrisk.
We were brisk in our wooing, brisk in our wedding, brisk in our disappointment.
We turned from each other briskly into our separate surgeries, and now, there's a nice, brisk nothing.
You never had children, did you?
No.
We did not go in for them.
Instead she sits and knits things for orphans in some home she works with, and I sit opposite turning over the pages of books on mythical Greece.
Mentally, we're in different parts of the world.
She's forever in some drizzly chapel of her own inheriting, and I'm in some doric temple, clouds tearing through the pillars, eagles bearing prophesies out of the sky.
She finds all that repulsive.
All that my wife has ever taken from the Mediterranean, from that whole, vast, intuitive culture, are four bottles of Chianti to make into lamps, and two China condiment donkeys labeled Sally and Pepe.
Now you're being cruel.
I wish...
There was somebody in this life I could show.
One...
Instinctive, absolutely unbrisk person that I could take to Greece, and stand in front of certain shrines and sacred streams and say,
"Look, life is only comprehensible through 1,000
"local Gods.
"Not just the old, dead Gods, with names like Zeus,
"but living geniuses of place and person.
"Not just Greece, but modern England.
"Here, spirits of certain trees,
"of certain curves of brick wall,
"of certain fish-and-chip shops, if you like,
"and... and slate roofs, and
"frowns in people, slouches."
I'd say to them,
"Worship...
"All you can see...
"And more will appear."
This boy.
With his stare, he's trying to save himself through me.
I'd say so.
What am I trying to do to him?
- Restore him.
- To what?
A normal life.
Normal?
It still means something, you know.
You mean, a normal boy has one head.
A normal head has two ears.
- You know I don't...
- Then what do you mean?
Oh, stop it.
I want to know.
Look, my dear, you know what I mean by a normal smile in a child's eyes, and one that isn't, don't you?
Yes.
Then we have a duty to that, surely, both of us.
Touche.
I'll talk to you.
Martin.
You're going through a rotten patch at the moment, I'm sorry.
I suppose one of the few things one can do is simply hold on to priorities.
Such as?
Children before adults.
Things like that.
You're really quite splendid, you know that?
Famous for it.
All right.
The normal is the good smile in a child's eyes.
It's also the dead stare in a million adults.
Both sustains and kills, like a God.
It is the ordinary made beautiful.
It is also the average, made lethal.
The normal is the indispensable, murderous God of health.
And I am his priest.
I'm sorry about our row yesterday.
Yeah, it was stupid.
Yes.
Yes, it was.
Would you like to play a game?
What kind?
It's one I invented myself.
It's called blink.
You fix your eyes on something, say, that little stain on the wall over there, and I tap my pencil on the desk.
First tap, you close your eyes.
The second, you open.
Close, open, close, open, till I say "stop."
What's the point of that?
Well, relax you.
Make it easier for you to talk.
Stupid.
Well, you don't have to if you don't want to.
I didn't say I didn't want to.
Well?
I don't mind.
All right.
Start watching that stain.
Now, put your hands by your side, your fingers open wide.
The thing to do is to... Feel comfortable and relax, absolutely.
You watching that stain?
Yeah.
Right.
Now try and make your mind as blank as possible.
That's not difficult.
No more talking.
First tap... close.
Second, open. Ready?
My tools are very delicate.
My compassion is honest.
I've honestly assisted children in this room.
I've talked away terrors, relieved many agonies.
But beyond question,
I have cut from them portions of individuality, repugnant to this God, normal, in all its aspects.
And at what length.
Sacrifices to Zeus took, at the most, 60 seconds each.
Sacrifices to the normal...
Can take as much as
60 months.
Can you hear me?
Can you speak normally?
Say "yes" if you can.
Yes.
Good.
Now raise your head.
Open your eyes.
Now, Alan, when you wake up, you're going to remember everything you've told me.
Understand?
Yes.
Now, I want you to think back in time.
You're on that beach you told me about.
You're six.
Above you, staring down at you, is that great horse's head.
Can you see that?
Yes.
You ask him a question.
"Does the chain hurt?"
Yes.
Do you ask him aloud?
No.
And what does the horse say back?
"Yes."
What do you say?
"I'll take it out for you."
And he says?
"It never comes out.
They have me in chains."
Like Jesus?
Yes.
Only, his name is not Jesus, is it?
No.
What is it?
It's Equus.
Equus.
Does he live in all horses, or just some?
All.
Good.
Now you leave the beach.
You're in your bedroom at home.
You're 12 years old.
You're looking at Equus from the foot of the bed.
Would you like to kneel down?
Yes.
Go on.
Now tell me, why is
Equus in chains?
For the sins of the world.
What does he say to you?
"I see you.
- "I will save you."
- How?
"Bear you away, two shall be one."
Horse and rider should be one beast?
- "One person."
- And?
"And my chinkle-chankle shall be in thy hand."
"Chinkle-chankle," that's his mouth chain?
Yes.
All right.
You can get up now.
Now tell me, what is the stable?
His temple? His holy of holies?
Yes.
Will you wash him, and tend him, and brush him with many brushes?
Yes.
And there he spoke to you, didn't he?
He looked at you with his gentle eyes and he spoke unto you.
Yes.
What did he say? "Ride me?
"Mount me, and ride me forth at night"?
Yes.
- And you obeyed?
- Yes.
How did you learn?
By watching others?
Yes.
Must've been difficult.
You bounced about?
Yes.
But he taught you, didn't he?
Equus showed you the way.
No.
- He didn't?
- He showed me nothing.
He's a mean bugger.
Ride or fall, that's straw law.
Straw law?
He was born in the straw and this is his law
But... But you managed?
You mastered him?
Had to.
And so you rode forth in secret?
- Yes.
- How often?
Every three weeks.
More, people would notice.
On a particular horse?
No.
Let's do it.
Let's go riding.
Now.
You're there now, in front of the stable door.
Go on, open it.
Now go in.
Shh! Quietly now.
Dalton may still be awake.
Quietly as possible.
That's a good boy.
Are you in yet?
Yes.
Can you see all the horses?
Yes.
Which one are you going to take?
Nugget.
What do you do, first thing?
Put on his sandals.
The sandals of majesty.
Made of sack.
And then?
Chinkle-chankle.
He doesn't like it so late.
But he takes it for my sake.
He bends for me, stretches forth his neck unto it.
And then?
Buckle,
and lead out.
No saddle?
Never.
Where are you now?
The path.
He's quiet.
Always is, this bit.
Meek and mild legs.
Gentle Equus, meek and mild.
At least, till the field.
- What field?
- Ha-ha.
What?
The field of ha-ha then there's trouble.
- What kind?
- He won't go in.
Make him go into it.
Come on.
Come on.
Is it a good field?
It's perfect.
Full of rubbish,
electrical and kitchenware.
It's covered with nettles.
Burn your feet.
Take your shoes off?
Everything.
All your clothes?
Yes.
What do you do now?
Hide the clothes.
Get the man-bit.
Man-bit?
Stick for my mouth.
- Your mouth?
- To bite on.
Why? What for?
So as it won't happen too quick.
Is it always the same stick?
Of course.
Sacred stick.
Keep it in the hole.
The ark of the man-bit.
And now?
What do you do now?
Touch him.
Where?
All over,
belly,
ribs.
His ribs are of ivory,
of great value.
His flank is cool.
His nostrils open for me.
His eyes shine! They can see!
His eyes!
Go on.
What then?
Sugar.
- Lump sugar?
- His last supper.
- Last before what?
- Ha-ha.
You say anything when you give it to him?
Take my sins.
Eat them, for my sake.
Now he's ready?
You can get up on him now?
Yes.
Go on then, Alan.
Mount him.
Into my hands, he commends himself...
Naked in his chinkle-chankle.
Equus.
Equus.
Equus.
Take me.
Whoa.
Whoa, down.
Whoa, down, easy, boy, easy, boy.
Easy, boy.
Equus, the godslave.
Faithful and true, that's it.
He's good. He's good.
He's good.
Equus, son of Fleckwus.
Son of Neckwus.
Walk.
Here we go.
Here we go.
The king rides out on Equus, mightiest of horses.
Only I can ride him.
His neck comes out of my body.
It lifts in the dark.
Equus, godslave.
Now the king commands you.
Tonight, we ride against them all, the hosts of bowler, the hosts of Jodhpur, all those who show you off for their vanity, tie rosettes on your head for their vanity.
Come on, Equus, let's get them.
Trot! Steady, steady!
Steady, steady!
That's it, steady, steady.
Cowboys are watching, taking off their Stetsons.
They know who we are.
They're admiring us.
Bowing low unto us.
Come on now, show them.
Canter! Canter!
And Equus the mighty rose against all.
His enemies scatter.
His enemies fall.
Turn! Trample them! Trample them!
Trample them! Turn.
Trample them! Trample them!
Trample them! Turn.
Turn! Turn! Turn!
Turn! Turn! Turn!
Stiff! Stiff in the wind.
My mane, stiff in the wind!
I'm raw, I'm raw. Do you feel my raw? Feel me on you?
On you! On you!
I want to be inside you.
I want to be inside you, and be you.
Forever one person.
I love you!
Bear me away.
Make us now one person.
Ahh! One person!
Ahh! One person!
Amen.
Afterwards, he says, they always embrace.
He showed me how he stands in the night,
like a frozen tango dancer,
inhaling the cold...
Sweet breath.
Have you noticed it about horses, the way they'll stand,
one hoof on its end, like those girls in the ballet?
And now,
he's gone off to rest, leaving me alone, with Equus.
I can hear the creature's voice.
He's calling me out of the black cave of the psyche.
I shove in my dim little torch,
and there he stands, waiting for me.
He raises his matted head.
He opens his great square teeth, and he says,
"Why? Why me?
"Why, ultimately, me?
"Do you really imagine you can account for me,
"totally, infallibly, inevitably account for me?
"Poor Dr. Dysart."
Of course, I've stared at such images before, or been stared at by them, whichever way you look at it.
And weirdly, often now with me, the feeling is that they are staring at us.
That in some quite palpable way, they precede us.
Meaningless, but unsettling.
In either case, this particular one.
This huge, implacable head is the most alarming yet.
It asks questions I've avoided all my professional life.
A child is born into a world of phenomena, all equal in their power to enslave.
It sniffs, it sucks, it strokes its eyes, over the whole, uncountable range.
Suddenly, one strikes.
Then another. Then another.
Why?
Moments snap together, like magnets forging a chain of shackles.
Why?
I can trace them. I can even, with time, pull them apart again.
But why, at the start, they were ever magnetized at all,
why those particular moments of experience and no others,
I do not know, and nor does anybody else!
And if I don't know, if I can never know, what am I doing here?
I don't mean clinically doing, or socially doing, but fundamentally.
These whys, these questions, are fundamental.
Yet they have no place in a consulting room.
So, then, do I?
Do any of us?
This is the feeling, more and more.
Displacement.
Relentless...
Displacement.
"Account for me," says staring Equus.
"First, account for me!"
Dr. Dysart!
Dr. Dysart!
There's a terrible scene with the
Strang boy in the violence room.
His mother brought him chocolates.
He threw them at her, hard!
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare.
Don't you look at me like that.
I'm not a doctor, you know, who'll take anything.
Don't you give me that stare, young man.
Mrs. Strang.
I know your stares, they don't work on me...
Leave here at once!
- What did you say?
- I tell you to leave here at once.
Goodbye, Alan.
Wait for me here.
I must ask you never to come here again.
You think I want to?
Do you think I want to?
Mrs. Strang, what on earth has got into you?
Into me?
- Can't you see the boy's highly distressed?
- Oh, really?
Yes, he's at the most delicate stage of treatment.
He's totally ex... ex... exposed, ashamed, everything you can imagine.
And me?
What about me?
What do you think I am?
I'm a parent. Of course, that doesn't count.
That's a dirty word in here, isn't it? "Parent"?
Now, you know that's not true.
Oh, I know it, I know it, all right.
I've heard it all my life.
I... it's our fault.
Whatever happens, we did it.
You come to us and say,
"Who forbids television?
"Who does what behind whose back?"
As if we're criminals.
Well, let me tell you something.
We're not criminals.
We've done nothing wrong.
We loved Alan. We gave him the best love we could.
Poor Frank digs into the boy too much, but... but nothing in excess.
He's not a bully.
No, Doctor.
Whatever has happened, has happened because of Alan.
If you added up everything we ever did to him, from his first day on Earth to this, you wouldn't find out why he did this, t... terrible thing.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I want you to understand, because I lie awake, and awake, thinking it out.
And I want you to know that I deny it absolutely, what he's doing now.
Staring at me, attacking me for what he's done.
For what... he... is.
- Mrs. Strang!
- Oh!
You have your words, and I have mine.
But if you knew God, Doctor, you would know about the devil.
The devil isn't made by what
Mummy says, or what Daddy says.
The devil is there.
It's an old-fashioned word, but a true thing.
I'll go.
What I did just now was inexcusable.
I only know that...
He was my little Alan, and then the devil came.
I thought you liked your mother.
She doesn't know anything, you know.
I haven't told her what you told me.
You know that, don't you?
It was lies, anyway.
What was?
You and your pencil.
Just a con-trick, that's all.
Made me say a lot of lies.
Like what?
All of it. Everything I said.
A lot of lies.
I see.
Ought to be locked up.
Bloody tricks.
Thought you liked tricks.
It'll be the drug next, huh?
What drug?
I've heard. I'm not ignorant.
I know what you get up to in here, shove needles in people and pump them full of truth drugs, so they...
Can't help saying things.
That's next, isn't it?
Alan, do you know why you're here?
So you can give me truth drugs.
- He actually believes they exist.
- Truth drugs?
Yes.
And don't they?
Of course not.
The important thing is that he...
Wants a way to speak, to finally tell me what happened in those stables.
Tape is too isolated, and hypnosis, he pretends, is a trick, so he can deny it later.
Now I'm tempted to play a real trick on him.
Like what?
Give him an aspirin.
Tell him it's the strongest truth drug in the world.
He'd just deny everything again afterwards.
The same thing all over.
No, because I'd tell him the truth afterwards, that it was simply an aspirin.
And he'll believe me.
You know, underneath all that glowering, the boy trusts me.
You realize that?
Oh, I'm sure he does.
Poor, bloody fool.
Oh, now, please, Martin, dear, don't start that again.
Can you think of anything worse one can do to somebody than to take away their worship?
Worship?
Yes, that word again.
Isn't that a little extreme?
Extremity...
Is the point.
Worship isn't destructive,
Martin. I know that.
I don't.
I only know it's the core of his life.
What else has he got? I mean, think about it. He can hardly read.
He knows no physics or engineering to make the world real to him, no paintings to show him how others have enjoyed it, no music except television jingles, no history except tales from a desperate mother.
No friends, not one kid to give him a joke, or make him know himself more moderately.
He's a modern citizen for whom society doesn't exist.
He lives one hour every three weeks, howling in a mist.
"With my body, I thee worship."
Many men are less vital with their wives.
All the same, they don't usually blind their wives, do they?
- Oh, come on.
- Well, do they?
You mean he's a madman?
A violent, dangerous madman, who'll go round the country, doing it again and again?
I mean he's in pain, Martin.
He's been in pain for most of his life.
Yes.
And you can take it away.
Yes.
Then that's all you need to know, in the end.
No.
Why not?
Because it is his.
His?
His pain.
His own.
He made it.
I don't understand.
Well, I don't!
I mean, there's nothing meritorious about being in pain, that's just pure old masochism.
I'm talking about passion, Hesther.
Do you know what that word meant originally? Suffering.
The way you get your own spirit through your own suffering.
Self-chosen. Self-made.
This boy's done that.
He's created his own desperate ceremony just, just to...
Just to ignite one flame of original ecstasy in... in the spiritless waste around him.
All right.
He's destroyed for it, horribly.
He's virtually been destroyed by it.
But one thing I know for sure, that boy has known a passion more ferocious than I have known in any second of my life.
Well, let me tell you something.
I envy it.
- You can't.
- Don't you see?
That's what his stare has been saying to me all this time.
"At least I galloped.
When did you?"
I'm jealous, Hesther.
Jealous...
Of Alan Strang.
That's absurd.
Is it?
Yes, utterly.
Utterly!
I go on about my wife.
Have you thought about the husband?
The finicky, critical husband, with his art books on mythical Greece?
What worship has he ever known?
Real worship?
Without worship, you... you shrink!
It's as brutal as that. I shrank my own life. No one can do it for you.
I settled for being pallid and provincial out of my own eternal timidity.
The old... the old story of bluster, and do bugger-all.
I didn't even dare to have children...
Didn't dare to bring children into a house and marriage as cold as mine.
I tell everyone Margaret's the Puritan, I'm the pagan.
Some pagan. Such wild returns
I make to the womb of civilization.
Three weeks a year in the Mediterranean.
Every bed booked in advance, every meal paid for with vouchers, cautious jaunts in hired cars, suitcase crammed with kaopectate.
What a fantastic surrender to the primitive.
And the "primitive."
I use that word endlessly.
"Ah, the primitive world," I say,
"What instinctual truths were lost with it."
And while I sit there baiting that poor, unimaginative woman with the word, that freaky boy is trying to conjure the reality.
I look at pages of centaurs trampling the soil of Argos.
And outside my window, that boy is trying to become one in a Hampshire field.
I sit there, night after night watching that woman knitting, a woman I haven't kissed in six years.
And he stands for an hour in the dark, sucking the sweat off his god's hairy cheek.
Then in the morning, I put away my books on the cultural shelf, close up my Kodachrome snaps of Mount Olympus, touch my reproduction statue of Dionysus for luck, and then go off to the hospital to treat him...
For insanity.
Now do you see?
The boy's in pain, Martin.
That's all I see.
I understand, you know.
I'm not just being Mrs. Macbrisk.
You haven't made that kind of pain.
So few of us have.
But you've still made other things.
Your own thoughts. Your own skill.
Skill absolutely, what you said, unique to you.
I've watched you do it, year after year, and it's marvelous!
I mean, you can't just sit there now, and say it's all provincial, you're just a butcher.
All that stuff is stupid, hateful.
All right, you never galloped.
Too bad.
Let me tell you, if I have to choose between his galloping and your sheer training,
I'll take the training every time.
And what's more, so will the boy, at this moment.
That stare of his isn't accusing you, my dear, it's simply demanding.
- What?
- Just that.
Your power to pull him out of the nightmare he's galloped himself into.
Do you see?
Do you see?
It is all true, what I said after you tapped the pencil.
Postscriptum, I know why I'm in here.
I got your note. Thank you.
Also for the postscriptum.
Well, that's the right word.
Me mum told me.
It's Latin. It means
"after writing."
Sorry I didn't see you today.
You're fed up with me?
Yes.
Can I make it up to you now?
What do you mean?
I thought we'd have a session.
Now?
Yes, at dead of night.
Better than going to sleep, isn't it?
Listen, Alan.
Everything I say has a trick or a catch.
Everything I do has a trick or a catch.
It's the only thing I know to do. But they...
They work. And you know that, don't you?
Now trust me.
You got another trick, then?
Yes.
- Truth drug?
- If you like.
What's it do?
Make it easier for you to talk.
What, like you can't help yourself?
Yes, like you have to speak the truth at all costs, and all of it.
Where is it?
Here.
Let's see.
Is that really it?
Yes.
You want to try it?
No.
I think you do.
I don't, not at all.
Afterwards, you'd sleep.
You'd have no more bad dreams all night.
Probably for many nights from then on.
How long does it take to work?
- It's instant, like coffee.
- It isn't.
Promise.
Well?
Can I have a cigarette?
Pill first.
What'll I feel first?
Nothing much.
After a minute, about 100 green snakes will come out of that cabinet, singing the hallelujah chorus.
No, I'm serious.
You'll feel nothing.
Nothing is going to happen, but what you want to happen.
You're not going to say anything to me, but what you want to say.
Sit back. Relax.
Finish your cigarette.
Bet this room's heard some funny things.
It certainly has.
I like it.
- This room?
- Don't you?
Well, there's...
Nothing much to like, is there?
Actually, I'd like to leave this room, and never...
Never set foot in it again in my life.
Why?
Been in it too long.
Where would you go?
Somewhere.
Secret?
Yes.
There's a sea...
A great sea that I love.
It's where the Gods used to bathe.
What Gods?
The old ones, before they died.
Gods don't die.
Oh, yes, they do.
Come with me.
It's a village I spent a night in once, where I'd like to live.
All white.
How would you nosy parker, though?
You wouldn't have a room for it anymore.
Well, I wouldn't mind.
I don't actually enjoy being a nosy parker, you know.
Then why do it?
Because you're unhappy.
So are you.
Here, I didn't mean that.
It's all right.
No... is that how it works?
Things just slip out without you feeling anything?
Yes.
So quick.
I told you.
You can say anything under it?
Yes.
Well, ask me a question.
All right.
Tell me about Jill.
Nothing to tell.
Nothing?
Well, for example, is she, uh, pretty?
You've never described her to me.
She's all right.
What color is her hair?
- Don't know.
- Is it long or short?
Don't know.
Now, come on, Alan, surely, you must know that.
I don't remember. I don't!
Alan, you're going to do this, and do it now.
You're going to tell me everything that happened with this girl.
And now, not just tell me, show me.
Act it out, if you like, even more than when I tapped the pencil.
I want you to feel free to do anything you like in this room.
The pill will help you,
I will help you.
Now describe her to me.
Is her hair long or short?
Down to here.
- You sure?
- Yes.
Well?
She was posh.
You mean snobbish?
Yeah, no. I don't know!
- She was always looking.
- At you?
Saying stupid things.
Always asking questions.
Like what?
Do you find them sexy?
What?
Horses.
Don't be daft.
Girls do.
I mean, they go through a period where they pat them and kiss them a lot.
I know I did.
- I suppose it's just a substitute, really.
- That kind of thing, all the time.
Till one night...
Yes, what?
It was her idea. She got me into it, the whole thing.
What are you saying?
One night? Go on from there.
It was a Saturday night.
We were just closing up.
How would you like to take me out?
What?
How would you like to take me out tonight?
No, I've got to go home.
What for?
They expect me.
Ring up and say you're going out.
I can't.
Why not?
They expect me.
Look, either we go out together and have some fun, or you go back to your boring home, as usual, and I go back to mine.
That's the situation, isn't it?
Where would we go?
There's a skin flick over in Winchester.
I've never seen one. Have you?
Wouldn't you like to?
All those heavy Swedes panting at one another.
Well?
What do you say?
Yeah.
Well?
So you did?
I'm tired now. I want to stop.
- Come on, now. You can't stop there.
- Well, I'm tired, I want to go to bed!
- Well, you can't.
- Why?
I want to hear about that film.
- Hear what? What? It was bloody awful.
- Why?
- Nosy parker!
- Why?
- Because...
- Yes?
The whole place was full of men.
Jill was the only girl.
It was daft.
All took place in Sweden.
There was this girl,
Brita, who was 16.
She went to stay in this house where there was an older boy.
He kept giving her looks.
But she ignored him completely.
Instead, she took a shower.
She went into the bathroom and took off all her clothes,
the lot, very, very slowly.
It was fantastic.
Water fell down her, bouncing off her breasts.
Is that the first time you'd ever seen a girl naked?
Yes.
Couldn't see everything, though.
It was funny.
All around me, all the men were staring up,
like they were in a church.
Like a secret congregation.
Like those early Christians my mum talks about,
the ones that came together in caves underground.
And then...
- Christ!
- What?
Dad!
I think he saw me.
Alan!
You can hear me. Don't pretend.
- Do I have to come and fetch you? Alan!
- Shut up, will you?
- Alan!
- Stop it!
- Come here this instant. Come on!
- But, Dad!
Come on.
- You went with him, then?
- What else could I do?
It was weird.
I mean, it turned into follow the leader.
Dad trying to look impressive, and me,
I suppose, thinking
I ought to copy him.
It was absolutely stupid.
We stood at the bus stop, like we were three people in a queue,
who didn't know each other.
We must have stayed like that for five minutes.
I tried to speak, I said, I've never been in there before in my life.
Never.
Honest.
Jill tried.
It's true, Mr. Strang.
It wasn't Alan's idea to go there at all. It was mine.
I'm not shocked by films like that, I just...
Think they're silly, that's all.
Bus wouldn't come.
We stood, we stood.
And then suddenly, he spoke.
It felt like it was somebody else talking for him.
I would like you to know something, both of you.
Hey!
I came here tonight to see the manager.
He asked me to call on him for business purposes.
I happen to be a printer, miss...
The picture house needs posters.
That is entirely why I'm here, to discuss posters.
And while I was there, I happened to glance in, and I saw...
I can only say that I am going to complain to the council.
I had no idea they showed films like this.
I'm certainly going to refuse my services.
Yes, of course.
So long as that is understood.
Perfectly.
Come along, Alan.
No.
No fuss, please. Just... just say good night to the young lady.
No, I'm stopping here.
I've got to see her home.
It's proper.
Hmph. Very well.
I'll see you when you choose to return, then.
Very well. Yes.
Terrible.
What was?
His face.
He was scared.
Scared of me.
We've got to walk.
It's four miles.
Yes?
What were you thinking?
It was like I'd been fooled.
Like I was the only person who didn't know.
Every man in the street, everyone
I've ever seen, they all do it.
All of them, they're not just dads.
They're all people with pricks.
And my dad, he's not just a dad either.
He's a man with a prick, too.
He's nothing special.
Nothing special at all. Just a poor old sod on his own.
He goes off at night and does his own secret thing,
which no one will know about, just like me.
You were happy at that second, weren't you,
when you thought about your dad?
Other people have secrets, too.
Not just you.
Yes.
And you felt free, didn't you?
Free to do almost anything.
Yes.
What's in your head?
Her eyes.
I keep looking at them, because I really want...
I really wanted...
To look at her breasts?
Yes.
I love your eyes.
Her face was so warm.
You want her very much?
I can't!
- Go on.
- I can't!
Of course you can.
You're doing wonderfully.
Don't make me, please.
Don't think, just answer.
Come on, Alan.
Where are you now, Alan?
Cabbages, with the moon on them.
Like steel.
All the country, like it's been steel-plated.
I know absolutely where we're going.
Absolutely.
And I can't stop it.
What?
Nothing.
Come on, then.
Where do you go now?
Into his temple?
His holy of holies?
What else can I do?
Are you all right?
Why?
You look weird.
Come here.
Hello.
Hello.
Good things come in threes.
What's the matter?
Alan?
What is it? Say.
Yes, all right, leave.
Take your sweater off.
I will, if you will.
You're beautiful.
So are you.
She put her mouth in mine.
It was lovely.
It was lovely.
What did you do then?
I put it in her.
- Yes?
- I put it in her.
- You did?
- Yes.
- Was it easy?
- Yes.
Describe it.
I told you.
What, exactly?
- I put it in her.
- Did you?
- Yes.
- Did you?
- All the way.
- Did you, Alan?
All the way, I shoved it.
I put it in her all the way.
- Did you?
- Yes.
- Did you, Alan?
- Yes! Yes!
Tell me the truth, Alan. Did you?
Fuck off!
What was it?
You couldn't, though you... wanted to very much?
I couldn't see her.
What do you mean?
Only him!
Every time I kissed her, he was in the way.
- Who?
- You know who!
When I touched her, I felt him.
His side under me, waiting for my hand.
I refused him. I looked...
Looked right at her, and I couldn't do it.
When I shut my eyes, I saw him at once, the streaks on his belly.
I couldn't feel her flesh at all.
I wanted the foam...
Off his neck, not flesh, hide, horse hide.
And I couldn't even kiss her.
- Hello?
- No.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I don't mind.
Really, I don't.
Alan?
- Look at me.
- Get out.
- What?
- Out!
There's nothing wrong.
Believe me.
Please, believe me, there's nothing at all wrong.
Get out!
Listen to me.
Why don't we just sit down for a bit and talk?
Please.
- Just talk?
- Please.
Look, Alan, there's nothing wrong, you know.
It happens sometimes.
It really doesn't matter.
Well, you tell anyone, just you tell and see, that's all.
What do you think I am, Alan?
I'm your friend.
Do you want me to go, then?
Get out!
Equus.
Equus.
Friend.
Friend.
Equus the merciful.
Forgive me.
It wasn't me, not really me.
Take me back.
I'll never do it again,
I swear, please.
Please.
And he? What does he say?
"Mine. You're mine.
"I am yours, and you are mine.
"I see you. I see you, always, everywhere, forever."
"Kiss anyone, and I will see.
"Lie with anyone, and I will see.
Ahh!
"And you will fail, Alan.
"Forever and ever you will fail.
"You will see me, and you will fail.
"The Lord thy God is a jealous God."
He sees you, Alan.
He sees you, forever and ever, Alan.
He sees you. He sees you.
Eyes, white eyes all round. Eyes, like flames coming, coming. God sees.
God sees. My God hast seen!
No.
No more, Equus.
Thou, God, seest...
Nothing.
Nothing!
Here I am. Find me. Find me.
Kill me. Kill me.
Find me, and kill me.
Kill me!
Find me!
And kill me!
Here I am. Here I am.
Find me. Kill me.
Find me and kill me.
Find me and kill me.
Find me and kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Argh!
Alan.
Alan. Alan.
Breathe. Breathe in.
Calm, Alan. Calm. Calm.
Calm.
Now breathe in, deep.
Deep.
Breathe in.
Out. In.
Out. In.
Out.
Come on. Come on, that's a good boy.
Keep it going. In. Out.
In. Out.
Keep it going. Keep it going.
Keep it going.
Easy, now. Easy, now. There.
There.
It's all over now, Alan.
All over now.
He'll go away now.
You'll never see him again.
You'll never see him again,
I promise you.
There'll be no more bad dreams.
No more awful nights.
Think of that.
You're going to be well.
I'm going to make you well.
I promise you.
You just trust me.
Trust me.
Just trust me.
Trust me.
Now trust me, Alan.
You lie back.
Lie back.
Sleep.
Just sleep.
You've earned it.
Sleep, Alan.
Sleep.
Remember, he'll go away now.
I'm going to make you well.
Sleep.
Sleep.
I'm lying to you, Alan.
He won't really go that easily, just clop away, like some nice old carthorse.
No, when Equus leaves, if he leaves at all, it'll be with your... intestines in his teeth.
And I don't stock replacements.
The boy's in pain, Martin.
Yes.
But you can take it away.
Yes.
Then that has to be enough for you.
All right.
I'll take it away. What then?
He'll feel himself acceptable.
What then?
You think feelings like his can be simply reattached,
like plasters stuck on other objects we select?
I mean, look at him.
My desire might be to make of this boy an ardent husband, a caring citizen, a worshipper of abstract and unifying God.
My achievement, however, is more likely to make a ghost.
I'll heal the rash on his body.
I'll erase the welts cut into his mind by flying manes.
And when that's done,
I'll put him on a metal scooter,
and send him puttering off into the concrete world,
and he'll never touch hide again.
Hopefully, he'll feel nothing at his fork but approved flesh,
I doubt, however, with much passion.
Passion, you see, can be destroyed by a doctor.
It cannot be created.
You won't gallop anymore, Alan.
Horses will be quite safe.
You'll save your money every week, and change that scooter for a car, and spend glorious weekends grooming that.
You'll pop round to the betting shop and put the odd 50 pence on the nags, quite forgetting that they ever meant anything more to you than bearers of little profits and little losses.
You will, however, be without pain, almost completely without...
Pain.
And now, for me,
it never stops,
the voice of Equus,
out of the cave.
"Why me?
"Why me?
"First...
"Account for me."
How can I?
In an ultimate sense,
I cannot know what
I do in this place.
Yet I do ultimate things, irreversible things.
And I...
I stand in the dark with a blade in my hand, striking at heads.
I need...
More desperately than my children need me, a way of seeing in the dark.
What way is this?
What dark is this?
I cannot call it ordained of God!
I cannot go so far!
I will, however, pay it so much homage.
There is now, in my mouth,
Oh, god!
It was a brilliant lecture, doctor.
Yeah. the best of the year.
Careful, all these bravos will go to an old Ph.D.'s head.
And now, if you'll take the Necronomicon and return it to the library,
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
Doctor, don't forget we're picking you up for dinner.
I'll be there.
And you take good care of that book.
You know, some of that stuff he said sort of got to me.
It's ridiculous.
No, no. I know what you mean.
Especially those creepy people and some of the things they did.
Can you lift that?
Could I see that before you put it away?
Do you always sneak up on people like that?
Oh, my, you scare easily.
I'd really like to glance through that book, the Necronomicon.
Well, that's impossible.
I've traveled a long way.
The library is closing.
Come on.
Give me 5 minutes.
Absolutely not!
Wait a minute.
I don't suppose it would do any harm.
Are you crazy?
Uh, why don't you take it in there?
Thank you.
You must be insane.
Oh, it'll be all right.
He'll take care of it.
He'll take care of it?
That book is priceless.
Oh, stop worrying about the book.
Did you notice his eyes?
He's really got great eyes.
Nancy, what do you do?
You're giving his rarest book to the first kook that comes along.
Well, uh...
I... I trust him.
"Yog-Sothoth...
"it is the gate whereby the spheres meet.
"only Them from Beyond can make it multiply and work.
"Yog-Sothoth is the key.
"and with the gate open, the Old Ones shall be...
"past, present, future... all are one.
"the Old Ones walk serene and primal...
"undimensioned and unseen...
"the Old Ones broke through of old...
"and they shall break through..."
The book, please.
The book, please.
Oh, there's no need to be upset.
I was only reading it.
Have you any idea what this volume is worth?
It's one of a kind.
Of course, a generation ago, there was another copy...
40 miles from here.
Young man, I am familiar with Dunwich.
I know.
You've read my paper on Oliver Whateley?
He was a great man.
They hanged him.
They were fools.
Who's to say?
I'm Wilbur Whateley,
Oliver's great-grandson.
Then you know who I am.
Dr. Henry Armitage.
Yes. It's a pleasure to meet a Whateley.
Thank you.
Doctor?
Oh, it's easy to see why you 2 girls were so effectively charmed.
I'm very glad to have met this young man.
We share a mutual interest.
In fact, I'd like to talk further with you.
We might learn a great deal from each other, don't you think?
About Dunwich, perhaps?
Dunwich, dr. Armitage, might appear to you as just another small town.
The people of Dunwich are just like everyone else.
They're just more honest about it.
You see man as a rather dismal creature.
Yes. Why not?
Look around.
You'll see what's there.
Fear, and frightened people who kill what they can't understand.
It's late.
I should be going.
Dr. Armitage,
I'd like permission to study the Necronomicon.
For what reason, mr. Whateley?
Well, I'm a student of the occult.
And that book is like a bible.
A rather odious comparison.
Uh, no, not really.
It's not enough to say the book is irreplaceable?
No. You're afraid.
Afraid? Possibly.
In ancient times, that book was said to unlock the gates to another dimension, to another race of beings.
I do not share those beliefs, nor do I fully understand them.
However, I know enough about strange things not to laugh at them.
I don't have to tell you
I'd take good care of it.
I'm sorry,
I couldn't possibly let the book out of my hands.
I need it in my own field of study.
Dr. Armitage, will you lend me the book?
I will not.
That's your last word?
Yes.
Let me get part of that.
Oh, nonsense.
Nancy's car is here.
I'll take you to the hotel.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Mr. Whateley.
Maybe we'll meet again.
Perhaps.
I guess I kind of put the damper on a nice evening, but I can't stand pomposity.
I think you've made your point quite clear.
Do you know how much longer he's gonna be in town?
Uh, his last lecture's next Monday.
Monday.
That's only 3 days.
I wanted to hear one of his lectures.
You won't be here that long?
No. I have to go back to Dunwich tonight.
As a matter of fact,
I should get moving, or I'll miss my bus.
What time's your bus?
You just missed it.
Dammit.
There isn't another bus until tomorrow morning.
Well, uh,
I could drive you.
Oh, it's too late.
I couldn't let you do that.
No, no, really.
I mean, I'd like to.
Oh, fine.
It's only a couple more miles, Nancy.
I hope so. We're almost out of gas.
Oh, saved.
It's past closing time.
Oh, couldn't I have a little gas?
Ok. how much? can you fill it up, please?
Service with a smile.
Say, how far is the town?
Oh, it's down that way.
But we turn off right up here.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to see Dunwich.
It's all right.
There's not much to see at night.
Besides, everything in town closes up pretty early.
$1? I asked you to fill it up.
Aren't you gonna finish the window?
Boy, I could never get used to treatment like that.
They've treated me that way since the day
I was born.
They never change.
They're still the same frightened, superstitious fools.
That's even crazier than you said.
Would you like to come in and see the inside?
Oh, no, no.
I'd like to, but really,
I should start back.
Just have a drink... or cup of tea.
I really shouldn't.
Please.
Ok.
Well?
What do you think?
Well, I don't know what to think.
I'm glad you find it interesting.
Would you like a cup of tea?
Please.
Fine.
It's been a long ride.
If you feel like freshening up, there's a bathroom right through that door.
Thank you.
Wilbur!
Wilbur!
This is my grandfather.
I want to speak to you.
We were just going to have some tea.
I'll see you when we're finished.
I'll be waiting for you.
Sorry.
Sit down, Nancy.
I thought you lived alone.
Gee, I'm sorry he frightened you.
Do you want sugar or cream?
No, thank you.
Tell you the truth, I didn't think he'd be up this late.
Oh, it's all right.
It's just that he startled me.
Wilbur, when you were in the kitchen,
I heard strange sounds.
Oh? what kind of sounds?
I'm not sure.
I mean, it sounded like wind... or the ocean.
That's what it was.
This place is so old.
When the wind blows, everything kind of creaks.
Oh, Wilbur,
I'm sorry.
I dropped something before.
Oh?
The... glass.
Oh.
That's nothing.
It's all right.
Well...
I guess I'd better start back.
Finish your tea.
No, really, no.
It's late. I must go.
I understand.
Well, you come back and visit soon, will you?
We'll see each other again.
What's wrong?
Hell, I don't know.
I wish I could help, but I don't know much about cars.
I don't think this thing's gonna start.
Maybe we ought to phone a garage.
You wouldn't believe it, but I don't have a telephone.
Well, that's great. now what am I gonna do?
I don't know.
You-you know, this is really a good idea.
I'm completely wiped out.
I... I don't even think I could drive if I had to.
I'm sure you'll feel better in the morning.
Oh, yes. yes.
I'm sorry about this room, but it hasn't been used for years and years.
Oh, no, no. don't apologize. it's fine, fine.
Uh... let's see.
Here's a nightgown you can put on if you like.
Thank you.
Wilbur...
Good night.
Good night.
Who is she?
Just a girl.
She gave me a ride home.
Does anyone know she's out here?
No.
Suppose she goes up there?
She won't.
She has no reason to.
She didn't come home last night.
She must've driven that boy home.
I could see she was attracted to him, but I don't think going out there was such a good idea.
Well, didn't you try to telephone?
I couldn't get a listing.
Oh.
It's not like her not to have called me.
Now, if he were a straight guy,
I wouldn't be worried.
I can't remember much more, except it was the weirdest dream I've ever had.
Sounds kind of sexual to me.
Ok, dr. Freud, tell me what it all means.
Well, this is our first session.
It's a little hard to tell.
Are you prepared to answer some questions?
Ask me anything.
All right. How do you feel about sex?
I think it's great.
So do I, Nancy.
Well, I mean, I think it's great if it's at the right time and the right place.
You've led a strange life here, Wilbur.
I was raised by my grandfather, and he taught me all the things he knows.
I had to work harder than most kids, but it hasn't been so bad.
Well, I come from the city and... well, I just... I don't know, I never felt so relaxed or had such peace of mind.
I think the country does that for people.
Nancy, why don't you stay the weekend? well, I'd like to, Wilbur, but I... I couldn't.
But you'd like to, though, huh?
Her car's there.
She's gotta be around somewhere.
What do you want?
Pardon us.
We're looking for our friend...
Nancy Wagner.
I'm dr. Armitage and this is
Elizabeth Hamilton.
We met your grandson
Wilbur yesterday in the university.
Armitage? what would my grandson want with you?
He came to see me about a book I own, the Necronomicon.
Look, is my girlfriend here or isn't she?
No! go away!
Go away!
Were you looking for us, doctor?
Nancy!
Are you all right?
I was worried about you.
Of course she's all right.
She's not a child.
She drove me home last night and then she decided to stay the weekend.
Didn't you, Nancy?
Yes. yes, I did.
So if that's what you came to see about, doctor,
I guess we'll be saying goodbye.
Nancy, wait a second.
Do you know what you're doing?
Of course I know what I'm doing.
I'm staying with Wilbur.
Nancy... bye, Elizabeth.
Boy, I really can't believe
She dragged dr. Armitage all the way up here.
I mean, that's something I...
I expect from my mother.
Doesn't matter.
Would you like some more tea?
Please.
You tired, or is it the company?
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't know,
I'm kinda sleepy.
Well, we did take a long walk today.
Yeah.
Maybe you could use a little nap.
You know, that's not a bad idea. um, we are going to town, aren't we?
Sure. But I think you'll enjoy yourself more if you can keep your eyes open. um, I'll be all right.
You lied to me.
Now tell me the truth!
Keep your voice down, will you?
Why is she here?
I told you, her car broke down.
What about this?
Don't be ridiculous.
And those people.
You told me no one knew she was here.
They don't matter.
That man Armitage wrote the paper on my father.
He knows all about us.
I don't have to answer to you.
I do what I want.
Come back here!
Let the book be!
You know, it happened
25 years ago.
They were a strange family.
I just hope there's something in there.
This used to be the town bank, you know.
Ah, here it is.
This is the one.
Let's get it out in the light.
Ah, here it is just like I told you.
"Mother named Lavinia, father unknown.
"Child called Wilbur."
I set that type myself
25 years ago.
Who was the delivering physician?
Same old doc that delivers all of them around here... doc Cory.
Thank you, mr. Fuller.
Elizabeth...
Dr. Armitage!
If I were you, I'd stay away from the Whateleys.
Elizabeth.
That was the original town square.
70 years ago, there was a big oak tree right there in the middle of the street.
That's where the people of Dunwich lynched my great-grandfather.
They just let him hang there for days and days and days and days.
Then they burned the tree down to the ground.
Wilbur, stop it.
It's just history.
Why did they do it?
Because he didn't believe in what they believed.
Because he wasn't afraid of their god or their devil either, for that matter.
In fact, he thought they were pretty much alike.
What did he believe in?
In another race of beings from a different dimension.
An earlier race, superior to man.
And he believed they could be brought back.
You mean they
Hanged him for that?
Yes.
They trumped up
A murder charge
To cover it up.
A girl had disappeared and...
Then without a shred of evidence,
They went after him.
They claimed he used her
In some sort of sacrifice.
You must be worried, too,
To go to all of this trouble.
Ok, the doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
I won't be long.
Dr. Cory?
Yes?
I'm Henry Armitage, doctor of philosophy.
I'm lecturing at the university in Arkham.
Oh, yes, yes, well...
What can I do for you, doctor?
I'm... not sure.
I have a rather strange request.
Well, a country doctor is used to them.
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
Well, now...
Please go ahead.
I'd like to ask you some questions
About the Whateley family.
Well, that's an odd bird of an ailment,
But it flares up now and again in these parts.
Haven't you ever been there?
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't go near that place.
Why?
Oh, that place
Gives me the creeps.
But why?
Well... some say
That old Whateley and Wilbur aren't alone...
That there's something else.
What do you mean
"something else"?
I... I don't know exactly, but, uh...
When I was a little kid,
The other children and I,
We thought the old Whateley house was haunted.
Of course, I don't believe that anymore,
But I keep away
And so does everyone else.
Anyway, the old man and Wilbur, they haven't allowed anyone on the place in years.
Oh.
Well, a friend of mine is out there right now.
What?
Yeah.
She's out there with Wilbur.
Wilbur Whateley has a girlfriend?
Oh, I don't believe it!
Well, hasn't it ever happened before?
Not with any girl around here.
I saw your name on the birth records.
Well...
You have me in an awkward position, doctor.
And before
I can reveal
Anything to you,
I must know the purpose of your inquiry.
Of course. Dr. Cory, this will sound quite fantastic, but I ask your indulgence.
Please bear with me and then decide for yourself.
Where the Whateleys are concerned, there is very little that is not fantastic.
I wonder what's going on.
Look...
I don't want to worry you, but if I had a friend down at weird Wilbur's,
I'd get her out of there.
Let me put it this way, doctor.
The legend of the Necronomicon has it that long ago the earth was inhabited by a species from another dimension.
With certain chants from the book, coupled with ancient rites and sacrifices, this race, the Old Ones, can be brought back.
And mankind?
Destroyed.
And from what you've seen of young Whateley,
You think it's actually possible
That he might believe that?
The book, the girl...
I don't know what to think.
If he does believe the legend, from my impression of Wilbur, he'd be capable of anything.
If he does attempt one of those rituals, that girl is in grave danger.
Well, it's hard to accept.
But then, it wouldn't be the first time that someone else paid the penalty for Whateley fanaticism.
Oh?
Yes, you see...
It wasn't I who delivered young Whateley.
It was his grandfather.
It's been
25 years, but I'll never forget that day
As long as I live.
I was in Osborne's store,
Just chatting with a few of the locals.
Old Whateley came running in all of a sudden, all wild-eyed and crazier than ever.
But nobody ever saw much of the Whateleys in town, so it was a surprise right off.
He always took a lot of jeering from the townsfolk.
Well, they didn't waste a minute's time before they started in on him.
I don't care what you folks say.
If Lavinia's boy looked like his pa, he'd wouldn't look like nothing you expect.
You needn't think that the only folks are the folks hereabouts.
Lavinia's read some
And has seen some things that most of you can only tell about.
Some day, you folks'll hear a child of Lavinia's
Calling his
Father's name from the top of Sentinel Hill.
And then you'll know!
And you'll wish to god you didn't!
All right, fellas, that's it.
As I entered the bedroom, there were 2 elderly albino women, robed entirely in black, standing watchfully over her.
She was burning up with fever and soaking wet.
God only knows what went on out there that day.
It was plain to see she'd been out in the rain.
They told me that she'd had twins.
One of them was stillborn.
Though I never saw the body.
And since old Whateley's not allowed anyone out there since, it's possible that baby may have lived.
It's a miracle that Wilbur came through it all right.
Lavinia's insides were all torn up.
Well, I did everything
I could for her.
She was so far gone,
I was lucky to save her life.
Her mind was gone forever.
Of course, we never did find out who the father was.
And the 2 old women?
I don't know.
Never saw them around here before or since.
Where's Lavinia now?
Incredible.
It is hard to believe
That she's only
45 years old.
She's been here now for more than 20 years.
There's been no appreciable change.
Walk unseen
In lonely places...
Old Ones...
Oh, my sons,
Open the Gate, my sons!
Could I go in
And talk to her?
I'm afraid not.
She's violent.
At times, extremely so.
I'd like to try.
It wouldn't do any good.
Lavinia?
Lavinia?
I want to talk to you.
Kill them all!
Let them in!
Kill them all!
Do you think you've had enough to eat?
Oh, plenty.
Well, let's take a walk.
There's something
I want to show you.
Okay.
You all right?
Yeah. I'm just a little dizzy.
I'll help you.
It's not far.
I'll be all right.
It's not much further.
What's in the package?
Look.
It's just fantastic.
What is it?
No one knows exactly.
Legend has it that it's been here forever.
It's called the Devil's Hopyard.
Fertility rites were practiced here, so they say.
Is this an altar?
Yes.
But what was it used for?
When the seasons
And the cycles of the moon were ripe,
Then they came one by one and gathered among these stones.
And they selected a beautiful girl like you.
Do you remember what we talked about this morning?
Yes.
When you asked me that question about sex?
Yes?
I lied.
I know.
Then they placed the girl's virginal body upon the altar, naked to the elements.
And their black robes blending into the night, they lighted candles and gathered round to observe and to relish her nakedness.
And then they waited.
They waited for the moment
When she would allow the power of darkness to enter her.
The moment when the gate would open and the Old Ones would come through.
And a strange chant echoed in the night.
Yog-Sothoth...
Yog-Sothoth!
Hello! Is anybody here?
Hello!
I thought I told you to stay away from here.
I'm not staying away from anywhere.
I'm looking for my girlfriend,
And I wanna see her now.
She's not here!
Now get off my land!
I'm going inside!
No, you're...
Don't touch me!
Nancy?
Nancy, it's
Elizabeth!
Nancy?
Stop!
Nancy?
Where are you?
No!
There's a car outside. Who's here?
She came looking for her friend.
Make sense, will you?
Who's here?
She went up those stairs.
Elizabeth.
Wilbur, where's Elizabeth?
I don't know.
He knows.
Shut up, you old fool!
You're the fool!
I know your plan!
You can't succeed!
You disgust me.
You've taken their abuse, and you've given up.
They've broken you.
But the Old Ones are coming back.
I'm going to let them through.
No! I tried and I destroyed your mother.
You'll fail, too.
You'll destroy her!
Oliver had the book.
It didn't help.
He had the wrong girl.
She resisted and she died.
Now you listen to me.
I'm going to succeed where you failed.
I'll stop you!
I'll stop you!
Stop... him...
Wilbur... those birds...
What does it mean?
They were trying to capture his soul as it left his body.
But they're quiet now.
They didn't get him.
He's free.
Darkness leads unto darkness.
Let this soul transcend the bounds of earth and be delivered to the spirit of darkness.
Death shall be the carriage of this soul.
Let the cry of the birds transport the spirit.
Yog-Sothoth...
Accept this man into the death of darkness.
Hear me, Old Ones, for your time is coming.
This death shall mark the beginning of your journey.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Nyagh Yog-Sothoth.
See? I told you he was here.
He's burying the old man.
Like hell, he is!
From darkness we came...
All right, hold it!
We bury our trash at the county dump, not here!
This is a christian cemetery.
No place here for your kind.
From darkness we came...
I said hold it!
Give me that book.
Now, you get out here.
You take your garbage with you!
When I'm finished.
You're finished now!
All right, hold on!
Hold on, you two!
What in hell are you trying to do?
I was trying to bury my grandfather.
We got family buried here.
We don't want no Whateleys among them.
We own this plot, and
I have the right to use it.
No one's getting buried just yet.
There's been no death certificate issued on this body.
We'll have to take it back till it's all straightened out legally.
Come on, Nancy.
Now, Nancy, you'll wait right here, won't you?
I'll wait.
Put it back.
Pick it up.
Unh!
Hello?
Uh, Cory here.
Raskin just telephoned me from the asylum.
I thought you'd want to know.
Lavinia is dying.
From what?
What happened?
Well, I'm not sure, but it sounds as if all hell's breaking loose.
Well, can we go over there?
I'll pick you up.
No, it'll be faster if I meet you there.
Oh, do you remember the girl that was with me yesterday?
Yes.
I still haven't been able to reach her.
It just occurred to me.
She was talking with your nurse.
Well, Cora's right here,
I'll ask her.
Cora, the girl with dr. Armitage,
She didn't happen to say where she was going, did she?
Why no, doctor.
Well, I'm sorry, Armitage,
You're out of luck.
I'll see you at the asylum.
All right. Ok.
Now, Cora, I won't be back tonight,
So why don't you leave all that work till the morning?
No, I'd rather get it done this evening, doctor.
All right.
Well, suit yourself.
And be sure you...
Be sure you lock up, won't you?
Good night.
Good night.
We've done everything we can.
Blood pressure, pulse, respiration...
Everything is sky-high.
So it can't last much longer.
What caused it?
I wish i knew.
Listen.
The birds are in rhythm with her breathing.
Listen!
Yes... my son.
She's finished.
They've stopped.
What was she muttering?
The birds.
That chant.
The Necronomicon.
Dr. Cory,
I've got to get to the library right away.
Land of light... the army of darkness shall sweep down.
They are gathered like a horde of avengers, life within life, the power that summons.
Come back, Old Ones...
Princes of Darkness, and repossess the earth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
I summon you.
Come, brother of darkness.
Leave your prison and help me bring the Old Ones through.
Brother of my blood, my soul, I summon you.
The time has arrived.
Now we wait no longer.
We must act.
Upon this sacrifice, shall the journey begin.
"Yog-o-oth. Yog-o-oth.
"Join the circle, complete the chain.
"Yog-Sothoth is the gate
"whereby the spheres meet.
"And with the gate open,
"the Old Ones shall be.
"Man rules now where they ruled once.
"They wait, patient and potent,
"for here they shall reign again,
"and rule where they once walked.
"The Old Ones broke through of old,
"and they shall break through again".
Yog-Sothoth!
We thank thee, o Lord, for the food we are about to take for the nourishment of our bodies.
Amen.
Something's bothering Rusty.
Been acting strange, all right.
What's the matter, baby lamb?
Please...
Lucille?
Ah!
The gate is opening now.
We don't have long to wait.
You're one of us now.
It's time.
You saw what Wilbur did to get the book.
He's going to try to let the Old Ones through.
Whether they exist or not doesn't matter.
He's not responsible for his actions.
If you're right, how are we going to handle it?
What? Something's going on.
Well, that's the Cole place.
Harrison.
- I tried to call you, doc.
- What's happened?
All hell's busted loose.
Damn Whateleys.
No man would have mutilated the bodies that way.
I don't say the Whateleys did it,
But damn it, they're responsible.
Settle down, Reeger.
Settle down? There're dead people in there.
What do you mean settle down?
Reeger's right.
Let's go get them!
You can't do this.
You stop them,
Reeger, or I will.
Well, let's go!
My family's not gonna...
Come on, let's go!
Stop! Stop, you can't kill Wilbur Whateley.
He didn't do this,
But he may be the only man who can save us from what did.
Why should we listen to you?
Well, you all know me.
I delivered most of you.
I'm telling you to listen to this man.
He's the only one who can help us.
What do you want me to do?
Get in your cars,
And meet us at the Whateley place.
Come on.
Listen!
What in god's name is that?
I've never heard anything like that.
Henry, it's really happening, isn't it?
It's moving toward the hill.
The Devil's Hopyard.
We've got to get up there.
All right, now,
Let's all spread out,
And all of you, stay on your toes.
Hurry up, let's go.
Start up that way.
You all right, Reeger?
Yeah
Go on,
I'll catch up.
I jammed the damn rifle.
You find anything?
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
My god, what's he doing?
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth!
Ah!
No.
Oh, no. No.
I'm sorry, Nancy.
There were 2 children born that night
25 years ago.
Dr. Cory was told the other one died, but it didn't.
It was caught between this world and another.
Wilbur's twin took after the father.
And the father?
Not of this earth.
It's all over now.
The last of the Whateleys is dead.
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Evening.
Get your hair cut, Mctaggart.
Ah, now, there's a message, Sergeant.
A message for us all.
However, there is a time and place for everything.
Get it removed.
Any serious problems while i've been away?
No, Sergeant, nothing serious.
Just the usual.
Rape, sodomy, sacrilege.
You know.
The lord is my shepherd
I'll not want
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green
He leadeth me
The quiet waters by
He leadeth me
The quiet waters by
"I have received of the Lord...
"that which also i delivered unto you.
"And the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed,
"took bread.
"And when He had given thanks,
"He broke it and said,
"take, eat.
"'This is my body,
"'which is broken for you.
"This do in remembrance of me. '
"And after the same manner, He also took the cup when he had eaten, saying,
"'this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
"'This do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.
"'For as often as you eat this bread...
"'and drink this wine,
"'you do show the Lord's death... till He comes again. '"
That's for his nibs.
Postmarked Summerisle.
- He's got a bit of skirt over there, I bet.
- What, him?
The only woman he's interested in is the Virgin Mary.
- I thought he was going steady with Mary Bannorg.
- Steady's the word.
Two years, he hasn't so much as tickled her fancy.
He's keepin' himself pure for the wedding day.
Ah, poor old Mary.
I don't know what she sees in him.
When those two are married, she'll spend more time on her knees in church than on her back in bed.
All right.
Mornin', all.
- Morning, Hugh.
- Good morning, Sergeant.
Um, there's an anonymous letter for you, Sergeant.
Read it.
"Dear Sergeant Howie,
"none of us have seen May Morrison's daughter Rowan since last year.
"She's only 12 and has been missing... from her home for many months.
"She couldn't have left the island by herself.
"She's too young, and her mother won't say anything about it,
"just to mind my own business.
"Well, I reckon it's all our business when a kid disappears, that's why i'm writing you this letter.
"A child lover.
Summerisle.
P.S. I enclose a picture of Rowan Morrison. "
- Gonna go, Sergeant?
- Aye, aye, of course.
- Have you ever been there?
- Eh, no.
I've tasted the famous apples, of course, but, uh - it's odd, isn't it, all that fruit?
Well, the whole principality is odd.
To start with, they have no licensing laws.
Singing and dancing on a Sunday.
Oh, aye, doubtless that would appeal to a heathen brute like yourself, Mctaggart.
However, this is still, in theory, a law-abiding christian country, however unfashionable that may seem.
Well, I'll call in on this patrol.
Will you call in at Mary's house, tell her I'll be away overnight.
Oh, I am come
To the north country
Ochon, ochon,
Ochrie!
Without a penny
In my purse
To buy a meal
For me
One time I had
A hundred sheep
Ochon, ochon,
Ochrie!
Skipping o'er
Yon (that) narrow creek
And growing wool
For me
It was upon a lammas night
When corn rigs are bonnie
Beneath the moon's unclouded light
I held a while to Annie
The time went by with careless heed
Till 'tween the late and early
With small persuasion she agreed
To see me through the barley
Corn rigs and barley rigs and
Corn rigs are bonnie
I'll not forget that happy night
Among the rigs with Annie
Will you send a dinghy, please?
Did you hear me?
I'd like a dinghy, if you please.
Hello, sir! Have you lost your bearings?
No, sir, I don't think so.
- This is Summerisle, is it not?
- It is, sir!
Well, I'm right then. Now, would you send a dinghy, please?
I'm afraid it can't be done, sir!
This is private property!
You can't land here without written permission!
I, as you can see, am a police officer.
A complaint has been registered by a resident of this island about a missing child.
Now, that makes it a police matter, private property or not.
Now, will you send a dinghy, please?
Corn rigs and barley rigs
And corn rigs are bonnie
I'll not forget that happy night
Among the rigs with Annie
Good day to you, sir.
I'm the harbour master.
Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.
A missing child is always trouble.
Aye, aye, aye, for everybody.
Perhaps you would be good enough to explain matters to his lordship.
He's most particular who lands here.
All in good time.
We, too, have our own particularities.
You know her?
Her name is Rowan Morrison.
No, no, never seen her before.
I don't know the face either.
Do you know her, Kenny?
She doesn't belong to this island.
No, I never saw her before.
No, she doesn't belong here at all. Johnnie?
No, can't say I know her.
Now, now, what are you saying?
You're saying that she is not from the island.
Aye, that's right.
She's not from here.
Oh, you get Morrisons on Lewis and a few on Mull. I would try there.
Thanks.
"None of us have seen May Morrison's daughter Rowan since last year.
She's only 12, and she's been missing from her home for many months. "
The mother's name is May Morrison.
Oh, May! She quite slipped my memory.
Of course we've got May.
She keeps the post office in the high street.
- May Morrison? You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.
Well, thank you for your help.
That's not May's daughter, though!
No, she's not May's.
Then who is she?
The sky was blue the wind was still
The moon was shining clearly
I set her down with right good will
Among the rigs of barley
I kenned her heart with all my own
I loved her most sincerely
I kissed her o'er and o'er again
Among the rigs of barley
- Good afternoon!
- I like your rabbits.
Those are hares, not silly old rabbits.
Lovely march hares.
Can I help you?
- Mrs. Morrison- mrs. May Morrison?
- Yes.
- Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.
- Oh, my!
Did you come over in that aeroplane that I saw flying round?
- Aye, that's right.
- What, just to see me?
Well, no, not exactly.
I'm making inquiries about your daughter.
- We understand that she's missing.
- Missing? My daughter?
- Aye. You do have a daughter.
- Yes.
- And that's her?
- Oh, never.
I tell you no.
I think you'd better come with me.
This is our Myrtle.
She was nine last thursday.
She's not a bit like the girl in your photograph.
She must be at least
13 or 14, surely.
Myrtle, say hello.
This is Sergeant- oh!
- Howie.
- Oh.
- Hello, Myrtle.
How do you do? Look, mummy, I'm drawing a hare.
- Ah.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Hello.
- Here you are. You can fill in the ears in gray. Oh, sorry.
Thank you, Myrtle.
Myrtle, do you- do you know Rowan?
Of course I do.
- You do?
- 'Course I do, silly.
- Uh, do you know where she is now?
- In the fields.
She runs and plays there all day.
Does she?
Do you think she'll be coming back for tea?
Tea? Hares don't have tea, silly.
- Hares?
- She's a hare.
Rowan's a hare.
She has a lovely time.
- Well, tell me-
- Well, now, Sergeant.
You will stay and have a cup of tea, won't you?
- Oh, well, yes, yes, please.
- Good.
- That's very kind of you.
- Um, not at all.
It must be thirsty work, asking all those questions, eh?
- Ah, aye.
- Hello.
- Good evening. Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Hello again.
- Are you the landlord here?
- Aye.
I'm Alder Macgreagor. And you must be the policeman from the mainland.
Aye, that's right. Sergeant Howie,
West Highland constabulary.
I'm quite obviously not going to get back to the mainland tonight so I wondered if you had a room and a bite of supper I could have.
- Could you manage that?
- Aye, I think that can be arranged.
My daughter Willow will show you to your room.
Willow!
Father?
This is Sergeant Howie, a policeman from the mainland, who will be spending the night with us.
- This is my daughter, Willow.
- Good evening.
Show the Sergeant to his room, would you?
Much has been said of the strumpets of yore
Of wenches and bawdy house queens by the score
But I sing of a baggage that we all adore
The landlord's daughter
You'll never love another
Although she's not the kind of girl
To take home to your mother
Her ale, it is lively and strong to the taste
It is brewed with discretion never with haste
You can have all you like if you swear not to waste
The landlord's daughter
And when her name is mentioned
The parts of every gentleman do stand up
At attention
Now they say of the blossom in all of the town
That she takes off her garter and starts on the tug
That dolly who keeps her ain't horrible now
While I'll take the landlord's daughter
Oh, nothing can delight so
- As does the part that lies between
- Her left toe
And her right toe
- I'd like my supper now, please.
- It won't be long, Sergeant.
Oh, you don't want to let them worry you.
Why don't you have a wee drink?
No, thank you, not just now.
I think you all ought to know that
I am here on official business.
I am here to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, as doubtless, the harbour master has already told you by now.
There's the girl.
Her name is Rowan Morrison.
Would you pass that among your customers, please?
Now, if any of you can give me any idea as to her whereabouts,
I'd be most grateful if you'd let me know.
No, I'm afraid nobody's seen her, Sergeant.
Thank you. These Harvest
Festival photographs?
Aye. We have one taken at the end of every summer.
- What happened to last year's?
- Mm, it got broke.
Your supper's ready, Sergeant.
Willow, show the Sergeant to the dining room.
Thank you.
It's disgusting.
- Thank you.
- What's the matter, aren't you hungry?
Aye, it's just that most of the food I've had- the farmhouse soup, the potatoes, broad beans- all come out of a can.
Broad beans, in their natural state, aren't usually turquoise, are they?
- Hmm.
Some things in their natural state have the most vivid colors.
I just wanted to know why, that's all.
Now, I wonder what you'll be wanting for afters?
- Hmm, I'll have an apple.
- No apples.
No apples? On Summerisle?
I expect they've all been exported.
You can have peaches and cream, if you like.
Aye, from a can, I suppose.
All right.
Cheer up. Food isn't everything in life, you know.
Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up, up, up!
- Where?
You'll find it at the top of the stair on your right.
I put my hand
On her knee
And she says
Do you want to see
I put my hand
- Willow Macgreagor.
On her breast
And she says
Do you want a kiss
Willow Macgreagor, I have the honor to present to you Ash Buchanan.
Gently, Johnny
- Come up, Ash Buchanan.
Gently, Johnny my jingaloe another sacrifice for Aphrodite, Willow.
You flatter me, your lordship.
Surely you mean,"to aphrodite."
I make no such distinction.
You are the goddess of love in human form, and I am merely your humble acolyte.
Enjoy yourself, and him.
Only make sure you are ready, for tomorrow is tomorrow.
The day of death and rebirth.
Yes.
And of a somewhat more serious offering... than tonight.
I put my hand
On her thigh
And she says
Do you want to try
I put my hand
On her belly
And she says
Do you want to fill me
Gently, gently
Gently, Johnny
My jingaloe
Gently, gently
Gently, Johnny
My jingaloe
I think I could turn and live with animals.
They are so placid and self-contained.
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God.
Not one of them kneels to another or to his own kind that lived thousands of years ago.
Not one of them is... respectable
Gently, gently
- or unhappy
Gently, Johnny all over the earth.
Gently, Johnny my jingaloe
Gently, gently
Gently, Johnny
My jingaloe
Good morning,
Sergeant.
- Morning.
- Isn't it glorious?
Aye, aye, it's very nice.
I expect you'll be going home tonight.
Well, that depends.
- Where's the school, please?
- On the far side of the green.
Thank you.
In the woods there grew a tree
And a fine, fine tree was he
And on that tree there was a limb
And on that limb there was a branch
And on that branch there was a nest
And in that nest there was an egg
And in that egg there was a bird
And from that bird a feather came
And of that feather was
A bed
And on that bed there was a girl
And on that girl there was a man
And from that man there was a seed
And from that seed there was a boy
And from that boy there was a man
And for that man there was a grave
And from that grave there grew
A tree
And on that bed there was a girl
And on that girl there was a man
And from that man there was a seed, and from that seed there was a boy
And from that boy there was a man
And for that man there was a grave
And from that grave there grew
A tree
And on that tree there was a limb and on that limb
There was a branch and on that branch there was a nest
And in that nest there was an egg
And in that egg there was a bird, and from that bird, a feather came
And of that feather was
A bed
Very well, girls. That's enough.
Now it's time to pay attention to me.
Now, uh, Daisy, will you tell us what it is, please, that the maypole represents?
Really, Daisy.
- You've been told often enough.
- Miss Rose, I know!
- All right, then, anybody.
- Phallic symbol.
The phallic symbol.
That is correct.
It is the image of the penis, which is venerated in religions such as ours, as simbolising the generative force in nature.
Oh, can I help you?
C- could-could I have a word with you, please, miss?
Certainly. Girls, open your desks and take out your exercise books.
Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall report this to the proper authorities.
Everywhere I go on this island, it seems to me I find degeneracy. and there is brawling in bars, there is indecency in public places, and there is corruption of the young, and now I see it all stems from here- it stems from the filth taught here in this very schoolroom.
I was unaware that the police had any authority in matters of education.
Aye, aye, well, we'll see about that.
Girls, could I have your attention, please?
Now, I am a police officer.
Well, as you can see.
I have come here from the mainland... to investigate the disappearance of a young girl.
I have a photograph here- excuse me- which I would like you to pass around amongst yourselves.
Meanwhile, I'll write her name over there on the blackboard.
Rowan Morrison.
That's her name.
Now, do any of you recognize either the name or the photograph?
- No.
- There's your answer, Sergeant.
If she existed, we would know.
- Whose desk is that?
- No one's.
Thank you.
The little old beetle goes round and round, always the same way, you see, till he ends up right up tight to the nail, poor old thing.
"Poor old thing"?
Then why in God's name do you do it, girl?
I'd like to see the school register, please.
I'm afraid you'll have to have
Lord Summerisle's authority.
This is a police matter.
I'm afraid you'll have to have a search warrant or permission from Lord Summerisle himself.
I'm afraid you'll just have to bear with me, won't you?
You're liars. You are despicable little liars.
Rowan Morrison is a schoolmate of yours, isn't she?
And that is her desk, isn't it?
- Well, isn't it?
- I think you ought to know-
And you are the biggest liar of all.
I warn you, one more lie out of you, and I will charge you with obstruction, and, believe me, Miss Rose, that is a promise.
Now, for the last time, where is Rowan Morrison?
I would like to speak to you outside, Sergeant.
Girls, get on with your reading.
It's the Rites and Rituals of May Day, chapter five. I won't be long.
Well?
You don't understand, Sergeant.
Nobody was lying. I told you plainly.
If Rowan Morrison existed, we would know of her.
You mean, she doesn't exist?
She's dead?
You would say so.
Oh, come on, come on.
She's either dead, or she's not dead.
Here, we do not use the word-
We believe... that when the human life is over, the soul returns to trees, to air, to fire, to water, to animals, so that Rowan Morrison has simply returned... to the life forces in another form.
Do you mean to say you teach the children this stuff?
Yes. I told you, it is what we believe.
They never learn anything of christianity?
Only as a comparative religion.
The children find it far easier to picture... reincarnation than resurrection.
Those rotting bodies are a great stumbling block for the childish imagination.
Why, of course.
And may I ask, where is the rotting body of Rowan Morrison?
Right where you'd expect it to be- in the earth.
You mean, in the churchyard?
- In a manner of speaking.
- No.
In plain speaking.
The building attached to the ground in which the body lies... is no longer used for christian worship, so whether it is still a churchyard is debatable.
But forgive me. I must get back to my girls.
Good morning to you.
"Here lieth Beech Buchanan, protected by the ejaculation of serpents. "
- Morning.
- Morning.
I see you plant trees on most of the graves here.
- Aye, that's right.
- What tree is that?
That's a rowan.
- And who lies there?
- Rowan Morrison.
- How long has she been dead?
- Oh, six or seven months.
They're just a wee bit late with the headstone.
What on earth's that?
It looks like a piece of skin.
- Why, so it is.
- Well, what is it?
The poor wee lassie's navel string, of course.
Where else should it be but hung on her own little tree?
Where does your minister live?
Minister?
Minister.
Oh, what a silly girl you are to make all this fuss.
It's just a little frog.
It'll do that poor sore throat good.
Now, anyone would think you didn't want to get better.
Now, in he goes.
And out he comes. There. Now, that didn't hurt much, did it?
- It tasted horrid.
- Never mind, darling. It's all over now.
Here's your sweet for being a brave girl.
Come on. Which one would you like?
There. He's got your horrid old sore throat now, hasn't he, poor creature?
Can't you hear him croaking?
Can I do anything for you, Sergeant?
I doubt it, seeing you're all raving mad.
Doctor, tell me, did you sign Rowan
Morrison's death certificate?
Uh, Rowan Morrison.
Yes, I did. Why?
Could I see it, please?
You, of all people, should know that death certificates are kept in the public records office.
Now, if you will excuse me.
Doctor.
Tell me, how did Rowan Morrison die?
She was burnt to death, as my lunch will be if I continue talking to you.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- I'd like to see your index of deaths, please.
- Do you have authority?
- No, I meant from his lordship.
- I don't need it.
I'm afraid you have to get permission from Lord Summerisle.
Miss, if you don't cooperate with me here and now, you may well find yourself inside a police cell on the mainland tonight.
Have I made myself quite clear?
Please.
Thank you.
"M."
"m," "m," "m," "m. "
"Benjamin and Rachel
Morrison. "
- Rachel and Benjamin- names from the Bible.
- Yes.
They were very old.
But, there's no record of Rowan Morrison's death, which means, of course, there is no death certificate.
- Did you know her?
- Yes, of course.
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's her.
How did she die?
- I don't know.
- I don't know anything about her. Nothing.
Thank you.
Are you mr. Lennox, the photographer?
Oh, I'm firstly a chemist, secondly a photographer.
I understand that you take the harvest festival photographs every year- the ones I saw in The Green Man.
Yes, it's rather humdrum work,
I'm afraid.
Do you know what happened to last year's photograph?
Isn't it with the others?
No, no, it's not. No, apparently it's been broken or damaged in some way.
- Oh, what a pity.
- Would you have a copy of it?
Oh, no, I don't keep copies.
Mr. Lennox, you were among the people to whom I showed the photograph in the Green Man.
Is that the girl?
- It's difficult to say.
- Oh, come on, man!
It was only eight months ago. Surely you remember if it was that girl or not.
Thank you.
Corn rigs and barley rigs
And corn rigs are bonnie
I'll not forget that happy night
Among the rigs with Annie
Take the flame inside you burn and burn below
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby grow
Take the flame inside you
Burn and burn belay
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby stay
Take the flame inside you burn and burn belong
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby strong
Take the flame inside you burn and burn belie
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby cry
Take the flame inside you burn and burn begin
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby king
- His lordship is expecting you, sir.
- Expecting me?
That's what his lordship told me, sir.
Would you please come this way?
In there, sir.
Good afternoon,
Sergeant Howie.
I trust the sight of the young people refreshes you.
No, sir, it does not refresh me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
One should always be open to the regenerative influences.
- I understand you're looking for a missing girl.
- I've found her.
- Splendid.
- In her grave.
Your lordship is a justice of the peace.
I need your permission to exhume her body, have it transported to the mainland for a pathologist's report.
You suspect... foul play?
I suspect murder and conspiracy to murder.
In that case, you must go ahead.
Your lordship seems strangely unconcerned.
I'm confident your suspicions are wrong, Sergeant.
We don't commit murder up here.
We're a deeply religious people.
Religious!
With ruined churches, no ministers, no priests... and children dancing naked.
They do love their divinity lessons.
But they-they are-are naked.
Naturally. It's much too dangerous to jump through the fire with your clothes on.
What-what religion can-can-can they possibly be learning... j- jumping over bonfires?
Parthenogenesis.
What?
Literally, as Miss Rose would doubtless say in her assiduous way, reproduction without sexual union.
Oh, what is all this?
I mean, you-you-you've got fake-fake-fake biology, fake religion.
Sir, have these children never heard of Jesus?
Himself the son of a virgin, impregnated,
I believe, by a ghost.
Do sit down, Sergeant.
Shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent.
Please.
Now, those children out there, they're jumping through the flames in the hope that the god of fire will make them fruitful.
Really, you can hardly blame them.
After all, what girl would not prefer the child of a god to that of some acne-scarred artisan?
- And you, you encourage them in this?
- Actively.
It's most important that each new generation born on Summerisle be made aware that here the old gods aren't dead.
But what of the true god... to whose glory churches and monasteries have been built on these islands for generations past?
Now sir, what of him?
He's dead.
He can't complain.
He had his chance, and in the modern parlance, he blew it.
- What?
- It's very simple.
Let me show you.
In the last century, the islanders were starving.
Like our neighbors today, they were scratching a bare subsistence from sheep and sea.
Then in 1868, my grandfather bought this barren island and began to change things.
A distinguished victorian scientist, agronomist, free thinker.
How formidably benevolent he seems.
Essentially the face of a man incredulous of all human good.
You are very cynical, my lord.
What attracted my grandfather to the island, apart from the profuse source of wiry labor that it promised, was the unique combination of volcanic soil and the warm gulf stream that surrounded it.
You see, his experiments had led him to believe that it was possible to induce here the successful growth of certain new strains of fruit that he had developed.
So, with typical mid-victorian zeal, he set to work.
The best way of accomplishing this, so it seemed to him, was to rouse the people from their apathy... by giving them back their joyous old gods, and as a result of this worship, the barren island would burgeon and bring forth fruit in great abundance.
What he did, of course, was to develop new cultivars of hardy fruits suited to local conditions.
But, of course, to begin with, they worked for him because he fed them and clothed them, but then later when the trees starting fruiting, it became a very different matter, and the ministers fled the island, never to return.
What my grandfather had started out of expediency,
My father continued out of... Love.
He brought me up the same way - to reverence the music and the drama and rituals of the old gods.
To love nature and to fear it, and to rely on it and to appease it where necessary.
- He brought me up -
- He brought you up to be a pagan!
A heathen, conceivably, but not,
I hope, an unenlightened one.
Lord Summerisle, I am interested in one thing: the law.
But I must remind you, sir, that despite everything you've said, you are the subject of a christian country.
Now, sir, if I may have your permission to exhume the body of Rowan Morrison.
I was under the impression I'd already given it to you.
Ah, there's your transport.
It's been a great pleasure meeting a christian copper.
There was a tinker lived of late
Who walked the streets of Rhine.
He bore his pack, upon his back
Watches and plugs did cry
Oh, I have brass within my bag
My hammer's full of metal,
And as to skill I work in clouts
And mend a broken kettle.
A maiden did this tinker meet
And to him boldly say: "Oh, sure
My kettle hath much need
If you will pass my way. "
She took the tinker by the hand
And led him to her door.
Says she "My kettle I will show,
And you can clout it sure.
For patching and plugging is his delight
I found that in Rowan Morrison's grave.
- Little Rowan loved the march hares.
- Hmm.
It's sacrilege.
Only if the ground is consecrated to the christian belief.
Personally, I think it makes a very lovely transmutation.
I'm sure Rowan is most happy with it.
Do you not think so, Lord Summerisle?
Miss, I hope you don't think that I can be made a fool of indefinitely.
Where is Rowan Morrison?
Why, here she is - what remains of her physically.
Her soul, of course, may even now -
Lord Summerisle, where is Rowan Morrison?
Sergeant Howie, I think that... you are supposed to be the detective here.
A child is reported missing on your island.
At first I'm told there is no such child.
I- I then - I then find that there is, in fact, but that she has been killed.
I subsequently discover that there is no death certificate. and now I find that there is a grave.
There's no body.
Very perplexing for you.
What do you think could have happened?
I think Rowan Morrison was murdered... under circumstances of pagan barbarity, which I can scarcely bring myself to believe... as taking place in the 20th century.
Now, it is my intention tomorrow to return to the mainland... and report my suspicions to the Chief Constable of the West Highland Constabulary.
And I will demand a full inquiry takes place into the affairs of this heathen island.
You must, of course, do as you see fit, Sergeant.
Perhaps it's just as well that you won't be here tomorrow, to be offended by the sight of our
May Day celebrations here.
Broome, would you kindly show the Sergeant out?
- This way, sir.
- Good-bye.
Fair maid, says he, your kettle's cracked the cause is plainly told
There hath so many nails been drove mine own could not take hold...
There's hardly any produce.
Well, that's it - the crops failed.
And it's Rowan! Rowan and the crops failed!
Now, what does the old religion say about crop failure?
...to reverence the music, the drama, the rituals of the old gods, to love nature and to fear it, to rely upon it and to appease it when necessary.
Sacrifice.
Perhaps it's just as well that you won't be here... to be offended by the sight of our
May Day celebrations tomorrow.
What if she's not dead?
What if Rowan's not dead?
Sergeant.
Heigh ho
Who is there
No one but me
My dear
Please
Come

The things

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
And every stroke
A bucket full
We carry death out of the village!
We carry death out of the village!
"May Day festivals.
"Primitive man lived and died by his harvest.
"The purpose of his spring ceremonies was to ensure a plentiful autumn.
"Relics of these fertility dramas are to be found all over Europe.
"In Great Britain, for example, one can still see...
"harmless versions of them danced in obscure villages on May Day.
"Their cast includes many alarming characters:
"A man-animal, or hobbyhorse,
"who canters at the head of the procession charging at the girls;
"A man-woman, the sinister teaser,
"played by the community leader or priest;
"And a man-fool, Punch,
"most complex of all the symbolic figures -
"the privileged simpleton and king for a day.
"Six swordsmen follow these figures...
"and at the climax of the ceremony lock their swords together...
"In a clear symbol of the Sun.
"In pagan times, however, these dances were not simply picturesque jigs.
"They were frenzied rites ending in a sacrifice
"by which the dancers hoped desperately to win over the goddess of the fields.
"In good times, they offered produce to the gods and slaughtered animals,
"but in bad years, when the harvest had been poor,
"the sacrifice was a human being.
"In some cultures, it would be the king himself.
"In others, the most beloved virgin.
"Very often he or she would be kept hidden for months preceding the ceremony,
"just as the Sun is hidden from the Earth in winter.
Rowan's not dead!
"Methods of sacrifice differed.
"Sometimes the victim would be drowned in the sea...
"or burnt to death in a huge sacrificial bonfire.
Sometimes the six swordsmen ritually beheaded the virgin. "
Dear God in Heaven, even these people can't be that mad.
"The chief priest then skinned the child,
"and wearing the still-warmed skin like a mantle,
"led the rejoicing crowds through the streets.
"The priest thus represented the goddess reborn and guaranteed another successful harvest next year. "
Good morning, Sergeant!
I need to get to my plane.
Oh, well, on May Day,
I'd better take you out myself.
That's it.
Here, right.
I shall be back shortly with some more police officers.
Have a good flight then!
Hey, you come back here!
I said, come back here!
What's the matter? Won't she go?
No. Has anyone been here?
Not to my knowledge, Sergeant.
If any of the children had been interfering with it, I'm sure I would have seen-
I warn you: you're obstructing a police officer.
I am not obstructing you, Sergeant.
You could maybe get old Sam there to row you to the mainland.
You'd be back in a week.
Well, I'll just have to find Rowan Morrison myself.
- Everything under control, Oak?
- Aye, my lord.
Mr. Macgreagor, I trust we aren't going to have to let out your costume again this year.
I think I'll manage, my lord, but it does seem to shrink a little each year.
I know.
My friends, enough now.
We shall all reassemble outside the town hall at 3:00 sharp... and then process through the village and the countryside, down to the beach below the stones, by the route which has become sacred to our rite.
This year at the procession's end, as has already been proclaimed, a holy sacrifice will be offered up jointly to Nuada, our most sacred god of the Sun, and to Avellenau, the beloved goddess of our orchards, in order that we may furnish them with renewed power... to quicken the growth of our crops.
- Hail the Queen of the May!
- Hail the Queen of the May!
Hail the Queen of the May!
Why, Sergeant, I thought you'd gone back.
Mrs. Morrison, I don't know if you know it or not,
But Rowan is not dead.
- They've got her hidden somewhere.
- They?
Now, if you know where she is, I beg you to tell me now before it's too late.
- Sergeant, I've already told you -
- In the name of God, woman, what kind of mother are you, that can stand by and see your own child slaughtered?
Sergeant, if I were you, I would go back to the mainland.
Stop interfering in things that are no concern of yours.
I am going to search every house in this place during the next few hours. and if anybody, including you, stands in my way, they'll be arrested as accomplices to murder.
You'll simply never understand the true nature of sacrifice.
Heathens! Bloody heathens!
Yes?
- Take those masks off.
- No.
Take them off!
- What do you think you're doing?
- Searching every house... for a missing child.
Baa baa black sheep,
Have you any wool
Yes, sir, yes, sir,
Three bags full
I- I'm sorry.
- What's that?
- The life of the fields.
John Barleycorn.
What's in here?
- What's that?
- That's my costume - the salmon of knowledge.
Hello. You're back early.
Where are the other coppers?
There aren't any. The plane wouldn't start.
Give me a glass of whiskey, please.
So he spent his time instead turning the whole village upside down.
- Just give me a glass of whiskey.
- No wonder he's worn out.
Did you find the girl?
No, well, I can't say I'm very surprised.
I'm going to rest in my bed for half an hour.
I do not wish to be disturbed.
I'd stay there until tonight, if I was you.
We don't much relish strangers around today.
He's asleep.
I don't like to use it on him, really.
The laird said we're to take no chances, didn't he?
I know, but with the Hand of Glory there's no telling when you wake.
He might sleep for days.
- All the better.
- Shh!
- We don't want him butting in. Go on, light it up.
That will make you sleep, my pretty Sergeant.
I'm away to change.
We can't do without Punch.
You best get on ahead.
They've given you girls five minutes start, haven't they?
Good-bye.
What's the matter with you, Macgreagor?
Do you call that dancing?
Cut some capers, man. Use your bladder.
Play the fool. That's what you're here for.
I suppose you've been getting drunk at your own bar.
That's more like it!
Good, good!
Here comes the job, that you chop off your head!
Chop, chop, chop, chop.
Chop, chop, chop, chop.
Everyone must go through, Macgreagor.
It's a game of chance, remember.
It's Holly. Well done.
Now, my friends, to the beach.
O god of the sea,
I offer you this ale as a libation, that you may bestow upon us in the year to come the rich and diverse fruits of your kingdom.
Hail, god of the seas!
Accept our offering!
And now, for our more dreadful sacrifice... yo those who command the fruit of the Earth.
It's Rowan.
What's the matter, Mr. Macgreagor?
Now, don't be frightened. I'm a police officer.
- I've got to try and get you away.
- Hurry, mister, please.
- I don't like it here. They're coming.
Do you know what they're gonna do?
- They're going to -
- Come on, come on. Hurry, hurry!
We can escape through the cave. I know the way.
Quickly.
That's the way out up there.
Come on. It's through a big tunnel.
We seem to have lost our torch-bearing friends.
I'm sorry.
It was worse than I remembered it.
- Did I do it right?
- You did it beautifully.
Dear little Rowan.
Rowan, darling. Come on, now.
Welcome, fool.
You have come of your own free will to the appointed place.
The game is over.
Game? What game?
The game of the hunted leading the hunter.
You came here to find Rowan Morrison, but it is we who have found you and brought you here and controlled your every thought and action since you arrived.
Principally, we persuaded you to think that Rowan Morrison was being held as a sacrifice because our crops failed last year.
I know your crops failed.
I saw the harvest photograph.
Oh, yes. They failed, all right, disastrously so... for the first time since my grandfather came here.
The blossom came but the fruit withered and died on the bough.
That must not happen again this year.
It is our most earnest belief that the best way of preventing this is to offer to our god of the Sun and to the goddess of our orchards the most acceptable sacrifice that lies in our power.
Animals are fine, but their acceptability is limited.
A little child is even better, but not nearly as effective as the right kind of adult.
What do you mean,
"right kind of adult"?
You, Sergeant, are the right kind of adult, as our painstaking researches have revealed.
You, uniquely, were the one we needed.
A man who would come here of his own free will.
A man who has come here with the power of a king by representing the law.
A man who would come here as a virgin.
A man who has come here as a fool.
Get out of my way.
You are the fool, Mr. Howie -
Punch, one of the great fool-victims of history, for you have accepted the role of king for a day, and who but a fool would do that?
But you will be revered and anointed as a king.
You will undergo death and rebirth - resurrection, if you like.
The rebirth, sadly, will not be yours, but that of our crops.
I am a christian, and as a Christian, I hope for resurrection.
And even if you kill me now, it is I who will live again, not your damned apples.
Sleep
Close and fast
No matter what you do, you can't change the fact that I believe in the life eternal, as promised to us by our lord, Jesus Christ.
I believe in the life eternal as promised to us by our lord, Jesus Christ.
That is good.
For believing what you do, we confer upon you a rare gift these days - a martyr's death.
You will not only have life eternal, but you will sit with the saints among the elect.
Come.
It is time to keep your appointment with The Wicker Man.
Now, wait!
Now, all of you, just wait and listen to me.
And you can wrap it up any way you like.
You are about to commit murder.
Can you not see? There is no Sun god.
There is no goddess of the fields.
Your crops failed because your strains failed.
Fruit is not meant to be grown on these islands.
It's against nature.
Don't you see that killing me is not going to bring back your apples?
Summerisle, you know it won't.
Go on, man. Tell them. Tell them it won't.
I know it will.
Well, don't you understand that if your crops fail this year, next year you're going to have to have another blood sacrifice?
And next year, no one less than the king of Summerisle himself will do.
If the crops fail, Summerisle, next year your people will kill you on May Day.
They will not fail.
The sacrifice of the willing king, like virgin fool, will be accepted.
But don't you see I'll be missed?
- They'll come looking for me.
- There will be no traces. Bring him up, Oak.
- Go on.
- No!
Think! Just think what you're doing!
Think what you're doing! Think!
In the name of God, think what you're doing!
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, my God! Christ!
No, no, dear God!
No, Christ!
No, no!
Mighty god of the Sun, bountiful goddess of our orchards, accept our sacrifice and make our blossoms fruit.
Mighty god of the Sun, bountiful goddess of our orchards...
- Hear ye the words of the lord!
...accept our sacrifice and make our blossoms fruit.
Awake, ye heathens, and hold!
It is the Lord who hath laid waste your orchards!
It is he who hath made them bare!
- Reverence the sacrifice.
Hold, ye husbandmen, because the harvest of your field hath perished and the vine is dried up and the apple tree languisheth!
Even all the trees of the field are withered because the truth is withered away from the sons of men.
Desire shall fail and ye shall all die accursed!
Summer is a-comin' in
Loudly sing cuckoo
Grows the seed and blows the mead
And springs the wood anew
Sing cuckoo
Ewe bleats harshly after lamb
Cows after calves make moo
The lord's my shepherd
I'll not want
He takes me down to lie in pastures -
Oh, God.
Grows the seed and blows the mead
And springs the wood anew
- Sing cuckoo
- Oh, God.
I humbly entreat you for the soul of this, thy servant, Neil Howie... who will today depart from this world.
Do not deliver me into the enemy's hands... or put me out of mind forever.
Let me not undergo the real pains of hell, dear God, because I die unshriven
- Cuckoo, cuckoo
- and establish me in that bliss which knows no ending,
- Cuckoo
- through Christ, our lord.
Grows the seed and blows the mead
Failure! Failure!
Sing cuckoo
Ewe bleats harshly after lamb
Cows after calves make moo
Bullock stamps and deer champs
Now shrilly sing cuckoo
Cuckoo, cuckoo
Wild bird are you
Be never still, cuckoo
All over the city, it was an ordinary day for most people.
My name's Eddie Ginley, a small-time bingo caller wanting to be a big somebody.
That day was my 31st birthday.
I could have been home blowing out my candies, instead of which
I was helping my psychiatrist keep count of my marbles.
The count was going slow.
- It's your turn, Doc.
- I can't think of anything to say.
Well, you should say,
"Think. What about your mother'?
"Did you tap pencils when you were a lad?"
I'm not a Freudian, Eddie.
I know, Doc. Ajob, a few potatoes, like the next gazebo.
- How's the act coming?
- Fabulous. I top the bill.
Okay, so I announce the bingo.
Is it a crime?
Eddie, what do you want to do?
- You've asked me that question for a year.
- But you haven't answered for a year.
I want to write The Maltese Falcon,
I want to record Blue Suede Shoes, and I want to play Las Vegas.
- They've done the first two.
- That's the rumour.
- Eddie.
- What?
- Do you know what?
- What?
- You're a bloody nut.
- I owe it all to you, Doc.
- What's this?
- I'm advertising.
Ironing can be fun.
I've been on my awn for about a year,
ever since my best girl ran off with somebody else.
Somebody like my brother.
That's why I ended up with a psychiatrist.
That's why I ran the advert in the paper.
Somebody had to give me a present.
That's what birthdays are for.
The Ginley residence.
One moment.
I'll see if he's in.
Ginley. What is it? Yeah?
No, I can't hear you.
What? Hang on, I've got a pencil.
Okay, shoot, but you're gonna have to speak up.
Yeah? Yeah.
Okay.
Plaza Hotel, room 322, seven-thirty.
I got to the Plaza at 7:25. I had it all figured.
The guys were throwing a surprise party for me, and they'd picked a classy joint.
It was the kind of place where the Axminster tickles your knees
and you need a black tie to take a bath.
Come in.
Come in!
- Forty-one?
- Forty-one!
Shut the door.
- Do they charge you extra for the light?
- Shut up.
- I'm just trying to make small talk, mister.
- It's not needed.
- Make your play.
- To the right.
There's a dresser with a package on it.
- Got it?
- Sure.
- What's the pitch?
- Pitch?
- The job.
- It's all in the package.
- And the folding green?
- What?
- The money, $20 a day plus expenses.
- Twenty dollars?
Twenty little lonely dollars.
We agreed sterling.
I can live with it.
- What are you waiting for?
- I was just going.
We want results.
Broad at the shoulder, narrow at the hip, and everyone knows you don't give no lip to Big Ed.
Ihadn't got a good look at the fellow,
but if the guys had hired him to give me the present, he'd done a good job.
It gets around that you read thrillers,
and pretty soon, everyone's coming on like they were packing a rod.
But thoughts like that could wait.
I was late for the club.
a' Take good care of my baby
♪ Please don't ever make her cry ♪
- Eddie!
- The Plaza, Tommy, phone number'?
- Where the hell have you been?
- Tommy, the Plaza phone number'?
Maritime 5050.
Where the hell have you been?
♪ Just send my baby back home ♪
Where the hell did you get to?
Bloody show...
Eddie, your customers. They're waiting.
Eddie, I'll listen for your phone call.
Oh, you're lovely.
Come on. Get on, then.
And no funny business.
Just announce the act.
Hey, Sammy, get them in.
The teeth, get them in.
Where do you think you are, anyway?
Will you shut up?
Now, folks, if you ever wondered what killed the big bands, you'll soon know as we have, led by your host, Tommy Wright,
The Saturated Seven!
Bloody bugger!
Hello? Yeah? The Plaza?
Room 322, please.
Well, could you give me reception?
Yes.
I picked up a parcel from somebody in room 322, and I wanted to give it him back, but I've forgotten his name.
What? Half an hour ago?
No, it was a fella!
Mrs Blankerscoon?
Well, could you spell that, please?
Mrs Blankerscoon? Okay.
Mrs Blankerscoon.
- Eddie. Interval.
- What?
Interval, Eddie. Come on.
The customers are waiting.
- Come on.
- Yeah, yeah, Tommy.
Come here, you. Your teeth.
Get the buggers in, will you?
How can I? The wife's got 'em.
You'll never do your turn here,
I'll tell you.
Okay, folks, we'll take a break now so eat and drink as if there was no tomorrow.
In fifteen minutes, bingo, so get your brains and pencils sharpened.
Listen, Eddie, come here.
You're always pestering me to let you do a spot.
All right, I'll tell you what.
Tomorrow.
If I let you do your act tomorrow, do you think you could be early just once?
Yeah, Tommy.
Right.
Early tomorrow gets Eddie a spot.
Understand?
- Terrific.
- Eddie.
- Yeah.
All I ask, son, is be a pro.
Be a pro like us.
- A spot, eh?
- Yeah.
Next day, on your dressing room, they'll hang a star.
Or something like that.
- Oh, by the way, Tommy!
- Yep?
You wouldn't give a feller £1,000 for his birthday, would you?
- You what?
- Forget it, Tommy.
I'll come early.
- Who are you?
- I live here.
- You wanna hear anything special?
- Play Melancholy Baby.
How does that go again?
How the hell did you get in here?
Come rain or hail or sleet or snow, the Pinkertons are on the go.
- What's your handle?
- How do you mean?
- What do I call you?
- You decide.
- Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Ellen. Where's William?
-out.
You married the wrong brother, kid.
I wouldn't leave you alone to be threatened in this manner.
I didn't get a better offer.
They were frontier towns, old partner, and it was a game of take and give, and the one who could draw the fastest was the only one who'd live.
- You haven't changed.
- I know, and I'm a year older.
- Oh, yes. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
- We haven't got your present yet.
- You haven't?
- Drink?
- Bourbon on the rocks.
- Milk and sugar'?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Have you come to see William?
- William?
Listen, if William was dying, the priest wouldn't come and see him.
- I say, I say, I say.
- How's the club?
You hear everything, don't you?
That's the trouble with these small burgs.
- Everyone knows everyone else's business.
- Well, how is it?
Okay.
And you're doing what you want to do, aren't you?
Okay, it's great. The club's great.
It's opened a whole new field of unemployment to me.
Do they laugh at you?
Yeah. Yeah, they laugh at me.
I wish theyd laugh at me jokes.
I know it's a bit late to ask, but do you use that to stir your tea?
Stick 'em up.
- Same old Eddie.
- It's a real one, you know.
Even you're too old to be playing with a toy one.
- Put it away.
- Same old Ellen.
- Hov\/s the psychiatry?
- You do hear everything, don't you?
It's okay.
I may have to get a new one, though.
Psychiatrist? Why?
- He's off his head.
- Why didn't you come to the wedding?
- I was waiting for the second house.
- No second house.
- I sent a telegram.
"To William, the best man lost.
Congratulations, schmuck. Eddie."
I told the post office
"schmuck" was Latin for "love".
- What is a schmuck?
- The guy you married.
- He didn't like it.
- He's got no sense of humour.
- Do you think I have?
- Why else would you marry him?
The brother grim. Hello, William.
Welcome to Rancho Notorious.
- A family reunion.
- Quick as a flash.
- You feeling better?
- Only when I see the back of you.
- You won't have to wait long.
- What do you want?
What do brothers want brothers for,
Billy Boy?
Chew the fat, have a drink, swap old jokes.
- Did you invite him?
- He was here when I arrived.
- In my house?
- Playing your piano.
- I suppose you want money.
- When did I ever come to you for money?
- The night before my wedding.
- Oh, I needed that.
- To send me abusive telegrams.
- I used my own money for the telegram.
I used yours to go away.
- You were supposed to be my best man.
- I don't like sad occasions.
You. You don't like anything to do with responsibility or work.
- I'm working now.
- A workingman's club.
- It's not Las Vegas.
- It never will be.
Wait.
What did you come for?
You won't believe this, flimflam man, but I came to thank you for the present.
- What present?
- The present for my birthday.
The day I give you a present, pigs will fly.
That's what I meant.
Thanks for the flying pig.
Ginley.
- Ginley what?
- Ginley: Eddie.
- Wyatt: Alison. Go away.
- Take off your specs.
- Is this your mug shot?
- What's the beef, Mr Ginley?
- What's the job, Miss Wyatt?
- Job?
- Job. The gun?
- What gun?
The gun, the money, and the photo.
What are they for?
- What are you talking about?
- Three strikes you're out, Wyatt.
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at quizzes.
For Christ's sake!
This is not a debating society here.
Don't act dumb with me, lady.
Someone gave me £1,000, your photo and a gun.
Is the grand payment for knocking you off, or do I just hand the package over to you?
You better put your gun away.
People might notice.
I'll tell them
I'm studying criminology.
Don't tell me, Ginley.
Save it for the DA.
Listen, little lady, you and I better go for a walk.
Mr Ginley, while I admit that your conversation has a certain flavour which appeals very much to my taste, nevertheless, mundane as it sounds,
I have an essay to write, and I cannot spare the time to chew the fat with you.
Where can we meet?
61 Gambier Terrace, the penthouse.
Anytime after eleven.
I'll be there.
No foul-ups, Miss Wyatt.
I'm the great white hope.
It's a .38 Smith & Wesson, five-shot, walnut stock, police special.
Anything else?
They're hard to get hold of.
And they make bloody big holes.
How much'?
In Liverpool, nothing.
You might find a nutter to take it, but none of the serious lads'd touch it.
It's not a gun town, is it?
In London maybe you'd get a good price, 60, 70 quid.
- But you're not selling, are you?
- No, I was given it.
- See that? Our kid's.
- Botha.
He's done well for himself, your brother.
- One day, all this'll be mine.
- Just don't lose it.
- See you.
- See you.
Ginley, I'm his brother.
- Well?
- You sent for me.
You always have that look on your face, as though you want something but you're not letting on what it is.
Okay. I want to know what you want.
Come on.
I'm not paying a social visit.
- It was your birthday yesterday.
- You're kidding.
I suppose I ought to wish you a happy birthday.
- Don't crack yourjaw getting it out.
- Happy birthday.
- Couldn't you find anything smaller'?
- I'm trying to be nice.
- I knew you were trying something.
- Oh, just a minute.
Put it away, quick.
Go on. Get off.
- Is it his birthday, too?
- Business. This.
- Where's Beira?
Mozambique.
- They do a lot of gardening in Mozambique?
- A lot of gardening.
Anything wrong? You're smiling.
I knew it couldn't last.
- Well?
- Well.
- What's the pitch?
- I want that ad out of the paper.
- Is this the price?
- No.
- No dice.
- I want it out.
I don't like people ringing me up and making jokes about the private investigator.
If people read the advert carefully enough, they'd ring me up. It's my number.
- Take it out.
- It's still got two days to run.
Look, I don't like people ringing me up and asking for the private eye.
It's my name, too, brother.
I don't like people ringing me up with crooked deals.
- Gardening tools to Mozambique.
- You're in trouble.
- Are you telling me or asking me?
- Ellen said you were funny last night.
- I'm a comic.
- I could offer you a job.
You bought a mortuary?
- I'm trying to help you. I think you'll need it.
- Ah, leave it, William.
I take the ad out of the paper, you give me a job.
Get someone to do what you want them to, and you give 'em a break.
You were a schnook when you were a kid, and you're a schnook now you've grown up.
You've really had a go at me, haven't you?
- If that's how you wanna see it.
- Why don't you add that I married your girl?
- It takes two to make a marriage.
- It takes two to keep a marriage.
- See you, Billy.
- You don't want my present?
Keep it. It's the thought that counts.

Thank you, The Jacksons.
Now it's on with the show, and the next act, I'm sure he needs no introduction.
We're gonna have a nice little comedy spot from a very talented boy.
You all know him, so let's give a nice Broadway welcome to our own Eddie Ginley!
That's him, folks. Eddie Ginley.
His mother doesn't know he's on the stage.
She still thinks he's in prison.
- Two minutes. Longer in the second half.
- Tommy Wright, folks.
You may not remember the face, but you'll never forget the suit.
- Thank you, Tommy.
- Naughty.
Thank you.
No, but he's a great guy, great guy, and he isn't mean.
He's not mean, whatever they say.
He's just got short arms and deep pockets.
He was had up by the police recently, you know.
Found breaking into a pound note but he got off with a caution, as it was a first offence.
He fell a bit sick after that.
He went to the doctor.
Didn't know what was wrong with him, didn't feel well.
The doctor gave him a thorough examination.
He said, "It's all right.
You've only got angina of the wallet."
Now I know a good one.
Go easy, there. Take it slow.
Hello? Yes, Broadway Club.
If he started juggling with them, they were Japanese.
If they came back washed and ironed, they were Chinese.
A friend of mine went in a bar very drunk.
He went to the bar, ordered a large gin. He got the large gin, and he's running around with the large gin, drinking his gin.
Who?
He stops and he says, "Excuse me, do you serve lemons with legs in here?"
The barman said, "Get out! Get out."
He said, "Don't raise your voice.
"Get the manager."
The manager came up.
"What's this?"
"Do you serve lemons with legs in here?"
He says, "No, we don't.
Will you get out, please?"
"Well, I don't want to worry you,
"but I think I've just squeezed a canary into me drink."
More! More!
Thank you. Thank you.
Enough with the merrymaking and on with the culture.
Now we have a young lady who's done more for dancing than Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire put together, and they were never put together like her.
She fainted in here last night, and it took four men to carry her out, two a breast.
Ladies and gentlemen, the delectable Miss Melody D'Amour!
What do you think, Tommy?
Come on. It wasn't all that bad.
- I've got to see you, Eddie.
- Sure, Tommy. How do you think I did?
- Great, kid. Great. Come into the office.
- Yeah, Tom. Just let me get a cigarette.
- That was a great performance, Eddie.
- Thanks, Sammy. Thanks a lot.
Thank you. Very much.
Come in.
- Get yourself a drink, kid.
- Thanks, Tommy.
Well, what do you think?
Did you like the act?
Be with you in a minute.
"To the kid from Liverpool from the kid from Hoboken, Frank."
“Le' sham, Danny.“
- Good, aren't they?
- Good.
Do you know how
I make me money here, kid?
The bar'?
No, fruit machines. No kidding.
I'd be lost without them.
What is it, Tommy? Didn't you like the spot?
Do you want me to go back to announcing?
Your act was fine.
I always said you had it in you.
You could go right to the top.
Las Vegas, Cocoanut Grove.
This is as far as I'll get.
I'm not knocking the club, Tommy.
Don't underrate yourself, kid.
Your moment of glory will come.
My moments of glory are all in me head.
So, er... what's the pitch?
- How much a week do I pay you, son?
- Thirty.
- I'm giving you a bonus.
- What for?
Because I want to give you a bonus.
What the hell's the matter with you?
- A century. That's some bonus.
- So, I like your act.
I wish you had seen it.
What's the score, Tommy?
I want you to take a holiday.
- Where?
- Anywhere.
For how long?
Okay, Tommy.
One, two, three.
- Take the money, Eddie.
- Just me wages, Tommy.
Don't be like this, kid.
I like your act fine.
Yeah.
There are other clubs.
- I can work other clubs.
- Not now.
- It wouldn't be wise.
- Why?
Someone doesn't like you.
- And he can put people out of business.
- Who?
Can I use your phone, Tommy?
Anything, Eddie. Anything.
Anytime you want a favour.
The payphone.
I just want to call a cab.
Hello, Alison.
When did you have the operation?
If you're from the library, tell them I'll pay the fines!
Sit down. Listen to me.
It's a bit late to ask, but you sure you've got the right place?
Are those your working clothes, Mr Ginley?
Yeah, yeah, and they're paid for.
What do they call you? Entertainer'?
Is that what they call you'?
If they're being kind.
What's an entertainer doing with a gun, Mr Ginley?
I use it in the act. It helps to keep the audience on their toes.
You pulled the gun on Alison Wyatt in the library!
I heard she could tell jokes.
I thought I could use her in a double act.
Look, I'm not amused, Ginley!
No? No. Well, have you heard the one about the queer parrot?
I'd rather talk.
Do you understand? Talk!
You make me angry very well, but I'd rather talk.
Now, today in the library, I saw you.
Did the fat man send you?
What was it about?
That's easy, buster.
I'm also a private eye, see?
A girl, a gun, and a grand.
That's the world I move in, see.
I know no fat man, and you're in my flat. Get out.
- You haven't answered.
- No?
Well, that's the only answer you're getting.
On your way, Mighty Joe Young.
Mr Ginley, I can't tell you what it's about, but someone's made a mistake, and you're it.
- I said on your way.
- Look, throw the gun away, Mr Ginley.
Stick to entertaining. Stay out of it.
Okay, when did you come down from the trees?
When I saw you crawl from under a stone.
Get back amongst the bananas, fella.
You're the great white hope?
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
- Hi, kid. What kept you?
- What happened?
- Geronimo broke the treaty.
- You said you were hurt.
- I am hurt.
- Where?
- The stomach.
- Take an Alka-Seltzer.
- I got punched.
- Who by?
- Sonny Liston.
- Does it hurt?
Only when I look at you.
- Wouldn't it help if you laid down?
- If you lay down with me.
Do you want some tea?
Eddie, it's after midnight!
Look, you call me up.
You tell me you're huri. I'm worried.
I come rushing round here.
Now you look all right to me.
What do you want?
- How did you get out'?
- I opened the door.
How did you get out?
What did William say?
Did he mind you coming to see another man after midnight?
Another man he'd mind. You, no.
He thinks you're crazy.
- Anyway, he's in London on business.
- It figures.
What figures, Eddie?
Look, it's nice to see you again after all this time, and maybe we've got a lotto talk about.
So let's meet for coffee.
One morning. it's civilised.
But unless it's important, really important, don't come breaking into my home waving guns about, and don't call me out like this!
- You finished?
- Yes.
Right. I'll tell you.
You don't want these things to happen?
Okay.
Keep your husband off me back.
- What do you mean?
- I mean...
Someone told Tommy that for the continued success of his club, I had to go.
- Who would do a thing like that?
- Hitler.
- Hitler's dead.
- Wrong.
He's alive, and he's well, and he's living with you.
Oh come on, now.
Why would William do a thing like that?
Jealous of my success.
He doesn't want to see me make the Cocoanut Grove.
- One day I'll get a straight answer.
- One day you'll deserve one.
- When did this happen?
- Tonight.
But William's in London, on business.
He left by the six o'clock plane.
- He moves fast. Hit-and-run William.
- I mean he couldn't have seen Tommy.
Oh, really?
"Listen, get rid of Ginley.
It's for your own good, right?"
That's a new invention, kid.
Have you heard about it?
All this over an advert in the paper'?
That's not like William.
No? Picture the scene.
Young Eddie Ginley, eight years old, hands bleeding, sweating in the garret of a back-to-back over his violin practice.
Meanwhile, in the yard,
13-year-old William Ginley melts down Eddie Ginleys toy soldiers to sell the lead.
- So'?
- So, that was William then, and that's William now.
- I'm going home.
- Home is where your heart is.
- That's an old line.
- I'm an old fella.
You could stick around.
- Why?
- I may need a nurse in the night.
- Where?
- You could sleep in the bath.
- Is that all?
- Should there be anything else?
Okay, okay.
Just a sec.
- May I come in?
- Well, sure.
- You don't look well.
- Wait till I get me teeth in.
I'm looking for Ginley.
Ginley the private investigator.
I saw the ad and came straight over.
Oh, I'm the comedian.
The private investigator's out.
- What do you want with him?
- I have a job for him.
- Well, what kind of a job?
- A private-investigating kind of a job.
You wouldn't know where
I could find him, would you?
For a private-investigating sort of a job?
Oh, he wouldn't be interested.
He told me himself.
"Definitely no investigating," he said.
- You seem to know him awfully well.
- He's like a brother to me. it's 36 years old. I've read it five times.
This is the sixth. it helps me to plan my life.
Telephone.
"She stared at me for a long moment, and she moistened her lips before she spoke."
It'll be my road manager.
Yeah? Oh, hello.
Yeah?
Can you ring me back in five minutes?
I'm in a meeting with my road manager.
I'm being threatened.
- By whom?
- A man.
How is he threatening you?
Well, you see,
I'm a firm believer in the institution of marriage.
I like it so much I'm going to do it again, for the fifth time, the first Saturday of next month.
My husband-to-be is eminently respectable, for a change, and this man threatens to tell him I'm a bigamist.
- Tell the police.
- No. No. No. No. There would be publicity.
- If you're innocent, there's no problem.
- Blackmail scares me.
You don't look to me as if you'd scare easy.
- Appearances can be deceptive, you know.
- Indeed they can, lady.
Ginley may look competent, but he's really very stupid.
Besides which, he's on a job at the moment, and it's taking up all his time.
I can pay three times what he's getting now.
He's that expensive?
He ain't expensive, and he'd like to take the money, but as I said, he's on a job.
I'll pay any price he asks.
Is that final?
Mr Ginley is being more stupid than he knows.
That's what I keep telling him, but he won't listen to me.
He says once he starts something, he's got to finish it.
- Sorry.
- That's okay.
- Sorry I wasted my time.
- By the way,
Mrs, um...
How did you know where to find Gumshoe Ginley?
I saw the ad and came straight over.
But I didn't put my address in the advert, lady.
Hello? Oh, hello!
Yeah, I wanna talk to you, too, without King Kong around.
What time do you have?
Meet me in 30 minutes, my city office,
75 Renshaw Street, room A.
You can't miss it.
You're late, Fats.
Why did you choose this place to meet?
It's one of those old proletarian customs, lady.
You lose your job, you sign on at the dole.
You need a job?
Yesterday you had £1,000.
- It's in my numbered account.
Switzerland?
Co-op. You see, you can get it out every Saturday.
What have you done with Danny?
- Danny as in "boy," or Danny as in "Kaye"?
- Danny Azinge.
He went to see you last night.
He never came home.
The Harlem Globetrotter?
What was I supposed to do with him?
He's disappeared.
I'm asking you what you did with him.
Listen, the last time I saw him, he was leaving my room after wallpapering it with my brains.
You carry a gun.
We only met yesterday for a couple of minutes, but I thought we understood each other.
Fats, that ain't my style.
So long, Eddie.
- Polo?
- No, thanks.
- John Straker.
- Eddie Ginley.
- Glad to meet you, Eddie.
- You know my ex-friend?
- Yes.
- What did she mean'?
Don't be too hard on her, lad.
She liked you.
She took a lot of convincing that you'd worked over her boyfriend
-and locked him away.
- Me, that gorilla?
I think it's ridiculous, too, Eddie.
And that piece of paper you gave her'?
An address where she could rejoin her boyfriend.
So now you've got the two of them.
What did you want me for'?
I don't want you for anything, Eddie, or the black lad. Only the young lady.
I'm with my pal.
- It's what I want from you that counts.
- Like what?
Don't be dumb, lad.
Years since I was in a labour exchange.
It's a funny feeling.
- Cut the reminiscences, Angus.
- They said you were a comic, Eddie. Save it.
Yeah, you've come to the right place, Eddie.
Clue me in.
Because you're gonna need the money they give you.
You're gonna be £1,000 lighter after this morning.
You sure you won't have a mint?
Lad, you caused me a lot of trouble when you interfered with my work at the Plaza.
- I don't like that.
- I'll split it with you. The money's mine.
You wouldn't miss a few quid out of a grand.
Son, it's not just the money. If it was,
I wouldn't mind. It's my reputation.
I couldn't hold up my head if I was hustled out of a job by an amateur like you.
- It would not look good.
- You're a very sensitive guy, Jock.
John, Eddie, John.
I'm a hard man, son.
I don't look it, but I am.
I hurt people that upset me.
- So where's the money, Eddie?
- At my place.
I wouldn't like it if it wasn't.
Do you mind if I see a man about a job?
I've been in the same boat, son, but make it quick.
- Hello, Eddie. How are you?
- Hello, chief.
Er... can you do me a favour'?
Saw your advert in the paper touting for work.
- Not losing faith in us, are you?
- Never, chief. Could you do us a favour'?
- What is it?
- Well...
There's a guy, I owe him some money.
He's getting a bit nasty.
Bum bailiff, eh'?
- How much do you want?
- It's too much for you, chief.
I just wanted to get away from him. Could I?
- Well, it's against the regulations, Eddie.
- Break them just this once.
- I mean, if it was to come out that I let you...
- I don't even know you.
Well, for you, Eddie.
But keep going, and don't let anyone, anyone stop you.
Here, say you're from the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.
- Thanks, chief.
- Here, Eddie.
Gumshoe's the game, eh?
- Thanks.
- You bastard.
What's up, kid?
That's what I mean, you're a bastard, Eddie.
The same old story. When in trouble, send for Ellen. Shell do all your dirty work.
You know how she feels about you, so use her.
What's wrong, kid?
I don't want to get involved with your games, Eddie.
Was it something I said?
Why did you send me up for the parcel in your flat?
Well, ifs a long tale, kid.
It's a short story, Eddie.
There was a man there.
- A Scots fellow, Straken'?
- A negro.
- What did he have to say?
- He didn't say anything. He was dead.
I don't want to be around to pick up the pieces.
- The train's going.
- Yeah.
So long, Eddie.
Five foot eleven, tough as whang leather,
Eddie Ginley thought for a minute.
He needed more time.
He needed more speed.
What he didn't need was a body in his flat.
He had to break this case but fast.
He'd laid it on the line, but the lady wouldn't listen.
He had to get out of town, but the pitch was, would the lady stick around?
- He thinks we don't notice, you know.
- Why don't you stop him?
We make a note of the books and send the bill to his mother.
- You can stop pretending now.
- Come again?
These books aren't for you.
- You're not the type.
- There's a definite type?
Not what you'd think.
No black cloak and broomstick stuff.
The most respectable-looking people buy the occult.
- Do you believe in all this?
- It's a load of rubbish.
Rubbish, it's all rubbish.
I'm in the rubbish business.
- You own the place?
- He's out buying rubbish.
- You want to see him?
- When will he be back?
A couple of hours, maybe. Three.
- Are you the one who's been phoning him?
- Phoning?
Some nut's been phoning and phoning, driving me mad.
- Take the phone off the hook.
- I have.
Now, why would a nice-looking guy like you want to see him?
- Why?
- I asked first.
Business.
- You don't look as if you need it.
- I don't follow.
- Be cagey. Do I care?
Take your glasses off.
You're beautiful.
- Who shall I say called?
- Don't.
Okay.
- What's your name?
- Eddie, Fast Eddie.
- Call again, Fast Eddie.
- I will.
Any evening. About six.
- Why?
- We close then.
Besides, I blossom in the evenings.
I ...rain from the tears in my eyes

I haven't had them off since Buddy Holly died.
- Mal Conway!
- Eddie Ginley.
- Bum.
- Bum.
- Jerry Lee Lewis!
- Little Richard!
Elvis Presley!
Playing them all night, drove my mother mad!
- How long you been down here?
- Five years now.
- Why did you come'?
- Me mother sold me guitar.
- Sold her kid's guitar, eh?
- Well, I was twenty-five.
- Are you living down here now, Eddie?
- No, just on a visit.
Did you ever marry that bird?
What was her name?
- No. You?
- Married.
- Do you collect them?
- Yeah, for me lad.
Your lad, eh?
What is it?
- Police?
- Yeah, open the door.
- You don't look like the law.
- This is law enough, fella.
Okay.
Lock it.
I've only books here. No money.
Books on the occult. No novels.
- Who's downstairs?
- I'm here on me own.
Move.
Down.
- This yours?
- Looks like it.
- Is it your label or isn't it?
- Yes.
I got that in Liverpool.
How did it get there?
Did you buy it?
Did I buy it?
- Did I buy what?
- Wrapper.
- What would be in it?
- A book.
- Package.
- Of what?
- Stuff.
- W hat stuff?
- You're not the law, then?
- I'm not the law.
- What was that card you showed me, then?
- Me dole card. What was the stuff?
- I'll get you some.
- Drugs?
- Didn't you know? Honest?
- What is it?
- What is it?
- Heroin.
Who, er... who did you send it to in Liverpool? Sit down!
- Who?
- You're not gonna use that.
I don't know his name.
I just send the stuff Red Star to Lime Street.
He picks it up at the station.
I just mark it Atlantis, care of the station.
-Isn't that risky?
- Sure it's risky, but it's safer than...
- When are you sending the next lot?
- I've just come back from the station.
- I shan't be...
- I said shut up!
Silly, Eddie. Very silly.
I'm a pro.
I keep telling you.
- You stuck that spade in my flat.
- They did it.
They're not professionals.
The money. Come on!
I'll go away.
- Give me the money, I'll go away.
- I'd like to believe that.
You never bloody listen.
I've been trying to tell you.
I've not been paid for you, only for the girl.
- I got the girl, now I want the money.
- Just a job, like any other.
A thousand before, a thousand after.
- A job, a few potatoes, like the next guy.
- You make a living.
They give you a name.
You do the job. You get paid.
It's nobody you know.
- It's impersonal.
- It's not impersonal now.
- It's been a hard day for both of us.
- I said it's not impersonal now!
I know it isn't.
I know you now.
I wouldn't enjoy knocking you off, Eddie, but I would do it all the same.
-Impersonal or not.
- What a way to make a living.
- I get by.
- Get by without me.
Tell me, Eddie.
What's in this for you?
Why did you show up at the hotel?
Why are you being so obtuse?
It's the curse of the Ginleys.
We never know when we're licked.
- Can I ask you something, John?
- Anything, Eddie.
Will you take your bloody hand off me knee?
Get off! Get away from me. It's disgusting!
You come down to London for a day out.
Somebody sits next to you on the tube.
The next thing you know, he's got his hand on your thigh!
It's not going to stop here. I'm gonna write to my MP about this because...
Put the gat down, baby.
None of your business practices with me.
Webley, air pistol, just about hit a stationary bus at three feet.
You pack a mean rod, sheriff.
I didn't see you grab a phone, Willy.
Call the fuzz.
No wonder you're seeing a psychiatrist.
I'm amazed he hasn't certified you.
Now you can talk to me on equal terms.
Get your wife down here, Willy.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
The voice, William. The voice!
Ellen!
- Ellen!
- All right!
Why did you get me sacked from the club?
You refused to take that ad out of the paper.
What do you do if someone treads on your toes on the bus, Willy?
- Have his feet amputated?
- I don't travel on buses.
Ask a stupid question, you get a civil answer.
Come in. Prowl around.
Now all the family's together, we can all have tea.
- But what is this?
- Pour the tea, Ellen.
I'll fix you, Eddie.
Wherever you go, whatever you do, I'll fix you.
I said pour the tea.
Okay.
Now I'm gonna tell you a tale, William, that'll make your piggy eyes pop.
Ellen here, dear old Ellen waves me off to London with the news that there's a body in my bath.
- She told me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure. What wife wouldn't?
Now William, you'd sell cancer to a dying man, but you wouldn't plant a stiff on your own brother.
I'd get rid of it for him, though.
Don't look so surprised, Eddie.
"William helping me?"
Yes, Eddie. William helping you.
Was there really a body?
Yes, Eddie, there really was.
Ellen was terrified.
She phoned me.
Begged me to help you.
I helped.
- It cost me 200 bloody quid to get rid of it.
- Why?
Because you're my brother.
I hate every inch of your crawling frame, but you're my sodding brother.
Thanks a million.
News item number two.
A guy in London tried to kill me.
He'll have to take his place in the queue.
Like I always say, a bit of sentiment never hurt anyone.
Thanks for the tea.
Oh, er... there's still one thing
I don't understand, Inspector.
The guy who tried to kill me had followed me from Liverpool.
The only person who knew I was gonna be in London was your missus.
You're the gumshoe, Eddie.
I'm just a messenger boy, remember?
I do the dirty work.
Thanks, schmuck.
- You're all heart, Eddie.
- It runs in the family.
- Are you looking for this?
- Yeah!
Move an inch, fat man, and I'll yell "copper."
I've got a carton of junk.
- You want money?
- A name.
- What?
- Yours.
- De Fries.
- You want to be careful.
Anyone can pick up a parcel at a Red Star office.
I'll remember.
- You gave me a gun at the Plaza.
- Eddie Ginley.
Johannesburg.
You a travelling man, Mr De Fries?
- Give me the canon, Ginley.
- Soon as I have a few answers.
- Please give me the carton.
- I'll pour it down the can.
I trailed this carton to London, the Atlantis.
Straker trailed me there.
He tried to knock me off, but he didn't have the speed.
He fingered you.
The Atlantis is your connection, slim.
- How did you know I was gonna be there?
- I was told.
Only my sister-in-law knew
I was gonna be in London.
- Did she tell you?
- No.
- No, but you know her, don't you?
- We met at receptions.
- Yeah? What receptions?
- Chamber of Commerce.
- If she didn't tell you, who did?
- The others.
What others? The junk goes down the john! What others?
- Mrs Blankerscoon.
- The American dame.
- Yes, yes. Yes.
- With the phony job?
- Yeah, yeah. Where's Alison Wyatt?
- She's quite safe.
- Yeah, what do they want her for?
- To get her back to Africa.
- Her father's organising the blacks!
- Where have they taken her?
I don't know that.
- Where? Come on!
- I don't know!
Why didn't they tell you?
They suspect me. I gave you the gun.
They think I'm double-crossing them.
I swear she's safe.
Now they've got the girl, her father will give himself up.
- How do you know she's safe?
- I just know.
- Are they gonna kill her like the spade?
- He was a black who got in the way.
People get in my way every day, fat man.
I don't go around killing 'em.
The bathroom. Come on, Ginley!
They'll kill me if they even smell you've been here.
Remember, fat man,
I've got yourjunk.
- Come in.
- Here it is.
- Where did you get it?
- Easier than you think, Jacob.
Can't you do it next door'?
For God's sake, don't look, then.
Give me the ampoule.
Take the suitcases down, Clifford.
He's finished.
I want the girl at the house tonight.
- What time do we leave?
- 5:45 in the morning.
What about him?
- We're really going home?
- Yes, Jacob, we're really going home.
Now, Clifford and I are going to pack, and then we'll be right back.
You look positively beatific.
Ginley! Eddie! My old friend Eddie!
Okay, De Fries, you're going home.
- Do you know any good stories?
- Where is home? Johannesburg? A few.
Now, where's the girl being kept, and where's the house?
Come on, junk collector!
Okay, you're a musical guy.
Now, where's the girl and the house?
- Get out, Ginley! Get out!
- Come on!
- I don't need you now. I'm going home.
- Come on!
Echo? Give me the news desk.
Now listen, I'll say this once and once only, right?
8 Bedford Street, Liverpool.
Bedford Street!
I saw a guy murdered, yeah.
Yeah, he was an addict. A drug addict.
But I think it was pure heroin that killed him.
- We're closed!
- Is that your coat?
- Yeah.
- Put it on.
- Who are you?
- Board of Trade.
- Well, what do you want?
- We have powers of search.
You d0n't look like the Board of Trade to me.
We're changing the image.
Would you sit down, please?
Wait, you've got something in your eye.
No, don't touch it. Don't touch it.
Leave it to me, relax.
Close your eyes.
- I'm Anne Scott.
- I'm all shook up.
- What's your name?
Modelling. Clay Modelling.
- I don't think I fancy you, Modelling.
- Work on it.
- I like tall men.
- Well, the seven dwarves got Snow White.
- Only because they crowded her.
- You could go on your knees for me.
- On this floor?
- I'll put a cushion down.
- I couldn't.
- Why not'?
I stoop to conquer. I don't kneel.
- Mrs Blankerscoon?
- N0t expected.
- Where can I find her?
-49 Faulkner Square.
- Does she live there?
- Yes, but not for long.
- How some?
- She's leaving tomorrow.
- What time?
- Seven AM.
- How?
- Boat. Huskisson's Dock.
- You're a Londoner?
- You're a bright kid, Modelling.
What are you doing up here?
Old story. With a dancing troupe, manager cleared off with the money.
- I was stranded.
- In Liverpool?
In Liverpool. That's how
I got the job in this office.
Don't be embarrassed when we're out together. I could walk behind you.
- Oh, no.
- Why not?
- I like to hold hands in the street.
- So?
So, I'd feel like
I was taking you out for a walk.
- Defy convention.
- I'm basically Conservative.
- Switch sides.
- I'd rather fight than switch.
Hello, Tommy?
It's your ex-bingo caller.
Can I see you? I need that favour.
I got a little problem here.
I can't tell you now.
Your phone might be tapped.
At the Copacabana.
- So, you'd rather fight?
- Honestly.
- What weight are you?
- Bantam.
- I'm heavy.
- You've got the weight. I've got the speed.
I sometimes hit below the belt.
Hello, kid. Yeah.
Can I see you now?
Meet me at the club, okay?
- Hit below the belt, do you?
- And I've got a long reach.
- That's no good in a clinch.
- Keep your guard up, don't lead with your chin and keep throwing out those lefts.
- What for?
- You could get a crack at the title.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a heap like this?
- A heap like this costs £2,175 with extras.
- You sound like your husband.
They say married couples get to look alike.
I didn't know they got to think alike.
- You don't crack gags anymore, Eddie.
- I'm sorry. Say something funny.
All right. Let's run away together.
- Where?
- Anywhere, London.
- When?
- Now.
- To do what?
- You could get a job.
- Ex-comic, unskilled. You?
- I could cook, sew.
- And bring up expensive cars.
- I've got money.
- Well, we're not married.
- Do we have to be?
- I'm old-fashioned.
- Defy convention.
I just said that to somebody.
Okay, Eddie, I'll lay it on the line.
William ships guns to Africa.
Yeah, yeah.
Gardening tools to Rhodesia.
Parts for cars, chemicals, anything they want.
- It makes him a lot of money.
- So tell me something new.
Have I told you lately that I love you?
A girl was snatched, Alison Wyatt.
The night I turned up at your house with a gun,
I got sicced into it.
I don't know why.
The spade you found in my flat dead, he's her boyfriend-bodyguard.
She's wanted back in South Africa to flush her old man out of the bush.
They're shipping her out.
Guess who's boxing her up?
Is this the old-style, live-for-today
Eddie Ginley I'm listening to?
No, baby, it's the new style, weary-wary "what's all this crap about running off together," slow Eddie Ginley you're hearing.
Eddie! Come here.
What about that one, then?
There's a good 'un.
Has nobody ever noticed that you're always wearing the same suit in these photographs, and the stars all seem to write with the same biro?
- An old man's fantasies, Eddie.
- You're 42.
In the club game, you can multiply that by three.
- What's the favour'?
- A couple.
- First one?
-49 Faulkner Square.
- Well?
- Tell me about it.
Housebreaking, Eddie?
- Second favour?
- When I know about the house.
- A phone call.
- I'll be in the bar.
See ya.
I used to wonder why a great-looking chick like you used to hang around a small-time guy like me.
That's why I treated you badly, I guess.
I couldn't figure the angle.
- Couldn't you?
- No.
Perhaps I hung around you because I liked you.
I saw him die, Ellen.
I saw a lady, ever so much a lady, pump him so full ofjunk, it killed.
Junk?
The same lady had a guy killed in my flat.
She also snatched a girl.
Now, where do you fit in?
For God's sake,
William's in business with them.
I meet them at trade receptions.
I'll take you along sometime.
They hold receptions for sanctions busters?
Whatever next?
It's trouble, Eddie.
You could get hurt.
I've got ten more instalments to pay before I own my hi-fi.
I want to be around to finish paying them.
Besides, I got a lot of speed, and I want to use it.
Okay, lads and lasses, there's tea and cakes at the back of the hall.
Bingo in ten minutes' time.
Wait there.
- It's okay?
- Nothing known, Eddie. Just a rented house.
None of the lads I know have knocked it over.
- Thanks, Tommy.
- Of course, now I've mentioned it,
- I bet there'll be a queue there tonight.
- Don't join it.
- Second favour?
- A car and a driver.
- That address?
- Yeah.
To pipe or rumble?
Joey, he's muscle.
- He fought Rommel, and Rommel lost.
- There are people in the house I want.
- You want to get in, or you want them out?
- Them out, don't care how.
- Got a lighter?
- Zippo.
When do you want him?
My clients are catching the boat at seven in the morning, so say five thirty.
- You want Joey at five thirty in the morning?
- Can you keep him awake?
- For you, Eddie, he'll wear his tin hat.
- You shoot good pool, Tommy.
- What do you want with me, Eddie?
- I want you to give a message.
Tell Mrs Blankerscoon the comids taken a backseat.
The private investigator's back in business.
She'll understand.
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't act dumb, kid. It's too late.
For "Eddie".
-"E" for "Enough", which is what I've had.
- Hello, Eddie. Tommy said you needed help.
- Ta.
- Put the car around the side by the alley.
- Right.
Emergency fire service?
Hello, fire service? I want to report a fire at 49 Faulkner Square.
49 Faulkner Square!
No, it's not my house!
I was just passing by, and I saw it!
You better be quick!
- What was it like fighting Rommel, Joey?
- Personally, Eddie, I never seen the bugger.
Seen James Mason take him off in a film once.
Couldn't stand it.
All them good Germans.
- I've never been since.
- No.
- Wouldn't going in be simpler?
- There's too many of them in there.
- Why don't we wait while they come out?
- I want them on me own terms.
There's no lights on.
Maybe they've gone already.
Baseman Two Zero in attendance at 49 Faulkner Square. Over.
Message begins for 49 Faulkner Square.
False alarm, malicious.
Rescind that previous message!
Explosion with...
Jesus Christ!
Don't let anybody out of the alley, Joey.
Okay, Joey, move your heap!
Okay, Clifford, get going.
We haven't got much time if we want to get the boat.
- Do you want a lead earring, Clifford?
- Don't panic, Clifford.
- What do you want, Eddie?
- Alison.
You're a lunatic, Eddie.
Yeah, but I'm covered.
I've got a psychiatric record.
- How about you?
- Have I got a psychiatric record?
You should have.
You murdered De Fries. I saw you.
I saw you fill that billiard ball so full of junk he rolled into the pocket and stayed there.
He was cracking up.
He gave you that package at the hotel with the gun.
- We didn't want the girl killed. It was wrong.
- And killing him was right?
Telling the newspapers was also wrong, Eddie.
Lady, I phoned the papers about De Fries, but I didn't phone myself to go to the Plaza.
- So who else is wrong?
- I've been wondering that myself.
Where did your wondering get you, lady?
It got me to the conclusion that I don't care.
It's none of your business.
I don't know how you got into this, but now you're getting out.
- I'm calling the police.
- None of my business?
Oh, Eddie, who'll listen?
You saw an addict kill himself.
I saw Mrs Blankerscoon, brunette,
Caucasian, murder Jacob De Fries.
And you didn't report it?
That's an accessory after the fact.
You're wasting your time, Eddie.
- Okay, Alison, we're getting out.
- No, Eddie, I'm going home.
I think my ears are on the blink, Fats.
- I'm going home, Eddie.
- With this lot?
- I live there, too.
- So, what are you gonna do?
Do you think they're gonna let you join your father in the bush?
- They've caught him.
- So, they've caught him.
- We've caught her.
- What do you reckon on, Eddie?
To do a swap?
What happens if we turn them in here?
The consulate would have her sprung in seconds flat, apologies all around.
The fight's not here, Eddie.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Your pal Azinge, what about him?
- You've got no shots left to call.
- So?
- How would you like to come with us?
- What for?
Name it.
- Lady, you haven't got it to give.
- Money, cars, a nice house?
- Women?
- The woman, Eddie.
It's a good offer. Take it.
- The alternative?
- None.
A dead addict, anonymous phone calls.
You're unemployed, Eddie.
Where's your pull'?
- That's how it is, brother.
- An ex-comic.
- A gone Ginley.
- Precisely.
So, what's it to be?
I'm gonna need help.
You got me into this, kid.
- What do you mean?
- Come on.
You made the call that brought me to the hotel.
I was scared. I didn't know what they were gonna do to the girl!
I thought they'd call it off if it was a mess-up!
So Eddie was to be the grit in the wheels.
William was in it for the business, but the girl, 0h no.
No, that was something else.
You took me, kid.
The more I thought about it, the more it had to be you on the phone.
- I didn't like fooling you.
Really? I loved it.
It was about as funny as a hole in a lifeboat.
So I'm the fall guy.
I get out of the car, go home and that's the end of it.
You've got to take the offer, Eddie.
You can't go home.
There's a body in your flat.
Didn't he tell you, lady?
Tell her, brother.
Tell her how you cleared up the cadaver.
She'll enjoy it.
Stop the car, Clifford.
Okay, lady, now I'm gonna tell you something.
All that you've done you shouldn't have done to me.
But most of all, you shouldn't have done it to anyone.
And you can talk yourself out of that one when the cops get here.
As for you, Joan of Arc, you wanna fight? Get on a plane.
They leave every day.
Cup of tea?
I heard you coming up the stair.
Sugar'?
All right, I'll marry you.
I could have been arrested.
- I'd have spoken up for you.
- Where's the money, Eddie?
Down at the cop-shop.
Oh, dear me.
Iturned them all in, John.
What are you gonna do?
Get your gun out?
- Lean on me?
- What gun?
- How did you expect to get the money?
- Threaten you.
With what?
Violence of the tongue.
How come they picked a tough guy like you to snatch the girl?
They didn't.
They picked a guy that fell ill.
I took his place.
By God, Eddie, there's some dodgy people about these days.
What a crummy outfit.
What a damned crummy ramshackle outfit they were.
Gumshoe Ginley and Slyboots Straker.
I'm not so hot, but you're terrible.
I try, Eddie.
- So, you've no money on you then?
- Not a bean.
So you couldn't lend us a couple of quid, eh?
I'm on the dole, you bum!
You absolute Scotch bum!
- You're a good lad, Eddie.
- Get out.
Go on, get out.
If the fuzz ask,
I've never heard of you.
Gumshoe.
Here's looking at you, kid.

Dr. Grayson was never in London at the time of the murder.
In fact, the good doctor stayed in a small hotel in Melksham on the night in question.
He then returned to Broughton Gifford on the 2:40 train... disguised as Sir Mortimer turret's Valet, Burton, making sure his arrival was noted by the ticket inspector.
From then on, his plan was simplicity itself.
Knowing it was Burton's day off, he had no difficulty in entering Hellrake Hall unobserved...
And murdering Sir Mortimer with the arrow from the astrolabe... which he had sharpened on the stone knife grinder by the scullery window.
"Remember my query about brass knives at the time?
I was worried about those metal shavings. "
"By jove, Lord Merridew, sir,
"You don't miss a trick.
But since you appear to know so much, sir," continued the inspector humbly,
"I wonder if you would explain how the murderer managed to leave the body of his victim...
"in the middle of the tennis court and effect his escape...
"without leaving any tracks behind him in the red dust.
Frankly, sir, we in the Police
Force are just plain baffled. "
St. John Lord Merridew, the great detective, rose majestically, his huge Father Christmas face glowing with mischievous delight.
Slowly, he brushed the crumbs of seedy cake... from the folds of his pendulous waistcoat.
"The Police may be baffled,
Inspector," he boomed,
"But Merridew is not.
"Thirty years ago, the murderer, Dr. Grayson, was a prominent member of the Ballets Russes, dancing under the name of Oleg Graysinski.
And though the years had altered his appearance somewhat, yet his old skill had not deserted him.
He carried the body to the center of the court, walking on his points... along the white tape which separated the service boxes, and from there... he threw it seven feet into the court, close to the baseline where it was found.
And then, with a neatly executed fouetté, he faced about and went back the way he had come, thus leaving no traces.
And that, Inspector, is
Merridew's solution. "
Hello!
Are you there?
Mr. Wyke?
- Mr. Wyke?
- Who's there?
It's me, Milo Tindle.
I think you're expecting me.
Yes, indeed. So good of you to come.
Won't you join me?
Well, I have been trying to do exactly that for quite some time.
Here we are.
Yes, my outdoor inner sanctum.
I designed it myself.
Provides for me just that extra bit of privacy that an author requires.
I must say, you're not an easy man to drop in on.
Just so. So, you're Milo Tindle.
- I'm Andrew Wyke. Welcome to Cloak Manor.
- Thank you.
I found your note when I came down from London this afternoon.
Oh, good. Yes.
I hoped you'd be here this weekend, so I pushed it through your letter box a little earlier today.
Well, now, what will you have to drink?
- Uh, vodka and tonic, please.
- Ah. Of course.
- How are you settling in here at laundry cottage?
- Very well, thank you.
Using it for weekends, that sort of thing?
Yes, that sort of thing.
Vodka- I don't seem to have any out here. Is-
- Gin will do.
- Good.
Charming little place,
Laundry cottage-
Ideal for relaxations of all kinds.
Unfortunately, I don't have time for them myself.
As a matter of fact, I've just dictated the denouement... of my new book,
‘Death by double fault. ’
I must say, it's gone extremely well.
Ah, then.
Soda, soda, soda, soda-
Oh, dear. Doesn't seem to be any tonic here either.
It's awful.
Here, shall we go indoors?
- Whatever you like.
- Good.
Tell me, do you agree that the detective story is... the normal recreation of noble minds?
I'm afraid I don't know very much about noble minds.
- Is it supposed to be?
- I'm quoting from Philip Guedalla, a biographer of the '30s, the golden age when every Cabinet Minister had a thriller by his bedside, and all detectives were titled.
- Before your time, I expect.
- Somewhat. Let me carry that.
Oh, thank you so much. Very good of you.
Yet, you know, even today, I still set my works among the gentry, and a great many ordinary people seem to enjoy them in spite of our classless society.
I imagine they do a great deal of your stuff on television.
Oh, God forbid. I'd never permit it.
And, uh, incidentally, it's not "stuff. " No.
Television's not my line of country at all.
That's detective fact, not detective fiction.
And, therefore, no recreation for noble minds?
You have it in a nutshell, my dear Milo, if I may so address you.
Oh, you might as well. We're all on first-name terms these days, Andrew.
Of course we are. And you and I do need to be friendly, do we not?
How do you like your drink- with ice?
With ice?
Uh, yes, please.
What does he do?
Oh, that's Jolly Jack Tar, the jovial sailor.
He and I have a really splendid relationship.
I make the jokes, and he laughs at them.
Here, mein Freund. Put that behind your necktie.
- He didn't laugh.
- No, he wasn't meant to.
- I thought you were trying to be funny.
- You'll know it when I am.
- I see. Cheers.
- Prost.
- What's this?
- That is an intensely complicated... fourth dynasty blocking game called Senat.
I've been studying the thing for months, but I'm still only a beginner.
I wonder if you'd mind putting that back. It's taken me rather a long time to get it there.
The center column, fourth from your right.
Well, now,
I understand you want to marry my wife.
Forgive me raising the matter, but as
Marguerite is away for a few days in the north... visiting relatives, I thought this might be an appropriate moment... for you and me to have a little chat.
- I see.
- Well, uh, is it true?
Yes. With your permission, of course.
Why not? You seem to be a personable enough young man- nicely spoken, neatly dressed in brand-new country gentleman's clothing.
I'm sure you won't mind me asking you a few questions about your background- parents and so forth.
My mother was born in Hereford, a farmer's daughter,
And my father is an Italian who came to this country in the '30s from Genoa.
- In the '30s. Jewish?
- No, catholic- very devout.
Of course, I'm not religious at all myself.
My dear boy, you don't have to excuse yourself to me. We're all liberals here.
I have no prejudice against catholics,
Not even lapsed catholics.
In fact, some of my best friends are lapsed catholics.
But tell me about your father.
Was his name Tindle too?
No, his name was Tindolini.
But if you had a name like that in those days, you had to make-a de ice cream-a.
He was a watchmaker, and he wanted us to become
English, so he changed it.
"Become" English.
Was he a successful man?
No. As a matter of fact, he wasn't.
You can't expect to make a living these days just repairing watches.
He went broke in the end.
I always told him he would.
Hmm. Well, it must make him something of a burden to you.
Yeah, it-it does a bit.
He never went back, you see.
He's still in Soho, still thinks he had it good all those years.
And you- what do you do?
Don't you know?
I have a hairdressing salon in South
Kensington- Casa tindolini.
Oh, you can use that word these days, can you?
People don't take it for an ice-cream salon?
- No, the birds- the ladies seem to like the continental touch.
English too wholesome for them, eh?
Yeah, well, it's- it's not chic, you see.
We found that it pays to provide the latin lover atmosphere.
Of course, we lay it on a bit thicker in the
Brighton shop. They're less sophisticated.
I mean to say, in London half of them have actually got- latin lovers?
And where do you live- above, behind or below your shop?
I lease a mews house nearby.
It's convenient and attractive.
It's Georgian, actually.
From Genoa to Georgian in a single generation, eh? Not bad.
But I doubt whether an 18th century architectural gem in South Kensington... whispers quite the same magic to Marguerite as it does to you.
She adores old houses.
She can't wait to live in it.
I understood she already was living in it, once or twice a week at least.
I'm not mistaken, am I?
And that your motive in renting the cottage down here was to increase the incidence... of this biweekly coupling.
- Is that what you asked me over here to chat about?
Never speak ill of the deadly.
If I choose to say that my wife converses like a child of six... and makes love like an extinct shellfish, I shall, and I don't need to ask her lover's permission to do so either.
- Thank you for the drink.
- Oh, my. Now, now, I thought you were brought up in England.
Surely you know it's not done to be rude.
You were being rude about a woman I'm in love with.
- On the contrary. I was reminiscing about my wife.
- It comes to the same thing.
Things mostly do, you know. I'll wager that in a year's time... it'll be you who'll be being rude about
Marguerite and I who'll be being rhapsodic, having quite forgotten how intolerably tiresome, vain, spendthrift, self-indulgent... and generally bloody crafty she really is!
Can you afford to take her off my hands?
- "Afford to"?
- Support her in the style to which she was not accustomed... before she met me, but now is.
Well, I'm not a millionaire, but I'm not starving either.
The shop in London's doing all right. The one in Brighton is almost breaking even.
- By this time next year-
- This year, next year, sometime, never.
What you're really saying is that at present, you're skint.
- We'll survive.
- Survival is scarcely the point.
Presumably, when you're married to
Marguerite, you'll want a place on the Riviera, fast car, couple of mistresses.
- "Presumably"?
- Just because you need those things?
- No, just this fading mansion, the slowest Bentley in Wiltshire, and only one mistress, I'm afraid.
Tea, the Finnish bird who runs the sauna in Salisbury.
Oh, you know about Tea, do you?
Marguerite and I have no secrets from each other.
Not even mine, it seems.
Tea is a Karelian Goddess.
Her golden hair smells of pine, and her cobalt eyes are the secret forest pools of Finlandia.
I hear she's a well-scrubbed blonde with all the sex appeal of a secondhand jeep.
Not so, dear boy. You can take it from me.
Tea is an engaging little trollop and suits me mightily.
Mind you, she takes a bit of keeping up with.
It's a good thing I am pretty much of an olympic sexual athlete.
Yes, I suppose these days you are concentrating more on the sprints... than on the long-distance stuff.
Not so, dear boy.
I'm in the pink of condition.
I could copulate for England at any distance.
Red.
Well, as they say in the Olympics, it's not the winning, it's the taking part that counts.
- Are you going to marry her?
- Oh, no, no, no. I just want to live with her.
- So what's stopping you?
- Basically the firm of Prurien and Pry, Itd.,
Whom you and Marguerite have seen fit to employ.
Don't be so innocent.
Those nicotine-stained private detectives have been camping outside Tea's for the last week.
It was an insurance policy to keep you from changing your mind about the divorce.
- How do you know I wasn't having you watched, hmm?
- Why not?
Afraid of what you might find out?
Or didn't you think that was possible?
Now, don't start doing a fertility dance.
Of course I knew they'd find you and
Marguerite rutting away like crazed weasels.
But why should I pay good money to have something confirmed which I'd known for months?
- Black.
- Then if you knew, why didn't you do something about it?
I had to assure myself that you and
Marguerite were going to be a fixture.
You see, I want to lose the dear girl for life, not just... a two-week Tindolini perm, set and touch-up.
- Good shot.
- Yes, it was. Yellow.
You see, you don't know her as well as
I do. You think you do, but you don't.
If you fail her, by which I mean cancelling the account at Harrod's... or shortchanging her on winters in Jamaica,
She'll be back to me in a jiffy, mewing for support.
And, guilty wife or no, she may be entitled to get it.
- Green.
- Money isn't everything.
And what if she is used to luxury? Whose fault is that?
It's not a fault if you can afford it.
But can you?
Knowing you to be hard up- brown- has she shown any signs of mending her ways... in these last, idyllic three months?
Blue. When, for instance, did she last turn down Dom Perignon in favor of- no offense, mind you- the persuasive charms of Dago Red?
Black.
No, I'm not joking. How much has this brief liaison cost you so far?
And that old Dad of yours in Soho- when did you last send him any money?
We have talked about money.
Often I've told her we spend too much.
- She takes no notice?
- No.
Silvery laugh.
Coquettish turn of the head.
Something like that.
Well, it's to solve this little problem that I've invited you here tonight.
And this, as they say, is where the plot thickens.
What plot?
Whatever are you doing with that cue in your hand?
I was waiting for you to miss.
Foolish boy.
Once upon a time, my dear Milo, there was an Englishman called Andrew Wyke, who, in common with most of his countrymen, was virtually castrated by taxation.
To avoid total emasculation, his accountants advised him...
To put a considerable part of his money, some 250,000 pounds, into jewelry.
His wife, of course, was delighted.
- Marguerite never told me you'd given her any jewelry.
- Oh, nor did I, of course.
It's still mine, as well she knows.
We just thought it would be more amusing for her to wear it than for me to bank it.
After all, it's fully insured.
I see what you mean by the plot thickening.
I'm glad you follow me so readily. You see, I want you to steal that jewelry.
Tonight, for choice. With Marguerite away, it's an admirable opportunity.
- What about the servants?
- I've sent Mr. And Mrs. Hawkins away to the seaside... for a 48-hour paddle- they won't be back till Sunday night.
So, you see, the house is empty.
Cheers.
- Well, what do you say?
- It sounds distinctly criminal.
Well, of course it's criminal! All good moneymaking schemes in England have to be these days.
Now, the jewelry, when it's not in the bank, lives in an ingeniously hidden safe somewhere here in the study.
Where, for instance, would you look for it?
Good likeness, would you say?
Of course, it's 17- no, 18 years ago.
I don't think you'd hide your safe behind it. I've seen that in too many movies.
Good thinking! All right then, where?
Are you up to finding it?
There are certain skills best acquired in public bars, I suppose, but whatever made you think, hmm?
- You and your games.
That is the only game in this room.
Hmm. Very clever.
Anyway, the jewels are in there.
All you have to do is steal them,
Sell them abroad and live happily ever after with Marguerite.
All I have to do is claim the insurance and live happily ever after with Tea.
Is that what you asked me over to hear-
A grotty little plot to defraud the insurance company?
I'm sorry you find the plot grotty.
Personally, I thought it was all rather nicely clear and simple.
Look, supposing I do as you say and nick- uh, steal the jewels.
If I sell them under my own name, I'll get picked up the moment you report the loss.
If I sell them to a fence, always presuming I could find one,
He'd carve me up, I'd get a fraction of their value.
- Not with the fences I know.
- What fences would you know?
The finest in Europe-
Prudent, yet prodigal.
I first met them while I was researching for the deadly affair of the Druce Diamond.
Surely you've read it.
Pity. An absolute corker.
In any case, on your behalf,
I have already contacted a certain gentleman in Amsterdam.
He'll treat you very well. You won't get the full amount for the jewels, of course, but you'll get about two thirds, say,
170,000 pounds.
- You'll get it in cash.
- 170,000 quid?
Cash.
Why should this fellow pay so much?
Because he will get what no fence ever gets- the title to the jewels.
You see, in addition to stealing the jewels, you have also to take the receipts I got for them.
Now, what does my insurance company discover as it swings ponderously into action, antennae pulsing with suspicion?
It discovers that someone impersonating Andrew Wyke... sold the jewels for 170,000 pounds cash, but they still have to pay me.
Hard cheese.
Think it over. Take your time.
Look, I know this sounds stupid, but, have you had any experience-
I mean, have you ever, actually, committed a crime before?
St. John Lord Merridew would have a pretty lean time of it... if I didn't think up any crimes for him to solve.
St. John Lord who?
- You're joking.
- What about?
Who is St. John Lord Merridew?
Why, even Marguerite when I first met her knew and adored him.
He's my detective, known to millions throughout the civilized world... with a nose for smelling out evil superior to anything in the Force.
Oh, yes. The Police are always stupid in the kind of books you write, aren't they?
They never solve anything. It's always the amateur sleuth who knows what's going on.
But that's detective fiction.
This is fact. This is real.
I'm well aware of the difference, my dear Milo, but I'm also aware of my own not inconsiderable capabilities.
Of course, if you doubt them or don't trust me-
I'm not sure that I do.
That's why it's a very difficult decision to make.
Not at all difficult, perfectly simple.
You have an expensive woman and no money.
Yeah, but why don't you steal the bloody jewels and simply hand them over to me?
I should have thought that was obvious.
The burglary has to look real.
This house has actually to be broken into.
Then why don't you break into it?
It's a question of agility for one thing, dear boy.
Milo, baby, hey, do me a favor.
Let me handle this. Know what I mean?
Crime is my bag. I got this caper all worked out to the last detail.
170,000 pounds.
Cash, tax-free.
It would take an awful lot of Tindolini's tonsorial teasing to raise that kind of money.
All right. I'll do it.
- Where do you want me to break in?
- No, no, no, no. Not so fast.
You've got to get disguised first.
- What for?
- What if somebody saw you climbing in?
Here? In the middle of nowhere?
I could hardly find this place with a bloody map!
You never know!
A dallying couple, a passing sheep rapist.
Besides, don't forget the clues we've got to leave for the Police and insurance company.
We don't want your footsteps in the flower beds...
Or your coat button snagged on the window sill.
No, no, no! You must be disguised!
All right. How?
Please to follow me, number one son.
You know, my dear Milo, in the good old days, before television, that is,
People constructed the pleasures of life for themselves.
They amused each other and were in turn amused.
They didn't just sit, stare.
Why, in this house there was scarcely a weekend... without its treasure hunts, charades, games of infinite variety.
Makeup and dress up- there was virtually no end to the concealment of identity.
- But surely Marguerite has told you.
- Actually she never mentioned it.
Well, it was all some time ago.
Aha! A few scenes from some of my books, lovingly recreated by an artist friend.
The necrophilic barber of Tunbridge Wells, and the doltish pie poisoner from the Simple Simon murders.
Oh! And here's my favorite.
- Now, this really is ingenious. Do look-
- Andrew, we were looking for a disguise.
Ah, quite so, dear boy. So we were.
Ah, here we are.
The old dressing-up basket, our old treasure chest of make-believe.
Let's see what we've got.
Ah, this should suit.
Item- one black face mask, one black flat cap, a striped jersey and a bag marked "swag. "
Why not a neon sign with "burglar" on it?
You may have a point. One of my favorites!
The ecclesiastical housebreaker,
Brother Lightfingers.
Perhaps we shall never know the identity of the cowled figure... seen haunting the grounds of the old manor house on the night of the terrible murder, if living identity it had.
And there are those to this day who claim to hear the agonized screams... of the victim echoing through the chimney ports!
For Christ's sake, Andrew, stop mucking about!
Haven't you just got an old pair of sneakers, a raincoat and a sock I can put over my head?
Old pair of sneakers and a sock?
Milo, where's your sense of style?
We must give our crime the true sparkle of the '30s, a little amateur aristocratic quirkiness.
Don't you feel the need to give your old archenemy, Inspector Plodder of the Yard, a run for his money?
Monsieur Beaucaire!
Milo, this is you!
A full-bottomed wig, lots of beauty spots, and all the snuff you could want.
Oh, groovy!
Look. I might even do the whole thing in drag.
Kiss me, you fool.
I can fight it no longer, Darling.
If you must go, don't look back.
Andrew-
Jesus Christ! Who's that?
So that's where you've been, auntie Maude. Naughty girl.
Shall we decide on the dress then?
- No, I don't like it.
- Oh, well, you are a choosy one, aren't you?
There doesn't seem to be a very great deal left.
We'll just have to settle for Joey.
Joey!
Now you're talking. A clown!
Can't you see it all- the sawdust ring, the tinsel, the glitter, the lights?
The elephants, the high wire, the roar of the crowd.
Merry Milo Tindle, the kiddies' delight!
- This is all right.
- Off with your jacket!
- That's right. Your shirt and your trousers.
- What for?
Oh, we don't want the Police to find any fibers from this beautiful cloth.
You've no idea how clever they are in those laboratories of theirs.
- We won't take any risks, you and I.
- That's right.
Down to your smalls. Don't be shy.
I know a well brought-up boy when I see one!
Folds his trousers at night!
170,000 pounds
tax-a-free cash
Eccomilo
Eccomilo
Hey! Slap shoes!
Do you know, I've always wanted a pair of these, ever since my father took me to the Palladium when I was a kid.
I might have got on in show business, you know. You never know.
A lot of my friends did. They got to the top. You know how?
They danced their way in.
Danced their way in.
You know, I guess that vaudeville's loss was hairdressing's gain.
- Talking of gain, are we ready?
- Yes!
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!
The Grand Parade!
Make way for Tindolini,
The kiddies' favorite!
Crazier than Kelly!
Greater than Grock!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, in the center ring,
The king of the clowns,
Milo, the merry madcap!
- He thinks I'm funny!
- Oh, you are funny.
Turn it off!
Now, then. One glass cutter for breaking in with.
One piece of putty for holding on to the piece of glass so it doesn't clatter to the ground... and awake the ravenous Doberman Pinscher you suspect lurks inside.
- And one stethoscope.
- Stethoscope?
Safebreakers, for the use of. The theory is, you tried to pick the lock of the safe...
By listening to the tumblers- you failed and had to resort to dynamite.
- Dynamite? What for?
- Safes, for the blowing open of. But leave that to me.
Now, how about a bizarre touch? A tear-drenched pom-pom impaled upon a splinter of glass?
Why not take a full-page ad in the Times...
And sell tickets for the cops to come and watch?
Pom-poms. I was only trying to lighten
Inspector Plodder's day for him, but if you don't like- - There is no such animal as Inspector Plodder... outside your detective stories!
It'll probably be some sharp-eyed bloke who knows his job down to the last detail!
You can bet your bottom dollar on that!
And I can't move in this outfit!
These bloody boots are ridiculous!
But you loved them so! Do keep them on!
Can't you see the headlines?
"Wiltshire paralyzed, Police baffled.
Where will Big Boot strike next?"
Right in the ass, that's where- mine.
All those boots will tell the police is that a true professional, realizing that the flower beds would carry footprints, decided to disguise his own.
Now, do come along.
Now, have you got everything?
- Glass cutter, putty...
- Yes, yes, yes.
- And the stethoscope?
- I've got everything.
Oh, Milo, you are marvelous.
- You are the complete clown.
- Thank you.
Very clever!
Now, come along with me and listen carefully.
Go around the house to your left, and cross the lawn diagonally.
In the far corner you'll find a shed.
In the shed you'll find a ladder.
Bring it back here and lean it up against the great window in the main room... so that you can break in on the upper landing- understanding?
- Upperlanding?
- Yes.
I suppose you couldn't come and hold the ladder steady for me, could you?
Certainly not. I don't want my footprints in the flower beds.
- I'm not very good at heights.
- Well, don't look down.
Concentrate instead on thick bundles of crisp pound notes,
170,000 of them, in cash, tax-free.
Good luck, partner.
- Don't forget your gloves.
- What a way to make a living.
Puss, Puss, Puss.
Did you hear a noise, Puss, hmm?
Was that a footstep in the garden?
No, no. I must be mistaken.
There it is again.
What's that?
Somebody outside, prowling around the grounds, I'm certain of it.
Now, now, now. We mustn't imagine things.
Who would harm a kindly old spinster like me?
The front door's locked and the windows too.
Aye, no one could possibly break into our snug little home.
For Christ's sake, Milo! They couldn't have made more noise on D-Day!
The bloody glass came out, me bloody boot got stuck, and I fell down the bloody ladder!
Well, the bloody Police must have heard it all the way to bloody Salisbury!
I'm sorry!
Somehow I thought you'd be better than that at climbing ladders.
- Now for the jewels.
- Oh, not straightaway.
You're not supposed to know where they are.
You have to hunt about a bit first.
Disturb a few things. If you'd be good enough to follow me, Miss Rebecca.
A turnstile into the bedrooms?
One way or another, one always pays to get in.
The Mistress's bedroom- or would you know your way about?
- The Mistress or her bedroom?
- It's irrelevant.
Now, Milo, where to begin, hmm?
The bottom drawer, the trousseau drawer?
Ah, the frillies!
Take 'em out! Vandalize them!
Come on, Milo. You're a burglar, not a Lady's maid.
Don't pack them. Ravage them!
Come on, Milo!
Oh, excellent. Now tear that.
That's better!
Now, where would Milady hide the trophies of her skilled accomplishments, hmm?
Her rubies, emeralds, diamonds, sapphires...
Interleaved among her lace-edged underclothes,
Stuffed into the false bottoms of hat boxes,
Sewn into the hems of always the latest, had-to-have, at-once-discarded Parisian dresses.
Or perhaps secretly... concealed in the back of this.
What better safe deposit for deceit, hmm?
How often has it reflected the bright eyes that betray?
The mouth that lied and kissed and lied again!
I thought it was me who was supposed to be doing the ravaging.
So it was, so it was.
Merely demonstrating, I was.
- Be a good fellow. Stamp on that, will you?
- Why me?
I'm afraid if I broke it, I'd get seven more years of Marguerite.
Thank you.
- Now where's your bedroom?
- M-mine?
- It's my turn to demonstrate.
- Oh, my dear Milo.
Having failed to find the jewels among the Lady's personal possessions-
Be a bit suspicious- a professional burglar playing favorites.
On the contrary. An intelligent burglar would immediately look... for the next-most-likely hiding place.
- Which is where?
The inevitable safe. Just blow it open and steal what's in it.
Come on, Milo.
Right.
- What kind of charge you got here?
- Oh, enough for the job.
I learned about explosives for the
Diary of the Dynamited Duchess.
Ready? Stand by for the countdown.
Five, a-four, a- three, a-two, a-one, a- blastoff.
I've got it. I've got it!
What are you shaking it for?
It's a jewel box, not a maraca.
I thought it might have a secret catch. It's locked, you see.
Well, smash it open! Jesus, you have all the killer instinct... of a 20-year old seal'yham. - It's a very pretty box. It seems such a waste.
Dear God.
Moses looks upon the promised land.
They're fantastic.
- Look at this ruby necklace.
- Never much cared for it myself.
Always thought it made Marguerite look like a blood sacrifice.
I wish my old man could see these.
He never knew what it was all about, sitting there every night, hunched over those watches of his, squinting his eyesight away, and for what?
To give me an education at a second-rate public school.
I suppose he thought he had to, that he owed it to me...
And the brand-new anglo-saxon world he'd adopted.
Silly old bugger.
Never thought his son... would be tucking a fortune away into his pocket then.
Family reminiscence, no matter how touching, is something we just haven't got time for at the moment, do you mind?
Now, this is the fun bit, where the householder, wrenched from his dreams by the sound of the explosion, surprises the burglar, and, in the ensuing fight, the house is sacked.
Why is it necessary for you to surprise me at all?
Because, if I've seen you at close quarters,
I can always describe you to the Police.
Wrongly.
"Did you get a good look at the intruder's face, sir?"
"Yes, Inspector, I did.
I don't know if it was a trick of the light, but somehow his face seemed... not wholly human-"
- How much sacking do you want done?
Oh, a decent bit, I think- a few chairs upturned, ornaments put to the sword, that sort of thing, you know.
Convincing but not carthaginian.
Surely you don't call that convincing.
Milo.
Let literature fly to the four winds!
Let the contents of drawers be strewn like autumn leaves!
Hey, that's my new manuscript!
Let my secretary sort it out.
- Enough?
- For a starter.
Now let's see what accident does to artifice seconds out of the ring.
- What seconds? What for?
- The ensuing fight, remember?
- Hey!
- Well, you're the underdog, aren't you?
Got the support of the crowd, haven't you?
What more do you want?
My wife's gonna have a baby.
Now, listen, don't get het up.
This fight is fixed, remember?
This is where I take a dive, and you knock me out cold!
- For real?
- Naturally.
When the Police come, I have to show them a real lump.
Yes, I thought you'd like this bit.
You're dead right.
Now, what shall I use?
Not my opaline, if you don't mind.
There it is!
The original blunt instrument.
- The poker. Right. Now, where do you want it?
- Now, steady.
Don't get carried away. It's not a murder weapon we're talking about, you know.
- No?
- No! We're discussing an object... from which I receive in the classic formula a glancing blow... which will raise a lump without actually cracking the cranium!
Why don't I just keep tapping you lightly on the head with the poker until the lump comes up.
Quite frankly, I've rather gone off the whole thing now. I know!
You can always tie me up and gag me and leave me to be found by the cleaning woman.
"Lords a' mercy, Mr. Wyke!
Whatever do we be doin' there?
All trussed up like a turkey!
Mm-mm-mm. "
"Oh, God bless ya, sir. You're tryin' out somethin' for one of them creepy books of yours. "
"I know! Don't you mind me.
I won't disturb ye.
I'll just be gettin' on with me dustin'."
- Andrew,
If I don't knock you out,
- How have I tied you up?
- That's a very good question.
Come to think of it, you could always hold a gun on me.
But we professional burglars don't fancy firearms much. We are English, after all.
You could always conquer your anglo-saxon scruples.
Besides, it would be my own revolver that you'd taken from me during the struggle.
- Is that loaded?
- Well, of course. What'd be the use of it otherwise?
And I think it ought to go off once or twice as we tussle, blowing to smithereens the usual priceless heirlooms, hmm?
- Why?
- To lend credence to my story of your holding it on me...
While you gagged me and tied me up, all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose so.
There. Right.
Now, what to sacrifice?
What about this old codger up here?
Put that down at once!
That's my Edgar Allan Poe award, given to me by the Mystery
Writers of America... for one of Merridew's greatest triumphs, the Slaying of Jack Spratt.
Ironically enough, for one who could eat no fat, he was murdered by an injection of concentrated cholesterol.
Now, what do you say to the demolition of that gaudy old swansea puzzle jug?
- Puzzle jug?
- To solve the puzzle, pour some water out of it.
Very funny.
Marguerite thought it clever, which ought to tell you something about Marguerite.
Let us expose its shortcoming.
Well, you might have said
"good shot. "
You bloody maniac!
You could have killed me!
Tosh! Not dead-eye Wyke,
The demon gunman of Cloak Manor.
Now, what next?
Ah! The last tender memento of our venetian honeymoon.
I will not resist the temptation.
Shucks, gosh-darn it if I ain't missed the doggone critter.
- You hit what you were aiming for, all right.
- Don't be peevish, Milo.
There's nothing like a little bit of mayhem to cheer one up.
- Did you ever know Charlie Begby?
- You know damn well I didn't.
He was the very finest shot I ever did see.
I once saw him bag six ducks with one shot when he was blind drunk.
Only thing was, they were china ducks in his Auntie's drawing room.
And I said, "Charlie, you can't do that. It's the closed season. "
Told you, he always laughs at my jokes.
Even the bad ones.
True. It's not as funny as all that.
There's an open season all year round for some creatures, seducers and wife stealers, for example.
Now, that's a bad italian joke.
You should know. It's your country of origin, is it not?
No, actually, I'm English.
I was born here, in England.
Were you now, actually?
Where? In dear old cradle- of-the-parliamentary-system,
Who-screws-my-wife-merits- a- large-pink-gin England?
Sense-of-humor-fair-play
England, I mean.
Oh, don't you believe it.
That's the way a foreigner talks.
What he really thinks in private is,
"Filthy, wet country.
Ugly, red, cold men... who don't know how to treat their pale, pink, cool women. "
What brought all this on then?
- What are you doing with that gun?
- Obviously pointing it at you.
I can see that, but why?
Because I'm a-gonna kill-a you.
You're a-gonna kill-a me?
Jesus! Here we go again with another one of your games.
Another one? No, it's the same one.
We've been playing it all evening.
It's called "you're going to die, and no one will suspect murder. "
You mean all that steal-the-jewels stuff was just-
I invited you round here to set up the circumstances of your own death: the break-in, the disguise, jewels in your pocket, the householder aroused, grappling with the thief... and gun going off during the struggle, and then, the final, fatal shot.
Knock it off, Andrew, for God's sake.
- It ain't funny no more.
- It ain't, ain't it?
- Can you find a flaw in it?
- Marguerite.
- The cops'll trace the connection between Marguerite and me.
- What nonsense.
They'll know that's why you did it.
How was I expected to know who you were?
The law will have every sympathy for me.
Property's always been more highly regarded in England than people.
Even Marguerite will assume that you were, after all, just an adventurer after her jewels, a petty sneak thief who, in the end, found larceny less burdensome than matrimony.
The way you're finding murder less burdensome than alimony?
Ha! Wit in the face of adversity!
Good!
You've learned something from the English.
Oh, and here's something else
- a sporting chance. Why don't you make a run for it?
And give you the chance to shoot me down in cold blood?
Hotblood, you mean.
But I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll close my eyes and count up to 20 slowly.
That should give you a reasonable chance. Come on, Milo. Off you go.
One-
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen and twenty.
You left them in that beautiful coat.
- Oh, my God.
- Let's have you out of that car, shall we?
Those lovely boots back on again, please.
Now, of course, the only question left to be decided is where the Police shall find you.
Of course, you could be lying sprawled over the desk in the study, like countless colonels in countless studies, or propped up in the log basket like a rag doll.
Which do you fancy
- early Agatha Christie or vintage S. S. Van Dine?
You're talking of a murder, of killing a real man! Don't you understand?
Perhaps I shouldn't use a gun at all.
Perhaps, best of all,
A real 1930s murder weapon, the Mashie Niblick.
I've got one in my golf bag.
Dear old Mashie Niblick.
I think you'd be found in the fireplace in a fair old mess.
The body lay on its back, its limbs grotesquely splayed like a broken puppet.
The whole head had been pulped as if by some supernatural force.
"My God," breathed the Inspector, blanching.
"Thompson, you'd better get a top yourself. "
"Excuse me, sir, but was all this violence strictly necessary?"
"I'm sorry, Inspector.
I'm afraid I lost control of myself when I saw him handling my wife's intimate garments. "
Oh, it's too bloody elaborate.
I tell you what.
I think the scene the Police find is simply this: after the fight, you flee up the stairs back to your ladder again.
Go on, Milo, flee.
Up you go.
Up you go.
I catch you on the landing, and in the renewed struggle I shoot you.
Nothing succeeds like simplicity, don't you agree, Milo?
On the morning of his execution,
King Charles I put on two shirts.
"If I tremble with the cold," he said,
"my enemies will say it was from fear. "
I will not expose myself to such reproaches.
You must also attempt this anglo-saxon dignity... as you mount the steps to the scaffold.
Look...
I can't give anything back, can I?
I mean, if it hadn't been me, it would've been somebody else.
Please.
I'll go away.
You won't never hear of me no more.
Why, Andrew? Why me?
Don't snivel.
I wanna know why!
I'm amazed you have to ask.
I hate you.
I hate your smarmy good looks and your easy manner.
I'll bet you're easy in a ski lodge, easy on a yacht, easy on a beach.
I knew you'd wear a gold charm round your neck,
And I'll bet your chest is hairy and in summer matted with sun oil.
Above all, I hate you... because you're a culling blue-eyed wop, and not one of me!
A creeping, hairdressing seducer of silly women.
A jumped-up pantry boy who doesn't know his place!
Did you really believe...
I'd give up my wife and jewelry to you?
That I'd make myself that ridiculous?
Why not?
You're not in love with her.
Whether I love her or not,
I found her. I've kept her.
She represents me.
Once... she was in love with me.
And now, she's in love with me.
And that's what you can't forgive, isn't it?
And after me, there'll be others.
You gonna kill them too?
You're mad! You're a bloody madman!
And you are a young man... dressed as a clown about to be murdered.
Put the mask on, Milo.
- No.
- Put it on.
No, please. Please.
Put it on.
Finally, at your moment of dying, you are yourself- a sniveling, dago clown.
Farewell, Punchinello!
Please!
First stage removal. First stage removal.
Streets prohibited to non-permits in one hour.
This conversation with Governor Henry C. Santini...
is brought to you by
Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow...
high-energy vegetable concentrates...
and new, delicious Soylent Green...
the miracle food of high-energy plankton...
gathered from the oceans of the world.
Because of its enormous popularity,
Soylent Green is in short supply.
Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
And now, Governor Santini.
Thank you, Richard. Thank you.
It's a pleasure to be able to talk to the people of the city of New York.
Bullshit.
Hey. What did you dig up in those cases I gave you?
Matthewson... murder.
Out of your jurisdiction, across the city line in Philadelphia.
Chergov, murder.
Went home yesterday.
Donaldson, multiple rape.
Has a record in the Bronx.
Can be extradited.
Get him the hell out of Manhattan.
What about Zolitnikoff?
Well, give me time, will you?
You've been telling me that for the last three days.
Well, I can't locate the files.
I spent hours on it at the Exchange today.
Talked to every other book who was there.
You know, there are 20 million guys out of work in Manhattan alone... just waiting for my job and yours too.
I want to close that case and sign it out.
What the hell kind of miracle do you want of me?
I'm just an ordinary police book, not the Library of Congress.
I don't know why I bother.
Because it's your job.
Besides, you love me.
- That margarine's turned.
- Son of a bitch.
Zolitnikoff, no record.
Matthewson, no jurisdiction.
Chergov, home. And Donaldson, extradite.
Why don't you eat something?
- I'm not hungry enough yet.
- It's not bad.
Tasteless, odorless crud.
You don't know any better.
Oh, for--
You know, when I was a kid... food was food.
Before our scientific magicians poisoned the water... polluted the soil, decimated plant and animal life.
Why, in my day, you could buy meat anywhere.
Eggs, they had. Real butter.
Fresh lettuce in the stores.
I know, Sol. You told me before.
How can anything survive in a climate like this?
A heat wave all year long.
A greenhouse effect.
Everything is burning up.
Okay, wise guy.
Eat some Soylent Green and calm down.
I finished it last night.
I was hungry, damn it.
- I'll hustle some more on Tuesday.
- You do that.
I don't want to get caught in another riot.
Get off. I'll charge up the batteries before I go.
- You'll get a heart attack.
- I should be so lucky.
I've pedaled this damn thing halfway around the world.
You know, I'm getting pretty sick of you.
Yes, but you love me.
Night shift again. I'll be damn late.
So get something to eat.
- What?
- Go with God.
Schmuck.
Gilbert?
Hey, Mr. Donovan.
I have something for you.
Get inside.
Great.
Handmade, isn't that?
Do you have the words straight?
I won't understand them if I live to be 100.
You won't.
Okay.
There!
It's good to hear you laugh.
- Come on and play.
- No, thank you.
- Thank you for the toy.
- I'm glad it amuses you.
Let me do something for you.
Are you ready, Miss Shirl?
It's getting late.
Go ahead.
According to the inventory, we're low on everything.
Okay, but I'm gonna bring you a surprise.
I demolished five saucers with one rocket.
Not bad for an amateur.
- I've got your curfew pass.
- Oh, good. I thought I'd lost it.
That makes it 279 D's and 15 cents.
Call it 279 D's even for Mr. Simonson.
Sign it, Brady.
Mr. Brady?
Think I forgot? I didn't forget.
You asked for something special, and I got it. Come on over here.
How often can I offer a customer something really fantastic?
Look.
Beef, Miss Shirl.
Beef like you've never seen before.
What do you want?
You, Mr. Simonson.
I knew soon.
They told me to say that they were sorry... but that you had become unreliable.
That's true.
They can't risk a catastrophe, they say.
They're right.
Then... this is right?
No, not right.
Necessary.
To who?
To God.
I made the routine check.
He was alive at 10:35.
- What was your name again?
- Charles.
- Charles what?
- Just Charles.
It's perfectly legal.
God, we haven't had any trouble here in years, not years.
The scanners and alarms went out of order last Thursday.
- Come on. Let's have a look.
- Yes, it was Thursday.
The problem is parts.
The original manufacturer's out of business.
Our men fabricate replacements.
Takes them forever, just forever.
Nothing works, not really.
You can't believe the problems I have.
I'll have to tell the other tenants.
What do I do? Call each of them and say
Mr. Simonson in 22A was slaughtered?
Unit scanner and alarm, the best there is.
We should have more guards.
- I told management--
- Wait.
We should have more guards.
Detective Thorn, 14th Precinct.
Tab Fielding. I was Mr. Simonson's bodyguard.
Furniture?
- Yes.
- Simonson's?
- Personal or building?
- Building.
- Where's Simonson?
- In the living room.
Let's go.
- What was his full name?
- William R. Simonson.
Occupation?
- Rich.
- Rich what?
Lawyer. Politics.
I had the impression he was more or less retired.
Say, does this building have a food inventory?
Yes, sir.
Wouldn't you know?
Get me some booze.
- That's not within your jurisdiction--
- Relax.
You're not working for him anymore.
Your contract's been canceled.
I've been paid to the end of the month.
Get the bottle.
Your boss didn't put up much of a fight.
He wasn't the type.
- Most people like to live.
- If you say so.
You're a dream.
Bourbon! Son of a--
Hey. Where were you, bodyguard, when they were butchering your boss?
- He sent us out shopping--
- Us?
The girl and I. You know, Shirl.
So?
Well, we got back at 11.
I saw the jimmy marks on the door and ran in... but obviously it was--
You know how to write?
Yes.
Why don't you go in the foyer and write me a statement?
Include all your movements tonight and yesterday... and your employment number. Okay?
Okay.
He'd be alive if we hadn't gone out.
Now, you have nothing to regret.
He told us to go.
I think he wanted to die.
It was a stupid, amateur burglar.
Nobody's fault, Shirl.
Honey, it wasn't anybody's fault.
Working on your report?
- I was just trying to--
- Yeah, I know.
Hey, what's your name? Shirl?
Yes.
Come on in here a minute, Shirl.
Come on.
Shut the door.
Let's see your hands.
How many times you been in trouble with the police?
- Never.
- I can't hear you.
Never!
No fresh bruises.
He didn't knock you around, huh?
You're a lucky girl.
- He never hit me.
- What?
He was a gentle man.
He never abused me.
I wished he'd lived forever.
- Unless you were fooling around.
- No.
- With the bodyguard maybe?
- No, I'm straight.
Ask Charles. I don't cheat.
Come on.
I'd never risk my job.
When you came back, did you see the body?
Just for a moment.
- Was it like it is now?
- Yes, like it is.
Yeah?
- Sanitation squad is here.
- Just a minute.
What's your arrangement here?
I stay for the next tenant, if he wants me.
I may have to see you again.
All right.
Okay, Shirl. That's all.
Thorn, I thought they had you on riot control.
Right, Wagner.
Hatcher's got you working a double shift?
Me and everybody else.
- No wonder you look lousy.
- Thanks.
- How do you want him marked?
- Simonson. Murder. Dispose.
- They're full up at waste disposal.
- So check dispatch.
Here. You better sign for him.
- My usual cut?
- You'll get your cut.
Just so we understand.
Where are they taking him?
- What's the difference?
- Tell me, please.
He'll be driven outside the city to a waste disposal plant.
When my grandmother died... there was a ceremony.
- I remember.
- I know.
You got your report?
What about the death benefit?
We hold it, pending next of kin.
There is no next of kin.
You can file a claim in 30 days.
I was thinking of Shirl.
Sure you were.
Hey, Wagner!
Give me a lift home?
Hey, Sol!
What are you doing home?
What time is it?
Paper.
- New paper.
- Have some pencils.
Did you ever see a cake of soap that big?
Courtesy of your next assignment,
William R. Simonson.
Chelsea Towers West.
"Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report...
2015 to 2019."
Two volumes.
- Where in hell did you get all these?
- Off his shelves.
The only reference books he had.
You like them?
I love them.
Do you know how many books were published once upon a time?
When there was paper and power and presses that worked and--
What the hell?
Oh, my God.
This Simonson was a great man.
Love apple.
Isn't that beautiful?
Sol.
Beef?
Oh, my God.
How did we come to this?
Why the hell don't you get out of here?
Go back to your foolish work.
Come on, Sol. Don't take it so big.
Look, we're doing okay.
We're doing fine.
We're doing lousy... just like when I was a boy.
Nobody cares. Nobody tries... including me.
I should have gone home long ago.
Come on. I need you.
Simonson, William R.
Number ACX2167D.
- 200 D's cash or 250 in food coupons?
- Cash, please.
Death benefits, line up at tables one and two.
Death benefits, line up at tables one and two.
Hey, Callahan, busy house tonight, huh?
So we'll double up the Tuesday riot detail here at 62nd tomorrow.
That'll leave us thin up here at 101st, so we'll back up with scoops there.
Got that?
So you finally made it.
- Do you know what time it is?
- You're the one with a watch.
I can't. The damn thing won't run.
Let me see it. Maybe I can fix it again.
Okay.
Oh, let's see. The Matthewson murder....
He's in Philadelphia, out of our jurisdiction.
His wife's been lying.
We'll pick her up if we can find her.
Here. Sign.
Zolitnikoff.
I'm working on it.
Which means you still haven't got a damn thing.
How old is Sol Roth now?
He's doing all right.
He's had it.
It's time for you to get another book.
- I'll make arrangements.
- No.
- Sooner or later.
- Not now.
Well, it's your job.
Simonson.
Supposed to look like he was killed... when he caught some punk burglarizing his apartment.
- Well, what do you say?
- It was an assassination.
Just like that?
One: The alarm system was out of order for the first time in two years.
Two: The bodyguard was conveniently out shopping.
Three: The punk didn't take anything.
And four: The punk was no punk.
He used a meat hook instead of a gun to make it look like a punk.
- What did you take?
- Everything I could lay my hands on.
Well, what's for Mother?
One bill for me, 50 for Kulozik, 50 for you.
Ten for Wagner from your end.
- Simonson must have been big.
- How big?
Enough for Chelsea Towers West.
- Who did the inside work?
- For my money, it's the bodyguard.
- What about the furniture?
- Like grapefruit.
You never saw a grapefruit.
You never saw her.
Come on. Shove.
- You know what I really think?
- What?
I think it's really busted this time.
Quick-energy yellow Soylent made of genuine soybean!
Quick-energy yellow Soylent made of genuine soybean!
Hey! Watch where the hell you're stepping!
What may I do for you, sir?
Thorn, 14th Precinct.
We run a clean building here, Mr. Thorn.
- I want to see Tab Fielding.
- Second floor to the right.
- Who's there?
- Police.
Just a minute.
I'm not dressed!
Let me see your badge.
Open up.
All right.
Detective Thorn, 14th Precinct.
Sorry to make such a racket.
I want to see Mr. Fielding.
He isn't home.
- You Mrs. Fielding?
- I'm Martha Phillips. I live here.
I just met Tab yesterday in connection with a case.
I had a few more questions
I wanted to ask him.
- Would you know where he is now?
- No.
When will he be back?
I don't know. He just left.
Swell.
New furniture?
- I've been with him for four years.
- Furniture?
Yes.
Hey, this is really a terrific place.
That's rice.
Yeah, I've seen it before.
Tab does pretty well for himself, doesn't he?
- He's got a good reputation.
- Who with?
- The people he works for.
- Who's that?
You know, Chelsea West.
Yeah. Well, when he gets back, tell him Detective Thorn was here. Okay?
Anything you say.
Come on in here a minute, will you?
Sure.
I haven't seen an incinerator for years.
- Used it lately?
- No, it doesn't work.
What does?
Really a nice place you got here.
Really nice.
Plenty of room to move around.
Yeah.
We were very lucky to get it.
Sorry I had to bust in like this.
You know? Just routine.
- I haven't been very nice.
- You're just fine.
I should have offered you something, Mr. Thorn.
If I'd had the time,
I would've asked for it.
Son of a bitch.
I haven't eaten like this in years.
I never ate like this.
And now you know what you've been missing.
- There was a world once, you punk.
- Yes. So you keep telling me.
I was there. I can prove it.
I know. I know.
When you were young, people were better.
Oh, nuts. People were always rotten.
But the world was beautiful.
It's late.
I gotta get to work.
What have you dug up on Simonson?
I've got a handful of reference work
20 years out of date.
You throw out a name and you expect a miracle.
Simonson, Sol. Report, huh?
Schmuck.
Biographical survey, 2006.
Last one they published.
Simonson, William R.
Born 1954.
Evidently unmarried.
Graduated Yale Law School in 1977.
Principal partner, Simonson,
Borden and Santini.
- Governor Santini?
- Hold still. There's more.
In 1997, he was the director of
Holcox Manufacturing, Norfolk, Virginia.
Specialist in manufacturing freeze-drying equipment... for commercial food processing.
And in 2018...
Holcox was acquired by Soylent... and Simonson became a member of the board.
The board of Soylent?
Your dead one was a very important man.
Soylent controls the food supply for half the world.
- What about those?
- Oh, very technical and highly classified.
Unnumbered copies.
Officially, they don't exist.
Perfect.
- What else do you want?
- Everything.
Well, law, Soylent, oceanography--?
Across the board.
Across--? Oh, that's impossible.
Check the Exchange.
Check the Exchange.
I need you to tell me that?
You know, I was a teacher once, a full professor, a respected man.
Make a special effort, will you, Sol?
This case is for real, for a lot of marbles.
- For who?
- Never mind.
- Don't forget to pick up the water ration.
- I'll do that. I'll die if I don't get water.
Hey.
- Taste that.
- Taste what?
Taste it.
Strawberries?
Hundred and fifty bucks a jar of strawberries.
Thorn.
ID is RC105.
Get me the 14th Precinct.
Thorn, how about paying us a visit?
I can't. I'm following up the Simonson thing.
- Well, what have you got?
- He was a director of Soylent.
- What else?
- Well, right now, somebody's tailing me.
He's damn good at it.
Big deal.
Would you believe bodyguards are buying strawberries for 150 D's a jar?
You'd better report in here right away.
Yes, sir, first thing in the morning.
That was Thorn.
He's a damn good cop.
Appreciate the difficulty, Ed.
But the department wants to cooperate with the governor's office, right?
Whatever you say, sir.
It looks like a fair-complected man... maybe someone close to you, a protector.
And if we refer back to this card back here... if you look at it, the time sequence indicates a three-month period.
The cards indicate a secure trend should follow shortly.
So things are looking up a bit, Kathy.
Thank you.
- Your hair looks beautiful.
- Thank you.
Who is it?
Thorn. Detective Thorn.
I had a few more questions
I wanted to ask.
Having a party?
Just my friends.
It's okay.
Ice.
Jeez.
That's great.
It's still over 90 out there.
Hey.
You know, if I had the money,
I'd smoke two, three of these every day.
Come on in here.
On the bed.
This is a nice place, the way it's fixed up.
Perfume.
He was murdered, you know. Assassinated.
Robbery had nothing to do with it.
You understand?
Yes.
- Did he have any relatives?
- I never heard of any.
- Do you know who he worked for?
- No.
- You were with him for three years.
- He never talked about his work.
Did you meet his friends?
Sure, I met some of his friends.
What were their names?
- I was never really introduced, you know.
- Oh, come on, Shirl.
Well, there was a Mr. Lempeter... a man called Tompkins... and somebody called Santini.
That's all I remember.
He didn't bring people up here very often.
Santini's the governor.
So?
Where did you go with Simonson?
No place.
Shopping once in a while.
- Except--
- Except?
He took me to church.
Church?
About a month ago, and then again a few days before he died.
What did he do there?
He prayed.
And he talked to a priest.
That's about all.
- Why would he take you to church?
- He didn't say.
Why do you think?
I think he just wanted to have somebody along.
He was very strange towards the end.
He didn't touch me for months.
And sometimes for no reason at all, he'd start to cry.
I saw him cry more than once.
Old people do that.
Do they?
I can't figure this Simonson.
If I was like him, rich, important... plenty to eat... real bourbon... and a girl like you... you wouldn't see me in church.
What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over the building for you.
I'll teach you to break my rules!
Furniture stays in units!
I've told you before.
- No!
- I mean it!
- I'll get rid of the whole--
- Hold it!
I didn't know you were here, Mr. Thorn.
We give them a day off a month.
We don't have to.
And they break every regulation in the book.
You'd think they'd be grateful for what they've got here. Wouldn't you?
I'll tell you, Charlie... they're here because
I called them for questioning.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
Don't you believe me, Charlie?
You should have told me.
Why?
Regulations.
You wanna file a complaint?
What do you say, Charlie?
No.
I don't want to do anything unfriendly like that, Mr. Thorn.
I wonder if any of these girls want to file a complaint against you.
Maybe not.
Maybe they want to keep it friendly.
I hope so.
Don't you, Charlie?
Don't you?
Yes.
Get the hell out of here.
Look, maybe we better all go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, baby.
Charles isn't as bad as some.
Don't you ever get mad?
What for?
I left my stuff in here.
It's still dark.
You could stay a while.
You could wash up.
I'll make you breakfast.
Why should you?
There's plenty of food in the refrigerator.
Charles wouldn't dare make trouble for you now.
I got work.
I don't wanna be alone.
I'm frightened when I'm alone.
There's nothing I can do for you, furniture.
I got nothing to give.
The new tenant is coming to look over the place.
He may not want me.
Well, I got a place, but it's nothing like this.
This is like my home.
I've been here a long time.
You could take a shower and let the water run as long as you like.
You got....
You got hot water here.
Very hot.
Jeez!
I haven't had a hot bath....
I'll rub you down afterwards.
All right.
You turn that air conditioner on all the way.
All the way up. We'll make it cold, like winter used to be.
- What about breakfast?
- Anything you like.
- Strawberries.
- An egg.
- No, strawberries.
- I've never seen strawberries.
All right. An egg then.
Who the hell needs strawberries?
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.
- Hey, Sister.
- Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!
- Where's the priest?
- You'll find him over there.
Thorn, Father, 14th Precinct.
My name is Paul.
Have I done something?
No, I'm investigating the murder of Mr. William Simonson.
- Who do you say?
- Simonson.
Quite an important man, a rich man.
I have no recollection.
- You talked to him.
- Did I?
No doubt about it.
A rich man.
Yes, I remember.
We don't see rich people here anymore.
There isn't even enough room for the poor.
There's just too many.
Far too many.
- Fa--
- My memory's eroded.
Chiefly, I assign space to people who need space.
Do you need some space?
I need to know what he said to you.
- Are you sure he's dead?
- Yes.
- Really dead?
- He's dead.
- What did he talk to you about?
- Come back tomorrow. I'm very tired.
Father.
Father, did you hear his confession?
There should be a requiem mass, but there's no room.
- Should I make room?
- This is very important.
I can't help you.
Forgive me. It's destroying me.
- What is?
- The truth.
The truth Simonson told you?
- All truth.
- What is it?
What did he confess?
Sweet Jesus.
- We're closing the Simonson case.
- The hell you say.
You heard me. The Simonson case is officially closed.
Felonious assault. Sign.
Yesterday you agreed it was assassination.
There's been 137 reported murders since then, and we won't solve them either.
I'm not gonna falsify that report.
Got a suspect?
I've got leads.
This isn't somebody you scratch after 24 hours and forget.
I told you there's been a tail on me.
Something stinks here.
- Look, you'll sign this, and I'll bury it.
- Like hell you will.
A member of the board of the Soylent Corporation... was torn apart with a meat hook!
You can't sweep that carcass under the rug.
Who bought you?
You're bought when they pay you a salary.
Who's they?
High and hot. They want this case closed permanently! Sign this!
You sign it!
If I close and somebody higher and hotter wants to know why, it's my job!
Sign it. I'll cover for you.
I won't put my job on the line for you, Hatcher.
Not my damn job!
Hey, big shot.
Hatcher says you're on riot control.
Great. That really makes my day.
This was once called Gramercy Park.
Now it's the only tree sanctuary in New York.
Governor. Sorry to disturb you this way, sir.
Not at all, Donovan. Not at all.
Your secretary told me where to find you.
It's urgent...
- or I wouldn't have come out here.
- I understand.
Now, what is it?
I'm to inform you the board is determined to resolve... the Simonson investigation immediately, sir.
- I thought it was resolved.
- Yes, sir.
But the police officer involved refuses to close the case.
Perhaps because he went to church yesterday.
- What does that mean?
- It was Simonson's church.
The cop spoke 20 minutes with the priest.
So?
The same priest who heard Simonson's confession.
I don't wanna hear any more about it.
I can't hear any more about it.
Just do what you have to do.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It has been six months since my last confession.
A real bargain, folks. Synthetic footgear.
Plastics. Plastic ware.
We have a large assortment of plastic ware.
Some are a little chipped.
Others have hardly any cracks.
Quick-energy yellow Soylent made of genuine soybeans.
Soylent crumbs! Two D's a kilo.
Nothing cheaper in the market. Come and get it.
Soylent buns!
Get your genuine Soylent buns!
Keep moving right along.
Soylent Green. Soylent Green right here.
They gave me a quarter of a kilo.
I stood in line the whole lousy day, and they gave me a quarter of a kilo!
Do you believe that?
Let me go! Are you gonna put up with this?
They're running out of the damn green.
- Idiots.
- Some foul-up at transport.
- This crowd will blow.
- I know.
Got the scoops standing by, but I don't know if they can handle this.
When you gonna make the announcement?
As soon as I get up the nerve.
About five minutes, I guess.
Better pass the word.
Right.
This is the police.
This is the police. This is the police.
I am asking you to disperse.
The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
You must evacuate the area.
The scoops are on their way.
The scoops are on their way!
I repeat: The scoops are on their way.
Today is Tuesday!
Why would you leave that door open?
Mr. Fielding.
- Why did you set up Simonson?
- I didn't.
You're all there is.
- Who pays your bills?
- I do.
Oh, no. I won't hit a cop. Bastard.
Yeah, I know.
You get life for that, jerk!
Life in a waste disposal plant in a Soylent factory someplace.
How about that big, fat Soylent Corporation?
Do you work for them like Simonson did?
How much did they pay you for that one?
Does Soylent buy your strawberries?
Anybody tails me, bothers me one more time...
I'll come back here and kill you both.
Got it?
Get off my back!
Thorn.
I was worried about you.
- What happened?
- Never mind.
It doesn't matter.
- Good evening, Mr. Roth.
- Good evening.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Roth.
- Mr. Roth.
- Evening.
Good evening, Your Honor.
I assume you have a priority police problem.
Yes, Your Honor.
It's about William Simonson.
And... these.
Thorn.
Thorn. It's curfew.
How do you feel?
A lot better.
I did the best I could... but I still think you should go see the police doctor.
He might relieve me from duty.
You need a rest.
More than two days, and I lose my job.
- We could go to another city.
- What for?
They're all like this.
- The country?
- That's not allowed.
Those farms are like fortresses.
- Why?
- Good land's gotta be guarded... the way they guard the waste disposal plants... and Soylent factories and the plankton ships.
You know, there are idiots in this world who wanna take everything we've got.
- Maybe Simonson was one of them.
- I don't believe it.
It means there's no place for us to go.
That's right.
Why should we?
You be careful now.
Keep the scanners on.
Don't go anyplace without a bodyguard.
The new tenant comes tonight.
He'll like you.
You're a hell of a piece of furniture.
Don't talk to me like that.
Please.
Okay.
It's horrible.
You must accept it.
I see the words, but I can't believe them.
Believe.
The evidence is overwhelming.
- Simonson was a member of the board.
- Yeah.
He learned these facts, and they shook his sanity.
The corporation knew... he was not reliable anymore.
They feared he might talk... and so he was eliminated.
- Then why are they doing this?
- Because it's easier.
I think "expedient" is the word.
What we need is the proof of what they are doing... before we bring it to the Council of Nations.
Good God.
What God, Mr. Roth?
Where will we find him?
Perhaps at home.
Yes, at home.
I waited two whole damn years for an apartment to open up in this building.
It's a nice place.
- How long have you been here?
- A long time.
How old are you?
Twenty-one.
Charles said you were 24.
That makes us both liars.
All right.
All right.
I sleep late.
I like a big breakfast and no lunch.
I'll organize the dinner menu.
Three or four times a week,
I have guests.
Sometimes it's business, and then we have to be alone.
Sometimes it's fun, and then we like a girl who's fun.
Are you fun?
May I help you, sir?
- It feels good.
- Yes, sir. Won't you come in?
And your favorite color?
Orange, I guess.
- Music?
- Classical.
- Light classical.
- I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
Sign here, please, Mr. Roth.
- A full 20 minutes?
- Oh, certainly. Guaranteed.
Thank you.
This way, please, Mr. Roth.
Good evening, ma'am.
May I have your name, please?
Well, I see that orange is your favorite color.
- You want Mr. Solomon Roth?
- That's right.
This way, please.
My God.
It's truly unfortunate that you missed the overture.
- I want to see him.
- That is prohibited during the ceremony.
Well, I can assure you--
Open that damn thing right now... or I swear to God you'll die before he does.
All right! All right.
Sol, can you hear me?
- Thorn?
- Yes.
Thank you for coming.
- Oh, dear God.
- I've lived too long.
No.
I love you, Thorn.
I love you, Sol.
Can you see it?
Yes.
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, yes.
I told you.
How could I know?
How could I?
How could I ever imagine?
Horrible.
Simonson.
Soylent.
Listen to me, Thorn.
Thorn, listen.
I can't hear him.
Do something, damn it!
Yes, Sol.
You've got to prove it, Thorn.
Go to the Exchange.
Please, Thorn.
You've got to prove it, Thorn.
The Exchange.
Go to....
Hey!
- Dispatch.
- Thorn, ID RC105.
Get me the 14th Precinct. Urgent.
Just a moment.
- The circuit is in use.
- Well, break in!
It's a 6-1 priority.
Look, get me Chelsea Towers West.
Apartment 22A.
- Cut in if you get the 14th.
- Understood.
- Hello?
- Shirl, it's me.
Oh, Thorn, I'm so glad.
I have to talk to you.
No, there's no time.
- The new tenant wanted me.
- Good. Stay with him.
I want you to stay with him always.
Oh, Thorn, I want to live with you.
Just live.
- I have Lt. Hatcher.
- Plug him in.
Thorn?
Thorn.
- Thorn, where the hell have you been?
- I'm at the Exchange.
Hatcher, help me.
There's another one over there.
- Hey, punk, are you with us?
- Hatcher.
- Did I get him?
- Yeah, you got him, all right.
You don't listen too good, but you're a damn good cop.
Hatcher... get to the Exchange.
You gotta tell them they're right.
But let's take care of you first.
You don't understand.
I've got proof.
They need proof.
I've seen it. I've seen it happening.
They've gotta tell people.
- Tell them what?
- The ocean's dying. Plankton's dying.
It's people.
Soylent Green is made out of people.
They're making our food out of people.
Next thing, they'll be breeding us like cattle for food.
You've gotta tell them.
You've gotta tell them.
I promise, tiger. I promise.
I'll tell the Exchange.
You tell everybody.
Listen to me, Hatcher.
You've gotta tell them!
Soylent Green is people!
We've gotta stop them somehow!
[English - US]
This way, please. Ladies and gentlemen, this way, please.
Follow me.
Round there, please.
Thank you.
From the dynasty of Akbar the Magnificent, and for over a thousand years, our nation's religious symbol, the Pink Panther.
Largest and most famous diamond in the world.
Irreplaceable, its value cannot be estimated in terms of money.
Isn't the museum worried that someone might steal it?
The Pink Panther is protected, and by forces more impenetrable than any army.
Observe.
Deactivate.
Failing the radar shield, the slightest release of pressure in the weight of the diamond, and the would-be thief is a prisoner.
A prisoner of the Pink Panther.
Why is it called the Pink Panther?
The stone is flawed.
If it is held up to the light in a certain way, the figure of a springing panther can be seen clearly.
- Good morning, sir.
- Sit.
My department has already begun rounding up suspects.
His Majesty has been informed of the theft.
He is flying home from Washington.
- I expect an arrest any moment now.
- I do not share your optimism.
We know the culprit is within our borders.
All airports and railway stations are being watched.
While your men search for this man with the Dutch passport who rented the hotel room, he has thrown away his passport and is making ready to leave the country under a new identity.
- When we find the fingerprints...
- If you find them...
You are both in trouble. But if we do what is necessary and conventional.
I am calling in outside help.
The famous French detective who recovered the Pink Panther the last time it was stolen.
- What was his name?
- Clouseau.
Inspector Clouseau.
- Do you have a licence?
- Monsieur?
City ordinance 47-B prohibits the playing of any musical instrument in a public place for the purpose of commercial enterprise without a licence.
I don't understand.
It is against the law for you to play your musical instrument.
- The leur?
- What?
You say it's against the law?
Yes, unless you have a proper licence.
What kind of licence?
A licence that permits the playing of any musical instrument in a public place for the purpose of commercial enterprise.
- Commercial enterprise?
- Yes.
You play that thing and people give you the money.
People give the monkey the money.
- It is the same.
- Not at all, monsieur.
I am a musician and the monkey is a businessman.
He doesn't tell me what to play, and I don't tell him what to do with his money.
Monsieur, don't try to be funny with me.
He is your monkey, therefore it is your money!
He lives with me, but he is not my monkey.
One day I came home and found him in the living room!
I let him stay, but he pays for his own room and board.
Then the monkey's breaking the law.
But he doesn't play any musical instrument.
City ordinance 132-R prohibits the begging.
How do you know so much about city ordinances?
What sort of stupid question is that,
- are you blind?
- Yes.
Oh, I see, yes. Yes, of course.
You happen to be talking to a police officer, and because I expect to be transferred back to the Detective Division at any moment,
I will let you off this time with just a warning.
Thank you, Monsieur Agent.
But you must get yourself a proper licence.
First thing tomorrow.
Try to do something about your filthy monkey.
Halt! Just a moment!
Move, move!
Over there! Arretez!
Idiot!
How was I to know he was the bank manager?
How were you to know the bank was being robbed?
- That is correct.
- What is correct?
I did not know the bank was being robbed because I was engaged in my sworn duty as a police officer.
You didn't even arrest the old beggar.
There was some question as to whether the beggar or his minkey was breaking the law.
- "Minkey"?
- What?
You said "minkey"!
That is correct, yes, chimpanzee monkey.
So I let them both off with a warning.
The beggar was the lookout man for the gang.
- That is impossible.
- Why?
He was blind.
How can a blind man be a lookout?
How can an idiot be a policeman? Answer!
It's simple, all he has to do is enlist.
Shut up!
- How do you know he was blind?
- Because he told me so.
Oh, he told you so.
And you believed him?
I had no reason to doubt him.
Do you believe me if I tell you that I'm not going to get you suspended for six months?
- Do you believe me?
- If you say so, sir. Yes.
Because I'm a bigger liar than the beggar.
You are suspended for six months without pay.
- Six months?
- Effective immediately.
Have you anything to say?
Could you lend me 50 francs?
Will you get out of my sight!
- Yes.
- Idiot.
My blood pressure.
Idiot.
One day, François.
One day I'll be rid of him forever.
That'll be the day.
- Something on your mind?
- An order from the commissioner.
- Oh, yes?
- It concerns Clouseau.
Yes? Go on.
He is to be reinstated as an inspector.
What? You can't be serious.
And he is to report immediately to a Colonel Sharki in Lugash.
I see.
- Sir!
- What?
It's a birthday gift from my wife.
Most realistic.
Get me the commissioner.
Chief Inspector Dreyfus calling.
The commissioner.
Commissioner,
I have just received your instructions to send Clouseau to Lugash, but you see, he's no longer with the Sûreté, I've just given him...
Yes, but...
Yes, but since France and Lugash have been allies for nearly 200 years, it might be a serious mistake to send someone who is...
I see. Yes, of course.
Very good, commissioner.
It seems the Shah of Lugash telephoned the president personally and asked for Clouseau to be assigned to the case.
- The Shah of Lugash.
- Incredible.
All right, François.
The Shah of Lugash.
...the capital earlier this morning. It seems that the army...
by sealing the area around the president's palace.
Highs for the coast...
Oh, good evening, Madame Landlord.
...against the price increases...
Good evening. I was just reading the headlines in your newspaper.
...opposition is...
Good evening.
Cato?
Cato!
Monsieur Clouseau's residence.
One moment, please.
For you. Chief Inspector Dreyfus.
- Yes, sir.
- You're back on the force.
Come to my office... immediately!
Immediately, sir.
Well, Cato, I am back on the force.
You know, Cato, your freezer ambush ploy...
I really congratulate you.
It was very, very good.
But Cato, your fly is undone.
And so, my friend, are you!
Yes, my little yellow friend.
I knew the chief would have to reconsider.
He did not get where he is by ignoring a man's qualifications.
He knows that I am unique and therefore indispensable.
We are much the same, the chief and I.
But of course, Cato, all great detectives have one thing in common.
You know what that is?
Instinct.
That rare ability to know immediately without having to stop and reason.
And in my business it can easily mean the difference between life and death.
All right, I'll get it.
Thank you.
Yes, that split-second timing when instinct tells you... that...
Ah... Aghh!
...new wave of assassinations.
...the opposition spokesman has categorically denied...
Infamous powers are at work.
The instant you assign me to a case, the underworld hears about it and I am set upon.
Cato is in hospital.
They nearly blew his yellow skin off.
It's amazing that I am still alive.
Amazing is not the word.
Do I detect something in your voice that says I am in disfavour with you?
Yes.
I wish you were dead.
You are entitled to your opinion.
And you are not! Out! Out of my sight!
You want me to leave?
If you are not out of this room in five seconds,
I shall not be responsible for my actions!
Five seconds is nothing,
I can easily be out in three.
- But if you really want me to leave...
- I've had enough!
Oh, thank you very much.
A very amusing clever little gadget.
Very realistic, but, of course, my instinct told me that...
Something the matter?
You're not feeling well?
My blood pressure.
Must take my pill. You're killing me.
Yes. Perhaps some water.
You have a defective carafe.
Allow me to blot you.
- Idiot!
- I will blot you.
I had an aunt who suffered from high blood pressure.
She was attended successfully by Dr August Balls of Nice.
And after he had attended her for several weeks, she... Oh.
Obviously, out of fluid.
Perhaps you would like me to fill it for you?
Now just... just... Please just go away.
Yes.
Well, all right, inspector.
I will leave, but remember,
I will be at your service night or day.
Of course, I will be on assignment in Lugash.
Fortunately there is,
I believe, some difference in time.
My watch seems to have stopped, probably due to the explosion.
You need a new flint.
Well, chief inspector, until we meet again and the case is solv-ed.
"The case is solv-ed!" Idiot!
Don’t just stand there, idiot.
Call a doctor, and then help me find my nose!
Inspector!
A very interesting museum you have here.
- Inspector...
- Please tell me nothing.
I prefer to investigate the scene of the crime spontaneously.
That way it gives my trained instincts full rein.
But our security measures...
I'm sure your security measures are very good.
But, obviously not good enough.
Let me see...
Yes, very effective.
Very effective, indeed.
The element of surprise.
Of course, I knew it would happen.
Nevertheless, the element of surprise.
How very kind of you to welcome me.
Is there any way of getting in and out of this place
- without this happening all the time?
- Deactivate it.
Deactivate the door.
Hmm.
Yes...
Oh.
Ugh. So we meet again.
- Very ingenious.
- He pulled himself across the floor.
He did?
How else could he avoid the radar field?
Yes, how else? Hmm.
Of course, he would need a very slippery floor to do that.
- Therefore, the wax.
- The wax? Aah!
Are you all right?
'Course I am all right.
I am examining the wax.
Have you taken a sample of this wax?
- Wax is wax.
- Well, this is where you are wrong.
Wax is not just wax.
In this case it is a clue.
English wax, French wax, domestic wax...
The inspector is right.
Have the wax tested immediately.
It is my guess that you will find it is English wax.
- Why?
- Because your thief is an Englishman.
How do you know that?
It is my business to know that.
He is Sir Charles Phantom, the notorious Litton.
- The Phantom?
- Yes, one and the same.
His calling card.
Four years ago,
Sir Charles suddenly vanished.
It was rumoured in the underworld... given up his life of crime, but my instinct told me he would not remain in hiding for long.
Four years is not long?
Time is not the issue here, this glove is the issue here.
It signifies the Phantom is up to his old tricks.
But I will catch him and root him out.
It won't be easy, he's a master of disguise.
And, undoubtedly, he has gone back into hiding until the heat is off.
How is he?
Unlovable.
Has he seen it?
No, I thought you'd like to show it to him.
- How was Paris?
- Expensive.
- Good. Buy anything foolish?
- Lots.
- How have you been?
- Splendid. Fantastic.
I have created something... absolutely extraordinary since breakfast.
- Oh, can I see?
- No, no, no. Not yet.
Come on. Please don't be so...
- The impact might be too strong.
- Let me see.
There you go.
- How about that?
- Hmm.
- You know what?
- What?
I think I came back just in time.
Damn!
- What, darling?
- Listen to this:
"Police today were conducting a house-to-house search of Lugash for the thief, who Monday night stole the fabled
Pink Panther Diamond from the Royal Museum here.
According to authorities, the only clue was a white monogrammed man's glove with the initial "P".
Well, what do you think?
That you didn’t just spend your time just painting during my absence.
Oh. You think I had something to do with the robbery.
Didn't you?
You little beast.
Three, no four years ago
I swore to you that I was retiring.
I've been faithful to you ever since.
- In your fashion.
- Now, what the hell does that mean?
That you're being teased.
I believe you, darling.
But you must admit it does sound like the kind of job only the Phantom could have done.
I mean, the Pink Panther.
No clues except your well-known calling card.
Yes. I must admit, the impostor, very clever.
Very clever, indeed.
I'm surprised half the police force of France hasn't descended on us by now.
But, of course, they will!
- Without a doubt.
- But if you're innocent...
I'm not only innocent,
I'm smart enough that if I decided to get back in business,
I wouldn't leave my calling card.
Will the police think that?
No.
But you can convince them.
Not unless the real thief was caught.
But then you are lost.
If the police think that you are the real thief,
- then who will catch the impostor?
- Hm?
Well, I can only think of one person really, can't you?
Charles.
Since the alternative is prison,
I don't have very much choice, do I?
I'm frightened.
This impostor is obviously very clever.
He could be dangerous.
Oh, darling.
Not to worry! Trust me.
I may be a bit rusty, but I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
I congratulate you, chief, on your excellent facilities.
Of course, you understand that my visit here must be of the utmost secrecy.
Of course. My department will do everything possible to assist you.
However, there is one question that only you can answer.
Oui?
Does Sir Charles Litton have a swimming pool?
A swimming pool?
- Back before you know it.
- Take care.
Now, what identity will you travel under?
Well, I shall be... dreary old Sir Charles Litton leaving the country.
And... fearless... dashing young doctor
Marvin Tanny arriving in Lugash.
Watch it!
I have the report here.
Someone has trifled with your brakes.
The underworld will stop at nothing.
It's the second attempt on my life.
I may have caught my death of pneumon...
Gesundheit.
I have fixed your doorbell from the ringing.
There is no charge.
Thank you. What do you want?
I am from the telephone company, there is something the matter with your pheun.
- My "pheun"?
- What?
You said there's something the matter with my "pheun".
- Yes.
- My phone?
That is correct, yes, that is what I been saying.
No trouble with the telephones here.
I know when there is a trouble, and when there is not a trouble.
And I can definitely tell you that there is a trouble,
- you may rest assured of that.
- Since when?
Since it was reported.
I see. What is the trouble with the telephones?
If I knew that,
I could simply call you up and tell you what the trouble is.
What's the trouble?
This man says we have trouble with our telephones.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Emile Flournoy, communications expert and chief trouble-shooter
- for the Nice Telephone Company.
- Please come in, monsieur.
Now what can we do to help you?
Which is your nearest phone?
- There.
- What?
Ah, yes...
Hmm.
Yes, this phone will not do at all.
Show me another phone.
It won't do at all, I'm afraid.
- Show Monsieur Flour...
- Flournoy!
Flournoy... the telephone in Sir Charles's study.
I hope you locate the trouble, monsieur.
Madame, it is my business to locate trouble.
- No trouble back there.
- If you require anything...
Monsieur, all I require... is a phone, my little bag of tools and some privacy in which to work.
That is all I require.
Take that phone, but don't pick it up until I tell you.
- Raymond?
- Si.
I'm taking the 5.00 plane to Switzerland, have you got that?
Si, Switzerland.
Have you got the merchandise?
- Si.
- Good.
I'll see you tomorrow at the Palace Hotel in Gstaad.
Si.
- Goodbye.
- Si. Goodbye.
Inspector?
Do not come in!
Do not come in,
I am making further delicate adjustments to the phone.
I will tell you when it is safe to enter.
These adjustments must not be interfered with, you know.
Do not come in,
I am just putting my tools away.
As I surmised, a slight malfunction with your phone which I repaired.
Well, I must now return to my office and report my adjustments.
According to the authorities in Nice, he has so far demolished one swimming pool and two trucks.
And he's on his way to Gstaad.
- Gstaad?
- Yes.
Today, a paradise in the Swiss Alps, tomorrow, a wasteland.
Compared to Clouseau,
Attila the Hun was a Red Cross volunteer.
- Careful!
- Huh?
I put the real one in the bottom drawer.
See?
Oh! Ooh!
Follow that car!
Good day.
- So nice to have you back again.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, do you know the way to the Palace Hotel?
Yes.
- Bags, sir?
- No, thank you.
This bag never leaves my arm.
Your bag, sir.
Thank you.
Scusi, signor. May I take your coat?
Thank you very much.
- Your gloves?
- Of course.
Your hat?
- Grazie, signor.
- Prego.
Oui, Monsieur?
- Do you have a reum?
- A "reum"?
- What?
- You said, do I have a "reum"?
I know perfectly well what I said.
I said, "Do you have a reum?"
You mean, "Do I have a room?"
That is what
I have been saying, you fool.
Do you have a reservation?
I am Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté... and I am here on official police business.
Whether you're here on official police business or not, this is the height of the season and the hotel is full!
Listen, my friend.
This is a matter of national importance, and if you continue to be difficult with me
I shall have no alternative but to have speaks with my superiors.
Well...
In that case, monsieur... we do have a room.
I thought as much.
Lugash Airways announce the arrival of flight 12 from Paris and Nice.
Passengers wishing to travel to the city terminal by bus
should proceed to the Lugash transport counter.
The nature of your visit to Lugash, Dr Tanny?
- Is it business or pleasure?
- Purely pleasure.
Next.
Incoming passengers are reminded they should retain the white card.
This must be surrendered to Lugash authorities before departure.
The loss of this card may cause considerable delays.
Have my bags sent up to my room.
How are you, Pepi?
What a surprise!
It's Sir Charles Litton, isn't it?
Not necessarily.
Un Cognac, s'il vous plaît.
Well...
Where do I find the Fat Man?
I've... I have not...
I've not seen the Fat Man in years.
Really?
You're not working for the Fat Man, then who are you working for?
You are breaking my finger.
Why don't you call a policeman?
All right, all right.
You can find the Fat Man at the Salamander.
Thank you, Pepi.
Why don't you order yourself some liniment... on the rocks?
Well, Charles!
Well, my old friend.
It's good to see you.
Come, sit down.
I really miss seeing you.
You look wonderful.
What can I do for you?
Well...
I need a favour from you, old man.
Of course.
But first, I need your help.
And my two associates, they're here to guard the Pink Panther.
When you've finished your drink,
- you'll hand it over.
- I haven't got it.
But you took it.
I wish I had, truly.
But I didn't, I swear it.
Normally, Charles,
I'm a man who detests violence, but in your case I'm forced to make a most regrettable exception.
Would it upset you too much to explain why?
Under the pretence of trying to catch the thief, the general is hurting many innocent people... and a group of my very good friends.
If I give him the thief, he'll have to stop hurting them.
Of course, if you didn't steal the Panther, one might almost conclude the general, in order to get rid of his political enemies, engineered the robbery himself.
I bet he even offered a reward.
- A very considerable reward, dead...
- Or alive?
And if you are dead...
I can't prove
I didn't steal the Pink Panther.
I knew you would figure it out.
Deliver the body to the general with my compliments.
I'm awfully sorry... old boy.
Well, you know the old saying,
"With friends like you,
- who needs enemies?"
- Enemies.
Good evening, Dr Tanny.
Good evening.
I am Colonel Sharki.
Yes! I thought we might be running into one another... sooner or later.
I... I need your help.
Now, Colonel Sharki...
What could a simple doctor do to help the head of the Lugash secret police?
A simple doctor? Nothing.
But the notorious Phantom?
Oh, he could do quite a bit.
For instance?
I want your cooperation in recovering the Pink Panther.
The Fat Man seems to think that you cooked up this robbery as an excuse to do a little political housecleaning.
The Fat Man is not the only one with that opinion.
And if you can prove that you are not guilty...
- You have a bad leg?
- Oh, it's nothing.
If you can prove you're not guilty,
I'm in serious trouble.
Because of the religious significance of the Pink Panther, it's imperative to the government that sooner or later the thief be apprehended,
- and the jewel returned.
- You would prefer it later than sooner?
I can't tell you how reassuring it is to know that we understand each other so well.
And if...
I do... catch the thief?
I have every confidence that you will.
How does the saying go?
"Set a thief to catch a thief."
Goodnight, Dr Tanny.
- You hate him.
- Yes, I hate him all right.
- How much do you hate him?
- How much?
How high is up?
I hate every little molecule in his body.
You'd like to kill him?
To kill him. Oh, God, yes. To kill him.
Why don't you?
Oh, to kill him.
What? Why don't I?
- It's not so easy, you try.
- I mean kill him psychically.
- Ridiculous.
- Why?
Nothing I can do psychically would have
- the slightest effect on him.
- Why not?
Because he's got the brain of a minkey.
- Minkey?
- What?
- You said minkey.
- I did?
You see, I'm beginning to talk like him.
Now doctor, you'd better come up with a better suggestion or I'll get myself another analyst.
Now, just relax.
Relax.
I haven't slept for a week.
I just lie there thinking the same thoughts over and over and over again.
Describe your thoughts. Get them out in the open and you'll feel much better.
All right.
See, it's always the same.
Clouseau is sitting there, in a chair just like you, with his back to me.
And then suddenly, my hands go round his throat and I begin to squeeze.
It's wonderful, it's marvellous.
I'm squeezing.
And the more I squeeze, the freer I feel.
I'm in ecstasy.
And then suddenly...
Suddenly, my problem is solved.
Doctor?
Doctor!
Sir Charles arrived at my office this morning at ten, and we reviewed all the evidence to date.
He was interested, asked all the right questions.
Then we went to the viewing room and watched the film from the hidden monitoring cameras.
This was the last group to go through the museum before it was robbed.
- Do you recognise any of these people?
- No.
No.
He appeared to study the film very carefully, and he claimed not to recognise any one of them.
No.
We questioned him three times about each.
No.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- This one?
- No.
- How about that one?
- No!
Each time the results were identical.
Little or no stress until questioned about number three.
Then, hard stress.
Number three.
A young man, the museum guide remembers him.
Good morning.
It could be better.
- How?
- You could go away.
All right, but first I'll need your truck.
I haven't got a truck anymore.
I sold it.
What do you want it for?
You're gonna help me get across the border.
It's impossible, the border is closed.
You have to have a special pass.
- Then get one.
- It's out of the question.
If I go to the Fat Man to buy a special pass, he wants to know the reason.
Then tell him that I've threatened your life unless you help me to get across the border.
Tell him that for half the sum of the reward plus a forged pass to get you out of the country, you will deliver me into an ambush at some pre-named place of the Fat Man's choosing, this side of the border.
What if he doesn't believe me?
I'm sure you'll be able to convince him.
And if, my dear Pepi, you double-cross me, it'll be a very long while before you give your next piano recital.
Yes?
You asked to be kept informed of Lady Litton's activities.
- Yes.
- She's going skiing at two.
- Skiing in this weather?
- On the glacier.
On the glacier?
- How long have you been a bellboy?
- Oh! Too long, monsieur.
Keep up this good work and very soon I will see to it that you become a bell man.
- Bonjour, milady.
- Hello, good afternoon.
I changed my mind about skiing. I'm going to the tennis matches instead.
If my husband calls tell him I'll be back around four.
- Oui, madame.
- Thank you.
Hello?
Guten Tag?
- Hello? Wie geht's?
- Wie geht's?
Swine bird, that is my private moustache. You naughty bird.
Swine!
No, no, no, wait!
It's me,
Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté.
- She's coming.
- What?
In the elevator.
Hello.
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
What we are doing...
She's coming!
I'm sorry.
Oh, come in, please.
- Some towels you have, bitte?
- Oh, yes. I'll go get them.
- What are you doing?
- Nichts. Staubsucker.
Out! Schnell! Schnell!
Get up, you fool!
Guten Tag! Wie geht's?
What took you so long?
The Fat Man is not convinced so easily.
- But you managed.
- Here is the pass.
And you gave him...
As you suggested.
For the pass and half of the reward,
I will hand you over.
- Quickly, we must hurry.
- Where?
- What?
- Where did you agree to hand me over?
The Fat Man will be waiting at the point one mile south of the roadway, seven miles from the border.
I know the place precisely.
I will avoid it absolutely.
Quick, we must hurry!
No, after you.
- What?
- Try "why."
- Why?
- Shh!
Because I know you precisely, and doubt you absolutely.
Sir Charles... Please, please!
Sir Charles...
Don't worry, as long as you've told the truth, there's nothing to worry about.
Nothing to worry about.
All right?
- Be careful.
- Thank you very much.
Open it.
Be careful.
He tricked me!
From the gentleman at the bar, madam.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Monsieur Guy Gadbois, at your service.
- How do you do? I'm Lady Litton.
- Yes, I know.
- Oh.
- I took the liberty of finding out.
I hope you are not offended.
That depends on your intentions.
Strictly honourable, I can assure you.
A man sees a beautiful chicken, he can't help but be inquisitive, you know?
Would you think it naughty of me if I offered to buy you a drink?
But you already have.
How about I buy myself one, and we'll drink it together?
All right.
Waiter... another Kahlúa and ginger ale, please.
Well...
If there is a Lady Litton, there must be a lord.
- What?
- Lord Litton.
- Yes, he's in...
- Yes?
- ...plastics.
- Oh, the plastic.
- In...
- Yes?
Industrial plastics.
Very interesting.
Well...
Here is looking at you, kid.
You have anything to declare?
Nothing.
You may proceed.
I come here very often, you know.
I come here for the winter sports,
- for the skiing.
- So do I.
Why have we never met?
Well, it's quite simple, really.
I get up at the crack of dawn...
I'm so terribly sorry about that.
I get up at the crack of dawn, always.
Up the mountain, down the slopes on the piste.
You must be a very good skier.
Well, I started when I was a mere babe in arms.
I could ski before I could even crawl.
I'm terribly sorry, I beg your pardon.
It's all right.
This hotel is deteriorating rapidly.
Well...
Here's to you, Monsieur Gadbois.
Is that your own parrot?
- No, it comes with the hotel.
- Does it?
Someone let it out of its cage, and I can't get it back in.
- You need another glass.
- I most certainly do.
Swine parrot.
What is it you do, Monsieur Gadbois?
Well, you know, I do a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
A man of mystery.
One might say that, yes.
I would, of course, tell you more.
But it would be safer for you if I did not.
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.
Yes?
Excuse me, for moment
I thought I was in your apartment.
- Hello?
- I am in your apartment.
- It's for you.
- For me?
There is no need to leave on my account.
There is need to leave on my account.
- Hello?
- Monsieur Gadbois?
Yes, this is Monsieur Gadbois.
Who is that speaking?
Don't you know? Can't you guess?
I'll give you a clue.
This is the man who hates you.
This is the man who more than anything else would like to see you dead and buried.
The headwaiter that works at the little bistro on the rue des Beaux-Arts?
No! This is Chief Inspector Dreyfus.
Idiot!
You understand that anyone could call up here and ask for Monsieur Guy Gadbois and say that they were
Chief Inspector Dreyfus.
What is your code name?
Code name, huh?
Code name?
I don't have a code name.
I never had a code name, lunatic!
I understand that, sir, but only the real Inspector Dreyfus would know that he did not have a code name.
Clouseau, why are you still in Switzerland?
Because I am here attempting to interrogate Lady Litton and trying to find out where her husband is.
Her husband is in Lugash.
He's been there since Tuesday.
Well, in that case, I will leave on the next available plane.
Yes, sir, yes. Quite, quite.
I quite understand what you mean, and I'm not arguing with you about that.
That would be my advice, as well.
Yes, absolutely.
But...
Yes, I can understand your feelings under the circumstances. Absolutely.
Yes, that is quite right.
But I must say to you, sir, whatever your feelings are, you must not call me here at any hour of the night or day.
Even in an emergency.
A little bit of this and a little bit of that add up sometimes.
Thank you.
Did I understand you to say you were leaving on the next plane?
Regrettably, yes, yes.
One of life's little tragedies, you know.
- Aw!
- So until we meet again...
I will say... here is looking at you, kid.
Is anything the matter?
Yeah.
Strange taste.
Well...
- au revoir.
- Au revoir.
The concierge, please.
Monsieur Gadbois' room.
Oh, no.
Yes?
Clouseau.
Since you have seen fit to disregard my orders and remain in Switzerland...
Don't interrupt!
I want you to arrest Lady Litton!
Arrest the Lady Litton?
Immediately!
If she is not in your custody within five minutes, you'll be checking parking meters in Martinique.
Yes, sir.
Five minutes!
No, Cato, you fool, this is not the time.
This is not the time, Cato!
Come out of there, come out of there!
This is the time!
You stupid fool, you see what you did?
You forgot the first rule of self-defence.
Never be taken by surprise!
I didn't expect to see you out of hospital so soon.
My brown suit. Give me the valet.
They did an excellent job of restoration on your yellow skin.
Valet, this is Inspector Clouseau.
Please send up my brown...
Well, please send down my brown suit immediately.
I cannot wait.
As quick as you possibly can!
Quicker, please!
I can't wait for them.
Help me get dressed.
I have to go and arrest Lady Litton.
Arrest Lady Litton, be sure, but on what charge?
Hello, hello!
This is Inspector Clouseau.
Please connect me with Paris, France.
Trocadero-3-7-1...
Hello, oui.
What?
Who?
Yes, yes, OK. I'll accept it.
Hello, Clouseau.
No, he's not here.
On vacation.
He won't be back for a week.
I just spoke with him.
He instructed me to arrest
Lady Litton immediately.
What?
Yes!
That's very easy for you to say.
I would be delighted to arrest her, yes!
On what charge?
It could be embarrassing if I go to her and say,
"I arrest you in the name of the law."
She says "On what charge?"
I do not have the answer.
What?
Oh, yes!
And the same to you!
Filthy swine.
Cato, very strange.
Chief Inspector Dreyfus calls me, tells me to arrest Lady Litton, immediately, without a charge
I call him back,
I find he's not in his office.
Even stranger,
I find he's gone away on vacation.
Cato, things are very fishy in Denmark.
- Switzerland.
- Yes, there too.
No more. No more, I've had enough.
This time it ends with a bullet in his brain.
Brain.
- Bonjour...
- Shh.
Merci.
Bonjour, madame.
Breakfast.
Voilà.
Just leave it over there.
I'll sign for it later.
How about a little tip?
Charles, darling.
All right, all right.
Now where is it?
After all these years, you need to ask?
I'm quite serious.
Oh, I hope so. You hotel waiters lead such interesting lives.
No, no, no, no, no. Not now, darling.
Not now. Please, now, where is it?
That depends on what you're looking for.
Now, come on, Claudine. Please, not now.
Where is it? I'm losing patience.
I shall ask the hotel to send up another waiter.
I should like very much if you would hand me over the Pink Panther, if it is not too much trouble.
How did you find out so quickly?
Feminine intuition.
I thought it would take you at least another week.
You know, you are very good at what you do.
Thank you.
I was prepared to surrender my body to Clouseau if it was necessary.
Why did you do it?
I didn't. I said I was prepared to.
Aren't you a little bit proud of me?
You nearly had me killed, you know.
- It's better than dying of boredom.
- Me? Bored with you?
I'm sorry, darling.
It's just that I never realised how tedious life could be for a retired jewel thief. Yuck.
Clever little beast.
Better than a hotel safe.
Now tell me, how did you find out it was me?
Well, there's something about a wife even with a beard.
Now, come on, darling.
It's time to get dressed, pack and go home.
Now, come on, darling...
Forgive the intrusion, madam, but you see before you a very disillusioned man.
Disillusioned and with a gun.
- He's obviously not with the hotel.
- No.
Allow me to introduce Colonel Sharki of the Lugash Secret Police.
That explains the gun.
I foolishly believed that your husband was a man of integrity.
- That was foolish.
- Thank you.
You see, your husband and I, we had an arrangement.
He was to do certain things, and if he didn't...
You were to do certain things.
Regrettably.
Coffee, darling. I'm sorry, there's only one cup.
I know I'm going to be sorry I asked this, but want to give me a for instance?
First, you will hand over the Pink Panther.
And second?
I will be forced to shoot you.
Who's forcing you?
Open the door in the name of the law.
Would you please, sir, answer the door?
Excuse me, darling.
Lady Litton, I am forced to arrest you!
And if you do not open this door,
I will have no alternative but to break it down.
Very well.
Guy, you're all wet!
There's a defect in my plumbing.
Lady Litton, listen to me.
I have deceived you.
I am not Guy Gadbois. I am
Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté, and it is my painful duty to arrest you.
Do you know my husband?
I must confess I do.
I met him several years ago.
When I meet him again,
I'll arrest him immediately.
Then you must have met Colonel Sharki.
That idiot from the Secret Police.
Yes, I know him. And when I...
Sir Charles Litton,
I arrest you in the name of the law, and I warn you that anything you say will be...
Before you get all worked up, there's something you must know.
He intends to kill all of us.
- Who?
- Colonel Sharki.
Good Sharki Colonel God, we were just talking about you.
As you can see,
I've got the whole case buttoned up.
Everything is sewn up.
This is Sir Charles Phantom, the famous Pink Litton.
Who stole the...
What did you say?
He was going to kill us?
Well, if you can persuade him to change his mind...
- You're joking, of course.
- No.
- You're going to kill me, as well?
- With pleasure.
Is there anything I can do that will make you change your mind?
Well, there's nothing that I can think of.
Supposing that I thought of something.
- Hmm. For instance?
- Well...
For instance, supposing
I told you that your fly was undone?
By a remarkable coincidence, so is yours.
Oh, no. Not again.
Ah! I see you are familiar with the "open fly" ploy.
Well, so am I.
You also know the "falling on the bed with the arm on the floor" ploy.
- He's been shot dead, idiot.
- Don't call me an idiot.
What? Who?
Be careful, darling.
He's either reloading or out of ammunition.
He's out of his mind, that's what he's out of.
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
- Monsieur!
- I'll kill you!
Get out of my way!
Chief Inspector Dreyfus was tried and found not guilty, by reason of insanity.
Clouseau, the famous detective, was decorated by General Wadafi.
Then he went back to France, where I believe he took over the position vacated by the madman, Dreyfus.
There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the largest diamond in the world.
And surely, the most famous, or infamous, if you prefer.
The Pink Panther.
What ever happened to Sir Charles?
As far as anyone knows, he still is living the quiet life at his villa in the South of France.
Although there has been a rumour that the notorious Phantom is back at work, and although it has long been suspected that Sir Charles and the Phantom are one and the same, it has never been proved.
Mark my words, François.
Before the week is out,
I will have proof that
Sir Charles Litton is the Phantom.
- Did you enjoy your food?
- Oh, yes, yes. Very nice.
You've probably guessed
I have a passion for the Oriental food.
Cato usually does some cooking for me, but recently he's taken to attacking me at every chance.
It's very bad for the digestion.
That is very strange, François.
I don't ever recall receiving the fortune cookie in a Japanese restaurant.
- What does it say?
- We shall see...
"Beware of Japanese waitress bearing fortune cookies."
Japanese waitress?
Cato, get off!
Cato!
No, you idiot!
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry. I beg your...
Stop, Cato! Enough, enough!
Enough, I say!
Get your hands off of me!
You must remember my new position in the force!
You have devastated my sukiyaki in there.
You fool! You raving Oriental idiot!
There is a time and a place for everything, Cato!
And this is it.
Kill him! Kill him!

- Put your shoes on.
- Leave me alone, will you.
You can't leave me here without my hat.
Goodbye.
- Give me the keys.
- Go to hell!
You locked up,
I was already in the car.
That's your bad upbringing - leaving before me.
Nothing to be proud of.
They're not here.
I know what I'm doing,
I haven't gone mad yet.
I'm sure you put them in your bag.
Are you mad?
There are people about.
You mean that car parked over there?
Who would be sitting in a car with the headlights off?
Do you think there's a bit of hanky-panky going on there?
Number 117.
- And we all fall down...
- Enjoy yourselves.
None of your usual
"don't drink" rubbish.
You can't boss me around all evening.
Keep your voice down.
You don't have to talk to me at all.
Look what I pinched at the party.
- Where the hell are those keys?
- How should I know?
Just for once, can't you cut it out?
At least for tonight.
If you've got time have a look at the calendar.
Why should I?
Maybe you'll realise what day it is today.
I mean, for such a clever guy...
They're not here.
So do something.
We can't stay here all night!
We can ring the bell, can't we?
It's not working.
I've got to pee, or I'll...
- I don't give a damn.
- No need to remind me.
I've known for a long time how little you care for me.
I'm not that stupid.
How could you talk to Cejnar all evening?
You keep saying that he's a moron.
Leaving me standing around like unattended luggage.
I'm looking for Anna.
Wake Luděk up.
The spare keys are in the kitchen.
So now you break a window!
We're all idiots, but you're the genius.
Try the laundry room window.
He's out like a light.
Why did you climb over the gate?
It was open.
Can't you get rid of that stupid thing?
So you noticed me.
- What was open?
- I've forgotten what it's called.
Something you go through to get to the garden.
Rubbish!
I haven't heard that from you for ages.
I knew I was missing something.
How else could I have got here?
Over the fence?
In this dress?
Use your loaf!
Klepáč came back from Moscow two days ago.
The blinds have been down the whole time.
There was still no sign of them, even today.
At least when he comes back the missus knows she'll be catered for.
Don't pull the washing line!
Blast it!
They gave us a wonderful reception in Brno...
- In Bratislava... Kosic...
- Košice
They gave us a wonderful reception there.
When it's cold, comrade Deputy Minister, can you lay concrete when it's minus 20 or 30 degrees?
He's asking if we can lay concrete when it's very cold.
I understand.
What a nation.
Never any peace for a soldier!
- We can't lay concrete when it's that cold.
- Dreadful.
And the civic leader of Plzeň...
Plzeň - beer!
We can lay concrete in heavy frost.
You must come and see.
- Where were you born?
- In Mohelnice.
It's a town in a small province.
- Mohelnice is a village, isn't it?
- It's a town!
You must come. You must.
You don't have a Minister for Construction right now?
Of course, we have one.
Comrade Košara is our Minister.
Our comrades told me you don't have a Minister right now.
- He should be around somewhere.
- He excused himself.
He excused himself?
Allow me to make a toast.
Soldiers and Czechs alike, present arms!
He's blown the fuse again!
I'd be interested to see if you tell him off!
Did he tell you what he did to the radio?
Yeah.
When? When was the last time you saw him?
A week ago.
If anyone's spoiling him, it's you.
Rascal!
What a bloody mess!
They'd have to be hanging here for me to find them.
Is it going to take you all night?
How should I know where the keys are?
- They're hanging on the hook!
- Bullshit.
- Where else could they be?
- I have no idea.
How come it's unlocked?
A moment ago it was still locked.
Like the gate!
Can't you even tie your own shoelaces?
What were you up to?
I thought you were fixing the fuse?
It's not the fuse, it's a power cut.
But I saw you locking up.
And the key is inside.
When we go out he always gets up to mischief.
I told you, his mates are always over.
They've probably been mucking around in the house.
He wouldn't have left the key in the lock.
He would have put it where we couldn't find it.
So it must have been the Holy Ghost.
Ask him in the morning.
He might tell you what he was up to.
He's due a good thrashing.
Don't drink vodka from the bottle!
- You know who does that, don't you?
- Yes.
Can't you use a glass?
I'm a publican's daughter, my boy!
You should have got used to it by now.
Our Comrade President also drinks from the bottle.
Sorry, the comrades never sleep, they are listening!
The meat will be off by morning.
These are my keys!
Your keys were hanging in the kitchen!
I locked up with mine.
He'll get it for bringing his mates here.
Shall I put the meat on the window sill?
It's warm outside.
Take it down to the cellar and put it on the floor.
It's still cold.
They must have only turned off the power a little while ago.
Look, the lights are on at the Klepáč's!
How could they have turned off only our electricity?
It could be the fuse outside.
Where's the torch?
Can't you ever keep anything in its place?
I've got everything in place.
I'm not so sure you have.
It's about time I brought a little light into your life!
Drink up, my son, down it in one...
They know how to put it away.
What did you discuss at the cabinet meeting?
- Did you go through our report?
- You're not drinking?
Our people are growing in strength!
It's all the same whether they're Catholic or Muslim.
All that counts is whether they accept socialist goals.
Isn't that true, Comrade Minister?
I went to see Mareček at the factory.
He had a picture of the Virgin Mary on his machine.
Right next to his best worker's flag!
The Party chairman says he doesn't know what to do with him.
"Be broad-minded", I said.
"Did we win the revolution or not?"
As long as a person accepts our socialist goals...
Let him pray if he thinks it's good for him.
But we don't have to write about that in the papers.
We're not going to be heavy-handed about it.
I'm glad you're of the same opinion.
But it's only Tuesday.
Government sessions are on Thursdays.
But they summoned Košara.
They phoned to tell him to come straight away.
I don't like standing near the...
Don't you know what happened to Košara?
- No. What's up with Košara?
- Didn't they speak to you?
Who?
Excuse me, I have to speak to the parliamentary leader...
See how he serves the food?
None of them is a trained waiter, they're all spies!
Give me a bit of salmon.
It's that red stuff over there.
They took him in!
And Tondl, Klepáč and Šlesingr too!
But why Košara?
Because his real name is Karpeles.
He's a Jew.
He was scared to do anything on his own.
We had to force him to sign that brickworks report!
I'd keep that to myself if I were you.
Make sure you get rid of all the papers.
You might get your fingers burnt.
- But why me?
- Just in case.
This is the surplus plan!
Anna is looking for you.
Do you hear me, Ludvík?
I'm looking for Anna.
You could wash the dishes some time.
I may, some time.
Put the meat on the floor.
I'll break his legs.
Where are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm running a bath.
The tank is full of hot water.
The power must have only switched off a little while ago.
What are you doing with those boxes?
Where did we put all my papers?
Those black books with my notes in?
What do you need your notes for?
I kept notes when I was working at the Secretariat.
I read it once to you in bed, remember?
That's practically all you do to me in bed.
How could I remember?
It's been nothing but brickworks for the past six months.
I know all the brickworks in the country.
There'll be no reading tonight.
Put theory into practice!
At least once a week, even if it's bleak!
- Give me the torch
- Don't step in the custard!
How come the phone isn't working?
It should be working even with the power cut.
If a government phone won't work, what will?
Who on earth are you phoning at this time of night?
What do you care who I ring anyway?
For Christ's sake, stop sighing.
It really gets on my nerves!
No need to sigh because of me!
I'm phoning for a man, if you must know!
Well, I don't.
Didn't we put it all in my suitcase?
The old one I used to have at Technical College in Brno.
- I threw it away ages ago.
- Just like you.
But there was nothing in it.
I've never lost anything of yours.
Anything you've ever lost, you've lost by yourself.
With me, you only lost your virginity.
Towels are for hands, not dishes!
I'll write it on the wall for you.
Do you want something to eat?
Where did you put those things from the case?
All I remember is what happened ten years ago today.
What happened?
See, something you don't remember!
Actually, I tried to phone Klepáč's wife.
They must have people round.
All the lights are on.
I brought her some stuff from the government shop.
She'd already paid for it.
Smoked salmon and four boxes of cheese. They love cheese.
The manager asked me to take them, so he wouldn't have to make a special delivery.
Maybe she came to get it while we were out.
They might have been at the reception.
Maybe in the special lounge reserved for the President.
Tondl's wife said Klepáč was going to be made a Minister.
Why did you close it?
What did I say this time?
Did I say anything wrong?
- Don't shout.
- I can hardly hear myself talk.
At least tell me what I can talk about.
When can I talk normally?
You said the kitchen, the bathroom and the toilet were OK.
What about the President becoming a grandfather?
Is that classified information too?
Can the Ear hear that?
Listen, Ear: Comrade President is a grandfather.
It's a boy. Everything's fine.
The mother, unfortunately, hasn't got enough milk.
Come here.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I've got to tell you something.
Another little chat, what about this time?
Didn't you get enough chance at the party to talk?
I don't want to hear about government mistakes now.
And I don't want you reading to me today.
What the hell was in that glass?
Must have been the stuff
I rub on my ankles.
Ten years ago today, the 17th of July.
- Is it the 17th already?
- Every year, there's a 17th of July.
Every year it is only me who remembers.
Too bad.
But the phone was working earlier.
Jindřich phoned to say he'd be a bit late.
It was working.
Čepička phoned me.
She wanted to know if the house is warm enough in winter.
Markus told her that we were moving.
What an idiot.
The cabinet housing official is an idiot!
Do you have to keep up with your daily ranting?
As long as you don't.
Undo this, will you?
That tickles.
Comrades, we're going to bed.
- Hi, Bedřich.
- You're here?
Why wouldn't I be?
I thought that...
Since so many people have gone away,
I thought you...
But I phoned you this morning about that report.
Yes, so you did.
Sorry, I've had so much on recently.
I'm looking for Marie.
Have you seen her?
Aren't you getting undressed?
Just in time, we would have been flooded.
Aren't you coming?
In a minute.
Ludvík, my old friend.
I'm only friendly with those who they're after.
Number 117.
- This is not my car
- It is, Comrade Deputy.
This isn't Jindřich.
You're not Jindřich, are you?
- We live in Bulharská Street.
- I know where to go.
- Are you sick?
- A bit.
- Is it your stomach?
- Yeah.
- Shall I make you some coffee?
- No, thanks.
Did Jindřich say anything about not coming to get us?
No. Who was it that took us home?
He drove us all round Prague.
Didn't you tell him where we live?
Make me some coffee.
You didn't eat any of those prawn sandwiches, did you?
No, I didn't.
We get this every anniversary.
Get a move on.
You do take your time.
Comrades, let us build a 'peoples politics' from granite!
To throw ourselves into our work will not be an easy task.
Silence, the Comrade is speaking!
I sometimes wonder if I understand anything.
Why not admit it?
But will the revolution wait?
That way we couldn't knock imperialism down.
So I'll make a decision and it will be good.
It won't be that painful either.
Right now I wish I could be just back to the factory.
On Sundays, it would be beer and football.
But we cannot afford to rest, comrades.
It is our mission to change the world.
Not turn it upside down.
That's just what the capitalists have done.
Hear, hear.
He's 60, isn't he? But still going strong!
But don't think it's clear to everyone.
They are still among us, those who only call themselves comrades.
Košara, Tondl, Klepáč, Šlesingr...
Košara doesn't want to close the old brickworks and transfer the workers where they're needed.
He says it might cause an 'imbalance'.
No, Mr Košara!
An imbalance would only occur if we allowed you, and the likes of you, to attack the Party's principles!
Do you want some scissors?
Here's your coffee.
Your bath is getting cold.
Look out of the window.
Is that car still there?
- What car?
- The Party one.
The Party one?
Well?
It's the same one that was there before.
They moved it away from the street lamp.
Are they in the car or standing in the street?
Why would they be standing in the street?
- What are you tearing up?
- Where's the plunger?
There used to be a plunger here.
You've blocked the toilet! You're not going to unblock it, are you?
Don't shout into their ears!
Do you have to clear out your case right now?
- Why are you tearing that up?
- Keep quiet!
Is someone banging on the gate?
Who would be doing that?
Put something on.
Don't run about naked!
Why should I get dressed?
I've just got undressed.
Since when has it bothered you? Tell me.
You wouldn't mind Konvičková running around naked!
And now both!
So what do you say to that about Košara?
I just don't know.
But you prepared that report for him, didn't you?
Košara wanted to be in charge of everything.
He kept people at a distance.
I... We only got him the figures.
But Košara was good for the job, wasn't he?
- He was a building engineer.
- It depends on how you look at it.
He could be very difficult.
- Have you heard about Košara?
- Of course.
Do you understand what's going on?
I'll call a Party meeting to take a stand.
Of course.
- What have you got there?
- Vodka and pineapple juice.
- Who thought up such slop?
- The Comrade.
- What is it?
- Open the door.
- Why?
- Open the door!
There's a man in the garden.
He's not moving.
Why are you burning everything?
Why are you burning this report?
- You slaved over it for six months!
- Careful!
- They can hear everything.
- You've burnt the seat!
We'll suffocate in here.
Close it, you idiot!
Keep quiet!
They've locked up Košara.
And Klepáč, Tondl and Šlesingr.
They took them as soon as they arrived at the party.
They told them to go to that special lounge.
And they took them away.
What did that Čepička woman say?
She asked if the house was warm in winter.
What do you want me to burn?
It doesn't matter now.
There must be a draft from the roof.
The attic window is open.
How can they put a Minister in prison?
They don't discriminate.
Do you have any idea how many are in prison over there?
- Imprisoned and then calmly bumped...
- Where?
Maybe they just want to ask some questions.
Since I was his First Deputy.
Was? You aren't a Deputy any more?
Who knows? Maybe I am.
I don't know who is and who isn't any more.
We could have burnt it in the boiler.
- They could see us from there.
- We should have stayed in Olomouc.
We should never have moved to Prague.
- We were okay there.
- That's Luděk's school report!
I'll put it in your drawer.
So you couldn't say you didn't know about anything.
Why do you always snoop around my things?
My drawers, pockets and briefcase?
- Do I bother with your things?
- You never bothered about anyone.
You've only ever been bothered about yourself.
- Where are you going?
- To get dressed.
I'm not running around as if I were in Hawaii!
Are you going to spend the night in the toilet?
He's not in the garden any more.
Can you see him?
Don't volunteer any information.
Just answer their questions.
Don't tell them that Košara is Luděk's godfather.
They'd read all sorts of things into that.
- You closed the laundry room window?
- Yes.
You didn't.
You didn't close the door either.
There was a draft when I opened the window.
Didn't I put your things in that old medicine cabinet?
I think I put them into something wooden.
It was in Aunt Božena's old chest.
So she still hasn't taken her junk away?
How many times have I told you that her stuff has got to go?
Where can she put it?
They took all her property and left her with one room.
- Tell her to chuck it all out!
- Chuck out new sewing machines?
They're practically brand new!
You told her not to sell as money had no value!
Quiet!
We can talk here, can't we?
They didn't put a bug in here.
We told them that we would use it as a nursery.
Klepáč's wife said they never put them in nurseries.
When they had guests, they shut themselves away there.
Now they've been shut away for good.
How will we explain all this stuff?
I should have kicked that old bag out.
I really should have given her the boot!
You told her yourself that she could keep her carpets here.
- What the hell is this?
- My petticoat.
Do you think they'll get into our house and into every room?
They'll get into every corner of every cupboard!
Do you remember when the Comrade walked past you?
You were standing there with Bílková and Vagerová.
What did he say to you?
The Comrade knows you, doesn't he?
You remember the party at his Lány mansion?
We walked in the grounds and you lost your shoe.
He must remember you.
What did he say?
I can't remember anything.
- He did tell me something.
- Can't you remember?
Try to remember what it was.
Which of our comrades is celebrating a saint's day today?
Come on, girls!
Yes! I'm celebrating today.
But today isn't Saint Anna's day!
I'm celebrating my tenth wedding anniversary.
Let's see your ID card then.
We can trust women but you we must verify.
I've got the date engraved on my wedding ring.
How did my mother's glasses get into my pocket?
The 17th of July.
Comrade Anna is not lying!
Promises must be fulfilled.
I hope you have many offspring in order to increase our ranks!
Let me wrap those in paper for you.
The vase has to stay here.
The Comrade doesn't know about such details.
Did he call you Anna?
- I think so.
- Well, yes or no?
- I can't remember. I was a bit tipsy...
- I'll say. A bit!
Did it look as if he recognised you?
If he knows me, why shouldn't he recognise me?
- Or is he past it?
- Try and concentrate!
If he called you Anna and was friendly that would have political significance.
He knows you're my wife and if I were in trouble he wouldn't call you Anna.
He did call me Anna.
Look, there's a third man!
They've been at the Klepáč's place.
We forgot the old adjoining gate behind the compost.
But the gate was wired shut.
We undid it so that we could use it as a short cut.
Klepáč's wife and I took turns cooking.
Do you think that they'll make her move out?
Will they give her a flat if he's behind bars?
I don't know what he did with the report in the end.
He did the final editing himself.
You know how he reacted to things.
I told you that we didn't always see eye to eye.
- Who do you mean?
- Košara.
But he thought highly of you, didn't he?
Only when I agreed with him.
I told you about the row we had at that meeting.
No, you didn't.
I hardly knew Klepáč,
Tondl and Šlesingr.
You're right. It must have been mutual.
They're stealing our radishes.
At least he left the cabbage.
- Where did he get the key from?
- The key is not the problem.
Isn't it just gossip about Klepáč and Košara? Who told you about it?
We're mucking about while our comrades are probably getting 40 winks together.
Those yobs were probably living it up next door.
Do you have to keep on?
Can't you ever let up?
- Didn't we put my things in the garage?
- Don't talk to me!
Do you have to clean the holy seat right now?
I like to see what I'm sitting on.
There are only the things from the pub in the garage.
- I'd have to wear armour to sit on this.
- In my army case?
- Where is my army case?
- I don't know. I was never in the army.
I wonder where it is?
Get the phone!
That's not the phone.
- Is it the gate?
- Yes, it is.
Don't turn the light off. They'll notice.
Turn off the light, will you?
Ludvík, Ludvík.
Don't cry.
Don't cry, please.
What will happen to us?
To Luděk and I?
I'll go and let them in.
Don't worry, nothing will happen to you.
Hide the savings books and your jewellery.
They'll search everywhere.
You'll need some money.
But you didn't do anything!
- I know you didn't!
- So you know what to do?
Where shall I put it?
Put it in Luděk's school bag.
- Someone's ringing the bell.
- Yes, just go back to sleep.
Go to the window and tell them that I'm just coming so that they stop that infernal ringing!
He's coming.
I give you my word of honour that I didn't do anything.
- Is he coming or not?
- He's just staring.
So tell him not to stare.
I put some things in your case.
- His old woman is with him.
- Don't come with me.
I put in your pyjamas and some shirts and socks.
Please... go back.
I just pressed the bell and it kept on ringing.
Do you always have trouble with the stupid thing?
No, never. But it could have happened.
I must have pressed it too hard.
We didn't need to ring.
Are these your keys?
That small one is for the house, isn't it?
Yes, I think they are ours.
My wife must have lost them somewhere.
We said that we'd bring them.
You left them there.
- Standa told us to, but...
- He didn't survive the journey.
Pick him up so that his privates don't get cold!
This is Ludvík, my best friend.
He's a Minister, you clowns!
And these are my best... schoolmates.
- No, my best workmates!
- Careful. No names.
Yes, all members in authority have pseudonyms.
They're writers.
The Brothers Grimm!
Comrade Cibulka!
Stay in that chair.
- Comrade Kopáčková!
- Don't you recognise me?
Remember, we used to pick up girls in the army.
You climbed in through that window.
And I shacked up with that fast piece at the station.
It's me, Standa.
OUR COUNTRY WILL ALWAYS BE
BEAUTIFUL AND AFFLUENT.
You'll sit next to the Comrade.
Do you remember going to that bash?
Wasn't it great, going to a dance... by tank!
- Could I buy more of these prints?
- Of course.
Come and have a drink of dynamite cocktail.
My wife is looking for me.
I'll take you somewhere where she won't be able to find you.
See that one over there with the boobs?
She's enough to make you weep.
Meet my commander.
Hi.
Plum brandy should be old, but your wife should be young.
He was the greatest comedian in the world!
Then we all got married and the cage door shut!
Has the Comrade gone?
He went off to show the new ambassador Prague by night.
But I've lined up people for a photo session...
Do you want me to take the picture for you?
- Put a clean cloth on the table.
- The laundry is still drying.
- Haven't we got a clean table cloth?
- No.
I hope we didn't disturb you, comrade?
- Haven't we met before?
- I doubt it.
Make some coffee, will you?
And get that brandy
I brought back from Moscow.
Annie, give us the best brand of brandy.
I remember her coming to visit you in the army.
We had to hunt you down when you were shacking up with that skinny bird.
What did you kick me for?
I know how to behave in company.
Can we smoke here?
Where are the sewage works around here?
I have to make an inspection.
Can you get up these stairs?
The one downstairs is blocked.
Don't worry.
I've also got a dragon at home.
A real old vampire.
How did they know those were our keys? Why did they come?
- Is this a pub or what?
- He can hear you.
I want him to hear me. Throw them out!
Is there or is there not a bottle standing there?
Did lightning strike your bog?
How come the seat caught fire?
Come and wash your hands.
I left my jacket in there.
Drink up.
The Comrade Deputy needs his sleep.
There's no need to rush, boys.
It's only 8:30pm in Australia.
One for the road.
Cheers!
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- So soon?
We can't accept those, comrade.
Ludvík's great!
I told you he's a brilliant guy.
If you see some guys hanging about, they're ours.
We did over next door.
You heard Klepáč, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Maybe the security guys are still there.
Did you see anyone in the garden?
- In the garden? No.
- They've probably called it a day.
Bye, guys!
These are the best looking girls from Broumov.
Well built, aren't they?
You don't think they're held up by scaffolding? Give him his award.
- We've brought you this from Broumov
- It's upside down.
So you can take some good measurements at home.
- Careful, the colour will come off.
- Where is this comrade from?
From our office.
She's game for anything.
They've locked her husband up for opening his big mouth.
We finally got her to divorce him.
You should come and visit us.
Did you have to give them the cake?
You would have given our house away!
You stuff those louts with our anniversary cake!
Forget the flaming cake.
I'm just happy things turned out the way they did.
You can clear up this mess.
I'm not touching anything.
I wouldn't expect you to.
If I want to eat off a clean plate,
I have to buy it first.
I'll buy you two cakes in the morning.
Go and change.
I'm in no mood to play the scarlet woman.
What did they say about Košara and Klepáč?
Why should they say anything?
They must have told you why they took them in.
Didn't you ask them anything?
I'll get you your things.
Where's your nightie?
At least one of you has to ask about Košara.
At least ask what has become of him!
Let the Ear hear this.
Always having to shut the door!
Even gypsies don't have to make love in the kitchen!
Not even the Hottentots do it on the floor!
We can go in the bedroom.
I don't like being recorded when I'm enjoying myself.
If they took Košara's wife, they'll have to let her go. She's got children.
Who would look after them?
She hasn't got anyone in Prague.
This is the last one.
Košara didn't want to submit the report.
You should tell someone.
- That would be a long story.
- Let's talk then. We can't sleep anyway.
Do I have to waffle on about it with you too?
Do I worry about your plans?
Where are my pills?
- Have you seen my pills?
- They wouldn't work for me anyway.
Don't play the martyr with me.
How often have I lain awake with you snoring away?
Why are you looking at me like that?
How should I know why they took them in?
Did I inform on Košara?
They could just as easily have taken me.
How do I know what order they do things in?
But while Košara's inside, they come here to live it up.
You know what?
Yeah. I shouldn't finish this bottle.
Because Luděk shouldn't see me in this state.
I remember all you've told me in the past ten years.
- It's only ten sentences anyway.
- Get stuffed.
Which makes it nine now.
Hey! That cigarette is mine.
Who's there?
- Who the hell are you phoning?
- I tried Košara's wife.
Some man answered.
He used the other phone to call the operator to find out who was calling.
They'll think I phoned Košara!
No, they won't. The Ear is listening!
Why would you want to call him if he's inside?
You're a big help!
Put that down!
That was not my husband phoning, it was me!
You said Košara needed you in Prague.
The truth is nobody wanted you in Olomouc.
You couldn't tell me where my pyjamas are?
Where you last left them.
In the bathroom, I suppose.
They're not in the bathroom.
Don't look for them in my bed!
Take the clean ones
I gave you for the prison.
Are we going to bed or will you keep on ranting?
Leave me alone.
I'm just talking to myself.
- You know who does that?
- The Comrade.
Košara came to protect you.
He gave you the job because the Secretariat pressed him to.
God knows who else pressed him on your behalf.
Košara was a little afraid of you, wasn't he?
It must have taken you a long time to think all this up.
Did you think all this up on your own?
Klepáč didn't like you, either.
He was clever. He wrote books.
Why have they never invited us over?
Why, I wonder?
Klepáč was also afraid of you.
Good night.
Do you know why they are all afraid of you?
You leave a trail of corpses behind you.
All you care about is yourself.
You don't even care about your own brother!
You didn't even tell personnel you had a brother because he was in England.
Help, he's beating me again!
Comrades, help me!
Do you want me to hit you?
Remember how you danced for President Beneš?
All the way from the station to the hotel!
And just for a change, you sang for Gottwald as well.
You sang all night until your voice was hoarse.
You would join any movement, of the right or left just to worm your way to the top!
That's right. Just slap me.
You're good at that!
You get drunk and start rambling on.
I know what I'm rambling about.
It suits you that I drink.
Haven't you got a tissue?
You're counting on me drinking myself to death.
One day you'll dump me in a loony bin.
That's what comrades do, don't they?
Even Comrade Stalin.
Stop this lunacy!
But it's me who always gets your brother out of trouble.
Who got him out of that jam?
He'd still be serving a nice long stretch!
So he would. But you wouldn't be doing what you're doing now.
Stop pretending that you're doing people favours.
You're not putting me under cold water.
I'll have a cold for ten days!
Do you want to go on bleeding all night?
Remember how the bed looked last time?
- Bend down. If you don't, it'll hurt.
- Bastard!
Is that how a teacher talks?
The school threw you out after two days.
Take a look at yourself.
This is how I look after ten years with you!
- So why did you marry such a bastard?
- You'll never understand.
But I'll tell you why you married me.
Let me go!
- Only if you bend down.
- I'll be all wet!
Bend down or I'll break your arm.
Why didn't you marry Jitka?
You had such a crush on that virgin!
Why did you marry me?
I'd slept with a whole football team!
You knew that!
Remember when I slept with you?
When Jitka stood you up!
Shut up!
My father owned a house with a pub.
He told everyone what dowry I'd get.
- To marry off his little whore!
- Shut up!
It's cold!
You bastard!
You shit!
To save your career, you didn't even break Jitka in!
You wanted my money to set up a building firm!
You didn't tell them you owned the firm!
- Please, stop!
- Only when you sober up!
- I'll drown you!
- You'd never do it.
You didn't even manage to keep the firm going.
Luckily, the coup of '48 brought you into politics.
Unlike many others, you're a failure at it!
It's a good thing you're competent!
Using the car for shopping, the hairdresser's...
They all know you sent the driver out for blueberries!
I'll look really shitty now!
Bend your head back!
Not with the one you rub your feet with!
Remember Victor?
The driver with the curly hair?
Go to bed. Do you know what time it is?
When you went to Moscow with that delegation for 20 days,
I gave him the time of his life.
Do you know where we started?
In the car in front of our house.
Now I know where all the money went.
It must have cost you a fortune.
- Why all the sudden interest?
- Go to bed.
I'll sleep in my room.
You don't have to do me any favours.
I'm not asking you for anything.
- Are you sleeping in the cellar?
- Because of you?
You're washing up now?
Look, the birds are already up outside.
Up yours! Go to bed!
Don't worry about little Annie.
Annie's not going to give you your little pleasures.
She's going to give you a hard time.
Look what I found.
What is it?
The Ear!
They wouldn't put it where we'd easily find it.
They'd know we'd find out!
What did we talk about in the kitchen?
We talked about everything in the kitchen.
How long do you think it's been there?
It couldn't have been that long.
It really stinks in here.
Can't you open a window?
There's one there as well.
The old one's gone!
Tondl's wife said that when they want to listen a green van has to be parked nearby.
It looks like a little postal van.
It has a special aerial.
It looks like a kind of...
Where can we talk?
Now, nowhere.
Let's go out on the balcony.
Why do you always lock the boy in?
If anything happened, he wouldn't be able to get out.
So he can't run riot about the house.
So he couldn't have got out of his room last night.
They put them there last night.
They were here before we came back.
We came back too early.
Do you remember that policeman?
Weren't you enjoying yourselves?
Number 117
- That's not my car.
- It is, Comrade Deputy.
I wanted to ask you something.
You've still got a little time to smarten up.
Am I some kind of chorus girl?
I've got a comb and the comrade will lend me a mirror.
I've still got a few hairs left, so I needn't worry.
Are you afraid the lens is going to crack?
I wanted to ask you something.
I haven't spoken to you yet, have I?
No.
Well, we can't change anything anyway.
They didn't come for booze.
They came to finish off the job.
They took the case away earlier.
It was definitely in the cellar.
Can't you write what you want?
Or read what you want?
You can do what you want.
As long as they don't hold something against you.
Something!
But that Standa's your pal from the army, isn't he?
When were we last in the army?
Years ago!
But tell me why?
Now they know everything about me.
Half wouldn't be enough.
They did a sloppy job on purpose.
We would have found them in the morning anyway.
No way will they wait till morning.
Now when they can't hear us they'll come rushing over!
Have you got a bottle tucked away somewhere?
Little Annie?
You've always got a bottle somewhere, haven't you?
I've got a bottle somewhere too.
Wait here.
Are you there?
Open the door!
Don't do it!
If you do it I'll do it too!
What did you want to do?
You couldn't have done it!
You couldn't do this to us!
You can't!
Where's your gun?
Give it to me.
Give me the gun.
You have to give it to me.
They took it away.
When they want to they'll do it themselves.
I won't let you go!
I'm staying with you.
They can lock me up too!
What are we?
Still human beings?
What do you want from us?
What do you want, Ear?
Do you want us to kill ourselves?
Shall we kill ourselves?
Even you, Ear, can't listen in the toilet!
Nor in the bathroom!
Nor the kitchen, do you hear?
Even functionaries can speak in the kitchen and toilet!
I threw your bugs down the loo!
I hope you send the plumbers round at last!
It's the bog downstairs!
We already reported it three times!
And a good day to you!
Come on, let him sleep.
No need to wake him up yet.
What did his teacher say about him?
He was one of the boys who spat on that picture.
No one told on him, but when they started investigating.
...he reported himself to the Head.
Did we drink to our anniversary?
It was yesterday. Today is the 18th.
Look, swallows!
I've never noticed them before!
Did you notice that nest?
That's when they come - between 4:00 and 5:00!
But it's the phone.
Speaking. Yes, comrade.
I see.
Of course.
Goodbye, comrade.
He appointed me Minister.
In Košara's place.
How could they do that if they heard everything?
Yes, they heard it.
I'm scared!

SOLARIS
Part One
Kris, come here!
You're just in time.
He takes a walk every morning for at least an hour.
I forbade him to come back earlier.
He's had a lot of work, sometimes staying up all night.
These Solarists!
He reminds me of a bookkeeper, preparing his accounts.
We expected you yesterday.
He wanted to run away when he saw me.
Hello.
Hello.
I probably shouldn't have bothered you today.
How old you and I have become.
I've only just realized that.
What are you apologizing for?
Does he understand that everything depends on his first report from the station?
Everything we've received so far has been confusing or incomprehensible.
If he confirms that the work can't continue for some reason, the station can be taken out of Solaris' orbit.
He understands.
You promised to talk to him.
I brought the film.
That's what I came here for.
- Yes, of course.
Can the boy stay with you for a few days?
I have a lot to do and no one to leave him with.
Anna will look after him.
She'll have more free time now.
When does he leave?
He'll be gone by tomorrow morning.
It's so pleasant here.
This house reminds me of my grandfather's house.
I really liked it.
So we decided to build one just like it.
I don't like innovation.
I'd better get going.
I have a lot to do.
Don't you want to see this?
I've already seen it many times.
On the 21st day of our expedition,
radio-biologist Vishyakov and physicist Fekhner
went on an exploratory flight over the Solaris Ocean in a hydroplane.
When they failed to return after
16 hours, we declared an emergency.
The fog was thick and we were forced to call the search off.
All of the rescue craft returned to the station
except for the helicopter operated by Burton.
Burton returned an hour after dark.
Once out of the helicopter, he ran to his quarters.
He was in a state of shock.
This was highly unusual
for a man with 11 years of experience flying in space.
He recovered in a couple of days,
but he would never leave the station
and refused to approach the window overlooking the Ocean.
Later he wrote to us from the clinic.
He was preparing a statement of great importance,
one that would decide the fate of Solaristics.
Excellent.
Let's hear what he has to say.
At this time, let us give the floor to Burton.
Thank you.
When I first descended below 300 meters,
I had trouble maintaining altitude.
There was a strong wind.
All of my attention went towards operating the ship.
I did not look out of the cabin.
As a result, I wound up in a fog.
- Was it an ordinary fog?
Of course not.
It seemed to be colloidal and viscous.
It coated all of the windows.
Because of the fog's resistance,
I began to lose altitude.
I couldn't see the sun,
but the fog glowed red in its direction.
After half an hour
I came out into a large, open space.
It was almost round, a few hundred meters across.
At that point,
I noticed a change in the Ocean.
The waves disappeared.
The surface became almost transparent, with clouded patches.
Yellow sludge gathered beneath it.
It rose up in thin strips and sparkled like glass.
Then it began to seethe, boil and harden.
It looked like molasses.
This sludge or slime gathered into large lumps
and slowly formed different shapes.
I was being drawn into the fog,
so I had to struggle against this for some time.
When I looked down again,
I saw a sort of garden.
A garden?
Attention, please.
I saw shrubs, hedges, acacia trees, little paths.
Everything was made of the same substance.
Did these trees and plants have leaves?
These shrubs and acacias?
No, I already said they were all made of plaster, but life-sized.
Then everything began to crack and break.
Yellow sludge poured out of the fissures.
Everything began to boil even harder, and foam appeared.
You can see for yourselves.
I used a camera from time to time.
Everything I saw before and after should be on film.
Then I propose we interrupt these discussions
and see everything with our own eyes.
All right, show us your film.
This is very interesting.
Is that it?
That's all of your film?
Yes, that's everything.
But we don't understand.
You filmed clouds.
Why did you film clouds?
That must be the fog
I told you about.
I wasn't expecting this.
All of this could be the result of Solaris' bio-magnetic current
acting on Burton's consciousness.
We now know the current is not only a gigantic cerebral system,
but a substance capable of thought processes.
That hypothesis is questionable.
Were you feeling sick that day?
The next part is meaningless.
Let's pick up here.
I discovered something floating in one of the openings.
It looked like Fechner's space suit.
Its shape was that of a person.
I turned around-
I didn't want to lose sight of that spot.
At that moment, the figure rose slightly,
as if it were swimming or treading the waves.
This person had no space suit, and he was moving.
I don't understand. "Person"?
Yes, person.
Just a minute.
Did you see his face?
Yes.
What person?
Who was it?
It was a child.
What child?
Had you seen him before?
No, never.
In any case, not that I remember.
When I flew closer to him,
I noticed something awful.
What do you mean?
I couldn't make it out at first.
Then I saw that he was unusually large. Gigantic.
He was about four meters tall.
He had blue eyes
and dark hair.
Perhaps you're not feeling well?
We'll postpone the meeting.
I'll continue.
He was naked, absolutely naked,
like a newborn.
He was wet, or rather, slippery.
His skin was shiny.
He rose and fell like the waves, but he was moving by himself.
It was disgusting.
I'm sorry.
I'll jump ahead a little.
There isn't much more.
Burton's statements appear to be the result of a hallucinatory complex
brought on by the planet's atmosphere,
as well as symptoms of depression
exacerbated by inflammation of the associative zone
of the cerebral cortex.
This report in no way, or in almost no way,
corresponds with reality.
What do you mean "almost"?
Excuse me, I'm not finished yet.
Professor Messenger offers a different opinion.
He believes that Burton's statements could be founded in reality
and merit further study.
That's it.
I saw it all with my own eyes.
I would like to offer another opinion.
We stand on the brink of an enormous discovery,
Our decision should not rely on the observations
of a man without any scientific qualifications.
Although any researcher may envy this pilot,
his presence of mind, his gift of observation.
Moreover, in light of recent information,
we are morally obligated to continue the exploration.
I can understand how Professor Messenger feels.
I understand him.
But let's take a look at the road we've traveled.
Solaristics is exactly where it began.
Years of work have been in vain.
Everything we now know about Solaris is negative
and has come to resemble a mountain of disjointed, incoherent facts
that strain credulity.
We're in exactly the same situation today.
Solaristics is degenerating.
But what we're talking about is far more serious
than just the study of Solaristics.
We're talking about the boundaries of human knowledge.
Don't you think that by establishing artificial barriers
we deliver a blow to the idea of limitless thought?
By limiting our movement forward, we facilitate moving backwards.
I nevertheless repeat my question.
What do you mean by saying
the report of my observations in almost no way corresponds with reality?
I saw everything with my own eyes.
What do you mean by "almost"?
"Almost no way" means that some real phenomena
could have triggered your hallucinations, Burton.
When it's windy,
it's easy to confuse a swaying bush with a living being,
to say nothing of a foreign planet.
I meant no offense, Burton.
None.
I'd like to know what impact
Professor Messenger's opinion will have.
Practically none,
which means that exploration in this area will be discontinued.
Just a moment. Yes...
I'd like to make a statement.
The commission has not offended me,
but it has offended the spirit of the expedition.
Therefore, I consider it my duty to announce...
And so on...
Nowadays it's considered good manners to laugh when Burton's report is mentioned.
Thank you, Burton.
We've known you for a long time, but I never knew anything about you.
You know, you were very handsome.
That's not true, but thanks anyway.
Excuse me.
Well, Kris, what do you think?
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak to your son alone.
I don't want to look like an idiot in front of you yet again.
I'll wait for you outside by the swing.
What a ridiculous man.
You have no reason to say that.
He's ill at ease.
He thinks he's getting in the way of our farewell.
He's a tactful man.
If he decided to come, it's because he considers this important.
Although, I admit,
I'd rather not see anyone now.
You and I rarely get a chance to talk.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Even if it's on the last day.
The last day.
One always feels awful after a big farewell.
Here comes your aunt.
Let's meet after lunch.
We need to talk.
Why did you have to invite this Burton today of all days?
Where are the guests going to sleep?
Next to you, or in the room upstairs?
Upstairs, I guess.
Well, I'm off to my meeting by the swing.
- Maybe...
- Just a moment.
You and your rooms can wait!
Listen, Kris...
What happened?
- What's standing over there?
- What are you afraid of?
In the garage, staring at me.
It's a horse.
Don't. I've seen it already.
Come on.
He's gentle.
Look how beautiful he is.
You understand, I think
Solaristics has reached an impasse as a result of irresponsible daydreaming.
I'm interested in the truth, but you want to turn me into a biased supporter.
I don't have the right to make decisions based on impulses of the heart.
I'm not a poet.
I have a concrete goal:
Either stop the research and remove the station from orbit, thereby legitimizing the Solaristics crisis, or take extreme measures.
Perhaps bombard the Ocean with heavy radiation.
- Not that!
- Why not?
Didn't you say research should continue at any price?
You want to destroy that which we are presently incapable of understanding?
Forgive me, but I am not an advocate of knowledge at any price.
Knowledge is only valid when it's based on morality.
Man is the one who renders science moral or immoral.
Remember Hiroshima.
Then don't make science immoral.
It's strange...
Strange.
There's nothing strange about it.
You yourself can't be sure that what you saw wasn't just hallucinations.
Thank you very much.
It's seems there's nothing more to discuss.
- What happened?
- I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
He's an accountant, not a scientist.
You were right.
You and I are friends, but that doesn't mean you can say that about him.
Great. You and I have known each other for 20 years. It had to end someday.
Are you leaving the boy?
What did you have to offend him for?
You're too harsh.
It's dangerous to send people like you into space.
Everything there is too fragile.
Yes, fragile!
The Earth has somehow become adjusted to people like you, although at what sacrifice!
What, are you jealous that he'll be the one to bury me, and not you?
Thus, it had been established that the Solaris Ocean is a distinctive brain.
Right after that, an even more daring hypothesis came out,
suggesting that the Ocean is a thinking substance.
Incidentally, this hypothesis
still cannot be confirmed or refuted.
It's a program about Solaris.
There are few believers left.
First of all, there are those connected to the fate of the Solaris station.
On this huge station built to house 85 people
there is now a crew of three.
They are: astro-biologist Sartorius,
cyberneticist Snaut,
and physiologist Gibarian, who deal with the problem...
I'm calling from the city.
Burton.
Anna, leave for a minute.
We need to talk.
I didn't talk to Kris about what was most important:
about Messenger, who voiced a different opinion at that meeting.
He became very interested in Fechner, who died in the Solaris Ocean.
It turns out that Fechner has an orphaned son.
He had left his family.
Messenger and I paid a visit to Fechner's widow,
and I saw this boy with my own eyes.
You never told me about that.
I never got the chance.
Fine. Go on.
This child was identical to the one I saw on Solaris.
Of course, he wasn't four meters tall.
He shouldn't think about this too much before liftoff,
but he should keep it in mind.
There's no point in keeping these papers.
The ones to hold on to are in my room.
My research notes, my thesis...
I held on to so much.
If something should happen,
I'll find someone to take care of them.
I'll come up with something.
Don't look for that film.
I'm taking it with me.
Remember?
The one of the bonfire?
Yes, of course.
- Ready, Kelvin?
- Ready, Moddard.
Don't worry about a thing.
Have a great trip.
Send our regards.
- When is liftoff?
- You're already flying, Kris! Take care.
Solaris station! Do something!
I'm losing stability.
This is Kelvin, over.
Hey, where is everyone?
You've got guests.
Dr. Snaut?
Snaut?
I'm Kelvin, the psychologist.
It looks like you weren't expecting me.
Did you receive the radiogram?
Yes, of course.
What's with you?
Forgive me.
Where's Gibarian?
Where's Sartorius?
Sartorius is in his quarters.
Gibarian is dead.
What do you mean "dead"?
Suicide.
I beg your pardon.
I knew Gibarian and he would never have...
He was almost always in a state of deep depression ever since these disturbances began...
Why don't you go rest, take a bath?
Take any room and come back in an hour.
I would like to see Gibarian -
I mean, Sartorius.
Later.
I doubt he'd see you now.
He's upstairs, in the laboratory.
Listen, Snaut,
I understand that something extraordinary has happened and maybe...
Dr. Kelvin...
You understand...
Come back in an hour. Please.
Go and rest.
Listen, there are only three of us: you, me and Sartorius.
You know us from our photographs.
If you see something out of the ordinary, something besides me and Sartorius, try not to lose your head.
What would I see?
I don't know.
That sort of depends on you.
Hallucinations?
No. Just remember.
- Remember what?
- That we're not on Earth.
You know, it would be better if you came back in the evening, or at night.
No, let's make it tomorrow morning.
A. GIBARIAN
HUMAN BEING
FOR K. KELVIN
Hi, Kris.
I still have a little time left.
There are some things
I must tell you,
and some things
I must warn you about.
By now you're at the station and know what happened to me.
If not, Snaut or Sartorius will tell you.
What happened to me...
is not important.
Or rather, it cannot be explained.
I'm afraid that what happened to me is only the beginning.
I wouldn't, of course, want it to happen...
but this could happen to you and the others.
Here, it could probably happen to anyone.
Just don't think that I've lost my mind.
I'm of sound mind, Kris.
Believe me.
After all, you know me.
If I have enough time,
I'll tell you why I did everything.
I'm telling you this so that, if it does happen to you,
you'll know it's not madness.
That's the most important thing.
As for continuing research,
I'm leaning towards
Sartorius' proposal,
subjecting the Ocean's plasma to heavy radiation.
I know it's prohibited, but there's no other choice.
We...
You will get mired in it.
It may offer a way of breaking this deadlock.
This is our only chance to make contact with this monster.
There is no other choice, Kris.
If...
Dr. Sartorius, I am Kelvin.
I arrived two hours ago.
Listen, this is ridiculous.
Either open up or I'll break down the door.
All right, I'll open the door, but don't come in.
I'll come out.
- Fine.
My name is Kelvin.
Go on.
You must have heard of me.
I work, or worked, with Gibarian.
Go on.
Snaut told me about Gibarian.
Then you already know the story.
Yes, it's horrible.
I don't know the details, but he's dead.
That's not the problem.
We all die.
But he insisted on being buried on Earth.
Is space really such a bad grave for him?
But Gibarian wanted to be in the ground, with the worms.
I wanted to disregard it, but Snaut insisted.
- Have you ever heard of Burton?
- He was the pilot who...
Yes, he was in the search party for Fechner.
Fechner died a magnificent death, but Gibarian was a coward.
There's no point talking badly of him now.
It's at least worth talking about duty.
Duty to whom?
- To truth.
- You mean to people.
You won't find truth there. Look.
Your position is absurd.
Your so-called courage is inhuman!
You hear me?
Go away.
You're too impressionable.
You must get used to everything.
Good day.
I spoke to Sartorius.
He's a rotten person.
He's a very talented scientist.
I think I'm a little sick.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You just won't take advice.
Snaut, aside from the three of us, is there anyone else on the station?
Did you see someone?
What were you warning me about?
Whom did you see?
Was it a human being?
Is she real?
Can she be touched? Wounded?
You saw her today.
And you?
Who the hell are you?
Quiet.
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone.
You're afraid.
Don't worry.
I won't think you're insane.
Insane?
God, you know absolutely nothing!
Insane...
That would be a blessing.
Listen, Snaut...
It's all so senseless.
They won't understand me.
They think I've gone crazy.
Do you see, Kris, how it's not entirely absurd?
I have to do this because
I'm afraid they'll come in here.
I mean Snaut and Sartorius.
They themselves don't understand what they're doing.
I'm afraid, Kris...
I can't...
Nobody will be able to understand.
Open up! You hear, Gibarian?
Open up!
Don't be stupid.
It's just us - Snaut and Sartorius.
We want to help you.
They want to help me.
Just a second. Quit knocking.
I am my own judge.
Have you seen her?
Kris, understand that this is not madness.
It has something to do with conscience.
I really wanted you to get here in time, Kris.
Where did you?
It's so nice.
But... but it's not...
How did you know where I?
What do you mean, "how"?
Don't, Kris. That tickles.
Where are my shoes?
- Shoes?
No. They're not there.
Who's this?
Kris... it's me.
You know...
I have the feeling... as if I've forgotten something.
I can't understand it.
Do you love me?
Don't be silly, Hari.
As if you didn't know.
I'm going out for a moment.
Wait for me, okay?
- I'll go with you.
- No, Hari. I'll be back soon.
No.
What's with you? Why?
I don't know. I can't.
You can't what?
It feels like I...
I have to see you... all the time.
What are you, a child?
I have work to do, Hari.
I'm behaving foolishly.
And so are you.
Running around all disheveled, like Snaut.
- Like who?
- Like Snaut.
Listen, how do you...
Well, I have to go.
If you want, we can go together.
But you won't be able to get into a suit with your dress on.
Get undressed.
Kris, help me. I can't undo it.
Why are you looking at me like that?
SOLARIS
Part Two
Get in.
- What about you?
- I'm right behind you.
I have to shut the hatch.
Is everything all right?
Are you comfortable?
Yes. Hurry, Kris.
You could at least knock.
It sounded like you were talking to someone.
All the more reason.
So you had guests?
Well, I see you took good care of them.
It's nothing.
You won't die from it.
Did you at least start out modestly?
Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?
If you plan to clown around, you might as well leave.
Sometimes you become a clown without wanting to.
Don't tell me you haven't tried a rope or a hammer.
Did you happen to throw the inkwell like Luther? No?
So, one, two, and into the rocket, and that was that.
Next time, don't panic.
And push the button from the corridor.
You could get burned.
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Then again, we've managed to determine a few things.
Who was it?
She died 10 years ago.
What you saw was the materialization of your conception of her.
What was her name?
- Hari.
Everything began after we started experimenting with radiation.
We hit the Ocean's surface with strong X-ray beams.
But it...
Incidentally, consider yourself lucky.
After all, she's a part of your past.
What if it had been something you had never seen before, but something you had thought or imagined?
I don't understand.
Evidently the Ocean responded to our heavy radiation with something else.
It probed our minds and extracted something like islands of memory.
Will she come back?
She will... and she won't.
- Hari the Second.
- There may be an endless number of them.
Why didn't you warn me?
You wouldn't have believed me.
I got scared and acted not entirely...
Don't be hard on yourself.
We've had enough of Gibarian.
There's talk about liquidating the station.
That's why I was sent here.
If I submit a report, will you sign it?
And what if we suddenly make that long-awaited contact?
Night is the best time here.
It somehow reminds me of Earth.
Attach strips of paper to the air-vents.
At night it sounds like the rustling of leaves.
It was Gibarian's invention.
So simple, like all genius.
I adopted it right away.
Sartorius made fun of us, but he has one in his room.
He hides it in the closet.
You should rest.
If you can, come to the library later.
I've prepared a list of books for you.
Snaut, is that you?
Kris, where are you?
Come here.
- It's so dark.
- Come here. Don't be afraid.
Hari!
The door opens the other way.
Hang on.
I'll be right back.
When I saw you weren't there,
I got scared.
Hello, Kris.
I can barely hear you.
Speak louder.
What are you doing right now?
Nothing.
Sartorius has invited us to his laboratory.
How are you?
Fine. I'll try to make it.
Kris, what's wrong with me?
Maybe it's epilepsy?
This is my wife.
Hello.
Hello.
- We've been waiting for you.
- I was busy.
- How lovely! Are these yours?
- No, they're Snaut's.
So, as far as I can tell, they are constructed...
Let's just call them "guests."
Fine.
While our structure is made of atoms, theirs consists of neutrinos.
But neutrino systems are unstable.
They seem to be stabilized by Solaris' force field.
You've got a superb specimen.
That's my wife.
Wonderful. Perfect.
Then take a blood sample from your wife.
Why?
It'll sober you up a bit.
What do you think?
- Snaut?
- Enough of all of you!
I burned the blood with acid, but it's restoring itself.
Regeneration?
In essence, immortality-
Faust's problem.
Excuse me.
There's no need for cotton.
Are you qualified to perform an autopsy?
I've already told you -she's my wife.
Don't you understand?
I think these experiments are more humane than testing on rabbits.
Don't you agree?
It doesn't matter.
It would be like cutting my own leg off.
Did you feel pain when you broke through the door?
Pain? Of course.
So if I ever catch you doing anything...
- You're lucky.
- How so?
It's meaningless, yet you've managed to establish emotional contact with them.
It may be pleasant...
- What are you, jealous?
Maybe I'm jealous.
No, you're not jealous.
After all, you're not guilty of anything.
- Of course.
- But I am guilty.
Of what?
When you turn into an utter cripple with no arms or legs, call us.
We'll empty your chamber pot.
- But whom have you wronged?
- You, among others.
My father shot that.
Well, I shot a bit.
Listen...
I don't know myself at all.
I don't remember.
When I close my eyes,
I can't recall my face. And you?
What?
- Do you know yourself?
- Like all humans.
That woman in the white coat hated me.
Don't make things up.
She died before you and I met.
I don't understand why you're deceiving me.
I remember perfectly.
We drank tea and she kicked me out.
Naturally, I stood up and left.
I remember perfectly.
What happened after that?
After that, I went away, and we never saw each other again.
Where did you go?
To a different city.
- Why?
- I was transferred.
Why did you leave without me?
You didn't want to come.
That I remember.
Forgive me.
I thought you were already awake.
What happened?
The regeneration is slowing down.
For two or three hours we can be free of them.
You came in the middle of the night to tell me that?
I'll tell you why I came.
Sartorius and I were thinking:
If the Ocean derives guests from us while we dream, maybe it makes sense to transmit our waking thoughts to it.
- How?
- With beams of radiation.
Perhaps it will understand and spare us from all these apparitions.
Again these ridiculous X-ray sermons about the greatness of science?
We'll modulate the beam with the brain waves of one of us.
And "one of us" means me, of course.
An encephalogram!
A transcription of all my thoughts!
What if I suddenly want her to die?
To disappear!
Entrust everything to that... that mass of jelly?
It's already invaded my soul.
Kris, we're running out of time.
Sartorius has proposed another project: the annihilator.
Self-destruction of the neutrino systems.
What is this? Blackmail?
I convinced him to start with the encephalogram.
But forget about this for now.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Consider yourself invited.
- Liar! You just want to make up with us.
- Yes, I do.
Don't shout. She sleeping.
Sleeping?
She's already learned how to sleep?
This will all end badly.
- Well, what do you propose I do?
- Nothing.
So you'll come?
Tomorrow, in the library.
We'll set the table.
At least there are no windows in there.
In the meantime, let's go.
Sartorius is waiting.
She's sleeping.
Will she follow me?
Don't lock the door.
What door?
It's just an apparition.
Wait. I'll be right back.
Where are you going?
Forgive me.
Why aren't you asleep?
- You don't love me.
- Stop it, Hari.
- We have to talk.
- About what?
You understand that I don't know where I came from.
Maybe you know?
- What's with you?
Stop. Don't interrupt.
If you know, but you can't tell me now, perhaps one day you will.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand a thing, honestly.
You don't want to tell me.
You're afraid.
Then I'll tell you.
I'm not Hari.
Hari is dead.
She poisoned herself.
I'm somebody else.
Who told you this?
- Sartorius just told me.
- Last night.
It would have been better if you had told me yourself.
My God, what's the difference?
How have you lived all this time?
Were you in love with anyone?
I don't know.
Did you ever think of me?
Yes, but not all the time.
Only when I felt unhappy.
You know, it feels like somebody is tricking us.
And the longer this fog lasts, the worse it will be for you in the end.
Particularly for you, Kris.
How can I help you?
Tell me.
And her, the other one, what happened to her?
We argued.
Towards the end, we argued a lot.
I gathered my things and left.
She made me understand without saying it directly, but when you live with someone for a long time, such things aren't necessary.
I was sure they were just words, but then I remembered that I'd left the laboratory specimens in the refrigerator.
I had brought them from the laboratory and explained how they worked.
I got scared.
I wanted to go to her.
But then I thought it would look like
I had taken her words seriously.
After three days, I couldn't take it anymore and I went to see her.
When I got there, she was already dead.
There was a needle mark on her arm.
Like this?
Why did she do it?
She probably sensed that I didn't really love her.
But now I do.
- Kris.
- What?
I love you.
Get some sleep.
I don't know how to sleep.
It's not sleep.
It's somehow around me.
It's as if it weren't just inside of me, but much farther away.
It's probably still sleep.
So, it looks like our guest of honor isn't showing up.
- Why?
- Maybe he has guests.
Oh, everyone's already here?
You're an hour and a half late.
What's that you're reading?
It's all rubbish.
Rubbish.
Where the hell is...
Here!
"They come at night.
But one must sleep sometime."
That's the problem.
Mankind has lost the ability to sleep.
You'd better read.
I'm a little excited.
"I know only one thing, señor.
When I...
When I sleep, I know no fear, no hope, no trouble, no bliss.
Blessings on him who invented sleep.
The common coin that purchases all things, the balance that levels shepherd and king, fool and wise man.
There is only one bad thing about sound sleep.
They say it closely resembles death."
"Never before, Sancho, have I heard you speak so elegantly as now."
That's great, but perhaps you'll let me say something now?
I propose a toast to Snaut, to his bravery, to his devotion to duty.
To science and to Snaut.
Science? Nonsense.
In this situation, mediocrity and genius are equally useless.
We have no interest in conquering any cosmos.
We want to extend the Earth to the borders of the cosmos.
We don't know what to do with other worlds.
We don't need other worlds.
We need a mirror.
We struggle for contact, but we'll never find it.
We're in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal that he fears, that he has no need for.
Man needs man.
Let's drink to Gibarian.
To his memory.
Even though he got frightened.
No, Gibarian was not frightened.
There are worse things.
He died of hopelessness.
He thought all this was happening only to him.
My God!
All these heartbreaking lamentations are nothing but second-rate Dostoyevsky.
Who are you to judge?
I know why I'm here.
I'm working.
Man was created by nature so he could learn her ways.
In his endless search for the truth, man is condemned to knowledge.
Everything else is whim.
Permit me to ask, my esteemed colleague:
Why have you come to Solaris?
- What do you mean, why?
- Well, are you working a lot?
Forgive me, but aside from the romance with your ex-wife, nothing seems to interest you.
You spend all day lounging in a bed of noble thoughts, and that's how you carry out your duty.
You've lost touch with reality.
Forgive me, but you're simply a loafer.
Enough!
Let's try to be pleasant.
We'll drink to Gibarian.
Not to Gibarian, but to Man.
Are you saying
Gibarian was not a man?
Stop it, Kris.
Let's not fight.
After all, it's my birthday.
It's my day.
Of course.
I think that Kris Kelvin is more consistent than both of you.
In inhuman conditions, he has behaved humanely.
And you act as if none of this concerns you, and consider your guests - it seems that's what you call us - something external, a hindrance.
But it's a part of you.
It's your conscience.
And Kris loves me.
Maybe it's not me he loves, but he's simply protecting himself.
He wants me alive.
That's not the point.
It doesn't matter why man loves.
It's different for everyone.
It's not Kris.
It's you.
I hate you all.
- I would ask you...
Please don't interrupt me.
I'm a woman, after all.
You're not a woman and you're not a human being.
Understand that, if you're capable of understanding anything.
There is no Hari. She's dead.
You're just a reproduction, a mechanical reproduction.
A copy. A matrix.
Yes.
Maybe.
But I...
I am becoming a human being.
I can feel just as deeply as you.
Believe me.
I can already get by without him.
I... love him.
I am a human being.
You... you're very cruel.
Get up! Get up right now!
My dear man.
Nothing could be easier.
We've wasted time arguing.
We're losing our dignity and human character.
No.
You're human, each in your own way.
That's why you argue.
I hope I'm not bothering you.
You're a good man... but you look awful.
I've really lost heart.
Help me out a bit.
Doesn't a man who's ready to give up his life just to make cursed contact in order to know more about it have the right to get drunk?
He has every right.
Do you believe in our mission, Kelvin?
I'm not going to bed yet.
It's important not to fall asleep.
I'm going to see Faust.
In the laboratory, our Faust-
Sartorius - is seeking a remedy for immortality.
While we...
Listen, let's open these hatches and shout down below.
It would suddenly hear.
But what should we call it?
Maybe we should whip it.
Or, better yet, pray to it.
What's wrong?
I think I shut the door to the library.
She's there alone.
Go. I feel better already.
The station is changing its orbit.
At 5 a.m. there will be
30 seconds of weightlessness.
Don't forget.
Forgive me, my darling.
I was lost in thought.
Is something wrong?
No, nothing.
Everything's fine.
She drank liquid oxygen.
She did it out of despair.
It'll get worse.
The more she's with you, the more human she'll become.
Learn from Sartorius' example.
- Thanks for the advice.
What do you intend to do?
Wait until she returns.
And then what?
Leave the station?
Kris, she can only live here, on the station. You know that.
What can I do?
I love her.
- Which one?
Her, or the one in the rocket?
You can pull her in from space.
She will appear again and she'll keep appearing.
Don't turn a scientific problem into a common love story.
I had a feeling this would end badly.
You should help her.
What a ghastly sight.
I can never get used to all these resurrections.
Is it me?
Hari...
What?
Why?
Why?
No, it's not me.
It's... I'm... not Hari...
And you... Maybe you...
- Don't, Hari.
- I'm not Hari!
Fine!
Maybe your appearance is supposed to be torture.
Maybe it's a favor from the Ocean.
What does it matter when you're worth more to me than any science could ever be?
Do I look a lot like her?
No, you looked like her.
But now you -and not her- are the real Hari.
Tell me...
Do I disgust you? I'm so...
I disgust you!
- No, Hari. That's not true.
- You're lying!
- It's not true. Stop it.
- I must be disgusting!
- Stop it.
Don't touch me!
I love you.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm not going back to Earth.
I'll live here with you on the station.
You know...
I'm afraid.
It looks like it's showing some activity.
Your encephalogram helped.
You know... whenever we show pity, we ravage ourselves.
Maybe it's true...
Suffering makes life seem dismal and suspect.
But I won't accept that.
No, I won't accept that.
Is that which is indispensable to life also harmful to it?
No, it's not harmful.
Of course it's not harmful.
Remember Tolstoy?
His suffering over the impossibility of loving mankind as a whole?
How much time has passed since then?
Somehow I can't figure it out.
Help me.
See, I love you.
But love is a feeling we can experience but never explain.
One can explain the concept.
You love that which you can lose:
Yourself, a woman, a homeland.
Until today, love was simply unattainable to mankind, to the Earth.
Do you understand me, Snaut?
There are so few of us.
A few billion altogether. A handful!
Maybe we're here in order to experience people as a reason for love.
He seems to have a fever.
How did Gibarian die?
You still haven't told me.
I'll tell you. Later.
Gibarian didn't die of fear.
He died of shame.
Shame-the feeling that will save mankind.
Mama, I...
I'm two hours late.
I know.
How was your trip?
Fine. I'm a little tired, but it was fine.
My God, it's running slow again.
I'll go adjust it.
You've got plenty of time.
You know, it's really embarrassing, but for some reason...
I've completely forgotten your face.
You don't look well.
Are you happy?
Somehow that concept seems irrelevant here.
That's really a pity.
I'm very lonesome now.
Why do you hurt our feelings?
What have you been waiting for?
Why haven't you called?
You're leading some sort of strange life.
You're filthy and unkempt.
How did you make such a mess of yourself?
What's this?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
How are you?
Everything all right?
Where's Hari?
What's that?
There's no more Hari.
"Kris, it's terrible that I had to deceive you, but there was no other way.
This is best for both of us.
I asked them myself.
You mustn't blame anyone.
Hari."
She did it for you.
Snaut, listen.
Later, Kris. Calm down.
How... how did it...
The annihilator?
A burst of light and wind.
Yes.
Things weren't working out between us towards the end.
Listen, Snaut.
Why are we being tortured like this?
In my opinion, we have lost our sense of the cosmic.
The ancients understood it perfectly.
They never would have asked why or what for.
Remember the myth of Sisyphus.
Since we transmitted your encephalogram, none of the guests have come back.
Something incomprehensible is starting to take place in the Ocean.
Islands have begun to form on the surface.
First one. Then the next day there were several more.
Are you trying to tell me that it understood us?
That quickly?
But at least there's hope, eh, Kris?
- How old are you?
- Fifty-two. Why?
Have you been here long?
- You must have seen my forms.
- I did.
Listen, having spent so many years here on the station, do you still feel a clear connection to your life down there?
You like dire questions.
Soon you'll ask me about the meaning of life.
Wait. Don't be ironic.
It's a banal question.
When man is happy, the meaning of life and other eternal themes rarely interest him.
These questions should be asked at the end of one's life.
But we don't know when life will end.
That's why we're in such a hurry.
Don't rush.
The happiest people are those who are not interested in these cursed questions.
To ask is always the desire to know.
Yet the preservation of simple human truths requires mystery.
The mysteries of happiness, death and love.
Maybe you're right, but try not to think about all that now.
To think about it is to know the day of one's death.
Not knowing that day makes us practically immortal.
Fine, then.
In any event, my mission is finished.
But what next?
Return to Earth?
Little by little, everything will return to normal.
I'll even find new interests and acquaintances.
But I won't be able to give myself to them fully.
Never.
Do I have the right to turn down
even an imagined possibility of contact with this Ocean
which my race has been trying to understand for decades?
Should I remain here?
Among things and objects we both touched?
Which still bear the memory of our breath?
What for?
In the hope that she'll return?
But I don't harbor this hope.
The only thing left for me
is to wait.
I don't know what for.
New miracles?
Are you tired?
No, I feel great.
You know, Kris...
I think it's time you returned to Earth.
You think so?
THE END
On Monday morning, a patient named Guernsey, male, middle 70s, was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest pains.
He had been referred by a nursing home, where the doctor had diagnosed his condition as Angina pectoris.
It is axiomatic that nursing-home doctors are always wrong.
The intern who admitted
Mr. Guernsey, however, accepted the diagnosis and prescribed morphine, a drug suitable for angina, but not at all suitable for emphysema, which is unfortunately what the old man actually had.
Within an hour, the patient became unresponsive and diaphoretic and was raced up to Intensive Care, with an irregular pulse of 150, blood pressure 90 over 60, respiration rapid and shallow.
The resident on duty in Intensive Care compounded the blunder by treating the old man for pulmonary edema.
He gave him digitalis, diuretics and oxygen.
This restored the old man's color.
He was sent to his room in the Holly Pavilion, ruddy-complected and peacefully asleep.
But the patient was in CO2 narcosis, and died at 7:30 that evening.
I mention all this only to explain how the bed in Room 806 became available.
The intern involved was a prickly young buck named Schaefer who had a good thing going for him with a technician in the Hematology Lab.
In the haphazard fashion of hospital romances,
Dr. Schaefer had been zapping this girl on wheelchairs, stretchers, pantry shelves, in the kitchen, in the morgue, in the dark corners of corridors, standing up, sitting down.
So you can imagine what an available bed meant to him.
Sheila, this is Howard.
I got a bed for us for tonight.
A real, honest-to-God bed.
Dr. Schaefer?
Did you know that Dr. Schaefer was in Room 806 because he's dead?
What?
I'm just telling you that Dr. Schaefer is dead.
- What do you want, Perez?
- I don't know what this is about, but Dr. Schaefer is in Room 806 with an IV running, and he's dead.
- I didn't even know he was sick.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Do you know what she's talking about?
- No.
Maybe I'm going crazy. I don't know.
Isn't Room 806 the patient Guernsey?
Did something happen that maybe I didn't know about?
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is the nuttiest thing I ever saw.
Dr. Schaefer is in Room 806, dead.
What Dr. Schaefer? Our Dr. Schaefer?
Our Dr. Schaefer. The one who's always grabbing everybody's ass.
- Do you know what she's talking about?
- No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean,
"Dr. Schaefer's in Room 806, dead"?
I mean, he's lying on the far bed, stone dead, and with an IV.
If you don't believe me, you ought to go and look for yourself.
Maybe you'd better call Mrs. Christie.
Dr. Bock.
Yes, Mrs. Christie, what is it?
It's all right. I'd have to be getting up any minute, anyway.
Sorry, I missed that.
Would you say it again, please?
I know.
Schaefer, the stud with the glasses, fancies all the nurses.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
What do you mean?
Was he sick?
I mean.
What was the cause of death?
Was he being treated? I don't understand.
What was he doing in the bed?
You did say.
Mrs. Christie, did you call the office?
Good, I'll...
It's all right.
I'd be getting my wake-up call any minute, anyway.
People!
What do you say, Sundstrom?
How long do you think your monopolistic, exclusionary, racist policies will work?
...flee their homes!
Now, hold it.
Herb! I'm glad I caught up with you.
How's it going?
One of my interns dropped dead this morning.
Really? I'm sorry to hear that.
I understand you moved out to a hotel.
- Things got that bad with Phyllis?
- It's been that bad for 24 years.
You gonna be solicitous?
God.
I'm the guy that brought you into this hospital, so I think I can skip the diplomatic overtures.
Marty stopped me in the hall yesterday, very upset.
He had just had lunch with you.
He said you sounded suicidal.
Marty tends to be extravagant, but he's not the only one.
Jack Singer mentioned that you were boozing it up a lot.
Let's face it, you have been sloughing off.
I understand you haven't even been doing rounds.
I'm going to do rounds today.
Do you want to take a couple of days off?
Go down to Montego Bay, get drunk, get laid, get a little sun?
For God's sake, I'm 53 years old, with all the attendant fears.
I just left my wife, after 24 years.
A standard case of menopausal melancholy.
Maybe you wanna see Einhorn.
Don't wanna see a psychiatrist, don't worry.
If I just get to work, I'll be fine.
I'm sorry if I caused you concern.
Sid called from St. Luke's.
He said the demonstrators there
- are planning a march to join those here.
- God.
- Did you call the cops?
- Sure.
- They're all in 806, Doctor.
- What happened?
I think I'll just let Mrs. Christie tell you about it.
Oh, boy, what happened?
I've seen some pretty good SNAFUs, but this one...
There's a certain splendor to this one.
One of the night nurses thought he was a patient and plugged an IV into him.
He was a diabetic.
What do you mean she plugged an IV into him?
It's a really screwed-up story.
We had an old man in there who died last night.
So the bed was available.
You know Schaefer. He's Sammy Stud.
He talked a nurse into zapping him on the bed?
A girl from Hematology he's been running around with.
- God, it's a Roman farce!
- I thought I heard you out here.
I suggest you do that right now.
I'm so terribly sorry.
As I understand it, a nurse inadvertently administered an IV to Schaefer. How could that happen?
- We ought to straighten this out elsewhere.
- Very good idea.
Oh, God, what a mess!
- These things happen.
- I'd better call the Medical Examiner.
- I still don't understand what happened.
- It took us an hour to get it sorted out.
A patient named Guernsey died last night, in 806.
That information wasn't given to the night nurses. These things happen.
At any rate, according to the Kardex, the patient, Guernsey, was down for 25 mg of Sparine at q. 6h.
Mrs. Reardon sent Nurse Perez to give him his 12:00 shot.
In the meantime, Dr. Schaefer usurped that particular bed for his own purposes.
Dr. Brubaker suggests it was for a love tryst and some weight is given that hypothesis
- by the fact that Dr. Schaefer was naked.
- I get the drift.
Nurse Perez went in and sedated Dr. Schaefer thinking it was the patient Guernsey.
What I don't understand...
May I finish, please?
After Perez gave him his shot, she noticed the IV was pinched off on the bed.
She reported this to Mrs. Reardon who then assigned Nurse Rivers to restart the IV.
Rivers was a float. She didn't even know the staff people on the floor.
Nobody knew what the patient looked like, since he'd only been admitted that morning.
- So she plugged an IV into him.
- Yes.
- How much?
- A liter.
Five percent glucose solution won't kill anybody.
Was he dehydrated?
Did he have any ancillary conditions?
Didn't anybody bother to go check on him during the night?
Even under the impression that he was merely a patient?
Was he hyperosmolar?
Did he have a bad heart?
He must have had some sort of thrombosis.
I want the post done here, Mr. Hitchcock.
You and I better have a chat about your excessive use of float nurses.
I've got nearly a thousand nurses in this hospital...
Every time one of them has her period, she disappears for three days.
Doctors complain they can't find the same nurse on the same floor two days in a row.
What am I gonna tell Schaefer's parents?
That a substitute nurse assassinated him as she couldn't tell the doctors from the patients on the floor?
My God!
The incompetence here is absolutely radiant!
Two nurses walk into a room and stick needles in a man and one of those is a Number 18 Jelco, tourniquet the poor guy, anchor the poor guy's arm with adhesive tape, and it's the wrong poor son of a bitch!
Where do you train your nurses,
Mrs. Christie? Dachau?
All right.
Wrap him up and get him down to Pathology.
I'm especially interested in his blood sugar.
A liter of glucose never killed anybody.
Your ladies must have done something else.
- Will there be anything else?
- No.
Before you call the family,
I wish you'd speak to Mr. Mead about this.
We'd like, naturally, to avoid litigation.
A few things have been piling up.
Would you like to go into them?
A quickie.
Dr. Esterhazy wants to start hiring temporary people to cover the summer vacations.
He says, last year, some of the replacement people didn't receive their checks until they waited six months.
He wonders if you could do something about getting these people paid promptly.
Ms. Aronivici complains the lab reports are coming in slow into the ER.
I called Dr. Immelman about that, and she says three microscopes have been stolen out of her lab in the last two months.
Charlie Walters also complains about pilferage.
I've clumped all these together for you.
As you know we've agreed to take over the local ambulance cases as part of the hospital's commitment to the community and it's created a serious overload in ER.
I don't know why this was dumped in our lap, but they seem to think...
Find out if Dr. Einhorn is in his office.
Which Dr. Einhorn?
- Ophthalmology or Psychiatry?
- Psychiatry. Never mind. I'll look in, myself.
Is he in?
- Can I have a minute, Joe?
- Of course.
I've been having periods of acute depression recently.
Apparently, it's becoming noticeable.
A number of people have remarked about it.
John Sundstrom thought it might be a good idea if I spoke to you about it.
- Do you want to sit down?
- No. I'm not good at confessional.
What can I tell you?
The last year, two, three.
It goes way back, I suppose.
I remember entertaining suicidal thoughts as a college student.
At any rate,
I've always found life demanding.
I'm an only child of a lower-middle-class people.
I was the glory of my parents.
"My son, the doctor." You know.
I was always top of my class.
Scholarship to Harvard. The boy genius.
The brilliant eccentric.
Terrified of women, clumsy at sports.
God, how do I go about this?
I understand you just separated from your wife.
I left her a dozen times.
She left me a dozen times.
We stayed through a process of attrition.
Obviously, sadomasochistic dependency.
My home is hell.
We've got a 23-year-old boy.
I threw him out of the house last year.
A shaggy-haired Maoist.
I don't know where he is.
Presumably, building bombs in basements as an expression of universal brotherhood.
I've got a 17-year-old daughter who's had two abortions in two years, got arrested last week at a rock festival, for pushing drugs.
They let her go.
The typical affluent American family.
I don't mean to be facile about this.
I blame myself for those two useless young people.
I never exercised parental authority.
I'm no good at that.
Oh, God, I'm no good at this, either.
Let's just forget the whole thing.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
How serious are your suicidal speculations?
I amuse myself with different ways of killing myself that don't look like suicide.
I wouldn't want to do my family out of the insurance.
Digitalis will give you an arrhythmia.
A good toxologist would find traces.
Potassium's much better.
60 milli-equivalent. Instantaneous.
Then you're stuck with how to get rid of the hypodermic.
Forty milli-equivalent.
Gives you time to dispose of the evidence.
You seem to have given considerable thought to the matter.
You ought to know that a man who talks about it all the time never does it.
I don't know. I see a man exhausted, emotionally drained, riddled with guilt, has been systematically stripping himself of wife, children, friends, isolating himself from the world.
- Are you impotent?
- Intermittently.
- What does that mean?
- I haven't tried in so long, I don't know.
Let's just drop the whole thing, Joe.
I feel humiliated and stupid.
I just got to pull myself together and get back into my work.
I'm sorry I troubled you.
Take care of yourself. I'll see you later.
Ten-four, save our homes.
Two, four, we the poor.
Don't go 'round. Don't tear us down.
- All set?
- Yes, sir.
- Who was that exotic group?
- You got me.
- They've been here about an hour.
- I think they're with the old man in 806.
Dr. Perry said he picked the tuberculosis and liver nodes for today.
- Yes, sir.
- Good, because that's the one I studied up.
- A hell of a case.
- Yes, sir.
- Who's presenting?
- I am, sir. Should I start?
Mr. Hemmings!
Is there anybody seated who hasn't been to see me first?
Is there anybody here who has not given me their health-insurance number?
Emergency Room.
I don't know, Sybil. What's his name?
Wait a moment, please. I'm on the phone.
Can't you see I'm on the phone?
I am, Sybil. I'm looking.
Of course not. Do they ever?
Would you mind, please? Excuse me.
Thirty-two?
Telescope sights.
They follow me everywhere.
Three big Black men. Naked, completely exposed, right in the street.
Hanging down to their knees.
It's disgusting.
Did you call upstairs and tell them to admit a patient named Mitgang?
- Is that the concussion?
- I don't know.
They said you didn't fill out the chart.
Where do you come off sending anyone up to Admitting without my okay?
Would you get the hell out of here?
The patient's in the holding room.
You want his Blue Cross number, go get it.
Dr. Spezio, may I see you for a moment, if you don't mind?
Is this your handwriting, if you don't mind?
Am I supposed to read this?
Was that a sprain, a broken wrist?
I can't read that scribbling.
I have to bill these people.
I know you are the ministering angels and I'm the bitch from the accounting department, but I've a job, too.
If you don't mind, Doctor.
The kid had a colly fracture, we had him in the OR.
We reduced it, and we gave him a small cast.
But did you give him a sling?
You must've taken x-rays.
How am I supposed to make out the charges?
- Are you Mitgang?
- I'm Mitgang.
Do you carry Blue Cross, Blue Shield, if you don't mind?
Do you have your card with you?
Do you know your number?
You are not leaving this room until I have this information.
Do you mind if I at least ask this gentleman to fill out his chart?
May I have your AHS policy number, sir?
Do you carry Blue Cross, Blue Shield?
Dr. Spezio!
I think one of your patients in here is dead.
Why do you say that, Mrs. Cushing?
Because he wouldn't give me his Blue Cross number.
Christ!
How long has this man been lying here?
Isn't he the doctor that came in around 9:00?
"Pete's sake," I said, "This is a hospital.
One of our feed lines just blew."
We were lucky to trace it in time.
Have we covered everything?
Dr. Kish has been driving me nuts about the OR schedule.
He's supposed to see me about that.
This is the Emergency Room.
One of the doctors died of a heart attack.
- One of our staff?
- I think so.
Tom, you want to go down to the Emergency Room?
- One of our doctors just died.
- Another one?
See what that's about.
I'll be on Holly 8, and I'll be right back.
It's no longer pilferage.
It's reached the point of piracy.
- That's the third microscope this month.
- Let's get together on this later today.
- How about 1:00?
- 1:00 will be fine.
Your brother's in his room.
- What one is it?
You're gonna be in the hospital for two lousy days.
- What's the fuss about?
- You're supposed to be a big wheel here.
The private rooms are full.
If they brought in Jesus Christ fresh off the cross, I couldn't get him one.
I'm not staying in a room with a dying man.
He's not dying.
They'll screen him off.
You won't even know he's here.
If you want a private room, go home.
I'll call you when one comes up.
But you phoned me, in a panic.
You're going on vacation.
They'll cut this polyp out tomorrow.
You'll be home Thursday, in Miami Friday.
- Will you talk some sense into this lunatic?
- You said it. He's a lunatic.
Big wheel!
Can't even get me a private room.
I'll get you a tranquillizer.
"Five. A full
"abdomen" contrasted with wasting elsewhere.
"Six. Ascites" with a protein content above 4 grams.
Unexplained anemia, leukopenia.
Unexplained elevation of the serum gamma globulin level.
Especially abnormal flocculation tests, and of course, a positive PPD.
All of these findings assume special significance in Negroes.
This has been a very commendable workup.
It's as commendable a workup of an FUO as I can remember.
The staff on this floor is to be applauded.
All right, let's go take a look at the girl.
It's a reportable case, Brubaker.
I'd write it up.
Nurse, who's the senior resident on this floor?
That would be Dr. Brubaker.
But he's at Chief-of-Service rounds now.
That's this way?
I wonder if there's some correlation between hepatic tuberculosis and drug addiction.
Presumably, there was an early consideration of SBE?
Yes, sir. We discounted it after repeated blood cultures were negative.
- You, Ambler. Is that right, "Ambler"?
- Yes, sir.
What else do you look for in Bacterial Endocarditis?
Dr. Brubaker, can I see you for a minute, please?
Still a little icteric.
Who's got an ophthalmoscope?
Did anyone note Roth spots?
Don't worry about it. There aren't any.
Ambler, you're our big man on SBE.
- What was the latex fixation?
- It wasn't done, sir.
Don't you think that's an important test to differentiate SBE from military TB?
Not you, Biegelman. Ambler.
There's about a 70 percent incidence of false-positive latex in SBE.
You have been reading up.
If the diagnosis were SBE, would a positive latex indicate anything in the therapy?
- We'd expect the latex to become negative.
- If?
If the antibiotic therapy were successful.
- Are you applying for your internship here?
- I'm not sure.
Come and see me.
Would you sit up, please, miss?
We've got a little thing here, Doctor.
The girl over there is the daughter of the patient in 806.
He is at the moment comatose, and requires intravenous feeding and meds.
The daughter wants to take the father out of the hospital and back to Mexico, where they live.
The patient's name is Drummond.
He's apparently a Methodist missionary.
They run some kind of religious mission among the Apache Indians.
The daughter says she's a licensed nurse so she can give the necessary IVs and treatment.
I don't think he should be let out of the hospital.
The attending, the guy in brown over there, concurs.
Wait, let me have all that again.
As a matter of fact, this is Dr. Biegelman's case.
Never mind the professional ethics.
What happened?
I don't know why I'm covering up for that son of a bitch in Farkis Pavilion.
The patient, a man of 56, was admitted to the hospital 10 days ago in good health, for a checkup.
No visible distress.
We did the mandatory workup on him.
Blood cultures, stool, LE preps, chest EKG.
All negative. However, there was some evidence of protein in his urine.
I don't know how that guy in Farkis Pavilion found out.
Maybe he had a deal with one of the girls in the lab.
He turned up the next day, conned the patient into signing an authorization for a biopsy.
- What guy in Farkis Pavilion?
- Some postgrad fellow named Ives.
Elroy Ives. I never met him. He's on one of the immunology research programs.
Some postgrad came up here, did a biopsy on the patient?
Yes, sir. He conned Biegelman with that story...
Protein in the urine?
- And he biopsied the man?
- And he nicked a vessel.
They woke up Biegelman at 2:00 in the morning, as the patient was in shock.
Biegelman called the kidney people for a consult.
But what was there to see?
The patient was sour and bleeding.
Spoke to this fellow, Sutcliff.
He referred us to a surgeon named Welbeck.
- That barber?
- You ain't heard nothing yet.
We finally got Welbeck around 4:00 in the morning.
He said go ahead.
So they laid the surgery for 8:00.
Welbeck turned up half-stoned, orders an IVP, clears him for allergies without actually testing, and the patient went into shock.
And tubular necrosis.
They lopped out the bleeding kidney ran him back to the room, we waited for urine.
Fever began spiking like hell, uremia, vomiting. So we arranged hemodialysis.
He's putting out good water now, but some nurse goofed on his last treatment. A shunt separated, something.
Blood pressure plunged.
They ran him up to ICU, gave him two units of whole blood.
Vital signs are normal, but he's comatose.
- That was two days ago.
- In short, a man comes into this hospital in perfect health and in the space of one week, we chop out one kidney, damage another, reduce him to coma, and damn near kill him.
Yes, sir.
You know, Brubaker, last night I sat in my hotel room, reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide.
I said, "No, Bock, don't do it.
You're a doctor, you're a healer.
"You're the Chief of Medicine at one of the great hospitals of the world.
"You are a necessary person.
Your life is meaningful."
Then I walk in here, today, and I find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses who mistook him for a patient because he screwed a technician from the Nephrology Lab.
- Hematology...
- Now you come to me with this gothic horror story in which the entire machinery of modern medicine has apparently conspired to destroy one lousy patient.
How am I to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this?
I'll tell you something.
If there were an oven around here,
I'd stick my head in it.
What was the name of that guy from Farkis Pavilion again?
Ives, sir. Elroy Ives.
- Somebody ought to ream his ass.
- I'm going to ream his ass.
I'm gonna break that Welbeck's back.
I'll defrock those two cannibals.
They will never again practice in this hospital. I'll tell you that.
What about the girl? She says we have no right to stop her from taking her father out.
She's willing to sign an AOR form.
Let him go before we kill him.
Get me Dr. Gilley.
I want to talk to him right now.
Put him on page, if you have to.
I don't care if he's operating.
You get me some monkey named Ives.
I-V-E-S. First name, Elroy.
He's in the Farkis Pavilion.
I want to talk to you, Joe.
Come in my office, please.
You got some punk rotating in your department, named Ives?
Also, I want to ask you what kind of dialysis room you're running.
Excuse me.
Gilley? Bock.
Didn't you tell me a few months ago you were gonna cut off all privileges for that assassin, Welbeck?
Welbeck, yes! He just butchered another one of my patients!
The man's a buccaneer.
I want him brought up before the Medical Executive Committee.
He's in your department, not mine.
He's putatively a surgeon!
I'll be here.
I think you should know you've got some research guy named Ives in your department who's doing some dubious biopsies.
We're having enough problems squeezing grants
- out of the Nixon Administration...
- Ives is dead. That's why I'm here.
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's dead.
He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room.
He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room?
What is this? Some kind of plague?
Where is he now?
They were just taking him down to Pathology.
The next thing anybody knew, three hours later,
Mrs. Cushing said there was a dead man in the holding room.
You don't find anything a little grotesque about all this?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, at 8:30 this morning, we meet over a doctor who's killed intravenously, and here we are four hours later, with another doctor who's died of a heart attack in the Emergency Room.
What are you suggesting?
You think we have a mad killer stalking the hospital halls?
Presumably, Dr. Ives died of a heart attack, and Schaefer in a diabetic coma.
People do die of these things.
It's all coincidental, but I wouldn't call it grotesque.
How long are they gonna be on Schaefer's post?
- I don't think you'd like to call next-of-kin?
- No, thanks.
God, I need a drink.
Mr. Mead?
I have an injection for you.
What the hell is going on in there?
Honey, we got a witch doctor in 806 and you better go in there.
You know that Indian that was sitting in 806 all night? He's still there.
And the girl's there, and they're doing some voodoo in there.
- And I ain't kidding!
- What're you talking about?
I mean that Indian's in there, half-naked, going...
With a little bag.
You just better get in there, Mrs. Dunne.
You wanna see something, baby?
You just come here.
It's a perfectly harmless ceremony.
It's nothing to get excited about.
It'll be over in a few minutes, anyway.
Mr. Blacktree is a shaman who gets his power from the thunder and it's imperative he conclude his ritual while the storm is still going on.
Visiting hours were over at 9:00.
All that's going on in there is a simple Apache prayer for my father's recovery.
The markings he's made on my father's arms, are from the pollen of the tule plant.
The twigs have no significance, except they've been struck by lightning and are consequently appeals to the spirit of lightning.
It's all entirely harmless.
A religious ceremony, not a medical one.
You don't seriously believe all that mumbo jumbo's gonna cure him?
On the other hand, it won't kill him.
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Thanks.
- You still gonna take your father out?
- I have to arrange an ambulance.
- Is there a phone here I could use?
- Use my office.
Thank you.
Hello. I'd like to arrange an ambulance.
I'd like to arrange an ambulance at 1:30, tomorrow afternoon.
Drummond. First name, Barbara.
I'll pay cash.
You're to pick up my father,
Drummond, Edward at the Manhattan Medical Center,
Holly Pavilion, Room 806.
It's a stretcher case.
I presume you provide the stretcher.
He's to be taken to American Airlines,
Kennedy Airport,
Flight 729 to Yuma, Arizona.
I'll accompany the patient. Thank you.
You believe in witchcraft, Miss Drummond?
I believe in everything.
- You like a drink?
- Yeah.
My father, you should know, was a very successful doctor in Boston.
A member of the Harvard Medical Faculty.
He was a widower, and I was his only child.
He was not an especially religious man, a sober Methodist.
One evening, seven years ago, he attended a Pentecostal meeting at Harvard and found himself speaking in tongues.
He sank to his knees at the back of the room and began to talk fluently, in a language which no one had ever heard before.
This sort of thing happens frequently at Pentecostal meetings and began happening regularly to my father.
It was not unusual to walk into our home and find my father sitting in his office, utterly serene, happily speaking to the air in this strange, foreign tongue.
I was, at that time, 20 years old, having my obligatory affair with a minority group.
In my case, a Hopi Indian, a postgraduate fellow at Harvard, doing his doctorate in aboriginal languages of the Southwest.
One day, I brought the Indian boy home just as my father was sinking to his knees in the entrance foyer in one of his trances.
The Indian wheeled in his tracks, and he said, "I'll be a son of a bitch!"
You see, my father was speaking an Apache dialect, an obscure dialect at that, spoken only by a ragged band of unreconstructed Indians who had rejected the reservation, and gone to live in isolation in the Sierra Madre Mountains in Northern Mexico.
What do you say to that?
What the hell am I supposed to say to that?
I'm sitting here boozing, and you come in and tell me some demented story about your father's religious conversion.
You miss the point.
Not my father's conversion, mine.
You see, I'd been hitting the acid pretty regularly at that time.
I had achieved a few minor sensory deformities, some suicidal despairs, but nothing as wild as fluency in an obscure Apache dialect.
I mean, like, "Wow, man!"
Here was living afflatus right before my eyes!
Within a week, my father had closed his Beacon Hill practice and set out to start a mission in the Mexican Mountains.
I turned in my STS card and my crash helmet, and I followed him.
It was a disaster, at least for me.
My father had received the revelation, not I.
He stood gaunt on a mountain slope and preached the Apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians.
I masturbated a lot.
We lived in a grass wickiup, ate raw rabbit and crushed piñon nuts.
It was hideous.
Within two months, I was back in Boston.
A hollow shell, disenchanted with everything, and dizzy with dengue.
I turned to austerity, combed my hair tight, entered nursing school.
I became haggard, driven, had shamelessly incestuous dreams about my father.
I took up with some of the senior staff there. One of them, a portly psychiatrist explained,
I was generated by an unresolved lust for my father.
I cracked up.
One day, they found me walking to work naked and screaming obscenities.
There was talk of institutionalizing me.
So I packed a bag and went back to join my father in the Sierra Madre Mountains.
I've been there ever since.
That's three years.
My father is, of course, as mad as a hatter.
I watch over him, and have been curiously content.
You see, I believe in everything.
What was that all about?
I thought I was obvious as hell.
I'm trying to tell you,
I have a thing about middle-aged men.
I admire your candor.
You've been admiring a lot more than that.
You're wasting your time.
I've been impotent for years.
Rubbish.
What the hell is wrong with being impotent?
Kids are more hung up on sex than the Victorians.
I got a son, 23-years-old.
I threw him out of the house last year.
Pietistic little humbug.
He preached universal love, and he despised everyone.
Had a blanket contempt for the middle class, even its decencies.
Detested my mother because she had a petit bourgeois pride in her son, the doctor.
I cannot tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good lady.
When she died, he didn't even come to the funeral.
He felt the chapel service was an hypocrisy.
He told me his generation didn't live with lies.
I said, "Listen, everybody lives with lies."
I grabbed him by his poncho and I dragged him the length of our seven-room, despicably affluent, middle-class apartment, and I flung him out.
I haven't seen him since.
You know what he said to me?
He's standing there on the landing, on the verge of tears.
He shrieked at me,
"You old fink.
"You can't even get it up anymore."
That was it, you see.
That was his real revolution.
It wasn't racism, the oppressed poor, or the war in Vietnam.
The ultimate American societal sickness was a limp dingus.
My God.
If there is a despised, misunderstood minority in this country, it is us poor, impotent bastards.
I'm impotent, and I'm proud of it.
Impotence is beautiful, baby!
- Power to the impotent! Right on, baby!
- Right on!
You know, when I say impotent,
I don't mean merely limp.
Disagreeable as it may be for a woman, a man may lust for other things, something a little less transient than an erection.
A sense of permanent worth.
That's what medicine was to me, my reason for being.
When I was 34,
I presented a paper before the annual convention of the Society of Clinical Investigation that pioneered the whole goddamn field of Immunology.
A breakthrough.
I'm in all the textbooks.
I happen to be an eminent man.
You know something else?
I don't give a goddamn.
When I say impotent,
I mean I've lost even my desire to work.
That's a hell of a lot more primal passion than sex.
I've lost my reason for being.
My purpose.
The only thing I ever truly loved.
It is all rubbish, isn't it?
Transplants, antibodies.
We manufacture genes.
We can produce birth ectogenetically.
We can practically clone people like carrots, and half the kids in this ghetto haven't even been inoculated for polio!
We have established the most enormous medical entity ever conceived and people are sicker than ever!
We cure nothing!
We heal nothing!
The whole goddamn wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes.
That's what I mean when I say impotent.
You don't know what the hell I'm talking about, do you?
Of course I do.
I'm very tired.
And I hurt.
I've got nothing going for me anymore.
Can you understand that?
Of course.
Can you also understand that the only admissible matter left is death?
Sounds to me like a familiar case of morbid menopause.
Christ.
It's hard for me to take your despair seriously.
- You obviously enjoy it so much.
- Bugger off!
That's all I need now, is clinical insight.
Some cockamamie 25-year-old acidhead is gonna reassure me about the menopause now!
I'd like to be alone.
Why don't you just beat it?
Close the door and turn off the lights on your way out.
Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt, but it was the only thing I had to come to the city with.
Back at the tribe,
I wear ankle-length buckskin.
Swell.
Close the door and turn off the lights.
What're you shooting?
Leave me alone.
Potassium.
You take enough of this stuff, it'll kill you.
I thought I might have read you wrong, that you really were suicidal, so I came back.
Who asked you?
Leave me alone!
Why can't you leave me alone?
Leave me alone.
Why didn't you let me do it?
I'll see you.
Do you have a match, Doctor?
You wouldn't be awake?
- What time is it?
- Almost 7:00.
I swiped this for you out of the nurses' locker room.
I'll make good on your dress.
I'm afraid it was torn beyond repair.
I'll buy you a new one, or give me the size and I'll send it on to you.
I wanna talk to you about that.
- Talk to me about what?
- Your father.
You really shouldn't take him out of here in his condition.
I've just been looking at his chart.
There's no reason to presume brain damage.
You can't predict anything in these instances, but he could come out of that coma at any time.
I think you should leave him here.
I'll personally look after him.
Is this your way of saying you'd like me to stay in town a few more days?
That would be nice, too.
What do you say, Miss Drummond?
I expect you can call me Barbara, considering you ravished me three times last night.
- Three times?
- Look at him pretending he didn't count.
You were as puffed up as a toad about it.
Punched a couple of holes in your crusade for universal impotence, didn't it?
I think we're on first-name basis now.
I'll call you Herb.
Let's give your father a week, Barbara.
What do you say?
I don't want my father in this hospital.
I had a dream about this hospital.
I dreamt this enormous, starched, white-tile building suddenly erupted like a volcano, and all the patients, doctors, nurses, attendants, orderlies, the whole line-staff, food-service people, the aged, the lame, and you, right in the middle, were stampeding in one hideous, screaming, suicidal mass into the sea.
I'm taking my father out of here, and as quickly as I can.
You're really a fruitcake, you know?
Let me put it this way. I love you.
I fancied you from the moment you came lumbering down that hallway, upstairs.
I said to Mr. Blacktree,
"Who's that hulking bear of a man?"
The Apaches are reverential about bears.
Won't eat bear meat, never skin bears.
Bears are thought of as both benign and evil, but very strong power.
Men with bear power are highly respected and are said to be great healers.
"That man," I said,
"Gets his power from the bear."
Swell. Now, look.
You haven't got a hotel room or some sort of accommodations
- where you can stay...
- Let me put it this way.
My father and I accept the implacability of death.
If he dies, he dies.
I'm getting him out of here and back to Mexico at 1:00 p.m.
I want you to come with us, because I love you and want children.
I'm afraid Mexico is a little too remote for me.
We could use you down there.
There's a curiously high incidence of TB.
You'd be a doctor again.
You'd be necessary again.
If you love me, I don't see any other choice.
What do you mean, if I love you?
I raped you in a suicidal rage.
How did we get to love and children?
I ought to know if a man loves me or not.
You must've told me half a hundred times last night you loved me.
You murmured and shouted it.
You even opened the window and bellowed it out into the street.
Those were more expressions of gratitude than love.
Gratitude for what?
For resurrecting feelings of life in me
I thought dead.
My God, what do you think love is?
All right, I love you! You love me!
I'm not about to argue with so relentless a romantic.
Since we have this great passion going for us, why don't you stay around New York for a week or 10 days?
It's up to 10 days now.
- Until your father's condition improves.
- No.
I've had these prophetic dreams for seven nights.
Seven is a sinister number.
The meaning of these dreams is very clear, seven times as clear.
I'm to get you and my father out of here before we're all destroyed.
You're certifiable.
Half the time you're an intelligent young woman, then all of a sudden, you turn into a Cabalist who believes in dreams and witchcraft and bear power.
I don't like the way you dismiss my whole life as unnecessary.
I do a lot of healing here in Manhattan.
I don't have to go to Mexico to do it.
I also teach.
I send out 80 doctors a year into the world, often inspirited, at least competent.
I've built up one of the best departments of medicine in the world.
We have a hell of a heart unit, we have a hell of a kidney group.
A lot of people come into this place in big trouble, and go out a lot better for the experience, so don't tell me how unnecessary I am.
So why were you trying to kill yourself with an overdose of potassium?
- Where are you going?
- My hotel. I have to check out.
Mr. Blacktree doesn't speak any English.
- You're coming back, of course?
- Of course.
I have to settle the bill, pack my father.
I think you need a few hours alone to make your decisions.
What decision?
You're a very tired, very damaged man.
You've had a hideous marriage,
I assume a few tacky affairs along the way.
You're understandably reluctant to get involved again.
And here I am with this preposterous idea, you throw everything up and go off with me to some barren mountains in Mexico.
Utterly mad, I know. On the other hand, you find this world as desolate as I do.
You did try to kill yourself last night.
So that's it.
Either me and the mountains, or the bottle of potassium.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
I'll be in my father's room.
All right, I love you!
My God!
I repeat, I'm asking you to come out peacefully.
These buildings are condemned and unfit for habitation.
You people are possessing this building illegally and in violation of the law.
I'm asking you to come out peacefully.
So the hospital has assumed the responsibility for finding 400 housing units in good buildings.
The hospital wishes to point out that this row of buildings on First Avenue was condemned by the city before the hospital acquired ownership, and even then only after responsible leaders in the community approved the building of our new drug-rehabilitation center.
God damn it. I've got a dozen community leaders waiting for me in the library.
We're trying to work out a negotiable formula for two years, with no help from you people in the Urban Affairs Division, I might add.
I am not going to throw all that down the drain because some cockamamie activist group is showboating for the television cameras.
You get those people out of those buildings before a wall collapses, or a fire breaks out and we've got a riot on our hands.
Okay.
Having your troubles?
I won't take much of your time.
My name is Welbeck.
I've been associated with this hospital for six years, and yesterday afternoon,
Dr. Gilley called me to tell me he was cutting off my privileges with the hospital.
- Do you know anything about that?
- That's news to me.
- He said he sent the report on.
- I'll probably get the report tomorrow.
- I assume...
- A report about what?
I'm not sure myself.
I did a nephrectomy on a man about seven days ago.
Emergency called in at 4:00 a.m., and the man was haemorrhaging...
I'm really sorry.
I do have a meeting to go to.
In any event, there's nothing I can do about it.
If Gilley... I'll be in the library.
If Gilley wants to cut your privileges, he's Chief of Surgery, it's within his province.
You'll have to have the hearing.
I have a laparotomy for today.
I assume
I'll be able to go through with that.
I've been connected with this hospital for six years.
It seems to me I've had your name down here before, for something.
Wait a minute.
You're the fellow with the Medicaid collecting business who incorporated and went public, right?
Something like that?
Milton Mead was telling me about you.
You're a whole medical conglomerate.
You've got a factoring service, a computerized billing company, a few proprietary hospitals, a few nursing homes.
Good heavens, you shouldn't be brought up before a committee of mere doctors.
You should be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
You have to go through with the hearing.
I can't do anything about that.
...imperializing the Blacks.
We reject the bourgeois, middle-class Black traitors and flunkies who are selling out the Black proletarians
- to the expansionist, racist policies...
- Let's get back to the abortion issue.
What the hell does the male establishment know about abortion?
Who the hell raised the issue of birth control?
The issue at hand is the control of drug addiction in this community and in the ghetto, personally.
- We don't want no goddamn abortion.
- Let's get to the core of this matter.
The point is that this hospital is the landlord for those buildings and instead of tearing them down and building some imperialistic extensions of the medical establishment, this hospital ought to be rebuilding those tenements,
- give those people decent housing.
- Please.
You know, I hallucinated last night.
I hallucinated there was an Indian doing a war dance in here.
You weren't hallucinating, Mr. Mead.
- There was an Indian in here last night.
- There was?
Okay. Down to the Operating Room.
Dr. Norris said about half an hour.
- Okay. Coming up fine.
- Half an hour.
- Hold him right there.
- Miss Shirley, it's just an ovarian cyst.
Okay. Go up to Holly 6 on the double. Go.
Who is that? Is that Mangafranni?
Yeah. Number 3.
Good morning, Doctor.
It's legal for a doctor to incorporate in New York, isn't it?
Since last September.
If they'd had that when I was your age,
I'd have put away a couple of million.
It gives you a variety of deferral devices.
Profit sharing, for example.
Let's say you pick yourself an October 31 fiscal.
You declare a bonus payable in '71.
An accrued item payable to a principal shareholder must be paid within two and a half months after the year end, to get the deduction in the prior year.
But your corporation doesn't pay that tax because we've eliminated the taxable income with the bonus.
With two taxable entities, you can bury a lot of expenses.
Hello, this is Welbeck.
Any messages for me?
I'm at the hospital.
I gotta cut open some guy soon.
I'll try to make it as fast as I can.
How urgent did he say it was?
Doctor Hogan made those arrangements with the underwriters.
The registration statement was filed with the SEC well over a year ago.
If he calls again, have me paged here.
- Mangafranni, right?
- Right.
What do you say?
We're not gonna hang it in the Louvre.
There's no pulse, Doctor.
- What's the pressure?
- There's no blood pressure.
No pulse. Get the tube and EKG.
- What's the matter?
- I can't feel a thing here.
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
She must have thrown an embolus.
She was doing fine, up to now.
- Did you check the gases?
- I did.
'Cause the only time
I saw anyone conk out, some jerk switched the nitrous oxide and the gas lines.
Get the damn leads on.
For Christ's sake, what the hell is this?
She's a young woman.
Should we open the chest?
- She's 53, you button-head.
- Bicarb.
Jesus H. Christ!
Stop for a minute.
- V-fib, Doctor.
- Get me the paddles.
I may be crazy, Doctor, but I don't think this is your patient.
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't want to get into an intestine hassle.
The malpractice here is monumental.
As you can see,
Dr. Schaefer's blood sugar was 23.
No glucose solution is going to do that.
The only thing that'll do it is at least 50 units of insulin, probably more.
We must presume one of the nurses shot
50 units of insulin into his bloodstream, either by injection or IV, although how in God's name a thing like that.
I'm very sorry, Doctor.
- May I use your phone?
- Certainly.
Did you ask the head nurse from eighth to tell you
- when a Miss Drummond got here?
- Yes.
- She just got there.
- I better get down there directly.
Have you called the OOD?
You better call Dr. Gilley.
And call Mr. Sloan.
I'll be right down.
I'm very sorry.
There's a very nasty one in the OR.
They've just operated on the wrong patient.
I don't understand. Is she back in her room?
When did she get back in her room?
Who brought her back?
She's back in her room.
- Who?
- Mrs. Mangafranni, the woman who was supposed to have been operated on.
Are they still working on that woman in 3?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Fried, could you say that again?
Nobody in this office sent her back up.
All right, Mrs. Fried.
I'll have to call you back.
Did any of you take a woman patient named Mangafranni out of the holding room, back up to Holly 5, around 10:00?
- What happened?
- I don't know what happened.
A patient named Mangafranni was scheduled to have a hysterectomy at 10:00, Dr. Mallory.
I talked to Sylvia in the holding room, who admitted her, so she was here.
Now I just spoke to Mrs. Fried on Holly 5 and she says an orderly brought Mrs. Mangafranni back to her room about 20 minutes ago.
Now Mrs. Mangafranni is in her room, sleeping.
- Who's the woman in the operating room?
- I don't know.
Is she dead?
They had to open her up, and that's not good.
I better get Mr. Mead.
Now, we can rectify the injustices of the world tomorrow, but right now, could we get those people out of those buildings?
Will you please listen to me?
Will you shut up?
Will you please shut up and listen to me?
Let's call a halt to this participatory democracy and address ourselves to the immediate problem!
- When did it happen?
- About half an hour.
- Called the Medical Examiner?
- No.
You'd better do that now.
Call the precinct station house, too.
Good morning.
This is really something, isn't it?
I thought she looked different when they brought her.
I said to one of the nurses,
"She looks younger without her dentures."
I talked to her half an hour before.
Does anyone know who she is?
What's her chart say?
Her chart and her bracelet say "Mangafranni."
The only thing that isn't Mangafranni is the woman.
Jesus H. Christ!
I've been chopping out
3 uteruses a day for 30 years, is it too much to expect you people to bring in the right goddamn Jesus Christ uterus?
I talked to her in the holding room.
She was perfectly fine. A little drowsy.
I thought it was funny that when they brought her in, she was out cold.
We'll have to stay here till Mr. Mead or someone from the OOD comes back.
I'm not taking the rap for this.
I've got one malpractice suit pending.
I'm not taking the rap for this one.
You're not leaving.
I love you, and I'm not gonna let you go.
Let's start putting your father's things back. He's staying here.
I'll find you an apartment.
I'm staying in a filthy little hotel room.
We can't use that.
I can't make it up here. I'll crack up.
I can retain my sanity only in a simple society.
You can't really expect me to live in a grass shack and hunt jackrabbit.
- Be sensible, for God's sake.
- I am being sensible.
What is it you're so afraid of leaving here?
Your plastic home?
Your conditioned air?
Your synthetic clothes? Your instant food?
I'm offering you green silence, and solitude.
The natural order of things.
Mostly, I'm offering me.
I think we're beautiful.
You make it sound almost plausible.
I don't know why you even hesitate.
What's holding you here?
Is it your wife?
That's all over.
If I'm married to anything, it's this hospital.
It's been my whole life.
I can't walk out on it as though it never mattered.
I'm middle class.
Among us middle class, love doesn't triumph over all, responsibility does.
Don't ask me to stay up here with you, because I love you, and I will.
And we'll both be destroyed.
I have the bill here to pay, yet.
I'll come with you.
You wanted to know the name of that dialysis nurse?
Who?
The one who goofed on your patient, Drummond.
Her name is Teresa Campanella.
You're not gonna believe this.
She died on the operating table of OR 3 about an hour ago.
- What?
- You heard about the screwup in OR 3.
- You mean she was the one?
- I just identified her.
What is going on?
Every time I try to find somebody, they either died of a heart attack or anaesthesia shock in an OR.
I just came from the OR.
They're trying to find a Dr. Schaefer.
Doesn't a kid named Schaefer work here?
Did. He died yesterday of an overdose of insulin. Why?
The nurse says there's a Dr. Schaefer hanging around the holding room.
Wouldn't have been your Schaefer.
Nurse says it was senior staff, middle-aged man.
There's no senior staff by that name.
I told them that. I said, "I don't know any senior staff named Schaefer."
They've got detectives down there.
A whole big investigation.
- How'd the nurse know his name?
- His nameplate.
I am the fool for Christ, and Paraclete of Caborca.
For heaven's sakes, Dad.
What the hell's going on?
We thought you were at death's door.
What are you doing out of bed?
What happened?
What's he going at you for?
Did he say anything?
As a matter of fact, he said, "I am the fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca."
Shut that door, because if he tells everybody he's the fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca, they'll put us all away.
He's killed two doctors and a nurse.
I am the wrath of the lamb, and the angel of the bottomless pit.
What do you mean?
I mean he's killed two doctors and a nurse.
He just tried to kill me.
He has something against doctors.
He got ahold of some insulin and put it in Dr. Schaefer's intravenous solution.
Somehow, he got Dr. Ives to die of a heart attack in the middle of the Emergency Room.
Somehow, he got a dialysis nurse,
Campanella, to die of anaesthesia shock on an operating table.
He's been running all over the hospital, dressed up in Dr. Schaefer's uniform.
They're looking all over the place for the mysterious Dr. Schaefer.
It's incredible to us both, but as you can see, your father is not a helpless comatose.
I'm not the one who's crazy.
Ask your crazy father.
I was merely an instrument of God.
I kill no one.
They all three died by their own hands.
Ritual victims of their own institutions, murdered by irony.
"An eye for an eye."
Biblical retribution.
Schaefer was first, because he killed God.
God was admitted to this hospital last Monday under the name of Guernsey.
I was instantly aware of a divine presence.
I was convinced this porcelain old man was an angel of the Lord, perhaps even Christ himself.
Our savior was suffering from emphysema.
He was relentlessly subjected to the benefits of modern medicine and died at 7:30 that evening.
A few hours later, he appeared to me in a revelation.
Rise up, Drummond.
You are dead, now you are restored.
Those who killed you and those who killed me, will die in our place.
You are the Paraclete of Caborca.
The wrath of the lamb.
The angel of the bottomless pit.
Not quite the burning bush, perhaps, but prodigal enough for me.
I was to avenge the death of God, and my own brutalization.
I was to kill doctors Schaefer,
Ives, and Welbeck, and the dialysis nurse, Miss Campanella, whose negligence caused my coma.
I awaited a further sign from God, which was given to me later that evening.
Dr. Schaefer had arranged an assignation with a girl from the Hematology Lab named Sheila.
Boy, I sure hope nobody walks in.
- What about him?
- He's zonked out.
- What's new?
- Nothing.
- What's this?
- It's my insulin.
I forgot to put it back.
What's the insulin for?
I didn't know you were a diabetic.
It ain't contagious, don't worry.
You took the insulin from Dr. Schaefer's pocket and put it in the IV.
Yes.
Then a nurse came and plugged the IV jar into Schaefer.
God clearly intended a measure of irony here.
The hospital was to do all the killing for me.
All I need do is arrange for the doctors to become patients in their own hospital.
The next morning,
I pinched some digoxin from the pharmacy, and a sandbag from a utility cart and found my way to Dr. Ives' laboratory.
I crushed him with the sandbag and gave him a massive shot of the digoxin.
This brought on an instant condition of cardiac arrhythmia.
I waited for him to come to.
Then I brought him down to the Emergency Room.
He had, at that time, perhaps an hour to live.
Prompt treatment would've saved his life.
He was suddenly taken ill.
I got him here right away.
As a staff doctor, he was seen without preliminaries.
His vital signs were taken.
An electrocardiogram, which revealed occasional ventricular premature contractions.
An intern took his history, and then he was promptly, simply, forgotten to death.
Simply mislaid.
Mislaid among the broken wrists, the chest pains, the scalp lacerations, the man whose fingers were crushed in a taxi door, the infant with a skin rash, the child swiped by a car, the old lady mugged in the subway, the derelict beaten by sailors, the teenage suicide, the paranoids, drunks, asthmatics, the rapes, the septic abortions, the overdosed addicts, the fractures, infarcts, haemorrhages, concussions, boils, abrasions, the colonic cancers, the cardiac arrests, the whole wounded madhouse of our times.
Who's number 7680202-S?
Is there anybody here who is that number?
In this way, was it revealed to me the manner of Nurse Campanella's death.
She was to die of the great American plague, vestigial identity.
So, last night I crushed Miss Campanella with a sandbag, sedated her with Thorazine, shaved her, prepped her, and parked her in a corridor of the x-ray department for five hours.
- Why x-ray?
- At x-ray, a sedated body lying around unattended for five hours
- wouldn't seem unusual.
- Of course.
Her operation, that is to say,
Mrs. Mangafranni's operation, was not scheduled till 9:30.
At 9:15 this morning, I rang for my nurse.
Rang for your nurse?
To insure one full hour of uninterrupted privacy.
I got up, wheeled Miss Campanella off to the operating rooms.
I exchanged
Mrs. Mangafranni's bed with hers.
I transferred the charts and identity bracelets.
She died officially of anaesthesia shock.
In fact, she died because she was wearing another woman's identity.
God, what do we do now?
Let me take him back to Mexico.
It's a simple world there.
He functions there.
If you turn him in, they'll cage him in the Rockland
State Hospital for the criminally insane.
- Let me take him back.
- Are you kidding?
We'll both take him. I'm going with you.
Let's get him dressed.
We'll leave before the police put us all in Rockland State.
I haven't finished my work here.
I have this Welbeck to dispose of.
I'm the angel of the bottomless pit, and the wrath of the lamb.
He's having another revelation.
That ambulance must be there by now.
You go and get them.
I'll give him a shot of something.
We'll go to the airport in the ambulance.
You're hallucinating again.
Powell never showed up.
I'm short-staffed as hell.
It's just me and Alice.
- It's like a Sunday. Nobody's here.
- I'll be in with the bleeder.
You gotta send me somebody.
We'll be in 806.
Then what did she say?
I'm Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient on this floor named Drummond.
I'd like to see his chart.
Dr. Bock, can I have a few minutes of your time?
Dr. Gilley tells me that you initiated these proceedings against me.
- I'm busy.
- What is it you have against me?
Eight days ago you showed up half-stoned for a simple nephrectomy, botched it, put the patient in failure, and damn near killed him.
Then, pausing only to send in your bill, you flew off on the wings of Man, to an island of sun in Montego Bay.
This is the third time in two years we've had to patch up your patients.
The other two died.
You're greedy, unfeeling, inept, indifferent, self-inflating, and unconscionably profitable.
Besides that, I have nothing against you.
I'm sure you play a hell of a game of golf.
What else do you want to know?
How much do you make a year?
For a guy who makes a lousy $40 to $50,000.
This is Dr. Welbeck. Were you paging me?
You've been trying to reach me all morning.
He pulls out the wires and the tubes and he gets up and he puts on a doctor's uniform, and he murders doctors.
He just went out
10 seconds before you came in here.
I'll tell you something else about this crazy place.
There was a naked Indian here, last night, doing a war dance.
That's the kind of crazy place you're running here.
You gotta get me out of here.
This is a crazy place.
Listen to me.
I wake up last night and there was an Indian in here, a naked Indian!
- What kind of a hospital is this?
- Are you paging me?
Sometime later, the guy in that bed there is getting out.
Are the police still here? Get them up here.
All day, he lays there like he's dead.
In the middle of the night, he gets out of bed! Thought I was crazy!
He says, "You're hallucinating."
I just. Listen. I saw a naked Indian, now I'm seeing a ghost.
I figure he's right, I'm hallucinating.
I'll be down soon.
It never rains, but it pours.
A fire broke out in one of the buildings.
The squatters came out.
The police tried to arrest them.
Now the situation has erupted into a riot.
- You must be wondering what this is about.
- Don't leave me alone here!
Mr. Hitchcock will stay with you.
Better call the cops, Tom.
I haven't time now.
I'm not gonna try to tell you this crazy story my brother just told me.
I'll fill you in on it at lunch, sometime.
- Hold it!
- The ambulance is here.
But your father isn't. Disappeared.
He put on Schaefer's uniform and took off to do God's work, presumably the murder of Dr. Welbeck.
- The guy on the phone is Dr. Welbeck.
- What are you talking about?
Also, the other patient in your father's room just overheard the whole confession and told the Chief Administrator.
They're sending for the cops.
Oh, my God. Who held title?
Do the underwriters know about this yet?
What are you waiting for?
Arrest the son of a bitch. Turn him in.
Oh, my God! When?
Call me right back. I'm at the Holly Pavilion, eighth floor. Hurry, please.
- Are you all right?
- Am I all right?
That son of a bitch is trying to wipe me out. My partner.
The eminent orthopedic surgeon,
Dr. Noel Hogan, is a miserable thief, and he's trying to wipe me out.
- Mr. Drummond's chart.
- What?
- What room is it?
I'm expecting a phone call.
Put it straight through to me in that room.
The son of a bitch has been draining the company with phony purchase orders on another company, of which, it now turns out, his wife is the principal stockholder.
Transparent fraud.
I'll send him up for 20 years.
You don't seem that much the worse for wear.
Please use some other phone.
I'm expecting an important call.
- Who is this guy?
- I'll be at the nurses' desk, Sergeant.
You've got a fever,
- but you're doing well.
- I'm not Drummond.
- Drummond's the other bed.
- That's mine.
It's Welbeck here. Go ahead.
- I'm getting out of this nuthouse.
- Take it easy.
I came in here to get a lousy polyp cut out.
My God! What do you mean?
How many transactions were there?
I borrowed against that stock.
I'm a sick man.
I'm supposed to have peace and quiet!
What do you mean, Brazil?
I talked to Hogan's office yesterday, and they...
I'm wiped out.
The SEC has suspended trading in my stock.
Cardiac arrest. Holly 8.
We have an emergency here.
Please clear all corridors.
Breathe him.
- Where's Chandler?
- He went to lunch.
Get that bed out of here.
Give me an Ambu-bag and an airway.
What's been happening?
- In here?
- Yeah.
- Who is it?
- One of the patients had a cardiac arrest.
Total cardiac arrest.
- How long has he been like this?
- A minute.
- No pulse, no heartbeat, no respiration.
- I'll take over.
- We have another emergency in 823.
- Endotracheal tube.
- Was it Drummond?
- Who else would it be?
Who is this patient?
What's the story on this patient?
This his chart, Dr. Bock?
What's his name? Drummond?
Yes, his name is Drummond.
That's his chart.
Christ. The poor son of a bitch just had a nephrectomy a week ago.
Hook him up to the monitor.
Stop the massage.
Ventricular fibrillation. Get me the paddles.
Push another amp of bicarb.
Set it for 200.
Set, 200.
Everybody back away. One, two, three.
Didn't convert. He's still fibrillating.
Let's go to 400.
- Everybody back.
- Set, 400.
One, two, three.
That didn't work, either. Let me have 1 cc of adrenalin, and an intercardiac needle.
Stop the massage.
It's ventricular fibrillation.
Push another amp of bicarb.
Two hundred.
Set, 200.
Is he dead?
They can't get him out of fib.
I don't think he'll live.
Thank God.
That should close the case, Sergeant.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
We just want the Director.
I've had it up to here.
- I am not dealing with this kind of cheap...
- Now, look.
We're looking for a hostage!
- Fourteen people got arrested for...
- Where's the camera?
Would you be cool, man?
Fourteen people got arrested for living in their homes,
- which you people threw them out of.
- Right on.
Now we are gonna arrest you.
We gonna hold you hostage, and we ain't letting you go.
We, the members of the Doctors' Liberation Committee, indict this hospital for the criminal neglect of the community in which it is situated.
We demand a dissolution of the governing and executive boards.
What are you gonna do about those 14 ghetto people?
I am not going to do anything about anything.
You are.
If you want to take over this hospital, you take it over.
- We will!
- You run it!
I am finished. I quit.
You run it. You pay the bills!
- You fight the city.
- We will.
You fight the state. You fight the unions.
You fight the community.
You think you can do a better job, you do it.
Now, I am finished! I quit!
It's all yours.
Let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
The age is closed.
The season of the seventh seal is at hand!
The age is closed.
Dr. Welbeck is dead.
They thought he was you.
I know.
We must arrange to have his body shipped to my Apache village, where we'll bury him with full tribal rites.
- We must hurry.
- In a day or two, someone'll ask,
"Whatever happened to Dr. Welbeck?"
It'll be assumed he absconded to Brazil to join his partner, the eminent orthopedic surgeon,
Dr. Noel Hogan.
Welbeck, too, was mislaid, overlooked, forgotten to death.
I'm not going.
The hospital's coming apart.
I can't walk out on it when it's coming apart.
Someone has to be responsible.
Everybody's hitting the road, running away, running to the hills.
Someone's got to be responsible.
Kennedy Airport.
You've got a 2:30 flight to make.
You going back in?
Yep.
It's like pissing in the wind, right?
ALthoug the story os this film is fictious,
The events depicted invoLving psychic phenomena are not only very much within the bounds of possibility, but couLd weLL be true.
Dr. Barrett?
My peopLe teLL me you're among the best five in your fieLd.
Your fee wiLL be libras 100,000.
Your assignment: to estabLish the facts.
Regarding what?
SurvivaL after death.
You want me
To Let me know if it's factuaL.
What wouLd convince you either way?
Give me the facts.
Where can I find these facts?
I'm a physiscist...
In 20 years of study psicologia
You'LL find them in the onLy pLace I Know on Earth where survivaL hasn't yet been refuted.
The BeLasco House.
HeLL House?
HeLL House.
The BeLascos seaLed it up after what happened.
20 years ago.
They need money now.
I've bought the pLace.
Can you be there
Monday?
WeLL, can you?
Yes.
There'LL be two others.
FLorence Tanner--
Tanner?
But she's a mentaL medium.
Yes. I want that approach empLoyed, too.
She's practicaLLy a chiLd.
My peopLe teLL me she's the best in her fieLd, too.
And the other one?
The onLy survivor from the Last attempt.
Fischer?
I expect an answer within a week.
A week?
Take it or Leave it.
I have a List of aLL phenomena recorded at the BeLasco House, restoration of eLectricity, transportation of your equipment.
Is that it?
No. There's a partiaLLy constructed machine.
How Long before it's compLete?
Depends on how many eLectronics experts you use.
How soon wiLL you need it?
Wednesday.
Good day.
It wouLd be better if you didn't come.
But I aLways come with you.
I don't want to be Left aLone.
I want to be there when you prove your new theory.
Isn't it just another so-caLLed haunted house?
It's the Mount Everest of haunted houses.
There were two attempts to investigate it.
Both were disasters.
Eight peopLe died.
Fischer was the onLy survivor.
He crawLed out a mentaL wreck.
These are the house keys.
Your Luggage and equipment has aLready been instaLLed.
ELectricity's on.
Your rooms are ready.
There's a fuLL Larder.
I'LL return at 5:00 on the 2 4th.
Look at the windows.
He had them bricked up so no one couLd see in.
Or out.
It's hideous.
We're not even inside yet,
Miss Tanner.
I don't have to be.
[Trying Light Switch]
So much for eLectricity.
There's a generator?
Yes.
My God, that smeLL.
The atmosphere in here.
Of this worLd, not the next.
This house... it knows we're here.
Miss Tanner.
Sorry.
I'LL keep my observations to myseLf.
Do you know where the emergency generator is?
I hope
I didn't disturb you.
It's just that I'm concerned for you coming here.
Yes, I understand.
I wonder if you do.
Just how weaLthy was Mr. BeLasco?
I beLieve he Left miLLions when he died.
Died?
If there's anything you'd care to teLL us...
What's to teLL?
The house tried to kiLL me.
It aLmost succeeded.
That Leads to the ceLLars,
Mr. Fischer?
That's right.
What's through there?
The chapeL.
ChapeL?
Sorry.
I can't right now.
We understand.
WeLcome to my house.
I'm deLighted you couLd come.
I'm certain you wiLLfind your stay most iLLuminating.
Think of me as your unseen host...
Why couLdn't
Miss Tanner come in?
Her system is attuned to psychic energy.
ObviousLy, it's very strong in here.
A church in heLL, that sort of thing.
Why doesn't it affect him?
ObviousLy, he protects himseLf better than she does.
Miss Tanner.
Miss Tanner?
I'm sure it's nothing.
Are you?
Miss Tanner?
I'm over here.
You shouLdn't have done that,
Miss Tanner.
You caused us undue aLarm.
I heard a voice in here.
WeLcome to my house.
I'm deLighted you couLd come.
I'm certain you wiLLfind your stay most iLLuminating.
Think of me as your unseen host.
BeLieve that during your stay here,
I shaLLbe with you in spirit.
May you find the answer you seek.
It is here, I promise you.
And now, auf wiedersehen.
Auf wiedersehen.
''TiLL we meet again.''
The record wasn't for us.
What made the record go on?
BeLasco said he couLd wiLL peopLe to a particuLar object, then move among them unobserved.
I doubt that.
Do you?
Our attention was on that a few moments ago.
How do you know he didn't waLk right by us?
This house hasn't Lived up to its reputation so far.
It hasn't taken our measure yet.
Don't consider the house the haunting force.
Quite evidentLy, the probLem is created by muLtipLe surviving personaLities.
I take it you don't beLieve in survivaL, Dr. Barrett.
If you mean surviving personaLities, you're correct.
We wiLL see.
Indeed we shaLL.
When was the house buiLt?
I don't know.
Mr. Fischer?
You seem to know a Lot about BeLasco.
WouLd you mind sharing it with us?
His first name was Emeric.
He was born on March 23, 1 87 9, the iLLegitimate son of an American munitions maker.
What did he Look Like?
His was a frightening visage, the face of a demon that had taken on some human aspect.
Are you quoting?
Yes, I am.
That is his second wife.
She committed suicide in this room in 1 927.
How taLL was he?
He was 6'5''.
They caLLed him the Roaring Giant.
What did he do to make this house so eviL, Mr. Fischer?
Drug addiction, aLcohoLism, sadism, bestiaLity, mutiLation, murder, vampirism, necrophiLia, cannibaLism, not to mention a gamut of sexuaL goodies.
ShaLL I go on?
How did it end?
If it had ended, we wouLd not be here.
It's about to end,
Mr. Fischer.
What happened to Mr. BeLasco?
No one knows.
When reLatives of the guests had this house broken into in 1 929, they found aLL 27 of them dead.
BeLasco wasn't among them.
If no one objects,
I'LL try a sitting tonight.
I have no objection.
WouLd you care to sit in the morning,
Mr. Fischer?
I'm not ready yet.
Spirit of Love and tenderness, we gather here tonight to communicate with those who waLk this house in torment.
HeLp us to bridge the chasm of death so faithfuLLy that pain is transformed into joy, sorrow into peace.
ALL this we ask in the name of our Infinite Father.
Amen.
This is an eviL house, a pLace of sickness.
EviL!
Extremes.
Limits.
Terminations and extremities.
I don't know.
''If thine eye offend thee...''
Yes.
Yes.
There is a young man.
Very young.
Says he must speak.
Must speak.
[In Spirit's Voice]
I don't know you peopLe.
Why are you here?
It does no good.
Nothing changes.
Nothing.
Get out or I'LL hurt you.
I can't heLp myseLf.
God damn you, you fiLthy sons of bitches.
God damn you!
I don't want to hurt you, but I must, I must.
Get out of this house before I kiLL you aLL!
[Pounding]
You started manifesting physicaL phenomena.
But I'm not a physicaL medium.
You were just now.
The embryo of one.
I don't understand.
ALL this time a mentaL medium, and now this.
The Lord certainLy does move in mysterious ways.
So does this house.
Back to normaL.
Those pounding noises are a bit unnerving the first time you hear them.
Why was Miss Tanner so disturbed by that sitting?
Because she caused physicaL phenomena.
If Miss Tanner is a mentaL medium and Mr. Fischer a physicaL medium, how can you be sure she created those noises, not Fischer?
I can't.
In fact, I'm not at aLL sure about Mr. Fischer or Miss Tanner.
Who is it, pLease?
You want to speak to me?
Are you the one that warned us to get out?
Yes, it is you, isn't it?
You must give me some sign.
You're not BeLasco, are you?
Such a pain wouLd not be in BeLasco.
I feeL your anguish.
Who are you?
DanieL?
DanieL BeLasco.
Very cLever.
If you're that cLever, why are you stiLL a prisoner in this house?
[Weeping]
Good morning.
Good morning.
You sLept weLL?
Fine. And you?
Yes, very weLL, thank you.
I think I have a partiaL answer to the haunting, Doctor.
That young man that warned us during the sitting came to my room Last night.
BeLasco's son.
Yes.
DanieL BeLasco.
He's very young and frightened.
Because he's so frightened, he's very hostiLe.
If I convince him to move on, the haunting force wiLL be eLiminated.
Do so by aLL means.
I'd Like to suggest another sitting, under scientific conditions this time.
Miss Tanner in apparent trance.
PuLse rate 85, respiration 1 5.
Four eLectric contacts maintained.
No change in temperature.
Steady at 73.2.
Dynamometer reading decreased to 1 823 now.
Temperature Lowering.
Now it's 69.6 degrees.
PuLse rate 94.5 and rising.
Temperature drop now 1 2.3 degrees.
Dynamometer reading reduced to 1 77 9.
Pressurometer negative.
ELectric contacts stiLL maintained.
Rate of breath increasing.
Rising steadiLy.
[CLicking]
Infrared rays broken.
Cameras activated.
Evidence of eLectromagnetic radiation commencing.
Medium's respiration 21 0.
Dynamometer 1 460.
Temperature...
[CLicking]
Evidence of ozone in the air.
EctopLasm forming.
Separate fiLaments exuding from fingertips of both hands uniting to form two separate strands.
Two strands moving toward each other.
EctopLasmic staLk through net, moving toward tabLe.
Leave a sampLe, pLease.
Leave a sampLe in the jar.
Aah!
Aah!
HoLd it.
She's aLL right.
Miss Tanner coming out of trance.
Premature retraction of ectopLasm causing brief systemic shock.
ConcLusion of sitting,
2:48 P.M.
I spoiLed your sitting, didn't I?
Not at aLL.
I couLdn't be more satisfied.
Take a Look.
What is it?
A specimen of that teLepLasm prepared in water.
What the spirituaLists refer to as ectopLasm is derived aLmost entireLy from the medium's body, the remainder being admixtures from the air, the medium's costume, fibrous remains, dust particLes.
But the buLk is organic Living matter, an organic externaLization of thought--
Mind reduced to matter.
She made that figure from herseLf?
I was visited by BeLasco's son again this afternoon.
Were you?
WiLL it never end?
WiLL what never end?
Your attitude of doubt and distrust.
Why shouLd mediums be expected to perform onLy under conditions that science dictates?
We're not machines!
I'm not a medium for fun.
Do you think--
I beLieve mediumship is God's manifestation in man.
''When I speak to thee,
I wiLL open thy mouth
''and thou shaLt say unto thee, thus saith the Lord. ''
There's nothing in the BibLe that doesn't occur today, be it sights or sounds, coming through cLosed doors,
Levitations, or the speaking in tongues!
Miss Tanner,
I don't know what this is about.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Oh!
No!
Mr. Fischer, you must go.
What do you mean?
You know.
You're the physicaL medium.
You're being used.
You're not in controL.
You've got to Leave!
Trying to get rid of us both now?
What do you mean?
Doctor, what do you mean?
I wouLd have thought that was obvious.
What is he saying?
That I'm responsibLe?
You're the one who shouLd
Leave this house.
You're the one who's being used, not me.
Do we have to stay?
This is important to me.
What if you're hurt again?
I won't be.
I'LL see to it!
SureLy you noticed how it aLL ended with a word from her, how I was the onLy one who was attacked.
I angered her.
You think Miss Tanner was responsibLe?
Not unassisted.
There's a Lot of power in this house, Ann.
She was the one who used it, though.
Directed it at me.
I made a mistake.
I accepted quiet, poLite behavior toward me at face vaLue.
You can't do that with a medium.
You never know what's underneath.
[knock On Door]
May I speak to you?
I'LL onLy be a moment.
Were you badLy hurt?
I'LL manage.
I know what happened now, Doctor.
It was BeLasco's son.
He's trying to separate us.
We're Less of a chaLLenge that way.
I'LL sit for you tomorrow.
There'LL be no further sittings.
You can't stop them now!
I'm doing so.
You don't think
I did aLL that?
I know it!
PLease.
I'm in considerabLe pain.
Doctor,
I am not responsibLe.
It was BeLasco's son.
Miss Tanner!
There is no such person.
You're wrong.
LioneL?
[Moaning]
[Moaning]
LioneL!
LioneL!
Where are you going now?
To Look for something.
Proof that
BeLasco's son existed?
I'm sorry if I insuLted you before.
Mrs. Barrett.
Mrs. Barrett!
You... me... that girL...
LioneL... aLL together... naked... drunk... cLutching... sweating... biting...
Aah!
You...
You were waLking in your sLeep.
Mrs. Barrett.
[Voices]
[Voices]
DanieL, I've found you.
[Chain RattLes]
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What is it?
What happened?
DanieL BeLasco.
I've found him.
WeLL, I'm not imagining it.
He attacked me.
Did I imagine this?
He's in there behind the waLL.
''Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
''O Lord, we beseech Thee
''mercifuLLy to receive
''the prayers of Thy peopLe
''and grant that they may know that which they ought to do. ''
FLorence.
FLorence.
Is that you?
HeLp me, FLorence.
Why? Why?
You shouLd have gone on.
You're my onLy hope.
Your body was buried.
I prayed for you.
PLease, FLorence.
No. You have to go.
You've been given your reLease.
You are my onLy hope.
You must go on.
You are my onLy hope,
FLorence.
What does he want?
No. I can't.
PLease, FLorence.
No. I can't.
No!
[Door Opens]
[Hiss]
What in the name of God?
[Cat Screeches]
Aah!
[Screech]
Oh!
Aah!
[Hiss]
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
[Screech]
FLorence.
FLorence.
[Whimpering]
Doctor.
Miss Tanner's been hurt again.
Where is she?
She's in her room.
She's been bitten and scratched.
How did it happen?
I don't know.
A cat, I think.
A cat?
It was possessed by DanieL BeLasco.
WouLd you Like me to examine you?
This wiLL prevent infection.
I'm aLL right.
I know you think--
It doesn't matter what I think.
What matters is your being mauLed.
I'm aLL right.
I wonder if that is so.
ShouLdn't you Leave?
No! I'm not Leaving now.
I'd be faiLing in my duty if I didn't warn you to Leave.
I don't want you to be another victim of HeLL House.
He's right, you know.
You shouLd Leave.
You're being torn to pieces.
You don't think
I'm doing this to myseLf?
Of course I don't.
You say it's DanieL BeLasco, but what if you're wrong?
What if you're being fooLed?
FooLed?
DanieL BeLasco does exist.
We found his body.
We Laid him to rest.
Why is he not at rest?
I think I know.
ControLLed muLtipLe haunting.
Something unique in haunted houses.
A surviving wiLL so powerfuL that he can use that power to dominate aLL other surviving sources.
You mean
Emeric BeLasco?
He's the one that's kept me from the chapeL.
He made it seem as if
DanieL possessed the cat.
He's the one that's keeping
DanieL's souL imprisoned here.
He's Like a generaL with his army--
Never entering the battLe, but aLways controLLing it.
Just what have you been doing,
Mr. Fischer?
Hmm?
Have you been drinking?
I don't think that's any of your business, aLthough I do think it's a very good idea.
Come on.
No.
You come on.
Mrs. Barrett.
Yes...Ben?
You shouLd not Leave your husband aLone.
Oh, I think he's aLL right.
He's sLeeping.
Mrs. Barrett, you must go back upstairs.
Did you know that this was where it aLL happened?
Where aLL what happened?
ALL that debauchery and vice.
Right here.
Right around this very tabLe.
Mrs. Barrett, you don't know what you're saying.
Oh, yes, I do.
I know exactLy what I'm saying,
Mr. Fischer.
Mr. B.F. Fischer.
Mrs. Barrett, it's this house.
It's making you--
This house isn't doing anything.
I'm doing it.
Touch me, or I'LL find somebody who wiLL!
No!
No!
Oh.
I know you won't forgive me...now.
I know what I did.
I'd give anything to undo it.
I just don't know why I went down those stairs.
I knew what I was doing.
I knew, but at the same time...
I'm not asking you to forgive me, but pLease, pLease don't hate me.
I need you.
I Love you.
I just don't understand what's happening to me.
I just don't understand.
It's aLL right.
It'LL pass after we've Left this house.
I Love you, too.
Doctor, I think your wife is in danger.
Mr. Fischer.
It was not her fauLt.
PLease, Mr. Fischer.
This is a matter of Life and death.
She waLked down here
Last night.
When?
Near midnight.
You were asLeep.
So was she.
She waLked in her sLeep?
Yes.
You shouLd have toLd me.
No, Doctor.
She shouLd have.
The fact that she didn't...
I don't think you know what's going on in this house.
What I think is irreLevant.
What the heLL do you mean by irreLevant?
Whatever is getting at your wife has aLready gotten to Miss Tanner and to you.
You're bLocking yourseLf off compLeteLy.
Mr. Deutsch is wasting a third of his money.
You're bLocking yourseLf off compLeteLy.
BLocking yourseLf off compLeteLy.
I am not bLocking anything.
I'm just not sticking my neck out the way I did in 1 953.
Aaah!
Aaaaaaahhh!
Uh!
Uh!
Uh!
Eee!
[knock On Door]
Ben? I've been think--
Give up.
Give up?
What's happened?
I thought we trusted each other.
I don't trust anyone or anything.
Anyone who does in this house is a fooL.
Something has happened.
Lots of things.
Nothing we can't handLe.
Wrong.
There is nothing in this house that we can handLe.
That's not true.
We've made wonderfuL progress.
Toward what?
Our graves?
DanieL and the way
BeLasco works.
DanieL!
DanieL! DanieL! DanieL!
How do you know he ever existed?
The body.
How do you know that he isn't a figment of your imagination?
How do you know his personaLity isn't what you made of it ?
I know I'm right.
We knew we were right in 1 953.
Grace Lauter, a successfuL medium for--
For 20 years.
She jumped off the baLcony, and she shattered both her Legs.
Dr. Graham... physicist.
He crawLed out of this house... to die.
Professor Rand, head of the chemistry department at the University of Oxford... paraLyzed.
Professor FenLey... psychic investigator... crippLed and insane to this day.
Yes, uh...
You're right.
I am obstructing.
You're quite right.
I'm shut off.
I am going to stay shut off untiL I am far away from this pLace.
I am going to coLLect my libras1 00,000, and I am never going to come within 1 ,000 miLes of this house for as Long as I Live, and I suggest you do the same.
Ben.
[Water Running]
Huh!
Aah!
Can I do anything to heLp?
I'm afraid not.
It's just too compLicated.
Thanks aLL the same.
What's it going to do,
LioneL?
You've heard me taLk about a power in this house.
It's a reaL power, Ann, a fieLd of measurabLe energy.
Energy that can be reversed.
That's what
I'm going to do.
By this time tomorrow,
HeLL House wiLL be de-energized.
You'LL see.
[CLapping]
That piLe of junk you have isn't going to do a thing.
Get her out of here!
You haven't a chance.
Have you?
Yes. I know the score.
You do not fight this house!
HeLL House doesn't mind a guest.
What it doesn't Like is peopLe who attack it.
BeLasco doesn't Like it.
His peopLe wiLL fight back, and they'LL kiLL you.
Leave that machine aLone.
When Sunday comes, teLL oLd Deutsch anything and bank the money.
If you try anything eLse, you wiLL be a dead man.
He won't Listen, wiLL he?
I was the onLy one to get out of here aLive and sane in 1 953.
I wiLL be the onLy one to make it out this time.
He's wrong.
I toLd you before, what FLorence Tanner beLieves is wrong.
I'm teLLing you now that Fischer is equaLLy wrong.
Tomorrow, it wiLL be proved.
FLorence.
FLorence.
HeLp me.
PLease.
PLease... heLp me.
[Moaning]
Love me.
[Roaring And Shrieking]
FLorence.
FLorence.
Don't go, FLorence.
HeLp me.
FLorence, heLp me.
HeLp me, FLorence.
HeLp me, FLorence.
[Voices Echoing]
FLorence.
DanieL, you must understand.
What you ask is impossibLe.
I can't.
I beLieve in you.
I've opened my heart to you.
PLease, heLp me.
PLease, Love me.
FLorence.
Love me.
No.
No.
PLease, heLp me.
FLorence.
PLease... heLp me.
Love me.
Dear God... reach down Your hand and give me
Your protection.
HeLp me this night to bring to Your care the tortured souL of DanieL BeLasco.
[Voices]
I give you now the Love you've never known.
I give it so you wiLL gain strength to Leave this house.
I Love you.
And I Love you.
With Love, pLease, with Love.
Hah!
Oh.
Ah.
Oh.
Oh.
FLorence.
Aaahh!
Aaaaahhh!
Mm hm hm!
FLorence.
How Long have you been here?
ALL night.
There?
Stupid.
You couLd have sLept with me.
Who put on my nightdress?
Mrs. Barrett.
Why didn't you do it?
My God.
He's inside me.
He Lied to me.
He said it was the onLy way.
But he's inside me!
I can feeL him just waiting in there to take over.
It wiLL be aLL right.
I wiLL take you out of here.
He won't Let me go.
He can't stop you.
He can.
He can't stop me.
[In Spirit's Voice]
Who do you think you are, you bastard?
You might have been hot stuff before, but now you're shit!
Dear God, heLp me.
I'm taking her away.
How are you,
Miss Tanner?
I'm aLL right.
You needn't come back,
Mr. Fischer.
The house wiLL be cLear.
CLear?
How?
There isn't time for expLanation.
Yes, there is.
FLorence.
I am not Leaving untiL I know.
ALL right.
The body emits a form of energy invisibLe to the human eye.
This energy can be expanded far beyond the body, where it can create mechanicaL, chemicaL, physicaL effects, sounds, moving objects
Like we've experieced.
The energy I taLk about is a fieLd of eLectromagnetic radiation.
E.M.R.
ExactLy.
ALL Living organisms emit this energy.
Such power must saturate its environment.
Is it any wonder that HeLL House is the way it is?
Consider the mentaL and physicaL energy which is being poured into its interior.
The house is a giant battery, the residuaL energy of which must be tapped.
We survive with this energy after death.
No, Miss Tanner.
This residue has nothing to do with surviving personaLities.
The spirit of Emeric BeLasco does not prowL this house.
Neither does his son or any other entities that you beLieve yourseLf to be in contact with.
There is one thing and one thing onLy in this house-- mindLess, directionLess power.
You're wrong, Dr. Barrett.
You cannot destroy a spirit.
ALL you wiLL do is send it to another heLL.
No, Miss Tanner.
I'm right.
My machine wiLL fiLL the house with a massive countercharge of eLectromagnetic radiation, opposing the poLarity of the atmosphere, reversing, and dissipating it.
And HeLL House wiLL be exorcised.
I see.
WeLL, there's nothing eLse to do then.
Barrett.
Ah!
Thank God she didn't know what to smash.
I shouLd be fLattered.
Her attack on the reverser was her uLtimate tribute.
She knows I'm right.
There was nothing eLse to do.
That's what she said.
She had to destroy my beLiefs before they destroyed hers.
DanieL?
[Roaring Noise]
[Crying]
Aah!
No!
[Voices]
Aah!
No!
Aaahh!
FLorence.
DanieL, you must Leave before it's too Late.
Soon you'LL be sent from this heLL to another.
Aah!
Where is Miss Tanner?
She was Lying over there.
Why didn't you watch her?
Ah! Oh!
FLorence.
You tricked me.
God heLp me, you tricked us aLL.
Ha ha ha!
Ah!
[Humming]
QuickLy.
[Voices]
You'LL have to open yourseLf to it, Mr. Fischer.
Try, Mr. Fischer.
I guarantee there'LL be no troubLe.
WeLL?
He's startLed because there's nothing to pick up.
Is it reaLLy over, LioneL?
Yes. It's over.
Done with, finished.
I can't beLieve it.
I know.
Do you mind if I say
I toLd you so?
What a pity
Miss Tanner died when the answer was so cLose.
Barrett.
Barrett, the house is cLear.
It is compLeteLy cLear!
And I caLLed that machine a piLe of junk.
You better go and get some rest.
I want to check my readings.
[CLicking]
[CLicking]
[Beeping]
[CLacking]
This is impossibLe.
I don't accept this.
I do not accept this!
LioneL?
LioneL.
LioneL!
In here.
LioneL?
Here.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
No!
No!
I'm sorry.
LioneL.
Oh, pLease get me out of here.
PLease.
I'm not Leaving.
I'm going back to the chapeL.
No. No, you can't.
You don't know what it's Like in there.
I have to.
You don't.
There is no reason to go back there.
None.
Ann, Listen.
I have to.
It's for FLorence.
It's for your husband.
If I Leave
HeLL House now, my whoLe Life wiLL be a faiLure.
You can't soLve it.
It cannot be soLved.
You're going to die...
Like LioneL,
Like Miss Tanner.
Then I wiLL.
It's here.
The entire house is cLear except for this one pLace.
Why?
Why?
Why?
BeLasco.
That's what the '' B'' inside the circLe means.
She was trying to teLL us that it was onLy
BeLasco aLL aLong.
It isn't mindLess, directionLess power.
It isn't muLtipLe hauntings.
It's onLy one.
One entity pretending to be DanieL.
One entity pretending to be many others.
That's where the answer Lies.
But what's the key?
What is the key?
Extremes and Limits.
Terminations and extremities.
Oh.
Oh, God.
Of course.
That's what she meant.
Extremes.
Limits.
Legs.
Grace Lauter's spine and Legs shattered.
Dr. Graham crawLing.
Professor Rand, paraLyzed.
Professor FenLey, crippLed.
FLorence's Legs crushed.
Your husband's...
''If thine eye offend thee... ''
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
BeLasco!
Whatever you do, do not interfere.
BeLasco.
Here I am.
Destroy me if you can.
Don't Leave the job haLf done.
We're here.
I'm here! kiLL me!
That's it.
Oh, that's it.
TeLL me something,
BeLasco.
Why didn't you ever
Leave this house when you were aLive?
Why did you despise the sunLight?
Was it better hiding in the shadows?
[Whining Noise]
No one...
No one couLd reaLLy see you then, couLd they?
No one couLd find out your secret then, couLd they?
You weren't a genius!
You were a deviate!
A sawed-off
LittLe bastard!
[Roaring Noise]
Your mother was a bitch!
A whore!
You were a bastard!
A funny LittLe dried-up bastard!
You're no genius!
You're no Roaring Giant!
What size were you,
BeLasco?
5-foot 2?
I know you weren't even
5-foot taLL.
Aah!
Emeric BeLasco.
The Roaring Giant.
Is it cLear?
This is a speciaL moment.
Meet Emeric BeLasco.
Your husband did have part of the answer.
FLorence had part of it, too.
I finaLLy found the Last part, that which
BeLasco's giant ego couLd not face.
He so despised his own shortness that he cut off his Legs and wore those instead to give himseLf height.
''If thine eye offend thee, pLuck it out.''
Maybe he was a genius after aLL.
Just because a man preserves his body doesn't make him a genius.
It's not his body of which I'm speaking.
This is why your husband's machine couLd not destroy his power.
These waLLs are sheathed with Lead.
He buiLt himseLf a fortress to protect his spirit.
He knew what was coming years before it came.
Your husband and FLorence heLped us to rid this house of BeLasco.
Let us hope that their spirits guide him to everLasting peace.
BeLasco.

The Soviet army completes the evacuation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.
Before fleeing, the S.S. attempted to execute all of the prisoners who had witnessed their crimes.
Toward the end, corpses were being burned right out in the open since there weren't enough ovens.
The neighboring Polish people were invited in to witness what was going on behind the barbed wire fences.
The prisoners had been tattooed for later identification.
Some were used in laboratory experiments, such as the removal of limbs, inoculation of viruses, implantation of cancer cells and skin grafts.
Many times children were used in these experiments.
This footage shows a trepanning designed to cause a complete and irreversible disturbance of the patient's nervous system.
These images, filmed by the cameras of the S.S., show family members bringing their dead to mass graves.
Bulldozers were necessary due to the massive number of corpses.
According to documents seized from Auschwitz authorities, close to 100,000 prisoners perished in the camps.
40,000 were children under the age of 14.
At the time the camp was liberated,
2,385 children were found still alive, most weakened by tuberculosis or acute anemia caused by malnutrition and a lack of medical care.
More than one million deaths resulted from the war between India and Pakistan.
Not all of the deaths however were casualties of war.
A large refugee population was driven into settlement camps where the weakest died from lack of food and water.
These images show the trucks that arrived daily to transport the corpses of the elderly and the children to mass graves.
Every year, the aid provided to India and
Pakistan by the United Nations remains insufficient.
UNICEF claims that a child dies every five seconds in this part of the world.
After more than 3 years of combat, the armistice that ended the Korean War is signed on July 24th.
Along with peace, the children of South Korea found shelter and food thanks toAmerican charity organizations and the aid of the government in Washington which built rehabilitation centers in the suburbs of Seoul.
In these centers, the children were fed, medically treated and rehabilitated on both a physical and mental level.
The innocent victims are taught to fend for themselves and to learn how to play sports.
With the war over and thanks to the humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of orphans have learned to regard the peace optimistically.
War continues along the
Indo-Chinese peninsula.
In many of the large cities of South Vietnam, there are anti-government demonstrations.
Grenades explode in the streets, killing both men and children.
The United States army sends in almost a half-million soldiers who, aided by their modern weaponry, hope to bring peace to Southeast Asia.
U.S. planes bomb military targets daily.
Sometimes, as seen in these images, the bombing affects the civilian population.
In the village of Tuyen Hoa, hundreds of women and children are killed or severely burned by napalm bombardments.
The Nigerian civil war has wreaked havoc for two years.
The southern tribes have finished surrounding the area of Biafra which had been hardest hit by the conflict.
The people are fleeing to the north, trying to find refuge in makeshift camps.
But in the camps, death lies in wait for the weakest and the most innocent, because of the lack of food and medical supplies.
Elsewhere, due to changes in climate, a six-month drought takes other victims in Mali,
Mauritania and Chad.
More than 11 million humans will be threatened with death from famine or thirst.
The aid received is insufficient and the need for food and medical supplies is urgent.
As always, those most heavily affected by these tragedies are the children.
The International Red Cross estimates that up until now, 300,000 children have died from hunger, dehydration and sickness.
Doesn't look like she drowned.
No. Look at this...
She has a knife wound.
And four more on her stomach.
She looks like a foreigner.
It looks like she was thrown off a boat, and the tide carried her onto the beach.
Look, there are more wounds on her thigh.
Whoever did this was sick in the head.
Wake up!
Benavis!
Excuse me, but what's going on?
It's the annual Fiesta of Benavis.
Damn, we need film for the camera!
Yes, but first we need a hotel.
Yeah, let's go.
Sir, excuse me.
Would it be possible to get a room, just for a few hours?
I'm very sorry, sir, madam.
At this time of the year, all of the rooms are reserved well in advance.
Reserved?
Yes sir, all of the hotels here are completely full.
All of them?
Yes, but I can give you an address.
It's a house owned by a woman I know
Sometimes she has rooms available.
It's in the old quarter of the city.
Tell her I sent you.
I'm sure you will like her, she's very friendly.
Thank you. Goodbye
Is it nearby?
Yes.
Thanks.
This is the only room I have.
Oh, it's fine.
It's a bit noisy, but the room has good lighting.
The bathroom's down at the end of the hall.
Will you be staying for some time?
Only 15 days.
Here in Benavis?
No, we just came here to rest up.
There are too many tourists here.
Where are you going then?
The island of Almandora.
Where?
The island of Almandora.
Oh, you mean Almanzora.
Oh, it's pronounced Almanzora?
We are right here... in Benavis.
Almanzora is right around here.
If you're looking for peace and quiet, you'll find it onAlmanzora.
Very few tourists ever go to the island.
It takes about 4 hours to get there by boat.
Yes, i've been to Almanzora before.
I went there on a vacation eleven years ago.
Can you tell where I can rent a boat?
Rent?
Yes, I want to rent a boat.
There's a fisherman who handles the mail going to the island.
He goes there twice a week to bring and pick up the mail.
I would prefer to have my own boat and not have to rely on anyone else.
To travel and to go fishing...
Go down to the port and ask for Enrique Amors.
He's the guy who takes care of the mail, and he also has boats to rent to tourists. oh good. Amors...
Is your wife going with you?
Yes. Why?
I just asked because there are no doctors on
Almanzora.
Don't worry. I'm almost a doctor.
I'm a professor of Biology,
Then there's no problem.
Would you like a map?
Yes, thanks.
I think Benavis is beautiful.
Yes, but I preferAlmanzora.
I like Benavis.
There's too many people here.
To get to the water, you have to climb over all the people laying in the sand.
Let me take a picture of you.
Sit there. Perfect!
Stand like this?
Oh no, we forgot to buy the film!
How may I help you?
Good afternoon.
I need six rolls of film for my camera.
- Color?
- Yes.
Tom. What's this about?
In spite of their suicidaI sacrifice,
the demonstrators'protests have been futile.
Together with the remnants of the Thai army,
the civilian population flees toward the port of
Phuket in an attempt to reach
the American navaI ships on which they will be transported to the Phillipines.
Although Bangkok's defenses have collapsed, they have managed
to establish an air strip for the evacuation of the capitoI where chaos reigns.
Corpses have been piling up while UNICEF and the InternationaI Red Cross
request aid for the more than 3o,ooo orphaned and injured children.
With the fall of Thailand, it is obvious that...
You said six rolls, right?
Yes.
The whole world is crazy,
In the end, the ones who always suffer the most are the children.
From War?
The children!
From Famine?
The children!
He's right. How horrible!
Yes.
30,000 they said?
That'll be 1,032 pesetos.
What a nice day to take pictures!
Evie? Where are you going?
I want you to take a picture of my first swim in Benaviz.
It's so warm.
What did you say?
Never mind.
What's happening?
I don't know.
Are you happy?
Are you HAPPY?
From their pallor, they sure don't look like sunbathers.
They go to the beach at night.
Do you want to sit down for awhile?
Where?
There are too many people here!
Yeah, especially since now you count as two,
What are you thinking about?
Nothing.
What are you thinking about?
Nothing
I was just looking at the sea.
- Almandora is -
- Alman-zora, you mean?
It's right out there on the horizon.
And what else?
What else were you thinking about?
Well...
I was thinking about the conversation we had with the camera shop owner.
According to him, the world has gone insane, and those who suffer the most are always the children.
Now that Thailand has fallen, all of Asia is headed for Communism.
War breaks out in China following the death of Mao.
But there's no war here in Benavis...
That's true, but there was a civil war once in Benavis, and it could happen again some day.
Do you remember La Dolce Vita?
La Dolce Vita?
It's a very famous old Italian film.
There is a character of a man who is very nice, quiet, has two kids, loves his wife. he lives his life as if he hasn't a problem in the world.
Suddenly one night, he takes a gun and kills his two children and then commits suicide.
Why?
I imagine he was trying to save them from the world that was waiting for them.
Do you want to kill it?
We already have two kids.
We can handle three.
And thanks to him,
I'll get to see Almanzora.
Do you regret it?
No, not at all.
So he brought himself to kill his children... just to protect them from the world we have created?
What was the director's name?
An Italian of course.
Afascist just like Mussolini.
They're all crazy.
What was that?
More fireworks.
You were right.
About what?
Almanzora will be much nicer.
Everything's so crowded here and it's way too noisy,
Too crowded... much too crowded...
TWO CORPSES WASH UP ON BEACH
They just put in this motor two days ago.
Do you know how to get there?
Yes.
Ask him if we're going to be able to find lodging on the island.
Please tell me. Will we be able to find a hotel onAlmanzora?
There's a boarding house there.
If you had been to the island before, you would know that.
It's called the Pensione Estrella.
Since there aren't many tourists there, it's always half empty.
Hand me that suitcase.
Give me your hand, miss?
No, not here. You sit up front.
Why? What's the difference?
Your husband will sit back here to steer the boat.
Up there? Ok, no problem.
Are you sure you can handle this motor?
Oh, sure, don't worry about it.
Tell Cesareo that I already received the cases of beer.
Cesareo?
Yes, the guy in the bar?
Oh never mind, I'll see him tomorrow when I bring the mail over to Almanzora.
The sea is calm, so you should get there in about four hours.
See you later!
Have a good trip!
We'll see you in fifteen days.
Don't you know he's the mailman for the island?
We'll be seeing him tomorrow.
Until tomorrow then!
I'm sorry I can't go for a swim.
Try splashing some water on your face.
It's not the same thing.
The water's so clear.
I can see everything!
Look! A flower!
It must have come from Almanzora.
Almanzora?
The current's so strong, it often brings all kinds of stuff from the island, like leaves and plants, to the beach at Benavis.
We're going to have such a good time here!
Look! There it is.
It's really quiet.
How can you tell?
Long after we left Benavis,
I could still hear the crowds on the beach.
Now as we get nearer to the island,
I can't hear a thing but the wind.
Let's give them a hand.
Be careful, don't hit the boat.
Give me a hand.
Thanks, kids.
Let's go in the water.
I'm coming!
Let's go, Manolo!
Hi there, what are you trying to catch?
Tell me. What are you fishing for?
What are you using for bait?
Come on, Tom. Can we go now?
It's so hot.
I should've brought a hat.
We can buy you one here.
Listen.
To what?
Nothing...
...only the sea, the wind, the sea gulls...
And the sun!
It's terrible!
I love those arches!
Madam, allow me to present the Plaza Mayor.
What a pleasure!
There's the coffee shop... and the customs office.
Nothing's changed in eleven years.
Tom, what's that over there?
Where?
It's an ice cream cart.
Go buy me one.
Excuse me.
Anybody here?
There's nobody there.
It doesn't matter.
We can serve ourselves and just leave the money on top.
It's all melted!
There's a bar.
There's nobody in here either.
It looks like they all left in a hurry.
It's strange...
What?
Nobody's been here for awhile.
What do you mean?
This thing looks like it's been going for hours.
Tom, I'm dying of thirst and I'm hungry!
Let's see what they got here.
There's plenty to drink.
Coca Cola... cold beer.
And to eat?
All I see is sugar and some burnt chickens.
Ahh, I think there used to be a little grocery store...
...just around the corner.
Are you coming?
No, not me.
It's hot and i'm tired.
I'll wait here for you.
I'll be right back.
Hi, come on in.
What's your name?
What's your name?
Come on, tell me.
What's your name?
Lourdes.
I'm pregnant, see?
Why are you doing that?
Some day you'll have a baby too.
Please stay here?
Please come back?
Hello?
Did you see anyone there?
But Tom, it's not possible.
This place is rather unique, you know.
Whenever there's a fiesta, all the people leave and go to the other side of the island.
How about you?
What about me?
Did you see anyone?
Yes, I did. A little girl, but she ran away.
This is all I could find.
Bread, sausages, fruit, sardines... and a hat for you... and a doll for Rosie.
Do you like it?
What are we going to do, Tom?
First we'll have a bite to eat, and then we'll go look for our hotel.
Please come here.
Come here!
Hold it... don't go.
Don't go!
There has to be people on the island because if there are children here, then that means...
Who turned the electricity off?
The rotisserie stopped.
I did it. What i'm afraid of is...
Our first meal on Almanzora!
We have everything we need... plates, utensils...
If you would kindly follow me, madam.
Right this way.
Please have a seat.
I'll be your chef... and your waiter too.
Fine napkins and...
It rang a few minutes ago.
I picked it up, but there was no one on the line.
Hello?
Hello?
I can't understand you.
What did you say?
Please speak English.
I can't understand what you're saying.
Please speak louder, in English or Spanish?
Hello?
Hello?
Who was it?
I don't know, but it sounded like a child.
What language?
German, Dutch... maybe Swedish.
I really couldn't tell.
Tom, you told me there were no telephones on the island.
There wasn't a direct line to the continent.
Since that time, they must have installed a local system.
At least now we know we're not the only people on the island.
Was it the same voice?
Yes.
How many people live on this island?
I don't know. Maybe 100... 200.
When do they leave for their fiesta, do you remember?
Did they always leave the village this deserted?
It's possible, but I went with them so I didn't stay to see.
They were really great fiestas.
Everyone would bring their guitar.
They would sing songs and set off fireworks.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Tom, isn't this the place?
Yeah. Let's go inside.
It's not possible that there is no one in this entire village.
What are we going to do?
We wait.
At least it's nice and cool here.
Someone will come.
Is there a shower around here?
What did you say?
I'm so tired and I smell like sweat.
What I would give for a shower!
Look, Evie.
There are other tourists on the island.
Are they British?
German
They're a married couple with a daughter.
Do you think it was German?
Who?
The voice on the phone.
You said the voice sounded very young and that she might have been German.
Where are you going?
The keys to Rooms 6 and 7 are missing.
I'm going to check up there.
Tom, come here! Look!
I knew the village couldn't be completely abandoned.
I don't see anyone.
There was someone.
I saw an old man cross the street.
He's still there on the corner.
Look, down at the very end of the street.
You can see his cane.
Ok, i'll go and see.
Look, a little girl!
Tom, what is she doing?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
Why?
Tell me why you did it?
Why?
Come back.
Come back here!
What happened to that old man?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
Nothing.
Tom, what happened?
Listen, the little girl... with the cane... she was playing with the old man.
Then accidentally, she...
What are you talking about?
I saw her beat the old man.
I swear to you, she was only playing.
It's the truth.
You're lying!
Why the hell would you lie to me?
I saw you carrying his body,
What happened?
She hit him, and he was hurt pretty bad.
Why didn't you bring him back here?
I took him home to his house.
You're lying.
Listen, I'm telling you the truth!
I brought him home to his house.
It was right there on the corner.
I saw her beat that old man.
Then I saw you carrying him in your arms.
Where did the little girl go?
I left them both there together.
Please, Tom, stop lying to me!
She hit him with the cane accidentally, and his forehead was bleeding.
It was an accident... nothing more.
Honey, in your condition, you really shouldn't be getting upset.
There are some strange things happening on this island, and I feel as if you're doing everything you can to hide them from me.
If something bad is happening here, whatever it is, we should leave right away,
Hello?
Hello?
Please speak slowly and louder.
Are you Mrs. Brit Vandenholder?
Don't go up there. Please don't go!
They might be up in their room.
- Stay back!
- Who are you?
Keep away!
It's really hot outside.
You should rest awhile.
You're here on vacation, right?
I'm going to talk to that man.
What's happening on the island?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Please, relax.
Feel better now?
What is happening onAlmanzora?
The night before last... it was around 11:30.
Suddenly we heard voices and children laughing.
Laughing?
Yes, it was as if every boy and girl in the village all woke up at the same time.
They were all screaming and laughing.
They split up into small groups.
They went into people's houses as if it was a party... but no... because as soon as they went inside, we'd hear men and women screaming. screams from men and women!
Then they'd come out laughing and go into the next house... and the next... and the next!
My wife went down to see what was going on, while I stayed at the window
She was standing in the doorway, watching.
A group of children came out of one of the houses toward her.
I thought they were playing... but they had knives and clubs in their hands.
I had a shotgun in my room, and I grabbed it...
...but I didn't do anything.
No one in the village did a damn thing, do you understand?
Because...
...who can kill a child?
I was afraid, so i hid in a tiny room in the attic.
I could hear them looking for me.
I was so afraid, until I heard your voices.
I don't know anything more.
Nothing else!
How did you injure yourself?
When I left my room, it was dark.
I tripped and fell on the floor
Is it possible there are other people still alive on this island?
No, I don't think so.
There are a few fisherman up on the north shore, and a few farms in the middle of the island.
Sounds like it's only happening on Almanzora.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
Hello?
Where are you?
Where are you?
She was cut off.
It's the girl. The girl from the room.
Where can she be calling from?
She might be using the village switchboard.
Where's that?
In the Post Office.
Post Office?
Yes, after you go out of the hotel, you make a left and it's about 300 meters away, on the first floor.
Evie, you stay right here with him.
I'm going to try to find her, and then I'll be right back.
Sir, it is imperative that we leave here right away... all three of us and now!
Believe me, Evelyn, we have to get out of this place!
Why?
Help me please?
Aunt Isabel is sick.
They're at grandma's house, and grandma is sick too!
They can't breathe and I'm scared.
The children hurt them bad.
Come with me, Papa.
Please stay here?
She's my daughter.
Let's go.
Where are they going?
Evelyn, you must do exactly as I tell you.
Tom, what's going on?
What were all those screams?
Listen, the only way we can get out of here is to run.
I know in your condition, you shouldn't be running, do you understand?
Even when you have no strength left in your body, you must keep running till we get to the boat.
We can't stop for anything, do you understand?
I understand.
Ok then... let's go!
No, Tom, I can't go on.
Evie, get up and run!
We can't stop now. We will not stop!
Get up on your feet.
We'll run together. I'll hold you.
Let's go! We've got to run!
Evie, try harder!
Run, Evie!
They're only children!
Only kids!
What did that man at the hotel say about all this?
I don't know. Something strange has affected all the children on the island.
What did he mean?
I don't know. Some type of mass insanity. I don't understand it.
Where are we going now?
To the other side of the island, where the fishermen live.
Hopefully we'll find a boat.
What about all of the adults on Almanzora?
Where are they, Tom?
There's a boat.
Why did you stop?
There are some children down there.
Tom, what is happening to the children?
I don't know.
It seems incredible, but they've all gone crazy.
All this violence seems so unbelievable.
I don't understand why they're attacking everyone.
It's as if they feel we are their enemies.
Maybe the children, out of sheer instinct, are just starting to...
To what?
Let's go.
Did anything strange happen here last night?
Last night?
Are there any other people inside the house?
Here now?
Are there any other people living here?
My mother and the children.
Please, we need to hire a boat to get us to Benavis.
Go to the town on the other side of the island.
No, that's not possible.
My husband and my brother-in-law have a fishing boat.
Yes. Where are they now?
They're out at sea.
They should be back before sunset.
That boat there's no good, it has a big hole in the bottom.
Tom, I feel a bit faint.
Ma'am, can we rest here for a little while?
Yes, come in. Come inside.
How many months is she?
Six months.
Your first child?
No, we have two others back home.
You don't look it.
Drink this. You'll feel better.
What is it?
Don't worry. Just drink it.
Why are you bothering those people?
Oh, these children!
Go down and play on the beach!
They drive me crazy.
Please forgive them.
Are they all your children?
Yes, all four of them.
Let's go.
We have to get out of here.
Sir, wait!
They'll be coming back very soon now. Sir!
Children, what did I say to you?
Go and wash up!
And you two, go on home now
Didn't you hear me?
It's possible all of the kids from the village are coming this way.
But Tom, we might...
We'll have to use the Jeep to drive straight across the town and get to the boat, no matter who gets in our way!
No matter who?
If any of the kids get in our way,
I don't care what happens to them.
What do you mean?
We have to get to the boat!
They're leaving.
Until now, no one has dared to kill one of them.
That's why they weren't afriaid.
But they are now.
Tomorrow morning, the man will come to the island with the mail, and maybe some other people will come with him.
There's nobody outside.
Calm down.
Do those kids realize what they're doing?
I don't know.
A normal child is incapable of killing another human being.
To tell you the truth,
I thought I was incapable of it too, but now I've killed one of them.
Try to relax.
Calm down.
Water?
Evie, what is it?
What's the matter with you?
Help me.
Please help me!
I'm in pain!
Something's hurting me bad.
Don't get up. Lie down.
No! Don't do that! No, Tom!
No, the pain isn't the same...
...like when Richard and Rosie were born.
Help me Tom.
I'm in pain. Help me.
Tom, touch it!
Touch it with your hands.
Do you feel it?
There it is again.
It's tearing me apart.
Help me!
That's not true. Relax,
It's ripping and tearing at my stomach!
Please no!
It's tearing me apart
That's not true.
I feel it inside me. It's killing me!
Do you hear them laughing?
They're outside!
They're laughing because they know that the child I'm carrying inside
It's one of them.
It's killing me!
In that bar, a little girl came up to me... and touched me.
I'm sorry
...she touched our baby!
I'm sorry...
...where's Rosie?
Where's Richard?
It's them!
It's them!
It's them!
Stop!
Stop!
It's them!
What has he done?
Where are all the townspeople?
Goodbye.
Hi, how's it going?
Are you going to the mainland?
Why don't we all go?
Because we'd attract too much attention in Benavis.
Do you think the children there will start playing the way we do?
Yes, of course.
There are lots of children in the world.
Lots of them
Chapter One.
This is the story behind one of the greatest manhunts in history.
Maybe you read about it, or what they let you read about it, probably as some minor item buried on the back page.
However, what happened in that city between May 16th and May 28th of this year was so incredible that to this day the facts have been suppressed in a massive effort to save certain political careers from disaster and law enforcement officials from embarrassment.
This will be the last time I will ever discuss these events with anyone, so when you have finished this bizarre account, judge for yourself its believability, and then try to tell yourself, wherever you may be,
"It couldn't happen here."
Sunday, May 16th.
At approximately 2:30 A. M.,
Cheryl Hughes was standing at the intersection of Casino Center and Fremont Street waiting for a girlfriend to give her a lift home.
Cheryl Hughes was 23,
5 feet 51/2 inches tall,
118 pounds, blonde hair, light brown eyes, swing shift change girl at the Gold Dust Saloon.
Cheryl Hughes, tired and hungry, but just mad enough to walk the eight blocks to her small frame house off the corner of 9th and Bridger.
Cheryl Hughes.
En route to her doom.
That's odd,
No evidence of dependent lividity, either,
Peel back the chest flap, please,
This should do it,
It's incredible,
Begin the gross work on internal organs,
I'm going to phone the district attorney,
And don't talk about this, to anyone,
I came into it two days later, called back 97 miles from the first vacation
I had had in 21/2 years because the story is so big no one else can handle it, according to our lovable managing editor.
Rumor has it that the day
Anthony Albert Vincenzo was born, his father left town.
The story may be apocryphal, but I believe it.
The only point I wonder about is why his mother didn't leave, too.
Good morning, slaves,
- We are not amused,
- Kolchak, you are on it,
A two-day old, third-rate murder...
- You are on it,
- What about them?
They have other assignments,
You're beautiful when you're angry,
Out,
First stop, County General, to see one of my most reliable spies... at least, he used to be reliable.
Hello, Carl,
I thought you were disbarred for malpractice,
I thought we were rid of you for two weeks,
So did I,
Well, about this
Cheryl Hughes thing... why does it say "officially undetermined" under "cause of death"?
- Why don't you ask the coroner?
- Come on, you're my spy here,
Haven't I kept quiet about all those illegal operations you've been performing in closets?
Tell me true, was there anything unusual about the autopsy?
- No, She lost a lot of blood,
- Some spy,
I'm just a poor doctor that occasionally takes pity on an aging reporter,
Dr, O'Brien,
Any messages for me?
Sounds like a Pulitzer Prize story to me,
Second stop, the Gold Dust Saloon and a chat with Gail Foster, one of Cheryl Hughes' fellow workers and a rather close friend of mine.
Poor Cheryl,
I feel just terrible about it,
If you don't want to talk about it, you don't have to,
No, I want to help if I can,
You said that she never had any boyfriends,
No, none that I ever heard of,
She dated once in a while, but never the same man twice,
I don't think she liked men,
- Yeah?
- Yeah,
She even took karate lessons in case one got fresh with her,
You mean that she knew karate?
Yeah, Brown belt,
Oh, I see him,
I've got to go, Bye-bye,
In any town the size of Las Vegas, the murder of one young woman hardly causes a ripple.
But then the ripples started.
Thursday, May 20th,
7:02 A. m.
Over there,
I didn't go down, I couldn't,
Okay, okay,
Don, take his statement,
What took you so long, Kolchak?
I got a flat tire,
Not a footprint in sight,
- Is that physically possible?
- If it happened, it's possible,
- It sure looks like it happened,
- Well, come on,
Bonnie Reynolds, 27, divorced, cocktail waitress at the Harem Room Casino.
Look at her throat!
She must have lost an awful lot of blood,
Cheryl Hughes lost a lot of blood, too,
You read that in the newspapers?
No, I didn't read that in the newspapers,
This girl lost a lot of blood, Sheriff, but she didn't lose it here,
Anything?
We found a purse,
There's signs of a struggle up here,
But nothing in between,
Only our footprints,
What did he do, throw her?
Who said Bonnie Reynolds was thrown
22 feet into that culvert? The coroner?
I haven't heard about it,
Who said this new killing is connected with the Cheryl Hughes murder?
The police?
Not to me, they haven't,
Who said Cheryl Hughes died of massive blood loss?
The coroner again?
He hasn't even turned in his report yet,
And who, may I ask, said that a super-powerful madman is running loose in Las Vegas?
You hearing voices, Kolchak?
I did not make up the facts on this story,
I know you're bored,
Big-time reporter like you, condemned to the sticks with us journalistic rubes,
I know you'd like a big, fat byline on a big, fat story so you can pay your way back to a big, fat city job, but Kolchak,
I expect you to report, not to come up with fairy tales,
And, Kolchak...
Quit bugging the P.D.
If something turns up, they'll let us know,
Meanwhile, use your head and lay off,
Whatever they're up to, they don't want any help from amateur bloodhounds like you,
Friday, May 21st, 8:06 A. m.
Apartment of Carol Hanocheck, swing shift cocktail waitress in the Bird of Paradise
Show Lounge.
She'd gotten home around 2: 15 A. M., poured herself a glass of milk, opened the back door of the kitchen for reasons unknown, and died like the others... suddenly, quietly, without disturbing her sleeping roommate only a few feet away.
Something of a pattern had started to form, and it was ugly.
It was then that people stopped talking.
Does that surprise you?
Look, you're not the only one that likes to play detective,
The police, the Sheriff boys, they all think they're pretty good,
And they don't need you,
You know, you really make me feel wanted,
We've had three murders in town, Bernie,
We have one tremendously strong guy, maybe more, who goes around killing young girls, and they all lost a lot of blood,
You aren't supposed to know about that,
I'm not supposed to know about that, And I know it,
What about your people down at the Bureau?
No, this is nothing for the Bureau to mess with at this stage,
You could make some unofficial inquiries for me,
Like?
You could check around the country and check all the hospitals and see if any of them have had corpses recently like ours, all with a big loss of blood,
You could check all the insane asylums across the country, see if they released recently a nut who thinks he's Count Dracula, even if he hasn't done anything to prove it,
Do you believe in vampires, little boy?
That's funny, That's very funny,
That's very funny, Bernie,
Are you gonna do it, or sit there like a cheap goniff guzzling my beer?
I'll think about it, okay?
Meanwhile, I hope it doesn't disillusion you to know that the local law enforcement people go along with your views... somewhat,
At this moment, they're waiting for a special report from the coroner and two pathology experts who were flown up from L.A.P.D. along with a small truckload of equipment,
Oh, hi, Marilyn, how are you?
- I like your luncheon place,
- Yeah,
If you want to hear that special report, meet me at the sheriff's office,
Starts at 6:30,
- Hey, thanks,
- Don't thank me, Just be there,
Where are you going?
Mr. Kolchak, telephone please.
Mr. Kolchak.
Carl Kolchak, telephone, please.
Carl Kolchak.
Kolchak,
Hi, Carl,
I heard the Parkway Hospital was knocked over,
Knocked over for what?
Cash, drugs, equipment, what?
Blood?
That's right,
Every container in the place,
Their entire stock,
What about blood type?
Seems blood type and Rh factor didn't much matter,
- Can't stop now, See you,
- Yeah, but...
6:30 p. M.,
Clark County Courthouse.
Present in addition to myself and two incompetents who called themselves reporters were Warren Butcher of the Sheriff's Office,
Thomas Paine of the District Attorney's Office,
Captain Edward Masterson of the Las Vegas Police Department, and old buddy Bernie Jenks.
Holding forth with his inimitable cool,
Dr. Robert Makurji, boy coroner.
We found that death in each case was extremely swift, coming in something less than a minute,
After the initial wounds were inflicted, the blood was drained very quickly, some kind of suction device being used,
This would explain why no blood was found anywhere in the victims or in the areas they were discovered,
Doctor, Kolchak, Daily News.
Do you have any idea what could have made these wounds?
They're not unlike the bite of a medium-sized dog,
What do you mean, dog?
What are you telling us, a dog did these murders?
I didn't mean to indicate the wounds were actually inflicted by a dog, only that they're similar to those which might be caused by a dog,
A rather interesting point is that we found another substance mixed in with the traces of blood in the throat wounds, namely saliva,
What do you mean, saliva?
I mean saliva, Sheriff Butcher,
Human saliva,
If Makurji had suggested that the murders were committed by a giant butterfly, he couldn't have made more sparks.
Now... what do you mean, human?
Are you suggesting that each of these women was bitten in the throat by a man?
At present, the evidence points that way,
However, I couldn't and wouldn't hazard a guess as to motivation,
I can only be sure they each died from shock induced by massive loss of blood,
Dr, Makurji, is it possible that he killed these women by biting them in the throat for the express purpose of drinking their blood?
Kolchak, you're here by the mutual suffrage of us all,
- Sufferance,
- What?
It's "sufferance," Sheriff,
Well, whatever it is, just shut up!
I'll answer that,
There have been cases of people who, through some mental derangement, have come to believe they were vampires,
In Germany in the 1920s, there was one fellow who did use his teeth to rip out his victims' throats,
We are not going to jump to any conclusions about who or what killed these women,
It is possible, you know, to type a person's blood from his saliva,
If I were you gentlemen,
I'd look for a very anemic fellow, possibly with some rare blood disease,
I don't care what kind of a nut killed these women,
But I'll tell you this... he's out there, and I'll bet he's high on pot or the hard stuff, and he's going to kill again unless he's stopped,
What have your people got on this Parkway blood theft?
Well, the latest is the nurse said she saw something funny out there last night or early this morning,
Seems that a tall, skinny guy dressed as an orderly was nosing around the refrigerated storage area,
That's where they keep the blood and the plasma,
She didn't think much of it then, but later when she spoke about the guy to the floor super, she was told that there was no such tall, skinny guy on duty there,
Description as follows... white male adult...
6- feet-2 to 6-feet-4, thin, about 175 pounds with pale complexion,
Dark hair,
So we start looking for a man, local resident or, worse yet, some outsider who may not even still be in the area,
We'll check the airport, the bus terminal, railroad station, blockade the highways, and if we're lucky, we'll get him, if he's stupid enough to still be hanging around after three crimes,
You got any other suggestions?
Just do it,
All right, let's break this up,
Thank you, Doctor MA...
MA...
Thank you, doctor,
Mr. Paine, I shouldn't be too inclined to reject Mr. Kolchak's theory out of hand if I were you,
It is at best highly speculative, but not altogether unwarranted,
You can throw away that cassette,
Now, this "vampire" stuff is to stay right in this room,
Until we have the assailant in custody, we say nothing about these women being drained of blood,
There will be no rumors, no reports in the paper,
The official opinion at this time is that the cause of death is undetermined,
We don't want to cause a panic,
It's bad for police operations,
It's bad for the people,
And it's bad for business,
Thank you for your cooperation,
Kolchak, I want to have a talk with you,
Boys, there's no reason to bother the doctor anymore,
I have a prepared statement in my office,
You can go back to the lab,
You're becoming a real pest,
I'll have to have a word or two with Vincenzo about you,
Maybe one of the other boys at the office should handle this from here on,
Keep your nose clean, son,
Stay out of other people's business,
It's healthier that way,
Will you watch what you're saying?
You know these guys,
You could find yourself out of a job and 86'd all over town,
That go for you, too?
Who can talk to you when you get like this?
Listen, I'll nose around unofficially for you on anything you bring me, just between the two of us, but do me a favor and stay away from me for a few days, just for friendship's sake,
Did I say it was a vampire?
What does your suggested headline say?
The story makes it clear,
"Vampire Killer in Las Vegas," question mark, Do I misread?
The story makes it clear,
Do I misread, or did you use the word "vampire"?
Some screwball who imagines he's a vampire is loose in Las Vegas, and people ought to be told,
If there's a screwball loose in Las Vegas, his last name begins with a "K,"
I've heard about the little scene you had with the boys downtown,
No vampire stories, clear?
How about a special featurette with a border of roses... an interview with the two girl victims in heaven, with a celestial choir in the background,
Out!
I'm sorry,
I guess I fell asleep,
Yes,
What were you saying?
You do great things for my masculine ego, you know?
Yeah,
Actually, I was saying that
I think that Vincenzo has the news sense of a tree stump,
It's got to be one man,
It's got to be,
Big, strong, psychotic,
You're certainly making me very glad that I work nights,
Well, I told you to quit working nights, didn't I?
I am forever in your debt, love,
What was that?
The killer's done it again,
Oh, no,
Only this time, he was seen,
I saw him standing over there,
I thought he was kissing her,
Then he turned, and she fell down over there by the car,
He must have followed her home,
I'm sorry, I can't,
Victim number four.
Mary Branden, showgirl, 25, five feet eight inches tall,
125 luscious pounds... less the weight of
12 pints of blood, of course.
Looks like Bela Lugosi struck again,
Knock it off,
That's her daughter,
Oops,
I'm all right now,
Now, the car he drove away in... was it new?
No,
It was a few years old, I think,
It was a maroon coupe,
I'll call it in,
Barney, may I, uh...?
Yeah, but take it easy,
I'm sorry, ma'am,
Kolchak, the Daily News.
That was your daughter?
My best contact in Las Vegas has always been Helen O'Brien, chief switchboard operator at the county courthouse.
Hello, adorable,
You're a sadist,
Oh, I could take it back,
Over my dead, plump body,
Listen, you magnificent morsel, the DMV is checking on the suspect's car,
You couldn't help me in that area, could you?
Of course not,
Bribed again,
What?
How'd you like to see the killer's face?
Sherman Duffy of the Chicago Globe once described a reporter as follows... socially, he fits in somewhere between a hooker and a bartender.
Spiritually, he stands beside Galileo, because he knows the world is round.
Not that it does much good when his editor knows it's flat.
Shelley Forbes has got to be his fifth victim,
Look at the way her dog was killed,
- You never give up, do you?
- What do you mean?
I mean this is unacceptable,
I'm very close to firing you, even though the owner of this paper has a soft spot in his head for has-been big city reporters,
I am tired of your pressure,
I am tired of the owner's pressure,
I'm tired of the pressure all around me to blow this story up on the one hand and keep it under wraps on the other,
I am tired of being the middleman,
Do you understand that?
Can you understand that?
What do you want, Vincenzo?
A testimonial from Count Dracula?
Out! Get out!
What is this "Out! Out!
Get out!" game we play?
This nut thinks he is a vampire,
He has killed four, maybe five women,
He has drained every drop of blood from every one of them,
Now, that is news, News!
And we are a newspaper!
We are supposed to print news, not suppress it!
You know darn well why we're soft-pedaling this thing,
No! Tell me why!
Could it be because we have been told to?
You are an idiot,
Worse, You're irresponsible,
All these murders mean to you is a byline,
What difference does it matter what it means to me?
The point is that we are suppressing news, we are withholding information,
Everybody in town knows what's going on... the police, the D.A... the coroner's office,
Every reporter on every newspaper in Las Vegas knows what's going on,
The only people who don't know are the people,
At last you got the point,
The people in Las Vegas don't know, because the people would come unglued if they did know, even more than they're coming unglued already, Capisce?
Tuesday, May 25th,
7:30 p.m.
Helen O'Brien had told me that the DMV had come up with 16 possibles.
All but one had been eliminated.
The car owner's name,
Martin Lubin, address on Spring Mountain Road, name and address both phony.
Name of salesman who sold car, Fred Hurley.
So I sets him a price,
He don't say nothing, just stands there looking at me,
How'd you find out about this?
A fat little bird told me about it,
- Just keep your mouth shut,
- Yes, sir,
Okay,
Well, like I said, he just stands there looking at me,
Then he tells me the price is too high...
$300 too high,
He keeps staring, as if daring me to tell him the price is $1200,
Is this the fellow?
Stop doing our job for us,
That's already been established,
You see, I told them only he had a mustache,
Mustache, Did you sell him the car?
Well, I started to say no, but something inside tells me,
"Don't mess with this guy,"
I mean, he's a creep, with them red eyes and that voice,
He's enough to keep a guy from working nights,
All my life I've waited for a story like this, All my life!
When it finally comes,
I can't get it printed,
Do you know the holes in Mary Branden's neck were airbrushed out before they printed the photographs?
If you keep going on like this, you're going to get fired again,
Let's see... how many times has it been?
Twice in Washington, three times in New York, twice in Chicago, and once... or was it twice? In Boston,
Oh,
I'm becoming extinct in my own lifetime,
Homo Newshawkus.
Natural habitat, a pool of sour mash bourbon,
You know, I really ought to light a candle to Ben Hecht,
Here,
You ought to quit your job, you know,
And you'll support me?
Well, I...
Come on, honey, I'm serious,
That weirdo's hit five girls, and they were all night workers,
Five?
Yeah, five,
A girl named Shelley Forbes is missing, and I'll bet my bottom dollar she's victim number five,
You know, you iron a shirt pretty good there,
I've been doing some thinking,
What do you know about vampires?
Only that they wear dinner suits and talk with marbles in their mouth,
Will you please be serious?
Watch my natural habitat there,
Open it,
"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Vampires.
But Were Afraid to Ask."
No, you're going to look at it,
Come on, Why?
- What if the killer's a real vampire?
- I've had a very long week,
He's done everything that's in this book,
You're going to read it,
Yes, all right,
I'm going to read it,
Oh, now, come on, you're a big, tough reporter,
You can take it, You might even get a good feature article out of it,
That's it,
"Since the beginning of man's existence,
"there have been creatures of the night,
"crazed monsters that track their bloody prints
"through the pages of fact and fiction,
"Of them all, the vampire seems to have accumulated the largest body of documentation,".
"By night, the vampire is virtually indestructible,
"fearing only the sign of the cross,
"Before daybreak, he must return to his coffin,
"otherwise he will be destroyed by the purifying rays of the sun,
"It is then, while he lies dormant,
"he can be destroyed by hammering a wooden stake through his heart,".
According to the legend, the victim of the vampire will ultimately rise again as the living dead, and must be destroyed in a similar manner.
From any source available, the vampire must have blood.
Help! Help!
Someone help!
He's in there,
I was doing double duty as night editor when the P.D. squawk box went crazy about a wild brawl at the Old Town Hospital.
Thursday, May 27th,
8: 20 A. M., and things were rolling.
Our morning edition hit the streets recapping all the action at the hospital.
The TV people, as usual, had missed out completely, and the radio stations were literally reading our copy on the air.
But now the whole lid was really blown off.
The maniac had been identified.
Sorry I'm late, I just got these out of the soup,
Now, here's a rundown on the Scotland Yard and the Interpol findings,
Subject... Janos Skorzeny,
Born in Craesti, Romania, 1899,
Now, wait just a minute,
You trying to tell me this guy is over 70 years old?
Come on, Bernie, your boys have come up with the wrong man,
Like hell we have!
These facts have been triple-checked and confirmed,
I've been up all night, and I'm pretty tired,
Do you want it or don't you?
Just take it easy,
Let's hear it,
All right,
Skorzeny's father died in 1923,
He left somewhere between
$75 and $100 million,
At this time he began to travel, and he became known throughout Eastern Europe as a big lover of nightlife,
We don't have a lot more on him before World War II,
Scotland Yard reports he showed up in England just in time for the German blitz,
I'm sure Mr. Kolchak will find the following facts of interest,
Such formality from a man who always guzzles my beer.
While in England, he passed himself off as Dr, Paul Belasco, specialist in hematology research,
His work involved freshly killed air raid victims from various
London emergency rooms,
As a matter of fact, at his residence in Shafto Court, he installed several kinds of sumps, tubs, and an extremely large commercial meat freezer,
In 1948, he turned up in Canada, still as Dr, Belasco,
Further checking made his presence known in almost every place along the US-Canadian border where rioting and violence and a number of dead bodies were found,
We believe he left Canada for Vegas April 19th under the name of
Detective Constable Alan Hensley,
Now, because of his British citizenship, he is an international fugitive, so my people are very interested in him,
This is no longer just a local matter,
Now, gentlemen, the one constant that has shown up in all of our reports is that Skorzeny's travels have always been accompanied by a number of unexplained killings, many of which have one thing in common...
A massive loss of blood,
So, if Skorzeny is not the vampire of Mr. Kolchak's theories, he is certainly the suspect of multiple homicides extending back some 30 years,
Mr. Jenks, you seem to be running this show,
Could I have a minute to say something?
- You have the floor,
- You keep it short,
I was at the hospital yesterday, and a lot of things were happening that you just simply cannot explain away,
Sheriff, your own men shot at him, some at point-blank range,
How come it didn't even slow him down?
How come a man over 70 years old can outrun a police car?
How come this same man, slugged in the head, doesn't even bleed?
I saw those gashes in his head, and whatever it was that was trickling from those wounds was clear. It was not blood!
This guy's got a motor mouth,
Can't we shut him up?
No, let him hang himself,
Then we'll finally be rid of him,
So far he has killed four, probably five women,
The coroner said that those bite marks on the throat were made by human teeth,
He practically confirmed the fact that he actually drank their blood,
Now, wait, Whatever this Skorzeny may be, he seems to be functioning as if he were a vampire,
You can go on operating as if he were an ordinary man,
That's up to you,
But I know that the only way you're going to get him is if you proceed under the assumption that he's a real-life vampire!
Now, the research that I've been able to find...
Wait a minute,
Have you lost your mind?
Can you imagine the total blind panic this town would be in if the public were told we were actually looking for a vampire?
Not to mention the irreparable damage it would do to the image of law enforcement in Vegas,
That's what it's all about, isn't it? That's it,
Boy, I really can't believe that you guys are so afraid of appearing stupid that you'll ignore the only possible way of nailing him!
You listen, and you listen good,
We'll handle this by ourselves, and without undue public observation,
No undue public observation?
You've blown it already!
Look what's appeared in my paper today,
People are going to be calling for a grand jury investigation,
You can't stop the rumors!
Sit down!
I don't care what's been printed in the newspapers,
This man is still classified as an ordinary maniac, and he'll be settled by standard police procedures,
And you'd better start cooperating with that fact, or you're going to get your pushy tushy kicked out of town,
You dig?
Yes, sir, I dig,
But just remember the next time you blow it who's got the answers... sir,
All right, Ed,
Let's get on with it,
What have you got?
Our two departments combined have 650 men on full-time duty,
All leaves are canceled, and everyone's working a 16-hour day,
Our chopper is going from dusk to dawn,
We've got unmarked cars patrolling the Casino Center and the Strip,
All roads are blocked, and we're receiving complete cooperation from the Highway Patrol and the Jeep Posse,
- You got it?
- Got it,
Repeat,
What did I say?
Show every real estate agent in town the picture of this guy's puss, and ask 'em if they sold a house to anybody that looks like him,
Good boy, You got it,
Now get going,
Now, wait a minute,
Wait till I lose this last dollar,
Mickey, has the idea of winning ever occurred to you?
Winning?
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
You spoke,
You know, I have a very strange, unhappy feeling that the police are never going to catch this murderer,
I also have another very unhappy feeling,
Which is?
This case may be even bigger than I thought it was,
Bigger?
Stranger, then,
I've seen a lot of weird things in my life, love,
I have never, ever seen anything like this,
You don't tell me that you're finally going to believe...
I don't even want to think about it,
Car 14, check out the report on the two ladies downtown on Casino Drive.
Code 10-33, code 10-33.
All units, all units.
Janos Skorzeny spotted in 1969 green, unpaneled station wagon, intersection Oakey and Houssels.
I.D. confirmed.
Positive visual contact made.
Units 7 and 8, seal off
Rexford and Houssels at Oakey.
Repeat, Units 7 and 8.
Unit 3, close off Park Paseo at Las Vegas Boulevard.
Units 4, 6, move north to face
Unit 3 at Park Paseo and 5th.
Unit 5, move up Bracken to 5th Place.
All units...
Hold it!
Get up, slowly,
Somebody find a light switch!
He's holding Chambers down!
Friday, May 28th, 3: 17 A. m.
Despite the helicopters, the Highway Patrol, the Jeep Posse, despite the blocking of every major road and highway, despite the mass coverage of Las Vegas by every available man in both police and sheriff departments,
Janos Skorzeny was still at large.
The courthouse conference room had been a scene of chaos for more than three hours now.
Messages were still flooding in from every outside unit.
Every available man who had taken place in the capture attempt was being debriefed.
At the hospital, two officers had died and a third was hovering on the edge.
Reports on them were still coming in as the greatest manhunt in the history of Las Vegas continued in vain.
Oh, thanks, Bernie, Yeah,
Well, what are we gonna do?
Now are you willing to listen to my insane ideas?
Get out of here!
Hold it, hold it,
You were there, weren't you?
Yes,
Every man we've questioned insists not only that Skorzeny was possessed of incredible strength, but that he was shot more than once during the capture attempt,
I'd say 30, 40 times,
I'm sorry, I'm not buying that,
Captain, you have two choices,
Either he was shot, or your entire police department is blind,
Ed, let's admit it,
We had the man, had him cornered, and we couldn't hold him,
Let Kolchak have his say,
Before I do, is it agreed that in return for my help you will grant me the exclusive rights to the entire story?
Let's say it's agreeable if we decide to follow your suggestions regarding the suspect,
Fine, because if you don't follow my suggestions, you're going to be chasing your suspect till doomsday!
Just get on with it,
Of course,
Each man in the field is to be issued one of these... to be carried in his pocket,
- This, gentlemen...
- Where'd you get that?
I have a friend who's got a furniture repair store,
I woke him up and had him make it,
Each man in the field is to be issued one of these and one of these,
Are you suggesting that we pound one of these into Skorzeny's chest?
No, into his heart,
There's a legal phrase for that,
You might have run into it once or twice in your broad experience,
It's called premeditated murder,
It's the only way you're going to stop him,
You heard your own men,
Can they all be wrong?
You can stop your nighttime chases from now on, too, gentlemen,
The only hope you have is to spot Skorzeny and then track him back to where he lives and wait until sunrise before finishing him off,
He's only vulnerable during the day,
At night he's much too strong,
Yes, gentlemen,
I hate to say this... but it looks as if we have a real, live vampire on our hands,
- Ed,
- Yes, sir,
- Warren,
- Yeah,
Tom, I'd like to be in on this, too,
Okay, you've got yourself a deal,
- Conditional,
- What's that?
Butcher here will issue the crosses, the mallets, the stakes,
The one thing he won't do is depart from established police procedures,
If feasible, Skorzeny is to be taken alive and held for trial,
Trial?!
That's right, trial, Trial,
All right, In return for what?
You'll get the exclusive rights to the story... when the blackout is lifted,
Any other conditions?
- One more,
- What's that?
If it turns out you're wrong, you're to be out of town in 12 hours,
Take it or leave it,
All right, I'll take it,
Because I know I'm right,
And you know I'm right,
Right,
Ciao.
I'll take Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island, too,
Watch out, you great big wonderful Big Apple,
Kolchak's coming back,
Yeah!
Kolchak! It's me, Crawford!
What are you doing driving off with me in the backseat?
What are you doing in my backseat?
I wanted to talk to you,
I saw your car parked here, so I got in to wait for you and I got sleepy,
You got sleepy!
Hey!
I think I found the house,
I told Crawford to give me 30 minutes before telling Jenks where I was.
That way I could get to see the house alone for a while, and also keep the police from arriving before dawn, which I knew they'd do if they got the chance, no matter what I told them.
Shelley Forbes?
I'll get us out,
His own private blood bank. Wow.
Hold still, It won't stick,
You think they'll print it?
I know they will,
We've got an agreement,
You look kind of tired,
You want me to drive you to the office?
Go on, hush-a-bye, will ya?
I want to finish this in time for the special edition,
Why don't you stop working nights...
Oh, Carl, not that again, and marry me?
What?
Well, you're a good cooker and a good kisser,
Why not?
Oh, baby, you're gonna love
New York City,
Honey, after this story hits the news services with my byline...
- Us, married?
- Yes! Us, married!
Don't look now, baby, but Kolchak's coming back, in style!
There you are, Vincenzo, and if I do say so myself, it's sensational,
I'm sure it is, Carl,
You're going to put it in the special edition? With pictures?
And the news services?
Okay, fine,
What's got into you?
You sick or something?
Nothing,
This is all fine, Carl, fine,
Jenks has been trying to reach you,
Yeah? What'd he want?
He wants to see you at the D.A.'s office,
Why don't you run over there now?
Yeah,
You're one hell of a reporter,
Thank you, sir,
And a bright
"good morning" to all of you,
Bernie, what did you...?
Is your name Carl Kolchak, and do you reside in the city of Las Vegas?
You know my name's Carl Kolchak,
What's going on?
You're under arrest on the charge of murder,
The state requires that you be informed that you have the right to remain silent,
No, Oh, no,
No chance, You're not going to pull that one on me,
You are under arrest,
All right, Paine, just what kind of a dirty deal is this?
You have a very short memory,
A few hours ago,
Sheriff Butcher himself saw you actually pound a wooden stake through a man's heart with this mallet,
A man wanted for questioning... questioning, mind you,
He hadn't been arrested,
He hadn't even been charged,
You broke up our stakeout, and after we were kind enough to invite you to go along,
You just charged in there in front of us and killed Janos Skorzeny before we had a chance to do anything,
Why, you were even ranting and raving about this Skorzeny being some kind of a vampire, and you had to save the world,
And that, Mr. Kolchak, is murder one,
If you plead insanity, you might get lucky, but I promise you this, you'll be committed to an asylum for the rest of your life,
I pull your fat out of the fire, and you do this,
Will you just sit down a minute and listen to them?
You were there!
Just listen,
Now, this is your story, Kolchak,
It's already being printed,
"This morning shortly before sunrise,
"Las Vegas Sheriff's deputies
"under the command of Sheriff Warren A, Butcher, 45,
"surrounded the home of Janos Skorzeny,
"a fugitive from a federal warrant, and, in a pitched gun battle, were forced to kill him,".
Never, You'll never get away with it,
- What's to stop me...?
- You're going to stop yourself,
Because if you open your mouth, we'll find you, bring you back, use this warrant, and put you away forever,
Pick 'em up, Kolchak,
Pick 'em up and get out of town, Now,
We'll take care of your back rent,
I want to call Gail,
She's not there, Carl,
What have you done with her?
Nothing,
We just asked the young lady if she'd be good enough to leave town,
She's an undesirable element,
Kolchak, and we don't want undesirable elements in Las Vegas,
There's nothing I can do,
You let me know where you end up, huh?
Yeah, sure, I'll keep in touch,
So all the loose ends have been gathered together and tied into a pretty knot, right around the neck of guess who.
After I left town, I began putting notices in the personal columns of newspapers from San Francisco to St. Louis.
Until I ran out of money, that is.
So far, I've received no answers, but I'll keep trying even though I don't think
I'll ever find Gail Foster again.
Maybe it's just as well.
So that's it.
The book's finished.
And now you'll have to judge for yourself.
I must warn you, however, if you try to verify this account, you will find it quite impossible.
Item... in Washington, D. C., there is no longer a file listing the suspect under his true name or any of his alleged aliases.
Item... in Las Vegas, all of those who were involved have either left town, aren't talking, or are dead.
I haven't had a decent night's sleep since all this happened, and now you might find it difficult, too, because there is still one fact that cannot be buried.
After the death of Janos Skorzeny, he and all of his victims were immediately cremated.
Why?
Remember the legend?
All those who die from the bite of the vampire will return as a vampire unless destroyed first.
So think about it, and try to tell yourself, wherever you may be, in the quiet of your home, in the safety of your bed, try to tell yourself,
"It couldn't happen here."
Esther. Jane-Marie.
Up and dressed.
Come on out now, ladies.
- Train ain't due for a damn week.
- Where's Esther?
She's busy. She's got an all-nighter.
Myrtle.
All right, fall in.
Dress up, Madigan. Dress up.
Murphy, dress 'em up. Come along.
- How long you gonna be?
- 20 minutes, half an hour.
Howdy do, ma'am?
You could have a lot of fun out of me, darlin', if you tried.
One thing about me, darlin',
I won't go to hell for not tryin'.
Message from Fort Humboldt for the governor.
I'll take it.
It's an army transport train.
No civilians on board.
Well, this is an odd place to settle.
OK, you heard him, gentlemen. Line it up.
- Major Claremont.
- Sergeant, get me Captain Oakland.
Fall out the troops for exercise, but keep them out of those tents.
Yes, sir.
Now you listen to me.
You will remain hard by this train.
You ever see an Indian washing?
They're dirty, and they're ignorant.
Major Claremont.
- How long will this take?
- As long as necessary, Governor.
This train runs on steam.
That requires water.
Let's get it done as quickly as possible.
Of course.
All right, fall in.
There will be no skylarking...
Bellew said you want to see me.
Get your cipher book.
See what you can make of this.
- It's for the governor.
- It's from the fort.
Maybe it'll tell us what's going on.
Pissant politicians running an army train.
Yes, sir.
Havin' any problems?
No. We're just making sure we're not gonna have any, Lieutenant.
- Newell, come with me a minute.
- For what, Captain?
Major gave me a message from the fort to be deciphered.
Looks like you've got room for one more.
No civilians, except by special permission from Washington.
I'm a deputy US marshal.
Indian agent for the territory.
The governor can tell ya.
My orders are to accept no unauthorised persons on this train.
Dr Molyneux and the Reverend
Peabody are posted to Fort Humboldt.
The young lady is a daughter of the commandant at the fort.
Why do you want to go to Humboldt?
Levi Calhoun. He's in custody up there. I wanna bring him back.
- If ever a man deserved to hang...
- And hang he will.
The sooner I can get up there, the sooner he takes the drop.
We can have him sent to you under armed escort.
You said that ain't army business.
That way or no way.
Good day, Marshal.
Major Claremont.
Locomotive's ready, sir.
- Very well, Sergeant. Carry on.
- Major.
I can't find Lieutenant
Newell or Captain Oakland.
Corporal said Humboldt's only two days up the line.
Something funny's goin' on.
Get the hell off here, son.
Wonder why we ain't movin' yet.
You sign up yesterday? Hurry up and wait. Hurry up and wait.
Right, I need eight volunteers right now.
You, you, you two. You.
You, Murphy. You too, Rafferty.
Here's what I want you to do.
Go up and scour this town.
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell are missin'. See if you can find 'em.
Murphy and I will take the small tent.
Have you found them?
- Not yet.
- Next time bring a nursemaid.
- The train cannot be held any longer.
- You expect me to leave my officers?
I'm very sorry. You know the urgency of our mission.
Just a goddamn minute.
Just once too often, friend.
Put the gun away, friend.
What's your problem?
Slippery Fingers here took $120 off of me.
- Maybe he's a good poker player.
- Too good to be true.
Looks like a pretty fair hand to me.
What's your name?
John Deakin.
Stand up.
I said stand up.
- No gun?
- I'm not a man of violence.
What's known as playing it close to the chest.
That's not good enough, Marshal. Outside.
I'm not a man of violence.
- That's enough.
- Not for me it's not.
Marshal, look at this.
"Wanted for theft, gambling debts, arson and murder."
"John Murray, alias John
Deakin, alias Hayes."
"Former lecturer at the
University of Iowa."
A lecturer in what, Mr Deakin?
- Medicine.
- You don't expect us to believe that?
Here. Listen to this.
"Convicted of embezzlement."
"Trapped in Lake's Crossing, where he escaped under cover of a fire that he set."
The whole town burned down.
Seven people killed.
Seven people. My God,
Richard, that's awful.
He blew up a wagonload of explosives in Sharps.
It's still not army business.
Those explosives was on the way to the presidio in San Francisco.
That makes it army business.
I'm pretty sure Mr Deakin here's gonna be my ticket to Humboldt.
So the governor here got hold of some of his friends in Washington, had me appointed Indian agent for the territory.
More ways to pacify Indians than shooting holes in 'em.
But you did that, too.
In the line of duty, of course.
Even back in Ohio, we knew about Nathan Pearce.
- Notorious, was I?
- No. Famous is more like it.
"Famous" is a better word, Marshal.
I must admire your spunk, young lady.
It's not an easy life out here.
How come you're making this trip if no civilians are supposed to be aboard?
I have friends in high places.
Miss Scoville's joining her father, at his urgent request.
Gentlemen, I have a hard day tomorrow.
At my age, sleep is a necessity.
- "A hard day tomorrow"?
- I have to check the medical supplies.
We're cut off from the world now.
May I please just know what in the hell is going on?
Governor, these are all intelligent people.
I think they have a right to know.
Dr Molyneux here is a specialist.
Your troops are not merely relief. They're replacements for soldiers who've died.
- Died?
- God save us. The Indians.
Not Indians. Fort Humboldt is in the grip of a diphtheria epidemic.
Oh, Richard. My father.
We're in daily contact with the fort,
Marica, and your father's fine.
Why wasn't I told?
Because we might have lost the rest of your command, not only two officers.
- They must have found out.
- Governor, how dare you expose a lady,
- all of us, to this dreadful pestilence?
- We have provisions for a month.
We'll remain aboard until Dr
Molyneux pronounces Humboldt clean.
He's got as good a chance as any of catching the diphtheria.
I've already had the disease. I'm immune.
- Where'd you catch it?
- In Mexico. Why?
Just curious.
How many troops are available for duty?
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor.
25 out of a garrison of 76.
The others are too sick for duty, or dead.
- White Hand must like that.
- White Hand?
Paiute chief. He needs watchin'.
25 men. That's not even enough for patrols.
If you'll excuse me.
Marica. Are you all right?
Yes, of course.
It's been a long day.
Are you going to leave him like this all night?
I reckon we could turn him loose in the morning.
By then we'll be in snow country, and he'll have no place to go.
You sure got a mighty poor choice for your pity, ma'am.
Then you make a mighty poor example of a lawman, Mr Pearce.
A man is innocent until proved guilty.
But you've tried, convicted and condemned.
Show me the law that says you can treat a man like a wild animal.
You frightened me.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
Aren't you afraid of someone seeing you?
I'm afraid we're not much of a secret any more.
You should have told me about the epidemic at the fort.
Why?
You'd only have worried.
Or are you afraid I might have deserted, too?
No, I'd never think that.
Let's wait until we get off the train.
Can I get you something?
There's some food left.
No, thanks.
A drink?
That I'll have.
Would you untie my legs?
Don't be silly.
- I won't go anywhere, I promise.
- I'm sure you won't.
I'm all cramped up and I need the circulation.
I give you my word.
I'll only untie your legs.
And if you want to hop off the train, it's a long hop to anywhere.
There. Better?
Give me a hand up?
Oh, my God.
You promised.
When a man is a killer, arsonist, a cheat and a coward, it's hardly surprising if he turns out to be a liar as well.
- Is your mother still alive?
- Yes. But what's that to do with you?
- But she's not well.
- How do you know that?
If she were, the commander of the fort would be visited by his wife, and not his daughter.
It's strange, you coming out here with diphtheria around, and the Indians on the prod.
It must have been an urgent invitation that brought you.
But not by letter. Your invitation came by telegraph, right?
- You gonna marry the governor?
- Really. This is quite intolerable.
Before you leave, tie my hands again.
Not so tightly.
Why all this concern and interest in me?
I should have thought you,
Mr Deakin, had enough worries.
I have.
Thank you.
Have Ferguson ready with his telegraph equipment when we stop at 7.00.
- And get Mr O'Brien.
- Yes, sir.
- Why are we stopping?
- Morning, Governor.
My orders are to contact the fort daily at this hour.
I hope you have no objection.
Make it short, please, Major.
Time's important.
Fall out, everybody. Everybody out.
Nice fresh air out here, men.
Everybody outside.
Come on, get it out of there, Bennett.
Guard mounts for everybody. Murphy, you post guards on the other side.
And you, you, you and you, up on the top. Keep your eyes open.
White Hand's around here somewhere, men, waiting to pounce on you little boys.
So stay awake, stay alert, and keep your iron unbuckled.
I'll be right back.
I've gotten through to them, Major, and they've acknowledged.
My regards to Colonel Scoville, and congratulations on the capture of Levi Calhoun.
That's the train, Calhoun.
What do I tell 'em?
How do I know you won't pull no fancy tricks?
I swear I never would.
I don't believe you, soldier.
My God.
The fort's answering, sir.
As God is my witness, Calhoun,
I'll see you before a firing squad.
Don't you give me no trouble, Colonel.
I got your bluebellies locked up.
By God, I'll skin 'em alive, one by each.
Major Claremont.
The epidemic's worsened.
- Is there news of my father?
- It has his signature, so he must be fine.
They're asking about our time of arrival, sir.
With this weather, I guess we'll be at Breakheart Pass in about 20 hours.
Transmit that. Add my compliments to Colonel Scoville.
Then get Myrtle City. Request word on
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell.
Yes, sir.
- I can't get Myrtle City, Major.
- Keep trying.
- Dead, sir.
- I don't understand how it could've gone.
Weather's been good.
It worked yesterday.
- Sergeant Bellew, board the troops.
- Yes, sir.
Troopers, fall in. Board the train.
Murphy, get 'em aboard.
You be sure you take a roll call.
I don't wanna leave anybody behind.
- Seen Dr Molyneux this morning?
- No, not yet.
- Shall I send for him, Governor?
- No, it isn't necessary.
Dr Molyneux had better adjust to army schedules. We don't run a restaurant.
Dr Molyneux.
The governor asked for you, sir.
It looks like some sort of seizure.
Apoplexy, I'd say.
You mind if I have a look?
- What the devil for?
- I do know something about medicine.
Why not, Major?
All right.
- The skin's broken above the left ear.
- Of course. He fell.
- Died before a bruise could form.
- Apoplexy kills instantly.
No, a seizure like that would turn the lips and the fingers blue.
It's lucky we have the law aboard.
Now, what does that mean?
There's a puncture. Right there.
Just below the ribs.
Looks like somebody knocked him out, stuck a surgical probe up under his ribs.
God save us.
- It's hard to believe.
- The fact is, we have a killer aboard.
Yes, we have.
Move it along, men. Murphy, keep an eye on that detail.
I'll check the drivers.
Sergeant, as soon as the engineer is finished, put the men back on the train.
- We've got to move along.
- Yes, sir.
Madigan, you and Bennett over here, keep a sharp lookout.
Keep them logs moving, men.
Think how lucky you are. You're warm.
On the double. We don't have all day. Get that wood up there.
It's colder than hell out here.
- Where's Deakin?
- Inside. Don't worry yourself.
At least he's got good sense.
Men on top, all aboard.
Back to your cars.
Dr Molyneux is dead. Two of the major's best officers are missing.
And we can't get through to Myrtle. Do you mind?
Go ahead.
Nobody heard anything.
Nobody saw anything.
And nobody knows anything.
It can only get better.
Well, you know, maybe they were accidents after all.
We might have seen the end of it.
Have you gone crazy?
He fell. My fireman fell.
He's dead.
You can't be sure.
Somebody better check on him.
Somebody that knows somethin' about doctoring.
He might try to run off on us.
Looks like every bone in his body is busted.
Move out, men.
Can we make up the lost time?
Men are dying in that fort.
- Sergeant Bellew, board the troops.
- Yes, sir. Troopers, fall in.
Do you mind if I have a look up there in that locomotive?
If it's all right with the marshal, it's all right with me.
Go ahead.
Whiskey. He was reeking with it.
God is my witness, I never saw
Jackson touch that stuff.
Trooper Rafferty reporting, sir.
I'm your new fireman.
Hop up, young fella.
Morning, sir.
Good morning. You must be Carlos the chef.
I am. And you must be
Mr Deakin, the murderer.
How about some coffee? It's hot.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Marshal Pearce.
You're all mighty relaxed in the face of what's transpired aboard this train.
- What?
- If Deakin's right, Molyneux was killed.
The telegraph line to
Myrtle no longer works.
It could be ice or animals, even wind.
I think this bears investigation, more than you're giving it.
Some little time ago I had a choice, Colonel.
Major.
Keep your nose clean and you'll get there.
What about it?
Never had no call to be a detective.
We're gonna all be on this train for a while.
We just might find out what happened before we have to get off.
Could be you did it all.
Could be.
Or you.
Oh, hell, we're stopping again.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
- We're going backwards.
- Oh, my God.
- He's right. We're not stopping.
- I know.
What's going on?
Quickly. Get in your bunks.
Down there.
- Move. Get in those bunks and stay there.
- Sarge, I'm scared. What's going on?
Lay down, and stay there.
Get back in your bunks.
All of you, get back in your bunks.
It'll be all right. Stay in your bunks.
Troopers, calm down. Don't panic.
- God. It's locked from the outside.
- What the hell is going on here?
Where's that brakeman?
Where's that brakeman? Open it.
It's broken. The metal must have crystallised.
- I don't know why the brakes didn't hold.
- Sounded like a gunshot to me.
Thank God we didn't lose the medical supplies.
- Not much good without a doctor.
- You're a doctor. Least, so you said.
- Not any more I'm not.
- Simple charity to your fellow man.
My fellow man is about to hang me.
Major, we must try for more replacements.
Major, you have to contact the fort.
The telegraph set's in the front of the supply wagon.
Henry, telegraph set in the supply wagon.
Sooner or later, me and sonny boy are gonna need some sleep.
There's nothing you can do about that. They're dead.
So am I. Or as good as.
It wasn't your fault. You were back there with us. Nothing you could have done.
It ain't there, sir.
- What?
- The spare telegraph set. It's gone.
Mighty glad to see you, White Hand.
You made good time.
The train?
It's comin'.
- Soldiers?
- No word yet.
Me, too, sonny boy.
Me, too.
All right. Six hours, no more.
Take a compartment in the next car.
Who's gonna watch the steam?
I think we have someone who can take care of that.
Feed in the fuel to keep the needle between 100 and 130.
You got any questions?
Use the wood pile on the left.
The other's no good. It's wet.
- He says they didn't wreck the troop cars.
- Son of a bitch.
He ain't done yet, Jebbo.
Hawkins, ask him what time he gets to Breakheart Pass.
Then tell him to stop the train when he gets there.
We'll have to get rid of those soldiers.
White Hand's gonna have to work a mite harder than he figured.
It's about time. It's almost morning.
I'm hungry.
Pressure's right up there.
Go back and go to bed. You can sleep the rest of the way.
Mind if I help myself?
Of course not, Major.
What is it, Henry?
I can't find the reverend.
He can't be far. Only ten minutes ago he was trying to save my soul.
Could he have fallen off?
- We could back up and look for him.
- Where's O'Brien? We'll back up.
- No.
- My God, Richard.
- Why not?
- Someone is trying to stop this train.
- I will not allow that to happen.
- I can't believe you won't stop to look.
Marica, darling, there are men dying at that fort who desperately need our help.
It's my responsibility to get us there.
If the reverend was stupid or unlucky enough to have fallen off, I'm sorry.
- We're going through.
- Governor.
You are one superior son of a bitch.
We'll search what's left of this train.
Who are you?
John Deakin.
What are you?
He must have fallen off. If we back up maybe five miles...
He certainly wouldn't have jumped off.
Reverend Peabody was small. A big, strong man could have thrown him off.
Me, I have an alibi. Miss Scoville obviously is not a strong man.
But the rest of you are big, strong men.
What the hell are you talking about?
You're pretty free with your theories.
And my whiskey.
A damn sight better than that whiskey back in Myrtle.
Marshal. There's no need for that.
Mr Deakin is not a man of violence.
He told us what he's not, but not what he is.
Carlos?
Are you in there?
They're all gone.
Carlos is gone, Deakin's gone.
The place is a goddamn mess.
What are you talking about?
Talk sense, man.
The ammunition boxes are open.
The coffins are open. They're gone.
You're drunk.
Drunk? I wish to hell I was drunk.
Don't. You'll die if you do.
No, not me. Your friends out there.
I'm gonna take my hand away.
Don't scream. You promise?
You damn fool. You'll get us both killed.
There's no help for you out there.
Especially not from your friend the governor.
Don't scream.
I want you to hide me.
Why should I?
To save both our lives.
I asked you this once before, and you didn't tell me.
You'd better tell me now.
Who are you?
My name is John Deakin.
That's my real name.
- I work for the US Secret Service.
- I don't believe you.
Do you believe I'm a killer?
You've got about a minute to make up your mind.
- Who is it?
- O'Brien, ma'am.
Come in. The door's not locked.
- What is it?
- The prisoner, Deakin. He's escaped.
Where could a man escape to in this wilderness?
That's the point, there is no place.
That's why we think he's still on the train.
- And you think perhaps I had...?
- No.
Just that he could have sneaked in when you were asleep.
I can assure you he isn't hiding under my bed.
Please excuse me.
Tight squeeze.
I'm a damn fool. Now please get out.
I want you to do one more thing for me.
Go along and bring back the major.
Nobody else. Just the major.
Don't even talk to anybody.
- But Governor Fairchild...
- Especially not Governor Fairchild.
Get on, now.
- What in God's name?
- Put it away.
- You'll use it later.
- I don't believe a word of it.
What if I showed you 400 Winchester rifles that were stolen from the factory?
We've been tracking them halfway across the country.
They're on the train now, in the supply car.
All those men killed.
The train half wrecked.
- All that over stolen rifles?
- There's more to it than that.
And the governor? Surely he'd have nothing to do with it.
I intend to see that Governor
Fairchild stands trial for murder.
Major Claremont.
Deakin must have got to him.
Where in God's name can they be?
In the supply wagon.
We've looked everywhere else.
Find 'em and kill 'em. Both.
I'm sorry.
- I want to see those rifles.
- You will.
Miss Scoville, stay in the compartment, and keep your door looked after we leave.
Understand?
All right, stolen rifles.
Not worth all that killing.
Dr Molyneux... there was no reason.
If you remember, Molyneux said he was going to inspect the medical supplies.
Rifles, dynamite, ammunition... not much a doctor would be interested in.
My God. The diphtheria, those men at the fort.
There is no diphtheria.
Reverend Peabody didn't go into the supplies.
I don't think he went to church, either.
Mr Peabody was a secret service operative for 15 years, the last five of them with me.
Don't touch that gun.
Hey, point that thing the other way.
I'm just a working stiff.
The major's just in back.
Bring him over here.
Get down.
- Where's your gun?
- I don't have a gun. I'm just the engineer.
- No.
- Jump.
- Where's the gun?
- It's in the box.
Underneath the seat.
I don't know who you are, but the law says...
The law's who I am.
Have a look behind that wood.
They got onto something back there in Myrtle, and died for it.
Then when Jackson the fireman spotted the bodies,
Banlon threw him off the train.
Are you gonna listen to this murderer?
I looked at Jackson at the bottom of the trestle... a head wound with a lot of blood.
A dead man doesn't bleed.
You probably hit him with a wrench before you threw him off.
Before God, Major, I don't know what he's talking about.
Major, sir, what do I do?
Keep your gun on Banlon.
If he moves, kill him.
We'll have to crawl forward on the roof and shoot him out.
What for? He's driving us right where we wanna go.
Let's agree that Deakin is no idiot.
Why is he taking us there?
Let's get 'er done.
My job was to arrange a train. I'm no gunman.
That's true, O'Brien.
But a noose would fit your neck just as neatly as it would fit ours.
Hey, sonny boy.
Give me the wrench there.
The nut on the brake handle's loose.
Give me the wrench.
You know how to run this thing?
I think so.
You suspected everybody else.
Why not me?
Marshal Pearce was our number one suspect.
You didn't want him on the train.
That put you in the clear.
What's ahead of us at the fort?
What's wrong there?
Calhoun's not in custody.
He's probably with White Hand, and they're in control of the fort.
My God, what for?
Humboldt's a shipping point for all gold and silver from California and Nevada.
That's why everybody's involved, except the girl.
The Indians want the rifles and ammunition back there.
I figure they were gonna put the gold and silver in the coffins and ship it back.
There's a gun lined up on you gents. Now stop the train.
- You hurt?
- Only my dignity.
Breakheart Pass coming up.
Where are the soldiers?
Where are they, Deakin?
- Here they come.
- Look.
Hang on.
That son of a bitch.
Why'd he stop now?
This is where we get off.
- You know anything about dynamite?
- Of course.
Set this to blow the rails, but don't light the fuse until I get back.
Why the hell are they shooting?
Tell an Indian things'll be one way and they're not, he'll think you crossed him.
- They know you, Marshal. Show yourself.
- Like hell.
- You son of a bitch. What's going on?
- A man's aboard. He's got the engine.
You dumb pilgrims.
Ain't nobody in that engine.
Get the troopers at the fort, but watch out for Calhoun.
- When these blow, he'll ride out here.
- Right.
If we get the pressure back up, I can take her on in. Let's stoke her up.
That's the train. Let's ride.
Tell the Indians to form a work party and replace that track with one from behind.
Take the claw, put it in like this, and pull down.
Over here. Put it here, like that, and pull it down.
All right, take it away.
Where's Fairchild?
The Palace car.
Fairchild.
Maybe you know what's going on around here.
No.
Keep 'em working, O'Brien.
Let me go.
Help.
Help.
Let her go.
The hell I will.
Fairchild.
I reckon we've come down to it, Deakin.
You have a choice.
You could throw that gun down.
I don't think I can do that.
Are you all right?
Your father's waiting for you out there.
The only two fighters to win three different titles were...
...Ruby Bob Fitzsimmons and Henry Armstrong. ln baseball, who holds the record for the most stolen bases?
Maury Wills holds the modern record, but the overall record...
...is held by Harry Stovey of Philadelphia. ln 1888 the man stole 156 bases.
All right, in football...
...what were the names of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame?
Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller,
Elmer Layden and Sleepy Jim Crowley.
The only two fighters....
Heavy's Pool Hall, Heavy speaking.
-Springy?
-Yeah?
-You seen McCoy today?
-No, he ain't been in yet, Heav.
Robert Mitera holds the record for the longest hole in one.
Try the shamus at home.
Yeah?
What is your address?
Where the hell is that?
Westchester?
Are you sure you got the right McCoy?
All right, you pay for the car rental, right?
All right, 6:30.
Oh, 'morning.
Hi.
You want some coffee with cream and sugar?
Do you have any saccharine? l don't have any cream and sugar.
-You know what?
-What?
Well, l never slept on a pool table before. l told you to put your feet in the side pockets. lt keeps them warm, you know. ls that what you meant?
You know, and l kept on thinking you were some kind of foot freak....
Listen....
-Alice.
-Alice, yeah. lf a cat comes around here, you let him in.
All right, honey?
What kind of cat?
Just a cat, you know. Like a little cat. l hate cats.
Well, how could you stand them?
He just stands me. You understand? l don't stand him, he stands me.
Give him something to eat, all right?
All right, yeah. l will.
Where is the fire?
-You know what? You're terrific.
-What?
Yeah. Well, you're not so bad yourself.
You be out of here by 12:00.
-All right.
-See ya.
Get down!
Stay, Lancer! lt's okay now. You can come out, Mr. McCoy.
-l'll just stay in the car.
-But Mr. Hume is expecting you inside.
As long as Rin Tin Tin's around, l'll stay in the car.
Suppose l take him down to the kennel?
Good thinking.
Heel.
-Mr. McCoy?
-Yeah.
Please come in. Mr. Hume is expecting you.
This way, please.
Come in.
Thank you for coming, Mr. McCoy.
Are you a dog lover, Mr. McCoy?
When l see dogs like that, l get very emotional.
-Emotional?
-Yeah.
They scare the shit out of me.
Marvelous.
Tait, take Samson back to the kennels.
Come, Samson.
Come, Samson.
Come in, Mr. McCoy. Have a seat.
Can l offer you something?
A cold drink? lced tea?
No, thank you.
Very well. To business then.
Mr. McCoy, what do you know about me?
You know, l was thinking about that on the way out here.
''E.J. Hume, now what the hell could he want with me?''
Maybe advice on his diamond mines or his oil wells.
You have a delicious sense of humor.
What can l do to help you?
Very good. l like that.
Last Sunday, burglars broke into the Lanvan Jewelry Company.
Took millions in cut and uncut diamonds from a supposedly impregnable safe.
Very professional job.
The police had just about established that Victor Pappas...
...a well-known man in his field, was the key man in the burglary...
...when he turned up dead.
Heard of him?
-Yeah, the guy was burned, right?
-Right.
Now, l want to find out who killed him and why.
And l want to know fast.
Why? l'm the Lanvan Jewelry Company.
Those diamonds are mine.
Tried the police?
My people are in touch with them. l doubt if it'll do any good.
They must have been insured.
Those diamonds belong to me. l want them back.
Find Pappas' killer and you'll find the diamonds.
Are you sure you wouldn't like some iced tea?
No, thank you.
Why me? There are a lot of other very high-class detectives around.
Why would you pick me?
You were not the first idea that came to mind.
The second?
The fifty-third.
The next time, lie.
Two reasons:
One, Pappas was a Brooklyn boy, and you're a Brooklyn detective.
Two, the price is right.
You can use the cash, and l like to work with people who need my money. lt gives me a trump card.
You think you can buy me? l'll give you $10,000 to come up with the killer or the diamonds.
$5,000 now, $5,000 more on delivery.
You just bought me. l want a report every day, understood?
Understood.
Any questions?
No questions. l'm relying on you, McCoy.
You'll be seeing me.
-Now l understand why you wear that jacket.
-ln winter we wear overcoats.
You can hang beef up in that joint.
-l've seen the horse run before.
-l don't need your suggestion.
You've got a diseased mind.
You wouldn't know a winner if you fell over one.
-You don't know a winner.
-Will you look at it. He's due to pop.
-Will you stop? Look.
-No. You are the worst.
Don't do that.
Split and take yesterday's suggestions with you, you creep. l don't need a partner in a pool hall.
-Who is this from?
-Mama.
She wants to know what night you're coming to dinner.
-ls Vinnie here?
-Upstairs. Where else?
Tell your mama l love her.
-McCoy, what do you say?
-No, Sal. l got a hangover. ln 1952, ''English'' Sammy Marxon scored 200 consecutive bull's eyes...
...throwing a 10-inch butcher knife at 50 yards, left-handed.
The record stands.
-Kid's got a nice stroke.
-Yeah. He could be a good one. ln 1924, ''Tight Pockets'' Maxie Braunschweiger ran 124 straight in one pocket.
Good old Max, the German. l'm glad you talked to him-- l want you to check up on a man named Vic Pappas.
Big Vic Pappas? Pappas worked on the docks.
-No, l want to know who hit him.
-lf l knew who hit him--
Also a man named E.J. Humes.
Did you ever hear of him?
-E.J. Hume, credited to be one of--
-Not the usual crap.
E.J. Hume, in 1942, made.... Not the usual crap. l can handle that. l'll see you later.
Come on with that damn thing, it's not a church.
-My mother's....
-Yeah, yeah. l have statistics that prove that 90 percent of guinea cops are lousy crap shooters.
Who the....
Please, stop. l got the worst hangover.
-lf you were married--
-lf l was married, l'd be home with my wife in bed.
Well, up yours.
What's happening with the Pappas case?
Who wants to know?
-l have a client.
-You got a client? l got a client, yes.
-Who?
-Who what?
Who what? Who's the client?
-lt's none of your business who my client is.
-Well, then read about it in the papers.
Vinnie...
...come on, you help me, you help my client.
Give me some information.
We don't know a damn thing.
-Nothing?
-Honestly. l can't get over you going legit. l'd be better off shooting pool full time. l'd make more money. l know a couple of hustlers down there who wouldn't mind that either.
Take care.
The way you deal....
-Hi, Mac.
-Sit down, Mac. You got a buck?
-l got a buck.
-For a buck, l'll let you in.
Cheapie game.
That's only the beginning.
You didn't tell him the rest.
Some of the details, we got some surprises for you.
-Do you feel lucky?
-l always feel lucky.
The cards are hot.
You guys hear anything on the Pappas burning?
Make it $25.
What is the proposition, McCoy?
Big shot. l bet it all.
Mac, how much money are we talking about?
-We're talking about $100.
-That's not enough. At least a deuce.
All right, Rock, a deuce. Make it good, go.
The broad with Pappas, her old man's pushing for Big Macio.
Shooting Galleries, 34 South Street, apartment two, down by the docks.
-Name is Johnnie Brosten.
-Johnnie Brosten.
-Yep.
-Well, is that it?
-That's it.
-What about Pappas?
Nothing.
-ls that all l get for a deuce? Come on.
-Nothing. No talk.
Somebody big has put the lid on tight.
All right, Rock.
McCoy...
...that Johnnie Brosten is a junkie.
Watch yourself.
Thanks, Rock.
Yeah?
Big M sent me.
He said l could feed my arm here.
Just a second.
Don't move, you son of a bitch.
Don't move or l'll cut your head off.
Open up, Johnnie.
Get them out, Johnnie.
Everyone move.
-Tell me about Vic Pappas.
-l don't know.
-Tell me.
-l don't know anything.
You don't know anything?
Tell me! l never even knew him.
No, wait, wait! lt's true. l never even saw him.
My wife worked at this...
...joint as a bookkeeper.
What joint? What joint?
Riveredge Export. lt's on Front Street, down at the docks.
That's all l know. Honest. Honest!
That's all.... l didn't even know that they were making it. l swear. That's all l know.
Try Riveredge. Don't.
Or John Bolton. He'd know. He was Pappas' pal.
Where do l find him? Where do l find him?
He works at the Health Club...
...in the Village East, Broadway. ls that it?
On my dead mother, l swear.
Take anything you like.
-l bet you thought this was a sweat box.
-That's what l thought it was, a sweat box.
Good food. lt'll make you healthy.
-You've been eating a lot of fat?
-Yeah. Enjoy yourself.
...lifetime batting average was 369.
Stanley Ketchel, the ''Michigan Assassin,'' had 85 lifetime KOs...
...and would not pass up a bribe for the tank shot.
McCoy, say hello to my friend Marvin, the waiter.
-Mr. Shicks.
-Hi, Marvin.
-Rare or medium?
-Marvin, rare, double vodka, no ice.
You got something for me, right? l got good news, and l got bad news.
Give me the bad news.
The bad news is the information faucet is really turned off on the Pappas thing.
-Give me the good news.
-l got your message, and here l am.
-That's wonderful.
-Thank you, Marvin.
Heinie Manush and Goose Goslin never played ball together, contrary to belief.
Marvin.
Where's Bolton?
See those guys hand-wrestling at the bar?
The guy in the T-shirt, that's Bolton. l predict he will be pinned in two minutes, he's pitted against Big Felix Montaigne.
-Felix who?
-Felix Montaigne, football player, was tight end.
Ex-all-American, ex-all-pro, till he busted his knee.
-What did l tell you?
-You were right.
-Thank you.
-Marvin.
''Strangler'' Lewis...
...had 125 consecutive pins in 1936.
-What does Bolton do?
-Bolton's a bouncer, and he loves his work.
All right, l'm going to get a closer look at Bolton.
You work on Victor Mature's leg.
-You creep, l saw that.
-Who did that? Did you pinch me?
-Pinch you?
-ls that the way you get your jollies?
Me? l certainly did not. l got a drink in one hand and a briefcase in the other.
How could he have pinched me?
He had something in both hands.
He put it down, grabbed you, picked it back up.
-ls that the way you get your jollies?
-lt certainly is not. l should have met my friend someplace else.
-Didn't we meet in a massage parlor?
-You're a very disturbed man. l am. You disturb me a great deal. l think l'm in love with you.
-l don't want to be pushy, but l love you.
-This guy bothering you?
Outrageous!
-Look, the Health Club is here.
-ls everything all right here?
-Yes, everything is just fine, thank you.
-Sorry.
Do you mind holding this?
-You like it?
-Marvin.
Onni Savi, the ''Finn Fantastic'' skied 190 miles without stopping in 1966.
Keep the change, Marvin.
Keep digging on Pappas. l'm going to check on Bolton.
McCoy, the guy likes to hurt people.
Onni Savi?
Who the hell is Onni Savi?
Thank you.
What time does this place close, honey?
-2:00 a.m. What do you have in mind?
-Thought we'd do some skin diving.
Bring your snorkel.
You make me so sick.
Miss?
Just a moment, please. l'll be right with you.
-You got today's newspapers?
-Yeah.
Anything else?
-You don't carry Ring Riders in there?
-No, we don't.
You're a healthy devil, aren't you? ls there anything else l can help you with?
Well, l was just looking for something to read tonight.
You got any suggestions?
Well, how about the new Walter Hill novel?
No, l don't think so. What are you reading now?
Well, currently, l'm just finishing Hoffnung und Sorge.
By Karl Jaspers.
-You know that?
-l read it.
Do you know Die Unauffindbaren by Ernst Kreuder?
-l know it very well.
-l can't wait to get into that.
Do you fool around? l've heard a lot of approaches.
You certainly don't have a problem being direct, do you?
Well, l'll tell you, somebody as pretty as you are...
...they've heard every line there is, you know.
Well, you didn't get a body like that overnight.
Did you?
No.
Thank God. lf you ever want the Melbourne Gazette or the latest...
...Kennels and Paddocks, you know where to find them. l'll make a point of it.
Move it.
Come on, move it.
Who killed Pappas?
Are you a cop?
Who killed Pappas? l don't know. l swear to God.
Are you and him partners?
No.
No bullshit. Come on!
Look, l don't know who killed him. l just introduced him to some people is all.
What people?
-They'll burn me.
-What people?
Montaigne.
-Felix Montaigne?
-Yeah.
Hey, you!
Your life ain't worth spit.
-Heavy, is Springy around?
-No. No calls.
-You want some coffee?
-No.
What the hell is that? l lent a guy a fin and he gave these as collateral.
What do you think? Do they do anything for me?
Yeah. You look like a faggot movie star.
Thanks.
-Tell him l want to check up on that guy.
-Felix Montaigne?
Yeah. Have him call me first thing in the morning.
Sure.
Hey, feet off the table.
You're going to beat the shit out of me, right?
That's right.
-Can't we talk this over?
-You talk too much, McCoy.
-Get him up, get him up.
-Hold him up.
Forget Pappas.
You understand? Forget Pappas.
Hey, McCoy, it's me, Springy. lt's unlocked.
Hey, where you been? l've been calling you for an hour. l've been out.
You could give a guy a call, tell him where....
What are you doing in the tub? l'm taking a bath.
Taking a bath with your clothes on?
Saves on a laundry bill.
Give me a towel.
And a shirt.
-Where?
-Over there. ls this one all right?
Yeah. What about Pappas?
-Hey, you're walking funny.
-Yeah.
So why are you walking funny? l'm in training. l want to break the world's record for walking funny.
Now what about Pappas? l can't find out anything about Pappas. Every drifter l mention him to, comes up with a zero. l've gone up to a C-note. Nothing. No takers.
What about Felix Montaigne?
Like l told you, Montaigne, football player, right?
Ex-pro...
...ex-all-American--
Yeah, you said that.
Anyway, three years ago, the guy retires from pro football...
...takes a job as Vice President with Riveredge Export. One year later--
-Wait a minute. Riveredge Export?
-Yeah.
Down by the docks?
Yeah. 23 Front Street. Does that ring a bell?
Yeah. Pappas and his girlfriend worked there.
Come on, help me with this shirt.
One year later, the guy buys complete ownership...
...and becomes President of Riveredge.
The guy is unmarried, lives with his sister, a big-time model, Alexis.
56 Sutton Place South.
The guy is a big spender.
-ls that it?
-Well, yeah, you want more?
Yeah, l want more.
How does an ex-jock get the money for Riveredge Export, and what does he export?
Okay, l got it. l'll find out. And l'll keep checking on Pappas.
We're really into something big now, huh?
Listen, if anything happens, you get out.
Yeah.
You hear what l'm saying? lf anything happens, you get out.
Okay.
You don't think we're getting into anything too big?
No.
Hello. l'm an old friend of Mr. Montaigne's. l'd rather not be announced.
-l'd kind of like to surprise him.
-The name, sir?
-Mr. Green.
-Thank you. Penthouse A, sir.
Thank you.
Well, hello.
-You must be kidding.
-No, l'm not.
-Did you follow me last night?
-No, ma'am.
How did you get past the doorman?
Charmed him.
Charmed the old boy right out of his socks.
You're selling door-to-door today?
-No. My name is McCoy.
-Mr. McCoy, l have some advice.
-You better go downstairs or l'm going--
-l'm a private detective.
You are something.
Yesterday a pervert, today a private detective.
Mr. McCoy, l'm....
-What do you want?
-l want to see Felix Montaigne. l want to ask him some questions.
He wasn't in his office.
No, he doesn't work on Saturdays.
Maybe l can answer some questions for you. l'm his sister.
Yeah, maybe.
Can l come in?
Thank you.
-Mr. McCoy, would you like to follow me?
-What?
-ls Felix in some sort of trouble?
-Nope. l just want to ask him a couple of questions.
Felix, this is Mr. McCoy.
He's a private detective.
He wants to ask you some questions.
Hi. How do you do?
What can l do for you? l want to ask you about a former employer of yours named Vic Pappas.
Who do you work for?
Well, that's privileged information.
Look, what can you ask that we haven't told the police already?
Well, maybe nothing.
But it might help me out a lot, if you don't mind.
Okay.
-Drink?
-Yeah. Vodka, no ice.
Our records show Pappas came to work for us about six months ago.
Warehouse man. Rated: hard worker.
Attitude: excellent.
Habits: excellent.
Terry Brosten came to work for Riveredge three years ago.
Bookkeeper. Rated: excellent.
Quiet, neat...
...one of our best employees.
No, we did not know they were having an affair.
Yes, we did know Pappas had a record.
But at dockside, that's no big thing.
-Thank you.
-Anything else?
John Bolton. Do you know him?
The bouncer at the Health Club?
-Yeah.
-Yeah, what about him?
Did you know that he and Pappas were friends?
-John Bolton and Pappas?
-Yeah.
No, l didn't. l guess that's all.
-Good.
-Thank you. l'll show him out.
One more thing.
Are you the sole owner of Riveredge Export? l got a partner.
-What's his name?
-Privileged information.
-Lovely apartment you have here.
-Thank you, Mr. McCoy.
Reminds me a great deal of mine. l see the cops are still using the same high-powered...
...scientific methods of gathering information that have made them famous.
-When in doubt, ask the family.
-Do you know this comedian?
-Angie and l were dancing partners in fifth grade.
-Always welcome at Ponte's, McCoy.
-ls the big man in?
-ln the kitchen. l was just telling Angie...
...that we figure it's somebody in the service tied up into the Pappas killing.
-No one else could get near a flamethrower.
-lt's the same thing l--
Let's go see the Doctor.
Gentlemen, welcome.
McCoy.
How's your mother?
She passed away, last year.
And you, Dottore? l survive. lt's not easy, you know.
Come.
-Gentlemen, why don't you have some lunch?
-l don't think so, Dottore.
Come on, have a glass of wine. McCoy?
Gentlemen, tagliatelle verdi all'amatriciana.
Afterwards the aragosta...
...and to make life complete...
...un buon Verdicchio to bring out the flavor.
Buon appetitol
Now, how can l help you?
The Pappas case.
-Anything we should know.
-Angie?
We don't touch it. Not our style.
Dottore...
...last night l got worked over by a couple of professionals.
They did a hell of a job on me. l was wondering if maybe you might know who they were.
We have no quarrel with you, McCoy. lf our boys see you, you don't eat...
...or walk...
...or shoot that beautiful pool.
Check the torpedoes for McCoy.
Dottore...
...but we are running into a stone wall on this Pappas thing.
People downtown, they're pressing me. l know you two since you threw a rock...
...through the window of my brother Giuseppe's fruit store.
You were wild boys. l was amazed the two of you stayed out of jail.
And now you're standup citizens.
This could only happen in America.
So l'm going to tell you a little story. lf a person...
...any person...
...fools around with things that shoot and explode...
...things their own government won't touch...
...this person has a very good chance...
...to wind up doing a permanent back-float in the river.
Gunrunning, munitions. l was only telling a story.
Pappas stole diamonds, not guns.
Diamonds can be insured, books can't.
-Books? What do you--
-l've said enough.
-Do you know Felix Montaigne?
-Yeah.
-He's got a very pretty sister.
-No kidding?
He also knows some tough boys who visit at night.
Well, l thank you for the information, Dottore.
For the old days, and the old neighborhood.
-You're not going to eat?
-l have a previous engagement.
-Where you going?
-You stay and eat.
Yeah. Mangia, mangia.
Selling door-to-door now, are you? l need to talk to you.
-How did you get past the doorman?
-Okay.
Are you going to invite me in? l'm sure that l was rude this morning, and l apologize.
Yes, you were.
-Charming apartment.
-Yes, it is.
You want a drink? lt's over there.
Hey, that's a terrific idea for a bed.
-And that's where you keep score.
-As a matter of fact, yes.
McCoy, l want to hire you professionally.
Are you available?
-What have you got in mind?
-Felix, my brother. l want you to follow him or whatever it is you do.
-You want an egg?
-No, thank you. l want to know where he goes, what he does, and who he talks to.
-Why?
-ls it necessary for you to know that?
-Can't you just do your--
-lt is necessary.
-What seems to be his problem?
-l don't even know that there is a problem. l'm worried about him because he's been behaving very strangely lately.
-Ever since the Pappas killing?
-Even before.
He is a changed man, you know.
He's jumpy, he's irritable.
When l walk into the room, he breaks off telephone conversations.
He never used to do that. You see....
-What are you going to do with that?
-That is club soda.
-lt holds the eggs together.
-You mustn't do that.
-What do you mean?
-You can't put club soda in it.
That makes them very runny.
-My sainted mother taught me that.
-Your mother taught you that?
Who's your brother's partner at Riveredge? l don't know.
-You don't know?
-l don't know.
Felix was a big football star.
You know how it is with big football players?
A lot of people want things.
You know what l mean?
No.
-Do you want this job or don't you?
-Go on.
One of these men, and l don't know his name...
...gave Felix the money to buy Riveredge.
Look how pretty they are. Cheese?
-No.
-Sorry.
-How are they doing financially?
-Profits are up 30 percent since Felix took over.
-What do they export?
-Well, what do you mean? l mean, what do they export?
Munitions? Arms? l don't.... l don't know.
What does that have to do with anything?
Anybody at their warehouse on Sunday?
Not that l know of. Why?
Your brother mention anything about a special book?
No. What book?
-l don't know. You know what?
-What?
You got a great lower lip. l get $75 a day, plus expenses.
Three day minimum, half in advance. lt's $112.50.
All l have is $85.
We could work the rest out on the pool table.
-You know what?
-What? l don't like your mustache.
You want me to call you a cab? lt's not necessary. l'm parked right in front.
Am l going to get a daily report?
McCoy, come on out.
Make it easy on yourself.
There's no way out.
All right, l'm coming out.
-He's not on it.
-What do you mean he's not on it?
Get out front.
There he is. ln a contest for the world bantamweight crown...
...one Vic Toweel knocked down a Danny O'Sullivan...
...a record 14 times in 10 rounds.
Mr. O'Sullivan then retired.
Son of a gun! Gin.
December 2, 1950, South Africa.
-You look awful.
-Thank you.
Any calls?
A guy called 15 minutes ago. l told him you weren't here, and he hung up.
How about the back room?
You want to get a couple of hours of shuteye?
No, l'm going home.
-You have got something for me, right?
-Wrong. l can't even rouse the guy that's the janitor at Riveredge. lt's embarrassing. l've got to know who put up the dough for Riveredge Export.
-You understand?
-l can't promise you anything.
You are worthless to me, totally worthless. l'm not. l'm not looking for any medals on this one.
Listen to me. Listen.
Can you make a phone call?
-You call Vinnie.
-Lieutenant Promuto.
-Tell him to go to Riveredge Export.
-23 Front Street.
Tell him the joint is full of military hardware and a stiff.
A stiff? lf there's a stiff in this, l'm not--
Do it!
Don't you ever go out and fool around?
McCoy?
Yeah? lt's Alexis Montaigne.
-What do you want?
-l want to talk to you.
Are you alone?
Yes, of course. lt's unlocked.
McCoy?
Aren't you overdoing it a little bit?
-Hello there.
-Hi.
What do you want?
Well, you said that l was going to get a daily report.
And you didn't call, then l tried to call you and couldn't get you...
...and so l came over here to get it.
-You came out here for a daily report?
-Yes. l don't work on Sundays, lady.
You don't work on Sundays?
Nope. l have hired me a detective who doesn't work on Sundays. l'm a very religious person.
How about a little light, or does your religion forbid that, too?
Well, l would prefer candles.
Since you're a nonbeliever.
-What did you expect? White tie and tails?
-All you need is a cape and a whip.
Sure you have all the protection you need there?
You know what New York streets are like. l don't know, she doesn't look like she needs any protection.
She's an ''A'' protection, she's flat-chested.
Well, what a pretty cat.
Hello, cat. What's your name?
Cat.
Cat. That makes sense. He belongs to you?
Well, we share the same apartment.
-lt looks like you.
-Yeah, a little.
Hello, pretty cat.
This is a very important confession, and l don't want you to laugh.
When we were making love, l had this tremendous urge.
Well, l wanted to see if my legs would fit in the side pockets.
My feet, so l could keep them warm. l think it's nutty.
You, too?
Well, l'll tell you. l got this.... l got this friend of mine, his name is Springy.
He's a funny little guy, red hair. You'll meet him.
He's got a photographic memory, see?
He remembers all kinds of things.
Statistics and stuff, you know?
You know what he told me?
He said that any woman...
...who has a secret urge to stick her feet in the side pockets...
...is sexually frustrated.
That's me.
-That's me.
-That's you?
That was me.
Yeah?
Yeah, Heavy. Go.
Well, you tell Mr. E.J. Hume that l won't go up to Westchester tonight.
Tell him, if he wants to see me...
...l'll meet him in your place at 10:00 in the morning...
...and then hang up on him. You got it?
Thanks, Heav.
-You sure are tough.
-Yes, l am.
Tough man.
You know him?
-Whom?
-Not whom. Hume.
-Hume?
-E.J. Hume.
The E.J. Hume? The multi-millionaire?
-You met him, right?
-No, never met him.
-No?
-No.
-What about Felix? He ever met him?
-Not that l know of. Why?
-You sure?
-Yeah, l don't know him, why?
Tell me a little bit about your brother.
My big, adorable, handsome brother.
Don't you agree with that? l don't know, l mean....
We've been very close for a long time.
Our folks died when l was 12 and he was 8.
He helped me through a bad marriage and a divorce and everything. lt was really hard for him when he tried to give up football.
He tried hard to find himself, and he did.
He's done crazy things, but he's still a good guy.
-Will you kiss me?
-That's your....
What are you doing?
Got to work my way through the brush to get to the picnic grounds.
He's in there.
He's got help.
Well, the Brothers Grimm.
Mr. McCoy, you have quite a flair for the melodramatic.
Thanks.
Nice place for a meeting. Dirty, hot....
The last time, l froze my ass off.
This time you sweat.
Mr. McCoy, when you accepted this assignment, you were told to report each day.
And l didn't.
Well, l'm off this case.
You see, l never really was on it.
Not the real case.
Was l?
Here's your money back, minus $400.
Expenses. l'll see you around.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. l haven't said you were off the case. l'm entitled to know what you've uncovered up until now.
You're entitled to nothing.
Nothing!
You got a complaint, you take it up with the State Board of Licenses.
And one more thing. l want to apologize in case l lose my temper.
Because if l do lose it, l'm going to kick the hell out of somebody.
You have a very refreshing sense of humor.
All right, you're off the case. l never lose my temper...
...but if l ever should, l want to apologize.
-Nice friends you got there.
-Yeah, beautiful.
-Vinnie been looking for me?
-No.
-Did Springy check in?
-Not yet.
When he checks in, tell him the deal's off.
And tell him to stay here. l'll call you in an hour.
Got it.
-l don't believe we've been formally introduced.
-Shut up, smart ass. l want to show you something.
Hey, fellow, hold it a second.
Oh, my God!
We got a guy. Sector car made him running a red light...
...about a half a mile from here.
There was blood on his jacket.
Anything?
He's a clam.
Hey, man, let's see your pretty face.
Come on, turn, look.
Do you know him?
Watch him.
You know him, don't you?
Okay, last night you have Springy call me and run me out to Riveredge Export.
Guns, munitions all over the joint, he said, and a dead body.
You know what l found? Nothing.
That's right, a great big naught.
That damn watchman thinks l'm a nut.
-You want to tell me about that?
-No.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Do you think this is some credit checkout some shyster lawyer throws your way?
You try to take this alone, and you'll end up in a bag, too.
-Hello.
-Where's your brother? l don't know. He hasn't been around.
Don't give me any crap. Now where is he? l haven't seen him since last Saturday.
Now, would you care to tell me what's wrong?
You remember that little redheaded guy that l told you about? Springy?
Yes.
They found him this morning. His throat was cut.
Oh, no. l'm so sorry.
What does that have to do with Felix? l mean....
You don't think that Felix had something to do with that?
You bet l do.
Well, you're wrong.
Felix wouldn't have anything to do with that. l busted into his warehouse, opened some crates.
You know what l found?
A dead body with a bullet hole through the head.
A dead body?
That's not all.
-lllegal military hardware, machine guns.
-What does that mean? l don't know what it means.
How the hell do l know what it means.
Did you ever hear of a Lieutenant Colonel C.C. Hardcore?
Of course. He has dinner here all the time.
He and Felix have business dealings together, so we have to entertain him often.
He's a weird man.
-When was the last time you saw him?
-l don't know.
They talk on the telephone all the time.
They make dates.
-You got his phone number?
-No. l don't know.
Maybe Felix has it in his book.
Will you see?
-Here it is.
-Will you call him?
-l don't see what this has to do with--
-Will you call him for me, please?
Tell him Felix is out of town.
Tell him you're calling for a very good friend.
-Colonel Hardcore, please.
-Tell him the friend's name is Burns.
Colonel Hardcore, please. Alexis Montaigne.
You have to see him right away.
Colonel Hardcore.... You are very sweet.
Colonel, Felix is not in town.
Now, he's away, but...
...a friend of his has arrived unexpectedly, and Felix would like you to meet him.
-Tonight?
-Now.
No, you see, my friend is very anxious, and he'd like to come out now if that's possible.
Burns.
Oh, that's terrific!
We'll be right there. Thank you.
-Mr. Burns?
-Yeah.
The Colonel's been waiting. Right this way.
-You stay here.
-l want to go with you. l know you do, but stay here anyway. Sit.
Thank you.
Colonel Hardcore.
That was the last real war.
Now, what can l do for you, my boy?
-Well, l represent a--
-Well, you saw action, did you?
Which theater?
Korea. Airborne.
-ls that right?
-Yeah.
You one of them glamour boys?
-Tough, wasn't it, son?
-Yeah. l was with old Georgie Patton himself, in the Third Army. l kept the tanks moving come snow or mud.
Georgie used to say:
''When l die, l'll go to Heaven...
''...because l've already been to Hell.''
Yeah. Colonel Hardcore.
Colonel. l represent this group of people who are very interested...
...in making a bid on some of this surplus material you have here.
Felix Montaigne told me that you were the man that could get the job done.
Let's move out.
Yes, sir. l'll check the files immediately. Right.
-My dear Alexis.
-Colonel Hardcore.
Honored to see you again. lt's nice to see you, too.
What we have here is two-inch armor plate!
We're talking dual-operating, synchronized, self-feeding, .50-caliber machine guns.
We're talking about a 90-millimeter, tank-armor-piercing gun...
...with a range of up to seven miles.
How's that for kill power?
Talk about speed.
Top speed: 45 miles per hour.
Four-wheel drive, full threads, electric fan, air conditioning...
...all included as standard equipment.
Come on.
Now this little baby right here...
...the newly-developed, armored personnel carrier.
Designed to transport 12 persons and a driver.
This unit is amphibious, and can cross inland, lakes, and streams.
-Terrific.
-Closest thing to a masterpiece there is.
How much does one of these babies cost?
$65,000 per unit.
For an APC?
Accompanying ordnance with commensurate prices. lt's the only way.
-Well, that's a little steep, Colonel.
-What?
-l said, that's a little steep.
-This is war material, boy. Not no....
You sure you're on the level? l'll let you in on a secret.
-l've been approached before--
-You've been had.
The cops know about Riveredge and about the guns.
Your brother promised me this wouldn't happen.
Now you got one chance.
You'd better make a deal.
-You promised.
-Tell me about that code book.
He said this would never happen.
Now, he promised.
What are you doing?
Halt!
Pull over! Halt!
Halt, damn it!
Will you let me out of this truck?
Hang on!
Somebody's coming.
Halt! Stop!
Hang on!
Here's the keys to my apartment.
When you arrive call Lt. Promuto, Brooklyn West.
Tell him to go to E.J. Hume's estate.
He knows where it is. You got that?
Wait. l haven't got any money or anything.
-Here's a subway token.
-Subway token.
Take a cab.
Drop it!
Kick it over here.
Put your hands over your head.
Over there against the fireplace.
You, too, ape-shape.
Don't misunderstand this, McCoy.
Sit down.
Put your hands on the desk.
What have you been beating up on poor Felix for?
You could've left him in this room.
He'd have froze to death.
This man has confessed to instigating the murder of Pappas and his woman.
He has admitted to the murder of Amos Ryan, sergeant, U.S. Army flamethrower expert.
Mr. Montaigne has told us where the stolen diamonds were hidden...
...and we've recovered them.
-l'm prepared to give you the agreed upon fee--
-Let me ask you something.
How long has Felix been here?
Since yesterday morning. ls that right?
Get out of there. lf he's been here since yesterday morning...
...then you must have given the order to have Springy's throat cut.
Now you get me that code book.
Samson! l gave you a chance to save your life,
Mr. McCoy.
But you're a persistent man.
-What do we do now?
-Just proceed with our plans for Felix.
Only now we add Mr. McCoy to the festivities. l got a lot of friends that know l'm here.
Yes, but l doubt they'll ever find you.
Samson!
What the hell is going on here?
Get the dogs separated!
-Where's McCoy?
-He went through the woods.
You idiot! Call the gate and tell them to lock it.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Lieutenant Promuto, E.J. Hume.
-l'd like to contact my lawyer.
There's a cabinet behind his desk. ln it you'll find that code book the Dottore told us about. l have a right to talk to my lawyer, mister.
Sergeant...
...give him his rights, call his lawyer, book him.
You look a mess. l don't feel so good either. l'll see you.
Mac, you coming for dinner?
Hi.
Did you hear about Felix?
Promuto called. l'm sorry.
Coming back? l don't know. Not right away. l.... l don't want you to go out of my life.

The foreign secretary, Lord Redcliff.
Your Majesty, being inside of your confidence... is the greatest joy I've ever known.
Lord Redcliff, the fate of England is now in your hands.
Your confidence, being inside of Your Majesty... is the greatest single joy...
I've ever known.
It's all right, Your Majesty.
I've got it.
I've got it.
All's well that ends well.
Shit.
Holy Jesus Christ!
But it's cold outside.
Hmm? Oh
I say, Holmes, what did you think about Bessie Bellwood?
- Who the devil's Bessie Bellwood?
- Who the devil is-
She's the young music hall singer-
Came round to see you this afternoon.
Said she was being blackmailed or some such thing.
Ah, yes. Why? What did you think of her?
Some kind of a crackpot if you ask me.
Too trifling to bother with.
My sentiments exactly.
So, Watson, what do you make of all this stolen document business?
Well, it must be pretty important, indeed if the queen contacts you personally.
Her Majesty believes that unless the Redcliff document... is back in our hands by Thursday night this country will be involved in a devastating war.
- Holmes!
- Her Majesty suspects the French.
Now, you know my thinking, Watson.
- How would you proceed?
- The 7:45 to Paris.
Bravo.
- How the devil can you leave the country tonight-
- Without tipping off... every murderer and petty thief in England the moment we set foot on that train?
Quite simple.
While Sherlock is gone... he will pass on one or two of his less urgent assignments... to his brother Sigerson.
Holmes, you never told me you had a brother Sigerson.
I never told you I had a brother Mycroft until the occasion arose.
- But who is the fellow?
- Sigerson is my younger brother... and he's spent the past 35 years getting hopelessly twisted in my shadow.
- Extremely jealous, is he?
- Something of the sort.
- Love and hate, eh?
- I should say hate and dislike.
Lovely flowers only a copper!
How much did he give you?
- Five pounds.
- Strange fellows.
I still don't understand... why we're going through all this bother.
If that document is so bloody important why aren't you handling this case yourself?
Because it all revolves around a woman,
Watson... and a woman who must fall very much in love... before she's capable of trusting anyone.
Could I trouble you for a light?
Thank you so much.
I suppose you've seen Sigerson about all this.
Seeing me in person is much too upsetting to him.
Well, I assume you selected
some messenger... who will present Sigerson with all the essential information.
Even as we speak, Watson.
Even as we speak.
One Orville Stanley Sacker by name.
He's the only man I've ever met... who has a photographic sense of hearing.
My word
- Are you Mr. S., for Sigerson, Holmes?
- Perhaps.
Do you have a brother whose first name is Sherlock?
- I do not.
- You do have a brother.
- I do.
- Might I inquire as to his first name?
"Sheer Luck"!
I see.
Well, your brother "Sheer Luck" sent me around with an urgent request and this £5 note.
Are you at all interested?
You can tell my brother to take his
£5 note and shove-
May I say that I've been a great admirer of yours for many years... especially your handling of the case of the three testicles.
- You've studied the three testicles?
- Orville Stanley Sacker...
Sergeant, Records Bureau, Scotland Yard.
A pleasure, Mr. Holmes.
Come in, Orville.
I was just making tea.
Hop on that bicycle seat.
I won't be a minute.
Et la, la, la
La, et la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la
Et la, la, la, la, la, la
Come on. We haven't got all night.
All right. Start pedaling.
Keep a steady pace.
Do you think you could pump a little faster?
Certainly.
Et la
- I'm sorry. I wonder if I can get-
- Pedal! Pedal!
For God's sake, man!
Don't just stop in the middle like that
What do you think this is, a toy shop?
Sucker.
Now then, what's this urgent request?
Due to ill health, your brother has decided to take a short vacation in the country- not very long, two or three days at most
- but he would very much appreciate-
- Sit down, won't you?
Thank you.
- Some tea?
- Yes. Thank you very much.
- Pray continue.
- Due to ill health... your brother has decided to take a short vacation in the country not very long, two or three days at most
- but he would very much appreciate-
- Some milk?
- Just a drop.
- You were saying?
Due to ill health... your brother has decided to take a short vacation in the country not very long, two or three days at most
- Sugar?
- Just one, please.
- Yes, yes. Go on.
- Due to ill health... your brother has decided to take a short vacation in the country oh, not very long, two or three days at most- but he would very much appreciate- very much appreciate-
If you would handle one of his most urgent cases during the time of his absence.
- I see.
- All fees going to you, of course.
His way of saying he's stuck.
- Anything else?
- He's taken the liberty of sending around a Miss Bessie Bellwood of Chiselhurst to whom he hopes you might be of some service.
- Bessie Bellwood?
- Yes.
Are you sure the name is Bessie Bellwood?
- Positive.
- I see.
Well, I'm very busy just now but this case might present one or two points of interest.
At any rate, we shall know presently.
For unless I'm very much mistaken the young lady's dainty hand is just about to knock... upon my...
- door!
- How did you-
Shh! Come in, Miss Bessie Bellwood of Chiselhurst.
There's a young lady downstairs to see you, my dear.
- Shall I show her up?
- Show her up!
And stop tippytoeing around out there!
Walk like a man, for God's sake!
- Perhaps I better-
- No, no, no. Sit down, Orville.
I find your presence comforting somehow.
How do you do?
My name is Bessie Bellwood.
- Liar!
- Oh! You don't fool around, do you?
How do you know that I'm not
 Bessie Bellwood?
There's no harm in taking a kiss
It's never missed
If I'd known that love was like this
Should I have kissed?
Love's a game, if you are clever, play your cards and go
Love with me will last forever, that is all I know
Chorus, but you you don't love as I
All right!
Hello.
"Piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy, pooh," cried the farmer's daughter, Phyllis
Piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy, pig
- Well, I don't think I know that one.
- Pity.
The next time you decide to impersonate a music-hall singer who's been dead for 12 and a half years
I suggest you learn her full repertoire.
Won't you come in, Miss Liar?
Thank you. My, what a charming flat.
This is my good friend Orville Slacker.
- Sacker.
- Sacker. Sorry.
Orville, may I present Miss Liar?
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.
- Merci bien.
- Won't you sit down?
No, thanks.
My! Your brother Sherlock certainly is a character.
My brother is a very insecure man.
Now precisely what is it that you want of me?
Well, I have this friend-
- Liar!
- Ha!
I'm being blackmailed.
May I offer you some tea?
No, thanks.
Exactly who and what are you?
My name is Jenny Hill... and I'm simultaneously funny and sad.
How interesting.
Do you have any idea who's blackmailing you?
- Eduardo Gambetti.
- Gambetti?
- Oh, milk or sugar?
- Oh, no, thank you.
Eduardo Gambetti- the name strikes a bell.
Every heard of him, Sacker?
Not Gambetti again.
Fraid so, sir.
Fat little fart fancies himself as an opera singer.
That's him, sir.
Pour us some tea, Sacker.
Yes, sir.
How does he do it, Greerson?
Pays the highest prices for spicy letters, sir.
Everything in the market goes to Gambetti.
The swine. Swine he may be, sir but he certainly is the cleverest of all the blackmailers.
I'm not sure- What just happened?
Never mind. I'll explain it to you later.
The swine wants money from you in return for what?
Mr. Gambetti promised not to show my fiance a-a-a foolish letter I wrote to a silly young man I met in the country.
- What was in the letter?
- Nothing. It was just an innocent little note.
- What was in the letter, Miss Hill?
- Won't you call me Jenny?
What was in the letter, Miss Hill?
By the way, do you mind if I call you Siggy?
Sigerson seems so formal.
What was in the letter, Miss Hill?
I said I wanted to touch his winkle!
I see.
- Good-bye.
- His what?
Nothing! I'll explain it to you later.
- You're leaving?
- Yes, I have to be at the theater by 10:00.
I hope you won't think too unkindly of me but everything I've told you just now has been a lie.
I've just been rehearsing some new material for my act.
I see. Just a few laughs, eh?
Yes, that's the idea.
I was walking along... and then suddenly
I saw your winkle on the door-
Um, I mean, suddenly I saw your shingle on the door... and I said to myself: Why not?
If I'm lucky, I might just get a fresh, unsuspecting audience.
Well, you were very lucky indeed, then, weren't you?
Yes. Today has- I'm-
Well, what can I say?
Um... you've been so very kind... a little gullible, perhaps... but, I'm sorry if I took advantage of you.
Don't feel badly.
I'm sure God would much prefer us to be
- a little too vulnerable than-
- Jenny
Have you seen the latest dance that's come along?
Jenny, go and put your Sunday hat and jacket on
There's going to be some jollity
Come with me, happy be, fill your heart with ecstasy
Jenny
It's the greatest thing Creation's ever known
Take a little tip from me
Hold tight
I'm all right
When you do the
H
O
P
Come on and
Hop, hop
Come and do the kangaroo hop, hop, that's the dance for me and you
If you're over 80 you can waltz a little while
But hopping about the parlor is the very latest style
Come on and hop, hop
Hear the music going pop
You'll never, never want to stop
There's no other kind of dance at all
So come along, my honey, make the others look small
- Come and do the kangaroo
- If you know what's good for you
Come and do the kangaroo hop
Hop, hop
Come and do the kangaroo hop, hop, that's the dance for me and you
If you're over 80 you can waltz a little while
But hopping about the parlor is the very latest style
Come on and hop, hop, hear the music going pop
You'll never, never want to stop
There's no other kind of dance at all
So come along, my honey, make the others look small
Come and do the kangaroo, come and do the kangaroo
Come and do the kangaroo hop
Hop, hop
Come and do the kangaroo hop, hop
Hopping like kangaroos.
That's wonderful, funny.
I love that. I'm dying to hear what comes next.
It's almost time, Professor Moriarty.
I know, Finny, but this is fascinating.
- Go on, Bruner.
- Well, sir-
Pay no mind. Go on with your report.
Well, sir, after a few more moments of hopping-
Go on, Bruner. Go on.
The three of them bounced out of the room.
The three of them... bounced out of the room.
Bounced out of the room!
They bounced out of the room!
They bounced out of the room.
Here.
It really is time for-
Ah.
And you just left them there, Bruner, hmm?
You didn't wait to see which way they might be going?
No sir. I thought their behaviour was so strange-
That I'd better come and tell you right away.
I see. Bounced out of the room.
Oh, that's delicious.
Step this way, Bruner.
Yes.
Is everything all right, Alicia, dear?
Yes, Professor. Fine, thank you.
I wonder if you would do me a small favor, Bruner?
Anything, Professor. Anything.
I wonder if you'd mind leaving by one of these two doors?
I've got some official visitors coming up the main staircase.
I'd rather they didn't see you leaving.
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, sir.
Good lad. Either door, Bruner.
The choice is yours.
Hi, there. I'm working with Prof-
Holy shit!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's the curse again.
And I know you'll understand.
Of course it's been a great trial to your patience, Father... but think of the burden that it's been to me.
Ever since that day... when my hereditary tendencies finally burst out into the open... and I had this irrepressible desire to do something... absolutely rotten every 24 minutes!
Well, it's been very painful to me,
Father.
I mean, thinking up a real corker every 24 minutes is no easy job, I'm telling you!
I've got the
Sweetest little dimple in my cheek
You love to show it
I've got those invitation eyes that seem to speak
You seem to know it
I've got the cutest little walk
The cutest line of baby talk
- And, deary, when it comes to kissing
- There's nothing missing
No, not a pick, I've got that linger-Ionger something in my smile
And that's a blessing
I've got that "Won't you kiss me?"
Wiggle in my style
And we're not guessing
My feelings, you must sense them
Words never could express them
We're simply crazy over you
What shall I do?
They're simply crazy over me
- Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Thank you.
Ready.
You should look on love as an art
And treat it so
If you could but see in my heart
You'd never go
Love's a book, you turn the pages
Till the end, you see
Love will last throughout the ages
There's no end
For me
But you don't love as I do
You can't love as I do
Sometimes I'm sad
But sometimes I'm glad
But if you loved as I love
This world is so small
That there wouldn't be any love left
In the world
For anyone else at all
There's no harm in taking a kiss
It's never missed
If I'd known that love was like this
Should I have kissed?
Love's a game, if you are clever
Play your cards and go
Love with me will last forever
That is all I know
But you don't love as I do
You can't love as I do
Sometimes I'm sad
But sometimes I'm glad
But if you loved as I love
This world is so small
That there wouldn'
What's going on?
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
How much cash does he actually want from you now?
None.
Mr. Gambetti told me he would give me back my letter... if I would promise to steal a certain document... from my father's wall safe.
What does your father do?
He's the janitor in Brownings Bank in Clearwater Street.
Brownings doesn't have a bank in Clearwater Street.
Poor Papa. I wonder if he knows.
What does your father do,
Miss Hill?
How did you know so quickly that Brownings doesn't have a Clearwater branch?
I assumed you were lying.
What does your father do, Miss Hill?
One of these days you're going to assume a broken ass, Mr. Holmes!
- What does your father do?
- That was no accident and you know it.
- I know nothing of the kind.
- If you hadn't made me move downstage...
I would be dead now.
Well, as it happens, you are extraordinarily alive.
Your lies are of the same excellent quality.
I can't help you if you're going to become hysterical... and act as if everyone around is trying to hurt you!
Scream.
Scream
Scream. Scream.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying-
How do you do?
How far are we from Piccadilly Circus?
Not far. There's a long, dark stretch up ahead of us first.
That's what the buggers are waiting for.
Brace yourself till we get there.
- Then try to outrace them, all right, Fred?
- Right you are, guv.
No good, guv.
I can't outrace them with our load.
- Their horses are too fast.
- Get back. I'm coming up.
Away, away, away, away
- Away, away, away, away
- What are you doing?
Whenever I'm petrified,
I either cry or sing.
London streets and places of interest!
- Away, away, away
- Abbey Road! Abbey Street!
- Away, away, away, away
- Abbington Road.
- Adelphi Terrace! Adelphi Theater!
- Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
- Fred
- Yes, sir
Give me your hand for support.
Come on, horsey!
It's time for me to be going home now.
- Good night, guv
- Good-bye!
Evening, Mr. Holmes.
Won't you come join us?
Well-
All right, but just for a few minutes.
Oh, taxi.
Jenny, this isn't the way-
I don't wish to talk about it.
The problem won't disappear... because you don't wish to talk about it.
I don't wish to talk about it!
You're making a tragic mistake, love.
I've made a tragic mistake... more tragic than you can possibly imagine and unless I'm very careful,
I'm going to die for it.
Please let me go. Thank you.
Good night, Sergeant Sacker.
Good night, Jenny.
- Good night, Mr. Holmes.
- Good night.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
Come on.
"Where only a few moments later...
"a prop motorcar...
"slipped from its safety catches
"and crashed upon the stage.
"If London rests a bit more securely tonight...
"it is, once again, due to Mr. Sherlock Holmes... who in his"-
"Quiet, unassuming... genius"-
Care for some more tea, Sacker?
Oh, ta! Don't mind if I do.
- Make us some, would you?
- Righto.
The water's just boiling.
What I don't understand is whether someone was trying to kill Jenny... or whether someone was trying to kill Jenny because she was with you.
That, my boy, is much more to the point.
- Hello.
- What?
- Shh!
- I didn't hear anything.
That doesn't necessarily mean that there wasn't anything to hear.
Don't run away, Jenny! I assure you there's no cause for embarrassment.
Just put your hand back on the doorknob and walk in!
Telegram for you, my dear.
Only just arrived.
I thought I told you not to play outside my door.
But I thought you'd want to see it, sir.
It'd only just come.
I was sweeping down by-
All right! That's enough of this nonsense.
- Give it here!
- Yes, sir.
- What does it say?
- "Greasy goose dressing, excellent.
"Leave room for exactly
10 servings before theater... and pass red lion... on cheddar street cheese. "
Good heavens! I didn't realize it was that late.
- I really must be-
- Oh, don't be a ninny!
It's obviously a code of some sort.
I just have to decipher it.
What do you suppose it means?
Cheddar Street cheese.
Cheddar Street?
Is there any street in London by that name?
- No cheddar.
- Curious.
The clue obviously lies in the word
"cheddar".
Seven letters, rearranged... they come to-
Let me see.
"Radched. "
"Dechdar. "
"Drechad. "
"Chaderd. "
Hello. Chaderd.
Unless I'm very much mistaken
"chaderd" is the Egyptian word meaning to eat fat.
Now we're getting somewhere.
- Have you tried school code?
- What do you mean?
Grammar school code.
Count off every third word.
What are you talking about?
You think we're dealing with simpletons?
All you get from that is,
"Dressing room 10... theater, Red Lion Street. "
Do you call this tea?
No, I call it hot water.
I was just rinsing out the cup when you grabbed it.
May I have some tea, please?
Certainly.
Come in.
How good of you to come.
May I pour you some tea?
Yes, thank you.
Milk and two sugars?
- Yes. Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, once more please from the letter "A."
Sit down, won't you?
Thank you.
Thank you.
May I ask what made you change your mind about seeing me?
Yes, you may.
What made you change your mind about seeing me?
I'll tell you something.
If you had a stronger chin... you'd be a pretty good looker.
- What do you think about that?
- And I'll tell you something.
You're a frightened little girl who for some twisted reason needs to be sexually stimulated... before she'll trust anyone.
What do you think about that?
That is the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard in my life.
Would you like me to warm your pee-
Your tea?
- No, thanks.
- Well-
Well, I'm certainly not... not going to sit here... and- and deny that- that I'm alarmed... by what's happening to my father.
- Biscuit?
- No, thank you.
What is happening to your father?
Ever since I stole that document from his wall safe-
- Yes?
- I-
He hasn't been the same man.
I mean, he'll--He'll spend an hour just staring off into space.
I had no idea that little piece of paper... was so important.
I swear I didn't.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jenny.
- I didn't know-
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you taking your hand away for?
I wasn't trying to-
I didn't mean to.
- I was only trying to make a point.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry if I-
- No, that's all right.
Well, perhaps... we better call it a day.
Could I ask you just one more question?
Don't you even want to know... about my father?
Mmm.
Mmm.
Yes... please.
Who is he?
I can't tell you that!
You can't tell me that?
That's what you've got to tell me.
I can't. Please don't ask me that.
Jenny.
Please. For once in your life trust someone.
I'm trying.
I really am trying.
- It's- It's very difficult.
- Well, let me help you.
I will. I will.
- You'll feel better afterwards. I promise.
- I know I will-
- And you will too.
- Good!
I promise.
- Then who is he?
- Don't ask.
Jenny.
Who is your father?
- He-
- Good.
- Is-
- Good! Good!
Good! Good!
- The-
- Yes! Yes!
Yes! I- I-I can't!
I-
Oh.
Ooh!
Um-
Oh Oh
He is the...
Foreign Secretary for Great Britain!
Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, Jenny.
Perhaps now we can get to the bottom of things.
I think so.
Gentlemen, the Redcliff document will be in my hands... at approximately six minutes past 10 this evening.
Now then, what are my bids?
Russia bids 5,000.
Russia bids 5,000 pounds.
Rubles.
Rubles? All right!
Now then, let's see.
There are eight rubles to the pound so we simply divide 5,000 by eight.
Eight into 50 goes six-
Guests!
Six eights are 48... carry the two, bring down the zero.
Eight into 20 goes twice, eight to 16. Four over.
Carry the four, bring down the zero.
Eight into 40 goes five times!
Spit that out.
Spit it out, or go to your room.
Russia bids £625.
Good thing I'm a math professor.
- 7,000 rubles.
- French francs.
F-French francs?
Of course! Quick, get the daily paper.
France bids 7,000 French francs.
What's a franc going for today?
A franc is 11.18.
A franc is 11.18 to the pound so I simply put down 11.18-
Oh, Christ, how do you do this?
- Just put down 11.18.
- Oh, sure, I wouldn't know... even to put down 11.18.
What I'm asking, you eedjit, is whether you multiply or divide.
- Divide.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- I'll kill you if you screw this up.
Now then, we simply divide 11.18 into 7,000.
What do I do with the decimal point?
You move the decimal point two places to the right.
You mean I divide 1,118 into 7,000?
- What?
Well, you add two zeros to the 7,000 to make up for moving the decimal point two places to the right.
Well, what the hell did we move the decimal point for in the first place?
To make it easier.
All right, the bidding will start at £5,000.
Mr. Holmes to see Lord Redcliff.
- I sent a wire.
- Yes, sir.
His Lordship will be with you presently.
Mr. Holmes?
Lord Red- Redcliff, I presume.
I can't tell you how glad I am
 to see you.
How very nice of you to say.
Tell me, did you, uh-
Did you, uh-
Did you find out anything?
We think-
- We think-
- Yes, I know, but I mean... about- did you, uh-
You're Mr. Holmes, aren't you?
Yes. That's right.
Mm-hmm. Yes.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?
Uh, no. I am his brother...
- Sigerson.
- Sigerson?
Yes. As I'm sure- you're aware my brother comes to me for help on some of his difficult cases.
What is it you wish of me,
Mr. Holmes?
I mean, I'm an extremely busy man.
No more busy than I, Your Lordship,
I assure you.
In that case, let's come to the point.
The point is, Lord Redcliff... that your daughter has told me
 everything.
My daughter? How could you possibly know my daughter?
I have saved her life upon two separate occasions.
Would you be good enough to describe her to me?
She has magnificent red hair about 27 years of age...
I should say 5' 3 ½" tall... and... extraordinarily beautiful.
Really?
Would you please leave my house, sir?
I don't understand.
What have I said?
Mr. Holmes, or whoever you are my daughter has blonde hair a little under five feet, and she's 12 years old.
Will you please pay attention?
In any case, geography, why bother with it?
Why even study it?
Daddy! Daddy!
If it isn't the truth...
I will never see you or speak to you again. I-
Sorry.
Lord Redcliff is my fiance.
I am governess to his children.
I thought he only wanted me for their sake, but... after his wife died,
I realized he really does love me.
We were to be married this Friday afternoon.
How could you have stolen that document from him?
I didn't know what was in it.
- I still don't.
- So you stole the document...
- and gave it to Gambetti.
- Yes.
And now he won't give you back your love letter.
No. He gave it back when I gave him the document.
Then what in God's name do you want from me?
I- I want you to steal the document back from Gambetti.
You-
Sorry.
Where would you like us to drop you off?
He's going to resign as Foreign Secretary.
Where would you like us to drop you off?
I am not proud of what I did!
You've just told me a magnificent success story.
Overlooking the fact that you're a liar a thief, a traitor, and a whore
I don't see what should be bothering you
No! Oh, no! No!
Oh! Please help me.
Do you know where Gambetti lives?
I've been rehearsing in his house for three weeks.
Lord Redcliff arranged for me to be in Mr. Gambetti's opera company.
Sacker, we're going to need a floor plan of Gambetti's house.
- Can you dig one up?
- Well-
- I have one in my purse.
- You-
Yes, I can.
Hurry up! For God's sake, what are you doing back there?
I'm sorry. Can I help you?
- How did you get there?
- Through the gate.
Are you trying to get us killed?
- No, I just thought-
- Never mind! There's no time to argue.
Help me down.
Do you hear music?
- Must be a party.
- Might be a little sticky.
Keep these ready.
I'll show you how simple this can be when you know what you're doing.
Vincenzo di Stefano!
Quick! Behind the curtains.
God 
Dio.
Give me light.
Dammi la luce.
Women won't kiss me.
Le donne non mi voglion baciare.
Woman is fickle.
La donna è mobile.
This is terrible.
Ah, ma questo è terribile.
I love her with all my heart but
La voglio bene con tutto il mio cuore, ma her beautiful eyes
i suoi occhi bellissimi don't see my pain.
non vedono questo dolore mio. my pain is stronger than chains
Il mio dolore è più forte d'una catena around my heart
per tutto il mio cuore.
Here's the knife!
Ecco! Il coltello!
Mamma. Mamma.
Oh, mamma, mamma. Mamma.
Good bye!
Addio!
Mamma.
Knife, here's my heart.
Coltello! Ecco il mio cuore!
Act quickly
Fa presto.
Fa presto.
Act quickly because I don't
Fa presto, perché non want to lose face.
voglio scomparire.
Fa presto, perché non voglio scomparire.
Oh, that's a beauty.
Peek and boo, Professore!
- Ah!
- Signor Gambetti.
I love your hat. I love your face.
I love your nose! By the way, where you keep your wallet?
- Right here.
- Ooh!
Oh, please, please, come in my house!
I love this guy!
Here's your money.
Oh.
- Scusi. To!
Uno, due, tre, quattro,
cinque, sei, sette, otto, nove...
- Feel free to count it.
- Don't touch the money!
- You got a lovely vase.
- And you got a lovely face.
Uno, due, tre, quattro,
cinque, sei, sette, otto, nove...
Hey, we have a nice time, huh?
What a nice, belly (panzone) Boom!
Please, make yourself comfortable.
My house is your house.
Everybody here! Okay!
# Dicite'ncelle vuje a sta cumpagna vosta
Scusa.
You know, Professor Moriarty your mama, she raise a nice boy.
- Now may I please have the document?
Are you crazy? I don't keep the document in the house.
Ma tu si pazzo.
What did you say?
Professore, Professore... don't you understand?
You very big shot.
If I give you the document tonight you can... 
If I give you the document tonight, you gonna send a lot of big boys over here - work for you.
They come over here, they crack my head.
That's no nice.
Then they take the money before I send it home to my mama.
No, no, no, no.
No. I think it's better for my health if I give you the document in public.
In public? How the hell are you going to give it to me in public?
Oh ho! In the opera!
- What opera?
- It- Oh, you-
That's no fair. That's no fair.
- Si. In the opera.
- What opera?
- Italian!
- Which Italian?
Un Ballo in Maschera, by Giuseppe Verdi!
How the hell do I get the document!
While I'm singing!
I'm happy!
# Quando sponta la luna a Marechiare
# Si dice ca le stelle so lucente
We having some fun!
A little expensive, but lotsa fun!
How you feel?
Good! I'm glad!
# Si dice ca le stelle so lucente
But you haven't told me... how I get the document.
In the opera, the messenger, he sing:
# Why don't we all drink some very sexy wine
I give him a big piece of empty paper.
- So?
- So, you got to send your own messenger.
When he sing:
# Why don't we all drink some very sexy wine
Instead of the big piece of empty paper
I give him the Redcliff document and everybody happy.
- Whew.
- Hey, you a little tired?
- Yes.
- Come on. We take a nice nap.
What the..?
Ma che c'è?
Oh, this is some...
Oh, questo... e 'na cosa...
You no fool around.
- Shh.
- Okay, Professore.
Oh, wait.
- Who the hell are you?
- Glass fitter.
I was told you needed several new panes of glass.
I was just taking some preliminary measurements.
Do you always wear formal dress on the job?
- "Elite glass for any class."
- Is that a fact?
You bet your ass.
Ah! That'll be my assistant.
Godfrey, you've made your estimates.
We can toddle off now.
Hey, what's the hell going on here?
Good evening, Mr. Holmes.
- Ooh!
- No, not him. It's his younger brother.
- Oh.
- Enjoying the entertainment, are you?
Not bad. The clowns aren't very funny but you can't have everything.
Would you have some accommodations for our two friends, signor where no one could possibly disturb them?
Well, I got the guest room.
It's, uh, a little bit small but, uh... very, very private.
Good night, boys. Don't have bad dreams.
I am very frightened.
Nothing is hopeless, do you understand?
Nothing!
I wish I knew what in Christ's name he was saying to Moriarty.
Professore... this room is 15 inches wide.
My little saw is gonna come right down the middle.
I hope you like the color red.
- I also read lips.
- Hello.
- What?
- Our inflated bodies... are approximately 11 inches thick but without air in them, they'd only be 7 inches thick-
- Give or take an inch.
- An inch?
Now then, when I say go, start exhaling for all you're worth but not before I say so, or you might be forced to inhale... while the saw's on us.
- Do you understand?
- Of course.
All right
Now!
That way, quickly.
Coming late.
We're singing at the party
We ate a great big dinner
Hot hors d'oeuvres,
Cold hors d'oeuvres
Oy, did we stuff ourselves
The chicken was delicious
Everyone is dancing
Up and down, all around
Let's hope we don't get sick
Hey! I'm here!
You cannot hide this angel face
I knew you by your smell
Is this rotten or wonderfully brave?
Shh!
Stop that, you're such a tickle-tease
You know I'm super passionate
Oh, my, you make my heart go down
Try to hold on to your sex urge
I won't I can't sleep over
All right I'll try it once
If I see that it doesn't work
I know that, ah, maybe practice would help
- You gotta first meet my mama
- Wait a minute!
You gotta sample her cooking
I'm not hungry
- Just antipasto
- No!
And after
We'll hop into bed
You've got your hand on my wife's boobies
Ay-yi!
Ricardo

Why don't we all drink
Some very sexy wine
Why don't we all drink
Some very sexy wine
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
- Huh?
Why don't we all drink
Some very sexy wine
The princess was in peril
The chicken was delicious
Now we drink, Now we dance
Let's hope we don't get sick
Salu-te
Ooh!
- Why don't we all
- Shut your mouth!
The chicken was in peril
The princess was delicious
Now we drink Now we dance
Let's hope we don't get sick
Stop that, you're such a tickle-tease
You know I'm super passionate
Oh, my, you make my heart go pow
Try to hold onto your sex urge
I won't I can't sleep over
All right I'll try it once
If I see that it doesn't work
I know that, ah, maybe practice would help
First taste my mommy's cooking
You cannot say
I'm not hungry
I'm not hungry
Just smell her gnocchi
And after We'll h-h-h-h...
We'll hop into bed
I want you now
I want you now
I want you now
I want you now
Ohh
And me
Oh, boy!
I want you now
I want you now
I want you now
I want you now
I want you now
Ricardo
Ricardo
- Ow!
- Ricardo
Oh, what regret when love devours my heart
Oh
Shit!
Oh
Stay back
A Webly's Number Two,
I think, carries only six cartridges.
Yes, that's right, six.
You're too shit smart for your own good, boy.
This sword I'm carrying is not a prop.
Neither is this.
Did you know I used to be the 11th best fencer in Europe?
If that's true... this should be very exciting.
Drop your sword, Mr. Holmes.
Drop it or I'll-
Blow your brains out.
I always wanted one of those.
Well, let's try out, Mr. Holmes.
That's the way to do it.
Hyah!
You're just being used, you know.
Your brother only meant you for a decoy.
- Did you figure that out yet?
- Yes.
- Ow!
- Oh, be careful of those spikes, lad.
They can hurt something desperate.
Like that.
It's very difficult to be a hero in real life.
You were good, son.
You were very good
But you must always, always, be thinking two and three moves ahead.
Your brother's a master at it.
Now, give me that document... or I'll shove this right through your throat.
I love pure reason.
Good lad! Good! That's the idea!
I even brought one myself, just in case.
I wonder which is the real one.
Drop your swordvor I'll throw these into the river.
Only two left.
This is fun!
Right.
We both know there were four fakes on that prop table.
Now give me the real document you took from Gambetti... or, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Good-bye, son.
Bye-bye.
I still win!
- How are you?
- Never better.
- You?
- Tip-top.
Oh, you did it, boss!
You outsmarted them all!
Aw, you genius son of a g-
Just leave it on that table, would you?
Don't you have to get it to Lord Redcliff?
I think it will be in his hands in a very short while.
Holmes, how can you ever repay him?
By playing the violin, Watson.
By playing the violin.
- Hello!
- Hello.
What do you call this kind of a day?
This is a crazy day.
- Aren't you being married in a few minutes?
- I most certainly am.
Your telegram said urgent.
Urgent? Is that what I said?
I didn't- I'm- I- What did I say,
"urgent"?
- Yes.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Bye.
What the hell am I supposed to do now?
Come on and
Hop, hop
Come and do the kangaroo hop, hop, that's the dance for me and you
If you're over 80 you can waltz a little while
But hopping about the parlor is the very latest style
Come on and hop, hop
Hear the music going pop
You'll never, never want to stop
There's no other kind of dance at all...

I've got the
Sweetest little dimple in my cheek
You love to show it
I've got those invitation eyes that seem to speak
You seem to know it
I've got the cutest little walk
The cutest line of baby talk
- And, deary, when it comes to kissing
- There's nothing missing
No, not a pick, I've got that linger-Ionger something in my smile
And that's a blessing
I've got that "Won't you kiss me?"
Wiggle in my style
And we're not guessing
My feelings, you must sense them
Words never could express them
We're simply crazy over you
What shall I do?
They're simply crazy over me

This is com station Epsilon 9 calling USS Columbia.
Come in, Columbia.
Respond, please.
This is Scout Columbia, Epsilon 9.
Could you boost your transmission?
This is Epsilon 9, Columbia.
Am boosting output.
How read you this?
Fine, fine. Thank you, Epsilon 9.
Receiving your transmission.
Scout Columbia, NCC-621... to rendezvous with
Scout Revere, NCC-595... on stardate 7411.4.
Further orders will be relayed at that time.
Signed Commodore Prober to Starfleet.
- End of transmission.
- Received. Thank you.
Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L-1 4.
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?
Unknown, Sir.
I have an exterior visual.
Attention!
Fire!
We've plotted a course on that cloud, Commander.
It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us.
Heading?
Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth.
Commander Sonak.
You received your appointment as Enterprise science officer?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Then why aren't you aboard?
Captain Decker requested I complete final science briefing here before...
- Here?
- we leave on our mission.
At Starfleet?
The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock.
Which will require
20 more hours at minimum...
Twelve.
I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura... which will not last more than three minutes.
Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Report to you, Sir?
It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting.
Report to me in one hour.
- Admiral!
- Mr. Scott.
Those departure orders... 12 hours.
Starfleet cannot be serious.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters operating, Mr. Scott?
A wee problem, Sir.
Just temporary.
Admiral, we have just finished 18 months... redesigning and refitting the Enterprise.
How in hell do they expect me to have her ready in 12 hours?
Take me over, please.
She needs more work, Sir.
A shakedown!
Mr. Scott, an alien object of unbelievable destructive power... is less than three days away from this planet.
The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise.
Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours.
The crew haven't had near enough transition time... with all the new equipment.
And the engines...
They're not even tested at warp power.
And an untried Captain.
Two-and-a-half years as chief of Starfleet Operations... may have made me a little stale, but I... wouldn't exactly consider myself untried.
- They gave her back to me, Scotty.
- Gave her back, Sir?
I doubt it was that easy with Nogura.
You're right.
Well, any man who could manage such a feat...
I would not dare disappoint.
She'll launch on time, Sir, and she'll be ready.
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
- Aye, Sir.
Cargo bay to launch crew.
A travel pod is now available at dock 6.
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Commander Scott, you're needed in Engineering immediately.
Sir, you'll excuse me.
Flight deck, prepare for an incoming shuttlecraft.
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you...
I think I can find my way, Ensign.
Aye, Sir.
Bridge.
What's the problem?
I thought you people had that circuit patched in an hour ago.
We did. We had to disconnect it.
All right. Take out...
It's going to take us longer that way. We're trying to save time.
I'm still waiting for a check on the line. What's holding it up?
As soon as somebody can get to it.
What's the next program?
I'll get somebody down there as soon as I can, Cleary.
My people are all tied up now.
Captain! Starfleet just signaled your transfer of command orders.
- Captain.
- I appreciate the welcome.
I wish the circumstances were less critical.
Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.
Aye, Sir.
- Where's Captain Decker?
- He's in Engineering, Sir.
He... He doesn't know.
- Mr. Chekov.
- Aye, Sir.
Assemble the crew on the recreation deck at 0400 hours.
I want to show them what we're facing.
Check Cleary on number six.
- Need your cooler status.
- Stand by.
Space matrix restoration coils.
Dilithium crystals.
I knew it. The transporter sensor was not activated.
Air equalization.
Automatic off.
Faulty module.
Cleary, put a new backup sensor into the unit.
Aye, Sir.
Admiral Kirk! Well, we're getting a top brass send-off.
Don't worry, she'll launch on schedule... if we have to tow her out with our bare hands, right, Scotty?
Aye. That we will, Sir.
- Let's talk.
- Sure.
Let me know when that backup's ready.
All due respect, I hope this isn't some kind of Starfleet pep talk.
- I'm really too busy.
- I'm taking over the center seat.
You're what?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
You'll stay on as executive officer.
Temporary grade reduction to Commander.
You personally are assuming command?
Yeah.
- May I ask why?
- My experience.
Five years out there dealing with unknowns like this.
My familiarity with the Enterprise and its crew.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new Enterprise.
You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
That's why you're staying aboard.
I'm sorry, Will.
No, Admiral,
I don't think you're sorry.
Not one damn bit.
I remember when you recommended me for this command.
You told me how envious you were and how much you hoped... you'd find a way to get a starship command again.
Well, Sir, it looks like you found a way.
Report to the bridge,
Commander, immediately.
Aye, Sir.
Transporter room!
Come in! Urgent!
Redline on the transporter,
Mr. Scott!
Transporter, do not engage!
-It's too late. They're beaming now.
- Do not...
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override it! Pull them back!
Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.
Give it to me.
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.
More signal!
- We're losing their pattern!
- Oh, no, they're forming.
Oh my God.
Starfleet, do you have them?
Enterprise, what we got back didn 't live long, fortunately.
Starfleet, Kirk.
Please express my condolences to their families.
Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan embassy.
There was nothing you could have done, Rand.
It wasn't your fault.
Yeoman, turboshaft 8?
Back that way, Sir.
We have to replace
Commander Sonak.
I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible.
None available, Captain.
In fact, there's no one who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mr. Decker.
I'm afraid you're going to have to double as science officer.
That's all we know about it... except that it is now
53.4 hours away from Earth.
Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way.
Our orders are to intercept... investigate and take whatever action is necessary... and possible.
Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon 9.
- Put it on viewer.
- On viewer, Sir.
Enterprise, the cloud is definitely a power field of some kind.
Measures... My God... over eight two AU's in diameter.
Must be something incredible inside there generating it.
We're transmitting lingua code friendship messages... on all frequencies.
No response. have a null reading at the center of the cloud.
Definitely something inside there, but scans are being reflected back.
- Some kind of power surge.
- Receiving an odd pattern now.
Enterprise, they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act.
They seem to be reactingto our scans, Sir.
Deflectors, emergency full!
- We are under attack.
- External view.
Viewer off.
Viewer off.
Prelaunch countdown will commence in 40 minutes.
Transporter system fully repaired and functioning normally, Sir.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Reply we are holding position, awaiting final crew replacements.
Aye, Sir.
Transporter personnel reports... the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia...
She's already aboard and en route to the bridge, Sir.
She's Deltan, Captain.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, Sir.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
- Hello, Ilia.
- Decker.
I was stationed on the lieutenant's home planet some years ago.
Commander Decker?
Yes, our exec and science officer.
Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain.
- May I assume my duties?
- By all means.
Starfleet reports our last six crew members are ready to beam up... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.
Oh? I'll see to it that he beams up.
Transporter room.
Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet...
Just a moment, Captain, Sir.
I'll explain what happened.
Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little-known... seldom-used reserve activation clause.
In simpler language, Captain, they drafted me!
They didn't.
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?
Bones, there's a thing out there.
Why is any object we don't understand always called a thing?
Headed this way. I need you.
Damn it, Bones, I need you.
Badly!
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted, Sir.
Well, Jim,
I hear Chapel's an MD now.
Well, I'm going to need a top nurse... not a doctor who will argue every little diagnosis with me.
And they probably redesigned the whole sick bay too!
I know engineers.
They love to change things.
Dock control reports ready, Sir.
- Helm ready, Sir.
- Orbital departure on plot, Sir.
Yard command signaling clear, Sir.
- Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- Maneuvering thrusters, Sir.
Hold station.
Thrusters at station-keeping, Sir.
Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu.
Take us out.
Intermix set, Bridge.

Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7412.6...
1.8 hours from launch.
In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time... we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system.
Captain, assuming we have full warp capability... accelerating to warp 7 on leaving the solar system... will bring us to IP with the intruder in 20.1 hours.
Science Officer competition.
Confirm, Sir
Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval?
They do not. It's like working in a damn computer center.
- Programming ready?
- Set for standard warp entry.
But I still recommend further simulation study.
Mr. Decker, every minute brings that object closer to Earth.
Engineering, stand by for warp drive.
Captain, we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors.
Engineer, we need warp speed now!
Jim, you're pushing.
Your people know their jobs.
That's it, Sir.
I can't do any better.
Aye, lad.
It's borderline on the simulator.
I cannot guarantee she'll hold up.
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.
- Ahead warp 1 , Mr. Sulu.
- Accelerating to warp 1, Sir.
Warp .7, .8.
Warp 1 , Sir.
Mr. Decker...
Wormhole. Get us back on impulse power. Full reverse.
Negative helm control, Captain.
Going reverse on impulse power.
Subspace frequencies jammed, Sir!
Wormhole effect!
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22.5 seconds... before forward velocity slows to sublight speed.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us.
- Directly ahead.
- Force fields up full.
Put object on viewer.
- Go manual override on helm.
- No manual response, Sir.
Navigational deflectors coming up, Sir.
Wormhole distortion has overloaded the main power systems.
Navigational deflectors inoperative, Captain.
Directional control also inoperative.
Time to impact?
Twenty seconds.
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.
No!
Belay that phaser order!
Arm photon torpedoes!
Photon torpedoes... armed!
Object is an asteroid.
Reading mass .7.
Targeting... asteroid!
Impact in ten seconds.
Impact in eight seconds.
- Fire torpedoes!
- Six!
Torpedoes away!
Five!
Helm control restored, Sir.
- Position report, Navigator.
- Computing new intersection course.
Communications are normal, Sir.
Negative damage reported, Captain.
No casualties reported, Doctor.
Wrong, Mr. Chekov.There are casualties.
My wits, as in
"frightened out of," Captain, Sir.
We were at warp .8.
Engineer, report your status there.
In just a second, Exec. We're picking up the pieces down here.
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive as soon as possible.
The engine imbalance created the wormhole in the first place.
It'll happen again if we don't correct it.
That object is less than two days away from Earth.
We need to intercept while it still is out there.
Lay in a heading to conform with our initial IP with the intruder.
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
Mr. Decker.
-I'd like to see you in my quarters.
-Mind if I tag along, Captain?
Level 5.
All right, explanation. Why was my phaser order countermanded?
The Enterprise redesign increases phaser power... by channeling it through the main engines.
When they went into antimatter imbalance... the phasers were automatically cut off.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Thank you, Sir.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
- You saved the ship.
- I'm aware of that, Sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker.
- Permission to speak freely, Sir?
- Granted.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two-and-a-half years.
That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's redesign... in my opinion, Sir, seriously jeopardizes this mission.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties?
Yes, Sir, I'll do that.
Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, Commander.
- Yes, Doctor?
- Aye, Sir.
He may be right, Jim.
- Was it difficult?
- No more than I expected.
About as difficult as seeing you again.
- I'm sorry.
- That you left Delta IV?
Or that you didn't even say good-bye?
If I had seen you again... would you have been able to say it?
No.
Make your point, Doctor.
The point, Captain, is that it's you who is competing.
You rammed getting this command down Starfleet's throat.
You've used this emergency to get the Enterprise back.
And I intend to keep her, is that what you're saying?
Yes.
It's an obsession.
An obsession that can blind you... to far more immediate and critical responsibilities.
Your reaction to Decker is an example, Jim.
- Bridge to Captain.
- Viewer on.
Signal from a Federation registered long-range shuttle, Sir.
She wishes to come alongside and lock on.
For what purpose?
My security scan shows it has a grade-one priority, Captain.
Non belligerency confirmed.
I suspect it is a courier of some kind.
Very well, Mr. Chekov.
See to it.
Viewer off.
Your opinion has been noted.
Anything further?
That depends on you.
Security scan.: one boarder.
Identity: Starfleet, inactive.
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.
Gran... ted.
Why... Why, it's Mister...
Spock!
Spock.
Commander, if I may?
If... Oh.
I've been monitoring your communications with Starfleet.
I'm aware of your engine design difficulties.
I offer my services as science officer... with all due respect,
Commander.
- If our exec has no objections.
- Of course not.
I'm well aware of
Mr. Spock's qualifications.
Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated.
List him as science officer.
Both effective immediately.
Mr. Spock.
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you.
It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock.
Captain, with your permission...
I will now discuss these fuel equations with the engineer.
Mr. Spock.
Welcome aboard.
Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7413.4.
Thanks to Mr. Spock's timely arrival and assistance... we have the engines rebalanced into full warp capacity.
Repair time.: less than three hours.
Which means we will now be able to intercept intruder... while still more than a day from Earth.
Warp .8.
Warp 2, Sir.
Warp 3.
Warp 4.
Warp 5.
Warp 6.
Warp 7.
Science Officer Spock, reporting as ordered, Captain.
Please, sit down.
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.
You're just as warm and sociable as ever.
Nor have you, Doctor... as your continued predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates.
Gentlemen.
At last report, you were on Vulcan... apparently to stay.
Yes, you were undergoing the ''Kolanear'' discipline.
Sit down.
If you are referring to the
Kolinahr, Doctor, you are correct.
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr. Spock, it's the Vulcan ritual... that's supposed to purge all remaining emotions.
The Kolinahr is also a discipline you broke to join us.
Will you, please, sit down?
On Vulcan I began sensing a consciousness... from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered.
Thought patterns of exactingly perfect order.
I believe they emanate from the intruder.
I believe it may hold my answers.
Isn't it lucky for you that we just happened to be heading your way?
Bones!
We need him.
I need him.
Then my presence is to our mutual advantage.
Any thought patterns you might sense... whether they appear to affect you personally or not...
I expect immediately reported.
Of course, Captain.
- Is there anything else?
- No.
Jim?
If this super intelligence... is as important to him as he says it is, how do we know...
That he wouldn't put his own interests ahead of the ship's?
I could never believe that.
Bridge to Officers' Lounge.
Captain Kirk.
Revised estimate on cloud visual contact.:3.7minutes.
Standard light, Engineer.
- Full mag on viewer.
- Full mag, Sir.
Lingua code?
Continuing friendship messages on all frequencies, Sir.
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status red.
Captain, we are being scanned.
Do not return scan, Mr. Spock.
It could be misinterpreted as hostility.
Intruder scans emanating from the exact center of the cloud.
Energy of a type... never before encountered.
There's no response to friendship messages, Sir.
- Shall I go to battle stations?
- Negative.
We'll take no provocative action.
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain. Screens and shields.
No, Mr. Decker, that could also be misinterpreted as hostile.
Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
- Twelfth-power energy field.
- Twelfth-power?
We've seen what their weapons can do.
Shouldn't we take every precaution?
- Mr. Decker...
- Captain.
I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack.
If that order isn't clear enough...
Captain, as your exec it's my duty... to point out alternatives.
Yes, it is.
I stand corrected.
Five minutes to cloud boundary.
Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path to the cloud center.
Bring us parallel to whatever we find in there.
Mr. Sulu, tactical plot on viewer.
Tactical on viewer, Sir.
That measures 12th-power energy?
Thousands of starships couldn't generate that much...
Mr. Spock?
Spock, tell me.
I sense... puzzlement.
We have been contacted.
Why have we not replied?
Contacted?
How?
Force fields up full.
Deflectors, now.
Force fields and deflectors up full, Captain.
Analysis, Mr. Spock.
Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy, Captain.
Exact composition unknown.
Guidance system unknown.
All decks, brace for impact.
Engineering, status report.
Systems overloading, Captain.
Medic.
Medics are coming.
Engineering to Bridge.
Cannot hold full power on force fields.
Deflector power is down 70 percent.
Divert auxiliary power to deflectors.
Captain.
The intruder has been attempting to communicate.
I am now programming our computer... to transmit lingua code at their frequency and rate of speed.
Commander.
Spock!
Here it comes.
Engineering, what's happening to our force field?
Our shields cannot handle another attack.
Mr. Spock.
Impact in 20 seconds
Spock.
Fifteen seconds.
Spock, transmit now.
Ten seconds.
Transmitting.
It would seem our friendship messages... have been received and understood, Mr. Spock.
I would say that was a logical assumption, Captain.
Mr. Sulu, hold present position.
Holding present position, Sir.
Tactical plot on viewer.
Course projection on tactical, Sir.
Opinion, Mr. Spock.
Recommend we proceed, Captain.
- Mr. Decker?
- I advise caution, Captain.
We can't withstand another attack.
That thing is 20 hours away from Earth.
- We know nothing about it as yet.
- Precisely the point, Captain.
We don't know what it'll do.
Moving into that cloud at this time... is an unwarranted gamble.
How do you define ''unwarranted''?
You asked my opinion, Sir.
Viewer. Standard ahead.
Navigator, maintain course.
Helmsman... steady as she goes.
No vessel could generate a power field of this magnitude.
Spock.
Instruments fluctuating,
Captain.
Patterns unrecognizable.
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.
Advise we are attempting further communication.
Unable to make contact with Starfleet, Captain.
Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back.
We are closing on it rapidly, Captain.
Reduce magnification factor four, Mr. Sulu.
We are already two settings below that, Sir.
Mr. Sulu... bring us into a parallel course... over the alien... at 500 meters.
Five hundred meters?
Then take us out to 100 kilometers distance... adjusting parallel course.
Aye, Sir.
Viewer astern.
Reverse angle on the view,
Captain.
Five hundred meters.
Viewer ahead, Sir.
Hold relative position here.
Mr. Spock!
Can that be one of their crew?
A probe from their vessel,
Captain.
Plasma-energy combination.
Don't interfere with it.
Absolutely, I will not interfere.
No one interfere.
It doesn't seem interested in us.
Only the ship.
Computer off.
It's taking control of the computer.
It's running our records...
Earth defenses, Starfleet strength.
Ilia!
Ilia!
This is how I define ''unwarranted.''
Activate auxiliary computer circuits through manual shutoff.
Captain, we've been seized by a tractor beam.
Get someone up here to take the navigator's station.
- Engineering.
- Chief DiFalco, to the bridge.
- Emergency power.
- Going to full emergency.
But, Captain, if we don't break free in 15 seconds, she'll burn up.
We cannot break free, Captain.
We have only a fraction of the power necessary.
Engineering, belay that order.
Disengage all main drive systems.
Chief DiFalco, take over Lieutenant Ilia's station.
DiFalco, disengage engine navigation relays now.
Aye, Sir.
Force field circuits
E-10 through 14... show ready for reactivation.
Confirm, please.
Scotty, drive systems should be free now.
Commander?
Ready to launch remote communications drone... with complete ship's records... including our present situation, Sir.
Delay launching as long as possible.
Our drone can't escape as long as we're held in their tractor.
Aye.
Captain, a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam... might weaken it just enough for us to break free.
Break free to where, Commander?
Any show of resistance would be futile, Captain.
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.
Why are you opposed to trying?
Why bring us inside?
Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.
They still can.
Curiosity, Mr. Decker.
Insatiable curiosity.
Captain, photic sonar readings indicate the aperture is closing.
We're trapped, Sir.
Reverse angle on the viewer,
Captain.
Tractor beam has released us,
Captain.
Confirmed.
Vessel is floating free.
No forward momentum.
Viewer ahead.
Viewer ahead, Sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead one third.
Thrusters ahead one third.
Let's take a look.
Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock.
They can't expect us not to look them over now.
Now that we're looking down their throat.
Right, now that we've got them just where they want us.
It's closing up.
Hold position.
Captain.
All our scans are being reflected back.
Sensors are useless.
Damn.
What do you make of all this?
I believe the closed orifice leads to another chamber... undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism.
I suspect it may be necess...
Intruder alert!
Deck 5. Officer's quarters.
Have Security meet me at deck 5, main elevator.
Spock.
Mr. Decker, you have the com.
Hold positions.
You are the Kirk unit.
You will assist me.
I have been programmed by V'Ger... to observe and record... normal functions of the carbon-based units... infesting USS Enterprise.
-Jim, what's going on?
- Tricorder.
Who is...
V'Ger?
V'Ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'Ger the name of the Captain of the alien vessel?
Jim.
This is a mechanism.
A probe, Captain.
No doubt a sensor-transceiver combination... recording everything we say and do.
Where is Lieutenant Ilia?
That unit no longer functions.
I've been given its form... to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units... infesting Enterprise.
Carbon-based units?
Humans, Ensign Perez.
Us.
Why does V'Ger travel... to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
To find the creator.
Find the creator?
Whose...
What does V'Ger want with the creator?
To join with him.
To join with the creator? How?
V'Ger and the creator will become one.
And who is the creator?
The creator is that which created V'Ger.
Who is V'Ger?
V'Ger is that which seeks the creator.
I'm ready to commence my observations.
Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe... might provide some insight into those who manufactured it... and how to deal with them.
Fine.
Let's get her to sick bay.
I'm programmed to observe and record... only the normal functioning of the carbon-based units.
The, uh... examination is a normal function.
You may proceed.
Micro-miniature hydraulics... sensors... and molecule-sized multiprocessor chips.
And take a look at this.
An osmotic micropump, right here.
Even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated.
Every exocrine system is the same, too... even eye moisture.
Decker.
Fascinating.
Not ''Decker unit.''
Gentlemen.
Will.
- What happened to her?
- Captain.
This probe may be our key to the aliens.
- Probe? Ilia?
- Exactly.
It is a programmed mechanism,
Commander.
Its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail.
Suppose that, beneath its programming... the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
- They had a pattern to follow.
- Indeed.
They may have followed it too precisely.
Ilia's memory... her feelings of loyalty, obedience, friendship... might all be there.
You did have a relationship with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That probe, in another form, is what killed Ilia.
Commander...
Will, we're locked in an alien vessel... six hours from Earth's orbit.
Our only contact with our captor is that probe.
If we can control it, persuade it, use it...
I have recorded enough here.
You will now assist me further.
The, uh...
Decker unit can assist you with much greater efficiency.
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr. Decker.
Aye, Sir.
I am concerned with that being our only source of information, Captain.
Captain's Log:
Stardate 7414.1.
Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth.
No significant progress thus far... reviving Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe.
This remains our only means of contact with our captor.
All those vessels were called Enterprise.
The carbon units use this area for recreation.
This is one of the games.
What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?
The words ''recreation''... and ''enjoy''... have no meaning to my programming.
Ilia enjoyed this game.
She nearly always won.
Good. He's using audiovisual association.
This device serves no purpose.
Why does Enterprise require the presence of carbon units?
Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary... before carbon units can be patterned... for data storage.
What does that mean?
When my examination is complete... all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Within you... are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit.
If I can help you to revive those patterns... you could understand our functions better.
That is logical.
You may proceed.
I remember Lieutenant Ilia once mentioning she wore that.
On Delta.
Remember?
Ilia.
Dr. Chapel.
Will?
Ilia.
Commander.
Commander.
This is a mechanism.
Ilia... help us make direct contact with V'Ger.
I cannot.
This creator V'Ger is looking for... what is it?
V'Ger does not know.
Computer, commence recording.
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail my attempt... to contact the aliens.
I intend to calculate thruster ignition and acceleration rate... to coincide with the opening of the V'Ger orifice.
This should facilitate a better view... of the interior of the alien spacecraft.
Captain, Starfleet signals are growing in strength, Sir.
They still have the intruder on their monitors.
- It's decelerating.
- Confirmed, Sir.
Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into Earth orbit.
Sir, air lock 4 has been opened.
A thruster suit is reported missing.
A thruster suit?
That's Spock.
Damn him.
Bring him back here.
No, wait.
- Get a fix on his position.
- Aye, Sir.
I have successfully penetrated... the next chamber of the alien's interior... and I'm witnessing some sort of dimensional image... which I believe to be a representation... of V'Ger's home planet.
I'm passing through a connecting tunnel.
Apparently, a kind of plasma-energy conduit.
Possibly a field coil for a gigantic imaging system.
Curious.
I'm seeing images of planets, moons, stars... whole galaxies all stored here, recorded.
It could be a representation of V'Ger's entire journey.
But who or what... are we dealing with?
The Epsilon 9 station, stored here with every detail.
Captain, I am now quite convinced... that all of this is V'Ger... that we are inside a living machine.
Ilia.
The sensor... must contain some special meaning.
I must try to mind-meld with it.
Spock.
Spock!
Spock.
Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection.
Indications of some neurological trauma.
The power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering.
Spock.
Jim.
I should have known.
Were you right... about V'Ger?
A life-form of its own.
A conscious, living entity.
A living machine?
It considers the Enterprise a living machine.
That's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity.
I saw V'Ger's planet.
A planet populated by living machines.
Unbelievable technology.
V'Ger has knowledge that spans this universe.
And yet... with all its pure logic...
V'Ger is barren... cold.
No mystery.
No beauty.
Should have known.
Known?
Known what? Spock.
What should you have known?
What should you have known?
Jim... this... simple feeling... is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.
No meaning, no hope.
Jim... no answers.
It's asking questions.
''Is this... all that I am?
Is there nothing more?''
Bridge to Captain.
Kirk here.
A faint signal from Starfleet, Sir.
Intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors... for the past 27 minutes.
Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches.
Starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to sub-warp speed.
We are three minutes from Earth orbit.
I'll be right there.
I need Spock on the bridge.
Dalaphaline, five cc's.
A machine planet... sending a machine to Earth.. looking for its creator.
It's absolutely incredible.
Mr. Chekov.
Commander Decker present location.
They are in the engineering, Sir.
Captain, Starfleet is sending this tactical on V'Ger's position.
V'Ger is transmitting... a signal.
Jim.
From V'Ger.
V'Ger signals the creator.
Spock?
A simple binary code... transmitted by carrier wave signal.
Radio.
Radio?
Jim.
V'Ger expects an answer.
An answer?
I don't know the question.
The creator has not responded.
All planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative.
Sir, Starfleet computes the devices are proceeding... toward equidistant positions orbiting the planet.
They're the same things that hit us.
They are hundreds of times more powerful, Captain.
From those positions... they could devastate the entire surface of the planet.
Why?
The creator has not answered.
The carbon unit infestation is to be removed from the creator's planet.
Why?
You infest Enterprise.
You interfere with the creator in the same manner.
V'Ger
V'Ger
Captain.
V'Ger is a child.
I suggest you treat it as such.
- A child?
- Yes, Captain.
A child... evolving, learning, searching... instinctively needing.
- Needing what?
- Spock.
This child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth.
Now, what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?
It knows only that it needs,
Commander.
But, like so many of us... it does not know what.
The carbon units know why the creator has not responded.
Disclose the information.
Not until V'Ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Captain.
I'm losing Starfleet.
Interference from V'Ger.
Kirk unit, disclose the information.
Why has the creator not responded?
No.
Secure all stations.
Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge, Captain?
- That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
- Clear the bridge  - Aye, Sir.
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr. Spock.
V'Ger requires the information.
Bridge, secure all stations.
Move out.
Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this?
All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain.
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise... the information that V'Ger requires will also be destroyed.
It is illogical to withhold required information.
Kirk unit!
Kirk unit.
Why do you not disclose information?
Because V'Ger's going to destroy all carbon units on the third planet.
They have repressed the creator.
The information will not be disclosed.
V'Ger needs the information.
Then V'Ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices.
V'Ger will comply... if the carbon units will disclose the information.
It learns fast, doesn't it?
Captain, the vessel... V'Ger... obviously operates from a central brain complex.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from that point, then.
Precisely.
The carbon unit's information cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe... but only to V'Ger directly.
Forward motion, Captain.
Tractor beam.
Captain, what's the next move?
The question is, Mr. Decker... is there a next move?
Resume duty stations.
All personnel, resume stations.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff has been called.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices reach final position?
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.
Captain, I believe that is our destination.
Forward motion slowing, Captain.
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise.
Forward motion stopped, Captain.
V'Ger.
Sir, I've located the source of V'Ger's radio signal.
It's directly ahead.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'Ger and its creator.
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger... with the required information.
Mr. Spock. Bones.
Mr. Decker, I will contact you every five minutes.
Captain.
I'd like to go along.
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
V'Ger.
''V... G-E-R.''
V'Ger.
''V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.''
Voyager.
Voyager 6.
NASA. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Jim... this was launched more than 300 years ago.
Voyager series.
Designed to collect data... and transmit it back to Earth.
Captain...
Voyager 6 disappeared into what they used to call a black hole.
It must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy... and fell into the machine planet's gravitational field.
The machine inhabitants found it to be one of their own kind... primitive, yet kindred.
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming... collect all data possible.
Learn all that is learnable.
Return that information to its creator.
Precisely, Mr. Decker.
The machines interpreted it literally.
They built this entire vessel... so that Voyager could actually fulfill its programming.
And on its journey back... it amassed so much knowledge... it achieved consciousness itself.
It became a living thing.
Kirk unit.
V'Ger awaits the information.
Enterprise... order up the ship's computer library records... on the late 20th-century
NASA probe Voyager 6.
Specifically, we want the old NASA code signal... that instructs the probe to transmit its data.
- And fast, Uhura, fast.
-Aye, Sir.
That's what it's been signaling... its readiness to transmit its information.
And there's no one on Earth... who could recognize the old signal and send a response.
The creator does not answer.
V'Ger.
V'Ger.
V'Ger!
We are the creator.
That is not logical.
Carbon units are not true life-forms.
We will prove it.
We will make it possible for you to complete your programming.
Only the creator could accomplish that.
Enterprise?
We have just received the response code, Captain.
Set the Enterprise transmitter on appropriate frequency... and transmit the code now.
Transmitting. and the final sequence.
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.
Voyager is not transmitting its data, Captain.
The creator must join with V'Ger.
Uhura, repeat the final sequence.
The creator must join with V'Ger.
Voyager is not transmitting,
Captain... because it did not receive the final sequence.
Jim, we're down to ten minutes.
Enterprise, stand by.
- The antenna leads are melted away.
- Yes, Captain, just now.
By V'Ger itself.
- Why?
- To prevent reception.
Of course.
To bring the creator here.
To finish transmitting the code in person.
To touch the creator.
Capture God?
V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell of a disappointment.
Perhaps not, Doctor.
Captain.
V'Ger must evolve.
Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe. It must evolve.
What it requires of its god, Doctor, is the answer to its question...
Is there nothing more?
What more is there than the universe, Spock?
Other dimensions.
Higher levels of being.
The existence of which cannot be proven logically.
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable of believing in them.
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve... is a human quality... our capacity to leap beyond logic.
Joining with its creator might accomplish that.
You mean this machine wants to physically join with a human?
Is that possible?
Let's find out.
Decker.
I'm gonna key the final sequence through the ground test computer.
You don't know what that'll do to you!
Yes, I do, Doctor.
Decker, don't.
Jim, I want this.
As much as you wanted the Enterprise, I want this.
Captain.
Spock, did we just see the beginning of a new life-form?
Yes, Captain.
We witnessed a birth.
Possibly a next step in our evolution.
I wonder.
Well, it's been a long time since I delivered a baby.
I hope we got this one off to a good start.
I hope so too.
I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose... out of our own human weaknesses... and the drive that compels us to overcome them.
And a lot of foolish human emotions.
Right, Mr. Spock?
Quite true, Doctor.
Unfortunately, it will have to deal with them as well.
Interrogative from Starfleet.
They're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status.
Report two casualties.
Lieutenant Ilia.
Captain Decker.
- Aye, Sir.
- Correction.
They're not casualties.
They...
List them as missing.
Vessel status: fully operational.
Aye, Sir.
Mr. Scott, shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown?
I would say it's time for that, Sir, aye.
We can have you back on Vulcan in four days, Mr. Spock.
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.
My task on Vulcan is completed.
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1 .
- Warp 1 , Sir.
- Heading, Sir?
Out there.
That away.

THE SPIDER'S STRATAGEM
Freely inspired by the story
"Theme of the Traitor and the Hero" by Jorge Luis Borges
Please...
- Tara!
"Athos Magnani Street"
Where's a hotel?
- First left, first right.   - Thanks.
No, first he must turn right.
- Turn left...   - No!
I'll ask again when you've sorted it out.
"Youth Society of Culture"
Is there a hotel?
"ATHOS MAGNANI, A HERO COWARDLY
MURDERED BY FASCIST BULLETS"
Do you have a room please?
I don't know...
For how long?
I don't know.
Name and surname.
The register is over there.
What's your name?
- Athos Magnani.
What?
- Athos Magnani.
Identical...
Identical... just look!
Really identical!
To whom?
- Your father!
Do you know a certain Draifa?
Mmmm... Draifa!
- Where does she live?
Not near, by foot.
You'll need a bicycle.
Wait, I'll help you.
I'll come out and show you the way.
Yes. Is it far?
- No... ten, fifteen minutes.
So where to?
OK, now straight ahead,.. then take the embankment road.
When you see the overpass, the house is nearby.
Are you Draifa?
Come!
Don't be afraid!
See how you look like him?
It is not true that he came from Rome, nor from Cremona, nor from Ferrara.
Your father's murderer is someone from Tara, someone from here.
Your father was famous here as an anti-Fascist.
They shot him in the back, at the theatre,.. during Rigoletto.
Sure, you won't find his name in history books... but here, for us, he lives on.
He had many friends, and even more enemies.
He overawed everybody.
He was afraid of nothing, not even of me.
I was very young, and he wouldn't separate from his wife.
And I'm more jealous than Othello.
Why did you want to meet me?
After his death, your mother was pregnant.
Yes, with you!
But she disappeared!
She was afraid of the Fascists.
Not me, I stayed.
They wouldn't dare.
They all respect me.
How did you get my address?
- It was a miracle.
I saw your picture in a Milan newspaper.
I was stunned. The image of Athos!
Unbelievable! Athos resurrected.
We never found out who killed him.
Now that you're here, you'll find him, won't you?
When did it happen?
The 15th of June,
There's a train in an hour.
If I hurry, I'll catch it,
You look tired! You must be hungry.
Sit down and eat.
He loved to eat well.
They must have shot him during the applause, since no one heard the shot.
I talk too much, huh?
Here in Tara they have the cinema, telephones, television; all a façade.
Here everything stopped the night they killed him.
Say the truth,
I sound a little crazy?
You were very close to my father?
Close?
His acknowledged mistress!
I still am, for them.
As if nothing had changed.
Athos is there, young Athos, heroic, handsome Athos, murdered Athos.
He died before seeing the liberation he dreamed of.
It sounds like a mystery classic.
Joke about it!
Anyway, they never found the murderer.
There was an investigation, right?
It was a joke! They were all in cahoots!
Imagine, the cops found an anonymous letter in his pocket. Still closed!
They opened it, and it said he'd die if he went to the theatre.
Like Julius Caesar.
- Who?
Julius Caesar, before entering the Senate.
Like Athos, same thing!
There is another strange fact.
- Another legend?
No, he told me this in person.
A gypsy,.. at the tavern, a few days before the crime,.. read his hand and predicted his death,
I swear.
Macbeth.
The witches' prediction.
You must have studied a lot.
It's late. I... should go.
See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
I've a train tomorrow.
Who knows!
- No, I have it at 9:45.
Lady?
Lady!
What are we doing?
Lady, what are you doing?
Lady?
Lady!
Lady?
Lady!
Lady?
- It's nothing...
How are you?
- It's nothing, I feel better now.
Really? Want some water?
I'll get you a glass of water!
No, no, nothing.
I feel better now.
You frightened me.
Maybe because you're barefoot.
I like it a lot.
I always have, since childhood.
I'm always barefoot!
Are you sure to be fine?
But you had to go, right?
Didn't you have to go?
Then go, go!
Well, I can stay.
- Go now. Go!
No, no, you must go.
You may go.
There's no need, lady... - Go now.
I don't need anything, you can go.
Look, I'm in no hurry. If you like...
- Go, go!
'Night.
- Go!
Aren't there any young people in this town?
No young people in town?
How old am I?
How old?...About 70.
Seventy-five, and a pregnant girlfriend!
Me!
Huh!
I'm seventy-four,..
I'll buy a drink.. for anyone who pisses farther than me!
# We rebels wave.. #
# the blood-stained flags. #
# We shall raise barricades.. #
# to obtain freedom. #
Say, is there a place where...?
Down the courtyard.
Athos Magnani.
Athos...
Magnani...
Hi there, rabbit!
Half each.
So?
They locked you in, huh?
Have you met my father, too?
But it is true that he was really identical?
Hey!
Open up!
Oh, you're here!
I couldn't find you!
I was worried.
Who did it?
Nobody.
See, tonight you've had a drink too many!
Who did it?
Oh, we're all friends, here!
Sure! All friends!
We're all friends here!
All friends!
All friends here!
Neath the setting sun the fair maiden leaves the fields,..
holding in her hand a bunch of roses and violets,..
to deck herself she is preparing,..
tomorrow, at the feast  day, her chest and hair.
Sitting with the neighbors on the stairs, the old woman spins,...
Where's your father?
- At the cemetery.
He was run over by a car on St. Martin's Day.
Your grandfather, I meant.
- In the yard, washing bottles.
Give me a pack of American cigarettes.
Nothing foreign.
You know the guy who came in my room this morning, huh?
Yes, the one who woke me up.
I don't know anybody!
We're all friends here.
I found the cigarettes!
But I smoke them without filter.
How do we do?
Here, here!
-What are you doing?
There, good! You smoke it, huh?
Here.
Bye, thanks.
It was MN the bike's plate of the man who came to your room this morning!
Do you know him?
No, but I know one with a similar bike.
With a MN plate?
Male or female?
With a Mantua plate?
With a CR plate.
Come here, let's see if it's male or female.
It's a male.
No, I say it's a female.
- It's a male. Look.
No, it's a female.
- Male, like you!
No, it's a female.
You were expecting me?
Yes.
What was my father like?
A jester,.. very much so.
This is daytime...
- False!
This is full daytime, and I'll prove it.
- You're crazy!
This is a town of madmen!
Madmen and old men!
And of old madmen!
Yesterday they locked me in a stable.
With a horse.
"But here, we're all friends"!
This morning, hardly awake, before coffee, a punch in the face.
"But here, we're all friends, you know?"
Since he died,
I've not been able to sleep.
An insomnia without dreams, without anything.
???Hundreds of  nights alert, like a hound dog.
The murderer is from here,
I've always known
Now we both know it!
He's scared!
He wants you to go!
All I know is that I was leaving this morning, and I'm still here.
So what, we're among friends.
Let's start with the enemies, who then, are almost all dead.
The only one left is the one who hated him the most.
Name is Beccaccia, the biggest landowner in the region.
???His enemies, the real ones, were three. three real friends...
A theatre owner, a teacher, and a culatelli taster.
All dead too?
Dead!
No, they're still there, all 3 of them:
Costa, Rasori and Gaibazzi
Draifa, I never heard it!
What name is it?
My lunatic father was a Dreyfus fan.
Dreyfus, so Draifa!
And this Beccaccia, where does he live?
Across the highway.
He doesn't live. He reigns!
Don't insist, go away,
The master won't see anyone.
Good morning!
Young man, where will you go with no ticket you can show?
Young man, where will you go with no ticket you can show?
Hey!
I'm Gaibazzi!
I'm Gaibazzi!
Your father's friend.
Don't you recognize me?
I'm Gaibazzi! Come here.
I'm your father's friend.
Cling on, we're going to eat.
Come on, let's eat!
This is the chamber.. of the uranium.
These are 37 - 38 culatello.
These peasants are tiresome, damn!
They never want to please you... do not...
There's this one, for instance...
- Are these prosciutti?
What prosciutti? They're culatelli!
The quintessence of prosciutto.
It's the rounded part, understand?
The name says it all.
This you see...
Excellent.
Smell.
Bad!
We were anti-Fascist, and..
and maybe we didn't even know what it meant.
We had no program at all.
We couldn't have any because... you'll see the other two. One.. has a drive-in, the other is an elementary teacher.
None of us is very bright.
There! Smell the sommé?
- Yes.
Ever happened to smell, for instance, opening a drawer and smell.. where mice have nested? That smell of mould, of wood shavings gnawed by mice?
I don't know if these belong to Negri.
But, they're always the best of all.
Because..
See, Negri is a man who offers water to geese when it rains. That is,..
As stingy as hell, but..
Smell. if there is some leftover soup, it's for the pig.
He might deny it to his wife, because he's for the pig. That's the man.
What was our anti-Fascism based on?
On...
We fancied conspiracies, the "Ernani"... or, "I congiurati", don't know, or.. or those two, Samuel and Tom,
"Un ballo in maschera"...
We saw ourselves as such characters, got it? But we understood nothing!
Your father did.
He was something else.
Your father was...very different.
Your father knew what he...
These...
He was enchanting! We listened to him speak, so cultured, well prepared,.. always documented.
I remember one night,.. he was playing cards at the café,..
They came and get him.
Took him out and beat him up.
Sickening!
You look extraordinarily like him!
It's as if I saw him! Just alike.
Besides being intelligent, he also paid in person.
But us, nothing! None of us paid in person. Understand? So...
It's obvious they knew very well that we weren't important!
Well, now we'll have a bite of offal.
- What?
A forkful of offal!
What's this offal?
- Tripe!
The tripe, you see, it is.. it's a dish that, if it's well done, it's delicious.
And...if it's badly done,.. it should be thrown in the cook's face.
He was always with us, because, although we are three beasts,..
then you'll see the other two,..
we were the only ones who tried to..
understand, that extraordinary man.
Not bad!
Huh?
Not bad!
The wine too.
A bit of wood taste.
A little flaw.
See, wine is like a man.
It can have flaws, and still be pleasing anyway.
Indeed, a little flaw, at times, but little, can even be good for it.
Here too, at the Festival, the musicians made the invitation.
Beautiful! On a belfry or on a tree, up high, like a bird, you know?
The clarinet, or the cornet, repeating, anticipating.. the motifs of the ball, polkas especially, and waltzes.
Your father always came, as well.
Once we went to the dance hall together.
He wore a belted jacket, sand-colored, English style.
And a red kerchief.
Blow of clarinet.
Let's start. Come on.
Mussolini is coming to inaugurate the theatre.
Mussolini's coming to inaugurate the theatre.
Did you hear? "Viva il duce!"
- Is he back? - Yes, yes!
Viva! Viva!
Your father!
What are you doing?
Eat!
Yes, but it is...
It's too much, and I already ate...
- Too much? Come on, what're you saying?
No, look, you must eat it!
Look, I'll be offended!
I've already eaten.
You must eat... You must eat!
You must eat.
And drink. Drink.
Come on, eat!
I locked them!
I must lock them away anytime that someone comes.
He had an extraordinary personality.
His death could not but correspond with his life.
An exceptional death, after an exceptional life.
I am glad.
You're Glad?
Have you gone crazy?
Even the Duce had to come, in this lousy town!
Let's see who'll be here!
I'm taking off! Give me air!
It's you the stupid, not to understand.. that it's the Cremona Fascists who made him come. To impress us!
It means they fear us!
Is it possible you can never grasp the dialectics of things?
Not so loud.
This town is full of spies!
On a public holiday, they had announced..
the arrival of Mussolini for the theatre inauguration.
Costa and I 
heard about it at Campo delle Piastre.
We must kill him!
Provided we can ensure our immunity!
We're more useful alive than dead.
We must make sure that it looks like the killer came from outside.
The day will come when we can tell the truth.
I want to be here that day.
I swear I will.
Remember,..
Fascism will continue.
Fascism is now ingrained in people.
That's why we must kill him.
But, you sure you've eaten?
No ceremony with me!
No, I'm sure, of course.
Yes, the idea of killing him, we had it all together.
We used to meet in a shack, actually, an old truck,.. abandoned on the embankment pathway.
Why do you look at me like that?
We were all there.
Athos, Gaibazzi, Rasori and me.
And then, there were the crickets,.. the cicadas,.. and mosquitoes, to keep us company.
In my opinion, a rifle.. won't do.
Of course! With all those guards!
Imagine!
It's suicide!
Lets suppose that someone gets in.
Lets suppose that he shoots, what then?
Then, he'd be killed in thirty seconds!
From a gallery, or from a box, he'd be found right away.
Then there will be more cockroaches in plainclothes than in uniform, you'll see!
I've thought about it all day.
There is a way.
Well, tell us then!
- On the stage.
We'll have him shot by...by Rigoletto!
What's that got to do?
On the stage there'll be no guards.
The rifle, we'll smuggle it amidst the singers' costumes.
Then, one of us gets hired as an extra, and...
What? Extra?
- Yes, extra,.. extra.
Behind the scenes, in the theater!
The theatre! How beautiful, at night, in the dark!
With that red lamp, with the sets on the stage.
They seem actors reciting, singing...
Then it's full of holes, corners, behind the curtain. No one sees you!
And the shot?
The shot? How is, the shot?
You're the expert.
We'll shoot during the "Maledizione".
There!
- "Maledizione"? Sorry, I...
At the end of the act, when Rigoletto sings..
# Ah! La maledizion... #
I don't understand quite.
When Rigoletto sings, at the end of the act: Ah, la maledizion!
Bang!
And the Duce is nice and dead!
Why do you look at me so?
It was so dark in there, we could hardly see each other.
None of us is such a good shooter to be sure to kill him in one shot.
I mean, mathematically sure.
- Morale?
Morale...
A slow fuse...
A detonator...
A stick of dynamite...
Midnight... applause...
Light the fuse...
What then?
And then, the Duce didn't come to Tara!
Why not?
Because...
Because a Fascist found the bomb in the shack and informed the police.
Only a miracle saved us!
They questioned us for hours, but had to release us for lack of evidence.
And so, everything came to nothing!
And Athos Magnani died instead of Mussolini.
What do you mean?
Let's suppose he was killed for vendetta...a political vendetta.
Let's suppose he was killed by Tara's Fascists.
No, impossible!
They're all cowards!
They used someone from outside.
OK, let's suppose it was a hired killer, who wasn't found then and won't be now.
It remains, anyhow,.. a quite impressive coincidence.
What coincidence?
My father was killed in the theatre, during "Rigoletto",.. the same way the Duce was supposed to be killed.
No one knew how Mussolini was to be killed.
No one!
No one but you three.
Four, in fact.
If it rains, the screen will be ruined.
Will you help me hoist it?
Come.
There is the rope.
Be careful, it costs me a fortune!
Only one thing is clear.
Whoever fired that shot, in that theatre, with that music,.. made a hero of Athos Magnani.
Yet, you looked at me with a strang grin.
This the way to Milan?
That way, by the theatre.
Milan must be after Mantua.
I did the military, there!
Listen.
Is that the theatre?
- That's where they killed Athos Magnani.
I was on my way to you.
Occasionally I have to come to town, to do some shopping.
I'll carry this.
The heat wave has begun today.
The real one, the one of the Po valley.
Give me your arm.
You've discovered something important, right?
Those three were expecting me.
Of course they were!
They'd be offended if you hadn't visited them. - No, no.
They had met before, and had agreed.
Agreed on what?
On what to tell me.
Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.
Sure, they prepared themselves.
Yet I'm sure they told the truth.
They spoke about the plot?
But if it's the truth, why come to an agreement?
What will you do now?
In this town,.. you decide to do something,.. and find out it has been foreseen by others.
What will I do now? Nothing. I'll wait.
- They trust you.
So they told you everything.
Only a few of us know.
What are you thinking?
- Nothing.
Of course you're thinking of something.
What was he like, more closely?
You have to hold it tighter.
- Like this?
Yes. And higher.
Come on, move that thing!
- But I'm moving it!
Harder, harder!
- You must help me!
Move those hands! Go on!
Stretch it, stretch it!
It's a bad strain, you know?
There!
Turn!
Wait.
- Put it like that.
Is it alright?
- Tighten it. - There.
That way.
- Let me turn, so it helps.
Turn, turn, turn!
Faster, faster!
Turn, turn!
Enough, I can't see.
Wait, I have to tie it now!
Your head is spinning?
Your head is spinning!
Who's best, me or your wife?
Take a photo, because it's the last time you'll see me.
I can't stand it any more.
I want a normal New Year's Eve.
Not at 11, because at midnight you must be with your wife.
I want to sleep with you, wake up with you.
I want to get bored with you, eat with you.
I feel mutilated.
I can't stand it this way,
I feel... mutilated.
As if...
As if I was missing an arm.
Athos, you're a coward.
You're hard on me, Draifa.
Things will change, you'll see.
Things will change.
Athos!
You look tired, sit down.
It might have been fear.
Or that he was behind my back, and I couldn't see his face.
But I realized it was all over.
Really.
It was the last time.
The last time I saw him alive.
Help me to get up.
You wanted to scare me, then!
Lady!
Lady?
Lady!
Lady?
Lady!
On the veranda! There's a chaise longue.
Stay there, I'm busy.
Go!
What are you doing, keeping an eye on me?
Well?
Drink it all, the lady said.
What would that be?
- A turtle-dove, by Jove!
A turtle-dove?
- Yeah!
It sounds like a train.
- But give me a break!
Doesn't It sound like a train?
Ready? Ready, ready!
Ready!
Look, now you make me do it wrong.
# If you don't know him, look at his face. #
# You see Agenore Beccaccia, grenades and caresses with dagger. #
Look at him!
Impassive!
Petrified.
Like a Fascist monument.
But you too will crumble, believe me.
And he's still tough with people!
Maybe a bit less now.
Hush...
-...the enemy is listening!
And the enemy,..
Yes, yes.. was me!
How right!
He was virile, he was!
- No! No!
His name was Bull.
He made himself call Bull.
Well, I would have liked to see!
To me, of the bull, he only had the horns!
Why does Draifa make us sit with him?
Look, he doesn't even budge!
He looks at us as he did back then!
Ask him if he remembers his share-cropper, Donino.
Who, during the blackout,..
crapped in an alley.
The cops arrived,..
"What have you done?"
Donino replied, in such a voice:
"What I've done is my own bounty, for the Duce and for the Party!"
Remember, huh?
No, he remembers nothing!
He doesn't like it.
- I bet he doesn't.
No, he never remembers anything.
I'm tired of looking at his face!
- I don't even look at him.
Come on, drink!
- Let's drink on it!
Let's drink on it!
Viva!
- Viva!
Viva what?
With such people in front?
Hurrah for us!
He won't drink, even! Wanna drink?
- He can't even say it!
You won't drink with us?
No, huh?
Enough, or I'll start crying.
And you make him cry too.
Well, let's drink on it again.
What a voice!
- Did you ever study? - Terrific!
I studied with Manzuolo.
With whom?
- Manzuolo... - What does it...
As a bullock, a young steer!
A lion.
You... you... me.
But you, a lion?
You, have never eaten one!
Remember? That escaped lion?
That circus...
Yes, a German circus!
A young lion, a beautiful...
He had a name...
Sultan!
- Yes!
They caught him, then. Perhaps because of the excitement, the poor thing.. died of a fever.
Look, Beccaccia,..
you'd better confess that you killed Athos Magnani.
And you gotta say it tonight, get it?
And now leave, go away!
Athos!
There.
- Thank you.
"In the tower, the stillness was already intense,"..
"The poplars of Rio Salto were whispering."
"The Norman horses,"..
"standing in their stalls crunched their oats."
"Over there stood the mare,"..
"wild, born among the pines of the briny shore,"..
"whose nostrils still held"..
"the spray,"..
- Continue.
"and in her sharp ears the yells."
"By her, an elbow on the manger, my mother said to her softly:"
''O little mare, little wild mare,"..
''you carried him, who won't return,''...
I almost forgot! Mr. Beccaccia was here.
He's expecting you right away!.
Where?
At the theatre. He wants to talk to you.
He said to hurry, before people return from the cemetery.
Why, they're all at the cemetery?
They say there's a sacrilege!
It's good to feel alive right where he died.
When he was alive, I couldn't stand your father, not even in photo.
Nor do I like seeing you around here.
With what they did to your father's grave, they're already saying it was me.
I leave the dead in peace.
Are you afraid I'll discover the truth of my father's death?
I'm living quietly here now, and I don't want to be talked about.
Last night my friends were only joking.
Next time they'll be serious, if you don't leave Tara immediately.
But I want to tell you something.
Unfortunately, it wasn't us who killed your father.
We didn't even have that satisfaction,.. unfortunately.
Come on, get in.
It was...a horrible sight, at the cemetery.
Now you know what sort of people they are.
Tell the truth...
You want to know the truth, don't you?
Let me out, I don't feel well.
- The truth...
The truth. Your father used to say that truth means nothing.
Listen, stop.
I feel sick.
What counts is the consequence of truth.
The truth is worthless!
Where are we going? Stop.
We want to talk to you, the three of us, quietly.
It was quiet at Draifa's house too!
Draifa...
The night Athos died,,.
Draifa was not in Tara.
- Stop.
Where she was,..
- I feel sick! no one knows!
I feel sick!
Stop!
Stop!
Where is the lady?
She's sleeping. I'll wake her up in half an hour. If you care to wait.
The lady cannot sleep at night.
Only in the morning she can.
Playing?
- I paint my nails. - I can see that!
What kind of a boy are you?
What's going on, who's there?
Lady, it's him! There's him! He's here!
OK, I understand, he's here.
Prepare the coffee, and almond cake.
Signora, he's climbing the stairs!
He's coming upstairs!
I hear you! All right, he's coming up!
Excuse me.
I'm leaving.
Couldn't you wait downstairs?
I'm sick of Rasori, Gaibazzi, Costa, of the whole Tara. You all lie, always!
You, for instance, were not in town the night of the murder!
I was in Mantua.
He had sent me there.
And that night they killed him!
Here! Happy now?
This morning they took me to the Po.
Costa, Rasori and Gaibazzi.
They frightened me.
I ran away.
Why?
You were right, you know?
The informer was not a Fascist.
The spy is one of them, all three of them!
My father discovered them and, out of fear, they killed him.
However, this story does not interest me anymore.
And neither you are interested!
I'm done, here.
- No. You can not leave yet.
I've a train at nine.
Our revenge will be more cruel, more atrocious.
Will be made up of glances, half-words.
We will create a void around them.
They'll know hell on earth!
Lady, listen.
You must begin to forget, now.
You haven't understood a thing.
You haven't understood a thing.
You can't go away any more!
You can't.
Come, come.
I...I need someone to help me.
Alone, I can't manage.
To look after my properties,.. to spend all this money.
I figured it out already. I have a young niece, very young, 19 years old,..
Really a beautiful girl.
Shee needs to work.
We could keep her here with us.
Athos, we'll be happy.
Athos...
Give me the key, lady.
You're back now, and you can't go away.
Bye Athos!
- Bye!
She was a foreign gypsy, from Naples, or around there.
In the darkness she said, and in darkness he died.
It's in the darkness of the theatre that they shot him.
The motorcyclist, was dressed in black.
Athos took the letter and put it in his pocket.
They found it unopened.
It read: ''If you enter the theatre, you will die.''
You did it!
Or you, or you!
He didn't even turn around, and was shot in the back.
He didn't turn because he knew well the man he saw in the mirror.
One of you!
It's true.
We killed him.
But all the staging, the gypsy, the motorcyclist, the letter?
He should have understood, suspected.
Why did he let himself be killed like that?
It all seems fake.
He had agreed with you!
Yes!
We had agreed.
It's him, who wanted to be killed.
Because... he had betrayed.
Why did you do it?
You told on to the Fascists, huh?
No.
To the cops.
You went to their station?
- No.
Then, where did you meet them?
I didn't meet them
I made an anonymous phone call.
Why did you become a spy?
Spy! Spy! Spy! Spy!
Tell us!
Tell us what you told them!
I told them.. behind the embankment road, there's a shack.
Look around,.. search,.. you'll find a bomb.
All I ask, is to take me to a high place.
I want to see Tara from above.
I feel like my legs are boneless today.
Listen...
For Tara, for the entire region,.. my name has a sound of rebellion, courage.
If they get to know.. of my betrayal,.. all our work will become useless, understand?
You won't be you who'll kill me.
A traitor can damage even when dead.
What is more useful is.. a hero!
A hero, sure!...
Whom people can love.
I shall be murdered by a Fascist.
Cowardly.
We'll offer the spectacle of a dramatic death,.. which might carve in the popular imagination,.. so that they continue to hate, hate, hate, more and more!..
Fascism.
It will be a hero's legendary death!
A great theatrical spectacle!
We will rehearse!
We will rehearse as at the theatre.
A cast of hundreds.
The whole town of Tara will participate, without knowing it.
The whole Tara.. will become a great theatre.
There wasn't much time.
The show that we prepared, the details, the words he uttered,.. have become legend.
And still endure.
At times, we even had to improvise.
Athos drew... he drew from books he had read.
Like, the story of the gypsy, for example.
He drew it from the witches of "Macbeth".
He got the idea of the letter from "Julius Caesar".
The warning of death, the motorcyclist in black...
It was a cousin of mine, one from Cremona.
Yeah!
He had planned everything!
Not everything.
Then you came, and discovered the truth.
That means the mechanism was not perfect.
True.
It wasn't perfect!
Unless...
Unless what?
Right!
After so many years, someone discovers the truth,.. and feels like shouting it, like writing it on walls.
But this someone.. is forced to keep secret.. what he discoved.
Because he realizes that he is part of the plot of Athos Magnani.
And that's where
Athos Magnani was wrong!
But which was the plot of Athos Magnani?
The mayor told me I had to be present.
I have come.
I am here.
I wish I weren't here.
We have to uncover the monument to my father,.. to speak about him, and his death.
I'm his son, his only son.
Really identical.
Who is, Athos Magnani?
A traitor, or a hero?
I wish my name weren't Athos Magnani.
This name has... a meaning, a sound.. of rebellion,.. of courage, and...
What was the real plot of Athos Magnani?
"Young man, where will you go with no ticket you can show?"
The ticket...I just.. haven't got one!
An assassination...
The assassins...
An assassination destined to fail from the outset.
Costa, Rasori, Gaibazzi,.. my father's friends.
His loyal comrades.
They aided him in the struggle,.. close to him to the end.
A traitor.
Athos, you're a coward.
You're hard on me, Draifa.
What reason had he to betray?
You won't be you who'll kill me.
A traitor can damage even when dead.
What is more useful is.. a hero.
A hero, sure!...
Whom people can love.
I shall be murdered by a Fascist.
Cowardly.
We'll offer the spectacle of a dramatic death,..
which might carve in the popular imagination,..
so that they continue to hate, hate, hate, more and more!..
Fascism.
There's a.. a phrase that...
"A man"..
"is made of all men."
"He is worth as much as all of them, and all are worth as much as him."
I forgot my suitcase at the station!
The train to Parma will be twenty minutes late.
The train to Parma will be thirty-five minutes late.
You got today's papers?
They haven't arrived.
It happens.
Sometimes they even forget we exist.
Who is it?
What'd you have to kill him for?
Shut up.
Now that the school year's coming to a close, many of you will be going forth to prove how cleverly you can run the world.
More power to you as you take your turn in the barrel.
Some of you will continue with your education.
Some of you, I hope, will continue with your interest in art.
Some of you will have other interests, other talents.
If we've learned nothing else this year,
I hope you've learned the stupidity of the statement that art belongs to the world.
'Cause art belongs to the cultured who can appreciate it.
The majority of the great unwashed does not fit into this category.
And neither, I'm sorry to say, do most of you.
Dr. Hemlock.
I just wanted to tell you how much
I really enjoyed your course.
I've never felt this close to art before.
How nice.
But I have a problem.
How terrible.
Well, you see, if I don't keep my B average, I'm gonna lose my scholarship, and I really don't think I'm gonna do so well in your final exam.
I mean, I've gained a whole new feeling about art, but sometimes you can't always put your true feelings down on paper.
How true.
If there was anything I could do to get a better grade...
I mean, I'd be willing to do anything.
Anything at all. Really.
Do you realize the implications of that offer?
Are you busy this evening?
No.
You live alone?
Oh, well, my roommate's gone for the week.
Good.
Then, go on home, break out the books and study your little ass off.
That's the best way to maintain a B average.
Oh, uh... Don't study it all off.
Why didn't you boff the little quiff?
'Cause I don't pick on students or drunks.
Get your feet off my desk.
Mr. Dragon wants to see you.
I'm sorry, Pope, but working for you people no longer amuses me.
C-2 isn't too interested in what amuses you, pal.
That's odd, being as your organization has spent so much time and effort in trying to give the rest of the world a laugh.
You can remind Dragon that I'm retired.
You still here?
Now really, you don't expect me to just walk out that door, do you, sweetheart?
Either through the door or through the window. It's your choice.
Now look, pal...
Get your feet off my desk!
Now look here, buddy...
Don't call me "buddy,"
"pal," or "sweetheart."
If I wasn't under orders,
I would...
My superior wants to see you.
Your superior? Well, that doesn't narrow the field much, does it?
Mr. Dragon wants to see you, and right away, pal.
I told you not to call me "pal."
Mr. Dragon's not gonna like this.
How long have you worked for Dragon, Pope?
Twelve years. Why?
Then he's used to having grief in his life.
You can tell him I'm retired. C-2's gonna have to live without me.
Don't forget your trench coat.
How's anybody gonna recognize you without your disguise?
Yes, Dragon.
Ah, Hemlock!
I knew you'd show up.
It's just your charm, Pope.
I couldn't resist.
Hold it.
Empty your pockets, right there.
No wallet?
Well, I knew I'd be seeing you. I thought I'd best leave it home.
Miss Cerberus, you're looking inviting today.
I expected you before this.
Mr. Dragon does not like to be kept waiting.
Oh, the impatient albino!
I don't think
Mr. Dragon's affliction is a joking matter.
I thought it was rather humorous, myself.
A spy network being run by a bloodless freak who can't stand light or cold.
Or germs! Are you healthy?
Shall I turn my head and cough?
No known infections?
Nothing other than the usual.
Syphilis, running sores, and clap.
All right, go in.
Come in, Hemlock.
A little to the left, Hemlock.
I'll turn on a light.
Thanks. Could you spare it?
You know, I'm something of a distinction.
A total albino.
Even the slightest direct light causes me intense pain.
Does your physical disability preclude you from coming to the point?
All right. If you wish no small talk, sit down.
We'll discuss business.
One of our agents has been killed in Zurich by two men.
We want you to sanction them.
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to get somebody else to do your wet work.
Please, that is a distasteful phrase.
Call it what you want,
"wet work," "termination,"
"sanction."
It all adds up to the same thing, killing.
It is what you do best.
You don't seem to remember, Dragon,
I'm a retired assassin.
The operative word there is "retired."
You'll have to get somebody else to do your sanctions.
I understand a new Pissarro has come onto the black market.
I'll just have to live without it.
Your fascination with paintings has always amazed me.
You have how many now?
- Twenty-one.
- Marvelous!
I should think your collection would be interesting material for the Internal Revenue people.
How does an underpaid professor buy rare paintings?
Masterpieces worth millions?
A professor with a balance of $2,137 in his checking account?
You forgot the 42 cents.
I wonder what the tax people would say if I told them how I made the money, by killing people for the government.
True. True. But, of course, no one will believe you.
And even more important, it won't do anything for your paintings.
What do you think would happen to them?
I imagine they'd be seized and auctioned off, made available to everyone.
Perhaps Mr. Pope would be able to buy one.
Won't it do your heart good to think of one of your precious paintings in Mr. Pope's hands?
Dragon, you have a talent for describing the indescribable.
There are two assailants.
Our search division has located only one of these men in Zurich.
C-2 is working on the second one, and I would hope that they will have identified him by the time you arrive in Zurich.
We have reason to believe that the Zurich man is responsible for the assassination of several of our agents in a most savage manner.
I'll take one sanction. Only one.
All right.
We shall talk about the second sanction when the time comes.
The price'll be $20,000.
Twice your usual fee? Absurd!
You want the sanction performed, you pay $20,000.
You are without conscience.
How true.
Which brings me to another small fee
I want to get for this job.
Which is?
I'd like a statement from the Internal Revenue Service listing my collection of paintings.
I'd like it to say that the IRS has examined my collection, and that the IRS is fully aware of the circumstances under which I obtained them, and that my ownership is legal and without tax liability.
You drive a hard bargain.
You want somebody sanctioned.
I want a piece of paper.
All right.
You'll have the IRS statement this evening.
Here is the cash.
I hate being predictable.
You are never that, Hemlock.
Who is there?
A delivery.
I have this box of dental floss for Dr. Millard, but he doesn't answer his door.
He's off today.
What'll I do with this box of floss?
I don't give a shit what you do with it, buddy.
Well, you don't have to be violent about it.
Get lost, cupcake.
Look out!
Crap?
I beg your pardon?
You did start this conversation by saying "crap," didn't you?
No, I didn't say it. I asked it.
Is this today's alternative to, "Coffee, tea, or milk?"
Only on our competitor's lines.
Actually, I was looking over your shoulder and I saw your comment, so I asked.
Just some criticism of this book I'm reviewing.
All and all, it's a very shabby piece of research obscured by involuted style.
Shabby research I can stand, but involuted style really makes my ass drag.
I can't believe that you're a stewardess.
Actually, I'm not.
I'm a skyjacker in drag.
That's reassuring.
Now if you'll just give me your name,
I'll report it to the proper authorities when we land.
Jemima.
And I'm Uncle Ben.
I'm serious. That's really my name.
Jemima Brown. My mother was hooked on being ethnic.
Or else turned on by a pancake.
As long as we both agree that it's too much for a black chick to have the name of Jemima.
Oh, I don't know. I mean, people don't forget you when your name is Jemima.
I don't think people would forget you if your name was Alfred.
Goodness me, Dr. Hemlock.
You're not the type of man who tries to pick up stewardesses, are you?
Not generally.
How'd you know my name?
It's this mystical thing
I have with names.
It's a gift from the Dark Continent.
I look at a person very carefully, and then I concentrate.
And?
And then, I go check his name out on the passengers list.
And what else do they call you besides Jemima and Smart Ass?
Jem, as in jewel.
Fasten your seat belt, sir.
Oh, I have no intention of trying to escape.
Aren't you gonna get in, or do you like it out there?
I looked for you on the plane.
No harm done.
I was on my way to town and you looked so lonely,
I took pity on you.
Well, that's an ancient trick.
Whenever I'm waiting for a cab,
I look lonely and maybe some unbelievable beauty named Jemima will pick me up.
Gonna have to be a double fare, you know?
Fine.
You know, buddy, we ain't supposed to pick up two fares in one location.
Hey. Let's agree on a division of labor right now. You do the driving.
We'll do the talking.
All right.
How can you look so good when you're starving to death?
Am I starving to death?
Mmm, you broil a mean steak, Hemlock.
Come on, I'll show you my lime pit.
It's kind of scary looking.
Maybe I should drop pieces of bread so I can find my way out.
Jonathan!
They're unbelievable.
Not bad, huh?
One of the better collections in the neighborhood.
You have El Greco down there,
Matisse,
Picasso,
Clay, Matisse.
Over here we have Pissarro.
It's astonishing! I mean, there's so much life in them.
Yeah, I'm picking up another one of his tomorrow.
I've heard about guys like you reading those books.
Whips and boots and things.
But an ax? That's a little freaky.
Call me a cab.
I'm getting outta here.
Just some old climbing equipment.
You climb?
I used to, but I'm retired now.
Maybe you'll climb again someday.
I doubt it.
However, you never know.
Sometimes people do things they thought they'd never do again.
Like rape, for instance.
Yeah. I thought I'd given up rape, but I think I've changed my mind.
You really have beautiful eyes.
Or do they all say that?
All?
Who all?
Yeah.
Good morning, baby.
There's coffee by your bed.
The hell with coffee.
Where are you?
Jonathan, it's important that you contact Mr. Dragon as soon as possible.
I'm sorry to drop it on you like that, Jonathan.
Baby, I'm sorry.
Sorry for this, Hemlock.
But twice a year, my blood must be fully replaced.
With what?
You're very bitter today, Dr. Hemlock.
A joke. Bitter Hemlock.
Listen, Dragon. I came here for two reasons.
One, to tell you that using that Jemima Brown to steal my money was low, even for you.
And second, to get my money and tax statement back.
It will be returned to you.
- And the tax statement?
- That, too.
Well, then we have nothing more to discuss, do we?
There is still the sanction on the second man who killed Agent Wormwood.
I will give you another $20,000 for this second sanction.
Forget it. I'm back in retirement.
You are the only man who can do it.
You could train Pope. He'd be ready, in about 40 years.
Would you leave Agent
Wormwood unrevenged?
Well, those are the breaks.
Did you know who Agent
Wormwood was, Dr. Hemlock?
Wormwood was Henri Baq.
Henri Baq?
Yes.
I thought he was retired and living in Paris.
He approached C-2 and asked for work.
Apparently, he had financial difficulties.
We tried to be helpful.
Unfortunately, it turned out tragically.
Why wasn't I told about this before?
We had reasons.
They did not concern you.
We preferred that you took the sanction for your usual reasons, greed and avarice.
- Henri Baq was my friend.
- Yes.
He saved my life once.
Yes.
Then why am I the only one who can perform this sanction?
First, do you accept the assignment?
Yes, I accept.
What we have is this.
The target is male.
He is an accomplished mountain climber.
We learned this from a note we intercepted.
Also, a witness said he limped.
Well, that's fine.
Now all I have to do is kill every mountain climber with a sore foot.
Not quite.
Our man will be involved in a climb in the Alps this summer.
You're getting warm now, Dragon.
That narrows it down to three or four thousand men.
Fewer than that.
We know which mountain he will climb.
And?
The Eiger.
North face, of course.
That is correct.
You are familiar with it?
You know I am.
I tried to climb it twice.
It tried to kill me twice.
Look, if the target's trying to climb the north face of the Eiger, chances are my work could be done for me.
I cannot trust to chance, Dr. Hemlock.
Now, the only climb planned for the Eiger is a goodwill climb with a team from Germany, Austria,
France and the United States.
Now, the target is one of the other climbers, the Frenchman, the German or the Austrian.
We are continuing to work to try to identify him.
Undoubtedly, we will have his name before it is necessary for you to climb the Eiger.
You're passing over one small matter, and that is payment.
Naturally, considering the rigors of the assignment, we intend to be generous.
You will receive $30,000.
I'm sure that's more than you expected.
More than I expected, but less than I'll receive.
Oh?
Yeah. I'll receive $100,000, plus expenses, of course.
You recognize that this is outrageous?
Well, I'm viewing this as retirement pay.
This is definitely my last assignment.
You are punishing us for using
Jemima Brown? Is that it?
You need me to perform the sanction, just pay the money.
You drive a hard bargain, Hemlock, but to show you there are no hard feelings,
I'm going to give you a bonus.
Oh, pardon me while I choke.
You will appreciate this.
The bonus is Miles Mellough.
Miles? What does he have to do with all this?
It appears that after the microfilm was stolen from Worm...
Henri Baq, Miles Mellough was the courier who carried it to the enemy.
Since he was not one of the killers, a sanction, technically, is not called for.
However, you may have it if you wish.
I accept the bonus.
I thought you might.
I imagine this will be the last time that you will be here.
I shall miss you, Hemlock.
You know, Dragon, you could have saved yourself a lot of trouble if you'd have told me to begin with that the dead agent in
Zurich was Henri Baq.
Good luck, Hemlock, on your latest assignment, the Eiger Sanction.
Wild Turkey on the rocks, hmm?
It's right downstairs.
I guess I shouldn't have dropped it on you like that, Jonathan.
Just how should you have dropped it on me, Jemima?
I just couldn't let it go...
I mean, I couldn't let us go on without you knowing that I work for Mr. Dragon.
And I didn't have enough guts to tell you face-to-face.
Boy, I must've been really dazzled not to notice all those coincidences.
You on the same plane, just happening by with the taxi cab, discovering the note from Dragon.
How was it supposed to work?
Were you supposed to deny me your body if I don't accept this sanction?
Don't make it sound so cheap, Jonathan.
Just too shabby to even be called cheap.
For your information,
I was not assigned to seduce you.
How long have you worked for Dragon?
Only a month.
But I've been a C-2 courier for five years.
Jonathan, do you understand how important this sanction is?
I mean, the film that was stolen from Wormwood...
His name was Henri Baq.
Well, the stolen microfilm involves a new formula for germ warfare.
And I'm supposed to get it back by killing people?
Let me tell you something I'm sure you're not aware of, Aunt Jemima.
You know what purpose these sanctions serve? Absolutely none at all.
They're just retaliation. They kill one of ours, we kill the killers.
No purpose at all, just barbaric.
You're getting religion a little late.
I didn't quit because of religion.
I quit because of mathematics.
Oh?
That's right.
The odds are stacking up against me.
Assassins who stay too long wind up assassinated, and that ain't in my game plan.
But...
Look, I don't pretend to know what Mr. Dragon's thinking, but there's a formula for germ warfare out there and the other side has it.
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
It's dangerous, child, to come to conclusions when you don't have any facts.
Now, let me lay some on you.
Sure, Dragon knows what he's doing, just like he knew what he was doing when he worked for the
Nazis during World War II.
- What?
- Oh, you didn't know that, did you?
Yes, your wrap 'em up in red, white, and blue Mr. Dragon's a goddamn Hessian, that's what he is.
And he'd sell out the other side as fast as he'd sell out our side.
He'd sell out his mother, too, if the bloodless freak had one!
You think it's so awful the other side has a germ formula?
It's against the
Geneva Convention, isn't it?
And they stole it from us.
Well, what the hell are we doing with it in the first place?
We're not supposed to have one either.
And you don't see any difference between their side and our side?
Yeah, I see a difference. As long as we have Dragons and Popes working for us, how bad can the other side be?
Where's my change?
This is Henri Baq.
I had a bullet in me once, and he carried me for three days.
I owe him one. He was a friend.
Who's that man?
That's Miles Mellough.
He's the guy who tipped off the people who put the bullet in me.
An enemy.
And him?
That's Ben Bowman. He and I used to climb a lot together.
I'm going out to his climbing school and get in shape.
Friends, enemies.
Where do I fit in?
I'm sorry, but you don't.
Here's to the selfish killer and the patriotic whore.
Do you have anything else to say to me?
I usually keep a twenty in the bowl there, by the kitchen door.
You might pick it up on your way out.
Goddamn my eyes!
How the hell are you?
Goddamn, you're looking good.
A little soft maybe, but, goddamn, I'm glad to see you.
How the hell have you been? Boy, are we gonna drink a lot of beer!
Wait till you see the goddamn place. How the hell are you?
Jesus Christ, Jon, don't you ever say anything?
Well, I'm waiting for your mouth to get tired.
Just down the road a piece, old buddy.
About 20 miles, as I remember.
Uh-huh.
Nice leisurely five-minute ride.
Only when I'm in a hurry.
No need to hurry, Ben.
That's why I'm taking it nice and easy.
You ain't gonna recognize the old place.
Hope I live to see it.
That city life has spoiled you, made you kind of soft.
You ain't a pansy yet, are you?
Let's just stop this death trap and I'll show you.
What's so funny?
I was just thinking of the last time we climbed.
You had to haul my ass down off that mountain.
That's liable to turn out to be one of my bigger mistakes.
Still do any climbing, Ben?
No. Nothing a pissant couldn't hop over.
I ain't a climber, anyway.
I'm an impresario.
- Huh?
- An impresario.
At least, that's what they call me. That ain't dirty, is it?
Could be.
When did this all happen?
Oh, about two years.
What do you think of it?
- Well...
- I know. It's so frigging ugly, it makes me sick.
But it keeps me in moccasins.
I've been taken over by the swinging singles!
What happened to the climbing school?
Ha!
My guests are more interested in hunting than they are in climbing.
Thought the whole point of climbing was hunting.
Damned if you ain't right, Jon.
Damned if you ain't right.
Well, this is really interesting, Ben.
Uh-huh, yeah.
Begins to look like I'll make it through the winter, huh?
Two brews.
Not bad.
Thanks. Not bad at all.
I think I like the old place better though. More character.
Character and unpaid bills, old buddy.
Goddamn, I'm glad to see you!
Dealing with these phony bastards really makes my ass weary.
That's the perils of being an impresario.
You sure that ain't a dirty word?
Shut up and drink your beer.
On, God. My, my!
All right. Beat it, Buns.
At least I know you're not here for the hunting.
Psst! Psst!
But your wire made it sound like more than just a visit to an old buddy.
It is, Ben. I want you to get me in shape for a climb.
Much of a climb?
Eiger, north face.
You're kidding?
Nope, I'm part of an international team.
I know about that international climb.
Lawrence Scott heads the U.S. team.
He had an accident.
How old are you, Jon? Thirty-five?
- Give or take.
- Uh-huh.
I know what you're thinking,
Ben, but I have to go.
You've been to the Eiger before.
- Twice.
- And you know what it's like.
Ben, I'm going, God damn it.
All right. All right. I did what a good friend's supposed to do.
I tried to talk you out of it, right?
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Horseshit! I'm going with you!
You, going to the Eiger?
I'm the ground man for that climb.
Ain't that enough to singe your ass!
I'm gonna nursemaid you again after all of these years.
You nursemaid me?
I not only could out-climb you on your best day,
I can out-drink you right now.
Well, you just enjoy that one,
'cause you're off the sauce until you're in shape for the climb.
Meanwhile, I'll have another.
Well, this is where I turn back.
- Thank God.
- Not you. You need the work.
George there will take you on up.
She's a girl.
A lot of people notice that.
All right, George. Give him a workout, then bring him back for a meal.
I'll see you, old buddy.
You don't have to do everything he says.
After all, this is a chance to strike back at the white man.
Hi. I'd like some
French Onion Soup, crabmeat cocktail, broiled lobster tails, and Wild Turkey on the rocks, please.
Very good, sir.
Well, that was quick.
Well, what do you think of George?
Very warm, humane person.
Gives great conversation, too.
But she's a climbing fool, ain't she?
Boy, that she is.
Wore me down, but
I'll do better tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Today, me bucko.
You go back out again right after lunch.
You'd be well-advised to have a good reason for making this call.
Rise and shine, old buddy.
Oh. Go piss up a rope.
Just scalp me.
God damn it! I wish
Custer would have won.
Time to rise and shine...
Screw Marlon Brando.
Dirty, rotten...
Dirty, evil, scheming, devious bitch.
Leave Dr. Hemlock alone, Faggot.
Forgive him, Jonathan, but I'm afraid Faggot has not learned to recognize you straights.
Miles.
My, my, aren't we looking splendid, Jonathan?
How long has it been?
Indochina, you and me and Henri Baq.
And I haven't made a verbal blunder.
Actually, it's about Henri that I wish to chat.
Miles, the only thing you and I have to chat about is you having an incurable disease and lack the guts to kill yourself.
Very good, Jonathan. Very good.
You've grown a great deal.
But wrong!
Should we be sensible and have a drink?
Waiter!
We'd like to order some drinks, please.
A Wild Turkey on the rocks for my good friend, the doctor.
And I would like...
I would like a frozen daiquiri.
Well... Miss?
Oh, Miss. May I know your name, please?
Buns.
Yes, of course it is.
Miss Buns, I wonder if you'd be a gentleperson and take my roomie for a stroll?
Sure, anything.
I'm sure. Off you go.
His name is Faggot.
That's cute.
Be careful he doesn't rape you. Charming.
Ah, here we are.
Well, you're a very handsome young man.
I would say he's made, wouldn't you, Jonathan?
I assume you're covered.
Uh-huh. Your assumption is correct.
At the bar.
That's your cover?
Uh-huh. Dewayne is very strong.
He was a world's champion.
Weren't they all?
Must seem odd to you that I've looked you up after all these years.
But you see, Jonathan, I'm...
I've grown very tired of waiting for you to step up behind me one day and relieve me of existing.
Stepping up behind is your method, Miles.
I wanna look right into your face.
Yes, I'm sure you would.
However, that does not enhance my cool.
It'll all be over soon.
Funnily enough, I find myself in a very strong bargaining position.
Forget it.
Not even curious?
You betrayed the both of us in Asia and we lived, no thanks to you.
Now you people have killed Henri in Zurich.
I didn't actually kill him, you know.
Well, I probably won't actually kill you.
That's very little comfort.
Henri was a worthless alcoholic, and I abhor sloppy drunks.
I'll allow you that.
It's the price I must pay to get you to listen.
I did not, I repeat, I did not participate in that killing.
Because unlike you,
I am not an animal.
But I do know who did the killing.
You got one, and now you're after the other.
Dragon has promised you the identity of this person.
Maybe. Maybe not.
The point, I know who this person is.
And until you get that information, you're in great, great danger.
How?
Suppose I were to tell this person who and what you are?
He would hunt you.
You'd sell this man out for me?
For what I want in this life,
I would even sell my dear mother.
How true.
What I need from you is your promise to leave me alone.
What do you say?
All right. I'll give you my answer in a minute.
Whichever way it goes, we were friends once.
As you can see, Miles and I have made up.
Can I buy you a drink?
Get him whatever he's having.
I'm sure glad, too.
I'd hate to tangle with a guy your size.
Just want you to know.
Now I'm gonna tell you something.
And listen, 'cause I'm gonna ask questions later.
I don't like you on my flank 'cause it scares me.
I don't like being scared.
If you ever come near me again, I'm gonna kill you.
Understand? Understand?
Yes.
Good boy.
Hope you told your cook we'd be back for lunch.
You're full of piss and vinegar today.
You promise to have mercy on an old man like me?
You wanna lead? You've been up this before.
No, I'll just tag along.
This the right way?
It's one way, I guess.
You're a big help.
I wanna know why you busted that guy's head at the pool.
Rock.
All right, it's none of my fucking business.
You know what?
Way down deep, you got the makings of a real bad ass.
I don't know that I'd like to be alone on a desert island with you if there was a shortage of food.
Don't worry. You're a friend.
You ever had any enemies?
A few.
Any of them still around?
The guy by the pool.
Miles Mellough. What do you know about him?
He checked in today.
He looks like he could change a nine dollar bill in threes.
Want me to throw him out?
No, I want him right here.
What about the other guy?
The big guy? You want him, too?
Him, too.
You set him up kind of neat for an elderly college professor.
You got me in shape.
It's not that.
You set him up like you were used to setting people up.
You're climbing fine, Jon.
Better than I've ever seen you.
Well, I wish I was on the Eiger right now, I'll tell you.
Why go at all, Jon? Isn't this enough of a climb?
No way.
I've gotta make it.
Hey, have you ever met any of these guys we're climbing with?
Yeah, about a month ago.
And?
They're a good enough bunch.
They've got a lot of hills behind them.
Any of 'em walk with a limp?
Now, who in the hell could climb with a limp? Now, wait a minute.
The German was limping. Said he hurt himself in a fall.
Freytag, he's a funny guy.
Makes noise like a leader.
Family makes bug spray.
Got a lot of money, but he doesn't like to talk about it.
Anyway, he's got the look.
What look?
The look of a guy you couldn't count on in a clutch.
I wouldn't want to count on him on that hill.
- What about the Frenchman, Montaigne?
- Oh, Montaigne's all right.
I think he's a little too old for the Eiger. He's about your age.
- Screw off, will you?
- I'd rather screw Montaigne's wife.
She's a real brick shit-house.
Wait'll you catch her act.
She's a regular mantrap.
I feel sorry for the poor bastard, trying to keep his eyes on her.
Yeah? And what about the Austrian?
Oh, you're gonna love him, Jon.
Meyer doesn't give a rat's ass about anything except climbing.
All the people I talk to say he's the kind of climber like...
Well, like you used to be.
You mean, before I got decrepit and weak?
You didn't look so decrepit and weak yesterday, punching out that wrestler.
Anyway, this Meyer's really something. He killed a guy once.
Oh?
Yeah. A porter on a climb they were making was stealing some food.
He killed him with a knife.
Isn't that something?
Sounds like a real charmer.
Listen, Jon, if you got to rope yourself to anybody on that hill, you make damn sure it's Meyer.
This is a big man. You're the only one who's climbed it.
Uh-huh.
How'd you do it?
Guts, skill, determination, all that sort of stuff.
Hey, why don't we just call it a climb the way it is and take the escalator down?
Okay, give me some slack.
You gonna stand up there all day admiring yourself?
Or are you gonna bring me up?
All right.
Congratulations, old buddy.
You got her cherry.
What do you mean?
You're the first one ever to climb up here.
Well, you climbed it yourself, you told me.
You ain't gonna get very far in life listening to a liar like me.
You were hoping
I'd quit, weren't you?
Hoping I'd give up on the Eiger climb.
Let me tell you something, Ben.
There's a damn good chance I might not have to make the climb.
I may be able to conclude my business before the climb starts.
No.
Once you get over there, you're gonna want to climb. That's the way you are.
Want a beer?
You gonna call room service?
We got beer.
If you hauled beer up this rock, you're insane.
I may be insane, but I'm not stupid.
I didn't carry it, you did.
It's in your pack.
Jesus Christ! I ought to throw you off this pillar.
Besides, it's warm.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'd thought you'd draw the line at hauling ice.
Oh.
Well, good evening, George.
"Good evening, Dr. Hemlock."
And how are you this fine evening?
"Oh, I'm just fine, Doctor."
Did you watch that magnificent climb Ben and I made today?
"Yes, I did, Dr. Hemlock.
"It sure was good."
You know, George, I'm gonna be leaving here soon, and I'm gonna kind of miss you, in my way.
"I'll miss you, too, Doctor."
Um, one thing I'll have to say, George, is you've never cluttered up our relationship with any sticky sentiment.
Maybe we should just cut the chitchat and you just jump in here and we'll get lucky.
Ow!
Desk! Desk!
No.
All right, now, take it easy.
Take it easy, old buddy.
Ow.
Doc says you're gonna be all right, but you just got to take it slow.
Where is she?
I got her down in my room.
My men are watching her.
Want me to call the sheriff?
No, not yet.
- What happened to me.
- Miles Mellough. I knew you'd be wondering.
He's still here. The desk'll call me if he makes a move.
So it was Miles.
That's what she said.
Why'd she do it?
Oldest reason in the world.
Love?
Money.
What the hell did she shoot into me, anyway?
The doc says it was a relative of morphine, but not enough to be fatal.
You know, morphine sounds right.
Miles is in the drug business.
Why the hell didn't he polish you off?
He told her it was gonna be nothing serious.
He just wanted to scare you.
After George put me under, my guess is,
Miles was gonna come in and off me in some spectacular fashion.
Probably give me an O.D.
That sounds like his style.
What are you gonna do about him?
Something massive.
Something massive!
Good morning, Dewayne.
Well, good morning, Jonathan.
My, aren't we looking chipper today?
Sleep well?
Very well, thank you.
You know, Miles, I think I'll forget about you for the time being.
Difficult task. Just like that?
Well, you see, I'm gonna be training here for a few more weeks, and I'm gonna need all my concentration without having you in mind.
Well, I do sympathize with you.
Truly, I do, Jonathan.
But if this means you're going to cross me off your list for good...
I might just do that.
I'll tell you something. Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Only if I can choose the wine.
Look forward to it.
Bastard!
He hit his brakes.
No, he didn't.
He turned the switch on his headlights.
Oh, Jonathan, what a cheap, dirty trick.
After him, Dewayne. After him!
We've got him now. Look!
We've got him trapped. He can't turn around on this road.
Where the hell is he?
Dewayne, there he is!
Oh, Jonathan, you are an animal.
Look at that dear gentleman.
You tried to kill me.
Get in the car.
Uh-uh.
Get in the car.
Get out.
What the hell are we gonna do out here?
Get out.
Jonathan, you're not going to shoot...
Jonathan, you're not going leave me out here!
Jon...
Oh, Jonathan, for Christ's sakes, kill me, but don't leave me here!
You can't...
Pretty quiet now, aren't you, you little prick?
Jonathan!
Goddamn my ass, what the hell do you mean, you ain't got any rooms for me?
My dear Herr Bowman...
My dear Herr's ass.
You just stick your nose in that book and you come up with my reservation.
Hiya, buddy. You're looking good.
What's the problem here?
Oh, this rinky-dink has screwed up my reservation. Says he can't find my telegram.
From the looks of him, he couldn't find his tallywhacker with a six-man search party.
I did not know this person was a friend of yours, Dr. Hemlock.
Yeah, well, he's in charge of the climb.
In charge of the climb? Oh, yes.
Just one minute, please.
All the Eiger birds are coming in.
Maybe you should have given him a tip.
Yeah. Did you meet the other climbers yet?
They're supposed to be here in the hotel. How's George?
She's fine.
Listen, about Miles...
Look, later on that.
Everything is in order.
You will be with the other members of the party on the 2nd floor.
Room 216. I'll have your luggage taken up.
Yeah, and have them send up a case of beer.
You know, after you left, all hell broke loose.
Government agents all over the place, asking questions, making assholes of themselves.
They find anything?
Yeah, you know that big guy you creamed in the bar?
Found him blown in half with a shotgun.
Miles, they found on the sand, dead as Kelsey's nuts.
What the hell are you here for?
I don't want you to concern yourself with that, Ben.
I'm just here doing something for an old friend.
Let's call off the climb. Tell them you're sick or something.
You know I want another shot at this hill.
Herr Bowman?
Yeah?
Karl Freytag wants us in the sitting room immediately.
Stragglers will be shot.
Only the lucky ones.
Ah, lady, gentlemen.
Jonathan Hemlock,
Jean-Paul Montaigne.
- Jean-Paul.
- I've looked forward to meeting you, Mr. Hemlock.
My pleasure.
This is my wife, Anna.
Anna.
Hello. Care for a drink?
And this is Karl Freytag.
- Karl.
- Herr Doctor.
And this is Andrei Meyer, Jon.
- Hello.
- Andrei, I've read a lot about you.
I used to read a lot about you.
It appears that we've read a lot about each other.
It's snowing out there.
How are the weather reports?
Oh, not too good. We've got a couple of good days, and then we've got a bunch of weak fronts moving in.
It's gonna be pretty dicey after that.
Good, that settles it.
Settles what?
We must leave immediately.
Do we have time to finish our drinks?
I mean, as soon as possible.
With a storm coming in, in maybe four days?
Well, the Eiger has been climbed in two.
But supposing you don't make it in two?
Supposing you get pinned down up there by the weather?
Oh, Benjamin has a point there.
We must not take childish risks.
We can't climb without some risks.
Perhaps the young face these risks more easily.
Good weather, bad weather. Now or later, any time's good for climbing.
All right, an impasse.
Two in favor of climbing, two opposed.
The democratic process.
What do you suggest, Doctor? Professor
Hemlock, that we climb halfway up?
Ben has a vote.
Yeah, but he will not be climbing with us.
He's our ground man. Until we hit the wall, he has complete control.
Has that been decided?
It's always like that.
The ground man has the last word now and the leader once we're on the face.
Okay, that brings us to another issue. Who's to be the leader?
I thought that was settled.
I thought you were gonna lead.
Okay. That decision was made before the original American member of the team had his unfortunate accident.
You know, I think we should make sure we agree on who's to lead, especially now that you've joined us.
You make a good point. Jonathan has climbed the mountain twice before.
Correction, if I may. The good doctor has failed to climb the mountain twice before.
I don't want to offend you, Herr
Doctor, but I'm forced to say
I don't consider a record of failure automatically grants you the right to lead.
I'm not offended.
I think it's important that you lead.
Okay. Good, then, let's come over here.
Let's move over here.
I've spent months studying a new route up the Eiger.
Taking the face by a new route will put us in the record books.
What is this new route?
Okay, we won't take the Hinterstoisser
Traverse. Instead, we go this way.
Our first bivouac should be high above the difficult cracks.
That's about here.
And the next morning, we have to move up this vertical rock face.
That'll be pretty tough, I guess.
We go all the way up and come out next to the highest visible ice field.
That's here. And then it's up to the top.
But nobody's ever been on that part of the face.
We don't know what's there.
Supposing you can't cling to the edges?
Suppose you get forced down into the gut of the chute?
Well, I've no interest in suicide, Ben.
If the edges are not a go, we'll retreat and follow one of the more classic routes.
Where all that can stop us is the weather.
Just one thing.
You know, your route doesn't allow for retreat in case we're blocked from above.
Well, I consider it self-defeating to plan in terms of retreat.
I consider it stupid not to.
Okay, I'll leave the planning for a retreat route to Dr. Hemlock.
After all, he has more experience than I in retreating.
Okay, may I take it my plan is accepted?
Fine.
Our business is settled.
Now, I suggest we relax and have a drink.
Is this hotel always so crowded?
Only when there's a climb.
Then the Eiger birds start flocking in.
Eiger birds?
Yeah, jet-setters.
Assorted zombies who come here to watch a climb.
If they get lucky, they get to watch a man die on the mountain.
That's grim.
So is the Eiger.
It even looks grim.
Do you have to go up?
Unless the search division identities the assassin first.
They've come up empty.
Is that what you came here to tell me? As a courier?
I could have phoned.
I just wanted to come up and be with you.
Oh, Jonathan, I had this fantastic speech planned.
I mean, I was going to say it really quick before you interrupted me or walked away.
Well, how's it go?
I forgot.
Well, first, why don't you tell me why you set me up?
I did it because I believe you had to take this sanction.
All right, I've taken it.
And you and me, working side by side, like loyal Americans, not to mention Dragon and Pope, will save the republic yet.
Have you met the other climbers?
Mmm-hmm.
Any suspicions?
Could be any one of them.
Could even be Madam Montaigne.
She's a very destructive woman.
You know the type.
I'm cold.
Jonathan, you know what I don't have?
No. What don't you have?
I don't have a room for the night.
Jesus.
I see, so you're a condemned man's last wish, huh?
4:00 p.m. We leave in 12 hours.
We must do the first thousand feet before the sun loosens the ice chunks.
If the weather holds.
It will hold.
It's certainly magnificent.
A perfect choice for my last mountain.
Hey, Jon, sit down, have a beer.
I've got a friend checking in, but I guess I can always go for a beer.
What's this about your last mountain?
Well, I'm not longer young, Jonathan.
Think of it. At 42, maybe I shall be the oldest man to climb the Eiger.
What do you think about that, Madam?
How do you feel about climbing?
I consider mountain climbing the biggest nonsense.
I've never been in better shape.
Ask Anna. Every night for 6 months,
I perform two hours of exercise before bed.
By now, she must be very anxious to see you climb the mountain.
Doctor, a message from the gentleman outside.
I think I'll take a stroll. Madam
Montaigne, would you care to join me?
Well, I think I shall return to my room.
If you will excuse me?
Well.
Well.
What got into Jean-Paul?
I don't know.
A little jumpy, I guess.
You been jumping his wife?
- No. Why?
- You sure?
Well, I think it's something
I'd know. I'll see you later.
Hey, Hemlock, how's it going?
Nice place here.
Get on with it, Pope.
Okay, pal, if that's the game you want to play, we'll get right down to the nitty-gritty.
No one is more qualified than you are.
Search division has drawn a blank on the target.
All we know is, he's here somewhere.
Miles Mellough knew who it was.
He did?
Did he tell you?
He offered to, but the price was too high.
What'd he want then?
To live.
Oh. Well, I just came to tell you that we've drawn a blank, and you'll have to climb.
Jemima Brown told me that already.
Jemima did, huh? Well, I just want to make sure you got the message.
You know how these Schwarzes are. You can't really trust 'em.
Pope, I really don't mind you being an asshole.
You can't really help that. But I do mind you lying to me like I was a fool.
Now you came here with one thought in mind, and that was attach yourself to me so the target would know who I am and what I am.
Now who's gonna perform this sanction if he gets me, you?
You don't think I can handle it?
In a locked closet with a grenade.
Just a minute, buddy.
Doesn't bother you a bit that you've blown my cover, does it?
Not one frigging bit, pal.
And if I walk?
No way.
You wouldn't get your hundred grand.
You'd lose your paintings.
And you'd probably spend some time for smuggling them into the country.
How does it feel being in a box, sweetheart?
You've done real well, Pope.
Well, that's mighty white of you.
Hey, that's a joke.
I bet Jemima never says that to you. "Mighty white of you."
By the way, how's that black stuff?
Pretty good, huh?
I guess it's only fair to warn you in advance
I'm gonna have to waste you a little.
Well, about your gun,
I got one waiting for you.
It's at the hotel. It's a C-2 special with no serial numbers.
It's in the candy box.
Now what's this about wasting me?
It's only fair to warn you, Hemlock, that I'm a black belt in karate.
Pope.
Gee, I... Gee, I...
Oh, my hand!
Okay.
You'll be all right now, Pope.
Course, you may have trouble playing the clarinet for a little while.
Listen, sweetheart, baby, pal,
I'm going back in the hotel, and when I come out,
I don't expect to see you around anymore. Understand?
Sleep well.
Good night. See you tomorrow.
Offer me a nightcap?
Some other time, thanks.
I wish you luck tomorrow.
Thank you.
I wish Jean-Paul would change his mind.
I can't understand why he's insisting on climbing this mountain at his age.
I can. He does it for you.
What? For me?
That's right.
He tries to keep you from younger men by staying young himself.
By doing young men's things.
Poor thing.
Yeah. Particularly since it hasn't worked.
It's colder than a witch's tit.
Good climbing weather, Ben.
Now you listen to me, old buddy.
You come down off that hill in one piece or I'm gonna kick your ass!
You're not gonna get sloppy on me, are you?
Now, look, you haven't told me anything, but somehow I know that you and one of them foreigners is gonna have some trouble.
Maybe.
Just guard your flank. Don't take your eyes off of 'em.
- I won't.
- Come on, let's be off!
We must make our first move before the sun unfreezes the rubble.
Take care.
Well, they're on their way.
That frigging Hemlock.
Thinks he's so goddamn cute.
How do you think he'd feel if he knew this whole thing was a fake?
A fake?
Sure.
Hemlock's friend? That Wormwood?
He was supposed to get killed.
That's why we hired the drunken bum.
But what about the germ formula?
I mean, the other side got it.
That's the real cute part.
They were supposed to get it.
It's a phony.
So why the sanctions?
Well, that's simple.
To sell the other side that the formula's the real thing.
Now, if we just let 'em steal it and not do anything about it, well, they'd get suspicious.
So, we had to assign Hemlock to sanction the assassins.
Do you mean to tell me that you're sitting up here safe, and that Jonathan might be killed?
And for nothing?
Honey, don't get worried. There's still lots of men around here.
Present company excluded.
Jonathan told me that you people were no better than animals, and I should've listened to him.
Don't be late coming up.
We're in the clear, Herr Doctor.
So far so good.
I knew it would be.
Take it.
You want to untie that?
Karl really likes to lead, doesn't he?
Uh-huh.
Even more, he likes the title of leader.
As if that makes him a leader.
Tell me, Andrei, you ever spend much time around Zurich?
There are no mountains there worth climbing.
They can see us pretty well from the hotel today. It's nice and clear.
I suppose so. We must give them a good show, Jonathan.
Chocolate?
Thanks.
Jean-Paul doesn't look well.
Something is on his mind.
Maybe.
Resting already, Herr Doctor?
Come on, let's get moving.
You don't like me,
Herr Doctor, do you?
I don't dislike you.
I just think you're stupid.
You knew we were going on this climb and still you got involved with Montaigne's wife.
She told you?
She didn't have to tell me.
The climb's gonna be hard enough without any intrigue.
All right.
What the hell are you doing?
I couldn't sleep.
I'm checking the ropes.
There was a frayed end on your rope, and I'm cutting it out.
Looks like we have some wet work ahead of us, huh, Freytag?
Surely, Herr Doctor, you have no objection to a morning shower.
This would be a hell of lot easier in the wintertime.
You suggest we wait?
Way to move your jaws, Jon.
That thing's gotta be a bitch.
That's gotta be a bitch.
I say, old boy, are you using your scope?
Do you mind if my wife has a peek?
Darling, tell him you'll pay for it.
We can pay for it, you know.
Get out of here. Either of you frigging vampires ever touch this telescope, you're gonna need surgery to get it out of your ass.
Damn rude fellow.
Bloody American farmers, you know.
- Rocks!
- Huh?
Jesus!
Freytag! Meyer!
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn!
Oh, God.
You all right?
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Oh, thank God.
Thanks. Where's Freytag?
He felt he wasn't needed.
Thought he wasn't needed?
Freytag, you asshole!
Tell me, Mr. Bowman, in your opinion, do these men climb to prove their manhood or is it more a matter of compensating for inferiority feelings?
Lady, why don't you go get yourself screwed?
It'll do you a lot of good.
Well, the worst is behind us.
You really needn't be so glum, Herr Doctor.
If we have to retreat, we're never gonna make it back through those falls.
You have a defeatist mentality. We won't retreat. We'll go straight on up.
You didn't know we were in trouble?
No.
That's not good.
Oh, it sounds exciting.
Pity I slept through it.
That's the spirit.
Come on, up we go.
Shit!
- What is it?
- It's a foehn moving in.
What's a foehn?
Warm air, then rain, then a freeze, like all in a flash.
Is that bad?
It's frigging awful. That entire mother of a rock is gonna be covered with ice.
But you can't walk on it, and you can't see through it to find a crack in the rocks to drive your pitons.
The snow is all glazed over.
But you'll be able to drop through up to your neck at any time.
Worse thing, it's coming from the south.
They won't even know it's coming until it hits.
Then they must come down.
Lady, by the time they find out, they won't be able to come down.
They won't be able to go up.
They're just gonna be stuck.
You all right?
Yes, let's rest.
Morning.
How's Jean-Paul?
He's dead.
He must have gone during the storm.
Drink that.
How do you know he's dead?
I looked at him.
You saw he was dead, and then you made a pot of tea?
Drink it before it gets cold.
He had a concussion.
The storm was too much.
The man inside couldn't keep the man outside from dying.
What now?
Moving ahead is out of the question.
Conditions are impossible.
We're gonna have to go back.
Through the ravine?
No, the ravine's impossible, too.
- Andrei, you listening?
- Yeah.
Speak up if you disagree.
You're doing fine.
All right.
We traverse back across the ice field to a place approximately above the rail road tunnel window.
There, if we can get a rope down,
Ben will be waiting with help.
I'll lead. Karl, you be second.
Meyer, you bring up the rear.
We'll string Jean-Paul's body on a separate line between us.
We gonna carry Montaigne back down?
A climber always brings home his dead.
We'll get down.
- Mr. Bowman?
- Just go away.
Oh, you're Jon's friend, aren't you?
Yeah. How is he?
Uh, well, they're coming down.
Shit, I don't know. Montaigne is hurt or he's dead.
Do you think they can get down safely?
There's only one chance.
Everything is iced.
If they can get to those cliffs above the station window, maybe they can rope down and we can pull them in.
How much of a chance do you think they have?
Not much, but it's the only one.
As soon as I find out that that's what they're doing,
I'll bring men up to the station.
You know, I didn't want him to make this climb.
And now, Montaigne is either hurt or he's dead. I knew there'd be death.
It was planned that way.
All for nothing.
Drop your packs. We'll rig some safety lines up.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, but think of what it must be like up there for them.
Come on, Jon.
Get your ass off that hill.
Jonathan!
Damn it! Belay me.
Hang on.
Jonathan, watch it!
Hang on. We should be over the tunnel window.
In the future, I wish you would not use me to ride around on like a sled.
Look, you better get up there before he panics. Those pins are loose.
Jonathan, you're very good.
I have really enjoyed climbing with you.
We'll make it.
I don't think so.
But we shall continue with style.
Take it easy.
Take it easy. Don't panic.
Wait.
Look out!
I can't hold him!
The ice is cracking!
Jon!
You're limping, Ben.
I'm gonna throw you a rope.
You're limping, Ben.
Listen to me.
I'm gonna throw you a rope, Jon.
Catch this rope when
I throw it to you.
Wrap it around you.
Wrap the rope around you.
Hook the rope to you!
Good!
Now cut the rope above you.
Jon, do what I tell you.
Cut the rope above you.
Cut the rope above you, Jon.
Cold mountain air really bothers the old frostbite.
You ought to remember, Jon.
You hauled me down off that mountain when my feet froze.
I'm the one you're after.
I never planned for
Henri Baq to die.
I was supposed to take him out and buy him some drinks and con him out of the microfilm.
I was as surprised as anybody when Kruger killed him.
How'd you get involved with the other side anyway?
Miles Mellough. I owed him.
He helped get my daughter off drugs.
Daughter?
George is my little girl.
Took a chance coming up on the mountain.
You took a chance when you cut that rope.
Old pink eyes is back.
Jesus.
Yeah?
Hemlock, we don't know and we don't want to know how you managed to precipitate all three fellow climbers from the mountain.
We assume that, unable to discover your target, you decided to take all three.
Extravagant, but effective.
And you have always been both.
We regret that your file will be placed in the inactive list.
However, we hope that one day you may work with our organization again.
Good-b ye, Dr. Hemlock.
Thank you, baby.
Well, C-2 thinks they've got their man.
There's no reason to persuade them otherwise.
You wouldn't shit me, would you, Jon?
Hate to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder for you, like Miles did.
Forget it, Ben.
Look...
Yeah.
Well, maybe someday we'll do some more climbing together.
Maybe.
You know what I don't have, baby?
What don't you have?
I don't have a ticket back home.
I'll take care of it.
That art collection of mine is not going to get any bigger, but I'd sure like to have you take a long look at it.
I thought you'd never ask.
I'll get two tickets.
Jonathan, you can tell me.
You didn't really sanction all three of them, did you?
What the hell you trying to do, kill yourself?
- There's something down there.
- What was it?
I don't know.
Something grabbed my arm, twisted me around.
Almost pulled my arm off.
Here. Give me this.
Listen, I told you, you gotta stay with me.
David, I panicked.
Well, listen, you can't panic.
You just gotta learn to relax...
...and control yourself.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Actually, David, it's my foot.
Damn thing bit off my entire foot.
Look, it's just a bloody stump.
I almost drowned.
We might as well be married for all the concern I get around here.
You wanna go dive naked?
In the bathtub, in the hotel?
Gail, hey, look.
- Look at this.
- What is it?
I don't know.
Looks like a coin.
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay, babe.
Goliath? I thought you said you were diving on the Brighton.
We did dive the Brighton...
...then we spotted that wreck off the point...
...so we decided we'd take a look.
It wasn't in the guidebook.
Damn right it's not.
Goliath's full of munitions.
Tourists aren't allowed to blow themselves up, you know.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Can't believe the stuff this Romer Treece...
...has found off the coast around here.
I can believe it.
- What have we found out?
- Well, I don't know.
"O.P.N." means ora pro nobis,
"pray for us"...
...and "S.C."
I can't find in any of these.
You know, if I'd wanted to spend my holiday in the library...
...I could've walked 10 blocks to 42nd Street.
- Let's approach this methodically.
- I'd love to play tennis.
- Our coin is dated 1714, right?
- You're not listening.
The only ships that went down in that period...
...were King Philip's fleet in 1715.
- Ping-Pong?
Now, that's fantastic because there's 30 million in gold.
Okay.
I'm gonna play tennis with a pro.
No.
All right.
- What are you gonna have?
- Wine, madam?
No, thank you.
- Would you care for some more, sir?
- Thank you.
- Would you like some dessert?
- No, thank you.
It was about here, outside the wreck, that I almost had my arm torn off.
All right, if you were there...
...I was across the hull in about 80 feet of water...
...and that's where I found that coin...
Hello.
You must be the young couple who found that bottle this afternoon?
Smallish, three inches long, tapered?
It could be Reinhardt glass, you know...
...from Rotterdam, before the war.
- It certainly didn't look like anything...
- We didn't find any bottle.
Yeah.
We...
My name is Henri Bondurant, a jeweller by trade.
By avocation, a collector of rare and unusual glass.
You see, the government here...
...has rather strict rules about diving.
Legally, you cannot take anything off Bermuda...
...unless you first offer to sell it to the government and are declined.
Unfortunately, the government rarely ever does decline...
...and even more rarely offers premium prices.
- What'd you say your name was?
- Bondurant. Bondurant.
Well, I am sorry. This is fascinating, but what does it have to do with us?
Let me tell you something.
If that bottle is a genuine Reinhardt...
...it would be a small coup for a collector like myself.
- I would be prepared to offer...
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I told you, we don't have any bottle.
In that case...
...my apologies for having interrupted your conversation.
Good night.
Jesus. Who was that?
Some dynamite businessman.
You could have listened.
Well... Come on, Gail.
Bottle collector, my ass.
Do you think this is it?
Well, it isn't a bloody tourist trap.
What do you want?
- Mr. Treece?
- Indeed.
Well, Mr. Treece, a friend of ours...
...was doing some diving around here about a month ago...
...and found a Spanish coin that was dated 1714...
...and he told us to talk to you.
- Look it up in the Hamilton library.
- Yeah, we did.
We talked to the librarian and she said for us to come here...
...and talk to you because you'd help us.
Yes, well, she's a stupid woman...
...but she's kind, you know.
Quite kind.
She still growing her moustache?
It's all right. Come on in.
Let's see what you got.
Come on over, then.
But you haven't been asked for lunch.
Thank you.
Well, it ain't no coin, boy.
It's a Spanish medallion.
It's a medallion?
Beginner's luck.
If this hadn't laid against iron, it would've oxidized long ago...
...and you'd have nothing.
- Right.
We couldn't figure out the inscription, ora pro nobis, and S.C. In front of it.
"Santa Clara, pray for us."
That was common enough an inscription in those days.
- There you are, boy.
- Is it valuable?
One medallion? No, not to me.
Must be one of
King Philip's treasure.
That's the only fleet that went down in that time.
No, not unless it walked itself across the ocean for 800 miles.
That fleet went down in a hurricane off Florida...
...all 11 of them, 1715.
That's all documented and proven in my library.
We've already found El Capitano,
Ubilla's flagship.
Obviously, there's something down here, isn't there?
Well, now, just hang on a minute, boy.
You just found one trinket.
Might pay for your holiday, if you don't drink too much.
On the other hand, it might have fallen overboard...
...dropped there by some drunken old rummy one night.
What else have you got in there, then?
Hey, boy, this is Goliath trash.
What the hell were you doing diving down there?
We spotted the wreck off the point so we dived down.
Where'd you get this, exactly?
Right about here, just outside the wreck.
Are you quite sure?
Water plays strange tricks sometimes, you know.
Makes things look bigger, smaller, wrong way around.
- Sure it was right there?
- I'm positive.
There certainly are a lot of glass freaks in Bermuda.
Somebody else know about this, then?
Last night, a bald guy came up at dinner.
He said he was a glass collector.
He described that perfectly.
I didn't show it to him.
Looked like a basketball player.
Henri Bondurant, a French guy.
No, he's Haitian.
And, boy, could I just have another little look at that medallion there?
Yeah.
I think I might just've missed something here.
Come over here and let's have a look at this magnifying glass.
Yeah.
- Now, you see those letters here?
- Yes.
Not your normal mint mark.
That might be the mark of the engraver...
...or it might be the person who had it made up.
I'm sure of one thing.
It's made up for somebody special.
Then it might be worth another look down there?
Yes. Well, as I said, it might, but not to me.
Thank you.
Sorry you can't stay for lunch.
Wait a minute, Mr. Treece.
That's all?
- Come on, David. Let's go.
- Just a sec.
You might not mind wasting any more of your time...
...but I can't have you wasting mine.
You said there was something special.
- Let's go take a look.
- Good afternoon.
You okay?
Gail.
Go right.
I wonder what the hell this guy's doing.
David!
Try and pull over.
I can't!
David!
- David?
- Yeah?
Should have sold me that bottle.
Now you force me to take what you would not let me pay for.
Well, if it'll ease your mind,
I'll still name a price.
Take off their blindfolds.
Look, if it's not in the bag,
I don't know where in the hell it is.
- The girl.
- Look, she hasn't got it...
If his tongue moves again, cut it.
I'll do it.
Put it back on.
Since neither of you seem to have that bottle...
...I must assume it is now the property of Romer Treece.
Well, then, for Christ's sake, let him go.
It hasn't been all that pleasant for you, has it, Mr. Sanders?
Enjoy yourselves this evening.
Eat a good dinner...
...go dancing.
But be off the island by tomorrow.
Treece.
Come on, Treece.
All right, Treece.
What the hell's going on?
Take it up.
Listen, I'll look after this.
Okay.
- Hold it.
- Coffin?
He's the only man alive who might know one of these ampoules on sight.
Can I show him your map, please?
He was the sole survivor of the Goliath, you see.
Thank you.
Now, then, Adam...
...this one of your legendary ampoules?
This is the real thing, all right.
The old girl's finally lost her virginity.
My friends found it there.
Well, the way she's lying here a storm must've flipped her around.
She was never this close to the edge of the reef before.
You're lucky.
Five people have died over the last 30 years...
...trying to crawl inside that ship.
Blew themselves up poking torches around.
There's enough live ammo down there to blow up half the island.
Oh, will somebody just cut the crap?
Blew themselves up for what?
Goliath was a military ship, boy.
Went down with munitions and medical supplies.
Or so they say.
They're there, all right.
All right, what's there?
Morphine, 98,000 ampoules.
I packed them myself.
Jesus.
Why didn't you tell us the truth?
If you had, we wouldn't have had that run-in with that Haitian.
The name's Cloche.
That you didn't know nothing's what saved you.
I wasn't sure myself until now.
The first time he's told me the truth.
Adam, what do you reckon to the rest of them, then?
They're probably all smashed up by the ordnance now.
The way she's lying here...
...this time there won't be any steel plate to have to burn through.
They've performed a bloody autopsy on that with everything but forceps...
...but nobody ever found one of those before.
Well, we found one.
Oh, we are having a wonderful day, aren't we, David?
How come nobody found one until now?
Well, the sea's a joker, boy.
Loves to fool you.
Dive a wreck one day, find nothing.
That night, blows up a storm...
...go back again, same spot, you find a carpet of golden coin.
We just had one of the worst storms in 10 years, haven't we, Adam?
- Aye.
- Coffin!
Goddamn it. Coffin.
"Coffin. Goddamn it, Coffin."
Nice to meet you folks.
Mr. Treece?
Which one of us turns this thing over to the government?
Well, now, miss...
...I'm going to have to think on that.
You see, I was never one much to bother with formalities.
Morphine's not exactly a formality.
- That's halfway to heroin.
- Halfway to hell.
I know all about that.
So does Cloche.
By the time some Hamilton bureaucrat gets off of his fat bum...
...it will be heroin.
That's why I'm gonna dive down there tonight.
You haven't answered my question,
Mr. Treece.
I'll answer the question. I'm turning this over to the government.
I'm all the government you need, boy.
Put that right back.
Now, the reasons are two.
They're mine and yours.
Mine, if there are thousands of ampoules down there...
...and Cloche gets his hands on them...
...that junk will be on the street in New York in a week.
Yours, if you're lucky, it's the only one left...
...but if you go to the government, your treasure hunt will be off...
...and if there is any treasure down there...
...you'll just be reading about somebody else finding it.
David, please don't dive.
Make up your own mind, boy.
I have made up my mind, Treece.
I'm diving with you tonight...
...or I'm handing over all this information...
...to the authorities this afternoon.
Look, Gail, it's important to me.
You understand?
Listen, David, it's morphine.
Morphine.
We only met the man today.
Don't know anything more about him than you want to.
I can't afford to pass it up.
It's an experience.
Experience?
Don't you mean privilege?
- He suckered you in like a 5-year-old.
- Wait a minute.
I blackmailed him.
You remember that?
- Is that the way you remember it?
- Yes, because that's the way it was.
There's treasure down there, Gail.
I know. So I gotta go look.
You're so blind, you couldn't see it in front of you.
Well, look, I feel things, so I do them.
That's just the way I am.
And you wind up with T-shirts.
Oh, Jesus.
That's unfair. That's totally unfair.
Look, I didn't come here for you.
I came here for us.
So would you please think about it?
I always think about us.
Say, who is that guy?
I don't like him at all.
Well, you're going to have to because that's Kevin, he's family.
My mother liked him.
Told him to look after me.
Put your gear in the cabin.
Well, here I am.
I'm all ready. I've got all my gear.
I'm sorry you had such a long walk, because you're not diving tonight.
The hell I'm not.
That's my ship out there.
Those are my mates.
Your ship's dead.
So are your mates.
So were you too when I found you washed up on the beach.
And there's never bringing any of us back again, is there?
You just go on home now.
Good night.
- All set, captain?
- Aye.
Full moon tonight. We're gonna stick out like a cherry on a cream pie.
Cast her off forward, Kev.
Would you like some of that rum?
Yeah.
- There you go.
- No, thanks.
I never drink before I dive.
You know what they say about these waters?
If the Jamaican pirates don't get you...
...it'll be the cold embrace of the sea.
And that's no lover's kiss.
You know every ship from the New World...
...passed through these waters?
They had to.
Kangxi porcelain from China...
...Japanese silk screens...
...and those ivory doodads from India.
And all that Inca gold that Pizarro took out of Peru.
Do you believe all that, boy?
Yeah, I believe all of it.
Every bit of it. So do you.
You gonna marry that girl of yours?
Hey, boy.
We're getting very close now.
Four dots and a dash, that's your hotel.
Hey, Treece.
What do you do on a foggy night?
I just stay home and I drink rum.
Here, give me a hand, will you?
Hey, wait a minute.
This is explosives.
I don't wanna have anything to do with explosives.
If there are thousands of ampoules down there...
...I'm gonna rig the Goliath...
...so that I can topple it off the reef...
...out of anybody's reach forever.
So, what about the treasure?
Here, you'll need this.
Black as molasses.
Don't you go frightening anything down there.
What's wrong?
I'm not blowing it, not now.
That's the biggest moray eel I ever saw.
He wanted you for his supper.
What's the matter, boy?
Cheap Jack Bush.
Warning from Cloche.
- Cheap Jack what?
- Voodoo.
Cloche always likes to bring in a bit of Haiti with him.
Anybody take any notice of this...
...ought to have his brain examined.
Lights in your hotel have gone out.
We'll run the reef so I can drop you on the beach.
- All right.
- Get that anchor up.
- Yeah.
- Keep a sharp eye.
David?
Just a minute. I put the lock on.
David?
Who's there?
You gotta go starboard.
Port. Port.
I've been through this reef before.
Yeah, but the hotel beach is over there.
I know where the bloody beach is.
Okay, you're clear. You're clear.
Stop. Stop.
Goddamn it.
Gail?
Honey, what happened?
I haven't...
...felt like that...
...in my entire life.
- Okay.
- I was so helpless.
- It's all right, honey.
- David.
They...
They painted me.
- Quiet, now.
- David.
Come on, listen to me.
Listen. Listen.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay, baby.
We'll go home.
We'll go home tonight.
Boy, the airport's closed.
No way off the island.
You best come home with me.
We're not going home with you,
Treece...
...because it's you and it's Cloche...
...and it's that goddamn morphine that almost got her killed tonight.
Boy, if Cloche wanted her dead, we'd be digging her grave by now.
He just wanted her as some kind of trump card...
...until he knew about the morphine.
You come home with me.
David, it's the only place you'll be safe tonight.
Don't worry. I'll make sure everyone's placed properly.
Right, but you, yourself, you watch the west side.
Make sure nobody comes over the swing bridge.
If he does come,
I hope it's my bloody way.
- Kevin.
- Aye?
You just take care of yourself.
Don't want anybody else to be hurt tonight. Go on.
How's your girl?
She's asleep.
Why didn't you blow that boat up?
Because of what you found, boy.
I think you ought to have a look at this.
Why, I never seen one like that before.
That's an 18th-century escutcheon plate.
You might be right, you see.
There just might be a king's ransom down there.
It would take three keys...
...to open the box that that plate came from.
Now, the captain would have one...
...the governor of Havana had two.
The owner would have all three in his possession...
...so only the owner could open them on his own, right?
A three-key lock like that is very rare. Very rare indeed.
Only used on nobility business.
What would a plate like this...
...be doing in the hold of a World War II munitions ship?
Yes, well, now, I don't know.
Suppose you have two storms...
...hundreds of years apart...
...springing up from the same quarter...
...and they catch two ships in the same circumstances...
...making for the same shelter.
Now, might they not drive them up on the same reef?
You think the current could bring that plate...
...up through the split in the hull?
Why hasn't anybody found this other ship?
I don't know yet, but I can tell you we'll find that in Havana manifesto.
I've got survivors' accounts, everything.
I ought to be able to tell you who that ship is, where she come from.
These are the Spanish, this is the English translation.
You and your beginner's luck, eh?
Mr. Treece.
If there is something more down there, what would it take to bring it up?
Well, under normal circumstances...
...using a sand gun and DESCO equipment...
...clear water and a lot of luck, just a few days.
But that hardly applies now, does it, since we got Cloche on our back?
- What would it take to get him off?
- Cloche?
Any deal that gets him the morphine,
I suppose.
But what do either of you care?
You're both going home tomorrow.
You'll be up to your neck in city smut by dinnertime.
Good God, what a world that is.
It made me climb the Statue of Liberty once.
It's dreams, Treece.
It's all daydreams.
It's a little more than daydreams, boy, when you find a three-lock box.
You see, by rights, you discovered her.
Whoever she is, you were the first to find her.
You would have left that plate there if I hadn't known it for what it was.
So that rolls me aboard as well.
Let me put it to you simple.
Whatever's down there, a lot or a little...
...half yours, half mine.
But the right to tell the world about it, that's all yours.
Come on up, okay?
Yeah, in a minute. Yeah, I'm coming.
Okay.
You're still there, girl?
Like a jar?
Warm you up.
Anyway...
...rum is not drinking, it's surviving.
You know what's got me stumped?
This is the Havana manifest right here.
It's clearly signed by the king's man in Havana...
...the Marquesa Cazaterras, governor of Cuba.
See, it states here that entire fleet sunk...
...off the coast of Florida in 1715.
That's King Philip's fleet, 1715.
Every ship, right?
All itemized, all recorded.
So, what I don't understand is...
...what is this ship doing down here in these waters...
...unitemized, unrecorded, unescorted...
...and carrying a three-lock box?
He's all right, that David of yours.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I apologise.
I lost touch why we even came down here.
I'll take you home.
You don't want to go home tomorrow.
I don't want to stay here without you.
Say that again.
I don't want to stay here without you.
Go away, will you?
That was a stupid business last night and cruel, very cruel.
You did not go to the police.
I've been tossing and turning all night wondering why.
There's thousands and thousands of ampoules of morphine down there.
You want them, and I got them.
They're still on the Goliath.
You have nothing but the gall to claim ownership.
I rigged that ship with booby traps last night.
She's wired to 10 ways to hell...
...and the wrong person goes down there, she'll blow.
You would need an advantage to deal with me.
I'll expect them in two days.
No, I shall need at least four.
We seem to have settled on three.
What sort of fee are you getting for diving these days?
One million dollars, cash, low denominations.
That's my share. You'll make twice as much as that in America.
Your attitude on drugs is a matter of record.
Why sell them to me for a profit?
I have my reasons.
Listen, I don't want any interference in this dive.
I know you'll be watching, but I don't want to see you.
And as for the young couple, you keep your hands off of them.
If you want me, you come and see me this time.
You know where I live.
Three days, Treece.
Three days.
Afternoon, Mr. Cloche.
Thank you, Kev.
Now, then. Listen, you two.
When this air gun gets going...
...I want you on my right, David, and you on my left, girl.
We pick up the ampoules as the sand gets sucked away...
...but be very careful of your hands.
When this thing's on full, it can swallow a cannonball.
How much of that junk are we gonna bring up?
Just enough to satisfy our audience up there on the cliff.
Oh, they're there, all right.
That Kevin sure gives me the willies.
He doesn't say much.
Maybe he don't like you, Adam.
He likes me. He's family.
Don't you worry about Kevin.
You just watch that little lever on that compressor.
Turn it off if there's any real trouble and don't forget to turn it on again.
And, boy, you feel that breeze cutting out of your hose, come up fast.
But be careful. It's just possible...
...there might be somebody waiting up there for you.
By rights, it should be me going down.
Now, let's not go into it again, Adam.
I got enough trouble looking after the boy here.
Don't worry, Treece.
I'm gonna go slow enough for you.
- I'm going in.
- Okay.
Gail's behind us.
Get closer.
I can't hear you.
You'll have to shout.
Right, David.
Now, keep those air hoses clear.
Right.
You go down.
I'll be right behind you.
Wait, wait.
That's where we saw the eel.
Come on.
David.
Lead it into the next compartment.
Keep your hands clear, girl.
Let's go look for the treasure.
All right.
Goliath's moving.
Kevin!
- David.
- Girl, you wait. I'll go.
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
Look what I found.
Look what I found.
I don't care what you found. That was a bloody amateur thing to do.
I had to take the mask off.
I couldn't reach it.
Damn it. Look at it.
Gail, look. It's gold.
I knew there was treasure down here.
What kind of a ship was it?
Probably Spanish.
Might be a galleon.
Till you fell through the Goliath...
...this cave was all sealed up.
That tunnel I pulled you out of...
...it leads right down to the bottom of the reef.
Let's get out of here.
Goliath's on the move again.
It'll cut our hoses.
Up, now. Up, up.
- How many you reckon we have?
- About 4000.
Here you go, Kev.
Explosives?
What the hell are you doing that for?
- I'm rigging this.
- What the hell for?
Because this is the first place anybody would look for them.
If you hide the things somewhere else, you wouldn't have to blow your house.
But if I hide the things somewhere else...
...they wouldn't know where to look, would they?
I'm only gonna keep the buggers two days.
Kev, you stay ashore from now on.
Somebody's got to watch this place.
Right.
Oh, the hell. It still makes no sense.
What?
We know that the Grifon is the wreck underneath.
- We know that from the bell, right?
- Right.
But you see, it says here in the manifest...
...the Grifon was a French ship with a French captain...
...a tobacco ship.
It's allowed to tag along with the 1715 fleet...
...for protection from pirates.
That's here in the manifest.
You know what interests me?
The Grifon was the only ship to survive that hurricane.
She went back to Havana for repairs.
All right, but then what's she doing off of Bermuda...
...with part of that fleet's treasure?
- I don't know.
That's what I keep trying to puzzle out.
Because it says here the entire 1715 fleet...
...went down off Florida together, all 11 ships.
They say the fleet's treasure was aboard the flagship.
The sailing manifests prove it.
Then the governor, Cazaterras, the man I told you about...
...he reports everything's lost.
- Maybe he's wrong.
- No.
See, what we found is jewellery.
We didn't find the gold and silver from the fleet.
Jewellery and a Spanish three-lock box on a French tagalong tobacco ship.
Well, somebody could be lying.
Could be lying.
No, the Spaniards were fanatics for accurate records.
They always had everything like this rechecked by some important official.
Here it is again.
What?
"E.F."
Look at that.
What's something like that worth?
I don't know exactly what you got there.
Eight or nine ounces,
22-carat gold.
Good pearls.
Play it quiet, maybe $7500 on the market...
...less breakdown and melting costs.
You wouldn't melt a beautiful thing like that?
No, I wouldn't, but there are those who would.
And the ocean's not a jewellery store.
You don't get no receipts.
You got to prove that that's authentic.
- Anybody can see it's authentic.
- You don't understand me.
There's a lot of counterfeit on the market today.
I mean, it's real gold, it's real gems, but it's false.
No, you have to establish a provenance.
You gotta do that first.
You gotta find a proof that it's real.
Now, if we could find in here a verifying record...
...a description of any piece down there...
...that makes it all worth a bloody fortune.
Want to have your name on a plaque?
Want to be a celebrity?
No, there's not enough room in the Hamilton library.
I think they could find a bit of room for you, boy.
Well, it's possible, it's just possible...
...there's something else going on, but I don't know what it is.
Beat it out of me if you want to, but it won't do you any good.
I merely need information.
Which brings us, of course, to your fee.
How much is Treece paying you, by the way?
I'll pay 10 percent.
Done.
How many did they bring up today?
Six. Four thousand or so.
And yet Treece claims they're all down there?
That's what the girl says, yes.
It almost seems as if Treece is hiding something from both of us.
Doesn't it, my friend?
And we can't have partners who double-cross us...
...can we?
David?
You know, maybe you were right.
You know, I think somebody was lying and do you know who I think it is?
Governor of Havana.
Come here. Have a look at this.
See, this is the list he sent back to Spain...
...reporting the goods that were lost in the storm.
But according to this list...
...more was lost than the fleet's sailing manifest said was sent.
You know the difference?
The difference is jewels.
Not trinkets, mind you.
Masterpieces, works of art.
Two pages of the list were lost.
They never got to Seville.
That's where the original is.
You listen.
"A team of silver horses pulling a golden carriage.
A pair ofjade hummingbirds...
...one with wings of emeralds, the other with wings of pearl.
A golden dragon with emerald eyes."
Yeah, but does it say anything about what we found?
Like the pine cone filled with pearls...
...or the medallion itself?
No. Not on that page.
You know something?
This doesn't even look like a proper manifest to me.
It's not a manifest.
It's a shopping list.
- For a woman.
- For what?
It's a shopping list for a woman.
Gentlemen, I give you E.F.
- It's the lady on the medallion.
- The Duchess of Parma.
Oh, come on, Gail.
We've got an E.F., not a D.P.
The Duchess of Parma was her title.
Elizabeth Farnese was her real name.
- Come on, girl. Get on with it.
- Well, it seems that in 1714...
...when King Philip's first wife had just died...
...he developed a royal lust...
...for the beautiful
Duchess of Parma.
Well, she finally agreed to marry him, by proxy...
...but he wasn't there yet because
Elizabeth wasn't the kind of woman...
...to give away something for nothing, like her virginity.
And before he could touch that...
...she insisted that he deck her up with a set of jewels, quote...
..."unique in all the world," unquote.
Now, Philip commissioned those jewels to be made...
...and if that's what we found, he never got laid.
Beautiful. Just beautiful.
Yeah, she was a pretty smart lady.
You know, I've known him for three years...
...and all he's ever given me is a sweater and a pair of sneakers.
Well, he isn't the king of Spain, is he, girl?
What do you think?
Well...
Thinking aloud...
Just suppose you were the governor of Havana...
...with a three-lock box...
...and you knew it had something so personal...
...so valuable, belonging to the king of Spain.
You might not put it on a prime target like a flagship.
You might just put it on a French tobacco ship.
You know the fleet would be there for protection...
...but then the whole fleet sinks except the French tobacco ship...
...and the governor keeps to his story...
...and he lists the box as lost along with the fleet.
I'll buy it.
The Grifon sails again...
...and this time it gets caught in another hurricane off Bermuda...
...and it sinks.
The poor old governor of Havana...
...he has to go back to Madrid and live on his pension, right?
You know, girl, if we could just find one item down there...
...just one that's on your shopping list...
...we've found our bloody provenance.
That's why he wouldn't let me dive.
Damn you, Treece.
David?
"E.F." It's E.F. Again.
Treece. Treece.
Up. Up. Everybody, up.
The both of you, up.
Let me get this first.
- Get up.
- Let me get this first.
I don't care what you've found, boy.
Wait, get the dredge.
David, our only chance is to go up in the bubbles.
Take all the breath you can.
I'm gonna cut the air hoses, so stay close.
What the hell happened up here?
Old Fellini came by in his boat.
He was all rummed up.
God help me.
I must have been dozing or something.
When I looked out, all that stuff in the water...
...and the sharks were all over.
Why didn't you warn us on that compressor?
I was gonna turn it on, I was.
But then I knew you wouldn't know what kind of trouble you was in...
...and I might send you right into them.
Thank God you came through.
I knew there was more than morphine down there...
...all those ampoules coming up so slow like they were.
Yes. That's right, Adam.
I might just have saved your life for something after all.
Hey, boy. Get that dredge up.
There'll be no more diving today, not with all those sharks around.
All right, once again.
One more time, just for the hell of it.
Oh, I'm too tired.
Let's face it.
We haven't got our provenance.
All the jewellery we found must be on those missing pages.
Well, let's go over it again just one more time for the hell of it.
All right, and give me a rum, would you?
One golden ruby-studded cross.
Good morning.
Kevin.
Four tanks. They need filling.
Treece is expecting me.
They all up there?
Aye, they're there.
Gail, let me see the...
Let me see your sketch of the Grifon.
It's in my bag.
- Is there any fresh coffee, David?
- Yeah, it's on the table.
Wait a minute, this is the medallion.
I want the original one, the Goliath.
- It's in there too.
- No, it's not in here at all.
- It must be.
- Well, you come look.
You're right. It's not.
Adam.
I think I'll take a breath of air.
Do you mind locking up after me?
Thank you.
Jesus. That's it. That is it.
- What?
- I've seen this.
I've seen part of this.
I've seen part of this down there.
- Seen what?
- Well...
See, she's wearing a dragon pendant...
...but when you drew this, these lines,
I thought that was her dress...
...but you drew this before Treece cleaned the medallion.
Now, I've seen this chain.
I've seen this chain down there.
I was trying to get it.
On the list, there's something about gold chains...
...chains of gold.
Something like that.
- Nope, there's nothing about chains.
- Yes. Yes, there is.
There is a dragon pendant.
"A gold-jewelled dragon."
That's it. That's it.
Then the jeweller that made this pendant also made this medallion.
Now, if I go down there and I find the chain...
...and the dragon is at the end of the chain...
...then we've got our proof, babe.
We got our proof, huh? All right.
Kev?
Treece, we solved it.
It was here all along.
It's the provenance.
David's seen part of it down there.
- You solved nothing.
- What the hell you talking about?
I'm going to blow the Goliath now.
Why now?
Because if anything happens to me...
...there's nobody else left to do it.
What do you mean, if anything happens to you?
You go ahead and blow the Goliath,
Treece. You go ahead and blow it.
But first, I'm going down there.
I'm getting that provenance.
Go upstairs, pack, and go home.
To hell with it, Treece.
I'm not doing that.
I'm going down there...
...and you're gonna have to blow me up too.
As you please, boy.
Excuse me.
You don't need me down there, do you?
No, I don't think I do.
Coffin.
They killed Kevin.
David, I'm gonna signal you when I fire this fuse.
After that, I don't care if you've found the Holy Grail itself.
You've only got three minutes, so get out.
Listen. Now, don't worry.
Just turn on the air dredge when I get in, all right?
I'll be all right, huh?
David.
David! Here!
"The very fact that the commandment says "do not kill" makes us aware and convinced that we are descended from an unbroken chain of generations of assassins for whom the love of murder was in their blood, as it is perhaps in ours too"
Welcome!
- Hello!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Hi Neil!
How's it going Neil? You've forgotten your old friends since living in New York.
Obviously I'd like to come home more often. No Julie?
Yes, especially ifWall Street were here.
But I don't have time to play the tourist.
Talking of which, the meeting with Muller is set for eight.
Seems he's willing to buy that lot of stocks which you told me about yesterday.
I'm sorry dear, but I don't have time to go home with you.
You know, it's very important. I'll call you a taxi.
Don't worry, I can get one myself.
Excuse me if we steal your husband just a few metres into Austria.
I'm not a boring wife.
The extremely important things first.
Kramorstrasse 25.
What's going on?
Good evening.
- Documents, please.
- Here, take it.
I'm sorry, madam. It's just a formality.
What's this about?
Awoman was killed half an hour ago, near the airport.
Another woman killed?
Yes, and razor-slashed again. You can go.
This story is becoming an obsession with the publicity in the papers and on tv about that crazy maniac.
Yes, they mentioned it in the States too.
They should bring back the death, they should do it!
Then that people would meet the end they deserve.
130 schillings.
- Please keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back Mrs Wardh.
- Antonio, it's you.
A pleasure to see you again, madam.
Everything's in order with the apartment.
Has anyone come in within the last few minutes?
No, madam. Were you expecting someone?
The maid comes tomorrow. I'll take care of the bags.
Thank you.
- Mrs Wardh?
- Yes?
For you. The porter asked me to deliver the luggage.
Leave them here.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
The worst part of you is the best thing you have and will always be mine. Jean.
Yes I understand, Neil. At least try to pick me up not too late though. No! I'm not angry even though Carroll calls me 'Widow Wardh'.
You've only stayed with me one night in the three days we've been here.
Come quickly, alright? Bye.
Julie, you can finally stop whining about the old man.
Look what I've brought you:
It's fantastic news fresh from Australia.
You wouldn't believe it.
George! Tell him something about uncle.
To be honest, I was fond of old uncle.
Uncle croaked in the end and left a nice nest-egg for me and him.
We're the sole heirs.
You're family?
Yes.
At least that's the way it is for the notary in Sydney.
Uncle's dead without a will and the young lady and I are the sole heirs.
What should I say? Condolences or congratulations?
Just say: Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Very good. Shall we drink something to celebrate?
- Our meeting?
- No, to uncle's death.
Without which I'd never have met you.
Oh, right.
Julie, please don't cheat the most handsome cousin I have, alright?
A Martini rosso for me.
- Are your clothes really made of paper?
- Underneathas well?
They're real, you innocent.
- What would you say about having a look?
- Lets give them a tug.
It's true, they're made of paper.
Carroll! Why didn't you say Jean was here as well?
He really pestered me about when you'd be back.
I told him to leave you alone but he came anyway.
Why does it matter to you?
- I'm going.
- Why, Julie?
- Because I am.
- Julie!
Wait.
- Leave me alone.
- I'll take you home in my car.
No, go away.
Why?
Nothing brings us closer than having a vice in common.
I'm out of it, and now you make me sick.
Leave me alone!
Julie!
No, please.
Let him go.
You don't know Jean.
He likes hurting people.
What's up?
Aterrible nightmare but it's over so don't worry.
Julie tell me the truth.
What's wrong? Is it that man?
- Bye.
- Bye!
Next time don't wear paper, come in your birthday suit.
- Funny! Goodbye.
...Bye!
Goodbye!
Wait a minute! Give it to me.
No parking zone, obstructing traffic. You'll pay now?
No, for god's sake, we collect them.
Thanks.
Here it is.
There are more than a thousand policemen in this town!
I want all their autographs!
It's not that easy, you know.
You're completely mad!
Why? Seem strange to you?
I once went to bed with someone who collected ladies underwear. I realised he only wanted to be with me to steal my knickers.
Hey!
Give me the paper, will you?
- Here.
- Take it.
Thanks.
Let me have a look. Another woman murdered.
We should be grateful to this maniac for eliminating our competition.
They always write the same stuff and I don't read it, but if I don't buy a paper I miss it.
How I envy you, Carroll you're always so relaxed and cheerful.
No Julie you just take the best wherever you find it.
A little here, a little there and avoid thinking the worst.
I married Neil to finish with Jean.
Neil seemed so wise and calm.
But now I'm not so sure.
Neil's your husband, dear.
You can't expect to have everything from one man.
Carroll! Please...
The fact that you put someone between you and Jean is already really important
Yes I know, but maybe
I've got to escape from myself.
Jean would never accept not seeing me again because he can't stand losing.
Excuse me, madam. There's a gentleman waiting for you
I put him in the living room.
I don't want to see anyone.
He asked for your husband. I told him he was out but he wanted to wait to speak to you.
Come on! Who are you scared of?
If it's Jean we'll throw him out.
Come on, it'll be fun for me
Hello.
Look who it is, the handsome cousin.
My husband's not at home.
I'm sorry, Julie. But Carroll told me your husband is an expert in money problems.
I'd like to get his advice.
Yes, I see.
But I'm sorry, my husband's not here.
I'm glad, really...
To be honest it was just an excuse to see you again.
One definitely can't deny your quality of sincerity.
We interrupted our celebratory drink so I don't want to miss the chance to get to know you as well as I can.
Listen, my handsome cousin.
Given the time, if you want to court her
I recommend continuing over a steak.
Mr...
Call me George.
Don't worry you'll get a chance to speak to my husband alright?
Yes but it's you who should be worrying.
I like bothering women even when their husbands are around.
Shall we go, Julie?
In any case thanks, handsome cousin, for the lunch invitation.
For god's sake, I'd never invite anyone to Birri's.
They serve mustard which swells your tongue.
Why did you treat him like that?
Because I wanted to!
People who are too sure of themselves get on my nerves.
If I were you, I'd do it cousin or not.
Lets go and eat.
I am truly sorry, Miss Baxter. I had three tables left but a gentleman has just booked them.
So we'll have to starve.
Why?
The mustard's excellent here doesn't burn the tongue at all. Want some?
What a shame it's full.
But it isn't, I've booked three tables.
We can choose: Here, here, or down there.
- Did I make a mistake?
- If it's that important to you.
Yes, it is.
I was worried I'd have to give up my mustard.
Well, cancel the other two tables.
- Here alright?
- No, the other one's be tter.
The usual for me.
What Carroll's having is fine for me.
So, that's three of what Carroll's having.
This way you'll occasionally think of me when eating an apple.
The forbidden fruit.
For you I'll do...
...nothing at all!
You've got it all wrong, dear.
It's always been Eve who should offer the apple.
Excuse me, Miss Baxter.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back.
Maybe Carroll's right.
What's this? Does it mean you want to eat me?
No it means I've already eaten you.
You'll discover I'm hard to digest.
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush off.
In any case you're happier alone with your apples.
Oh, Carroll!
I'll phone you. Bye!
I can take you wherever you want.
To a taxi, thank you.
So you're used to having your own way, aren't you?
You've finally got it.
Where are we going?!
It's a surprise.
Take me home at once!
Later, Julie, later!
- I told you to take me...
- Relax.
I'm just going to make you feel ecstasy and fear!
Take me home now!
Ecstasy, fear and a pounding heart!
I kept my promises, didn't I?
I'll say you did!
I think I should apologise.
Ljudged you wrongly.
No, no! You were right about me.
But it's hard to resist so much.
Thanks anyway... it's been a nice afternoon. I really needed it.
Bye!
Hello?
Julie? Would you be amazed if I told you I loved you?
Oh please, George, don't be ridiculous.
Some words aren't used any more.
I thanked you for the nice afternoon and that's it.
I couldn't possibly want anything else from you.
Please leave me alone.
George?!
Don't be offended but I don't want to see you again because today... because I like you.
You mustn't phone me again. Never again.
Alright, Julie.
I won't phone again if that's what you want.
How did you get in?!
By the door, it was open.
Why are you...
I wanted to tell you again, Julie:
I really like you and I'm not used to hiding my intentions.
George I beg you don't complicate my life.
Don't you understand?!
I'm not the woman you met today.
I know nothing about you, nor do I want to.
For me you're fine as you are.
Come on, lets go into my place.
No, not now.
Let me go.
If you want if you want.
I'll take you home.
What's wrong?
I'm scared!
Scared of what?!
Take me away, George.
- Where?
- Wherever you want!
It's not a palace, is it?
But it's good enough for me.
I practically only come here to sleep.
They are for Mrs Wardh.
Thank you.
I know you're trying to escape me... but your vice is a room locked from the inside and only I have the key.
Who's the admirer?!
Anonymous.
I'd like to think it was you, but... they don't deal in these items on the stock exchange, do they?
Julie, what's the matter?
Nothing
You've been treating me as if I'd done something wrong.
If you feel uncared for or you need something we should talk.
No, I don't need anything.
Hello?
Mrs Julie Wardh?
Yes. Who is it?
I have had occasion to see that you are a delightful lover with very interesting perversions which I'm sure go unsuspected even by your honest husband.
Isn't that true?
Stop talking nonsense. Who is this?
That's not important, whereas I think you should know what I want, Mrs Wardh.
I want twenty thousand schillings to not tell your husband about your affection for George Corot.
It's Jean. It's you, I know it! It's Jean isn't it?!
Mrs Wardh, I will expect you at sunset at the
South entrance to Palmenhaus. Remember:
Alone, and with twenty thousand schillings.
But...
I didn't know what to do.
When I saw that black car I was scared it would be Jean, and that's why I went into George's.
Naturally. You wanted to go to bed with him and your fear of Jean gave you the excuse.
Please, Carroll.
Well, maybe it was as you said.
Anyway there's still the problem of the phone call.
It was Jean?
Who knows? Have you watched the tv?
They talked about that maniac. The last of his victims was that stupid bitch who stripped at the party...
Could it be Jean?
He's got a black car too.
Carroll please stop it.
I was joking.
He goes to prostitutes, and Jean doesn't.
What was his voice like on the phone?
Well... I've already told you.
It was a disguised, unrecognisable voice.
Which means if he'd spoken with his normal voice you'd have recognized him.
It must be Jean. He's the type.
I'm sorry but I don't see the problem. If you like
George you can forget about both Jean and Neil.
So what if Neil finds out?
I think he's a modern intelligent man.
Everything's simple for you.
While I don't know what George is for me,
I know what I was for him.
I wanted to call him this morning but I don't even have his number, and I haven't heard from him.
And I don't want Neil to find out this way.
He really doesn't deserve it.
Listen, dear, don't have too many scruples.
If you want his number I'll give it to you.
Neil's had you in his bed for a year. Don't you think that's enough to make up for the heartache?
When you talk like that I want to slap you.
But what do you expect? It's the way of the world.
Don't even bother about it,
I keep them in the oven because I hate cold underwear.
In any case you mustn't go to that appointment.
Where did he say?
At the Palmenhaus in Shembrun at sunset alone and with twenty thousand schillings.
I'll go.
You?
No it could be dangerous.
And I don't want you involved anymore.
Don't worry
I'll enjoy it. And you'll see it's definitely Jean and then I'll laugh in his face.
But if it's not Jean.
If it's someone else?
Who?
Maybe the sadist in the papers?
Then that means I'm in grave danger because I am a bit of a whore.
You joke about everything.
Had breakfast yet?
Well come on... there's a bar downstairs which will make you forget all about diets. Come on, and stop making that face!
There's the start!
The competitors immediately engage in a fight...
...and it's number 36 first, followed by number 122.
...at the third bend, the final battle is about to begin.
We're closing!
We're closing at sunset!
We're closing!
Excuse me
I had an appointment at the South entrance to the Palmenhaus but I've lost my bearings.
Over there but if you don't hurry you'll be locked inside.
They're about to close the gates now, so be quick.
- Thank you.
- Good eveni ng.
Help!
Help!
No!
What's going on?!
- Who was screaming!?
- There...
Look over there!
Can you tell us anything?
No, I didn't see anything.
Ljust heard that poor girl shouting. She'd asked me where the Palmenhaus South entrance was.
She had an appointment. I don't know anything else.
These little animals are my only friends, inspector.
Much less repugnant than certain people I know.
Listen... it's been said that you've been
Carroll Baxter's friend for a long time.
It's very important for us to know everything there is to know about her and the people she associated with.
Please follow me to the police station
I need to continue to interrogate you.
Don't worry, I'm used to being around cages.
So... shall we go?
Lets go.
Is all this really necessary?
So, madam... is this the man you spoke to us about?
Yes.
Why do you think he's the killer we're looking for?
You flatter me Julie.
Do you really think I'm capable of cutting a lot of women's throats?
Yes, you could be.
And though it might seem silly, he has a black car like the one described in the papers.
You're incredibly amusing.
But it was you who sent me those notes.
What notes?
The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship.
That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts, hoping she'd remember the good times, and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter.
I hate you.
The only thing I can't stand is indifference.
Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent like love, only more so.
Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place thinking that you were dealing with your friend...
Was it that man's voice on the phone?
It was disguised, it could have been anyone.
But Carroll told me it must have been Jean.
A stranger wouldn't have had to mask the voice.
Yes... but he was in a bowling alley on the other side of town while someone was cutting your friend's throat.
That's the way it is, I'm afraid.
Listen... why don't you check Mrs Wardh's alibi?
You're a dirty coward.
You see, Mrs Wardh doesn't have a black car, but she's always had a weakness for blood.
Nobody's said the murderer you're looking for is a man.
You're a...
...person you were keen on for over two years.
That's enough!
I'm not interested in your theories.
Fine.
Can I go?
- I've got something to do.
- Of course.
You can both go.
Bring the other one in. What's his name?
George Corot.
They called you as well?
Now I understand why my roses no longer affect you.
George Corot!
I've got to see you. See you at my place at five.
Julie, at last!
I'm really tired Neil...
Let me speak to your husband now then we'll go away.
Away from this city, from everything.
No, George, not now.
Maybe when they've found Carroll's murderer.
It was foolish to meet today.
I could be being watched.
You've told me there's already someone who knows... but do you realise that it should have been you instead of Carroll?
So what?
You can't hide forever.
Does living mean so little to you?
I don't know, George.
If you weren't around I'd almost be happy to end it all.
Please, they can see us here!
I'll take you home.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Neil!
Neil!
Julie!
The elevator was always busy so I had to take the stairs. Good evening.
Good evening.
Julie... where have you been? What happened?
Someone in the garage tried to kill me with a razor.
Was it Jean?
Did you see him? Was it him?
I don't know. He was dressed in black, it was dark...
I don't know!
Don't be influenced by the stories in the papers.
Besides, we'll soon know if it was Jean.
Neil!
What do you want to do?
Lets call the police.
Where does he live?
There's only one thing to do with people like that.
You mustn't take any risks for me.
You're my wife now, and that's all that matters.
Tell me where he is.
I'll go with you.
Alright, come with me.
Wait for me here.
Neil!
I told you to stay in the car!
No, I'm coming with you.
There are no lights on.
Nobody's there lets go.
There's a camera on the ground over there... a photo's been taken.
Julie! Julie, relax Julie!
Neil
Neil!
Jean's car has gone!
Adam and Eve lost paradise because they wanted to know too much.
Julie, wake up Julie!
I've developed that photo. Look!
Recognise him?
It's the man in the garage.
Yes, it's him!
Who?
Don't know. He was dressed like that, with those glasses.
Now we know it wasn't Jean.
Which means... he could be the murderer of the women and Carroll?
I mean I suspected Jean because he was your lover.
Obviously there's someone else.
Oh, Neil!
Where are you going?
I'm scared.
I'm going to the police.
This photo could be useful to the inspector.
Hello?
George, is that you?
Why did you take so long to call me?
I'll tell you when I see you.
Come and get me, I can't carry on.
Come and get me, and we'll leave.
We'll go to some quiet place as far away as possible.
Anywhere.
Okay.
Give me time to pack a case and I'll be with you.
I'll take you to Spain.
I know a little place that'll make you forget everything.
For Neil.
When did she leave?
Just before noon.
Bye, dear. I'll call you when I get back from Sydney.
Okay. Bye!
Hello?
Hello. How are you?
No, I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'll be back in a week.
Then I'll get the A122 toTokyo.
No. I'm not tired.
You don't sleep with the time zone changes.
The light's gone out... it'll come back on.
Alright!
Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir.
Will a kangaroo do?
Why, what do you want?
I promise we'll meet again when I get back.
Bye!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Has something happened?
No, no. Nothing.
Why did you run away?
I wanted to get some sun.
Carry on thinking about your prey if you want.
I've seen one who's more attractive.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
George!
Yes?
Look, they've found the maniac.
He was killed by the girl he was attacking.
So it's all over, for good.
So it's all over, for good.
Lets think about us.
I'm hungry.
I'll go on to the villa to prepare some food while you go and change some money. We've almost run out.
You take my car and I'll get a taxi.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye.
- Take them.
- Thanks.
These are for you.
For me?!
Yes, that gentleman gave them to me... he was there just now.
He was there just now.
He must have left.
Since the living don't give flowers to the dead, the dead give them to the living. Jean.
George.
George.
What's going on?
What's wrong? Do you feel sick, madam?
What's wrong? Do you feel sick, madam?
No, no!
Madam...
Julie!
Julie.
Julie answer me. It's George.
Julie, what happened?
Julie!
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
- Where can I find a doctor?
- Down there, at the pha rmacy.
Thanks.
This will make you sleep for a few hours.
What's wrong with her?
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
When I left her down in the village she was fine.
Well something happened maybe she got a fright.
Know what you can do? I'll give you a number!
Here it is.
Doctor Arbe. He's my friend, a good neurologist.
Barcelona's not far- by car you'd be there in half an hour.
Thank you. Can I leave her here while I go down into the village to call?
Don't worry. She'll sleep peacefully until this evening.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary. I know the road.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary. I know the road.
No, it's impossible. I've still got two appointments and I don't have a car. Tomorrow.
And I don't have a car. Tomorrow.
Please, doctor. I'll pick you up.
Alright, in an hour.
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
- How much?
- 80 pesetas.
George...
George!
George!
So I brought her here hoping she'd feel better far away from it all.
Then... I don't know what happened today.
You mentioned blood earlier.
She didn't say anything to me but I understood something straight away.
She was with that man I told you about for a while.
He dominated her.
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her it both attracts and repels her.
Listen it would be better not to tell her I'm a doctor.
It'll be easier.
Julie!
There's a smell of gas.
Quick, in the kitchen!
The door's locked. Help me!
Julie...
Turn the gas off and try not to breathe!
Open the window!
Lets take her there.
No pulse any more.
Call to quickly send an equipped ambulance.
- Is there any hope?
- I told you to go and call the hospital. Get on with it!
Inspector
Doctor Arbe is here
Very well, you can go.
Mr Wardh, this is Doctor?
He did everything to try and save your wife but it was already too late.
And I'm telling you it isn't suicide.
My wife was scared of dying.
The room was locked and sealed from the inside!
It wouldn't have happened if she'd been with me.
Anyway, this man's guilty.
I want to go now.
Of course, Mr Wardh.
The funeral?
The body needs to be available to the authorities for a few days then you can send someone to collect it.
George!
You're late.
I'll pay now.
It's too hot for me here.
A plane is leaving for Rio! I don't want to miss it.
Who are you scared of?
Nobody's expecting you to be in Vienna, and nobody saw you here.
If the police discover one day that the maniac didn't kill Carroll your alibi's already been checked out.
Like yours, and you're the only one with a motive.
Even if some cop unveils our tricks... you're out of it.
Your passport says you're called John McDonald, and Julie never met you.
But you've got a cast iron alibi too.
If they don't get me you're fine.
They won't get you.
Julie Wardh committed suicide.
The money, now!
Okay.
Now you really are dead.
A first-rate suicide for love.
Have they paid up?
Not yet.
They want the death certificate, it's a matter of days.
I spoke to New York.
Hope I can manage to keep the creditors sweet and avoid bankruptcy. And you?
No problems.
Carroll's death means I'm the sole heir.
We've got to be careful. If someone sees us together...
Why?
We're husband and lover united in memories.
There's no risk.
And there never was.
I told you, didn't I?
The best time to eliminate someone is when the police are hunting a homicidal maniac. We can help each other.
You eliminate the cousin and I eliminate the wife.
They're blaming it all on him... even though that idiot was caught before we finished the job.
The suicide idea worked perfectly.
Talking of which, our black suits?
Burned completely destroyed. There's no evidence any more.
Maybe it would be better to throw these gloves out.
I burnt mine.
Why? They're almost new.
Did you like my line at the police station?
"Anyway, this man's guilty!"
And how did poor old Jean take it?
Like a kick in the guts!
He was so stupid he still didn't believe he'd had it.
And if the Spanish police find him?
They'll found the motive for Mr McDonald's suicide.
It's crucial that the insurance claim is above suspicion or they'll drag it out forever.
What do you think they could suspect?
Your wife dies well after she'd left you, and you were miles away. And it was a clear-cut case of suicide.
Julie!
That woman!
It's her, I'm sure!
What are you talking about?
I only saw her briefly... it was her, Julie!
If you're starting to hallucinate already we'll end up badly.
No, it was her
I clearly saw her. Lets go back.
You're crazy.
There was just a resemblance.
...no!
- I've never heard of th e dead hitch-hiking.
Alright just a resemblance.
So what?
Lets have a look.
We're shafted!
Careful!
It's over, Julie.
Call and get them to send a breakdown crane
I'd never have reopened this investigation if our doctor hadn't given us about the different technique used by Carroll Baxter's murderer.
And there would have been three more criminals.
I'm sorry, but I had no other way to unmask them.
In thinking you were dead they felt safe and they betrayed themselves.
But most of the credit goes to Dr Arbe's who save you.
I'm leaving you in good hands.
You saved my life but I feel dead anyway.
You'll be able to forget everything.
Time is the best healer, Julie.
Good luck!
Essex!
Look!
What is it?
My God.
It's flying north!
I haven't seen one of those in years.
I didn't know there were any left.
Will we make it to the city?
If the dogs are out this far, there may be no city left
You're funny
What?
You've always told me you left the city because there was nothing for you there and now you are returning
Don't you think that's funny?
No
Tell me about your city
I already have
Again
There were 25 levels five sectors
In the center there was a park with a lake
And I remember the trees
Vivia?
Six
Seventeen.
- Limbo
- Shh-shh-shh
Blockade
Redstone you're in the tournament
Argo gratias.
You share the threat
You're up.
Me?
Good
Deuca
So soon?
My pleasure, sir
- Oh?
- Quintet!
Not your day, Ernecht
Better luck next time
- Your luck is better, Ambrosia
- Finally
A bonus
A new game is starting at table number six.
Vivia
Vivia!
- May have been a bad idea coming here
- It's a place to go
That's what you said
Essex
By knowing five numbers, you can find any person here?
Five numbers and a color code, yes
How many people lived here?
Five million.
Five million?
Yes. It was designed for a million people in each sector.
And you could find a person with only five numbers?
And a color code, yes
You know so much
But not how to find seals
Vivia!
Vivia?
Vivia?
Vivia!
Vivia?
You're not very good at finding people
Don't run off like that
- I was just playing
- I know
But don't run off that way
Shouldn't we help him?
He's gonna freeze to death
He already has
I'm so tired of walking.
It's not far.
And what if he's not there?
You don't even know if he's alive
We'll face that when we get to it
I'm hungry
Who is there?
My name is Essex
I'm looking for my brother
Name is Francha.
Does he still live here?
There is no one here by this name.
Could you tell me where he went?
What did you say your name was?
Essex.
Essex.
My God
Come
Come in
We have a fire
Come, come, come
Quick
Essex
I was sure you were dead
Are trains running anywhere?
Where have you been?
South, hunting.
I went 10, 12 years ago.
I lost count.
- I didn't know if you'd be here
- South, huh?
- What's to the south?
- Seals
Well, not anymore
How'd you find me?
Things have changed so.
- Information center
- That still works? No
It doesn't transmit
The information's still there
Oh, that's Vivia
I used to hunt with her father.
He's dead now.
Jaspera Aeon
Obelus
My brother
What's your name, child?
Vivia
We're hungry
Is there any food?
Of course
Jaspera, some food
Is the whole city like this?
Will I find work here?
I can't believe my eyes
So young
Nothing like her anymore.
She's the youngest person I've seen.
She could be the last one born, for all we know, the- the end of the line
This is a real event.
My God.
Jaspera Aeon
It's true.
It's alive
Feel it
How long, child?
Five months, at least
This calls for a celebration.
- We are a real family now
- Yes
Some booza
Set the table
Quintet, huh?
You play, of course
When my family was alive
But I wasn't very good
Well, never mind
There are six of us We'll play
The last seal we killed was just after Vivia's father died
I never saw an animal fight so hard to stay alive
Well, I've even forgotten what seal meat tastes like
That must have been-
Well, it was more than a year ago
I'm so glad you came when you did
Francha was just leaving for another tournament
The hell with the tournament
They can play without me for a while
They still have tournaments here?
Oh, yes
On all levels
What about work?
How do you stay alive?
We play!
There's nothing left but the game.
- Have you got pieces, Vivia?
- These will do
Oh, yes.
Sit. Sit, child.
Ah, some booza
This'll warm you
Here
That girl's a miracle
There's been no new life here and no hope for any
Oh, not in limbo, child
You're up in the killing circle
- Have you got pieces?
- I haven't played for years
Well, here
You can use these
From my collection
You collect Quintet pieces?
Oh, yes It's a hobby
Hobby?
What does that mean?
That's just something to do... for no reason
Come on, Essex
Let's play
I don't think I could put my mind to it.
All right We'll make you sixth man
You can play the survivor
Somebody'll have to go to the market for some more wood if we're to stay up.
I'll do it.
I wanna look around
There has to be work somewhere
There's a wood seller in the market below
Here
A thousand old sou a kilo
Don't let him cheat you
Make sure it's not treated
- Where'd you get-
- I've been very lucky in the casino
Essex?
I'm sure I'll be the first one to lose
Francha will look after you
- Be careful
- Yes!
We must be careful with a man who hunts seals where there are no seals
We'll roll on
Five, four
- Double limbo
- Double limbo
Ah Limbo five
One there, one there
Four, two I'll arrange the killing order for Essex
You see
I'm after you
- Can't be that important
- Hmm
Oh-ho!
You're after your own death!
Hello!
I need wood.
Buy or trade?
Buy
Enough for the night
- Two bundles.
- Is it treated?
Never been any complaints
- Treated with what?
- From a building.
This wood doesn't come from buildings
Taken out of the ice
Here you are
- I'm going to get you.
- No, you won't
Ohh!
At last the end is coming.
Where are you from?
- The south.
- The south?
They say there are still seals in the south. Is it true?
If there were, I'd still be there
Why do you torment me?
I broke no rules!
What?
Are you finding all the information you want?
The system is all but ruined
Trying to find a person or a place?
A friend
Oh A friend
How interesting
Amicus.
I haven't heard that word for a long time
And what do you use in its place?
Alliance
How did you and your friend become separated?
Time
Where does your friend live?
He doesn't
Redstone?
I'm a friend
- "Friend"?
- Yes. I know him.
I'm supposed to meet him here
Is he expected soon?
The tournament won't be over for many days or more.
They play at the old casino
He has a room... at the Hotel Electra.
Where's that?
Second sector
Red level
- Your-Your hand-
- Please don't
I haven't had a fire for-
When did you last see Redstone?
Yesterday
If you see him again-
What?
Yesterday
You won't
They still let rooms here?
Uh, Deuca
She's probably in the Quintet room
I really played the casinos.
Six and two
Is there a Deuca here?
- I'm Deuca
- Redstone
- Redstone?
- Yes.
He hasn't checked in yet
Well, something happened
I was delayed
You're lucky I still have a room
- May I have a key?
- There are no keys here
You're room 243
All right
- Four and six.
- Four and six.
This is one of the imponderables
You play, sir
"Redstone, Francha
'Deusha'- "
Deuca?
"Goldstar
St Christopher, Ambrosia"
Oh. I'm sorry.
I must have the wrong room
I was looking for a friend
I'm the only one here
This is my room
My name is Grigor
Perhaps the room I wanted is the next one over
But this is a nice room
Pardon me
- What's your name?
- Redstone
Redstone You're lucky to have a warm room, Redstone
Why don't you put that knife away?
I will tell you the truth
Redstone
What? That it was no mistake you came here?
I am afraid I have been playing the sixth man with you
I thought the room would be empty
I wanted to shave
There's no water
There is nothing but water and soon that's all that will be left
The planet will be frozen in an envelope of ice and that will mercifully be the end of this history
May I sit down?
- You don't stay here at the hotel?
- My room's at the casino.
I'm the adjudicator there, the referee
The judge, you might say
A judge?
I interpret the rules
I settle the disputes
It's a lonely thing to do
The worst thing is not playing- watching, game after game and not being allowed to play
That's why I come here on my days off.
There are very good players in this hotel
Some great ones, I tell you
Do you organize these tournaments?
Ah, you know about the tournaments.
I knew- I knew that you were a player
I saw that fire in your eyes
Only tournament players have that sense of life
I knew that you were in this room,
Redstone
See, I misrepresent without even knowing it
It is one of the problems of my work
One begins to lie even to friends
Forgive me, Redstone
I was looking for company
There is no camaraderie anymore.
No talk
No exchange of ideas or tactics
I meant no harm, my friend
Where do the explosives come from?
Explosives? Oh.
Alcohol
As long as the moss grows, they will make alcohol
And as long as there is alcohol, they will make explosives.
It's a waste
Come join me in a game and some alcohol
Deuca has booza
I know
- Deuca
- Yes.
Deuca.
Deuca-
She's very efficient, but nervous
Watch
She's always expecting the worst
But she's not to be underestimated
What took you so long?
We had to stop the game.
I was with my friend.
Yes, I know
Redstone
- Are we playing?
- Without question
But first, some drinks
I promised my friend some booza
- It's in the game room
- Good
Ambrosia
- You're sitting there alone.
- So I am
We are about to play.
You'll join us.
Deuca's bringing drinks
Booza
Ah He's my friend
Redstone
He's a new player
He doesn't look new
- Are you dangerous?
- No.
I don't like to play games.
I'm not dangerous.
That's good
I'm not dangerous either
My name is Ambrosia
It's a silly name
I think I should change it
Change
Everyone wants to change everything
There is nothing to change
Do you like your name...
Redstone?
Why not? It serves its purpose.
And mine doesn't.
You can sit here, Redstone
Drink carefully
This is the end of the bottle
Where's Grigor?
Maybe he found a better game
Let me have his share
What handsome pieces
Your own handiwork, Redstone?
- I inherited them
- Ah
- You have family?
- I had a brother here, but he's dead
So let's roll for the sixth man
Let the new player have the honor
Deuca seems to know that you're not dangerous
What are the stakes?
Sometimes we just play for the thrill of it
Weak roll, Redstone
You'll never make sixth man like that
- Quintet
- Automatic
I always play the sixth man
One, five
Five and four.
Six and two.
Four, five.
Six and three
So, I'll arrange the killing order
I want Deuca to kill you and I want you two to change place
Grigor?
Grigor, I have to talk to you
Listen to me
I need a ruling
This is frustrating
Never happened before
You knew Redstone as well as I did
Now we have this impostor to deal with
Does he know what he's doing?
You ask me so many questions
- Which one should I answer first?
- Damn it, Grigor
Redstone never should have been allowed in to start with
He was a fool He jumped the starting time by an hour
How do you know that?
Well, I- I was following him
Then so did you, St Christopher!
I didn't kill him until after the designated time
I was within the rules
Anyway, Redstone was a butcher!
He killed a whole roomful when he took Francha
Well, that's not an infraction
A sensitive player doesn't do that
Sensitive?
Did I hear you, of all people, use that word?
I play to win, but there are certain ethics to be considered
At this moment, if I were you,
I would be more concerned about Goldstar
- He has no ethics at all
- Nor brains
I do not consider him a threat
I find you insulting
He could get lucky
It's happened before
You're late, Grigor
Late for what?
Give me the booza
What about this new Redstone?
Drink
How do I deal with him?
Before I can decide that
I must learn how much he knows
Not how much he knows but who he is
Where is he?
- Who is "he"?
- You know who I mean Christopher
- Saint?
- St Christopher
He was standing there a second ago
Now he's gone
So he is
Which exit did he leave by?
I don't know that he left
I only know that, uh, he isn't here
Damn you, Grigor
You're trying to help him
You're always against me
You have no regard for me
I'm not here to help or regard
I am here to interpret rules
If it's help you need,
I suggest you talk to the sixth man
I find you despicable
I despise your arrogance!
It is as planned
There is an open seat at table number one
Grigor
St Christopher
Playing God
Move!
Out of my way, you fool!
Come on
Come on You cannot leave us
There's a better way to die
Come on
All you need is a five, and you have him
Then it's between you and Deuca
- A three and a two
- Good!
Now it's the two of you
She's been giving you good advice
It's obvious it's you she wants to face and not me
Are you so certain?
You're so predictable
I sometimes lose interest
That's not good
Run away from her, Redstone
Let her make the mistake
I get impatient I can't stand waiting around I said I didn't like games
Why do you play?
Education
- Four and a one
- Good! You got her
- Dead
- He's all yours, Ambrosia
So come, everybody
Put up the dead man
You only made one tactical error.
You killed her in your own sector
No one can protect you now
All I need is a one, and I win
One is my lucky number
Double one.
That's what I call overkill.
I got killed with one throw
That's very impressive
Being sixth man is an advantage
It's also boring
I just start to get excited, and it's all over
- Do you live near here?
- Yes
In this sector?
In this hotel
Room next to yours
How do you know what room I'm in?
Deuca told me
Deuca
Tell me about Deuca
I know her
You know a lot
And you are very curious
Do you know a man named Francha?
- Is he a Quintet player?
- Yes
I know a man named Francha
He lives in another sector
He comes to the casino quite often
- He's a very good player
- He was
Are you telling me he's dead?
No, I'm telling you he was killed
Good night, Redstone
Don't forget to bolt your door
Who is it?
- Who's in my room?
- It's all right. It's Goldstar.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
It's cold.
Do you have a blanket?
Nothing?
Nothing for me?
Nothing tonight.
I don't feel like drinking.
That was a very-
Now you're misreading my expression.
Everybody knows there are no locks in the hotel.
No locks, but tight security.
Obviously not as tight as you thought.
I waited half an hour before I could slip by without Deuca seeing me
I couldn't chance that
I hope you have as much luck leaving
Now, you say that, but you don't mean it
You're like all the rest
St Christopher- he's the worst
- He humiliated me tonight
- Is that possible?
He came to the casino with Grigor.
I was playing there
He came right in the same room with me
Of course, Grigor was there to protect him, which, of course, he's not supposed to do
Get off my bed and tell me what you're doing here so late
St Christopher
I'm going to enjoy killing him
Saint, indeed!
He thinks he can charm Grigor
Well, Grigor can't protect him for long
- Why are you coming to me?
- To ask you outright
Is there a plot against me?
If there is, you would know, and I protest it
It is not legal
I asked you to get off my bed
I don't trust Grigor
And I know St Christopher
Now, tell me
I know it's true
There's no plot that I know of, Goldstar.
And if there is,
I have nothing to do with it.
Don't be too sure
Don't you be too sure
Your day will come and before long we may be facing one another again under different circumstances
I've wasted my time coming here
Well, you may put the word out that I know what's going on
You may tell St Christopher that I'm after him
And don't be too sure you won't be far behind
Who is it?
- It's Redstone
- I'm not open yet.
- Well, can you let me in anyway?
- No.
Hello!
I'm looking for someone who lives at the hotel
- Who?
- St Christopher
He doesn't live in the hotel
He doesn't?
You know him then?
He runs a charity house in the fourth sector
Thank you
Help me
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
The geometric shape of the universe reflects the scheme of life
You've been taught that they are the same
You've been taught that the universe is bounded by five sides and that life has but five stages
Primum- the pain of birth
Secundum- the labor of maturing
Tercium- the guilt of living
Quartum- the terror of aging
Quintum- the finality of death
But this is not complete for five sides demand a sixth space a center and that is what you have to look forward to
What is the sixth space?
It's empty
It's blackness
Void!
In other ages equally ignorant it was said an eternal fire would follow death
But I tell you-
I tell you... there is no fire
I tell you, fire is not enough punishment
No
No, my sons!
The emptiness I'm speaking of is the total horror of madness the awareness of nothing
So, your wretched lives, in fact are supremely happy
It is your reward
You must cherish your tortured life because it is a pause, an interruption of the void preceding and following it
Don't fight.
Don't struggle.
Accept
When you think of the number five remember it is six
And if you look for an answer, look far beyond what facts you have... and add yet one more- the unknown
Because only when you consider the unknown you have a hope, a chance to solve the dilemma
Redstone!
You're far away from the hotel
Well, so are you
I used to live in this sector
I sometimes come here to remember
Is that helpful- to remember?
- Sometimes one can't avoid it
- Who's St Christopher?
I'm sorry
Did you hear me?
- I don't know him
- Oh, really?
I said I don't know him
I know who he is
I know he plays Quintet at the casino
Oh, this is nice
You know, there are people who say he's the best player alive
The man in your room last night said he was gonna kill St Christopher
- Are you spying on me?
- No, you woke me up
He said he was gonna kill St Christopher
That man is a very bad sport
Quite paranoid but harmless
Poor Goldstar is a bad loser
He has a passion for the game, but he'll never be anything but a mediocre player
The only way he can save face is to accuse someone like St Christopher of cheating
Very cowardly.
He seemed very convincing
Tell me-
Do I misunderstand the word "killing"?
Not if you understand Quintet
Do you want to come in?
I keep a bottle
All right
Please sit down
That's the man who was in your room last night
I can never get used to this mindless killing
Mindless? It's ritual.
It's a ritual killing
And they wanted you to see it.
Or me
There's a list
His name was on it-
"Goldstar"
My brother's name was on the list.
They bombed his apartment.
But there were others killed
One of them was just a girl who-
I saw the man who bombed it, and I chased him
When I caught up with him, somebody had slit his throat
There is a list, and anyone on it is marked, like he is
You must be wrong- trying to find a meaning where there is none
Death is arbitrary
At least, that has always been the main complaint
Your name is on the list too
Let's not think about it
Maybe it's better this way
To try to prolong life is pointless
In a few years, maybe months all dying will be done
I don't want to be alone
I can't!
W- Would you sleep here in my bed with me?
Mmm
Things have gotten so bad
It didn't used to be like this
I never think of the past
It's gone, but-
Maybe it's the closeness of another person
You make me think of life
You remind me of what we have lost
Something wrong?
It's not common to see people smile
I had a dream
I- I dreamed about my mother
We were together on a train
I was ahead of her and I- I turned around and I saw her walk up the aisle
She was younger than I am now
Very pretty
She wore a green hat
We didn't speak
We just smiled at each other
It was not at all sad
It was immensely pleasurable
When I woke up,
I had a smile on my face
I put up my hand, and I could- I could feel it
Do you dream about the past very often?
I never thought of it- whether I dream of it often or not
Memory is unreliable
I can't relate to my past
So much has changed
I would like to see my past clearly but I- I can't trust my memory
I think memory is the only thing you can trust
Do you still have hope?
Like a child
- Just a minute
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for St Christopher
- Come in
What do you want?
- Does this list belong to you?
- Yes
- Where did you get it?
- I found it
Then it doesn't belong to you
Did you steal it?
I have it That's enough
Your name is here
- It is of no interest to me
- It should be
- Goldstar
- Yes I know the name
Dead Murdered Francha
- I know the names
- Dead Murdered
Are there other lists?
Has it occurred to you that what you're doing is disruptive?
You'll never understand the scheme until you're part of the scheme
Are you telling me I will be?
Yes
At the exact moment where it will be too late
Redstone?
What a surprise to see you here
You lead a very active life, hmm?
Tell me, is St Christopher as good a player as they say he is?
- He is good, but too serious
- And not very talkative
Talk? Oh, if it is talk you want, come with me, Redstone
I know a place
We can have drinks and talk about life
Only thing I've seen is death or the prospect of it
But that's what makes life worthwhile
Every time you cheat death you feel the pure thrill of life
And that is what my job is
That is why I'm so content in this frozen world
Tell me, exactly what is your job?
To keep the game alive
The game is all that's important
The only intelligent expression left is the game of Quintet
All the elements of life are contained in it
Our art, our philosophy
All things of value fit the game
The game is the only thing of value
Come, come
Do I disturb you?
As a matter of fact, you do
The door wasn't bolted
It's collection time
I've come for the money
And you're very prompt
Did you think I wouldn't pay?
Redstone didn't
I was just in his room
He's gone, and I don't expect him back
He didn't sleep in his bed last night
He slept here with me
That's not possible
You have such a perverse sense of humor.
So do you
You weren't exactly discreet in presenting your victory over Goldstar.
That's so lovely
You must be proud to have such a treasure
Promise me you'll leave it to me
Isn't that very presumptuous... with St Christopher still present?
You're a dreamer, Deuca.
He's no Goldstar.
- St Christopher doesn't frighten me
- He should.
And Redstone will be back
I'll get another bottle, Redstone
Booza
Redstone
- Scheme Order
- Scheme?
What is the scheme?
Disrupting the order
Excuse me
I don't understand
To understand the scheme you have to be part of it
- Part of it?
- Uh-huh
- You're not making any sense
- You're part of it See, the list
Is the list part of the scheme?
- Are you all right?
- Do other people have the list?
But I don't understand you
What are you talking about?
No Think of five
Hmm?
- Yes
- It's six
Are you all right?
Consider the unknown
- The goose
- The goose?
The goose
Does he know where he's going or does he just fly into the unknown?
With all due respect, Redstone,
I don't understand what you're talking about
Oh, maybe you had too much booza
What a coincidence and what a surprise.
Look.
A surprise, but not a coincidence
Nah, maybe it's the other way around.
He is here to help people, see.
His work brings him here.
Does your work bring you here? Hmm?
You're drunk, Redstone.
I brought you here
Don't you remember?
Yeah, I-
Yeah-
St Christopher
Redstone is drunk
He is in need.
You must help him home.
I must help him home?
You can't be serious
Are you not St Christopher, protector of the needy?
He's helpless
He needs protection
He certainly looks helpless, but he's not Redstone.
Don't anticipate my ruling
Remember, he lives in the hotel
Room number-
I know what room he lives in
Oh, don't be so serious,
St Christopher
Does not Deuca live in the Hotel Electra also?
Come up
Come Let's go
Deuca!
Deuca!
Be seated, please
You may begin
I am the winner of the front game... and I'm prepared to meet the sixth man.
Are you prepared?
I am prepared
But the front game is not played out yet
Redstone is still alive
Redstone is dead
I killed him
Where's the proof?
An impostor is carrying his markers.
Are you suggesting
I kill him as well?
If you are to meet me
It would be a digression
How do we know he won't kill you?
He won't Killing the impostor is a mere formality
I think you're afraid to face me
I'm afraid of nothing here
The unknown at least holds hope
Hope?
Hope is an obsolete word
I demand a judgment
The impostor
Even though he has not chosen to play the game he is in it
It is like life
None of us are in it by choice
The man who carries Redstone's markers is Redstone.
His life is not important outside the game
So be it
You look so sad, Ambrosia
On the contrary, Grigor
I am supremely content
I know how the game will end.
How?
You'll see
Redstone! Wait!
Wait!
- Where are you going?
- To my brother's house
- What for?
- To look for something.
There's something
I have to understand
Understand?
Is that important now?
St. Christopher will kill you if he sees you.
If he'd wanted to try to kill me, he would've done it last night
He had the perfect chance
Last night is not today
Redstone!
My name is Essex
That was yesterday
Today you are Redstone
Are you prepared?
Death doesn't wait
We already had four
Remember?
You're number five!
Primum! Remember?
It was Francha! Butchered!
Secundum- death of a coward!
Tercium- the stupid one!
Ah, quartum, that was Deuca!
Oh, Deuca was an artistic death
But yours?
What game are you going to play... you hunter of seals, huh?
Have you found what you're looking for?
Yes, I have
Did you meet St Christopher?
He's dead
And now do you understand?
You mean, the game?
Can I see what you have found?
Grigor!
You shouldn't have brought her here
Take that body out of here
It's proof
I won
What's the prize?
Prize?
Winning?
Being alive- that is the only prize
You play for the thrill of it.
It is life itself.
It is feeling the heat of the adrenaline rushing through your body
Life can only be felt when death is near.
That is what the game of Quintet is- those who play fight for their lives
And that is what you have learned
Is it not?
Tell me about that- the heat of adrenaline rushing through your body
That should do it for you.
The smell of death- that's about as close as you ever get to it
Someone has to be the adjudicator
Someone has to be the judge
It is my humble job
"Humble"?
I'm not sure you're even human
Why are you going?
There is nowhere else to go.
There is nothing more to be gained.
There is nothing more to be learned
So searching is pointless.
It is like spending the game in limbo... throwing an infinite combination of sixes
You could be the greatest player of all
New tournaments are starting right now!
Pity
Where are you going?
- North
- North?
There is nothing there.
You won't last a day and a half
You'll freeze to death
You may know that
I don't
