       Did you see that?
      She stuck her tongue
           out at me!
I waved at that little kid and she stuck her tongue out at me.
    Boy, if I could get off
           this bus,
       I'd go back there
   and punch her lights out.
             [bang]
   Why are we stopping here?
    Hey, Chuck, we've had
    a blowout or something.
    I'm going to bring down
       her window shades.
  I'm going to dim her outlook
   and shorten her life span.
     I'm going to rearrange
         her landscape.
       On the other hand,
         I didn't know
     she was going to bring
       her gang with her.
 I'll confuse her with a silent
     but dignified retreat.
      [children shouting]
      I don't believe it.
      What are we doing on
     this ridiculous trip?
    Look! Nothing around us
           for miles.
         This is crazy!
          I feel like
      I've been hijacked.
           [snapping]
          [squawking]
           [laughing]
           Go ahead.
           After you.
            Snoopy,
    don't stay back too far.
         From here on,
   it's pretty rough country.
              Hey!
     Hey, don't forget me!
     Come back! Come back!
         You forgot me!
    We're all going to die!
           Watch out!
              Aah!
            Oh, no!
         Oh, watch it!
           Aah! Ooh!
          Aah! Oh, no!
              Oh!
              Aah!
              Aah!
            Oh, no!
         Ah, watch out!
              Aah!
              Aah!
              Aah!
             [bang]
          [sputtering]
        [engine starts]
 Why can't I have a normal dog
      like everybody else?
           Hey, kid.
    Watch what you're doing.
 You pushy, or something, kid?
     What's your name, kid?
         Charlie Brown.
  Hey! Get a load of this kid
      with the weird name!
         Charlie Brown!
           [laughter]
            [gulps]
 What are you here for, Brown?
     Have you come to camp
      to try and be a man?
           [laughter]
      Attention, everyone.
           Attention.
         Line up for
    your registration forms.
     Fill in all questions,
     including your reasons
      for coming to camp.
          I was wrong.
    I haven't been hijacked.
       I've been drafted.
     OK, kid. Knock it off.
 You're making too much noise.
       Did you see that?
Did you see what they just did?
        - Well, I, uh...
      - They insulted me!
        Slug those guys!
     Show 'em their place.
  Give 'em a knuckle sandwich,
          big brother.
      Look, kid, get this,
        and get it good.
       We run this camp.
    We were Number One Tent
         two years ago,
  and we were Number One Tent
           last year,
       And we're gonna be
Number One Tent This year, too.
       - Now, look here.
- Let 'em have it, big brother.
      Hey, guys. Get this.
  This kid with the round head
        wants to rumble.
      Go get him, Brutus.
     Yeah, you're so smart,
          you bullies.
   Wait till my brother's dog
           gets here.
      Boy, he'll show you.
         Here he comes.
  He'll take care of your dog.
      Go get him, Brutus.
 What seems to be the trouble?
     Look, kid. Get in line
  and mind your own business.
       Back! Back! Back!
   Isn't he the cutest thing
      in the whole world?
  Fastest blanket in the West.
          What a trip.
   Here we are doing a paper.
         We could have
       stayed in school.
       Don't worry, kid.
   They just want to find out
      something about us.
     They have to know what
 sort of things we like to do.
     I'm going to put down
     a lot about baseball.
    They'll probably make me
      captain of the team.
 How come they don't have trips
   where you just stay home?
          If you want
 a better way of life, Marcie,
    you always have to cross
           an ocean.
          Or a desert.
         Or a mountain.
      Sometimes, however,
 your whole life can be changed
  by crossing a crowded room.
That's a romantic thought, sir.
        Is it original?
       I don't think so.
   And stop calling me "sir".
  Hey, Chuck, give us a hint.
      What did you write?
Well, I don't know if I should.
 It's kinda personal, you know.
      Oh, come on, Chuck.
 We're close friends, you know.
           Well, OK.
   "I decided to come to camp
     because I've ever been
       much of a person.
    I thought coming to camp
     would help me grow up
     and maybe even make me
        into a leader."
          I could use
     leadership qualities.
 You can say that again, Chuck.
    You couldn't lead a dog
          on a leash.
Attention, everyone. Attention.
      All campers must be
         in their tents
         by 2200 hours.
     I've never made a bed
          in my life.
    Do they have directions?
          By the way,
 it's a little chilly in here.
    Where's the thermostat?
   Hey! We're supposed to be
          roughing it.
There's no thermostat in a tent.
           OK, gang.
   I suggest we run this tent
    in a democratic fashion.
    The first thing we'll do
    is elect a tent leader.
     We'll have to prepare
         some ballots.
       And we'll do this
        democratically.
We'll vote to see who's leader.
       One gal, one vote.
            However,
   we can't pass the ballots
until we've voted to see who's going to pass the ballots.
       This will be done
      very democratically.
          Let's see...
        I vote that Lucy
     prepares the ballots.
 Wait a minute. You can't vote
    unless we have ballots.
If we can't vote to see who will
pass the ballots, how can we have ballots to vote?
        Yeah! Who cares?
    All in favor say "Aye".
             - Aye.
             - Aye.
              No!
              No!
         It's settled.
  Lucy will pass the ballots.
           OK, Lucy.
       Pass the ballots.
  Everybody mark their choice.
       Either vote for me
         or against me.
        That'll be fair.
     Wait one darn second.
           How about
 if we nominate somebody first?
           Good idea.
         I nominate me.
    Any further nominations?
    If not, the nominations
      are declared closed.
     OK, gals, let's vote.
  Marcie, pick up the ballots
        and tally them.
           All right,
   Here's the way it went...
       One vote for Lucy,
            one vote
     for Peppermint Patty,
      one vote for Sally,
    and one vote for Marcie.
        Hmm, a tie vote.
   I guess I'll have to cast
       the deciding vote.
              Huh?
       The deciding vote
    is for Peppermint Patty.
Peppermint Patty is the leader.
        I am the leader.
    It was fair and square.
        Boy, some vote.
     As the elected leader,
     I propose we get busy
       and make the beds.
     Hey, one moment there.
       I propose we vote
        on whether we do
      or do not make beds.
        Marcie, prepare
      the secret ballots.
         Now hear this!
         Now hear this!
   Tomorrow morning, everyone
    will rise at 0500 hours.
          What's 0500?
           Noon time?
Nope. It's 5:00 in the morning.
      5:00 in the morning?
         I don't get up
    at 5:00 in the morning.
     Maybe I should resign.
            [yawns]
      Hey, how about that?
          A waterbed.
      Boy, this is great.
 They really know how to treat
    a leader in this outfit.
     Boy! I get a waterbed.
          I tell you,
   this modern army is great.
          OK, troops.
    Let's get some shut-eye.
  This will be an experience.
 You know, I hate to admit it,
    but I can't go to sleep
without having my mother come in and kiss me good night.
     I know what you mean.
       It's always easier
         to go to sleep
      if someone comes in
   and kisses you good night.
        Oh, good grief!
              Ugh!
              Ugh!
        - Quit pushing!
             - Ow!
       Sir, you're making
        too much noise.
 Can't you kiss him good night
     and let it go at that?
If I ever get off this waterbed,
  I'll kick him not kiss him!
        Marcie, help me
     get off this waterbed.
              Aah!
              Aah!
              Ugh!
           [snoring]
       [ Reveille plays]
           [snoring]
       I think it's time
        to get up, sir.
       Marcie, I know it,
    and will you please stop
       calling me "sir"?
     Attention! Attention!
        Turn out for PT!
        Turn out for PT!
     Attention! Attention!
        Turn out for PT!
       All right, troops.
         On the double.
         On the double!
           Turn out!
        What's this now?
         The infantry?
            Sir? PT?
    What in the world is PT?
    PT is physical training.
     You know... Exercise.
       Come on. Let's go.
     Hup, two, three, four.
     Hup, two, three, four.
     Hup, two, three, four.
     Hup, two, three, four.
     Hup, two, three, four.
           Hup! Hup!
         Hup, hup, hup!
           Hup! Hup!
         Hup, hup, hup!
 Nothing like a little workout
    to build up an appetite.
     A rousing breakfast is
  a good way to start the day.
       All that exercise
   made me lose my appetite.
 Do you think we could transfer
    out of this outfit?
           Hup! Hup!
         Hup, hup, hup!
           Hup! Hup!
         Hup, hup, hup!
     If you want a wallet,
     why can't you just go
 to the store and buy one? Aah!
     Attention! Attention!
      Lunch will be served
         at 1200 hours.
     I like the chow line.
            Blurgh.
   It's like I told you, kid.
        We're number one
    and don't you forget it.
           [growling]
       Back! Back! Back!
        Now hear this...
Tent competition will now begin.
 The first event is tug of war.
        Tent number one
    against tent number 13.
          Good grief.
           That's us.
        Hey, that's us!
    Yeah! We're number one!
       ¶ It's a new day ¶
         ¶ You're about
        to face a test ¶
       ¶ It's a new day ¶
       ¶ You've got to do
          your best ¶
       ¶ But if somehow ¶
      ¶ you don't come out
            on top ¶
       ¶ keep on tryin' ¶
   ¶ 'cause we're behind you,
        Charlie Brown ¶¶
       We're number one!
              Yay!
       We're number one!
        Ready... Set...
              Go!
    This is the dumbest game
        I've ever seen.
        Come on, Marcie.
         Up and at 'em.
         You can do it.
     - You know what, sir?
            - What?
 I wasn't born to be a potato.
         I can't do it!
    Sure you can, kid.
        Just keep at it.
        That's it.
   We're going to catch 'em.
     Hey, they're cheating!
       We're number one!
       We're number one!
       We're number one!
       Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
            [gulps]
The next event in the competition is the good one.
      We won it last year
 and we'll win again this year.
        You bet we will.
       It's a sure thing.
   We'll really have to work
     to beat those bullies.
      They win everything
          By cheating.
     Attention! Attention!
         The main event
      in tent competition
      will start tomorrow.
          This will be
      the raft river race.
             - Yay!
          - All right!
  Prepare your rafts by 1800.
  I wasn't even born in 1800.
 Linus, we don't have a chance.
   I've just seen their raft.
       No wonder they win
     this race every year.
 I just checked out their raft.
     You can't believe it.
       Direction finders.
             Radar.
       Sonar. The works.
This is going to be a pushover.
This is the easiest competition
          we ever had.
 Yeah, we'll walk all over 'em.
   I think we loaded the raft
           too soon.
 Our tubes aren't inflated yet.
   Where can I put my piano,
         Charlie Brown?
 Gee, I don't know, Schroeder.
  Wherever you can find room.
We don't have room for a piano.
          Well, then,
   if we're so short of room,
       maybe we shouldn't
   take your blanket, either.
Put the piano right over there.
             Ready?
             Ready.
              Aah!
           All right.
       All together now.
         One last poof.
         One more time.
      That will show them
        a thing or two!
  I'd love to see their faces
        in the morning.
        We'll show them
      who runs this camp.
        We'll show them
     who's boss round here.
 Those villains stole our air.
         Quick, Marcie.
     Hand me the air pump.
Here I want to be a good leader,
 and I see nothing but failure
             ahead.
   Don't fret, Charlie Brown.
          As they say,
  it's not if you win or lose,
   but how you play the game.
   This is gonna be a cinch.
They're just a bunch of softies.
     That round-headed kid
           is a joke.
      We'll wipe 'em out.
     Attention! Attention!
All participants to your rafts.
    How come didn't he say,
"Gentlemen, start your engines?"
           [growling]
        On your marks...
           Get set...
              Go!
     See you later, dummy.
    Yeah, in about two weeks
  when you finally get there.
      [engine sputtering]
       What's the matter
    with the stupid engine?
  Come on! Come on! Let's go!
     I think... I think...
      [engine sputtering]
       - [engine starts]
     - I got it! I got it!
      Let's go! Let's go!
         - Stop! Whoa!
             - Hey!
     See you suckers later.
    Everything in this raft
          will be run
     in democratic fashion.
  See that fork in the river?
    We're gonna vote to see
   if we take the right fork
       or the left fork.
             Lucy,
  prepare the secret ballots.
   Now pass out the ballots.
 Everybody mark their ballots.
          OK, Marcie.
       Tally the ballots.
     One vote we go right.
      One vote we go left.
     One vote we go right.
        I know my vote.
       I vote we go left.
          Good grief!
       That's a tie vote.
             [thud]
  What's the matter with you?
  How can we have a tie vote?
  Lucy, pass out new ballots.
      The vote is whether
  we get off the reef or not.
    Marcie, tally the votes.
 One vote to get off the reef.
 Two votes to get off the reef.
Three votes to get off the reef.
Four votes to get off the reef.
     Well, at least this is
       a unanimous vote.
   I'm glad I'm part of such
   a democratic system, sir.
   This all restores my faith
      in good government.
           OK, gals.
   Let's get the raft afloat.
              Hmm.
          I'm scared!
       I hope those lions
      and tigers out there
    mind their own business.
       Don't worry, kid.
       Nothing out there
        to worry about.
You know, gang, I have a feeling
 we're going to win this race.
        I think we have
    too much muscle for 'em.
    I want to be with Linus.
          I'm scared.
     Sally, there's nothing
        to be scared of.
         I don't care.
  I just wish Linus were here.
[Sally] Don't forget me, Linus.
     If we get in trouble,
     I'm depending on you.
        Oh, good grief.
    Of all the rotten luck.
     Stop talking and push!
 Hey, who do you think you are?
            Come on.
       Let's push. Push!

          Hey, Chuck.
        What about this?
      You think we should
       go up this alley?
      If the sign says so,
   that's what we should do.
  But it seems to take us away
     from the main stream.
There it is in black and white.
      I think we should do
       as the sign says.
   Besides, I just saw Snoopy
 disappearing around the bend.
            Come on.
          Let's go on.
         That's funny.
     Did you see that sign?
          Hey, Chuck.
     Did you see that sign?
       What day is this?
         That's right.
       Today is Tuesday.
 Chuck, did you see that sign?
    What time is it, Chuck?
         It's almost...
          ...10:00 am!
           OK, Chuck.
       Another fine mess
     you've gotten us into.
         Look at that.
  The channel is all blocked.
   Yeah, just like his head.
           [cheering]
           Hey, look!
   They're still ahead of us.
       Let's go get 'em!
      Let's go! Let's go!
           [thunder]
   What kind of place is this
         to be lost in?
We can't even plug our iron in.
           - [static]
       - And now the news
    about the big storm that
    hit this area yesterday.
    Heavy rains have caused
         flash flooding
      in the back country.
     Travelers' advisories
    call for extreme caution
       for all travelers.
   Gee. I hope the other kids
         are all right.
         I haven't seen
    any of the other rafts.
  I wonder how Snoopy's doing.
          [straining]
         You lazy bums!
            Help me!
    Get back there and push.
    Get back there and push,
           yourself.
 So you want to get tough, huh?
 I guess I'll have to teach you
         a few manners.
           Take this!
           [shouting]
 Hey! Look! We've got to catch
       those other rafts.
        We're gonna lose
  if we fight with ourselves.
Yeah, we've got to get this raft
       back in the water.
           [grunting]
          Pull! Pull!
          I'm pulling!
          I'm pulling!
            [howls]
           [whistles]

             [caw]
             [caw]
           Hey, look!
     There's Snoopy's raft!
         They're gone!
         I see the boys
       on the beach, sir.
       Shall I hail them?
Hey, they're looking at a tube.
     Maybe they got a flat.
          Hey, there!
       You need any help?
           Hi, Chuck.
  What are doing on the beach?
  I think Snoopy and Woodstock
           are lost.
      This is their raft,
    and we can't find them.
          Hey, troops,
         You hear that?
      Snoopy and Woodstock
           are lost.
         Lucy, pass out
      the secret ballots.
The question before the group is
 do we join Chuck on the search
   or do we hunt on our own?
       Mark your ballots.
          Good grief.
     What's going on here?
    Marcie, tally the vote.
  One vote for we go it alone.
One vote for we go with Linus...
 Well, I think Linus needs me.
   We should all join Linus.
        Oh, good grief.
    One vote we go it alone.
      One vote we go home.
        The vote is in.
     The mandate is clear.
        We go it alone.
           OK, Chuck.
We'll help in the search.
    Your team goes that way.
   My team will go this way.
        Come on, troops!
        Let's find 'em!
           Follow me!
          [squeaking]
         Hey, watch it!
           Look out!
              Ow!
   I recommend caution while
  we're in this rocky region.
             - Huh?
       - These rocks are
   a perfect breeding ground
        for rock snakes.
       What in the world
        is a rock snake?
When it sneaks up behind you and throws a rock at you... Boy!
   They're not too dangerous,
            though.
       Most of the time,
they hit you on the lower part of your legs.
            Snoopy!
       [echoing] Snoopy!
            Snoopy?
             Hmm...
       Not here, either.
          Hey, Snoopy!
     [echoing] Hey, Snoopy!
            [howls]
            [growls]
           [knocking]
           [knocking]

           [growling]
          [screaming]
      Linus, where are you
    when I really need you?
         Relax, troops.
      We got to get a hold
         of ourselves.
   It's only bears and tigers
          out there...
          [screaming]
  ...and they're as frightened
             of us
       as we are of them.
     Let's face it, troops.
    We haven't found Snoopy,
   and now we're just as lost
           as he is.
     But let's keep moving.
     Keep together, troops.
            Snoopy!
       [echoing] Snoopy!
           [howling]
           [howling]
          [squeaking]
            Snoopy!
       [echoing] Snoopy!
     I think this would be
      a nice place to rest
 and also use as headquarters.
        We could fan out
       in search parties
     until we find Snoopy.
  Yeah, till we find somebody
        or they find us.
       Hey, look at that.
          I see smoke!
           A chimney!
   Troops, we've been found!
      Yes, can I help you?
      Hey, Chuck, it's me!
      Chuck, we found you!
      You were lost, kid,
      but we're here now.
      No! We weren't lost.
     You're delirious, kid,
        but we found you
      and now you're safe.
   Say, how about that getup
        you got on, kid?
         Don't tell me
    you're doing housework.
  This is a pretty ratty house
      you got here, Chuck.
          OK, troops.
         We found Chuck
    and he's very grateful.
 I'm sure he's going to give us
       a vote of thanks.
           Eh, Chuck?
          Well, Chuck,
   ain't you got any manners?
   Are we gonna stay out here
           all night?
          Come on in.
We're just about to have dinner.
       Will you join us?
       Hey, you got quite
      a place here, Chuck.
 It won't offend you if we stay
   with you, will it, Chuck?
          Hey, Chuck.
    What's this, dry cereal?
    For dinner, dry cereal?
       What's the matter
        with you, Chuck?
    Don't you know anything
         about camping?
    Where's the corn willie?
  Don't you have any C rations
         or K rations?
      OK, troops, at ease.
       Let's have a meal
        with these guys.
   But tomorrow, we'll treat.
         Boy, tomorrow
      we'll show you guys.
   We'll show you how you're
 supposed to eat when camping.

         [spluttering]
           [groaning]
    Hey, Chuck, I'm getting
      to like your shack.
         It sure needs
    a woman's touch, though.
   Hey, Chuck, look at this.
        How about this?
           Charmaine.
 I don't suppose you even know
    what a waltz is, do you?
          Well, uh...
       I guess it's a...
              Hey!
              Hey!
             - Hey!
             - Hey!
             - Hey!
             - Hey!
              Hey!
        [¶ waltz plays]
    Are you going to ask me
         to dance, too?
        I think perhaps
    I might ask you to dance
          if you were
    the last girl on Earth.
    Schroeder, are you going
      to ask me to dance?
     Musicians don't dance.
     I wonder if anybody's
   going to ask me to dance.
Boy, that kid really can dance.
     And he sure knows how
     to make a girl happy.
        Isn't it strange
      how things work out?
         Here we were.
       We were all lost,
   and we were all separated.
        And for a while,
 it looked like we might never
     see each other again.
 It even looked like some of us
  might never get home again.
      And now here we are
all together again in a safe cabin by a warm fire.
      You just never know
 how things are gonna work out.
  It sort of makes you think.
    What's he talking about?
         I don't know.
   I wasn't really listening.
  Oh, he was saying something
        about the fire.
     I honestly don't know.
   I never really ever listen
      to anything he says.
    Look, Chuck, instead of
    all this serious stuff,
   how about a campfire song
    before we hit the sack?
             Um...
         Hey, maestro!
   How's about a little tune
    to liven up the evening?
       That's what I like
       about you, Chuck.
        You really know
     how to throw a party.

       [raucous laughter]
         Well, troops,
   it's time to take a vote.
  Prepare the secret ballots,
             Lucy.
         What's wrong?
        Why the ballots?
         We'll do it in
  a democratic fashion, Chuck.
   We'll vote to see whether
     you guys sleep outside
      or we sleep inside.
   OK. Lucy, pass the ballots
        out to the gals.
         Wait a minute!
      What about the boys?
  This is a democratic outfit,
             guys.
   We vote on all activities,
            us gals.
   If you guys want to vote,
     get your own ballots.
        OK, gals. Vote.
       Mark your ballots.
        Good grief.
  OK, the ballots are marked.
    Marcie, tally the count.
     Vote for guys outside,
          gals inside.
     Vote for guys outside,
          gals inside.
     Vote for guys outside,
          gals inside.
      And I know my vote.
     It's for guys outside
        and gals inside.
             Great!
     A unanimous decision!
    Chuck, you guys pick up
    your junk and move out.
      Hey, wait a minute!
      It's cold out there!
 Besides, we found this cabin,
    and we were here first!
 Look, here. You saw the vote!
It was done legal and straight.
  Do you believe in democracy?
       Well, sure, but...
     Well, Chuck, this was
       a democratic vote
 and it says you guys are out.
 All you guys, pick up and get.
This cabin is off-limits to you.
         Out! Out! Out!
     See you guys tomorrow.
     OK. If that's the way
       they want to play,
      we'll sleep outside.
            Come on.
        Let's make camp.
          Back! Back!
             Back!
        The worst storm
       of the past decade
           has struck
      the high mountains.
 Travelers in the high country
      should put on chains
          immediately.
         Put on chains?
Being lost up here in the middle
    of nowhere isn't enough.
   We gotta wear chains too!
       Good grief, Sally.
    Don't you know anything?
     They're talking about
       mountain climbing.
       Mountain climbers
       chain each other.
So if one falls, they all fall.
       Boy, are you dumb.
   OK, troops. Time for chow.
    Let's go find the guys.
         Maybe they got
       breakfast started.
 Hey. Reminds me of Christmas.
    Maybe we should pick out
       a Christmas tree.
        Great. Let's get
     a big one painted red.
  No. I want one of the short,
           fat ones.
         From up here,
      we get a good view.
   Let's pick out our trees.
 Hey! It's Chuck and his gang.
    Chuck, what's going on?
    What are you guys doing
     burrowing in the snow?
Look! You took our cabin, and we froze out here all night.
          OK, fellas.
   Let's get some breakfast.
       Great idea, Chuck.
        What's for chow?
          Well, Chuck.
     You've done it again.
          Cold cereal.
    We need a hot breakfast.
    Where are the hot cakes?
 Where are the bacon and eggs?
Where are the huevos rancheros?
      Now, just a minute!
  Nobody's asked your opinion!
       If you don't like
        what we've got,
   you don't have to eat it!
       No offense, Chuck.
Just a natural feminine reaction to a most deplorable situation.
     We were saying, Chuck,
 that now would be a good time
  to get us a Christmas tree.
Yeah! I was saying a good, big red one would be the thing.
        There are a lot
     of nice fat ones, too.
        Christmas trees?
         Are you crazy?
         We're supposed
      to be having a race.
    Have you forgotten that?
       We're number one!
       We're number one!
              Yay!
  See you jokers after we win!
        See you around!
            [laughs]
 Come on! We've got to get back
          in the race.
       We're number one!
       We're number one!
              Yay!
   Quick. Let's form a chain
       and get the raft.
         Hurry, hurry!
         Form a chain!
         Get the raft!
      Get the raft, Chuck!
     Don't miss it, Chuck!
          Swim for it!
     Get it, Charlie Brown!
             - Aah!
        - You blockhead!
 You missed it, Charlie Brown!
         He missed it!
      We've lost the race!
              Aah!
        Chuck, you can't
       do anything right.
         I'll save it.
       I'll get the raft.
You'll do it, Peppermint Patty!
    Peppermint Patty did it!
       She saved the day!
      We've lost the raft!
    And we've lost the race!
             Help!
         Lucy, prepare
      the secret ballots.
       What's the matter
        with you girls?
   We're freezing and you're
 talking about secret ballots.
 The question before the group
  is whether we allow the boys
       to join our party
       or we leave them.
      Didn't you hear me?
        We're freezing!
Chuck, it's all very democratic.
   Either we leave thee here
            to rot,
or we invite you to join us and help celebrate our victory.
           OK, gals.
       Mark your ballots.
    Marcie, tally the votes.
A vote to have the boys join us.
A vote to have the boys join us.
          Another vote
   to have the boys join us.
          And my vote
    will make it unanimous.
         OK, you guys,
        welcome aboard.
 Gee, that's really big of you.
  Oh, come on, Charlie Brown.
      We can't waste time.
     We've got to catch up
        with those boys.
           OK, Chuck.
    I hope you're happy now
      because I've decided
 you're going to be our leader.
        You should start
       leading us, Chuck.
    If you're a good leader,
    this is what you'll do.
  Yeah! If you're going to be
    a leader, start leading!
A good leader always listens to
         his followers.
 All right, I'll be the leader.
 I'll try to plan our strategy.
     I see that one of our
   competitors is passing us.
       What do you intend
        to do about it?
 You're the leader now, Chuck.
       You're the leader
 and you'll tell us what to do,
        and we'll do it.
     Come on, Chuck, lead.
       Lead, Chuck. Lead.
  That's the way, Chuck, yeah.
     Get up there in front.
       That's it, Chuck.
        You're leading.
      Boy, what a leader.
        Lead on, Chuck.
         That's enough!
      The boys will paddle
 on either side and I'll steer.
       That's it, Chuck.
        You tell us.
         We all follow.
  Hey! There's that screwy dog
           behind us!
  Hey, where did he come from?
          [squeaking]
           [shouting]
           [laughing]
   There's a short cut ahead,
             Chuck.
          Steer right.
       That's it, Chuck.
        You're leading.
      Boy, what a leader!
        Lead on, Chuck!
      Chuck, you've taken
        the wrong turn!
          [screaming]
     Chuck, you blockhead.
   It's the end of the road!
       [all] We're stuck!
     We'll never get down!
    And we've lost the race!
          [screaming]
     Well, I'm the leader.
 I guess it's up to me to climb
   down and free this wheel.
         We're doomed!
    Help! Help! Help! Help!
         We're doomed!
         We're doomed!
             Help!
     [all] Charlie Brown is
       going to save us.
            [shouts]
    Save us, Charlie Brown!
          It's moving!
          It's moving!
    We're all going to die!
          Are we dead?
    Thanks to Charlie Brown.
         I'm not dead?
   Of course you're not dead.
No thanks to old Charlie Brown.
     All right, all right.
     Let's go to the river.
      I certainly hope so.
    I see open water ahead.
       We must be heading
         for the river.
              Ow!
       I think. I think.
       - [engine starts]
     - I got it! I got it!
           Let's go!
           Let's go!
           [laughing]
        [smug shouting]
          No! No! No!
           [shouting]
          [screaming]
           [shouting]
          [squealing]
       Are we OK, Chuck?
This water looks kind of rough.
      If you can't handle
     the leadership, Chuck,
           I'm here.
 [all] Lead us, Charlie Brown!
             Chuck,
 you've led us into a typhoon.
  Do something, Charlie Brown!
            Please!
   Lead, Charlie Brown, lead!
          [screaming]
          [screaming]
    Yeah, we're number one,
          you bullies!
          Boy, Chuck.
  You really know how to lead.
        You got us ahead
       of those bullies.
              Hey!
  Only Snoopy is ahead of us.
     Charge, Chuck. Charge!
            OK. OK.
   If you'll just calm down,
       I'll do something.
    If we're gonna catch up
           to Snoopy,
  we're gonna have to paddle.
      The boys will start
          first watch.
          The girls...
 Just one second, there, Chuck.
             Lucy,
  prepare the secret ballots.
      The question before
         the house is,
do we paddle the raft or do we float with the current?
      Now, wait a minute.
 You've all made me the leader.
I'm going to make the decisions.
     Men, take the paddles
          and paddle.
 You gals duck down to ease up
    on the wind resistance.
         Now, ready...
            Paddle!
        Paddle! Paddle!
        Paddle! Paddle!
    Paddle! Paddle! Paddle!
            Paddle!
            Paddle!
            Paddle!
    Chuck, you're doing it!
     I see the finish line!
    Chuck, you're leading us
          to victory!
There's no one in front, Chuck.
            Hooray!
            Hooray!
            Hooray!
            [splash]
  Hey, we've lost our leader.
      We've lost the crew.
         - Help! Help!
            - Help!
             Help!
       Help! Help! Help!
           [shouting]
          [screaming]
       We're number one!
       We're number one!
              Yay!
       This'll show 'em,
       once and for all.
Yeah! Time to give those creeps
         a real lesson.
      They shouldn't have
       tried to beat us.
     Nobody beats us ever.
They deserve whatever they get.
       We're number one!
       We're number one!
     We're number one! Yay!
     We're number one! Yay!
           [cheering]
   Oh, no! Turn around! Help!
           [cheering]
       Now what do we do?
          Don't worry.
   They'll never get through.
             - Hey!
          - [popping]
           Yay! Yay!
    The winner! The winner!
           [cheering]
          The winner!
          The winner!
      To the winner of our
    annual river raft race,
          this trophy.
    Congratulations, champ.
           [cheering]
  Well, kid. You guys put one
     over on us, all right.
 But just wait till next year.
           [snarling]
          [screeches]
      OK, move along, now.
    Everybody into the bus.
    Hey, this has been good
        for you, Chuck.
        You've developed
   real leadership qualities.
      Well, lots of things
      have happened to me,
 and I'm glad I did what I did.
 You know, I was never sure how
I would stand up under pressure
  and how I'd make decisions.
    I feel good about myself
 for the first time in my life.
  I think now that dumb things
  won't happen to me anymore.
I feel like I'm more in control.
              Hey!
      Don't forget... me!
            [sighs]
   Snoopy, the bus took off,
      And they forgot me.
    Can you give me a lift?

You can have it.

You're a good cook, Elliott.

Now, Elliott, we want the people of Passamaquoddy to like us.
- Don't we?
- [Gibberish]
I mean, you're kind of big, and we don't want to scare anyone.
- Do we?
- [Growling, Clicking Tongue]
So you better not show yourself, understand?
[Gasps, Sighs]
I know how ya feel, but you'll have to make yourself invisible.

Nope.

Look out, Elliott!
- Oops. Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.
- [All Laughing]
I'm sorry, real sorry.
I was telling my dragon not to bump his head on the sign.
All right, smarties.
Into your classroom.
March, march!
[Teacher]
March! March!
March! March!
How dare you?
I mean, how dare you lie and try to embarrass me in front of my students.
- I wasn't lying.
- Thaùs a lie on top of a lie.
Ugh! You're not one of my pupils.
What school are you playing hooky from?
- I-I don't go to school.
- Ah! I knew it.
Thaùs just what this town needs.
- [Elliott Giggling]
- [Teacher] Another ignoramus.
- No, Elliott.
- [Ripping]
[All Laughing]
You disgusting little street urchin!
You could be locked up for this.
Where's the sheriff?
Please. I didn't do anything.
Your skirt got caught on a nail.
Yes!
Your fingernail!
Gentlemen,
I propose to say...
Passamaquoddy's a beautiful community... where the sun always rises and the sun always sets.
- Thaùs very deep. Don't you think?
- Elliott!
Iùs a place of serenity and security, where the unexpected never happens.
- Ow!
- [Elliott Grumbles, Growls]
- Iùs okay, Elliott.
- [Astonished Mumbling]
It seems to say,
"Welcome!"
You-You absolute oaf.
You-You idiot!
- No, come, come.
- Look, it was that kid that pushed me.
He pulled off
Miss Taylor's petticoat.
- He walked through my cement with his big feet.
- He scared my horse, Victoria.
Leùs get out of here, Elliott.
- We-Well, where is this person?
- Th-There he goes!
- Well, detain him. Detain him.
- [Crowd Shouting]
[Chuckling]
- Elliott...
- Uh-oh.
- You spoiled everything.
- [Gibberish]
Darn you, Elliott.
I told you to behave.
[Sorrowful Gibberish]

Scallops.
And some oysters.
And...
Oh, hello there, little boy.
- Hi.
- [Sniffing]
- Hi.
- [Puzzled Gibberish]
- Hey! Hey, you look terrible.
- Whoopee!
Hey, your frienÔs... turned green.
- [Gibberish]
- If I didn't know any better,
I'd say he was a dragon.
- A drag-drag...
- [Growls]
Dragon!
- Elliott, didn't I tell you that...
- [Frantic Gibberish]
- [Loud Chattering]
- [Screaming, Indistinct]
[Gibberish]
Oh! Gentlemen...
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# A green and seething fire-breathing monster is in sight #
# With eyes of red a lion's head and wings as dark as night #
# Oh, he has a jaw of gleaming teeth
He's 50 feet in height #
# Iùs true, iùs true
Oh, what are we to do #
# Iùs true, iùs true
He'll break us all in two #
# Oh, he's comin' in
His great big fin is right against the door #
# So board up all the windows #
# And get down on the floor #
Has anybody seen my dad?
Nora, please, my child, come in.
- Get off that street.
- Whaùs the matter?
- Worst thing I ever saw in my life out on the street.
- What was it?
- I don't want to tell you for fear iùll scare you to death!
- Scare me.
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# His tail lashing, he'll be smashing every shop in town #
# With scaly feet he'll crack the street and tear the steeple down #
# Iùs not some loony dream
I heard a scream from Sheriff Brown #
# Iùs true, iùs true
Oh, what are we to do #
- # Iùs true, iùs true #
- # Old Lampie's in a stew #
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear there was a dragon #
# You're off your hinges
All those binges put you in a haze #
# You crazy fools
Iùs all your doggone fault he's in a daze #
# Let go of me, let go of me and mend your wicked ways #
- [Braying]
- Aah!
# What makes you think there ever was, there never was #
# There never, never, ever was a dragon, dragon, dragon #
# Dragon, dragon dragon, dragon, dragon #
# Dragon, dragon, dragon dragon, dragon, dragon #
[Screaming]
[Cheering]
# There never, never, never never, never, never, never #
# Never, never, never, never never, never, never, never #
# Never, never, never was a dragon #
[Grumbling,
Indistinct]
- Now, why don't you just calm down?
- I seen his face.
If you wanna call it a face.
It was this close to me.
Why don't you lie down, Dad? Come on.
You know what else?
It started to smile at me.
- Well, did you smile back?
- I didn't have time to smile.
I was too busy running.
And you know...
And you know what else?
There was this boy with it.
And he wasn't afraid.
- This boy...
- Lie down.

We're in a lot of trouble, and iùs all your fault.
[Sighing]
[Inhaling]
[Exhaling]
[Inhaling, Exhaling]
I don't wanna play.
You did everything wrong is Passamaquoddy.
Now everybody hates us.
I don't know whether you're good for me... or bad.
[Sniffles]
I'm sorry, Elliott.
I didn't really mean that.
Iùs just
I don't know what to do, and I'm scared.
[Sniffles]
[Groans]
Hello in there!
[Whispering]
Get back!
[Grumbling, Grunting]
Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just playing tic-tac-toe.
[Chuckling] Well, this isn't exactly the best place for tic-tac-toe.
The tide's coming in.
High water reaches this cave sometimes.
You better head for home.
You're not from
Passamaquoddy, are you?
Nope.
Just sort of... travelling.
Where are your parents?
Where are you staying?
- Whaùs your name?
- Pete.
I'm Nora, and I have to get back on watch, up in the lighthouse.
There's chowder on the stove, if you'd like some.
Wh-Whaùs the matter?
Iùs a hand, not a shark.
You can finish that chowder... if you'd like.
[Exhales, Sniffles]
Oh, I forgot something.
Be right back.
I forgive you, Elliott.
- [Giggles]
- [Sighs, Chuckles]
Stay here till I see what iùs like up in the lighthouse.
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
The Gogans own me,
I guess.
They said it was against the law for me to ever leave them.
Where did you get that bruise?
Mr Gogan. I was milking the cow, and I missed the bucket.
- Had he done that before?
- All the time.
The first time I ran away, the orphan home sent me back.
This time,
I'll just keep running.
Well, you'll be safe here.
Nora, no one's ever been this nice to me. I'll always remember it.
Pete, why don't you sleep here tonight?
We'll figure out what to do tomorrow.
Okay?
Wonderful.
I've got work to do. Come on.
Are you anybody's mother?
I'm not even anybody's wife.
But you're gonna get married now, aren't you?
[Scoffs] I'm already married to this lighthouse.
- Who's that?
- Paul.
- Is he part of your family?
- He almost was.
- How can someone almost be part of a family?
- We were going to be married.
How come you weren't?
Well, as far as we know, his ship was headed for a storm.
They were never heard from again.
That was a year ago.
He'll come back.
I tell myself the same thing every day, standing up there watching for ships on the horizon.
[Sighs] Time I should be thinking of other things, so they tell me.
I'll have to ask
Elliott about Paul.
He has a way of knowing things.
Who's Elliott?
- My dragon.
- Dragon?
[Gasps]
So you're the boy with the dragon.
- Yup.
- Where is he?
- Down in the cave.
- Thaùs interesting.
I've never known anyone with a dragon.
What does he look like?
Just a plain, ordinary dragon.
How plain?
How ordinary?
# He has the head of a camel #
# The neck of a crocodile #
It sounds rather strange.
# He's both a fish and a mammal #
# And I hope he'll never change #
# 'Cause iùs not easy to find someone who cares #
# Iùs not easy to find magic in pairs #
# I'm glad I found him
I love him #
# I won't let him get away #
# 'Cause iùs not easy #
# You say the head of a camel #
- # The neck of a crocodile #
- And the ears of a cow!
# Iùs clear that friends can be different #
# Yes, I understand you now #
[Together] # Iùs not easy to find someone who cares #
# Iùs not easy to find magic in pairs #
# Now that you have him
Hold him #
# Treasure him from day to day #
# Iùs so easy #
# Life is lollipops and raindrops #
# With the one you love #
# Someone you can always be with #
# Argue and agree with #
# Climb the highest tree with #
[Together]
# Iùs not easy #
# To share somebody's dream #
# It gets easy when you work as a team #
# You've got to tend it
Fan it #
# Thaùs what
I plan to do #
# Oh, I had one friend by my side #
# Now I have two #
# Him and you #
# Him and me #
[Together]
# And iùs so easy #
# [Humming]
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, son.
- Nice to see you again.
- Ah. Thank you.
Aah!
- Iùs you!
- Whaùs the matter?
Iùs you.
The boy with the dragon.
Yes, sir.
[Screaming]
Dad! Dad, what is it?
- The boy with the dragon.
- I know, I know. Now, just take it easy.
You saw it.
You saw it?
I didn't actually see it, but I know what it looks like.
- But wha...
- We'll talk about it later.
O-One thing I must know:
It isn't in the lighthouse, is it?
- No, Ellioùs down in the cave.
- Oh, Ellio...
Elliott? Lt... It even has a name.
There's nothing to get upset about.
You're right. Right, there's nothing to get upset about.
Nothing. No, why should I get upset?
I should be happy.
L... I should be happy! I'll go down to the saloon and I'll tell the boys.
I'll say, "Boys, here it is."
And then hear the apologies. [Laughs]
Ellioùll be happy to do it for you, sir.
Good boy. Good lad.
Just you and me and Elliott.
We'll go into the saloon.
Oh. Elliott...
He won't... won't start to scratch or... or fight, or set anything on fire, will he?
- Well, he's sort of...
- Sort of what?
- Unpredictable.
- Now, don't do anything with Elliott.
Wh-Why don't you leave him where he is?
- Iùs too dangerous to take him into town.
- Iùs dangerous.
Now, I don't want either one of you to say a word about Elliott...
- to anyone, do you understand,
- No. No. Yes!
Until we've talked this over.
Now, leùs all have breakfast. The lamp has to be polished, the lens cleaned, and I want to take Pete to buy new clothes.
Yes, well, clean Elliott and eat the lamp.
I mean, we'll... clea-clean the lamp.
[Muttering] Elliott!
The name's Elliott. Did you hear that?
Doc Terminus is comin'!
Are they still after us?
We lost 'em.
Good.
- Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy!
- What?
Pass-a-ma-quoddy ahead, ahoy!
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
All hands on deck!
Here comes the Doc!
[Dog Barking]
- [Screams] Slow down!
- My fence!
Wet! Wet!
Iùs still wet!
[Screaming]
Throw out the anchor!
Since we all concur, gentlemen,
I suggest that we adjourn.
[Screams]
[Townspeople Screaming]
When did I start losing control of my town?
[Both Screaming]
- You dummy!
- You told me to drop the anchor.
I dropped the anchor.
[Groaning]
- Watch Bones.
- Get him off of me! Get him off!
I think they remember us.
Uh-oh. I think
I remember them.
- Just act normal.
- I am acting normal. I'm ready to run.
Quick, whaùs the name of this town again?
Passamaquoddy.
- "Quassama" what?
- Passamaquoddy!
Got it. How wonderful to see your smiling faces again.
All of you.
I-I've never known such warmth, such welcome, such loving hospitality.
Get out, ya quack!
And don't bring those phoney remedies here again.
Go on back where you belong: Jail.
- [Booing]
- Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I sense enthusiasm,
I sense loving response, and thaùs why I feel that this is my home... away from home.

Oh, Doctor! Oh, Doctor!

Someone in need.
A human being crying out to another great human being, for a service only I can provide.
Madam, Dr Terminus is here to cure you.

Pete, if you bring up the oil can, we'll be ready for the night.
Sure. Before that, I'd like to show Elliott my new suit.
No! No, no.
You can't bring Elliott up here.
Government regulation 302 states that... no dragons shall be allowed... on the premises of the United States' lighthouses.
Now, go on down and get the oil so I can mark it up in the log that you did that.
Okay. Nora, first can
I bring Paul's picture down to Elliott?
Then he can start looking for Paul.
All right.
[Door Opens,
Closes]
- Thanks, Dad.
- For what?
- For making believe about the dragon and going along with it.
- Making...
It means a lot to Pete.
Sort of a family he made up.
I'm not making believe.
I actually saw it.
And I haven't been the same since!
Go to the cave; you'd see it too, and your eyes would...
- [Popping] pop right out!
- [Scoffs]
I was there.
I saw nothing!
Dad, be realistic.
Oh, you wanna be realistic.
Leùs talk about how realistic you are.
Here you are, waiting for someone to come back that just ain't gonna come back, Nora.
And if waitin' for over a year hasn't told ya nothin', then you're not the one to talk about being realistic, are you?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
I'm going down to the hardware store.

Hi, Elliott!
How do you like my new suit?
Wow!
[Panting]
[Gibberish]
And new shoes too.
Look at the way they shine!
[Laughing]
Nora's so nice to me,
I want us to do something for her.
I want you to concentrate on finding Paul for Nora.
This is what he looks like.
[Gibberish]
Remember his face.
Try real hard.
Hmm.
[Gibberish]
Better go now.
- [Kissing]
- Aww.
- See ya tomorrow.
- [Whistling]
[Giggling]
Twelve times a day till iùs empty, then come back.
One dollar, please.
Thank you.
I'm getting tired.
Sick and tired... of having to explain why we have a sail instead of horses.
Would you rather tell them how I gave the horses away in Matawanakey... to settle a malpractice suit, hmm?
- No.
- Well, don't worry.
When we leave here, we'll have horses again and plenty more.
- More what?
- More everything.
- Whoo!
- More anything! I don't know.
Do you mind if I sound optimistic?
This is the worst town on our route.
I hate Pass... Pass...
- Pastafazooli, or whatever the name is.
- Quoddy.
Yeah! I don't wanna cure anybody here.
- They all deserve to have whatever they have.
- I'll drink to that.
I've had nothing, nothing but bad luck in this burg.
Hey! Ooh...
- I'm sorry, Doc.
- You see what I mean, hmm?
Doc, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, Hoagy.
- I di... Can I buy everybody a round?
- Yeah.
Huh? Well... Hey, 'cause,
Doc, I gotta talk to you. Okay?
- Sit down.
- May I? Thank you.
Hey, you're a ma...
You're a man of science, ain't you?
A man of science, yes.
Yes, I am.
With degrees from the Royal Medical College, London.
- Huh?
- The Gleinen Einen Peitzen in Vienna.
- Oh!
- And the Moulin Rouge in Paris.
Why do you think they call me Doc?
Because they sail their boats into me, hmm?
Eh?
[Chuckling]
Oh. You know anything about dragons?
Of course I do. I see them in all the big cities going down the streets, with that funny little walk, wearing bright colours, fluttering around...
No, no, no. I'm talkin' about a real dragon.
Real dragon. With fire... fire coming out of his mouth.
And he's got real wings.
Uh, you need a veterinarian. Hmm?
- Why do you ask?
- I saw one.
Is it sitting at the next table?
Hmm? [Chuckling]
I tell ya, I saw a real dragon yesterday afternoon.
He's owned... owned by a young boy... by the name of Pete.
You are trying to tell me that there is a dragon here...
- In Passamacracka? Yeah.
- "Quoddy."
- Yes.
- I told you this was a rotten town.
Well, in my educated opinion, sir,
- I think you've been up in your lighthouse too long.
- Huh?
Wait. Wait, listen. What if what
I just told you was true?
In my scientific opinion, the existence of a dragon... would have an impact of gigantic proportions.
Mythology and legend would become history and science.
- One could really make a quick buck with it.
- Well, I can prove it.
I can prove it!
H-His name is Elliott.
[Stammering] H-He's downstairs.
You could go and see him right now.
Unfortunately,
I cannot make it right now.
I have an appointment with a young lady who's interested in a nursing career.
- Oh. Oh.
- I wanna see it.
- You wanna see it?
Well, see it you shall!
- Okay.
But first...
First, leùs have a quick one... because of the rocks we have to climb.
And the dragon...
The dragon is scary.
Okay, we'll have one for the rocks.
And one for the scary.
- Quoddy.
- Hmm?
Shh!
Nora. Shh!
We don't...
We don't...
- We don't want Nora to hear us.
- Shh.
- Huh?
- Shh.
- We don't want Nora to hear us.
- Shh.
I tell you that he's in there.
[Deep Sighing]
[Lips Smacking]
- Are you convinced?
- Absolutely.
- Well, leùs get outta here.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a mi...
I-I want to pet him.
Huh? You wa...
You want to pet him?
Are you crazy?
I know you ain't drunk.
No matter what you see in here, don't get scared.
[Footsteps]
Hey, I might as well tell you straight off, you're gonna see a hideous monster.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
And iùs big.
Fifty feet of terror!
Claws! Claws so sharp they could tear a man to shreds.
- [Gulps]
- Eyes, evil eyes... that can see right through ya.
And a tail thaùs so big and powerful, it could destroy the hull of a frigate!
It can wipe out an entire crew... with one swish of his tail.
Face... Face so terrible, it could turn a man to stone, a hero into a coward.
A flame so hot, it could roast a turkey!
And a mouth so terrible, it could devour a man and...
[Spits] spit him 20 leagues.
Stay close.
[Sputtering]
Iùs g-g-g-got m-me.
[Screams]
[Stammering]
Look at it!
[Screams]
[Both Screaming]
[Shuddering]
Them eyes are lookin' right through us.
Look, don't ever let a dragon know you're... you're afraid of him.
- [Whimpering]
- [Mumbling]
Stop-Stop shaking, and-and smile.
Can't stop shaking, and I am smiling.
[Stammering]
Hello. Hello. Hello, Elliott.
[Gibberish]
Aah! Hey, see how smart he is?
- [Whimpering]
- He said hello to me.
Yeah! He likes me!
- Y-You do somethin' so he'll like you.
- L-Like me?
Yeah. Do somethin' to make him like you.
- Huh?
- You think?
Elliott, would you... would you like a little b-belt, huh?

Is it... Is it two parts fish oil and three parts seawater... and six parts potato squeezings, or is it only two parts seawater, hmm?
Ten parts seawater, hmm? That much.
[Chuckles] No wonder they love it.
S-s-s-s-s-s...
- Saw it.
- Saw what?
El-El-El...
Dra-Dra-Dra...
What is an "el-el-el dra-dra-dra," hmm?
Dr-Dr-Dragon.
[Panting]
I-I saw the dragon.
L-Lampie wasn't lying.
Iùs real. It belched flame at me.
Belched?
You saw a belching dragon?
You sure you weren't belching yourself in front of the mirror?
N-Never saw anything so horrible in my life.
Th-Thought
I was a goner.
There was no need for him to do that.
I only offered him a sociable drink.
Hoagy, I can't stand you when you're drunk.
Doc, look at me.
I'm not drunk.
What I saw tonight sobered me in a second.
I swear... I swear to you, there's a big, horrible dragon... up in that cave, I swear.
I just realized,
I can't stand you when you're sober!
Now, get out of here. Get yourself a good, stiff drink. Out!
I swear.
A vicious dragon.
Out!
Dragon.
# [Humming]
Nine and nine are eighteen.
Really?
Nine times nine are eighty-one.
Amazing!
Two thousand pounds make a ton.
Wow!
That sign says "Passamaquoddy."
- You still have to go to school.
- Do I have to like it?
Like it or hate it, you have to go.
Do you wanna be stupid when you grow up, like the Gogans?
Okay, I like it.
I like it.
- Isn't that the boy with the dragon?
- I think so. Leùs go see.
Come on.
- Are you the boy with the dragon?
- Yep.
- Is it a he or a she?
- You don't name girls Elliott.
- Where is he?
- Following me.
- Elliott the dragon is walking right there.
- I can't seem to make out his colour.
- Mostly green.
- He's not too big, is he?
- Regular dragon size.
- Wow!
- Pete? School.
- Gee!
I ain't got hardly nothin' to sell.
So? I pulled my nets in, and there weren't a fish in 'em.
I just docked. There ain't nothin' out in that ocean but water.
Iùs real strange,
I'm tellin' ya.
Iùs like every fish sorta disappeared.
Just suddenly up and disappeared.
There's the cause of it.
That kid Pete.
From the day he come to town, the fishing turned sour.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Iùs that crazy dragon talk of his.
That kiÔs been nothin' but bad luck wherever he goes.
You're a bunch of superstitious ding-dongs.
You know that fishing grounds shift from time to time.
Ellioùll make the fish come back.
There he goes, talkin' dragons again.
Hey, kid! There ain't no room in this town for a dragon, and there ain't no room in this town for jinxes like you, neither!
Well, if there's enough room for a chowderhead like you, then there's more than enough room for a dragon.

You're late. You're late.
Late. Late. Late.
Late.
Why is everybody late?
We were playing with
Nora, Pete and his dragon.
- His wagon?
- No, dragon!
Dragon, wagon. Thaùs no excuse for being late. Get inside.
Good morning, Miss Taylor.
Good morning. Thank you for making my students late... and for disrupting the entire schedule.
- You have a new student.
- I have?
This is Pete.
Oh, him.
If he's a transfer,
I'll have to have his records.
Unfortunately, his old school burned down and his records were destroyed.
- Pete, give her nine times nine.
- Eighty-one.
Then I'll have to have his birth certificate.
Tragically, the flames from the school house... set fire to the city hall, and his certificate went up with it.
- Pete, give her a ton.
- Two thousand pounds.
Do you want him to spell
Passamaquoddy?
No, no, no. This is irregular, irregular, irregular.
But he needs an education, education, education.
Surely you can't disagree with that.
I would if I could, but I can't.
[Bell Ringing]
Why is the bell ringing?
There's no one out there.
I'll stop it.
- Elliott, stop it!
- [Elliott Chattering]
The bell isn't supposed to ring till recess!
- Stop that!
- I'm not doing it.
Liar. Liar, liar.
Iùs the knuckle cracker for you.
Three for lying and three... for whom the bell tolls. Come.
Put your hands out.
Palms down, knuckles up.
One. Two.
- Three! Four!
- It doesn't hurt much, Elliott.
- Whom are you talking to? Five, six!
- Elliott!
- Whom?
- My dragon.
- [Laughing]
- Your dragon, wagon.
Nothing but a network of lies!
Three more for your imagination!
Seven! Eight!
And a great big nine!
Go stand in the corner.

Jehoshaphat! Would you look at that!
- Why do I hear a bell ringing?
- School must be out.
Iùs too early, stupid.
See, I told you.
School is out.
- Wait! Whaùs happening?
- Pete's dragon wrecked the school!
I told you.
I told you!
[Man]
Whaùs happened over there? Something crashed right through the school.
Look at it, I'm telling you.
Iùs a big hole in the side of the wall.
And a dragon came in through one wall... and went out the other wall.
Now do you believe me?
[Chuckling]
- You think this kid Pete would sell it?
- Money talks.
First there's a dragon.
Now he tells me money talks.
Will miracles never cease?

Good morning, Miss Nora.
So, this is where you live, eh?
At last we've seen the light.
[Chuckling]
I tell you, you've got to have a sense of humour these days.
- And you must be Pete.
- Yes, sir!
I'm Dr Terminus, and this is Hoagy, who's doing his internship with me.
I heard about the incident at school yesterday.
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- I realize you must be disturbed about it, and, uh, up to here in dragons.
You know, Pete, I have always loved dragons.
They're such wonderful creatures.
When they're not busy destroying things, of course.
I've had a dream since
I was your age that one day...
I would have my very own dragon.
I would consider my life to be fulfilled... and would be most grateful if you would sell me your dragon.
You wanna buy Elliott?
Sight unseen. As is.
We'll give him a good home. Bless him.
I couldn't sell him.
Sure you could! Thaùs what life is all about: Buying and selling.
- I'll give ya three dollars.
- [Whispering] Offer him four!
I'll offer him five.
Iùll make his head swim.
Five... dollars.
I can't sell him.
I don't own him.
- Well, what did ya do, rent him?
- Well, who owns him?
Well, nobody, I guess.
He just came to me.
He only goes to those who need him.
I need him.
Listen, Doc, I don't know what you're up to, but you better forget about this.
- He's not for sale.
- Nora, go paint your lighthouse.
Pete, my boy, you're conversant with Elliott.
Now, talk to him.
Tell him how much I need him.
Deliver Elliott to me and the fiver is yours, plus a bottle of my medicine thaùs guaranteed to bring on puberty two years ahead of time, and thaùs better than a dragon, hmm?
[Chuckling]
- Doc, maybe you should talk to Elliott yourself.
- Mm-hmm.
Wh-Where is he?
Does he speak English?
Down the beach.
- Where?
- Right there, by the water.
- Right. I still don't see...
- Thaùs because he's invisible today.
[Laughing]
They know they're sitting on a gold mine.
Well, they've had their chance to make a few dollars.
That dragon doesn't belong to anybody.
He's fair game, and he's gonna be ours!
# We'll bind him up, grind him up
Lock him up, chop him up #
# Can't you hear that jingle-jangle sound #
- # Oh yeah #
- [Cackling]
# Iùs money, money, money by the pound #
- [Horn Blowing]
- Ahh!
[Laughing]
Uh! Ah-ah-ah!
[Laughing]
Fog! Fog!
- Where's the fog?
- There's not much fog.
We were just using the horn to chase off a few buzzards.
Few buzzards. Nora, how many times must l...
Oh, started already, huh?
Look, if you're gonna whitewash, son, let your brush go up and down, up... thaùs a boy... and down.
- Up and down. Up and down.
- Thaùs right.
- [Chuckling]
- This is fun.
If iùs so much fun, I'm gonna leave it to you and Nora to finish up... while I go in and take a nice little nap.
This is the best time
I've ever had in my whole life.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Tell him, Nora.
Pete, Lampie and I have talked it over.
- We feel the time has come for you to stop running.
- Yes, iùs true.
If iùs all right with you, we'd like you to live here with us.
Oh, Nora, Lampie, do you mean this could be my real home?
- It certainly does.
- And Elliott too?
- Well, l...
- Sure, and Elliott too.
But Elliott has to live in the cave.
All right, he will.
- Oh.
- [Lampie Chuckling]
No, no, no!
Not on me! Not on me!
On the side of the building, please, huh?
- Now up... Up and down.
- And down. Up and down.
You know what?

Whoa, boy. Say, have you seen anything of a mean, fresh kid...
'bout yea big?
Answers to the name of Pete.
Half of the kids in this town answer to the name of Pete.
Other half don't answer.
- Let me break his bones, Pa!
- Just a minute!
This particular Pete, he's always talkin'... to his big, hokey-pokey, uh, whatchamacallit, uh...
- Dragon.
- Dragon?
Merle, this here's the place.
Come on, Willie.
It would be unethical of me to leave my patient at a time like this.
Iùs important.
About the dragon.
Put your foot on there.
Now, don't move, stay tense, or that weight will fall, that clamp will break your jaw, tear your gums apart and go through your cheek.
- Tense. Tense!
- [Whimpering]
[Whimpering]
See that wagonload of worms? They're lookin' for the kid and the dragon.
I knew there'd be competition.
Come on.
[Lampie]
Careful as you bring 'em aside.
I got one!
I got one!
Ugh! Iùs ugly!
Well! If it ain't our own little Petey!
- [Cackling]
- The Gogans!
Well, you look so nice and clean, and those new clothes.
I guess all those good manners
I taught you done paid off.
Who's that pretty lady you're with, little Pete?
- Yeah. Introduce us.
- Yeah. Introduce us.
I'm Nora, and Pete is staying with me.
Why, boys, I believe she's tryin' to break up our happy little family.
Elliott went to look for Paul.
I wish he were here.
Don't worry. They won't get you.
Come on, Dad.
I guess we're gonna take him back now, miss, to his own home, sweet home.
- Come on, Pete.
- You won't be taking him anywhere!
Okay, lady. We're gonna take him whether you like it or not.
- Right, boys?
- Right, Pa.
Willie, you grab onto Pete, while I hold onto her.
You grab Pete.
I wanna hold her.
- I wanna hold her!
- Well, I'm gonna hold her!
[Squabbling]
All right!
I'll settle this.
You two grab the brat.
I'll hold her.
Lf'n you think you're gonna hold her like my boys wanna hold her, you're gonna be holdin' your head, ya understand?
Lady, that boy is ours!
# We got a bill of sale right here #
# That says he belongs to us #
# We bought him fair and square last year #
# And we own the little cuss #
# Look here
Read the writin' #
# That gives us a legal claim #
[Gogans] # Oh, we got a bill of sale right here #
# With dear little Petey's name #
I don't believe it.
# We got a bill of sale in hand
And lady, if you don't budge #
# We'll pick you up right where you stand and bring you before the judge #
No, sir.

[Sighing]
Iùs downright dangerous, getting all wet like this.
We done had our bath in May!
Ahh-ahh-ahh...
- [Sneezing]
- [Men] Bless you, Ma.
- [Coughing]
- Excuse me, folks.
I witnessed what happened today, and I'm completely sympathetic with you.
- Whaùs sympathetic mean?
- I'm Doc Terminus. Like to talk to you.
Oh, Doc, I got this here "poomonia."
- Sit down.
- Ahh-ahh-ahh...
[Sneezing]
- Bless you, Ma.
- Bless you, Ma.
[Groaning, Panting]
I got this terrible ache in my back!
Good. Whaùs rightfully yours is rightfully yours.
Now, you want Pete, right?
- Right!
- Right!
- Right!
I want... the dragon.
- The dragon?
- The dragon?
- [Laughing]
W-W-Wait a minute.
Now I got a stitch in my side.
You really want the dragon?
Very much. Mm-hmm.
Well, then, what are you willing to give for it?
The help you need getting Pete.
I'll need the same kind of help getting the dragon.
[Cackling]
[Laughing]
N-Now I think the pain's in my head!
- Have we got a deal?
- Sure.
We scratch your back, you scratch ours.
The boathouse, sunset, hmm?
Uh, Doc.
What you gonna do with a dragon?
Oh, maybe put him on a ranch, breed him. Hmm?
Big stud fees.
Ahoy. Ahoy. Here.
How would you like to make the fishing good again?
- How do we do that?
- Catch that dragon!
Set a trap for him, throw a net over him, drag him away.
Goodbye, Elliott.
Hello, fish. Hmm?
Sunset, the boathouse.
Spread the word, hmm?
[Fishermen Murmuring
In Agreement]
Get back!
Get back!
Dr Terminus! Here's that there harpoon you wanted!
Good! Put it right over there!
[Ma]
Now you just remember our bargain!
Okay, I want separate trip lines on the primary tarp, the secondary net and on the tertiary.
- T-Tertiary?
- Whaùs that?
Dragon medicine.
[Cackling]
- Okay, fix it.
- We've done it!
Don't signal till you're re...
- [Men Shouting]
- Get this net up off of me!
Will you get this... Will you get this net up! Up! Up!
Now, I've gotta go and get that kid.
You rehearse this and make it run like clockwork or else.
Elliott!
Oh, Elliott, you were terrific the way you saved us from the Gogans.
- [Laughing]
- What?
[Gibberish]
Do you mean it?
[Clicking Tongue]
Wow! Thaùs great.
You're the most wonderful dragon in the whole world.
[Soft Growling,
Clicking Tongue]
Wait till I tell Nora!
# [Humming]
Nora! Nora! Good news!
Elliott found Paul, and he's on his way home!
- Pete...
- I wouldn't say anything like that if I were you.
But iùs true.
Elliott said.
Please.
There's been enough talk about Paul, and Elliott too.
[Sighing]
Both of us have to be... realistic.
Paul's ship went down.
He's not coming back.
And I have to adjust my life to it.
You have to make a big adjustment too.
You have us now.
You don't have to make believe your only friend is a dragon.
But I'm not making believe.
Thaùs what I mean by "realistic."
There are no dragons.
Except for Elliott.
He's real.
Lampie, you've seen him, haven't you?
Well, l...
I thought I saw him.
Wait till Paul gets here. Then you'll know how realistic Elliott is.
Okay.
Until that time, leùs try not to talk about it.
How about filling the reserve oil can?
Sure.
Well, at least one of us is entitled to have illusions.
[Thunderclap]
[Wind Howling]
Pete! Pete, iùs Elliott!
- Whaùs the matter?
- Ellioùs in Passapaka... Pakadaka...
He's in town, and he's tearing the place apart.
- You've gotta do something.
- Oh, no!
[Laughing]
We should be in the channel.
We shoulÔve made
Passamaquoddy Light by now.
There it is!
Iùs my home port.
I didn't think I'd ever see it again.
- Iùs a welcome sight.
- Looks great to me.
I know the light keepers personally.
- He's in there! Come on!
- Elliott! Elliott!
Did I say the primary was really the tertiary?
[Men Shouting]
Never!
- Where's Elliott?
- Nowhere!
Your hokey-pokey dragon's out helping Santa Claus pull his sled!
- Boys!
- Let me go!
Now you're never gonna get away again!
We're gonna put chains on you when you're workin'!
- And when you're not workin'.
- And when you're sleepin'!
Okay, okay. Tear him to pieces in your own time.
Right now he is the bait for the trap.
Take him in there where that thing can see him when he comes through the door.
He'll head straight for Pete.
We spring the trap.
After the tertiary net drops on him,
I'll give you the signal, and you fire the harpoon right into the middle.
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Got it?
Got it!
But what I don't got is, h-h-how you gonna get that monster, that hideous beast, that nightmare sent by the devil, to come here?
Easy. We get someone he knows to bring him here.
Well, who'd be crazy enough to do that?
No! No!
He knows you.
He trusts you.
He scares me!
He hates me!
Hoagy.
We are all on this earth for a purpose, and the time for your purpose is now.
I know that inside this pale, frail, pathetic shell of a man... there is a Vesuvius ready to erupt.
Now, I've known you, man and beast, since, since you were nothing.
But now, Hoagy, now, you're still nothing, but you could be something!
You can be a somebody.
A legend, Hoagy. A legend in your own lifetime, not a joke!
The momenùs here, Hoagy.
Grab it. Grab it!
Today the jester.
Tomorrow the king!
- No!
- Get out!
[Whimpering]
[Elliott Snoring]
E-Elliott.
C-Can you come out here for a second? Please?
[Snoring]
[Gasping]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
Wake up.
W-W-Wake up!
[Snarling]
D-D-Don't get n-n-nervous!
I'm a friend.
[Groaning, Snorting]
Don't roast me!
[Snarling]
Boo!
- Ahh!
- [Laughing]
H-Hon... Honest.
L-l-I-I-I got a m-mess... m-m-m-message about P-P-Pete!
- T-The G-G-Gogans...
- [Snarling]
Got P-P-P-Pete!
- [Bellowing]
- Ahh!
[Snarling, Roaring]
Aaah!
Follow me!
[Thunderclap]
Captain, the lighùs gone!
There's a reef between us and the channel.
Dad, I can't find Pete.
- Can you get it lit?
- I have to put in a dry wick.
Battle stations!
[Hoagy] I told you!
I told you, Elliott! There he is!
Look out, Elliott!
Iùs a trap!
Aaah! Get him!
He's right here!
Drop everything!
Drop everything!
[Men Shouting]
[Elliott Bellowing]
Elliott, over here!
[Hoagy] Get me out of here!
Elliott, don't step on me!
- Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
- Iùs beginnin' to look like a...
- Dragon!
- Don't say that!
I've got it!
We've done it! Out!
We've got it!
We've got it!
- Hoagy!
- [Elliott Growling]
Please!
Please, let me out!
- Doc, please!
- Get out of there! Get out of there!
- Doc, get me out!
Get me out! Get me out!
- Okay. Okay!
[Growling]
- [Growling]
- [Men Shouting]
- Help! Over here!
- Don't say that!
Tie him down!
Help, Elliott, help!
Man this harpoon. Take this.
[Chuckling]
Light the fuse.
No, no!
Don't shoot Elliott!
[Ma Screaming,
Shouting]
[Pa]
Get him back! Get him back!
The other.
- [Pa] Pick him up!
- [Ma] Take him outside!
[Hoagy]
Get out of the way!
- [Whimpering]
- [Screaming]
He's going!
Let me get a bead on him!
- Elliott, save me!
- [Ma] Don't let him get away again!
Get him outta here!
- Hands...
- Elliott, don't let 'em take me!
[Growling]
[Roaring]
[Stammering]
Wait! Wait!
[Ma Shouting]
- [Muttering]
- [Gogans Whimpering]
Huh? Pete!
- Thanks, Elliott.
- [Muttering]
You just listen to me!
That there boy belongs to me!
I paid fifty dollars for him, plus legals, and I got a bill of sale right here to prove it.
[Snarling]
- Boo.
- [Screaming]
[Ma] Merle, help! Get me out of here!
Don't just stand there!
Come on! Get me outta here!
Get me out of here!
[Ma]
You clucks!
[Elliott Laughing]
- [Grunting, Groaning]
- [Ma] Let him keep the brat!
[Roaring]
[Ma]
Come on! Get in the wagon!
[Shouting]
[Ma]
Wait! Wait for us!
[Elliott Howling]
Daaah-ah-ah!
Aaah-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[Screaming]
Aaah! Doh!
Hoagy, get me down!
We've gotta do something!
That dragon's gonna get away!
[Snarling]
[Whimpering]
Where is he? Where is he?
Elliott! Wait!
Wait, Elliott!
I wanna make a deal with ya.
To buy up all your used and spare parts, you know, like a hangnail, or if you shed your skin, or if your hair falls out,
I'll pay you top dollar!
Whaùs the matter with you?
Don't you have any business sense?
- Don't shout!
- Elliott! Elliott!
[Screaming]
He's gonna eat us up!
[Growling]
Oh!
[Whimpering]
[Wagon Crashing]
...in the street.
Quite a storm here.
Wait a minute.
Watch those stairs.
- [Gasping]
- [Electricity Crackling]
Oh, look!
Th-Th-There really is a dragon!
Yes, and he saved us!
- Dragon!
- A dragon! A real dragon!
- Attaboy, Elliott.
- [Muttering]
[Clicking Tongue]
That ship's headed for the reef!
Go down and sound the foghorn!
[Foghorn Blowing]
Elliott, quick! Quick!
[Foghorn Blowing]
[Ship Creaking]
Nora, let me have the light so I can see what I'm doing.
[Foghorn Blowing]
Come on, Elliott.
You can do it.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- I got it!
Come on, Elliott.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- Come on, Elliott!
[Panting]
[Pete]
Hurry!
Whaùs the matter?
Everything is wet in here, thaùs whaùs the matter!
- Don't worry, Lampie. Elliott came.
- Elliott?
Thaùs all I need is a dragon in here. Ah!
Get him outta here!
[Muttering]
Start your burner, Elliott.
Light the wick.
[Gibberish]
- [Clicking Tongue]
- All right, Elliott. Go ahead. Light it.
[Pete]
Now, Elliott! Now!
All right.
Where's the fire?
- [Groaning]
- Whaùs the matter?
[Gibberish, Sputtering]
- He's all squished up in the stairs.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- [Elliott Blowing]
- El-Elliott?
- [Gibberish]
He's real.
He's really real.
[Muttering,
Clicking Tongue]
- Of course he is.
He's gonna light the wick.
- Can he do it?
Can he? He can throw a flame clear across to Bar Harbor... if he can get his own burner goin'!
[Gasping]
- Come on, Elliott!
- [Whining]
- Go on!
Come on, Elliott!
Come on!
[Lampie]
Blow, Elliott!
[Drawing A Deep Breath]
- Wow! [Panting]
- [Pete] Elliott, you did it!
[Gibberish,
Clicking Tongue]
Look there!
That means the harbor is dead ahead, Captain!
Hard right rudder!
Elliott, I could give you a great big kiss.
[Shuddering]

[Elliott Muttering]
- What happened?
- We sank in a storm off Cape Patters.
I was the only survivor.
When I woke up in the hospital,
I'd lost my memory.
Then the other day, a strange thing happened.
My bed suddenly tipped over.
I don't know how, but I bumped my head and everything came back to me.
- Iùs a miracle!
- [Chattering]
Iùs Elliott.
Gather around, everyone. I'm going to have a few appropriate words to say.
Gather around. Come on.
Closer, closer.
There you are, yes.
Iùs nice to see you.
Ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pete, I want you to thank
Elliott the dragon... for the council here and all the townspeople.
- You do that?
- Well, he's right here.
He'd appreciate it if you'd thank him yourself.
- [Laughter]
- You mean I can talk right to him, huh?
Go right to the main source.
That was my campaign...
- No, he's over here.
- Oh! Oh, over that side.
So, uh, on behalf of...
[Laughter]
[Muttering]
Thank you.

Hi!
Oh, Elliott, you're the greatest.
You've made everybody happy, especially me.
I'm very proud of you.
[Muttering]
We've got a real family now and a place to live.
[Clearing Throat]
[Gibberish]
You've gotta go?
When will you be back?
[Gulping, Muttering,
Sniffling]
You... You won't be back?
[Muttering]
But why?
Did I do something wrong?
[Muttering]
[Snarling]
There's another kid in trouble?
[Muttering,

[Soft Roar]
Well, if anyone can get him out of it, you can.
- Ohh...
- [Giggling]
[Muttering]
I won't see you again, will I?
Ever.
[Sniffling, Whimpering]
[Sniffling]
What are you sniffing for?
[Gasping, Sneezing]
[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
Now, remember, don't scare people.
[Gibberish]
Goodbye, Elliott.
Goodbye.
[Gibberish]
- It is a dragon!
- [Pete, Lampie, Nora] Iùs Elliott!
[Pete] And remember, you're supposed to be invisible!
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
Many ages ago, when this ancient planet was not quite so ancient...
...long before man recorded his history...
...there was the time of Middle Earth when man shared his days...
...with elves, dwarves, wizards, goblins, dragons and hobbits.
In the lands of Middle Earth, in an area known as the Shire...
...there was a village named Hobbiton.
There, in a hole in the ground, lived a hobbit.
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole...
...nor a dry, bare, sandy hole.
It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort.
Bilbo Baggins?
- I'm looking to hire a burglar.
- Burglar?
You've come to the wrong place.
You mean you do not wish to share a grand adventure?
Dear me, no.
We hobbits are plain, quiet folk.
Adventures make one late for dinner.
Enough! I am Gandalf.
And Gandalf means me!
- Gandalf? Not the wandering wizard?
- The same!
Listen.
Thorin and company, at your service.
Dwalin, Balin...
...lKili, Fili...
...Dori, Nori and Ori.
Oin, sir. And Gloin, sir.
Call him Bifur. And him Bofur.
And Bombur at your service.
We are all at your service.
What do these dwarves want in Hobbiton?
They have come for tea, and for supper...
...and for you, Burglar Baggins!
- There's a magic in that music.
- And it moves through me.
- You feel the love of beautiful things.
- To go and see the great mountains...
...and hear the pine trees and waterfalls.
To wear a sword instead of a walking stick.
Just once.
Gandalf, dwarves, and Burglar Baggins...
What is this "burglar" business?
If you prefer, you can say
"expert treasure hunter."
Well, yes, I do prefer that.
We are met tonight in the house of our friend...
...this most excellent hobbit.
May the hair on his toes never fall out.
Hear, hear!
We shall soon start on our long journey.
Our object is, I take it, well-known to us?
All of us?
It is not well-known to me.
Really? Then we must inform our burglar.
We seek a treasure...
...that which is rightfully ours.
Far off in the East...
...beyond the Misty Mountains and the dark Forest of Mirkwood...
...there you will find
Lonely Mountain.
Long ago, this was the home of my people...
...and was ruled by my grandfather:
King Under the Mountain.
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep
Where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells
Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold where no man delves
There lay they long
And many a song
Was sung unheard by man or elves
For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought
And light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword
On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars
On crowns they hung
The dragon fire
In twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun
Undoubtedly, all this wealth was what brought the dragon.
The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red
It flaming spread
The trees like torches
Blazed with light
And below us, in the valley, lay Dale...
...a town of mortal men.
The bells were ringing in the Dale
The men looked up with faces pale
The dragon's ire
More fierce than fire
Laid low their towers
And houses frail
The mountain smoked beneath the moon
The dwarves they heard
The tramp of doom
They fled their hall
To dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon
Curses to the dragon!
Curses to Smaug!
He killed our men and stole our gold!
Curses to the dragon Smaug!
Is this the adventure you've planned for me?
To help you recapture the gold?
None other.
There are 13 of you. Very unlucky.
Mr. Baggins will make it 14.
A splendid lucky number you've found for us.
No arguments.
Let us have the contract.
"To Burglar Baggins:
Terms for your professional services.
One fourteenth of total profits.
Traveling expenses guaranteed.
Funeral expenses, if necessary.
Sincerely, Thorin and Company."
- "Funeral expenses"?
- Do you find the terms acceptable?
- Of course he does!
- But, but, but l...
And so tomorrow begins your greatest adventure.
No hat, no stick, no pipe.
Not even a pocket handkerchief.
How can one survive?
- How did Gandalf get ahead of us?
- He comes and goes at will.
He is a wizard, you know.
Oh, bother burgling and everything to do with it.
Always remember, Bilbo, when your heart wants lifting...
...think of pleasant things.
Eggs and bacon. A good, full pipe.
My garden at twilight. Cakes...
We'll camp here. Perhaps we can find a dry patch to sleep on.
Our lookout has spied something.
Look. Trolls!
Miserable, no-good, robbing trolls!
Where the deuce is Gandalf?
Left us again. Just when a wizard would have been most useful.
No matter. We have an expert burglar with us.
- What have trolls to do with burgling?
- We could use some of their meat.
- Oh, I say!
- Burglar, do your burgling!
Blast! Nothing but mutton to eat!
How I long...
...for a bit of man-flesh!
Bacon and eggs. My fireplace.
Hot chestnuts.
- What the blazes?!
- Help! Let me down! Stop that!
What have we got here?
Let's cook him and find out!
He wouldn't make a mouthful.
But maybe there's more where he came from.
Dwarves! I'm done for! Run for it!
Dwarves?
Now that's a supper.
Let's go get them all!
Let us roast them.
Boil them, says I!
Each to his own, boys!
There's plenty for all.
I likes mine raw.
Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!
The sun!
Blast it!
How did the morning come so soon?
We're done for!
Excellent.
One moment. One moment!
Where's that bumbling Burglar?
Lucky number, indeed!
Over here!
Come see what I've found.
Not bad, Burglar, for your first attempt.
Oh, it was nothing, actually.
We'll keep these.
Deucedly fine blades.
Considering they were made by trolls.
They don't seem like troll blades to me.
Probably stolen.
- See these strange runes?
- Whatever are runes?
Ancient writing. Mine has them too.
Can you make them out?
I am not familiar with these letters.
Well, whoever made them, we've got them now!
Cover up the treasure, men.
We'll fetch it on our return.
Take that, Smaug, you filthy worm!
I see you've also claimed a sword.
Yes. Just a dagger, actually.
But for one of my size, it suffices.
Hurry, men, we must be on our way.
- Hold!
- Hold?
It is time for you to have this.
And what may that be?
This is a map of Lonely Mountain...
...presented to me 100 years ago by your father.
What? Why did it not come to me, the rightful heir?
I've chosen my own time to hand it over.
Oh, I do love maps.
I have quite a collection.
I remember the mountain well enough without this!
Indeed? And how do you intend to enter Smaug's chambers?
Through the main gate, as a houseguest?
You'd be ashes before you took your seventh step.
Oh, see, look!
This hand points from these runes to...
Bless my soul! A secret entrance!
- A hidden passage to the lower halls.
- Excellent, Burglar!
- I'm really quite good with maps.
- Let me see.
Yes, quite correct.
But has it remained a secret all these years?
It's too small for Smaug to use.
It's covered by a door made to look exactly like the side of the mountain.
Here is the key. IKeep it safe.
Of course I will!
But if the secret door is hidden, how do we find it?
- The map doesn't tell.
- It does and it doesn't.
You will understand in time.
Behold, at last, Rivendell!
The hidden valley of the elves, where Elrond dwells.
Simply enchanting!
- But we must be on.
- Pity.
Elvish singing is not a thing to miss...
...in June, under the stars. But...
My dear Elrond, your hospitality is magnificent:
The food, the wine, the stories, the music.
Yes, but we've much to accomplish.
You promised to have a look-see at these troll swords.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, first of all, they're not troll-make.
They must have been stolen.
They were made for the Goblin Wars.
This sword, Thorin, the runes name:
Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver!
- And mine?
- Glamdring, the Foe Hammer.
- IKeep them well.
- I will keep this in honor.
- Now show me your map.
- I have it here.
Something strange. Let's see.
Yes, indeed!
There are moon letters here! See?
What are moon letters?
Runes that can only be seen when the moon shines behind them.
They give directions for finding the secret door.
"Stand by the gray stone when the thrush knocks...
...and the last light of the setting sun...
...will shine upon the keyhole."
This way!
Shelter! A dry cave!
Now get some sleep, men.
We've found the perfect place to camp.
Dwarves have a strange notion of perfection.
And where's Gandalf?
Gone again? I wish I was a wizard!
Hello! What's this?
Look out!
The ponies! The ponies!
Wake up! We're being robbed!
The goblins are upon us!
Save the ponies from the goblins!
Trapped! The goblins have us!
Who are these miserable persons?
Thorin at your service.
We did not mean to trespass.
We were merely seeking shelter from the storm.
He is a liar,
O truly tremendous one.
Ask him to explain his weapon!
This sword is named
Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver!
Murderers!
Elf friends!
Stop!
I know that sword!
It is called
Glamdring, the Foe Hammer!
It's Gandalf! Good old Gandalf!
Follow me! Quickly!
Through here! Follow me!
Bilbo!
He's gone!
Where are you?
My precious.
It is my precious.
Hello, my precious.
Bless us and splash us.
Food for my precious.
Eggs and bacon. Spoons all polished.
Warm muffins and sweet butter.
What is that noise, my precious?
My precious does not know.
Bless my soul!
Hello! What's this?
Nice souvenir to show the neighbors back home. If I ever get home.
Who are you?
Bless us, my precious.
A tasty morsel it would make us.
What is it, my precious?
I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins.
I've lost my dwarves, my wizard and my way.
Mind you, I'm armed with an elvish blade!
That's better.
Perhaps you know the way out?
But perhaps we sits here...
...and chats with it a bitsy, my precious?
Lt... likes... riddles?
Do I like riddles?
Well, yes, after a fashion.
It must have a competition with us.
If precious asks and it doesn't answer...
...we eats it, my precious.
Oh, I say!
But if it asks us...
...and we doesn't answer...
...then we...
...shows it...
...the way out!
- It seems I have no choice.
- My precious...
...we makes the first riddle.
Voiceless, it cries
Wingless, flutters
Toothless, bites
Mouthless, mutters
Can it...
...guess...
...the answer?
Half a moment.
Is it nice, my precious?
Is it juicy?
Gooey? Yucky?
Is it scrumptious?
If you please!
Wind! Wind is the answer.
Now, my turn.
A box without hinges, key or lid
Yet golden treasure inside is hid
Let us give us a chance, my precious.
Eggs!
Eggs, it is!
Oh, bother!
Us now! Now us, my precious.
I'm aquiver with anticipation!
Now...
This thing, alls things devours
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers
Gnaws iron, bites steel
Grinds hard stones to meal
Slays king, ruins town
And beats high mountain down
Well, interesting.
Yes, now, let me see.
What does it answer?
What does it answer?
Just a moment now!
My precious...
...will it taste delicious?
It will!
- Give me some time.
- What?
What does it say?!
I said time! Time!
Whatever is the matter?
It guess!
Time is the answer!
It is?
I knew it all along.
That's an old one.
Well, fun's fun.
Now, couldn't we get out of here?
It's got to ask us another riddle, my precious!
Blast, I can't think of another one.
Ask! Ask!
Oh, very well.
- What have I got in my pocket?
- Not fair!
Not fair to ask my precious...
...what it's got in its nasty...
...little pocketeses!
I'm sorry. That's my riddle.
And if you can't guess it, you lose and show me out!
My precious loses!
But first...
...my precious shows it...
...his something pretty.
- You wish to show me something?
- My birthday present.
Wait! Where are you going?
My precious finds a ring...
...on his birthday...
...long ago.
A golden ring.
A magic ring!
We must get my precious' birthday present from its hiding place.
Now what?
He'll never guess my pocket contained this.
Bless my soul!
Where is it?
My golden ring! My magic ring!
Lost, it is.
Lost!
Lost!
Curse us and crush us! My ring, lost!
My precious remembers.
He wears it before.
And he drops it on the shore!
Curse it! Curse the Baggins!
He's found it! My ring!
My birthday present!
My, he does carry on.
Bless my soul!
The ring?
Most definitely.
My precious will find it!
Will find it! The Baggins.
My precious will crush it...
...and smash it!
Better douse this.
Where is it?
Where is it?
It is tricksy.
It says it doesn't know the way out...
...but it knows the way in, my precious.
It must...
...know a way out!
It's off for the back door.
My precious must make haste to the back door.
To the back door!
How convenient.
Well, follow the leader.
It's not here, my precious.
It's make an escape!
Ta-ta!
Thief!
Thief!
Baggins!
We hates it!
Hates it forever!
Gollum thought I knew the way out and was trying to head me off.
I merely followed him to the exit.
We had to fight our way through the goblin guard.
- How is it they didn't see you?
- Oh, well...
...the art of burgling is really, you know...
...the art of being unobtrusive.
Invisible, so to speak.
Your story has the ring of truth.
Yes, it rings true.
You need say no more.
We'd best get a move on.
There are still goblins about.
Oh, bother! More mountains?
No. Don't you see?
The sun is setting in the west, behind the mountains.
We're on the other side, to the edge of the land beyond.
- The Wargs!
- With the goblins!
- Help!
- We can't go any higher!
- My arms.
- My poor legs! My legs!
But what will they do with us?
Drop us to our deaths?
Who knows?
But they've brought us a far distance with no dropping!
Behold, the River of Wilderland below!
By thunder!
They're taking us to the edge of Mirkwood Forest...
...to dash us against those rocks,
I know it!
O Great Lord of the Eagles...
...we are eternally grateful for your gallant rescue.
I have not forgotten the arrow...
...that brought me down so many years ago.
I have not forgotten the wizard...
...who found me and healed my wound.
And now...
...farewell, wherever you fare...
...till your aeries receive you at the journey's end.
So this is the Forest of Mirkwood.
Terrible place, if I remember.
And dangerous.
Now, now.
The map shows the safest path.
Follow it closely, straight through the forest.
Don't stray off the track.
If you do, you will never get out.
You speak as if you weren't going with us.
I'm not. I have pressing business away south.
- Oh, no! He can't mean it.
- What will we do without Gandalf?
Please, don't leave us.
I'm already late because of bothering with you people.
I'm sending Mr. Baggins with you.
That should be enough.
- Mr. Baggins?
- Bilbo?
The burglar?
Me? I'm no equal to a wizard!
Nonsense. You are the lucky number.
And you'll soon find out there's more about you than you guess.
You, sir, will be my surrogate.
My replacement, so to say.
Here is paper and a marker.
IKeep a strict log of your journey...
...so I may study it when we meet again and point out your missteps.
I can only do my best.
Then that will have to suffice.
To Gandalf:
As per your instructions...
...I am keeping this log of our journey through Mirkwood Forest.
I shall make good use of it someday as a basis for my memoirs...
...which I intend to call:
There and Back Again:
A Hobbit's Holiday.
The days are terrible, and the nights are impossible...
...for we are hungry and thirsty.
The berries which grow here are hideous.
Everything about these woods is unpleasant.
One day we decided someone...
...should climb to the top of the tallest tree and have a look.
I couldn't argue. My contract is vague on several points.
There are moments...
...which can change a person for all time.
And I suddenly wondered if I would ever see my snug hobbit hole again.
I wondered if I actually wanted to.
I awoke the next morning to a hideous surprise.
Now I will give you a name.
And I shall call you Sting!
The rest of the morning
I spent seeking my companions.
And I found them, finally, in a place as black and terrible...
...as a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away.
They'll make fine eating...
...when they've hung a bit!
Go away!
Go away!
Bombur!
I certainly could not let my companions, my comrades...
...become a meal for those hideous spiders. Action was called for.
You are all free. I know the spiders' poisons have made you weak.
But you must follow me. Quickly!
Look! On the path ahead.
There it is.
It has freed our supper.
Now we see you!
We will eat you and leave your skin hanging in the tree.
Grab it!
I can hold them off!
Run to the wood-elves' clearing!
But, how can you...?
I will do the stinging! Run.
Swiftly now.
We've trapped it now.
Close the circle.
It can't escape us!
Lazy lob! Attercop!
Blast! What is it?
What is it called?
Sting! Sting! Sting!
Away! Retreat!
We are no match for Sting!
I joined my companions at the clearing of the wood-elves.
But when I found them,
I was in for another surprise.
The wood-elves had returned, but armed for battle.
The dwarves, weakened by their encounter with the spiders...
...gave up without a struggle.
We traveled all day and night.
Finally, we came to the palace of the Elf King...
...which was at the very eastern edge of the forest.
We'd come all the way through...
...only to end up as prisoners.
- Why did you dwarves try to attack?
- No attack!
We came to beg. We were starving.
Why were you in the woods in the first place?
- That is our business.
- Very well.
Take them away until they feel inclined to tell the truth...
...even if they wait 100 years!
Greed. The fortune we were after was big enough to share with the elves.
They'd make valuable allies against that old worm Smaug.
Instead, they became the enemy, and we were their prisoners.
And even though my invisibility allowed me to move about with ease...
...I had no way of opening the locks.
So it was weeks before I found a way to free my companions.
The river flowed under the caves.
Deliveries of fine wines were brought up the river...
...by human men who lived on Long Lake.
Now, wood-elves enjoy their wine, and the barrels were soon drained.
Oh, stop complaining!
I never promised to burgle you first-class accommodations.
I'd come far, and through many adventures, to see it...
...and now I did not like the look of it at all!
Within hours we'd reached the human colony called Laketown.
A precise, if not too imaginative name...
...for the village was actually built on the surface of Long Lake.
The descendants of the men of Dale still dared to dwell...
...and do business in the shadow of old Smaug's mountain.
I am Thorin...
...grandson of
IKing Under the Mountain!
I have returned!
Hail, Thorin Oakenshield.
I am Bard the guardsman.
We are honored by your presence.
Your grandfather lives in our songs and legends.
What help we can offer will be yours, and we trust to your gratitude...
...when the dragon Smaug is killed and your kingdom is regained.
We were fed, fattened, given supplies...
...and two weeks later found us nearing the end of our journey.
And chances were it would be a very horrible end, indeed.
That smell!
I've not smelled dragon before.
All the halls within must be filled with his foul reek.
And while Smaug slept inside...
...we spent our days searching for that elusive secret door.
Then, one afternoon...
And so, Gandalf, while I wait, I inscribe the final pages of your log.
My only companion is an annoying bird, cracking snails.
"Stand by the gray stone when the thrush knocks...
...and the last light of the setting sun...
...will shine upon the keyhole."
Oh, my goodness!
Wake up! Wake up! It's happening!
By thunder!
There it is!
Thorin, before it's gone again, use your key.
Well, here we are.
But what now?
Now is the time for our esteemed
Mr. Baggins to perform the service...
...for which he was included in our company.
You must earn your reward.
We do have a contract.
You think it's my job to go in first?
I've already gotten you out of two messes not in the original bargain.
And who will come with me?
Any of you?
I see.
Well, you are the burglar.
Go down and burgle something.
Very well. I won't refuse.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I've begun to trust my luck more than in the old days.
Now you're in for it at last,
Bilbo Baggins.
Why are you here?
You've no use for dragon treasures.
Feel the worm's heat, Mr. Baggins?
A few more steps and you shall see...
...the old dragon Smaug at last.
You can still turn back, you know.
But to go on, to take those steps...
...that would be the bravest of all moments.
Whatever happens afterwards is nothing.
Yes, here is where you fight...
...your real battle,
Mr. Bilbo Baggins.
Do you go back?
Well, thief...
...I smell you, feel your air.
I hear your breath.
Come along!
Help yourself. There's plenty, and to spare.
Thank you, oh, Smaug the Magnificent.
I did not come for presents.
I only wish to have a look at you...
...and see if you are truly as great as tales say.
I did not believe them.
Do you now?
They fall utterly short of reality...
...O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities!
You have nice manners, for a thief...
...and a liar.
You know me...
...but I don't remember smelling you before.
Who are you and where do you come from?
I come from under the hill.
And under the hill and over the hills my paths led.
And through the air.
I am he that walks unseen.
You make riddles?
What is your name?
I am the lucky number, the web-cutter, the spider-stinger...
Lovely titles.
I am he that drowns his friends and draws them alive again from the water.
I am the guest of eagles, the ring-winner and luck-wearer...
...the clue-finder and the barrel-rider.
Barrel-rider, eh?
Then I have guessed your riddle!
You are one of those miserable...
...tub-thumping Lake-men!
You and your town shall pay dearly for this intrusion!
So the Lake-men would steal my treasure?
Wait! You don't know everything.
Not gold alone brought me hither.
Be done with your riddles!
What else brought you, Lake-man?
Revenge!
Revenge?
Surely you realize that your success...
...has made you some bitter enemies.
Revenge? You? Ha!
I am Smaug!
I kill what I wish!
I am strong...
...strong...
...strong!
My armor is like tenfold shields...
...my teeth are like swords...
...my claws, spears...
...the shock of my tail...
...a thunderbolt!
My wings...
...a hurricane!
And my breath...
...death!
Well?
Well?!
Where are your riddles now?
Very, very impressive.
However...
...I have always understood that dragons...
...were soft underneath. Vulnerable.
Especially in the region of the chest.
You have heard wrong!
I am armored both above and below.
Well, I don't know about that.
You "don't know about that."
I shall show you!
Look!
What do you say to this?
Rare and wonderful, eh?
Dazzling!
Marvelous!
Perfect!
Flawless!
Staggering! Mag...
Old fool!
There's a patch in the hollow of your left breast...
...as bare as a snail out of its shell.
What's that?
More riddles?
No, my riddling is done.
I really must not detain
Your Magnificence any longer.
Sorry you could not find me. But a fine burglar takes expert catching.
Burglar?
Burglar!
Thief! Fire! Murderer!
- We should have gone with him!
- To be roasted alive?
It's the burglar!
Three cheers for good old Bilbo!
Thank you! But I'd appreciate a more pragmatic salute.
In other words...
...extinguish me!
There we go! There we go!
Always glad to help a friend.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
Never mind that.
What did you burgle?
This.
What's that?
Earthquake?
Into the secret passage!
Our only chance!
Barrel-rider!
Thieving Lake-man!
Your people shall see my vengeance!
The Lake-people are doomed unless...
Yes! You, who are a mere thrush, and yet so much more.
You have seen Smaug.
You know his vulnerable spot!
Go now, to Laketown. There is a guardsman, Bard. Tell him!
This breeze is strangely warm for autumn.
Bard! What's that?
The dragon is coming, or I'm a fool!
Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!
The dragon! Old Smaug!
Awake after all these years!
The dragon is coming!
Ready? As he passes over...
Arrows!
Stand your ground. Rearm!
Away, you fool bird! Away!
You speak?
Bilbo Baggins?
He found what?
Yes! I'll look.
Jove! You speak the truth, old thrush!
Black arrow, you've never failed me.
I've always recovered you.
I had you from my father and he from of old.
If you came from the true king's forges under the mountain...
...go now and speed well!
Now I am king!
Stop!
There is only one IKing Under the Mountain, and I am he...
...Thorin!
Hail Thorin!
Hip-hip-hooray!
Now, now...
...there's much to be done.
We must catalog our wealth.
Dear me! And pack it for shipment.
Join the fun, Burglar!
Part of this is yours!
Might be mine!
What if Smaug returns?
Oh, he's been gone for a week now!
Found greener pastures, no doubt.
Has this wealth made you mad?
We must find our way out of this mountain...
...and see if he's gone, and quickly!
According to this map, the main gate lies in this direction.
Follow me, gentlemen!
Bless my soul.
What are they?
Is the entire valley floor populated by giant fireflies?
Not fireflies, fires! Campfires!
Nonsense! Only an army would need that many fires.
No, my friend. Two armies!
Bard of Laketown? What did you say?
Two armies!
Smaug is dead. I have slain him.
The thrush delivered your message.
Really? Splendid news, old fellow.
I hoped he would!
My people have made me king.
IKing? Really? Congratulations!
Couldn't happen to a nicer chap.
I don't know how to thank you.
Our town is destroyed and must be rebuilt.
You can thank us by sharing your fortune.
Why, of course, of course.
There's plenty for all.
Wait! The fortune is ours and belongs to dwarves alone!
It wouldn't be yours if Smaug still lived.
A technicality.
- So you brought two armies to take it?
- I brought one army.
The other is mine!
You, who threw us into the dungeon?
My people have suffered greatly from the worm through the years.
We demand retribution.
Never!
Why not? There's enough for all in this mountain.
It's a matter of principle, of honor!
Then tomorrow we take it!
We will meet at sunrise on the field of battle.
You are hopelessly outnumbered.
This is ridiculous!
Quiet! What does a burglar know of these matters?
Then tomorrow it is!
This is deucedly uncomfortable.
I'm certain to get a rash.
That armor was forged in the foundries of my grandfather.
Wear it proudly and it will carry you to victory!
Confusticate and bebother victory!
My only hope is to be taken prisoner as quickly as possible.
Those are the words of a coward.
The coward who flushed out Smaug?
The coward who saved you time and time again?
The coward who always went forward while you cringed behind?
You don't see us cringing now, do you?
This is madness!
Fourteen against 10,000...
...and yet you march off to certain destruction...
...as merrily as if you were on your way to a tea party.
Your kind will never understand war, hobbit.
This is war. War!
Our lookout has spied something!
O great IKing Under the Mountain!
- Balin, it's only Thorin!
- Quiet!
- Yes, general?
- "General"?
Another army approaches from the northeast!
An army of our kind.
An army of dwarves!
- My cousin Dain from the Iron Hills?
- None other!
Ha! Now we are not outnumbered!
Now we have an army!
- A battle of three armies?
- To war!
Onward!
Forward!
To battle!
- Scurvy dwarves!
- Thieving dwarves!
IKill them!
- Chop them!
- Take their heads!
IKill the men! IKill the elves!
Save the gold for ourselves!
I'd rather be back in Hobbiton.
- Who's that old man?
- Get out of the way!
Move, you old fool!
Old fool?
Gandalf!
Halt!
I would speak with the kings!
Dread has come upon you all!
An army of goblins with claim to the treasure comes from the north!
Behold!
They ride upon wolves!
O great Elf IKing, my truest friend and ally.
We must join forces against this kind of scourge.
But of course, O noble
IKing Under the Mountain.
Your people are like brothers unto mine.
My men and all their weapons are as one with yours.
Together we will vanquish the foul foe!
Together!
Thorin is correct. I simply do not understand war.
A battle of four armies.
One, two, three... Yes, four!
Our cause is hopeless!
The goblins are too powerful!
We'll spill much of their blood before the day's finished!
If these be our last moments, let us live them with honor!
Hold! All is not lost.
The goblins have many enemies.
There is yet still another army on the way.
The eagles!
Five armies now?
Mr. Bilbo Baggins, enough is enough.
Bombur! You're hurt!
I still live. And you?
A slight wound. Crack on the head.
Out for hours. What happened?
We won.
Bombur gone too?
Of our original 13, how many are left?
Seven.
And Thorin?
Soon there will be only six.
I have brought him.
Farewell, good thief.
I wish to part in friendship...
...and take back my words at the gate.
There are many words I would take back also.
And does it take this...
...to make us see each other?
- Thorin!
- Hush.
You are no coward, my friend.
I am sorry I so named you.
- This is not important...
- And I was wrong.
You did understand war.
It was I who did not.
Until now.
Farewell, IKing Under the Mountain.
Child of the kindly west.
I have come to know...
...if more of us valued your ways...
...food and cheer above hoarded gold...
...it would be a merrier world.
But sad or merry...
...I must leave it now.
- Farewell.
- Farewell, Thorin.
You take only two tiny bags of gold home with you?
Your share was greater.
It's all my pony could carry, and it's more than I'll ever need.
But you have other prizes.
The ring? Oh, yes.
I'll keep it as a souvenir, in a glass box on the mantel.
And so the prophecies of old have come true.
Smaug is gone and the goblins driven away.
The dwarves and elves live in peace...
...and the men thrive, multiply and build a civilization.
Prophecies!
- What?
- I had a hand in all that!
You disbelieve the prophecies because you helped bring them about?
You don't really suppose...
...that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck...
...just for your sole benefit?
You're a very fine person,
Mr. Baggins. I'm very fond of you...
...but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all.
Thank goodness!
Yes, you will return to your home...
...place your souvenir ring on your mantel...
...publish your story, which you believe has come to its end...
What do you mean, believe has come to an end?
It has, hasn't it?
Oh, Bilbo Baggins, if you really understood that ring...
...as someday members of your family not yet born will...
...then you'd realize that this story has not ended...
...but is only beginning.
The world blew up
in a thousand atomic fireballs.
The first blast was set off
by five terrorists.
It took two million years...
for some of the radioactive clouds
to allow some sun in.
By then, only a handful
of humans survived.
The rest of humanity had
changed into hideous mutants.
These mutant species
floundered in the bad areas...
radioactive lands that never allowed
them to become human again...
and made each birth a new disaster.
Then, in the good lands...
they came back,
arising from their long sleep...
fairies, elves, dwarves...
the true ancestors of man.
They lived happily in the good areas.
It was a big day in Montagar.
Delia, queen of the fairies...
was presiding over the feast of plenty...
celebrating 3,000 years of peace.
In the midst of the celebration...
Delia felt a pull from the skies.
She looked up
and saw dark clouds...
forming on the horizon in every direction.
She fell into a trance
and left the party...
heading for her home on a high hill.
At first, the fairies were puzzled.
But then they too felt
a force drawing them to follow.
Delia was alone inside.
The storm grew until
it was a raging cyclone...
hovering over the dwelling.
One of the older fairies
ventured inside the house.
There lay Delia on her bed...
holding a pair of twins in her arms.
The older fairy instantly knew that...
these were not ordinary twins,
but magical wizards.
The baby wizards were
polarized like magnets...
one attracting with a magnetic draw...
the other repelling
and impossible to get near.
Avatar, the kind and good wizard...
spent much of his boyhood...
entertaining his mother
with beautiful visions.
Blackwolf, the mutant wizard...
would never visit his mother...
and spent his time
torturing small animals.
More years passed,
and Delia continued to slip.
Finally, all life drained out of her...
and Avatar held her hand
trying desperately to use
his magic to restore her.
He cradled her in his arms and wept.
When Blackwolf found that
his mother had died, he was excited...
for now he felt he would take over
her leadership and rule the land.
When Avatar confronted
Blackwolf, he was enraged.
They began a furious battle.
Each using his magic, they continued...
until they had nearly destroyed each other.
But Avatar's magic was stronger...
because he had the emotional loss
of his mother that drove him on.
Blackwolf was defeated.
"The day will come, my brother,
when I will return...
and make this a planet
where mutants rule. "
Blackwolfheaded off,
leaving Avatar very disturbed.
The time has come.
Kill!
Well, hello, handsome.
Hello, honey.
He is called Necron 99.
He is one of Blackwolf's assassins.
He travels the land destroying
the believers of magic.
 "My children,
the only true technology is nature.
"All the other forms
of manmade technology...
"are perversions.
"The ancient dictators used technology... to enslave the masses."
- Weehawk, can't we stay here for tonight?
- No.
Just for a few hours' rest.
- I sense something.
- But the road is clear.
We haven't seen an assassin for days.
A clever assassin stays hidden.
Avatar must be warned.
Our mission is nearly over, Westwind... but now it's time for one final run.
Damn it!
- Well?
- They're not back yet, my president.
- They're really late now, aren't they, old wizard?
Bad magic, isn't it?
And if they don't show... you'll know no more than you did before.
- How true, fairy goddess of the New World... but if they don't show...
I think that will tell us something too.
Damn it, Avatar! If there's any danger... maybe we should... maybe we should arm our states.
- Science and technology?
- There's no time for that.
Even if we could impress our people with the danger... science and technology were outlawed... millions of years ago... and, we must admit... it's been a peaceful world since then.
Enough, Wizard!
I demand to know what you know...
- or I'll banish you!
Banish him?
But, Father, who will teach me... all the magic I've left to learn?
Only Avatar can make me... a full-fledged fairy.
As you can see, I'm only half there.
All right. All right.
I'll tell you... if you think you can handle it.
What do you know
about war, about bombs...
that could turn
a planet molten and liquid?
To think it could start again... ten million years after the final one.
Sometimes I get tired of being so old.
Sometimes... being a wizard is lonely at the top.
We're waiting, old, old wizard.
You know about my brother.
Well, as the years passed...
I searched for my brother in vain.
He had settled in the dark land of Scortch...
where people still died of radiation.
 For 5,000 years,
Blackwolf studied black arts...
increasing his wisdom 10,000-fold.
He built a small following
of frog-like creatures...
but needed more troops
for his evil plans.
He then formed an army
whose generals were called up...
from the black shadows of hell.
Souls who waited for untold eternities
for a new leader...
Blackwolf's tremendous power...
enslaved them all to carry out his will.
Then stories of Blackwolf's armies...
attacking neighboring countries came back.
Demons of hell armed with black magic...
but they would get bored...
or sidetracked in the middle of battle...
and give up, running home.
Fritz! Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!
Those despicable, animal warmongers!
They've killed Fritz!
Take that! Take this!
Take that, you green slime!
- You black-hearted, short bow-legged...
- Max!
Max, I'm okay! I'm okay, Max.
Just a scratch.
- Look, I'm all right.
- Oh. Oh, damn.
There you go again stepping on my lines... raining on my parade, costing me medals.
Oh, damn!
Ohh. Oh, Fritz?
Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!
Take this! Take that! They killed Fritz!
They could easily have won,
but they lacked...
the motivation and inspiration.
Blackwolfknew he needed more.
He sent his huge armies out
to excavate ancient ruins...
for links to the past.
Tales reached Avatar that bits and pieces
of pre-holocaust technology...
were being dug up and marched
back to Scortch I.
With these ancient pieces...
he built a new war machine.
Still, his generals
needed more to fight with.
This drove Blackwolf mad with frustration.
Then one day, that frustration vanished.
I sent my elf spies to find out what was happening.
I'm sure he has found some great power... that will control his armies.
You mean you sent out that elf envoy... to investigate based on a vague feeling of your...
I've failed you, my wizard.
I've failed you, my president.
What news do you bring?
The lights went out! The lights went out!
Necron 99 has destroyed himself.
It's done!
With the assassination of the presidents of the free states... comes their fall... and that of my brother.
It's done.
We have four more lights left, sir... four more.
It's not important!
The main exterminations are complete.
The remaining countries are now ruled...
by second-rate incompetents...
so confused...
that even now they blame the killings...
on those within their own ranks.
It's time to strike!
Sieg heil.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, lard bottom.
- Get up. Blackwolf's callin'.
- I don't want to go.
Hey, when Blackwolf calls, we go.
- I don't want to fight anymore.
- Ya gotta.
- I don't want to hurt things anymore.
- Hey, you're so stupid.
Listen, I ain't stupid. Just listen.
You know what I mean, trees, birds, butterflies...
Everything's got a right to live. You know what I mean?
- Hey...
- Everything! Everything's got a right to live.
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Butterflies...
Blackwolf's got a secret weapon that makes us invincible.
We can't lose.
Right, left. Right, left.
Right, left. Right, left...
It will never work.
People don't want war.
It destroyed this planet, its people... and all records of past civilizations.
Not all records, as you'll soon find out.
Attention!
Leaders of tomorrow's master race!
The time has come, as I promised...
a time when I reveal to you... my loyal followers...
the ancient secret of war... the key to creating hysteria... fear... gods.
Behold!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
Blackmark's army's come again!
Our cousin elves are already in the trenches.
It's our loved land too.
For Elfin and Fairyland, united we fly.
Hey, Elfie, do you hear those drums?
Sure do, Peewhittle.
I don't believe those blokes are gonna try it again.
I'm scared.
Now don't be, governor.
You're too young to remember... but Blackwolf must have lost one million men here... last time he tried to invade.
And if Blackwolf's
stupid enough to try it again...
he'll lose twice more.
Them goblins and demons... just look mean, but they're yellow.
They got no cause to fight.
They always give up and run
with our arrows chasing them...
all the way home.
It's always been that way and will always be the same.
Ain't that the truth, boys?
Weehawk, what's that
old wizard been doing for four hours?
If he's looking for answers from that assassin... my father's sword can get it quicker than brain reading.
Cool down.
Cool down.
I got it, and it ain't good.
The key is a dream machine... that inspires armies with ancient war images.
It must be destroyed.
It is in Blackwolf's castle in the land of Scortch.
When do we leave?
Leave?
What do you mean, leave?
You got to be kidding.
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
Just wake me up when the planet's destroyed.
- Well, I'm not too old. I'll go myself.
- Very noble.
We're going.
I must avenge my father's death.
It ain't no fairyland out there, kid.
But all right, all right.
I was just testing you.
Well?
- Well, what?
- Well, what now?
Uh, I don't know.
Oh, why don't you sit there for a couple hours while I figure it out?
Okay.
- Uh, Avatar.
- All right. All right.
How do we find this machine?
This creature, uh,
I shall call him Peace.
Peace?
In the hopes that he will bring it.
He's somehow wired to the machine.
And the only freedom he'll ever have from its painful grip... is in its destruction.
Go now, both of you, and prepare for the journey.
- I'll reason with him when he awakens.
- Avatar, you're not that old.
She's gotta be kiddin'.
Looks like my brother and I now begin our final battle.
Weehawk spent a night
saying good-bye to his tribe...
asking them to protect his family...
and to name a new chief
ifhe did not return.
Elinore said good-bye to her father
and then the other fairies of her kind.
She told them she will return
as queen of Montagar...
her father's death revenged...
and herself a full-fledged fairy.
Well, they're here, nut.
I'll be right down, heroes.
All right, creep.
Now, before I untie you...
I wanna tell you a couple things.
And I want you to listen and listen carefully.
This has been the biggest bummer of a trip I've ever been on.
If you let me down or you hurt my friends...
especially the broad...
I got stuff planned for you...
- that'll take 20 years to kill you.
- No pain.
And you'll be screaming for mercy
in the first five seconds.
Peace wants love... wants free, will help.
Look, just get us there, you got it?
Don't be sad,
Elinore.
I'll kill that monster as soon as he shows us that projector.
Are you kids ready?
You know, this Peace here,
he knows every step towards Scortch.
I promised him life without pain... uh, life without fear...
- I still don't trust him.
- H-Hey.
You're both forgetting you have the protection of a powerful wizard here.
Damn it.
He's getting older but not much bolder.
I wonder if I packed my scotch.
Sing us a song, Elinore.
I don't want to.
But that's why we brought you. Come on.
Where's daddy? What is he doing?
He's guarding our home, son.
There's been a war, and this land has lost.
Why can't we fight and win, Mommy?
Because they have
weapons and technology.
Wejust have love.
Hey, Louie, What are we gonna do with the prisoners?
How do I know?
They're findin' out right now.
Duuuhhh.
What is this place?
- Dumbo, it's religion, man.
Ain't you heard?
- Religion?
Yeah. Blackwolf says the responsibilities of the prisoners... is up to the priests inside.
Now, what we got to do, dumbo... is reconnoiter the priests and find out.
What is all this?
Bits and pieces of religion, man.
What's the matter
with you?
Holy objects they saved
for millions of years, man.
- What are we looking for?
- Hey, so dumb.
We're looking for the priests, man, the priests.
Why?
I don't know.
I guess because you need
God on your side, stupid.
Who's that?
Who's that?
- That's them. Them. Them.
- Who's that?
Uh, listen, you guys.
We hates to interrupt you, you know.
- We're sorry.
- Yeah. But, uh, you see, Blackwolf...
- you know, our führer...
- It wasn't our fault.
Uh, shut up, will you?
Blackwolf, the führer,
started this war, see.
We got all these prisoners
we don't want to feed...
We ain't got time for that.
Wejust got time for war.
So, we were, uh...
I want to ask you guys...
He's asking you, not me.
Yeah, I'm asking if you want
to take care of'em, it's okay with us.
- Me too. Me too.
- Yeah, see?
- Yeah. Okay, dumbo.
- Okay.
- My sons, you say you are the victors.
- Uh-huh.
- But there is only one victor.
- Mmm.
That's Him.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Patience.
- We must first observe sundown and pray.
- He's got a point.
Hear us, O Lord. Hear our petition.
O Lord, we cry out to you.
Lord, hear our prayer.
Hear the prayers of thy humble servants.
O Lord, God, Lord, God... do not fail us in our hour of need.
We need you, O Lord.
We cry to you, O Lord.
Lord, help us.
Help us, O Lord.
We need you. We cry to you.
We cry out to you!
Hey, enough already.
O Lord, God, Lord, God.
All right, it's been five hours.
Time's up.
Okay, Charlie. It's no good.
- Put plan "A" to work.
- It's about time.
Okay, babe. They ain't gonna talk.
- Gimme plan "B".
- Hey, what's plan "B"?
Hey, hey, hey. Watch.
Will the birth be soon?
Very soon, my Lord.
You're young to be queen.
But deliver me a son...
and you shall help me rule this planet.
I don't want to rule this planet, my Lord.
- Just our kingdom is enough.
- Enough?
Enough for mutants to stay in their place, huh?
Live with radiation so our bodies crawl with hell?
We will live in the good lands.
My son will grow where there isn't death... in the very waters we drink and the air we breathe.
Wise men... will my son be human or mutant?
Mutant, the charts say, my Lord.
The next one won't be.
Do not have it killed, Oh, Lord!
It is not his fault!
Wait a minute, Avatar.
Peace is taking us towards the mountain fairies' domain.
We should go around.
Avatar, why is Peace stopping?
Fairy bad.
Not good. Go around.
Coming from Mr. Nice guy here... those fairies must be something else.
Go on, nut. We'd lose time.
Bad fairies.
Elves and fairies are bad-blood cousins.
I'm not in the mood for their pranks.
They may have useful information.
Don't worry. Time has passed.
Much of the rivalry between fairy and elf has subsided.
Barbarians.
Gee, they're adorable.
Oh. Hey!
# Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha #
Holy chrome!
Oh. Hey.
By my sword, that is no way to treat a lady.
Hey! Oh!
Stop this childish display.
Why, even at elves' houses,
I've seen more sophisticated magic.
All right. All right. You've had it.
This is Avatar the Great you're fooling with.
Avatar, consul and wizard of your great-grandfathers' consuls...
who was turned into Avatar the Old.
Yeah, that's me...
Avatar the Old now... but I still got my powers.
And you've cost me my patience.
I call upon all forces of darkness.
Oh, winds of abysses howling through the stars...
and eons of centuries.
O Lords of the Whirlwind,
black, gray and white...
I call upon you.
Oh, ever-increasing darkness...
shapeless and mindless beings...
corroded and rotten
in your hearts, body and mind...
I summon you from your ancient, timeless travels... to ride the winds of blackness.
And cabash!
Please accept our apologies for the behavior of some our more carefree brothers.
I'm Sean, leader of the Knights of Stardust... protectors of Dolan, king of the mountain fairies.
We have prepared a feast to welcome you to our humble domain.
Listen here, you little winged squirt.
- Do you realize...
- Oh, Avatar, stop being so grumpy.
Oh... I... Hey, Oh...
Ohh.
All right. Okay. Okay.
I'm Avatar the Great, as you've heard.
Now, this here is Elinore, queen of Montagar.
What brings you here?
Oh, we're on a quest
to the land of Scortch.
 You're heading for Scortch?
I'm afraid you're in for trouble.
Will you tell us what you know?
Steady, Westwind.
We'll eat alone, lest we sit with fools.
Meecher, where's Peace?
- Arise, you fools!
- Hey, what's that?
Assassin! Technology...
By the soul of Dulac and Rackham!
- Elinore is gone!
- It was Peace!
I knew we should have killed him when we had the chance!
Never mind. We must find Elinore.
The fairies have taken her into the mountain.
Hey, there's no time to waste.
No one's ever been to the fairy sanctuary before.
- It's forbidden to all.
- Drums.
It begins.
Quickly now, or all is lost.
You must save Elinore. Hurry, old fool.
Morro crinkle frizetta.
Enough magic, old man. Run!
Very bad. Not good. Not good.
Destroy her! She's party to death!
Sean is dead! Killed by lies and human technology.
Will it be brother against brother here too?
Only humans kill their own kind.
She allowed technology and death... into the Golden Circle.
She is a traitor.
Traitor?
You fools, release me.
Stay back!
As the king's guards... we can't allow you near until the king has ruled.
No one rules over Elinore of Montagar.
We rule.
We rule over death, lies, and deceit.
We rule.
She's emoting. I feel her pain.
It hurts! It hurts!
Wow!
Avatar never told me
I had full fairy powers.
He said I wasn't ready yet.
I told you, she's dangerous.
Destroy her while there's still time.
I say destroy her, king's rule or not.
Now why'd you want to go and do that for, love?
It's hard enough controlling them as it is.
Release me, or I, Elinore, shall show all you ants something.
- Stop him, miss. Stop him!
- Oh, did I do that?
Stop! I command you to cease.
Okay. Leave everyone alone.
I say, miss, you better stop him.
I think it would be better if you released me and we all ran away.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Holy chrome.
Elinore's really gone and done it.
It's all a disaster.
Well, old man, what are you going to do about it?
You better hurry, miss.
Avatar the Great...
- coming.
- Avatar!
Yeah.
You can kill me now, I'm sure.
I've given myself to you.
- I make no attempt to save myself.
- Save yourself?
Save yourself? Save me!
I can't, Elinore.
The only one who could might be the king here.
My mission, O Lord, is to save the world from another holocaust.
Sean was killed not by us,
but by my brother's assassins...
who have been sent to kill
Weehawk, Elinore...
Peace, and myself
before we reach Scortch.
For all I know and fear,
Weehawk is dead.
So might be Peace.
I ask for permission to take the girl and myself... to try to complete our mission alone...
though it does seem doomed now.
I will not allow you to hurt Elinore... without a fight by myself.
My brother lies, my good King!
Avatar! Avatar!
What will it be, King?
Time's getting short.
Avatar, could you hurry up a little bit?
We have been sent death... images and humans... each with a different story.
Something happening here.
Not you, please. Oh, no.
I have always been very good... and could even be better sometimes.
It starts again.
The only act that has been real so far... is the fact that Avatar did not break his word.
When the arrow struck him, he did not fight back.
And from what we all heard
about Avatar's power...
- that is surely the sign of truth.
We will neither join nor hinder nor help these two.
We will wait and see.
That is our decision.
Well, we're out of there.
Ouch!
Thanks.
I forgot about that.
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no, no. Let me help you.
How's that?
It's very pretty, Avatar.
Yeah, well, it could be warmer.
We might as well begin.
This is the way, I think.
Scortch lies somewhere over these mountains.
Well, good morning.
Cozy morning, huh?
Avatar, we're trapped.
It's nothing a little
hard work won't cure.
Here. Follow me, Snow Queen.
I'm so cold, so cold.
Is it much farther?
Elinore, we've rested long enough.
We'd better move on.
Just a little while longer, Avatar.
I'm so tired.
Well, okay.
I'll go over and see if I can see a pass or a path or a... or a house or... something.
Oh, my God.
They're our own tracks.
We've been moving in circles.
I better not tell Elinore.
It'll do her no good.
Avatar, riders!
Run! Assassins come to finish the job!
We'll cut their throats.
Let them come.
Right. I'll zap them back to Scortch.
They split up.
Going to come at us from each end.
- Avatar, we really tried, didn't we?
- Yes, Elinore.
That's all anyone really could have done.
Steady.
Here they come.
Braxis plaxis traxis!
Montagar forever.
Death, assassins!
Peace! Peace, we found them!
We found them!
What took you so long?
Quickly, Peace. Quickly.
Let's get them off this glacier.
The quest is saved.
 The night
was spent in the protection of a cave.
Elinore and Weehawk slept as
Avatar counseled with Peace...
on the quickest route to Scortch.
The journey took them past the ruins...
of ancient civilizations.
Strange beasts lurked about...
but the dangerous mutants
that lived there were gone...
gone to Blackwolf's army.
All they left were their wives,
hurling insults and rocks...
as the party passed through.
Then finally, the desert.
Yeah, I feel it too.
Please do not attempt to draw your gun.
Avatar, you old fool! You've come!
Oh!
Our father's returned.
Avatar... fighter!
Avatar... father, mother, freedom!
Love, life!
We've been camping in the desert... away from prying eyes.
- Where did you get the guns, Abdul?
- Guns!
Well, we got them from old Blackwolf himself.
You mean you joined with...
No, no.
We ambushed a wolf patrol... took everything except their women... and two days from now, we attack Scortch I.
What do you mean, attack?
The remaining elves of the free world... have joined under my banner.
That banner will be carried to Scortch I.
Join us, old wizard.
We desperately need you.
Is this how you're repayin' me?
Stand back.
Avatar will not be touched.
When our world was young, so was mighty Avatar.
Misty moons ago...
he strode this planet like a messiah...
curing radiation sickness
from man and bird...
cleaning the planet of its filth.
It was Avatar who fought alongside my father... against the first mutant attack.
So now we have our messiah back again.
He's going to destroy
his brother for us.
With what?
A woman-child, one elf... and a moron robot.
Oh, Avatar.
- What is it?
- It's Blackwolf.
He's trying to gain control.
Back! Back!
Back to hell!
You can't have him!
You did it.
You beat the demon.
What's happened?
Well, I suddenly felt very sorry for Peace... so I went over to him, and I took his hand and I tried to comfort him.
Peace is in constant mental battle with Blackwolf.
Your kind words took his mind off the battle.
It allowed Blackwolf his chance.
Avatar. What's that?
Trapped.
- Jump, Peace!
- Jump, Peace!
Elinore!
Elinore!
Ah, I don't know.
I just don't know.
I don't know what happened to Elinore.
Betrayal of Elinore to the quest has broken his heart.
There is nothing wrong with him.
Tomorrow morning, the attack begins.
- Avatar, we have to go now.
- Oh, whatever.
The cliffs of Scortch can be seen.
- We have to go now to complete our mission.
- Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- How?
- We have to swim in.
Oh. Okay.
What's happened to the world?
I don't know.
I can remember back...
All the fairies were so good...
We're here. Scortch.
Chrome!
Come. We'll walk right up the road... and no one will expect it.
- We'll act like slaves.
- Yeah.
The castle. I see it.
It's quite a distance.
I had one where the whole country would disappear for a day.
Ohh.
That was, uh...
That was really, uh...
I just don't know.
Over there.
That must be the entrance... to the lower cities.
Now, guards might be about. Come on.
Hmm. How ugly.
How ugly. Kapow!
Boom. Boom.
I just don't know.
Maybe... Maybe I should make a deal with them.
Chrome.
Which way? I don't know.
You know, I should have stayed with them.
- They love magic.
- Shh.
- Avatar, just stay quiet.
- Yeah. Oh.
Psst. Hey, General.
Want to buy an elf hat? Elf beard?
Souvenirs for sale.
Precious souvenirs for sale.
- Get them while they're still hot.
- No more wars, you fools... love.
Scortch can be beautiful too.
Look, look. Real, beautiful presents.
Now, that-that... that is a wonderful trick.
- Wonderful.
- It's Avatar. Oh, General.
It's him. It's bad.
It's come to hurt the führer.
Kill it.
Oh, master, kill it.
That's impossible.
That dirty old man is Avatar the Great?
If that is so... then I am a warthog's uncle!
Funny you should say that.
Kiyah!
Ki-Kiyah!
Oooowah!
The enemy is dead.
Oh, master, the enemy is dead.
My God! What have I done?
Master loves Larry.
Master feeds Larry.
What are elves good for?
Avatar, good luck!
The beast has shown us the way to the castle.
I'm sorry, Weehawk.
I'm just an old fool.
You know... the world owes you much, kid... even if we don't take another step.
God! Avatar, get down.
I've seen him.
You can't beat him. He's too strong.
Avatar, don't do it.
You may be right... but I gotta battle my brother.
You find an entrance into the castle.
Smash the projector, and tell Elinore... that Avatar will die with her tonight... even if we win.
Hello.
You have aged, old fool.
The world is mine.
- Weehawk!
- Slut!
Weehawk, don't!
Weehawk, don't! Don't! Don't!
Stop, elf!
Blood on blood flowing, fathers and sons dying... brothers and lovers spilling false hate and rivers of life flowing away.
Fool elf! Think your sword is always quick, but what else?
Think!
Weehawk, I could not help it.
When I touched Peace in the desert...
Blackwolf trapped my mind.
I'm not as strong as Peace. It hurts.
Avatar must know.
The trouble with you, my brother... is that you've always been too good.
Well, that may be.
But I still think I look more like Ma than you do.
You know, uh, lots of character.
I'm agin' better.
Brother, there is no need for me to destroy you.
Surrender.
Surrender your world.
You always did need an audience, you sap.
Let me tell ya...
I ain't practiced much magic for a long time.
I wanna show you a trick Mother showed me when you weren't around... to use on special occasions like this.
Ah. Oh, yeah, one more thing...
I'm glad you changed your last name, you son of a bitch.
Avatar!
Elinore's no traitor!
She was possessed by Blackwolf.
It is done! It is done!
The world is free!
The projector destroyed,
the battle was over.
Shadow creatures
froze in their tracks.
Some faded...
some crawled back to hell.
Mutants... leaderless... ran.
Elves swept the beaches clear of the few
remaining mutants that still fought...
- As hundreds of circling black birds...
screamed at the carnage below.
There was some rejoicing.
But mostly, everyone wished
to return home quickly...
to tell their loved ones
that the war was won...
Hitler was dead again...
and that they could live
once more in peace...
in the land they loved so much...
God-given. Amen.
God-given. Amen.
Avatar! Look what I caught!
Don't hurt Larry. Larry served.
Beast of a thousand scales...
Hey, hey, hey. Set it free.
It's harmless without Blackwolf.
Pity it. It's not its fault.
Mmm. So be it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, master.
We ride back to Montagar.
Weehawk, you ride back to Montagar alone.
Avatar and I will start a new kingdom somewhere.
You will rule Montagar as their new king.
Are you and Avatar married, my Queen?
Hey, kid, take it easy, huh?
You did a good job, but don't get carried away.
You think Avatar's too old to get married?
Weehawk, how many years do wizards live, 10,000 or more?
And I got at least a thousand left, you know what I mean?
Forgive me, Avatar.
Forgive me, both of you.
For Montagar, forever.
Well, come on. Let's make it.
Avatar,
You're getting older and much bolder.
Come on! I meant let's make it out of here.
Sure you did.
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Mama, Mama
My tiny, tiny Mama
Papa, Papa
My great big, great big Papa
Let's stand on our heads
Let's smile and laugh
Because the three of us
are together and it's fun!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Mama, Mama
My Mama with her flowers
Papa, Papa
My Papa with his pipe
Let's have a chat
with the tiny giggling ants
Because we get along
and have fun laughing together!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Hurry Grandma!
The train's coming!
Coming.
Here, this is your ticket to Nagasaki.
And this is your lunch.
Don't get mixed up, now.
I sure hope you'll be okay on your own, Mimiko.
Who, me?
I'll be fine.
Anyway, I've got school so there's no choice.
No.
I just can't go.
Grandpa's memorial service is important.
But I just can't leave you alone.
Oh, Grandma!
You're such a worry wart!
You have to get on!
Don't worry, I'll write a letter every day.
Okay?
There.
See you later!
Mimiko!
Make sure you write me every day!
Don't worry, I'll be fine!
See?
Hello, Mimiko.
Where's your Grandma?
She just left.
Um, I'd like some apples, onions and potatoes, please.
Sure.
That means you'll be all alone from tonight.
No problem!
I can do the cooking, cleaning and the wash!
What a good little girl.
Mimiko doesn't have a father or mother.
But she doesn't seem lonely!
Aren't you gonna get scared and cry, being alone at night?
I'll be just fine!
If I see a ghost, then...
Hi-yaah!
I'll beat him up and make him my servant!
You sure are full of energy, Mimi.
Here, this one s on the house.
Thank you!
What a good little girl.
In actual fact, it's she who takes care of Grandma.
Mimi, I hear you're on your own for a while.
That's no good.
What if a burglar gets in your house?
Oh, that'd be great!
I've never seen a burglar before!
You got me there!
Hey... that's weird.
It wasn't like this when I left.
Wonder if it's a burglar?!
Oh, boy.
Somebody was definitely here while I was out.
I'm sure this bucket was put away properly bef ore.
Oh, boy!!!
Wow, a cute stuffed panda!
Wow!
I'm positive you and I are gonna be friends!
Wow!
My very first visitor is a panda!
Go on in.
Wait here, and I'll get us some drinks!
Ups-a-daisy!
There you are.
What a cute way to drink!
Daddy!
Daddy!
I don't see anybody.
Oh, someone's here.
Hang on a second.
Come in!
Thank you, I will.
What a nice house.
The weather's nice too.
And the bamboo grove is especially nice.
I've come to see if my panda son is here.
I thought so!
So you're the panda's f ather!
Come in!
I've just made drinks!
Please don't trouble yourself.
I guess this seat really didn't like being sat upon.
I'm sure this seat will want you to sit on it!
Now this is a nice seat!
The kitchen is nice, too.
And the bamboo grove is especially nice!
Which reminds me...
I should say hello to your parents.
No need to do that.
Because I don't have a mom or dad!
What?!
You don't have a dad?!
That won't do!
But I'm just fine!
I can get along on my own!
No siree.
In order to raise children, there have to be parents.
Like you need a bamboo grove to grow bamboo shoots.
It'd probably be better to have them.
What a nice bamboo grove!
I know!
Why don't I become your father?
Pardon?!
It's hard for a father to become a mother!
But it's easy to become a father!
Nothing to it!
I'm already a dad.
So it'd be nothing for me to become a father!
I'd like even just one father!
Mr. Panda! Be my father!
And in turn, I'll be
Panny's mommy!
Okay?
Then the three of us will live here in this house!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Mommy! Mommy!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy!
That's nice of you.
Panny's always wanted a mom.
Daddy!
Yes?
Daddies wear a hat, you know!
And daddies read a newspaper in the room.
And they smoke a pipe.
Thank you...
You're very welcome!
And daddies...
Um, daddies...
Daddies give hugs, too...
Okay!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Yes, little girl.
That s weird, calling me
"little girl".
Call me "Mimiko".
Huh?
Mimiko.
Daddy.
Mommy.
What is it, Panny?
Mom's right here.
Isn't this nice.
It truly is.
And the bamboo grove is especially nice!
The bamboo grove...?
Oh, I see!
What a nice bamboo grove.
Yes, I'm coming.
Got one!
Mine, too!
Very nice!
Is it good?
This is so great!
It's the happiest day of my lif e!
Standing on your head when you're happy.
That's truly a fun thing to do.
"Dear Grandma. How are you?"
"I'm doing great."
"Because something really terrific happened."
"I got myself a daddy!"
"And I also got a baby."
"Right now Daddy's reading a picture book upside-down..."
"...while he eats some bamboo."
"Panny's fallen asleep."
"I'll have to get his bed ready."
"Well, I'd better get going."
"Being a mother is wonderful, and it keeps you so busy!"
"Take care."
"Bye, Grandma."
"Love from your Granddaughter,
Mimiko."
Panny!
Breakfast is almost ready, so don't go too far!
Get up, Daddy.
Hurry or you'll be late for work!
Work...?
Huh?
Eat up!
All right, then.
Ouch!
Here's your lunch, Dad.
And this is your lunch.
My lunch! My lunch!
Oh! Your hat, Dad!
Here!
Huh?
Language, math...
When you say "Dad has to go to work"...
...are you talking about me?
Sure!
Dads go to work every morning!
Daddy!
I wanna go to work, too!
Work! Work!
Dad's going to work...?
Work...?
That's right!
How could I have forgotten?!
Today's a day off!
I'm sure of it!
Yes, that's right!
It's always a day off!
So I don't have to go to work!
A day off!
Let's go! Let's go!
Let s go for a walk!
We can't!
I've gotta go to school.
No!
I wanna go to school, too!
Don't be like that, or
I'll spank your bottom.
I don't wanna be spanked.
Be a good boy.
See you later!
Bye! Have a good day!
Oh!
Panny, did you follow me?!
You can't come!
Get back home!
You've gotta be bigger to go to school.
You can't come!
Uh-oh!
School's about to start!
Oh, brother.
In that case...
Listen, Panny.
Act like a stuff ed animal.
I'll take you if you promise not to be naughty.
Okay.
I'm a stuff ed animal.
"And after a little while, another tiger appeared."
"The tiger said, I'll eat you up!"
"Language"
Mimi, your stuff ed panda sure is cute!
Yeah.
Let me hold it for a while.
No.
Stingy!
Just for a minute!
"I walk on four feet."
Please!
Mimiko!
Let me see!
No!
What did you bring a stuff ed animal for?!
I'm telling the teacher!
Ouch!
Mimiko!
Yes?
Stand up!
Mimiko, what are you hiding behind the book?
A stuff ed panda!
Isn't it cute?
What a well-made panda.
You shouldn't be bringing stuff ed animals to class!
Now, get rid of it!
But...
Put it in the shoe locker until school s out.
Understand?
Yes.
Okay, Panny.
Stay here and be quiet.
I'll come to get you as soon as school's out.
Okay, I'll be right here.
Don't be naughty!
I won't be naughty.
"Bread"
Oh, dear!
You didn't put it away properly!
Now all this bread has gone to waste!
Oh! What's a rice cake doing in here?
What?!!
A bear!
Class is over.
Huh?
Oh, no! That's Panny!
A bear! Catch it!
Mommy!
Mimi!
Did a bear come this way?!
Look, teacher!
I washed my panda off; isn't it nice and clean?!
No, not a panda! A bear!
A yellow bear!
Oh, it went that way.
"And of course, Grandma..."
"...when we got home,
I scrubbed him clean."
"Because he smelled like curry."
"He was a curry panda."
"Of course, I had to scold him."
"It sure is hard, having a small child."
"Take care now."
Where are you off to,
Mr. Policeman?
Hello.
I thought I'd go check in on Mimi.
Grandma isn't back yet, is she.
No, and I'm worried about
Mimi being on her own.
See you later.
Hello, Mimi.
Hello!
It's unlocked!
Hello!
We have a guest, so stay over there.
What was that?!
Dad and Panny.
"Dad"...?!
A pa... pa... pa... pa!
Yes?
Did you call for Papa?
Boy, what a rude policeman.
He was surprised that I have a dad!
Hurry and let's go f or a walk!
All right, let's go!
Ouch!
That's strange.
I'm sure there was a great big panda and a little one.
A panda and its child were here, right?!
Hello, Mr. Zookeeper.
It was definitely Papa panda and his family!
Hurry and catch them!
I've been so worried about them for the last few days...
. ever since they escaped from our zoo!
Yes, I've heard all about it in the paper and on TV.
But who would've thought they'd be in Mimi's house...!
I'm counting on you!
Wow! It's beautiful!
This air is delicious!
This pipe is delicious!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come and skip!
Oh, a skipping rope!
Come on!
Hey, pandas!
Must be the ones that escaped from the zoo!
I won't let you say bad things about my dad!
Even my dad's dumb!
That's the famous panda that escaped from the zoo!
Don't you have a TV at home?!
Whoever catches them will get a reward!
Daddy...
Hey, hurry and go tell the cops.
I ll guard them!
Daddy!
But I wanted to keep skipping.
No, stop!
Look out, Panny!
Panny!
Ow...
Neat-o!
I'm giving him back.
You're so strong, Panny!
Dad...?
What's a zoo?
It's a place we were in a long, long time ago.
But they didn't have a nice bamboo grove.
And you weren't there.
But when they come to take you back...
...they'll take Panny, too.
Oh, where did Panny get to?!
Panny!
Panny!
Panny!
Where are you?!
Panny!
Panny...!
Hello, Papa Panda.
Lovely day.
And I'm delighted to see you looking so well!
And I m delighted to see you so well, Mr. Zookeeper.
I'd like your cooperation in accompanying us...
...back to the zoo.
We have the car already.
Oh, my.
How kind of you.
Then you'll come back?!
No. Dad!
We've gotta look for Panny!
That's true.
You'll have to excuse me.
"Panny"...? The baby panda!
Oh, no!
Everyone look for the panda!
Panny!
Panny!
We've been looking and looking.
Where could he be?
Hey! He's over there!
Oh, no!
There's a floodgate ahead!
A what?!
We've gotta move!
Panny!
Daddy! Mommy!
Panny!
Mommy!
Hang on tight!
No use!
It's rusted and won't budge!
Panny!
Mommy!
No, don't!
Let me go!
You'll get killed, too!
Mimi! Hang on!
Daddy!
Coming!
Hurry, Dad!
I can't hold on!
It's all over!
Mimi...!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Oh! Isn't that nice!
"Dear Grandma.
How are you?"
"Dad and Panny have gone back to the zoo."
"PANDA GARDEN
ENTRANCE"
Good night.
See you tomorrow.
"Dad's very happy going to work."
"After all, Dads are supposed to go to work."
"Dad buys me presents with the money he makes."
"Anyway, I'm very happy, so don't worry."
Dad!
Welcome back!

"Dear Grandma.
How are you?"
"Dad, Panny and I are all doing very well!"
"That's because we met some terrific people!"
"Who do you think it was, Grandma?"
It's inside this house!
Seems like nobody's home.
No matter!
Let's hurry and take it back!
Mr. Tiger! Here, kitty kitty!
IS ANYBOD Y HOME?!!
You'll make the tiger run away!
Mr. Tiger! Here, kitty kitty!
Think it's okay, letting ourselves in?
I don't like the feel of this.
Mr. Tiger! Mr. Tiger!
Are you in there?
Nobody's here.
I'm sure he's here!
Let's look!
Ouch!
Boss!
Find him?
Take a look at this!
What're you doing?!
Get looking for him!
It's just that I've never seen one this small.
And there's a mid-sized one.
Huh?
And this big one!
Boss...
What now?
What kind of person would use this monstrous tooth brush?
Start looking, or I ll really get mad!
Now where could that tiger have gotten to?
Th-That seat...!
That seat!
What kind of person would have that monstrous seat?!
And that monstrous spoon!
That monstrous plate!
And what kind of thing would eat salad like this?!
Boss there's no doubt about it!
There's some kind of great big thing living here!
Something like a man-eating bear!
Maybe it even ate the tiger!
Huh?!
A... A footprint!
Even a man-eating bear's footprints aren't this big!
What is it?!
I don't see anything.
It was... it was.
This big!
Strange, I could've sworn
I saw it.
What?
T-tiny and r-round!
I don't see anybody.
Huh?
Over there!!
Welcome!
You guys are burglars, right?
This is great!
It's the first time I've ever seen a burglar!
Wow! Wow!
Burglars! Burglars!
How do you do?
I'm Papa Panda!
Too bad.
Just when I finally got to see real burglars...!
They must be very busy.
Mommy! Dinner!
Dinner!
Yes, I guess it's that time.
Let's eat!
Let's eat!
Let's eat!
Somebody ate it!
Somebody ate my curry!
Yeah, you're right.
I wonder if those burglars ate it?
I'll get you some more.
I'm sure those burglars must've been very hungry.
Just like me.
Someone used my towel and got it all dirty.
Someone broke my trumpet!
Somebody's sleeping in my bed.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Hey!
It's a tiger!
A baby tiger!
Oh...
This is my daddy.
This is my mommy.
Mine too! Mine too!
Great!
After the burglars, a tiger came to our house!
I'm Tiny!
I'm Panny!
Wow! Wow! Tiny! Tiny!
Wow! Wow! Panny! Panny!
This is good.
What a nice visitor!
Come on, let s all have dinner together!
More, please!
Wow!
Ready... settee... here we... come!
We can't get out!
They're sleeping side-by-side.
Oh.
Hey, Dad?
I wonder where that tiger came from?
Wonder if he has a mom?
I'll ask around in town, tomorrow.
Daddy!
Hi!
Dad! I'm going to run some errands.
I wanna go, too!
Hang on a minute.
I'm just going to stick this in the mailbox.
Stay off the tracks!
I will.
Me too!
Mommy!
Huh...?
Wonder where they went?
Panny!
Tiny!
Strange.
I wonder if they went on ahead?
Mimi!
Did you know the circus was in town?
The circus?
Yeah!
It came in last night, on the train!
Yeah, and there are lions and all kinds of animals!
Hey, you wanna go?
Is there a tiger in that circus?
I dunno.
Probably!
Come on, let's go!
Then maybe Tiny belongs to the circus...
Which means...
Well? Are you going, or what?
Sure, I'll go!
Oh, what a fix!
Where on earth could that tiger have gotten to?
We've turned the place upside-down.
And I had my fill of that house last night.
Gee, a circus!
Huh...?
A panda!
After it!
It's that panda!
Stop!!
Oh, no!
The panda's gonna get eaten by the tiger!
No way.
You children are naughty!
Come on, just a quick look!
Come on, just a little!
No, I said.
We're setting up.
Come back tomorrow and see.
And bring ticket money!
Not fair!
Mister!
Have you seen my panda
Panny?!
Panda?
Yeah! The panda and tiger are lost!
Tiny!
Help!
A panda's gone into the tiger's cage!
A panda has...?!
Hey, stop!
Get back here!
Come on...
That's a good girl, let go of that panda.
Come on...
Come on, pandas don't taste any good!
Please, let him out.
Please!
No, stop! Stop!
She's in danger!
Mommy!
Mommy!
This is my mommy!
This is my mommy!
Hello, you must be Tiny's mom.
I'm Mimiko, Panny's mom.
Great!
I'm so excited!
Hooray!
The tiger came back!
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray!
How nice!
The burglars, and Tiny, and the circus folk were all nice.
Look! The boss gave us some tickets, to thank us.
Let's all go tomorrow.
Wow! Wow! A circus! A circus!
Tiny's gonna be in the show with his mom.
It's going to be very nice weather tomorrow.
Oh...
Huh...?
Hey, is it raining?
Hurry, Dad!
Right.
I don't like the rain
I don't like the rain.
I wonder if Tiny and the others are getting wet.
They'll be okay.
Rain is important; it makes living things stronger.
And it's especially good f or bamboo.
I don't like when it rains.
The circus will be cancelled.
Don't worry I'm sure it'll be nice out tomorrow.
Hey, let's have a snack.
A snack?
Here!
It's Tiny!
It's Tiny! It's Tiny!
"Dear Grandma."
"The storm still hasn't passed."
"The rain just pours down."
"Panny is very disappointed."
"I'm sure there's going to be a big flood."
"I wonder how Tiny and the others are."
"I'm very worried about them."
Mommy, I'm scared.
I'm right here.
Don't be afraid, go to sleep.
Is Tiny okay?
Sure!
Tiny's mom is very strong, after all.
I'm gonna give Tiny my cookie!
Wow, I'm sure he'll be surprised!
Now close your eyes.
Gee whiz!
Dad! Hurry and wake up!
Oh!
Dad, look!
Some fish!
Isn't this nice!
A nice flood.
And the bamboo is especially nice!
Dad!
Time for lunch!
Coming!
Here, help yourself.
Thank you.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Yes?
Since you're down there, get some jam from the kitchen.
Sure.
Tiny! Tiny!
The circus ball.
So the circus must be flooded, too.
Wha't could this be?
Tiny! Tiny!
Read it! Read it!
These are Tiny's footprints, but...
It says, "Help, help!"
Signed, Tiny.
So they're having trouble with all the water!
Dad! Let's save them!
Take this, Dad!
Here.
Got it.
And we're off!
Isn't it nice, Dad?!
Look, the town looks like an island!
Oh, it's Mimi!
Boss, where are Tiny and the others?
The animals were washed away by the water.
Oh, that's terrible!
So you guys took off without them?!
Well, uh...
We tried to get them onto the train.
But the water came suddenly...
...and only the people escaped.
Gee!
Hey, Mimi!
Hurry, Dad!
Poor Tiny and the others!
Over there!
Tiny! Tiny!
You're safe, now!
We re going to get you out!
We have food!
Just wait a bit longer!
Here!
My cookie! My cookie!
It s going to get a little noisy.
Come on out.
There you are.
This is fun!
Nice, Dad!
My turn, next!
There.
Here's some cabbage.
Carrots for Mr. Giraffe.
Ham!
Cookies for the horses!
I'm so excited!
Look, there's no water.
Huh?
We've gotta stop it, Dad!
This is incredible!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Even more incredible!
Boss, did you hear a train?
Huh? Impossible.
See? I told you.
Don't be stupid.
Huh?
There it is!!
Dad, isn't this nice?!
Huh?
Hurry! Hurry!
Stop! Please stop!
Hi-ya!
Hurry! Get a move on!
Snap, snap! Get going!
Mimi!
The brakes! The brakes!
I can't! I dunno which one's the brake!
We're gonna crash!
We're gonna crash!
Daddy, make us stop!
Please, Dad!
Dad!!
Who's there?
Oh, Mr. Mayor.
Sorry about the racket.
You're the greatest, Dad!
"And so, Grandma..."
". The people in town and from the circus were very happy."
"And we're even happier than before, so don't worry."
"Well, I'd better go."
"Good-bye, Grandma."
"Your Granddaughter, Mimiko."
Let's have a chat
with the tiny giggling ants
Because we get along
and have fun laughing together!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!

Hey, yeah. The 1960's?
Happy times, heavy times.
All right, so you get your daughter, right?
She might be Catholic,
Jewish, anything.
So you bring her up in what they call... the bourgeois,
American-type-society family.
Bring them up so they don't screw until they get married.
You take them to church on Sunday.
Teach them all you can about bringing up a family... how you should look and act... then you send them to college.
You bust your hump.
No government subsidy.
Nobody's paying nothing.
You save your money, or you borrow the money... you work overtime, you send her to college.
You want her to get an education.
The first Easter she comes home on a vacation... she says, "Hey, Dad,
I'm living with some guy."
"You're living with some guy?
What do you mean?"
"This is the thing now.
Free love."
We're getting away from the original point.
What we're trying to find is, why are these bastards rioting?
Because they did dope.
Listen, you're going in the wrong direction.
What of it?
What happens is, look,
I'm sending you to school...
I'm breaking my ass to send you to college, right?
I expect you're going to learn something.
Why be a janitor?
Learn something.
To justify my investment in you.
But some of these people revel in the fact... that their kids are leaders, are rabble-rousers.
This son of a bitch just started a riot.
These kids think they're the first generation... that ever screwed before they got married.
We all did, but we always had one girl.
She screwed... that girl you took out.
It's better off these kids don't get married... because they haven't got the guts to stick with it.
Hey, you fucking intellectuals
You think you're so where it's at
Before you fill your minds with any junk
Better listen to Fritz the Cat
'Cause writers and poets and artists
It's your duty to live life to the most
So fly out, brothers, and check out the world
Give me a ride to the coast
Fritz the Cat
He fought many a good man
Laid many a good woman
Live life to the fullest
Cry out for more until it bleeds
Help me, help me help you, mother...
Love me,
I hate you, love me
I kill you, love me
I love you
What a mob in the park today.
God, the place is crawling with phonies.
Yeah, high school punks.
Those creeps are always here on weekends, man.
Most of them are total jackoffs.
So many people here and nobody here.
-Dig that chick, man!
-Over there?
Man, look at that ass on her!
-What a baby carriage.
-So what, man?
If you hadn't showed up so late, we'd be all right now.
Fritz always does it, man.
Everybody's here with their guitars already.
Sixteen versions of "Lemon Tree."
I just want someplace where I can sleep.
I mean, I can cook.
I can sew and do housework and things like that.
Get out the guitars.
Come on, get them out.
And one, two, three.
Once I had a little girl
Who was in love with me
Well, well, baby,
I know, I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, mama, mama, singing it, ho
Dumb chicks.
-Easily impressed by spades.
-lt's the thing, man.
Look, I'm gonna split.
I'll see you guys later.
Yeah, hang loose, Fritz.
I've read everything
James Baldwin's written.
He has a true sense of the problems of black people.
I worked for Head Start for free last summer.
Black kids are so much groovier.
I went to a couple of
Black Panther meetings.
The time for non-violent revolution is past.
More power to the people!
I'm taking a course in African studies at school.
I had no idea you people were so civilized.
Do you know that property values... actually go up when a black family moves in?
Freud didn't write for the black man.
Why does a great actor like James Earl Jones... always have to play black men?
Don't you hate it when people say "Colored" or "Negro"... and not "Black"?
Black is beautiful.
It's so great that black people wear their hair natural... not emulating the image of beauty... white people inflict upon them.
I had a black girlfriend once who said that Jewish people... were the closest to black people.
I'm Jewish, you know.
I ain't no jive-ass black nigger, honey.
Who do you think I am?
Geraldine?
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus!
How awful.
My soul is tormented.
-Gee.
-Oh, no.
I've been up and down the four corners of this big old world.
I've seen it all!
I've done it all!
-Gee.
-Wow.
I've fought many a good man, laid many a good woman.
I've had riches and fame and adventure.
Stood face to face with danger and death countless times.
Are you somebody famous?
I think I saw you in a movie once.
Try not to interrupt, huh?
I've tasted life to the fullest... and still my soul cries out... in this hungry, tortured, wrecked quest, "More!"
-Look at the good side of life.
-Things aren't all bad.
Gee, he's handsome.
You. You can help me.
You must save me.
By so doing, you, too, will be saved.
I'd like to, but what can I do?
Lovely set of eyes there.
Little sweet one with your heart of gold...
I know of a place where we can be alone... to join our souls in sacred truth.
I want to be in on this thing.
What about my soul, you fink?
Four in bed...that's a kick
I haven't tried yet.
What?
Yes. Together we shall all learn... the real existential essence of the life force.
"Existential."
I heard that word once.
-What's it mean?
-"Cool," stupid.
You are a true genius, Fritz.
Wild, this is wild.
Oh, honey, I could go...
I'll get it. God damn it.
What's happening, man?
Fritz the Cat has become the stud of the year.
We're having a session here now, so I don't know.
Anybody using that room?
That's the john,
I mean... if you're really strung out, man.
We'll take it.
This way, group.
Come along, now, step lively.
Watch your step.
That's a girl.
Rub-a-dub-a-dub.
OK.
A new world of experience awaits us, my loves.
This bathtub is now transformed... into a space capsule of truth and love.
Wow! This is wild!
Only in naked closeness can we all know each other.
Yes! Right!
Very good, Winston, darling.
"Naked closeness," true.
You are a perceptive girl.
Closeness, we must all get very close... as close as possible, as a matter of fact.
That's right.
Let's all get close together.
Oh, boy.
Closeness and fulfillment of our hidden desires... through which we reach the truth.
Fulfillment is important.
Don't you think so, Winston?
Ooh, yes.
Very important.
Now I'm getting to the truth,
I think, yes.
It's all very clear now.
OK, Winston.
Here come the truth.
You got the word.
Oh, Fritzy.
You got such an existential little body.
Jeez. Wow.
Oh, shit!
Maybe we better go, huh?
No! Not at all!
You get down over here.
And you down like that.
Right under here.
Watch the foot.
Right under here.
Ready, everyone.
Here we go.
Hey, Ralph,
I think this is the place... we got the report on with these kids upstairs... doing the shit and smoking,
I think.
Tell me what to do.
I never went in before.
Because you're a rookie and this is your first beat... you just follow me.
We walk up the steps.
We don't make any noise.
You follow me slowly, got that?
I do. Like Dick Tracy.
No, it's like
Terry and the Pirates.
Dick Tracy's old hat.
Now, let's go inside.
Wait. Could I get to search the girls?
Yeah.
I've done enough of that.
Here we go.
And watch me,
'cause I'm a natural in action.
Up the steps.
Hey, man.
What the hell's going on in here?
For Christ's sake, what do you want?
For Christ's sake...
Fritz is having his own private little orgy.
Move over, man.
Will you get out of here?
We're seeking the truth!
It's my bathtub, man.
Don't pay attention to that Fritz.
He got a Jesus complex.
Oh, I know it.
Have some joy puff, sweet little bird.
Hello, New York.
Heard you're having a hash session here.
Wow, this is where it's at.
Yes, man, come join us.
Good stuff and lots of it, man.
Only close the door.
We're modest.
Har har har.
The guy's a riot.
Oh, God, I'm there.
You really there?
How is it?
-lt's...
-How is it?
That's funny.
I'm not there anymore.
Oh, shit.
I'm a writer.
Let's talk about it.
Ever made it with an aardvark before?
It's a rare opportunity.
We're scarce.
Really?
I can't tell if I'm there or not.
How do you tell?
You'll know when you are.
Oh, balls. lt doesn't work for me.
I'm a failure as a pot smoker.
Don't be sad.
Someday you'll make it.
Really.
Shh. I think we're here.
Do you hear anything, Ralph?
It sounds like a bunch of degenerates in there.
Now, listen, Ralph, you got the deeper voice.
And I want you to yell,
"Open the fucking door."
Say the word "Fucking" because that makes you sound tough.
When I say three, you yell, "Open..."
I'm even gonna ad-lib.
No ad-libbing, Ralph.
Let me call them pre-verts.
What's a pre-vert?
A pre-vert is a degenerate, didn't you know that?
A pre-vert's a degenerate?
Didn't you have no bringing up?
I got bar-mitzvahed.
You ain't supposed to laugh, Ralph!
This is a serious job and we're getting paid for it.
Cut the fucking shit out.
Let's go.
All right.
Open up in there!
It's the law! Hippie bastards!
Good, Ralph, do it again.
What the fuck's your problem?
Cut it out!
I won't laugh!
Open the door, you pre-verts!
Open up!
Law and order's here!
-Open up!
-All right in there!
Open up! Here we are!
Wow! I can do it!
Oh, baby, do I feel high!
I'm flying!
What a wonderful, wiggly world!
We're outside, but we'll get in!
-Law and order's here!
-Open up!
All right in there!
Your fucking bath party's over!
-Over here!
-The cops!
Right in the mouth!
Yeah! I love it!
Take that!
Hey, you!
Get your hands out of my thing!
-Here we are!
-Where the fuck are you?
Over there! ln the head!
Get your hands off of my dick!
In the head!
I love it! I love it!
Ralph, where are you?
Ralph, help! Gotcha!
Now I gotcha!
Here, take that!
That's my...
Gotcha! ln the heart!
In the head!
Over there!
Watch that thing!
Where's the cat?
Wow.
Hey, look at this big fucking gun.
I killed the john!
Kill! Destroy!
Can you give him your glasses?
Because I can't.
I have to look.
-You can't see?
-l'll give them back.
A little bit...
Oh, boy, this is good for me.
Can you dig it in your eyes?
You're younger than me.
Forty-five, forty-eight.
I'm sixty-seven.
I wish I knew.
I would give you glasses.
I'd take another pair from the house.
I didn't think
I would need the glasses.
I'm not so young no more, remember.
You don't see nothing?
I'm older than you are,
I'll see.
I'll mention that I see.
You're doing fine.
You're doing fine.
You know something?
That you don't have to look at the book, right?
So say it. Say it.
All right.
All right. Good.
-Good.
-Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.
Just normal.
You know, nice and quiet.
Now, wait a minute.
Don't rush.
Mother of God,
I'm a fucking fugitive.
This is the place!
I saw him come in here!
Oh, my God, it's a synagogue.
What kind of a place is this?
A church?
Listen, I can hear them.
Don't sound like English.
Are they Puerto Ricans?
Ralph, you're trying my patience.
You go down that aisle,
I'll go down this aisle.
It's about time you said something bright.
Ralph, please be quiet.
It's my people.
-Excuse me, Rabbi.
-They all got long hair.
-Sorry, Rabbi.
-They all got long clothes.
-Excuse me.
-Must be a hippie church.
Hi, Rabbi.
Did you see him?
God.
Ralph, would you please shut up?
I ain't talking loud.
Excuse me, Rabbi.
Hi, Ma.
Excuse me, Rabbi.
Uncle Ben, how are you?
I'm catching a criminal.
Excuse me, Rabb...
It's you.
Did you find him?
No, he was over there, but...
-But I was just telling you...
-Cut it out!
But I was just...
I ain't talking loud!
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
You saved my life!
We interrupt the lsraeli-Arab war... for this special announcement.
The president, after conferring... with the lsraeli prime minister Golda Meir... has agreed to send more arms and equipment to lsrael... based on the return of
New York City and Los Angeles... to the United States.
Mazel tov! Mazel tov!
Stop, you motherfucking cat!
Stop in the name of the law!
Stop!
Stupid, Ralph, you're not supposed to dance.
But I didn't want to break the circle!
-You're not supposed to dance.
-l got musical feet.
You dumb rookie.
Dumb rookie!
You dumb rookie!
Dumb rookie!
You're not supposed to dance, Ralph...
'cause you're not Jewish!
I had a great thing going till the frigging fuzz showed up.
I wish that skinny broad didn't turn on the shower, too.
I think I'm getting a cold.
Hello, men. Everybody studying for their goddamn exams?
Hey, Buzz, how'd it go with that Dee-Dee chick?
She's got some bod, you have to admit.
Charlene isn't bad, either, though, right?
Like wow!
Hines!
You swine, old buddy pig!
You groove behind Alvina, get some kicks tonight?
Bastards.
You'd think the goddamn exams... was the be-all and end-all of existence... cosmic life force or something.
You'd think they were the frigging fugitives.
Can't even get in a few decent words to a guy.
Bastards.
What a bore, they just sit there... and take bennies and stay up all night... with their face stuck in a bunch of books... and their thumb up their ass.
Yes, yes,
I remember the time... when it was all very inspiring and enlightening... all this history and literature and sociology shit.
You think learning is a really big thing... and you become this big fucking intellectual... and sit around trying to out-intellectual... all the other big fucking intellectuals.
You spend years and years... with your nose buried in these goddamn tomes... while the world is passing you by.
All the stuff to see... and all the kicks... and all the girls are out there.
And me, a writer!
And a poet who should be having adventures... and experiencing all the diversities... and paradoxes and ironies of life... and passing over all the roads of the world!
And digging all the cities and towns and rivers... and the oceans and... making all of them chicks.
Oh, God.
As a writer and a poet... it is my duty to get out there and dig the world... to swim in the whole frigging scene... while there is still time, man.
My farting around days are over, baby.
From this day on, I shall live every day as if it was my last.
I must do it!
No more of the dreary, boring classes... dismal lectures, sitting around bullshitting.. with pretentious fat-ass hippies.
No more of the books... the spoutings of a bunch of old farts... who think they know the whole goddamn score.
Oh, my God, what have I done?
I set all my notes and books on fire... and now I can't study for my exams.
I'll flunk out, and my folks will be pissed off.
I'll get a blanket.
The blanket's on fire.
We better call the fire department.
Bo Diddley buy his baby a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He gonna take it to a private eye
If that private eye can't see
He better not take that ring from me
Bo Diddley caught him a nanny goat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday coat
Bo Diddley caught him a bear cat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday hat
Maybe someday
You will fall in love
As I fell in love with you
Baby
The one you love
Just keep falling in love with you
Then when
You all alone
You know it'd be best, baby
You can sing like that.
Little coquette, I love you
Sing, 'cause I want to... if I get tired, I quit.
But you don't want to sing.
I want to sing, man.
I'm good.
You sing as good as you want.
If I get tired, I quit.
I went to school in Oakland... and I had quite a few white-type of school kids with me.
I'm forty-nine.
At that time, I had white kids going to school with me.
I would have peanut butter.
I don't want it... but I ate so much when my mother gave it to me.
With apple butter.
I got two cans of it now.
That I don't eat because... whitey was eating ham sandwiches... and I was eating peanut butter sandwiches.
Sandwiches!
I got to get out of this town for some Southern times.
Let me out of here.
That's right.
Suck! The bus only cost
$17 to New York.
I say, "l ain't made
$17 in two weeks."
Got air to live.
Riding a ship coming out of Pearl Harbor.
And all my white friends... then we drank water out of the ditches.
If I had a K-ration,
I gave them some of it.
And...
I would ride this bus.
I couldn't sit with my friend on this bus at Houston, Texas.
I had to ride at the back end of this bus.
I'm about to get hot now.
As a matter of fact... you couldn't even go no place down South riding a bus.
Couldn't even get a soda... walk in there and get you a sandwich.
I don't give a damn about who's racist.
I just want equality.
Be equal with the next guy, because I'm paying my taxes.
That's a different thing now.
I'm a working man, and I'm paying my taxes.
The money is what's happening.
See what I mean?
It all counts... when is what's happening.
I'm talking about...
If you want to be revolutionary... you get some bread first, and then you can talk trash.
Whitey blind us with religion.
If you fight violence with violence... like the late Malcolm did, you'll get some results.
Right.
Because before this rioting and shit... you didn't have no Head Start programs for kids.
You didn't have shit!
Really.
You didn't have a goddamn thing.
Got you down in Harlem selling horsemeat.
You know, if one of them motherfuckers... down and out selling horsemeat, they dead.
Another civil war.
Civil war.
And I'm gonna be standing back...
"Get 'em, baby!"
Hey, man, you in a bag?
Yeah, that's it.
I'm in a bag.
Just don't lose your coolness, cat...
I mean, don't lose your coolness.
Easy for you to talk.
You're a crow.
I wish I was a crow.
If I was a crow,
I'd fly away, man.
I'd fly away from this miserable town for good.
You think being a crow is a big motherfucking ball?
All you cats the same, man.
You don't know where it is.
There's nobody to tell you where it's at.
And you come up here, try to find out where it's at... but you got to be up here, man, to find out what's happening.
I know it isn't a ball, man.
I studied the race problems.
I know.
You don't know nothing about the race problem.
Got to be a crow to know about the race problem.
You know what I mean?
Do you dig where I'm at?
You know what I'm talking about?
Man, this thing affects me very deeply, fella.
As a cat, I have a considerable guilt complex... because my kind have always brought suffering on your kind.
Yes, indeed, my soul is tortured and tormented... by this racial crisis.
No shit?
I kid you not, man.
Sometimes I really get hung up about it.
You know, uptight.
-Strung out.
-ln a bag?
Yeah, in a bag!
I'm gonna buy you a drink, cat.
Just 'cause I think you got coolness.
Great.
Hey, boy, can I have a drink?
Oh, man!
Hey, Duke!
Hey, Duke!
They's blowing pot like mad up in Mildred's pad!
I'm on my way, man.
Hey, cat, how would you like to bug out now?
By God, man!
I'm gonna bug out!
Did he say bug out, baby?
Go ahead, baby, bug out.
Ain't no bug out.
-What kind of shit is that?
-lt's a bug out to him.
-lt's some kind of dance.
-Let's split.
Anybody looking our way?
Some stud gone and left his keys.
What are you doing?
You stealing that car?
Shove over, Jack!
Let me drive this goddamn thing.
Move it out!
Hey, man, you cats can't drive.
You don't know nothing about nothing.
Can't you see that car go by?
Cool it, will you?
I drive like a crow.
-Man, look, slow down!
-l see the light.
Man, you'll get killed up here!
Bullshit, Ralph!
Would you please shut up?
It's bad enough we got transferred up here... without you bullshitting all night.
Now, I gotta cover my beat... and I'll meet you back here in an hour.
One hour, Ralph.
And, Ralph... please, be careful.
Yeah, but Harlem?
Come on, slow the car down!
Look out, man!
I ain't ready to die yet!
Harlem?
I know what I'm doing.
The only faces... you can see in a crowd up here is ours.
The way they look, all you can see is their eyes.
I don't like it here.
I see the fucking fuzz.
Cool it, just cool it.
Right through the head
I'm gonna get you!
Throw that pig out!
Look out!
Cool it, man, will you?
I know what I'm doing.
Like hell you do.
Duke, you saved my life, man!
Shit!
Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance
And love
Then gay youth was mine
And truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Them-sooth was mine
Sad am l
Glad am l
For today
I'm dreaming of
Yesterdays
That you, Sonny?
It's me, baby.
-How's the crowd tonight?
-Not bad.
We're pushing enough grass to make our money.
Just enough.
But it sure ain't like the good old days in Harlem... when white money was boss... and them fine, white cats came up to Harlem... spreading it all around
Big Bertha.
Oh, child.
That was before all those peace marches... sit-ins, riots, and 'dos.
Ain't nothing wrong with no peace marches.
It's me, baby.
Who's that joker?
Friend of mine.
Cat, you ever been high on pot?
Are you kidding me, man?
Grass?
Who doesn't, you know?
What do you think,
I'm some kind of a hick?
Let's get that cat going on pot!
Take one.
That's what
I'm talking about, baby.
Nothing wrong, take two.
Come on, be a club member.
That's it!
Take three! Take four!
Five, six, seven!
That's it, baby!
He ain't losing now, no, indeed.
Joint, Hilly! A joint!
Stay loose!
Fritz, come on, now, stop!
Yo, Fritz!
Fritz, come on, now, stop it!
No, don't stop! Oh, yeah!
Oh, no, Fritz! Come on!
Hey, toro!
Hully gully cat!
Climb, sugar!
Right there! No, Fritz!
Come on, Fritz!
Aw, man, yeah!
Will you look at that?
You ain't black enough, hon.
That old black magic got me!
Oh, Fritz! That's right!
Right there, honey!
Wow, wow, wow!
Pump that thing!
Suddenly it's all very clear!
I must tell the people about the revolution!
Revolt! Revolt!
Damn you! What the hell you jabbering about now?
Revolt!
Revolt! Revolt!
Revolt, you thick-skulled idiots!
You have carried heavy burdens for the bosses!
You have sweat your lives away for the bosses!
The bosses!
They ride around in limousines!
Get the fuck off my car!
Bosses...they're eating strawberries and cream !
That's funny!
Cats are real boss!
All right, what's going on here?
Break it up!
Cool it, officer.
He's just blowing hot air.
No one's paying no mind.
Come the revolution, there'll be no more limousines!
Come the revolution, no more strawberries and cream !
Hey, Ralph, you know how these dumb kids are.
They don't know what they doing.
Fucking "A" right.
There he is!
He's the one who keeps the bosses in power!
He's the one who's holding you down!
-Who, me?
-You!
-Not me. You.
-No, you!
-Me?!
-Not me!
You!
-Fuck you!
-You first!
The spiked Buddha Capitalism !
The iron thumb on the heads of the proletariat!
They're gonna kill us.
Would you like to see a picture of my kids?
Come on, man!
You'll get killed up here!
Get them, get them !
Kill them !
We shall overcome!
Group Commander to Formation B.
Don't give them a chance to scatter.
Attack all congested areas.
I've got to find him.
Where could he be?
This is the alley behind that place he was standing at.
It gives me the creeps.
Good evening, madam.
Oh, Fritz!
Thank God I found you.
Join me, Winston, my love.
It's not very pretty looking, but it's cozy as a bitch.
Fritz, come out of there, will you please?
The hell! With the fuzz combing the city for me?
Has my picture appeared on TV yet?
Have they broadcast an alarm?
Offered a reward for information leading to my arrest?
Don't be so melodramatic.
You and your illusions of grandeur.
I'm not getting in that filthy, grimy garbage can with you.
Go fuck yourself.
You're such a child.
Such a self-centered, egotistical child.
This is disgusting.
If you're gonna talk about my garbage can that way... just get the hell out.
Fritz, are you still going to bug out or not?
Are you kidding, toots?
I got no choice at this point.
Listen to me, will you?
I've got a car and some money.
I can get all the things we need... and we can leave right away.
We can go out to the coast.
I'll get a good job as a private secretary... and you can work on your poetry and all.
We can get married and rent a nice little pad in Frisco... and dig the scene out there.
It's supposed to be a great town.
Frisco. Yeah, OK.
She makes men into boys
She makes giants into men
She'll have you feeling guilty
Before you can count to ten
Poor Winston
Sharp mind and a body to match
Poor Winston
Fine fancy karma, able, too, at that
Who is the girl in the fiberglass shorts?
Well, it's got to be
Winston Schwartz
You can't outtalk her
'Cause she talks too fast
You can't outthink her, she's a New York flash
She makes love to you and tell you you're in love
You make love to her
She says you don't know how to do it
Poor Winston at last we're zooming down that old lonesome highway.
It's wild.
Yeah. Marvelous.
Marvelous, my ass!
It's exalting. Elating.
The cool night wind blowing past the window. Man!
I'm hungry.
Let's stop someplace.
The hell with stopping.
I just want to feel those miles flying by.
I'm hungry!
Let's dig one of those little greasy truck stops.
I'd like to talk with those truck drivers, you know?
Hear what they got to say about life on the road.
I bet they got wild stories of the road.
Drivers, trucks, hijackers!
Fights! Let's do it.
Here's a good place.
I'll have your deluxe steak with salad and coffee. Black.
All right.
What would you like, sir?
That was really a fine steak.
You can always depend upon Howard Johnson's.
Let's get back on the road.
Goddamn.
Fritz! Wake up!
Huh? What?
The car is broken down... and I can't get the damned thing...
What? Where are we?
Fuck a duck.
We're out in the middle of the frigging desert.
Jesus, it's great!
Exactly. You've been sound asleep for two days.
-What?
-Two days.
You must've been dragged out after your big binge.
Shit. I guess I was.
All that drinking and blowing pot and screwing, man.
Man, I get horny just thinking about it.
Like, wow!
Start thinking about fixing this car, Fritz... or we'll be sitting here forever.
Look, is something bugging you, pal?
The car won't go!
Well, let's have a look.
I knew that all the time.
The engine's not up here.
It's in the back.
Let's just check it out.
What's wrong?
Let me see, I'll just...
If I move that...no...
What's wrong, Fritz?
It's all very complicated,
Winston.
I couldn't begin to explain it.
I think the piston rod's stuck in the drive shaft.
Either that, or the carburetor is rusted out.
Oh, good God.
Here comes a pickup truck.
Maybe he'll give us a push to the next gas station.
What's the trouble, buddy?
Our car is busted down.
Could you give us a push to the next gas station?
Let me look at it.
One thing I'm good at is fixing things.
Shut up!
Please shut up, chickens!
Shut up!
Please shut up!
I mean, shut up!
One thing I'm good at... is fixing things.
Dumb chickens.
Let me see now.
Ain't nothing the matter with this car here.
Buddy, ain't you got any sense at all?
You just let your car run out of gas.
I swear, these motherfucking hippies from New York.
There's a gas station a couple of miles back.
I'm going this way.
You ought to stop for gas once in a while, you stupid...
Gotta keep your engine fed.
Wise up, buddy.
Well, how do you like that?
New York hippies come down here... and they think they can...
I never, honest and true.
You think a thing like that happens...
Son of a bitch.
You're so clever.
So clever.
Big mechanical genius.
Here's a bucket, smart guy.
Good luck.
Hey, this is for shit!
You made a big bourgeois deal out of everything... and ruined it completely.
I was gonna bug out and be free from all this bullshit... and roam around and dig everything... and really have a good time.
Your naivete is astounding.
You'd be completely lost without me, Fritz... and you know it.
You're a motherfucking bitch.
I see the hard facts of life.
I am realistic, something you're incapable of.
You'd be better off with one of those stupid morons... like Charlene, who you could sleep with and throw away.
You can't cope with a mature woman.
You haven't the faintest idea how lucky you are... that an intelligent woman... loves you and wants to give you something of value... something that will inflame your creative potential!
Now, get going and hurry up!
We'll see who gets lost without whom.
Fritz the Cat
Fritz the Cat
Fritz the Cat
I'm the envy of each and every guy in town
She looks so sharp, and the girl does, too
And everybody knows what I'm gonna do
Gonna take a ride on my bike
Gonna take it and drive all night
Tell my Chevy to take a hike
Take another ride on my bike
Blue, I'm crazy about you.
Penniless. A regular bum.
A hobo with no money and no place to go.
Hey, you old scroungy old alley cat.
Get out of them garbage cans.
You talking to me, Jack?
What the hell you doing there, anyway?
Man, here we are on the brink of the apocalypse... the eve of destruction, so to speak... and I can't think of anything to do.
Offhand, son,
I'd say you have got a problem.
But at least you're honest.
The revolution can use a man like you.
Hop on.
-Hello there.
-Hi.
-How are you?
-High.
I'll introduce you to the guys at the cell meeting.
Blue!
Glad you could make it, man.
Howdy, John. I brought along an old buddy of mine.
He's a bright lad but bored with life.
Fritz... this here is John... former biker and small-time hood... turned fighter for the cause.
That cat was a beautiful head.
Glad to meet you, man.
Another castout for the bourgeois view.
From the mold of bankrupt sedentary.
What's the state of his political consciousness?
Practically nil, I'm afraid.
Our shipment came in today.
Thirty-two survivors.
Go around.
Hey, chief.
Getting ready for a little action planned for tonight.
We're gonna paralyze the whole fucking city.
It's going to be great, man.
The shit is really gonna come down tonight.
We've got everything we need... for three synchronized sabotage actions.
The city will be ours.
The machinery of the establishment... will be in ruins by morning.
The government will fall without firing one goddamn shot.
The new mayor will resign... and we'll move in and set up a tribunal.
It's curtains.
Blue, honey, talk to me a minute.
Don't bother me.
I want to talk to you, honey.
Let's go.
Leave me the hell alone.
We'll go and get some chinks.
I'm so hungry.
I ain't hungry.
Don't turn off on me.
Besides...
I don't need that garbage.
Every time you're with your friends you don't pay...
You son of a bitch!
That hurt me, god damn it!
What do you think I am, a boxing ball?
A punching bag!
Hit her! Hit her!
You know what you guys are?
You're a bunch of closet fags.
Shut up!
And when I leave this place... you'll get together and screw one another.
That's nice.
That is nice.
See, she loves it.
I love it, too.
We've got a lot of lousy time to kill.
I think I'm gonna ride that goddamn horse.
Then go on, have a go.
You'll love it.
Let me ride that goddamn horse.
Get on with it.
You know what you are?
You're a bunch of fucking Nazi fags!
Guys, that's uncool.
Don't do that.
Listen, you son of a bitch.
You lousy...
Cut it out.
You're hurting her!
You maniacs!
What are you doing to her?
Go ahead and hit me!
My God, my God!
I can't take it anymore!
This isn't working out, Blue.
Our relationship stinks.
Come on, Harriet.
Let's go inside. lt's cold.
I have to go to bed by day.
Come on inside, baby.
You'll get hurt out here.
Listen, I tried to stop them, but l...
Come on, Fritz!
Wait a minute, huh?
John says this night will mean... a great leap forward for America's social evolution.
I dig it.
We're gonna blow up the power plant.
This will keep you warm.
I gotta go.
Hey, baby.
We all had a good time and got our rocks off.
Now we must devote ourselves to the great task before us.
What'd you have to hit her so hard for?
She loved it.
Me and you have been assigned to blow up the power plant.
That's all I care about.
The revolution.
You're full of shit!
All you care about... is a reason to hurt, to destroy, to blow up.
You don't know what a real revolution is.
None of you sons of bitches do.
Harriet, well, she's good.
She's real. She loves.
She loves.
And when you get right down to it... that's where it's really at.
The love you give is equal to the love you get.
Well, fuck it.
I ain't doing it.
So long, Fritz.
I ain't planting this bomb for you schmucks.
Far out.
And though after my skin worms destroy this body... yet in my flesh shall I see God... whom I shall see for myself.
You gotta let us see our Fritz!
Where is he?
What have you done with him?
You can't go in there.
I'm sorry, girls.
He's under house arrest.
Let us see him ! Please!
-No one gets in.
-He's hurt.
Lord Jesus... and shalt believe in thine heart... that God hath raised Him from the dead.
I reckon he needed her.
He must be through.
Finished.
For with the heart... man believeth unto righteousness... and with the mouth... confession is made unto salvation.
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper... but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them... shall have mercy.
Fritz, we're so sorry, baby.
He's trying to say something.
I've been up and down... the four corners... of this big old world.
I've...seen it all... and I've done it all.
I've fought many a good man... and I've laid many a good woman.
And... if there's one thing
I've learned... it's...it's... you get over here... and you get down there like that...
Poor cat.
He was a... he was a tough kid at that, wasn't he?
Down the lane
They're strolling
Two by two
Holding hands
They smile like we used to do
Here with their one and only
I'd forgotten I was lonely
Oh, how I wish
That here were there with you
All the days of sadness
They seem so needless now
Yes, it's taken me
This long, long time
To see
It's clear
And my dreams
Keep drifting back to me
And our strolls
Beneath these same stars above
And when the leaves
Are falling
My heart will be recalling
You're the only girl
I ever really loved

- Yeah, I will Mom.
I'll turn it off right after the program's over.
- Program?
You know, I can remember when kids liked to have stories read to them.
They'd actually beg their parents, like their fathers, to read to these stories.
- Dad, you always start talking about that when I want to watch my program.
- It was a very big deal.
The fathers would read these exciting stories, and sometimes, adventure stories to them.
- This is my favorite program, Dad.
- And the kids, would brag to their friends about how their fathers would read these great...
- Dad, the other guys get to watch their programs.
- Kids used to like their parents, used to like them to read these marvelous...
- Dad.
Now let's see, now here's a story.
This is a story...
- There'll be monsters?
- This is a story a man could actually read to his...
- Yeah, okay Dad.
- Monsters?
Yeah, sure, monsters, listen.
Once upon a time, a long way from here, and a long way from now, there was a tiny village where everything, the houses and the carts, the bridges, and the barns, everything, all had points on them.
In fact, it was so full of points, that even the people had points.
The people, right there on top of their heads.
And it didn't seem strange at all because that's the way life was in the village.
That's the way it always had been.
And for all anybody knew, that's the way it always would be.
As you might have already guessed, the main activity of the village was making points.
And needless to say, business was brisk and the competition was competitive.

♪ And these are the people
♪ That's the way they wanted it

- And while the farmers kept the villagers bodies nourished with pointed crops, the artist colony in the community, as in all communities, did their part to keep minds and souls filled with new points to view.
♪ This is the town
♪ And these are the people
♪ This is the town
♪ Where the people all stay

♪ Everything needs one
♪ Couldn't be without one
♪ Everything has one

♪ And these are the people
♪ This is the town
♪ Where the people all stay
- It was a good life, a settled life, and the point was the point of it all.
You could look high, and you could look low, but you'd never hear any complaints on that Count.
Well, almost never.
♪ That's the way it's going to stay ♪
And then, one day, a very unusual thing happened in the village.
A little baby boy was born, a boy named Oblio.
Now, don't get the wrong idea.
The being born part wasn't usual.
Little kids were being born all the time in that village.
What was unusual was that Oblio, unlike any of the other babies born that day, or any other day, had no point.
He had no point at all.
- Hi, son.
Hi, Oblio.
- Well, hello there.
- Hi, how ya doin'?
- Fine, nice to see.
- Good, what's new?
- Same ol' sixes and sevens.
- Really?
Well, I have to...
- I guess you heard about them?
- Them?
- Them, yeah, they had a kid.
- That's nice.
- Kid's got no point.
- Come on.
- No, I'm serious.
Their kid's a kid who's got no point.
- You're putting me on.
- Would I lie to you?
- Well, I think that is wild.
- So, you see, Oblio was a kind of, involuntary, instant celebrity.
His uniqueness was, well, something that was noticed around the village.
Naturally, his parents couldn't help noticing, either.
- We have a lot to be thankful for, you know.
- He's a healthy little nipper, I'll say that.
- And he's happy.
- I'll be he'll be great...
- He has a wonderful disposition.
- Yeah, but he doesn't have a point.
- Maybe, maybe he'll grow one.
- But, he didn't.
No, as things turned out,
Oblio didn't grow any point at all, but it really wasn't so very noticeable.
As a matter of fact, in time, he took to wearing a cap, a pointed cap his mother made.
It kept his head warm, and it did make him look a lot more like the other ordinary kids in the village.
Just about the same time
Oblio got his new cap, he also got
- Arrow, Arrow.
You guessed it, the greatest dog in the world.
♪ Where ever we go
♪ Everyone knows
♪ It's me and my Arrow
♪ Me and my Arrow
♪ Taking the high road
♪ Where ever we go
♪ Everyone knows
♪ It's me and my Arrow
♪ Me and my Arrow
♪ Do da do do da do do
♪ Straight as an Arrow
And then, one day after school, a very serious thing happened.
- Hey, let's choose up sides for triangle toss.
- I got Harry.
- Okay, then I want Fred.
- Okay, Richard.
- All right, then,
I'll take Oblio.
- Not him, he can't play, out.
- It was the Count's son, and that was the serious thing.
You see, the village Count was a very powerful man, and, frankly, not all that nice a guy, and the way things sometimes work out, a certain amount of that not niceness has rubbed off on his son.
He was liked, but he was not well liked.
- How come you said
I couldn't play?
- 'Cause you can't, so beat it.
- Always have before, me and Arrow.
- Hey, look, you're not playing, so just push on.
- That's not fair.
- Tough, triangle toss is for people with pointed heads.
Toss the triangle...
- We know how to play the game.
- Then run and catch it on your point.
- Everybody knows that.
- Yeah, but you got no point.
So, you can't play.
- We can play better than you can.
- You what?
- I said, we can play better than you can.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You're looking for some real trouble here.
- And I'll bet you we can beat you at triangle toss, too.
- Say that again.
- I said, "I bet we can beat you at"...
- Yeah?
Well, what do you wanna bet?
- Come on no point, what do you wanna bet?
- Bet ya anything.
- Oblio and the Count's kid are gonna duel.

- Okay, here's the way we're gonna go.
Best two out of three catches, anything's fair.
- Holy cow, wow.
- Only rule is you gotta catch a triangle with your head, or your mutt's, in your case, Oblio.
The first man to catch two triangles wins.
Get the idea, Oblio?
So, long sucker.

- Yay, hooray for Oblio, yay.
- Thanks, but don't forget about Arrow.
Arrow was the...
- I won't forget Arrow, and I won't forget you either, round head.
- Now, why would you want to go say something like that for?
Remember, you were the guy who...
- I'll remember,
Oblio, and so will you.
My father will see to that.
- Hey, come on, it's just a dumb ol' game.
- A game, Oblio?
When my dad gets done with you, you'll wish this dumb ol' game had never been invented.
- If it's that important to you, then...
- Do you gather my meaning, Oblio?
- Predictably enough, when the Count learned of his son's defeat, he was furious.
As for the boy himself, as soon as he saw which way the wind was blowing, he just laid low and let his father's evil disposition lead the way.
- Would that it were not true.
You idiot, you pathetic fool.
I groomed you, how I groomed you.
I cultivated you like a rare flower, and for this?
No, by guile and foul deed
I laid the ground work for you to rule this miserable village one day, and rule you will.
I shall not be denied, but as long as that vile, little round person, that
Oblio languishes among us, your leadership credibility is shot.
We must rid ourselves of that contemptible little twerp, once and for all, and that's exactly what I intend to do.
Yes, you'll still rule one day, you useless nit because Oblio is finished.
You can bank on that.
- Now, the King, was a good-natured, harmless, old fellow, the kind who had weathered life in a rather middle groove, no great highs, no deep lows.
He was a decent, but very ordinary, man.
He was also a very ordinary ruler of other men.
- If it isn't the illustrious...
- My King, a word in your ear.
- Anything you say, my dear Count.
I was just relaxing with a couple of...
- Yes, I saw, King we have a problem.
- Well, that's hard to believe.
I thought all systems were go.
I mean, I always like to think that...
- King, the law of the land has been violated.
- Violated, the law of the land?
Why, why that's impossible...
- It is done.
- But there must be some mistake,
Why, the law of the land clearly states that everything and everyone must have a point.
That purely and simply is the law of the land.
Why, you can't violate a law like that in a place like this, just look around.
- You look around, my dear King.
The law is being violated, at this very moment.
For the sake of all the decent people, appropriate measures must be taken.
- Measures, measures?
My, my, measures on a grave charge like this would require my convening, my convening the tribunal.
- Exactly.
- My.
Now, now why do you want to go and create a problem like that?
- That's no problem, King.
That's a solution.
The problem was created when the law was violated.
In point of fact, by that little round-headed twit, Oblio.
- Oblio? Oblio?
But, I know him, why, he's a nice little boy.
I know his parents.
Why, it was my understanding that this Oblio was developing into a pretty decent little triangle toss player.
- So I gather.
He's also round, which, as you yourself know, is in direct violation of the law.
You may as well face it, my dear King, this Oblio is, literally, an outlaw.
- But that's incredible.
Wait a minute, he wears a nicely pointed hat.
That should Count for something, shouldn't it?
- No way, my King, we must convene a tribunal, a public tribunal, and so we shall, and then, after all the niceties are looked after, this Oblio will be neatly banished, forever.
- A tribunal? No, and for Oblio?
Why, isn't there any other way?
- The law is the law, King.
You cannot fight that.
- The law is the law, well, I never looked at it quite like that.
Very well, a tribunal it is, but I warn you Count, I won't have the boy railroaded.
- Railroaded?
- A turn of phrase, Count.
- While the Count was having a marvelous time, no matter how rotten he may have been ethically and spiritually and every other way, as a prosecutor, he was good, and as a stand-up performer, he was even better.
The way it all worked out, poor little Oblio never had a chance.
- And so, noble King, and good gentlemen of the tribunal,
I would only remind you that this law, so cherished a part of our tradition, was not enacted, nor is it being applied, for purposes of base persecution, or cruel harassment, good gracious no, the law was created to preserve and protect the sanctity, the integrity, the purity of our here, to for, unsullied life mode, and so it is, that this, this freak, this viper, Oblio, by his very existence here in our realm, only serves to...
- My dear, isn't the
Count absolutely too much?
- Well, I'm sure he's very good, but all the same, I can't help feelings sorry for little Oblio.
After all, he is...
- I just don't see how you could say that.
That's so, so sentimental.
Well, sure, he's little, but the law is still the law, and where would we be, my dear, if...
- But, to just sit here while those old men complacently let the little...
- Listen, neither one of us was born yesterday, and we both know if we let one of Oblio's kind stay, before long, the whole village will be crawling with...
- Psst, psst, my dear Count, isn't there some way or other little Oblio could just, sort of, stick around?
I mean, if he promised to keep his hat on all the time and didn't ever...
- In this stead my King, the law is most explicit.
We all agree that there has been a violation of law.
The violator is right here in our midst.
We can see that.
That is, as the fellow says, beyond question.
- Would it help if I promised to never ever play triangle toss again?
I mean, if that's what you're mad about Count, I could...
- No, gentlemen, the only question remaining is one of penalty.
Here, again, the law is crystal clear.
For such a grave breach, banishment, that is the order of the day.
- Yeah the Count's really pulling the chain on that weird little Oblio.
- How can you joke about such a thing?
I think a terrible thing's happening, and Oblio's such a lovely little boy.
- Yeah.
- You know, he's polite, and he's well mannered... - Well, he may be,
- but would you want your daughter to marry... - You're baiting me.
You're deliberately baiting me.
I will not be subject...
- Gentlemen, it remains beyond question that Oblio, by his mere rounded existence, stands in violation of the law.
Here, our duty is clear, but we would ill be serving the law to overlook an entirely new facet of the case.
In point of fact, Oblio was both aided and abetted by his flea-bitten canine.
- Hey, please, don't do anything to Arrow.
- Gentlemen, I charge this dog, Arrow, with criminal conspiracy.
- Honest, Arrow's innocent.
I did it by myself.
I did it, Arrow wasn't even...
- He is as guilty as Oblio himself, but what's more repellent about him, he's a disgrace to everything pointed.
No, gentlemen, this Arrow is not only a conspirator, he is also a traitor, and he, too, must be banished.
- Hey.
- How's it going?
- Not bad.
- So, what's the latest?
- Well, you know.
- Wild trial?
- Well, if you've seen one...
- What about this conspiracy business with Sparrow?
- Arrow.
- Right.
- It could be a toughy.
- No, you really think so?
- Conspiracy's no laughing matter.
- Hard way to go, is it?
- Could be for someone like Arrow.
- You know, he doesn't look like the conspiratorial type, though.
- He's got a record long as his tail.
- That long?
- Yeah,
Chasing, night barking, they'll throw the book at 'em.
- Adios, Arrow.
- That's it.
- And so, it is my deeply unpleasant task to declare that this tribunal finds the boy, Oblio, guilty of living within our midst without a point.
For this grave violation of law, he is, from this day forward, banished to the Pointless Forest.
I might just parenthetically add, as our good Count so aptly put it, the law is the law, and as all of you know, without the law, why, why there would be no lawyers and without lawyers there...
Well, it just goes on and on.
- Deal with the dog, my lord.
- Yes, the dog.
Well, Arrow,
I must send you over, too, boy, involuntary conspiracy.
- Take them away.
- Now dear, I know how you hate to wear undershirts, but we don't know what the weather will be like, and this is a dangerous time of year for colds, so...
- Sure, Mom, great,
I'll wear 'em.
So will Arrow.
Don't cry, Mom.
- Well, I just don't want you to take a chill, little Oblio.
- It's just about time, dear.
You all set Ob?
Well, son, I hope you realize,
I mean, I hope you understand how distressing this is for your mother and me.
I just wish there was some way, don't get me wrong,
I believe in obeying the law and everything.
Anything else would be anarchy but, still, I wish there was some way this particular law could be...
- Sure,
Dad, I understand.
- Well, I just wanted you to know this, Oblio.
- Good luck, Oblio.
Good luck, Arrow.
- And, don't blame the
King too much, son.
He just did what he had to do.
Well, after all, it's his job.
Frankly, I wish there never was such a law in the first place.
Now that it's been used, it seems, well, it really seems unfair.
- How come nobody did anything about it before, Dad?
- It just never came up before, son.
- Oblio, here Oblio.
Here's a candy bar for you, for the road.
- Gee, thanks Mr. Candy Man.
- And, this, this is for Arrow.
- Hang in there, Oblio.
- Stay lose, Ob.
- Be seeing you, Oblio.
- Oblio, ol' man, here's a little something for you, just in case you need some change.
You know, you can never tell when you might need a couple of bucks to...
Well, anyway, you know.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Take good care of yourself, dear little Oblio, and eat well, and write to us when you can.
I mean, it doesn't have to be anything long, just a card to say you're fine.
Would you do that, for your poor mommy,
Oblio?
- Sure, Mom, don't worry.
We'll be okay, right Arrow?
Come on, boy, let's go.
- Go get 'em, Oblio.
- Stay in there, pile driver.
- Go straight Ob, you've got it wired!
- Good luck, kid.
- Goodbye, Oblio.
Goodbye, son.
- Goodbye, my little baby.
- Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Come on, Arrow, let's go.

C'mon it's more than...

Talk about your oppressive villains.
- I like the kid, Oblio, and his dog, I think he's a great looking dog.
He reminds me...
- Yeah, he's a great looking, sure, I get it.
Use the imagination, the view from the mind's eye.
You've got a creative little head on your shoulders there, son.
- I bet you can just picture this little Oblio and his dog right now.
♪ Me and my Arrow
On and on they went.
After a while, they even stopped looking back.
The village having long since faded in the distance, and the truth of the matter is they were really a lot more excited about what lay ahead of them than what they had left behind, and who wouldn't be?
No one had ever been to the Pointless Forest.
Yet, now, Oblio and
Arrow were going.
- Hey, Arrow, you think they'll be monsters?
I'd be just as happy if there weren't any monsters.
But, either way, no matter what happens, we've got to stick close together because we're really a team now.
Hey, you know what I hope?
I hope, oops.
Arrow!
Could this be the
Pointless Forest?
How can it be?
It's got to be.
But, if it is, how come everything's got a point?
The leaves are pointed.
The branches and twigs are too.
Everything.
Well, this is it, Arrow.
This is the beginning of the place we were banished to.
There's just one thing
I don't understand.
How are we suppose to get through this stuff to get in there.
It's so thick, it's like a jungle.
Good boy, Arrow, good boy.
Now, just follow me.
No, I'll follow you.
No, we'll go together.
That's the plan, we'll go together.
And whatever you do, don't leave me, Arrow.
- Oblio and
Arrow and just barely set out onto the road into the Pointless Forest when all of a sudden,
- Arrow, look, a man.
A pointed man.
Excuse me, sir.
We thought this was the Pointless Forest.
Quite right my boy, well noted, this is the place indeed.
By name, the
Pointless Forest.
- But what is a pointed man doing in the Pointless Forest?
- Listen to the lad, me pointed?
That's too funny.
You know, he's funny.
Me, a pointed man?
This news amuses me.
- But, sir, you're pointing right now, more than any...
- My boy, I'm not the pointed man you think I am.
I can point in every direction, sure, any fool can do the same, but a point in every direction, is the same as no point at all.
Would you argue the point,
I wouldn't, not on a bet, it never entered my mind.
- Suddenly, Oblio and Arrow were all alone in the Pointless Forest.
At first, everything seemed quite peaceful.
Oblio thought about the pointed man and wondered what his friends in the village would have said, if only they knew he had seen and talked to such a rare person.
Then, Oblio noticed how quiet it was.
Arrow noticed, too.
It was very quiet.
Then, little by little,
Oblio began to feel lonely.
- You know Arrow,
I was just thinking.
I mean, about that pointed man.
I don't know.
I think there's something a little funny about that man.
I mean, he's pointed, heck, he's always pointing.
Then he says he isn't a...
Arrow, hey Arrow,
I think I'm scared.
Hey, now what do you want to go and growl like that for?
Especially, when I told you I...
What is it, boy?
Wow, giant bees, run, Arrow, run for your life.
Arrow, what'll we do?
Wow.
Arrow, help!
What was that?
- I believe it was e flat, double style, extra fortissimo, don't you know it?
- Say, what's happening with you, boy?
You been goofing with the bees?
- Gosh, who are you?
- It's me, the Rock Man.
- I never saw a rock man before.
- Well, us stone folks are everywhere, just open your eyes and look around you.
- You mean there are more of you?
- Naturally, baby.
There's a whole family of us rock folk.
- Well, I was wondering if this is still the Pointless Forest.
- It isn't, Jack, they ain't nothin' pointless about this gig, just look around yourself, the birds singing sweet loves song to the trees, squirrels doing crazy digs all over the place.
Mother Nature, she watchin' over the whole scene, and dig me, taking it all in.
- Yeah, but...
- It's the here and now that I'm talkin' about, the smell of sweet life in the air.
It's the warm feel of the sun and the beat of music, just digging yourself.
- But, I can't see the...
- Well, you see what you want to see.
Tell me, did you ever see a dinosaur?
- No.
- Well, did you ever see a pterodactyl?
- No.
- Well, did you ever want to see a pterodactyl?
- I guess not.
- Well, that's it, you see what you want to see, and you hear what you want to hear.
- Gosh, Mr. Stone Man...
- It's Rock Man, Jim.
You gotta keep yourself in historical prospective.
- I mean Mr. Rock Man, well, you see, you're surrounding everything.
- Come on, boy.
Out with it, don't get yourself all racked up and jammed, you got a question?
Lay it on me, but let it out easy.
- It's just that everything's been happening so fast.
We were banished and then those bees.
- I can dig it,
I can dig it, yes.
Look, let me hip you to reality.
- I'd really rather know if this is still the Pointless Forest.
- Now, there you go again, pointless, that's the central issue of what I'm putting down for you cats.
- You gotta open your mind as well as your eyes, but first, you gotta get it together, you know, be cool, dig yourself.
Get the message?
Now, here's the lick.
You don't have to have a point to have a point, dig?
Now, I fear you've been getting some negative vibration from some place.
You gotta collect yourself, be cool, be steady as a rock.
- Steady as a rock?
- That's right, being a rock is a very heavy life.
Us rock folk are impervious to heat.
We stay cool, we're insusceptible to water, and that's cool, too.
- But, when it rains, isn't it true that even stones...
- Now there you go again.
You're tensing up.
Rain, yeah, sure, maybe rain turn a tree into a water log.
Sometimes rain make a river lose its flood control, but a rock in the rain is just cool, very cool.
- Boy, I never realized that rocks and stones were so...
- All you gotta do is open your mind along with your eyes.
Now, you gotta long road, son, so you remember what I say, okay?
- I will
Mr. Rock Man, I will.
- Play it easy, and remember as you make it through this forest, ain't necessary to posses a point, to have yourself a point.
- I'll remember that.
- Yeah, well I think I'm gonna take myself a short nod, you roll by this way again, just fall in, I'm only a stone's throw...
- It was awfully nice of
Rock Man to explain that to us, and I'll tell you something else,
I'll bet it's not everybody who gets to talk to rock folks.
You know, he really was a...
- My good lad, been rolling right along I see.
- Arrow, it's the pointed man again.
Hello, sir.
- What's this, still talking of points, my boy?
Seems he's obsessed.
I'll make a point of noting that.
- Your point, my son, love game!
- We've just met a man who's made of stone.
- Yes, excellent fellow, splendid chap, all you got a do is relax.
You gotta open your mind, that's cool,.
- He's a nice man.
He knows a lot, and he's generous and...
- He gave you gifts, a little remembrance, perhaps a small memento?
- No, he told me things.
He's interesting to talk to.
- Completely pointless, my boy.
In word, abstract.
To put it bluntly, sonny bob, pointless all pointless.
As they say, no point, a big zero, as they say.
- Hey wait for us, wait.
- Sometimes, you never know how really happy you are to see a person, until after he's gone.
That's pretty much the way Oblio felt when he realized the man who was always pointing had just up and disappeared.
- Jimminy, Arrow, that was a close call.
You gotta watch your step.
That hole could be
Holy cow, there's no bottom to this thing.
Arrow, you could have been...
Arrow.
Gosh, Arrow.

- The lad persists, a dogged trooper that boy, to say nothing of that boy's dog.
They pursue in pointless pursuit.
They're pursuit is pointless.
- Good boy, Arrow, you found him.
Hi, sir, we've been looking all over for ya.
What a pleasure, what a splendid surprise, thought you might be holed up somewhere.
- We were trying to catch up with you, and then we found this gigantic hole.
It was big and dark, and scary.
- And frankly, quite pointless.
- No, we learned a lot.
I know Arrow did, and so did I.
Old Arrow found out he's really gotta...
- Careful sonny, don't get in over your head.
It wouldn't do to bury yourself intellectually,
Point of fact, it never pays to submerge too deeply.
- What is it, Arrow?
- He must hear something.
- Well, of course he hears something, obvious.
- Come on boy, what's wrong?
What is it, Arrow?
It seems like he's trying...
Gone again.
Hey, hey Arrow, hey wait a minute, boy.

- Thankless, wouldn't you say?

- How's that?

- The ladies, those three fat ladies, they way they danced and played and...
- Yes, quite pointless, wouldn't you say, fat, round, pointless, get it?
- No, they do have a point.
It's laughter and merriment and making each other happy.
- Really?
That's an interesting misconception, but then, I'm sure you'll agree.
- Hey, you, are you kidding?
For crying out loud, will you get out of there?
Not there, either.
For the love of Morris, what are you trying to do?
You trying to destroy me?
Will you back off?
What is this?
Will you stop fooling with that mutt and get away from those leaves, you pathetic nincompeep.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I didn't see you, and
I didn't realize...
- All right, all right, all right all ready.
As it happens, those are Sunday in the sunset leaves, a golden veneer and very rare, and you looked like you were just going to plow right...
- Gosh, I'm sorry, I never...
- You know, leaves like that don't just grow on trees or something.
- I really am sorry.
We thought we were just in the regular Pointless Forest.
This is still the
Pointless Forest, isn't it?
- Pointless? Pointless?
Just look at those leaves, each one more pointed than the last.
I tell you, this is the most pointed collection of...
- Then, you're a collector.
Golly, a leaf collector.
- A collector?
What, are you joking or something?
Who ever heard of a grown man going around collecting leaves?
That's weird.
What am I suppose to do, put them in a scrapbook?
- Well, I just thought...
- No, you didn't think.
We're in business here, business.
This isn't some game we're playing young man.
This is the real thing, and we gotta move.
- Jimminy, the leaf business.
I didn't know people sold leaves.
Well, I always thought...
- You thought, you thought, yeah, and while you're thinking I'm losing time, besides, I will do all the thinking around here.
- Gosh, sir, I...
- Listen, I can't talk now, young man.
It's go for broke time from here on in.
This is the time of year we put together a whole fall line.
- I'm afraid I don't know what a fall line is.
- It's the magic of the sorcerer and the excitement of the artist at the moment of creation.
It's when we turn green leaves into greenbacks, when the gold on those trees becomes gold in our pockets.
- You mean you're gathering all these leaves for...
- Gathering? Gathering?
I'm not a gatherer, sonny.
I'm manufacturer, and when you're in the manufacturing game, timing is everything.
You make it or break it on timing.
Sure, design counts, quality counts, maximizing total production potential, that counts.
They all count, but without good ol' timing it's so long Charlie.
- But, with leaves, how do you know if...
- Take the fall season, if
I brought it out in July, it's forget it, it's a distaster.
Timing, it's all timing.
All right, let me ask you something.
- Anything you want.
- You're interested, I like that, and you're sharp
I need people who are sharp.
Sure, I can get help, but good help, that's something else, again.
Question, is the world ready for a tweed leaf?
Stop and think.
- To tell you the truth,
I just don't know.
- I like that, you're honest.
Yes, timing and honesty, that's the name of the game.
All right, let's face it, this is a business just like any other business.
Anyone can learn a business, right?
But, honesty, you either got it or you ain't got it.
Where you from, what's bothering you?
- Excuse me sir, but don't leaves just make themselves?
Naturally, without any...
- My boy, you got a lot to learn.
Tell me, what nationality are you?
- Well, sir, I'm from the Pointed Village.
- That's funny, you don't look pointed.
- As it works out, I'm not, but my parents are.
- It's all right, don't give it a second thought, my boy.
I don't care what a man's faith, creed or color is. The only thing that matters to me is whether or not he can produce.
Well, what do ya say?
- About what?
- Are you in or not?
I'm offering you a chance to get into the leaf game.
- But, what could I do?
- Naturally, you'll have to start on the forest floor and work your way up, and I'll tell you one thing,
I don't want to ever see you or that clown of a dog of yours standing around on the product.
- We wouldn't, you can be sure of that.
- Great opportunity for you, my boy.
It can open doors for you, big doors.
Seasonal, yes we're seasonal, summer, winter, spring, fall.
You and your dog will work like dogs.
Rest?
You'll rest during the fifth season, and their isn't any fifth season, but there are rewards.
It's exciting, challenging work, manufacturing leaves.
- But that's just it, sir.
I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I don't see how
Arrow and I could...
- It's the simplest thing in the world, my boy.
You just plant your roots, right here with me, and by next season, you'll...
- But, we don't have any roots to plant, we aren't...
- No roots? No roots?
Well that just about tears it, doesn't it?
It's too bad, too.
You could've been up there with the best of 'em, kid.
Sunday in the sunset, leaf of gold, you name it, you could have had everything, and together, we would have been unstoppable.
We could have given
'em those tweed leaves, it could have been beautiful, beautiful.
- Boy, it sure sounds like it could've been.
But, something's kind of confusing me.
- Well, you just name it, son.
You can't get answers in this world, if you don't ask questions.
- It's just that I know there's a point to every leaf, but what's the point to all the leaves, your leaves?
- That confuses you, doesn't it?
Well, all of mankind is confused.
You work, you struggle, you fight to survive.
Little by little, you make something, you get ahead, and then one day you look, you see you got something, and I mean really something.
- But, what's the...
- Can't talk now, young man, gotta time problem that won't quit.
Yes, timing.
Timing, that's the name of the game.
- No Arrow, let's go around. Who knows, these could belong to the Leaf Man, too, and you know how he is about stepping on his product.
- That's quite right my boy, watch your step, what ever you do don't bring a leave to grief.
It's branch might blanch, worse yet, it's trunk might go kerplunk.
- Mr. Pointed Man, you should have been with us.
We met a very important business man.
- Was he out raking leaves, perhaps?
This brilliant industrialist, this extraordinary tycoon, ho, ho, ho, he, he, he.
My good lad, your manufacturer is a bust.
His product is so un-unique, it has to be completely pointless.
- No, he's a very industrious industrialist, and he never rests, and he always...
- My boy, he's spinning his wheels.
To put it concisely, his work is futile.
In a manner of speaking, it's pointless.
- That can't be, he told me that...
- Sunday in the sunset, today tweed, tomorrow herringbone.
The man's a lunatic.
He's mad, clearly a case of dementia.
- But he was nice, he offered me a chance to...
- He's a King among me.
He's a prince of a fellow.
I pass, pair of jacks, ace high, in sum, my good lad, pointless, pointless.
- I don't see how you can keep saying that about everybody.
I mean, just because you don't...
- Careful, boy, don't jump to any rash conclusions.
You could land on thin ice, and come up all wet if you follow the image I've drawn.
That could be a chilling experience.
- Little by little, Oblio was learning a good deal about the Pointless Forest and it's unusual residents, but unfortunately for him, and Arrow too, his knowledge couldn't possibly help him anticipate what was hovering directly above.
No, Oblio had absolutely no way of knowing what was in the wind.
Hey.
Hey.
Gee, Arrow, I always thought of a forest as a bunch of tree trunks, but it's a lot more.
It's treetops, and horizons, and hills and meadows and everything.
Man, this is great.
- You know something, this bird could mean real trouble now.
- Aw, Dad, they'll be okay.
- Sure, that's easy for you to say.
- What can an old bird do?
- Well, you're not up there, hanging on for dear life.
- Aw, come on Dad.
You know he's not going to let him drop.
- Well, I don't know that.
I don't know that, and you don't either.
You don't know how dependable he is.
Why, he could very easily...
- Nah, Dad, not a bird that size.
- A bird what size?
- Well, didn't you mention something about a huge bird?
I thought you said...
- You know, when I was a kid, my dad read to me, and I listened, and I listened closely.
I didn't go around interpreting things.
- Yeah, okay Dad.
- I didn't jump to conclusions.
- That's good, Dad.
- I don't know what's happened to kids now days.
You give 'em everything.
You offer to read to 'em.
I don't know, I just don't know.

- Back to earth again, Arrow.
We made it safe and sound.
- As Oblio circled the mammoth egg, he was overcome with a strange sensation.
He looked at the egg, very closely, examining it again and again, but each time, his conclusions were exactly the same.
- Hey, this is weird.
Just when I was sort of starting to think that this Pointless Forest isn't pointless at all, we come across something that really is pointless, at least it sure looks like it is.
- You see, after each one of his adventures in the forest, Oblio always found himself left with a sort of free-floating feeling, that there was some sort of point to what he had experienced.
Even though it had happened in a Pointless Forest.
- A point.
Arrow, I was right in the first place.
Even a thing like this, a thing that looks like it's all round has some sort of point.
Hi, little fella.
I mean, big fella.
Are you all right?
Well, I'm Oblio, and this guy right here's my dog.
His name's Arrow.
What, are you saying what?
Well, what happened is you just got hatched.
You're born now, but don't worry, it happens to everybody, you'll be okay.
Where, is he saying where, Arrow?
That's a little harder.
You see, the name of this place is the Pointless Forest.
That's where we are, all right, but I'll tell you something,
I'm starting to think that instead of being pointless, this forest is full of points.
Take you for instance, sure, you've got a pointed beak, but that's just a point, any one can see that.
Your real point, well, that's something else again.
Why?
That's the hardest one to answer.
That's what I always want to know, why.
And that's the question everyone always asks.
- Splendid idea, my boy.
I'd like mine over easy, with a side-order of bacon, if you please, very crisp and coffee, the old mocca java!
I had a hunch you'd be serving brunch.
And perhaps an apricot danish.
- Mr. Pointed Man,
I'm glad you're here, but how come that nice new bird's mother took him away like that?
We were just talking about the why of everything, why this, why that, and just when
I was thinking that...
- Now, there you go again, you're thinking, that's very destructive, my lad, most destructive indeed.
If a person does enough thinking, a certain amount of knowledge is sure to follow.
The results, sonny bob, could be a life of misery.
- But, I can't help it,
I haven't been trying to think.
Things just sort of start popping up in my mind.
They occur to me out of...
- Thoughts just start popping up into your mind, ideas formed without any effort on your part?
You find that concepts simply conceptualize?
- Well, yes.
- That's grim.
- It started way back when I met the rock man.
- It's a disaster.
- And it just kept on happening.
- Mayday, it's a complete mayday.
- I was hoping maybe you could help me figure out just exactly...
- There's really nothing more that I can do.
You're out of my hands,
I tried to help you boy.
I can show you the pointlessness of it all, but you wouldn't listen.
- Sir, I hope you don't think I'm ungrateful.
- You had to go digging around, didn't ya?
You had to let thoughts slip into your head.
You're lost lad, lost.
The kid blew it, had everything going for him, and he blew it.
The fact is, my boy, that it's under the circumstances, there's no place in the
Pointless Forest for you.
- But, where will
I go, what will I do?
I can't go home again, the Count had me banished.
- Ta ta, jolly bye, ciao bucky, ciao.
- Golly, gone again.
I wonder where he goes when he does that.
- Vanishing Point, ol' man, correct, the Vanishing Point, just another one of the facilities.
Well, adieu, fare thee well, you take care of yourself, ya hear?
- So long, sir.
- Oblio watched as the Pointed Man disappeared, but unlike all the other times, he was not especially overwhelmed by what he saw.
- I think he's really gone this time, Arrow.
Arrow?
Arrow?
Here, boy.
Arrow?
I hear you boy, but where are you?
He's gone.
Stay where you are, Arrow.
Don't move, I'll find ya.
I know I will.
Good boy, Arrow.
Come on boy, you're all right now.
Come on, Arrow.
- It had been a full day for the two travelers, a very full day.
For Oblio, it had been one adventure after another, of course, it had been pretty adventurous for Arrow, too.
- That Vanishing Point, it only made it so I couldn't see.
It didn't make it so you weren't really there.
I'm starting to think that the Pointed Man, nice as he was, was realy about the only pointless person we've met in this whole Pointless Forest.
Sure, he did an awful lot of talking, and it all sounded very fine, almost like the Count in a way, and after all, what's such a big deal about having a point on your head?
Nothing against you,
Arrow, you're great.
But, I sort of think what's in your head is a lot more important.
It sure gets dark fast, doesn't it?

- But, I miss him,
I miss my Oblio.
- Yeah, he was a great little guy.
- And I'm worried about him.
- That little guy, nah, he'll do great out there.
- But he's so young.
- Yeah, but he's sharp, he's sharp.
He's young, but he's sharp.
- We should have never let them send him away.
- Yeah, well, go tell the Count that,
I mean, it was the law, dear.
- It's a bad law.
- Well, good law, bad law, what difference does it make?
It's the law.
- It makes all the difference.
A good law never would have sent my Oblio away, never.
- Dear, the law is the law.
- Well, you should have challenged it.
- What, I should have challenged it?
- We all should have.
- Law, I mean, but, but the Count came right out and said...
- The Count, the Count.
What about my Oblio?
- Well, look, I mean,
I'm just one man, I...
- We should have all stood up.
Even the King seemed like he was against...
- Well, maybe you're right, maybe you're right.
Maybe we should have tried.
- He's so young.
- What, the King?
- My little Oblio.
- Oblio, Oblio, it's Oblio.
Hey, it's Oblio
- Welcome home Oblio.
- We're glad you're back, Oblio.
- You tell 'em Ob, break it down for 'em.
- Come by the shop, Oblio.
I have some butter balls for you, round, competely round.
- Hello, Oblio.
- There he is, there's Oblio.
- My baby, my Oblio.
- Well, hi son.
Hi, Oblio.
- On to the palace.
- To the King.
- Your majesty, your majesty, there's a mob at the palace gate.
- Mob?
Well, that's pretty hard to believe.
- Well, it's true, you know what a mob is.
Shall I call out the palace guard?
- Well, that does seem a bit excessive, doesn't it?
- Well, what do you suggest?
Send out a pastry tray, and let them eat cake?
- Well, that's never worked before.
Tell me, what does your intelligence agency make of it?
- Nothing yet, nothing.
They're still trying to infiltrate the crowd, but I'll tell you one thing, according to my son, it's all for that kid, that twerpy, round-headed Oblio.
- Oblio?
You mean little Oblio, who we...
- Yes, my son claims he's come back.
- Really?
Oblio, little Oblio is back?
- This is gravely serious, my dear King.
- Yes, it is.
You know something, Count?
You may have misread the will of the people in that Oblio case.
An unruly mob?
Well, isn't that just the limit?
- Silence, I demand silence.
Can't a man get a little peace and quiet in his own...
Say, what are you doing back?
This litle runt is an outlaw.
You're an outlaw, child.
You are banished to the Pointless Forest.
- And I went to the
Pointless Forest, in fact I...
- Nonsense, sheer, irrevocable, nonsense.
I'll have you in chains for this.
Arrest this little...
- Hold it, hold it, Count, the boy was saying something.
- Yeah, right on, break it down for him, Obi.
- Yes, right on Obi.
- Well, sir, we did go to the Pointless Forest,
Arrow and I, all through it, in fact.
And you know something?
It isn't pointless at all.
- It's not?
- What?
What?
Not pointless?
Madness.
That's madness.
Sheer madness.
- Will you be quiet, Count?
I want to hear Oblio.
Now, Oblio, you were saying?
- Well, the fact is, sir, just about everything we ran into had a point to it, the leaves, the trees, everything.
- I see, Obi, well, I can't really argue that one with you, but what about yourself, son?
- Well, sir, I figure if everything has a point, then I must have one, too.
- He has a point there.
Villain, treason, public naughtiness.
I will not stand by while this pointless person tries to undo the law of the land.
My dear and loyal friends, if he had a point, he'd have one.
Impossible.
- And so it was, that Oblio and Arrow returned safely from their travels, only a little older, but certainly a good deal wiser.
As for the Pointed Village, well, the way things worked out, it was a much better place to live after Oblio's return.
True, the people didn't have their once cherished points, right there on top of their heads, put that didn't matter so much anymore.
People just started assuming that every man had some kind of a point, whether it shows or not.
- The end.
Now that's a story son, is that a story, or...
- Yeah, Dad, it was a good story, really.
- Good, good, it was great, great story.
- Sure, Dad, it was.
- I mean it had everything right there, adventure, a little comedy, funny scene or two.
There was a lesson.
You caught the lesson, didn't you?
- Right, Dad, I caught it.
- Well, what do you think it was?
- Well, just because somebody doesn't have what other people have doesn't mean that you know, they have to be turned out of the kingdom, or something.
- Yes.
- Dad?
- What is it, son?
- Thanks for reading me the story.
- You're welcome, son.

I think you'll admit at your age, that's a crime.

If I have a choice.

It's the shortest sentence I know.

Could you tell me where the right road to a 
-a Diction-opolis or- or someplace...
Whether Man: Dictionpolis? Well now, well now, well now. 
I don't know of any wrong road to Dictionopolis, so if this road goes to Dictionopolis at all, it must be the right road. Don't you think?
And if it doesn't, it must be the right road to somewhere, mustn't it?
Because there are no wrong roads to anywhere.
Do you think it'll rain?
Milo: But I thought you said you were the "weather" man.
(Scooting Noise)
Whether Man: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm the whether man, not the weather man.
For after all, it's more important to know whether there will be a change in the weather, than what the weather will be, don't you think?

But my job is to hurry them along anyway.
So I'd better hurry you along, too.

It's against the law to think in the Doldrums.
Milo (Yawning): That's ridiculous. 
Everybody thinks.
Lethargians: We don't. And most of the time, you don't. 
And that's why you're here. You weren't thinking.
And you weren't paying attention, either. People who don't pay attention often get stuck in the Doldrums...(Snores)
Milo: Hahaha. That's silly. 
Hahaha!
Lethargians: Stop that at once! 
Laughing is against the law.
And smiling is permitted only on alternate Thursdays.

I can't stop now.

I'd snapped my main spring.
You must excuse my gruff conduct, but you see it's traditional for watch dogs to be ferocious.
Milo: I thought you were just great, but are you sure it's alright...to leave those Lethargians back there alone?
Tock: Oh, I don't just watch Lethargians, I watch boys too. And right now, I'd say, you needed a watchdog.
And anyway I just love automobile rides!
Milo: I'm very pleased to have you along.
My name is Milo.
Tock: Milo. That's a strange name for a boy.
My name is Tock.
Milo: Well, I mean uh-well- isn't that kind of a strange name...for a dog?
Tock: Oh, no. How many names can you give a watchdog?
Actually, my name is Tick-Tock.
My friends call me Tock.

It's about time I had a friend.

But time is your friend.
Time marches on, time and tide wait for no man-

Take it and make of it all you can.
Use all you can, there's not a moment to spare.
So, take a second to look around,
See a sight, hear a sound.
Take a minute to concentrate, 
Analyze...Contemplate!
Take an hour and change the fate of the world!
Time is a gift, given to you,
Given to give you the time you need,
The time you need to have the time of your life!
Time ticks hastily away,
Take time to save it every day!
Time saved, in the nick of time,
Is golden time.
Milo: Time, time, time, time.
(Milo and Tock Begin Doing Rounds, 
Singing Different Lyrics Simultaneously in Harmony)
Milo: Time is a gift, fleeting and swift,
Tock: Times...ticks...
Milo: Ticking and tocking itself away.
Tock: ...Hastily.
Milo: Itself a way of saying better beware.
Tock: Time to save it every day.
Milo: Time is a gift, precious and rare.
Tock: Time...saved...
Milo: Take it and make of it all you can.
Tock: ..in the nick of time.
Milo: Use all you can, there's not a moment to spare.
Tock: Is golden time...
Milo: So take a second to look around,
Tock: So just stop and
Milo: See a sight, hear a sound.
Tock: ...look around.
Milo: Take a minute to concentrate.
Tock: And concentrate.
Milo: Analyze, Contemplate.
Tock (echoes): Analyze. Contemplate.
Milo: Take an hour, and change the fate of the world!
Tock: Take an hour, and change the fate of the world!
Milo: Time to give, given to you,
Tock: Time...time...time...
Milo: Given to give to the time you need:
Tock: Time...
Milo: The time you need to have the time of your life!
Tock: Time...of your life.
Milo/Tock together:
The time you need to have the time of your life....!
Milo: Golly! I've never seen such a- 
...a beautiful country, Tock. What country is it?
Tock: Well, it used to be called the Kingdom of Wisdom, until the old King died.
But then, it was divided into two states. On one side, Dictionopolis, the Kingdom of Words.
It's ruled by King Azaz, who has an iron law that all words are more important than numbers.
The other side is Digitopolis, the Kingdom of Mathematics, ruled by the Mathemagician.
His law is that numbers are more important than words.
And over there, in the mountains of ignorance, the demons are gathering, just waiting...
(Thunder Roars)
And beyond those mountains, Milo, is our only chance.
The C-a-s-t-l-e in the A-i-r.
Milo: Well that's where I'm going.
The Castle in the Air.
Tock: Don't say that again, Milo.
It makes the demons very angry.
But at least there's one sane and intelligent man left in this country: Chroma the Great.
That's one of his best rainbows.
Milo: Hey! There goes the Whether Man.
Whether Man: Have you found my way yet?
I hope it isn't mildewed.
Tock: Come on, Milo. Let's go. We're wasting ti-
Milo: I know, I know. We're wasting time.
(Pleasant, Traveling Music Plays)
Tock: Stop! 
Milo: What's that?
Tock: Hmm...Unless I'm very much mistaken, you just missed running into the abode of Kakofonous A. Dischord.
Kakofonous A. Dischord (KAD): Ahh, whooo!!
(Honks Horn) Beautiful, isn't it. 
KAD (singing): But.. Of all the beautiful things in life, that nature has provided. (Horn Honks)
A daffodil. A buttercup.
A bird...(bird tweets a melody).
(KAD hums/mumbles to himself, laughs)
KAD: The loveliest things of all to me,
I long ago decided.
Cannot be seen,...they only can,
be heard!
(Music and Pots Begin Banging in Rhythm)
(Pots Continue to Clang, Thunder Roars)
KAD: I..I..give people noise.
(Pots Continue to Clang, Thunder Roars)
Wonderful, deafening, earsplitting noise.
KAD: Whistles and squeaks, screeches galore.
KAD: Jingles and jangles, oh how I adore all that-
KAD: Noise, noise! Marvelous noise!
KAD: Horrible, hideous. Awful, insidious-
KAD: Noise, noise, noise!
KAD: You don't look well my boy.
KAD: Hey here, let's have a look at you (Horn Honks)
KAD: Just as I suspected, you are suffering from a severe lack of noise.
KAD: Now, this'll fix you right up.
KAD: Honking horns, screeching trains, bells, shouts,
KAD: Shrieks, gurgling drains. And all the rest of-
KAD: -those wonderfully unpleasant sounds we use so much of today.
KAD: Now here, take this and you'll never have to hear a pleasant sound again.
Milo: No! No- no thank you. I don't want to be cured of pleasant sounds.
KAD: Well now, that's very unusual. 
However, nothing odd.
KAD: I'll just give it the Awful Dynne.
Milo: The Awful Dynne? *(Din).
Dynne: Whoa hahaha! Ahhh, that was good, Master.
KAD: This is my assistant, the Awful Dynne.
Milo: Gee, I don't think I've ever met an awful Dynne before.
KAD: What?? Never met an Awful Dynne before? 
Oh you must be mistaken.
When you're playing in your room and making a lot of noise, what do they tell you to stop?
Milo: Why, the- the awful din! (Dynne Laughs)
KAD: And when the street is being repaired with about 50 jackhammers going all day, (Jackhammer Noise)
KAD...what does everybody complain of?
Milo: The awful din!
KAD: Right, and now my valued assistant will show you var-de-ous (*various) examples from my rare, exotic, and seldom heard...noises.
Dynne? (Horn Honks)
Dynne laughs/begins singing)
Dynne: Didja...ever hear an elephant tap dance, on a tin roof late at night? / That's noise...beautiful noise!
Did you ever hear a centipede crying...when his shoes don't fit him right? / That's noise... beautiful noise!
Did you ever hear a hungry dinosaur hiccup on a windy day?
Did you ever hear a nervous butterfly nibble on a cheese soufflé?
(Carnival Music, Awful Dynne Laughs)
KAD: Ah, yes. Noise is very fashionable today!
Why I can hardly fill the orders for noise pills, racket lotion, clamor salve, and hubbub tonic!
Years ago, well everyone wanted pleasant sounds.
But today, all they want is -
(Loud Noises Coincide With Lyrics)
KAD: Crash! Bing! Bang! Boom! Ah! Plunk! Ding! Doo!
KAD: Noise, noise, nerve jangling noise,
KAD: Battering, Chattering, Shattering Noise!
KAD: Gurgles and screams, all of that stuff!
KAD: Tickle my eardrums, I can't get enough-
KAD: of that noise, noise, marvelous noise!
KAD: Horrible, hideous, awful, insidious!
KAD: Noise, noise, noise!!

(Pleasant, Holiday-Like Music Plays)
Tock: Looks like a beautiful crop, doesn't it, Milo?
I've never seen fatter W's.
And those A's look delicious!
Milo: Are those letters growing on those trees?
Tock: Well, money doesn't grow on trees, does it?
Milo: No. It's just that I've never seen letters growing on trees, either.
(Time is a Gift Music Begins)
Milo/Tock Sing Simultaneously Again
Milo: Take a minute to concentrate.
Tock: And Con-cen-trate.
Milo: Analyze. Contemplate.
Tock (echoing): Analyze. Contemplate.
Milo: Take an hour and change the fate of the wor-ld!
Tock: Take an hour and change the fate of the wor-ld!

(Vendors Yelling to Attract Customers)
Man: Catchphrases!

British Man: Nice whats, wheres, whiches, whens, and whos. Get 'em by the where, get 'em by the batch.
Man: Halfbaked ideas here. Halfbaked Ideas.
Man: Meaty words here. Chops, steaks, venison.
Man: Poetic Words. Sublime words.
Man: Step right up, step right up. 
Fancy, best quality words right 'ere.
How 'bout you young man?
How 'bout a nice bag full of pronouns!
Or maybe you'd like our special assortment of adjectives. (Vendor's Voice Fades Into Background)
Milo: Boy, wait'll Ralph hears me use these!
How much are these, sir?
Vendor: And were you thinking of using all of 'em in the same sentence?
Milo: Why ye- yes, sir.
Vendor: Well, (laughing) I'll tell you what, lad.
Why don't you just take a bag full of happys and goods to start with?
Very useful for Happy Birthday, Happy New Year, happy days, and happy-go-lucky.
Useful too for good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good riddance, and goodbye!
Man: Nouns by the pound! Nouns by the pound!
Man B: Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Do it yourself. Make up your own words. Be creative!
Have fun! Start a language!
Milo: That looks pretty difficult, Tock. 
I'm not much good at making up words.
Bee: Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Milo: Look out!
Bee: A-S-S-I-S-T-A-N-C-E
Milo: Tock, look out!
Tock: It's alright, Milo. It's just the Spelling Bee.
Bee: Yes, please don't be alarmed. A-L-A-R-M-E-D. Alarmed. I know boys are often afraid of bees.
B-E-E-S. Bees. But let me assure your my intentions are peaceful. P-E-A-C-E-F-U-L.
Milo: And you don't sting?
Bee: Sting? (Laughs). Oh I can sting, but I don't. However, I can spell anything. A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.
Milo: Anything?
Bee: Any word that has ever been written in any language, any where.
Humbug: Balderdash. Let me repeat. Balderdash.
Bee: Balderdash?! Why you-
Humbug: Come now. Don't be ill-mannered.
Isn't someone going to introduce me to this little boy?
Fine, manly little fellow.
Bee: This is the Humbug. H-U-M-B-U-G. 
A very dislikable fellow.
Humbug: Nonsense. Everyone loves a humbug.
(Humbug Laughs). Insectious Humbugious. 
If I may use the Latin.
Bee: "Insectious Humbugious"? Why, you fraud! 
You can't even spell your own name.
Humbug: A slavish concern for the composition of words is the sign of a bankrupt intellect.
Be gone, odious wasp!
You smell of decayed syllables.
Bee: Odious wasp?! How dare you!
En garde! E-N G-A-R-D-E.

Shrift: Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! 
I've never seen anyone so guilty.
Milo: Uh-oh.
Shrift: Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
Just as I thought, you again!
Shrift: Guilty of sowing confusion.
Upsetting the alphabet cart.
Milo: Apple cart.
Shrift: Correcting an officer. 
Breaking havoc.
Mincing words. 
And having a dog with an unauthorized alarm.
Shrift: And illegal barking.
Shrift: I sentence you both to six million years in prison.
Milo: Six million years?
But- but only a judge can sentence you!
Shrift: Good point. (Magic Music).
I sentence you both to six million years in prison.
Shrift: Come along. I'll take you to the dungeon.
Milo: But- but you can't. I mean- only a jailer can put you in prison.
Shrift: Good point. (Magic Music).
I am also the jailer.
Come on, come on!

Bee: Be the "e" of good hope. H-O-P-E.
Shrift: You'll find it quite pleasant down here.
Milo: Isn't it a little dark?
Shrift: Of course it's dark. Dungeons are always dark. If they weren't dark, they wouldn't be so unpleasant.
Milo: But you said it would be pleasant down here.
Which-
Shrift: Precisely. Which (*Witch).
You can always chat with a Which if you get lonely.
Shrift: This is it, all the comforts of home.

Frightening Music Plays
Which: Oh, there you are! How do you do?
Milo: (hesistates) Hello.
Which: Come in, come in, come in.
Milo: You'd better be very careful, m'am.
There's a witch around here somewhere.
Which: Well, of course there is! I am she.
Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.
There, you see? Official Which: Kingdom of Wisdom.
Milo: Oh, a Which! Like the Whether Man.
Which: Of course! The Whether Man is my brother.
At least he used to be.
I don't know whether he still is,
I haven't seen him in years!
Have a cookie.
The question marks are delicious!
Milo: What does a Which do?
Which: Well, I used to help people choose which words to use-
Which were the most proper and fitting words for any and all occasions.
But when Rhyme and Reason were banished-
Milo: Rhyme? And Reason?
Which: Yes, Milo. When the two kings had their terrible quarrel-
(Adventerous Music Begins)
Which: When King Azaz insisted that words were far more important than numbers, and hence his kingdom was truly the greater, and when Mathemagician claimed that numbers were much more important than words, and therefore his kingdom was supreme, why then naturally, they asked the Princess of Sweet Rhyme, and the Princess of Pure Reason to settle the question.
Milo: And what did they decide? What is the most important? Words or numbers?
Which: The princesses decided that words and numbers are of equal value.
Tock: In the cloak of knowledge, one is the warp and the other in the woof.
Which: But you see Milo, this decision infuriated the two kings, and they banished the princesses to the 
Castle in the Air. (Dramatic Music Plays)
And I was thrown into this dungeon.
Tock: And that's why people don't seem to care anymore which words they use, as long as they use lots of 'em.
Milo: And that's why there's no rhyme or reason around here, and everybody thinks he's so good!
Hey! Maybe we can rescue them, and rescue you too Mrs. Faintly...in about six million years.
Soldier L: Ah, there you are.
Soldier M: Where have you been?
Soldier N: Been looking all over for you.
Soldier O: Royal banquet is about to begin.
Soldier P: Soup's on.
Milo: I still have to serve my sentence of six million years in prison.
Soldier L: No time for sentences.
Soldier M: No time for words.
Soldier N: Condemn boy to hearty meal.
Soldier O: Prisons are for the birds.
Soldier P: Jailbirds.
Soldier L: Mustn't keep Azaz waiting.
Soldier M: Things get hungry, too.
Soldier N: Royal banquet's just beginning.
Soldier O: Just in time for royal stew.
Soldier P: Chow (Ciao).
Milo: Goodbye Mrs. Macabre, don't worry.
I'll find a way to rescue you.
(Cheerful Music)
Tock: Bye, Faintly. We'll be back.
Soldier: His Majesty, the Supreme Ruler of Semantics,
Most Eminent Chieftain of Participles,
Lord and Master of Words, Super Sovereign of Syntax,
Chief Potentate of Adverbs and Prepositions.
(Soldier P Whizzing to Grab Chair)
King Azaz the Unabridged.
Milo: If you please, sir.
(Azaz Bristles At "Sir")
Milo: Your majesty. My name is Milo, <br/>and this is Tock, my watchdog.
And we've been sentenced to six million years for-
Azaz: Ahhh! Six million?
That's not a sentence, that's a number.
It's against the law to mention numbers here in Dictionopolis. Words are the only things that matter.
Milo: I'm sorry your kingship, sir.
Azaz: After all, me boy-
(Singing) You couldn't have one fine day without the "day," could you?
You couldn't have tea for two without the "tea," could you?
You couldn't have three blind mice, without the "mice," could you?
So you see, Milo, words are really, very valuable things.
If you think a great thought, how do you write it down?
Words!
If you spot a brush fire, how do you warn the town?
Words!
If you have opinions, how do you speak your piece?
If you rent a castle, how do you read your lease?
If you know a good joke, how do you tell a friend?
Words, words! That's how.
Words in a word are amazing. You can read 'em, you can write 'em, you can sing 'em,
and recite 'em, underline them. Misdefine them.
They're amazing!
Words in a word are fantastic!
You can hint 'em, you can say 'em, you can print 'em, you can pray 'em.
Emphasize them and despise them. They're fantastic!
String them into sentences and thoughts profound.
We'll abound, in a symphony of spoken sound, truth is found, beauty crowned.
In other words, words in a word are delicious!
You can taste 'em, you can treat 'em, you can waste 'em, you can 'eat em.
And digest them, I suggest them!
They're delicious!
(King Sighs) Words.
 (Music Ends Dramatically)
Azaz: Speechers, speechers. Time for speeches.
You my boy, as our guest, may speak first.
Milo (clears throat): Your Majesty, uh Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity-
Azaz (claps): Enough, next.
Tock: Soup bones, dog biscuits, porter house steak, carpet slippers.
Humbug: Roast turkey, mashed potatoes, vanilla ice cream.
Soldier L: Veal Cutlet Parmesan.
Soldier M: Eggplant Florentine.
Soldier N: Eggs goldenrod.
Soldier O: Jones sausage, "reosh."
Azaz: Pate de foie gras, soupe a l'oignon, faisan sous cloche, salade endive, fromages et fruits et demi-tasse."
(Servants Marching, 
Music in Rhythm with Chewing)
Food (whispering): Your majesty, ladies and-
Milo: But that's my speech!
I didn't know I was going to have to eat my words.
King (chewing): Of- of course you do.
That's what we're all doing.
(Chews). You, you, you should have made a tastier speech.
(Gasps). I seem to have a touch of indigestion.
Milo: Perhaps you've eaten too much too quickly.
Azaz: Too be sure, too much, too quickly.
I most certainly haven't eaten too little, too slowly.
Or too much, too slowly. Or too little, too quickly.
Or taken all day to eat nothing.
Or eaten everything in no time at all.
Milo: But wouldn't that be just as bad?
Azaz: You mean just as good.
Things which are "just as bad" also are equally good.
Try to look at the bright side of things, Milo.
Milo: I don't know what side of anything to look at. 
Everything is so confusing!
And all your words only make things worse.
Azaz: How true.
Words seem to have lost their meaning.
Milo: But there must be something you can do about it.
Couldn't you pass a law- or something?
Azaz: We have almost as many laws as we have words, but the laws don't make any sense either.
Milo: Perhaps you might allow- I mean uh, because you are a wise and -and righteous and just king, you might allow...Rhyme and- and Reason to return?
Azaz: How nice that would be...
No! No, no never!
Not while that stubborn brother of mine...
(*Gently) Things always did go very well when they were here.
(*Gruffly) I won't allow it!
Milo: Why not?
Azaz: (Gently) Why not?
(Gruffly) Why not, indeed!
Azaz: (Gently) Yes. Why not? 
My boy,
I cannot tell you how it would solve all our problems, if only you could bring back Rhyme and Reason.
Bee: Odious wasp, eh? (Bee Zooms)
Bee: Didactic Drone?
Bee: Parsimonious word miser, is it?
Azaz: Perhaps someone else among my faithful court would volunteer to join this brave boy in his efforts to rescue Rhyme and Reason?
(Music of Dismay Plays)
Azaz: No volunteers?
Bee: Insectious Humbugious, ey? We'll see.
Azaz: Wonderful! A volunteer!<br/>Congratulations.
Milo: That's great! With the Humbug's help, 
I know we can do it!
Azaz: Goodbye, my boy. Here, in this bag, <br/>are all the words and ideas I know.
With them, you may ask all the questions which <br/>have never been answered.
And answer all the questions which <br/>have never been asked.
All the great books of the past, <br/>and all the ones yet to come, are in that bag.
Go now. But remember, use these words well,<br/>and there is no obstacle you cannot overcome.
Azaz: Goodbye.
Milo/Tock: Goodbye!
Milo: And thank you. Goodbye!
Azaz: Goodbye! (Music Begins)
Humbug: Owwwwww!!!!
Milo: Wow, what a mess!
How will we ever get through that?
(Music of Confidence)
(Humbug Knocks/Kicks Wood)*
Humbug: It is of no use my lad.
The wall is absolutely impenetrable.
However, your heroic effort shall not be unrewarded. 
Our eternal gratitude will be yours.
Shall we start back?
Milo: Now look here, Mr. Humbug.
If you think for one minute that-
Dodecahedron: I say young man, what seems to be your problem?
Milo: Who are you?
Dodecahedron: My angles are many, my sides are not few. I'm the Dodecahedron, and who are you?
Milo: What's a dode-kaheadrun?
Tock: As I remember it, it's a twelve-sided mathematical shape.
Dodecahedron: See for yourself. I usually use one at a time... saves wear and tear.
By the way, what was your problem?
Milo: We have to get to Digitopolis to ask the Mathema-
Dodecahedron: The only way to get there is through the Numbers Mine.
Milo: Numbers Mine? But we can't get through there.
The entrance is blocked tight.
Tock: Milo, you remember how you got us out of the Doldrums?
Milo: Yeah, maybe we can think our way through!
Dodecahedron: Can you remember any mathematics?
Milo: Let's see. Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.
Dodecahedron: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 is known as the-
Milo: Fibonacci Series!
Dodecahedron: Vectors have both magnitude and directions...
Milo: Scalars have only magnitude!
Milo: We did it, we did it!
Humbug: (Laughs) Yes, yes.
We handled that brilliantly, my boy.
'Tis a good thing we knew the Fibonacci Series, eh?
(Laughs) Yes, ee-dee.
Milo: Golly. And I used to think numbers weren't important or valuable.
Mathemagician: Not important? Not valuable?
Humbug: It's- it's the Mathemagician.
Mathemagician: By the 4,827, 659 hairs on my head,
I'll tell you what's important.
Mathemagician (singing): You couldn't have 1 fine day without the 1, could you?
You couldn't have tea for 2 without the 2, could you?
You couldn't have 3 blind mice without the 3, so you see?
Numbers are the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-
Wonders of the World!
If you had a big plan, how would you know how big?
Numbers!
If you had a high hope, how would you know how high? 
Numbers!
If you had a deep bog, how would you know how deep?
If you had a close call, how would you know how close?
If you had a wide choice, how would you know how wide?
Numbers! Numbers! That's how!
Numbers can be decimated, verified, manipulated, carried forward, backward, and replaced.
Numbers can be added to, subtracted from, divided into, multiplied by, crossed out, and erased.
But not with words. 
You're stuck with words.
Words are things you have to keep, have to watch, have to weigh, have to mind, have to know, have to say.
(Singing) But it's amazing what a digit or two can do.
Why anything you cannot figure out, they figure out for you.
And when troubles mount and they become too much to bear.
Never Fear.
(Talking) Just divide them and divide them.
And divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, until they disappear.
Nothing counts like numbers. Numbers! 
Numbers, wonderful numbers!
Those Dewey decimal dearies, square root and mix them in series,
They give the heart inspiration, no words can bring such elation!
1 to 9, they're the most.
Pour the wine, drink a toast to-
Numbers!
(Music Ends Dramatically)
Mathemagician: Welcome to my workshop!
Humbug: Very impressive, Your Majesty.
But, could you show us the biggest number there is? <br/>Heh, heh. That will give him something to figure out.
Mathemagician: Very well, Sir Humbug.
What's the biggest number you can think of?
Humbug: 9,999,999, 000,999 and 9/10.
Mathemagician: Very good. Now add 1 to it.
Humbug: Add 1?
Mathemagician: Now add 1 to that. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 agai-
Milo: But he'd never be able to stop that way.
Mathemagician: Never. For the number you hope for is always at least one more than the one you have.
And that's so large that if you start saying it yesterday, you wouldn't finish 'til tomorrow. 
I hope that's clear to you.
Milo: Nothing's very clear to me.
Here, or in Dictionopolis.
Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Right! It's all the fault of that wretched brother of mine, King Azaz.
(Gently) Ever since the little princesses left, nothing make sense.
(Gruffly) And it's all his fault!
Milo: (clears throat) If you please sir, we'd like to rescue Rhyme and Reason.
Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Rescue Rhyme and Reason?!
(Gently) Rescue Rhyme and Reason?
What a wonderful idea!
(Gruffly) Wait, has Azaz agreed to it?
Tock: Yes sir, he has.
Mathemagician: Then I don't. We've never agreed on anything, and we never will.
Milo: And if I can prove otherwise, can we have permission to go?
Mathemagician: Of course, of course.
Milo: Very well then. Now if Azaz agrees with something, then you disagree, correct?
Mathemagician: Correct.
Milo: And anything Azaz disagrees with, you agree, is that correct?
Mathemagician: (blowing) Correct.
Milo: Then each of you agrees that he will disagree with the other, right?
Mathemagician: Right.
Milo: Then you admit that you do agree with Azaz about something. You agree about disagreeing!
(Surprised Music)
Mathemagician: I've been tricked!
Mathemagician: Again, I want to thank you for showing me how foolish and stupid I've been.
But this gift can supply you with all the numbers, theorems, equations, and mathematical ideas the world has ever known, or ever will know.
Use it well, and there is nothing it can't do for you.
Milo: Thank you!
Mathemagician: Goodbye and good luck.
Milo: Goodbye.
Mathemagician: Goodbye.
Milo: Goodbye!
Milo: Tock, look! 
Is that a demon?
Humbug: Quick, let's go back!
Tock: No, no, no. That's the man I told you about.
That's Chroma the Great.
The one sane man left in this country.
Milo: You mean the one who conducts rainbows, and sunrises and sunsets and things?
Tock: Right. We're lucky. It looks like he's ready to conduct today's sunset. Watch!

Milo: That was a very beautiful sunset, sir.
Chroma: Why, thank you my boy. 
I've only been practicing since the world began.
Sometime, I'll get it just right.
Milo: I thought it was perfect.
Chroma: You ought to see my lightning, and fireworks!
Chroma: (Yawns) Well, good night my boy.
Oh, don't forget to wake me at 5:23, for the sunrise.
Oh. I really, really must get some sleep.
Tock (loud whisper): Milo, Milo! 
Come on, we're wasting time.
Milo (loud whisper): I can't! I have to wake 
Chroma for the sunrise.
Humbug (loud whisper): Why don't you conduct the sunrise yourself, Milo?
(Humbug Laughs Menacingly to Himself)
Humbug (loud whisper): Save us a lot of time!
And you won't have to disturb Chroma- at all!
Milo: Hey, that's a great idea, I'll do it!
Tock: Why, you fool! What did you tell him to do that for? 
Do you know what trouble he can-
(Conductor's Baton Raps on Music Stand)
Tock: No, Milo. No!
(Frightening Music Begins)
Tock (slow, warped voice): Oh no.
Tock: Come on, come on! We have to get out of here <br/>before Chroma wakes up.

Milo: Now there's no sense any place. 
And it's all my fault.
Senses Taker: Names? I must have your names before you can proceed.
Milo: Well uh, this is the Humbug.
Senses Taker: Humbug.
Milo: This is Tock.
Senses Taker: Tock.
Milo: And my name is Milo. Now can we go?
Senses Taker: Milo. <br/>Ooh...I haven't had an "M" in ages.
Now then, if you'll just tell me: when you were born; where you were born; why you we born; how old you are; how old you were then; <br/>what grade you're in;
Your shoe size; shirt size; <br/>collar size; hat size; and the names and bank references of six people who can verify this information- then you can go.
Milo: What do you need all this for?
We're in a hurry.
Senses Taker: I'm the official Senses (*Census) Taker. I must have this information before I take your senses.
So now, if you will fill out in triplicate: your height; your weight; how many ice cream cones you eat in a week; how many you don't eat in a week;
Senses Taker: how many you would like-
Milo: We can't waste the time. We've got to get to the
Milo: Castle in the Air! 
Senses Taker: That does it! Now I'm going to take your sense of duty, your sense of precaution,
(Menancing Voice) and especially, your sense of direction.
Tock: Milo! The bottle of laughter! Use this bottle of laughter I got from Dr. Dischord.
He can't take away our sense of humor!

Terrible Trivium: Hello, little boy.
Milo (breathing heavily): Huh?
Terrible Trivium: Welcome to you, your faithful dog, and that handsome gentleman.
I'm so terribly happy to see all of you. <br/>But before you travel on,
I wonder if you could spare me a little time, <br/>and assist me with a few trivial tasks.
Humbug: Why of course!<br/>We're in no hurry.
Tock (whispering): Don't do it, Milo.
Milo: But Tock, we need all the friends we can get up here! Besides, it's only for a little while.
Terrible Trivium: Now young man, if you will take those exquisite tweezers, and move this pile of sand from here to here.
Milo: With these?!
Terrible Trivium: Of course.
And you sir, have the privilege of taking this delicate needle and digging a hole through this cliff.
Humbug: Why, thank you, sir! <br/>An exacting assignment, quite worthy of my talents.
I shall enjoy it to no end.
Tock (whispering): Don't be a fool, bug! <br/>I think this bird is the Terrible Tri-
Terrible Trivium: And you sir, get to take this eyedropper, and empty that well.
Milo: But these tasks don't seem very important.
Terrible Trivium: Of course they're not important.
If you always do the easy and useless jobs, you'll never have to worry about the important ones.
Humbug: Right.
Tock: Now I know who you are, <br/>you're the Terrible Trivium!
Terrible Trivium: Quite correct.
The Terrible Trivium, demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs. Ogre of wasted effort.
Milo: Come on, Humbug! Let's get outta here!

Humbug: So many nails to straighten,
Terrible Trivium: so many doodles to doodle.
Humbug: so many goofs to off.

I'll help ya! Good, good, straight ahead. <br/>Hurry! You're doing great.
Tock: Yeow!
Insincerity: Mwhahaha! Trapped ya, didn't I?
I'm the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly haired, wide-mouthed, bowlegged, big-footed monster.
And if I do say so myself, I'm one of the most dreaded fiends in the whole wide wilderness! Bwhahaha!
Humbug: It sounds like we're doomed.
Milo: "Sounds" is right.<br/>If there's one thing I've learned around here, it's that people aren't always what they say they are.
Insincerity: With awful hideous me here, you wouldn't dare try to escape. Bwhahaha!
Why I'll tear anyone apart that tries to get out of there.
For I'm the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired,<br/>wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, roundbodied, short-armed, bowlegged, big-footed monster. One false move and I'll...(looks at Milo)

I'll turn ya to hamburger, I'll- I'll,
(Discouraged) Actually, I'm the Demon of Insincerity.
I don't mean what I say. I don't mean what I do. <br/>I- I'm just mean, I guess.
Now you had to go and spoil everything!
Humbug: Well, if he's typical of the monsters around here, we have nothing to worry about.
Tock: It's the Gelatinous Giant!
Gelatinous Giant (Booming Voice): And what have we here? Aha! I see! Breakfast.
Milo: Wait! I have a better idea.
Gelatinous Giant: An Idea? Ahh. <br/>If there is one thing I can't swallow, it's an idea.
Milo: Well, it just so happens that I have a bag full of all the ideas in the world right here.
Gelatinous Giant: No. No, no, no! Don't open it! 
Leave well enough alone.
Don't take chances. <br/>Keep things as they are.
Changes are so... frightening. No...new...ideas.

Milo: The Castle in the Air. 
At last, we've made it! We've made it!

Tock: There's the Hideous Two-Faced Hypocrite.
Milo: Two-Faced Hypocrite. Hmm, let's see.
V for victory over a Two-Faced Hypocrite.
Now, if you take away the two faces, that leaves V/(h).
Forthright. This should be the answer.
All we need is a 4.
Humbug: Well done, my boy. Well done. <br/>If there's one thing I can't abide, it's a hypocrite.

Reason: Welcome, Milo, to the Castle in the Air.
Milo: But- but how do you know who I am? <br/>And I mean, are you the princesses?
Reason: Yes, my dear. <br/>This is my sister, the Princess of Sweet Rhyme.
And I am called the Princess of Pure Reason.
Rhyme: And as for knowing who you are, why- we sent for you.
Milo: Se- Sent for me?
Rhyme: Yes. You see Milo, we had to find a boy <br/>who was so bored he would go anywhere and do almost anything to get away from it all. Only such a boy could rescue us.
Reason: But he also had to have courage. And curiosity. 
And kindness. That's why we chose you.
Milo: But you don't know! I've made so many mistakes! <br/>I've messed up the whole sky and I've-
Rhyme: Never feel badly about making mistakes.
Reason: Because often you'll learn more by being wrong for the right reasons-
Rhyme: than you do by being right <br/>for the wrong reasons.
Milo: What about Tock? He's broken! Or dead, or rundown. Or whatever watchdogs do.
We've gotta help him!
Reason: We can help everyone now, Milo.
Milo: You mean now that King Azaz and the Mathemagician have agreed to disagree-
Rhyme: Yes, Milo. Now that you have helped them to understand how foolish they were to disagree at all.
Milo: But how can we get down? 
The stairway is gone!
Rhyme: I think you mean, "whether" we can get down, don't you, Milo?
Because, unless I'm mistaken, <br/>here comes your old friend the Whether Man.
Whether Man: Well now, well now, well now, if it isn't the little boy who got lost trying to find his way.
Expect everything I always say, and the unexpected never happens. Eh, but never mind that.
What you really need now is a "how," isn't it? <br/>And perhaps a- a "here" to go with it.

Oh, and it's also an excellent way of getting from one place to another.

1969 MGM Theme Plays
In the year 50 B. C. all Gaul, now known as
France, was covered with impenetrable forest... where calm peace and quite reigned supreme, only the birds...
Hey wait a moment! Wait a moment! I said the year 50 B. C!
In the year 50 B. C. all Gaul was covered with impenetrable forests, where calm peace and quite reigned supreme.
Julius Caesar after much fierce fighting had succeeded in conquering Gaul... intending to set the seal of Romans civilisation on his latest conquest.
Yes, all Gaul, now known as
France, was occupied by the Romans.
Well no not quiet, somewhere in
Armorica, a little village was... holding out against the invaders. A little village surrounded by Romans.
The brave people of this village.
Do I really need to introduce them?
Hands up in the house who hasn't met them yet.
Ah, I see all right! I'll make the introductions.
This big hut is the home of the undisputed chief of the village.
The formidable Vitalstatistix.
Darling, please darling, it's me ought to be up on that shield!
I'm the chief after all!
I've got to go out shopping, you can have your shield back later, meanwhile... you tidy the place up a bit, it's like a wild boars sty! Come on you two!
This is Cacofonix, the village bard, people don't always appreciate... his talents, sometimes express their feelings in a tactful delicate way.
Ah here comes Dogmatix, the village mascot and a great friend of Obelix.
He help him delivering menhirs.
Dogmatix, come here Dogmatix, I'm teaching him to retrieve menhirs Asterix... he could be a big help in my work.
You know Obelix it isn't that I don't think that dog's very intelligent... but I do sometimes wonder if he isn't a rather small to carry menhirs.
The voice of reason you have just heard belongs to the renowned Asterix!
The best warrior in the village! The famous Asterix whose adventures are... on sale in all the best bookshops and had been translated into every language.
Salute! Guten tag! Hello! Hi!
Konnichiwa! Buenas dia! Salam!
Bonjour!
But you may ask yourself how did this little village with its handful... of warriors manage to hold out against the all powerful Roman invaders?
Well that was thanks to the magic potion brewed up by the Druid Getafix... which gave superhuman strength to those who were lucky enough to get it.
Oh no Obelix! No! The potion has had a permanent effect on you!
You know you fell into the
Cauldron when you were a baby.
...fell into the Cauldron when you were a baby...nhanhanhay...
Oh some Romans!
Centurion, what is the point of having another go, you know what those...
Gauls will do to us. That lot is simply not human.
Maybe but those are Caesar's orders, who knows perhaps it will be... different this time. Watch there!
Form square!
Forward!
Join the army they said, it's a real man's life they said.
It didn't turn out so very different form usual did it Centurion?
No, no not very. -I know rather a good joke... post equitem sedet atra cura.
Right these Gauls will make
Latin a dead language... if Julius Caesar would insist on fighting them.
Those Gauls are simply not human
Centurion, they just are not human.
You're right, they not human, ordinary mortals could not resist... the might of the Roman army.
- I told you so.
Must be Gods, we haven't a hope to beat the Gods!
I'm going to Rome to tell
Caesar, the Gods are against us!
They're Gods, you say? This crazy
Gaulish village are Gods, that's a laugh!
But Caesar you do have to admit these Gaulish villages can keep... your army at bay. In my opinion it is time we come to adopt a... realistic approach to the situation.
Gods are against us, we're done for.
While seeking to follow a constructive line, I hope none the less to be quite... objective and I have therefore come to the following conclusion... it is no good trying to fight Gods.
Let us suppose to look on the bright side, we've only got to deal with... demi gods. Well even so, it is still an extremely unpleasant predicament.
To take an example that can be anyone willing to take on Hercules?
Hercules? Gods or Demigods! I
Caesar will show you cowardly... old counsellors that half-wits are only mortal, very mortal. Bruto!
Stop playing about that knife, you'll end up hurting somebody.
But how are you going to show us that those
Gauls aren't Gods after all, oh Caesar?
Well first I shall visit them myself and I shall put them to certain tests... which only the Gods could perform.
And if they really are
Gods then I should give in.
But if they are just men, ordinary human being, they'll have to face the anger of Caesar!
And by Jupiter I can tell you they'll finish up inside the lions of the circus!
Get that chariot and let us got ready!
I think I heard a bell going darling, will you go and see who is there?
Julius Caesar is outside and wants to see you.
Julius Caesar, the
Julius Caesar? Himself.
Right, a towel for my feet, fetch my shoes. Let everyone know Asterix!
Where are those shoe pairs gone to?
Yes I'm coming!
Leave them to me, leave them to me.
- Calm down, let the chief have a word.
Ave, village chief!
- Hail Caesar, what are you doing here?
I have come to make a suggestion.
Your defiance of me is bad for my reputation!
In Rome they're starting to laugh at me.
They are saying a bunch of half wits... can hold the Roman army at bay.
- Really, watch your language you...
But some people say you must be Gods.
Gods?
- Us Gods?
Yes Gods and if that is so then I will admit defeat.
But if you are only men... then you will have to give in into my power and accept our laws.
And how are me and my friends supposed to prove if we are really Gods?
I wonder if you have heard of Hercules?
- Hercules the grocer?
No, no, the God Hercules! He performed
12 difficult task with goddessment meet it to olimpus
It's seen the god saw that he must be one of them
These 12 tasks what were they?
He strangled the Nemean Lion, killed the
Lernian Hydra. Caught the Elymanthian... boar alive. Hunted down the stag
Cerynean, shot the Stymphalian... birds with his bow. Tamed the bull on the Island of Crete, Killed Diomedes... conquered the Amazons, cleaned the
Augean stables in a day, killed Geryon... stole the golden apples of the
Hesperides set Theseus free from Haydees.
And you want us to do all these daft things to show weather or not we're God?
No not exactly that's all a bit out of date now, I set up a new set of tasks.
Only Gods could hope to perform all of them and if you succeed I blow... myself fairly deep but if you fail in even one then you will have to give in. It's a Deal?
You bet your life it's a deal.
- Yes yes!
Right, These tasks will take you to Rome, Caius Pocus!
He will act as your guide along the way and see that the tasks are fairly... performed. He's the most trustworthy man and very honest.
So, if you should succeed, Rome will surrender, if you fail in a single task... then you will all become slaves of Rome.
Okay we'll have it done.
- Ave!
You really think Caesar would surrender and let you become masters of Rome?
Come to think of it perhaps we got a bit carried away.
Oh, your magic potion will help us out Druid.
Sure we'll have lots of fun by Tutatis!
Lots of fun!
- Asterix is the cleverest man among us.
Obelix is the strongest, so you two are the only ones who can succeed.
May Tutatis hear you.
Here is a gourd full of magic potion, mind you use it well.
You're going to need it!
Well then, are we on?
- We're off.
It's funny I wonder why Cacofonix hasn't shown up to sing us a farewell song.
Hi, now for the first task, follow me, will you please?
This is Aspestos just back from Marathon, he was champion runner at the Olympic Games...
He can run faster than a horse, faster than the stone wind that howls through the trees.
One of you will have to beat him in a race.
You'll do it Asterix!
You're faster than me, faster than a horse wind howling through the trees.
All right. We'll be waiting for you on the other side of the forest.
At the finishing line. Start when all the sand has run out of the hour glass.
Well fancy that, you are a real Olympic champion, that's very interesting.
We have athletics in the village too, but obviously as we all get some... of the magic potion it is not very exciting.
Are you listening to me? Right I was saying it's not very interesting because... we all get there at once and we have to draw lots with the winner.
You notice that I don't need to drink any magic potion because I'm very fast.
I say, you are not very chatty are you?
Hey wait for me!
I think I'd better take a little potion the village's future is at stake.
Hey there, not a bad start, you really took me by surprise!
I got a held up back there in the forest because I stopped to pick mushrooms.
You see? I like picking flowers too.
Look aren't they beautiful?
If you like apples I know a good place over there where there is a good tree.
Funny, the race has improved his profile.
That seems to be the first of your tasks performed quite successfully.
So now for the next one.
Kermes the Persian, the most amazing javelin thrower the world has ever seen.
His javelin has crossed oceans and seas, this is your second task.
Throw javelin further than Kermes.
War! This means war!
Now this time Asterix, let me!
All right! But throw it as far as you can.
Just you watch!
Second task performed, and now for the next one.
You are going to play
Silindric the German.
No wrestler or gladiator has ever beaten him.
Silindric the German'll come in that way, you must wait for him here.
Look at the size of those gates, he must be big Silindric the German.
Yes I like them big and strong.
That's him! Silindric the German?
- Why he isn't big at all!
I like them big, hey suppose we give him some magic potion?
Good day, which of you two gentleman is first or both of you at once maybe ja?
I'll go first and finish him off at once and then we go on to the next task.
All right but watch out, there must be a catch; he's got some funny clothes on.
No the robes don't make the druid!
Oh the fat gentleman first. ja
- I am not fat!
Yeah very well the fat one first.
- Listen you!
I say what a splendid way to fight;
I've never seen anything like it.
Ah ja I have learned it on my travels, long long travels far away.
You would like to have a go ja?
- Ja, yes sorry.
It's easy you have only to use the man's own strength to get them down.
The stronger he is the better for you.
Easy, easy you just say that because you're strong.
Nein, nein, word of honour, try yourself, here take my hand.
Put your foot right on the stomach, then raise backward, bend down.
Ja ja, harder harder!
Like this?
- Ja ja, you get the idea, ja ja.
Ja well done! Harder!
That's it!
- Was it really good?
Very good but a little bit soft ja. Lets do the next thing.
When you have got me on the ground, you take the advantage that I'm a little... dizzy and you jump on me, ja.
Like that?
- Gut! You take hold of my arm like this.
And then you pull, you tie a knot, gut! And then the other arm.
Excellent! And what will you think of next? The legs!
Right leg, wunderbar, left leg. Fantastic!
And now you can see I can't move at all, why you have beaten me, mein her!
They have got through the first two tasks all right, not bad but it proves nothing.
Rome is not Gaulish yet.
They've not had much to prove so far, now however the next task!
They will have to face the princesses of the Isle of Pleasure.
I never knew there was a lake here.
Well there is and you have to get across it that's your next task.
I shall go and wait on the other side.
Of course it's inconceivable you... should succeed, there is a boat over there, bon voyage.
I call this test a piece of cake.
We'll reach the other side in no time.
We'd better be careful though, you never can tell.
The lake is calm and the boat doesn't seem to leak.
Oh they sing better than Cacofonix.
Welcome to the isle of pleasure, we were expecting you, this way.
Nice little place you've got but who are you?
Never mind who we are, bold one give yourself up to pleasure.
This way we're going to show you all over our island.
And now you've seen our island, the island you will never leave again.
Your lightest wish will be our command. forever and ever.
What would you like oh warrior?
Some food.
- Some food?
Why not, I'm starved, dancing out in the open makes me hungry.
You're here on the isle of pleasure and the chief priestess herself has asked... what you would like and you ask for food?
Of course eating is a great pleasure.
This is the island pleasure isn't it?
All right we can provide nectar and Ambrosia.
Nectar, no fear, no fear, no none of that boring old stuff!
I want a nice wild boar, wild boar is very tasty.
You call nectar and Ambrosia boring?
Why that is food for the Gods themselves.
Well...Are you Gods or aren't you?
Well I suppose we may be
Gods but we eat wild boar.
But there aren't any wild boar on this island.
What! There aren't any boar
And you expect me to stay with you for good? You must be off your head!
Get lost fatty, do you really think I would lower myself to do your cooking?
And the washing up too.
- And housework!
And clean you shoes!
- Push off, get out!
You bet your life I'll get out, they have no wild boar and they dare to call... this the isle of pleasure! Come on
Asterix, there's nothing here for us.
Never mind him, we'll give you pleasure such as the Gods enjoy... on Olympus oh warrior.
Asterix!
The next task will take place in that temple.
What do we have to do in there?
- You will be required to look deep... into the dreaded eyes of the
Iris, the great Egyptian magician.
By Osiris and by Apis, look at me, look into my eye!
You have turned into a cat! By
Osiris and Apis, a cat. That's right!
By Osiris and by Apis there's a dear pussy cat, off you go little pussy cat.
Next please.
By Osiris and by Apis, look into my eyes, you have turned into a bird.
Yes a bird by Osiris and by Apis, a bird!
You saw that?
- Yes he was flying low, we'll have rain.
Next!
What is all this about? Yes I remember now, and which one of you is to... undergo my pleasure treatment? Sorry to rush you, my appointment book is very full.
I'll have a go.
- All right, seat yourself just there.
Ready then? I'll begin.
By Osiris and by Apis look at me! Look!
How do you do all that with your eyes?
Silence, concentrate please! By Osiris and by Apis look at me, look in my eyes!
By Osiris and by Apis you have turned into a... in what?
A wild boar! You Gauls are very fond of wild boar.
Lets start again. By Osiris and by Apis look in my eyes!
You have turned into a wild boar!
- Can you light one of them up at a time?
I'm Concentrating!
Where was I? A wild boar.
You are wild boar! A wild boar. do you hear? A wild boar.
Must be very useful for reading in bed.
Silence. I have to start again.
You are a wild boar, by Apirsi and by Osaris a boar, by the Usaris.
By Opis oh mama! You repeat after me: I am a wild boar,
I am a wild boar.
You are a wild boar; you are a wild boar.
- That's right. I am a wild boar.
I am a wild boar. A wild boar!
Iris made me hungry going on about wild boar.
What's more it's lunchtime.
Well that's lucky because your next task will be to eat every morsel... of a meal prepared for you by Mannechenpix.
The great chef of the Titans.
No mortal man has ever got through one of his enormous meals!
But you will have to eat it all down to the last crumb. Bon apetit.
An interesting kind of task at last, it's my turn now, right?
No doubt about that.
You are expected monsieur, sit down and I'll be bringing the banquet!
What's this?
- Ah this I have invented myself!
These are ruts that grow in the ground, I hope you'll like them.
The Geese! This is good because they are fat!
The nice mutton platter!
Made for the hungry wolf!
The titanic omelette! Eight dozen eggs!
The whole school of fish, that teaches you what is like to eat well!
The ox, look at him he will melt in your mouth!
This cow might not be as tasty but is much more delicate!
The veal, because to separate the family that would not be right.
A whole thing of caviar, large kind and there is more.
Here is a piece of toast to go with it.
The camel, this you will like, and it has a good stuffing too.
And before we start on the next course The elephant with olives!
Did he eat everything?
- Yes he ate everything!
I have nothing left in my kitchen!
Oh God, I will have to shut my shop!
Did anyone see which way the chef went?
He walked out, I just had the starters!
What on earth is all this?
What's up with you my fellow dressing in that awfully silly way?
It's not silly! I've got to get ready to be ruler or Rome, haven't I?
Ruler of Rome, well honestly.
When my lads have won all their tasks we'll be setting off for Rome.
For Rome? Do you really think
Rome will ever be Gaulish?
I think you are counting your wild boar piglets before they are hatched.
You think so?
- Yes, why don't you all go home?!
That's right, run along, leave us alone!
You don't think they will win?
- Caesar is mighty, he has made a pact... with the powers of darkness and only the Gods know what dreadful... dangers Asterix and Obelix may still have to face.
And now you must go inside the cave of the beast.
The cave of the beast? And what is this beast like?
I have no idea, no one has ever come out alive.
Well nice to have known you.
Coming Obelix? - Why not?
The place looks quite interesting.
How many then?
- EH? Two.
Watch out there, get down!
Hey Asterix...
- Yes I know we shall have rain with the birds fly low.
- Not really!
We can kept nice and dry inside this cave.
Fifteen all.
Excuse me please sir, are we right for the beast?
Look you might at least answer when I ask a question.
Beastly aren't they?
If they think they can frighten us, they are wrong, because everyone knows... that we fear only one thing frighten us and that is the sky falling on our heads.
Shhhh! Watch out.
What might that be?
- I have no idea, but I am really... getting rather fed up, we seem to have been in this cave quite some time.
Come to think of it what is the time?
- It's about twelve noon.
Are you hungry again already?
- Why shouldn't I be hungry?
I'm always hungry at twelve noon, I could eat anything at all!
You hear me? Absolutely anything
Shut up! Listen!
The Beast!
I hope you will forgive my curiosity, but the beast, what was it like actually?
Very tasty, waiter I'd like a drink.
We've only got lemonade.
Those people seem very odd by Tutatis!
They've all been to the place that sends you mad.
The place that sends you mad?
Yes and you'll have to go in there as well, that's your next task.
What do we have to do in this place?
- Oh nothing much!
You have to obtain a certain permit which will allow you to the next task.
I see nothing but a simple administrative formality.
Right, a formality, a simple formality you have to ask for permit number 838.
All right. Obelix!
What is it?
- We want a copy of permit number 838.
If you want to register a galley, you have to ask at the harbour masters office.
We don't want to register a galley, we want a copy of permit number 838.
At the port, it's down at the other side of town, it's down by the seaside.
We don't want to go to the port, we want a copy of permit number 838.
Eh?
- Permit number 838!
There's no need to shout, where do you think you are, by Jupiter!
Apply at window number one, left hand corridor, last door on the right, got it?
Last door on the right?
- Last door on the right?
There is no door on the right!
- Oh he must have got it wrong.
Lets try the door opposite.
And who gave you permission to come into my office?
We're looking for window number one.
- Consult the map on the 6'th floor.
Close the door. Impertinent!
Now where were we Miss?
These stairs are pretty steep.
Carry on.
This one?
- No this is the 4'th we want the 6'th.
Ah this is the plan.
- Can't make it out at all.
Window number one is on the ground floor, last corridor on the right.
What is your business?
- We want a copy of permit number 838.
You have been misdirected, you have to apply at window number 2.
Next door to this one?
- No that one is window 8.
You'd better ask at the front desk.
Where is window number 2?
- I've already told where the port is!
I don't want the port, I've told you!
- Now gentlemen calm down.
Someone is trying to work, and what is the problem may I ask?
I have no idea Mr. Prefect, they keep jabbering a lot of nonsense.
We are looking for window 2.
Window 2, where exactly did they put that one?
Last time anyone saw it, it was on the
3'ed floor, corridor B door 6. Mr Prefect!
There you are gentleman, there was nothing to be getting so worked up about.
We seem to be getting somewhere now.
- Mmmm, I'm not all that confident.
She bought some material from a
Phoenician trader for her cubiculum.
But how strange, how odd!
- She's the kind whose always got to... show off, she can't even afford a slave!
- Miss...
She says she preferred to do her house work herself!
I know her husband's financial situation.
- Excuse me...
Oh can't you see I'm busy, where was I?
- The financial situation.
Oh poor Claudius, you know he worked up a nice little business building viaducts.
Excuse me Miss!
- Would you mind?
Permit number 838!
- Have you filled in a blue form?
A blue form? No! -How do you think to get permit 838?
Where can I get hold of a blue form?
- Window one.
I've been there!
- That's right, that viaduct at the... first gust of wind crashed.
- Did it collapse?
Nothing left but some ruins. Still they look picturesque in the country.
She's at lunch but you could apply at window 35, ask downstairs.
Can't you get it right?
Fill in this form then you'll be able to get the pink form.
What pink form?
- The one you need in order to get... permit 838, window 12, second floor staircase B, corridor J.
You need the yellow form, window 7 on 5'th floor, staircase K corridor W.
Get the green window 14 on the first floor, staircase F, corridor T.
Get the blue form, window 36,
6th floor, staircase B corridor F.
Get the yellow form, window corridor staircase five...
Stop it!
Calm down Obelix, Clam down!
We will never get out of here Asterix, the magic potion won't be any help to us.
We will go mad and we'll be Julius Caesar's slaves.
Not if I know it, it's true the magic potion won't help us but I know what.
I can fight them with their own weapons, you watch this.
Is this where I get permit 839?
Don't you mean permit 838? For 838 you
- No no what I need is permit 839.
In the new circular B65? Wait here. Ever heard of circular B65?
Circular B65?
- The one about permit 839
Not me, we shall have to find out from the head of filing systems of... material not get coordinated.
- It's on the 5'th floor, staircase Z.
The office has moved to the second floor staircase H corridor N, shall we go?
Yes come on.
Circular B65, about permit 839? No.
The messenger of new circular or provisional material must have... forgotten to let us know. They are on ground floor, staircase 2 corridor U.
What a new circular? Go to supervisor of planning and new material.
Where is he? Lets go and ask down at the desk.
Calm down, quiet, quiet!
- Please sir...
I'm very busy just now, what are you after?
Permit number 838!
All right, and kindly leave some people here are trying to work.!
Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant.
Yes Caesar, they have performed them all, even that last task.
Hercules himself would have failed that.
Well, I must admit they are remarkable but they haven't yet got to Rome.
I have 7 special treats in stall for them, there is no need to worry, By Mercury!
We shan't be seeing a little Gaulish village becoming the capital... of the Roman world! We can proceed with the rehearsal now.
Well oh Caesar I guess the rehearsal is just about over.
Let's see what's next on the list,
You'll have to cross this canyon.
Walk across that invisible thread that you do not see there.
Walk along an invisible thread?
Why don't we cross down below it's just a small river and the water looks calm.
Yes but in fact that little river is full of crocodiles.
Lots of sacred crocodiles, they were a present given to Caesar... by the Egyptian head of state, Queen Cleopatra.
They are very savage creatures and very voracious.
Yes I don't like crocodiles, I tried them once, They were stringy.
Come on Asterix!
Oh all right, I suppose we should have to. Are you coming?
You start, I'll follow
Here we go!
Your next tasks is to make the ascent of this mountain.
A the top you must look for the old man of the mountains.
And what do we have to do with this old man of the mountains?
The old man of the mountains will ask a difficult riddle.
You will have to answer it correctly if you get it wrong the results... will be quite fatal, I mean as far as you are concerned of course.
Why can't this old man come down here to ask his riddle?
Come on don't be a lazy bones! Here we go!
There must be a marvellous view from up here.
Here I've run out of mountain side.
That's because you've got to the top, the old man can't be far away.
Would you be the old man of the mountain, old man?
I am the old man of the mountain, have you miserable mortals... come to ask for the riddle?
Well I'm glad we haven't been climbing the wrong mountain.
Come on ask your riddle old man of the mountains, it's not very warm up here.
One moment, do you know foolish men that if you fail to give me... the right answer, you will be banished into the eternal depths of hell?
After climbing all this way, not likely, I've got better things to do.
Come on, the riddle.
So be it oh mortals, follow me. Ow my back!
You ought to take a trip to the seaside, it'll do you good.
Oh you presumptuous mortals, one of you, eyes blind folded by me... but there is still time to go back.
Oh go on, ask your riddle.
One of you will have to tell me which of these two piles of laundry... has been washed with
Olympus, the Gods detergent.
This one, it's silkier, got that.
Yes, you've got it right! Sure enough this pile is much softer, much gentler.
Much whiter, the gods do their washing with Olympus which washes whiter... and leaves your hands much softer.
Holy Gods did you hear that? This mortal has given the right answer.
Holy Gods did you hear that.?
All right we can all hear you.
- Those Gauls lads are pretty good.
You must admit Olympus really does wash whiter and leaves your hands soft.
Ok we get the idea!
- You military men.
Silence, by me!
- But listen oh Jupiter, do these Gauls... who are doing so well, get a place up here too?
We're rather short of space as it is.
- Quiet! We don't let all and sundry... blight our path and to be honest
I'm getting fed up with them!
Rome's over there, not far away, but before you're allowed inside you have...
Spend the night on this plane? Ah good idea!
I feel a bit tired after those tasks, I need a sleep.
Yes but I must warn you that all those who have dared to spend the night... here before you have died of fear. it is called the plane of departed spirits.
Well good night! If that's the right expression.
What do you suppose happens on this plane?
I don't know and I don't care.
We must be fit and well tomorrow to enter Rome to tackle our last task.
Lets go to sleep now.
There's no need to go further, we'll be all right here.
Are you sure?
- Good night Obelix.
Good night Asterix.
Fall in!
Good some Romans! All those Roman just for me!
Forward march!
Don't make so much noise, you'll wake up Mr. Asterix.
Form a triangle!
A heart!
A diamond A spade!
A cubs
Away!
I'll chop off your head poor mortal, we are departed spirits, were ghosts!
Trapped on this cursed battle field where we were massacred because... of the queen and her men and now at this witching hour we take revenge... by making all those who dare to spend the night here die of fear.
What's going on around here?
What's all this row about?
Please Asterix don't be angry, they're only trying to keep their spirits up because they got parted by some witches and mad men.
No you've gone and got it all wrong,
I'll explain it, we are departed spirits.
I couldn't care less who you are, do you know what the times is?
Yes, no do please listen.
- No you can listen to me!
We've run a big race, we've been throwing the javelin, we've been wrestling... we've been how to face the princesses, magicians,
Big beasts, crocodiles, we need a good nights sleep!
You can keep your spirits up but kindless don't keep us up.
I'm sorry you must excuse him.
- Obelix come here.
Oh do listen we're only ghosts!
Quiet!
Get up you are expected.
But where are we?
You're in Rome outside Julius Caesar's palace, Caesar is expecting you.
There is something funny going on here.
The Romans have learnt to build very fast.
What does it matter? Come on then soldier take us to your leader.
Well here you are in Rome at last.
- Yes here we are Julius.
Caius has told me all about you journey.
Yes oh Caesar, they have managed to perform all talks. overcome all problems and succeeded every time.
The Gods have kept you alive, this is where your luck runs out.
It is impossible for you to become masters of Rome!
The last task will be the toughest!
Where you will be massacred.
Aa well as the other
Gauls from your village.
Here we are everyone.
Ah so this is Rome. frankly I'm disappointed.
I think the time has come to play you a little music.
Geriatrics!
Caesar, the Gauls request an audience.
It's the lads.
Here they are
- Look they've all come, Dogmatix.
Say you Gauls! Quiet!
Do you know where you are?
Silence! Silence I say! Silence!
You are all to be slaughtered for the amusement of my people!
And then nothing at all, nothing will cast a shadow on my triumph. Guards!
Well then, well then, which one is it?
That ones for the gladiators, that ones... for the ones with nets, that ones for
Fulvia, I wonder what's she's doing... in there, this one for the lions.
- I'll be happy to lend you a hand.
Caesar's just arrived!
- What a great big crowd!
Roll up everyone, it's ready!
It's the magic potion and I can't have any.
Will the owner of the cart parked in front of thermae, remove it?
Quickly cause is causing obstruction!
I hope everything is ready.
- Yes, Caesar, just to start, these... unhappy Gauls will have to face the fiercest of our Gladiators and if there're... any survivors, we will have to let out the wild beasts, we have lions, tigers... panthers and bears and elephants the audience will love this programme!
All right, you can bring out the gladiators.
Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant.
I think we should all get ready, it will soon be our turn.
Good I'm going in first and you all follow me and keep in line please.
We've got lots of people watching us so lets show some dignity.
And why should you go first?
- I'm your chief, that's why!
But we've been doing all the work haven't we Asterix?
So it's our turn to have some fun now.
- Some people get all the luck.
Who asked you?
- You stupid!
Who said stupid?
- Everyone stand back!
See my foot here?
We've been working hard and the stupid
- Stupid yourself fatty!
Oh Asterix he called me fatty!
You can let the Gauls out now.
Leave them to me! Leave them to me!
- No we won't! No we won't!
I'll smack your face!
- You Just try it!
I will!
- Go one, you just try!
Oh run away!
Let me have one! let me have one!
Oh hello!
- Hello!
I've won one!
- You won what?
Up here! Up here!
Pass him! Pass him to me!
Ow, I've injured myself!
Jolly good, jolly good, that's right!
- Oh yes? Take this!
Pass it on!
Aw who threw that pie at me? Who threw that pie?
Come on! Who did it?
Wild beasts, bring on the wild beasts!
Oh they are making the children laugh!
They ruined the circus!
Stop that! Will you stop!
You Gauls, You performed all 12 tasks
I set you, you've succeeded in every... one of the difficult tasks which I made up for you so you must be Gods.
It's no good trying to fight against
Gods, You are our new masters!
I leave my fate and that of
Rome entirely in your hands.
With great magnanimity the Gauls allowed Julius Caesar to retire to a... little country villa to live there in peace and quiet far from the... responsibility of the past.
Julius your dinner is ready!
What a really wonderful cook you are Cleopatra dear!
As for our friend Caius he was allowed to choose his won reward... for his good and faithful service.
And at last, back in Gaul, in the little village which is now the centre... of the known world, our friends reunited celebrated their return with a... banquet under the stars.
Have we really become the masters of Rome?
Lets face it this is only a cartoon film, and anything goes!
Anything goes!
[ Man ] You know, there's been a heap of legends and tall tales... about Robin Hood.
All different too.
Well, we folks of the animal kingdom have our own version.
It's the story of what really happened in Sherwood Forest.
[ Whistling ]
[ Imitates Trumpet ]
[ Scatting ]
[ Rooster Laughing ]
[ Whistling ]
[ Whistling, Imitating Trumpet ]
[ Whistling ]
Oh, incidentally,
I'm Allan-a-Dale, a minstrel.
That's an early-day folk singer.
And my job is to... tell it like it is.
Or was or whatever.
Robin Hood and Little John walkin' through the forest
Laughin' back and forth at what the other'n has to say
Reminiscin' this 'n' that and havin' such a good time
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Never ever thinkin' there was danger in the water
They were drinkin'
They just guzzled it down
Never dreamin' that a schemin' sheriff and his posse
Was a-watchin' them and gatherin' around
Robin Hood and Little John runnin' through the forest
Jumpin' fences, dodgin' trees and tryin' to get away
Contemplatin' nothin' but escapin' and finally makin' it
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
You know something, Robin?
You're taking too many chances.
Chances?
You must be joking.
That was just a bit of a lark, Little John.
Yeah?
Take a look at your hat.
That's not a candle on a cake.
Hello. This one almost had my name on it, didn't it?
They're getting better, you know.
You've got to admit it.
They are getting better.
Huh, yeah. The next time that sheriff'll probably have a rope around our necks.
[ Gagging ] Pretty hard to laugh hangin' there, Rob.
Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse couldn't lift you off the ground.
- En garde!
- Hey, watch it, Rob.
That's the only hat I've got.
Oh, come along.
You worry too much, old boy.
You know something, Robin?
I was just wonderin'.
Are we good guys or bad guys?
You know. I mean, uh, our robbin' the rich to feed the poor.
"Rob"?
[ Clicking Tongue ]
That's a naughty word.
We never rob.
We just... sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.
Borrow? Huh.
Boy, are we in debt.
[ Trumpet Sounding ]
[ Chuckling ]
That sounds like another collection day for the poor. Eh, Johnny boy?
Yeah. Sweet charity.
Taxes!
[ Laughs ] Taxes!
Beautiful, lovely taxes!
[ Laughing ]
Sire, you have an absolute skill... for encouraging contributions from the poor. [ Chuckling ]
To coin a phrase, my dear counselor, rob the poor to feed the rich.
- [ Laughing ] Am I right?
- [ Laughing ]
Tell me, what is the next stop, Sir Hiss?
Uh, let me see.
Uh, I--
Oh! Yes.
The next stop is Nottingham, sire.
Oh! The richest plum of them all.
Notting--
[ Laughs ] ham.
A perfect fit, sire.
Most becoming.
You look regal, dignified, sincere, masterful, noble, chival--
Uh, uh, don't, don't overdo it, Hiss.
There. That,
I believe, does it.
This crown gives me a feeling of power! Power!
Forgive me a cruel chuckle.
[ Laughing ]
Power. Hmm.
And how well King Richard's crown sits on your noble brow.
Doesn't it?
Uh, King Richard?
I've told you never to mention my brother's name!
A-A mere slip of the forked tongue, Your Majesty.
We're in this plot together, if you don't mind my saying so.
And remember, it was your idea
I hypnotized him and--
I know. And sent him off on that crazy crusade.
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ] Much to the sorrow of the Queen Mother.
Yes! Mother.
Mother always did like Richard best.
Your Highness, please don't do that.
If you don't mind my saying so, you see, you have a very loud thumb.
Hypnotism could rid you of your... psychosis... so... easily.
No! None of that!
None of that.
- Well, I was only trying to help.
- [ Laughs ]
I wonder.
Silly serpent.
- "Silly serpent"?
- Now look here.
One more hiss out of you,
[ Stammering ] Hiss, and you are walking to Nottingham.
Snakes don't walk.
They slither.
Hmpf. So there.
- [ Trumpeting ]
- [ Drumroll ]
Now what about that for luck?
It's only a circus. A peanut operation.
"Peanuts"? Why, you dunce.
That's the royal coach.
- It's Prince John himself.
- The prince?
Wait a minute.
There's a law against robbin' royalty.
- I'll catch you later.
- What?
And miss this chance to perform before royalty?
Ah! Here we go again.
Oo-de-lally!
Oo-de-lally!
Fortune-tellers!
Fortunes forecast!
Lucky charms!
Get the dope with your horoscope.
Fortune-tellers! How droll.
Uh, stop the coach.
Sire, sire, they may be bandits.
Oh, poppycock.
Female bandits?
What next? Rubbish.
[ Chuckling ]
Um, um, my dear ladies, you have my permission to kiss the royal hands.
Whichever you like, first.
Mmm! Oh!
How gracious!
- And generous.
- [ Gasping ] Sire! Sire!
- Did you see what they--
- Stop! [ Laughing ]
Stop hissing in my ear.
- [ Stammering ]
- Ah! [ Laughs ]
Hiss! Oh, you've hissed your last--
- [ Gagging ]
- hiss.
[ Gulping ]
Suspicious snake.
Masterfully done,
Your Excellency.
[ Chuckling ]
Now close your eyes... and concentrate.
Close your eyes. Tight shut.
No peeking, sire.
[ Chuckling ]
From the mists of time, come forth, spirits.
Yoo-hoo!
Okay, little fireflies.
Glow, babies, glow.
[ Robin ]
We're waiting. [ Chuckling ]
Ah, oh!
Look, sire. Look!
Oh! Incredible.
Floating spirits.
Ah, oh!
[ Chuckling ]
Naughty, naughty.
You mustn't touch, young man.
Oh, how dare you strike the royal hand.
Shh! You'll break the spell.
Just gaze into the crystal ball.
Oo-de-lally!
Oo-de-lal-- Oh!
A face appears.
[ Gasping ]
- A crown is on his noble brow.
- Oo-de-lally!
A crown!
How exciting!
His face is handsome, regal, majestic, loveable, a cuddly face.
Handsome, regal, oh!
Majestic.
Loveable. Yes, yes.
Cuddly.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, that's me to a "T."
It really is. Yes.
- I-- [ Laughs ]
- Now what?
[ Gasps, Chuckles ]
I, uh--
I see, um, your illustrious name.
I know my name!
Get on with it!
Your name will go down, down, down, in history, of course.
Yes! I knew it!
I knew it!
Do you hear that, Hiss?
Oh, you-- [ Mumbling ]
He's in the basket.
Don--
Don't forget it.
Hmm.
What have we here?
Solid-gold hubcaps.
Oo-de-lally.
The jackpot.
[ Wolf Whistle ]
- [ Laughing ]
- Robbed! I've been robbed!
Hiss! You're never around when I need you!
- Ahem. I've been robbed.
- Of course you've been robbed!
[ Robin ]
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally!
Fortunes forecast.
Lucky charms.
After them, you fools!
[ Crying ]
No, no, no, no!
I knew it. I knew it.
I just knew this would happen.
I tried to warn you, but, no.
You wouldn't listen. You just had to--
Ah, ah, ah!
Seven years' bad--
Ooh! Luck.
That's what it is.
Besides, you broke your mother's mirror.
[ Wailing ]
Mommy!
I've got a dirty thumb.
[ Chuckling ]
Well, even though Prince John... offered a huge reward for the capture of Robin Hood, that elusive rogue kept right on robbin' the rich to feed the poor.
And believe me, it's a good thing he did,
'cause what with taxes and all, the poor folks of Nottingham were starvin' to death.
Uh-oh. Here comes old bad news himself, the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham.
Every town
Has its taxes too
And the taxes is due
Do do-do do do
Well, lookie there.
[ Chuckles ]
Friar Tuck, the old do-gooder.
He's out doin' good again.
- Well, good mornin', Friar Tuck.
- Shh, Otto.
Shh! For you, Otto, from Robin Hood.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, God bless Robin Hood.
Do do do do-do do dee do do-do
[ Friar Tuck ] It's the sheriff!
Hurry, hide it! Quick!
Here I come.
Ready or not.
Well, greetings from your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Oh, take it easy on me, Sheriff, w-what with this busted leg and all, you know.
I-I'm way behind in me work, Sheriff.
I know, Otto, but you're way behind with your taxes too.
Oh, have a heart, Sheriff.
Can't you see he's laid up?
Come on, Otto.
You'd better sit down and rest.
- [ Coins Jangling ]
- Oh, thank you. Yes.
Let me give you a hand with that leg.
Upsa-daisy.
Upsa-daisy. Bingo!
Ah, what they won't think of next.
[ Groaning ]
It smarts, don't it, Otto?
But Prince John says that taxes should hurt.
Now see here, you-- you evil, flint-hearted leech!
Now, now, now, now!
Save your sermon, preacher.
It ain't Sunday, you know.
[ Chuckles ]
Do do do-do do
They call me a slob, but I do my job
Do do do-do do
[ Children ]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Skippy
Happy birthday
To you
Well, now, sonny, that box is done up right pretty, ain't it?
Well, Mr. Sheriff, sir, it's my birthday present, sir.
It sure is.
Why don't you open it?
Oh, boy!
One whole farthing!
Have you no heart? We all scrimped and saved to give it to him.
Now that's mighty "thoughty" of you, "widder" woman.
The family that saves together pays together.
Oh, now, don't take it so hard, sonny.
Prince John wishes you a happy birthday too.
Alms, alms, alms for the poor.
Hmm. Well.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [ Gasps ]
Well, so far it's been a cheerful morning. Keep savin'!
What a dirty trick.
You poor old man.
[ Chuckles ]
Do come in.
Come in and rest yourself.
Thank ye kindly, Mother.
Thank ye.
Tell me now. Did me old ears hear someone singin' a birthday ditty?
[ Sniffling ]
Yes, sir.
And that mean old sheriff took my birthday present.
Did he now?
But be a stouthearted little lad, and don't let it get ya down.
Gee whiz!
It's Robin Hood!
Happy birthday, son!
Oh, he's so handsome, just like his reward posters.
Tell me, young man, how old are you today?
Gosh, I'm seven years old, goin' on eight.
Seven? Well, that does make you the man of the house, and I've got just the right present for you.
For me?
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Robin Hood, sir.
Hey, how do I look?
Huh?
Not much like Mr. Robin Hood.
She's right.
There is something missing.
[ Gasps ]
Of course!
There you go.
Boy, oh, boy.
Now how do I look?
[ Giggling ]
The hat's too big.
Shh!
Mind your manners.
Yes, mind your "mattles."
[ Chuckling ] Don't worry.
You'll grow into it, young man.
Oo-de-lally!
I'm gonna try it out.
Good-bye, Mr. Robin Hood!
Come again on my birthday!
[ Laughs ]
Oh, you have made his birthday a wonderful one.
How can I ever thank you?
I only wish
I could do more.
Here.
And keep your chin up.
Someday there'll be happiness again in Nottingham. You'll see.
Oh, Robin Hood.
You've risked so much to keep our hopes alive.
Bless you. Bless you.
Gee, did Robin Hood really give it to you?
Yeah, and this is his own hat too.
Gee, I'd sure like to shoot your bow and arrow.
- Let me try it, Skippy.
- Oh, no, you don't?
I'm gonna shoot it first.
You're pointin' it too high.
I'm not either.
Watch this.
Uh-oh.
Now you done it.
Right in
Prince John’s backyard.
Skippy, you can't go in there.
Yeah. Prince John will chop off your head.
Like this.
Oh, I don't care.
I gotta get my arrow.
[ Girl ] Wait a minute.
Toby might tattle on you.
- [ Skippy ] Yeah, Toby.
You gotta take the oath.
- An oath?
Put your hand on your heart and cross your eyes.
Spiders, snakes and a lizard head.
Spiders, snakes and a lizard's head.
If I tattletale,
I'll die till I'm dead.
If I tattletale,
I'll die till I'm dead.
[ Women Giggling ]
- It's your turn to serve, Marian dear.
- Are you ready, Lady Kluck?
Oh, as your lady-in-waiting,
I'm waiting.
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Laughing ]
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Klucky, that was a good shot.
You're not bad yourself, dear.
Oh, my girdle's killing me. [ Laughs ]
Where is it?
Did you lose it?
- It must be in there someplace.
- Oh, Klucky, you look so silly.
- [ Women Giggling ]
- Oh, look. There it is behind you.
Oh!
Well, hello.
- Where did you come from?
- Oh, please don't tell Prince John.
Mama said he'll chop off my head.
Oh, don't be afraid.
You've done nothing wrong.
Oh, Marian, what a bonny wee bunny.
Who does this young archer remind you of?
Well, upon my word, the notorious Robin Hood.
That's right. Only Robin Hood wears a hat like that.
Yeah, and look at this keen
Robin Hood bow.
[ Sneezes ]
Oh, Marian, don't look around, but I do believe we're surrounded.
- Oh, mercy!
- He snitched on us.
It's all right, children.
Don't be afraid. Please come here.
- Do you think it's safe?
- That's Maid Marian.
Mama said she's awful nice.
Come on!
Hey, you guys, not so fast.
Wait for me.
I told Skippy he was shooting too high.
I'm so very glad he did.
Now I get to meet all of you.
- Gee, you're very beautiful.
- Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?
Mama said you and Robin Hood are sweethearts.
Well, um--
[ Laughs ]
You see, that was several years ago before I left for London.
- Did he ever kiss you?
- Well, uh, no.
But he carved our initials on this tree.
- I remember it so well.
- You gonna have any kids?
My mom gots a lot of kids.
Oh, he's probably forgotten all about me.
Oh, not Robin Hood.
I bet he'll storm the castle gates, fight the guards, rescue ya and drag you off to Sherwood Forest.
Now just a moment there, young man.
You've forgotten Prince John.
That old Prince John don't scare me none.
I'm scared of Prince John.
He's cranky.
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
I, Prince John, challenge you to a duel. Hey, hey!
Take that! And that!
And this!
Death to tyrants!
Och! Och, och!
Slice him to pieces!
Oh, save me, my hero.
Save me.
- [ Skippy Giggling ]
- Oh! Ouch! That's not fair.
Mommy!
That's Prince John, all right.
[ Laughing ]
Yahoo!
Now I got ya!
Och, mercy! Mercy!
Oh!
Oh, he got me.
I'm dying.
- Oh!
- Did I hurt you? Huh?
No, this is the part where you drag your lady fair off to Sherwood Forest.
Come on, lady fair!
Let's go!
Oh, Robin, you're so brave and impetuous.
Oh. [ Panting ]
So this is Sherwood Forest.
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, now what are we gonna do?
Well, usually the hero gives his fair lady a kiss.
A kiss?
Oh, that's sissy stuff.
Well, if you won't, then I will.
[ Chuckling ]
- They're kissing! [ Giggling ]
- [ Laughing ]
[ Sighing ]
Ah, me. Young love.
Oh, it's a grand thing.
Oh, Klucky, surely he must know how much I still love him.
But, of course, my dear.
Believe me, someday soon, your uncle, King Richard, will have an outlaw for an in-law.
- [ Chuckling ]
- [ Chuckling ]
Oh, Klucky.
But when? When?
Oh, patience, my dear.
Patience.
Remember, absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Or forgetful.
Oh, I've been away so long.
What if he's forgotten all about me?
[ Humming ]
Hey, lover boy. How's that grub comin'? Man, I'm starved.
[ Continues Humming ]
Rob? Robin?
Robert?
- Hey!
- Hmm? What? What do you say?
Aw, forget it.
Your mind's not on food.
You're thinkin' about somebody with long eyelashes, and you're smellin' that sweet perfume.
[ Sniffing, Coughing ]
Hey, whoa!
It's boiling over!
You're burnin' the chow!
Sorry, Johnny. Guess I was thinking about Maid Marian again.
I can't help it.
I love her, Johnny.
Look, why don't you stop moonin' and mopin' around?
- Just-- Just marry the girl.
- Marry her?
You don't just walk up to a girl, hand her a bouquet and say,
"Hey, remember me? We were kids together. Will you marry me?"
[ Chuckling ]
No. It just isn't done that way.
Aw, come on, Robbie.
Climb the castle walls.
Sweep her off her feet.
Carry her off in style.
[ Sighing ] It's no use, Johnny.
I've thought it all out, and... it just wouldn't work.
Besides, what have I got to offer her?
Well, for one thing, you can't cook.
I'm serious, Johnny. She's a highborn lady of quality.
So she's got class?
So what?
I'm an outlaw, that's what.
That's no life for a lovely lady.
Always on the run.
- What kind of a future is that?
- Oh, for heaven's sake, son.
You're no outlaw.
Why, someday you'll be called a great hero.
A hero? Do you hear that, Johnny?
We've just been pardoned.
[ Laughs ] That's a gas.
We ain't even been arrested yet.
All right.
Laugh, you two rogues.
But there's gonna be a big to-do in Nottingham.
[ Slurping, Coughing ]
Well done, ain't it?
Old Prince John’s havin' a championship archery tournament tomorrow.
Archery tournament?
Ha!
Old Rob could win that standin' on his head, huh, Rob?
Thank you, Little John.
But I'm sure we're not invited.
No, but there's somebody... who'll be very disappointed if you don't come.
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah, old bushel britches, the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham.
- No, Maid Marian.
- Maid Marian?
Yeah. She-- She's gonna give a kiss to the winner.
- [ Laughing ]
- Kiss to the winner!
Oo-de-lally! Come on, Johnny!
What are we waiting for?
Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it. That place will be crawlin' with soldiers.
Aha! But, remember.
Faint hearts never won fair lady.
Fear not, my friends.
This will be my greatest performance.
[ Trumpeting ]
[ Chuckling ]
Hiss, this is a red-letter day.
A coup d'etat, to coin a Norman phrase.
Oh, yes, indeed, sire.
Your plan to capture Robin Hood in public is sheer genius.
- [ Chuckling ]
- Hiss, no one sits higher than the king.
Must I remind you, Hiss?
[ Clicking Tongue ]
Oh, oh, forgive me, sire.
I-I didn't mean to--
My trap is baited and set... and then revenge!
Ah, revenge!
Shh! Not so loud, sire.
Remember, only you and I know, and your secret is my secret.
Stop! [ Laughs ]
Stop hissing in my ear.
- Secret? What secret?
- Why, the capture of Robin Hood, sire.
That insolent blackguard.
Ooh! I'll show him who wears the crown!
I share your loathing, sire.
That scurrilous scoundrel who fooled you with that silly disguise, who dared to rob you and made you look so utterly ridiculous--
Enough!
Hiss, you deliberately dodged.
But-- B-But--
Sire, please.
Stop snivelling and hold still.
Thank you, sire.
Oh, Klucky,
I'm so excited.
But how will I recognize him?
Och, he'll let you know somehow.
That young rogue of yours is full of surprises, my dear.
There she is, Little John.
Isn't she beautiful?
Cool it, lover boy. Your heart's runnin' away with your head.
Oh, stop worrying.
This disguise would fool my own mother.
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah, but your mom ain't here.
You gotta fool old bushel britches.
- Sheriff? Your Honor?
- Yeah.
Meetin' ya face-to-face is a real treat.
A real treat.
Well, now, thank you.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, excuse me. I gotta go win this tournament.
Hey, old Rob's not a bad actor.
But wait till he sees this scene
I lay on Prince John.
Ah! Me lord.
My esteemed royal sovereign of the realm.
The head man himself.
You're beautiful.
[ Laughs ]
He has style, eh, Hiss?
[ Speaking French ]
[ Laughing ] You took the words right out of my mouth, P.J.
"P.J."! I like that.
Do you know I do?
Hiss, put it on my luggage.
P.J.
[ Laughing ]
P.J. Yes.
Hmpf!
And you?
Who might you be, sir?
I am Sir Reginald, duke of Chutney.
And don't stick your tongue out at me, kid.
And now, Your Mightiness, allow me to lay some protocol on you.
Oh, no. Uh, forgive me, but I lose more jewels that way than--
Please sit down.
Thanks, P.J. Couldn't get a better seat than this, could you?
The royal box.
Oh! Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
What's-- Oh, excuse me, buster.
"Buster"? You, sir, have taken my seat.
[ Laughing ]
Hiss, with you around, who needs a court jester?
[ Laughing ]
Now get out there and keep your snake eyes open for you know who.
You-- You mean, I--
I'm being dismissed?
You heard His Mightiness.
Move it, creepy.
Get lost.
Begone, long one.
What cheek! "Creepy"?
"Buster"? "Long one"?
Who does that dopey duke think he is?
- Now he's up to somethin', Friar.
- Yeah! Come on!
[ Trumpeting ]
Ah, Your Ladyship.
Beggin' your pardon, but it's a great honor... to be shootin' for the favor of a lovely lady like yourself.
I hopes I win the kiss.
Oh!
Well, thank you, my thin-legged archer.
[ Chuckling ]
I wish you luck,
[ Whispering ] with all my heart.
I wonder.
Your Highness, with your royal permission, we are ready to begin.
Proceed, Captain!
The tournament of the golden arrow will now begin.
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- [ Trumpeting ]
[ Cheering ]
[ Whistles ]
Yea, Dad!
[ Crowd Booing ]
[ Crowd Cheering ]
A perfect bull's-eye.
- Well, well.
- [ Laughs ] Yeah.
That's what you call pullin' it back and lettin' it go, P.J.
I'm gonna win that golden arrow, and then I'm gonna present meself to the lovely Maid Marian and--
Listen, scissorbill, if you shoot... half as good as you blabbermouth, you're better'n Robin Hood.
Robin Hood, he says!
Wowee!
I'm tiptop, all right, but I'm not as good as he is.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
[ Laughing ]
That kid's got class, ain't he, P.J.?
Indeed he has, Reggie.
[ Laughs ]
Bravo! Uh, bravo! Yes.
Oh, um, by the way.
I hear you're havin' a bit of trouble gettin' your hands on that Robin Hood.
He's scared of me, that's what he is.
You notice he didn't show up here today.
Huh! I could spot him through them phony disguises.
It's him!
It's Robin Hood!
[ Laughs ] I just can't wait till I tell His Majesty.
[ Giggling ]
Unhand me, you--
[ Grunts ]
Please, please!
I don't drink!
Attention, everyone.
The final contestants are... the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham...
[ Crowd Booing ] and the spindle-legged stork from Devonshire.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
My dear, I suspect you favor the gangly youth, hmm?
Uh, why, yes, sire.
Well, at least he amuses me.
[ Laughs ]
Coincidently, my dear young lady, he amuses me too.
[ Laughing ]
For the final shoot-out, move the target back
30 paces.
You heard him, Nutsy!
Get goin'!
Move it, you birdbrain.
And remember what you're supposed to do.
Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.
[ Crowd Booing ]
[ Chuckling ] Well, that shot wins the golden arrow, the kiss and the whole caboodle.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Crowd Gasping ]
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Yea! He did it, he did it, he did it!
[ Whispering ]
Archer, I commend you, and because of... your superior skill, you shall get what is coming to you.
Our royal congratulations.
Oh, thank you kindly,
Your Highness.
Meetin' you face-to-face,
Your High and Mighty, is a real treat.
Release the royal fingers.
Ah!
And now I name you... the winner, or, more appropriately,
[ Laughs ] the loser!
Seize him.
I sentence you to sudden, instant and even... immediate death!
[ Gasps ]
Oh, no! Oh!
Please.
Please, sire.
I beg of you to spare his life.
Please have mercy.
My dear emotional lady, why should I?
Because I love him,
Your Highness.
"Love him"?
And does this prisoner return your love?
Marian, my darling, I love you more than life itself.
[ Chuckles ]
Ah, young love.
Your pleas have not fallen upon a heart of stone.
But traitors to the Crown must die!
Traitor to the Crown?
That crown belongs to King Richard.
- Long live King Richard!
- [ Crowd ] Long live King Richard!
Enough! I am king!
King! King!
Ah! Off with his head!
[ Sniffling ]
Oh, no!
Stop! Executioner, stop!
Hold your ax!
Okay, big shot. Now tell them to untie my buddy, or I'll--
[ Grunts ]
Sheriff, release my buddy--
[ Grunts ]
I mean, release the prisoner!
Untie the prisoner?
You heard what he said, bushel britches.
Sheriff, I make the rules, and since I am the head man--
Not so hard, you mean thing.
Let him go, for heaven's sakes!
Let him go!
Yee-hee!
Love conquers all!
[ Cheering ]
I owe my life to you, my darling.
I couldn't have lived without you, Robin.
There's somethin' funny goin' on around here.
Now, P.J., tell my pal to kiss Maid Marian, or I've just found a new pincushion.
Why, you!
Kill him!
Don't stand there! Kill him!
Don't hurt me! No, no!
Don't hurt me! Help! Help!
Kill him!
Run for it, lassie!
This is no place for a lady!
[ Screaming ]
Take that, you scoundrel.
Help! Robin, help!
Marian, my love, will you marry me?
Oh, darling, I thought you'd never ask me.
But you could have chosen a more romantic setting.
- And for our honeymoon, London--
- Yes!
- Normandy! Sunny Spain!
- Yes! Why not?
Ooh, what a main event this is.
- [ John Laughing ]
- [ Lady Kluck Shouting ]
What a beautiful brawl.
Hey! Who's drivin' this flyin' umbrella?
- We'll have six children.
- Six?
Oh, a dozen at least.
[ Chuckling ]
Take that!
Attention, everyone.
[ Horn Blaring ]
[ Trumpeting ]
Stop the girl!
- Ooh!
- Take that, you scurvy knave!
Seize the fat one!
- [ Whistles ]
- [ Cheering ]
Yahoo!
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Long live King Richard!
Yee-hoo!
Hiss! You're never around when I need you!
[ Echoing ] Coming. Coming.
[ Laughs ]
For I'm a jolly good fellow
For I'm a jolly good--
[ Laughs ]
Oh! Oh, there you are, old boy!
P.J., you won't believe this, but the stork is really Robin Hood.
Robin Hood.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Screaming ]
Get out of that if you can.
[ Woman ]
Love It seems like only yesterday
You were just a child at play
Now you're all grown up
Inside of me
Oh, how fast those moments flee
Once we watched a lazy world go by
Now the days seem to fly
Life is brief
But when it's gone
Love goes on and on
[ Harmonizing ]
Love will live
Love will last
Love goes on
And on and on
Once we watched a lazy world go by
Now the days seem to fly
Life is brief
But when it's gone
Love goes on and on
Oh, Robin, what a beautiful night.
I wish it would never end.
[ Friar Tuck ]
Surprise!
- Long live Robin Hood!
- [ Sexton ] Hooray!
- And long live Maid Marian!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Hear, hear! Bravo! Bravo!
Hooray!
And down with that scurvy Prince John!
Yeah.
Oh, the world will sing of an English king a thousand years from now
And not because he passed some laws or had that lofty brow
While bonny good King Richard leads the great crusade he's on
We'll all have to slave away for that good-for-nothin' John
Incredible as he is inept
Whenever the history books are kept
They'll call him the phony king of England
A pox on that phony king of England
[ Friar Tuck Laughing ]
[ All Laughing ]
He sits alone on the giant throne pretendin' he's the king
A little tyke who's rather like a puppet on a string
And he throws an angry tantrum if he cannot have his way
And then he calls for Mom while he's suckin' his thumb.
You see, he doesn't wanna play.
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
Apox on that phony king of England
Lay that country on me babe
Come on, Johnny.
Go, laddie, go!
Oh, oh, oooh!
While he taxes us to pieces and he robs us of our bread
King Richard's crown keeps slippin' down around that pointed head
Ah, but while there is a merry man in Robin's wily pack
We'll find a way to make him pay and steal our money back
A minute before he knows we're there
- [ Stops ]
- Old Rob'll snatch his underwear.
- [ All Laughing ]
- [ Resumes ]
The breezy and uneasy king of England
The snivelin', grovelin'
Measly, weaselly
Blabberin', jabberin'
Jibberin', jabberin'
Plunderin', plottin'
Wheelin', dealin'
Prince John
That phony king of England
Yeah
He throws an angry tantrum if he cannot have his way
He calls for Mom and sucks his thumb and doesn't want to play
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
How about that?
That's P.J. to a "T." Let me try.
Let me try. [ Clears Throat ]
[ Warming Up ]
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
The fabulous, marvelous, merciful, chivalrous--
Oh, you got it all wrong, Hiss.
- The snivelin', grovelin', weaselly, measly--
- Enough!
But-But, sire, it's a big hit.
The whole village is singin' it.
Oh, they are, are they?
Well, they'll be singing a different tune.
Double the taxes!
Triple the taxes!
Squeeze every last drop... out of those insolent, musical peasants!
[ Allan-a-Dale ]
Man, oh, man.
- Prince John sure made good his threat,
- [ Thunderclap ] and his helpless subjects paid dearly... for his humiliation, believe me.
Taxes, taxes, taxes.
Why, he taxed the heart and soul out of the poor people of Nottingham.
- [ Guitar ]
- And if you couldn't pay your taxes, you went to jail.
Yep, I'm in here too.
Nottingham was in deep trouble.
Every town
Has its ups and downs
Sometimes ups
Outnumber the downs
But not in Nottingham
I'm inclined to believe
If we weren't so down
We'd up and leave
We'd up and fly
If we had wings for flyin'
Can't you see the tears we're cryin'
Can't there be some happiness
For me
Not in Nottingham
Friar Tuck, [ Sighs ]
I don't think anyone is coming.
You're right, Sexton, but maybe the sound of this church bell... will bring those poor people some comfort.
We must do what we can to keep their hopes alive.
Oh, how can there be any hope with that tyrant Prince John... taxing the heart and soul out of the poor people?
Yes, those poor people.
Look, our poor box is like our church-- empty.
Friar Tuck, we've saved this.
It's not much, but please take it for the poor.
Your last farthing?
Aw, little sister, no one can give more than that.
Bless you both.
Oh, we were just saving it for a rainy day.
Well, it's rainin' now.
- [ Chuckles ] Things can't get worse.
- [ Sheriff ] Howdy, Friar.
- Well, it looks like
I dropped by just in time.
- [ Organ Stops ]
- What does that big-bellied bully want?
- Father, shh.
Hmm. Well, what have we got here?
Now, just a minute,
Sheriff!
Th- Th- That's the poor box!
It sure is, and I'll just take it for poor Prince John.
Every little bit helps.
Oooh, you put that back!
And His Majesty also blesses you, little sister.
You thievin' scoundrel!
Now, take it easy, Friar.
I'm just doin' my duty.
Collectin' taxes for that arrogant, greedy, ruthless, no-good Prince John?
Listen, Friar, you're mighty preachy, and you're gonna preach your neck right into a hangman's noose.
Get out of my church!
- Out! Out! Out! Out!
- Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Oh, dear me.
You want taxes?
- I'll give you taxes!
- Ow!
Give it to him! Give it to him!
Give it to him, Friar!
You're under arrest for high treason to the crown.
Oh, no!
Oh, there, there, Mother.
[ Allan-a-Dale ]
Every town
Has its ups and downs
Sometimes ups
Outnumber the downs
But not in Nottingham
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Clears Throat ]
Sire, if I may-- may venture an opinion, you're not your usual cheerful, genial self today.
I-I-I know. I know.
You haven't counted your money for days, hmm?
It always makes you so happy.
[ Clears Throat ]
Sire, taxes are pouring in, the jail is full.
And, oh,
I have good news, sire.
- Friar Tuck is in jail.
- Friar Tuck?
It's Robin Hood I want, you idiot!
I'd give all my gold if I could just get my hands--
Did you say Friar Tuck?
Did I?
Y-Y-Yes, I did.
Ah!
Hiss, I have it!
I'll use that fat friar as bait to trap Robin Hood.
Another trap?
Yes, yes, you stupid serpent.
Friar Tuck will be led to the gallows in the village square, don't you see?
B-B-But, sire, hang Friar Tuck, a man of the church?
Yes, my reluctant reptile.
And when our elusive hero tries to rescue... the corpulent cleric,
[ Laughing ] my men will be ready.
[ Thunderclap ]
Well, Trigger, everything's rigged up and all set.
Yep, it's one of the prettiest scaffolds you ever built, Sheriff.
Sheriff, don't you reckon we oughta give that there trapdoor a test?
[ Groans ]
Criminently. Now I know why your mama called you "Nutsy."
Alms. Alms for the poor.
Do me old ears hear the melodious voice... of the sheriff?
That's right, old man.
What be going on here?
We're gonna hang Friar Tuck.
No! Hang Friar--
Hang Friar Tuck?
You betcha. At dawn.
And maybe it'll even be a double hangin'.
Shh, shh.
Dummy up, you dummy.
A double hangin', eh?
Who'll be the other one who gets the rope?
Sheriff, he's gettin' too all-fired nosy.
Oh, I didn't mean nothin'.
But, um, couldn't there be trouble... if Robin Hood showed up?
Well, wouldn't you know,
Sheriff, he guessed it.
Nutsy, button your beak.
Ah, no need to worry.
The sheriff be too crafty, too clever and too smart... for the likes of him, says I.
[ Sheriff ]
Ya hear that, Nutsy?
For bein' blind, he sure knows a good man... when he sees one, says I.
Sheriff,
I still got a feelin'... that that snoopy old codger knows too much.
Oh, shut up, Trigger.
He's just a harmless old blind beggar.
Alms.
Alms for the poor.
Alms.
Alms for the poor.
Rob, we can't let 'em hang Friar Tuck.
A jailbreak tonight is the only chance he's got.
A jailbreak? There ain't no way you can get him.
We've got to, Johnny, or Friar Tuck dies at dawn.
1:00, and all's well!
[ Clock Chiming Three Times ]
[ Snorts, Smacking Gums ]
Nutsy, you'd better set your brains ahead a couple of hours.
Yes, sir. Uh, does that there mean addin' or subtractin'?
- Oh, let's forget it.
- Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.
Nutsy, how can I sleep with you yelling
"All's well" all the time here?
Sheriff, everything ain't "all's well."
I got a feelin' in my bones there's gonna be a jailbreak any minute.
Criminently, Trigger!
Point that peashooter the other way.
Don't you worry none, Sheriff.
The safety's on Old Betsy.
What in tarnation you tryin' to do,
- you birdbrain?
- Just doin' my duty, Sheriff.
You and that itchy trigger finger of yours.
[ Muffled Scream ]
- Hey, did you hear that?
- Sure did, Trigger.
There's something funny going on around here. Come on.
You cover me.
Wait a minute.
Is the safety on Old Betsy?
- You bet it is, Sheriff.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
You go first.
All right, you in there, come out with your hands up.
Yeah, reach for the sky.
- Just you watch this
"preformance", partner.
- Be careful, Rob.
Jehoshaphat, Trigger.
Put that peashooter down.
Aw, shucks, Trigger, it's only Nutsy.
And criminently, get back to your patrol.
- On the double. Get!
- I'm a-gettin'.
That Trigger.
He's gettin' everybody edgy.
Nothing's gonna happen.
That fat friar... is gonna dangle from the gallows come daybreak.
Sheriff, why don't you just sit yourself down here kind of cozy-like?
Well, thank you, Nutsy.
Just close your sleepy little eyeballs.
The sandman's a-comin'.
[ Snoring ]
Why don't you, uh, let me loosen that belt?
Rock-a-bye, Sheriff
Just you relax
[ Snoring ]
- [ Humming ]
- [ Humming Along ]
[ Snoring Resumes ]
- [ Humming ]
- [ Clicks ]
[ Snorts ]
Oh, Nutsy, that's mighty sweet.
Sing it one more time, would you?
Rock-a-bye, Sheriff
Just you relax
[ Humming ]
[ Snoring Resumes ]
Wait a minute!
Jailbreak! Jailbreak!
I heard it! I heard it, Sheriff!
The door! The door!
- Now, for the last time, no more false alarms.
- Ow!
Now, you release Friar Tuck and the others... and I'll drop in on the royal treasury.
Oh, Little John, it can't be!
- Shh, quiet. We're bustin' out of here.
- Thank God.
My prayers have been answered.
- I'm ready. Where's the bad guys?
- Take it easy, son.
- [ Prince John Snoring ]
- [ Hiss Hissing ]
[ Prince John ]
Robin Hood!
[ Laughing ]
I'll get even. I'll get--
[ Prince John Sighing ]
[ Snorts, Grumbles ]
[ Snoring ]
[ High-Pitched Moaning ]
[ High-Pitched Moaning ]
[ Snoring ]
It's Robin Hood I--
I want.
[ Laughing Continues ]
[ Muttering ]
[ Laughing ]
Praise the Lord and pass the tax rebate!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Come on. Follow me.
Now, Sheriff--
Now, don't get your dander up, but I still got a feelin' that--
Friar, get goin'.
Hurry.
[ Clock Chiming Four Times ]
[ Moans ]
[ Snorts, Mutters ]
[ Shuddering ]
[ Whimpering ]
[ Screaming ]
Ooo-oooh!
Guards! Guards!
My gold!
Oh, no, no, no.
They're getting away with my gold.
Guards! Guards!
To the jail!
Rhinos, halt!
Stop! Desist!
[ Screaming ]
Everybody, this way!
That's all of them.
Get going.
This ain't no hayride.
Let's move it out of here. Ho-ooo!
On to Sherwood Forest!
Stop! My baby!
Mama, Mama, wait for me.
- We got him now!
- Keep going. Don't worry about me.
This time, we got him for sure.
Shoot him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Come on, Rob. Come on.
He's just gotta make it.
No! No. No.
Hiss, he's finished!
Done for!
La, la, la
[ Laughing ]
He's gonna make it, isn't he, Little John?
Hey, what's that?
Little John, look it!
Look it!
Hey, what the--
[ Laughs ]
Oh, man, did you have me worried, Rob.
I thought you were long gone.
Ah, not Robin Hood.
He could've swum twice that far, huh, Mr. Robin Hood, sir?
Look, Friar! Look!
He's made it. He got away again.
A pox on that phony King of England!
Oo-de-lally!
- Oo-de-lally!
- Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair.
Well, I tried to tell you, but, no, no, no, you wouldn't listen.
Your traps never work, and look what you've done to your mother's castle.
[ Screaming ]
Mommy!
- [ Screams ] Sire, no!
- You cowardly cobra!
Please! Oh, no!
Procrastinating python!
- Aggravating asp!
- Save me!
You eel in snake's clothing!
Help!
He's gone stark raving mad!
[ Echoing ]
[ Whistling ]
You know, I thought we'd never get rid of those two rascals, but lucky for us folks,
King Richard returned, and, well, he just straightened everything out.
[ Whimpering ]
Oooh. Aaah.
[ Church Bells Chiming ]
Say, we'd better get over to the church.
Sounds like somebody's gettin' hitched.
[ All ]
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live King Richard!
Oh, Friar Tuck, it appears that I now have an outlaw for an in-law.
Yes, not bad.
Gee, Skippy, how come you're goin'?
Well, Robin Hood's gonna have kids, so somebody's gotta keep their eye on things.
Ho-ooo!
Ohhh.
I've never been so happy.
Hey, here come the bride,
Trigger.
Present arms!
[ Allan-a-Dale Chuckles ] Well, folks, that's the way it really happened.
Love goes on and on
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
There, that's good.
Luckily we've got ace photographer
Angus Snapforth to do our credits.
He works longitudinally... developing his negatives in Turkish-bath cabinet.
So this should be just the job for him.
And he has promised to make it snappy.
37 miles to the north, a bit east, and then up a bit lies Pinchcliff.
A village perched under the blue welkin... with it's own steam-driven cheese factory, a camping site, a local paper... and it's own TV station.
Open to all the winds that blow, where the sun rises above Lonetree Hill... lives our cycle-repairer,
Theodore Rimspoke.
Must be awkward for a wretched cyclist with a blow-out... to have to wheel his mount all this way to get our expert to fix it.
Doesn't look as if business is very thriving, does it?
It's only our postman, old foot-slogging
Dan Hoofer, who makes his way there... with the local rag and outstanding bills. His greatcoat has diamond tread.
He's colour blind and has been run over a couple of times... walks with a list to port and plays the big bass on festive occasions.
Not much more to sa y about Hoofer.
Cycle-repairer Rimspoke is an independent sort of bloke.
More of an inventor than a businessman.
Famous for his ingenious designs... such as pedal-activated combined shaving and raspberry-picking machine.
He uses a copying pencil, instant coffee and his own patent telescopic ruler.
Sonny Duckworth is the early bird personified.
Hatched out in a weeping willow. A born optimist...
- with muffler, felt slippers and indifferent morals. As Sonny puts it:
The early worm gets the bird.
Difficulties he treats as trifles, the impossible as a challenge.
He's Rimspoke's right-hand man, counsellor, and friend.
Lambert is a night-owl with ha y-fever, a pillar of the rustic establishment.
Run over by a reaper and got a crew-cut, short back, bushy by the ears.
Found under the roots of a knotted oak and included as a Rimspoke resident.
Lambert is a personal pessimist, and only really at home in Darkest Devon.
And this is their home, standing in its own pleasant grounds... enjoying all the benefits of
Rimspoke's ingenious gadgets.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Hi, Theodore! Look at this.
This morning's post.
Nothing but bills. Put them on the window sill with the others.
Take a look at that super car!
Look at that there Rudolph Gore-Slimey!
- Do you know that fellow?
- Know him?
- Yes, I'll say I know him.
- Do you know him personal?
That there Rudolph, he was a kind of apprentice to me in my workshop.
Then he suddenly packed it in and went to town.
And now he's in big business, and a racing driver, I see.
You don't sa y...? Big business, too?
Beats me how that there Gore-Slimey... got into the racing circuit?
Competing with the best in the world, it says.
Look! Smashing picture on the back too.
Well, I never...!
I might have guessed as much.
Guessed? Guessed what?
I wonder what he's got under his bonnet?
So that's why Gore-Slimey was in such a hurry to go to town, huh?
There's some skulduggery going on here.
- More trouble brewing, I'll wager...
- No, no, Lambert.
Say, Theodore, what's skulduggery?
Yeh, what's skulduggery?
Well, we better get down to some honest work.
Out with you, and set to work!
When the call to work goes out,
Brother, please include me out!
Put your hat and coat on, Lambert!
Come on!
I see, doing your daily dozen, Lambert?
I say, what's skulduggery, Sonny?
Skulduggery?
That is skulduggery!
Oh.
The north wind's blowing from every quarter today, Sonny?
Lovely weather for working.
I'm scared, I am.
I don't like it when it's blowing from every quarter.
- Let's get this contraption working!
- All, right, just leave it to me.
Computerised production of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy!
That'll be 10, 75.
Theodore is self-supporting, has his own electric power, water laid on... and turns an honest penny on the side.
Lambert remains a true romantic.
Despite his chronic hay fever
Lambert is conspicuously on parade... whenever the sun shines down at Pinchcliffe.
You'd hardly say life at Rimspoke's is one mad rush, but now and again... a buckled wheel or a bent handlebar needs attention.
The profits are hardly likely to cause repercussions on the money market... still the three of them up the hill are content enough.
Don't be frightened, Lambert.
I'll switch the TV on, Theodore.
- I don't like TV.
- There's no bogeyman in the box.
You never can tell, can you.
And now for the news, read by
pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.
This is usually pretty exciting.
The situation is still
very tense in the Middle East.
Here...
- Dang me sideways!
- I'm scared, I am, Theodore.
And now after the news,
the World of Sport.
We deserve a little extra treat tonight.
I expect you'd like some dewrinkled raisins, Sonny?
Help yourself, there's plenty for everyone.
The current Motor Racing
sensation, Rudolph Gore-Slimey.
After winning his third successive
Grand Prix. A few words, please.
I came of humble stock from
the little village of Pinchcliffe.
Worked for a while in a cycle repair
shop run by an eccentric rustic.
Forget his name... Theodore...
Theodore Rimspoke, I think it was.
- Just hark at him... I mean to sa y...
- Quiet now, Sonny!
Humble beginnings, eh?
Funny to think how easy it can be
to get stuck in a rut like that place.
But there was no stopping you?
No, and I think my latest invention
will revolutionise motor racing!
- What invention?
- This super retometric distributor.
It raises the jet-injection factor to
1000 and the corradial effect by 112%.
So that's your game! So that's your invention, is it, Rudolph?
Funny, because here's the working drawing!
What did you sa y? Has Gore-Slimey gone and swiped your invention?
Yes, he must have collared it when he was working here as my assistant.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop. I never heard the like!
I sa y, please, could you pass me another liquorice allsorts?
Hush! We must listen to what Gore-Slimey has to sa y.
Let me repeat, I'm prepared anytime,
anywhere, to meet any challenge.
Thank you for talking to us.
We hope we shall soon see
someone putting up a challenge.
Now the Chairman, District Veterinary
Surgeon Roger Uddersfield...
will present today's commercials.
For guaranteed social success, use
Brough, the swift-action hair tonic.
- Switch off that commercial nonsense!
- Remember the name, Brough!
Recommended by egg-heads!
- Don't let them fool you, Theodore!
- Well, what's a bloke to do now?
You're going to challenge!
No, no, that'd be dangerous.
- You pipe down, Lambert!
- Challenge him?
I do have a little secret tucked away in the coach-house. Might be fun...
Have a go! Could you get this completed, Gore-Slimey wouldn't need... any driving-mirror!
Just imagine II Tempo Gigante!
Rimspoke's reply to the Italian Ferrari!
- Out of the way, macadamised snail!
- Save your felt-slippers, Sonny.
Well, shall we take a peep inside the coach-house and see what we've got?
- Yes, let's!
- Oh, no.
There isn't much I can do with this thing here.
It's in a sorrier state than I suspected.
- You could soon fix this up.
- Can't build a car without a penny.
I haven't even got the nuts and bolts.
We'll have to make a real killing!
You could raise the wind, could you?
A divinity shapes our ends.
Stick'em up!
- Hand it over!
- Do you suppose I've got any money?
This bloke's a poor as a church mouse!
- This won't solve our problems.
- Well, blow me. I'll be...
Well, blow me. I'll be...
That really hurt.
Never felt such a pain before.
Wouldn't never ever have thought it possible.
- Move over!
- Can't I have the inside berth tonight?
- Don't we all have our places?
- I never get the inside berth.
- There's such a draft off the floor.
- That's why I take the inside berth.
Come on, pipe down!
Well, good night to you, Sonny.
Sleep well.
Nighty!
Sonny!
Sonny!
I sa y, Theodore? Has he gone out?
I wonder why?
Theodore's feeling a bit down in the dumps.
I wonder if it is because he hasn't got enough money to build the car, Sonny?
Think you'll be able to help him out, eh, Sonny?
Lambert, it's only a matter of time... before Sonny Duckworth of Sludgemere strikes again!
I think I'll just stretch my carcase a bit more.
Oi! String me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Rolls-Royce 1905 model! Solid gold.
Acetylene lamps.
Gosh, transverse interleaved suspension. Silicon finish...
What sort of a spooky get-up is that?
He must be oozing with dough!
Gosh! He's using dollar bills as fly-whisks!
"Aladdin Oil"!
He must be one of those oil sheiks!
Perhaps we could funnel a little in Theodore's direction...
Snickety snoo!
How too, too snickety snoo.
If this isn't tempting providence,
I'd like to know what is.
An ape, honestly. A genuine cross between a chimp and a gorilla.
This is no joking matter!
There should be plenty of money here for Theodore's new design.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Talk about an Oriental chick!
And that fierce-looking money-grubber!
Desperados!
What eez the bizniz going on here?
And the papyrus here?
Theez eez no hieroglyphics.
Theeze eez drawing of fast motor-car.
Sensation!
Theez car work of great genius.
Where is the deesigner?
Ali, ali, Emanuel Desperados, you fetch me theez genius!
Thrown out? Not possibull!
Throw out of the tent of
Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza?
Idiot!
You stupid gorilla dam blockhead.
Sonny's not the type to give up easily!
At a pinch he gets his fertile brain... work overtime and changes his line of attack.
Once his mind's made up, there's no stopping Sonny.
Ah, yes, the Pinchcliffe Gazette.
That's an idea all right.
An ad inserted here will have world wide coverage!
My Spanish gambit eez successful!
And it's Desperados to move.
Your check easy to overcome.
I just go through weez my castle.
That shake you, eh?
You theenk you vairy smart, no?
I just move my keeng...
And you get nowhere.
Jallah.
Sheikh Bonanza checkmated?
You...!
I no time to play theez silly game with stoopid ape. I prefer study drawing.
Emanuel Desperados.
Zees car ingenious!
You!
Throw designer out of my tent. Idiot!
You beeg blockhead!
Stoopid gorilla...
So you're up early for once, Lambert?
Yeh, gotta spend a penny.
- Perhaps you could fetch the paper?
- Yeh, I'll do that for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have a sensational announcement...
of the new racing car now under
construction by Theodore Rimspoke.
Pinchcliffe radio and
Television roving reporter...
pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank,
has all the details.
Your on the air, Archie!
It's all yours!
- You're on the air.
- Thank you.
My, you people are inquisitive!
We have it on the best of authority...
that cycle-repairer
Theodore Rimspoke...
resident of Pinchcliffe, plans to
complete his II Tempo Gigante.
Aha! There's the sooper-dooper car.
What an advertisement for Aladdin Oil!
Me finance Rimspoke and we win race!
Emanuel Desperados, you drive me!
We go visit genius!
Emanuel, geev me completed contract!
And you, my little turtle dove, you come visit Big Chief Rimspoke.
Desperados, speed, queek, hurry!
Hurry, hurry!

My car guaranteed!
Hurry! Turn starting-handle!
Bravo!
Close zee door and get cracking!
Hurry! We late!
Now change gear!
Caramba!
Put her in reverse... there you idiot.
Snitchery snoo!
This is tempting providence putting all this in print.
Theodore, it says in the paper.
But where the dickens is it?
- Theodore, the paper!
- What does it say in the paper?
It's all about your car.
What? Let's have a look!
Well, what do you know!
II Tempo Gigante? It's our car!
How did that old picture get into print?
Speed it up!
Dangerous suspension bridge. Hurry!
Speed it up!
"Rimspoke has accepted
Gore-Slimey's challenge."
"Prospects for the
Race of the Century."
I wonder who's gone and...?
So, that's it. Sonny has been at work.
Yeh, Sonny has been at work.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!
- What've you been up to now, Sonny?
- What've you been up to now, Sonny?
- Just a few casual acquaintances.
- Sonny's casual acquaintances, eh?
They're apt to be a bit suspect.
- I believe we've got something outside.
- Sounds like it.
Ze silence here is as profound as in ze desert. All people inside ze house.
Emanuel, go knock up ze door!
Would you open the door, Lambert?
Someone's lost his way and landed here.
Hurry along, Lambert, you like receiving visitors, I know.
Lambert, man, don't be scared just because the door creaks a bit.
Look at Sonny!
Cool as a prize cucumber.
- Give them a nice welcome, Lambert.
- Yes, I certainly will.
- Oh, gosh!
- Salaam, salaam!
May Allah protect thee and thy house.
I have journeyed from afar to have a good squint at Rimspoke.
Have no fear, friend! My chauffeur not dangerous, just a bit inquisitive.
Very, very inquisitive!
What sort of a jungle denizen might this be?
Must have been smuggled in in a crate of bananas.
You ze great bicycle-repairer Rimspoke?
Yes, that's supposed to be me.
Just step right inside.
Brew up a pot of coffee, Lambert.
Ah, you verry kind. We come to have pow-wow and you must listen to me.
You Rimspoke brilliant designer.
I Abdul Ben Bonanza have seen TV.
I will finance your Tempo Gigante.
I plenty moneys. You plenty broke.
Well, maybe, but what do you want me to do?
You use my oil and petrol.
Z e best in ze whole world.
She'll run on my own patent mixture.
It would be fun to give it a try.
Then pleez you sign theez contract.
No, no, that's dangerous.
- Do you think so, Lambert?
- Of course you'll sign, Theodore.
The offer of a century, from friends in distant lands!
- Yes, pleez sign!
- You're on dangerous ground.
Don't listen to that Jeremiah.
It's the chance of a lifetime.
Well, it might well be.
Bravo! So now pleez sign contract.
We're heading straight for disaster. I know it.
It's amazing what you can do with money!
And a string of oil wells to back you up.
Damn me if Theodore, the bird... and our ungainly furry friend with the rucksack haven't really go cracking!
Nuts and bolts, sprockets and spindles.
Skilled hands engaged in precision lathe-work... on rotary hydrogenic valves.
With one vigilant eye cocked on the doings of willing helpers... who run unnecessary risks without the protection of safety footwear.
Work proceeds da y and night.
Mysterious fluids seethe and bubble in carboys, copper tubes and on hotplates.
Theodore is experimenting with all kinds of fuel... and hand-made thinly rolled body panels.
Behind dark goggles Theodore is concocting a motorised carriage... that is going to prove a sensation in the motor-racing world... with technical finesses which entail radical innovations in the carburetion!
Straight down the lightning conductor!
Theodore has taken proper precautions... against natural catastrophes and unforeseen punctures.
Il Tempo Gigante features special tyres, with steel reinforcement.
And seven layers of chicken netting welded into West Indian rubber alloys.
When Theodore builds an engine, he doesn't settle for a mere two-stroke.
He has drilled 12 cylinders and fitted them with concave linings... rammed in a whole heap of high-tension ignition plugs... linked to three-inch hyper-polished exhaust manuals.
The finished product weighing 2.8 tons... is impressive enough to shake any major motor factory to its foundation.
It takes a full year to knock out a vehicle like II Tempo Gigante.
The day Theodore completed the prototype... the Bristol seismograph registered
7,8 on the Richter scale.
Not a bad start for a do-it-yourself village enthusiast.
Here's the late news.
It has been confirmed that II Tempo
Gigante is ready for its supreme test.
People in Pinchcliffe
are confident that Rimspoke...
can show Gore-Slimey
a clean pair of heels.
We shall see when the chips are down.
Time will show!
Hi, you'll frighten them out of their wits!
Sonny! Sonny!
Who is it? Where is he?
I can hear something real horrible.
There must be someone outside snooping around.
Theodore, there's someone snooping around at the dead of night.
I bet it's someone after your car.
I think we should hide in the cellar.
What? In the cellar?
- Night-time intruders?
- Yes, I think there are people about.
Our burglar alarm should deal with car thieves, and it's all set up.
You go to the right, Sonny, on the other side of the coach-house... and I'll go this side.
- And you keep an eye on the door.
- I'm scared, I am, Theodore.
I never been so scared.
Never thought I would ever be so scared.
Hush, someone's coming!
That's Mister Gore-Slimey in the bag all right.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Gracious...
So it's you strung up and dangling there, Lambert?
I walked slap into it!
That rope was intended for Rudolph, so you'll have to forgive me, Lambert.
That put the skids on old Gore-Slimey.
Sir Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
We are gathered together to unveil
Rimspoke's technical masterpiece... which in tomorrows Grand Prix will challenge the world's racing drivers... including Rudolph Gore-Slimey in his 12-cylinder Boomerang Rapido.
We're gratified to have TV coverage today... in black and white and in choice colours.
This event is being transmitted
via the Pinchcliffe TV control panel... designed by Theodore Rimspoke and broadcast nationwide... full stop.
To mark this auspicious occasion we have invited one of our greatest brads.
Despite an attack of the sniffles and the handicap of a mane of unruly air... composed a laudatory epic:
Hanbury Dapplenag!
Greetings, mighty son of the desert waste
On whose oil-wells your stupendous wealth is based
By whose presence this ceremony is graced
Our great inventor, thanks to your banking account
Was able to sting you for a sizable amount
And so in this week-end's great race we folk
Can cheer on our hero Theodore Rimspoke
Driving a very speedy vehicle which
Bears the name of my modest shanty:
The racing car II Tempo Gigante!
Thank you, Dapplenag, and may the Government grant your application... for a three-year
Bardic Travelling Scholarship.
And now I shall ask Sheikh Abdul Ben
Bonanza to rise and be upstanding.
As funds from North Sea is not yet available for projects such as these... an overseas sheikh has generously stepped into the breach.
This entitles him to the honour of unveiling this super car.
Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza, she's all yours!
I must ask the audience to retain your seats and your composure.
We have TV coverage, and Theodore will now answer a few snaky questions.
Today's news features Rimspoke's sensational II Tempo Gigante... capable of challenging Gore-Slimey's
GT Super Boomerang Rapido.
Congratulations on the car!
I must say, equipped with radar and all?
That's right.
In the event of fog and landslides.
And to anticipate any concealed entrances.
Could we have a rundown?
Let's start with the cranking handle, which starts the engine up forward... which in turn starts the carburettor... which finally activates the rocket engine at the rear.
- And then she really moves, eh?
- You could say that, yes.
And your top speed?
With twelve cylinders and pure alcohol fuel... and a gaggle of rockets raring to go... the old bus could hardly be described as a slowcoach.
This job is designed with front-and rear-wheel drive... as well as direct fuel injection slap in the jet... using the cantilever method.
And I've installed two speedometers... serially linked so that one takes over when the other registers maximum.
- And then this rotary wind-gauge...
- And what about this brake-block?
Same system as on a bike, but reinforced.
- And what's this device?
- That's blood type Rhesus B Plus.
And Rhesus Minus, and a dash of blue blood if we should bump into a baron.
- Or some other aristocrats.
- Very smart.
How about a look at the cockpit?
No. That wouldn't interest the public.
- Top secret, maybe?
- Um...
Well, it only remains for me to wish
Rimspoke every success in the race.
And now back to our compère,
Dairy Manager Oliver Clapthwaite.
Thanking you.
And now our local band will conclude this ceremony... with a specially composed march,
Cantata Opus Two... by pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.
But first a special welcome to another prominent visitor, Emanuel Desperados.
Private chauffeur, born right round the last bend of the Limpopo River.
He has kindly consented to assist in the role of guest drummer.
And now you can see Sheikh Abdul Ben
Bonanza arriving in his Rolls-Royce... driven by Emanuel Desperados.
This great magnate is the owner of Aladdin Oil.
There's an air of excitement here as we await the start of this epic encounter... between the world's leading drivers.
Now here's No. 3 coming up to start.
The Italian Ruffino Gassolini... known as the Turin Daredevil, in his Bertone Carabo.
No. 12 is the German Heinrich von
Schnellfahrt, in his red Abarth 2000... the celebrated speed-merchant with glass-eye and monocle.
Here's No. 5, the Swede
Ronny Turnip Anderson... the Gothenburg Gogetter, followed by
No. 8, the Argentine Carlos Fandango.
The pampas playboy who ran slap into a wall and escaped without a scratch.
An impressive array of horsepower.
There's one question of special interest to fans: Has Aladdin Oil acted wisely... in staking money and prestige on a mere cycle-repairer?
I imagine the people in Pinchcliffe...
will follow today's event with
special attention to their hero.
Let's have a closer look
at Aladdin Oil.
Rimspoke is just leaving the pits.
What competition can his home-made
design, II Tempo Gigante, offer?
It seems hardly likely that an
prototype built by a cycle-repairer...
will go the full 25 laps
of today's gruelling Grand Prix.
But during yesterdays acceleration test
II Tempo Gigante showed a speed... that ensured it a surprisingly good starting position.
In the Snake Oil pit the director of the
Dry Rot and Fungus Control Authority... and ace driver Gore-Slimey is behind the wheel of his Boomerang Rapido.
Rudolph Gore-Slimey has a string of victories in his car... with a great many hush-hush features.
Only a handful of intimates know what's concealed beneath the black bonnet.
His co-driver, in a cockpit designed on
Spitfire lines, is Eleaser Cassandra... whose gift of second sight has proved invaluable in a tight corner.
Less is known of Theodore Rimspoke's co-driver, Sonny Duckworth.
Two novices to the track that should be watched with interest.
In 30 seconds from now this impressive pack of speed-hungry roadsters... will be streaking across the line in the Grand Prix of the Century.
Five, four, three, two, one!
They're off! The home-made contraption already seems to be in trouble.
This is bound to be a severe disappointment to Aladdin Oil.
The German Heinrich von Schnellfahrt in his Abarth 2000 has taken the lead... closely pursued by the Italian
Ruffino Gassolini and Gore-Slimey.
But now it looks like they've managed to crank II Tempo Gigante into action.
She seems to be firing on all twelve cylinders.
She's off, and good luck to her.
She's got a lot of leeway to make up.
Not a very encouraging start
for the good people of Pinchcliffe.
It does really look as if Rimspoke is putting his best foot forward.
Gore-Slimey in the lead followed by
McQuick, the Swede and Gassolini.
In a moment they'll be completing the first lap.
Gore-Slimey has been passed by the Irishman McQuick.
Here they come. Gore-Slimey flashing past still in the lead.
With nine laps to go, Rimspoke is lagging 30 seconds behind the leaders.
He has a lot of ground to make up.
And now the Argentine ace
Carlos Fandango goes into the lead.
And now it looks as if Rimspoke really has got his horsepower harnessed.
By my stopwatch he's pulled in as much as 15 seconds on his first lap... which is sensational. We should not write off Aladdin Oil's chances yet.
Gore-Slimey once again in the lead with
Nos. 4, 12, 3, 8 and 5 in hot pursuit.
Followed by Rimspoke.
He must have put in a tremendous burst!
Rimspoke's backers are clearly elated.
The wee chappie now facing the camera is one of Rimspoke's rusty assistants.
No doubt his first visit
on a race-track.
A popular feature
in this tough competition.
A message: Would the owner of the car registered PP 14U2... parked on a manhole outside
Entrance C kindly remove his vehicle... as a Drainage and Water Board inspector is anxious to return home.
We are just coming up for another lap.
And Gore-Slimey is still in the lead.
Amazing what Rimspoke is getting out of his car.
Can he really keep going?
Rimspoke has now rejoined the bunch, and Schnellfahrt answers with a spurt.
Rimspoke's giving all his got, but seems to be having trouble with his engine.
He's falling back.
But he's picking up again... and is hot on the heels of
McQuick, Gassolini and Anderson.
Going into the hairpin bend we get a ding-dong struggle... between Schnellfahrt and Rimspoke.
Out of the bend we have
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke.
Rimspoke must have gone into a bit of a skid. His car seems a bit stern-heavy.
There's a dramatic tussle going on, with Gore-Slimey still in the lead.
And there goes Rimspoke, shooting into the lead. Aladdin Oil... is leading in the Grand Prix!
II Tempo Gigante passing the stands with a clear lead.
But it sounds like she is misfiring?
The subsequent order is Gore-Slimey,
Fandango, Schnellfahrt, Gassolini... and the Swede Turnip Anderson.
Rimspoke is clearly in trouble.
His engine is definitely labouring.
Gore-Slimey is coming up hand over first.
Now he's passed him and is in the lead again!
Things seem to be going disastrously wrong for Rimspoke and Aladdin Oil.
Rimspoke is being overhauled by the rest of the field. My, what a pity.
After such a splendid performance by this unusual vehicle!
But that's the way things go!
Snake Oil first with the German second.
Just behind these two comes Fandango.
The field's spreading out now.
And here's the Swede leaving the pits after a spot of trouble.
But II Tempo Gigante is obviously in still greater trouble.
She is being taken hand of by her team of mechanics.
Now the German seems to be making a bid. Fandango breathing down his neck.
The field seems to be massing for a thrilling attack on the leaders.
Rimspoke is really back in the race!
Talk about a quick start! Nothing like it since the Apollo went into orbit.
Driver and co-driver must have been subject to something like 3 G!
Once again Rimspoke challenges the cream of the world's racing drivers.
This can develop into something truly spectacular!
Looks as if Aladdin Oil have called on their second driver. What a gamble!
Gassolini holding on to a slim lead, closely followed by the others.
What about Rimspoke and his new second driver?
It's obvious that II Tempo Gigante is now performing superbly.
Rimspoke is closing in on the field.
But Gore-Slimey has pulled ahead and has a clear lead.
Gore-Slimey has a commanding lead, and passes... there.
The rest of the field is nicely bunched, with the German in front.
But Rimspoke is now only seven seconds behind the German.
Rimspoke, clearly full of go is only
15 seconds behind Gore-Slimey.
It's going to be hard to predict the winner.
Things are really hotting up.
The German is back in the lead... with the others breathing down his neck.
Il Tempo Gigante is putting on a terrific spurt and catching up!
It's a neck-and-neck struggle between
Gore-Slimey and Theodore Rimspoke.
Gore-Slimey is just hanging on to his lead... but the others are hard on his heels.
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke are leaving the rest of the field inexorably behind.
Now what's happening?
Gore-Slimey pulls away.
Rimspoke is in trouble, with II Tempo
Gigante threatening to disintegrate.
Gore-Slimey is starting on the last lap.
But where is Rimspoke?
There! He seems to have got his engine going full blast once again!
Gore-Slimey can't be sure of victory.
Both cars being squeezed to the limit.
This is the last and decisive lap, and
a final maximum effort is called for.
This speed must be a terrific strain
on chassis, engine, tyres,...
and the drivers themselves.
Here things are really getting dramatic.
Il Tempo Gigante is enveloped in smoke.
Is she on fire?
A highly dramatic finish!
Rimspoke comes out of the bend with
Gore-Slimey scraping his exhaust.
He flashes across the line there!
Winner of the Grand Prix of the century!
In third place the German, followed by the Argentinean, Irishman and Italian.
What a race, what a finish, and what a triumph for our village cycle-repairer... and a sheikh who staked his reputation and money on his intuition.
We congratulate Pinchcliffe, the native village of the three worthies... who ensured II Tempo Gigante such a sensational triumph.
The cup and the laurels were just one more incident... in the lives of Theodore,
Sonny, and Lambert.
They'll be back at their daily chores tomorrow, with petty quarrels... inventions and the manufacture of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy.
- Tonight you have the inside berth!
- Can I?
- Is that really possible?
- Take the inside when I tell you to!
Goodness me!
Snitchery pooh.
- Nighty!
- Nighty!

Good morning, Sister
Good day, Maria
You startled me, Marcello l wanted to show you this lamb. lt was born last week
The family grows...
See how much it weighs
At least two bags of rice or two barrels of wheat
Come and see me if he has any problems
Where's the rest of them?
There
Here...
Go on...
Take a bite
Still not done?
What've you been up to?
Lazy creature! l should have the pair of you locked up for a week
Dinner still not ready?
You worthless creature
Look at this!
What a disgusting mess...!
Only fit for animals!
Dinner's late again
What's wrong sister?
- l want to die
- Why? l've always felt this way
When you take religious orders you must change the way you think
You are a nun, Sister l came here to hide from the world l don't understand
My color, Sister.
That's my curse l just want to die
No
My parents were slaves. l was born a slave l'm tired of being mistreated l came to the convent to escape all that
But nothing's changed. l wish l'd never been born l wish l'd never been born
Even here l'm treated badly
Sister, death is no solution
We don't own our lives
They belong now to our beloved Lord
Good morning, Sister
Come in
- Hail Mary the Pure
- God be with you
Sister, Sofia's cow is sick
Mother Superior wants you to help
She says you know about these things l think it's a lung infection
She's very sick
Caridad, bring me some pine needles, some mint and grass
And you, Sister, start to make a fire
Oil, Sister
You can go now.
The worst is over l'll stay.
Go and get some sleep
God be with you, Sister
Can l help you?
Sister Maria, l've come to make a confession l put my life in your hands
But why confide in me?
You should see the Mother Superior
Please, Sister Maria...
...only you can help me l trust only you
Very well, tell me...
Maria... Sister...
The truth is...
...l love you l don't understand, Sister
Observing your virtue, your depth, your purity... l fell in love with you l love you Maria. Forgive me...
My name is Luzbel, Sister...
Call me Lucifer...
Mephisto... lf you want me... lf you need me
Just think of me l'm everywhere ln your mind for eternity
All your life, l am with you lt is impossible to describe the face of a sinner ln fact, in a society of the damned they all look the same ln general they are fearsome; lifeless, like a corpse
Some are black...
Some burn like a torch
Some are found in food or in sick bodies
Many are cursed. lnstead of a face, they have fur
You can only see their teeth and their monstrous bodies
Good morning, Marcello
Morning, Maria
Do you know the story of the King of the River? lt's just a fairy tale, and you're too old for those now
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, Sister! l swear lt's not a bad thing.
You'll soon be a man
Maybe you already are
Yes, you are a man... l'm right, aren't l?
Do you want to show me how much? lt's me. Sister Clemencia.
Open up
What is it?
Can't you say?
My shoulder... lt really hurts l fear it might be serious
- You must have sinned
- No, Sister. l never sin l have been here many years and am free of sin
Maybe...
But you have the Devil's mark
Look! l have one too...
Don't lie to me
Sister... l know you have studied medicine l know you can cure me
Does it still hurt?
What took you so long? l was praying, Mother l saw Sister Clemencia running away
What happened?
She wanted me to cure her.
But l couldn't
She's really...very sick
Do you know what it is?
My daughter, what troubles you?
Nothing, Mother l can sense that you have something to tell me
But you're afraid
Our community is based on trust, forgiveness, help...
Why not let me help you?
Why won't you talk to me?
Have you had wicked thoughts? l was praying, Mother. l'm alright l don't see the prayer book lt fell when l answered the door. l think it's under the bed l'll pray for you, Mother...
And for Clemencia
Sister Clemencia is very sick,
Mother
...ln here
Good evening, Mother. lt's nice to see you
But why are you wandering here alone? l heard Marcello was ill. l hope it's not serious l came to see him
No, Mother. Marcello isn't ill
He's just very tired and is sleeping
But please come in.
Please give him your blessing ln there, Mother
Come in
Hail Mary the Pure
What's wrong, Sister?
We came to ask if you want to go with us...
..to the funeral of Marcello and his grandmother
No!
What happened?
Afire...
They burned to death in their sleep
The villagers brought the bodies here
Where are the bodies? ln the chapel, waiting for burial
May l... l want to be alone with the bodies l wish to pray for them
You know how much l loved Marcello
When the bells sound, l shall return from my vigil
Very well, Sister
Your sins know no bounds!
You have offended the Lord with your actions l tried to help you but you rejected me
Do you hate me?
The Holy lnquisition will judge you
The important thing is to save your soul
But l have done nothing
You plead innocence?
No, not innocence.
But the Devil is in me l don't fear Hell...
...for l AM Hell!
Pray that the Lord did not hear you l shall ascend to the highest point of heaven
And build my throne next to the stars l'm more powerful than God l'll not serve him
But revolt against him!
Silence!
You speak the words of Satan! l'll do as my master says l'll gather together all those...
...most pure in heart and soul...
...have them follow after me, then torture them all...
...in the darkest realms of Hell!
You are damned!
Oh! Lord forgive me l've always hated you
Ever since you stole my place here ls everything ready?
Yes, it's sad the Lord took
Marcello and his grandmother
He was so young
Lord, if l worshipped you because l feared Hell
Then let me burn in Hell lf l loved you only in promise of Heaven
Then exclude me from it
But if l loved you for yourself, then am l your daughter
Your daughter...
Don't deny me your wonders
Sister... l've come to save you
You will be the happiest of all women
Begone and leave me with my pain, damn you!
You turned me into a monster.
Begone!
Accept me and you shall become
Mother Superior l wish to die in peace.
Begone, Lucifer!
Look, Sister, the nuns are coming to take you to the lnquisition
They bring the fiery cross
You know what that means
Before killing you, they will torture you
Your mouth will be ripped open lt will be filled with molten lead
Your body torn into a thousand pieces
Your screams will echo through the valley
They will all watch you die
Think of that
Think!
Do you wish to be Mother Superior?
You will be happy and important
Silence, you have tempted me enough
Begone, Satan! ln the name of Christ!
Luzbel! Luzbel! l accept your bargain l accept!
Sister, we have chosen you as our new Mother Superior
Do you accept?
Your virtue honors our community
Please accept
With you, we will all go to glory
Cease your penitence.
Guide us into the light
Sister Maria, lead us to Christ
Sister Maria, lead us to Christ
- Accept, Sister Maria
- Without you, we are lost
You are our guide
The purest
The most good
The most virtuous l had decided to die here, in torment
But if the community wants me, l accept
Even though there are others more deserving
See, l kept my promise.
You're no longer just a nun
Those in Hell do not see their imperfections ln air, fire and water their breath their own atmosphere...
...to reach their goal
Now you're Mother Superior their spiritual guide
Go on...
Go and enjoy yourself
But first...
Go to the balcony.
The town waits to greet its chosen one
Bye, Mother Superior!
Hail! Hail!
Hail the Mother Superior
Hail! Hail!
Hail the Mother Superior
Hail! Hail!
Hail the Mother Superior
All Sister Maria's suffering is over now
She's gone to the glory of God
So sad she was locked up like this
We tried to protect her from the plague
Yet it still took her life
Let's pray for the eternal rest of her soul
- Well?
- Yes, Mother Superior...
...Sister Maria has gone to heaven
After seven days of suffering she finally gave up her spirit l'll arrange for a Mass, and the funeral
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to see
an unforgettable show:
A film destined to become immortal,
as immortal as the music
which will follow,
and which will be interpreted
through animation.
Beginning with his childhood fantasies,
the greatest ambition
that burns and swells
within the soul of every creative animator
is to illustrate music,
to give visual form and color to its notes.
With this film
we have finally succeeded
in achieving this union
of animation and classical music,
a union we are sure is destined
to live on throughout the history of film.
A new and original film that has even astonished us, the men responsible, the men who, quite modestly speaking, can be called its creators.
A film in which... in which...
A film in which you will see the music and listen to the drawings.
You might call it a film of magic, a fantasia.
Hello?
Yes. Who's speaking?
Who is this?
What do you mean, who am I?
Who is it you wish to speak to?
California?
It's Hollywood.
Hello! Yes.
What? You've already...
I don't understand. I'm sorry.
You've already done this?
Look, if this is some kind of joke,
I'm in no mood...
There must be some misunderstanding.
You're very ill-mannered.
That's right... ill-mannered and a liar!
Yes, I said you're a liar!
A liar from California!
It's nothing. They're mad.
Mad as hatters.
They insist that our film... this is all so ridiculous... was already made by a certain fellow years ago.
A certain someone by the name of Prisney or Grisney.
Some American.
In any case, before you go around opening your big mouth, see the film first!
Where were we?
Settle down now.
Damned hags!
What's this racket?
Calm down!
All right, let's go.
Hurry up! No time to lose.
The film's already started.
Run!
Move it!
Get the lead out!
Come on!
Get in the car.
It's time you earned your keep.
We haven't kept you here out of charity!
Where are our instruments?
They're already at the theater, along with your clothes.
Hold on tight when we get moving.
You wouldn't want to hurt yourself now of all times, would you?
Pisney has already done this?
Let's go!
Hiring an orchestra wasn't a problem.
But the principle challenge that remained was to secure the creative collaboration of a true artist.
A free artist.
Free of all conditioning, free of all compromise, an animator capable of independent self-expression.
How's it going?
You look more cheerful than usual.
You knew this was your big day, huh?
Tell the truth.
You knew it!
Finding the ideal artist to create
our animation was no small task.
We had to bind him...
bind him to ourselves
in a contract based on trust
and mutual respect.
Come on, now.
After five years hanging around, you can't be tired!
That's good.
On your feet.
Hurry, the orchestra's waiting.
Can't you hear it?
Let's go!
Wash your dentures if you want to play trombone.
Kick the drums, not me, thank you.
- I'll do whatever I want.
- Kick her!
If they hadn't put me in the first row,
I wouldn't have done it.
I made it clear
I wouldn't do nude scenes.
Where are you going?
The movie world is dreadful.
I've always defended my virtue.
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.
This has never been done...
Just a moment.
And so it's come! The great moment...
I said wait a minute.
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.
The only thing missing now is the orchestra conductor!
Girls, babes, beauties, let's get started with Debussy's
Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.
A wonderful piece!
There'll certainly be lots to inspire our artist's imagination as he renders this music in visual form and gives it new life.
Yes, relying on nothing more than his trusty pencil,
I'm sure he'll succeed in bringing new life... in bringing new life to this great piece of music.
The artist creates!
Ready, girls?
The Debussy piece!
Good. Really great.
Sit down or I'll hang you back on the wall!
Sit down!
I did not enjoy that.
You didn't entertain me!
Quite an afternoon, eh?
Granny!
How do you feel?
A bit scattered, maestro.
Pick up all the pieces, and don't miss any!
Cheer up!
Everything's all right.
I'm feeling a bit scattered, maestro.
How's it going, girls?
Everyone all right?
Suppose we try some simple exercises.
Stand up... and sit down.
And up... and down again.
Hey, you there.
Me?
Come with me for a minute.
Do as he says.
Come along, granny.
You look a little pale, and your reflexes are a bit impaired.
It's nothing.
You'll get over it.
It's not easy maintaining order in an orchestra.
It calls for an iron fist in a velvet -
Glove! An iron first in a velvet glove.
Girls, our second piece will be Dvorak's Slavic Dance No. 7.
Mind you, the tempo is allegro.
Poor guy hasn't even noticed yet!
Take a break, everyone!
Bohemia crystal.
Fruit, uh... exotic fruit.
Chicken.
A potato.
We're catching on fire here.
Me too!
Is it good?
So, maestro, what's next on the program?
Ravel's Bolero.
Ah, Ravel's Bolero.
And who wrote that?
Ravel.
Of course. Ravel's Bolero was written by Ravel. Who else?
Ravel's Bolero. A great piece!
Ravel, the great, uh...
French composer.
- French, right?
- Yeah.
At least on his mother's side.
His father was from Umbria.
Born in Gubbio, if I'm not mistaken.
In the very heart of Umbria.
"Bolero"is a magical word.
A fantasy of color and sound.
There are thousands of ways to describe
this great musical work.
Go over there and grab the chicken.
Go on!
...in a "bolerian" vein.
Ravel's Bolero.
We didn't come here to stuff our faces.
I think this is the end of Part One.
END OF PART ONE
PART TWO
What's that ape doing here?
There's no ape in the script.
Other animals, yes, but no ape.
Reminds me of a young man I met back in 1912, before the First World War.
They just don't make men like that anymore.
Snow in the theater.
A very bad sign.
Let me go!
This can't be happening!
What is he doing?
He's getting the women too excited!
I knew it. When I get nervous, my eye clamps shut.
The next piece is
Sibelius' Valse Triste.
And you better get it right, or I'll hang you back up on the wall.
Remember the wall?
Bravo!
What feeling!
We can't go on like this.
The pieces turn out too sad!
He has no sense of humor!
I'm gonna put him back on the wall!
He'll rot in chains!
Calm down, now!
Aren't we equally to blame?
An artist needs beauty in order to express himself best, and frankly speaking, those particular girls may not be ideal.
Nonsense! Art is art!
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.
What if we were to find him a woman?
A woman he could be with.
Then he'd really start creating.
It'd be perfect!
I'm going to find one.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
Mr. Artist, how's it going?
You look a bit run-down.
I've got some fun for you.
I know a cozy little hideaway.
Come back here.
Get in there.
You know what we want.
Easy as falling off a log.
You get in the piano, and nature will do the rest.
Go on, now!
Hello, everyone!
Our orchestra, such as it is, the piano, and our artist.
Try to cheer him up.
Want a hand?
The next piece promises to be lively and full of spice.
A concerto by Vivaldi.
Think we're overdoing it?
Let's get him out.
Yeah, looks like they're having too much fun.
That should be enough.
Lift up the lid.
That's the snag with these old pianos.
Getting in is a breeze, but getting out can be a problem.
You better make me laugh now, or I'll tear you apart piece by piece!
He looks better already.
He'd better, or I'll see that he does!
He's much more alive.
Look at his eyes!
I'll tear them out!
You'll see.
The next piece will be fantastic!
Get ready.
Curtain!
Curtain!
I'll show you!
I'll take this pianist and throw her on your head!
I'll break every bone in your body!
It's all right!
It's nothing, nothing at all.
Just a little misunderstanding.
Let her go, will you?
A small difference of opinion.
It's absolutely nothing.
Turn the camera around.
It's nothing at all.
The next number on our program is the famous Firebird, by Igor Stravinsky.
A very famous piece.
Knock it off!
Turn the camera around.
Igor Stravinsky.
One of the most renowned...
A cascade of notes.
It's music that...
Let me go!
I don't have insurance!
Put me down!
Voilà!
Everything is just fine.
The conductor is taking just a few moments to himself, but he'll be back with us very soon.
Okay. Where's the camera?
Where is the camera?
Ah, there it is.
With that little interruption behind us, our performance will now continue with Dostoyevsky's Firebird.
As they say in English...
Which in Italian would mean...
A snake!
Stop! Where are you going?
Come back!
It's just a snake!
Stop!
We've got antidote for snake bite!
There's no problem!
We've got tons of antidote!
Damn it, you old hags! Stop!
Do you hear? Stop, I say!
Traitors!
Leaving me at a time like this.
I even have a cold.
And all because of a little snake.
Look! There's nothing left!
Everything's destroyed!
And here we are once again!
Now for a finale of a different sort, one we had planned and prepared.
One that needs neither orchestra nor conductor nor music.
I'm happy to say our artist is still here with us.
Our artist who...
What are you doing?
What the devil are you doing?
Drawing her?
What do you think you're doing?
You can't leave me here like this!
Hey, wait a second!
Wait for me!
I'm going with you!
I want to go too!
Wait!
Don't go!
How will we finish the film?
We haven't done a finale!
Wait for me!
We have to do a finale!
I have to find a good idea for a finale.
The telephone!
That's it! I'll call the archives.
Hello, Franceschini?
You have to help me find a finale!
Any finale at all.
The files are full of'em!
Bring me one right away!
A finale.
It's all over.
Ready, girls?
We've got to do Stravinsky's Firebird.
It's over with.
The finale, then.
That's all over with too.
You might as well go back down there.
We're unemployed, then.
Unemployed... until the next movie.
I've already got an idea.
A brand-new idea.
We could do a love story.
A love story?
But not the usual kind about men and women.
Lots of men with lots of women.
Wife-swapping?
No, not that same old stuff.
Something different.
I like asymmetry.
Seven men and one woman.
That'll cost a lot.
No, not at all.
We'll get little tiny men... and we'll make the woman real tall.
It'll be fantastic!
Sounds scary.
Careful.
What do you mean, scary?
Seven little workers, so you get the social context, too.
A mine! They'll work in a mine!
I can see them now, singing happily.
Have you thought of a title?
That'll be easy. Let's see.
"Sleeping Beauty."
Now, keep it under your hat or some screenwriter hack might steal the idea.
You can't trust anyone these days.
He'll change the title, play up the sex, and give it some crazy name like
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
And then we'll be screwed!
THE FANTASTIC PLANET
She stopped moving.
Now we can't play with her any more.
Careful! It's Mr. Sihn.
Look, father.
A female Om and her baby.
Is she dead?
I'm afraid so, Tiwa.
Why does the baby make noise?
It's either frightened or hungry.
We can't leave him.
May I keep him?
Let me, father.
I'll take care of him.
All right, Tiwa, we can't let the animal die.
He was the Great Master of the Traag people.
He saved my life and took me into his home.
Mother!
Mother!
See how cute the little Om is!
His mother's dead.
I want to keep him.
He is very pretty, Tiwa.
You disturbed your mother's Meditation!
Make that animal behave or I'll take it away!
Father, he got away.
He needs a collar.
Learn to use the Watch.
Now put the animal down.
It's fun. Let me try.
No so fast.
The animal is delicate.
You might hurt it.
Did you name it?
Tiwa, like me.
That's not an Om's name.
Name it Frisky or Trusty.
Watch him wiggle, the little devil!
I'll name him Terr.
I was forgotten!
A baby Om is nothing compared to Meditation!
A weird virtual.
Traags devoted most of their time to it.
It seemed to be chief concern.
Oddly enough, the housing unit factory on our Uva at Goham... has not met production levels.
The machines show unusual wear...
This wear causes the delay.
Master Taj, can you explain?
We don't know yet.
Meanwhile we’ll use machines from our reserve... to meet the schedule.
I don't understand.
The machines worked perfectly until now.
Have you had similar problems on other Uvas?
Only machines from our space flight... to planet Antax 4 have trouble completing their program.
Master Sihn, our scientists... explain this loss as a break in the sensory compensation system.
Scientists also notice that animals brought from planet Terra... have sovibon and rather high intelligence.
I am not sure that is true.
Obviously, the animal adapts rather well.
But is that intelligence?
The little pet you stroke... between Meditations may well... surprise you some day.
Films made in Terra show many traces of organized life.
This ability to adapt, Master Kon may indicate advanced evolution.
Oms have a much shorter life span that we.
But we must not forget that they multiply much more rapidly.
If the animal is intelligent,
Master Sihn... we have not yet noticed.
What we do notice is the considerable damage... caused by Oms on the Uvas of Jext and Telez.
The numbers of tame Oms is easy to control.
But wild Oms probably exist... in much larger numbers than most of us realize.
We de-om the enclaves... of wild Oms every 3 cycles.
But I wonder if... that is often enough.
Few weapons have a long-term effect.
Drastic measures must be taken.
New ways to fight them are being researched.
I doubt if they will suffice.
Go play somewhere else.
I'm very sorry.
Imagination was so rich today too...
That Om is a pest!
Please, our children all love those animals.
I grew up fast in that slow world.
A Traag week was equal to one of my years.
I was only a live plaything.
I was sometimes rebellious.
Tiwa loved me.
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!
Tiwa got her learning from a headphone.
Its lessons cut directly into the brain... engraved on the memory forever.
"Our Planet Ygam has one satellite...
"the Fantastic Planet.
It is uninhabited
"and used for Meditation.
"Ygam is divided into several Uvas.
"Uvas Strop and Yot are natural and symmetrical.
"Urtana, the largest Uva, is covered
"with blue assonic blocks.
"Its temperature range...
"is from 8 to 243 laics...
"making ripocal exploitation impossible...
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea...
"stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laics.
"Fixations bloc offset pontic rebation.
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure.
"All Uvas under go a cycle of 3 seasons of unequal length.
"The seasons of garus crystalization..."
An accident enabled me to acquire the Traags knowledge.
"When the soil peels, intense vegetation..."
"replaces all nosks with similar nosks."
I liked the lessons.
I tried to get the most out of them.
"The cliffs on the fepular sea are eroded...
"by rains that often last long."
Tiwa, bring your animal!
Jurgal has his and we'll have some fun.
I don't want him hurt.
Jurgal's animal is insane!
Once, he almost tore off his ears!
He won't damage your Om.
Come and play!
Come and see!
Let Terr fight, it will be more fun.
Terr will win, he's a real demon!
Now fight!
He sings well.
Terr can sing too.
Sing, Terr. Go on!
- He'll strangle him!
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
What a mean animal!
"It is simple to see a tark's fladed muscles...
"because the animal's easily skinned..."
Do you hear the Om?
That's Tiwa's lesson!
She loves Terr so much that he is with her always.
Can he understand what he says?
I don't think so.
Anyway, I'll forbid her to keep Terr during infos.
She must study seriously.
"The liscinian muscle of a trak's leg...
"is a fleshy, fuliform vilok...
"The molog is an enviparous animal...
"It has more than half a billion lucons.
"The entire surface of their walls...
"is made up of little cells...
"separated by leaves of thin organure."
"Some scientists...
"today believe it is not organure but only gambous amalga...
" an artificial structure... "
Have you got Terr again during you info?
I told you to stop!
Into the Omhouse!
But father, he doesn't bother me...
And he's so happy.
The infos are for you!
Get back to work!
It was time for the Traag children to have their first Meditation...
The initiation ceremony was a major step... on their road to knowledge.
After a while
I lost my intimacy with Tiwa.
As she grew up, she gave up her playthings.
Deprived of lessons,
I decided to run away.
Mother, I can't find Terr.
And my headphones are gone.
Use your bracelet!
If he's far away, it'll hurt him.
Put your bracelet on maximum, please.
No, mother...
You're pretty stupid.
Like all tame Oms!
You have a collar too.
It’s a fake, to fool the Traags.
What's that?
The Traags invented it.
What?
The Traags made it.
Listen!
"Valio, cycle, info 4...
"You will observe that Aklon research...
"in solid pernetrope...
"works the same as in plane pernetrope.
"Notice that we look for festation groups..."
Don't worry, it's not dangerous.
Where are you taking it?
- I don't know.
- Come with me!
My new friend took me to her people who lived hidden in the Big Tree. deep in an abandoned park.
As a silly tame Om, my first meeting with wild Oms was a failure.
Don't touch that case, it's a trap!
Since I brought the headphones of knowledge... the wizard opposed me at once!
We've brought 5 cases, Chief.
What? Is that all?
One of them was a trap and Speed is dead.
He knew it was a trap.
He's a tame Om.
He ran away with a Traag device.
It taught him to read Traag writing.
He knows what's in the cases?
In that one?
Color powder.
"Urtana is covered with blue assonic blocks.
"Its temperature range is from 8 to 243 laiks...
"making ripocal exploitation impossible.
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea
"stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laiks.
"Fixations blocks...
"offset ontic rebation.
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure..."
Why interrupt the info?
Traag knowledge is bad.
We don't need it.
We are not tame Oms.
It is great offense!
You must battle according to the Law.
Bring the combat animals!
You win. Stay with us Oms of the Big Tree.
You can be of use to us.
Tomorrow we go on an expedition.
It was my first expedition to steal Traag food.
We brought a great deal back.
Be brave, the Big Tree isn't far.
The Hollow-Bush bandits!
Look out!
Why attack us?
They're from the Hollow Bush.
Beware of them.
They are thieves from the other side of the park.
The Great Zarek
3000 cycles before Krowp...
"created the pyramidic civilization.
"From his tomb - they say he still animates...
"the ball of Life.
"Projectiles pierce him but he does not change.
"His mind travels through Ygam's skies...
"regularly ever since he led the Traags...
"to victory against the Jankos.
"This may well be how Meditation originated.
"Some believe that Zarek is immortal and...
"that from the flames of time he reappears in infinitely varied...
"whirling reality...
"to combat the Traags will to die.
"Actually
"driving out the Jankos made...
"the Traags develop a spirit of enterprise..."
The Oms are learning if only we had more headphones.
You know as much as the Traags.
I am barely learning to write.
Look.
Are you sure?
Did you read it right?
All the park walls read "de-om"!
What does it mean?
The Traags want to kill all the Oms!
Long ago...
I saw them de-om the park.
It was horrible!
But now on our tree, there's not much danger.
What will we do?
- It had to come.
- Anyway, we have time to prepare.
We'll post sentries.
They'll slaughter us... to punish us for stealing knowledge.
Let us pray to the Fantastic Planet.
Sentries will warn us when they come.
Tomorrow we shall see.
What are you doing on our land?
I came to warn you.
The Traags intend to de-om the park.
De-om!
You don't say!
How do you know?
One of us read it on the wall!
Can Big-Tree Oms read Traag writing now?
Don't listen to him!
It's a trap to get us out of the Hollow Bush!
Believe me, the Traags will de-om!
Take him away!
Someone go look at the walls!
Listen!
- Traags!
- Quiet!
I smell Oms here.
That vermin!
The Masters should... de-om more often!
It's not bad to have pet Oms...
They're fun.
But all those wild Oms...
They steal.
They're dirty and multiply appallingly fast.
Look...
A nest by the walk.
See... A whole colony.
Let's kill Them.
Chief is dead.
Stop weeping like children.
We must go where the Traags can't find us.
I know a place,
I'll take you there.
This road leads to an abandoned rocket dump.
We'll be safe there.
I regret that we de-om only every 3 cycles!
This killing proves it is not enough!
A Traag murdered!
It's unbelievable!
Are we so weak that Oms can kill us... so easily?
Wild Oms are much more numerous than we thought.
The body showed many... bites and wounds, said Traag who managed to escape slaughter.
Oms' bites were very numerous.
Every day wild Oms become bolder!
They multiply at a terrifying rate!
Master Sihn, it is disturbing to note that your Uva at Telez is not the only one that has been very difficult to de-om.
Two other Uvas...
Goham and Urtana... have had similar problems...
Near the murdered Traag we found... two surprisingly well organized lairs.
Most disturbing of all was... that in one of the lairs... cases were sorted according to contents.
But they were unopened.
How could the Oms know what they contained?
It is high time to take efficient measures!
I suggest we de-om twice a cycle.
I also request strict regulation of breeding... and selling of tame Oms.
Too often they turn wild again... and go join the throngs of Oms... living in parks and other isolated areas.
We must use the new, much-discussed de-om-ing devices at last.
We must exterminate all wild Oms.
And I ask you:
Should we keep our tame Oms?
We are wrong to believe Oms are merely vicious animals.
If we do, we may commit... an error of serious consequences.
Ygam had..
3 seasons equal to...
15 of our years.
The Traag rocket graveyard was abandoned.
There we built our city.
We planned to go to the Fantastic Planet.
Many tame and wild Oms came to join us.
Knowledge acquired from the headphones... enabled us to reduce...
Traag rockets... to our size.
"Trinur is a metal that palsifies Matwar
"top-grade reculid gives it a remarkable metallic shine."
We have succeeded, Terr.
Two rockets are for testing.
We will start with those.
- It's only a matter of work and time.
- We must hurry!
Om informers say... that a large-scale de-om-ing is near!
They may know where we are.
We must send up our two rockets at once... to see if we can live on the Fantastic Planet.
We cannot wait any longer!
Too bad. I can't go with you.
I'm not afraid.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
I know you will build... a new world where Oms can be happy... far away from the Traags.
The Fantastic Planet will be our planet... a world for our children.
You must go!
You must hurry!
You must...
We had discovered the secret of the Traags.
The Spheres of Meditation there enabled Traags to meet... beings from other galaxies and hold strange nuptial rites.
This union gave them vital energy which they needed... and enabled them to reproduce.
We were afraid...
The statues feet might damage our rockets.
We found the only weak point of the Traags.
On Ygam, the de-om-ing was halted.
Never have the Traags been in such great danger!
Our entire civilization is threatened!
The Oms are taking revenge.
They have incredible scientific knowledge.
They must be stopped!
It may be too late.
Neither Oms nor Traags... will profit from destruction.
We must try to make peace.
"Since the Sihn era,
"the Traag civilization has undergone a remarkable evolution.
"The Oms, instructed by our philosophy and...
"technology...
"now provide the Traags with...
"dynamics and a new way of thinking.
Our planet now has two satellites, one natural and one artificial.
"The natural one, the Fantastic Planet...
"is kept for Traag Meditation.
"The artificial one was made by Oms.
They named it Terr.
"Oms live in huge cities on the various Uvas."
Jump back, baby.
Fritz, did you go down and see the welfare people today?
Yeah. They told me to report someplace tomorrow.
I got it written down on a piece of paper, I think.
Listen, are you gonna go?
I don't know. Let's fuck.
Then will you go out and look for a job like you said?
What? Did I say that?
Man, oh, man, am I stoned!
How is it a grown man can spend so much time... just dreaming about what he's gonna do for his family?
For Christ's sakes!
Will you come down to Earth?
What we need is the basic staff of life!
Like grub!
I never saw anybody walking around more stoned than you.
Always stoned!
Where do you get the money to buy that grass?
Will you tell me?
You and your Acapulco Gold.
You know what that is?
That's shit!
Which is what you are!
You are shit, Fritz!
Here's something you don't know.
Harvey and I made it.
What do you think of that?
We made it, and he's better in bed than you are.
You know why?
He's hung like a horse.
What about you?
You're nothing.
You're nothing in the living room.
You're nothing in the bathroom.
You're nothing in bed.
You don't even change the damn roller on the toilet paper.
I'm the one that uses that mostly.
And what about putting the seat down?
Why don't you ever do that?
Why don't you take that chicken-shit grin off your face?
Fritz! You're a no-good!
How much can a person take?
And why don't you ever put the goddamn seat down... when you're through peeing?
You rotten putz, you!
That's all you do is sit around.
I never saw anything like it in my entire life!
You know what
I would like to do to you?
I would like to take you and shake you... until all your teeth fall right onto the floor... and then you know what I'd do?
I'd stamp on them, all the teeth... and I'd make them right into powder.
And then I'd sprinkle the powder right over your head.
And then I would knock you right in the goddamn face!
I'd like to pulverize you!
I'd take your nose... and I'd put it across the room on the wall.
I'd like to knock you into next week sometimes!
This is it, Fritz.
I'm really sore.
Now, I'm really sore.
I am sick to death!
I'm gonna tell you one time and one time only... so you better listen to me... because if you don't listen to me now...
I ain't gonna say it again.
I'll go out and get myself a two by four... and beat your fucking head in!
You are gonna pick up after yourself.
From now on, I'm through picking up after you.
And you will put the seat down on that goddamn toilet!
I'm telling you one time and one time only.
You're a no-good bum, and I've had it with you, Fritz!
I have had it with you!
And let me tell you something else.
I know you play around.
Don't try to lie to me.
You don't even have a guilty look on your face.
You really don't give a goddamn.
I know that you're playing around.
Don't think I haven't seen you.
I get telephone calls from girls.
They call me up.
God knows why they want you.
Don't they know how shitty you are in bed?!
Hey, man, don't do that.
What? Do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
What the hell are you laying on me, man?
I ain't laying nothing on you, man.
It's what you laid on me.
No need to be crude.
God damn it, you freaking out or something?
Look, Juan, if we can just cash this welfare check... we can get us some Rip Bull or maybe even some muscatel.
Kiss off, dude!
That's your problem.
You ain't got the guts to admit when you're wrong.
You just passed gas at me, man, and that's uncool.
Oh, wow.
Don't have the guts to confess you're a goddamn coward.
You're just like my sister.
Well, you P.R.s are hypersensitive, you know?
I thought you and me were friends.
A little wig out,
I'm a religion now, huh?
A P.R., huh? Nice.
Hey, about your sister,
Juan... does she have big tits?
I wish you people would learn to speak English.
Christ knows we were here first.
It's the only way I talk to a man who has habits like a pig.
Man, don't be that way.
Let's get some wine and go see your sister... and maybe we can get it on.
Beats the hell out of freezing our balls off, right?
No deal, man.
I can't trust you no more.
I can't let you fuck my sister, you know?
You got no class, man.
You wouldn't let me fuck your sister.
Why should I let you fuck mine?
Listen, your sister is some piece of ass.
I know, man. Yeah.
My sister?
Wow, man,
I can't believe that.
Yeah, man, you better believe it.
She was a female creature of tender passion... of simple earthen charm, you know?
Wow, dude, that's good.
Yeah, you could say that.
Juan, you better get back in the phone booth again.
I feel a fart coming on.
Check it out.
We done came all the way across town... done caught busses and cars and hitchhiked to get here... then put on our best clothes... so we can walk in this neighborhood... so we can get in one of these white houses... to rip off one of them
$400 televisions... one of them $300 watches... one of them
Panasonic, rena-sonic... exto-sonic, plesto-plastic stereos.
With the quadro-flex, modu-lextic... medu-modula needles and shit...
Big-time shit, man.
I ain't never heard of nothing like that.
You ain't in this community, blood!
That's why we came here, you know what I'm saying?
You don't know what you doing, man.
I also be doing this big-time organizing and shit.
You ripping off washing machines and toilet paper.
Unusual odd shit.
Now you know why we here.
OK, now... we gonna crawl in this here window, all right?
You take the downstairs, and I'll take the upstairs.
Why is it that I always got to take the downstairs?
Beause you don't like jumping out of windows, man.
Shit!
Now, will you cut that out, Fritz?
Hey!
The beauty of cannabis.
And then once we get inside, get everything-- don't get no washing machines-- then leave.
Somebody's home!
Doesn't it fill you with joy?
Is that cat smoking?
The unfettered exuberance, the lust for life?
It makes you...
Look how he's smoking weed. want to drop your phony inhibitions... and love your fellow man?
Look at that chick with them titties!
Or brother, maybe.
Doesn't it? Huh?
It is Juan's sister.
Don't you kind of see things more clearly, huh?
That's right.
Take a good, long drag, sis.
Now breathe in the smoke.
Deep.
It'll help clear your sinuses.
Hey, I feel light-headed.
That is Juan's sister, man!
He's going to the store!
Looks like a feature film, you know what I mean?
Right on.
Will it really expand my...awareness?
Well, you know what they say...
"Take tea and see."
Doesn't clear my sinuses at all.
Daddy says you're only good for getting the papers.
Is that all you're good for, Fritz?
That's some kick, huh?
You know the most interesting thing about smoking?
It causes excessive perspiration... and a person has to take off all his clothes.
Otherwise, he can drown to death in his own juices.
Now, this activity is like artificial respiration.
Smoke some more of this shit.
Fuck them.
If I get up in this pad,
I got the downstairs--
-Hold it in.
-I'll knock it out.
You'd knock it out, you'd what?
I love my brother's friends.
Man, he ought to put a bag over that ugly bitch's head.
Stick her head in the couch, man.
Before I stick my thing in her...
-Look at them fuck.
-Man, hold up.
Makes me kind of horny, man.
-Yeah.
-Let's rob.
Duck, man. There's a car coming up the driveway.
I bet it's her old man.
Is this good for the liver?
Oh, Fritz. That's good!
Chita!
That's the ugliest motherfucker.
Daddy!
Look at that snaggle-toothed... big, greasy, fucking nasty pig.
Gee, pops, maybe I should go get the papers, huh?
Papers?! Why, you, you!
Little son of a bitch.
What do you want, pops,
News or the Times?
Pink commie bastard!
Shit.
I guess you killed him, right in the ass.
I guess we can't rob this pad today, huh?
We'll come back tomorrow.
My sister was once in psychoanalysis.
She says you're a boy who would fuck his mother.
And what have you done for Ralphie?
Other than to teach him how to masturbate?
And left-handed, no less.
You must be new around here.
I haven't seen your face before.
My old lady kicked me out of the house.
I've had this streak of bad luck lately... and she's been making noise
I should go find work.
What'd you say, something about work?
Everybody knows that's what kills a man.
Starts out with an eight-hour day... forty hours a week... and, hell, boy, before you know it... you're married to some fine-ass woman and buying a house.
I'll help you.
Yeah, that's terrible.
Work is terrible.
What the hell do you get for it, anyway?
Jeez, I don't know.
It's just money is all.
It's evil.
I tell you, it's evil.
It all starts from having to work.
Now, if you don't have to work... why, you don't get any money.
You know what I mean?
It's that simple.
Yeah. That's what
I try to tell my old lady.
She sent my ass down to the welfare office again... and those creeps started to hit on me... about receiving public assistance for over a year... and here was my last--
Are you OK?
It's my last check and all... and I had failed to find employment again.
It's just too much bullshit, so I split.
It doesn't pay to hit the big time.
-No.
-Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Well, you got any plans, son?
Oh, yeah.
I figured I'd settle down here.
Get away from all the zipper-heads uptown.
Not get involved with all the extemporaneous bullshit.
And, hey, by the way, what's your name?
Oh, I'm God.
Wow, man, that is heavy.
You're really God, huh?
No shit?
You OK?
I've been God for about three and a half years now.
A lot of responsibility, you know.
I'll bet.
Also, I'm black belt karate.
No shit?
Wow, this really blows my mind.
Me, I'm standing here rapping with God.
Far out!
You want to be my assistant?
Well...
I might be forced to give up my job.
I can't keep busting my ass this here way.
Anyway, I've been into some heavy gear in one of my lives.
I got nine of them, pal.
I got hung up with the weirdest dude one time... you could ever imagine.
This guy I'm thinking of was really psycho... you wouldn't believe it.
Jesus.
Wow, God, you really do some weird shit, you know?
Make the fucking world in seven days--try it sometime.
Work your vanilla!
Oh, the Yanks are coming!
And remember, your fathers and mothers... and all of your Fatherland will be watching you.
Envying in the great glory... for which you have been selected... you all have promised to die for the Fuhrer.
Who wants to be next?
Ooh! Oh, Mama!
Mama, was Papa ever like this?
Mein Fuhrer, the bombs have just killed your orderly!
Ah, another orderly gone.
Get me another one!
Order another orderly quickly!
Another orderly quickly!
Another orderly!
Another orderly for the Fuhrer!
Put up an "Out of Orderly" sign!
-Harder!
-I get excited! Good!
My Lenore!
My liebchen!
Ohh! Hans!
I mean, he was--ohh!
Hans, I'm sorry. I--
Stand aside!
Oh, he was so wonderful!
Oh, Hans!
I mean, he was--
My aching swastika!
I thought being a Nazi as all "Sieg, Sieg"... and "Sieg Heil!"
This is for shit!
I better get my ass the fuck out of here.
War is hell!
Mein Fuhrer, here are the candidates for your orderly.
Heil Hitler!
Sieg heil!
That one!
I want that one!
Him! That's him!
Excuse me, Fuhrer.
I didn't mean to stare.
What is it? You see something missing maybe?
No, no!
Everything's fine... but you've only got one ball.
Everybody in the Third Reich has to do without something!
I see.
When the Fuhrer is naked, everyone is naked!
Well, here I am, aren't l?
Hi.
Imbecile. Imbecile.
Don't you know what is expected of you now?
What? I think you dropped something.
What? I dropped something?
I put the soap in your hand, you see... and you seem to have let it go.
Dropped it, like... almost like you weren't interested in washing at all!
I was not conscious of this.
It is simple to see,
Mein Fuhrer.
You're real motivations are blocked here.
Blocked?
What is blocked?
It's a new word.
It means what's inside can't get outside.
Some kind of
Freudian horseshit.
Oh, inside, can't get out...
You're a nice boy.
I'm going to make a confession.
Sometimes, I would like to be a ballet dancer.
Really? No kidding?
I often see myself in the opera.
Oh, wow.
And the people are applauding me!
Well, sure they would.
There you go! You see?
That means this whole number you're doing-- this conquest of the world thing... or whatever it is, is just to get attention.
Interesting you should say that... but I am washing, see, now?
So why did I drop the soap?
Well, that, my dear Herr Hitler... is a question you must ask yourself... when you wrestle with the true identity, you know.
I mean, in the dawning of self-awareness... between you and your pillow, man... when after the labors of sleepless nights... you gained the exalted heights of the altar of truth!
You have insight.
When I see something
I want, I grab it.
Sure, why not?
And my stomach doesn't stop to ask my head if it's hungry.
No, that figures.
By the way, what is your name?
Fritz.
Well, Fritz, you say you once had three balls?
Yeah.
Would you like to try for one?
I don't--Sir!
Listen--OK, OK!
Now, look,
I'm gonna pick up the soap.
I am. Just wait.
I'm gonna bend over now.
Just...
I'm gonna--
Hey, watch it, will ya?!
Mein Fuhrer, wait!
Oh, my God, wait!
Ich bin der fuhrer!
Gee, Fuhrer, now you got no balls.
Mein Fuhrer!
Gentlemen, we can no longer continue.
War is just a question of balls.
Ja, balls.
Goebbels.
Goebbels, are you not... my most loyal and truthful assistant?
Jawohl, Mein Fuhrer.
Did you not invent the slogan which binds all us Nazis?
Jawohl, Mein Fuhrer.
And what is that slogan?
Death before dishonor.
What an asshole slogan.
You can always change the slogan.
You must think of Fraulein Braun.
She needs you.
Ja, think of Eva.
How she would miss you, Adolf.
That's right.
After all, who could take my place?
Sieg heil!
I got that Nazi rat bastard... right between the crack in his ass!
Now how do those sons of bitches expect to win a war... when they're out of goddamn uniform, huh?
I don't have any time to do anything for myself!
I don't even have time to get myself a new diaphragm!
If you hold it up to the light, you can see little pinholes.
Fritz, I'm tired of plugging it up with Chapstick!
Out of my shop.
I won't cash your check... and there's no such thing as a refund on those things... just 'cause you say it don't fit quite right.
But it's never been used, Niki.
I'll even take a prorated refund.
It was used!
Well, only a little, a quickie.
And I bet I know who this was used on, too, huh?
OK, Niki, you're on.
Try to guess who.
Let's see now.
With your filthy taste...
Iet's see, it must be a fat one, right?
Yeah, right. Go on.
And I just bet she sweat a lot, and she smell like a goat, huh?
Right.
And she's got bad breath, no teeth?
Yes! Go on!
You're getting warmer!
And she's got big, hairy... goddamn moustache on the top lip!
Oh, you got me, Niki.
You got me nailed, man.
And I'll bet... that fucking whore been with every guy on this block, right?
Right!
Niki, you're a genius!
Niki, you only left out one thing.
What did I leave out, Fritz?
You know what?
She's got the clap!
That's right!
How could I skip that?
That's a nice one.
She got to have the clap, right?
She has to.
-Hey, Fritz.
-Shit.
Fritz, I'll tell you something.
You're not so bad, you know?
Maybe I'll cash your check after all.
Hey, Fritz, tell me... what's this fat whore pig's name, huh?
-What's the broad's name?
-Gina.
-Hey, Fritz.
-What?
That's a-my wife's name.
Gina is my wife's name.
She don't have the clap.
She does now.
Why, you--
You fucking cat,
I rip your balls off!
Get the fuck out of my shop!
Fuck off! You fucking cat!
I kill you!
I fuck you in the ass!
Fritz, man, what's all this noise about, man?
I can hear all the way from the alley.
Don't even come here!
Aw, nothing.
Niki can't take a joke.
He takes things too seriously.
It's hard not to around here.
Gets pretty fucking deadly sometimes.
I heard it was better years ago, you know what I mean?
But, Lenny, things have always been, more or less... up-and-down situation.
This street wasn't always a shit-house, let me tell ya.
And even as far back as the thirties... there were those who gave and those that took.
Aw, Fritz, but what do I do with this here thing?
You can have it.
I'm done with it anyway.
When I was back in the thirties...
I was one very sharp continental-type stud.
The only thing we have to fear is... fear itself.
People must have faith.
Together...we cannot fail.
And it is up to you... to support...and make it work.
Hey, putz!
Your idea of helping out with the gas shortage... was to stop eating pizza... and bring home four of your hooker friends... to sleep with us at night to stimulate heat.
Look, I don't know how you can own a business... and not be able to cash... this miserable pittance of a welfare check is all.
If I give you all my money...
I'll have nothing left to buy with.
Oh, Christ, then you are in luck, Morris.
Look at this. Knowing of your love for the unusual...
I've brought you something you won't be able to resist.
-I know it.
-Resist?
Believe me, I could resist.
Just look at it, Morris-- the design, the gentle contours.
Why, it's almost Louis Quinze for Christ's sake.
It's disgusting, for Christ's sake.
It's the type of item that will sell so fast... you'll be pleading for more inside of a week, believe me.
It's been used. I can tell.
What? Used?
By a little old lady.
A one-owner shitter-- and genteel.
That's gentile, you stupid bastard.
Don't get hosteel.
That's "hostile."
You're taking the wrong approach, Morris.
Now, some of my best friends are Jewish.
Do I look like the Chase Manhattan Bank?
You come in here with out-of-money look in your face.
Look like you got hit in the head with a foul pitch... and you want to sell me this.
But with inflation, the value of a dollar going down... my expenses skyrocketing...
Why, even this week, the price of a decent circumcision... something I shudder to think about.
I agree with you there... but what's that got to do with my toilet seat?
That's the point, my friend.
My old seder used to say to me...
"Morris, take a pickle.
It's made for eating."
The thing you're holding is made for shitting.
It's simple logic.
You could even be a Rockefeller.
It's tough to find a good pickle.
Socioeconomically speaking, you're absolutely correct, but--
Look, Fritz... the pickles are beginning to get to me.
And these days, a soft stool is too important to me... for something to quibble, so I'll make you a deal.
Tell you what I'm going to do.
You give me the seat,
I'll trade for you a bargain.
Where did you get this thing?
Questions--youth, all the time, questions.
Nowadays people don't know an opportunity... when it smacks them upside of the face.
I think I've been screwed.
With that, you could be the next man on the moon.
Fuck the moon.
I been further than that once.
That's no big deal.
I'd rather take a shit.
So would l.
Give me the seat.
I'm going to hit you on the top of the head.
This should cure you.
Here we go. I say heal!
Heal, Mr. Cobbs, heal!
Through the power vested in me by God, Jesus Christ...
I'm going to heal you, Mr. Cobb.
Hello, world.
This is the event mankind has been waiting for-- the first man launched to Mars.
Fritz, I got to tell you something right out in front.
If it wouldn't be for this fucking cold...
I'd be going all the way to Mars with you.
39 million miles--a drop kick.
But the doc says
I can't fly with this cold.
It's bad for the ears.
He said something about me popping a drum or something...
I don't know.
Jeez, I got to get some more Binaca.
Put that in my bring-ups, will you?
Fritz, you know how I hate to bother you... when you're getting near the pad... but we got to make a decision on the Poli-Grip account.
I can see you with a package of five spots... for the Japanese and Taiwan market.
Incidentally, the residuals will be unreal.
It's eight million yen for every thirteen-week cycle... and you don't have to declare it.
You know, there's a whole cult... of denture-adhesive freaks out there... just waiting for a leader.
Some of them still got their own teeth.
Am I bothering you with all this, Fritz?
My God, Fritz,
I got to get some air in here.
I feel myself slipping away.
Now, I know you're against charities... and benefits and freebies... but hear me out on this one, Fritzie.
There's a nationwide charity telethon coming up... the first of next month... for the further development of all-vegetable... organically-grown polyunsaturated Preparation H-- with suntan oil.
Jerry Lewis is going to be there--everybody.
And before you shut me off,
I got to tell you... the exposure will be sensational for you.
And we might even have a spin-off... on a new movie that's coming out... with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello... called "Beach Ball Piles."
Well, Fritz, I see we arrived at the pad... so this will give you some things to think about... on a 39-million mile trip.
And remember, Fritz, sweetheart,
I'd be with you all the way... it wouldn't be for this fucking cold.
Hot damn.
That chick wouldn't look bad... holding up a Hershey's bar, would she?
With nuts.
Ah, freedom of the press.
Jeez, I feel sorry for the poor slob.
I wouldn't make that trip with him with six points.
Hey, Fritz, baby, want to talk to Walter?
Sure. Why not?
Fritz, does being the first to set foot on Mars-- golly--kind of give you goose bumps?
Ahem. Gentlemen,
I've been up and down... the four corners of this big old world... and I've seen it all, and I've done it all.
I've fought many a good man and laid many a good woman.
And I've had riches, fame, and adventure, too.
Yes. I've stood eyeball-to-eyeball with death... countless times and never, never once squinted.
Oh, I've tasted life to the fullest... and still my tortured soul cries out--more!
More! Oh, shit!
God, can there be any more?
How do it feel, Fritz?
I mean,
Mars ain't around the corner.
You're so right.
Hey, would you like to discuss this in private?
Gee, you got a lovely pair of eyes.
In private?
Sure. Listen, doll...
I'd kind of like to give you a break.
You know, kind of help pay back... for what my people did to your people.
Yeah? What kind of a break?
Well, you know, an exclusive-- an inside story.
Fritz, wait a second!
Wait! Come on, what about us?
What about a statement?
Give us a break, man, come on.
Baby.
We interrupt this telecast of the first flight to Mars... for a message of real importance.
As chairman of the board of the Golf Oil company... with its 13,000 dealers from coast-to-coast...
I want to welcome you all to this momentous event.
When you drive into one of our Golf stations... say howdy to the man who polishes your window... and we'll say howdy right back at you.
At this very minute... you can look at one of our own Golf refineries... pumping away seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day... filling your tanks with gasoline.
We at Golf Oil are bringing you this telecast... in appreciation of the millions of happy Golf customers... when they say, "Fill 'er up."
What's that I hear?
Jeez, look at the money they put in that rocket.
You could buy time on "The Waltons"... for a year with that kind of bread.
I wonder how you put a deal like that together.
That's fascinating.
We have ignition.
Me, too!
Baby!
So unbelievable.
My brother-in-law would like a rocket like that.
Shit.
That's fascinating.
Gee, look at that.
Well, there he goes.
When he gets back, we'll make millions.
Jeez, I hope they got that explosion on tape.
It'd be perfect for our forest lawn spots.
Mr. Cobb. Heal, Mr. Cobb.
Yeah. Heal.
Through the power vested in me by God, Jesus Christ...
I'm going to heal you, Mr. Cobb.
Let me make one thing very clear--
I am not a crook.
Why don't you climb up off your ass?
Remember I was telling you you should get to be... a contestant on "Let's Make a Deal"?
I'll tell you what.
You dress up like a frog.
You look good in green.
And wear a yarmulke.
I think he likes Jewish people.
Man, am I hung up, strung out, and uptight.
Hey. God damn it,
I know that laugh.
Man, it couldn't be.
Hey, man. You in a bag.
Hey, Duke, is it really you?
No shit.
But I thought you were dead.
I thought they got you.
Fritz, you ain't changed a bit.
You still don't know where it's at.
What are you doing down here, anyway?
I'm looking for the true meaning of my existence, as usual.
I got tired of the pseudointellectuals... and the super-hype bullshitters running the world... determining my destiny.
You dig it?
And crushing my creative juices?
Now lay the straight line on me.
My old lady kicked my ass out.
That's what I figured.
But you know, Duke... it's going to be better for all of us, really.
No shit.
Ain't I heard that somewhere before?
That's no bullshit.
There's better days ahead,
I kid you not.
We brothers got some great times rolling our way, man.
-Now you brothers, huh?
-Right on.
Shit. No telling how black we'll be... by the time this little chat ends.
Take my word for it. I know.
Hey, Duke, you ever hear of New Jersey?
Sure.
You ever heard of Ray Charles?
Yeah. Hey, and I'll tell you... you crows are finally going to come into your own.
You wait and see.
Jive sucker come into the ghetto, talking some stuff.
Ought to cut the jive mother.
Twenty-five.
Ready, aim, fire!
Twenty-six.
Hey, man, your number's up.
Come on, let's get to this.
But--look, please, sir... you got the wrong guy, see?
Don't push!
At least let me tell you the way it happened, fella, huh?
Go over to the White House and pick up a package.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President.
You've got to do something.
Believe me, there's nothing to worry about.
Nothing to worry about?
This--what's his name...
Imaku.
Whatever--is suggesting... that New Africa make a federation with Cuba...
China, Africa, and Northern lreland.
I never did trust a nigger.
But you voted in favor of giving them New Jersey.
The final solution to the schwartzen problem... you said.
And we get rid of the Puerto Ricans... and you can't get a decent shoeshine... in the whole of America.
I haven't seen a decent football game in ten years.
Honduras beat us in the Olympics.
You know what that means?
We have a whole country full of niggers-- angry niggers, right across the river from New York.
They could fart and destroy Washington.
All we have to do... is keep President
Supreme Jackson in office.
Come in.
Mr. President,
I'm from the messenger service.
It's about time.
Now, deliver this to President Supreme Jackson.
In New Jersey?
I mean, New Africa?
Well, that's where he is.
But I heard these crows don't let whites in their country.
How long have you been... with the Red Arrow delivery service?
Today's my first day.
I used to be on welfare.
Go to the motor pool and get a car and a pass.
Yes, sir.
Remember, this is important... to our national security, so don't fail.
I won't fail, sir.
Please.
Stop kissing my hand.
-Yes, sir.
-And touching my palms.
Can I help you?
I want to see the man in charge.
I'm in charge here.
I came to get a car and a pass into New Africa.
OK, I'll get you a car and a pass to Niggerville.
This is a rotary engine Mazda.
Them niggers will steal anything they can.
No sense in risking a new car to go over there.
We ain't got anybody to wash 'em up no more.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Come here.
If you're going to New Africa...
I got a wife and kid over there.
They had to go with their people... when they gave the blacks
New Jersey.
-No shit?
-Could you kind of--
Well, there's a lot of blacks.
You were married to a colored woman?
Shit. That's ten years in the slammer.
Yeah. Look, I don't expect you to look for 'em... but if you should happen to see 'em... will you tell 'em l-- tell 'em I said hi.
I wonder if they're still over there?
OK. Your pass is good. Go on.
Oh, hey, how do I find
President Supreme Jackson?
Wave a dollar bill.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah. Black is beautiful.
Like they say, huh?
I hears de gentle voices
Hey, man.
-Roscoe, dere, dere.
-What?
That broad, man.
That ugly broad.
Hey, man.
Ain't you going to say hello to your old lady?
-Watch out, now.
-That bitch is too ugly... for you to say hello to in public.
Shoot. I'd go with her a lot quicker... than I'd go with your mama.
Shoot. She's so ugly... your daddy don't even want to go with her.
Shit! Look who's talking.
Shit, if ugliness was electricity... your mama would be walking in a powerhouse.
Oh, man, dig that.
That's light shit.
Your mama look like ten miles of bad road, nigger.
Your mama got a face... that look like it been run over by a bus... and everybody kept telling how good she looking till you.
And then--so she's been jumping in front of buses ever since.
Man, I don't want to hear that.
Oh, hey, look at that.
Boy, some pair of gazongas there.
That isn't bad.
A little young.
But, then, what the hell.
These chicks know where it's at by the time they're 1 1 anyway.
How do I get to the Black House?
You take the number twenty bus on the corner.
You do know what a corner is, don't you, honky?
Somebody help.
Help!
Hey, man. Come on, help me, man, please.
Oh, man. What's the matter?
Well, a gang, man.
They robbed--
-Oh, Jesus.
-Help me, man.
Hey, help!
There's a man hurt in the alley.
Help me, somebody!
-Where?
-Back here.
He hurt bad?
Look, man, there's a phone down the block.
Go and call an ambulance.
Hello?
Operator, give me the hospital.
Give you what?
A hospital--sick, doctor, pain, hurt, you know.
Just a minute, mister.
You looking for a Dr. Sax?
Information number 30-70.
Is that 13-17, or is that 30-70?
-You making fun of me?
-No, I just wanted to get--
Sound like you white.
You white?
What's that got to do with anything?
Honky, what you doing talking on a New African phone?
Trying to get a hospital.
You're going to need one the way you making fun of people.
Look, all I want to know... is if the number is
13-17 or 30-70 or what.
You such a smart ass, you figure it out.
My opponent is accusing me of dodging the issues.
Let me say this about that.
Issues is the only thing
I'm not dodging.
Hey, two more of the same.
What am I going to do, man?
I mean, I work.
I think I look good.
I'm still young.
You know, I might have about five children.
And when I saw Jimi Hendrix...
I'd never saw anybody play guitar, play like--
He took a guitar one time and took-- he had it round his neck, right?
And there was a girl in the audience... that he was dedicating the song to... and he took it, spun it around his neck, right?
He's got it on his neck, right?
Just going around.
Then he takes it... throws it down between his legs and jerks it off.
He jerks it off, man.
I couldn't believe it.
And then threw her right back around his-- and then started playing with his teeth.
That's right. That's him.
And then--after he played it with his teeth... he dropped it down on the ground... took some lighter fluid...
You see it on the album cover.
I decided that I just wanted to be a prostitute.
Oh, honey.
Wait a minute, baby.
I just want to do my thing, baby.
They tell me I can get me some furs.
How you doing?
Hey, pal...
Nigger, you stepped on my shine!
What's wrong with you?
You better get the fuck outta my face.
-What you talking about?
-I'll cut you. Shoot you.
Man, nigger, step outside!
Listen, nigger, you better back off!
I'll cut you from here to tomorrow!
Back up?
Ooh, that's right!
I'll cut you so goddamn fast you won't bleed till tomorrow.
Too easy.
Have you got change for a dollar?
Well, now, looky here!
A real live white!
Isn't anybody gonna break up that fight?
Them niggers don't fight, sucker.
Shit! They just roughin'.
What's a whitey doing in this joint?
-Here you go.
-Thanks. You got a phone?
It got ripped off.
There's one down the street.
Help! Somebody! Police!
I got five dollars say you ain't gonna buy that number.
In fact,
I put my gold teeth on it... you can't make that number with a pencil and a sheet of--
Who goes there?
-Excuse me.
-Don't bother me. I'm hot.
Can you tell me where to find
President Supreme Jackson?
This jive motherfu--
He's right inside.
Go ahead.
You can't make that money.
Come on seven.
Bet five.
Now what is it?
Message from the White House.
The honky prez.
-The White House?
-Gimme the message.
What does it say?
It says that we attempt an assassination... and blame it on lmaku, man.
Attempt to assassinate who?
You, fool!
Don't worry, man.
We'll get an expert shot, man, and all he'll do is wound you.
Wound me?
We got to make it look real.
Fuck that shit. I ain't gonna let nobody shoot me.
The answer is no.
Man, I ain't gonna lose this election.
If I got to get shot you are!
Not necessarily.
Fritz? General Jones wants to talk to you!
OK, thanks.
I'm from--
I know where the hell you from--
-Don't anybody move!
-What's this?
We found you was bugging our conference... spying on the movements, tapping the telephones... and telling the papers
I use hair straightener!
How dare you.
-Where's Jackson?
-He's dead.
Don't you bullshit me!
I'm not.
Killed by an American spy.
What? I didn't kill anybody.
Why would they kill Jackson?
'Cause Jackson was a real brother.
Ain't gonna let this murder go unavenged!
The council has just declared war... on the United States, and dig that!
I thought you said we were going to lose in two or three days.
It's been two weeks.
Where's all that war reparations money... we was supposed to get?
All them PXs and black market cigarettes?
Now, give me a chance to get my head together, man.
Now what is it?
The President of the United States.
Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Vice President...
Iadies and gentlemen, as Commander in Chief... of all the United States military forces...
I surrender.
What? Surrender?
What the hell you mean, surrender?!
You better get back to fighting.
You folks ain't never lost a war.
-Shit, you can win!
-We getting them whiteys back?
Unconditional surrender.
That's your ass, Jones.
For crimes against the Sovereign
Republic of New Africa... and the assassination... of our beloved
President Supreme Jackson... you've been ordered executed this day.
You got a last request?
Yes. Please don't shoot me.
Ready...aim...fire!
I bet you voted for Nixon!
Did you by any chance,
Mr. Smart Ass... pop some of my birth control pills?
Oh, shit!
Ralphie just peed on my shoes!
Christ, is it refreshing to get away... from the pressures of the street.
There's much to be said for the advantages of isolation.
It allows one total freedom to pick and choose... without the forces of society to wear you down.
Take the example of the influence... of our present-day culture.
It typifies humanity's lack of personal concern for others.
Hey, fuck you, you inconsiderate bastards!
You just sit there on your fat asses... and dump on life indiscriminately.
I suppose I should learn to accept... the miniscule distractions of life, though.
Oh, shit!
The sacred horn of Vishnu wakes you up.
Do wake up, please, young Caucasian...
'cause I've come to save your very soul.
What? You sure you want me?
It is not possible that I could be in error.
You see, my good book here, it guides me as I wander... through the vast cosmic universe of my experience... with astral flash and good vibes as my bedfellows.
Wait a minute.
I can't get behind that really.
Aren't those the yellow pages?
Oh, man.
Could you not do that?
Please to wash my feet.
Wash my feet, Caucasian one.
Especially the left one.
Only this morning,
I stepped in sacred cow shit.
Wow, man. Hold on now.
I'm not really into washing cow shit off anybody's feet.
This is truly a bad omen.
I, Javral Ben Roderiga... son of the most ample
Javral Ben Roderiga Sr... have been truly affronted.
Look, I didn't mean to offend you, man.
Silence.
There is no need to explain.
Oh, yeah, this is nice.
Very nice.
The brass horn of Vishnu announces... that I am the second of two sent from the East.
Two also were sent from the West.
No matter.
It was to cure those, those poor unfortunates... afflicted with the leprosy.
Jeez, that's really a shame, because I've seen... a lot of disease down here, but no leprosy--so far.
No leprosy?
No running sores?
Nothing like that.
This is most disturbing news.
But chronic backache?
None of my friends have that, either, I don't think.
Well, then perhaps the dreaded dandruff... or the very heartbreak of psoriasis?
No. I'll tell you the truth.
I think you're a little late.
See, I think that went down a long time ago.
I could tell you a story, if you'd care to--
If you could possibly make it short... because there is a strong possibility... that I should be in Philadelphia.
Jesus, this stuff is dynamite.
The eyes of my own soul staring back at me.
God knows I've lived the best lives I was capable of.
My minor infractions of society's rules were only due--
Oh, please, Lucifer, don't take me!
I'm not ready! I'll change!
I'm already changing.
Look at me change.
Oh, my God, what a way to go.
Excuse me, certainly.
Hello?
Yoo-hoo down there.
Excuse me.
Did anyone find an earring?
I dropped my earring in the trash. You'd recognize it.
It opens on one side.
Kind of a jade color.
It's got a picture of Errol
Flynn and Alan Hale naked--
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Lucifer's a faggot!
Jesus Christ, my life is shit!
I had to get knocked up.
I could've had an abortion.
No. Mr. Good-Time Charlie over there.
"No," he says.
"Have the baby.
"We'll get married.
I'll take care of you."
What'll you take care of?
It's a good thing we got Ralphie.
Otherwise, we don't even get welfare.
Will you tell me one thing you ever did for my Ralphie?
Do you ever play with him?
Do you ever take him to the ballgame?
Do you ever take him fishing?
How about fishing?
Why don't you take your own son fishing?
You don't even change his kitty litter!
Did you know that Dr. Spock... has stated very clearly in his book... that fathers who are never there... usually makes a fag kid?
Do you know what he does most of the time around the house?
If he's not picking his nose, he's jerking off.
How's that gonna look when he starts kindergarten?
Suck my dick, huh?
You get outta here!
Pack your things and get out!
I said get out, and I mean it!
While I'm still young enough... to find a decent father for my child, you bum.
All you do is lay around.
Listen, I'm sick of cleaning up after you.
And don't think I don't know that you fool around.
I know it.
You junkie, you hophead, you.
Are you kidding?
No, I'm not.
I'm sick of seeing you... sitting around here doing nothing.
Get serious!
Don't come back here until you're ready to shape up!
Too much. I thought she was putting me on.
Hey, she actually did it.
That blows my mind.
Hey, I don't have to go to the welfare office tomorrow.
Jesus! Wow!
Know what that is?
That's shit!
You are shit!
Know what? Know what?
She's got the clap!
Some of my best friends...
When he gets back to Earth.
This is about the worst life I ever had.

You there, which way to Pepperinge Eye?
Couldn't say, sir. lt said on the wireless to paint out the signposts in case the Nazis drop in. l'm not a Nazi! l'm a British officer!
That's what you'd say if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?
Drive on, corporal.
Sorry to give you so many but you do have six bedrooms.
No trouble.
Anything to get the poor things away from those terrible bombings in London.
What about us?
- Oh, yes. What is your name?
- Rawlins, ma'am.
Oh, yes. Here we are. Carrie.
Charles.
Paul.
You're for Miss Price. l'm expecting her in.
- Call out the navy
- l won't be a moment.
Please don't touch anything.
Call out the tanks
From the Cliffs of Dover,
call up the gulls
And don't forget
the loyal territorials
But who's digging in here?
Who will defend
Every inch of England,
no matter what they send?
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
We wrote the story
of the old brigades
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,

The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.
Captain Greer, sir, from headquarters at Tidbury, here to check military preparations.
Tell them Pepperinge Eye has matters well in hand.
Nevertheless, l...
What on earth is that?
Good morning, General. l received your message, Mrs Hobday.
- l assume my parcel has arrived.
- lt's in the office.
How lovely.
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.
Her late father served with me.
What does she burn in this? lt smells like sulphur.
Ridiculous! One can't make motor fuel out of sulphur!
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.
- Thank you.
- ls it what you expected?
- l imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.
- Professor Browne is well?
- l haven't the faintest idea.
Are we to have the pleasure of meeting him? l doubt it. l don't know
Professor Browne personally.
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?
- l'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.
- Get down, Charlie. l want a ride!
- Bash him one!
Stop it this instant!
Children, this is Miss Price.
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins, all the way from London.
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?
The government are trying to evacuate children into the country.
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.
And l've had to find homes for all of them at very short notice.
These are the last three. All right, children. Pick up your things.
You're not suggesting l take these children into my house?
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.
Children and l don't get on. l'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.
Be quiet.
Besides, l have important work to do.
Miss Price, you do have that entire house to yourself.
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice. l see. lf that is the case l shall take them into my house, with the understanding that you find another home as soon as possible.
Fine. Come along.
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable thing you are doing, taking in these poor unfortunates from the city.
- Hold this very carefully.
- l wonder if l may drop by later.
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.
My parcel, please.
Bring your things inside.
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Not another house round here for miles.
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.
- Who else lives here?
- l live alone. lt suits my purpose.
All right. Come along, everybody.
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!
- What do you call your cat?
- l don't give animals silly names. l call him Cosmic Creepers because that's the name he came with.
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.
Be very careful of everything in it.
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.
- ls that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.
Travel light, that's us. l don't think this is going to work but it seems that l have no alternative.
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?
You will wash yourselves otherwise there will be no supper. ls that clear?
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.
Please don't bother to whisper. l'm exceptionally keen of hearing.
You are planning to run back to London.
Please do your plotting elsewhere where l shan't have to listen to it. l don't know much about what children eat.
You'll have to make do as l do. ls there anything in particular that you fancy?
Sausage and mash, bubble and squeak, toad in the hole, fried fish...
Anything at all.
You won't find any fried foods in this house.
- No fried food?
- No.
How do you keep your health?
Cabbage buds, rosehips, hyssop seed, elm bark, wattle yeast and stewed nettles.
''Dear Madam. With this shipment, the Emelius Browne
College of Witchcraft sends you its congratulations on qualifying for the first degree of your chosen calling.''
''You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'.''
''Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne.''
My first broom.
Time to go. Everybody up.
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.
Let's see how we fly this thing.
Here we are.
''Clasp the broom with both hands.''
Yes, of course.
''Never astride the broom.''
Oh, yes, of course.
''A witch is always a lady unless circumstances dictate otherwise.''
''Take an easy, graceful sideways position.''
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.
There we are. How's that?
''To start up the broom, your basic formula:
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!'' l wasn't ready!
Now watch this.
Here we go. lt's going to be a little different this time.
All right. l know it's not ladylike.
What's the matter?
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.
That's the sort of thing witches do.
She don't fly good, do she?
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.
Look out!
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.
Hang on. l'm having a bit of a think.
A witch she is, says you.
Then let's use the old loaf, says l.
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.
She don't want anyone to know she's a witch, does she?
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.
And l intend to make the most of it. Come on.
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.
Very healthful, l'm sure!
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. lt's nothing serious.
Lovely weather for flying last night.
Why did you say that, Charles?
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are. l see.
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.
Thank you. l should be most grateful if you didn't tell anyone.
Course there would have to be one or two little changes made round here. l mean, l'd like to see an occasional sausage on the table here.
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.
There will be no more of this wash, wash, wash, morning and night.
Anything else?
Now you mention it, l could do with a bit of lolly.
Lolly?
Cash. Cold, hard cash.
You must have buckets of it.
The most accomplished of witches can't make money out of thin air.
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?
Be that as it may, you don't want us to blab, do you?
Have you considered what danger you might be in? l am a witch, you know.
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.
- l might just do that.
- Go on, then. l dare you.
Very well, Charles.
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.
She can't even ride a proper broom.
Excuse me, Charles.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Oh, Charlie!
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!
Bother! l never seem to be able to manage toads.
Stop! Leave him alone!
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long. l'm just an apprentice witch.
Look out, Charlie!
You flaming brute! l'll teach you to do that to me!
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault. l'm afraid it's my fault.
Bad enough not being able to manage a broom. l can't perform a simple, basic spell.
You dared her to do it. l don't see why we can't all be friends.
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.
Of course l'm not!
- See?
- lf only l could trust you.
You see, the work l'm doing is so important to the war effort.
- How do you mean?
- l mean exceptionally important.
Most secret.
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.
Yeah. lf someone made it worth our while. l don't follow.
Simple. You give us something valuable to seal the pact.
Oh, Charlie, don't try to be clever again. lt's for our own protection, ain't it? lf we broke the pact, we'd have to give back the valuable object. l think it's an excellent idea. l wonder what l could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?
Bet that's not worth much.
Come with me.
- l like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.
Well, l never had a rabbit.
Careful what you touch in here.
Rum sort of place, ain't it?
When l signed for my witchcraft course there was a free bonus, a marvellous travelling spell if you paid in advance. l think l'll give you that one.
- ls it valuable?
- Certainly.
Poisoned dragon's liver?
You mean you poison the dragon or just the liver? lt comes prepared. lt's part of the school equipment.
Here we are. The travelling spell.
Everybody gather round.
All right now. Let's see.
Does any one of you have a bracelet or a ring?
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.
Never know when they might come in useful. Piece of blue glass.
Lovely bit of string.
Horseshoe nail.
What's that?
Knob from the bed upstairs.
- lt twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.
Yes, l think that will be all right.
Carrie, turn the light down a little bit, will you?
Hellebore, henbane, aconite... glow-worm fire, firefly light!
There. lsn't that pretty? ls that all we get?
This knob will now work the famous travelling spell.
And what's the famous travelling spell?
- How does it work?
- You take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs.
Then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left then in a firm, clear voice, tell it where you want to go and the bed will take you there.
Go on!
- Will it really?
- l see no reason to think otherwise.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the only one who can work the spell.
- Me?
- Yes.
That's right. My knob, weren't it?
That's the way the spell works.
Nice mess he'll make of things.
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.
Don't try anything with the bedknob till l get back.
''Dear Madam, it grieves me to inform you that we have been forced to close down our College of Witchcraft.''
''This means that we shall not be sending you the final lesson in which you expressed so much interest.''
- What's keeping you?
- l've had some very bad news. ls there anything we can do?
No. No, thank you.
Yes.
Yes, there is something that Paul can do.
- Me?
- l need the bedknob back.
- l must get to London.
- No. l want to go to the jungle.
Come with me, Paul.
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem to have to explain this to a six-year-old,
- l do need your help.
- Go ahead. l was expecting a very important spell in the mail from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.
What's that got to do with my knob? l must go to London immediately and see Professor Browne.
With his help, we may be able to bring this war to a successful end.
That is why l need the knob.
What is your decision?
Thank you, Paul. l brought this for your hair. lt may be windy.
Thank you. lt's ever so nice.
Paul, have you been to the bathroom?
- Twice.
- Good.
Charles, put on something warmer.
The bed may travel quite fast. l'm not going. l'm staying right here.
But why?
All that rubbish about a travelling bed. lt won't work. That's why.
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.
We don't want to scratch the wall when we take off.
How's a ruddy big bed like that gonna get out of this room with those little windows? l don't know. There's a great many things about magic that l don't know.
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!
Just leave me out of it. l don't fancy making a fool of myself.
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.
Help me tidy up. We don't want to go to London with an unmade bed.
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve. l see. That's what my father used to call the age of not believing.
What's that supposed to be?
When you rush around
in hopeless circles
Searching everywhere
for something true
You're at the age of not believing
When all the make-believe
is through
That's Charlie to a tee.
When you set aside
your childhood heroes
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf
You're at the age of not believing
And worst of all you doubt yourself
Throw that away.
You're a castaway
where no one hears you
On a barren isle in a lonely sea
What's that? Poetry?
Where did all the happy endings go?
Where can all the good times be?
Everyone on the bed who's going.
You must face the age
of not believing
Doubting everything you ever knew
The knob.
Until at last you start believing
There's something wonderful in you
Lovely sentiment, l'm sure.
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.
Repeat after me.
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...
Very good.
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.
..of Witchcraft, London.
When l say go, tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left.
- Left...
- That's it.
We'd better hold on tight.
The behaviour of the bed is something l'm not sure of.
Let me breathe a little.
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.
One... two... three...
- ls this London?
- Course it is!
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet l ain't. l don't see no Professor Browne.
Neither do l.
You children look after the bed while l make enquiries for Mr Browne.
- l told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again. lt didn't work. lt was supposed to take us to Professor Browne.
- ''Professor Browne.''
- Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round, please.
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne. l am here to divert, to amuse, and, yes, even to help you.
- There he is!
- lt is not what things are... lt is what they seem to be. ls that not so?
That ain't the kind of professor l expected. l'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.
What effect a little smoke is... with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning... and the scent of burning sulphur in the air.
And now, for my next trick, may l draw your attention to this solid piece of ordinary window glass, framed in an ordinary unprepared frame.
May l also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.
Now l shall place the framed glass in this brown, unprepared...
Unprepared, mark you...
Unprepared brown paper bag. l shall now attempt to drive the steel nail through the glass without breaking the glass.
''lmpossible!'' l hear you say.
We shall see.
He ain't very good, even if he is a professor. l tell you what l'm going to do.
No, please don't go.
Don't leave now and regret lost opportunities later.
You, young sir. Would you care to warble like the storied nightingale?
With this inexpensive device, you can charm the very birds down from the trees, like so.
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.
One copper coin of the realm.
Carrie, l'm very surprised at you wandering off like this.
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.
Don't work. l've been cheated! ls that Professor Browne? lt is indeed, my dear.
How may l serve you?
Would you be interested in the mating call of the Brazilian bird of love?
Very useful, eh?
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.
Professor Browne, l am one of your pupils.
My dear lady, you are indeed an ornament to the college.
- Splendid.
- Not at all. l was shocked when you closed down the college without that most important last lesson. l'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.
But l must have the spell that comes with the last lesson!
The matter is closed. l bid you good day. l have an appointment at my club.
The matter is not closed!
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!
Here we are.
Will you get this child off my leg?
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Now l trust you'll behave more like a gentleman.
Look out!
There goes another rabbit.
What was all that about? l changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells.
My spell? From my school?
Not one of your best spells. lt doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.
But l don't understand. My spell?
They were just nonsense words from an old book.
They worked perfectly well for me.
They work for you?
Good woman! Some kind of destiny has brought us together.
You got these spells out of some old book, you say? l changed them round a bit. l gave them a bit of my own style, as it were.
The old sorcerers did have a bit of a tendency to waffle on.
But dear lady, l never thought l'd meet somebody like you.
What a treasure.
Mr Browne, will you please stick to the point. l would like to see this book immediately.
Certainly. lt's at my new town house.
Would you care to join me for luncheon?
We can discuss my ideas at the same time.
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.
You go round the other side. l always travel on the left.
Will you give the address to Paul, please?
May l ask how we are going to get there on this bed? Fly?
My dear Professor, with your own travelling spell.
The one you gave with the course as a bonus.
My travelling spell?
That works as well?
Just give the address, please.
8 Winchfield Road.
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.
Madam, is this vehicle safe?
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps, but then most good spells are.
We're here. l would never have believed it.
You must have given us the wrong address. Do you live here? ln fact, l do.
Temporarily, at any rate. l found the front door open.
The house was deserted.
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.
Why should they do that?
This probably has something to do with it.
Merciful heavens!
You should be terrified at the very idea of living here.
You would have thought so. l am by nature a little bit of a coward.
But then l pondered. ln the perverse nature of things, this diabolical object is probably the best friend l've ever had. lt enables me, for the first time in my life, to live like a king.
Shall we go in?
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise, but with a charming touch of innocence.
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?
Dear lady, you are relentless.
The book is in the library. We shall proceed there after our cheese and wine.
Why do you keep the curtains closed?
So that we may enjoy the gentle glow of candle light.
More likely so's a copper don't peek in and catch you hiding out here.
Why don't you have a look round the house?
- l want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.
Remember, this house does not belong to Mr Browne.
Mr Browne, where is that book? l must have that spell on substitutiary locomotion.
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.
Would you hold this, please?
What do you think of that?
- Well, l... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.
Think how successful l could be with an assistant who can really do magic.
Dear lady, have you ever considered entering show business?
- The what business?
- The theatre!
Pantomimes, village fairs, the seaside.
Brighton, Blackpool, follies on the prom. l have very important work to do.
Listen to me. We could make a packet.
Let us strike a bargain
You possess a gift
But I can speak the jargon
That will give your gift
the needed lift
You possess the know-how
And I command the show-how
Oh, how successful you could be
With me l'm afraid we're wasting valuable time.
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh, how you'll shine
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit
All you need to succeed
in your plan
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely
And I'm your man
For I have an acumen
that's nigh-superhuman
I sell things that nobody can
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest
I'm your man
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh how you'll shine
Will you stop?
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
What are you reading?
''lsle of Naboombu.''
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.
These pictures prove it, don't it?
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things. l like it.
Now where is the book?
Well? Where is it?
At last, Mr Browne!
''The Spells of Astoroth.''
Of course.
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.
Does one's nose have to twitch like this?
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.
Miss Price, a word about your tactics. l don't mind being changed into a hawk or a tiger or something with dash.
But always a fluffy white rabbit? lt's intolerable!
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.
''The ancient art of...''
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are...''
But the rest of the book is missing!
Now you see why l closed down the college.
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.
- Listen to me!
- l'm all ears.
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book? l bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.
He claimed that l'd given him a dud coin. l ask you!
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.
He got one half and l got the other.
- But where's the other half now?
- lt's probably been thrown away.
But if it still exists, there's only one place to find it.
- Where is that?
- Portobello Road
Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Anything and everything
a chap can unload
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road
- Rare alabaster
- Genuine plaster
A filigreed samovar
owned by the tsars
- A pen used by Shelley
- A new Botticelli!
The snippers that clipped
old King Edward's cigars
Made in Hong Kong?
Two bob a dozen, would you say?
- Waterford crystal
- Napoleon's pistols
Society heirlooms with genuine gems
Rembrandts, El Grecos,
Toulouse-Lautrecos
Painted last week
on the banks of the Thames
Very interesting, but where do they sell books?
There's a little place around the corner.

You meet all your chums
in the Portobello Road
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
What l want is the other half of this book.
All in good time, my dear.
Burke's Peerage, The Bride Book,
The Fishmonger's Guidebook l'm looking for the other part of this.
A Victorian novel, ''The Unwanted Son''
- You don't understand!
- The History of Potting
The Yearbook of Yachting
The leather-bound
''Life of Attila the Hun''
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Artefacts to glorify a regal abode
Are hidden in the flotsam
in Portobello Road
Who do you think you are?
Tokens and treasures,
yesterday's pleasures
Cheap imitations
and heirlooms of old
Dented and tarnished,
scarred and unvarnished
In old Portobello...
This lady is looking for the other half of this book. lt's called ''The Spells of Astoroth''. l don't keep no torn or damaged books here.
What do you think l am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road
There's another bookstore along here somewhere.
You don't expect to sell a piano like that, do you?
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Happy things are happening
in Portobello Road
You feel like a ballerina
when you're hopping like a toad
When you kick your heels up
down in Portobello Road
Come on, ducks!
Come on, girls!
Lovely.
Oh, yeah, play the drums.
Closing time!
Bye!
Portobello Road
Portobello Road
Street where the riches
of ages are stowed
Anything and everything
a chap can unload...
Hey, governor. Something for the lady friend? Nylons?
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?
Now you have my undivided attention.
- What can l do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.
He wants to see you. You too.
Who is the Bookman? And what right has he got to order me about? l think we'd better ask questions later.
Excuse me.
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.
Why didn't you bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne, and half the Household Cavalry as well?
What's the bed for? lt's a present for you.
That's what he said.
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.
Except for this knob, which is mine.
Bookman, there's been bad blood between us long enough.
Let this gift begin friendship anew.
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug. lsn't that the section of the manuscript we've been looking for?
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.
A charming young woman of my acquaintance.
Miss Price, l've been looking for this other bit a long time.
Mr Swinburne told me you were in the market making enquiries.
And here we are. l don't mind saying, to see it all together at last...
- There isn't much l wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne. ls that clear? lt's all like a jolly detective story or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?
We're both after the same spell.
You have one clue, l have the other.
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing seems to be for us to cooperate. l assume you're looking for the same thing l am.
May l?
This is quite a moment for both of us.
''Substitutiary locomotion, the lost miracle of the ancients.''
And so on and so forth.
Here we are.
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are... engraved on the star that was always worn by the sorcerer Astoroth.''
But where are the words of the spell? l assumed they'd be in your half of the manuscript. l thought they'd be in yours!
Once again, a dead end. l shall never know the secret. lsn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.
Pity it's so small you can't read the writing.
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,
Astoroth kept animals in cages in search for the spells that would make them more like humans.
The legend is that finally the animals rebelled at the experiment, killed Astoroth and stole many of his powers. lncluding the star with the spell on it.
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away and were never heard of again.
However, there is a final notation in my half of the book saying that in the 1 7th century a shipwrecked lascar was taken from the sea half mad with thirst and exposure to the sun.
Before he died, he swore he had seen an island ruled by animals.
Where?
There is, l regret to say, no such island. l looked for it in every chart.
The lsle of Naboombu does not exist. lt does too! Got my own...
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!
When he don't say nothing, he mumbles. l wish the child to speak!
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.
- lt's just a children's book.
- l'll be the judge of that.
- Give it to me.
- No.
Please don't annoy me.
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it? lf it's all the same to you, l'd rather use my own.
Sentiment, you know.
Come along, Paul. lt's time to go.
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.
Observe the fundamental weakness of the criminal mind.
- You will believe no one or anything.
- l understand.
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.
He's up to something, you know.
Before your very eyes, l shall cause this bed and the occupants on it to disappear. l should like to see a cheap-jack tenth-rate entertainer do a trick like that.
''Cheap-jack entertainer.''
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.
- Where to?
- To the lsland of Naboombu.
- l'm very curious about that place.
- Good.
Bed, take us to the lsland of Naboombu.
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!
Beastly climate. l never did fancy the sea.
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course. l've never seen no island like this before. l'm afraid we may have fallen into the lagoon.
That's right.
Here we are on page three.
Oi, Mr Codfish!
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.
Now l'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.
Not too bright, is he?
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.
Mr Codfish, where is the lsland of Naboombu?
You mean the land part? Oh, that.
Straight up. You can't miss it.
None of my business, of course, but l shouldn't go there if l were you.
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.
Trouble or not, we should be getting along.
- l wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush? lt's really rather splendid down here. For you, my dear.
Thank you.
How pleasant...
Bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants and creatures
of the deep
We glide
Far below the rolling tide
Serene
Through the bubbly blue and green
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod
Think we're rather odd?
It's fun to promenade
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Look!
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants
and creatures of the deep
It's grand
When you're dancing on the sand
Each glance
Bubbles over with romance
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along through the water
Where we get along swimmingly
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom of the beautiful briny,
shimmery shiny
Beautiful briny sea
Bravo!
Most exciting, most exciting.
You've won the ruddy cup.
Help!
This time l really caught a whopper!
People! Oh, no!
What scurvy luck.
- My goodness!
- l'll deal with this, my dear.
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain. l used to be a bit of a seafaring man myself.
Many's the time l've shipped out of Portsmouth.
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.
Now stow it, mate.
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading? lt says... ''No peopling allowed.''
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.
That means l've got to throw you all back. That's what to do.
Wait it minute! lt says here that anybody can see the king.
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?
Here in my book.
So it do.
But if you people knew what was good for you, you'd get yourselves all throwed back.
The king don't like people!
Nonetheless, we must see the king on an urgent personal matter.
Please lead the way.
But just don't say l didn't warn you. See?
Follow me.
Get out of here!
Yes. What can l do for you? l caught some people down at the sea lagoon.
They want to see the king.
Really? Well, we can't be bothered with that sort of thing now, can we? l don't know that l fancy this.
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer, l am considered not without talent.
Perhaps l can cheer him up.
No, no. You don't understand.
As everyone knows,
His Majesty is the world's greatest soccer player.
But due to a technical problem, the Royal Cup match cannot take place today.
And His Majesty had so set his heart on it!
Throw these... creatures back into the sea.
Aye, aye, sir.
Just a moment! l can help!
Do you really think so? l'd be most grateful.
Do you know soccer?
Do l know anything about soccer?
Why, l was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.
Three seasons with Manchester United...
Yes, yes. You'll do.
Come this way, please.
Mr Browne, are you certain you'll be all right?
Now what?
Not an ideal person in many respects, but Mr Browne is a very brave man.
Do you think he's done for?
Do you think so? l can't tell you how l appreciate this.
For some reason we have great difficulty finding referees round here. lf there be one thing we like, it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!
What's he got round his neck?
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.
Ah, yes.
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.
The Star of Astoroth!
You're to sit in His Majesty's royal box.
No littering, no chewing, no fruit or wrappers or sweets. Please.
Rise, please.
Loyal fans, this is official.
We have a volunteer referee.
Let the match begin!
He's still wearing it!
Right, Dirty Yellows, let's have a clean game.
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.
Weird sort of game they play here.
Hurry up! Get rid of it!
Gracious!
You're doing fine, matey.
Move it around.
Get on with the match!
- Foul!
- They're only animals.
That's no excuse for dirty football.
Ref, are you blind?
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.
The king makes them up as he goes along.
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?
Well, he's moving.
Steady, matey. Move it around.
He almost had it then.
Looks like he's done for this time.
Don't just stand there! Head it in!
Stop... that... ball!
Goal!
Game's over. l win.
Let me give you a hand, matey.
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.
Please, let me help you on with your robe.
Why, yes. Thank you.
Can't have you catching cold, sire, can we?
Why, no.
Have you ever heard of something called the gypsy switch?
No, can't say that l have.
Remind me to tell you about it some time. l can't tell you when we've had such a good time.
We'll carry your memory in our hearts for a long while. l think it's time to leave.
Must you go?
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
Friendly lot.
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?
Your Royal Star!
They've stolen your Royal Star!
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you think this is?
Why didn't you say so?
Paul, put the knob on the bed.
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee. l'll keep it.
Women always lose things.
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- lt's stuck!
- l suppose l'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.
Got it.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...
Oh, bother. l do hate shoddy work. l shall never get used to this thing.
Will you push the bed back into place, please? l think we could all do with a nice cup of tea.
No time. l've gone to a lot of trouble to find this spell. l'm going to try it immediately.
Mr Browne, kindly let me have your shoes, please.
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for? lf you'd been paying attention l should think you'd be aware that substitutiary locomotion is the art of causing inanimate objects to take on a life force of their own. l must have inanimate objects to experiment with.
Makes sense, don't it?
Stand back, everyone. l need plenty of room. l want you all to be absolutely quiet.
Mr Browne, you have the Star of Astoroth, l believe.
Oh, yes. lt's in my nice clean hanky. lt's all right, Mr Browne. l should have realised that it would be impossible to take an object from one world into another. lf only l would have had the sense to remember the words on that star.
- l know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.
Why don't you and l nip out and get something for supper?
And l might conceivably call into the pub for a pint to steady my nerves. l do know the words, Miss Price.
How can you know the words when Miss Price doesn't?
Troop movements and massing
of barges in French and Dutch ports.
The prime minister
has told the nation
to be on the alert for signs
of a possible invasion.
That was the news. l might have been able to do something about this. lt's out of your hands now, my dear. lf only l could have remembered those words. lt's maddening.
Why don't someone ask me?
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember those kind of words.
You mean like ''Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee''?
- How do you know that?
- Easy.
Says so right here in my book.
You mean it was there in your book all the time?
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Nothing happened!
Am l doing something wrong?
Well, it does seem a bit old-fashioned.
After all, we are in the 20th century.
- What do you suggest?
- lt needs rhythm. Tempo.
Music.
As l always say, do it with a flair.
- Do you mind if l have a go?
- Of course not.
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Substitutiary locomotion
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion
It's so weird, so feared,
yet wonderful to see
Substitutiary locomotion come to me
Now!
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
I don't want locomotiary substitution
Or remote intransecory convolution
Only one precise solution is the key
Substitutiary locomotion it must be
Substitutiary locomotion
Lovely substitutiary locomotion
You've made substitutiary history
With treguna mekoides
and a little help from me
- With treguna mekoides and...
- Trecorum satis dee
Mr Browne, what is going on here? l haven't the foggiest.
How do you do?
Shall we?
- That's my nightgown!
- ls it really, my dear? l'm not responsible for its behaviour.
Obviously not, my dear.
Paul, what on earth are you doing?
Having a jolly good time, that's what.
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? lt's most agreeable.
But we must do something.
Didn't l give you my all-purpose cut-off spell?
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.
- Yes, number eight l think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!
Mr Browne, will you please control your shoes?
Dear lady, l very much fear that we have nothing under control.
Do you mind?
Now, who would like some more of my lovely sausages and mash?
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie? l've already had two helpings.
- l'm full.
- Me, too.
At least somebody wants some.
Cheer up, my dear. This should be something of a celebration. l'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be much to celebrate.
- l still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.
You just need a little more practice.
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.
Meantime, there's nothing to liven the spirits like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice and a touch of genius.
Never happened to me before. l don't usually juggle with cats under my feet.
Look! She's laughing!
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- l can't stop, my dear. l've just come by to bring you the good news.
Mr Bistlethwaite, who brings the milk, you know?
He's promised to take the children in!
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.
Put a bit of colour back in their cheeks.
Why, what's the matter? l thought you'd be pleased.
You told me yourself that you had no time to take care of children.
Circumstances have changed somewhat.
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?
Of course. You do want him to stay with us, don't you, Miss Price? l suppose l hadn't really thought about it.
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne? lt's all rather sudden! l don't quite know what to say.
Then l'll leave you two to talk it over. l'll come back in the morning!
Good night! lt is true, Mr Browne. You are going to be our father now, aren't you?
We are rather rushing things, aren't we?
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things besides you children to think about.
Yes. As a matter of fact l should have left ages ago. l must get a train back to London tonight. lt's rather an important matter. l'd like to tell you about it, but it's a little bit hush-hush.
Sort of a secret.
Well... if... lf l've been any sort of help to you, l'm pleased.
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you. l've enjoyed being with you.
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.
Will you be coming back?
Some day, my dear. l certainly hope that we shall meet again.
Some day.
When all this war business is over.
- l see.
- Perhaps l shall realise my dream.
Eglantine and Emelius: illusionists extraordinary!
Just think how that will look on the poster.
The children are going to miss you.
- You really think they will?
- Yes.
Well, l shall miss you. All of you. lf l don't go now you might never get rid of me.
Goodbye, Carrie.
- Must you really go?
- l think it's best for everybody.
- Goodbye, Paul.
- l think you should be our father.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Do you want me to come down to the station with you?
No, no. You stay here and look after everybody.
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. tomorrow morning.
- Mind if l await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.
Good night.
Out you go, Cosmic.
Hello?
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cosy
in that house at this very moment?
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,
and a coward.
No, Fräulein, this is not the invasion, just a little exercise.
A minor raid to induce panic and to spread a little mischief.
When you English get it through your head that the German forces can land whenever and wherever we please, perhaps you will consider reasonable peace.
Not bloody likely!
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him. l must say, it's very tempting.
Colonel, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit? l said, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit?
Be quiet, please.
Filigree, apogee, epogee...
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.
Would you kindly fetch my notebook from the workroom?
Righto.
Silence!
We have work to do. l am sorry, but l must send all of you some place where you will no longer be a nuisance.
As the words sell the tune
And the moonbeams the moon
All I need to succeed in my plan
Is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair
Eglantine!
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.
Confound it, can't women ever learn to file things properly?
Here it is.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.
Filigree... apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Come along. For once in your life, you've got to believe in something.
That's it. Good lad.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
What's the use of putting us in that draughty castle? lt's quite chilly.
The colonel believes when a British female decides to become a nuisance, she can become the greatest nuisance in the world, and l'm inclined to agree with him.
You need a lesson in manners. lf l had my notebook, l'd make certain you'd learn a few.
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!
Take it easy, can't you?
- Try holding your breath.
- l am holding it.
We could strip him down and grease him with soap.
No, it's no good. We can't do it. l could have told you that in the first place. lf we can't get Paul out we'll just have to think of something else.
What about that spell that makes things move about?
- But l'd need weapons.
- How about all these things? l'm afraid they're a bit ancient.
- Where did this come from?
- lt's Mr Browne!
He's on his way to London.
Mr Browne? lf you are Mr Browne, would you get off my lap? lt is Mr Browne! lt is you!
You didn't think that l could do that spell, did you? l am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?
What's wrong with the substitutiary locomotion spell?
- That ought to be useful.
- lt isn't ready yet.
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.
We can't let these so-and-sos get away with their beastly little raid.
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.
Let's hope you haven't forgotten the spell.
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.
Probably not magic, but it might make you feel more at home.
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.
Treguna... mekoides... trecorum... satis dee.
Look!
Sound the advance!
Just in time for the kick-off.
Steady on the left.
Victory for England and St George!
Like a Lord Mayor's show!
Pikemen, hold your distance.
Treguna mekoides
and trecorum satis dee
Blimey!
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.
Come on, lads! After me.
Good shooting, bowmen!
Well caught, sir. Very good.
Knock his block off! That's it!
Mr Browne, make those children take cover!
Are you still there, Colonel? l thought you'd be on your way by now.
You see? Things may not be so easy for you after all.
Goodbye, Colonel!
Eglantine.
Dear Mr Browne.
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.
There they are, lads! l said something was afoot!
All right. Drive them into the sea.
Firing positions. Both sides.
All right, men. Hold your fire. l think we've taught the Hun a lesson.
He'll think twice before coming back here again. lt's tragic. All your spells, your equipment. All gone.
Still, l was able to perform some small service first.
That mean you ain't gonna be a witch no more? Never?
No, Paul. l realised some time ago that l could never be a proper witch.
Was it that first magic moment when you laid eyes on me?
No. lt was the day my poisoned dragon's liver arrived. l knew that anyone who felt the way l did about poisoned dragon's liver had no business being a witch.
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, l think so. lt's much too dangerous being a civilian.
Take care of yourself, guv. l'll do that. And l'll be back before you've grown an inch taller.
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.
Well, here we go.
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.
Parade, by the right, quick march!
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.
Still got this, ain't l?

''Hurry.

Penny?
Morningside Orphanage?
Dash it all.
It's not much to go on, is it?
Oh. Oh, that poor little girl.
Oh, Mr. Chairman, please... please, may I have this assignment?
You, Miss Bianca?
Dear lady, it's absolutely without precedent.
I mean, it's not like the old days when it was a man's world.
However, I suppose there has to be a first time.
Uh, uh, Mr. Chairman, sir.
I-I-I don't think Miss Bianca should go. It could be dangerous.
I mean, I mean, any-- anything could-- could happen to her.
You see, dear lady, before our janitor interrupted...
I was about to suggest that you should have a co-agent go with you.
Gentlemen, who will volunteer?
Gentlemen, this is indeed a-- a most difficult decision to make.
I choose...
Mr. Bernard to be my co-agent.
M-Me? Oh, th-that's-- that's really very, uh--
No, uh, see, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a-- I'm only a-a-a ja-janitor.
Oh, come on.
We'll be a great team together.
Oh, come on!
Bravo! Bravo!
Ajanitor, my lady?
Oh, good heavens. Bless my soul.
Morningside Orphanage.
Here. H-Here it is.
Three blocks down and... uh, uh, four blocks over.
Well, why don't we take the shortcut through the zoo?
Uh, gee, uh, Miss Bianca, uh--
I-I don't know. I mean, it's-- you know, it could be risky.
Oh, come on.
Remember our pledge?
Through storm and rain and dark of night--
Never fail to do what's right.
All right, duty calls.
Uh, Mr. Bernard, um, maybe we'd better go back.
It's so dark in there.
Dark?
Who's a--
Who's afraid of the dark?
Look, you, uh--y-you stay here.
I'll-- I'll check it out.
Wait for me!
How-- How about trying, uh, three blocks down and, uh, four blocks over?
What did you do to make him so mad?
Nothing. He's just a-- just a grumpy old lion.
Well, after all, waking him up in the middle of the night--
Wouldn't you be grumpy too?
I didn't wake him up in the middle of the night.
I was walking through the thing, and he just--
I'll, uh-- I'll take a look around, see what I can find.
Miss, uh-- Miss Bianca, over here.
I-I found something.
- These are Penny's belongings.
- Good work.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, look.
The little girl's treasures.
Boy, the things kids collect.
Do you think she could be still here in the orphanage?
Well, s-she can't be. It says on the box, ''Hold until further notice.''
Well, maybe she's been adopted.
No, because she would've taken these things with her.
- Mice!
- Cat!
Now, lookee here, you two... if folks find out that mice moved in here...
I-I'll get kicked out, lose my job.
Oh, d-don't worry, Mr. Cat.
We won't be here long.
I'm a mite too old to be chasin' mice.
Uh, sir, could-- could you tell us what happened to a little girl named Penny?
I sure can. But you ain't gonna find her around here.
The poor little thing ran away.
When-- When was the last time you saw Penny?
Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.
Let's see now. Uh--
The last time I saw her... she was sittin' over there on her bed, all alone.
She looked awful sad, and so I asked her--
What's wrong, Penny honey?
Nothing.
Oh, come on, now.
Come on. No secrets.
You tell old Rufus, huh?
Well, it was adoption day at the orphanage.
Well, what happened?
A man and a lady came and looked at me... but they choosed a little redheaded girl.
She was prettier than me.
Oh! Sh-She couldn't be!
Y-You listen to me, darlin'.
You're something extra special.
No, I'm not.
Why, someday a mama and a papa will come to the orphanage... looking for a pretty little girl just like you.
- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.
But you've got to believe it.
Keep the faith, sweetheart.
- Do you see that bluebird?
- Yes, I do.
Well, faith is a bluebird... you see from afar.
It's for real, and as sure as the first evening star.
You can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same... making things turn out right.
Can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same, making things turn out right.
But whoever adopts me has to adopt Teddy too.
Oh, they'll love him.
He doesn't eat much, does he?
Oh, here!
I brought you something.
Land o' Goshen! Catnip snaps!
No! They're ginger snaps!
Well, an old codger like me could use a little ginger.
I taked two extra ones for lunch today.
We're not supposed to do that.
Well, you can trust me.
I won't tattletale on you.
I love you, Rufus.
Gee, we'd better hurry, or we'll be late for supper!
She seemed happy enough, but the next thing I heard...
Penny was gone.
Well, aren't-- aren't the police still looking for her?
No, no, no, no.
They-- They gave up weeks ago.
Oh, this is terrible.
That poor little girl.
I just can't believe that Penny would run away.
Uh, Mr. Rufus, please think.
Now, there must be something else.
Well, come to think of it, there was.
Oh, no, no, it's-- it's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.
Get in what? W-With who?
Oh, a weird lady tried to give Penny a ride... but she wouldn't have anything to do with trashy people like them.
Trashy people? Who?
She and her partner run a sleazy pawn shop down the street.
Miss Bianca, we must go down there and investigate.
Suit yourself, but you'd be wasting your time going down there.
She could be in real trouble.
We gotta find her and help her.
Yeah, but two little mice.
What-- What can you do?
Bernard, uh, a child's book!
It's Penny's!
Then, uh--
Then she's gotta be here.
W-What's so funny?
Y-Your tail!
Here, here, let me help you fix it.
Who could be ringing at this time of night?
Madame Medusa's
Pawn Shop Boutique.
- Hello, boss.
- Snoops!
Don't tell me, Snoops.
Let me guess. You found it!
You've found the diamond!
Give you time?
You bungler!
You have been down there for three months.
Bottles? What bottles?
You caught Penny sending messages in bottles?
You blundering fool!
Can't you control a little girl?
Shut up! I am taking the next flight down to Devil's Bayou!
This is terrible.
We've got to go with her.
Yeah, come on.
In the suitcase.
Bumbling boob.
He fouls up everything.
Leave him for a few weeks and--
Oh, why won't this stupid thing close?
Out of my way, you road hog!
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4.
Hurry-- Hurry, Miss Bianca! Medusa could be down at the Devil's Bayou by now.
Oh, I'm sorry, but-- but a lady does have to pack a few things, you know.
Will Mr.Jenkins report to the ticket counter, please?
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4, now departing.
Flight leaves 6:45.
Oh, no, we missed the flight.
- Miss Bianca, if you hadn't--
- You worry too much.
You know that flights are always late.
Albatross Flight 1 3 to Tower.
Albatross 1 3.
Now, what did I tell you?
We are lucky, Mr. Bernard.
Luck? Flight 1 3?
Maybe we'd better take the train.
Wake up.!
Dad-rad it.! Somebody answer down there.!
Get off the dime.!
Hello.! Hello.!
Is there anybody down there?
Uh, h-h-hello?
Where have you been, oh,you lazy knucklehead?
W-We-We just got here, sir.
Uh, uh, see, my co-agent insisted on packing her, uh--
Look, bud, am I clear to land?
Traffc up here is thicker than fleas on a hound dog's--
Wo-Wow.! Dad-blast,you dirty road hog-- road hog-- Crazy--
Look-- One at a time--
You stupid, lunkheaded--
- Uh, what did he say, Mr. Bernard?
- I wouldn't dare repeat it.
Well, then give him the permission to land.
Uh, Captain, you, uh-- you have our permission to land.
- Well, it's about time, bud.!
- Look! Look! There he is!
Doesn't he fly beautifully?
And you wanted to take the train, you 'fraidy cat.
'Fraidy cat?
It's just that, uh--
No, I-I like trains.
I mean, they serve, uh, Roquefort, uh--
Pull up! Pull up!
Are-- Are--
Are you hurt, sir?
Nope.
One of my better landings, bud.
Oh, great.
Come on. We're--
We're gonna take the train.
Play it safe.
Train? Safe?
Listen here, buster.
-I'm as fit as a fiddle.
-And you look simply wonderful, Captain.
Oh, shucks,just call me Orville, little lady.
All right, all right, uh, it's most important we get to Devil's Bayou.
Well, now, will you just keep your shirt on?
Flight 1 3 hits the wild blue yonder in five minutes.
Eight, nine, ten, eleven... twelve-- Oh, no.
There are 1 3 steps on this ramp.
Well, why don't you jump the last one?
This is your captain speaking.
Welcome aboard, folks.
Fasten your seat belts. No smoking.
Just sit back and leave the driving to me.
Miss Bianca, be sure it's fastened good and tight.
I can't.
It'll wrinkle my dress.
Say, bud, read the checklist to me.
Uh, oh, yeah.
Goggles down.
- Check.
- Wing flaps down.
- Check.
- Tail feathers.
- Double check.
''If at first you don't succeed... try, try again.''
And here we go!
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Oh, I just love takeoffs!
Captain, you fly beautifully.
It's just like being on a ''roller scoater.''
- He just went through a red light.
- Oh, I do that all the time, darling.
Now, come on.
Stop worrying.
Come along
Will there be sunshine shinin'
Will we find a silver linin'
Come along
Sing a song
When today becomes tomorrow
Will we findjoy or sorrow
Sing a song
Is it wrong
To put all our hopes together
And wish for somethin'better
Is it wrong
To be loved
To face the future with another
Who means more than any other
Is to be loved
We'll paint the grey clouds
With pretty rainbow hues
And we'll brush the gloom away
And save it for a rainy day
Rainy day
Oh, today
If troubles cast a shadow
And shadows make the sun afraid to stay
Why, it's okay
'Cause there'll be sunshine shinin'
And we'll find the silver linin'
Another day
Uh, listen to this.
It says here Devil's Bayou is uncharted and hazardous.
Each day's operations...
Hmm, interesting. must be...
Good night, dear. planned with... care and--
Tomorrow is another day
Good night, Bianca.
How I hope you'll always stay
Penny!
Penny?
Penny, answer me!
Penny?
Snoops!
Snoops, get down here!
W-W-What's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
That little brat has escaped again.
Nero, Brutus, bring her back, boys.
Why won't it start?
Snoops! What's wrong?
W-W-What's wro-- I don't-- I don't know.
It was working good yesterday.
Oh, shut up!
Send up flares!
Light up the swamp so I can find her!
Well, folks, we'll be landing at Devil's Bayou in just a minute.
Your crew thanks you for flying Albatross Air--
What in the--
Sufferin' sassafras!
My rudder's on fire!
Bail out! Bail out!
Help!
Bernard!
Mayday! Mayday!
Sufferin' catfish!
What on earth?
Luke! Luke, wake up!
Luke, get down here!
It's Orville!
Oh, that Orville.
No, Luke, no. He's in trouble!
You get down here right now!
I'm a-comin'.
Wow-wee!
This new batch really packs a wallop!
Look out below!
Oh, what a shame.
Here, honey, let me help you.
Say, cousin, you look like you could use a swig of this.
It's good for what ails ya.
There.
Where are you folks from, anyway?
We're--
We're from New Y-- New York.
Now, stand back, folks. I ain't gonna hang around this creepy place long.
Clear the runway!
Great balls of fire!
Holy smoke!
Why don't you watch where you're goin'!
Bernard, it's that terrible Medusa.
I'd like to give her a few whacks with my rollin' pin.
We swamp folks would like to run her clean out of our bayou.
Hold it. Hold it!
Somebody's comin' this way.
Why did you have to go and spoil everything?
Nero, don't you dare get my teddy bear wet.
Oh, it's that poor little young 'un.
She's tryin' to run away again.
It's Penny.
Oh, how terrible.
Hurry! We've got to find out where they're taking her!
You'll need a boat. Evinrude's got the fastest boat around here.
Evinrude, wake up!
Start up your engine, boy!
Send Evinrude back as soon as you need help.
I'll round up the neighbors!
Faster!
Evinrude, faster!
You stop that, Brutus.
This fog is awful.
You can't see a thing.
Sl-Slow down, Evinrude.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
Oh, dear! We've lost them!
Jehoshaphat!
Hang on!
Hard to port, Evinrude!
Help me, Bernard!
Help! Bernard!
Bianca!
C-Come on, Evinrude.
Give it all you've got.
Keep trying, Evinrude.
Poor Evinrude.
Your carburettor is all pooped out.
Bring her right on in, boys.
Come on.
So, you tried to run away.
Well, it didn't work, did it? Huh?
Put me down, Brutus!
Cranky old dragon.
Nice work. Good boys.
W-W-Wait, boys. Steady, boy.
D-D-Down, boys. Heel. Heel!
There, there, Teddy.
I won't let them do that to you again. Don't cry.
Oh, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.
Poor Teddy.
All she ever thinks about is that simple bear.
Now, you behave, or I'll let Nero and Brutus have your old teddy bear.
You will not!
Besides, I'm not scared of'em... like you are, Mr. Snoops.
Oh, don't you sass me.
Ah, uh, boys, take this naughty little girl to her room.
I can go by myself, thank you.
Stick around, Evinrude.
We'll-- We'll signal if we need you.
Look out! Here she comes!
Where is she? Where is she?
Ah, eh, w-where is she?
Oh, I-I sent her up to her room.
Why did you let her escape?
What is your alibi this time, nitwit?
Nitwit?
Well, don't blame me, Medusa.
Those leather-headed lizards of yours, they're supposed to be patrolling the island.
They let her get away.
Ha! My precious pets.
We know who caught that ungrateful little brat, don't we, hmm?
It was your brilliant idea to use the little girl for this caper.
- If you'd left it to me--
- Snoops, you're not thinking.
I know, I know. She's the only one small enough to squeeze down the black hole.
Yes, but why can't she find my big diamond?
I don't know, but-- but just look at these beauties that she brought up from the cave.
Oh, they'll sell for a lot of cold cash.
Ow!
I wish you wouldn't do that.
She's insane. Utterly mad.
I want that diamond.
I've got to have the Devil's Eye!
You didn't leave the girl down in the cave long enough.
She won't take orders.
You are too soft.
But the water was rising and the tide was coming in... and all she did down there was fuss about her teddy bear getting wet.
Snoops, you don't have a way with children.
You must gain their confidence... make them like you.
Yeah? How do you do that?
You force them to like you, idiot!
At the next low tide...
I am going to put her down there myself... and keep her there... until she finds it.
And it is as simple as that.
Oh, it's as simple as that, is it?
Well, you're the boss, uh, boss.
Yes.
Now come along, petsy-poos.
We gotta get Penny out of here tonight.
-Uh-oh. Bianca, they smell your perfume.
-Oh, dear.
- Oh, no!
- Mis Bianca!
Let go, you-you-you, you big bullies, you!
Brutus! Nero!
Stop that infernal racket!
I mean now!
Snoops! Snoops, a mouse!
Oh, kill it, kill it!
Oh, Snoops, kill it!
Look! There's another one!
Oh, what is wrong with this thing?
Snoops! What's wrong?
I don't--
E-E-Evinrude, over here!
Are you--
Are you all right, dear?
Why, she-- she tried to kill us.
That-- That-- That terrible woman!
Oh, if I was only a ten-foot mouse,
I'd show her.
It's-- It's no use, Bianca.
Maybe Rufus the cat was right.
Wh-What can two little mice do?
R-E-S-C-U-E
Rescue Aid Society
But, Bernard, the Society's counting on us.
We can't quit now.
Oh, and that little girl.
We've just got to rescue her.
Rescue Aid Society
Heads held high
Penny dear!
Auntie Medusa wants to talk to you!
High tide or not... that little brat is going to find me that diamond... tomorrow... or else!
Come in. Come in.
Did you want to see me, ma'am?
Why, yes, my dear.
Don't be so shy.
Now, I am going to let bygones be bygones.
Do you know what would make
Auntie Medusa very happy?
Yes, you want me to find that diamond.
That's right, dear!
But I've tried hard as I could, honest.
Of course you have.
But we must try harder, mustn't we?
Then please will you take me back to the orphanage like you promised?
Penny, don't you like it here?
A big, beautiful boat all to yourself.
But if I don't get back to the orphanage...
I'll never get 'dopted.
Adopted?
What makes you think anyone would want... a homely little girl like you?
Be brave, little one
Make a wish
For each sad little tear
Hold your head up
Though no one is near
Someone's waiting for you
Don't cry, little one
There'll be a smile
Where a frown used to be
You'll be part of the love that you see
Someone's waiting for you
Always keep a little prayer
In your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon there'll bejoy and happiness
And your little world
Will be bright
Have faith, little one
Till your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave
Little one
Someone's waiting
To love
You
Good night, Teddy.
Sleep tight.
Oh, we almost forgot to say our prayers.
Please bless Rufus and Teddy... and all the kids at the orphanage--
Jennifer, Bobby, Mary,Julie.
And please let someone find my bottle.
There's a message in it.
Because running away isn't working. Amen.
Don't worry, Teddy. We'll--
We'll be all right.
Penny. Penny.
Yes?
Penny-- Penny, dear, now don't cry.
We are here to help you.
We-- Hi!
Where'd you come from?
We found the bottle with-- with your message, and we've come to rescue you.
Did you hear that, Teddy?
Our bottle worked!
Didn't you bring somebody big with you... like the police?
Uh, no, there's-- there's just the-- the two of us.
But if the three of us work together, and we have a little faith--
That's what Rufus said.
Faith makes things turn out right.
Penny, I know it's late, but we have to escape tonight, right now.
But I just got caught by Brutus and Nero.
Look what they did to my pants.
Yeah, and they're-- they're still down there guarding the gangplank.
Oh, those vicious monsters.
They ought to be locked up in a cage.
I know, I know.
Come on. I'll show you.
See there? The elevator.
Oh, it's a perfect cage, Penny.
Great idea.
Now, uh, wha-wha-- what can we use for bait?
Oh, they'll eat anything.
- Yeah, I know.
- I've got it.
My perfume. Remember? They'll follow the scent right into the elevator.
And I'll slam the door.
And would that make Medusa mad.
Brutus! Nero!
Did you let that little brat escape again?
You're too soft.
Hey, Penny, that's not bad.
That's exactly like Medusa.
Track her down, boys.
Bring her back.
And we'll be so far ahead, they'll never catch us.
Wait a minute. She-- She might catch us in-- in her swamp-mobile.
We'll swipe it.
I've always wanted to drive it.
Wh-What if Medusa wakes up wh-wh-while we're starting it?
W-We're in trouble.
We-We've gotta stall 'em somehow.
How 'bout Mr. Snoop's fireworks?
We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom.
That will keep her busy.
Oh, Bernard, it's so exciting.
Perfume, crocs, swamp-mobiles.
It's just got to work.
It's our only chance.
But-- But we're gonna need help.
Snoops! Snoops, get down here!
Uh, w-what's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
Oh, shut up!
High tide or not--
I bet those two are up to something.
Gee, I don't wanna go down that awful black hole again.
Don't worry about that, dear.
You must hurry and get dressed.
Come on.
We haven't got much time.
E-Evinrude? Uh, up here.
W-We need help.
G-Go get Ellie Mae.
An-And hurry!
Ya-hoo!
Are you ready to help rescue that little young 'un?
- Sure enough, Ellie Mae.
- Hallelujah!
Luke! On your feet, you lazy critter!
Shucks, Ellie Mae. I was just a-waitin' for someone to holler ''charge''!
Dagnab it. Let's cut out the jawin' and get a-goin'!
When old Gramps gets ''het'' up, his nose gets plumb out of joint.
Take it easy, Gramps.
We gotta stay here till Evinrude brings us word from them mice.
If'n that bug don't get here soon... they'll put that poor little girl down the black hole again.
All right, you little brat. Now, you are gonna go down in that hole... and you are gonna dig till you find me the diamond.
You understand that?
And no sassing me.
Uh-uh-uh. Snoops, that is no way to speak... to our little Miss Penny.
What? Oh.
Okay, boss, okay.
Now, my dear... you are going to find the big, shiny diamond... for your Auntie Medusa.
Aren't you?
Teddy doesn't like it down there.
He's afraid.
Aren't you, Teddy?
Ah. Poor Teddy.
I'll just keep him up here with me, where he'll be safe.
Give me back my teddy bear!
He's mine! He's mine!
You get down there and find the big diamond... or you will never see that Teddy again!
All right, all right.
I'll go.
Boss, you've really got a way with kids.
Don't worry, Teddy.
I won't be gone long.
I'll find her old diamond.
Oh, what a dreadful, frightening place.
Yeah, it used to be a pirates' cave.
How do you know that, Penny?
- Him.
- Ah! Oh, dear!
Come on, girls. Let's-- Let's look for that diamond so we can get out of here.
Oh, I looked there already.
Medusa doesn't want those little ones.
What-- What's--
What's-- What's-- What's that?
That's where the water comes in.
I'm afraid to go over there.
Well, if I was a pirate... that's just where I'd hide the Devil's Eye.
I'll, uh-- I'll--
I'll go over and check it out.
Uh, come-- c-come to think of it... if I was a pirate, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't hide anything back there.
Bernard, look!
I can see something.
Come on.
- Come on. Let's see what it is.
- No, no, Bianca.
You-- You stay here.
I'll see if I can find a safe way over.
- Bianca!
- Oh! Hang on!
- Help!
- I'm coming!
- What are you doing down there?
- I'm looking.
Well, look faster.
Wow!
P-Penny, hold-- hold your lantern up again.
- Holy mackerel. That-- That's it.
- The Devil's Eye.
Penny, we found it!
We found it!
Medusa, I found it!
Let me look.
Let me look, Medusa!
Back! Ah, good girl.
Good girl, good girl!
Let's get it up here.
Look, it won't go through.
I can't get it out.
- What's taking so long?
- It's stuck tight.
Stuck tight?
You get that diamond, or you'll never see daylight again!
No, no, back! Back, Penny!
Oh, Penny, you'll fall!
For-- Forget the-- the diamond.
Let's get out of here before we drown.
The water's coming in.
Please pull me up.
Not until you get the diamond.
Penny, the-- the pirate sword.
Use-- Use the sword.
Penny! Penny, help!
I've got it! I've got it!
Hurry! P-Pull me up!
Faster, Snoops. Faster.
Pulling as fast as I can.
At last!
The Devil's Eye!
It's worth millions!
Just look at it.
Filled with power... for its owner.
Let me-- Let me look at it.
I can't--
Hey, that wasn't a very good look.
But I know that there's enough there to cut it into two equal shares.
You idiot!
Cut up a perfect gem?
And it's mine. It's all mine.
All yours? Half of it is mine, you double-crossing crook!
- Put me down, Brutus!
- It's mine! It's all mine!
- Double-crosser!
- Cheap pickpocket.
- Chiseler!
- Cheap crook!
Land's sakes!
It's Evinrude!
Oh, well, sure is a mess.
Where in tarnation you been, boy?
- What's happening?
- Do they want us now?
- Well, where are they?
- They're on the boat?
- Speak up, boy.
- Buck up! We mustn't be quitting now, must we?
Stand back!
Give poor Evinrude some air!
He's plumb tuckered out.
Here, son, this'll make a new bug out of you.
Charge! Ya-hoo!
We're gonna have us a rip-snortin' fight.
Yee-hoo! Charge!
Where'd everybody go?
I don't need any help from anybody!
Charge! Ya-hoo!
Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!
Shut up, Snoops, and don't move.
If either of you try to follow me... you'll get blasted!
You give me my teddy bear.
You promised.
Teddy goes with me, my dear.
I've become quite attached... to him.
My diamond!
My diamond!
Charge!
Now!
Now! Now!
Look out!
Oh, please start.
Advance the spark.
Not the horn, the spark lever.
Digger, hold this.
It's that doohickey on the steering wheel.
You-- You... and your infernal fireworks!
You-- You--
Oh, you dunderhead!
We're not getting any gas.
Fill her up, Luke.
Hurry. All of it!
Look out! The riverboat!
- We did it, Bianca!
- Hooray! Oh, Bernard!
Bernard, you're wonderful!
- We did it!
- We got her!
We sure showed that Medusa!
There goes... my diamond!
And because of a courageous little girl named Penny... the world's largest diamond, the Devil's Eye... is now in the Smithsonian Institute.
But what's even more important, folks... this little orphan's dream has come true.
Today she's being adopted.
-And here she is with her new mother and father.
- For she's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
From Morningside Orphanage
She's got a new mom and dad
Hooray for her mom and dad
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Bernard, I am so happy for Penny.
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Yeah, so y-you might say that...
- that Penny, uh, brought us together.
- From Morningside Orphanage
You are a darling.
Penny,you were a brave little girl to do what you did all by yourself.
Oh, I didn't do it all by myself.
Two little mice from the Rescue Aid Society helped me.
Mice? Rescue Aid Society?
Yes, they rescued me.
Uh, could I say hello to them?
Hello, Bianca.!
Hi, Bernard.!
You can talk to these little mice?
All the time.
Mice can talk like anybody.
Didn't you know that?
Well, uh, I didn't, but I do now, Penny.
Evinrude, what are you doing here?
It's another call for help.
Here, uh, uh... you're gonna need some volunteers.
But-- B-But, B-Bianca, we just--
Oh, Bernard, adventure, thrills... intrigue, travel, exotic places.
Oh, come on, darling. Let's go.
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Tomorrow is another day
How I hope you'll always stay
Tomorrow is another day
Long ago, the great Frith made the world.
He made all the stars...
and the world lived among the stars.
Frith made all the animals and birds...
and, at first, made them all the same.
Now, among the animals was El-ahrairah,
the Prince of Rabbits.
He had many friends...
and they all ate grass together.
After a time,
the rabbits wandered everywhere...
multiplying and eating as they went.
Then, Frith said to El-ahrairah:
"Prince Rabbit, if you cannot
control your people...
"I shall find ways to control them."
El-ahrairah would not listen,
and said to Frith:
"My people are the strongest
in the world."
This angered Frith, so he determined
to get the better of El-ahrairah.
He gave a present
to every animal and bird...
making each one different from the rest.
When the fox came,
and others like the dog and cat...
the hawk and weasel...
to them, Frith gave a desire to hunt
and slay the children of El-ahrairah.
El-ahrairah knew that Frith was
too clever for him, and he was frightened.
He had never before seen
the Black Rabbit of Death.
"My friend," said Frith,
"have you seen El-ahrairah?
"For I wish to give him a gift."
"No, I have not seen him."
So, Frith said,
"Come out, and I will bless you instead."
"No, I cannot. I am busy.
The fox and weasel are coming.
"If you want to bless me,
you will have to bless my bottom."
"Very well. Be it so."
And El-ahrairah's tail grew shining white,
and it flashed like a star.
And his back legs grew long and powerful.
He tore across the hill
faster than any creature in the world.
"All the world will be your enemy,
Prince with a Thousand Enemies.
"And whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.
"But first, they must catch you...
"digger, listener, runner.
"Prince with the swift warning.
"Be cunning and full of tricks...
"and your people
will never be destroyed."
Along the edge of that wood, there.
Enjoyed many a game pie from it, too.
You can't hold back progress.
Shame, though.
It's gone 8:00, and I told Elizabeth we'd go into Newbury this evening.
Old sun sets so late in summer, it's morning before...
I think it's safe now, Fiver.
There's still something strange about the warren this evening.
Is it dangerous?
It's not exactly danger. It's...
I don't know. Something oppressive.
Like thunder.
It seems safe enough now, though.
Come on, see if you can find me a coltsfoot. If you can't, no one can.
- What's going on?
- It's only that runt, Fiver.
Jumping at bluebottles again.
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Fiver found it, Toadflax.
And we'll eat it.
Coltsfoot are for Owsla. You know that.
Tell you the truth,
I'm getting sick and tired of it.
Sometimes I feel like clearing out of the warren altogether.
Never mind. Let's forget it, and try to enjoy the evening.
Hazel?
Hazel, this is where it comes from.
I know now that terrible thing is coming.
- What do you mean?
- Look.
The field! The field!
- It's covered with blood!
- Blood? Don't be silly.
All right, Fiver. It's getting dark.
- We should get back to the burrow.
- Back to the burrow?
It'll come there. Don't think it won't.
It's all around us.
Now, stop it, Fiver.
We've got to go away from here. All of us.
- Go away? What, the whole warren?
- Yes, before it's too late.
You're being silly.
They'll think you're out of your mind.
You must listen to me, Hazel.
Something very bad is going to happen.
We'd better try and see the Chief Rabbit.
You can tell him about it.
I don't expect he'll like the idea at all.
We've got to go away from the warren!
All of us!
- Go away?
- Yes, before it's too late.
Is something wrong?
- What's the matter?
- Is there danger?
Come on. Let's find out what's happened.
- Hazel? It is Hazel, isn't it?
- It is.
- What are you doing here?
- We want to see the Chief Rabbit, Bigwig.
"We"? You mean he wants to see him, too?
- Yes.
- I must.
- What's it all about?
- Bigwig? What do they want?
- They want to see the Chief Rabbit.
- What for?
- I have to...
- Send them away.
I'll take care of it, Holly.
Look, Bigwig, when have I ever asked to see the Chief Rabbit before?
All right.
Wait here.
Excuse me, sir. These two outskirts have asked to see you.
Is it all right if I bring them down?
Come on, then, though I'll probably get my ears chewed off for this.
Now, Walnut.
- It is Walnut, isn't it?
- No, sir. Hazel.
I knew your mother well. And your friend?
- My brother, sir. Fiver.
- Your brother.
Now, do tell me how I can help you.
Well, he says there's a bad danger coming to our warren.
A bad danger.
How very upsetting.
Now, what sort of danger, I wonder?
I don't know. But it's bad. It's so bad.
Well, now. What ought we to do?
- Go away. All of us. Now.
- Now? In May?
The mating season?
And where would we go to?
He's had these feelings before, and he's been right again and again.
I shall have to consider this very carefully.
Perhaps we'll discuss it later, in the summer.
We can't wait!
It's been good of you to come, Walnut.
Bigwig!
- Bigwig.
- Sir?
- What was that all about?
- Well, sir...
Your duty as an officer is to protect this burrow.
- Yes, sir.
- Those two lunatics...
Yes, sir.
- Who's that?
- It's me.
- Dandelion?
- No, Blackberry.
Dandelion told me you were leaving the warren tonight.
- If it's true, I'd like to come along.
- We'd like to come along, too.
- I don't much like the look of things.
- We must get everyone.
That Toadflax fellow followed me down the run.
It could mean the Owsla has been turned out tonight.
Then the sooner we're off, the better.
It's the Owsla. They're coming.
- There aren't many of you left, are there?
- Bigwig? Are you off duty?
Off duty, and likely to remain off.
I've left the Owsla.
Fiver, I've been thinking about what you said.
- We're leaving.
- Leaving? All of you? Where to?
We don't know exactly. But we're going.
- You're all under arrest!
- Under arrest?
- What do you mean?
- What for?
Spreading dissension, inciting to mutiny.
- There's a bad danger coming.
- It's not good.
You'll all come with me.
Is he alone?
I am captain of Owsla.
Go, now, or we'll kill you.
It's you who'll be killed.
- Bigwig!
- Yes, you know me.
- He'll come back with the Owsla soon.
- Right. Well, I think I'll come with you.
Hazel, we'll have to stop here.
Fiver and that other half-size, we're all in.
They need to rest.
He's right, Hazel.
Look. Once we're beyond the woods... we'll really be clear of the Owsla.
We can rest then.
I've never been in a wood before, Hazel.
It looks dangerous.
Follow me.
A lendri!
This way.
- It had just killed. I saw blood on its lips.
- Lucky for us, it had.
Otherwise, it might have been quicker.
- We shall have to cross it.
- Cross it? Who's going to cross it?
- What do you want to cross it for?
- Are you sure about this?
Yes. But I don't think I can swim, Hazel.
I'm worn out.
- Pipkin is even worse off than me.
- We can't just sit here.
I know what we ought to be looking for.
A high, lonely place with dry soil... where we can see and hear all around, and men hardly ever come.
- There's a dog loose in the wood.
- Well, that does it.
- A dog?
- Come on.
What do you think will happen when he picks up our scent?
Those that can swim, swim.
The others will have to make out the best they can.
That's not good enough.
We got into this together, we'll get out of it together.
Hazel, look.
It floats.
That's it. That's it!
Fiver, get on, quickly.
Silver, Bigwig, get your nose under it.
Push it out.
Quickly!
Keep still!
- Are you all right?
- Of course.
That was a good idea of yours, Blackberry.
Yes. Let's try to remember it.
Might come in handy again.
- Does anyone know where we're going?
- Hazel does, I'm sure.
I've never seen anything like that before.
- The man-thing killed it.
- A man-thing?
A hrududu. It runs on it.
- The what?
- The hrududu.
- It runs on it?
- Yeah, faster than we can.
- It's dangerous, then. It could catch us.
- No, no.
It won't take any notice of us at all.
I'll show you.
Watch this.
See? It's not interested.
What are you waiting for?
Well? Come along, then.
They need to rest, Hazel.
Something's up ahead.
A warm, friendly burrow, perhaps?
No, not a burrow. A field.
A great field of scented plants that will cover us until we're rested.
You're beginning to sound like a chief, Hazel.
- Hazel-rah.
- Hazel-rah?
That'll be the day I call him chief, that will.
Violet's gone.
We'd better keep moving.
We'll have to stop soon, Hazel.
They're frightened and tired.
Over there. We'll rest there.
Can't rest there. That's a man-place.
There are no men there now.
It looks all right.
What's happening back home, I wonder.
Think, when we lived in our own burrows:
Dry, soft, warm bodies.
- Now, look, we can't go on like this.
- It gets worse the further we go.
Where are we going?
It won't be much longer.
Then we can all rest.
- How much longer?
- We never should have left.
- Suppose Fiver's all wrong?
- We want to go back and find out.
Go back? After all we've been through?
And probably get killed for wounding
Captain Holly, an Owsla officer?
- Talk sense, for Frith's sake.
- We must go on, until we reach the hills.
Those that go back will not...
Not safe...
I don't believe you know where you're going.
Now, listen to me, you bunch of mole-snouted, muckraking...
It looks like you've come a long way.
Do you live here?
Yes, this is our warren.
We need to stay here for a while.
Why not? We supposed you would.
But I don't think there are enough of you to live very comfortably on your own.
There are enough of us to protect ourselves.
Don't get upset.
Who are you? What do you want?
My name is Cowslip, and I don't want anything.
Yeah, what about the others?
We have plenty of empty burrows, if that's what you mean.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I hate the rain.
Funny smell.
We ought to have nothing to do with that Cowslip, or his warren.
It might be drier in there.
Whatever will he think of us if we don't go in?
- I'll tell you. He'll think we're afraid.
- Afraid? Who's afraid?
He seemed friendly enough.
What has he got to gain by asking us to join him?
We can't sit out here like fools.
Well, come along then.
They think I'm mad, but you know I'm not... and you still won't listen.
Hazel?
Come along, Fiver.
There's that smell again.
It's almost like man.
Oh, it's you, is it? How nice.
I'm so glad you've come.
This is rather a big warren.
Yes. Please, help yourself to flayrah.
There are fresh roots here daily.
The man throws it out.
Man? What man?
A lot of the burrows are lying empty, you know... so you're all welcome to any that you choose.
Where are all the others?
Please, eat all you like.
We'll leave you to your...
Where are they all?
Where? Try asking Cowslip
"where" anything.
They seem sad.
Like trees in November.
Well, I still think we've made a big change for the better.
Do you think the man puts the food out there because of a kind heart?
It's not poison.
There's something unnatural and evil and twisted about this place.
It feels like mist.
Like being deceived, and losing our way.
Some of us are gathering and suggesting stories.
- We're hoping you'll tell one.
- Hazel can tell you about our adventures.
How we had the good luck to join you.
Surely, there's no harm in that.
Dandelion, why don't you tell us the story of El-ahrairah?
El-ahrairah and his trickery don't really mean very much to us, charming as it is.
Rabbits will always need tricks.
No, we need dignity, and above all, the will to accept our fate.
As one of our poets is fond of saying, if I may quote...
- Yes, of course.
- Please, do.
"Where are you going, stream?
"Far, far away
"Take me with you, stream
"Take me on your dark journey
"Lord Frith, take me far away
To the hearts of light
"The silence, I give you my breath
- "My life, the silence"
- I've had enough!
- Where are you going?
- Away, to the hills.
By yourself, alone? You'll die.
- You're closer to death than I.
- Determined to ruin it for us, aren't you?
No!
Me, me, me. All the time.
"But, I'm in a mist."
- Bigwig!
- "Everything's bad!"
- No!
- "I've a funny feeling in my toe."
- No, no!
- I'm finished with you.
What's more,
I'm going to make sure everyone else is.
Bigwig, listen. You're in a snare. A snare.
Now, what did they tell you in Owsla?
Think.
No good biting wire.
Run to the warren and get the others.
Blackberry, Silver and Cowslip.
Be quick. He'll die.
Blackberry! Dandelion! Come quickly!
Come on. Hurry up. It's Bigwig.
He's still breathing. What can we do?
- We've got to loosen the wire somehow.
- Yes, but how?
- Is Cowslip coming? Maybe he knows.
- He wouldn't come.
- He told me to stop talking about it.
- He told you what?
This is it. The wire's on a peg.
We've got to dig it out.
The peg's narrower down there. It tapers.
I can't get my teeth into it.
Pipkin, you go in.
The splinters prick you.
It's hard to breathe.
The peg's nearly through.
Fiver, you go in.
I can't hear him breathing.
It's broken in two. It's free.
Bigwig, the peg's out. You're free.
I think he's gone.
We've got you out, Bigwig.
You're free.
- Bigwig, please don't die.
- It's no use.
We got you out.
What shall we do without him?
"My heart has joined the thousand
For my friend stopped running today"
You pay for it. The food, the warren. But no one must ever ask where anyone was... or speak of the wires.
The whole place is snared, everywhere.
- They left Bigwig to die.
- Silver's right.
Let's drive them out, take their warren and live there ourselves.
Yes. Back to the warren.
- Back to the warren.
- Embleer Frith, you fools!
That warren's nothing but a death hole.
Let's help ourselves to a roof of bones.
Who killed them?
Bigwig! You're alive!
- Are you all right?
- We thought you were dead.
- Let him alone. Let him rest.
- I don't have to rest.
- What do we do now, Fiver?
- Go away from here.
Look. Look.
That's the place for us. High, lonely hills... where the wind and the sound carry, and the ground's as dry as straw in a barn.
That's where we ought to be.
That's where we have to get to.
Pipkin.
Pipkin.
Pipkin!
Why don't we go and look around the farm?
Farm, Hazel? What for?
- Cats and dogs.
- I've got a little plan.
- Won't it be dangerous?
- Of course not.
- Is it safe?
- Of course.
- Let's all go.
- No.
Just you and me.
I think I see a dog.
Where? It's tied up.
Give it a wide berth. We don't want it to wake up the whole farm.
This is the BBC Home Service.
They are up. Hazel?
- Let's go back.
- Just a little further.
Rabbits. So, that's your secret plan.
I'm going inside to take a look around.
Is it safe in there?
Of course. You wait here.
- But if you see a cat...
- A cat?
- You will let me know at once, all right?
- Right.
I'm Hazel.
Hazel.
My name's Clover.
- Where do you come from?
- Far away.
My friends and I live as we please.
We eat grass, lie in the sun.
- Do you ever get out?
- Oh, yes.
Sometimes, a child takes us out on the grass.
- Would you like to join us?
- Join you? But how?
How can we join you?
Hazel! There's a cat outside.
I must go back to my friends.
But we'll be back, and any of you who wish can come along with us.
- Where is it?
- There. I think it smelt us.
- I'll get you away.
- Thank you.
- Just follow me closely.
- Yes.
- And run when I do.
- Run when you do.
You look hungry.
Rats getting too clever, I suppose.
I bet you can't run at all.
You pie-eyed, saucer-licking scrap-scraper.
Can you run?
You'll see.
I think not.
What's all that, then?
Tab? Tab!
Let them alone. Cruel thing.
What is it?
There's something coming up the line of the hedge.
- Can you see it?
- I hear it. It's something big.
- A cat?
- I don't know.
Bigwig!
Quiet. I want to listen.
Bigwig!
Bigwig!
It's the Black Rabbit of Inlè!
Don't talk like that. They'll go tharn.
We go by the will of the Black Rabbit.
- When he calls you, you have to go.
- Stay where you are.
- Who's there?
- All dead!
All gone!
It's Captain Holly!
- Holly, it's me, Bigwig.
- I found you.
I found you.
He's been hurt.
Look at that wound on his shoulder.
I remember you.
- You're the one that saw it coming.
- But what happened?
Our warren, destroyed.
Destroyed? How?
Men came. Filled in the burrows.
Couldn't get out.
There was a strange sound.
You see, the air turned bad.
Runs blocked with dead bodies.
We couldn't get out.
Everything turned mad.
Warren, herbs, roots, grass...
all pushed into the earth.
- Men have always hated us.
- No.
They just destroyed the warren because we were in their way.
They'll never rest until they've spoiled the earth.
I tried to find you.
I wandered for days.
The Efrafans wouldn't let me go.
They ripped my ear.
Ripped it.
I tried to find you.
Efrafans? What's he talking about?
Holly.
Let him be.
He's had a bad time.
He can tell us about it when he's rested.
A young doe has a request, sire.
A doe wants to see me?
Says she represents a group, sire.
I see.
- Your name?
- Hyzenthlay, sir.
Don't be frightened. You're safe here.
Get on with it!
Sir, several of us proposed an expedition to start... a new warren somewhere else.
- A new warren? Out of the question.
- But, you don't understand.
The system is breaking down.
Explain that.
We can't produce litters.
We're overcrowded.
I want no further discussion.
- We'll go as far as you like.
- Here or anywhere else.
Thank you, sir.
Campion, have her watched.
That's it, Hazel.
That's where we have to be.
Let me get this straight, Fiver.
- You want us to climb this, is that it?
- Yes!
Come on, Pipkin!
Come and look.
You can see the whole world!
I found a burrow, Hazel.
Under that beech hanger... with a great hall and no smell of death or disease.
Frith on the hills!
He made it all for us!
Frith may have made it, but Fiver found it.
- I've never seen anything like it.
- It's some kind of a bird.
Are you hurt?
Bigwig, I've got an idea.
- See if you can find some worms.
- Worms? Me, dig for worms?
What for, for Frith's sake?
I get up plenty soon.
- He's hurt and we want to help him.
- A bird? What for?
We help you.
Piss off!
What for help me?
What happened to you?
Damn cat jump me, farm cat.
We know her.
We take you to burrow.
Go away. Wing no good, but I walk plenty good.
- Is long way?
- Where you come from?
From big water.
My home by big water.
We go.
I thought everything would be fine once we got here, but it's not.
Because now we've got here,
I find it's not that simple.
What do you mean?
This place is as safe as Fiver said it was.
I think we've done very well for ourselves.
- But we don't have any does.
- Does?
Does.
Not one, and that means no kittens.
- And after we're gone, no warren.
- So that's why you went to that farm.
I thought we'd be able to get some hutch rabbits to join us.
What's to be done then, Hazel?
Set off again?
And where?
There's not been a sniff of another rabbit since we got here.
The bird, Kehaar.
We'll get the bird to search for us.
What home? This hole?
Where are mates? Where are chicks?
Mate make eggs, mate sit on eggs... hatch eggs, many eggs. We feed chick.
Egg robbers come, we fight.
You stupid bunnies!
You got no mates!
Where are mates?
Where are chicks?
Plenty trouble for you.
You need mates!
It's working, Hazel.
You got no brains. You no plan.
You need mate for plan.
Listen.
I got plan for you.
Wing better, I go fly.
Fly for you.
I find mates.
What a splendid idea, Kehaar!
How clever of you to think of it.
You very fine bird.
When will you be able to fly?
I fly any time. Stand back.
When I fly... Stand back.
Stand back. Back, back.
I need room.
Wings good.
Feathers clean.
I soar!
I glide!
I circle.
Then, I soar!
Bigwig said you couldn't make a friend out of him.
- He's probably gone back to the big water.
- I think you're right.
Blackberry, I want you to get Dandelion... and meet me here after the others are asleep.
- It's no good asking you not to go.
- It'll be perfectly safe, Fiver.
I'll take the greatest care.
Clover.
Clover!
Who's that?
It's me. We're back.
Hazel.
- What are you doing up there?
- I've come to let you out.
Will you come with us?
- We're all right here.
- Yes.
Good.
Come on.
Come on, move.
- Lucy's rabbits are out, look.
- Let's get them in, quick.
There's a wild rabbit, look.
There he goes.
Keep the torch on them.
I don't know, John, whether you hit it or not.
- I reckon he's in those nettles.
- Have a look, then.
I hit him, all right.
That's blood down there, see?
That don't signify.
He might be a long way off by now.
I reckon you've lost him.
No, we ain't.
Fiver, there's been some trouble.
Hazel's been shot.
No.
The Black Rabbit serves Lord Frith... but he does no more than his appointed task.
Hazel's not dead.
Perfect landing.
Hazel's been wounded.
The farm man shot him.
Come on, follow me.
Come on!
- You get black stones out?
- What do you mean?
Always with gun is coming little black stones.
You never see?
Take out black stones, he get better.
Let me see leg.
Many stones.
Did you find anything on your flight?
- Efrafa.
- Can you guide us there?
Many rabbits.
Too many rabbits.
We wouldn't be enough to fight one of their patrols.
What do you mean?
You see this? They did it to me.
It's an identification mark.
Tells you when you can be above ground.
- What do you mean? Who's to stop you?
- Their Owsla.
Their chief is called Woundwort.
General Woundwort.
I don't think even you would
match up to him, Bigwig.
Under him are captains,
each one in charge of a mark.
If you're found above ground
at the wrong time...
they take you before the council
for punishment.
Some of them must get away.
They caught one trying to run away
when I was there.
Blackavar was his name.
When they'd finished with him,
both his ears were ripped to shreds...
worse than this one of mine.
He was lucky not to have been killed.
There was another one, a doe, Hyzenthlay.
I couldn't have escaped without her help.
- Why didn't she go with you?
- She wouldn't go without the others.
Then some might be persuaded to leave?
Yes, but you'd never get them out of Efrafa.
You got out.
Only because Lord Frith
sent one of his great messengers.
I didn't see what happened to them.
It must have cut them down.
It's not going to be easy, but we don't have much choice.
- We'll start off as soon as I'm fit to travel.
- I don't like this idea of yours at all.
Holly, I want you to stay here.
You're known to them and it could be dangerous for you.
I've been in Efrafa, and I tell you you're making a bad mistake... that might very well get you all killed.
There's a homba.
No one move. Keep still, all of you.
- What's he up to?
- Trying to draw it off, I suppose.
Frith and Inlè!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, hurry!
- Aren't you wounded?
- Never better! Let's go!
- What was that all about?
- I just lost my head, Hazel.
I've been strung up all day, thinking about Efrafa.
Anyway, I feel a lot better now.
Why did you cry out, if you're all right?
I didn't. I just stopped limping, you know, ready to run really fast... when I bumped into a group of rabbits, face to face.
I tried to warn them about the homba, but all they did was try to stop me.
One of them said, "You stay here."
So I knocked him down, I had to, and raced off.
- Next thing I heard was this squeal.
- So the homba got the other rabbit?
He must have.
After all, I led them right into it.
But I never saw what happened.
It's not to rest here, they come.
A patrol?
Yeah, is coming for find you, is go!
You go to river, then they not find you.
All of you, under that bridge unless you want your ears chewed off.
Yeah, come along.
By other side iron road.
I think maybe they no like for go across iron road.
Hazel, you go on.
This may be my chance to get into Efrafa.
But it's too...
All right, take care.
Now, Kehaar will meet you tomorrow, in that kale field.
Tell him what you've worked out.
Mr. Hazel, what wait for?
He's right, Hazel, you must go now.
We'll go down to the river and wait there for you to tell us what to do.
I want you to find some way to keep them from following us.
Go on now, before we're all caught!
It's a wide patrol. Be careful, Hyzenthlay.
Sir, we've picked up this hlessi and brought him in.
- Who are you?
- My name is Bigwig.
"Bigwig, sir!"
- What were you doing?
- I've come to join Efrafa.
- Why?
- Surprised you ask... sir.
Is there anything odd about wanting to join?
I'll ask the questions. What can you do?
I can run and fight.
- Fight, can you?
- I've been an officer in an Owsla.
So, you came to join us.
I thought you might have some use for me.
Well, for the time being, you'll be assigned a post in the patrol.
You'll take orders from Captain Campion.
If you want a doe, you have your choice here.
You're not an officer for nothing.
Thank you, sir.
And... you'll be identified by your mark.
Those Efrafans will be fast and savage.
I need to find a way to get away from them.
If what Holly says is true, we couldn't possibly stand and fight them.
Then we'll have to find another way.
What on earth is that, Kehaar?
Him fish.
Hazel, come and look at this.
What is it?
Is boat. Man make them go on water.
It floats, Hazel.
It floats.
Aren't you going to silflay?
I don't silflay at this time, sir.
Tell him why you're here, Blackavar.
I come here for the mark to...
I come here for the mark to see me... how I've been punished for trying to leave the warren.
The council were merciful.
He keeps trying to run away.
Captain Campion caught him this time.
His ears were ripped and he is to show himself... at every morning and evening silflay as an example to the others.
If you ask me, he won't last much longer.
He'll meet a blacker rabbit than himself one of these nights.
That doe over there, what's her name?
Fancy her, do you?
She's called Hyzenthlay, but look elsewhere, she's a troublemaker.
The council's got their eye on her.
You go now, talk to Bigwig.
Yeah, I go talk to Mr. Bigwig.
He'll be in field by arch on the iron road.
Go find him.
By the iron road? Yeah, I go and find him.
He'll tell you the plan.
He tell me the plan? I know the plan!
Now don't attract attention.
Of course not, of course not.
I be quiet. I be clever.
They no see me. Kehaar, Kehaar.
You wait here.
- Hyzenthlay.
- Sir?
I want to talk with you.
I am in the mark and under your orders, sir.
Do you remember a pale gray rabbit called Holly, you helped escape?
- You've made a mistake, sir.
- Listen, Hyzenthlay, listen carefully.
I'm from a warren where life is free, where you can live as you wish.
I've come to bring you out of Efrafa, as many as will come.
You might be a spy, sent by the council.
You know I'm not.
Will you join us, and persuade your friends, as well?
Trust me. My friends are not far away.
My courage, my spirit is so much less than it was.
We can escape from Efrafa, believe me.
Yes.
I think I do.
- Listen carefully.
- Yeah!
We're ready. We leave at sunset.
Ready good!
There will be lots of us.
We'll meet you at the iron bridge.
- When?
- Sunset.
Good! Good. Sunset.
Then you must guide us to the river.
- Plenty good trick.
- Trick, what trick?
Listen, if you see a patrol following us you must drive them away, terrify them.
Yeah, I fly at them.
Remember: sunset.
You plenty good fellow.
It's set.
When?
Get them to the near hind mark at sunset, just before early silflay.
- Suppose something happens?
- Nothing will happen. We can do it.
Yes.
I think we can.
Sometimes I can tell when things are true.
Sometimes I can see it.
A high down with trees and...
I've become foolish.
You'll have to meet this friend of mine.
He talks just like that.
We'll be ready.
Sunset, then. And a bird will fight for us.
- A bird?
- Even Woundwort won't expect that.
Bigwig!
That white bird you were talking to this morning...
- Talking to, sir?
- You were very close to it. Why?
Well, I've never been hurt by a bird.
That's not what I asked.
To tell you the truth, sir,
I think I was trying to impress you.
In future, stay in your own mark.
Sir.
One more thing:
What do you know about a homba?
- A homba, sir?
- You led it onto some rabbits?
I didn't intend to.
I didn't know they were there.
You didn't report it.
Everything out of the ordinary is to be reported.
I didn't know running from a homba was out of the ordinary.
That was a patrol on the track of a band of strangers.
Do you know anything about them?
I saw some tracks, but I can't tell you anymore than that, sir.
I'm taking out a wide patrol tomorrow.
We'll cross the iron road and try to pick up their tracks.
I want you to come along.
Yes, sir.
Campion, follow him.
Don't let him out of your sight.
I've been told to tell you early silflay has been canceled this evening.
No one told me anything about it.
Have a look over there and you'll see why.
Now, Blackavar.
The new officer, sir, he's gone.
Bigwig?
He's wounded Sherbil and taken a crowd of the mark with him.
I'll blind him. I'll blind him!
- Bigwig, where's the bird?
- He'll be here.
He'd better!
Where is that bird?
What I am doing here?
I am wait for long time.
Is no sunset. Is no good here.
Where are they?
They should be here by now.
Silver, go up to the iron bridge and see if you can find them.
They're coming.
Bigwig, the general!
What will we do?
It nearly came off.
We'll take one or two of them with us before it's finished.
Bigwig?
You traitors!
Campion, get this miserable group back to their marks.
I'll settle with you myself, Bigwig.
No need to take you back.
Come on and try, you crack-brained slave driver.
Get away, blast you!
Get away, you damned white bird!
Straight ahead, to the river.
Keep going, it's a friend.
- You did it, Bigwig. You did it.
- I did, didn't I?
It's not over yet.
They gone.
Keep going, down to the river.
- The general's behind me.
- Where do we go, Hazel?
I trusted you, Bigwig.
You can trust me now.
You'll either go into the river or be torn to pieces.
There's nowhere left to run.
Campion, Lily... when I give the word, we go straight into them.
- That bird can't save you now.
- There it is!
What you do now?
We're going back to our warren, Kehaar.
Good. You go, I go.
Is finish here for me.
- I go to big water!
- Take care of that wing.
Is winter plenty cold, then I come back.
Come back anytime.
And thank you, Kehaar.
Big water!
Get the holes filled in.
Everyone underground.
- What's the matter?
- The general.
- Where?
- The wood behind us.
- It's full of Efrafans.
- I'm not going back.
- Maybe we ought to leave.
- Anyone who wants to can go.
We went through a lot to get here, and I'm not leaving now.
Neither am I.
If I'm for the Black Rabbit, one or two from Efrafa will come with me.
We'll fill in the holes deep.
They'll have to dig us out.
They can't be out there long without attracting elil.
- The Efrafans will never give up.
- Maybe we should leave.
We're staying.
But there may be a better way.
- Let me come with you.
- No, they know you too well.
I'll go alone. Now, get those holes filled in.
I won't be long.
They'll take us back to Efrafa.
Their Owsla will.
Listen, we're not finished yet, not by a long shot.
You were one of those on the riverbank.
Did Bigwig send you?
I'm a friend of Bigwig's.
What was left unfinished on the riverbank will be finished now.
It would be better for both of us if we could come to terms.
Terms?
Very well.
These are my terms.
Hand over all the deserters immediately.
We couldn't agree to that.
But I can suggest something better, for both of us.
- You're in no position to bargain.
- We shouldn't be fighting each other.
We have enough enemies as it is.
Perhaps we should be together.
A joining of free, independent warrens.
I have no time for this nonsense.
- Shall I kill him, sir?
- No.
You take back our terms.
And you tell your chief, Bigwig, that if he and Hyzenthlay... and the others aren't waiting outside when I come for them...
I'll tear out every throat in the place.
Do you remember the rats in the barn?
We got out of that, all right.
Yes, we did. We got out of that, all right.
They're into the beech roots.
Start at this end.
- How cold!
- What is it? Are you all right?
I've tried to listen, only I can't hear it.
I'm going away, Hazel. I'm floating.
- Cold, how...
- Fiver. Fiver.
- Can you hear me?
- Listen.
They have something down there that's strange.
Get out, get out!
They had a great bird that turned into a shaft of lightning.
And there was another creature that took them away down the river.
- Here, I reckon we ought to go back home.
- Who said that?
- Nobody, sir.
- You were put there to dig. Get back to it.
Great Frith, stop him, Hazel.
The others are going tharn.
Wake up. Fiver, wake up.
There's a dog loose in the wood.
There's a dog loose in the wood.
"We need to cross
because there's a dog loose in the wood."
"There's a dog loose in the wood."
Bigwig, I need runners.
Dandelion, Blackberry.
Hyzenthlay can run.
Good. We've hardly any time.
I've got a plan.
If it works, it will finish Woundwort for good.
When we're gone, block this run and get everyone back behind the wall.
Hold them off as long as you can.
- Don't give in to them.
- Where are you going?
El-ahrairah will show me what to do.
Let them go.
It's their chief, Bigwig, I'm after.
Find their chief!
Hyzenthlay, you hide here.
When the time comes, get back to the warren.
- It will all depend on you.
- I'll be ready.
Lord Frith,
I know you've looked after us well...
and it's wrong to ask even more of you...
but my people are in terrible danger.
So, I'd like to make a bargain with you:
My life in return for theirs.
There is not a day or night
that a doe offers her life for her kittens...
or some honest captain of Owsla,
his life for his chief.
But there is no bargain.
What is, is what must be.
Blackberry, this is where we leave you.
Stay close and don't move.
Don't break too soon.
- Are you clear what's to be done?
- Yes.
You lie in the grass, just there, opposite him.
If we meet again, Hazel-rah... we'll have the makings of the best story ever.
And you'll be the one to tell it.
Can you run?
I think not.
I think not.
Tab! Tab!
I told you once,
I was trying to impress you.
I hope I have.
And I told you that I would kill you myself.
There's no white bird here, Bigwig.
Why throw your life away?
Hraka, sir.
Come out.
My chief's told me to defend this run.
Your chief?
Run! Run for your lives!
Come back! Come back, you fools!
Come back!
Come back and fight!
Dogs aren't dangerous!
General Woundwort's body
was never found.
It could be that he still lives his fierce life
somewhere else.
But from that day on,
mother rabbits would tell their kittens...
that if they did not do as they were told...
the General would get them.
Such was Woundwort's monument.
Perhaps it would not have displeased him.
El-ahrairah knew, then, that Frith was his friend.
Every evening, when Frith has done his day's work... and lies calm and easy in the red sky...
El-ahrairah and his children, and his children's children... come out of their holes and feed and play in his sight.
For they are his friends, and he has promised...
Hazel.
That they can never be destroyed.
Hazel.
- You know me, don't you?
- I don't.
Yes, my Lord.
I know you.
I've come to ask
if you would like to join my Owsla.
We shall be glad to have you,
and I know you'd like it.
You've been feeling tired, haven't you?
If you're ready, we might go along now.
You needn't worry about them.
They'll be all right...
and thousands like them.
If you'll come along,
I'll show you what I mean.
"All the world will be your enemy,
Prince with a Thousand Enemies.
"Whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.
"But first, they must catch you...
"digger, listener, runner.
"Prince with the swift warren.
"Be cunning...
"and your people
will never be destroyed."

You're going to be as beautiful as your mother.
Isn't she, Duchess?
Careful, Toulouse.
You're making it very difficult for Edgar.
Whoa, Frou-Frou, whoa.
Steady, girl.
Thank you, Edgar.
Oh. Of course, Frou-Frou.
I almost forgot.
Madame... uh, may I take your parcel, Madame?
It really is much too heavy for you, Madame.
Now, tut-tut, Edgar.
Don't fuss over me.
Berlioz, come back here.
Haven't you forgotten something, darling?
Thank you, Miss Frou-Frou, for letting me ride on your back.
You're quite welcome, young man.
How was that, Mama?
Very good, darling.
That was very nice.
Come along, Duchess. Kittens.
Come along.
Oh, and Edgar,
I'm expecting my attorney,
Georges Hautecourt.
You'll remember him, of course.
Of course, Madame.
How could anyone forget him?

Come on, Edgar! The last one up the stairs is a nincompoop!
Could we take the elevator this time, sir?
Oh, that birdcage? Poppycock.
Elevators are for old people. Whoops!
May I give you a hand, sir?
You haven't got an extra foot, have you, Edgar?
That always makes me laugh, sir.
Every time.
- Whoo!
- Let go of my cane!
Careful, sir. Please.
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Don't panic, Edgar.
Upward and onward! Whee!
Am I going too fast for you, Edgar?
Please, sir, hold...
There now, Duchess. That's better.
We must both look our best for Georges.
He's our oldest and dearest friend, you know.
Come in.
Announcing...
Monsieur...
Georges...
Hautecourt.
Oh, my goodness, Edgar.
I know Georges.
Adelaide, my dear.
So good to see you, Georges.
Aaah!
Still the softest hands in all Paris.
You're a shameless flatterer, Georges.
Adelaide, that's music.
It's from Carmen, isn't it?
That's right. It was my favourite role.
Yes, yes.
It was the night of your grand premiere that we first met. Remember?
- Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success.
Champagne, dancing the night away...
Oh, Georges.
Oh, ho!
Thank goodness.
Just in time.
Ah, Georges.
We're just a pair of sentimental old fools.
Now, Georges, do be serious.
I've asked you to come here on a very important legal matter.
Oh? Oh!
Splendid, splendid.
Who do you want me to sue, eh?
Come now, Georges. I don't wish you to sue anyone.
I simply want to make my will.
Will, eh? Will, will...
Now, then, who are the beneficiaries?
Well, as you know, I have no living relatives.
Naturally, I want my beloved cats to be always well-cared for.
Certainly, no one can do this better than my faithful servant, Edgar.
Edgar?
Adelaide, you mean to say you're leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?
Everything you possess?
Stocks and bonds?
This mansion? Your country chateau?
Your treasures, jewels, and...?
Oh, no, no, Georges.
- To my cats.
- To your cats?
Cats?
Yes, Georges.
I simply wish to have the cats inherit first.
Then, at the end of their lifespan, my entire estate will revert to Edgar.
Cats inherit first?
And I come after the cats.
I, me, after...
It's... it's not fair.
Whoo! I mean, whoo.
Each cat will live about 12 years.
I can't wait... And each cat has nine lives.
That's four times 12...
Multiply by nine times...
No, it's less than that. Anyway, it's much longer than I'd ever live.
I'll be gone.
No.
Oh, no. They'll be gone.
I'll think of a way.
Oh... there are a million reasons why I should.
All of 'em dollars.
Millions.
Those cats have got to go.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first, me first. Whoo.
Why should you be first?
Because I'm a lady, that's why.
Ha-ha. You're not a lady.
You're nothin' but a sister.
Oh!
I'll show you if I'm a lady or not.
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.
Fight fair, Marie.
Females never fight fair.
Ow! Now, that hurt.
Mama! Mama!
Marie, darling, Marie, you must stop that.
This, this is really not ladylike.
And Berlioz?
Such behaviour is most unbecoming to a lovely gentleman.
Well, she started it.
Ladies do not start fights, but they can finish them.
Berlioz.
Now, don't be rude.
We were just practising biting and clawing.
Aristocrats do not practise biting and clawing and things like that.
That's just horrible.
But someday we might meet a tough alley cat.
That will do.
It's time we concerned ourself with self-improvement.
You want to grow up to be lovely charming ladies and gentlemens.
Now, Toulouse, you go and start on with your painting.
Yes, Mama.
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint before we start our music lesson?
Please?
Well, yes, my love, but...
- Whoops.
- ...you must be very quiet.
Uh-Oh.
Mm-hm. Mm-mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
It's Edgar.
Yeah, old pickle-puss Edgar.
"Old pickle-puss"? Now, now.
Berlioz, that is not kind.
You know Edgar is so fond of all of us and takes very good care of us.

Oh. Good evening, my little ones.
Your favourite dish, prepared a very special way.
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.
Sleep well... I mean, eat well, of course.
Good evening, Duchess.
- Hello, kittens.
- Hello, Roquefort.
- Hi, Roquefort.
- Good evening, Monsieur Roquefort.
Mm. Something smells awfully good.
What is that appetising smell?
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.
Won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?
Well, yes. I mean...
I don't mean to interrupt.
But...
But it so happens that I have a cracker with me.
Come on, Roquefort, have some.
Oh, thank you. Don't mind if I do.
Just a few dunks.
Mm. Oooh. Very good.
My compliments to the chef.
Mm. This is yummy.
Mm.
Delicious.
Double delicious.
This calls for another cracker.
I'll be right back.
So that's... crème de la crème... a la...
Edgar.
Ahhh!
Lafayette. Hey, Lafayette.
Lafayette!
- Well, I'm right here.
- Listen.
Wheels approaching.
Oh, Napoleon, we done bit six tyres today.
Chased four motorcars and a bicycle and a scooter.
Hush your mouth.
It's a motorcycle.
Two-cylinder, chain drive, one squeaky wheel on the front, it sounds like.
You go for the tyres, and I'll go right for the seat of the problem.
How come you always grab the tender part for yourself?
'Cause I outrank you, that's why.
Now, stop beating your gums and sound the attack.
No, that's mess call.
Yeah, made a mess of it, huh?
You can be replaced, you know.
OK, let's charge. Oooh.
Wait a minute. I'm the leader.
I'm the one that says when we go.
Here we go.
Charge!
Whew.
Ahh! Oww!
Nice doggy, nice doggy.
Heel, roll over, play dead!
Yow!
This sure beats running, Napoleon.
Step on the gas, Napoleon.
I got 'er wide open.
Oww!
Oh!
Oh, where am I?
I'm not at home at all.
Children, where are you? Answer me.
Berlioz?
Toulouse, Marie, where are you?
Here I am, Mama.
Marie, darling. Well, are you all right?
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare and fell out of bed.
Now, Marie, darling, don't be frightened.
Mama! Mama!
That's Berlioz.
Over here, darling.
Berlioz, here we are.
And don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.
I'm coming, Mama.
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.
Mama?
Mama!
Darling.
That's only a little frog, my love.
He had a mouth like a hippo-lotamus.
Oh, what's so funny?
Not now, darling. Darlings, you just stay here.
I go and I look for Toulouse.
Toulouse?
Toulouse, where are you?
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
Toulouse!
Hey! What's all the yelling about, huh?
Why didn't you answer?
Mama, he's been here all the time.
Oh, thank goodness.
Are you all right?
I was having a funny dream.
Edgar was in it.
And we were all riding and bouncing along...
Frogs? Uh-oh. It wasn't a dream.
- Edgar did this to us.
- Edgar?
Oh, darling, why, that's...
Why, that's ridiculous.
Yeah, maybe you fell on your head, Toulouse.
Mama, I'm afraid. I wanna go home.
Now, my darling, don't be frightened. You'll see...
Oh, dear. Let's get into the basket, all of us.
What's gonna happen to us?
Well, darlings, I just don't know.
It does look hopeless, doesn't it?
I wish we were home with Madame right now.
Oh, poor Madame.
She will be so worried when she finds us gone.
Duchess? Kittens?
Oh, my gracious.
I had the most horrible dream about them.
Thank goodness it was only a dream.
Oh, dear, what a terrible night.
Now, now, my darlings.
Don't be frightened.
The storm will soon pass.
Oh, no! They're gone.
Duchess! Kittens!
Duchess! Where are you?
They're gone. They're gone!
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?
Why, that's terrible.
But where? Why?
Good heavens. Anything could happen to them on a night like this.
Get washed down a storm drain, struck by lightning...
Oh, they'll need help.
I've just got to find them.
Duchess! Kittens?
Duchess!
Kittens!
Kittens!

That's right. And I'm very proud of that.

Bravo.
Very good. You are a great talent.
Oh, thank you.
And what might your name be?
My name is Duchess.
Duchess.
Beautiful. Love it.
And those eyes.
Oooh.
Why, your eyes are like sapphires sparkling so bright.
They make the morning radiant and light.
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.
Very poetic.
But it is not quite Shakespeare.
Of course not. That's pure O'Malley, baby.
Right off the cuff.
I got a million of them.
Oh, no more, please.
I am really in a great deal of trouble.
Trouble?
Helping beautiful dames... uh, uh, damsels in distress is my specialty.
Now, what's the hang-up, your ladyship?
Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris.
So if you would be just so kind and show me the way...
Show you the way?
Perish the thought.
We shall fly to Paris on a magic carpet, side by side, with the stars as our guide.
Just we two.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Three?
Four?
Five?
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.
- These are my children.
- Oh, how sweet.
Do you really have a magic carpet?
- Are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.
Mama, do I have sparkling sapphire eyes
- that dazzle, too?
- Did I say that?
Yes, right off your cuff.
And you said we're gonna ride on your magic carpet.
Well, now, uh...
What I meant... You see, I...
No poetry to cover the situation, Monsieur O'Malley?
What I had in mind was kind of a sports model, baby.
- You know, one of those...
- Perhaps a magic carpet?
Built for two?
I wouldn't take up much room.
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.
Well, come along, darlings.
I'm a tough alley cat, too.
Hey, there.
You're coming on. I bet you're a real tiger in your neighbourhood.
Yeah. That's 'cause
I practise all the time.
Now, now, Toulouse.
Toulouse, come along, dear.
Yes, Mama.
See you around, tiger.
Now, that's quite a family.
Come to think of it, O'Malley, you're not a cat. You're a rat.
Right? Right.
- Hey, hey, hold up there.
- Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?
Now look, kids, if I said magic carpet, magic carpet it's gonna be.
And it's gonna stop for passengers... wright... here.
Oh, boy, we're gonna fly after all.
Another flight into the fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?
No, no, no, baby.
You just hide over there, and you leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley.
Quick, Mom, get in here.
- But, children...
- Hurry up, Mama, hurry.
One magic carpet, coming up.
That's a magic carpet?
Sacré bleu!
Sapristi! Stupid cat.
Brainless lunatic.
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you could have lost your life.
So I got a few to spare. Nothin'.
- How can we ever thank you?
- My pleasure entirely.
Aloha. Auf weidersehen.
Bonsoir. Sayonara.
And all those goodbye things, baby.
Sayonara, mister...
Mama!
Marie! Marie!
Oh, Marie, are you all right?
- Yes, Mama.
- Haven't we met before?
And I'm so very glad we did.
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley, for saving my life.
No trouble at all, little princess.
And when we get to Paris, I'll show you the time of your life.
Oh, I'm so sorry, but... we just couldn't.
You see, my mistress will be so worried about us.
Well, humans don't really worry too much about their pets.
Oh, no. You just don't understand.
She loves us very much.
Poor Madame, in that big mansion, all alone.
In all our days, in tender ways,
her love for us was shown.
And so you see, we can't leave her alone.
She'd always say that we're the greatest treasure she could own.
Because with us she never felt alone.
Oh, Roquefort, I've been so worried about you.
Did you have any luck at all?
Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou.
And I've searched all night.
I know. And poor Madame didn't sleep a wink, either.
Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.
Morning, Frou-Frou, my pretty steed.
Can you keep a secret, hmm?
Of course you can.
I have some news straight from the horse's mouth, if you'll pardon the expression, of course.
Look, Frou-Frou.
I've made the headlines.
"Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats."
Aren't you proud of me?
So he's the catnapper.
The police said it was a professional, masterful job.
The work of a genius.
Not bad, eh, Frou-Frou old girl?
Oh, they won't find a clue to implicate me.
Not one single clue.
Why, I'll eat my hat if they...
My hat!
My umbrella!
Oh, oh, gracious.
I've got to get those things back tonight.
But... oh, you...
Why, that... sneaky, crooked, no-good butler!
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?
- Where is it?
- Right under that magic carpet.
But now we have to cook up a little spell.
You know. Ready?
All right. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose.
And tickle your chin.
Now you close your eyes.
And cross your heart.
Then presto, breakfast à la carte.
Hooray!
- We did it.
- Look, Mama, look!
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you are amazing.
True.
True.
Sapristi!
Sacré bleu!
Thieves! Robbers!
Mangy tramps!
Take that and that!
Oh. Oh, what a horrible, horrible human.
Well, some humans are like that,
Duchess. I've learned to live with it.
I'll show him.
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.
- That guy's dynamite.
- But he called us tramps.
Oh, I'll be so glad when we get back home.
That's a long way off, so we better get moving.
Gee whiz.
Look at that bridge.
Come on, let's play train.
Now, be careful, children.
Marie's the caboose. All aboard!
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo.
Choc choo choo choo...
Clickedy, clickedy, clickedy, clickedy.
- Oh, no.
- Don't panic.
Down underneath here.
- Mama!
- Marie!
Oh, Marie!
Keep your head up,
Marie! Here I come!
Thomas! Thomas, up here.
Gee, Marie, why did you have to fall off the bridge?
Thomas! Oh, Thomas! Take care!
I'm all right, honey, don't worry.
I'll see you downstream.
What beautiful countryside, Abigail.
- So much like our own dear England.
- Indeed, yes.
Amelia, if I walk much farther I'll get flat feet.
Abigail, we were born with flat feet.
I say. Look over there.
Oh. Oh, how unusual.
Fancy that. A cat learning how to swim.
He's going about it all the wrong way.
Quite. We must correct him.
Sir. Sir?
You are most fortunate we happened along.
Yes. We're here to help you.
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doing fine.
First, you must gain self-confidence by striking out on your own.
Go away. I'm trying to get to shore.
You will never learn to swim properly with that willow branch in your mouth.
Indeed, not. Snip, snip.
Here we go.
Don't do that!
You're doing splendidly.
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.
Oh, he takes to water like a fish, doesn't he?
A very enthusiastic pupil!
No, no. This is no time for fun and games.
Gracious, Amelia.
- You don't suppose...
- Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
Bottoms up.
Deeper!
Look, Ma, there he is.
You really did quite well for a beginner.
Oh, Thomas. Thank goodness you're safe.
- Keep practising.
- And toodley-pip.
Can I help you, Mr. O'Malley, huh?
Help? I've had all the help I can take.
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so much for helping Mr. O'Malley.
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.
Yes, we British like to keep things proper.
Now, I am Amelia Gabble and this is my sister...
- Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.
You might say we're related.
How nice. I never would have guessed.
Look, they got rubber feet.
Yeah.
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.
- Swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.
Thomas, this is Amelia and Abigail Gabble.
Yeah, honey, get those two web-footed lifeguards out of here.
Now, now, Thomas.
OK, OK, baby.
Hiya, chicks.
How awful.
We're not chickens. We're geese.
Nooo. I thought you were swans.
Oh! Oh, flatterer.
Your husband is very charming and very handsome.
Well...
Uh, you see, I'm not exactly her husband.
Exactly? You either are or you're not.
All right. I'm not.
Oh?
Hm.
- It's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.
Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
- A roué.
- His eyes are too close together.
- Shifty, too.
- Look at his crooked smile.
His chin is very weak, too.
Obviously, a philanderer who trifles with unsuspecting women's hearts.
How romantic.
Please, please, let me explain.
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
- He's just helping us to get to...
- Come on, Duchess.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Well, girls, see you around.
- We're on our way to Paris.
- Oh, how nice.
- We're going to Paris ourselves.
- Why don't you join us?
I think that's a splendid idea.
Oh, no.
Now, uh, you stand here, dear.
And, uh, let's see.
You take this position.
- Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
- Very good.
And, you dear, you take this place.
Now, that leaves Mr. O'Malley.
We can't leave him, can we?
Mr. O'Malley, I think you should be the rear end.
Ready, everyone? Now, think goose.
Forward march.
Mama? Do we have to waddle like they do?
Yes, dear. Think goose.
When we get to Paris, you must meet Uncle Waldo.
Waldo?
Yes, he's our uncle.
We are to meet Uncle
Waldo at Le Petit Café.
Le Petit Café? Oh, that's that famous restaurant.
C'est magnifique.
Sacré bleu!
Oh, he bit my finger!
Get out. Go! Go, get out. Scram!
Good riddance!
Why! Why, it's Uncle Waldo.
Uncle Waldo!
Abigail! Amelia!
My two favourite nooses.
Uncle Waldo, I do believe you've been drinking.
Oh, dear. What happened to your lovely tail feathers?
Girls, it's outrageous.
Why, you won't believe what they tried to do to your poor old Uncle Waldo.
Look. Look at this.
"Prime country goose à la Provençale.
Stuffed with chestnuts"?
And "basted in... white wine".
Basted? He's been marinated in it.
Dreadful.
Being British, I would have preferred sherry.
Sherry! Sherry.
Oh! Oh, Uncle Waldo.
- You're just too much.
- You mean he's had too much.
- Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, dear?
We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.
I say, there... what's all the whispering about, huh?
- Shh!
- Oh! Whoo-hoo!
Now, now, now, girls.
Girls, don't shush your old Uncle Waldo.
Why, you'll wake up the whole neighbourhood.
- Sh. No!
- Neighbourhood!
Come along, Uncle Waldo.
Oh, jeez, I think we'd better be going.
Oh. Right-o, girls.
Birds of a feather must... together.
That's "stick together".
Oh, stick.
Shush.
You know something?
I like Uncle Waldo.
Especially when he's marinated.
Frou-Frou, here comes Edgar.
Hurry, Roquefort, hop aboard the motorcycle.
And for goodness sakes, do be careful.
Frou-Frou, tonight Operation
Catnapper will be completed.
Wish me luck. Fisherman's luck.
Bye, Frou-Frou. Oooh!
I... Whoa!
Lafayette. Lafayette.
Listen.
Oh, shucks, Napoleon, that ain't nothin' but a little old cricket bug.
It's squeaky shoes approaching.
Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes.
Hush your mouth.
Let's see.
They're Oxford shoes.
Size nine and a half.
Hole in the left sole, it sounds like.
- What colour are they?
- They're black...
Now, how would I know that?
Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped.
I still say it was a little old cricket bug.
I'm the leader.
I'll decide what it was.
It was a little old cricket bug.
I'll see ya in the morning, Napoleon.
That's my hat. I'm the leader.
Well, shoot fire.
Don't get sore at me.
I ain't done nothin'.
Ooh. Oh.
Ooh.
Mm, mm. That feels good, Lafayette.
That's all right.
Mm. Mm.
Mm-mmm.
Oooh.
A little lower and faster there.
I'm scratching as fast as I can.
Oooh. Right there. That's good.
Oooh.
It's so warm... and cosy.
- Oooh.
- Aaah!
Oooh.
What's going on? Lafayette, what in tarnation you trying to do?
Aw, I get blamed for everything.
Wait a minute. Where's my hat?
What? And somebody stole my bumbershoot.
Where's my beddy-bye basket?
Whoever it is, is gonna get it and get it good.
This time I get the tender part.
Hush your mouth. Now, come on.
Hey, Napoleon, it's them shoes again.
Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em.
Napoleon, I'm plumb goose-pimply scared.
Now, this is no time to turn chicken.
I got a feelin' this case is gonna bust wide open.
Whoo-hoo!
Did you see him?
No, no, he sneaked up behind me and tailgated me.
Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.
Shh. Listen.
Sounds like a one-wheel...
- A one-wheel what?
- You're not gonna believe this.
But it's a one-wheeled haystack.
Hey, there it go. Come on.
After it!
I got him, I got him, I got him!
Ow! That's me.
Whoa, whoa. Oh!
Get him, get him.
Ooh. Ow.
Well, c'est la guerre, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.
Ow. Oooh, oooh.
Criminently!
But, Thomas, Madame will be so worried.
Are you sure we can't get home tonight?
Mama, I'm tired.
Me, too, and my feet hurt.
Look, baby, it's late and the kids are bushed.
I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.
I'll bet it's more than a thousand.
Now, now, darlings, cheer up.
Mr. O'Malley knows a place where we can stay tonight.
How much farther is it, Mr. O'Malley?
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.
It's just beyond that next chimney pot.
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's peaceful and quiet.
Oh! Oh, no.
Sounds like Scat Cat and his gang have dropped by.
- Oh, friends of yours?
- Yeah, they're old buddies, and they're real swingers.
"Schwingers"?
What is a "schwinger"?
You know, not exactly your type, Duchess.
Maybe we'd better find another place, huh?
Oh, no, no, no. I would like to see your pad and meet your Scat Cat.
Well, OK.
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some of that sweet stuff my way.
Well, lookie here.
Big man O'Malley's back in his alley.
Swing on down here, daddy.
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.
Yeah.
Buona sera, paesano.
Welcome home, O'Malley.
Duchess, this is the greatest cat of them all.
Oh, I'm delighted to meet you, Monsieur Scat Cat.
Likewise, Duchess.
You're too much.
You are charming.
And your music is so...
So different, so exciting.
It isn't Beethoven, Mama, but it sure bounces.
Say, this kitten-cat knows where it's at.
Knows where what's at?
Why, little lady, let me elucidate here.

Happy dreams, my loves.
I'll bet they're on that magic carpet right now.
They could hardly keep their eyes open.
Such an exciting day.
It sure was, and what a finale.
Thomas, your friends are really delightful.
I just love them.
Well, they're kinda rough, you know, around the edges, but if you're ever in a jam, wham, they're right there.
And wham, when we needed you, you were right there.
That was just a lucky break for me, baby.
Oh, and thank you so much for offering us your home.
Oh. I mean, your pad.
It's very nice.
Well, now, wait a minute.
This is the low-rent district, remember?
No, no, no, I like it.
Well, all it needs is a little tidying up, and maybe a little feminine touch.
Well, if you're applying for the job, well...
Goody. Mother's going to work for Mr. O'Malley.
Boy. Your eyes are like sapphires.
Gee.
That's pretty corny though, huh?
Oh, no. Not at all.
Any woman would like it.
I-I mean... even little Marie.
Yeah.
All those little kittens, Duchess.
I love 'em.
And they are very fond of you.
- Yeah.
- Shh.
You know, they need...
Well, you know, a sort...
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.
Oh, Thomas, Thomas, that would be wonderful.
Darling, if only I could.
But why can't you?
Because of Madame.
I could never leave her.
But... But Madame's...
Well, she's just another human.
You're just her house pets.
Oh, no, no.
We mean far more to her than that.
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.
We just have to go home tomorrow.
Yeah.
Well, I guess you know best.
But I'm gonna miss you, baby.
And those kids...
Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.
Well, we almost had a father.
Yeah.
Let's go back to bed.
Good night, Duchess.
Good night, Thomas.
Hey.
Meow!
What a classy neighbourhood.
Dig these fancy wigwams.
Wigwams?
Are you sure we're on the right street?
Yes. Yes, let's hurry.
We're almost home.
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!
Oh, no. Edgar!
I've got to do something, quick.
Oh, ha.
Edgar, old chap, get used to the finer things in life.
Someday they're all going to be yours, you sly old fox.
Oh!
Oh, he got me.
Hooray! We're home.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first, me first!
- It's locked.
- Come on.
Let's all start meowing.
- It can't be them.
- The kittens.
Uh, why?
Don't come in!
Go away!
- Away!
- Look, there's Roquefort.
Hi, Roquefort!
He's glad to see us.
I don't know what to say.
I only wish that I...
Maybe just a short, sweet goodbye would be easiest.
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.
Bye.
So long, baby.
Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!
Duchess, wherever have you been?
Look out for the... sack.
Well... guess they won't need me any more.
You came back?
It just isn't fair.
Edgar? Edgar, come quickly.
Coming, Madame, coming.
I'll take care of you later.
Oh, Edgar, they're back.
I heard them. Hurry, hurry, let them in.
Duchess? Kittens?
Come here, my darlings.
Where are you?
- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
His name is O... what?
His name is O'Malley. O'Malley.
Abraham de Lacy, Giuseppe Casey...
Oh, never mind. Just run, move, go get him!
Yes, yes, I'm on my way.
I told you it was Edgar.
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.
I'm afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady.
But I was so sure that I heard them.
I'm so sorry, Madame.
Mr. O'Malley!
Hey, stop!
Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.
Butler did it.
Duchess and kittens in trouble?
Look, you go get Scat Cat and his gang of alley cats.
Alley cats?
But I'm a mouse.
Look, I'm gonna need help.
- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!
Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you, and you won't have a bit of trouble.
No trouble, he said.
Well, that's easy for... for what's-his-name to say.
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.
What's a little swinger like you doing on our side of town?
Oh, please, I was sent here for help by a cat.
This is outrageous. It's crazy.
But honest! He told me just to mention his name.
So start mentioning name, rodent.
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.
Don't rush me.
His name is O'Toole.
I don't dig him. Strike one.
Oh, oh... O'Brien.
Strike two.
Oh, boy.
You believe me... don't you?
Keep talkin', mousey.
How about O...
Grady?
Huh?
Mousey, you just struck out.
Any last words?
Why did I listen to that O'Malley cat?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- Hold it, cats.
This little guy's on the level.
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level.
We didn't mean to ruffle you, squeaky.
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.
Duchess and kittens are in trouble.
Come on, cats, we gotta split.
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!
Now, my little pesky pets, you're going to travel first class.
In your own private compartment.
All the way to Timbuktu.
And this time... you'll never come back.
Oh, no, we've got to hurry.
The baggage truck will be here any moment now.
Ooh!
Whoo-hoo. Oww!
Over there. They're in the trunk.
Quiet!
Everybody out of here, fast.
You are going to Timbuktu, if it's the last thing I do.
Well, Mac, this must be the trunk, eh?
Yup. And she goes all the way to Timbuktu.
Heave-ho.
Now, my pets, a little closer together.
Good. Good.
Look, Georges. What do you think?
Very good, very good.
But I think we should get on with the will.
Yes, yes, of course, but you know what to do.
Very well. Scratch one butler.
You know, Georges, if Edgar had only known about the will,
I'm sure he never would have left.
Duchess, it's wonderful to have you all back.
And I think this young man is very handsome.
Shall we keep him in the family?
Of course we will.
We need a man around the house.
And, Georges, we must be sure to provide for their future little ones.
Of course. The more the merrier.
Now, don't move.
Smile.
Say "cheese".
Did somebody say "cheese"?
Thank you.
Now, run along downstairs.
There's a surprise for you.
Adelaide, what's that music?
Sounds like a gang of swinging hepcats.
That's exactly what they are, Georges.
They're the start of my new foundation.
What foundation?
My home for all the alley cats of Paris.

Long ago...
... in the early years of the Second Age...
... the great Elven-smiths
forged Rings of Power.
Nine for mortal Men.
Seven for the Dwarf-lords.
Three for the tall Elf-kings.
But then, the Dark Lord learned
the craft of ring-making...
... and made the Master Ring.
The One Ring to rule them all.
With the One Ring, Middle-earth is his
and he cannot be overcome.
As the last alliance of Men and Elves
fell beneath his power...
... he did not notice the heroic shadow
who slipped in.
It was Prince Isildur...
... of the mighty kings from across the sea...
... who took the Ring.
But because he did not destroy it,
the spirit of the Dark Lord lived on...
... and began to take shape and grow again.
But the Ring had a will of its own,
and a way of slipping from one hand...
... to be found by another, so that it
might at last get back to its master.
And there the Ring lay,
at the bottom of the Great River Anduin...
... for thousands of years.
During those years...
... the Dark Lord captured the nine Rings
that were made for Men...
... and turned their owners
into the Ringwraiths:
Terrible shadows under his great shadow...
... who roamed the world,
searching for the One Ring.
In time, the Ring was found.
Two friends were fishing
in the Great River one day.
- Give us that, Déagol, my love.
- Why, Sméagol?
Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it.
I have already given you more than I could afford.
I found this, and I'm going to keep it!
Are you indeed, my love?
He used the Ring for thieving,
and to find out secrets.
His own people began to despise
the wretched creature...
... and to call him Gollum.
Tortured and driven by the Ring,
he hid in dark caves...
... under deep mountains.
But the Ring
slipped off Gollum's finger, too.
And so it was that Bilbo found it,
during his travels with the Dwarves.
Thief, Baggins. Thief!
It stole our precious, our precious...
Our birthday present.
Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!
It was Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit...
... who took the Ring back to the Shire,
his home.
Years later...
... Gandalf the Wizard, visited Bilbo
on his going-away birthday party.
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like...
...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
Frodo, I can see your uncle Bilbo hasn't changed much.
And though 111 years is far too short a time...
...to live among such admirable Bagginses and Boffinses, Grubbs...
...Chubbs, Brace-girdles, Goodbodies...
...Bolgers, Hornblowers and Proudfoots...
- Proudfeet!
...I regret to announce that this is the end.
I'm going away. I'm leaving. Now.
Goodbye.
Where did he go?
Oh, Gandalf.
Have you left the Ring for Frodo, as we agreed?
It's mine, I tell you! It's my own.
My precious!
It's mine now, and I shall keep it.
I won't give my precious away, I tell you.
Do not say that again!
Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.
All right, I will.
Seventeen years passed sleepily
in the Shire.
All right, just a minute!
Gandalf!
Greetings, Frodo.
Gandalf, it's really you!
Oh, it's been so long!
Seventeen years...
...since Bilbo left.
You look the same as ever, Frodo.
You look older, Gandalf.
Oh, I've been on a long journey.
It's the Ring, isn't it?
Bilbo's funny magic ring.
You always used to look like that when you talked about it.
Bilbo's "funny" ring, that makes you invisible?
- Give it to me, Frodo!
- Give you the Ring?
For a moment only.
Can you see any markings on it?
There are none.
It's quite a plain ring, really.
Well, then, look!
Wait. Do you desire it so much already?
No, but why ruin it?
Because it is altogether evil.
It will corrupt and destroy anyone who wears it...
...until he passes into the World of Shadows...
...under the power of Sauron:
The Dark Lord of Mordor!
Not Bilbo?
You are the one who has the Ring now.
- It's not even warm.
- No.
Not even a dragon's fire could harm that Ring.
"One Ring to rule them all
"One Ring to find them
"One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them"
I wish it need not have happened in my time.
So do I.
The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength of knowledge...
...to break all resistance, and cover all the lands in darkness.
He lacks the One Ring.
Maybe he doesn't know that it was found.
He knows, Frodo.
Gollum left his cave to follow the Ring himself...
...and the Dark Lord caught him in Mordor.
The Dark Lord knows what ring it was
Gollum found, and how he lost it again.
And he has heard of Hobbits at last, and of the Shire.
And he even has a name to think about...
...the name of Baggins.
Because of Gollum!
Oh, Gandalf, what am I to do?
What a pity that Bilbo didn't kill that vile creature when he had the chance!
Yes, it was pity.
Pity and mercy.
And now, Frodo, the decision lies with you.
What will you do with the One Ring?
I'll give it to you, Gandalf!
You're wise and powerful.
Well, will you not...
No! Do not tempt me.
I would wish to turn it to good, and it cannot be used so.
Meaning to be kind, I would become as terrible as the Dark Lord himself.
Do not tempt me!
I shall have such need of strength so soon.
Then I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it.
I ought to go away somewhere, alone.
But they won't bother the Shire if the Ring isn't here.
My dear Frodo...
...I am afraid you are right.
You'll have to go and leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is no longer safe.
Your new traveling name shall be:
Mr. Underhill.
What have you heard, and why did you listen?
Mr. Frodo, sir, don't let him hurt me, sir!
Don't let him turn me into anything unnatural.
Well?
Answer him, Sam.
Well, I heard a deal that I didn't rightly understand...
...about an enemy and rings, and about Elves, sir.
Why, I would dearly love to see Elves,
Mr. Frodo.
And so you shall, Sam.
So you shall. Indeed, you should go to the Elves first, to Rivendell.
Tell everyone you are moving away...
...to live in Buckleberry, with those cousins of yours, Pippin and Merry.
However you manage it, do it soon, by your birthday at the latest.
I should be back by then.
I must go south, to consult with the Wizard Saruman...
...the head of my order. Be careful, Frodo.
Me, go, sir? Me, go and see the Elves?
Oh, my! Hooray!
I have come for your aid,
Saruman the White, in troubled times.
The Nine are abroad.
Darkness approaches, the Black Riders!
Is that all the news you have for me then?
Is that not enough?
Sauron is moving at last!
We can deal with Sauron ourselves.
You and I, one way or another.
What talk is this?
What are you saying, Saruman?
It is time for us to choose.
A new age is upon us.
A new power is rising.
Nothing that Men or Elves or Wizards can do will avail against it.
Its enemies are utterly doomed, but its friends...
You are saying that we should join with Mordor?
With him?
Does that displease you?
Where is the Ring, Gandalf?
Why do the Black Riders search for it in the Shire?
Have you hidden it there?
Would you rather see the Dark Lord have it...
...or Saruman of many colors?
Neither of you will have it.
There is a third choice.
It is to remain here...
...until you tell me where the Ring may be found.
Saruman, if you do this...
...if you delay me here,
Sauron will surely get it then.
Then he will know his good servants...
...and his enemies.
Saruman!
Saruman!
I don't feel right going off without Gandalf,
Mr. Frodo.
I wish we could've waited, that I do.
So do I, Sam, but he said to leave as soon as we could.
And Merry and Pippin insisted on coming with us, as far as Bree, for the fun of it.
There's someone coming up ahead,
Mr. Frodo. I can hear a horse.
Good. I'm tired of looking at my cousins all day.
I think we should get off the road.
I don't want to be seen leaving the Shire.
But it might be Gandalf.
Then we'll surprise him. Hurry!
We're going with you, Frodo.
With me?
But how do you... Sam.
- But you gave your word.
- They already knew so much, Mr. Frodo.
Sam didn't tell us about the Ring, Frodo.
I saw Bilbo use it once, before he left, to hide from the Sackville-Bagginses.
And after that,
Pippin and I kept on the lookout...
...and we followed you.
We asked questions everywhere.
And we even wormed a few things out of Gandalf.
And you spied on me.
And Sam helped you.
And we spied on you.
But we meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo.
Don't you remember what Mr. Gandalf said?
"Take someone you can trust," he said.
- It doesn't seem that I can trust anyone.
- It all depends on what you want.
You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin, to the bitter end.
But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone...
...and go off without a word.
We're your friends, Frodo.
Bless you, you deceitful scoundrels.
Hooray!
Will we be stopping at Bree tonight,
Mr. Frodo?
I think so, Sam.
We all need a fireside and a bath, and a proper night's sleep in a real bed.
I do wish Gandalf were with us.
Maybe he'll be at the inn when we get there.
Maybe.
I think I'll go out for a sniff of air.
Mind yourselves. Don't forget:
You're supposed to be escaping in secret.
Oh, mind yourself! Don't get lost.
Be careful, Merry.
Quiet!
Quiet, all!
We have some visitors with us tonight, all the way from the Shire.
What was your name again, sir?
Mr. Underhill.
Mr. Underhill and his party.
Yes, Mr. Underhill, sing us a Shire song!
Well, a short one, then.
"There is an inn, a merry old inn
Beneath an old gray hill
"And there they brew a beer so brown
"With a fol-de-doo and a fol-de-da
"Hobbits all of the Shire are we"
Who's there?
Who's there?
"With a ping and a pang
The fiddle-strings broke
"The cow jumped over the Moon"
Where did he go?
What's going on here?
Take your magic tricks back to the Shire!
What's this place coming to,
I'd like to know?
Well, Mr. Underhill...
...frightening my customers and breaking my crocks with your acrobatics!
Very sorry, it's quite unintentional, a most unfortunate accident.
Well, you have put your foot in it this time.
Who are you?
I am called Strider.
- Everyone knows me here.
- Well, we don't!
You've been very careless so far,
Mr. Frodo Baggins.
My name is Mr. Underhill.
After your performance tonight, it won't matter what you're called.
The Black Riders will know who you are by morning.
They already know what you bear.
Who are you really?
I am Gandalf's friend.
He asked me to watch out for you.
Gandalf? Have you seen him?
Where is he?
I do not know.
We were supposed to meet him here, but I've had no word, no message.
It is the first time that I've ever feared for him.
Then we will have to go on by ourselves tomorrow.
To Rivendell?
You'd never get there. The Black Riders are watching the road night and day.
They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place, where there's no help.
I know the wild country.
I can take you to Rivendell by paths that are seldom trodden.
Will you have me?
With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no.
This Strider, he says be more careful,
I say, let's start with him.
How do we know he's from Gandalf?
More likely, he's a playacting spy, working for...
- For them.
- I don't know, Sam.
I think one of the Enemy's servants would, well...
...seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.
While I look foul and feel fair, is that it?
Well, no, I meant...
Frodo!
Frodo, I've seen them!
I've seen them, Frodo!
I've seen them! Black Riders!
My men found him lying in the street.
There were two of them.
They were hissing to each other.
I seemed to be drawn towards them.
Well, you do need looking after, all of you.
There's been strange folk about for days.
That Ranger...
...Strider coming and going and... Strider!
- They've come from Mordor.
- Save us!
They won't trouble you once I am gone.
Strider came to offer me his help.
You know your own business, maybe...
...but in your place, I wouldn't take up with a ranger out of the wild.
They have no choice.
There is no one else for them except a fat innkeeper...
...who only remembers his name because people shout it at him all day!
I'll do what I can to help, Mr. Baggins.
Mr. Underhill.
I'm no hero, but I'll do what I can.
Keep watch tonight, you and your folk.
There is a hill called Weathertop...
...about half way between here and Rivendell.
We will make for it tomorrow.
So will Gandalf, if he can.
I still don't know if we can trust him,
Mr. Frodo.
I said, you have no choice, Sam.
Because, if I wanted the Ring for myself...
...I could have it, now.
My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
If by life or death I can save you, I will.
How long will we be in these marshes, Aragorn?
At least two days.
I'm being eaten alive!
What do these things live on when they can't get Hobbits?
Easy there, Bill, easy, slow.
That is Weathertop.
We shall be there by nightfall, if we set a good pace and don't stop for lunch.
If this continues I'll become a wraith.
Don't speak of such things.
Aragorn! Aragorn!
And Beren was a mortal man...
...but Luthien Tinúviel was the daughter of a king of Elves...
...and she was the fairest maiden that has been among all the children of this world.
Yet she chose to be mortal, for him.
And when he died, she followed him.
And so he was her doom...
...but he was her love as well.
I thought I saw something!
Or maybe just shadows in the moonlight,
I don't know.
Just stand close to the fire. Make a circle.
What's that?
The Ring, Frodo! Take off the Ring!
Cold... It's so cold.
- Like a poisoned icicle.
- It is the cold of their world, Frodo.
When you put on the Ring, you entered the world of the Black Riders.
Gandalf said not to.
Why is it so misty here?
I can't see very well.
Well, what's the matter with him?
It was only a little wound.
It was an evil knife that struck him, Sam.
I think that a piece broke off in the wound and is working inward.
If it reaches his heart...
Can you do anything?
We must get to Rivendell very soon.
He can't go no further.
He must! Do you want them to take him?
Wait, listen.
Legolas!
Yes, Sam, that's an elf.
So, there has been no word of Gandalf in Rivendell? No message at all?
None.
My Lord Elrond has sent every rider he could spare to seek for you...
...knowing that you bore a great burden without guidance.
I have been on the road for nine days.
Well, Mr. Frodo has been on the road a lot longer than that.
And he's sick and he needs a rest.
Just for a while.
No resting can help your Mr. Frodo now.
Only the hands of Elrond in Rivendell can do that.
There are five Black Riders close behind us...
...and we may well find the other four waiting at the ford.
If we lose even a little time, we lose, Frodo, the Ring...
...and Middle-earth.
Do you understand me, Sam?
There is the ford of Rivendell.
Fly! The Enemy is upon us!
Come back. To Mordor we will take you.
Gandalf!
Come back, come back.
To Mordor we'll take you.
Come back, come back.
To Mordor, we'll take you.
Go back!
Run, you fool, run!
The Ring!
The Ring!
Go back to the land of Mordor, and follow me no more.
Come back. Come back.
To Mordor we will take you.
Come back. Come back.
Go back!
The Ring.
The Ring!
By all the Shire, you shall have neither the Ring nor me!
No, never. Verily, I come.
I give it unto you.
No, never! Gandalf!
Yes.
I am here, and you are lucky to be here, too...
...after all the absurd things you've done since you left home.
Where's Sam?
And are the others all right?
They've hardly left your side for three days.
Three days?
What happened at the ford?
It all seemed so dim, somehow.
You were beginning to fade, my remarkable friend.
The knifepoint had almost worked its way to your heart.
Oh, I didn't know. Would I have...
You would have become like them.
One of the Ringwraiths...
...the servants of the Dark Lord...
...if you had not resisted to the last.
The river, it rose up against them.
It is Elrond's river.
This is his house and it was Elrond himself who healed you.
If I may say so,
I added a few touches of my own.
The white horses and so on.
If you noticed.
Then that is the end of the Black Riders?
Not so long as the Ring itself exists.
They will fly back to their master in Mordor, empty and crippled...
...until they find new shapes to wear and new beasts to ride.
We have beaten them, just for a while, Frodo.
That's sort of a relief.
I wish that were the truth, Frodo.
I'm afraid we have a new and closer problem at hand.
You have not asked me why I was late getting back to the Shire.
I forgot.
When I was certain that yours was indeed the Master Ring...
... I rode at once to Isengard,
and I thought...
... that if anyone could know
what was best to do with the One Ring...
... it would surely be Saruman the White.
The great eagle, Gwaihir...
... came in answer to my call,
and bore me away.
Saruman has never paid enough
attention to animals.
- But if he should seize the Ring...
- He will become master of all Middle-earth.
The War of the Ring has begun, Frodo.
You will hear the rest in Council when you are well enough. Rest now.
"The leaves were long, the grass was green
"But the hemlock-umbels tall and fair
"And in the glade a light was seen
"Of stars in shadow, shimmering
"Tinúviel was dancing there"
Bilbo!
Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Where have you been?
Why haven't I seen you before?
I've seen a good deal of you, sitting by your side with Sam each day.
Bilbo, have you been here all the time?
All these years?
There didn't seem much reason to be anywhere else, after all.
The food's very good, and I listen, and I think.
A remarkable place altogether.
Yes.
And now, of course, there's all this bustle about that ring of mine.
Fancy the little thing causing such a disturbance. Have you got it here?
Yes, I have.
I'd very much like just to peep at it again, just for a moment.
Put it away.
I understand now.
I'm sorry.
Sorry about everything.
Don't adventures...
...ever have an end?
The Council of Elrond is beginning.
Come with me.
Both of you.
All that morning, the Council of Elrond
debated the history of the One Ring...
... and its master, Sauron.
Gandalf also told all present of Saruman...
... the traitor, and his desire
for the power of the Ring.
Elves and Dwarves, in their turn,
told what they knew of Sauron's...
... preparations for conquest,
and so did Boromir of Gondor.
In Gondor, we are already under attack by the forces of Mordor.
I am Boromir. In a dream...
...I heard a voice crying to me, saying:
"Seek for the sword that was broken."
Here is the sword of Elendil of Gondor...
...who fought the Dark Lord long ago and was slain.
So, Frodo learned at last...
... the true heritage of Aragorn,
the son of Arathorn...
... descendent of Isildur,
who cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand.
Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all?
Bring out the Ring, Frodo.
The time has come.
Isildur's Bane.
The Halfling.
What shall we do with it then, this mightiest of all weapons?
We cannot keep it, we cannot destroy it.
Sauron, who forged it looks for his Ring...
...and Saruman who envies it, searches for its power, too.
I see no other road for us but the most fearful:
The road into Mordor.
We must send the Ring to the fire where it was made:
To Mount Doom.
What foolishness is this?
Why do you speak of hiding and destroying?
The Ring could save all Middle-earth.
Have you heard nothing?
It is Sauron's Ring. To wield it...
...you would have to become Sauron.
I will not touch it!
Nor I.
Our one hope lies in foolishness, Boromir.
The Dark Lord cannot conceive of anyone wishing to destroy his Ring.
He will wait until one of us tries to use it...
...follow every move we make.
And it is just possible that he may not notice...
...the small, quiet feet, walking into peril...
...into Mordor.
Very well. It's plain enough what you're pointing at.
Bilbo, the silly Hobbit, started this affair, and had better finish it, or himself.
When ought I to start?
It has passed beyond you, Bilbo.
This last journey must be for others to make.
Who are they to be?
That is what they're trying to decide here.
I will take the Ring...
...though I do not know the way.
I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo.
This is the hour of the Shire-folk, at last.
But you won't send him off alone, surely?
You, at least, shall go with him,
Master Samwise.
It is impossible to separate you, even when he is summoned to a Council...
...and you are not.
A nice pickle we've landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo.
I thought perhaps you might care to have these.
Bilbo, I don't think I should look right.
You can wear the shirt under your clothes.
It's as light as anything.
But I fancy it might turn...
...even the knives of the Black Riders.
I named the sword Sting, long ago.
It's silly, but there you are.
It shines when there are enemies about.
Orcs and things.
There. Now you look just a plain Hobbit on the surface...
Well, take care.
Bring back any old songs and tales you hear.
"I sit beside the fire
"And think of all that I have seen"
Our only hope is in speed and secrecy.
The Company of the Ring shall be nine.
Nine walkers against
the nine Riders of Mordor.
With Sam and Frodo, Gandalf will go.
For the other Free Peoples...
... Legolas shall be for the Elves,
and Gimli, son of Glóin, for the Dwarves.
For Men shall go the valiant...
... Boromir of Gondor,
and Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
And for the last two places,
we will trust to friendship...
... rather than to great wisdom,
Peregrin Took...
... and Meriadoc Brandybuck may also go.
When did you ever know such a storm, so far south?
The Dark Lord's arm has grown long if he can hurl snow at us...
...all the way from Mordor.
His arm has grown long.
No, Gandalf, not that dark way, I beg you!
And what would you suggest?
Returning to Rivendell to wait there for the end? We have no choice, Aragorn!
We might go by way of the Gap of Rohan.
That'd take the Ring too close to Isengard and Saruman. We dare not risk it.
Yet you would risk the mines of Moria.
Where both you and I have walked before and come out again alive.
The memory is very evil.
I do not wish to enter Moria a second time.
And I don't wish to enter it even once.
Nor me.
The question is not who wishes to go, but who will?
There is no other way to pass the mountains.
I will go with you.
My cousin Balin led a company of Dwarves there, many years ago.
There has been no word of them in all that time.
Elves do not walk in the dark earth.
I will go, but I fear for you, Gandalf.
I will not go, not unless the vote of the whole company is against me.
What does the Ring-bearer say?
I do not wish to go.
But I will go, if Gandalf advises it.
Steady, easy, Bill. Old Gandalf will have that gate open in a minute.
- What if he can't?
- I've never seen anything he couldn't do.
Sam!
Fireworks are all very nice, but this is elf magic.
What a people you Dwarves are for hiding things.
On the gates of your most wondrous, ancient kingdom you write:
"Speak, friend, and enter," and no spell in any language can open the door.
Why do you keep looking at the lake, Frodo?
I'm afraid of it.
And there sits our quest.
If we had to bring a wizard at all...
...it should have been Saruman.
Be still, Boromir.
Why? There are other ways to turn, if our Wizard's balked.
I said, from the beginning...
Gandalf, you old fool!
So, all you had to do was say, "friend," and enter.
Those were happier times.
Let us go.
I'm coming, Mr. Frodo! I'm coming!
Into the gateway! All of you!
Poor old Bill!
Gandalf, what was the thing in the water?
I do not know.
There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.
Whatever it was, it grabbed Frodo first, out of all of us.
Be quiet, Pippin!
We have gone far enough for today.
Let us stop here for the night.
Seems to have been a guardroom.
Yes, there's even a well.
We had better rest here.
It's hard to believe that even Dwarves...
...could have lived in this half-drowned dungeon!
It was a great realm once.
Be still! Both of you!
Which way do we take tomorrow, Gandalf?
I have not decided.
The path to the left smells foul, and I am too weary to choose.
The way ahead feels wrong, somehow.
At least the middle way goes up.
It's time we began to climb again.
Perhaps. I cannot remember.
What's that?
- Pippin!
- Just a stone.
I dropped a stone.
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time! Be quiet!
Fool of a Pippin!
Yes, this way.
We should find our way down to the Great Gates by tonight.
I shall be glad.
I doubt now that Dwarves ever came back here.
Why should they have come back?
What was left for them to mine?
Mithril silver!
The most precious metal in the world.
"Balin, son of Fundin...
"...Lord of Moria."
They did come back.
It seems to be a record of the colony.
Orc swords. There was a great battle here.
Yes.
"Balin is now Lord of Moria."
Here it says, "We found Mithril."
Now it says:
"Yesterday, Balin, Lord of Moria, fell.
"An Orc shot him from behind a stone.
"We slew the Orc, but many more..."
Then it says, "We have barred the gates."
And something about,
"The Watcher in the Water."
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.
But I feel.
It is grim reading.
"They have taken the bridge.
They are coming!
"We cannot get out!
Drums, drums in the deep!"
There is nothing more.
Gandalf? I don't want to stay here.
We are going now, Pippin.
There is nothing more.
They are coming.
Slam the doors and wedge them.
Keep the east door ajar.
We must not get shut in.
Orcs and something else.
A great Cave-troll, I think.
Out this way!
The Shire!
For the Shire!
Now is the last chance! Run for it!
I'm all right. I can walk.
I thought you were dead.
All of you, down the stairs!
Lead the way, Gimli!
Pippin and Merry next.
Come no closer! I warn you!
Balrog!
Fly, all of you!
Fly, up the stairs and straight on.
Fly! You cannot help me.
You cannot pass.
I am a servant of the Secret Fire.
You cannot pass.
Go back to the shadow.
You cannot pass.
Fly, you fools!
Come. Follow me.
Obey him!
- There may be a bit of a scar, Sam.
- I don't care.
Now it is your turn, Frodo.
I'm all right. What does it matter now?
It matters. We still have a long road, and much to do.
Why? We've no hope without Gandalf.
You know that, Aragorn.
Then we must do without hope.
There is always vengeance.
Mithril shirt!
That's what saved you.
I have never seen one so beautiful.
- There!
- What is it?
The footsteps,
I heard them in Moria, following.
The Orcs will not come after us until dark.
It never sounds like an orc.
They're bare feet and they flap.
Whatever creature it is, it won't follow us where we're going.
Nothing evil passes through Lothlorien.
- That is not what we say in Gondor.
- Then you know nothing in Gondor.
Out of Moria into the Golden Wood.
Is there no way less perilous?
I would almost rather face the Balrog again, than the Lady.
Lothlorien is a place of healing.
There is no evil in it, unless a man...
...brings evil there with him.
- Welcome to Lothlorien.
I am Galadriel and this is my lord, Celeborn.
The forests have told us of your loss.
We sorrow for you, and for all of Middle-earth.
Rest here now for a little, until you are healed.
Your quest is known to us.
We will do what we can to aid you.
Frodo Baggins of the Shire?
"Let the night never cease to call you
"Let the day never more be the same"
It is a song about Gandalf, isn't it?
Yes, Mithrandir was the Elves' name for him.
It means, Grey Pilgrim.
We knew so little of him in the Shire,
Aragorn. He was just Gandalf, to us.
We never knew he had so many names.
I think he was fondest of Gandalf.
"We're still guided by your light
"You're walking beside us
"A prayer in the night
"With the fear rushing through the shadows
"Like a star shining deep in his heart
"You will know in your hearts forever
"Never more
"Will we stand
"Alone"
This is the mirror of Galadriel.
It shows things that were, and things that are...
...and things that yet may be.
Do you wish to look?
I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home.
It seems a terrible long time
I've been away.
Come then, you shall look...
...and see what you may.
I got to go home!
They've dug up Bagshot Row...
...and thrown my poor old Gaffer out in the street.
I've got to go home.
The mirror shows many things, Sam, and not all have yet come to pass.
Some never come to be, unless those that behold the visions...
...turn aside from their path to prevent them.
Do you wish to leave Frodo now, and go home?
No.
Gandalf?
No, it must be Saruman.
Do not touch the water.
He is looking for you.
But he cannot find you, not here, not yet.
The door is closed.
"Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky."
Yes.
We hid those three from him, and he has never touched them.
If your quest fails, then nothing can stand...
...against him and we are defenseless.
Yet, if you succeed, if the One Ring is destroyed...
...all we built with the three will fade.
Time will come here, and Lothlorien will fade.
You are the footstep of doom to us, Frodo.
Lady Galadriel, I will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it.
It's too great a matter for me.
And I came to test your heart.
You will give me the Great Ring freely...
...and in place of the Dark Lord you will set up a queen.
And I shall not be evil, but beautiful...
...and terrible as the morning and the night.
Stronger than the foundations of the earth.
All shall love me and despair!
I pass the test.
I will diminish and go into the west...
...and remain Galadriel.
And you must depart in the morning.
For Gondor and the House of Isildur.
For Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith.
In a few days, we will have to choose:
Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor...
...or turn east to Mordor and its Dark Lord?
Or shall we break our fellowship?
I'm going with Mr. Frodo.
I know that, Sam.
What a place. What a horrible place!
Behold the Argonath, the pillars of the kings.
They are Isildur and Anarion, my fathers of old.
If Gandalf were here...
The day has come at last, the day of choice, which we have long delayed.
What shall now become of our company?
I am not Gandalf.
I have tried to guide you as he would've done, but...
...if he had any plan for this moment, he never told me.
Even if he had, if he had lived...
...I think the burden would still have fallen on you, Frodo.
You alone can choose your way now.
The burden is heavy.
Give me an hour longer, and I will speak.
Let me be alone!
You shall have your hour.
And you shall be alone.
Who's there?
Boromir.
I was afraid for you, Frodo.
The Orcs may be on this side of the river by now.
May I stay and talk to you, just for a while?
You're kind, but there's nothing to be said.
I know what I should do, but I'm afraid of doing it, Boromir.
I wish I could help you.
Will you hear my counsel?
I know what your advice would be:
To go with you to Gondor and use the Ring to defend Minas Tirith.
And is that such ill counsel?
Why should we fear to use the Ring in a just cause?
Whatever is done with the Ring turns to evil.
Gandalf and Elrond refused to touch it, and Galadriel herself...
Yes, I know all that.
And for themselves, they may be right, these Elves and half-Elves and Wizards!
But truehearted Men will not be corrupted.
We, of Minas Tirith, do not seek power.
Only the strength to defend ourselves.
Where is the evil in that, Frodo?
You cannot answer me, none of them can.
It's folly not using the Enemy's power against him.
Think what Aragorn could do with the Ring in this hour.
Or if he refuses, why not Boromir?
How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, until I stood face to face with Sauron.
And they tell us to throw it away!
Come with me, Frodo.
My city is not far.
You can go to Mordor from there, if you must.
Only, trust me, let me try my plan.
Lend me the Ring.
No, Boromir. No!
Fool, obstinate fool!
It is only yours by chance.
It might have been mine.
It should be mine. Give it to me!
Miserable trickster!
You'll sell us all to Sauron.
Traitor!
Curse you to death and darkness, all you Halflings!
What have I done?
Frodo, come back!
A madness took me, but it has passed.
Come back!
This waiting's horrible.
Where have you been, Boromir?
Have you seen Frodo?
I tried to convince him to come to Minas Tirith.
I grew angry and he vanished.
Is that all you have to say?
He put the Ring on.
But where did he go? Where is he?
Mr. Frodo!
Gimli, Legolas, stop them!
I don't know what part you've played in this mischief, but help now!
Go after Merry and Pippin and guard them, even if you cannot find Frodo. Go on!
Follow me, Sam. Stay close.
Sam Gamgee, your legs are too short, so use your head.
The boats.
Coming, Mr. Frodo.
Coming!
It's only water, now.
I'm here, Sam.
Save me, Mr. Frodo.
Help, I'm drowning!
- Take my hand.
- Where's your hand?
Here. Here it is.
Of all the confounded nuisances
I ever knew.
Mr. Frodo, that's hard.
If I hadn't guessed right, where would you be now?
Safely on my way.
"Safely"?
All alone and without me to help you?
But I am going to Mordor.
Well, of course you are,
Mr. Frodo, and I'm coming with you.
It's no good trying to escape you.
I'm glad, Sam.
May the others find a safe road.
Aragorn will look after them.
I don't suppose we shall see them again.
Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may.
- This way!
- Frodo!
Halfling.
Boromir.
Boromir.
I tried to take the Ring from Frodo.
I'm sorry. I have paid.
Aragorn, go to Minas Tirith.
Save my people.
Aragorn...
I will go...
...I promise you.
The Halflings, Orcs took them.
I think they are not dead.
Either we take the last boat and follow
Frodo, or we follow the Orcs on foot.
Pippin and Merry may be dead by now.
We don't know.
We cannot forsake them.
The fate of the Ring-bearer is in my hands no longer.
The Company of the Ring has played its part. We follow the Orcs.
Filth!
Maggots!
Can't run.
Hello, Pippin.
So you've come on this expedition, too?
When do we get bed and breakfast?
Bed and breakfast in Isengard, understand?
They are alive.
One of them, anyway.
Pippin, I think, by the footprints.
How far ahead of us are they, Aragorn?
Almost a day. Shall we rest by night, or go on while our strength holds?
Do you think the Orcs will rest?
Yet, in the dark we may lose the trail, or miss a sign, like that brooch.
There will be no more signs.
I cannot run all the way to Isengard.
Thank goodness for that rope the Elves gave you.
We'd never have gotten down that last cliff without it.
There's Mount Doom again, Mr. Frodo.
See it?
What a fix!
The one place that we don't want to see any closer...
...and that's the one place we're trying to get to.
We're plain lost, Mr. Frodo.
I'm tired, Sam.
I don't know what's to be done.
We must find a place to camp, I suppose.
Maybe there'll be a path tomorrow.
Cautious, my precious.
Don't turn!
It's him.
That Gollum?
That thing who had Mr. Bilbo's ring?
He's been following us since Moria.
My precious! More haste, less speed.
Well, he'll be sorry he found us again.
Be careful!
He's much more dangerous than he looks.
Where is it, my precious?
It's ours, it is, and we wants it.
Got you, you spying...
Let go, Gollum!
Let go, or I'll cut your throat!
Don't hurt us!
Don't let them hurt us, precious.
Cruel little Hobbitses.
Jumps on us like cats on poor mices, Gollum.
We'll be nice to them if they'll be nice to us, won't we, precious?
Pity Mr. Bilbo didn't kill the creature when he had the chance.
I will not touch him.
Now that I see him, I do pity him.
Yes, Hobbits won't kill us, not Hobbits, huh?
No, we won't.
But we won't let you go, either.
You will have to come with us and help us, if you can.
Yes, indeed!
Nice Hobbits!
And where are they going in these cold, hard lands, we wonder?
We are going to Mordor. You know that.
Lead us to the gates of his land.
No, precious.
Hobbits mustn't go there.
Gollum! Leave us alone!
Gotcha!
I think your rope might prove useful again.
Tie one end to his ankle.
We want him to walk.
Don't hurt us! No!
It burns! It bites!
It freezes!
Take it off us. It hurts us.
Don't you do it!
It hurts us.
What promise can you give me that I can trust?
Sméagol will be very good.
Sméagol will swear never to let him have it.
Sméagol will save it.
The precious is before you, Sméagol.
Speak your promise!
We promises, yes, I promise...
...I will serve the master of the precious.
- Good master.
- Good Sméagol.
Take the rope off, Sam.
Off we go. Follow Sméagol.
Sméagol knows a secret way, he does, across the marshes.
Follow Sméagol.
I said, "No shooting."
You're wasting arrows, dunghill swine!
Snaga, Lugdush, stand guard.
Bind their legs.
White-skins break through. Understand?
You and your stinking Wizard.
You got us into this.
When I tell them in Mordor...
They are far, far away.
If stinking Wizard doesn't get you, the white-skins will.
You won't get it that way.
It isn't easy to find.
Get it? Get what?
Nothing, my precious.
It's no good groping in the dark.
Ugluk will be back any minute.
Nothing for Mordor.
Nothing for poor Grishnakh and Gollum.
- Untie us, my precious.
- I said to be quiet!
Wait. You can't find it without our help.
You help me.
I don't know what to do now.
I don't even know where we are.
You should have studied maps more and played less in Rivendell.
This is Fangorn Forest.
Then we're no safer than we were with the Orcs.
We've no blankets and almost no food.
It looks like nothing to eat for 100 miles.
We don't even know where we're trying to go.
Let's climb up there.
Maybe we can find out where we are, at least.
It's nice here.
The forest looks so different in the sunlight.
I know.
It's funny, but, well,
I almost feel I like the place.
Almost felt you liked the forest?
That's uncommonly kind of you.
The Orcs made us run here, and when we tired...
...they carried us, cut our ropes and ran into the forest and we came to your hill...
"Hill?"
A hasty word...
...for something that has stood here since the world was shaped.
You may call me Treebeard.
We thought you were a tree, standing there.
Not a tree, a tree herder.
Please, Treebeard...
...now that you know our story...
...whose side are you on?
I am not altogether on anybody's side...
...because nobody is altogether on my side.
But I am no friend of these...
...tree-killing Orcs and their masters.
They were here, no doubt of it.
- But where they went...
- I don't understand these other marks.
Look!
Your bow, Legolas! It's Saruman.
- Shoot before he puts a spell on us, fast!
- Elf...
...Man and Dwarf together?
A rare sight in these times.
Stop him, Legolas!
Gandalf?
Beyond all hope.
Gandalf!
Yes.
That was my name.
But where have you... Gandalf!
What happened?
A long time I fell.
Long I fell and he fell with me.
His fire was about me.
I was burned.
Ever he clutched me, and ever
I hewed him, far under the living earth...
... until at last, he fled back up
the secret ways of Moria.
There we fought,
above the mists of the world...
... and the mountain was wreathed
with lightning.
I threw down my enemy
and his fall broke the mountainside.
Then darkness took me...
... and I wandered far,
on roads that I will not tell.
Naked, I was sent back for a brief time...
...until my task was done.
And it is time I was about it.
You come with me to Edoras, my friends, to the city of the Riders?
To Edoras, now?
But to leave Merry and Pippin?
They are in no danger, believe me.
The great danger is to Edoras.
Saruman's Orcs will attack there within
two days, and Theoden has need of us.
Theoden has grown old.
He shivers by his fire now...
... and leaves everything in the hands
of his new minister:
Grima Wormtongue.
Those Riders you followed,
who rescued Merry and Pippin...
... they were led by Theoden's nephew,
Eomer.
He is all but an outlaw
in Rohan these days.
He hunts the Orcs
wherever he finds them...
... defying Wormtongue's orders
to let them pass.
So Wormtongue calls him traitor
and renegade...
... and Theoden believes...
Gandalf, the Riders of Rohan
are the bravest fighters...
... but they were never many.
If Saruman strikes now,
he'll overrun Edoras in a single night.
Our time is at hand.
Theoden's hundreds will face your tens of thousands.
When all of Rohan, your ancient oppressor, lies vanquished...
...then shall we fly eastward...
...and sweep all of Middle-earth beneath our feet.
We cannot be defeated!
Halfway between Edoras and Isengard,
there lies a fortress called Helm's Deep.
If we can decoy Saruman's Orcs there...
... the fortress will stop them longer
than the wooden halls of Edoras.
We are buying time, Aragorn.
Time? Time for what?
Perhaps for a miracle.
Perhaps only for Frodo to get a little further on his way...
...while the armies that should be hunting for the Ring...
...waste their own time destroying us.
I have returned.
The storm comes swiftly, and it is time for all friends to gather together.
And...
...do you...
...expect me...
...to welcome you here...
...Master Gandalf?
Troubles follow you like crows.
Why should I welcome you,
Gandalf Stormcrow?
Justly spoken, Lord.
In the east, the Dark Lord is stirring...
...in Lorien, the Sorceress of the Golden Wood weaves deceit.
And such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return.
It is I...
...who counsel the King now.
He hears you no longer.
No, Grima Wormtongue.
He hears nothing but your voice telling him that he rules here...
...only because Saruman is kind to old men...
...and that the best thing for a sickly, feeble king...
...is to let Wizards and Orcs do as they will in Rohan.
I am my own man, Gandalf...
...as I was.
It is true that...
...Grima advises me often to leave
Saruman in peace...
Hear, my Lord, you tire yourself.
You are still unwell.
And he does remind me that it would be safest for Rohan...
...to seek their friendship...
...no matter how I may feel!
Dear Lord, let me deal with these troublesome guests.
How long has it been, Grima Wormtongue?
How long since Saruman bought you?
For I saw you at Isengard.
Did I not counsel your doorkeeper to forbid his staff?
Down, snake.
Down on your belly.
Grima is often...
...at Isengard.
I sent him there with messages.
And he returns with poison...
...Saruman's poison in your ears, Theoden.
Chilling your heart, making you old.
Take courage, Lord of Rohan!
Grima...
...is this so?
I will not harm you, Grima.
Is it so?
Let him go!
My sister-daughter, Eowyn.
My only loyal kin...
...since her brother has disobeyed my commands.
Wormtongue's command, Theoden.
If Eomer had not defied him...
...their cause might be already lost.
- Tell me, Gandalf...
...what I must do now.
We cannot wait here for Saruman's attack.
Every man that can ride must be sent immediately...
...to the old fortress of Helm's Deep.
When Saruman learns that we have gone there, and he will...
...we will have the Riders of Rohan.
I will find Eomer and his Riders.
My armor!
Look for me at Helm's Deep.
That's all, Theoden.
And he's gone again...
...like a wind in the grass.
Stormcrow.
- Aragorn?
- My Lord?
Is there any hope for us?
Sam, you simpleminded...
You fell asleep.
Mr. Frodo, he's gone.
- Sméagol?
- He's gone. I didn't mean to sleep.
Well, he'll come back.
Promise will hold him a while yet.
He won't leave his precious, anyway.
Are we rested?
Ready to go on?
Nice Hobbitses.
Trust Sméagol now?
Stop!
Shivery light.
Nasty.
Look!
Wraiths.
Wraiths on wings!
The precious is calling them!
Gollum, wait, Mr. Frodo can't keep up!
Slow down, I tell you.
No time, no time.
The precious is heavy, yes.
Very heavy, Sméagol knows.
If it's too heavy for nice Master...
...little Sméagol will carry it.
Sméagol doesn't mind.
Give it to Sméagol.
Do not say that again.
Do not think it.
Before you touched the precious again,
Sméagol...
...I would put it on and have you leap off a cliff, or into a fire...
...and you would do it, Sméagol.
Nice, Master.
Nice, Master.
Gollum!
Sméagol promised.
Yes, we promised to save our precious...
...never to let him have it, but it's...
...going to him, my precious is nearer every step.
I can't help it.
Sméagol promised to help nice Hobbit.
He took cruel rope off our leg.
He speaks nicely to me.
He's a Baggins, my precious.
A Baggins stoled it.
We hates Bagginses.
Must have the precious. Must have it.
We wants it.
But there's two of them.
Yes.
We needs help, precious.
She might help, yes.
She might help us...
...but Sméagol promised nice Hobbit.
Nice Hobbit.
Hey, you...
...what are you pawing at him for?
Where've you been anyway, sneaking off and sneaking back?
"Sneaking"?
Hobbit's always so polite, yes.
Tired, thirsty Sméagol, he finds a secret way through the mountain...
...a tunnel with no Orcses anywhere, and they say "sneak."
"Sneak"?
Well, you startled me. I'm sorry.
Hello, Sméagol.
- Where have you been?
- Sneaking!
I like this place.
There is good rock here.
This country has tough bones.
Up on the ridge! They're coming!
There they are!
Fire of Isengard!
We're breached. Retreat to the caves.
The caves!
Theoden King.
I will not end here...
...taken like an old badger in a trap.
When dawn comes...
...I will bid men sound Helm's horn...
...and I will ride forth.
Will you ride with me then, son of Arathorn?
At least, we may make such an end...
...as will be worth a song.
I will ride with you.
We're there, Sam.
Another day, maybe two.
When light comes tomorrow, the mountains will be near.
Well, it's a good thing, Mr. Frodo, because we're running awful low on food.
I reckon we've got enough left to see us to this Mount Doom.
After that...
...I don't know.
Samwise Gamgee.
My dearest Hobbit, friend of friends...
..."after that," if the Ring goes into the fire, and we are at hand?
"After that," dear Sam.
I wouldn't worry.
Just to get there.
Just to get there.
The Ring is so heavy now, Sam.
We must go.
Mustn't rest here, silly Hobbits.
Orcs find us. Ringwraiths find us.
Must go on to safe, secret place.
Sméagol's secret way!
The straight stair...
...and the winding stair. Up, up...
...through black, sharp mountains.
Follow good Sméagol.
Straight stair, winding stair...
...what comes after that?
We shall see, yes...
...we shall see.
Gandalf!
The forces of darkness were driven
forever from the face of Middle-earth...
... by the valiant friends of Frodo.
As their gallant battle ended...
... so too ends the first great tale of...
...The Lord of the Rings.
Stop!
Catch them! Don't let them get away!
THANKS SO MUCH
We got five billion in various denominations.
It's a shower of bills. Look out!
There's a lot, isn't there?
More! Bury me with them.
- What's wrong, Lupin?
- Dump them.
What?
These are fakes. Good ones, but fakes.
These? It can't be. We stole these from the vault of the national casino.
It's Goat Money.
Goat Money?
You mean the phantom counterfeit?
It's even hit the national casino.
Jigen, I've decided what our next job will be.
First, we're gonna celebrate.
Damn, damn, damn you!
THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO
It's not a name you hear a lot, the Duchy of Cagliostro.
3,500 inhabitants. It's the smallest member state of the UN.
And that's where the Goat Money comes from?
It's legendary.
The black hole of forged banknotes.
A black hole?
Nobody who's gone there to investigate has ever returned.
How scary.
It's so scary I'll take a nap.
- Hey!
- What?
The spare tyre's worn out.
It's so peaceful.
- What's going on?
- Let's go!
- Who shall we follow?
- The girl!
Of course.
- Hit the tyre.
- Right!
Damn, that's no ordinary car.
Now things have gotten interesting.
Here we go.
We've caught up to them.
This is no ordinary bullet, mates!
I got 'em!
She's blacked out!
- Her car's breaking up!
- Take the wheel!
- No! Let go of me!
- No, stop that! We're in danger!
Look down! Down! Down! Down!
There now. That's better.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Forgive me.
Hey, Lupin. What a sight you are.
Where's my bride?
Damn!
Why the hell are those thugs going after some young girl?
It's a ring.
My God, I've seen this somewhere before.
What's going on? You got all excited when you saw that ring!
Lupin!
Hey, Lupin, what's in this old castle?
It's the same crest as the ring, Lupin.
It hasn't been deserted very long.
- A fire?
- Who's there?
- Just some guys passing through.
- Sightseers?
Yeah. I thought that perhaps this was the palace of His Highness the Archduke?
It still is. This is no place for strangers to hang around.
You mean to say that this is the Archduke's palace? It's a skeleton.
That's because of the great fire of seven years ago.
Ever since the Archduke and Duchess died the castle has been left to ruin, just as you see it.
That's strange.
The Archduke is the ruler. Does that mean that there is no ruler now?
I shouldn't worry about it if I were you, as there is a regent.
Now go away.
Okay, okay.
Hey, Lupin.
She's grown up.
What is it?
Don't play innocent with me.
Don't suffer in silence. Talk!
You're choking me.
- Well? Are you gonna talk?
- All right, all right, I'll talk.
That's the castle of the regent,
Count Cagliostro.
Look over there.
No, lower down.
Beyond the aqueduct bridge.
That boat! The bride's in that castle?
There's a ﬂoodgate at that spot, same as before.
Did you slip into that castle?
It happened more than ten years ago.
I tried to solve the mystery of the
Goat Money. I was still a young punk.
So what happened?
They gave me hell. I ran away with my tail between my legs.
That autogyro's an antique.
That'll be the Count.
Come on, let's find an inn.
That was careless, Jodo.
I'm sorry.
The men were outside while she was being fitted for her wedding dress.
Is she in the North Tower now?
Yes. She is sleeping peacefully thanks to a sedative.
Foreigners?
Yes. It seems that two men lent a hand in her escape.
Find them.
I leave it to you to take care of them.
The ring's gone?
Summon Jodo!
These characters are in the long-extinct Goat Alphabet.
The Goat Alphabet?
"Light and Shadow will not recombine and revive, 1517."
The date is in Roman numerals.
A 400-year-old affair?
- Here you are, gentlemen.
- Looks delicious.
What are you looking at?
Why, I picked up an old ring.
I wonder if it's valuable.
Oh, that's pretty.
That's Lady Clarisse's crest.
Clarisse?
Look. That photo over there.
That's her when she was a little girl.
She was brought back from the convent yesterday.
- I'm sure she's a lovely young woman.
- Convent?
Don't you know?
I thought you gentlemen had also come to see the wedding of Lady Clarisse and the Count.
That's why there are so many tourists.
But poor Lady Clarisse.
The Count is a notorious womaniser.
You mean like me!
What are you doing tonight?
No! Disgusting!
So he's a spy for the Count after all.
He got excited when he saw the ring.
So it's not just the bride.
He's after the ring, too.
I won't let him have it.
You knew that girl we met today was the daughter of the Archduke, didn't you?
You mean I didn't tell you?
"Light and Shadow will not recombine and revive."
Could it mean that a treasure will arise instead, perhaps?
An armed escort!
My magnum has no effect.
These guys are professional assassins.
Hurry.
- I tell you, they scared me.
- They attacked in full force.
There's more to this than meets the eye.
Things are getting interesting.
These are no good.
The quality just gets worse, doesn't it?
I'm sorry, but continuing the present mass production programme will have that result.
Start over! We cannot move back the date of delivery.
- Yes, sir.
- Who's there?
The failure is mine.
I let the rats escape.
Jodo, what's that piece of paper on your back?
What? I never noticed it.
Lupin...
It's an advance-warning card from Lupin.
Read it.
Yes, sir, but...
It's all right.
"To the Count of lust and greed,
"give me your bride.
I'll call on you soon. Lupin III."
Excellent, Jodo.
Why don't we wait for Lupin to come to us?
Well! You got here quick.
Is there a job?
Goemon's arrived.
He's not the only one. Take a look.
That's a Japanese patrol car.
- That'll be Zenigata.
- What?
Fall in!
And with that, the stars are all in place.
Excuse me for interrupting your meal.
I'm Inspector Zenigata of ICPO.
I was notified that you had received
Lupin's advance-warning card and came out here.
Are you referring to the scandalous Arsene Lupin III?
For that, Interpol disturbs a man's breakfast, do they?
Your Excellency, do not underestimate Lupin.
If he says he's going to come,
I guarantee you he'll show up.
Your wedding is still five days away.
Please allow us to guard your castle.
In this country, we have a police force, too.
Only we refer to them more elegantly as "royal guards".
You rang, sir?
Gustav, cooperate with the Japanese.
You may go.
- Yes, sir.
- One more thing, Your Excellency.
Please tell me why that damned Lupin is after your bride.
Well, investigating that is your job, too, isn't it?
Excuse me.
Is it a good idea letting someone like that into the castle?
It's all right, don't worry about it.
I have plenty of friends in Interpol, too. He'll soon leave.
That's Zenigata.
Truly the ideal of the Showa Period.
A man incomparable for his determination to his work.
What's that over there?
Don't go beyond this point.
What?
Watch.
Don't loiter around if you don't want to die. Inform your men as well.
Inspector, they have anti-personnel radar.
This castle gives me the creeps.
The defences are far too large for dealing with ordinary crooks.
A woman?
Hold it. Don't talk about backing out.
There is a woman, but that's not all there is to it.
There's something about this ring you mentioned?
We'll find that out if we get the girl back from the Count, the horny old goat.
In any case, my magnum was ineffective.
Your sword and this anti-tank rifle, though...
Hey, Lupin, did you find a way in?
No, it's amazing.
It's a nest of lasers and radars.
I see. We'll need tanks, eh?
- So you sent for Zenigata, didn't you?
- What? Is that true, Lupin?
Exactly. You catch on fast.
Treat poison with poison.
This is Cagliostro Castle. We're here.
This Roman aqueduct is still in use.
It's the only way in.
Water ﬂows from this lake into the castle via the aqueduct.
I get it, there won't be any lasers underwater.
Goemon, keep an eye out.
Watch your step. There's a hole.
The first lock.
Here we go.
Lupin!
That's the clock tower.
I wonder if he made it okay, the bum.
What's that Windmill?
According to Gustav, it brings water up into the castle.
- Where's the outlet for that water?
- The fountain in the upper turret.
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.
Inspector! Orders from
Paris Headquarters to pull out.
They say, "Return at once."
What? That's ridiculous.
I'm gonna verify it.
What? My reason for coming here was Lupin's advance-warning...
The Count did?
Police officers are not in the business of catering to individual whims.
Hello? Hello?
Damn.
I'll take this to the Count.
Take me to your Count.
I want to see the Count immediately.
Didn't you hear me? Let me in.
Desist.
Only those who are trustworthy can pass beyond this point.
What?
Are you saying you can't trust Interpol?
You are supposed to have received orders to leave here. Do so.
How... How do you know that?
We don't use Orientals for the likes of Lupin. Go away.
I see. All right. We'll leave for now.
- Was I here just now?
- What?
You idiot! That was Lupin!
He snuck in here disguised as me.
Can't you see through a disguise, you big lummox? Cretin!
After them!
Don't let Lupin escape.
Lupin!
Cut it out, it's Lupin.
Help the Inspector! Charge!
Man, oh, man!
Stop it! It's Lupin!
Lupin!
Someone seems to have been caught.
The fool.
He should have left right away.
The guards are missing. Gustav!
What is he doing, leaving his post?
- You stay here.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry about that, old man.
You moron!
Stop this imbecilic fight at once!
Don't you understand? Lupin successfully tricked you into letting him in.
Damn it!
Let go!
So Lupin got in after all.
I am ashamed.
Inform the police that the Inspector already left.
If he vanishes en route, that's the way it goes.
Yes, sir.
Don't move.
- Good evening, Fujiko.
- Lupin!
A woman hard at work is beautiful, isn%she?
You came all this way for that?
I've looked all over for you, because it's hard not seeing you for a whole year, you know?
Lupin, you're hunting down the bride's whereabouts, am I correct?
Hey! You know where she is?
If I tell you, will you keep out of my business?
Yes, yes. I won't interfere.
I just bet...
She's at the top of the North Tower.
But it's very difficult to get in, you know.
Lupin?
That's a cruel cage they've shut you up in indeed.
Who's there?
A thief.
A thief?
Good evening, Miss Bride.
You! You're that man from before, aren't you?
You left this behind.
You risked being caught and killed by the Count for this?
Why, it's the way of thieves to risk their lives.
If the job is finished, I'll leave.
The job?
I wish I had something to give you but, for now, I'm a prisoner.
Take this!
My prize is a treasure, locked away atop a high tower by an evil magician.
Please allow this humble thief to steal it.
You mean me?
I will reclaim the treasure locked away in the vault, and I will release it into a green field, the girl they are attempting to force into becoming a bride.
It's all in a thief s work.
You mean you'll set me free?
Thank you. I'm very happy.
But you don't understand how terrible the House of Cagliostro is.
Please go away.
Oh, what a terrible thing.
The girl believes in the power of the evil magician, but she wouldn't try to believe in the power of the thief.
If she would only believe, the thief would be able to fly through the air and even drain a lake of its water.
This is all I can do for now.
Mr Thief!
Hey! Treat the lady more respectfully.
Thank you for going to the trouble of delivering the ring, Lupin.
I'm overwhelmed by your warm reception, Count.
It's high time you were eliminated.
Do you think you can do away with me as easily as that?
No! Stop! Don't hurt him!
It's all right. You've got to believe in the thief s power, my dear.
Lupin!
Yes, I'm right here, and I'll be right back.
So, what's the name of the game?
It would be easy enough to rend you to pieces, but I don't want to stain this room with the blood of a sneak thief, after all.
You'll eat those words after this.
Your last words amount to a useless retort.
That hole leads to hell. No single person can worm their way out of it.
You've already charmed a man with your looks.
It's the Cagliostro blood, undeniably.
You're worthy of becoming my wife.
Murderer! You're inhuman!
Why, yes.
My hands are stained in blood.
But then, so are yours.
My Count's House has propped up this country for generations, handling conspiracy and assassination, as the Shadow of your Archduke's House.
Let go of me! You're repulsive!
Don't tell me you don't know all that.
You are a Cagliostro, too.
The ancient Goat blood ﬂows through your veins, just like mine.
Clarisse, the two houses of Cagliostro, which have been separated into Light and Shadow for over 400 years, will now become one.
Look...
When I bring together the gold goat that symbolises my house with your silver ring, the hidden ancestral treasure will revive.
I heard that! I heard that!
This is a wedding for treasure!
It's him!
Everything this counterfeit Count says and does is a lie!
The girl is a very gentle and wonderful child.
- Lupin! Lupin!
- Yes, I'm fine!
I can ﬂy through the air, because you believe in me.
You just wait, because your thief promises to steal you away.
Yes!
Damn! It's the ring, is it?
Give it to me.
Hey, Count, listen and listen good.
I've got the real ring.
If you lay a finger on that girl,
your precious ring will end up just like this.
It's a fake!
Damn them! Treating me like dirt!
- Did he fall?
- Probably.
- Make sure.
- This isn't a place that one survives.
If we throw him down there, he'll die for sure.
- He's got the ring.
- I see.
Just you wait.
I'll tear your sneak thief to shreds.
400 years' worth of killings and corpses. Rest in peace.
KAWAKAMI GENNOSUKE, SPY FOR
THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE ARMY,
MET HIS END HERE IN 1904...
REVENGE
Lupin, give yourself up!
I'm glad you're all right, old man.
Tell me where the exit is.
How did you get here?
I was dropped down here, too.
Judging by the way you look,
I'd say you've been down here a while.
Shut up! I won't take pity from a thief.
Well, let's take it easy, seeing as how there's no way out.
Excuse me a moment.
Hey, give me alight, old man.
Lupin, just what the hell is it with all these corpses?
This is no burial ground.
Take a look at that wall.
Why, this is...
Rest in peace. Rest in peace!
I didn't think this was your average castle, but what secret would they go to these lengths to protect?
Hey! Is this what you're after?
That's what Fujiko's doing.
I hope she doesn't become a corpse.
Anyway, there's no use wasting our energy.
Good night, old man.
It's cold.
What's the situation?
Nothing yet.
All we can do is wait.
They're taking a long time.
Master Jodo!
Excellent.
Take that!
Beware! It's Lupin!
Huh?
These are coffins!
What is this?
These are 10,000-yen bills!
Is that what all of these are?
These are well-made.
Have a look, old man.
West German 1,000-mark bills.
Pounds! Dollars! Francs! Roubles!
Rupees! Pesos! Crowns! Lira!
Oh, and they've even got Won!
All the world's currencies!
Lupin, is this the secret of the castle?
Counterfeiting?
That's right.
This is the source of the Goat Money, which was valued above the real thing at one time.
Since the upheavals in Medieval Europe,
the mysterious counterfeit currency has been lurking in the shadows.
It ruined the Bourbon Dynasty and was the source of Napoleon's funds.
It also triggered the worldwide panic of 1927.
The Goat Money, the Black Hole, the star on the backstage of history.
All those that tried to eliminate the heart of the problem
were never heard from again.
I've hear the stories about it, but I never dreamed that an independent nation was running it.
What are you gonna do, old man?
You can't turn your back on it now that you've seen it.
I know.
It would shame my policeman's blood.
What say we make a temporary truce, until we get out of here?
Fine, but I won't aid and abet crooks.
I'll arrest you when we escape,
I guarantee it.
Terrific.
Let's have a proper shake on it.
- I won't get friendly with you.
- Good grief.
Miss Fujiko!
I came to say goodbye while I have the chance.
Who in the world are you?
I'm the only person in the castle who's allowed to serve you.
But in reality I'm a spy, searching for the secrets of this castle.
I'd intended to stay a bit longer, but Lupin's here, so I'm leaving now, because things are going to get all screwed up.
You know him?
So well that I've gotten sick of him.
Sometimes we're friends, sometimes we're enemies.
We've even been lovers.
He's a born womaniser. Take care.
Did he drop you?
No, silly. I dropped him.
There's smoke coming from the pit.
It's a fire!
It's coming from beneath the castle.
- Something's happened.
- It's started.
It's a fire! There's a fire!
It's bad. We think the fire originated in the cellar studio.
What? Put it out! Quickly!
Close that pane!
You men, get going too!
Does this mean you've bungled again, Jodo?
Hurry up, old man!
We're gonna have company soon.
Evidence. I need evidence!
Why, that damned Lupin!
Find them! They must still be in here!
Don't flinch. Charge!
It's Lupin! After him.
You put out the fire.
A Chapel!
- Lupin!
- Lupin! And Zenigata!
They're going to steal the autogyro.
- Fool
- Save the recriminations for later.
They're heading for Lady Clarisse.
Hurry!
Hurry UP!
Halt!
Don't try to make a fool of the police!
Hop on, old man.
So long!
I'm gonna make a quick detour, old man.
- What, kidnapping for ransom?
- There won't be a ransom.
He's coming this way.
Bullet-proof glass.
The window doesn't open.
Go, please! Don't worry about me.
Take the controls, old man.
What? Lupin, hold on!
I've never done this!
- Clarisse.
- Lupin!
I've come for you. Fujiko, a rope.
Don't talk so big.
Fujiko!
Come on, move it!
- Lupin!
- It's all right now.
Over here, old man, over here.
It doesn't go that smoothly, you idiot!
That's it! That's good!
Don't move, female rat.
Fujiko, I have plenty of questions to ask you after this.
Jodo, give Lupin his coup de grâce.
Yes, sir.
Stop! Don't shoot!
If you kill him, I'll die too.
Fire.
An attitude worthy of respect, Clarisse.
Get the ring and come here.
If you marry me,
I'll spare Lupin's life.
Or you can die with him now.
I'll do whatever you want.
Lupin, give me the ring.
No, Clarisse. You mustn't.
Check the back of his collar.
Lupin always hides things there.
Damn. Fujiko!
Here's the ring.
If you don't spare Lupin and Fujiko,
I'll throw it into the lake.
Trust me.
Put on the ring and come here.
- I'll shoot them.
- Wait until she brings us the ring.
Lupin!
Fire! Bring them down!
Cowardly sneak!
You said you'd spare them.
How could I let people who've seen the underground studio live to tell?
It's in my hand at last!
Lupin, I'll consider this a debt you owe me. So long.
We're retreating without getting our turn!
This thing is useless now. Jump!
I've cut another worthless object.
Don't think you can escape me, Lupin!
This is embarrassing, no matter what we do.
This is a conspiracy.
Please give me the order to move out.
This is clear proof.
I saw rows of modern printing presses.
We know all that!
This is a highly political issue.
Interpol's authority is limited to international crime.
- Sir, this is clearly a crime.
- You don't understand, do you?
That's a sovereign country, a United Nations member.
Interpol can't compel a criminal investigation of it.
Moreover, the situation is extremely damning.
Have you seen the front pages of the world's newspapers?
"The bravery of the Count, who himself protected his bride."
"Lupin kidnapping plot falls."
It's also said that Lupin's associate was disguised as Zenigata.
That was the real me!
This is embarrassing.
These police officers are imprudent.
I thought I'd reported the facts.
The issue at hand is, who will the general public believe?
We don't stand a chance.
The Count has numerous friends in Western political circles.
If the truth is revealed, numerous countries will be embarrassed.
There's evidence that large quantities of US currency were ordered by a certain nation.
Ha! Aren't these counterfeit roubles a CIA order?
Stop it! It's embarrassing to bring conflicts between nations in here.
I ask that you all return to your countries and consider the situation.
We're all set to go, Inspector.
We can leave for Cagliostro at any time.
- We're not going.
- Huh?
They'll arrange my replacement the moment I do go.
We'd be relieved of the Lupin assignment. Prepare to go back to Japan.
It's me. I brought food.
- Thanks.
- How is he?
His fever seems to have gone down, thanks to your treatment.
If you want to thank anyone, thank the dog.
That old dog won't leave him, and he doesn't take kindly to anybody.
If not for that,
I wouldn't have taken you in.
Hi, there, Karl.
He's awake. How's the wound, Lupin?
Jigen... Goemon...
It's been a long time, hasn't it?
A long time?
What are you talking about?
It's a temporary confusion of memory, due to his injuries.
Isn't your mistress with you today,
Karl?
How do you know that dog's name?
Only Lady Clarisse knows that his name is Karl, except for me.
Clarisse, I see.
Your mistress' name is Clarisse.
Clarisse...
Lupin?
Jigen. How long have I been out?
How many days has it been?
Three... Three days.
What? The wedding is tomorrow.
I've got to...
Take it easy.
You'll tear open your wound.
Food! Bring me food!
Food? You mean rice gruel?
I've lost a lot of blood. Anything will do. Just bring me lots of it.
Since you put it that way...
I'll see what I can find.
Hey, stupid, don't wolf it down like that. Your stomach won't put up with it.
Shut up! I'll be fine in twelve hours and going like a jet!
Well, I told you this would happen, didn't I?
What's that?
He'll sleep, now that he's eaten.
I see.
You're here on Lady Clarisse's behalf.
But with Lupin in the shape he's in now, well...
You seem to be on close terms with Miss Clarisse, sir.
I was the gardener for the manor.
As a child, Lady Clarisse loved trees and plants.
When the Archduke and Duchess passed away, she entrusted me with her dog and entered the convent.
And he picked up his mistress' scent on Lupin's body.
How do you suppose he knows the dog's name?
How should I know?
He's a hard man to figure out, period.
- That's not it.
- You awake?
It's been more than ten years now.
I was a greenhorn looking for fame and excitement.
As the capstone to my foolish ways,
I made an attempt on the Goat Money.
Somehow I made it to the shore, but I couldn't get myself to move any farther.
Karl? What is it, Karl?
It looked like my crimes were coming back to haunt me.
I brought you some water.
The ring shone brightly on the finger of the trembling hand with which she held the water.
I am ashamed of myself.
I'd completely forgotten about that until I saw the ring.
That's Fujiko's motorcycle.
It's from today's newspaper.
It says an Archbishop is coming from the Vatican tomorrow for the wedding.
'Quit!
Fujiko?
What? Lupin's going to the wedding?
For real?
You have authorisation to go if Lupin's involved, am I right?
I see! That's how I'll play it.
We're in a hurry! Clear the road!
There's no point.
The route ahead is jam-packed.
They say there's a landslide seven kilometres ahead.
Are there any other ways there?
We're going to be late!
Say, are you the Archbishop?
Ah, yes, indeed you are.
Please bless this kid of mine.
You're a local, aren't you? Are there any other ways to Cagliostro Castle?
There's a back road, if you want to take it.
Thanks a lot. Will you show us the way?
Please, get in.
Yes, yes. Anything for the Archbishop.
Put your backs into it!
Cagliostro's just over this next hill!
We've got to get there by sunset!
Is this a good idea, opening this up to TV?
It's His Highness' wish to demonstrate to the world that this is a legitimate wedding.
Look, the Archbishop has arrived.
Do you think Lupin will show up?
My Shadowmen guard the bride.
You men will protect the gates.
Yes, sir.
The time has come for Light and Shadow to reunite. Come, Clarisse.
Bring forth the evidence that you are the legitimate heirs of the noble, ancient bloodline of the Family Cagliostro.
In accordance with the ancient custom, the vow of your marriage will be the exchange of your rings.
Clarisse de Cagliostro, daughter of the Archduke of Cagliostro, do you agree to this wedding?
Silence will be taken as a reply of, "No objection."
God's blessing on you both.
Objection!
This wedding is full and running over with the filth of desire.
It's haunted!
Calm down.
The rat has revealed himself.
We have come as representatives of the dead in the underground dungeon.
We want the bride.
- This makes the ceremony impossible.
- Get back. It's a good side show.
I've come for you, Clarisse.
It's a demon! A devil! A monster!
Something incredible has just happened!
Lupin has appeared!
Stop broadcasting.
What are you doing?
Move out!
Clarisse! Clarisse!
Poor girl, you've been drugged, haven't you?
The damned Count's made you incapable of speech, hasn't he?
- Lupin!
- No! You mustn't go near him.
That was foolish, Lupin.
Take care of those others.
Clarisse. Don't cry, Clarisse.
Now, I will go to you there.
Does my present suit you, Count?
Your Highness!
This is the counterfeit money you've made. Take it as a price for the rings.
Damn!
Find him, he's got to be in there!
Thanks a lot.
You! You're Lupin!
Lupin!
Damn you!
I won't play around with you any longer.
Hey, Count Royal Blue, don't get so hot with jealousy. You'll get burned.
Lupin! Lupin! Lupin!
Thank you for waiting, ladies and gentlemen.
We're now back on the air.
All hell has broken loose in the ceremonial hall.
So long, Count.
Die!
After them! Don't let them escape!
Lupin has escaped!
The Count is angrily pursuing him!
Oh, the police have arrived!
Lupin's under the altar. Surround it.
Charge!
Zenigata's men are charging toward the altar.
Oh, it's the palace guards!
With Captain Gustav in the lead!
Cover the rear!
Don't retreat. Justice is on our side.
This is truly an intense battle!
What in the world could be under the altar?
It's a staircase!
There's a hole underground.
Could Lupin be down that hole?
Let's take our camera down there and see.
Lupin, you scum!
Lupin! Lupin!
What is that fool doing?
He's disregarding orders! Recall him!
It's too late!
This is a satellite broadcast!
Huh? What's this?
Looks like the Bureau of the Mint!
And over there, that's...
Oh, no! Japanese currency!
And it's counterfeit!
He's being deliberately theatrical.
This is a terrible discovery.
Look! Counterfeits of all the world's currencies.
While chasing Lupin, I discovered all this! What am I to do?
The first thing we'll do is escape the castle.
Jigen, Goemon, cover us.
Leave it to us.
We'll hold them off here.
Take care of yourselves, please.
You too, Mr Jigen.
What?
Please come back safely. I'll never forget your kindness as long as I live.
Go on, get out of here.
Hurry, Clarisse.
I'm coming.
She called me "Mr Jigen".
She's sweet.
Let's get started.
Zantetsuken has a different feel tonight.
That damned Lupin. He hasn't won yet.
- Please leave the castle to me.
- Right.
Does your wound hurt?
Not at all, not at all. It's nothing.
Come on, let's get over this thing.
Two goats, face to face.
There are Goat characters carved where the rings meet.
"Light and Shadow..." I can't read them very well. They're worn away.
"Replace us in the eyes of the high goat that faces the sun
"and tells the time that joins Light and Shadow."
Those words have been told in my family for a long time. Are they of any help?
Yes, yes, they've solved the mystery!
It's the Count. Come on, this way.
They're going to hide in the clock tower. Bring the ship alongside.
There they are.
Here they come.
Ouch!
This is no good.
Deactivate the lasers.
They can't get out.
- Scared?
- No.
Excellent. Here we go.
Don't let them get away!
Don't look.
We can't do it here.
- You men, use the stairs!
- Yes, sir.
Wait here, I'll block their way.
- Be careful.
- I'll be right back.
There he is.
Lupin! Behind you!
Well, hello, Count.
I'll skewer you, rat!
So it's the finale at last, eh, Count?
One more swing.
Hey, come over here, you rotten Count.
Lupin!
I'll take care of you first.
Run, Clarisse! I'll catch up to you!
How far will you go, Clarisse?
Here, here, what's wrong?
Can't you run any more?
This is the end of the Cagliostro bloodline. Die, Clarisse.
Hold it, Count. I've got a deal for you.
You're too late. Watch as she dies.
Listen to me.
I'll tell you the secret of the rings.
You can do whatever you want with them.
But forget about the girl. Let her go.
Look at the Goat on the clock face.
The Goat faces the sun and tells time.
There are holes in both eyes to put the rings in.
I'll give you the rings.
But if you kill her, I'll throw them in the lake, and kill you.
That's far enough. Send Clarisse in.
All right, very well.
Lupin, you should hold on to your trump card until the very end!
Come here!
Now these are the real thing.
I accept the rings.
Now accept my payment for the solution to the mystery.
Let go! Let go of me!
Clarisse!
Let go!
The clock tower!
Your Highness!
What is that?
This is the end of Cagliostro, too.
Kill me.
I don't take life carelessly.
- Lupin?
- Can you stand? Take a look.
This is the hidden treasure.
A Roman city was lying at the bottom of the lake.
When the Romans were chased away from the site, they built a lock and sunk it, and your ancestors claimed it in secret.
It's really a treasure for mankind.
Certainly too big for my pockets.
Interpol finally decided to do something.
Will you be going now?
Since all the old men have come, yes.
Take me with you.
I can't be a thief yet, but I'll learn.
Please, take me! I want to go with you.
Clarisse...
Don't talk stupid. Do you want to go back into the darkness again?
You've come out into the sun at last.
Hey, your life begins now.
Don't become filthy like me.
I'll tell you what, if you're ever in trouble,
I'll fly straight to you no matter when, even if I'm on the other side of the world.
Karl!
Lady Clarisse!
Old friend!
"Lupin!
"30 long!
My lady!
Lupin!
Take care, Clarisse. Goodbye.
Thank you, everyone. Goodbye.
Goodbye! Goodbye!
Damn, I was a step too slow.
Lupin pulled off his theft.
No, he didn't steal anything.
He fought for me.
No, ma'am.
He stole something of no small value.
Your heart.
Yes, he did.
Well, then, I must be going.
Chase Lupin!
Chase him to the ends of the earth!
What nice people.
I feel as if I've known him all my life.
Lupin, I know we'll never meet again.
She's a nice girl.
You can stay here.
Fujiko!
Lupin, look at my trophies.
The counterfeit plans!
Hey, hey! Let's be friends.
So long!
Hey! Hey, may! Wait a second!
Oh, no, it's the old man again.
Lupin! I'll get you for sure this time!
The End.
