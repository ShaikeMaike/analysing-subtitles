Can you pick me up, Steiner?
Steiner, can you hear me?
Steiner.
- Good kill!
- Beautiful.
Look, my new weapon.
- Get one for yourself. 
- Some ammunition.
- Give him a hand.
- Of course.
Look at that!
- Nothing we haven't seen before.
- Steiner.
Look what I found running around in the back. A little Russian fledgling.
Put it down.
Quickly!
We go.
See if you can get Meyer. Tell him we'll need transportation from checkpoint seven.
Right, sir.
Bring him with us.
Push, push, push, push, push!
Come on, come on! Quickly!
All right, stop.
This damned country!
Once it was a new adventure, but I have a feeling that one of these days, this land will swallow us up.
Captain Stransky, sir.
- Colonel Brandt. You're welcome.
- Thank you, sir.
This is my adjutant, Captain Kiesel.
Captain, how are you?
Thank you for asking, Captain.
I feel terrible. I've got diarrhea.
How are you?
You should meet your own adjutant.
Lieutenant Triebig.
He's also a new arrival.
Won't you join us in a glass of wine?
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.
Take my coat, please.
Yes, sir.
My respects, Colonel. A 1937 Mosel in the southernmost corner of Russia.
Remarkable!
A bottle of Mosel is no more out of place in this region than we are ourselves.
Your health, gentlemen.
I'm not going to drink to my health.
It's not worth drinking to.
To the end of the war?
Colonel, why does our presence here strike you as so absurd?
Captain, why did you ask to be relieved from duty in France?
I want to get the iron Cross.
We could give you one of mine.
No, no, I'm just joking.
Actually it's exactly what my commanding officer in France asked me.
"L can't stop you," he said.
"Since I'm convinced that without you the Eastern Front"
"would collapse in a matter of days."
"Go ahead, you heroic horse's ass."
"Heroic horse's ass." His exact words.
I withdraw my toast to the end of the war.
To heroic horse's asses everywhere.
To the patient foolish.
Colonel, I would like to make something quite clear to Captain Kiesel.
I volunteered for this campaign because
I feel that men of quality are needed here.
It is time to destroy the myth of Russian invincibility.
Just how do we do that?
Bolstering morale, punishing those who are insubordinate and rebellious.
Instilling a new respect for ranking officers.
Low morale goes hand in hand with defeat after defeat followed by impending defeat.
Now you are new to our Russian front, so I don't blame you for talking like a horse's ass.
Of course, sir, I'm not familiar with the Russian front yet, but I firmly don't believe that the ideals of the German soldier even...
The German soldier no longer has any ideals.
He's not fighting for the culture of the West, not for one form of government that he wants, and not for the stinking party.
He's fighting for his life. God bless him.
Well, sir, I am a soldier, and as a soldier,
I feel it is my duty to subordinate my own ideas to the principles of my country, right or wrong.
Colonel Brandt, Lieutenant Meyer, sir.
- Yes?
- Steiner's on his way back.
- What sort of shape are they in?
- The usual!
Very well, I see.
I want a briefing as soon as they're rested.
- Yes, sir.
- And, Meyer, Captain Stransky is here.
See that he is informed of our situation.
Yes, sir.
- Steiner's back.
- Of course.
Who's Steiner?
To you, in some ways, he could be a problem.
But he's a first-rate soldier.
So, we look the other way.
Anything to add to that, Kiesel?
Steiner is a myth.
But men like him are our last hope.
And in that sense, he's truly a very dangerous man.
Well, I will see.
Colonel, with your permission.
Well, what do you think of our new captain?
I feel he thinks he is on some kind of special mission, that is, to achieve spiritual domination of his battalion, thereby symbolizing the purity of the great German Wehrmacht itself.
Even when going down in defeat.
If they're the last of us, Stransky and Steiner, then God help us.
Medic!
Medic! Medic!
Captain Stransky, welcome to the second platoon.
- Lieutenant.
- Meyer, Captain.
I am to show you to your quarters, brief you on our current situation.
- Where's my bunker?
- Down there, in front of the factory, sir.
- The second platoon is guarding your post.
- Where are they?
They're just returning from reconnaissance, sir.
- Who's in charge of it?
- Corporal Steiner, sir.
Oh.
What is so special about this Corporal Steiner?
Early in the Novorossiysk attack,
Corporal Steiner saved Colonel Brandt's life.
And mine, too.
Interesting.
Corporal Steiner!
I'm Captain Stransky.
I'm your new commander here.
Yes, sir.
Who's this?
Corporal Schnurrbart, sir.
And the other one?
That is a Russian prisoner, sir.
You know as well as I do that there are orders that no Russian prisoners are to be taken.
Get rid of him.
How, sir?
Well, shoot him!
You shoot him, sir.
I will. On the spot.
And then I'll deal with you.
No need. I'll see that it's taken care of, sir.
I want to see you in my bunker. One hour.
With your full report.
- Clear?
- Of course, sir.
- You already drank both the vodka.
- I'm using it for the cooking.
Oh, shit.
- Corporal Steiner?
- I'm Lily Marlene.
Come here, son.
Steiner!
I want to show you what our new army looks like.
- What's your name, son?
- Private Dietz, sir.
They're sending us babies now.
Hello, child.
Private Dietz.
How long have you been soldiering?
Six weeks, sir. I volunteered, sir.
Don't volunteer for anything around here.
Just keep your eye on Krüger here, and myself.
Do exactly as we say or you'll be wearing boots up your ass for a long time.
- Clear?
- Yes, sir!
- And don't call me sir.
- Excuse me.
Go with this foul-smelling one over here.
Put him in Schiller's bunk.
Kern, see if you can find a jacket or a blanket, something for the boy.
Get Schiller's jacket.
He must have something over there.
Yes, sir! Oh, excuse me.
Stand at ease.
Thank you, sir.
- My report.
- Thank you.
I regret the incident this afternoon, Corporal.
But orders are orders.
We have enough trouble with the feeding of our own troops without taking prisoners.
Anyway, it's very bad for security.
I've read your preliminary report, and it gives me great pleasure to inform you that
Colonel Brandt and I have agreed to recommend you for promotion to Senior Sergeant, effective at once.
Your promotion doesn't seem to have made much of an impression.
No, it doesn't.
All right.
I've read your report. Anything to add to this?
Russians, sir. We should be hearing from them very soon, sir.
- An offensive?
- Yes, I should think so, sir.
- Starting when?
- Soon.
- What about your platoon?
- Two killed, one missing.
Two killed, how?
Bullets. Mortar fire. Artillery.
Heavy salvos. Bad luck.
Terminal syphilis. The usual things, Captain.
The missing man, did you look for him, Steiner?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
I felt that it would be irresponsible of me to risk the safety of the entire platoon for the sake of one man.
You felt what?
A non-commissioned officer does not permit a missing man in such a case, in any case!
I'll try to do better next time, sir.
- I'd like to have that in writing.
- If you wish.
You know, Corporal... Sergeant,
I have a feeling you somewhat overestimate your importance.
At the moment,
I am free of any such illusions, sir.
Well, may I suggest to you that you do not underestimate your present company.
Everything you are and may become is dependent upon this present company.
No, I will not forget that, sir.
But I may add that a man is generally what he feels himself to be.
Of course.
You're dismissed.
I shall be back soon, sir.
Is that a salute?
Yes, sir.
- Triebig.
- Yes, sir.
You must be careful, Steiner.
He's taken a strong dislike to you.
I'll survive.
You're not dealing with just another Nazi Party type.
This one is pure Prussian military aristocracy and rich.
Hey, why are you bringing in the apples?
To eat, you overgrown idiot.
You know the ruling classes?
Come now, Lieutenant, what's left for them to rule?
Don't be naive.
Stransky will survive this war one way or another.
And he'll still have his land, his wealth, and his status.
But he'll be very dangerous in defeat.
Be careful with him.
He doesn't live in the same world we live in.
No, he's living in my world now.
Yeah, sure.
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah?
Please, would you come inside for a minute?
There's something I'd like to show you.
Kern, don't just stand there drinking, help us!
Thank you. I didn't realize that you knew.
Oh, you forget we are a reconnaissance platoon.
Happy birthday, Lieutenant Meyer.
- Yes!
- Happy birthday!
Explain everything to the Captain's orderly, so he doesn't make any mistakes, will you?
And take care of your uniform.
He's rather strict about it.
Russian vodka, German wine, chickens.
Oh, Maag, I don't know how we have stayed alive so long!
He's the best scavenger in the entire regiment.
- Cheers to all of you.
- Cheers!
Here's to the last Russian bullet.
Yeah!
Here's to survival.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah!
Here's to your wife, girlfriend, women!
Yeah! Women!
Here's to the women of the Folies-Bergère.
To the girls of the Reeperbahn!
Gently, gently.
Here's to Dietz's virginity.
Play your cards right and we'll introduce you to Triebig.
All you have to do is just bend over.
Here comes the cake.
Oh, cake!
Captain Stransky should see this.
- Captain who?
- Here's to the cake.
Cake! Here's to the cake!
Stop it! Stop it!
What are we doing here?
What do you think we are doing here?
Playing birthday games?
Right in the middle of all that shit!
- Come on...
- You shut up when I'm talking!
If you want a party, okay, drink.
Get drunk. Okay?
- Take it easy.
- There's a bullet for you, too.
- For all of you arseholes!
- Come on!
You, arsehole. You don't touch me.
You stink like a shithole.
Come on.
Let's not spoil everything.
This is Lieutenant Meyer's birthday.
Happy birthday, Lieutenant.
Have a good party.
- I'll have some more vodka.
- Here, fill it up.
Yeah, here's some vodka for everybody.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
All right, now.
Lieutenant Meyer is to have a meeting with our illustrious new commandant,
Captain Stransky, whom you'll all meet shortly.
This is not a funeral, gentlemen.
This is a birthday party.
Now let's drink.
We'll have a song, what the hell.
Thank you, sir.
Where were you stationed before you joined the battalion?
In the South of France. Biarritz.
I know it well. Sit down.
Sit down. Tell me about it.
It's such a beautiful country.
And being transferred must have come hard, hmm?
I applied for it as you did, sir.
As I did?
That's interesting.
And your orderly?
- We served together.
- In the South of France!
Those French girls!
Those French girls, Triebig!
I did not have much time to think about those French girls.
Really? And you, Keppler?
Did you enjoy the French girls?
On occasion.
Let me ask you a question, Triebig.
Do you like soldiering?
Certainly, I like it, sir.
But it's strange at times.
It is indeed a very different world.
A world of danger, and a world of men.
A world without women, hmm, Keppler?
- Yes.
- A world without women.
Thank you.
It's an old theory of mine.
Men can get along without women easily, easily, I tell you.
A man's true destiny is not just breeding children, all this childbirth, and chocolate, but to be free, to rule and to fight.
In other words, to lead a man's existence, women are no more than a nuisance.
Sometimes... Sometimes necessary.
I'm a soldier, sir.
If I have to, I can do without women.
Really?
And you, Keppler?
Can you do without women?
I do as I am ordered, sir.
I like that! I like that answer.
"L do as I am ordered." I like that.
What is your first name?
Josef.
Josef, Josef.
If it will help you,
I'll put your thoughts into the right words.
You prefer the society of men to that of women at any and all situations.
Right?
I don't understand, Captain.
Come on, Triebig.
You don't have to put up a front with me.
With me of all people.
What I said was right, wasn't it?
You prefer the society of men to that of women.
Come on, we're all soldiers.
There's no harm in it.
Say yes, for heaven's sake, man, say yes!
Possibly.
You said yes.
You said yes!
He said yes, didn't he, Keppler? He said yes!
You said yes. Didn't he, Keppler?
He said yes, didn't he, Keppler?
- Yes.
- Louder!
Didn't he, Keppler? Louder! Say yes, loud!
Yes!
- Louder!
- Yes!
I can assure you of this, if you get caught, you'll be hanged slowly, both of you.
Together.
Now get out of here.
Ammunition supply's running low.
Sector three needs more nine millimeter.
Steiner's platoon all secure.
Perimeter taking light mortar shelling.
Section Z47, no casualties.
By the way, we didn't get the mail.
That's a big one... Thank you.
Oh, I see.
Take your hands off my lice.
- Merde!
- Oh, not again!
Belch before farting, that's the rule.
Sector seven, no activity.
Get him outside.
Kern, get yourself outside. Come on, quick.
No, no, no, the Russians might think it's mustard gas.
The Geneva Convention forbids the use of mustard gas.
God damn it, Kern!
What type of exhaust pipe do you have and when was it broken?
I'm well-organized and without problems.
Are you equally guilty?
Krüger, is that your natural smell?
Listen, idiots,
I stay dirty for a reason.
If you'd been in the field for as long as I have been, you'd know why.
Explain.
I learned after Stalingrad.
Natural body oils combined with dirt can keep you waterproof.
Waterproof?
Sure.
How goes it?
Quiet.
Too quiet.
Yes.
They'll wait till first light.
Rolf, what are we doing here?
We are spreading the German culture throughout a desperate world.
Didn't someone say that war is the highest expression in life for the truly cultured people?
Yes, a foolish wise man named
Friedrich von Bernhardi.
- Right!
- Yeah!
- And Von Clausewitz said...
- Von Clausewitz?
Von Clausewitz said,
"War is a continuation of state policy."
"By other means!"
Yes, by other means.
Do you ever think about your children, Rolf?
- Always.
- Where are they?
I don't know.
Take off one uniform, there's always another one underneath.
Go!
It's all an accident.
An accident of hands.
Mine, others.
All without mind.
One extreme to another, and neither works.
Nor will ever!
Here we stand in the middle, in no-man's land, you and I.
Go home.
Go home!
Steiner!
- Yes, sir?
- Is it a probe, Stransky?
A probe, sir? It's an avalanche!
No, sir! It's an attacking force!
Sir, counter-fire is needed at once.
Otherwise, we'll be destroyed.
We're overrun! Move out!
I need help!
Be calm, Stransky. You are not alone.
What do you mean I'm not alone, sir?
I am alone! I am alone!
Steiner is gone, Triebig is gone,
I don't know where Lieutenant Meyer is.
I don't know! Is he dead?
- Then go to your second platoon...
- Is he dead?
Salient sector and find them!
And stand by and prepare the counterattack as quickly as possible.
Yes, sir! I will be counterattacking, sir!
Stay in your positions!
Hello? I will be counterattacking.
Get some more ammunition!
- Where's my weapon?
- On the wall, sir.
Get that ammunition!
Keep down, you fool!
You, get over there!
Get back to your post!
- Get that phone fixed.
- Yes, sir.
Get back there, damn you!
Keep your positions!
Everybody, keep firing!
Fall out, men! Fall out!
I need air cover!
Fire!
We're winning. We're winning!
Where's my air cover? Where are my tanks?
Shit!
The phone is ringing! Where's the phone?
Fire!
- Captain Stransky.
- Where's your counterattack?
We are attacking! We are defending!
We're counterattacking!
I'm wounded, sir. But I continue.
I know my duty, sir. Don't worry.
But I need ammunition!
Lieutenant Meyer!
Hollerbach! We must cover Steiner!
Look at me.
Follow the light with your eyes.
Very good.
That's it. Now look at me again.
Sergeant!
All right.
Did you sleep well?
Reasonably.
Smell?
Nothing.
Any sense of taste?
Improving.
Quite usual in concussion.
You've been like this for a week.
They should return soon.
Your records indicate multiple wounds over the last few years.
Any residual effects?
Headaches.
Blurred vision.
I can't urinate out of my left ear any longer, but otherwise I feel rather well.
The doctors recommend that you stay with us for another three weeks until they've completed your tests.
Then they recommend home leave.
Home.
Schnurrbart? Schnurrbart?
Attention! General Von Hessel!
Hello, soldier? How are you?
Tell me, how do you feel?
This man has severe concussion, sir.
He's been highly decorated.
I want 65 % of these men returned to active duty in three days.
Food!
Delicious!
Take the pig, the meat and the wine into the private dining room.
Come! Eat! Eat, eat, everybody! Everybody!
Vegetables are good for you.
They're with the compliments of the High Command.
Everybody looks like someone else around here.
Did I have a bad spell?
Yeah, you were very violent.
Violent?
Violence should stop. It must stop.
You say the violence must stop?
Oh, no, I'm on duty.
- Have a drink.
- No, I couldn't.
They'll throw me out.
Do you dance?
Hold my bottle. I'll hold your waist.
And we dance.
Listen, this is ridiculous.
It's nice.
Schnurrbart!
Rolf?
What the hell are you doing here? Lost?
No such luck, Rolf.
I got it in the leg same time you got it in the head.
Schnurrbart!
My vacation's over.
It's back to the bad side of old mother Russia.
They took us all from our hospital.
It looks like we're picking up some of your boys as well.
You want to come along or are you doing all right?
Attention, men! Prepare to leave.
Corporal! Hold this truck.
What the hell are you talking about?
That's an order, God damn it!
- Rolf?
- What?
- What is it?
- What?
What's the matter?
I'm going back.
I thought you were going back home.
I have no home.
My home.
Our home.
Do you love the war so much?
Is that...
Is that what's wrong with you, Steiner?
Or are you afraid of what you will be without it?
Long live Germany.
I said to hold it, right?
Steiner, I didn't mean it. You're crazy!
Schnurrbart.
Rolf!
Son of a bitch!
- Schnurrbart!
- Hello, Kern!
- Hello, Hartwig.
- Hello, Sergeant.
- Hartwig!
- Schnurrbart, how are you?
Caught with your pants down again?
Anselm.
Welcome back, Sergeant.
- Hollerbach!
- Rolf, hello.
Good to have you back, Schnurrbart.
Krüger!
You're back too soon.
I don't want to talk to you.
Leave me alone.
Get your ass out of there, you old pirate.
I missed you. I missed you! Yeah.
My, my, my! What is this?
- That's Zoll.
- That's a Party member Zoll.
With compliments of Captain Stransky.
S.S. Special Action Squad.
You still a Party member,
Hollerbach?
Well, Rolf, I'd dance with the party if I could find one.
Hey, silence. The Party's convinced we are winning the war.
Yeah, sure, we're winning the war.
I hope you've memorized our serial numbers, our mothers' maiden names correctly.
I wouldn't want the Gestapo to come and arrest the wrong man, woman or child.
I don't care what you believe, or what you've done.
Your duty is to us, the platoon and me.
Fulfill those responsibilities or you will have a bayonet up your ass.
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.
I am playing nursemaid to the third squad, any volunteers?
- Not me.
- No chance.
- Go alone this time.
- Enjoy yourself.
Thanks a lot.
What have we here, a hawk and a hare, eh?
I'll take you.
Come on, have a drink.
- That's your bottle.
- Cheers, Rolf.
Give me that thing. Come on.
Gentlemen.
Cheers.
Some papers for you to sign, Captain.
I'll sign them later.
Stop that! Be careful with my J.J.
Yes, sir.
Have her treated correctly.
- Sergeant Steiner reporting as ordered, sir.
- Come in.
Thank you. That will be all, gentlemen.
- Welcome back, Sergeant Steiner.
- Thank you, sir.
Please sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
Well, now that you're back, and I'm glad you're back.
I think we should make a fresh start together.
But the main point is the regiment feels or believes that I deserve the iron Cross now.
And they've asked me to produce two witnesses to the fact that I led the counterattack and threw the Russians out of their positions.
I have named Lieutenant Triebig and you.
Especially you.
Lieutenant Triebig has already submitted his signature.
Am I to believe this is a private conversation?
That would occur to you, wouldn't it?
All right, have some wine, a '36 Mosel.
I'll have some.
Thank you, Sergeant.
But still remember that in civilian as well as in military life the distinction is made between people.
Is that what you meant when you said,
"All you are and may become"
"is dependent upon this present company?"
Well, the difference is a matter of ethical and intellectual superiority which is caused, whether you like it or not, by blood and by class difference.
If I remember correctly Kant was the son of a saddle maker and Schubert's father was a poor schoolmaster.
Perhaps talent, sensitivity and character are no longer privileges of the so-called upper class.
But Kant and Schubert were exceptions.
We're talking about general concepts,
- not individuals.
- But I am one and so are you.
Didn't your führer say that all class distinctions were to be abolished?
I'm an officer of the Wehrmacht.
I've never been a Party member.
I'm a Prussian aristocrat and I don't want to be put into the same category!
So we agree for once.
Good.
But he is still our führer.
Unfortunately.
Oh...
That is a different question, Sergeant.
That's not up to us to judge.
Why do you want it so badly?
It's just a piece of worthless metal.
Look!
It's not worthless to me.
Why is it so important to you?
Tell me, Captain, why?
Sergeant, if I go back without the iron Cross
I couldn't face my family.
Personally, sir, I don't feel you deserve the iron Cross.
Incoming!
Where are you going?
I'm going to point 124.
Corporal Krüger's over there.
Are you crazy?
No one could survive this kind of assault.
Get out of my way, God damn it.
I'm going after him.
Steiner!
You get me some stretcher-bearers, damn it.
Steiner! Steiner!
The others?
Dead, all dead.
Oh, God. Listen to me.
We are going to leave now.
Will you get up and follow me out of here?
All right?
Three hours.
Three hours I've been here by myself.
I don't ever want to be alone again.
You won't, you won't.
Come on.
Why the hell wasn't I told of Steiner's return to the battalion?
My apologies for that, sir.
There were more important things to do.
I want him here at once.
About a predicament of which I am sure you don't need to be reminded.
- Clear, Stransky?
- Quite clear, sir.
Now we shall see.
I don't like the tone of his voice.
I'm fed up with the whole situation.
Well, it doesn't matter anymore.
I know from reliable sources that headquarters have already written off the Kuban bridgehead.
And soon the whole Crimea will be a cul-de-sac.
Report to Brandt.
If you have the choice, Triebig, between Biarritz and Siberia, what would you choose?
- Steiner.
- Colonel.
Sit down please, Steiner.
How was hospital?
Oh, interesting.
I recommend it.
Did Captain Stransky lead the counterattack the day Lieutenant Meyer was killed?
Lieutenant Meyer led the attack.
Captain Stransky was nowhere in sight.
You're sure of that.
I saw Lieutenant Meyer die.
Fetch Triebig.
Stay, I want you to listen.
Sir?
You signed your Captain's report.
Were you present when Captain Stransky led the counterattack?
I accompanied Captain Stransky to the field and saw him calling several men around him.
Then he sent me back to the command post.
Then how do you know that Captain Stransky led the counterattack?
You've signed a statement to that effect, Triebig.
I wasn't there. I learned of it from wounded men who were returning.
Can you give me the name of one of these wounded men?
They were not staff men, just company men.
I knew them only by sight.
Besides, the smoke, the battle.
We had been under fire, sir.
I want you to know, Triebig, that I have had your statement checked.
Captain Kiesel will inform you of the results of our investigation.
Our investigation so far has disclosed that the men in the second company who took part in the action declared unanimously that the action was led by Lieutenant Meyer.
None of them saw Captain Stransky or Lieutenant Triebig.
To my mind there is nothing more contemptible than stealing the laurels which properly belong to a man who was killed in action.
If Sergeant Steiner stands by his last testimony,
I should be compelled to institute disciplinary proceedings against the Captain and you.
Yes, sir.
Do you stand by your statement that Captain Stransky was not with the company?
Would it be possible for me to give my answer in three or four days, sir?
Did you see Stransky or not?
You may go, Triebig.
You're no longer needed.
What in God's name has got into you?
This is your chance!
You are the only person that stands between Stransky and his iron Cross.
And you could be called as a primary witness against him in a court of honor.
My differences with Captain Stransky are a personal matter.
Now listen to me.
You know that I've always shown a great deal of understanding for you, but I'm becoming tired of battling with your superiors.
I never ask you to.
Didn't ask me to!
You never asked me to?
Are you out of your mind?
Steiner, why are you so ungrateful?
What do I have to be grateful for, Captain?
Your tolerance?
Do you think that just because you and Colonel Brandt are more enlightened than most officers that I hate you any less?
I hate all officers, all the Stranskys, all the Triebigs, all the iron Cross scavengers in the whole German army.
Have you any idea what you're saying?
Do you know how much I hate this uniform and everything it stands for?
God!
Get out.
Please, just get out.
Regimental headquarters.
Division headquarters, sir.
General Von Kellinshofe.
Colonel Brandt.
Yes, General.
Yes, sir. I didn't know it was as bad as that.
I am very sorry to hear it.
Well?
We're pulling back to the bridgehead at Kuban.
No rear guard. Not even Steiner's platoon.
We're not retreating. We're running.
Captain Stransky. Yes, Captain Kiesel.
I was just about to leave.
Don't leave just yet. Now listen to me.
Regiment feels that it is unwise and also suicidal to leave behind any rear guard platoons including Steiner's.
I want them to join the evacuation immediately.
You understand that?
Yes, Captain.
Triebig?
All real guard platoons to join the evacuation immediately.
Shall I notify Steiner's platoon?
Yes.
Give me Steiner.
Calling Regiment.
Regimental headquarters. Come in, please!
Regimental headquarters! Come in, please!
Regimental headquarters. Come in, please!
B Company, can you hear me?
Anybody come in, please!
Tanks!
Captain Stransky, can you hear me?
Krüger!
All the lines are out.
Better get 'em out!
Down the tunnel!
Out!
Go into the factory.
Get everything?
Fire!
Zoll, grab some mines. Bring them up. Quick!
On the tracks, Zoll.
Put them on the tracks.
Hurry! Move!
Heads down.
Into the factory. Over to the factory!
Move, damn it!
Maag, they're coming in from both sides.
Kern, up above!
Krüger, get up on the gangwalk! Hurry.
Quick! Down the tunnel!
Anselm! The grenade! Come here!
Throw it!
Shit! Jesus Christ!
Steiner, let's go!
It's clear.
Dietz. Cover for us.
Hurry! Move!
- Captain Pucher reporting, sir.
- Yes, Captain.
You have your orders?
And a letter for you to be delivered personally.
Thank you.
You can guess what this is, can't you?
- A transfer.
- Exactly.
Our Stransky is to report to Paris within a week.
Captain Pucher, my orderly will see to your billeting.
But don't unpack everything.
We might be going away.
Captain.
Stransky.
Without Steiner to contradict him, he'll get his iron Cross and strut all around Paris.
The arrogant, unbloodied bastard.
Stransky in Paris and Steiner...
God knows where he'll be.
It seems there's...
What, 22, 23 kilometers between... here and Anapa.
Marshland. Wilderness.
It's the same trap behind the Russian lines.
Again shit, again shit, again shit...
Here take your gun.
Again shit, again shit, again shit...
We'll try the road.
Hey, we'll never get over this road.
What's your hurry, kid?
We'll get out of this mess in time for the next one.
Steiner! Steiner, it's clear now.
Let's go. Move it, move it!
Anselm, move your ass!
The cattle cars or whatever they're sending are due to arrive at 1200 hours, provided, of course, that the Russian sappers have not blown up the track.
- Any questions?
- No, sir.
Dismissed.
Carry on probing and aggressive actions all along the front.
They're not listening.
You, too.
I beg your pardon?
Who needs a railroad track?
When we break out of here, we'll push on with a blitzkrieg through Stalingrad and up to the outskirts of Moscow.
What will we do when we lose the war?
Prepare for the next one.
Do you think he'll get through?
Steiner?
I don't see how he can.
Anselm, go bring Zoll in.
- What is it?
- Bridge.
Just bring what you need to kill with.
- It's a game.
- A game?
It's a kid's game.
It's bad luck to step on sunlight.
I thought perhaps if I miss the beams we would all come through this all right.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Over there, get in the corner.
Jesus Christ!
Get these weapons out of here!
Krüger, upstairs! Schnurrbart, perimeter.
Check the other buildings.
Come here. Get in that corner.
Get in that room.
Come on, pretty rabbit.
Don't hide from me.
Check the radio, and get that body out of here.
Anselm.
- Stay there!
- Get your hands off.
Anselm, stop it, damn it!
- Anselm! Anselm!
- Leave me, Steiner.
Wait. Stop it!
Stop your fucking silly game!
This isn't a brothel!
This is a war!
Rolf, look what I found.
I said get that body out of here.
Everything clear out here.
What is this?
It shows their basic positions in front of Anapa.
Good.
Means we're halfway home.
Thank the ladies and tell them to take their clothes off.
And what shall we do with the bodies?
Who's gonna keep them warm?
- Tell them we want their tunics and trousers.
- We are going to die anyway.
- Do it! Do it!
- We are going to die anyway. Let me...
Let me keep one.
Major.
Major!
She's dead.
- Dietz, Zoll, watch them.
- Yeah.
The rest of you, put these uniforms on.
Come on, get over there with the rest of them.
Pick up your weapons.
Up, up, out!
Get that uniform and take it inside.
Oh, shit.
Go over there.
Come on, pick it up.
You want to play? All right.
That's a nice little girl.
That's it.
Come on.
I'll give you something to play with.
I'm gonna be busy for a while.
Come on.
How would you like it?
That's nice.
Steiner!
Oh, Dietz.
Jesus Christ.
Dietz.
Oh, God. God.
Don't... hurt the girl.
Do you believe in God, Sergeant?
I believe God is a sadist but probably doesn't even know it.
Zoll!
Stupid man!
Steiner! God!
Take the women outside. With me.
Come on. Go!
Move out! Come on!
All of you get inside. Inside!
Steiner!
Now we're even.
And there's one other thing you could do for me.
There's a man here that I would like to get out quickly.
I spoke to you about him before.
If there is a chance that he could leave with your headquarter staff,
I will be most grateful. Thank you, sir.
They're rolling up both flanks.
It's chaos.
That need no longer concern you.
You're to report at once to General Headquarters.
You're being evacuated.
I can't leave the Command, sir.
While I'm still in a condition to issue orders, those orders will be obeyed.
I'm prepared to disobey that order, sir.
You've been around Steiner too long.
Come, listen to me for a moment.
For many of us Germans, the exterminator is long overdue.
But I have decided that you are worth saving.
But I'm part of all this.
There are better people than me.
Most of them are being killed out there.
There's nothing wrong with you except that you smoke too much.
You're a brave man.
Braver than you think you are.
One of these days there will be a need for brave civilians.
Had you thought of that?
In the new Germany, if such a thing is allowed to exist, there will be a need for builders, for thinkers...
For poets.
I begin to see now what your job is to be.
I will make this my final order to you.
You will search out and contact all of these... better people, you call them?
And together you'll take on the responsibility that goes with survival.
Now you must leave.
Please leave.
Braun, take Captain Kiesel to the railhead!
Go.
Steiner, how do we get through the Russian trenches?
It's only a matter of time.
They'll be building them for a thousand years.
- If not here, somewhere else.
- Not Germany.
Germany.
Do you think they'll ever forgive us for what we've done?
Or forget us?
We'll make it. We will make it with your help.
To tell you the truth I'm...
I'm beginning to enjoy it.
Well, you want... to be sitting in some mud hole some place, waiting for the top of your head to be blown off?
At least here we're free.
Steiner.
Steiner?
Sing it!
Go! Go!
Here, Sergeant. Here's your weapon.
Then all we have to do is hope our own artillery doesn't get us.
Or the landmines.
Two hundred meters to go.
Anselm.
- Yes?
- Try to raise somebody on that radio.
Tell them we're coming in at dawn.
We need a password. What's...
What's the password?
Reconnaissance Patrol with several Russian prisoners and no shooting.
Password, Krüger, God damn it!
"Demarcation."
Why not? "Demarcation."
"Demarcation." Sign it Steiner.
Captain, special password "Demarcation."
Signed Steiner.
Coming in with prisoners.
Looks like a trap.
My thoughts exactly, sir.
He may have been captured.
- Wolf.
- Sir?
Did you recognize the voice?
No, sir, it was in code.
Good code, "Demarcation."
Triebig...
If in the dark, you saw half a dozen men, some in Russian uniforms, advancing on you.
Could anyone blame you if you opened fire?
No.
Will you check the situation for me and, take care of it?
You do like Biarritz, don't you?
You do like the South of France, don't you?
Come on.
Oh, shit!
- Kern.
- Yeah.
You and I will carry the weapons.
The rest of you make sure your hands are clearly placed behind your heads.
I'll go first, Sergeant.
No, Goddamit, Schnurrbart.
There might be some asshole who didn't know what the message is.
No, I go.
Rolf!
You've been responsible for all of us.
This time I'm responsible for you.
Take us in.
Sir, look here.
Welcome, Sergeant Steiner.
My passage home.
Steiner!
Demarcation! Steiner!
Steiner, we're coming out!
- Demarcation!
- Demarcation!
Steiner's coming in!
Demarcation!
Demarcation!
Barrage!
Russians right in front.
Schnurrbart, move out!
Stand by to fire.
Go, go!
Fire!
Demarcation!
It's Steiner!
It's a trap. Fire!
No!
God damn it!
Sir, they look like prisoners.
Steiner!
There are German soldiers with them.
- Stop it!
- Stop it!
The fucking idiots.
We're German soldiers...
Fire!
Stop it!
Stop it!
No!
- Keep firing!
- Stop, God damn it!
Fire!
Oh, my God!
It's Steiner!
You, stop!
Go get my men, go!
- Stop it!
- Stretcher-bearers.
Bloody Nazi swine!
Swine!
It's all Stransky's orders!
I had no part in it.
We're sorry.
He's dead.
I had no part in it!
I'm Private Dietz, sir.
You're on your own.
If I don't find you, join up with another outfit, another platoon.
A deserter. I don't care.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Where are you going?
To pay my debts.
You are our platoon leader!
This thing isn't over yet.
You're the new platoon leader.
And Anselm is your platoon.
That should make you happy, you old pirate.
Steiner! Steiner!
Steiner!
Yes, Colonel Brandt?
Situation is worsening here. You're needed.
If my orders are here...
And they are here, sir, then my replacement is already with the Company.
You may leave, Stransky.
Your Triebig is dead.
It didn't work, Captain.
I live.
You are dead.
Lieutenant Triebig has not been under my command for several hours.
- He has been transferred.
- You aristocratic... pile of Prussian pig shit!
Leaving without your iron Cross, Captain?
Just a matter of time.
Where's the rest of your platoon?
I said, "Where's the rest of your platoon,"
Sergeant Steiner!
You are...
Captain Stransky.
You are the rest of my platoon.
- Know how to use it?
- Yes, of course.
Fine, I accept.
I'll show you how a Prussian officer can fight.
And I'll show you where the iron Crosses grow.
Now!
Hey, get out! Get out of the way!
Stop there!
Advance with me.
Get up.
Stransky, God damn it! Get off your ass!
I have to reload.
How do I reload, Sergeant Steiner?

Ammo!

Sotnikov, let's move out!
I'll cover you!
Move out!
I can't -
Rest.
Just a moment. Just a moment, dear.
We'll get you something to drink, something to eat.
Krotsky -
What?
Get it out.
Get what out?
Whatever there is left to eat.
Well, that was good going.
So where are the sleds?
We should move on.
Then we'll be okay.
We need to get out of here and find something to eat.
Then you'll be the one to get it.
We have to stay here a while.
You know the Kurgaev farm?
Kurgaev? I do.
He's got a woman there.
Hey, you. Watch it.
Make a run over there. Be quick.
This is us.
Here's Dubovoi's camp.
- What about the wounded?
- And the children?
The families need to be delivered safely.
And without food, you yourself know -
It's still a long ways to Dubovoi.
A long way to go.
How about finding a boar?
We could feed everyone.
Pack up.
What, alone?
Take someone with you.
Stoptsov.
What kind of help could I be?
Right.
Matyushenko.
- They're calling you.
What's going on there?
This weapon's jammed.
But I could go.
Whatever you say.
No. Fix it so it shoots by morning.
Fine.
Is your weapon in order, Artillery?
All in order.
Kolya!
Say hi to Zosya!
Eat some snow. It helps.
Damn! Won't go away.
Can't do anything about it.
Why didn't you stay?
Someone else could've come.
Who?
We're in deep now.
Used up the last of the ammo on some patrollers.
Doesn't matter.
Once we get to Dubovoi, we'll have plenty.
You shoot pretty good.
Good eye.
Are you really from the artillery?
- Really.
A regular soldier then.
Not quite.
How's that?
I taught math.
I graduated from the teacher's college in Vitebsk.
Math? That's good.
Walk in my footsteps.
It'll be easier.
I've been meaning to visit her for a while now -
- Who?
- Zosya.
My Zosya's there. She's terrific.
You've got girls on your mind.
Why not? It's not all just about war.
No, it's not like that.
Zosya and her folks are like family to me.
They hid me when I was wounded, and with the Germans all about.
You were surrounded?
They saved me, didn't give me away.
They knew who they were hiding - a company commander, after all.
A regular soldier.
When we were parting,
Kurgaev gave me his short fur coat.
Then they sent me off to the partisans as if I were their own son.
Are you kidding?
No hard feelings at all.
Even though they knew about Zosya and me.
You know, she came to me on her own.
I wasn't even thinking about it.
I was sleeping.
And in the morning,
I hear someone breathing heavily.
I felt heat sweeping all over me.
Damn. I would've married right away if it wasn't for the war.
Is it still a long way?
We're getting close already.
See what I mean?
Talking makes the road shorter.
I don't know about you but I can't stand these lone assignments.
Even the easiest ones.
I'd rather make a hundred attacks, as long as I'm in the ranks.
But at night, the forest -
It's hard, you know.
Maybe -
Maybe they... had time to get out.
Tell you what. Go on back.
I'll go on another couple of kilometers.
Can't go back empty-handed.
What the hell?
I said I'd go alone.
You'll freeze without a hat.
- Hats don't grow in the woods.
In the village, every man has a hat.
So I should snatch it from someone, you say?
Snatch it?
There's always a way to talk to people.
You just need to know how.
Here. It's warmer than nothing.
- No, don't.
Cut it out. Don't be fussy.
It's nice and warm.
Want some?
Go ahead, eat.
Actually, thanks for not leaving.
When there are two -
Well, let's move on.
Where is this damn village?
Are you the headman?
Well?
Anyone else here?
Just us.
Any Germans in the village?
Germans? No.
There's only a policeman left behind.
Got a cow?
Yes.
So far.
You should eat something.
I've got something hot here.
Fine, but make it quick.
So you work for the Germans.
Do they pay much?
I haven't asked for anything, and I haven't gotten anything.
He's an old man.
He did a stupid thing.
- Keep quiet.
Take your hat off.
- Your son?
- Our son. Our Tolya.
Is he with the police too?
No, for God's sake!
He's at the front.
We don't know if he's alive or not.
Yeah.
You're a disgrace to your son.
You sold out.
Put your Bible down.
Well!
Gripping like a -
Let's go.
- Son. Son, dear -
- Keep quiet.
Move it.
- Our Father.
- Wait!
Don't! Have mercy on the fool!
Son, dear.
He's going to shoot him.
You should've thought of that earlier.
You think he wanted to be a German headman?
They threaten him every day.
Shouting.
Putting a gun to his head!
Son, dear, let me out.
Let me see.
Let me see what's happening.
Son, dear -
Son! What are you -
What's with you?
- Nothing.
You're sick with fever.
Your friend's calling you.
He's sick.
Here's some dry raspberries.
You can make tea someplace.
Something to drink.
- No, thanks.
Why not?
Go on.
And shut the door.
What, you're letting him go?
The hell with him.
Sorry.
I'm no help today.
Why the hell did you come then?
You asked already.
"Asked."
Those other two wouldn't come, and you -
Stop it! Stop it already!
Where are we?
I didn't notice.
Are we going the right way?
I think so.
Faster!
So you want to take me alive.
Just a second.
Damn it.
There.
Now you won't take me.
Sotnikov.
Where are you hit?
- In the leg.
Let's go.
I can't.
Come on.
Come on.
What is it?
Come on.
Does it hurt?
What's with you? Help.
One moment.
One moment.
Grab on.
This is the end of it.
Where to now?
It's all lake.
Wait here.
I'll look around.
Looks okay.
There's a cabin close by.
It looks empty.
Sotnikov, what's with you?
You'll see.
Maybe -
I'll take you there.
We'll get warm.
And then -
I'll stay here.
Yeah. You know, that'll be better.
I need to go. The boys are waiting.
I'm frozen.
It's all right.
It's all right, brother.
I'll come back for you.
Then we'll move you.
I'll come back for you.
I'll really come back for you.
Kolya. Everything's fine.
I was only afraid to die out in the open field.
In the night, alone like a dog.
In the woods, it's not frightening.
The main thing is to get used to the thought:
Is this to be the end?
Go on in.
Are you alone here?
Yeah.
Where's your father?
He's gone.
Your mother?
She works for old man Yemelyan, earning money for food.
I see.
Any Germans in the village?
No.
They came once and took our pig.
They took it away in a truck.
What's your mother's name?
- Demchika.
- So you must be Demyan, then, right?
They also call Mama "Polgeniya."
Are you partisans too?
What do you need to know for?
You're just a kid.
Say, is there any hot water?
There is. Wait.
Bring us some.
Maybe you've got some food too?
Mama boiled potatoes.
Do you have any bread?
Leonik ate it all yesterday.
Here's some, a treat.
Thank you.
Scram!
That's Mama.
Mama! We've got partisans here!
Hello, ma'am.
What's this about?
We were waiting for you.
What for?
There's no bread. There's no butter.
Galya, take Katya.
No hens to lay eggs!
We're being nice to you, woman, and you're angry with us.
If I were angry with you, you'd be out of here.
Galya, I said take Katya!
I'll punish you!
When's the last time you saw Dyomka?
How do you know about Dyomka?
We know him.
He's wounded.
The bullet's still inside him.
We'll have to get it out.
Forget it. You can't get it out.
They say there was crying over by Lesiny all night.
They say a German got shot.
Who says?
The old women always talk.
The old women?
The old women know everything.
Get out of there.
All right. That's that.
But now what?
That's the question.
How should I know what you should do?
You see?
He can't walk. That's for sure.
You got here, didn't you?
Quit it, Rybak. Let's go.
Hold on!
Germans.
They're heading this way.
In the attic! In the attic!
In the attic! Go!
Hello, Prava. How are things?
See any strangers?
Like I've got nothing better to do than to look for strangers.
- Seen any or not?
- No.
Invite your guests into the house.
They're inviting everyone to the cemetery, and you call them "guests".
What did you say?
You're gonna get it.
Hurry up! Don't stand there.
Can't you see they're cold?
Make up something to eat.
Who stole our pig?
You shameless bastard!
And you're a Red Army bitch!
Maggot!
German scum!
Bitte, come inside.
I tell you there's no one there!
- Where's the ladder?
- We never had one.
All right, if you don't want to -
Come here!
Come here! Red bitch!
Hold it right there, like this.
Give me the machine gun.
I'll rake through it.
Don't shoot!
Gotcha, sweeties!
Get your hands up! Now!
Hands up! Hands up!
Well, well. So here they are.
Get your hands up, I said!
Mama!
Mama!
My babies! My sweet babies!
My babies! My babies!
Stas', tell them to let me go!
Stas', who'll take care of the kids?
Let her go.
The woman's got nothing to do with this!
You Red scum!
Bastard! Why do you need to hit him?
Here. This'll keep you quiet.
Got a smoke?
What are you staring at?
And, you, move it.
You're crawling along like a fly.
COMMANDANT
Take these rabbits!
We'll find a home for you.
Find out where to put them.
You, short coat, get out!
I'll deal with the short-coat.
Go on.
Get up, you partisan scum.
And you to the commissar.
Go on!
You scum!
You bastard!
Help me out here.
Who are you?
Gamanyuk!
Why is he roughed-up?
My fault.
- Why is he on the floor?
- My fault.
- Were these my orders?
- My fault.
Did you say something?
Untie him.
Let's get acquainted.
My name's Portnov.
Police investigator.
My name won't mean anything to you.
Tell me anyway.
Let's just say Ivanov.
I've nothing against that.
Let it be Ivanov.
From what squadron?
Don't start with that.
I'm not saying anything.
You won't?
No.
What was your assignment?
Where were you going?
How long has that woman been your agent?
She's no agent.
We chanced upon her.
And you visited the headman by chance too.
- Yes, just by chance.
- Not too original.
Do what you want with us, but don't touch the woman.
She's got three kids.
I had no idea there were kids there.
Where were you wounded?
In the woods, two days ago.
It wasn't in the woods.
And it was last night.
See?
I know enough about you to have you shot.
I can even see you're prepared for that.
But the children.
The children.
It's impossible to prove their mother is innocent.
You were found in her house, with weapons.
And there's a war on.
You made a mistake.
- I know it.
- So fix it.
Where's your squadron, your comrades?
Their positions.
You want to save the woman without giving up anything?
That won't work.
You'll have to trouble your conscience.
One way or the other, you'll have to.
There's no way out.
None.
I won't betray anyone.
Not anyone.
There are things more important than one's own hide.
Where?
What is it? What's it made of?
That's nonsense.
We're mortal.
With death, everything ends for us - all of life.
The entire world.
It's not worth it.
For what?
As an example for future generations?
But you won't have a heroic death either.
You won't just die.
You'll croak like a traitor.
And if you won't tell, someone else will.
And we'll write it off to you.
Understand?
Scum.
Human scum.
Gamanyuk.
Right here.
- Ask the chief -
- The redhead?
Yes.
Now you'll see what true scum is.
Don't be surprised.
It won't be me, but yourself.
You'll discover something in yourself that - that you'd never imagine.
Where will your perseverance go?
And the fanatic glitter in your eyes.
It'll all be taken over by fear.
That's right.
The fear of losing that hide.
And then you'll find out who you are - alone, deserted - a simple human nonentity full of ordinary shit.
Without any of your noble words or arrogance.
There.
That's where the truth is.
You didn't insult me.
No.
I know what a human being really is.
And you'll find out too.
Listen.
What were you before the war?
Go on, begin.
Take him away!
Who's your partner?
What's his last name?
- Well -
- Don't lie! Don't lie!
I really don't know.
I haven't been in the squadron long.
What's his connection to the woman?
- With Demchika?
- Yes.
None.
You want to stay alive?
Of course.
Who doesn't want to live?
Have a seat.
Last name.
Rybak.
- Birth date.
Where were you born?
Near Gomel.
Where were you headed?
For food, to the farm.
Turned out the village had been burned down.
What village?
What's it called? Kurgaev.
And how did you end up in Lesiny?
Simple. We walked at night and found the headman.
So you were going to the headman?
Of course not.
I said we were going to the farm.
Who's the head of your troop?
What's his name? Dubovoi.
Where's the squadron?
- In the woods.
- Which woods?
Parkovsky.
How many people in the squadron?
- Around 500.
- You're lying!
According to our information,
Dubovoi has more.
Of course there were more.
There's all those punishment forces.
There are battles, losses.
They've put you in a squeeze.
And that's only the beginning.
So you were going to Lesiny?
I said we were going to the farm.
The farm had burned down.
That's right.
And Kurgaev and Kurgaev's kids have been shot!
So you were born in Mogilev.
Mogilev -
From Mogilev or from around Gomel?
From Gomel. From Gomel.
- Last name!
- Whose?
- Yours!
- Rybak.
Who was shooting at night - him or you?
Him then.
Right?
What's his last name?
I don't know.
And that headman -
Sych, as you say - what is he?
What Sych? What Sych?
I didn't say anything!
I don't know any Sych!
Fine. Fine.
I see you've got a head on your shoulders.
I think we'll save your life.
You don't believe it?
We can do that.
If you don't lie, you'll join the police.
You'll serve Greater Germany.
Me?
Yes. You.
Why, you -
You don't have to answer right away.
Go and think it over.
What did you say the last name was?
Gamanyuk!
Right here.
Well?
I don't know.
No.
Good boy.
Put him in the basement.
But the redhead -
Are you deaf?
And bring in the headman.
- Got it.
Bitte, please.
Have a rest, sweetie!
Bastards!
What did they do to you?
Kolya, did you -
Did you scream?
It doesn't matter.
Did you stand up to it?
It'll be all right.
Bastards.
It can't be.
We'll make it out.
Listen to me.
The main thing is to get our stories right.
It's like this.
We were after food, the farm was burnt down, and we came to Lesiny. Got it?
- It's senseless.
- Quit that!
Don't be stupid. Just listen.
We're from Dubovoi's squadron.
The squadron's in the Parkovsky Woods.
Everyone knows that.
Let them try to get in there. There's a whole army there! They'll smoke them!
Listen, we need to think up something.
It's easy to croak.
We need to find a way out!
It's not going to work.
We need to play them like a fish on a line.
If you pull too hard, it will tear and all's lost!
Play it like you're human.
They already offered to take me into the police force.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I said "play."
Kolya -
I wasn't born yesterday either.
How can you?
We're soldiers.
Soldiers.
Don't crawl in shit.
You'll never wash it off.
So then, to the grave - to feed the worms.
Right?
That's not the worst that could happen.
No. That's not what we're talking about.
Now I understand.
I understand.
The important thing is to be true to yourself.
Fool!
You're a fool, Sotnikov.
You graduated from the institute for nothing.
I want to live! To live!
To kill those bastards!
Understand?
I'm the soldier.
And you're a corpse.
All you've got left is your stubbornness - your principles!
Then you go on living - without a conscience.
It can be done.
You're talking to me... about conscience?
And who got this woman... and me - strong and whole - into this mess?
You! A man of conscience.
And in the attic - wounded and sick - why weren't you first to get your hands up?
Your conscience stopped you?
Rybak saved you and the village.
Got that?
My conscience... thinks!
And yours -
- What?
We need to get the job done!
And you - "Conscience, conscience!"
Aren't you hoping for anything?
You're lying. You are hoping.
Like you were hoping back in the field.
And we made it! Precisely!
We need to survive!
By joining the police?
Then don't waste time.
You -
You know what you are?
- Kolya -
- Into the grave!
And you're dragging me in to keep you company!
You're scared to be alone!
You lying scum!
You're scared!
Why, you -
Sotnikov!
Why'd you close your eyes, Sotnikov?
Listen. How about some water?
What are you doing here?
Look how they mangled him.
But I see you were more fortunate.
The battle is still to come.
I know what's still to come.
They won't leave things as they are.
Here's water.
And make sure your bandit is looking good by morning. Got it?
What's in the morning?
Who are you?
Basya.
Aren't you the shoemaker
Meyer's daughter?
Yes.
What do they want from you?
To tell them who hid me.
But you didn't tell, did you?
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared. Come here.
Come along.
Get in, scum!
Why are you pushing?
There are men here!
You'll be here till the morning!
What happens in the morning?
In the morning -
Look who's pushing us around!
Damn bastard!
They didn't put you away long enough for that knife fight!
Should've put you away for life, you scum!
And my Dyomka stood up for him in court. The fool.
My babies.
My poor, sweet babies.
Without me, alone and hungry.
Don't worry. Maybe you'll be fine.
"Fine." Sure.
They've gone mad!
They say the German that got shot croaked.
All those damn scum should croak!
So that's what it is.
And Pavlo - how about that?
An investigator.
Who'd think, a Judas like that!
Who's that - Portnov?
Of course. He's from the farm.
Everyone knows him.
He was traveling all around before the war - giving lectures, and rather well.
I remember him when he was an admirer.
When he came out of the Vitebsk Institute, he became so pompous.
The institute?
Sure. He worked as the club administrator.
And the choir.
Mr. Portnov was our choir director.
I sang two songs there.
"Campfires Burning High."
And "Evening Bells."
And he -
He interrogated you?
Listen.
Didn't you study in Vitebsk?
Maybe you know him.
Maybe he's a classmate.
You could talk to him.
Don't think about it.
So that's why he was asking about you.
"Who is he?" "Who is he?"
Don't think about it.
It's easier for Pavel that way.
That sell-out swine!
We will! We will remember!
We'll remember in our graves!
I waited and waited.
And I was so hungry.
But I was scared
to come out of the bushes.
Then the rains came.
All the leaves fell,
and the bushes turned bare.
I didn't want to eat or even to move.
Once, I opened my eyes and saw Auntie Proskovia.
You mean Suprunikha?
She recognized me.
A good-hearted woman.
So what's it to you?
Whoever it might be... all they want is to get information.
You shouldn't say that.
We'll all die together.
Dear God, forgive me.
Dear God, have mercy on me.
My son.
My son.
Dear God, what's happening?
My son.
Don't leave us. Can you hear me?
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent before all men!
I worked in secret for Dubovoi.
He made me headman.
"You'll help us and save people."
Do you hear?
My son. I'm not the enemy.
Can you hear me?
I'm innocent!
Rybak.
- Rybak!
- What?
Closer!
What is it?
Don't let me die before morning.
Don't let me die.
Kolya, I'll take all the blame.
- What are you saying?
- Don't let me -
- Hang in there!
- Don't let me die.
Water!
Quickly!
- Let me.
- It can't be!
- He's sick.
- Drink some.
Drink a little.
Drink.
Old man... back there, I wanted to -
To kill me?
But you didn't, did you?
Don't torment yourself.
I'll die like a human being now, not like a dog.
Listen.
Brother.
What's happening?
Brother! Brother!
Damn. I thought -
Hang on.
It can't -
What will you tell them?
The main thing is to stay calm.
Don't act proud.
Let me... fall asleep.
What? No, no!
Later. You said -
Don't fall asleep.
Everybody out. Liquidation.
Move it!
Come here, one-legged man!
- Call the investigator.
- Too late for investigation.
Too late?
What do you mean too late?
Hands off!
Call Portnov!
What's so difficult?
Are you human or not?
Bring the investigator over!
Tie up the old man.
Call the investigator!
Tie him up.
Stop it. Stop it, will you?
Investigator!
Tell them! I want to make a statement!
Herr Major, excuse me.
This partisan wants to make some sort of a statement.
Free these people.
They have nothing to do with this.
I'm the partisan!
It was me who was carrying out the squadron's orders!
It was me who killed your German man.
They're all here by accident!
Shoot me alone!
What now?
Do something... for them.
And that's all, citizen lvanov?
No. Not Ivanov.
My name's Sotnikov.
Commander, Red Army.
Born in 1917.
Bolshevik.
Party member since 1935.
Teacher by profession.
At the start of the war,
I commanded a battery.
It's a shame I didn't kill more of you bastards.
My name is Sotnikov - Boris Andreevich.
I have a father, a mother and a motherland.
Herr Major, nothing important.
Mr. Investigator, sir! Just a minute!
You said yesterday -
And I agree! I agree!
I've nothing to do with this, for God's sake!
He'll tell you so!
I agree!
- Kolya!
- I agree!
- Kolya!
Herr Major, excuse me.
This guy's asking to join the police.
Maybe we should keep him, try him out.
You agree to join the police?
I agree.
Then untie him.
You're letting him go?
Then let me go too!
I'll tell!
I'll tell who was hiding her!
I've got babies!
Dear God, what'll they do?
Then tell me.
- It was -
- Think what you're doing.
So, who was it? Tell me. Tell me.
Well?
It was Fyodor Burak, I think.
What, Burak?
He's not here anymore.
Think a little harder.
Speak up!
I told you already.
- Gamanyuk.
- I've told you!
Shut your mouth!
Hold on to her.
Help him.
Get moving!
Move it!
Don't struggle!
Keep walking!
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
I'll escape.
The chief's not happy.
Not enough people.
No! No!
Have mercy!
I have small children!
Have mercy on a poor old woman!
Have mercy!
Bastards.
Get up, woman.
Think about what you're doing.
Come to your senses.
Forgive me.
Don't just stand there.
I'll do it on my own.
Hold it steady.
No. No.
You did a good job.
Take this.
Quite the able fellow.
WE'RE PARTISANS
WHO SHOT GERMAN SOLDIERS
- Listen.
- What?
How about giving my belt back.
Here.
You did that well.
Hung him like a rabbit.
Who?
Me?
What's with you? Keep up!
Judas.
Judas.
Move along.
What are you staring at?
What's with you?
Move it.
Come along. Come along.
Hey, take the bench.
Come see me later.
Yes, sir.
Not "Yes, sir", but "Jawohl."
Get used to it.
I'm hungry.
- Where's that jerk?
- In the outhouse.
Hey you!
Hey, you jerk!
Get out of there.
The boss is waiting.
You going to be long?

(Man) It is the opportunity[br]of a lifetime, Admiral Canaris.
A wonderful chance to show[br]what the Abwehr is capable of.
Wouldn't you agree,[br]Reichsführer Himmler?
After the miracle you have effected[br]in rescuing Il Duce, anything is possible.
Our own glorious[br]Sturmbannführer Skorzeny merely shares your instinct for daring.
We cannot expect less from section[br]three of our beloved Abwehr. We will not.
Well, our Führer was in rare form today,[br]I must say.
Do you really think so?
I, for one, thought his proposition[br]to you rather challenging.
So is harpooning a whale[br]with a sewing needle.
May I remind you that only yesterday
Il Duce was surrounded[br]by his own troops on Gran Sasso - a virtual prisoner -[br]and today he is our honoured guest.
Oh, yes, a daring raid[br]faultlessly executed.
Congratulate your Sturmbannführer,[br]Skorzeny.
Coming from another man of daring,[br]such as yourself, Herr Admiral,
- I'm sure it will be doubly appreciated.[br]- This, erm... new plan of our Führer's.
This... This pipe dream.
It is exactly that, you know.
I would have thought a feasibility study[br]at the very least was in order.
Surely the Abwehr can handle that?
If it had been proposed to your SS...
The SS was created to lead, Herr Admiral, to be the very soul[br]and conscience of the Reich.
And since national victory[br]is now inevitable,
I would advise us all to look[br]to our own... personal victory as well.
Heil Hitler.
- Morning.[br]- Good morning, Herr Admiral.
Oberst Radl - send him to me at once.
I've notified Oberst Radl of your arrival.
Thank you.
Come in, Radl.
- Herr Admiral.[br]- Come and sit down.
Your meeting went well? The Führer[br]had something specific in mind?
A simple exercise in logistics.
Nothing very complicated.
He merely wants Winston Churchill[br]brought from London to Berlin.
And we are ordered[br]to make a feasibility study.
Today is Wednesday.[br]By Friday, he will forget it.
But Himmler will not.
Reichsführer Himmler approved?
Only of my being put on the spot.
That meeting![br]You should have seen it, Radl.
There was Hitler -[br]first ranting, then cajoling.
And then perfectly rational.
Then raging and stamping like a...
Like the ringmaster of some freak circus.
Goebbels, hopping from one foot[br]to another like a... like a schoolboy.
Bormann - a vulture... perched in the corner -[br]watching, listening, never speaking.
And Mussolini... Mussolini!
An automaton, Radl.
And I looked round that room,[br]and I wondered... am I the only one who can see it?
And if so, what must I look like to them?
Herr Admiral, the feasibility study...
Will be a total[br]and unnecessary waste of time.
Make it immediately.
Why not put a bullet through your head,[br]it's quicker.
And others need the brandy.
You had an appointment[br]for an examination this morning at ten.
You had another two weeks ago[br]and another two weeks before that.
The Admiral and I were discussing[br]a special project for our Führer.
In spite of your skills as a doctor,
I believe my health was better[br]served by keeping that appointment.
You didn't chain-smoke to remind me[br]what a stubborn ass you are, Max.
You'll be flicking your own ashes[br]on my grave soon enough.
Not if you stop[br]this idiotic self-destruction.
And die in May as opposed to October?
If I am to die, let me die in peace, hm?
Heil Hitler.
Complete for the last month.
If Herr Oberst could give me[br]a rough idea of our problem...?
I can be quite specific about it.
The Führer has instructed us[br]to kidnap Winston Churchill.
Good God!
Well, Karl,[br]do at least a feasibility study on it.
Something which might[br]fit our needs came in yesterday.
Just a mention,[br]as far as I remember. If I may, sir?
Here it is. From codename Starling.
A village in England[br]called Studley Constable.
How do we receive reports[br]from this Starling?
From the Spanish Embassy in London[br]by diplomatic pouch, also by radio.
Exactly where is Studley Constable?
The east coast of England.[br]Er... county of Norfolk.
Let's have a look at the place.
- Larger scale.[br]- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
Ah... here.
Ah, Herr Oberst.
Isolated coastline, very rural,[br]wide beaches, salt marshes.
Ideal.
Now, a man to lead it, Karl.
Crash-landed, 1940 - glider assault.
Albert Canal, Belgium,[br]dropped into Crete, '41...
Wounded taking Máleme airfield...[br]Knight's Cross.
Led volunteer assault group of 300,[br]special action, Leningrad.
Stalingrad Knight's Cross[br]with oak leaves and swords.
January this year, dropped into Kiev[br]with 167 surviving in unit, to get two cut-off regiments[br]out of Russia.
- Oberst Kurt Steiner.[br]- And has the language?
Educated in England.
Third time in the last month, despite Göring's personal guarantee.
Are you familiar[br]with the works of Jung, Karl?
I am aware of the works of Jung,[br]not familiar, Herr Oberst.
A very great thinker. A rational man.
And yet he speaks of something[br]called synchronicity - events having a coincidence in time, creating the feeling[br]that a deeper motivation is involved.
- Ja, I understand that, sir.[br]- Take this affair.
The Führer makes the absurd suggestion that we emulate Skorzeny[br]by abducting Churchill.
We have to make a worthless[br]report on the prospects.
Suddenly, synchronicity[br]rears its disturbing head.
- Ja. I see that.[br]- We receive a routine report with a brief notation that next month,[br]after visiting a local bomber command,
Churchill will spend[br]a weekend in a country manor less than seven miles[br]from a deserted coastline.
At any other time,[br]this report would mean nothing.
At this particular time, and in that particular file...
...it becomes a circumstance[br]which titillates.
A coincidence to... tease us.
Surely Herr Oberst[br]doesn't believe it can be carried off.
A wink from a pretty girl[br]at a party results rarely in climax... but a man is a fool not to push[br]a suggestion as far as it will go.
Find this man.[br]He's been out of Germany too long.
Los, los, weiter. Schnell!
Los, los!
Hans...
Hans!
Let's stretch our legs.
Los, weiter!
Stay on the train.
No one allowed off the train.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Sir, you must remain on the train.
If memory serves me,[br]the Polish army surrendered in 1939.
- Sir?[br]- Who are these people?
- Oh, Jews, sir.[br]- Jews?
We are razing the ghetto to the ground.[br]Burning them out. They put up a fight.
Oh, how? With umbrellas and crutches?
Halt! Halt!
- I'll take the prisoner now.[br]- Prisoner?
What is...
- What is your name?[br]- Brana.
Good luck, Brana.
Identify yourself.
Oberst Kurt Steiner.
Commanding[br]the 12th Parachute Detachment.
A salute is customary[br]to a general, Herr Oberst.
Even to one of SS.
You didn't seem quite so[br]discriminating a moment ago.
I have nothing[br]for or against Jews, personally.
But I've seen too many[br]good men die for cause, to watch a girl be killed for sport!
Straub was doing his duty...
He's like something I might pick[br]up on my shoe in the gutter - very unpleasant on a hot day!
If you have the dubious honour[br]of commanding this slaughter,
I'd advise you to keep him[br]downwind at all times.
That is, if you can tell the difference.
For God's sake, Kurt.
What am I to do with you, Herr Oberst?
You're a military hero, awarded the Knight's Cross for gallantry.
Yet responsible for the attempted escape[br]of an enemy of the state, abetted by the mutinous conduct[br]of your men.
By rights, you should all[br]be court-martialled.
Difficult decisions are the privilege[br]of rank, Herr Gruppenführer.
But, as for my men... they seem to feel a certain loyalty to me.
I, er... don't suppose you could[br]content yourself with my head and overlook their part in this thing?
Huh?
There you are, you see, Hans?
It's infallible.
I can always tell[br]a thoroughgoing bastard when I see one.
- Herr Oberst?[br]- (Radl) In here, Karl.
- Good morning.[br]- Good morning, Herr Oberst.
The material arrived from Starling.[br]It is truly excellent.
Starling is to be commended.
Ja. Ja, this is good.
What news of Oberst Steiner?
We're having difficulty[br]tracing him, Herr Oberst.
He's in Germany, but as to exactly where,[br]we've hit a roadblock, you know?
Even rumours of a court martial,[br]but we'll find him.
I'm sure. And now...
Here... a possible undercover operative.
I have decided on this man.[br]He's lecturing here in Berlin.
Send for him immediately.
- Yes.[br]- Oh, and Karl.
Send this message to Starling.
Yes, Herr Oberst.
- Where is Herr Oberst?[br]- In the map room, Herr Admiral.
This message has been sent out.[br]Did you originate it?
I did, Herr Admiral.
"Very interested[br]in your visitor of 6th November.
"Would like to drop some friends in[br]to persuade him to come back with them.
"Your comments expected by usual[br]route with all relevant information."
You've exceeded your authority.
You were told to prepare this feasibility[br]study, not embellish a joke.
With your permission,[br]it is no longer a joke. It could be done.
In my opinion, it should be done.
What if Churchill prefers to die?
What if abduction[br]becomes assassination?
No one specified dead or alive.
God in heaven!
Kill Churchill[br]when we've already lost the war?
I'm sure you've done a good job,[br]very thorough.
But this operation could make[br]the Charge of the Light Brigade look like a sensible military exercise.
Drop it.
Herr Oberst?
He has arrived.
(Irish accent) Come in,[br]Colonel... Radl, isn't it?
The top o' the morning to you.
It's not Irish whiskey,[br]but it'll do to be going on with.
Better for you to drink than me.
I have the feeling[br]I might be needing it. May I?
Ja.
The last time I was invited[br]up here to Section Three someone persuaded me[br]to jump out of a Dornier.
5,000 feet above Ireland, in the dark, and me with this terrible fear of heights!
You're planning a holiday to England,[br]are you?
They say that Brighton's[br]lovely this time of year.
- W-What the Christ is that?[br]- They're Russian.
I took to them in the Winter War.
They're probably all that[br]kept you awake in the snow.
Here... and here.
Now...
- I had a proposition for you, Mr Devlin.[br]- You had?
Have.
- I'm working, you know, Colonel.[br]- At the university.
For a man like you,[br]that's like a thoroughbred racing horse... finding himself...
- pulling a milk cart.[br]- You've got a way with words, Colonel.
You want me to go back to Ireland?
Well, I can't. They'd arrest me...
No, no. We don't want you to go back.
No. You're still a supporter[br]of the Irish Republican Army?
Soldier of, Colonel. Once in, never out.
But you're here in Germany[br]and not England, why?
I don't like soft target hits.
I don't want to live in Bayswater, mixing up explosives[br]in my landlady's saucepan to blow up a couple of passers-by.
My fight is with[br]the bloody British Empire and I'll fight it on my own two feet.
If it's some rabid fanatic you're after,[br]I'm the wrong man.
Am I right to assume your aim[br]is total victory against England?
No, that's your aim.[br]My aim is a united Ireland.
I appreciate the distinction[br]but Germany must win the war first.
Pigs might fly one day but I doubt it.
Mr Devlin.
- I want you to go to England for me.[br]- I barely know you.
To assist in the kidnapping[br]and safe return to Germany... of Winston Churchill.
Give me another Bolshevik[br]firecracker, will you?
I think I fell asleep in the snow.
- (Knock on door)[br]- Herr Oberst.
Good evening, Herr Oberst.
I am Sturmführer Toberg of the SS.
Reichsführer Himmler[br]presents his compliments and requests you to bring[br]the plan designated "Eagle".
When is that to be?
Now, Herr Oberst.
You seem nervous, Herr Oberst.
Please relax. Sit down.
May I smoke, Herr Reichsführer?
No.
A masterful job.
Thank you, Herr Reichsführer.
But, you know, some people[br]would say that such an operation could make[br]the Charge of the Light Brigade look like a sensible military exercise.
Have you heard that phrase before,[br]Herr Oberst?
I don't immediately recall,[br]Herr Reichsführer.
I know all about your plan.
I know what is written[br]on every single page.
Even the one you haven't got yet!
The court martial[br]of Herr Oberst Steiner and his men.
The arrogance of this Steiner is dazzling.
An unusual man this... er, this Steiner.
Intelligent, ruthless, a brilliant soldier... but above all, a romantic fool.
He threw away everything - rank, career... the future.
He is presently serving[br]in a penal colony on the island of... er... AIderney.
(Scoffs) All because[br]of some little Jewess whom he'd never[br]clapped eyes on before!
You know he's a veteran of[br]five successful commando raids?
Six, I believe.
Educated in England.
Speaks the language perfectly,[br]without an accent.
The ideal man for the job,[br]eh, Herr Oberst?
- If you think so, Herr Reichsführer.[br]- And so do you.
But the Herr Admiral Canaris[br]doesn't think so.
My loyalty to Herr Admiral...
Is exceeded only by your loyalty[br]to the Führer himself. Isn't that so?
I was sure of it.
Now, this Churchill business...
Our Führer wants it seen through.
You have considerable autonomy[br]in running your office.
You ought to be able to use it as an excuse to prevent Canaris[br]from knowing what's going on.
What kind of authority would I have to carry such a project through,[br]Herr Reichsführer?
Aloud, if you please.
"Herr Oberst Radl is acting[br]under my personal orders
"in a matter of the utmost[br]importance to the Reich.
"All personnel, military and civil,
"without distinction of rank,[br]will assist him in any way
"that Oberst Radl sees fit to demand.
"Adolf Hitler."
So you see, Radl, under the terms of that document, even I find myself[br]under your personal command.
Good luck.
I can only envy your inevitable[br]success in the matter.
- Heil Hitler.[br]- Heil Hitler.
Major Neuhoff, Commandant[br]of the island of Alderney.
- A distinct pleasure, Herr Oberst.[br]- Read this, please.
I see, Herr Oberst. What is your wish?
Terminate the penal unit here.
That applies to Steiner,[br]von Neustadt and the 29 men.
18, Herr Oberst. There are only 18 now.
The men are required to ride the[br]larger torpedo craft into enemy shipping.
- The torpedoes detach, of course?[br]- Of course.
- Most of the time.[br]- Burial detail, the usual letters of commendation.[br]And get the names right this time.
- Thank you, Herr Major.[br]- But...
Thank you, Herr Major.
- Herr Steiner?[br]- Yes, I'm Steiner. What is it?
My name is Radl.
Well, what is it? I have two men to bury[br]and no office to make small talk in.
Your credentials are hopelessly[br]impeccable, Herr Oberst.
What can I do for you?
Lead a raiding party to England[br]to kidnap Winston Churchill.
You don't seem impressed.
I haven't seen your plan yet.
Here.
While he's making his decision,
I'll go to that pub and think about mine.
The only time this plan makes[br]any sense to me is when I'm drunk.
- You are in command here?[br]- Oberleutnant Koenig, Herr Oberst.
These configurations[br]seem somewhat abnormal for an E-boat.
That's because she's a converted[br]British MTB, Herr Oberst.
Captured making a drop[br]off the Dutch coast.
- Morning.[br]- Sir.
You're familiar[br]with the east coast of England?
For five years I was First Mate[br]on a cargo ship out of England.
This could work, you know?
It will. It is a direct order[br]from the Führer himself.
I stood opposite Adolf once.
When he gave me this.
Oh, I forgot. One of those.
You're an officer.[br]You swore an oath, you have no choice.
Of course I do.
I'm going to die here anyway... eventually.
You forget, Radl, that I'm under[br]suspended sentence of death.
Officially disgraced.
I do not retain my rank... only my authority, because of the, er... peculiar circumstances of this job.
I offer you a chance[br]for reinstatement of rank and vindication for you and your men.
My men need no vindication.
- You said it could be done.[br]- It's possible.
Of all the world's leaders,
Churchill is probably the least protected, unlike the Führer.
Steiner, is thumbing[br]your nose at the Führer more important to you[br]than the lives of your men?
31 of you a few weeks ago.
How many are left?
Sixteen.
You owe them this last chance to live.
Or to die in England instead.
I will put it to my men.
They are entitled to know.
Only the destination for now - revealing[br]the target would be going too far.
I will put it to my men.
Steiner.
It may not win the war, but it would make them think[br]about negotiated peace. Hm?
A negotiated peace?
I will put that to my men also.
God bless all here.
- Give us a glass of your strongest.[br]- Gestapo.
So that's how the Gestapo dress[br]in Berlin these days?
- Gestapo?[br]- Drink?
I haven't sucked my thumb in years.
I wonder if you'd do it for me?
- Sir?[br]- Suck it.
Now, about your Mr... er, Devlin.
A man of considerable resource[br]and guile, I assure you.
Tell me something, Mr Devlin.[br]Just why are you coming along?
Can't you tell? I'm the last[br]of the world's great adventurers.
Sweet Mary, Mother of God.
Tough bunch of lads in there, Colonel!
What did he say?
Steiner insisted on[br]the unanimous consent of his men.
I'm not surprised.
If they agree, you'll leave tonight[br]for Southern Ireland.
- Close to the Ulster border.[br]- Tonight? What about my papers?
Your Irish passport and British[br]medical discharge have been provided.
Starling's found you a job.
You'll be a... marsh warden,[br]whatever that is.
It's a marsh warden.[br]What about the money?
- £10,000 first...[br]- No, I asked for £20,000.
10,000 has been deposited[br]in Geneva as per instructions.
Ten more[br]upon completion of the mission.
You think I'd sell out?
You've been so expensive[br]to buy in the first place.
You are going to jump in those clothes?
I might look a little bit silly[br]going down, Mr Steiner, but I'll be a lot safer[br]when I land on the ground.
There's an old poem which,[br]translated from the Irish, says,
"I realised fear one morning
"To the blare[br]of the fox hunters' sound
"When they're all chasing after[br]the poor bloody fox
"It's safer to be dressed like the hound"
You're quite literary.
If the truth be known, Colonel,[br]I'm a bloody literary genius.
- Your complete instructions.[br]- Right.
All of it - everything? No cyanide pill?
I couldn't conceive of a situation[br]which would force you to take one.
It's a little trick I learned[br]from my uncle in Belfast.
In the Middle Ages they would[br]have burned you for that.
Goodbye, Mr Devlin.[br]I will see you in England.
I'll be there.
- How do I jump out?[br]- Release your safety belt.
I turn the aircraft upside-down,[br]you drop out.
Has it occurred to you that[br]the signature on your authorisation could just be a forgery?
Why not fly to Berchtesgaden[br]and ask him yourself?
Let's not bother the man.
Mrs Joanna Grey?
- That's right.[br]- Liam Devlin.
I could do with a cup of tea.[br]It's been a hell of a journey.
Come inside.
That's a neat trick.
We're both Irish, your wolfhound and me.
- What's her name?[br]- Patch.
Oh, Patch, is it?
Sit down, Mr Devlin.
It's lovely, the countryside, isn't it?
You'd hardly know there was[br]a war on. Patch!
(Joanna) They're living[br]in a fool's paradise.
They lack the discipline[br]the Führer has brought to Germany.
These are papers you'll need.
I'll give you the ones they gave to me.
You know Sir Henry[br]is away for some time and only the servants[br]are in the manor house?
Does anyone else know[br]Churchill will be here?
Only Father Verecker.
Your duties, in the main,[br]will be merely gamekeeping.
You've got a motorbike parked outside[br]and you can have this shotgun.
It is loaded.
- You know the way to the cottage?[br]- Down the road, the pub's on the right, and I go through the manor house gates,[br]to the end of the lane.
Here's the keys.[br]Oh, petrol for the motorbike - the ration allowance is only[br]three gallons a month.
I hope I won't be here that long,[br]Mrs Grey.
They sent you over rather late.[br]Churchill arrives the day after tomorrow.
Colonel Radl sends his apologies,[br]there was nothing he could do about it.
This should be more than enough[br]for the vehicles we need.
I assume your contacts are reliable?
You take after me.
By the way, I would advise you[br]not to use stolen commercial petrol.
It contains a red dye...
Which comes out if you put it[br]through a gas mask. May I?
Oh, by all means.
To the English Enterprise.
I think you and I will get along famously.
On the contrary, Mr Devlin.
The success of the mission depends[br]entirely on the distance we keep.
(Man) Morning.
Walk on.
Good day to you, cailín.
- God save the good work.[br]- Oh, watch your back!
- My back?![br]- Mr Devlin.
Mr Devlin, is it?
Mrs Grey told us about you[br]at the last WVS meeting.
You're the new marsh warden.
And you're with[br]the Women's Voluntary Service.
I help out.
When I have the time.
Sort of erm... servicing the troops, is it?
I don't mind.
Miss, I do believe you're[br]a little bit of a tease.
Children tease, Mr Devlin,[br]and I am almost 19.
Go on. Go on.
God bless all here.
Can I have a glass[br]of your strongest, please?
- I'm George Wilde, the publican.[br]- Liam Devlin, marsh warden.
That's Arthur Seymour[br]and over by the fire, Laker Armsby.
Will you join me in a drink?
- A pint of bitter.[br]- Pint of bitter. Sir?
I buys me own.
Coming in here[br]with your shotgun and motorbike, buying drinks for us estate workers[br]who content themselves with less.
It can only be because of my good looks.
Make fun of me[br]and I'll squash you like a slug.
Arthur!
You walk soft around here.[br]You keep your place... and stay away from Molly Prior.
If I've caused any offence, I'm sorry.
Arthur, get out!
Today I leave, boy, but from now on,[br]when you see me, you leave.
One and nine, please.
- Good day, Father.[br]- Oh, good afternoon.
Liam Devlin - I'm Sir Henry's[br]new marsh warden.
- I'm just introducing myself around.[br]- I'm Father Verecker.
This is my sister Pamela, she's up[br]from Mildenhall on a weekend's leave.
- Your sister? How do you do?[br]- How do you do?
I'll be back for tea, Father.
- Goodbye, Mr Devlin.[br]- Goodbye.
We have a small[br]if loyal congregation here, Mr Devlin.
I look forward to your adding to it.
- You are Catholic?[br]- Oh, yes, Father.
- Did you come for confession?[br]- Oh, with apologies, Father, this poor soul is well past redemption.
God forgive me, but this confessional[br]could do with a few spicy revelations.
Don't forget the words of our Lord,[br]Mr Devlin - "The last shall be first."
In that case, I'm assured a place[br]at the head of the line.
(Steiner) Where did you find this?
(Radl) A DC3, captured almost intact.
- Gericke.[br]- Herr Oberst.
- Will it be ready in time?[br]- No problem.
Where did she go? Eh?
All right, my friend.
(Molly) What kept you?
"What kept me," is it?[br]Why, you little devil!
My God, and I'll know you till[br]Doomsday, that's for sure.
- What does that mean?[br]- It's an expression from where I come.
- You use these?[br]- No.
Good for you. They stunt your growth.
You with your green years[br]still ahead of you.
Almost 19, eh?
- What month?[br]- February.
- 25th?[br]- 22nd.
But I was right, you're a little fish.
We should get along well -[br]me being a Scorpio.
Never marry a Virgo.
Virgo and Pisces never hit it off.
Take Arthur, for example.
I think he's Virgo, watch it with him.
Arthur? Arthur Seymour? Are you crazy?
No, but I think he is.
Pure, clean, virtuous... and not very hot - that's a Virgo.
Ah, it's a terrible shame[br]from where I'm lying.
You'll have a weight problem[br]if you don't watch your food.
Bastard!
Are you laughing at me?
What else would you have me[br]do with you, Molly Prior?
Don't answer that.
How do you know my name?
George Wilde told me at the pub.
Oh, I see!
- And Arthur, was he there?[br]- You could say that.
I get the feeling that he looks upon you[br]as his personal property.
He can go to hell - I belong to no man.
Your nose turns up.
And when you get angry,[br]your mouth turns down at the corners.
I'm sure you could find a hundred things[br]wrong with me... a thousand!
But you wouldn't throw me[br]out of your bed on a wet Saturday night.
That's men for you -[br]anything's better than nothing.
Wait! Come here!
You don't know the first thing about me.
Because if you did,[br]you'd know that I much prefer a warm autumn afternoon[br]under the pines... to a wet Saturday night, any day.
The sand has a terrible way[br]of getting where it shouldn't be.
Get out of here, before I let[br]my mad passion run away with me.
Go on, get! Get!
They told me all Irishmen were crazy... now I believe them.
- I'll be at Mass on Sunday, will you?[br]- Do I look like I will?
Yes. I think you do.
Oh, Devlin, you bloody idiot.
You never learn.
Never bloody learn.
It is out there, Hans.
160 miles west.
We've been on tough ones before.
The kidnapping[br]of the British prime minister.
If successful, will be a shot in the arm[br]for German morale.
But I agree. It won't stop the bombers[br]from making their daily runs.
The men considered that[br]before they agreed to go.
The men, as I once remarked[br]to a certain Gruppenführer in Poland, feel a loyalty to me.
Which, God help me,[br]I may merely be taking advantage of.
You tell me, Hans.[br]Is it a legitimate mission or have I simply agreed[br]to an elaborate way of killing myself and taking all of you with me?
There is Radl's point -[br]of a negotiated peace.
Hm, a negotiated peace.
I laughed when he said that.
But supposing he's right, hm?
But then negotiated on behalf of whom?
On behalf of the men who lead us or on behalf of Germany as a whole,[br]as she will be one day?
The Gruppenführer from Poland will be[br]part of the Germany she will be one day.
So, by God, will we.
Mother of God.
Look at that now.
- What kept you?[br]- Very clever.
After I came back to make sure[br]you put the pie in the oven.
- But then I suppose you've eaten.[br]- Just get the pie into the oven.
That's better.
- What's this?[br]- Trinity College, Dublin.
- Football?[br]- Art and literature.
- What are you reading?[br]- Some poetry.
- Read it.[br]- "Read it", is it?
- It's a foreign language.[br]- Irish, the language of the kings.
It's very beautiful.[br]Liam - is that Irish too?
- Yes.[br]- What does it mean?
- William.[br]- No, I think I prefer Liam.
- William is so ordinary.[br]- Jesus, Joseph and Mary heed me.
- What does that mean?[br]- It means that if you don't get the pie,
I won't be responsible.
Oh, I do like you, do you know that?
From the first moment I saw you,[br]Mr Devlin, sitting astride your bike.
The pie.
- Pie's not ready yet.[br]- How did you get it here?
- This morning.[br]- Oh.
- Read.[br]- "Read", is it?
Give me that book over there,[br]the blue one.
Sit down.
I'll read you the end of this.
"And then I asked him[br]with my eyes to ask again yes
"and then he asked me would I yes
"to say yes my mountain flower
"and first I put my arms around him yes
"and drew him down to me so he could[br]feel my breasts all perfume yes
"and his heart was going like mad
"and yes I said yes I will Yes."
- Is that Irish too?[br]- Yes.
Himmler sends personal wishes[br]for success from the Führer himself.
You've altered the parachutes. Why?
Unfortunately, we have high tide[br]at first light when we must drop.
So we may land in the surf.
These slots enable us to guide the chute.
It's experimental and the landing[br]velocity is high, but we have no choice.
I assume they've been tested.
Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
I have one request.
A demand, actually.
Blackmail at this point, hm?
We are not spies and will not be treated[br]as such by the British if anything goes wrong.
We will wear our own uniforms[br]under the Polish outfits and if necessary, we will fight[br]and die as what we are -
German paratroopers.
Max, it is not a subject for negotiation.
- In that case, agreed.[br]- Thank you.
Hello, Liam.
My compliments on the dress.
It's a great improvement.
Why pick on me?
Because you're lovely, because[br]you could never fall in love with me.
But I might... just for spite.
It wouldn't matter -[br]I could never fall in love with you.
I'm bad for you, we've no future.
I'm not telling you that[br]to make you want me more. It's the truth.
I'm here - your turn to leave.
(Sighs) Oh, God.
Arthur, did I ever tell you[br]about the uncle I've got in Belfast?
Of course I didn't.
He was a bare-knuckle boxer.
I'm just telling him about the Holy Trinity.
You know it?
Footwork, timing and hitting.
And a little bit of dirty work.
"Learn these," my uncle would say.
"You'll inherit the earth like the meek."
You never know when to lie down.
Liam!
Well, Arthur, looks like[br]he bought you a drink after all!
I told you not to come here tonight.
I wanted you to come home[br]to a proper fire.
When I went to the wood bin[br]I found those.
Now put it back, there's a good girl.
What is it?
What does it mean?
Molly, my own sweetheart,[br]I love you dearly, but any more games like this and I'll give you[br]the thrashing of your life.
Size ten. Was I right?
Silk stockings.
Real silk.
Where did you get these?
You can get anything...[br]if you know where to look.
Black market.
That's what it is.
Why can't you be nice and normal?
Would you have me in my grave[br]so early?
Now go get the tea.
Or do you want to report me[br]to the police?
Oh, Liam.
It's perfect...
- but which way is England?[br]- (Laughs)
You. Tell Oberst Radl who you are.
Kapral Andrzej Jankowski.
You.
Kapral Stanislav Kunicki,[br]as you very well know.
Get back in line.
I'm very much impressed.
You know, it all started as a joke,[br]an insane joke.
I hope that Winston Churchill[br]appreciates our sense of humour.
- Good luck, Steiner.[br]- Thank you, Max.
(Gericke) 'Falcon, this is Eagle.[br]Are you receiving me? '
Eagle this is Falcon, receiving you.
'What are conditions over the nest? '
Visibility good, cloud cover low,[br]wind freshening.
'Eagle out.'
Well... what do you think his game is?
Black market... or worse?
There's two army trucks outside[br]without numbers on... yet.
This... German.
It's worse!
Arthur, if you love me,[br]don't breathe a word until...
I'll have that bastard[br]arrested within the hour.
I've never meant to tease you.[br]I know I have, but I never meant to.
- You lying tart.[br]- I love him, Arthur.
What you do to him, you do to me.
You can both rot in hell.
Stop, Arthur!
I won't let you go!
{2261}{2355}When the time came for|my poor mama to be born...
{2357}{2442}my grandmother Anna Bronski...
{2444}{2505}who was still young|and unsuspecting...
{2505}{2618}was sitting in her four skirts|at the edge of a potato field.
{2620}{2705}That was in 1899...
{2707}{2777}in the heart of Kashubia.
{3438}{3467}Please!
{4433}{4464}He's gone.
{4466}{4508}Anybody come this way?
{4514}{4555}Name of Koljaiczek?
{4557}{4648}- A firebug.|- Short with broad shoulders.
{4649}{4737}I seen him! Running like|a bat out of hell!
{4741}{4772}Which way?
{4952}{4999}I don't believe it.
{5248}{5332}- Doesn't matter. He's gone.|- Must be in Bissau.
{5334}{5389}If he's not here,|it has to be one or the other.
{5389}{5456}There's no place else.
{5496}{5540}And besides, it's raining.
{6785}{6835}All right, Koljaiczek.
{6842}{6887}My name is Joseph.
{7721}{7835}Joseph and Anna hid|with the raftsmen...
{7835}{7898}for almost a year.
{7901}{8038}That's how long|it took the police to catch up...
{8039}{8082}with my grandfather.
{8370}{8413}Don't shoot!
{8512}{8588}- Don't shoot him!|- Fire at will!
{8831}{8890}After that dive...
{8894}{8977}Koljaiczek was never seen again.
{8995}{9074}Some say he was drowned...
{9092}{9119}some that he...
{9120}{9172}escaped to America...
{9174}{9278}and in Chicago,|under the name of Joe Colchic...
{9279}{9337}became a millionaire.
{9356}{9442}They say he made his pile in lumber...
{9449}{9528}in matches...
{9540}{9645}and in fire insurance.
{9937}{9993}As for my grandmother...
{10003}{10104}she sat year after year|in her four skirts...
{10106}{10177}hawking her wares in the market.
{10226}{10275}Geese!
{10276}{10340}Not too fat and not too lean!
{10341}{10398}And she grew older.
{10428}{10477}The First World War came...
{10478}{10573}and instead of geese...
{10609}{10649}she had only|turnips to sell.
{10892}{10962}Turnips!
{10997}{11064}My poor mother grew older too.
{11075}{11164}She was worried|about her cousin Jan.
{11190}{11246}Jan had been called up for duty.
{11316}{11375}- Name!|- Bronski, Jan.
{11376}{11439}- Year?.|- 1898.
{11454}{11479}Cough.
{11616}{11656}Rejected!
{11746}{11823}They've turned me down|for another year!
{11877}{11930}For the first time, my mother...
{11932}{12010}held her cousin Jan in her arms...
{12035}{12050}and I doubt...
{12051}{12161}if they ever embranced|more happily.
{12331}{12424}Sister Agnes, is there too much paprika?|Or does it need more clove?
{12640}{12674}What did she say?
{12692}{12786}She says you're a born cook,|Mr. Matzerath.
{12787}{12854}You know how to turn|feelings into soup.
{13277}{13373}The war had spent itself.
{13375}{13449}Danzig was declared a Free State.
{13453}{13488}The poles were given...
{13490}{13531}their own post office...
{13531}{13611}where Jan Bronski went to work.
{13616}{13690}Alfred Matzerath also|stayed in Danzig.
{13768}{13852}We Kashubians|have always been here.
{13866}{13910}Long before the Poles...
{13918}{13977}and naturally|long before the Germans.
{13978}{14042}Old stuff, Jan.|Now we've got peace!
{14045}{14094}Germans, Poles, Kashubians--
{14095}{14138}we'll all live together in peace.
{14233}{14269}I don't know.
{14305}{14346}Well, you'll see.
{14555}{14645}The two men, so different despite|their similar feelings for Mama...
{14648}{14731}liked each other...
{14732}{14839}and in that triunity,|they brought me, Oskar...
{14839}{14886}into the world.
{14937}{15015}The sun was in the sign of Virgo.
{15017}{15116}Neptune moved|into the house of middle life...
{15118}{15212}establishing Oskar|between faith and disillusion.
{15949}{16013}Push, push!
{16102}{16184}Push, Agnes, push!|Push hard!
{16329}{16391}It's coming! It's coming!
{16423}{16482}I first saw the light of this world...
{16483}{16547}in the form of a 60-watt bulb.
{16548}{16636}Alfred, it's a boy!
{16841}{16899}I knew it would be a boy...
{16922}{16996}even if I sometimes said|it would be a girl.
{17204}{17258}Let's see how much he weighs.
{17361}{17429}When he's big,|he'll take over the shop.
{17446}{17519}Now we know what|we're slaving for.
{17526}{17597}When little Oskar is|three years old...
{17599}{17660}he shall have a tin drum.
{17699}{17815}Only the prospect|of the tin drum prevented me...
{17816}{17900}from expressing more|forcefully my desire...
{17901}{17957}to return to the womb.
{17959}{18007}Besides, my umbilical cord|had been cut.
{18008}{18090}There was nothing|more to be done.
{18374}{18483}As it was, I could hardly wait|'til my third birthday.
{19274}{19301}What is it?
{19350}{19406}Oh, it's little Oskar!
{19412}{19462}Do you want some more cake?
{19475}{19550}Your mouth's filthy.
{20092}{20149}Respect the human body. That's--
{20151}{20203}And with rolls at 3 pfennings--
{20237}{20320}The main thing is a stable currency.
{20334}{20394}And plenty to drink!
{20398}{20504}Here's to the stable mark|and the 3-pfenning roll!
{20586}{20636}To youth!
{20637}{20680}And to beauty!
{20855}{20957}We won't be so young|when we meet again!
{21190}{21301}Love, oh love
{21303}{21402}is a power divine!
{22815}{22864}September 12...
{22962}{23006}Next year, you'll be this big!
{23007}{23074}And then, this big! And this.
{23075}{23115}And then as big as me!
{23116}{23140}Gangway!
{23174}{23216}Fresh from the celler!
{23453}{23546}- Playing, Mr. Scheffler?.|- Heavens, no!
{23549}{23612}Go ahead. I'll just watch.
{23616}{23660}Besides, it's my bedtime.
{23661}{23757}- He's always tired.|- You shouldn't have married a baker.
{24084}{24156}It's been a long time since Grandma|took anyone under her skirts.
{24157}{24212}Let's have a little game!
{24788}{24856}Hey, cousin, you're out of diamonds!
{24872}{24943}Don't argue! Play!
{25128}{25165}I have two diamonds myself.
{25168}{25214}How would I now?
{25293}{25335}That day...
{25340}{25407}thinking about the|grown-up world...
{25408}{25503}and my own future...
{25503}{25569}I decided to call a halt...
{25570}{25668}to stop growing then and there...
{25669}{25727}and remain a three-year-old...
{25728}{25785}a gnome, once and for all.
{26693}{26755}One, two, three.
{28131}{28179}God! There he is!
{28186}{28205}What happened?
{28205}{28304}He's fallen down the stairs!
{28310}{28346}Do something!
{28435}{28477}Why was the trap open?
{28477}{28507}He's bleeding!
{28513}{28600}Alfred, it's your fault.|You left the door open!
{28602}{28668}I was only getting beer|for everybody.
{28805}{28858}Run and get the doctor!
{28886}{28985}- It looks bad.|- You! You! It's your fault.
{28986}{29040}You left the trap open!
{29108}{29167}Stop! Stop!
{29333}{29403}Calm down!|What's done is done!
{29811}{29924}Two weeks in bed|and Oskar will be as good as new.
{29994}{30062}Just a slight concussion.
{30071}{30113}Plenty of cold compresses.
{30114}{30201}My fall was a complete success.
{30203}{30292}The family story was:|On his third birthday...
{30294}{30375}our little Oskar|fell down the cellar stairs.
{30377}{30469}No bones were broken,|but after that, he didn't grow--
{30472}{30516}not a single centimeter.
{30578}{30671}That drum again!|So loud!
{30798}{30889}So there's my little Oskar,|all well again.
{31172}{31209}Not in the house, I said!
{31209}{31265}Besides, it's broken.|You'll hurt yourself.
{31267}{31333}- Staying? There are mushrooms.|- Sorry. Post office time.
{31335}{31375}Leave the drum here.
{31377}{31440}If you hurt yourself,|it will be my fault again.
{31471}{31527}See? I told you so.
{31609}{31686}Give me that drum|and I'll give you a candy.
{31702}{31777}Let them have it.|I'll get you a new one.
{31780}{31824}No! Oskar don't want!
{31825}{31866}We'll see about that.
{31872}{31890}Alfred, why must you...
{31891}{31925}always use force?
{31943}{31989}My drum!
{32377}{32556}And so I discovered that my voice|was capable of a scream...
{32558}{32601}so highly pitched...
{32602}{32728}that no one dared|take my drum away...
{32743}{32781}Shards bring luck!
{32793}{32912}because when my drum was|taken away, I screamed...
{32913}{33029}and when I screamed,|valuable articles burst into bits.
{33066}{33142}Where's the witch, black as pitch?
{33410}{33482}Here's the black, wicked witch!
{33647}{33716}There are going to be changes!
{33718}{33788}Scum! Beat it!|I'm coming down!
{34507}{34626}O glorious call of the sun!
{35129}{35181}I'll take this one.
{35254}{35358}if you please,|at this extraordinary potato:
{35370}{35482}this swelling, luxuriant flesh,|forever...
{35483}{35544}conceiving new shapes...
{35550}{35620}and yet so chaste.
{35638}{35684}I love a potato...
{35687}{35732}because it speaks to me.
{35733}{35849}The spuds are|bigger this year than last.
{35862}{35895}What are you doing?
{35930}{35984}Oskar learn to write.
{35989}{36076}Stop that.|You'll never learn to write...
{36078}{36209}and read the great classics,|the eternal truths:
{36210}{36252}''Die unto life!''
{36691}{36760}Hold it.|Now I've got all of you.
{36790}{36823}A bit more to the right, Alex.
{36824}{36886}For you on your first day of school.
{36889}{36930}Eyes this way, please.
{37170}{37249}My name is Spollenhauer,|and I am your teacher.
{37251}{37279}Be seated.
{37312}{37390}And now, dear children,|do any of you know a song?
{37483}{37537}You must be little Oskar.
{37539}{37586}We've heard so much about you!
{37590}{37630}How well you play!
{37631}{37711}Isn't our Oskar a fine drummer?.
{37755}{37822}But now we'll put the drum away.
{37832}{37899}It must be sleepy.
{37927}{38027}After school,|you can have it back again.
{38117}{38169}You're a naughty Oskar.
{38243}{38309}I will now read you the program.
{38316}{38422}Monday: Writing,|Arithmetic, Reading...
{38423}{38458}Religion.
{38460}{38545}All together: Writing!
{38562}{38613}Arith-me-tic!
{38624}{38671}Oskar, stop that!
{38686}{38719}Religion.
{39184}{39217}Get out!
{39322}{39407}Strange!|Very strange!
{39408}{39470}How old is he, did you say?
{39471}{39506}Six, Doctor.
{39507}{39568}Inge, kindly undress Oskar.
{39580}{39668}How long is it since|he fell down the stairs?
{39670}{39732}Three years on September 12.
{39733}{39795}We'd better examine|the spine again.
{39796}{39887}Be a good boy.|I'll give it right back.
{39909}{39971}Oskar, give me your|drum. I'll hold it.
{39973}{40051}See, you can't get|out of your shirt.
{40058}{40161}Oskar, if you're not good,|the doctor won't make you well.
{40162}{40263}Come, child.|Give me your drum!
{40946}{41042}Amazing! Amazing!
{41154}{41206}I shall write a paper...
{41207}{41296}about it for one|of our medical journals...
{41298}{41363}if you have no objection.
{41689}{41781}The destructive force|of this local phenomenon...
{41794}{41875}...is such as to suggest...
{41876}{41993}an anomalous formation|of the lower larynx...
{41995}{42101}in little Oskar Matzerath.
{42103}{42224}Not can we exclude|the hypothesis...
{42226}{42323}of a concomitant development|of the vocal cords.
{42325}{42404}Did you hear that?|In a medical journal!
{42406}{42474}Does the doctor say|why he won't grow?
{42490}{42541}You'll have to ask him that.
{42571}{42614}Why he won't grow.
{42615}{42646}Cut it out!
{42671}{42720}He's yours as much as mine.
{42726}{42755}If not more.
{42757}{42816}Who left the trap open,|you or me?
{43229}{43318}Uncle Hailandt,|come spit in the soup.
{43319}{43416}Look what I found in the pond!|Two frogs!
{43703}{43761}What are you doing,|Tom Thumb?
{44077}{44133}Make Oskar taste the soup!
{44783}{44820}Now it's your turn.
{44822}{44874}You'll love it.
{44891}{44921}A treat!
{44923}{44959}Open your mouth!
{45087}{45131}Good, huh?
{45135}{45202}Just a little more!
{45980}{46071}Labesweg and its backyards|hemmed me in.
{46076}{46199}I longed for space and|took every opportunity...
{46200}{46284}to escape the persecutions|of the soup cooks...
{46285}{46350}by going into town...
{46351}{46432}alone or with Mama.
{47834}{47871}Drum's busted.
{47897}{47961}Want me to mend it?
{48003}{48039}He's getting a new one.
{48302}{48337}Hello, Uncle Jan.
{48804}{48839}Coming?
{48964}{49002}I must leave you now.
{49029}{49084}A few little errands.
{49090}{49126}Good-bye, Agnes.
{49163}{49232}This is for your drum, Oskar.
{49707}{49763}Who do I see?|Oh, Mrs. Matzerath...
{49765}{49823}and little Oskar, for a new drum?
{49835}{49892}Yes, Mr. Markus. Again.
{49893}{49934}He's always at it.
{49935}{50017}I never know what year it|is or what day...
{50018}{50080}except when you come in.
{50082}{50169}Something tells me|it must be Thursday again.
{50194}{50256}You have such beautiful hands.
{50316}{50415}Oskar, see that box?|Hand it to me.
{50441}{50480}That's it.
{50481}{50582}See, Mrs. Matzerath.|Beautiful stockings. Silk!
{50583}{50656}Pure silk. Fine quality!
{50673}{50751}One, two, three pairs.|Take them.
{50752}{50811}They'll suit you fine.|A bargain!
{50812}{50853}Much too dear for me!
{50854}{50927}- They're worth it.|- Maybe later.
{50928}{51007}I'll let them go|for half a gulden.
{51022}{51055}So cheap?
{51085}{51139}No, Markus, that's|driving them away.
{51140}{51207}Take them!|Don't ask questions!
{51213}{51258}And now, Oskar...
{51266}{51328}what would you like?
{51353}{51411}Oh! A new drum we need?
{51415}{51523}Just choose one.|You know where they are!
{51524}{51605}See, Oskar?.|He's so happy!
{51663}{51740}Mr. Markus, could|little Oskar stay...
{51741}{51796}with you for half an hour?.
{51827}{51881}I have some|important business.
{51882}{51956}Yes, yes, I'll watch him|like the apple of my eye.
{51957}{52036}Do your important business|and don't worry.
{52037}{52097}The little prince|will stay with me...
{52115}{52179}while you do your|important business...
{52195}{52245}like every Thursday.
{59683}{59728}We're blocking the street!
{60332}{60438}Danzig has always|been German!
{60485}{60553}If not for the German people...
{60566}{60630}these eastern regions|would have succumbed...
{60659}{60695}to total barbarism...
{61265}{61312}Have a nice walk?
{61519}{61605}The Fuhrer's speaking all over!|Except here!
{62742}{62851}And now, ladies and gentlemen,|the smallest of the small:
{62851}{62925}Bebra and his midgets!
{65992}{66028}My word!
{66068}{66154}Now it's three-year-olds|who choose to stop growing.
{66201}{66251}My name is Bebra.
{66306}{66408}Directly descended|from Prince Eugene...
{66438}{66549}Whose father was Louis XIV...
{66550}{66629}and not some Savoyard,|as has been claimed.
{66649}{66777}I stopped my growth|on my tenth birthday.
{66800}{66887}Better late than never.
{66971}{67017}Tell me, my dear Oskar.
{67019}{67077}How old are you?|Fourteen? Fifteen?
{67078}{67120}Twelve and a half.
{67121}{67206}No! And how old|do you think I am?
{67251}{67298}Thirty-five.
{67327}{67389}Flatterer!
{67455}{67559}I shall be 53 in August.
{67561}{67614}I could be your grandfather.
{67630}{67699}- Are you, too, an artist?|- Not really.
{67700}{67736}Although...
{67996}{68084}as you see, I can lay|claim to a certain artistry.
{68214}{68292}You must join us. You must!
{68306}{68356}Do you know, Mr. Bebra...
{68474}{68516}to tell the truth...
{68524}{68603}I prefer to be a|member of the audience...
{68604}{68703}and let my little art|flower in secret.
{68708}{68752}My dear Oskar!
{68772}{68851}Trust an experienced colleague.
{68853}{68933}Our kind must never|sit in the audience.
{68934}{69015}Our kind must perform|and run the show...
{69017}{69067}or the others will run us.
{69117}{69174}The others are coming.
{69175}{69228}They will occupy the fairgrounds.
{69231}{69321}They will stage torchlight parades,|build rostrums...
{69322}{69361}fill the rostrums...
{69362}{69461}and from those rostrums,|preach our destruction.
{69594}{69690}They're looking for you, dear friend.|We'll meet again.
{69694}{69767}We're too little to|lose each other.
{70485}{70532}They are coming!
{72072}{72132}These damn puttees always slip!
{72192}{72236}I need boots.
{72238}{72279}You know they cost way too much.
{72280}{72332}Or leather gaiters at least.
{72350}{72393}How do I look?
{72435}{72529}- Going to the demonstration?|- Yes, at the fairground.
{72542}{72579}Big show!
{72695}{72755}Gauleiter Lobsack is speaking.
{72783}{72850}And what a speaker!
{72852}{72972}I'm telling you,|these are historic days.
{72979}{73060}A man can't stand aside.|Gotta join in.
{73123}{73197}You should read|the Danzig Sentinel.
{73213}{73264}Crazy your opting for Poland.
{73266}{73338}I've told you 20 times.
{73358}{73394}I'm a Pole.
{73406}{73450}Think it over.
{73468}{73516}Take your umbrella.|It looks like rain.
{73517}{73590}An umbrella with my uniform?
{73633}{73749}The stew is on, Stir it now and then.|Be done in 20 minutes.
{73750}{73786}Bite to eat before you go?
{73787}{73898}No time. Duty is duty|and schnaps is schnaps.
{74289}{74353}National comrades...
{74356}{74439}of Danzig and Langfuhr...
{74446}{74555}of Ohra, Schidlitz|and Praust...
{74567}{74686}from the hills|and from the lowlands...
{74687}{74766}I know you all...
{74767}{74864}cherish but one wish.
{74875}{74943}It has been our heartfelt wish...
{74958}{75055}ever since a shameful diktat...
{75056}{75087}separated us...
{75088}{75173}from our beloved|German fatherland.
{75184}{75294}That wish is: Home to the Reich!
{75532}{75623}What is the meaning|of this Free State...
{75646}{75721}that was so generously|foisted on us?
{75754}{75867}It means that our waterfront...
{75868}{75916}is crawling with Polacks.
{75927}{76001}And in the middle of|our beloved Old City...
{76001}{76094}they've stuck a|Polish post office--
{76095}{76158}something we can do without.
{76282}{76322}We Germans had...
{76329}{76376}post offices...
{76387}{76461}before the Poles...
{76476}{76529}even thought of|writing letters.
{76539}{76605}We taught them the alphabet.
{76649}{76731}And now, dear|national comrades...
{76733}{76805}let us welcome our guest|from the Reich.
{76896}{76970}Party comrade Albert Forster...
{76970}{77081}has just arrived on the field.
{79634}{79753}What's going on?|I want to know what's going on!
{79754}{79799}Block all the exits!
{84317}{84366}Can you catch them|with a clothesline?
{84441}{84504}Real fish or just old shoes?
{84512}{84605}Suppose we take a look?
{84606}{84650}Maybe something's there!
{85116}{85155}The sack!
{85932}{85970}Call that fat?
{86076}{86114}You should have seen them...
{86121}{86180}after the battle of Jutland...
{86184}{86243}when we and the English--
{86408}{86445}See what I mean?
{86451}{86496}After the battle...
{86576}{86675}they were this thick!
{86968}{87025}He wanted one-fifty...
{87031}{87078}but I gave him a gulden.
{87980}{88057}Don't expect me|to touch your eels!
{88058}{88116}Don't put on airs.
{88117}{88186}I'll never eat fist again.|Certainly not eels.
{88187}{88297}You've always eaten them,|and you knew where they came from.
{88319}{88342}Quiet!
{88363}{88423}Stop that drumming!
{88424}{88486}- Leave the child alone!|- And sit down!
{88487}{88547}Who was to blame?|Who left the trap open?
{88563}{88635}Old stuff. Sit down.
{88641}{88717}See if they're not delicious.
{88718}{88778}Come on. Dig in.
{88785}{88870}Fresh eels with dill sauce...
{88879}{88964}a bay leaf and|a twist of lemon peel.
{88965}{89036}Don't make her eat|if she doesn't want to.
{89038}{89095}- keep out of this.|- Leave her alone.
{89095}{89144}She'll only vomit.
{89145}{89242}I paid good money for these|eels. Just try them.
{89258}{89374}They've been well|cleaned and washed.
{89428}{89513}No gall. Light, healthy liver.
{89514}{89557}And so fresh!
{89676}{89725}Oskar! Sit down!
{89780}{89828}For hours I stand at the stove.
{89830}{89904}Some people would be very|happy to eat my eels.
{90607}{90644}I don't know what to do.
{90646}{90685}Alfred, calm down!
{90691}{90773}I can't talk to her.|And the fish is getting cold.
{90774}{90821}Women are more sensitive.
{90837}{90941}You talk to her. if|only she'd calm down.
{93812}{93875}Shouldn't I warm|them up at least?
{94722}{94784}Don't do it with Bronski...
{94805}{94887}who picked the Polish post office.
{94888}{94935}Don't bet on the Poles.
{94940}{95009}If you must bet,|bet on the Germans.
{95018}{95087}Sooner or later,|they'll take over.
{95096}{95181}And then you'll be stuck|with Bronski...
{95182}{95219}that crazy Pole.
{95220}{95300}You'll be in trouble.
{95309}{95389}Why not bet on Matzerath?
{95512}{95618}Or if you'd do me great honor...
{95618}{95654}bet on me...
{95669}{95714}on Sigismund Markus...
{95728}{95769}that was just baptized.
{95770}{95819}No, Markus. Please!
{95820}{95861}We could go to London...
{95863}{95956}like everybody else.
{96058}{96104}Look. There he is!
{96119}{96177}We'll take him with us to London.
{96180}{96256}He'll live like a prince.
{96279}{96353}Thank you, Markus,|but it's impossible.
{96354}{96407}And not because of Bronski.
{96408}{96490}I'm glad to hear that.
{96490}{96529}Steer clear of Bronski...
{96530}{96590}and stick to Matzerath!
{98412}{98513}Come on! Play!
{98535}{98577}One-two, one-two!
{98663}{98703}Can't you...
{98706}{98794}or don't you feel like it, brat?
{98800}{98852}Cause you can do|everything else.
{98855}{98953}I have sinned in thought,|in word and in deed.
{98955}{99008}Alone or with others?
{99009}{99038}With someone else.
{99047}{99088}When and where?
{99100}{99163}Always on Thursday,|in Tischlergasse.
{99164}{99253}But, child!|Why that low neighborhood?
{99255}{99355}I can't help it, Father.|I try, but I can't.
{99356}{99460}But my dear Mrs. Matzerath,|the consequences!
{99479}{99531}I've got them already, Father.

Ladies and gentlemen, a talk
by Monsieur Philippe Henriot
on "History's Revenge."
It's amazing,
listening to Gaullist broadcasts...
how serenely consistent these partisans
of Moscow are in their treachery.
There is no difference
between broadcasts
from London, Algeria, or Brazzaville.
The tone, style and vocabulary
have long been familiar,
each emission bearing
the same distinctive stamp.
The shallow veneer of nationalism
and religion is always evident,
despite their best attempts
to conceal it.
You would hope propaganda
would at least refrain
from constantly insulting
one's common sense.
But never mind.
No one expects logic from them.
Let them go on repeating endlessly
that Laval is a traitor
and Darlan a Gestapo agent,
and that I serve
German propaganda...
What are you doing here?
Are you Lucien, Thérèse's son?
That's not yours!
Those dishes are my father's!
Maybe so.
Go see the boss.
He'll explain.
Is that you, Lucien?
You get up late.
It's Sunday.
Why did you take your father's gun?
You know guns aren't allowed.
Here.
I got a raise of 20 francs.
Good.
- Morning, Lucien.
- Hello, Monsieur Laborit.
Your son could let us know when he's coming.
You staying long?
I have five days off.
What are those other people doing in our house?
They're helping Monsieur Laborit.
I let them have the house.
Things have changed around here.
The work has to be done.
Your father's a prisoner and Joseph's gone.
- Really?
- Joined the underground, the bum!
My son's a patriot... so there!
Lucien, lift his head.
It's coming.
Come on, let's have a drink.
He was a good horse.
I'll never find another like him.
'And the thunder... rolled... in muffled avalanches..."
Well, well.
Come in, Lucien.
"...in the distance."
Maurice, really!
You're hopeless.
You spelled "stormy" starting with S-T-A-U.
But I guess you don't need to know how to spell to herd sheep.
Dismissed!
What do you want?
This is for you.
Thanks.
You came to give me that?
I want to join the underground.
What's that got to do with me?
You're the one who decides.
Joseph told me so.
You're too young.
And we have enough like you.
The underground isn't like poaching.
It's like the army.
I don't want to go back to the nursing home.
You're lucky to have a job.
You can't stay here, Lucien.
Laborit won't let you.
When your father returns...
When he returns, there'll be hell to pay.
Shit!
Are you crazy?
Where'd you come from?
Spying, you little punk?
Get moving. You've got some explaining to do.
- Any news from Paris?
- The phone isn't working.
Kid, come here!
Curiosity is a nasty habit.
Who is he?
I caught him spying in the garden.
I was not.
I was going back to the nursing home.
Don't you know there's a 10:00 curfew?
What's the matter?
Aren't you Henri Aubert, the bicycle champ?
- You've seen me race, kid?
- Yes, in '39, at Caussade.
I was with my father.
You won.
I remember.
You from town?
- No, from Souleillac.
Wait. I know people in Souleillac.
The grocery woman... what's her name?
Madame Cabessut.
That's it.
Dark hair, right?
How about a drink?
Marie, two Suzes.
- So, you're from Souleillac.
- You been there?
Beautiful country.
Very wild.
I bet there's underground there.
You don't see much of them.
And how is Madame Cabessut?
Have another.
And what's this teacher's name?
Peyssac, Robert.
They say he's a Freemason.
What's a Freemason?
You're sure he's in command?
Yes, under another name.
- What name?
- Hold on.
Voltaire.
They call him Lieutenant Voltaire.
Wake up!
Time to get up.
Mademoiselle Chauvelot is on her way.
Oh, my head!
Poor boy.
You drank too much last night.
Want an aspirin?
Good morning, young man.
Forgive me.
There wasn't a room for him.
Very well.
- How are you today?
- Fine, thanks.
I'm almost finished.
- What a beautiful day.
- You mean what heat.
These are for Herr Müller.
They're so polite... and punctual.
If we'd been like them, we'd have won the war.
Darn! I broke a nail.
What did you say, Mama?
I broke a nail.
You've been drinking, Pierre.
It's so early.
Just a little Suze.
Does one good, what with this heat.
You'd think you were in Saigon.
How are you, my boy?
- All right, Monsieur Tonin.
Doesn't he look like Paul?
A little.
Paul was thinner.
Read me the mail, Mama.
"Dear Gentlemen of the Gestapo:
As a farmer, with WWI medals,
I must inform you of the shady doings of a certain Etienne Louvel..."
Hurry up!
Move it.
Here's Lieutenant Voltaire for you.
We found him in bed, sleeping like an angel.
These leaflets were on his night table.
"German troops are retreating on all fronts.
You will soon be free in a Free France."
They could at least ask people.
I don't want to be freed by the Rothschild Bank.
That's my right, isn't it?
Shut up, you bastard!
Welcome, Monsieur Peyssac.
Take him upstairs.
I'll be right there.
- Shall I start on him?
- No, wait for me.
It's funny, but I've never liked teachers.
If you don't need me,
I'll go take a shower.
I don't know why they're all socialists.
Are you a socialist?
What will happen to him?
Don't worry.
We'll just have a chat.
We should find this young man something to do.
He can open the mail.
Here.
Just do like this.
Go on, Mama.
"I must call to your attention that the milliner,
Solange Leboeuf, of Lubsac, is often visited by her two sons, both outlaws and communists."
That's enough.
"Monsieur, as a practicing Catholic who finds the black market unworthy of Frenchmen and Christians,
I'd like to inform you..."
Nothing serious this morning?
Yes.
A complaint from the prefecture concerning the disappearance of Dr. Pradines.
Forget it, Mama.
They're not about to find
Dr. Pradines.
I'll go take care of Voltaire.
Are you Monsieur Tonin's mother?
Of course not!
Are there many more like this?
We get about two hundred a day.
One man even writes to inform on himself.
It's like a disease.
- You'd like to work for the police?
- I don't know.
You're young.
I think Inspector Lanciaga likes you.
Monsieur Tonin is an inspector?
He was... an exceptional policeman.
He isn't anymore?
They dismissed him in '36 as an undesirable!
Run along, kids.
Tell me, Jean-B.
What, my dear?
Is there a gypsy restaurant in Toulouse?
No, my dear.
There's nothing in Toulouse.
When are we going to San Sebastian?
The end of the month.
- What's it like?
- You'll see.
There's a great hotel, and everything you like.
Ever shot with one of these?
Come here.
Grasp it firmly.
Raise your arm, loose and relaxed, and hold your breath.
Aim at his left nostril.
His left nostril, not his necktie!
Try again.
- He's better than you.
- That's not saying much.
Where are we going?
To see Albert Horn.
Know who he is?
A top tailor from Paris.
You coming?
- He lives here?
- He's lying low.
He works exclusively for me.
What a surprise finding him in this hole.
I was going to school nearby in Sorèze. You know it?
They kicked me out.
Oh, it's you.
Am I disturbing you?
Never.
I brought you a customer.
It's his first suit.
An important step in a man's life.
Take off your jacket.
Does the young man want the plaid or the blue flannel, like the one I made for you?
The plaid.
Do you agree, Lucien?
I don't give a damn.
Remember when Papa first brought me to your place?
I was twelve.
You were on the rue Marbeuf back then.
Your mother's a strange one.
Nice materials.
I got them for nothing.
A few gas coupons.
I never told you where they came from.
From Cassels.
Their liquidated stock.
Whatever happened to Cassels?
There's a camp at St. Denis for the English.
The Jews are in Drancy.
I know.
Thank you.
It will be ready in five days.
Listen.
There's news about Spain.
But it will cost you.
You think it hasn't already?
They're coming down harder on people like you.
What I gave you isn't enough?
That was for the forged papers.
The gentleman is a rich and stingy Jew.
Stop that playing.
The music is bothering us.
You must miss Paris.
The number of nightclubs has doubled since '39.
War has its good sides too.
The German general staff announces
that yesterday its troops took
hundreds of American prisoners,
confirming the poor morale
and lack of fighting spirit
among American troops.
General Montgomery now admits
that Anglo-American forces,
held in check
by the Germans,
were unable,
during the last 24 hours,
to effect any noticeable progress
along the Normandy front.
In Cherbourg, the battle
still rages.
The Americans suffered
heavy losses in street fighting.
That's not a real Pink Lady!
Please, sweetheart.
She tried.
The best Pink Ladys I ever drank were at Rudy Hiden's bar.
The best English bar in Paris.
How about putting on some music?
There's a war going on,
Miss Beaulieu.
Do you know I'm in the movies?
Really?
Last year I had a good part in Night Raid, with Yvon Nevers.
People could see you in the movies?
In Paris you could.
In this hole they only show old films.
Like I thought:
The Americans aren't soldiers.
Seems they put their Negroes in the front lines.
You're biased.
Who says the news is accurate?
- Are you joking?
- Not at all.
You have to listen to Radio London and split the difference.
Aren't you warm with that on?
"To Lucien, on a June evening, with my best wishes for happiness, poetry and success."
You understand English, Stéphane?
No. Why should I?
I'm not a turncoat.
Know what I think of the English?
They make me sick.
They're better-Iooking than the French.
I love Leslie Howard.
Even stupidity has its limits, don't you think?
What was that?
Repeat what you said!
You want me to smack you?
You two fighting again?
Henri, a cognac.
- Still wheeling and dealing?
- I have no choice.
You're a boor and a fool, Monsieur Faure.
You don't know who you're speaking to.
You've got a job waiting upstairs.
Let's go.
- I'm coming too.
- There's no point, darling.
If it amuses her...
Yes, it amuses me.
I don't give a damn which side wins the war.
I only know I'm wasting my time here... surrounded by these nobodies.
If they were at least good-Iooking.
Do you ever think about my career?
This is Henri.
What's he saying?
Two loads of shoes on the Spanish border.
Shoes? And the entry permit?
He'll get it from Max in exchange for the tungsten.
Okay, tell him it's a deal.
A cup of tea?
You're not going to sleep in the office again tonight.
I'm going upstairs now.
Wait a little.
It's the fifth door on the right at the end of the hall.
- Will you be much longer, Henri?
- I'm coming.
Did you talk to Wiroth?
- Yes.
He's giving me a kickback on the chamois skins.
- The Krauts want them?
- Chamois skins? You have no idea.
Madame Georges, you're one hell of a businesswoman!
What about tanned leather?
- There's only untanned.
But at a very good price.
- A good price?
Watch your trousers, Jean-B!
Well, Monsieur Peyssac?
You gonna talk, you bastard?
Damn, he seems to like it!
Stay away from those people.
They're not like us.
First of all... the Americans are going to win the war.
Everyone says so.
You hear me?
The Germans are finished.
The Americans will win, I tell you.
I'll do the talking.
I should have been an actor.
I'd have been better than Betty.
Dr. Vaugeois?
Speaking.
I'm from the underground at Lorsac.
The Germans attacked.
I've got a bullet in my thigh.
I'm on vacation, and I have nothing with me.
All right. Come in.
Patrick, get my bag.
And some bandages and alcohol.
That's my son.
Lie down.
Some buddies told me about you.
Commandant Méry in particular.
Is that so?
You know Méry?
Very well.
He's a friend.
He sends one of his boys this way now and then.
I'm sorry. German police.
I'm sorry.
Keep an eye on him.
Put your hands up.
Move it.
Paul, what's going on?
Don't be frightened, dear.
Exquisite.
Are you related to Philippe Vaugeois?
I met him at La Baule.
That was September of '38.
Is that so?
A charming boy, Philippe.
An excellent tennis player.
He always beat me.
- Who's that?
- My great-grandmother.
- Well?
- Just as we thought. He works with Méry.
Paul, do something!
Call the mayor!
Don't worry.
You wish to speak to Dr. Vaugeois?
Just a moment.
It's his brother.
What shall I say?
That we're going to shoot him.
We're going to shoot him, monsieur.
That's right... shoot him.
And send him all our love.
We send all our love, sir.
He hung up.
Now, what can you tell us about Commandant Méry?
A man like you working with terrorists...
I don't get it.
You want bolshevism in France?
- I'm a Gaullist.
De Gaulle's surrounded by Jews and commies.
You want names?
Does Schumann sound French to you?
Save the politics for later.
Come on, Doctor.
Tell us about Commandant Méry.
Come on, start talking.
- What's this?
- The Wandera.
I built it.
It took me a year.
It's almost done.
Is it a lot of work?
Especially the portholes.
What about you?
Are you like your father?
You know nothing about the underground either?
Your suit is ready.
I made you golf trousers.
They're more elegant on a young man.
Do you like golf trousers?
I could make straight-legged pants, but I think golf trousers are more... more...
What are golf trousers?
They're like these.
We must have a fitting.
These are golf trousers?
Are you from here in town?
No, I'm from Souleillac.
And you're a friend of Jean-Bernard de Voisins?
Are you a student?
Are you on vacation?
No, I'm with the German police.
I knew Jean-Bernard's father,
Count de Voisins.
A charming man.
He worried a great deal about his son.
So you're a Jew.
Monsieur Faure says
Jews are the enemies of France.
Not me.
Are you from Paris?
I was good at my work.
I had a good clientele.
Friends.
What do you want?
I'm going shopping.
Let me have some money.
Aren't you going to introduce me?
My daughter, France.
Lacombe, Lucien.
Hurry up now.
See you later.
Monsieur Jean-Bernard told me to collect the money you owe.
Tell Monsieur Jean-Bernard that his father would be very sad if he knew.
He was a real gentleman.
But what do I care?
Come with me.
- Stand in line like everyone else!
- Who do they think they are?
Who does she think she is?
Kids today think they can get away with anything!
Cutting in line, eh?
Aren't you going to say anything?
I've been waiting an hour!
You think I'll stand for this?
German police!
To hell with the German police.
Aren't you going a bit far?
What's going on here?
German police.
You work with Monsieur Tonin?
Sorry. I didn't know.
Why do you keep talking about it?
I forgot it long ago.
It was only a year ago, my dear.
I've never understood why you did it.
You never tried to understand.
I loved him. It's very simple.
- And did he love you?
- Why not? What would you know?
After what he did?
You can't tell me he was a decent boy.
Papa, stop it, please!
You're getting on my nerves!
Is Monsieur Horn in?
What is it?
What do you want?
I've come to see your daughter.
Sit down, Monsieur Horn.
I suppose you'll be joining us for dinner?
It's nice in here.
Not like outside.
I brought you a present.
Champagne from Lossy.
Monsieur Jean-Bernard says it's the best.
You like champagne, mademoiselle?
No, not tonight.
But of course you like champagne.
Bottoms up, granny.
A toast, Monsieur Horn?
You should have some.
Your champagne is warm... and it's a bad year, besides.
France, this young man is a customer.
Forgive me, but I've forgotten your name.
A nice name.
And your name is Albert.
To your health... my dear.
My dear?
Are you happy with your golf trousers?
Not really, Monsieur Horn.
Do you know Betty Beaulieu?
Monsieur Jean-Bernard's friend.
She was in Night Raid.
I don't know her.
More champagne?
Let's celebrate.
No, really.
Come on, Albert.
It won't hurt you.
What are we celebrating exactly?
France, you should go to bed.
I forbid you to go to bed... my dear.
Why do you call me "my dear"?
I don't know.
What did you do before joining the police?
- I was studying.
- Studying what?
I could have you all arrested!
France, be quiet.
Are you afraid of him?
Yes, and he's right to be.
I'll get it.
I'd like a word with you,
Monsieur Horn.
Certainly.
You have funny hands.
I might need the apartment.
Why should I do you a favor?
But it's not fair.
Yes, it is.
I have every right to raise the rent.
I'm taking quite a risk having you here as it is.
Besides, no one's forcing you to stay.
France isn't one big waiting room.
Very well, Monsieur Raverdy.
You know what Marshal Pétain says?
Marshal Pétain?
Mr. Tonin calls him the Old Asshole!
- The Old Asshole?
- Very funny.
Is this gentleman your guest?
German police.
What's all this about?
This young man is indeed with the German police.
Your papers.
Get out!
You entertain people from the Gestapo now? Bravo!
Is that where your daughter sleeps?
Yes, it is.
Then we'd better whisper so we don't wake her.
By the way, Albert... your daughter's pretty.
Why do you two fight?
We get along very well.
I didn't want to mention it in front of her, but I shot a guy the other day.
You know, you shouldn't always believe Monsieur Jean-Bernard.
It isn't true what he said about Spain.
All he wants is your money.
You think I don't know that?
Shit!
They got the boss!
Christ, just my damn luck!
- You're not in too much pain?
- I hope it's not my lung.
Don't worry.
You got a drink?
I told you we should have left it to the militia.
Hold on, boss.
- See you, guys!
- Good luck, kid!
What do you want?
They got my boss.
What?
Your friends shot my boss.
- What friends?
- The Bolsheviks!
May I see France?
Look, Albert.
War loot.
You should go to bed.
Long live France.
This is for you.
Sad music, isn't it?
It's as if my whole life's been lived in time to that music.
Papa, don't start again.
France is a gifted pianist.
She should have gone to the conservatory. But then...
Please.
I brought you some flowers.
I've come to get your daughter.
It's a going-away party for Jean-Bernard and Betty.
I'd like to take France.
Are you crazy?
France is very tired.
If she doesn't come,
I'll take you to see my friends.
And some of them aren't too fond of Jews.
- I'm going.
- Stay here.
I forbid you to go.
Come now, Papa.
Hurry up.
We're going to be late.
Come dance, Lucien.
I don't know how.
You have to learn!
That's very tiring.
I'm thirsty.
You dance very well.
It's late.
I have to take you home.
You look bored.
May I have this dance?
She's beautiful.
Say good-bye to Horn for me.
As for Spain, tell him I'm going in his place.
I'm not pleased about it.
Some Jewish girls are so very beautiful.
They make other women look like old nags.
I had a Jewish fiancée once.
Incredibly stacked and very rich.
What are you telling him?
Nothing, my dear.
You broke my heel.
You've had too much to drink.
I'll take you home.
It's a shame you can't dance.
I'll teach you.
Relax.
See? It's easy.
Bastard.
You bastard!
Aubert says she's a Jew.
She has no right coming here.
Filthy Jew!
So you're sleeping with a Jew.
You think you'll get away with this?
I'm going to get the Germans this minute!
Take it easy, Marie.
It's nothing.
Filthy Jew!
They all have syphilis!
You hear me?
She'll give it to you!
Let me go! I want to talk to the filthy bitch!
She has no right!
Let me go!
Marie is usually nice.
I can't stand it anymore.
I'm tired of being a Jew.
One last drink, Betty!
For the road!
See you soon!
To my friends! For the road!
We'll send you some postcards.
My father has to get to Spain.
You know...
Italians are great on a bike, but I was never afraid of 'em.
Even a champion like Bartali didn't scare me.
You know the guys who really shook me?
The Flemish!
You never saw Sylvère Maes race.
South of Caen,
numerous Anglo-Canadian attacks
have gained them some terrain.
German troops
are putting up fierce resistance.
Get moving.
It's funny you can sew.
It's usually women who sew.
You won't talk to me?
What would you say if I married France?
It's very strange.
Somehow I can't bring myself to completely despise you.
There's someone to see Monsieur Lacombe.
His mother.
She came to the hotel.
I thought it best to bring her here.
He's very kind.
Have a seat.
Forgive me for receiving you like this.
Have you come a long way?
- From Souleillac.
Our village.
I came to town with Laborit for the fair.
Did you get the money orders?
I brought you a chicken.
Are you eating well?
This is Lucien's mother.
My daughter.
She's very pretty.
I came to thank you for the money.
I don't want to bother anyone.
But you're not.
Please sit down.
You're not from around here?
We're from Paris.
But life in Paris is very difficult right now.
There's nothing to eat there.
You're not French.
More or less.
My daughter is really French.
Is she happy here?
Ask her.
Lucien will have to show her around.
Only he can't return to his village.
You know, Lucien worries me.
And me too.
But he's not a bad boy.
You're a friend of Lucien's.
Perhaps you could reason with him.
I'm not a friend of Lucien's.
My daughter worries me too.
Very much.
Don't you think we were better off before the war?
- I'll see you off.
- No need.
It's better if Laborit doesn't see you.
Look what I got.
It's nothing.
We get them every day.
They're going to kill you.
Laborit says so.
Why don't you get away from here?
I like it here.
I'll miss my bus.
Wait.
You should eat something, Papa.
It's hard to have an appetite when I have a whore for a daughter.
That wasn't nice, what you said.
I think it's very rude to call your daughter a whore.
You deserve a good thrashing.
I don't need you to tell me how to treat my daughter!
France and I are very much alike.
We're very fragile creatures.
Forgive me, my dear.
Leave me alone!
They let Monsieur weig's mother die.
Fröhlich told me.
Don't worry, Papa.
We'll get to Spain.
Spain.
Spain doesn't exist.
Be reasonable, Papa.
Feeling better?
You know, Monsieur Horn...
I like you a lot.
- I'm sure we can get to Spain.
- Have they closed the borders?
There are still some unguarded spots.
I'm going to bed.
Good night, my friends.
You know your grandmother can't manage.
There's no point even talking about it.
You're right.
Besides, the war will be over soon anyway.
It's true.
The Americans are already in Rouen.
You went out?
I took a little walk.
I haven't been out for so long.
I feel like my old self.
France says you could get us across the border to Spain.
Really?
Lucien, I'd like to talk to you man to man.
We've never talked.
What do you want to talk about?
France.
I don't have time.
I have to get to work.
They really got him.
I'm beat.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Lucien, this gentleman is here to see you.
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.
I've been chatting with your friend.
He's very nice.
Another round?
You're crazy!
I came to talk to you.
Things can't go on like this.
You just can't help acting like an ass!
Come on.
I'm taking you home.
- Who's this?
- A friend.
Horn? Isn't he the Jew?
You bring Jews to the hotel bar now?
Forgive him.
He's young.
I'll see you in my office.
Show me your papers.
What's this? "Jean-François Rivière.
Born in Paris, July 30, 1892."
De Voisins got this for you.
Precisely.
I want to see an ID with "Jew" written on it.
All I have is a calling card.
Last name: Horn.
First name: Albert.
Place of birth?
- Szekesfehervar.
- What?
Why don't you just put Toulouse?
Address?
52 rue Pierre Premier de Serbie, Paris.
Nationality?
French.
Didn't anyone ever tell you yids can't be French?
On occasion.
To me a Jew is like a rat.
No more, no less.
Really?
They breed like crazy.
There's more and more of 'em.
- I can leave, if you like.
- Stay there.
I'm calling the Kommandantur.
You can explain to them.
Why do you speak to me in that tone?
We didn't get to talk about France.
She was asleep when I left.
What I wanted to tell you...
Guess what, my friend.
I have a Jew in my office.
Open up!
Old witch!
They put him on a train to Toulouse.
I don't know where they're taking them.
It's his own fault.
Shut up!
You bastard!
I'm a soldier like you,
fighting for my country!
I demand to be treated
like a soldier!
Go up and guard that guy.
I'll be with those gentlemen.
You still have the strength to work?
More than ever.
Bear up, kid.
How old are you, kid?
So you're working for the Germans?
A young Frenchman like you.
Aren't you ashamed?
I don't like people talking down to me.
Stop acting smart, kid!
You know they're gonna shoot you?
You don't look like a thug.
Listen.
I'll give you a chance.
Take off these handcuffs and I'll take you with me.
Understand?
I don't like people talking down to me.
Hurry up!
Get me the Kommandantur.
You may take a small suitcase or knapsack.
Only personal effects.
No food, no books, no money.
Hurry up.
- But...
- Hurry up.
You're not alone.
I still have lots of names on my list.
There's been a serious incident.
Hurry up.
Monsieur Lacombe, you work for the German police.
There are no thieves in the German police.
Give me that watch.
I'm staying with her.
Where are we going?
I don't know.
Spain.
Damn it!
- What did she say?
- There's a card missing.
Lucien Lacombe was arrested on October 12, 1944.
He was tried by a military court of the Resistance, sentenced to death and executed.
I hope our new Commander-in-Chief isn't the coward they say he is.
Whatever they say, Yamamoto is the kind of leader we need.
He believes in the value of the airplane.
But why a Vice-Navy Minister for such an important position?
Maybe the climate in Tokyo was detrimental to Yamamoto's health.
The Army is against him for opposing their policies.
So he runs away to sea. Now he has the entire fleet to guard him.
This order makes you
Commander-in-Chief.
The Imperial fleet consists of...
Save your breath, Yoshida.
Those details are in the documents.
You haven't changed!
With the Army controlling politics...
...your job as Navy Minister will be difficult.
Thank God you're here.
We know your life has been threatened.
I'm not that easy to kill.
Army hotheads are demanding an alliance with Germany.
That would be tragic for Japan.
As Navy Minister I will...
...continue to fight with the Army.
You are our last hope, Yoshida.
The Navy must stand firm against the alliance.
America is against the war we are waging in China...
...and angry that we are negotiating with the Germans.
Now we are threatened with an embargo of the raw materials we need.
Either we improve relations with the U.S. and withdraw from China...
...or find another source of raw materials here in Indo-China.
Why worry about threats from America?
President Roosevelt’s attention is on Europe...
...where Germany is winning a quick victory over the Allied Armies.
Now is the time to strike.
The British, the Dutch and the French are withdrawing their forces...
...from Southeast Asia to strengthen their armies in Europe.
We must be careful.
The Americans have an Army in the Philippines...
...and they have moved their Pacific
Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor.
Yes, and that fleet is a knife leveled at Japan's throat.
The Japanese ambassador just arrived.
He should be up shortly.
Thank you.
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.
You know that.
When Nomura took over as ambassador...
...I had some hopes of settling our differences.
But our meetings so far have been unproductive.
He brings me proposals,
I offer compromises.
He brings me counterproposals, and so on.
I tell you, Henry,
Nomura was sent here to buy time.
That's what he's doing, at our expense.
The president believes him to be a man of honor...
...that we can trust and deal with.
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.
It is always a pleasure.
I assume you know Mr. Stimson, the head of our War Department.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Ambassador.
I do hope, Mr. Stimson...
...your presence here does not indicate anything ominous.
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?
Thank you.
Well, since our last talk a week ago...
...I have received certain...
...shall we say...
...questions from my government...
...to put to you to clarify certain matters.
Good morning, Colonel.
There it is.
This machine let's us intercept every word between Tokyo...
...and all Japanese embassies.
The coded material is fed into that machine.
It goes round and round in there...
...and comes out here, decoded in Japanese.
All we have to do is translate it.
We decode this quicker than the Japanese embassy...
...right here in Washington.
No wonder you decided to call it
"Operation Magic."
- The latest intercept, sir.
- Thank you.
Things are getting a little hotter in the Pacific.
As long as we're sharing this assignment...
...take a look at this.
Behold the 12 apostles.
The chosen few are authorized to see the magic intercepts.
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, isn't on the list.
No, and not one of our overseas commanders.
Excellent!
Who is in command of those torpedo planes?
Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir, from the carrier Akagi.
Send him this message from me.
"Congratulations on brilliant torpedo attack."
If we are forced into a war with America...
...Japan's only hope...
...is to annihilate the American Pacific fleet at the outset.
I wonder if we could use torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor?
Stand by.
Execute.
Look at that entrance to the harbor.
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel and you've bottled up our whole fleet.
You know as well as I do, this harbor is a mousetrap.
Fleet should have stayed in San Diego where it belongs.
I made the mistake to point that out to Roosevelt.
We're expected to obey orders.
We're also expected to exercise our own good judgement.
I didn't ask for the job.
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command, and it's become habit...
...to worry about the security of the fleet.
The British, flying some old biplanes...
...torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships at Taranto.
- Harbor very much like this one.
- Well...
...I share your concern, but CNO doesn't think it can happen here.
Why not?
A torpedo dropped from a plane plunges...
...to a depth of 75 feet or more before it levels off.
I know, and Pearl is only
40 feet deep.
I'm still worried, Kim.
Frankly, sir, I was stunned when I heard of your proposal.
You think the plan is reckless?
You suggest using torpedo planes against the American Fleet...
...but Pearl Harbor is too shallow for that.
Taranto is also a shallow harbor...
...but the British torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships there.
I know as well as you do that my plan is a gamble.
And it's risky, but we have no choice.
What I need immediately is a plan for such an attack.
Then we should consult with Genda...
...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi, a superb strategist.
Yes, I remember Genda.
We'll talk to him.
Glad to see you, Genda.
So this is the new Zero?
Type 21, with folding wings.
This means we can carry more fighters now.
This Zero is fast, manoeuvrable and has a long cruising range.
Better than the Messerschmitt or Spitfire?
Definitely. I've seen both in combat over London.
You outrank me, so it must be true.
Now that you're Staff Officer here, things will be tough.
You don't have to worry, you won't be here.
You're going to the Third Fleet with a promotion.
The Commander-in-Chief must think you're good!
Of course he does!
And I've got proof!
Here is his telegram.
Want to read it?
Ten-hut!
Do the planes have to be parked like that?
Way at the edge of the field.
Standard dispersal procedure, General.
In case of enemy air attack.
There are 130,000 Japanese on this island.
Our main problem is sabotage.
It'd be too easy for enemies to sneak in at night...
...and blow up every one of them if they're left out there.
Make a note, Fielder.
We'll have to make changes.
Yes, sir.
Ten-hut.
- Yes?
- Admiral Halsey's here to see you.
Send him in, please.
Blast me, break me, court-martial me, draw and quarter me...
...if you think they're gonna send my ships...
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.
Kim, I think they've gone nuts in Washington.
How will I fight a task force if they send ...
...my ships to the Atlantic?
That damn ocean is a swimming hole compared to the Pacific.
What are we, a fighting fleet, or are these toy boats out here...
...so the Japs can buy them at Christmas?
All right, Bill, now ease it off.
It's not just you.
They asked for some of our tankers too.
How do they expect to feed these wagons...
...parked out here on this land-locked duck pond?
You're still planning on rotating half of them at sea?
I was.
Look, Kim, you've got to make them understand what's going on out here.
I'm gonna do everything I can, Bill.
Even go to the president.
By God, I knew there was at least one man...
...in this man's Navy who hadn't gone nuts.
"Gandhi" is still in hiding, sir.
A strange man, he works in his cabin like a hermit.
But he should be here.
Watanabe, go and ask him to join us.
When "Gandhi" concentrates on a plan, he is lost to this world.
Please don't bother me!
This is important...
...so I'm not going.
Genda's plan for attacking
Pearl Harbor...
...is foolproof. It's brilliant!
He stresses the importance of combat aircraft.
Just think of it.
We use six aircraft carriers...
...torpedo planes...
...high-level bombers, dive bombers.
Zero fighters for cover...
...go by the northern route, use the new torpedoes...
...we attack on a weekend.
Genda has thought of everything...
...refuelling...
...the weather....
And we go on to say,
"It should be noted that Japan ...
...has never preceded hostile action by a declaration of war.
We have concluded it possible that a fast-rated ...
...Japanese carrier force may arrive in Hawaii with no prior warning...
...from our intelligence service.
The most favourable time to the enemy would be dawn.
He probably would employ a maximum of six carriers...
...strike on a weekend.
- We recommend that the Air Corps..."
- I read it.
Yes, sir.
I appreciate the work that you and General Martin have put in.
These reports are very useful to General Short and myself.
General Martin, you don't pull any punches, do you?
"We recommend that the Air Corps...
...maintain a thorough
360-degree search...
...of the Hawaiian area during daylight.
This will require a force of
180 B-17 airplanes."
We can't search the sea approaches...
...unless we have the planes, sir.
One hundred and eighty B-17s?
For God's sakes, that's more than the number existing in the States.
It looks fine on paper, but that's not a paper fleet out there.
Squadron from the Enterprise.
Bill Halsey's working the tails off his men.
Wish we had more like him.
Makes the most of what he's got.
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.
Well, not one bomb anywhere near the target for the past hour.
Your pilots can see it, I suppose.
- Who's next?
- It's Anderson, sir.
Now, that's more like it.
- Maybe your boys finally get it.
- I hope so, sir.
Who's next?
Lieutenant Dickenson.
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...
...he couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle.
Yes, sir.
Ten-hut.
- Carry on.
- Carry on.
This it?
Yes, sir. Our new radar.
It's a remarkable scientific achievement...
...capable of spotting an intruder on the sea or in the air...
...and at quite a range.
- Now, listen, Colonel, as you know, we're short on patrol planes.
We're gonna have to rely on this...
...thing to detect the enemy.
General, radar should do the job.
What's it doing here, not set up?
We're about to truck it up that mountain.
That peak up there is the ideal spot to put our main radar post.
At that height, we'd be clear of all interference.
Obviously.
But, sir, we can't get permission to put her up there.
Permission?
From the National Park Service
Department of Interior.
See, all of this belongs to the Hawaiian National Park.
The Hawaiian National Park?
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation
Society is raising hell too.
And we can't get permission?
No, sir.
Not unless we want to fight them.
Fight them? You're damn right we're gonna fight them.
- Now you make a note of that, Fielder.
- Yes, sir.
Wildlife Preservation Society.
I feel like a damn fool.
Without even consulting me...
...our Army has decided to occupy Indo-China.
There is no hope for peace now.
I've said it before and I’ll keep on saying it...
...if we fight the Americans, we can't stop at Hawaii or San Francisco.
We'll have to march into Washington...
...and dictate peace terms in the White House!
Army hotheads who speak so lightly of war should think about that!
As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy,
I can do nothing.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame yourself.
The Army leaders are at fault, not you.
I must get back to the fleet.
There is a lot to be done.
It's no use, Hal.
I spoke to General Miles.
He took it up with General Marshall.
The order stands.
The president is off the ultra List.
Incredible.
Withholding information from the president.
Security found a copy of an intercept in a wastebasket at the White House.
Truth is, the brass don't trust some men close to the president.
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?
- Do you even trust your own wife?
- Do you?
Come to think of it, I believe I do.
Part two of No. 1390, Colonel.
Tokyo to embassies in Washington and Berlin.
Thank you, Miss Cave.
The Japanese are moving south to occupy French Indo-China.
- This is big trouble.
- Yeah.
Well, ultra list or not...
...someone has to tell the president about this one.
"Therefore, we will impose a full embargo...
...on all trade with Japan.
We do not anticipate immediate hostile action by Japan...
...but you get this information...
...so you may take appropriate precautionary measures."
"Appropriate precautionary measures."
What the hell does that mean?
Now, this is signed jointly by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.
Until we know how the Japanese will react, we're not gonna take chances.
- We go on full alert.
- Yes, sir.
Stark says they don't anticipate hostile action.
Why send a warning at all?
Damn it.
Damn it, why can't Washington give us the full inside story?
I'd sooner form my own opinion.
"Don't anticipate hostile action."
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.
Increase air and sub patrols, alert senior commanders.
Maybe out of this we can find out how well we can function.
Kaminsky.
This is Captain Earle.
Going on full alert.
Yes, captain.
We're going on full alert.
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.
What the hell is going on here?
What are you doing?
Carrying out orders.
General Short's concern is sabotage.
All aircraft not ready for flight from now on...
...will be parked in the center...
...so they can be kept under guard.
Suppose there's an air raid.
They hit one plane, and it all goes up in flames.
I'm sorry. General's orders.
Today's war games...
...of a theoretical attack on Pearl Harbor...
...clearly show the need for six carriers in the attack force.
The General Staff...
...wants to limit us to only three carriers.
We must have six!
If we reduce our striking force...
...from six carriers to only three...
...our mission will fail.
Before attacking anything else, we should attack our General Staff.
We believe in aircraft, but they cling to the ancient theory...
...that decisive naval engagements must be fought between battleships.
Unless we dispel this myth...
...we'll never get their approval.
They are not the only believers in the "battleship theory."
Many officers here today also support the idea.
I'm one of them. We'll soon have two new unsinkable battlewagons...
...each with a displacement of
65,000 tons and huge guns.
Anything that floats can be sunk!
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.
The war in Europe is being decided by the airplane.
There can be no νictory on land or sea, without control of the air!
I have been chosen to command this task force.
And I consider this operation risky.
How can we travel 3500 miles to Hawaii without being detected?
This mission will fail unless we achieve complete surprise.
My ships can't carry fuel for a trip there and back.
Stopping to refuel increases the possibility of detection.
I am confident that our ships will reach Hawaii safely.
You are too cautious. The case for using six carriers is sound.
To criticize the plan is defeatist!
No more bickering! As long as I am Commander-in-Chief...
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!
I am aware that this is a dangerous gamble.
But we can't afford the luxury of playing it safe now!
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this plan or not is no longer an issue.
Let us now decide how best to carry it out.
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!
Fuchida! What a surprise!
I'm your new Air Commander, so treat me well.
You're joking. How did you rate another promotion?
Well, exceptional people get exceptional treatment!
This ship is crawling with Admirals.
Something important must be happening.
We have called you here...
...to explain the purpose of a new training program.
This, of course, is a matter of strictest secrecy.
It looks just like Pearl Harbor, doesn't it?
And that area down there looks like Ford island, eh?
Beautiful!
Navy pilots attract geisha girls but they frighten the fish.
It's not an ideal radar sight, but at least we got a permit.
Let's get the other units working.
Easier said than done.
What do you mean?
We have to get all six units adjusted and link them by phone to headquarters.
That means training men to operate an information center...
...so they know what to do with the information.
Take it easy, Murph.
- You'll figure it out.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Don't just stand there.
You know how to operate this thing.
We know the theory.
Let's put that theory into practice.
- Switch on.
- Yes, sir.
Stay put and keep watching the screen.
In two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.
Excuse me, sir, but what are we watching for?
Anything unusual.
Any large blip coming from the sea.
Colonel, if we do spot something, what do we do?
Report it to headquarters, damn it.
- How, sir?
- What?
We haven't got a telephone, sir.
There's a gas station a mile down the road.
They must have a phone.
We got 183 combat planes on this base, General.
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed monkey hanging from a balloon...
...could scatter them to hell with one hand grenade.
General Short gave the order.
Come in.
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
- Okay, send them in.
You two men get in your planes and fly over to Haleiwa.
Yes, sir.
What are our orders when we get there?
Just sit tight.
Listen for the phone. That's all.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Haleiwa is one of the subsidiary fields.
We send those two up there, two more here.
Only way I know to disperse a few of the planes.
If I'd get away with it, I'd send all to the neighbour islands.
- You know why we're being transferred.
- Them poker games.
- Been winning too often.
- Yeah.
Some sucker loses his shirt, so he bitches to the General.
That's it.
It's hard to believe the Emperor agreed...
...to fix a date by which the final decision must be made...
...between war and peace.
His majesty's signature is a mere formality.
The cabinet is responsible for all matters of national policy.
The Emperor recently read a poem to his Ministers to show how he feels.
"If all people are brethren...
...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"
"If all people are brethren...
...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"
This clearly shows how much the Emperor wants to avoid a war.
Yes, he has urged us to solve our differences with Washington.
But, sir, the deadline is October.
Can a solution be found by then?
Perhaps. But if we fail...
...if war does come...
...tell me frankly, from the Navy's Viewpoint...
...what are our chances against the Americans?
If we must, we can raise havoc with them for a year.
After that, I can guarantee nothing.
Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you will continue the negotiations.
Please remember, there is no last word in diplomacy.
Tokyo has ignored my repeated inquiries...
...and still has made no reply...
...to the compromise proposals offered by Secretary Hull.
The war that I have dreaded for so long...
...may soon become a reality.
Nomura has offered his resignation several times.
But Tokyo won't let him quit.
Instead they're sending a second ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.
Do you really think this Kurusu can do any good?
Well, I doubt it, Frank.
He's hardly the most tactful choice.
When he was ambassador in Berlin...
...he signed the Axis Pact on behalf of Japan.
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay on November 26 under my strict orders.
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka" will be confirmation to go on.
We have tentatively set the date for the attack...
...on Sunday, December 7th,
Hawaiian time.
But you must understand that we are still negotiating in Washington.
If a peaceful solution is found...
...the fleet will be recalled at once.
Once at sea, to turn back would be a disgrace!
It would destroy the morale of the men!
They're in a high state of readiness, physically and psychologically.
Enough! If any commander is inclined to reject an order to return...
...when the path for peace is open...
...let him resign now!
Finally, gentlemen...
...many misinformed Japanese...
...believe that America is a nation divided, isolationist...
...and that Americans are only interested...
...in enjoying a life of Luxury...
...and are spiritually and morally corrupt.
But that is a great mistake.
If war becomes inevitable...
...America would be the most formidable foe that we have ever fought.
I've lived in Washington and studied at Harvard...
...so I know the Americans are a proud and just people.
- You sick or something?
- No.
I've been piecing together this batch of new intercepts.
- A frightening picture is taking shape.
- Oh?
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu asked their government...
...to extend a deadline for suspending negotiation between Japan and America.
- You remember that?
- Yeah.
Now, according to this latest intercept...
...Tokyo wants to conclude negotiations with us...
...no later than November 29...
...after which, and I quote:
"Things are automatically going to happen."
Now...
...look at this intelligence report from the British.
Five Japanese troop transports with naval escort...
...were sighted off Formosa, heading south.
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.
I'm not so sure.
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.
Japan is going to attack us.
The 29th is only four days off.
The 30th is on a Sunday.
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday, the 30th of November.
The pieces fit together.
But can you prove it?
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.
Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall.
Oh, General Marshall's at Fort Benning, sir.
Then get me the secretary of war.
I've got the evidence, AI.
And I'm gonna make the brass around here admit I'm right.
Bratton's analysis makes sense.
His facts are undeniable.
Henry, I'm washing my hands of the whole matter.
From now on, it's in your hands...
...and in those of the Navy Department.
I'll call the president.
A message declaring a full alert will be sent out.
Sir?
General Marshall anticipated an emergency like this.
Before he left to attend manoeuvres...
...he made out this alert order.
As you know, after the Cabinet decided to send Japan to war...
...they held an Imperial Conference at the palace.
His Majesty, who participated in this conference...
...which is a mere formality...
...was depressed and silent all through the meeting.
Today His Majesty will ask the customary questions about the war...
...and you will make the traditional replies.
There can be no more tragic ritual than this conversation...
...between His Majesty who does not want war...
...and Your Excellency, who has opposed it so vigorously.
As Minister of the Imperial Household...
...I am not allowed to attend this ritual.
Fortunately for me...
...I won't have to witness this tragic ceremony.
I can go no farther.
The Military Attaché will take you from here.
Sir, a message!
"From Admiral Yamamoto,
Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet...
...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet...
...climb Mount Niitaka."
Hostilities will begin on December 7th...
...exactly as scheduled.
Read this back to me.
"Japanese future action unpredictable.
But hostile action possible at any moment.
If hostilities cannot be avoided...
...the United States desires that
Japan commit the first overt act."
Wait a minute. Read that again.
"If hostilities cannot be avoided, the United States desires...
...that Japan commit the first overt act.
This shouldn't be construed as restricting you...
...to a course of action jeopardizing your defense.
Prior to hostile Japanese action...
...you are directed to undertake reconnaissance...
...and other measures as you deem necessary.
These measures should be carried out...
...so as not to alarm the civil population ...
...or disclose intent. By order of General George C. Marshall."
"Not to alarm the civil population."
What do you make of it?
Well...
...if you ask me, sir, it's double talk.
But the chief of staff doesn't go in for double talk.
- We're going on alert.
- Again?
But the men are confused.
So many alerts.
- Damn it, unconfuse them.
- Yes, sir.
"Japanese forces may attack the Philippines...
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo.
This dispatch is to be considered a war warning."
Well, there it is, gentlemen.
You now have as much information as I do.
That's the second warning in three days.
"Japanese forces may attack the Philippines...
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo."
They don't mention us.
That's correct. I think it should be considered significant.
Well, gentlemen...
...we have a job to do.
Washington wants us to send a squadron of fighters to Midway.
And another squadron to Wake.
When can you sail?
Well, the Enterprise can sail tomorrow morning.
I'll need a day or two. We're just completing repairs on the Lexington.
Hurry things along, John.
I want you out there to probe.
I want planes up in the air morning and afternoon.
I want a report on any sign of hostile ships.
Understood.
Do you want battleships along?
Hell, no. They're too slow.
If we're gonna probe, let's probe.
We don't want anything holding us up.
You're right, but I'm not ready to commit them myself.
Not until I know when and where.
Do you plan to keep half the fleet at sea while the carriers are gone?
No, it's too risky.
I'll have to keep the fleet here at Pearl while you're away.
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.
I don't like the idea of having my battleships without air cover.
Yes, sir.
Admiral.
Kim.
Level with me.
I want a clear directive.
If I run into a Jap ship, what action do I take?
Use your common sense.
That's the best damn order I ever had.
If I see so much as a sampan there...
...I'll blow it out of the water.
"Intelligence Report,
U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor...
...six battleships, three light cruisers...
...16 destroyers and one aircraft carrier."
No information about the other American carriers.
You know today's date?
December 1st.
Yes, but tonight will be November 30th.
When we cross the International Date Line...
...we'll push the clock ahead five hours...
...and turn the calendar back a full day, making today yesterday.
Don't be silly!
Today can't change into yesterday!
You're not too intelligent but I'll try to explain...
...so listen carefully.
It's a little before 1300 hours, right?
So why are we making supper at this hour?
1300? It should be lunchtime.
Right! And the Date Line makes up for that time difference...
...by turning today into yesterday.
I don't quite understand, but if we see the enemy across that line...
...I guess it would be useless to shoot at them.
Because how can today's shells hit yesterday's enemy?
What is it this time, getting me over here?
Tokyo has alerted their embassy to stand by...
...for a very long message in 14 parts.
Look, Rufe, you scared me and everybody else last week.
We're not doing that again, are we?
You should see this.
It's the latest report on those
Japanese troop transports.
Remember those troop ships?
They're still heading south with an escort...
...only 14 hours from the coast of Malaya.
What about their aircraft carriers?
We don't know.
Intelligence was keeping track of them until recently.
Now we've lost them.
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself in their minds.
Where do you think I have been the past week, night and day?
I am still convinced they're going to attack us.
What can we do that we aren't doing already?
I don't know about you, but I know what I'm gonna do.
Where is everybody?
Oh, it's past 12, sir.
They've already gone.
- Get them back.
- On the weekend?
Yes, on the weekend.
"Only specially screened members of your communications staff...
...are to be permitted to process the 15-part message...
...and prepare the typed translation."
It will be difficult without the help of a skilled typist.
The situation right now is extremely delicate.
We must be prepared...
...to have each part of the message decoded as soon as it comes in.
I'll alert the code room.
We'll reach Point D soon, sir.
From Point D proceed to Point E.
Battle speed.
So this is the sound of Hawaii?
Disappointing news, our main targets, the American carriers...
...have left Pearl Harbor.
This completes 13 parts?
Yes, Tokyo is holding the final part till morning.
I wonder why.
It's almost 9.
Harry, I'm going to make the rounds with what we have here.
Thank God the president's back on the list.
Have Brotherhood call me when the missing part is in.
Right.
You're late.
- Well, I was...
- Please, take me to the White House.
If you told me we were invited to the
White House, I would've dressed.
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.
She's informal personally, but a stickler for protocol...
Darling, will you shut up and drive?
Once more!
Steady.
Great! We just sank the Nevada!
Pennsylvania!
Oklahoma!
Enterprise!
No, you idiot!
It's your own flagship!
Well?
Captain Wilkinson's.
Did you see the president?
No, I saw Harry Hopkins.
And did he read the whatever it is?
No, he doesn't have the key.
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide,
Lieutenant Schulz.
He took it in to the president.
And the president has a key,
I suppose?
Of course he has.
And did Lieutenant Schulz say anything?
He said, "Thank you."
Darling, step on it, will you?
If we can see nothing, then neither can American patrol planes.
I'm more concerned about a submarine detecting us.
Dead on schedule.
Admiral Stark can't be reached.
Should I take it to chief of staff?
It's after 10, General Marshall always retires early.
I see no reason to disturb Marshall with something that's incomplete.
- Wait till you have the final part.
- Yes, sir.
If you're so concerned...
...why don't we call chief of war plans,
Admiral Turner?
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.
- You don't happen to know where he is?
- No idea.
The president has already discussed it with me.
He sent a personal message to the emperor.
But when the final part of this comes in, I'd like to see it then.
- Good night, commander.
- Good night, sir.
I was starved. I'll bet you are.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Can't you tell me anything?
Even a hint?
You'd think the world was falling apart.
Admiral Stark talked to the president.
What did the president say?
He sent a personal message to the emperor.
Gordy. Ed.
We got those B-17s coming in from California in the morning.
Honolulu radio will stay on the air all night...
...so the planes can home in.
You and I had better be in that control tower at 7:30 sharp.
- Yes, sir.
- Dear.
- Tyler, I've got a job for you.
- Sir.
Report to the new radar center at Fort Shafter at 0400.
At 4:00 in the morning?
From 4 to 7 a.m.
Our marvel of science only operates for three hours.
Lucky boy. Lucky boy!
Captain, how's it feel?
First command, first patrol.
Just fine, Mr. Young.
In fact, I think
I'll turn in for a while.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
The Commander-in-Chief has sent a message...
...wishing us good luck.
That, plus the Imperial Proclamation...
...has undoubtedly stirred your loyalty to the Empire.
The success of this mission...
...depends on surprise.
If we achieve it...
...the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora," will be sent out.
Now that the hour for battle draws near...
...I will not burden you with the usual pep talk.
Instead I shall hoist the famous "Z" flag...
...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief
Togo led his fleet to Victory...
...in the historic battle against the Russians.
Here you are.
Kramer.
AI, listen to this.
The fourteenth part.
"Will the ambassadors please submit our reply...
...to the United States government at precisely 1p.m...
...December 7th, your time."
1p.m.?
"Precisely 1p.m., your time."
I'll be right over.
Look at the president's message.
I should have had it hours ago.
As you know, communications have been delayed ...
...and frequently garbled lately.
Or deliberately interfered with.
Gene, call the foreign minister.
Tell him I want an immediate audience with the emperor.
Why is this so important?
Does this Roosevelt message say anything new?
It merely proposes a heart-to-heart exchange...
...between the two Chiefs of State.
It could start negotiations afresh.
It's too late for that.
It's just as well the message didn't come a day or two earlier.
What do I tell Ambassador Grew?
You are Foreign Minister!
Report to the palace alone with the message.
"After deciphering...
...part 14...
...destroy at once...
...your cipher machine...
...all codes...
...and secret documents."
Translate this immediately.
- Give a copy to Kramer when he comes.
- Yes, sir.
I've got to get the hell out of here.
Hey, look at this.
Finally got one.
Communication center.
It even works.
That's great.
Opana Point, communications check.
Are you reading us?
Coming in loud and clear.
Where's the General?
It's Sunday, sir.
This is Colonel Bratton.
Connect me with Chief of Staff,
General Marshall.
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.
Chief of staff's quarters,
Sergeant Aguirre speaking.
Yes, Colonel Bratton.
I'm sorry, sir, the General isn't here.
Where he always is this time Sunday morning.
- Where's Colonel Bratton?
- Gone to see General Marshall.
He left this for you, sir.
Here is another part of the message, sir.
We are instructed to submit the message at 1:00 p.m. today.
One p.m.?
The 14th part of this intercept
Kramer just delivered...
...indicates to me the Japanese are going to attack.
None of us doubt that war is coming.
We know they have an expeditionary force heading south.
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...
...I recommend you telephone
Admiral Kimmel ...
...in Hawaii.
No.
I better call the president first.
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
The men are in good spirits, sir.
They are eager to go.
Yes, they are eager because they do not know the taste of battle.
The mechanics asked me to give you this for good luck at Pearl Harbor.
Bring her into the wind.
"The Japanese government regrets to have to notify...
...the American government...
...that, in view of the attitude of the American government...
...it cannot but consider that it is impossible to reach...
...an agreement through further negotiations."
- Sir.
- Hm?
- There are supplemental messages.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, I am convinced the Japanese intend to attack...
...at or shortly after 1:00 today.
- I'll alert all Pacific commands.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.
Take this to communications center.
We will follow that ship into Pearl Harbor.
Come in.
Captain, can you come to the bridge?
Very well.
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?
- We're not sure.
- What ship?
The Navy tug Antares.
Look astern of her, captain.
She's towing a target raft.
Look between the ship and the raft, sir.
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.
She's sneaking through the net into the harbor. General Quarters.
- Sound General Quarters.
- All engines ahead, full.
Come left 15 degrees, sir.
- Tell Antares we're attacking.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Flags, tell Antares we're attacking.
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
Roll one.
Roll two.
Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges on a sub in our security zone.
Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Earle speaking.
- We have a message from the ward.
- All right, read it to me.
"Have dropped depth charges on sub operating in our security zone."
We've had so many of these false sightings, Kaminsky.
But this is the real thing, sir.
Closer than any previous sighting.
Just off the harbor entrance.
You and I know the skipper of that destroyer is a green kid.
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.
With all due respect, sir, I think we should alert all commanders.
Confirmation, Kaminsky.
I want confirmation.
The sunburst reminds me of our flag, a good omen.
Ed, this is hot.
General Marshall wants it sent to all commanders by the fastest route.
Right.
The General's handwriting, it's hard to read.
You're gonna have to help me with it, Rufe.
Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu on the radio.
Check your direction-finder dial.
It's coming from five degrees to port, sir.
Okay, keep riding that beam.
Major, I picked up some great music from Honolulu.
That's fine, pipe it through.
Okay.
Where's the damn chow truck?
Shut the thing down, George.
It's already after 7.
Hey, Joe, come here.
What do you make of that?
I've been watching it for minutes.
It's moving in, fast.
I've never seen anything that big.
- Looks like two main pulses.
- Hey, Joe, I got it.
I make that about 140 miles north, three degrees east.
Don't make sense, we got no planes out that far.
We gotta contact the information center.
Our problem is over at 7:00.
The center might make some sense out of it.
Okay, suit yourself.
Information center.
Yeah? I don't know, Mac, we're all closed down here.
Is that right? Hang on a minute.
Lieutenant, sir.
Lieutenant Tyler.
Sir, this is Private Elliot,
Opana Point.
There's a large formation of planes coming in...
...140 miles, three degrees east.
Yeah?
Well, don't worry about it.
The boys at Opana Point must have picked up the B-17s...
...coming in from the mainland.
- He said not to worry about it.
- Come on, let's go eat.
Colonel, I sent this to Manila, the canal zone and San Francisco...
...but the direct channel to Hawaii is out.
Atmospherics again?
Yes, sir, it's real bad today.
We could give it to the Navy.
What makes you think their atmospherics are better?
- Send it as a telegram.
- Yes, sir.
Our ultimatum should be delivered in
Washington before the attack begins.
I hope everything is on schedule.
Don't worry, sir.
The Emperor insists...
...that we follow the rules of the Geneva Convention.
Our declaration of war will be delivered...
...at 1:00 p.m.,
30 minutes before the attack begins.
The typing still isn't finished.
We'll have to postpone our 1:00 appointment with Secretary Hull.
Do you mean a submarine was sighted over half an hour ago...
...and that it's taken this long to report it to me?
I don't care if it still hasn't been confirmed.
I should've been informed after the ward radioed a first report.
A submarine that close is a serious matter.
A very serious matter.
Get the confirmation, all the reports to my office.
I mean, right now.
Have my driver get the car.
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...
...should I tell General Short you'll miss the golf date?
No, damn it, get my car.
A message for the General at Fort Shafter.
- Is it marked urgent?
- No.
It's a little bumpy, Davey...
...but you have to fly in all kinds of weather.
Sure, Miss Fort.
Don't let the nose drop.
That's better.
You're doing just fine.
I'm taking over, Davey.
Warrant Officer Mizuki, signal all planes, "prepare to attack."
A signal from Fuchida,
"objective sighted, preparing to attack."
Everything is strangely quiet.
The American anti-aircraft batteries haven't fired a shot!
And no enemy fighters over the harbor, sir!
We've done it!
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"
Stand by.
Execute.
Get his number.
I'll report him for safety violations.
Come on!
Alert all commands:
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill."
General Quarters. General Quarters.
Man your stations. Man your stations.
Sir.
Battle stations. Battle stations.
Fire your gun. Fire at will.
That bastard!
Station six, man your pump.
Plane to starboard.
You bastard!
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.
- Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor is being bombed.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.
Go back to your quarters.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.
What in the hell is going on?
Why wasn't the Army notified?
Did anyone think to inform Washington?
I thought so.
- General.
- Put all units on a full war footing.
Alert the territorial guard.
Open a command post at Aliamanu Crater.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be right down.
Oh, my God.
The island's under attack.
Those bastards will kill us all.
Men, get to the armory.
Get guns, ammunition.
- You too, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
- Operator.
- Duarte Air Field.
All the phone lines are jammed.
Well, try the radio again.
Hose down that plane.
Run for it.
Run, run!
There's Hickam.
Major, I heard something funny on the Honolulu radio.
What kind of traffic control is this?
The radio said something about an attack.
They're Japs, sir.
What a way to fly into a war.
Unarmed and out of gas.
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.
We've flown into the middle of a war.
Get out fast.
Anywhere. If you can't make Hickam, try Bellows or Wheeler.
Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious.
They shot one circuit box.
The landing light isn't working.
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.
- Major.
- Yeah.
One wheel is stuck.
Well, jolt it loose. We're going in.
- I tried.
- Try again!
Here they come. Fire!
Tell them to stop shooting at us!
We're Americans.
Major, no go, sir.
Like I said, it's a hell of a way to fly into a war.
- Run for it!
- Hurry up!
Tower to B-17, there's a Jap on your tail.
Goose your engine and get out.
Have damage control report all damages.
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.
Okay, sergeant, let's get the men down.
All right, you guys, let's go.
Where the hell are our fighters?
Captain, the main fuel tanks are fractured.
Lower deck's flooded, we're listing eight degrees.
Counter flood, counter flood.
You wanted confirmation, captain?
Take a look.
There's your confirmation!
"Oklahoma, capsized.
Nevada's taken a torpedo forward and is down to a head.
West Virginia, subjected to six torpedo hits and several deck fires.
Raleigh and Helena damaged and listing."
The California, two torpedoes, fires all around, temporarily abandoned.
I've just come from her.
It's spent, sir.
Would've been merciful had it killed me.
A message from
Flight Leader Fuchida.
"Have inflicted serious damage on numerous battleships."
Better than we had dreamed!
Where are our priority targets...
...the American carriers?
Mr. Secretary.
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill."
No, this can't be true.
They must mean the Philippines.
No, sir. It's Pearl.
Get me the White House, the direct line.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you in a moment. Please be seated.
Mr. President, has this been confirmed?
Then, sir,
I'd like you to have it confirmed ...
...before I receive Nomura and Kurusu.
They're waiting outside.
Operator. Operator.
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.
George, get a hold of a car, a truck, anything.
I'm calling Haleiwa to get them to start our planes. Go.
Right!
Battleship on the left, sir!
It's the Nevada. She's making a run for the sea!
If we sink her in the channel, the harbor will be blocked for months!
Recommend course 2-3-0, sir.
- Very well. Stay at 2-3-0.
- Stay at 2-3-0, sir.
Take cover!
More hose! More hose!
- More water. More! More water.
- Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
- Abandon ship! Abandon Ship!
- Over the side!
Can't get through the outer channel in this shape.
She goes down here, she'll block the south channel.
We'll have to beach her there so she's clear.
File these.
G-5.
- I need five copies each.
Messenger.
- Take this to General Short's office.
- Right.
File these.
Corporal.
This has to be decoded for the General.
Take it to the decoding room.
Ask them to send it back soon.
Yes, sir.
Run!
Run for it!
Drop the hose and get the ladders and axes.
What are you waiting for?
- We got no water.
- Why? What's wrong?
It's the Arizona.
She cut the pipes in the mains.
The tanker in the ocean there is full of aviation fuel.
If it goes, we'll blow up half the harbor.
Come on, hurry up!
Get out of the way!
Hey, look out!
In all my 50 years of public service...
...I have never seen a document so crowded with infamous falsehoods...
...and distortions...
...on a scale so huge...
...that I never imagined until today...
...that any government on this planet...
...was capable of uttering them.
Mr. Hull.
Go.
What's the matter? Why in hell doesn't the next wave take off?
But, sir, no one has given the order.
We've knocked out the American airfields...
...sunk four battleships, heavily damaged three more.
Sir, Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's carrier has signaled!
"Attack group ready for takeoff."
Unfortunately, the American carriers were not at Pearl Harbor.
Since we don't know where they are...
...we can't use our limited supply of fuel to look for them.
We must not forget that enemy submarines will be searching for us.
We have been lucky so far.
No take-off signal yet?
There is a signal now!
It says, "All ships head for Japan as soon as our planes return."
It can't be!
It must be a mistake!
We cannot turn back now.
We must destroy the American carriers and their dry docks...
...no matter how long it takes!
You're wrong. Our mission has been completely accomplished.
This task force is vital to us.
It is my duty to return it intact.
This war is just beginning.
We have a long way to go.
Yes, all right.
This came from the decoding room, a cablegram from the War Department.
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.
Pardon me, admiral.
- From Washington.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen.
"The Japanese are presenting at 1p.m...
...Eastern Standard Time today...
...what amounts to an ultimatum.
Just what significance the hour set may have, we do not know...
...but be on alert accordingly."
Signed ...
...George C. Marshall, chief of staff.
My God.
This leaves the Navy with only two combat groups in the Central Pacific.
Ours and the Lexington.
We don't want to get caught like they did.
I don't intend to.
When can you be ready for sea again?
We can fuel and provision and be under way before dawn.
Good. That's good.
Here is an announcement from the
Navy Department released December 7th.
"Before daybreak today, the Imperial Navy successfully launched...
...a large-scale air raid against the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii."
We salute the Commander-in-Chief of our Fleet...
...Admiral Yamamoto.
I had intended to deal a fatal blow to the American fleet...
...by attacking Pearl Harbor...
...immediately after Japan's official declaration of war.
But according to the American radio,
Pearl Harbor was attacked...
...55 minutes before our ultimatum...
...was delivered in Washington.
I can't imagine anything...
...that would infuriate the Americans more.
I fear all we have done...
...is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.

{13897}{14002}You know,|New Year's is really|depressing for me.
{14004}{14069}It's really weird, but I have|lost two friends...
{14070}{14124}on New Year's Eve.
{14126}{14243}Last year it was this|old boyfriend, Terry.
{14245}{14305}He was really sweet.
{14307}{14352}He wanted to get|married to me.
{14354}{14427}Guess what?|What?
{14429}{14516}Murph and Nance|got married.|Yeah?
{14518}{14583}Mm-hmm. In Golden Gate Park|on the 24th.
{14585}{14659}It was really groovy.|Acid in the punch?
{14661}{14713}I don't know.
{14715}{14801}You know what?|I've been thinking, Lance.|What?
{14826}{14888}I was thinking we could|have something like that.
{14890}{15008}Acid?|No.! A ceremony|like that.
{15010}{15103}- Like what?|- Like marriage.
{15141}{15217}We could have it on|the top of Mt. Tam|at sunset,
{15219}{15294}which would be groovy|for a Gemini and Libra.
{15296}{15342}We could write|our own ceremony.
{15344}{15417}Dave Freeland got|his papers from the|Universal Life Church.
{15419}{15468}So he could say the words.
{15470}{15556}I could wear that|white antique velvet|dress that I have, and...
{15558}{15605}What do you think?
{15606}{15669}Wow!
{15712}{15785}[Siren]|Oh, Jesus, a cop.|Ow!

{16008}{16066}Pull over.|Chew on this.
{16068}{16141}Stop!|We're trying to.
{16143}{16210}What do you want me to do?|Stop in the middle of the road?
{16212}{16265}Don't you have respect|for the law?|Keep going.
{16267}{16338}What kind of|officer are you?|What's he eating?
{16339}{16394}What's in|your mouth?|Nothing.

{16622}{16700}It's cool.|Roll the window down.
{16835}{16925}Sorry to disappoint you,|but we're on the natch.
{16926}{17005}Oh, yeah?|What do we got here?
{17007}{17061}Looks like|a narcotics substance to me.
{17063}{17143}It's one lousy joint.|You're under arrest, friend.
{17145}{17219}Ah! Come on, man!|You got nothing better to do|than hassle longhairs?

{27963}{28042}I'd better be getting|over to the dispensary.|The dispensary?
{28044}{28118}Yes, sir. The little people|put up a hell of a fight.

{127127}{127213}[Announcer]|Looks like some of the local drivers are|intentionally slowing down the pace...
{127215}{127272}trying to buy Milner some extra time.
{127273}{127383}From here, I can see the competitors who|are usually feuding with each other...
{127385}{127465}all helping out in Milner's cause.
{127466}{127510}Incredible.!|[Applause]
{127512}{127582}Here's the Hunt brothers'car|prepared for the kill.
{127584}{127682}They fully expect to win.|The factory demands they win.
{127946}{128002}Minutes to go, still no Milner.
{128004}{128054}Looks like the Hunt brothers|are about to demand...
{128056}{128122}a single run victory by default.
{128153}{128228}Carlos, you got|those plugs changed?|Yeah.
{128230}{128307}I got you some fuel here, John.|No, no.
{128309}{128385}I got my own mixture. 90%.|You'll blow your engine.
{128387}{128469}[Announcer]|Still no sign ofJohn Milner.|He knows the rules.
{128470}{128565}If you're not on the line in time,|you're disqualified.
{128704}{128761}Okay, we got it.|We'll never make it.
{128762}{128809}Come on, man.|Let's go!
{128810}{128908}[Announcer]|Frankly, it doesn't look good.|There's so little time left.
{128909}{129039}Probably a single run|for the Hunt brothers,|Milner losing by default.
{129041}{129068}But hold it!|Look over on the fire-up road.
{129069}{129169}Against all odds,|Milner has got it moving.!
{129578}{129684}Milner's made it to the line,|but that's just half of this|incredible mechanical miracle.
{129685}{129768}After all their patchwork, will the car|go straight down the track?
{129769}{129825}Will it go straight into|the guard rail?
{129826}{129867}It's a big gamble.
{129869}{129950}[Engine Rewing]
{129952}{130004}Think that front end|is gonna hold up?|I know it's gonna hold up.
{130045}{130092}[Announcer]|Nothing wrong with Milner's motor.|In fact,

Get those boats free!
Get back!
Let him go, let him go!
Clear the way!
Take it easy. No rushing.
Come on, Smith, in you get. l'm bloody hurt! l can't see!
Jesus Christ, help me!
Help!
My eyes, my eyes!
Jesus.
Shh!
Now, you're all right.
Lie down, please.
Now, lie down.
You're all right.
Lie down.
That's right.
Yes.
That's right.
Oh, Mother of Christ, l itch!
Midges. Very nasty.
Heart's sound enough.
What are you doing?
Who are you? l'm Dr. Hayden.
A lady doctor?
Now, face down, please.
We'll see about those bites of yours.
Lady, l'm stark bullocks naked!
We're all God's children,
Mr. Murphy, and l've seen plenty of backsides before.
You won't be beautiful for awhile.
But around here, it won't make any difference.
Where the ... am l?
Somewhere where we try to avoid that kind of language,
Mr. Murphy.
You're at Quiliapo Quaker
Medical Missionary.
There's nothing wrong with me... language.
Other side, please.
Do you not have a gentleman doctor?
Other side, please.
Yes, sir.
Lucky only the midges bit you.
Now, the piranha fish should've picked you clean down to the bones.
What are they doing?
Come on.
Try and relax.
Relax?
How can l relax with that bunch gawking at me?
Well, that ''bunch,'' as you call them, have never seen a naked white man.
Oh.
Well, they've had their thrill for the day.
Would you tell them to... leave immediately?
All things considered,
Mr. Murphy, l find your modesty rather touching. l'm sure we're going to get on splendidly.
Spendidly, spendidly...
Right. There you are.
How do you feel now?
Marvelous.
Now, you take this.
Holy...
You're a very lucky man.
You find anyone else?
We're still looking.
Poor suffering bastards. l've been trying to radio a message about you to Trinidad.
No luck yet, l'm afraid.
Oh, that's very unfortunate, but l'm in no rush.
Out there, they're killing people. l'll try again tomorrow.
What was the name of your ship?
The Mount Kyle.
Mount Kyle. lf you must radio something, tell them about that submarine.
And what submarine was that?
The ugly bum bastard that sunk us.
Hey, came up your river.
No. No, it didn't. l saw it. l think someone would have mentioned it. l'm telling you, it went straight past me.
Yes, well, you've been in a coma. lt was probably an alligator.
Well, this alligator had guns sticking from its nostrils.
Don't you worry about it.
Try and get some sleep.
Whatever it was, it's gone now.
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
She's...
She's a charmer.
She's beautiful.
Oh, holy, she's lovely.
Good for you.
Water.
Oh, so... it's you.
So, you-you've recovered!
Are you the fellow that...?
Yes, l found you!
God bless you. l salute your deeds.
Extraordinary.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.
From my position on the river, l can look to see.
Such a fight!
The flames!
Visible for miles!
Give a touch?
Uh... oh, yeah.
And out of them, but one man emerges.
One man.
Oh!
Truly heroic.
Nothing heroic, me old, son. lt came natural. l was saving me own skin.
The name's Murphy.
Louis Brezon.
How are you?
Fine.
Been fishing?
Oh, no.
No. l like to cook, l like to eat. l don't like to fish.
Oh.
What do you do here when you're not, uh, cooking or eating?
You play cards?
Holy Mother of...
Would you ever take me for a trip?
Of course. lt's a pleasure.
And then, we can talk about the British naval tradition, eh?
Naval tradition?
Yeah.
Getting drunk and catching the clap.
For which l have the greatest regard. lt seems that this war will be over soon.
Today on the wireless, they said Hitler has been killed.
Don't believe it.
He'll have lived through the winter.
How l envy you.
The hard glory of combat, the exhilaration.
Man is only truly alive when he confronts death.
He can also be truly dead.
Such a bitter thing.
A man like me, to be left in the backwash of the war. l begged them,
''Let me face the Germans.''
Oh, no, no.
They insisted my place was here, in charge of the equipment. l must admit, it is very valuable equipment.
This?
No, no, no.
No, the wharf where l live. l work for the oil company. l've been left in sole charge.
There are lndians on the river, who would strip off every bolt if they were not watched. l know the feeling. lf it isn't nailed down, it's mine.
How deep is this?
Deep. l personally supervise the dredging from the mouth of the river to the headquarters of my company.
Seagoing ships sailed.
Then a submarine could get up here.
Submarine?
A German submarine?
Why would one want to? l'm only asking if it could.
We have picked up a survivor from the Mount Kyle.
He believes the German submarine that sank the Mount Kyle came up the River Orinoco.
He asked me to tell you this.
Half a tick! l think they found somebody!
Well, now, Lieutenant.
From your ship?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Murphy. ln the flesh.
Anyone else?
No.
Oh, God. lt had to be you.
Did the U-boat give you a lift?
Don't be talking.
Any half decent officer would have sunk the bastard submarine.
Mr. Murphy, would you please stop talking to him. l beg your pardon.
This lady's a doctor.
She's a charmer.
You'll love her.
Murphy.
Any complaints? l managed to beach the plane.
But first find her, bring her in. ln? The plane? Why?
Patch her.
Now that's an order, Murphy.
Oh, well now.
Just bring her in, please. lmmediately, sir.
Uh, any notion where she is?
No, damn you. No.
Stop getting him excited.
Excited? Him?
Stupid boring English pilot.
Mr. Murphy, will you please shut up?
And when you're in the sun, would you try to remember to wear something on your head?
Well, look after him.
He's not a bad old skin considering...
You get out of the way, and l will get on with my job. lt's no job for a woman.
Louis, you speak the lingo?
Aye, l speak seven languages and five dialects.
French, German...
Then just ask them where the flaming airplane is.
Yeah.
What is all this ridiculous...
Wait a minute.
Dr. Hayden.
No, no, l'm afraid l...
You have, uh, enemy survivors here.
This is a hospital, Captain. l must know where...
Hospital here.
No, he mustn't be moved.
He's badly hurt.
Please, l don't understand...
No, he's badly hurt.
He's ill. lll.
But, Captain...
Necessity.
Find... uh, not to find.
Responsibility.
Tonight, Air Force fliers who have been cooperating with the Third Army ground forces in Czechoslovakia, and they give me a fantastic picture.
One of them told me he saw columns of...
...ten miles long on several roads.
...away from the Russians, toward us. ln those columns were both soldiers and civilians.
You were right.
There was a German submarine.
They came up here and shot him.
Bastards. l'm bewildered, Mr. Murphy. l mean, why...?
What happened out there?
They shot the entire crew in the water.
Every suffering...
Except me.
Flying jacket. l didn't see that.
You weren't intended to.
He didn't want them to know there was an airplane.
Thank you...
Flying Officer Murphy.
Cover him up and say some words.
He was a particular friend of yours, wasn't...?
An officer? l got the impression you rather liked him.
Come on, Louis, take her up, take her up!
Easy, Louis.
Easy.
Easy, easy, easy!
Forward!
Good on you, Louis.
Your blood's worth bottling.
You know machines?
What?
You know machines? l love them. l've got a feeling l've found her lt was something she said
She's got me walking on the tip of my toes
And my hat's on the side of my head
All of my troubles are mended
She's my needle and thread
She's got me walking on the tip of my toes
And my hat's on the side of my head... l've got a feeling l've found her lt was something she said...
All along Thomas Street down by the Liffe
The sunshine was gone and the evening grew dark
Me arms were around her...
Ah, you're doing well, me old frog-eater.
The company will give you a gold watch. l shall be happy with my four years' back pay.
Four years?
Yeah.
That's an awful lot of pennies.
You sure they're good for it? lt is a very reliable company. l have full confidence in their integrity, and if not, l will write them a letter.
Can you fly?
Who do you think kept this flying lavatory together?
Every scrap of her is in me fingers.
Yes, but can you fly her?
Don't worry, my old son, l'll get her up.
And if you do? l'll find that bastard bum submarine.
What about getting her down?
Ah, that l know l can do.
Forgive me, but are you sure that, uh... hmm?
Stop blathering, lad!
The war will be over before l do anything!
Now, shut up and cast me off.
Madness.
Come on.
Swing me around.
Fly, you bastard! Fly!
Fool.
Oh, Louis! Louis! Louis!
The feeling!
Oh, Jesus!
No submarine?
Y-You're a bird!
Yeah, but you didn't find the submarine.
Certainly l found her.
Sitting on its fast ass up the river.
But they didn't see you?
Certainly they saw me.
Now, uh, a couple of things to do-- some kip, then l'm going back.
For what purpose are you going back? l'm going to sink her.
You see it fly up?
Whoom... you see. l got it up over the trees.
But you have no weapons.
Petrol.
But the bitch keeps trying to drag ya down.
But if you give it a bit more stick-- just like a woman...
-Petrol?
-Yeah, petrol.
But what are you going to do with petrol?
...a bit more throttle, you see...
But they have guns on the submarine?
Yeah, a big bastard in the front and then a little fellow afterwards.
Up she goes!
And of course they will let you pour petrol all over them and then watch you put a match to it.
They might.
They might just do that.
They might.
They might, yes.
They possess your lack of common sense.
Ah, don't be...
Morning, sir.
What are you doing?
Uh, just borrowing a couple of your bottles.
Really?
What on earth for?
Uh, l'm refueling the plane, then l'll be flying off. l take it your experiments with the plane were successful.
Great, great.
Have you been taking your tablets?
Oh, yes.
Well, then, there's really nothing to keep you, is there?
How soon will you be going?
Shortly. l'd be so grateful if you'd do something for me. l'll make up a list of things we need here.
Would you be good enough to take it with you?
Oh, certainly.
Oh, that's marv.
Thank you very much.
Okay, Louis, the timer.
Louis, the doctor lady-- she's a Quaker.
Mm-hmm.
That's like being a bloody nun, isn't it?
No. l don't think so.
Why couldn't she be a young nurse?
Something practical.
Light the fuse, please.
She has fair form.
Do you ever have any, uh... ?
Four seconds.
Never take a crack? l have great respect for her.
Now.
Provide an essential service by piloting her from here to there in my boat.
Six seconds.
Six seconds?
Yeah.
Two and half feet at...
And that's about nine inches a second.
Here, try the long fellow.
Hmm.
See if it stays the same.
How long have you been here,
Louis?
On your lonesome?
Oh, about six and half years now.
Six and a half years.
That's an awful long time. l've known fellows without it for six months, go bald.
Eight seconds.
Bald?
But this is not my property.
The company only uses explosives in case of oil fire.
Exactly.
Murphy.
Aah, shut up.
No. What would l say to my company?
Show them your...
All right.
Be careful with it,
Murphy, please.
Don't worry. l know what l'm doing.
How did you learn to make bombs?
From watching me daddy who made them for noble causes.
Now, hold that.
There.
You have the whole of it...
On the radio, they say they are surrendering everywhere. lt's only a question of hours now before peace is declared.
They say the ltalians... lt works! lt works!
Okay, my son.
Hello.
What a delightful hat you're wearing, Mr. Murphy.
You like it? l always did.
You outta nail it down.
Here it is.
You see, l've listed everything in order of priority.
One-- see that's delivered to the Society of Friends in London.
-Right you be.
-Two-- tell your people it's imperative we have a new transmitter.
Right you be.
-Three--
-Jesus! take your tablets.
Now.
Uh, if l was you, missus, l wouldn't stand there.
This fellow makes an awful clatter...
Oh. Oh, yes, certainly.
Yes, of course.
Way to go, Louis!
Good luck.
Thank you.
Okay, Louis, take him up.
What are the bottles doing there, Louis?
Bottles?
Those are the world's largest
Molotov cocktail bombs.
Bombs?
Come on, Louis!
Take her up! Take her up!
But what are they for?
He intends to drop them on the submarine.
He's mad!
Okay, Louis, swing her out.
Murphy, you can't do this!
Why not?
Louis, stop that thing!
Louis, start that thing.
This is pointless!
The war's almost over.
Listen to her, Murphy.
She may be right.
Louis, if you don't lower me down, l'll gut you.
No, Louis. Don't!
This is so wrong!
Tell that to the bastards on the bottom of the ocean! l know how you feel, and what they did was dreadful, but one senseless killing after another...
Killing? lf l'm lucky.
And if you're not lucky, have you thought what might happen to us here?
Don't worry, missus.
They'll be nothing left of them Germans but shit.
You're enjoying it!
That's right.
You love your war, don't you?
The war?
Yeah. l started it.
The whole flaming thing, didn't l?
Will you think?
Don't worry, missus. lt isn't really a submarine. lt's just a little old alligator, remember?
You mindless bastard! l sunk the whore, Louis.
The whole flaming issue up in the air.
Yes, l know. She told me.
-She told you, huh?
-Yeah.
Yeah, she stuck a blunt needle in me.
You can help me raise him,
Louis.
Mm-hmm.
Now, gently does it.
W-What's going on now?
You have a fractured rib.
Keep still.
Thank you, Louis.
Put your arms out.
Oh, Louis, you should have been there. lt was beautiful. l wish l had been there.
Not so tight.
Frankly, l'd like to choke you with it.
Onward, Christian soldiers
Marching... Ooh! l am so happy for you.
Ah, Jesus, careful.
Yes, please, be careful.
We have to look after him.
He has been through a great ordeal.
Thank you for your advice,
Louis. l'll try to do my best for your hero.
Meanwhile, would you revert to your usual practice of saying and doing nothing?
He doesn't need your support.
You shouldn't have said that to Louis.
He's a good old froggy.
You have an awful tongue on you.
Would you lie down, please?
Ah, come on.
What's wrong with you?
We should be celebrating.
Celebrating what, Mr. Murphy?
Your arrival here?
Or the death of those Germans?
What's that for? lt's going to put you to sleep.
Hope you sharpened it this time.
Don't make me waste this.
We haven't much of it left.
You don't have a drop of something...?
No.
Ah, no whiskey in the house, no light in the window, no welcome at the door.
Call me wealthy.
What are you grinning for?
Give us a kiss.
Good night, Mr. Murphy.
And what's it to anyone whether or no
Whether l'm easy or whether l'm true...?
Louis? l'm sorry, Louis.
Forgive me. l was upset.
That Murphy seems to affect us all. lt's not necessary to discuss it.
We have been friends for a long time. l didn't mean what l said.
Without you...
Good night, Louis.
Fire!
Where is he, Doctor?
Mr. Murphy?!
Murphy!
Missus.
Missus.
Murphy?
Here. l thought l'd sunk her. l didn't.
No.
Sorry for your trouble. lt's over now.
Louis!
Yeah.
They didn't find you?
Oh, no.
How are you?
Sound.
Dr. Hayden?
She's okay.
Submarine attacked the village.
Yes.
But l saw...
Yes, yes, me, too.
Have to go and help...
Did they touch the barge?
No, not at all. No.
When's the last time you took it out? lt's about... about six years ago.
Actually, it's a funny story because...
Yeah, come with me...
This is London calling.
Here is a recorded dispatch from Chester Wilmot.
The dispatch comes from Germany.
Hello, BBC.
This is Chester Wilmot speaking from a BBC transmitter in northern Germany.
This afternoon at 6:30,
British Double Summer Time, at Field Marshall Montgomery's tactical headquarters,
German plenipotentiaries signed the documents which will end the war in Europe for the 21st Army group at 8:00 tomorrow morning.
That means the surrender of...
The German war is therefore at an end.
After years of intense struggle...
Why did you do that?
Another bloody bullfight.
Ole, ole, ole.
Driving me crackers.
What the hell are we doing? l'm going to kill that submarine.
With what? l'm going to ram her with this.
With my house?!
Aw, don't fret.
The bullets will bounce off her.
Will they bounce off people?
Mr. Murphy!
Mr. Murphy.
Mr. Murphy!
The war is over!
Mr. Murphy!
Louis!
Louis, the war is over!
She's shouting something.
Another flamin' lecture!
Now get down and check the engines.
Ah, l can operate from here.
Will you just check the bloody things?
English.
English!
Can't be talking to me.
War end.
Finished.
Turn ship or l'll attack.
What will he do?
Pull out and try and set us up for a torpedo.
But you said nothing about torpedo.
Must have forgot.
War over!
Germany surrendered!
Now, give me full speed when l ask for it, and then reverse.
But don't you hear?
Murphy, the war is over.
Their war, not mine.
The war is over.
Full speed!
Fire.
Here it comes.
Full ahead port!
Missed. lt's going to hit the beach!
Come on, my son.
Come on.
Come on, my son!
Come on, my son!
Missed the bastard!
Three feet!
Full reverse starboard!
What more can we do? l'm going to follow him.
Follow him?
Here?
There's nothing else l can do.
Now, full ahead.
Louis... cut the engines.
What does it mean? l don't know.
Could be blowing air from his tanks.
He's run... he's... he's run his bow on the bank.
We have him, Louis!
Full speed ahead!
We have the bastard!
Come on!
Hey.
You're running aground!
Lower the jib.
Lower the jib!
Come on, come on.
More wire.
Give me more wire.
Whatcha doing?
Their lines are bursting.
He's not even in trouble.
Let her die in peace.
He'll get out!
And l will never find him!
Possibly, possibly not. l have done enough!
Louis! l'm not able on my own!
You're a small and lonely man, Murphy-- like me.
The world will never build us a monument.
The difference is, l know that. l have you!
Jesus!
She's got me walkin' on the tip of my toes
And my hat's on the side of my head
All of my troubles are mended
She's my needle and thread
She's got me walkin' on the tip of my toes
And my hat's on the side of my head
Oh, that wonderful smile
Oh, l fell from the start
You should listen awhile
To the thump thumping of my poor old heart
We've got a wonderful future
One that's rosy and red
She's got me walkin' on the tip of my toes
And my hat's on the side of my head.
In Milan, I promised to take you along with me.
It was a precise promise.
They will let us pass but we'll have to hand over all the fascists in the convoy.
You can't accept these conditions.
It would be a betrayal!
I'm only concerned about the safety of my men, is that clear?
Can we trust them?
All the Germans who have surrender were allowed to pass the border.
But we have special orders to get to Merano.
I signed the conditions on behalf of my men.
My orders come from the Führer!
If your orders require you to stay with the Duce, stay and fight.
I am just responsible for the safety of my men.
The area we passed through was swarming with partisans and the bridges are mined.
I am just responsible for my men.
Let's go!
- How do we tell this to Mussolini?
- God only knows!
The Germans are going! They're leaving us in the hands of the partisans!
The Germans are going! They've been authorized to pass the border!
- Calm down. What happened?
- This is the end.
The Germans are going to leave us in the hands of these bandits!
But it would be betrayal!
Who said that?
We're moving out.
Get the engines started.
We're moving out!
Only the Germans will pass through!
Throw out the Italians if necessary use your guns!
Do you hear me? Get ready!
Lieutenant.
I have an idea that might work.
I'm afraid it's too late.
I have given my word.
Listen, we could have Mussolini putting on a German uniform, and hide him on board with the soldiers.
The partisans wouldn't notice him.
Lieutenant!
This is a Führer's personal wish.
Don't forget it.
Alright.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- Tell me something! What's going on?
- Calm down.
I don't understand!
- We're all going to get killed!
- Please, calm down!
If the partisans find out the Duce is with us, it'll be the end.
- They're going to kill us!
- Calm down, please.
- Calm down, Mrs Petacci.
- We're all going to die.
Excellency? I suggest you put on a German overcoat and helmet and hide in one of the trucks.
It's your only chance to get through.
There's no time. Fallmeyer's convoy is preparing to move immediately.
Excellency.
Go with the Germans.
Save yourself.
Please don't worry about me.
You must save yourself.
Captain.
I ask you a personal favour.
Let the lady come with me.
It's impossible, only you.
Move this block!
Duce! Are we going to surrender without even an attempt to fight?
- It would be useless.
- It's true then, you're deserting us!
How dare you say I'm deserting you!
You who promised me thousands of black shirts!
I ordered you to destroy the partisans and what did you do?
Nothing!
Excellency!
Let's go!
Duce, it's true that we didn't defeat the partisans but since you were in Milan, you had just one thought in your mind.
To pass the border!
And now you're leaving alone, and dressed as a German!
Let him sit.
- Traitors!
- Cowards!
Traitors!
Let me in!
Let me go with him!
Don't leave me here!
I beg you!
Help me!
Let me in!
I want to go with him!
I don't want to leave him!
I can't leave him!
Don't you understand?
Help me to get in!
I want to go with him!
Get out!
We'll stay here to take care of the fascists.
Check all the trucks when they get to Dongo. Go!
If it wasn't for you, Duce.
Hitler would never have become Führer.
No one can wear a uniform like our Duce!
- He looks like a God.
- He is God!
Throw down you guns and form a group!
You must guarantee we'll be treated according to the International Convention.
Drop that gun!
Group up against the wall!
ONLY GOD CAN BEND THE WILL OF
FASCISTS, NEVER MEN OR THINGS
- Where's Pedro?
- I don't know.
- Do you know where Pedro is?
- No.
- What about Bili?
- He was here.
He's drunk!
Hey, camerata, wake up.
Excellency, wake up.
Benito Mussolini, come on, wake up.
Benito Mussolini, I arrest you in the name of the Italian people.
As long as you are under our protection, you won't be harmed.
No question, the partisans are about to attack!
General Wolff has probably signed the surrender by now.
We rejected the partisan's ultimatum.
Lieutenant, we have nothing to do with this.
Deal with it, we didn't invite you here!
Where did you expect us to go?
Hold your fire!
The German commander has accepted your surrender!
Hold your fire!
What are you shooting for?
Marshall, you must do something before it's too late!
- What's going on outside?
- The Americans have arrived!
- Give yourselves up!
- Not until I have orders from Milan!
Call Milan, then!
It's useless to keep fighting!
The Germans have already surrendered.
Don't move!
Let me speak!
I'm Marshall Graziani,
Commander of the fascist Army.
I'm Captain Jack Donati. From now on, you're under US army protection.
- Where is Mussolini?
- I don't know.
I lost contact with him two days ago.
Our last information had him travelling north with a German convoy.
- Others say the partisans have him.
- May I ask what you intend to do to guarantee my personal safety?
I'm taking you to Milan.
I must talk to General Cadorna.
He's the only one who can tell me where Mussolini is.
- I hoped you would be able to.
- All I know is that he abandoned us!
Cold?
Don't you want to keep it as a souvenir?
What are you thinking?
I was thinking about two years ago, when the King dissolved my government.
All I wanted was to retire from politics and to live the rest of my life in peace.
It would have been better for everyone.
Do you have orders to shoot me?
- At least tell me where we're going.
- To Germasino.
It's a village in the mountains.
No one will think of looking for you there.
What will you do to my fascists?
Will they be treated according to the Geneva Convention?
- We are prisoners of war...
- You committed all sorts of atrocities!
Even worse than the Germans!
Those weren't my orders.
The Duce was always against violence.
What about the Civil War?
The fascists killing women and children?
The sackings, the burnt villages, the slaughters, the tortures and the killing of prisoners?
Where was the Geneva Convention them?
That was Hitler's fault.
Was anything ever your fault?
It's freezing, here. Any chance of getting the stove working?
I've set up the guard.
I'm going down to Dongo, watch them carefully.
Alright, we'll take shifts.
Is there anything you need?
Yes.
Please, do me a favour.
Find the lady and tell her that I'm still alive.
Mrs Petaccia?
Alright.
I wrote him my first love letter when I was twelve years old.
It's absurd isn't it?
I was just a little girl.
When I was fourteen
I invited him to my birthday party and I made the whole family wait for him because I was so sure he would come!
Even then, I always thought of him as a perfect man.
He was my ideal of a real man, because he is a real man, you know!
When I met him,
I felt that I belonged to him.
I was just 18, then.
Please, do me a favour.
I beg you.
You can do anything you want with me,
I can do any kind of job even the most menial, I don't care.
But please, don't harm him.
He's a weak man, now.
He's a sick, broken, weak man.
Please don't hurt him, I beg you!
Nothing's going to happen to him, unless someone tries to free him.
Nobody will try to save him.
If you had been with him the last few days you'd have seen how everyone abandoned him.
They all ran away.
He ran away too, dressed as a German soldier.
He has deserted his own men to save his own life, hasn't he?
Anyway, for the moment, he's in no danger.
- Please, I want to ask you a favour.
- I'll do what I can.
Let me be with him.
What harm can there be?
Please, let me be with him.
Look, if something were to happen to him it would happen to you too.
You're going to shoot him?
We want him transferred to Milan, to be tried by a popular jury.
If you give him to the Americans, he'll be treated as a prisoner of war!
It's got nothing to do with them!
He will be judged by the Italian people.
- Then why did you hide him?
- To protect him!
From the crowd, from a lynching.
A lynching? What do you mean?
Today, he's the most hated man in Italy.
He's responsible for all the atrocities that the Germans and fascists committed!
A lot of people around here have lost relatives, killed because of him.
Killed by the fascists!
Women and children too!
That was the war, it wasn't his fault.
It's not fair!
Fascism did a lot of good for Italy, before the war!
It brought us to ruin!
Look.
This is fascism.
Do you know what these are?
Wedding rings offered by the Italian women.
"Give your gold to your country", they said!
Do you know where we found them?
In the cars of the fascists who were running away!
Too many women in Italy are crying for their men!
Husbands and sons tortured, deported, murdered!
Cigarette?
Thank you.
You're very kind.
You must promise me one thing.
If he's going to be shot,
I want to be shot with him.
I have no authority to make you such a promise.
Please.
I must be with him.
I can't let him die alone.
I must be with him!
Please, he's all I got.
And I'm all he's got.
Now that everyone else has left him
I want to be with him.
Let me stay with him.
Please!
I beg you!
Latest word had him arrested at Dongo.
Now, it seems that the partisans have hidden him in a secret resort.
- They'll tell us where he is.
- Question is, who will go and get him?
And what to do with him when we have him in our hands?
- Mattei, what do you say?
- It's simple.
The Liberation Committee resolution is very clear.
"Fascist leaders who have betrayed
Italy, have been sentenced to death".
They only have to be identified and then brought in front of a firing squad.
Pietro, do you want to go with your men?
I'll provide the men.
But personally would rather stay here.
Why?
Why? There are still 20,000 armed Germans in Milan.
Until they've surrounded their weapons, that's my first duty.
They're locked in the barracks but my men are the only ones watching them.
It's better that I stay here.
Do you want to go, Valerio?
Alright.
But I'll need vehicles, passes and an escort.
The Como area is still full of fascists.
You'll have to go to General Cadorna for everything.
The Americans have already reached Como.
Leave as soon as you can. Do you understand what you have to do?
- I understand perfectly.
- Then go.
What will we tell the Americans?
They're bombarding us with messages demanding we hand
Mussolini over to them.
We'll tell them that Mussolini has already been shot.
General Cadorna?
This is Colonel Sardagna from Como.
Yes, I have just received your order, but I am not sure I understand.
The Liberation Committee is about to send one of their people to get Mussolini.
For a number of reasons, it'd be better if you transfer him before they get there.
We have to avoid shooting in case of an escape attempt.
Right now, Mussolini is in a Germasino, just above Dongo.
I'll send an escort to take him from Dongo to Como where I shall personally take charge of him.
Once he's in Como, I'll arrange to have him taken to the Bresso airport.
If the Anglo-Americans ask us to hand him over we'll have to take him to the Allied headquarters.
I've been asked if it is possible to save
Claretta Petacci along with Mussolini.
You're free to do what you like about that.
I see.
In 1940, everybody asked me,
"Mussolini, why don't you enter the war?"
"Otherwise, Hitler will grab it all!"
I didn't want to go to war, but today, they all say,
"Find Mussolini! Get him!
Kill Mussolini!"
So, you believe the people asked for the war?
And today, they put the blame on you!
You know what?
The people can't decide for themselves.
They just have to obey.
- Now you're sincere!
- Hitler is crazy.
His biggest mistake was declaring war on Russia.
- I tried to stop him.
- Lf he's crazy, why did you follow him?
Why didn't you turn your back on him?
I always tried to stop him.
He wouldn't listen.
But you were his teacher!
Who was his role model?
You! Who started to persecute the opposition and the workers unions?
Who abolished the free press and the parliament? You!
Who sent Italian men to fight in Abyssinia and Spain?
Who sent them to fight in Greece, or to freeze in Russia?
Not Hitler!
You!
Excellency, would you write a couple of lines for us?
About what?
A declaration to the effect that it was our brigade who arrested you.
What do you want me to write?
The 52nd Garibaldi Brigade...
"The 52nd
Garibaldi Brigade"
Captured me today...
"Captured me today"
April 27th...
"April 27th"
In the town square in Dongo.
"In the town square in Dongo".
Excellency, write about the kind of treatment you received.
"The treatment I've received during and after capture has been correct".
The Committee has decided to execute Mussolini.
My mission is to go to Dongo and shoot him.
The Americans are near Como and they're asking us to turn him over to them, alive.
They have the right on the basis of Article 29 of the Malta armistice.
But that armistice was signed two years ago by Badoglio.
- We're not bound by it.
- Yes, we are.
Badoglio's signature bound all Italians.
Please.
Sure.
Fact is, in the last two years, many things have changed.
Mussolini's been sentenced to death many times by the people by the resistance, by those partisans with whom you have fought with, here in the North.
He's responsible for the massacres committed by the fascists.
- We must execute him.
- Why come to me?
General, I need vehicles and an escort.
And Italian and American passes to enter the liberated areas.
So?
What do I tell the Committee?
- In two hours you'll have what you need.
- Good.
That's good.
No, it's better not to show this.
This is good.
With England still fighting Hitler's attack on Russia means we're finished.
But Germany is invincible.
You have to remember that Russia has three great generals.
General Snow, General Mud and General Distance.
No one's ever beaten them.
Camerati!
With allies like these, we can conquer the world.
I want to march by Hitler's side into Russia.
The alliance between
Germans and Italians will destroy bolshevism throughout the world.
Long live fascism!
Victory will be ours!
Duce! Duce!
Duce! Duce! Duce!
Duce! Duce!
We've received orders to leave.
What's that?
We're going to bandage your head and say you're wounded.
We have to cover about fifty kms and there are dozens of road blocks.
- I'm not going to wear this.
- Why?
Because it's German.
And I hate the Germans.
It's cold tonight.
Here.
Put this on.
Excellency.
- Are you wounded?
- No, it's nothing.
It's just a precaution.
- Claretta.
- What?
Why did you want to come with me?
It could be dangerous.
- I know, but that's the way I want it.
- You sure?
Yes.
Then I thank you.
Please, madam, let's go.
Good thing I met you.
We soldiers, understand each other.
- I hope Milan it's not far.
- No, we're almost there.
Quick, in my car!
On the way from Como to Milan.
They shot at us at least four times.
- Yesterday, they even shot at me.
- Chaos reigns, here.
They're hunting the fascists like madmen!
Snipers are everywhere.
We must stop them!
- Please.
- Attention!
At ease.
This is the end of a civil war, captain.
Sit down, please.
Excuse me, General, about those passes.
- I'm going to check if they're ready.
- Alright.
- Any news of Mussolini, General?
- Nothing accurate.
Remember that, according to the clauses of the armistice you are obliged to turn him over to us, alive.
We're moving carefully.
Wherever he is, Mussolini is in danger.
One mistake and he'll be in front of the firing squad.
After two years of occupation, people are angry.
They don't care about the armistice's articles.
But why do you want Mussolini so much?
A matter of prestige, I think.
Also, we believe that he might give us military and political information.
But he knew nothing.
Mussolini was just a puppet in the German's hands.
Captain, here's the passes.
These are the authorizations for the partisans to move in the free areas.
Fine.
A couple of hours of sleep and I'll be ready.
Goodbye, General.
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye, Captain.
And thank you.
General, I'm on my way to Dongo.
My escort is made up of twelve men from the Oltrepo Pavese Division.
Here's the passes.
Nervous?
Nervous? No.
My men and I have already faced the fascists and the Germans before.
But this time I think we'll have to worry more about an attack from behind.
I'm talking about our British and American allies, you know?
Don't worry about them.
But, remember, no personal vendettas.
When we were in exile, in the resistance or in the fascist prisons most of us dreamt of getting
Mussolini to execute him.
Now, it's different, because we've won.
It's not a question of personal vendetta anymore.
Goodbye.
"To General Archimede Mischi commander-in-chief of the Italian army.
I read your plans in the fight against partisan banditry.
I think it's vibrant and enthralling.
I'm sure that actions will follow your words.
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron.
Signed, Mussolini".
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron.
Signed, Mussolini.
We have to get rid of this hateful plague with fire and iron.
Signed, Mussolini.
- Where are we?
- Don't worry, I'll be back in a minute.
Did you hear?
These are cannon shots.
Yes, I hear.
I want to check out the situation before going any farther.
I know a guy who lives here.
I'll be right back.
We should have stayed in Germasino.
- The orders said to reach Como.
- I don't think it's safe.
The Americans must have reached Como.
They're the only ones with flares that strong.
- What do we do now?
- We'll carry on avoiding Como.
Where could we go, Neri?
I know a peasant family who lives here.
They'll take him in.
- Where?
- Not far, in a place called Giulino.
Let's go, then.
These are two prisoners.
Can you shelter them overnight?
Yes.
Alright, take them in.
Pietro, let's leave them here for the night, tomorrow we'll see.
Do you think we can trust these people?
If the room upstairs is free, they'll sleep there.
Would you like something to drink?
Thanks. I'd like some coffee, if possible. You, dear?
I don't have any real coffee,
I can make you some substitute.
- That's fine, thank you.
- I'll get the room ready.
- You can come with us, if you want.
- For tonight it's all set, you can sleep.
We're going to Dongo to check the situation.
Alright.
Sandro, we'll be back tomorrow morning.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Please, would it be possible to have another pillow?
Of course!
If you need to use the bathroom.
I'll show you the way.
Maybe later, thank you.
Look, this door has to stay open.
We can't let you out of our sight.
Can I ask a favour of you?
Please.
Let us close the door.
The lady needs to rest.
Please, can I close it?
Thank you.
Are you sure that this pass is authentic?
I know Donati personally.
I was in contact with him in Switzerland.
That's his signature.
I want your co-operation.
- I have to transfer Mussolini to Milan.
- We're going to put him in the Como jail.
We'll handle this transfer ourselves.
I greatly appreciate your organization.
But let's say I prefer to handle this particular situation by myself.
This is an unwarranted interference by the Milan committee!
That's what you think!
I've got American authorization, signed by Captain Jack Donati.
That's just a pass to enter the free areas.
It's not a warrant for Mussolini!
Thousands of black shirts were forced to surrender by our committee!
Milan has no right to take credit for arresting Mussolini from Como!
It's not a question of Milan or Como!
It's something which has to be done!
I was sent here by the General
Command of the Liberty corps in complete agreement with Alt Italia Committee of Liberation!
I have been given orders, and I'm going to carry them out, at all costs!
- Look, I've already told you...
- Gentlemen!
I have twelve armed men along with me with whom I've solved tougher problems than your stupid objections.
So, either you stop interfering with my mission or you'll find yourselves filling the jail cells you prepared for Mussolini.
No doubt about it, now.
We have proof they want to turn him over to the Americans.
They say we are trying to steal the glory of the arrest and they want to transfer him to Milan themselves.
Enough.
Mussolini has to be shot.
Valerio, I'm speaking on behalf of the Committee.
Either you kill him, or we kill you.
That's an order!
Alright.
I'm leaving for Dongo now.
You won't hear from me again till it's all over.
Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Would you like something to eat?
Well, yes, if possible.
We're rather hungry.
- Do you have something warm?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, our salami is very good.
Would you like some wine, too?
No, no.
No wine.
Just water for me.
Thank you.
How are you feeling this morning?
A little better?
A little better, yes.
They're being nice with us.
I think that's a good sign, isn't it?
Why are the Americans taking so long?
- Who are those two in the car?
- Two patriots, I personally guarantee.
Good morning.
Get out of there immediately.
I don't want stripes in my way.
You have no right.
You will answer for this!
I'm accountable only to my command and no one else.
You don't know who we are. You should stand to attention when you talk to us!
Why? Who are you?
We represent the Free Government of Rome!
We're in charge of liaison with the Americans.
Wonderful. Just what I needed!
If you don't get out of here immediately,
I'll put a bullet in your skulls!
Come on, boys, it's late!
Get on the truck.
You two, get lost!
And have fun in Como!
- But, Colonel...
- Get in the car!
Keep going, we've got no time to lose!
Damn, we caused a stir!
What are you afraid of?
They're friends, aren't they?
We'll apologize on the way back!
Hey, stop!
Who are you?
I'm from HQ in Milan. I need to speak with your commanding officer.
Listen, Mussolini isn't here.
They took him away.
What are you talking about?
They tried to transfer him last night, but failed.
Now they're hiding him in a farmhouse in the hills.
Who's the commanding officer here?
Valerio, the best thing to do is act as if you don't know anything.
I've already found out where he is.
Oh, here he is.
Pedro says that if you want to talk you'll have to go to him unarmed.
What?
Have you all gone mad?
Colonel let us speak first, please.
Come here, quick.
Let's try to follow the normal procedures.
Colonel Valerio,
I want to talk to you alone.
Pedro, the political commander of the brigade will be here in a few minutes.
- Look, we've got to be there as well.
- Just a second!
Do you know these two guys from Como?
I would have saluted them, if I did.
They're boycotting our mission, acting like double-dealers.
What are we talking about?
You know who we are!
- Take them!
- Stop! What are you doing!
I'm Sforni, secretary of the National
Liberation Committee of Como!
- And this is Major De Angelis!
- I want to see your documents.
We were in a hurry, we didn't take them!
We'll verify your identity later, then.
- Arrest them!
- What are you doing?
This is a mistake!
Have you all gone mad?
Okay, let's go.
- Where are Mussolini and his men?
- Mussolini is hidden in a farmhouse.
The others are in Germasino.
Guido, Neri. Come up here.
- What's up?
- The men from Milan have arrived.
- Damn, and you let them in?
- Pedro spoke to them.
- Who are these men?
- They're the escort.
Pietro!
We met him in Milan.
You can trust him.
Check his papers.
We assure you they're in order.
This is Pietro, the Political
Commissioner of our brigade.
Sorry about all this but we still have difficulty in getting in touch with General Command.
We've just come out of clandestiny and we don't know each other.
We're even discovered some fascists dressed as partisans!
Anyway, your papers are in order.
What's your mission?
My orders are to shoot
Mussolini and the others.
And I mean to do it now, within and hour.
I don't agree. I intend to hand them over to the General Command to avoid any attempt at an execution without a trial.
But we must shoot them before they fall into the hands of the Americans!
Their troops are only a few kilometres from here!
I don't want the Americans to get them either.
- We'll take them to Milan together.
- I have precise orders!
And I mean to carry them out whether you like them or not!
To me, those orders are not just!
What, are you trying to save his neck?
The man's a criminal!
I agree. He'll have to pay, and pay hard.
That's exactly what I'm proposing to do, make him pay!
What I object to, is an execution without a trial.
Mussolini and his accomplices have already been regularly condemned to death.
There's a Liberation Committee decree signed by all the antifascist parties.
Then, let's join forces and transfer him to Milan.
Impossible!
Can't you see that they're all out to get him?
The Americans, the British agents coming from south.
We saw them ourselves with our own eyes.
The cowardice and the doubts are starting to surface already.
The compromises, the filth that we wanted to wipe out once and for all!
Either we shoot him now, or he'll never pay.
The National Liberation Committee decreed that the sentence for acts of treason committed by hierarchs be pronounced by a war tribunal.
Commander Pedro.
We are the war tribunal.
"The 52nd brigade Command acting as a war tribunal can issue the sentence on the basis of the identification of the accused".
- What's your name?
- Giovan Battista Germinazza.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, I was just curious.
I wanted to see Mussolini and Petacci.
- They say she's very hot!
- Is that your car?
No, my boss's.
He has a villa near here.
- I'm the only driver.
- Any gasoline in it?
- Yes
- Stay here.
You and your car have just been requisitioned by the 52nd brigade.
But... listen...
- I found a car.
- Good. Take the road to Como.
- Hey, where are we going?
- He'll show you the way!
Can't we go any faster?
- I said faster!
- You want to finish up in the lake?
Aren't you a driver?
- So what?
- Then drive!
At the crossroad, take the road to Giulino Di Mezzegra.
This way.
- We can go now.
- Where?
Get back onto the road to the lake.
THE PLOGH
FURROWS THE GROUND
BUT IT IS THE SWORD
WHICH DEFENDS IT
Stop here.
Go and block the curve.
Get down.
You stay here.
You go and don't let anyone near.
Move the car away.
Get out of the way!
- You can't kill him!
- Get away!
- You can't kill him!
- Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- Get away!
- No!
By order of the general command of the corps of Volunteers for Liberty
I am in charge of rendering justice to the Italian people.
Pietro, give me your gun!
- No! Don't shoot!
- Back off!
- Get away!
- Don't shoot him!
- Don't shoot him!
- I told you to get away!
Two hours later, in the Dongo Town Square as decreed by article 5 of the Justice Ordiance issued by the National
Libertation Committee
15 out of the 75 men arrested with Mussolini were shot by the partisans.
APRIL 29, 1945
The National Liberation
Committee of Northern Italy declares that the execution of Mussolini and his accomplices is the necessary conclusion of a historic period which leaves our country in material and moral ruin and it is the conclusion of an insurrection struggle that marks the premise of the country's rebirth and reconstruction.

Corporal Barry, eight paces forward...
... march!
Corporal Barry.
You're a gallant soldier, and evidently of good stock...
...but you're idle and unprincipled.
You're a bad influence on the men.
And for all your bravery,
I'm sure you'll come to no good.
I hope the Colonel is mistaken.
I have fallen into bad company, but I've only done as other soldiers do.
I've never had a friend or protector before...
...to show that I was worthy of better things.
The Colonel may say I'm ruined, and send me to the Devil.
But, I would go to the Devil to serve the Regiment.
Corporal Barry, fall in.
The war ended and Barry's regiment
was garrisoned in the Capital.
He had, for some time, ingratiated himself
with Captain Potzdorf...
... whose confidence in him
was about to bring its reward.
Good morning, Redmond.
Good morning, Captain.
I should like you to meet my uncle, the Minister of Police.
Good morning, Herr Minister.
Redmond...
...I've spoken to the Minister regarding your services and your fortune is made.
We shall get you out of the Army...
...appoint you to the Police Bureau, and, in time...
...we'll allow you to move in a better sphere.
Thank you, Captain.
Your loyalty to me and service to the Regiment has pleased me.
Now there is another occasion on which you can assist us.
If you succeed...
...your reward will be secure.
I'll do my best, sir.
There is a gentleman in Berlin in the service of the Empress of Austria.
He calls himself the Chevalier de Balibari.
He appears to be a professional gambler.
He's a libertine:
Fond of women, of good food...
...polished, obliging.
He speaks French and German indifferently.
But we have reason to fancy that Monsieur de Balibari...
...is a native of your country of Ireland.
And that he has come here as a spy.
Your knowledge of English...
...makes you an ideal choice to go into his service...
...and find out whether or not he is a spy.
Does this assignment interest you?
Minister, I'm interested in anything that can be of service to you...
...and Captain Potzdorf.
You will not know a word of English.
If the Chevalier remarks on your accent, say you are Hungarian.
You served in the war.
You left the Army for medical reasons...
...then served Monsieur de Quellenberg for two years.
He's now with the Army in Silesia, but you'll have a certificate from him.
Good morning, Your Honour.
So you are the young man
recommended by Seebach.
Yes, Your Honour,
here are my credentials.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagy?
Yes, Your Honour.
Monsieur de Quellenberg
recommends you highly.
Monsieur is a very good man.
It was imprudent of him...
... but when Barry saw
the Chevalier's splendour...
... and noble manner...
... he felt unable to keep disguise
with him.
Those who have never been exiled...
... know not what it is to hear
a friendly voice in captivity...
... and would not understand the cause...
... of the burst of feeling
now about to take place.
You seem the right one to me.
Thank you, Your Honour.
Are you ill?
Sir...
...I have a confession to make to you.
I'm an Irishman.
My name is Redmond Barry.
I was abducted into the Prussian Army.
Now I've been put into your service...
...by my Captain Potzdorf and his uncle, the Minister of Police...
...to serve as a watch upon your... actions...
...and to give information to them.
The Chevalier was much affected
at thus finding one of his countrymen.
For he too was an exile.
And a friendly voice, a look...
... brought the old country
back to his memory.
He is very religious and attends church regularly.
After Mass he comes home for breakfast.
He then takes an airing in his carriage.
Barry presented his reports
regularly to the Minister.
The details were arranged
beforehand with the Chevalier.
He was instructed to tell the truth...
... as much as his story
would possibly bear.
The information he gave
was very minute and accurate...
... though not very important.
Wine or punch, Your Honour?
Wine.
It was agreed that Barry should keep
his character of valet.
That, before strangers,
he should not know a word of English.
And that he should keep a lookout
on the trumps when serving the wine.
Having excellent eyesight...
... and a natural aptitude...
... he was able to give his dear patron
much assistance...
... against his opponents
at the green table.
Lf, for instance, he wiped
the table with a napkin...
... the enemy was strong in Diamonds.
If he adjusted a chair it meant Ace King.
If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?"...
... Hearts were meant, and so forth.
The Prince of Tübingen...
... who had intimate connections
with the Great Frederick...
... was passionately fond of play
as were the gentlemen...
... of almost all the Courts of Europe.
You owe 15,500 frederick d'or.
Chevalier...
...though I cannot say how...
...I believe you have cheated me.
I deny Your Grace's accusation...
...and beg you to say how you have been cheated.
I don't know.
But I believe I have been.
Your Grace owes me
15,500 frederick d'or...
...which I have honourably won.
Chevalier...
...if you will have your money now you must fight for it.
If you will be patient...
...maybe I will pay you something another time.
Your Grace, if I am to be so tame as to take this...
...then I must give up an honourable and lucrative occupation.
I have said all there is to be said.
I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.
Good night.
Was the Prince cheated?
In as far as I am able to tell,
Herr Minister, no.
I believe he won the money fairly.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
I'm not sure.
The Prince told him that if he wanted his money he'd have to fight for it.
A meeting with the Prince is impossible.
The Prince has left him no other choice.
Will you be able to return here tomorrow without arousing suspicion?
I know they won't allow a meeting with the Prince.
But if I say that, do you know any reason why he'll pay me what he owes?
You must tell them I intend to demand satisfaction.
Don't look so downcast, my boy.
They cannot harm me, the Austrian Embassy will see to that.
The worst they can do is send me out of this dreary country of theirs.
If they should, don't worry...
...you shall not be left behind.
Have no fear of that.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
Has he already demanded satisfaction?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to...
...possibly today.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
All the arrangements are made.
You said he takes a drive after breakfast every day.
Yes, sir.
Is there any reason he should do any different tomorrow?
No, sir.
Good.
When the Chevalier comes out to his carriage in the morning...
...two Officers will meet him and escort him to the frontier.
His baggage will be sent after him.
Excellent.
At ten o'clock the next morning...
... the Chevalier de Balibari...
... went out for his regular morning drive.
Where's my servant, Lazlo?
I will let down the steps, Your Honour.
What is this about?
Please get inside.
Am I under arrest?
We're driving to the frontier.
Frontier? But I'm on my way to the Austrian Ambassador's house.
My orders are to escort you to the frontier...
...and see you safely across the border.
But, I'm not going to the frontier.
I have very important business at the Austrian Ambassador's house.
My orders are to take Your Honour to the frontier by any means necessary.
If you come willingly...
...I'm to give you this purse on behalf of the Prince of Tübingen...
...containing 2,000 frederick d'or.
All Europe shall hear of this.
And so, without papers or passport...
... and under the eyes
of two Prussian Officers...
... Barry was escorted across the frontier
into Saxony and freedom.
The Chevalier himself had uneventfully
crossed the frontier the night before.
By these wonderful circumstances,
Barry was once more free...
... and began his professional work
as a gamester...
... resolving, thenceforward and forever,
to live the life of a gentleman.
The four wins.
Soon he and the Chevalier were received
in all the Courts of Europe...
... and were speedily...
... in the very best society
where play was patronized...
... and professors of that science
always welcome.
The seven.
Why not the seven?
All... all, yes.
No more bets.
Number seven...
... loses.
Place your bets.
Chevalier, will you give me credit for 5,000 louis d'or, please?
Of course, Lord Ludd.
Five thousand.
Now, everything on the four.
Yes, I know, everything on the four.
No more bets.
The four loses.
It is not important.
Now, I'm weary.
I would like dinner. Shall we?
Excuse me, Lord Ludd.
If you don't mind.
Not at all.
They always played on credit with
any person of honour or noble lineage.
They never pressed for their winnings...
... or declined to receive
promissory notes.
But woe to the man who did not pay
when the note became due.
Barry was sure to wait upon him
with his bill.
There were few bad debts.
Saluez.
It was Barry's skill with the sword,
and readiness to use it...
... that maintained the reputation
of the firm, so to speak.
On guard!
I will pay you today, sir.
Thus, it will be seen, their life...
... for all its splendour,
was not without danger and difficulty...
... requiring talent and determination
for success.
And required them to live
a wandering and disconnected life.
And, though they were swimming
upon the high tide of fortune...
... and prospering with the cards,
they had little to show for their labour...
... but some fine clothes
and a few trinkets.
Five years in the Army,
and considerable experience of the world...
... had dispelled any romantic notions
regarding love...
... with which Barry commenced life.
And he had it in mind,
as many gentlemen had done before him...
... to marry a woman
of fortune and condition.
And, as such things so often happen...
... these thoughts coincided
with his setting sight upon a lady...
... who will play a considerable part
in the drama of his life.
The Countess of Lyndon...
... Viscountess Bullingdon of England...
... Baroness Castle Lyndon of Ireland.
A woman of vast wealth and great beauty.
She was the wife of Sir Charles Lyndon...
... Knight of the Bath...
... Minister to George III
at several of the Courts of Europe.
A cripple, wheeled about in a chair...
... worn out by gout
and a myriad of diseases.
Her Ladyship's Chaplain, Mr. Runt...
... acted as tutor to her son,
the little Viscount Bullingdon...
... a melancholy little boy,
much attached to his mother.
I'm going outside for a breath of air.
Yes, My Lady.
To make a long story short...
... six hours after they met...
Her Ladyship was in love.
And once Barry got into her company...
... he found innumerable occasions
to improve his intimacy...
... and was scarcely out
of Her Ladyship's sight.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Sir Charles.
Good evening, Mr. Barry.
Have you done with my Lady?
Pardon?
Come, sir. I'm a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
I think, Sir Charles, that you've had too much to drink.
What?
As it happens, your Chaplain, Mr. Runt, introduced me to your Lady...
...to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is an expert.
He wants... to step into my shoes.
He wants to step into my shoes.
Is it not a pleasure for me, as I am drawing near the goal...
...to find my home such a happy one...
...my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?
Isn't it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife...
...getting everything ready for my departure?
I hope you're not thinking of leaving us,
Sir Charles?
Not so soon as you may fancy, perhaps.
I've been given over many times these four years.
And there was always a candidate or two...
...waiting to apply for the situation.
I'm sorry for you, Mr. Barry.
It grieves me to keep you or any gentleman waiting.
Had you not better arrange with my doctor...
...or have the cook flavour my omelette with arsenic, eh?
What are the odds, gentlemen, that I live to see Mr. Barry hang yet?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Gentlemen.
I'll get a surgeon.
Have some brandy, Sir Charles.
From a report in
The Saint James' Chronicle:
"Died at Spa in Belgium...
"...Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon...
"...Knight of the Bath,
Member of Parliament...
"...and for many years...
"...His Majesty's Representative
at various European Courts.
"He has left behind him a name
which is endeared to all his friends. "
''Dearly beloved...
''... we are gathered together here in the sight of God...
''... and in the face of this congregation...
''... to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.''
A year later,
on the fifteenth of June...
... in the year 1773...
... Redmond Barry had the honour to lead
to the altar the Countess of Lyndon.
The ceremony was performed by the
Reverend Runt, Her Ladyship's Chaplain.
''And therefore is not in any way to be enterprised...
''... nor taken in hand unadvisedly...
''... lightly or wantonly...
''... to satisfy men's carnal lusts and appetites...
''... like brute beasts that have no understanding.
''But reverently...
''... discreetly...
''... advisedly...
''... soberly...
''... and in the fear of God.
''Duly considering the causes for which matrimony was ordained.
''First...
''... it was ordained for the procreation of children to be brought up...
''... in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and to the praise of His holy name.
''Secondly...
''... it was ordained for a remedy against sin, and to avoid fornication.''
Barry had now arrived
at the pitch of prosperity...
... and by his own energy had raised
himself to a higher sphere of society...
... having procured His Majesty's
gracious permission to add the name...
... of his lovely Lady to his own.
Thenceforth, Redmond Barry
assumed the style...
... and title of Barry Lyndon.
Redmond, would you mind not smoking for a while?
Lady Lyndon was soon destined
to occupy a place in Barry's life...
... not very much more important
than the elegant carpets and pictures...
... which would form
the pleasant background of his existence.
My Lord Bullingdon, you seem particularly glum today?
You should be happy that your mother has remarried.
Not in this way.
And not in such haste.
And certainly not to this man.
I think you judge your mother too harshly.
Do you not like your new father?
Not very much.
He seems to me little more than a common opportunist.
I don't think he loves my mother at all.
And it hurts me to see her make such a fool of herself.
At the end of a year Her Ladyship
presented Barry with a son.
Bryan Patrick Lyndon, they called him.
Her Ladyship and Barry lived,
after a while, pretty separate.
She preferred quiet, or to say the truth,
he preferred it for her...
... being a great friend to a modest
and tranquil behaviour in woman.
Besides, she was a mother,
and would have great comfort...
... in the dressing, educating
and dandling of their little Bryan.
For whose sake it was fit,
Barry believed...
... that she should give up the pleasures
and frivolities of the world...
... leaving that part of the duty
of every family of distinction...
... to be performed by him.
Lady Lyndon tended to a melancholy
and maudlin temper...
... and, left alone by her husband,
was rarely happy or in good humour.
Now she must add jealousy
to her other complaints...
... and find rivals even among her maids.
Samuel, what would the time be?
Twenty-five minutes past eleven,
My Lady.
Shall we make this the last game, ladies?
Good morning, ladies.
Would you mind excusing us?
I'd like a word alone with Lady Lyndon.
I'm sorry.
This coat is made of the finest velvet...
...all cunningly worked with silver thread.
No finer velvet has ever been woven, and you will see none better anywhere.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Good morning, dearest.
We're taking the children for a ride to the village. We'll be back for tea.
Have a nice time. I'll see you then.
Goodbye, little Bryan.
Lord Bullingdon.
Take good care of your mother.
Come now, give your father a proper kiss.
Lord Bullingdon...
...is that the way to behave to your father?
Lord Bullingdon, have you lost your tongue?
My father was Sir Charles Lyndon.
I have not forgotten him, if others have.
Lord Bullingdon, you have insulted your father!
Madam, you have insulted my father.
Dearest, would you excuse us?
We have something to discuss in private.
Gentlemen.
One.
Two.
Six.
Lord Bullingdon...
...I have always been willing to live with you on friendly terms.
But be clear about one thing:
As men serve me, I serve them.
I never laid a cane on the back of a Lord before...
...but, if you force me to, I shall speedily become used to the practice.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?
No.
You may go.
Barry believed, and not without
some reason, that it had been...
... a declaration of war against him
by Bullingdon from the start...
... and that the evil consequences
that ensued...
... were entirely of Bullingdon's creating.
I shall make you into a real magician now, Bryan.
I shall show you the knot that never was.
As Bullingdon grew up to be a man...
... his hatred for Barry
assumed an intensity...
... equalled only by his
increased devotion to his mother.
Very good, Bryan. A little bow.
Put it on the table for me.
Thank you.
For Bryan's eighth birthday the local
nobility, gentry and their children...
... came to pay their respects.
The inside and outside are quite empty.
Wave your hand over the top.
Is there anything there?
Wonderful! Wonderful, colourful silk handkerchiefs!
Take a bow, Bryan, you did that beautifully.
Very good.
Let's see if you have something behind your ear.
Yes, you have.
A little ball. Let's make it vanish.
It's gone.
Here it is, behind my elbow.
Wave your hand over my green silk handkerchief...
...and see if we can produce a magic flower. I wonder if we can?
Here it comes.
The colours of the rainbow.
You know all the colours of the rainbow produce but one colour, Bryan.
Nothing in my magic cabinet.
They produce the colour... white.
And there is my own...
...beautiful white rabbit.
Bryan, you have done very well.
A little bow.
We crept up on their fort, and I jumped over the wall first.
My fellows jumped after me.
You should have seen the Frenchmen's faces when 23 rampaging he-devils...
...sword and pistol, cut and thrust, came tumbling into their fort.
In three minutes we left as many Artillery men's heads...
...as there were cannon balls.
Later we were visited by our noble Prince Henry.
''Who is the man who has done this? ''
I stepped forward.
''How many heads was it that you cut off? '' He says.
''Nineteen,'' says I,
''besides wounding several.''
Well, I'll be blessed, if he didn't burst into tears.
''Noble, noble fellow,'' he said.
''Here is nineteen golden guineas, one for each head that you cut off.''
What do you think of that?
Were you allowed to keep the heads?
No, they always become the property of the King.
Will you tell me another story?
I'll tell you one tomorrow.
Will you play cards with me tomorrow?
Of course I will. Now go to sleep.
Will you keep the candles lit?
Bryan, big boys don't sleep with the candles lit.
I'm afraid of the dark.
My darling, there's nothing to be afraid of.
But, I like it with the candles lit.
All right, you can sleep with the candles lit.
Thank you, Papa.
Good night.
Ah, Redmond!
It's a blessing to see my darling boy has attained a position I knew was his due.
And for which I pinched myself to educate him.
Little Bryan is a darling boy...
...and you live in great splendour.
Your lady wife knows she has a treasure...
...she couldn't have had, had she married a Duke.
But, if she should tire of my wild Redmond...
...and his old-fashioned Irish ways...
...or if she should die...
...what future would there be for my son, and my grandson?
You have not a penny of your own...
...and cannot transact any business without her signature.
Upon her death the entire estate would go to young Bullingdon...
...who bears you little affection.
You could be penniless tomorrow...
...and darling Bryan at the mercy of his stepbrother.
Shall I tell you something?
There is only one way for you and your son to have real security.
You must obtain a title.
I shall not rest until I see you Lord Lyndon.
You have important friends.
They can tell you how these things are done.
For money, well-timed and properly applied...
...can accomplish anything.
And Barry was acquainted with someone
who knew how these things were done.
This was the distinguished Barrister
and former Government Minister...
... Lord Hallam...
... whose acquaintance he had made,
like so many others, at the gaming table.
Do you happen to know the Thirteenth Earl of Wendover?
I don't believe I do.
Well, this nobleman is one of the Gentlemen of His Majesty's Closet...
...with whom our revered Monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.
In my opinion, you would be wise to fix upon him...
...your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the peerage.
When I take up a person, Mr. Lyndon, he, or she, is safe.
There is no question about them anymore.
My friends are the best people.
I don't mean they're the most virtuous...
...or, indeed, the least virtuous, or the cleverest...
...or the stupidest, richest or best born.
But, the best.
In a word, people about whom there is no question.
I cannot promise how long it will take.
You can appreciate it is not an easy matter.
But, any gentleman with an estate, and 30,000 a year...
...should have a peerage.
And there standing behind me was a total stranger.
I looked at him, and he said to me:
''Excuse me, sir, could you tell me, is Lord Wendover alive or dead? ''
I was so astonished,
I couldn't think of what to say.
Then I became angry, and said to him, ''He's dead.''
The striving after this peerage was
one of Barry's most unlucky dealings.
He made great sacrifices
to bring it about.
He lavished money here,
and diamonds there.
He bought lands
at ten times their value...
... purchased pictures and articles
of virtue at ruinous prices.
He gave entertainments
to those friends to his claim...
... all, being about the Royal person,
were likely to advance it.
And, I can tell you, bribes were
administered. And in high places, too.
So near the person of His Majesty
that you would be astonished to know...
... what great noblemen condescended
to receive his loans.
This is by Ludovico Cordi...
...a disciple of Alessandro Allori.
It's dated 1605...
...and shows,
''The Adoration of The Magi.''
It's beautiful.
Yes.
I love the use of the colour blue by the artist.
Yes, that is very beautiful.
What is the price of this one?
Well, this is one of my best pictures.
But, if you really like it, I'm sure we can come to some arrangement.
Lord Wendover, Your Majesty.
I'm glad to see you here today,
Lord Wendover.
What news of Lady Wendover?
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Lady Wendover is much better.
Good! Present my compliments to her.
Say we miss her company here.
And what of those excellent boys of yours?
They're well. Charles has gone to sea under Captain Geary on the Ramillies.
John has gone to Oxford to learn how to preach and pray.
Good, good!
Your Majesty, may I present
Mr. Barry Lyndon.
Mr. Lyndon. We were very fond of Sir Charles Lyndon.
And how is Lady Lyndon?
She's very well, Your Majesty.
Mr. Lyndon raised a company of troops to fight in America against the rebels.
Good, Mr. Lyndon. Raise another company and go with them, too.
Barry was born clever enough
at gaining a fortune...
... but incapable of keeping one.
For the qualities and energies
which lead a man to achieve the first...
... are often the very cause of his ruin
in the latter case.
Now he was burdened with
the harassing cares and responsibilities...
... which are the dismal adjuncts
of great rank and property.
And his life now...
... seemed to consist mostly of drafts
of letters to lawyers and money-brokers...
... and endless correspondence...
... with decorators and cooks.
Gentlemen, I'm going to leave you for a few minutes. Carry on with your work.
Yes, sir.
Bully.
What does...
...''strenuous'' mean?
Bryan, I'm trying to work.
But what does it mean?
It means ''an effort requiring strength.''
What does ''quadrangle'' mean?
A quadrangle is a four-sided figure like a square or a rectangle.
Now, please be quiet, and let me get on with my work.
Bryan, please be quiet!
Have you seen my pencil?
No, I haven't.
Bryan, please stop making so much noise.
That's my pencil.
No, it isn't.
It is. It's my pencil!
I've had this all morning.
It's my pencil!
Listen, will you be quiet!
It's my pencil!
I'll teach you a lesson.
What the devil's going on in here?
I told you never to lay a hand on this child.
One.
Two.
Six.
Will that be all, Mr. Redmond Barry?
Yes, that will be all.
Well then, look you now.
From this moment, I will submit to no further chastisement from you.
I will kill you, if you lay hands on me ever again.
Is that clear to you, sir?
Get out of here!
Don't you think he fits my shoes very well, Your Ladyship?
Dear child...
...what a pity it is I'm not dead, for your sake.
The Lyndons would then have a worthy representative...
...and enjoy all the benefits...
...of the illustrious blood of the Barrys of Barryville.
Would they not...
...Mr. Redmond Barry?
From the way I love this child...
...you ought to know how
I would've loved his elder brother...
...had he proved worthy of any mother's affection.
Madam!
I have borne as long as mortal could endure...
...the ill-treatment of the insolent Irish upstart whom you've taken to your bed.
It is not only his lowly birth and the brutality of his manners which disgust me.
But the shameful nature of his conduct toward Your Ladyship...
...his brutal and ungentlemanlike behaviour...
...his open infidelity...
...his shameless robberies and swindling of my property, and yours.
And as I cannot personally chastise this low-bred ruffian, and cannot bear...
...to witness his treatment of you...
...and loathe his company as if it were the plague...
...I have decided to leave my home and never return.
At least, during his detested life...
...or during my own.
Will anyone be joining
Your Lordship?
No, I shall be alone.
The roast beef's very good, My Lord.
Hello, Neville. How are you?
Ah, Barry. Hello.
I see you're alone.
Why don't you join me?
Oh, thank you, Barry, you're very kind, but...
...I'm expecting someone to join me.
What a shame! Lady Lyndon and I have missed your company lately.
Please give my respects to Lady Lyndon...
...and say I've been very busy of late and not been able to go about much.
I shall.
The eighth of next month we're having some guests over for cards...
...we'd love to have you and Lady Wendover join us.
I'll check my diary, but I think
I'm engaged on that evening.
I hope you're not engaged.
We'd love to see you again.
I'll write and say if I'm free or not.
I look forward to hearing from you.
It's nice to see you again.
If he had murdered Lord Bullingdon...
... Barry could scarcely have been received
with more coldness and resentment...
... that now followed him
in town and country.
His friends fell away from him.
A legend arose of his cruelty
to his stepson.
Now all the bills came down
on him together.
All the bills he had been contracting
for the years of his marriage...
... and which the creditors sent in
with a hasty unanimity.
Their amount was frightful.
Barry was now bound up in an
inextricable toil of bills and debts...
... of mortgages and insurances,
and all the evils attendant upon them.
Lady Lyndon's income was hampered
almost irretrievably...
... to satisfy these claims.
Do you think that's good?
Excellent.
Who's this?
It's a peacock on the wall.
What's it say?
I saw this bird yesterday.
Who's that?
Mama in her coach.
Is she going to London?
I don't know.
Barry had his faults...
... but no man could say of him
that he was not a good and tender father.
He loved his son with a blind partiality.
He denied him nothing.
It is impossible to convey
what high hopes he had for the boy...
... and how he indulged
in a thousand fond anticipations...
... as to his future success
and figure in the world.
But fate had determined that he should
leave none of his race behind him...
... that he should finish his life...
... poor, lonely...
... and childless.
Papa.
Yes, Bryan?
Will you buy me a horse?
Buy you a horse?
Yes, Papa.
But you already have little Julia.
She's only a pony, I want a real horse.
Then I can ride with you on the hunt.
You think you're big enough for the hunt?
Oh, yes!
Jonathan Plunkett is only a year older than I am and he rides with his papa.
I'll have to think about it.
Please, say yes. There's nothing I want in the whole world more than a horse.
I'll think about it.
Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you!
How much are you asking for him?
One hundred guineas.
He's a nice little horse, but I don't think he's worth that.
Seventy-five seems more like the right price.
I'll accept eighty guineas, and not a shilling less.
Five guineas should never keep two gentlemen from their drink. Eighty then.
Done, sir.
Take the horse to Doolan's farm.
Tell him he needs a bit of breaking in.
Say it's for Master Bryan's birthday, and I want it to be a surprise.
And remember that yourself.
Papa.
What is it, lad?
Did you buy that horse?
What horse is that?
The horse you were going to buy me for my birthday.
I know nothing about any horse.
But one of the stable boys told Nelly you'd already bought it...
...and it was at Doolan's farm where Mick the groom was breaking it in.
Is that true?
When is your birthday?
Next Tuesday.
Well, you'll have to wait till then to find out.
Then, it's true! Oh, thank you, Papa.
Yes, Mama?
Promise me you won't ride that horse except with your father.
Yes, Mama, I promise.
And I promise you a good flogging...
...if you even go to Doolan's farm to see him before your birthday.
Yes, Papa.
You understand?
Yes, Papa.
You promise me?
Yes, Papa, I promise.
All right, eat your food.
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Lyndon...
...but I believe Master Bryan has disobeyed you...
...and stolen away to Doolan's farm.
On going to his room this morning,
I found his bed empty.
One of the cooks saw him cross the yard at daybreak.
Didn't you see him go?
He must have passed through my room while I was asleep.
Oh, my God! What has happened here?
I noticed the lad riding across the field, sir...
... and having trouble with the horse,
which was playing up.
Suddenly the animal plunged and reared,
and the poor lad was thrown.
Oh, Bryan, why did you disobey me?
I'm sorry, Papa.
You won't whip me, will you?
No, my darling.
I won't whip you.
Take my horse and ride like the Devil for Doctor Broughton.
Tell him whatever he's doing he must come at once. Understand?
The doctors were called.
But what does a doctor avail in a contest
with the grim, invincible enemy?
Such as came could only confirm
the hopelessness of the poor child's case.
He remained with his parents
for two days.
And a sad comfort it was to know
that he was in no pain.
Papa.
Am I going to die?
No, my darling, you're not going to die.
You're going to get better.
But I can't feel anything, except in my hands.
Does that mean I'm already dead in part of my body?
No, my darling, that's where you were hurt by the horse.
But you're going to be all right.
Papa, if I die, will I go to heaven?
Of course you will, my darling...
...but you're not going to die.
Mama, give me your hand.
Papa, give me your hand.
Will you both promise me something?
Yes.
Promise me never to quarrel so.
But to love each other.
So that we may meet again, in heaven...
...where Bullingdon said quarrelsome people will never go.
We promise.
Will you tell me the story about the fort?
Of course.
We crept up on the fort.
I jumped over the wall first, and my fellows jumped after me.
And you should have seen the look...
...on the Frenchmen's faces when
23 he-devils, sword and pistol...
...cut and thrust, came tumbling into the fort.
In three minutes...
...we left...
'''I am the resurrection and the life,' saith the Lord.
'''He that believeth in me, though he were dead...
'''... yet shall he live.
'''And whosoever liveth and believeth in me...
'''... shall never die.'
''I know that my Redeemer liveth...
''... and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.
''And though after my skin worms destroy this body...
''... yet in my flesh shall I see God.
''Whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold...
''... and not another.
''We brought nothing into this world...
''... and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
''The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
''Blessed is the name of the Lord.''
Barry's grief was inconsolable.
Such solace as he could find,
came only from drink.
His mother was the only person who would
remain faithful to him in his misfortune.
And many a night, when he was
unconscious of her attention...
... saw him carried off to bed.
''O blessed Lord...
''... the Father of mercies and God of all comforts.
''We beseech Thee, look down in pity and compassion upon this...
''... Thy afflicted servant.
''Thou writest bitter things against her...
''... and makest her to possess her former iniquities.''
Her Ladyship,
always vapourish and nervous...
... plunged into devotion...
... with so much fervour, that you would
have imagined her distracted at times.
In the doleful conditions
which now prevailed at Castle Hackton...
... management of the household,
and of the Lyndon estate...
... fell to Mrs. Barry,
whose spirit of order...
... attended to all the details
of a great establishment.
You wish to see me, madam?
Yes, Reverend. Please sit down.
I have some matters I would like to discuss later, Graham...
...but just now would you go to Her Ladyship...
...and have her sign these papers.
Yes, madam.
Reverend Runt...
...I need not tell you that the recent tragedy to this family...
...has made the services of a tutor no longer required here.
And as we are in considerable difficulty about money...
...I'm afraid I must ask you, with the greatest reluctance...
...to resign your post.
Madam, I'm sensible to your predicament...
...and you need have no concern about my wages, I can willingly forego them...
...but it is out of the question for me to leave Her Ladyship in her present state.
I'm sorry to say this to you...
...but I believe you are largely responsible for her present state of mind.
The sooner you leave, the better she will be.
Madam, with the greatest respect...
...I take my instructions only from Her Ladyship.
Reverend Runt...
...Her Ladyship is in no fit mind to give instructions to anyone.
My son has charged me with managing the affairs at Castle Hackton...
...until he recovers from his grief and resumes his interest in worldly matters.
While I'm in charge...
...you'll take your instructions from me.
My only concern is for Lady Lyndon.
Madam...
...your only concern is for Her Ladyship's signature.
You and your son have almost succeeded in destroying a fine family fortune.
And what little remains for you...
...depends on keeping Her Ladyship prisoner in her own home.
Reverend Runt...
...this matter bears no further discussion.
You will pack your bags and leave by tomorrow.
God, help. Help!
In the midst of these great perplexities...
... Her Ladyship made an attempt
to kill herself by taking poison.
Though she only made herself
dangerously ill...
... due to the very small amount
which she swallowed...
... this, nevertheless, caused
an intervention from a certain quarter...
... which was long overdue.
Oh, my God!
If my mother had died...
...it would've been as much my responsibility...
...as if I had poured the strychnine for her myself.
For to the everlasting disgrace of my family name...
...I have, by my cowardice, and by my weakness...
...allowed the Barrys to establish a brutal...
...and ignorant tyranny over our lives...
...which has left my mother a broken woman...
...and to squander and ruin a fine family fortune.
My friends profess sympathy, but behind my back...
...I know I am despised.
And quite justifiably so.
However...
...I know now what I must do.
And what I shall do.
Whatever be the cost.
Good morning, My Lord.
Good morning.
Is Mr. Barry Lyndon here?
Yes, My Lord, he's inside.
Mr. Redmond Barry.
The last occasion on which we met...
...you wantonly caused me injury and dishonour.
In such a manner, and to such an extent no gentleman can willingly suffer...
...without demanding satisfaction...
...however much time intervenes.
I have now come to claim that satisfaction.
Mr. Lyndon...
...these are a matched pair of pistols, and as you have seen...
...your second has loaded one, and I have loaded the other.
As they belong to Lord Bullingdon, you may have whichever one you wish.
Lord Bullingdon.
Now, gentlemen, to determine who will have first fire...
...I will toss a coin in the air.
As the offended party, it is
Lord Bullingdon's choice to call the toss.
Is that agreeable to both of you?
Yes.
If Lord Bullingdon calls correctly he will have the first fire.
If incorrectly, Mr. Lyndon will have the first fire.
Is that clearly understood?
What is your call, Lord Bullingdon?
Heads.
It is heads.
Lord Bullingdon will have the first fire.
Lord Bullingdon...
...will you take your ground?
One... two... three...
...four... five... six...
...seven... eight... nine... ten.
Mr. Lyndon, will you take your ground?
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready to receive
Lord Bullingdon's fire?
Yes.
Lord Bullingdon...
...cock your pistol...
...and prepare to fire.
Sir Richard, this pistol must be faulty.
I must have another one.
I'm sorry, Lord Bullingdon, but you must first stand your ground...
...and allow Mr. Lyndon his turn to fire.
That is correct, Lord Bullingdon.
Your pistol has fired, and that counts as your shot.
Mr. Lyndon, are the rules of firing clear to you?
Yes.
Lord Bullingdon...
...are you ready to receive
Mr. Lyndon's fire?
Yes.
Very well, then.
Mr. Lyndon...
...cock your pistol...
...and prepare to fire.
Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?
Is your pistol cocked, Mr. Lyndon?
Yes.
Then prepare to fire.
One...
...two...
Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr. Lyndon having fired into the ground...
...do you now consider that you have received satisfaction?
I have not received satisfaction.
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready?
Yes.
Lord Bullingdon...
...cock your pistol and get ready to fire.
One...
...two...
Barry was carried to an inn nearby
and a surgeon was called.
I'm nearly finished.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Mr. Lyndon.
I'm afraid you'll have to lose the leg...
...most likely below the knee.
Lose the leg?
What for?
The simple answer is to save your life.
The ball has shattered the bone below the knee and severed the artery.
Unless I amputate, there's no way that I can repair the artery...
...and stop the hemorrhage.
Graham.
Yes, My Lord?
When we arrive at Castle Hackton, inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.
Don't go into any unnecessary detail.
Just tell her where he is and that he has been wounded in the leg.
She will want to go to him.
See that she is out of the house and on her way to London as soon as possible.
And in no event...
...is she to be allowed to see my mother...
...or create any disturbance at the house before she leaves.
Yes, My Lord.
Mrs. Barry, how do you do?
How nice to see you, Graham.
Come in.
Thank you.
You... received my note?
Yes, we were expecting you.
Oh, good, I didn't want to call unannounced.
Mr. Lyndon, how are you feeling?
I'm feeling much better, thank you, Graham.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you, Mrs. Barry.
Would you like some tea?
Oh, no! No, thank you, Mrs. Barry.
Not just now.
How's the world treating you, Graham?
Oh, not too bad.
Are you comfortable here?
Most comfortable.
Good, good!
Shall we get down to the matter at hand?
By all means.
Mr. Lyndon...
...Lord Bullingdon has instructed me...
...to offer you an annuity...
...of 500 guineas a year for life.
Specifically on the condition of your...
...leaving England...
...and to be stopped...
...the instant of your return.
Lord Bullingdon has also asked me to point out to you...
...that should you decide to remain here...
...your stay would infallibly plunge you...
...into jail.
As in view of the present circumstances there will soon be...
...innumerable writs taken out against you for...
...debts long-outstanding...
...and your credit is so blown that...
...you could not hope...
...to raise a shilling.
Utterly baffled and beaten...
... what was the lonely
and broken-hearted man to do?
He took the annuity and returned
to Ireland with his mother...
... to complete his recovery.
Sometime later he travelled abroad.
His life there, we have not the means
of following accurately.
He appears to have resumed
his former profession of a gambler...
... without his former success.
He never saw Lady Lyndon again.

After marvelous adventures in which Lancelot of the Lake played a heroic part, the Knights of the Round Table set off in search of the Grail.
The Grail was a vessel in which Joseph of Arimathea had gathered the blood of Christ.
It was to bestow supernatural power.
It was believed hidden in Brittany.
Merlin, before his death, pledged the knights to the quest.
Merlin had indicated that the quest should be led by Perceval (Parsifal), not by Lancelot.
After leaving the castle, the knights were dispersed.
Perceval was not seen again.
Two years have passed.
Decimated, the knights return to King Arthur and Queen Guinevere.
They have not found the Grail.
He whose footfalls precede him will die within a year.
- Even if they're his horse's steps?
- Even then.
You said that of those who passed yesterday.
It is the same omen for them all.
I've lost my way.
This is Escalot.
I'll show you the way.
Is it you, Lancelot?
Gawain?
The first is last.
I was lost near Escalot.
Greetings, Lionel,
Lambegus, Bohort.
Uncle, Lancelot is here.
Sire, I do not bring you the Grail.
The Grail eludes us.
So much blood, so many dead.
At least you were spared.
The queen must be told that her knight has returned.
Mass already?
Not yet.
You are alive, and you are here.
Nothing shall take you from me again.
All is lost for us in Brittany.
I can wait no longer. Say it.
I love you.
Say it once more.
I love you. You must believe me.
I believe you.
What is the matter?
Give me your hand.
The one you are hiding.
Your finger is bare.
You have taken off my ring.
Speak; end my fears.
I saw the Grail.
One night, I sought refuge in a ruined chapel; a voice challenged me.
I can still hear that voice accusing me of deceit and treachery.
You dreamed it.
I shall be your lover no longer, Guinevere.
I vowed it to God.
You did that?
I did.
You must be freed from another vow before God can hear you.
I ask you to free me from that vow,
Guinevere.
I gave myself wholly to you, and you took me.
I'll close this room.
Why, uncle?
Shall we never assemble again?
Who?
Here sat Ydier, Clamadeu, Urien, here Galeschin and all the others we shall see no more.
Here Perceval.
There Claudas, and there, there.
No, too many dead and too many memories.
Enter, Mordred.
I wish to ask you too.
What shall we do now?
I warned against such a foolish venture.
You stayed behind in safety, Mordred.
Therefore, I won't comment on the disaster.
That's not what you were asked.
I'd rather keep silent.
In that case, you may withdraw.
I am troubled.
Have we provoked God?
Are the deaths a punishment, a decree of His justice?
Is this silent, empty castle a sign He has forsaken us?
- Let us re-form our ranks.
- Not yet.
I lack the heart, when we have lost so many noble companions, to replace them so quickly; we must wait.
With arms folded? Wait for what?
We have received a terrible blow.
May God guide us.
What if He does not?
Remain at arms.
Practice. Perfect yourselves.
Remain united; forget your quarrels; cultivate friendship.
What says Arthur?
That we breathe poisoned air but that you will change poison into balm.
Why me?
He always calls on you for help, for a miracle.
His words have stayed with me all day.
Which words?
All. "Perfect yourselves."
You have devoted your life to that, hence your mastery in combat.
I must perfect myself otherwise, but as for Mordred, he won't come to us, so we must go to him.
He is everything that you and I despise.
When he splashed you fording a river, you said he offended your horse.
How he cringed before you.
I dislike weaklings.
They should be hanged.
The queen's room is lit.
What of it?
I wonder how many eyes watch that window while they feign sleep.
Idle talk.
I've surprised Agravain, Guivret, Lucan.
Even Mordred dares.
Pay no heed. Go to bed.
His name will be in the calendar;
Lancelot has become a saint.
We'll have to wait a long time for you to become a saint, Gawain.
I attend services. God asks no more of me.
He willed me this way.
He wants you to love the life
He gave you.
I'd love it more with fewer baleful faces about me.
We must do something.
Give us a purpose.
I gave you a purpose. Pray, Gawain.
Pray.
Consent.
Free me from my vow.
You have changed, but I am the same.
Consent. I beg you, for the salvation of us all.
No; I'll save no one at that price.
God does not ask us to forswear love.
That which was must be no more.
Can we make it be no more?
We can forestall fate, deflect the menace.
There is no menace.
You all imagine it.
Yield, Guinevere.
I yield; I humble myself.
To think yourself responsible for everything is not humility.
Are you, then, the enemy?
I am the one created to help you who will go with you through the void, the darkness.
I am your strength.
You said, "Without Guinevere, there would be no Lancelot."
I wish to be alone.
You are alone in your pride.
Pride in what is not yours is a falsehood.
I was to bring back the Grail.
It was not the Grail.
It was God you all wanted.
God is no trophy to bear home.
You were all implacable.
You killed, pillaged, burned.
Then you turned blindly on each other like maniacs.
Now you blame our love for this disaster.
And I am to destroy this love which cost us so much to preserve?
I will not.
It is not what you want that matters.
I cannot.
Neither is it this happiness you seek that matters.
Is it happiness that devours my soul?
Who am I not to throw myself at your feet?
I do not ask to love you.
Is it my fault I cannot live without you?
That I need you?
I do not live for Arthur.
Just say,
"For you, I prefer death to life."
Then I shall consent; all becomes easy.
That is impossible.
Happy is he who knows why he sacrifices himself.
But you know.
God cannot separate us.
If I surrender, it is to you alone.
You do not want that?
What must I say?
The "yes" that I see on your lips.
If you see it, it is there.
You can do with me as you wish.
- What are you looking at?
- The moon.
Carmaduc says the little cloud drowns the moon.
I say it strangles it.
Meaning?
We'll stifle here if we do not strike free.
The cloud is retreating.
Is it your watch?
Let me go the rounds with you.
I prefer to go alone.
Mordred, let's make peace.
Arthur sent you?
I came of my own accord.
You honor me.
I think things are best left as they are.
What do you want?
Your friendship in exchange for mine.
We both serve the same king.
He takes your advice, not mine.
We are equal. Our table is round, so there is no precedence.
A woman's scarf?
You recognize it?
Not if you conceal it from me.
Mordred, if I give you my right hand, will you refuse it?
What insolence! He dared!
For much lesser affronts, you've drawn your sword and struck at the heart.
So I went to him unarmed.
He could be struck.
No, self-control is a strength.
Easily taken as weakness.
He'll say you backed down, as though guilty.
Guilty of what?
I don't know.
But they're all going over to his side.
Who?
My brother Agravain, Lucan, and others.
You are perplexing us.
Take this harness.
- It's your favorite.
- That's why I give it to you.
Lord, do not forsake us.
Do not forsake me.
I struggle against a death worse than death.
Deliver me from a temptation
I can hardly resist.
Their swords are on the right; they're from Gallesfort or Escalot.
From Escalot.
- What do they want?
- To see if we're still breathing.
Did I do right?
If you refused, it would be said that we are weak and cowardly.
A tournament is not war, and we know who will be the victor.
My faithful Lancelot.
We have a fortnight to prepare.
Has an angel descended or a tongue of fire licked our heads?
It is only a simple tournament, but look how happy they are.
And he twitches his ears.
Our luck is changing.
Not only Agravain and Mordred gaze at that window.
I too.
Guinevere is our one woman, our sun.
Let us try our lances.
Against each other?
What of our promise to Arthur?
- There is no risk.
- What if you skewer me?
Or I skewer you?
Why ask me to come here?
I know all is ended between us and that this must be.
It must.
I wanted to see you once more and then part.
I left my scarf here.
I'm sure of it.
Someone has been here.
What have we done?
Guinevere, my heart.
Take this heart, this soul; they belong to you.
It is your body I want.
Take this proscribed body.
Take it; revive it.
I am afraid.
I fear no one in the world.
I fear what awaits us.
Aren't you safe in my arms?
I won't always have them to protect me.
Always.
Poor Lancelot, trying to stand his ground in a shrinking world.
Where you are, Guinevere, the world is vast, limitless.
Hold me. I am no ghost.
Don't undress me.
Wait till tomorrow.
Don't go to the tournament.
When they've gone, come to my room.
Even without entering the list, he'll take all the honors.
He never claims other people's victories.
He has mettle and courage, but perhaps less than is supposed.
Wait here.
When his hand touches the latch, do not hesitate. Strike!
Suspecting nothing, he won't be armed.
And if he is?
Surprise; he'll have no time.
His blood on the floor here will unmask the adulterous traitor.
Fools will never understand his sort.
Luckily, he doesn't care.
He won't be carefree forever.
The hypocrite.
What do you mean, brother?
If Lancelot were here, you'd keep quiet.
You'd cringe like a dog. Beware.
Of you?
Of this blade that could run you through.
You're not going to fight.
Don't worry.
I'm not coming to the tournament.
I knew it.
Mordred, you read my thoughts.
Friendship works such wonders.
But I long to know your thoughts.
You will surely know them.
Good luck.
Lionel and I were defending you; now I look ridiculous.
Teach them a lesson at the tournament.
They yelp about you and besmirch your honor.
Your friends appear in the wrong and those blustering cowards in the right.
I'll silence them when the time comes.
The time has come.
Fetch a suit of white armor and a plain shield.
Saddle the bay and prepare two lances.
I'm going.
- At night, alone?
- Get a move on, fool.
And hold your tongue.
Forgive me, my love. I must.
I shall not be long.
I shall return tomorrow, and we shall be together all night.
Why isn't he with us?
Love, sire. Lancelot loves.
Whom?
The queen.
He is her knight.
He is more.
A monstrous lie.
It is the truth.
You're giving vent to jealousy.
He who accuses idly shall be punished.
I swear it.
That does not prove it.
I swear it is false.
What proof have you?
My word is enough.
Mordred, I order you to be silent.
Gawain, the conditions of the tournament?
Choice of adversaries.
Sharpened points, weakened lances.
It was his horse.
More than one bay has a white star on its brow.
Only one lance is a thunderbolt.
Only one knight charges with his guard down.
Mordred, admit that everything refutes you:
Hold your peace.
At other times, too, he's opposed us with visor lowered.
He can't do anything like anyone else.
He wanted to teach you a lesson.
Was it him?
My glancing blow left the point in his waist.
He was the victor.
He's wounded?
Lionel thinks so, but he's not sure.
What are you sure of?
Did you see his face?
Did he speak?
You are keeping something from me.
Only gossip and lies.
Do you understand Lancelot?
He had to put a stop to things.
For Lancelot, to decide is to strike.
You are all wrong.
It wasn't him at the tournament.
Lancelot has left here forever.
He has fled far away.
Lionel, where are you going?
To challenge Mordred.
My sword will prove he lied.
Only Lancelot's sword can prove that.
Anyway, he won't fight.
You can't chop his head off like a chicken's.
What's to stop me?
This is Lancelot's doing.
Carmaduc and Bohort are going to look for him.
Why doesn't Arthur act?
"He who accuses idly shall be punished."
Some force is manipulating us.
Arthur cannot govern it.
Find him quickly.
- News of Lancelot?
- No, but the forest is a devil.
An omen?
God keep his soul.
So Lancelot is dead?
The queen must choose a new knight.
Without delay.
If I could corner him...
The king is checked.
By the queen and a castle?
And this knight?
Gone. Flown. Dead.
You cheat, Mordred.
Not as you think.
Explain the move with a queen and a castle.
Can't you guess?
Stay where you are.
Keep out of reach of my sword.
Gawain, go away.
Don't stay here.
Are you giving orders?
On bended knee, I beg you listen.
You are being watched.
Here is your scarf, which I found in Mordred's quarters.
He says you return because criminals return to the scene of their crime.
What crime?
A crime that is punished horribly.
Gawain, once again, I tell you to go.
If you could do anything...
I'll dare all.
He who must save me will come here.
No one else can make me leave.
Except by force.
I wait for him here, alone with my pain, as I always have done.
Here I can be with him.
I talk to him, and he hears me.
My crime is that for one instant,
I doubted him.
A wound, some mystery is keeping him from me.
But he lives. I know it; I feel it.
He has not abandoned me.
Now go. Tell them that I love him and that I am wholly his.
Tell Arthur.
What are you waiting for?
I would give my life to save yours, but I fear it is too little to tip the balance.
Uncle, do not go in.
Do not judge her.
If you still cherish her above all else...
Do you doubt it?
Go quickly.
If there's a chance...
What are we doing?
His rage will be terrible.
We have no choice.
We seek a knight.
He may be wounded.
Nothing to say?
Nothing.
Not so tight.
Where were you?
Did you meet someone?
You should be dead.
But I am alive, and I am going.
In your condition?
What is it?
You are stupid, and you'll never understand anything.
Someone keeps calling me;
I must go.
Go, then, and be killed.
I go to live.
Lancelot, help!
I have come to rescue you, Guinevere.
Don't touch me.
I forbid you to come nearer.
You are covered in blood.
We must go. They're waiting.
Nothing to be seen; not a sound.
That means they are there.
Do you know who you killed to rescue the queen?
Two shadows.
It happened so quickly.
Agravain, Gawain's brother.
The other was Lucan.
He didn't deserve to live.
And Mordred?
We can wager that his sword is still virgin.
- Is the drawbridge up?
- Yes, and these ruins are sound.
- Food, water, fodder?
- Enough for a ten-year siege.
Siege? Lionel, Bohort, we are doing the attacking.
Where is Gawain?
Gawain killed by Lancelot?
God would not allow it.
My poor Gawain.
He is the victim of a murderer.
A traitor.
No, Gawain?
It was my fault.
Don't blame Lancelot.
I charged at him.
He parried and thrust without recognizing me.
You must tell him it was my duty to avenge Agravain.
For all else, my heart is with him.
We'll avenge you.
We'll avenge you and your brother.
Sire, I wanted...
What did you want?
You and I both wanted to save the queen.
Yes, I wanted to save her.
What we could not do,
Lancelot has done.
Uncle, listen to me this once.
All will die.
Listen to my counsel.
I am listening.
Gawain is dead.
Arthur offers...
He can offer nothing.
Lancelot had him under his horse's hooves.
Aiglin cried, "Kill him! End it!"
But Lancelot spared Arthur.
Arthur offers to take back the queen, but Lancelot must leave.
Arthur judges her innocent of adultery; there is no proof.
He swears respect and loyalty to save further bloodshed.
Too late; we refuse.
This is our last night.
Let us accept; time is running out.
I won't capitulate.
We must atone for so much bloodshed.
We can't restore the dead to life.
It was my duty to defend you.
Your duty now is to return me to Arthur.
I shall not give you up to him.
I delighted in deceiving him.
I despise him and loathe him.
I'll rid you of Arthur.
You didn't kill him yesterday.
If I only had, without a thought.
He would have killed you.
I'll send word I want to make peace.
He won't listen.
Right is on his side.
Right is not justice.
Forget justice.
Stay with me.
It is no longer possible.
I crave the impossible.
You have nothing more to ask of me;
I have nothing more to give you.
What I could do, I have done.
I loved you more than anyone has ever loved.
You lie.
You will never cease to love me.
I shall suffer instead.
You choose suffering?
I have chosen nothing.
If I could see into your heart.
You see it.
It bleeds; it is torn.
How could I leave you?
Perhaps God demands it.
He demands nothing.
The woman made for me was not made for me?
Truth is falsehood?
Leave this woman while there is still time, of your own free will.
If I leave you, what remains for me?
Our faith in each other, our promise to each other.
I cannot be but where you are.
Even if I am a burden?
Let me go.
For the first time, you bid me farewell.
For the last time too.
No, you are in my hands.
I'll not let you escape me.
It is nearly time.
I must hold on to you.
I shall walk looking neither right nor left.
What is the matter?
Carmaduc has come to tell us:
Mordred stayed behind at the castle.
He has mustered support and intends to challenge Arthur's rule.
What say you?
You, Lionel, ask that? To horse!
For Arthur, against Mordred!
Guinevere.
[military march]
I have a nice load of ladies for you this morning.
Them city dick turd packing hookey motherfuckers have drafted... my main man away.
They'll send you off to kill Chinks.
Who's gonna take care of the vineyards for me on the street?
Look son, I don't care what you mother says.
You're doing the right thing by joining up now. Get the service out of the way.
You're fighting a real war over there, boy. It's not like your make up stories.
You're always bragging about how you ran off and joined up.
It's good enough for you.
- Vinnie...
- Come on, Jill.
Vinnie, I've got work to do.
You've got work to do?
What am I, going to a picnic?
Hey, where you going?
Excuse me, Inspector. You think
J. Edgar Hoover would fire you?
Well, the cuffs have got to stay on.
Bets, about last night, I...
Well, I just...
I want you to know...
Don't worry, Billy.
I wanted to.
It'll make me feel closer while you're away.
Well, take care of your ass, nigger.
Take care.
You take care of yourself, you hear.
You relax, just relax.
I'll get out of this.
I'll kiss the sergeant or something.
Hey, peace, man.
Make love, not war, man.

That is if anybody even wants to read about what happens... to a bunch of guys they're gonna send to Vietnam.
- Hey, look at them guys march.

Hey, you think we're gonna get machine guns?
I don't know. What do I look like, an information booth over here?

Yeah.
All right, you people, listen up.
You are now at the US Marine Corps recruit depot San Diego, California.
When you left home, you were under your mother's care, you are now... under mine. From now on, you will not eat, sleep, blow your nose... or scratch your ass until someone tells you to do so.
I am going to give you approximately
30 seconds to fall out of this bus... and god help the last man off because you better give your soul to god... because your ass is mine.
Do you understand?

Move. Get out. Get out.
You get out of the bus right now.

What are you looking at, Hollywood?
Straight eyes.
I don't owe you no money.
Man, we got
Jesus Christ with us today.
What are you looking at? You should be looking at your father...
God, not me.
Do you find something funny?
Get on fucking knees... and you be his disciple.
You freaking...
You find again something funny, huh?
Listen, man...
- Listen, man?
- I don't want any hassles.
I mean, I like you. I like you.
I ain't gonna give you no hassle,
I like you too.
- Okay.
- Maybe you love me?
- Yeah, I love you. I love everybody.
- Very good.
I love you, too.
Maybe one day we'll get married.
If you don't get your shit together, you ain't even have to worry... about getting engaged!
Okay?
What?!
- All right, sir!
- Thank you very much!
You find something funny?
- Did you eat shit this morning?
- No, sir.
Then why the fucking shit eating grin?
What do you mean?
Don't even start to explain yourself.
You're a bad fucking excuse.
Get up on your goddamn feet, you shit head!
Come on, snap to!
Hollywood, what are you looking at?
Take off those goddamn glasses before I yank them off you.
Hey, god dammit.
You, with the fucking pretty face.
What are you spitting on the ground for?
- What is that shit in your mouth?
- Chewing tobacco, sir.
- it's what?!
- Chewing tobacco, sir!
What the hell are you doing, chewing tobacco in your mouth?
I don't know sir.
I chew when I play baseball.
Do you think this looks like a baseball stadium?
- No sir, it doesn't.
- Then what the hell... are you chewing tobacco for?
You got on the wrong fucking train?
- Or did they draft you?
- No, sir. I enlisted, sir.
- You did what?!
- I enlisted in the marines, sir.
What the hell did you do a thing like that for?!
- Answer me, god dammit!
- I wanna be a marine, sir.
What the hell for?
- So I can fight for my country, sir.
- You fucking turd!
Right now I can't stand to look at you.
Sergeant, get this shit out of my fucking face.
I'm Sgt. Loyce.
I'm your drill instructor for the next two fucking months, maggots.
Jesus. How in the hell do they expect me to train fucking marines... when they won't even send me human goddamn beings to start with!
Sergeant, get these fucking people through receiving barracks.
I'm gonna help you out. I don't wanna drop any of their fucking civilian... slime on the way through. Jesus!
When you are told to do so, you will reach down by your right foot...
...pick up your bags, empty the contents on the table in front of you.
You will empty your pockets and place the contents of your pockets... on the table in front of you.
Do it, now!
What do you got in your back pocket?
- A diary.
- Contraband, get rid of it!
What do you got in your pocket?
All right, Technicolor rubber.
- I bet you're a virgin, aren't you?
- I lost it when I was 13.
- What?
- I lost it when I was 13, sir!
Contraband, get rid of it.
- What's in the plastic there, private?
- Cookies from my girlfriend, sir.
Bullshit, contraband, put it on the table.
Oh, what do we have here?
A little faggot, huh?
Get your jewelry off there, sweetheart, and put it on the table.
What do you have in your pocket there, lipstick?
Jesus.
Put the goddamn thing on the table!
You will answer the following questions.
Have you ever had any sexual act with another man?
With an animal?
Do you wet your bed?
Do you like to wear women's clothing?
How often do you masturbate?
- Where's your belt, private?
- What?
- Where's your belt?
- Well, I don't know. Where's his?
I'm asking you private.
Where's your belt?
I must have left it in my bed.
You get your belt and you better report back to me when you're through.
- You understand?
- Okay.
- You get your belt too.
- Yes, sir.
Unhook.
Move it out, guys.
Get out there.
Move it out.
Move it out.
Go, go, go, go.
Asshole!
Get up there.
Move it up to the private in front of you in file.

Very nice.
Yeah.
Do Jesus real good there for me.
I want to see Jesus' bald head.
Huh, Jesus? Huh?

Try to stay in step with the private in front of you.
Keep your head always up.
Move it up.
Get in there.
Move. Move. Move.
All right, you maggots.
Listen up.
We're gonna say your Marine Corps prayer.
You will repeat after me.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
I will fear no evil... for I am the biggest, baddest, meanest motherfucker in the valley.
For I am the biggest, baddest meanest motherfucker in the valley.
When I tell you to prepare to mount you will say "Prepare to mount" after me.
You're will say "Aye, aye, sir."
Then you will do it as I give you the command.
- Prepare to mount.
- Prepare to mount, aye, aye, sir.
Do it.
At attention worms.
At attention.
You will repeat after me.
- Gung ho.
- Gung ho.

- Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.
- Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.
Revelry you at 0430.
You boneheads go to sleep.
Who the fuck is Chesty?
[laughter]
Who's gung ho?
[more laughter]
Hey, what do you think, we're gonna get to shoot tomorrow?
Oh, great, they got bizzaro over there, one of those gung ho types.
Hey, what the hell is that?
It's the only paper
I could find to write on.
Oh, yeah?
Tell me, what are you writing, a note to your asshole?
- No, it's sort of like a journal, sort of.
- Oh, a journal, huh?
Why don't you write in your notebook or something like that?
You saw them, they took my notebook.
They did?
What's that under your pillow then,
Swiss cheese? What?
- Hey, that's it.
- Hey...
This is mine.
This is my notebook.
That's right.
- Hey, how'd you get it?
- I don't reveal my sources.
I didn't register because I figured if they got you, they got you.
If they don't, they don't.
Well, they got me.
I guess that's my karma coming out the Marines.
Shoot
I knew the Army could draft you, but did you know the Marines can draft you?
The guy at the recruiting office told me that if I can prove myself as a writer... he could get me assigned to public information in the Marines.
- Oh, yeah?
- Right.
So I can write about all the stuff we do around here. And then... if we get sent to Vietnam
I can get into combat information...
...write about the war.
- Combat?
- Yeah.
- You wanna get into combat?
- I'm gonna write about it.
What, are you kidding me?
Listen, I'll tell you something.
The only thing I wanna get into is how I'm gonna get the hell out of here.
And Vinnie Fazio is gonna get his ass out of here.
- Out of boot camp?
- Yeah, out of boot camp.
- Good luck.
- Good luck?
Hey, listen.
You gotta know the angles.
I've seen a golf range on the base on the way in.
All the hoi polloi use the golf range.
All you gotta do is move in, get with the people that can help you.
That's what I'm talking about.
Well, you're gonna have to do it without me.
I'm not going.
I'm getting out of here.
- I'm not killing anybody.
- Hey...
What's the matter with you, you chicken?
Shit.
Pussy.
Hey, what are you doing, son?
And what are you doing, son?
You're gonna get warts, boy?
Hey, stop shouting, you jerk!
Jerkin' himself off!
Give me back my blanket.
Shut up!
You listen to me dip shit.
And I ain't gonna repeat myself.
Don't mess with me.
Don't mess near me.
Don't bring no heat down on me.
You're all headed for a fall and
I ain't taking the ride. Do you dig?
You just stay clear of Tyrone.
Because your all a bunch of fuck ups.
And you're all gonna die.
Every last one of you.
You too, dipshit.
Platoon 163.
Sir, Platoon 163.
Aye, aye sir.
Get on the road.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Hurry up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
What are you doing on my grass, private, huh?!
Move, move, move.
You wanna rest on that grass?
Get in line!
Move it down.
Move it down.
Oh, what do we have here?
Nice fucking move sweetheart.
When we come out of the village we're fully dressed, you understand me?
Do I make myself clear?!
Oh, Christ, my nuts!
- Do you like your nuts?
- Let go, man, what are you doing?!
You don't talk to me like that.
- Do you like your nuts?
- Yeah.
- You want some?
- Shit, yeah.
- Do you wanna keep them?
- Yeah.
All of you son of a bitches, grab your fucking nuts.
Right now, grab your nuts!
You too, you freak.
All of you guys grab your nuts.
- Grab your fucking nuts.
- Get a hold of them.
- Do you like them?
- Yes, sir.
- Do they feel good to you?
- Yes, sir.
If you fucking guys wanna keep them son of a bitches...
...you better listen to your drill instructors.
I'm trying to help you keep them.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Do you think your girlfriends is gonna love it if you come back without them?
No, sir.
If you come back without your balls they're gonna find another guy.
Did you understand what I'm saying to you?
Yes, sir!
I've got eight weeks to train you... to think, to act, to be one.
I'll have to make you depend on each other.
I have to make you a fighting Marines unit.
Look around you.
You like the man next to you?
You think he's a nigger or that one's a Jew or that one's a spik!
I don't care.
That motherfucker is gonna save your life one day!
And you better depend on you buddy.
And you're buddy's buddy.
- You understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yes, sir.
Sergeant!
Explain your two tours to these people... and clean this shit off the fucking street.
I spent 26 months in Vietnam.
And I can tell you right goddamn now, privates... if you don't pay attention to what's happening here in the recruit training... and learn, you're gonna come back from
Vietnam in a goddamn plastic body bag.
Right now the casualty rate for young Marines is over 50 percent.
If you don't pay attention, you are gonna be that private in the body bag.
September 1, 1967.
We can't seem to do anything right.
In fact, half of us don't even know our right from our left.
Sgt. Loyce says if Uncle Sam is counting on our platoon... to win the war for him, he's betting on the wrong side.
Without my rifle I am useless.
[gunshots]
Undoubtedly, you people have set some kind of a new record today.
You have fucked over these weapons so goddamn bad... they'll probably never fire again!
Let's move.
Oh, come on, baby, pull that out.
Get out of here!
Peace!
Kill, kill, kill!
Come on, Alvin.
Protect yourself, Alvin.
Alvin, get up, get up.
- Come on man, get up now.
- Come on Alvin, get up.
Protect yourself!
Come on Alvin, get up.
Protect yourself.
- Pop it!
- Hey, man!
Why'd you get on my foot, boy?
All right, move it up.
Quickly. Quickly.
Jesus, get your ass back there.
Go over that goddamn bar.
Let see a little goddamn teamwork.
Quickly!
God damn it, you're in combat!
AK-47s are firing over your head.
They'll tear your asshole the size of a goddamn basketball.
Move it up.
Get over there. Get over there.
- How's my time, sir?
- Good work, but you lost, dummy.
You left the half of your goddamn platoon behind the enemy lines!
Come on, get moving.
Don't wait.
Don't you wait for him.
Shit!
Faster private!
God damn it, Washington, you just put two private's on a trip wire.
You just wiped out everybody in a 50 meter radius, you dummy.
You wiped me out!
Go!
[splash]
God damn it, teamwork.
You're all dead!
Get in the fucking water.
Get in the water.
Get in the fucking water.
You're all dead.
Get over there Washington, quickly.
You're dead!
The VC just heard you and you're dead!
And you can thank that man.
Washington, you're instructors have been telling you for weeks...
...to pull together, pull together.
But he let you get wiped out.
That's all it takes, one fuck up.
You look like shit.
So I'm going to give you a shit detail that will help you pull together.
Let's get this goddamn aircraft loaded.
Let's get this aircraft loaded.
Get them moving.
Hey, Billy Ray Pike.
Billy the Vile.
Damn, you ain't Smoke Spaulding, are you?
In the flesh, bro, in the flesh.
You know, I got me a nice soft desk job here.
I'm the company clerk. You know,
I thought that was your name I saw...
- on that telegram I got the other day.
- What telegram?
Your D.l.'s got it, man.
Betsy's up at Ocean side, and the Marines...
- Wait man, Betsy's here?
- What a hole in the wall!
- Full of sailors.
- Shit man. She might need me bad.
Hey man, you gotta...
Can I get to see her?
- Can you give me a pass?
- Hold your horses.
Don't get your balls in an uproar.
Look...
I gotta take some stuff op tomorrow and I'm gonna a private to help me...
[gunshots]
Goddamn shit.
Oh, my god!
Christ Almighty!
Shit! God, no!
- Who's in charge here?
- The Lieutenant, sir.
The Lieutenant.
Is that your Lieutenant?
Leave me. Leave me.
Get away.
- Are you all right?
- Alvin...
- What the hell.
- I'm okay, nothing happened.
Damn bastards.
Just trying to make fools of us.
I knew they were just trying to scare us.
They did a good job on you, Billy Ray.
You almost pissed in your pants.
Bullshit.
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.
What seems to be going on here?
Well, sir, it looks like we just wiped out your entire platoon here.
We got an airplane and two trucks beside.
Now, sir, I'm afraid there has been mistake.
These people die at my command.
Excuse me, you gentlemen are all dead.
Will you please lie down?
I'm their drill instructor.
This a recruit platoon...
Are you all right?
All right? Hey, I knew they were blanks the whole time.
El Toro called up and they said they had an emergency shipment...
...that had to go to Vietnam.
I volunteered my privates... to come up here and now they are involved in some kind...
- of a silly ass war game.
- Excuse me, sir.
This is not a game.
This is an advance combat tactical exercise and these men are all dead.
Now, lay down, that's an order!
Come here, Lieutenant.
May I have a word with you?
You're dead. You're dead.
Get down.
Get down!
What is all this stuff anyway?
- HQ111 Marine Air Force, Da Nang.
- RVN. What's RVN?
Republic of Vietnam.
This stuff is going to Vietnam, Alvin.
What is this?
Ouch!
What the hell is this?
I don't know.
Hey, Fazio.
- Foster, what is this stuff?
- We don't know.
I think it's a giant rubber.
Put it over your head,
Pike, you're a big prick.
Shit.
Hey, look here, man.
Looks like an airbag or something.
I don't think so.
Hey, I got it, you sleep in it.
It's a lightweight, sleeping bag.
Look at this!
Hey, look at this.
It's for sleeping, man.
I can sleep all night in this thing.
Hey, Billy...
Billy, if you fall asleep in that, you won't wake up.
It says it's a body bag.
What's a body bag?
What's a body bag?
That's what they ship the stiffs in.
Damn, the zipper is stuck.
Get me out of here.
Get me out!
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, take it easy.
Hey, Alvin, are you still writing about that creepy shit?
Listen, I'm gonna show this to the public information officer.
This is a story
I can really say something about.
I mean, the way they stick somebody in one of those bags...
...seal it up and send it off?
It's like a neat little convenient package.
And nobody even thinks about what's inside.
Yeah?
Nobody ever looks inside.
Alvin, Alvin, look at this.
This is that driving range I was telling you about. Look at this.
And look, look at the full bird colonel out there.
And look at the legs on the chick his playing with.
Well, I'm gonna be that guy's Caddie.
I'm not fooling around here, no more.
- Hey, Vinnie, no, no...
- Hey, hey, listen...
You only got one shot, right?
I mean, it's not like you got forever, you know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Okay, see you.
Take it easy, man.
Stupid motherfucker.
What else can we do?
You know...
You see...
I heard about, you know, down in Tijuana... they got real doctors.
They ain't like it as here.
You're allowed to...
You know. I mean...
- I can get the money.
- I have the money.
It's just ain't the right time now.
It's just not the right time.
You see?
I see.
Baby...
I gotta go.
Please don't leave yet.
Halt. Who goes there?
Hey, you!
- [gunshots.]
- Goddamn! Oh, Goddamn!
Jesus!
You son of a bitch, you didn't have to shoot me.
Well, you scared the shit out of me, asshole.
Goddamn!
Sir, here are the agents of Hanoi who have come to fuck the Marine Corps, sir.
Which one is the Dago, Fazio?
Ain't he the cute one?
It says here, he was trying to get his end in with the Colonel's daughter...
...out on the driving range.
Let me tell you this, private.
We'll take care of your overactive sex drive in here.
We got us a Foster, Alvin, apprehended by public information...
...for disseminating classified and subversive material.
- No, sir, that was...
- Quiet, Billy Ray.
AWOL and resisting arrest.
Sir, private's wounded, sir.
Quit your whining you candy ass turd!
You ain't got nothing but a scratch!
And you, what are you doing bleeding all over my floor?
Sir, this prisoner is by nature a filthy hippie.
He was trying to desert, but he was so high on marijuana... that he tripped and fell into the barbed wire, sir.
That's a lie.
I'm sorry.
That's a lie, sir.
Don't you wanna be n the Marine Corps, Private?
Don't you want to fight for your country?
Sir, the war in Vietnam is a purely, internal, civil war.
- Do you believe that crap?
- Yes, I believe that.
You're all fucking communists.
Sergeant...
Get this faggots out here. See if you can teach them how to walk around... without falling down and hurting themselves all the time.
About face!
Move out!
♫ Don't wanna fight ♫
♫ War is hell so we might as well
Make love tonight ♫
♫ Oh, put down your gun
Let's have some fun by the moonlight. ♫
Hey, there Jethro, what for they stick us in this outfit?
They got more niggers in this platoon than the Oakland fucking Raiders.
Sambo, why don't you get some of that whitewash on your black ass there?
Hey, boy, what you going inside for there, boy?
I thought the hot sun don't bother you.
[banging]
Sir, Private Washington requests permission to speak with...
- the drill instructor, sir.
- Speak.
Sir, Private Washington requesting permission to enter the duty office, sir.
Enter.
Sit down.
You've met our four new replacements yet?
Their drill instructors call them the four fucking stooges.
Replacements?
Man, I ain't no fool.
Those fucks won't last a week out there.
And anybody who's gotta depend on them is already dead meat.
I don't believe that.
But I'll tell you what, Washington.
I respect your judge of character.
You think they're anymore fucked ups in the rest of the shit we got in this...
- goddamn platoon?
- No, shit.
Why don't you just march the whole fucking platoon right here... blow their damn brains out right here... cause you're gonna end up killing all of us.
I'm not the goddamn one, Washington, that's killing these people.
It's you, asshole.
You're the one!
- Not me.
- That's bullshit. That's Bullshit.
That's bullshit!
Let me tell you something,
Washington.
I've got one hell of a shitty goddamn job here.
They send me 60 to 80 buckets of civilian shit... and expect me to train them to become combat-goddamn-ready marines.
I've got to send these people to Vietnam.
I'm the one that has to send them.
They're gonna come back in bags.
They're gonna come back in wheelchairs.
They're gonna be maimed.
They're gonna be fucked up people when they come back.
It's up to me how they come back.
And you, asshole,
Washington, you're not motivated.
You're not motivated at all.
You can fucking help me.
But no, hell no.
You've got your goddamn head up your ass all the time.
You're playing your own silly ass goddamn game.
But I tell you one thing, hippie, you're gonna start playing my game... or you're gonna find yourself in combat in Vietnam... and you're gonna have Charlie shooting at you from the front... and the four Stooges are gonna be shooting at you from the rear.
Sir, are you talking to me man to man?
Yeah, I'm talking to you, man to man.
Then will you remove your hat, sir so I could face you eye to eye.
I don't mind at all, Washington, if it's gonna help you out.
Okay, sir, what do you want me to do, huh?
I mean, what the fuck do you want me to do, man?
You want me to...
You want me to be a good nigger... so you can march those boys out of the brig, is that it?
No, Washington, I don't want...
Goddamn, I don't want a good nigger!
I want a goddamn man that's out there pushing these people.
Somebody they can trust, somebody that they know is trying to help them.
I want somebody that they can count on in Vietnam.
I don't want them to be afraid to fall down... because they know somebody's behind them to pick them up and stand them back up on their goddamn feet.
I got eight fucking weeks to teach these goddamn people... what it took you to 20 years to learn on the streets.
Now, you show me that kind of a goddamn nigger... and I'll give you a platoon that will stand by you.
A platoon that will save your ass in combat, Washington.
And they will save their own asses, too.
Teamwork, goddamn it.
Teamwork.
Yes, sir.
Sir...
Can you get them back?
Yeah, I can get them back. But I'll you one fucking thing right now, hippie.
You start this lone wolf shit again on me... and I'll stick you with a maggoty ass bunch of goddamn shit... you've ever seen in your life.
You are bound to get fucking killed... in the first week in Vietnam.
Get them back.
- I got your goddamn word?
- You got my goddamn word.
All right.
Go out there and get rid of that...
Those four fucking scumbags.
Send them beck where the fuck they came from... and I'll go down to the brig and I'll pull some strings...
- and I'll get our people back.
- Thank you. Sir.
You don't have to thank me.
Oh, shit.
Hey, boys, here comes our pickaninny friend again.
What's the matter boy, they quit giving away fried chicken in there?
Excuse me sir, but do you mind moving your asshole downwind of me?
- You said what?
- Oh, I'm sorry, that's your mouth.
I didn't see the teeth. Hey man, anybody could have made a mistake.
[multiple kicks and painful yells]
[cheering and laughter]
October 7, 1967.
Now we can't seem to do anything wrong.
We're good and we know it.
We're the biggest, baddest, meanest mothers in the valley.
I still don't know if we can win the war single-handed.
But I feel sorry for anyone who gets in our way.
Harch!
Rifle salute.
Harch!
Arms at ease!
Perfect. Perfect.
Outstanding, girls.
Haarch!
Hold on in front, you're running away.

Settle down.

You are now a marine.
I am proud to be the first to call you marines.
[jet plane whooshes over]
At 1400 hours you will receive your orders... assigning you to advance training.
Due to an urgent demand for additional Marine manpower... by the Navy's Mediterranean fleet... only half this series will be assigned to combat duty in Vietnam.
The other half will receive orders for sea duty.
Drill instructors take charge and dismiss your platoon.
Attention.
- Platoon 163 dismissed.
- [March music in.]
Platoon 163 dismissed!
Aye, aye, sir!
[cheering]
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.
Come on. You got a 50-50 chance to go on a sea duty.
What are you talking about? Buford's been looking at me the same way... he looked when he found out
I was trying to hump his daughters.
I wound up in the brig, right?
I'll only wind up in Vietnam.
No, no, no, listen. He can't change orders, they're already written.
Honest, listen.
In two weeks, you'll be in a beach somewhere in Italy, take my word.
God, sea duty.
I got to get it.
All right, man. Well, just think good thoughts. Think good karma... and you will get it man, sea duty.
Sea duty, think sea duty, you know.
- Sea duty, sea duty, sea duty.
- Spaulding, man, he could swing it.
Yeah, you say things are dry on the street.
Hey, man, well, before you know, traffics gonna start to flow.
It will be coming in on a C-130 and Uncle Sam is paying the postage.
Is it safe?!
Spoon, it's air-tight and waterproof.
With Marine guards and a band to boot.
I love it.
All right.
You too, brother, easy.
All right, last two people for sea duty.
Daugherty M.
Fazio V.
You did it! That's it!
What's the matter, garlic breath, you don't like boat?
- You get seasick?
- Oh no, I love boats. I love boats!
Boats, the Mediterranean Alvin!
Sorry, Sir, but we got a change of orders.
- Private Vincent Fazio...
- Fazio, that's me.
-I'm out of here man.
Signed by Colonel Buford...
- a new friend of yours.
- Buford?
Don't be getting your nut off yet, private. Get back in formation.
You are now an O-300.
Col. Buford doesn't like people... to come around and get a little pussy off of his daughters.
- What's O-300?
- He just changed your orders.
- O-300, basic infantryman.
- Does that mean Vietnam?
Yeah.
Goddamn right, it means Vietnam, numb nuts.
Goddamn it,
O-300 is basic infantryman.
O-3 fucking hundred is the United States Marine corp.
Goddamn, bag of shit.
Now, I want you people over here to get in this truck over here.
We're going to Pendleton. And you, people, from here on over... jump in the 6 by 8 it's by right here.
Quickly, let's get it done.
Come on girls.
Washington, come here.
I just want you to know,
Washington, I'm watching you.
You're under surveillance all the time. You fuck up in Vietnam... somebody's gonna tell me.
I swear to god...
I'll jump up on a goddamn troop transport... and come over and straighten your ass out. Now, get in the fucking truck.

January 4, 1968.
Vinnie finally got his boat ride.
And I finally have some time to catch up with my journal... after three tough months of advanced training. The Marine Corp... prepared us for everything except our new company commander.
It's easy to see what's in your minds as we steam for far-off angry shores.
So I'd like to share with you some figures that have come my way. Gunny?
From 1961 until this past summer 1967, only 13,000 Americans... have died in combat in Vietnam.
You, you step forward.
That means... of the 110 men in C company, the chances are only two... will die. I find that pretty reassuring. Thank you, men.
I have a theory as to why we aren't doing as well as we might in Vietnam.
Our thinking is shaped by the games we grow up with.
The VC don't play by our rules. They grew up with a game that demands... constant movement and fluid shifting strategy.
Now while you're on the ship, you will all learn to play their game.
And, gentlemen, their game is soccer.
Soccer?
Kiss my ass.
All right, you catch up with the ball and kick it into the goal... before it hits the white line.
You ready? You got to run. Go!
Come on, Fazio. Go.
Lt. Archer, sir?
Sir, some of the men were talking about Captain Collins' theory.
And I was curious about what you think of it.
Well, Foster...
I... I think it's bullshit.
January 9, 1968.
Maybe Lt. Archer is right about the Captain 's theory... on how soccer can help us beat the enemy. But at least, playing soccer... keeps us from thinking about the Captain's other theory... and wondering if he's right that only two guys in the company will die.
Anyways, he's get me keeping stats on the team... but I'm using the time to write in this journal. Vinnie says... if I play my cards right, this journal could prove my writing ability... and get me a desk job, behind the lines, writing propaganda.
But what I wanna do, is get in to combat and write about the real thing.
I guess I won't have to wait much longer.
We're docking at Cam Ranh Bay,
Republic of Vietnam.
Hello, you darlings.
Dave, how do you say
"how much"?
[foreign language]
- She says 300 Piestas.
- 300 Piestas? What am I, the bank?
- How much is 300 Piestas?
- That's about three bucks.
Three bucks... to get laid?!
Hey!
That's what I'm talking about!
Come on, man.
[booing]
Keep your hands off my girl.
Hey, watch it.
You big asshole.
[explosion]
[Voice over PA]: General quarters.
All hands man your battle stations.
Come on, come on, up.
Look out, we're the bad ass boys of
Company C are coming to save you ass.
Go, go, go.
Move, move, move.
Come on, come on, come on.
Al! Al!
I got the price down to two bucks.
[explosion]
What's the fuck is wrong with you?
Get out of here now! Let's move!
- Wait.
- Move!
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.
Goddamn it, come on!
Leave it, damn it!
Hurry! It's coming in here.
[explosion]
Captain, in here!
We've got to check on transportation.
Lieutenant, get them all there.
I gotta check on the transportation.
Go on! In here, in here!
Move, move, move!
Come, you guys, let's go.
Move it, line up. Come on, move.
Move, line up!
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go, on the double!
[explosion]
Get your ass inside there!
Move!
- OK, go back.
- Fazio, what the hell are doing?!
- I got it down to one buck.
- Get the hell inside!
Move people move.
Pull in the rear. Attention!
Now, drop your duffle bags.
Drop your pants, this won't last a second.
I am going to have to insert this, take a little sample.
- It won't hurt.
- OK, I speak English.
You've got cold hands, little lady.
- It's Lieutenant.
- Sorry, Sir... Miss. Whatever.
What's the fuck's going on here?
With all due respect, sir, this is an army matter.
These people are under quarantine and will not be returned to the States... until they've been checked and treated for VD.
We must consider the loved ones and wives back home.
That's absolute bullshit.
- People, please put on your trousers.
- Sir, I said the right...
Sergeant! These people just got in the country five minutes ago!
They're United States Marines, not the goddamn army.
Men, the airbase is shut down by incoming rockets.
Looks like we're gonna be stranded here for a couple of days.
Now, there is a vital army convoy leaving for Long Khe in the morning.
General Dearborne up there is goddamn anxious to get it through safely... and I volunteered Company C to ride shotgun.
We're gonna show that Army General what a few good Marines can do.
Get in bed early.
We leave first thing in the morning.
What the hell are these nurses doing in here?
- You won't believe me if I told you sir.
- Well get them out of here before... somebody jumps them, for Chrissakes.
January 10, 1968.
The convoy staffed at dawn.
Before we left, this army major gave us a big speech... on how vital and urgent it was to get the convoy through safely... to General Dearborne up at Long Khe.
The country is beautiful, it's so quiet.
It's herd to believe there's a war going on.
- Do you play guitar?
- Oh yeah, you kidding me?
- Here.
- You do?
- Hold on, Fazio.
- Hold my rifle for me.
I got it.
Come on, Tom, you and do me do some blues. Give me some of that...
West side Chicago stuff.
[blues music]
Well, you play like you've got some black in you.
- He does.
- Come on, baby.
♫ Hey, streets of Chicago... ♫
♫ that gets cold at night... ♫
♫ We've learned some good things... ♫
♫ and it's good to learn to fly... ♫
The pause that refreshes.
While we were stopped, the Captain spotted some...
Vietnamese kicking a ball around here. That was all he needed.
Billy is really a hotshot.
The Captain calls him twinkle toes... and says with e star like Billy we could put together e greet team.
What good that would do us, nobody seems to know.
The Captain keeps getting lost.
But we 're not complaining.
And every time we stopped, someone tries to sell us something.
We're having a great time.
But I just keep wondering about those poor army guys sweating it out... waiting for us up at Long Khe.
Get on that radio and get a recovery vehicle down.
And get this road clear on the double. Do it now.
I've got a working party. Get this thing cleared in a minute, skipper.
Don't touch anything at all. This whole goddamn place could be boobied.
We've got to get out of here.
Hey, Alvin, goddamn it! Put the camera away. Are you crazy?
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all, we're sitting ducks.
All right get back in here.
We're moving out, back it up!
No, Captain, you're gonna bunch us up!
We can turn around in that clearing and let's get the fuck out of here.
- Go, go!
- Keep your interval.
Do not bunch up.
Keep your distance.
Back, back, back.
All right, people, get down and men the flanks.
Keep your distance, keep your distance.
Don't bunch up.
Do not bunch up.
Keep your interval.
You must keep your interval.
[explosion]
Dismount, people, get out of here.
Get the hell out of the way, damn it!
Dismount, people.
Keep your distance, people.
[machine gun fire]
Get on my shoulder man and you be cool here.
I'm gonna make a tourniquet for your leg. And you hold on to it... you hold it tight, or you're gonna die!
[explosion]
I see him. You wanna fight?
Come on, Lieutenant, let's stay on this motherfucker.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, please. Over.
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, please. Over.
The boys have been hit hard.
Better call the MEDEVAC in.
No time for a goddamn MEDEVAC.
We're getting the shit blown out of us.
If I don't get some air cover, we will be blasted.
[machine gun fire]
You son of a bitch!
Asshole!
You... you motherfucking goop!
Delta 5, this Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, over.
- Where's my RTO?
- He got hit, skipper.
I don't believe this.
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, over!
He's gone.
Must have had a tunnel.
Lieutenant, you're sure he's not still there?
What the hell do you mean, are you sure he's not still there, man?
You come bursting across the damn field with that big ass gun.
We had him trapped, we had him cornered.
We were gonna maim that motherfucker.
One MEDEVAC is not is not enough, goddamn it!
We're bleeding, we need more! Why can't I get what I want around here?!
Jesus christ!
Captain!
- You got your two dead men.
- Easy, private.
Private, I don't have to take that shit from you. Now listen to me!
It could not be helped. This is a war and people die! Now we got a job to do.
We are taking a convoy to Long Khe and it's vital and it's urgent.
This convoy will save hundreds of men and two lives are a small price to pay!
- Easy, baby.
- Bullshit!
- Bullshit?!
- Bullshit, Captain!
At ease!
Is that your fucking vital supply, sir?
How many lives is this gonna save?
You son a bitch!
We're dying out here... so that some shit bird general can have his fucking pork steak!
Come on. Take it easy.
We must be having a vital and urgent sale... a vital and urgent sale at the PX, huh, Captain?!
Out, out! Get it all out.
Happy birthday, Gen. Dearborne.
Here is your new mobile whorehouse.
Compliments of Charlie Company!
Was it worth all this, Captain?
Was it worth it?
I didn't know.
Is it the Captain's job to kill his own men?!
- Son of a bitch!
- The Major told me it was urgent.
- I didn't know! Son of a bitch!
- Come on. We gotta call in...
I didn't know! God damn it.
What the fuck? I did not know!
I never saw a dead body before.
They look real small.
You've never seen a stiff, huh?
- Did you?
- Yeah.
Well, not in real life, you know.
Just... on TV.
It's not the same.
January 11, 1968.
Our vital Army convoy finally got through to the U.S. Army Base... at Long Khe.
General Dearborne commanding.
The Captain says that since we've shown the general... what e few good marines can do, he's given us 24 hours liberty.
T24 hours to eat, drink, smoke and screw.
After what we've been through,
I don't know if we've got the energy.
But I know we left two guys back there who'd have wished they had a chance.
Hey, do you want to buy some ears, man?
I'm just glad I'll never be able to see the sorry looking bunch... of Army fuck-ups that they died for.
Look at this!
Esther Williams Swimming Pool...
Beauty Parlor and Bowling.
That figures.
Hey, Albert. Albert!
The Nikon's here.
Trade in that toy now and get a real camera.
I think I'm gonna.
Madame Cocos Steam Bath,
Massage and Health Club!
- Where?
- Follow the arrows.
- That's nothing. Look at here.
- Prime Cut Steak House... home of Armed Force Television,
Channel 4, movie theater, snack bar.
Hey, man, now that ain't gonna be se bad. Everything you ever wanted... in a whole fucking world is right here, on this base.
Hey man, I wonder where the Base Hospital is?
Let's get out of here.
- Yo, Vinnie!
- What?
- Where is the Base Hospital?
- Hospital?
- Hospital?
- You take care of my shit.
I'm gonna go out here and check out this new turf.
Oh, look at this, more stuff.
Now what am I, a closet?
Oh, don't do anything.
Just stand there, Alvin.
That's right.
Okay, you're ready to go out there and show them what's what?
- Alight!
- I thought you're gonna sleep though.
I can't sleep, you know. I've been sitting so long I get all cramped up.
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
All right, let's go. Let's have action.
You should have joined the Army,
Bisbee.
I didn't join, sir.
I told you already, I can't refill that prescription. It's a narcotic.
Come on, it's just some little pills they gave me back in boot camp.
Look, Private, I'm off duty.
Sick call's in the morning.
Hey, you got to give me something.
Wait a minute, goddamn it.
[whistling]
Come here, man. I'm not gonna talk to you out on the street. Come on.
I want you to do some of this stuff, man.
I mean, this is gonna set you right partner, no lie.
Oh, man, are you crazy? I ain't gonna shoot none of that shit in my veins.
Oh, I don't blame you, man.
I mean, I hate needles myself.
You just...
Now, I don't do drugs.
I don't want to get hooked on dope.
I just... I've been taking some little pills that's all.
They gave them to me in boot camp for pain. Demerol.
Demerol?
And what you think Demerol is?
Some guy in a lab... he cooks this stuff up into little pills, he sticks it in a bottle...
- it's the same as this.
- Yeah, like hell it is.
Well, there's just one way to find out, huh, sport?
I need enough to circulate in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles.
Everybody's out, everything is dry.
I'm here to represent all the dryness there.
I need to meet the big man, here.
Beaucoup.
I'm taking about the big money, dollars...
Motherfucker, do you understand English?
Don't poke sticks!
OK, huh?!
[reloading]
Guns are different.
I am Col. Long Dong... district chief and commandant of the National Police Field Force.
- I suspect you know why you're here.
- Look, man.
I only went into that dump to have myself a drink.
I took the wrong turn when I was looking for...
Corporal, you're conspiring to traffic heroin, don't deny it.
I wonder of you were aware of the Vietcong bringing heroin... down the Ho Chi Minh Trail and that the profits support guerilla forces!
- I had no idea...
- Doesn't it bother you... to harm your own troops?
Does it bother you... to put money in the pockets of your enemies?
No?
Good.
Doesn't bother me either.
Men of conscience have no place in our business.
I understand you'll be stationed in I Corps.
My brother-in-law, Col. Trang, is District Chief there.
If we are to do business, he will visit you.
What's the big "if"?
You understand that everything you ship back to your country...
- is searched thoroughly?
- There's one thing that isn't.
What is that?
The body bags.
Oh...
Oh, Alvin...
Look at the tits on number 40.
Give her a 10.
All right, a 10?
- Nine and three quarters.
- Nine and three quarters.
While you're at it, write something down and we'll get you the hell out of here.
I don't want to get out of here, Dave.
[sighs]
Al, it's true.
Half of your fucking problem is no fucking!
Come on!
Hey, listen now, once you find out that your pecker is good... for more than goosing with, you won't be so quick to want to get it shot off.
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.
♫ Happy birthday to you... ♫
♫ Happy birthday to you... ♫
♫ Happy birthday, General Dearborn,
Happy birthday, fuck you. ♫
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
I got some money for everybody.
Hang on, baby.
There you go.
Sound off!
[laughing]
Al, look at this!
Hey! It's Mickey Mouse Mantle over here.
Doesn't look like he can handle his stuff, huh?
- What he needs is a little more of this.
- You get that bottle out of his face!
Oh, my god, this boy is OD-ing on some heavy shit.
If we don't get him up right now, he'll be cold in half an hour.
All right, everybody up.
Hold on to this, Alvin.
Hold on. Here we go.
Everybody up!
What's this guy bringing, potatoes in a bag?
Stop fucking up. If you're not gonna help, get out of the way!
This guy's dying, goddamn it.
[explosion] it's over. You get down.
Sandbag!
The enemy blew up the General's trailer!
We'll go through over the wire!
- There's VC all over the place!
- Pike!
Wake up!
What?!
The enemy blew up the General's trailer.
All the world is exploding.
Jesus Christ!
♫ Happy Birthday,
General Dearborn... ♫
Jesus h. christ!
Hey, Al!
Pike is sleeping like a log.
Bisbee, get down, you stupid motherfucker.
Get over here and sit down.
Sit down!
Pike!
Oh, god...
Damn it! The VC are fucking having an attack on us, and you're out there...
- playing your music.
- They're not VC.
I put a Claymore under the General's trailer.
You put one more round into the god damn mortar...
I'm gonna blow up whatever brains you got left!
- There's 10,000...
- Asshole!
You and your freaks are the only ones shooting anything around here.
Come here. Come here.
Come here!
Oh, man... I can't keep you alive by myself.
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?
I cannot keep you alive by myself!
You're gotta wanna live.
Come on, man.
I can't feel my legs.
What do you mean you can't feel your legs? You're dying, man.
You're fucking dead meat, man.
You're fucking dying!
You understand me?
Look at your eyes.
Your eyes are like two fucking pin holes in the snow.
Come on, Pike. Come on.
Come on, Pike. Come on.
Come out of it.
Come on, Pike.
You gotta help me, man.
You gotta want to live.
You son of a bitch, you ain't gonna die on me!
You gotta wanna live, goddamn it!
January 12, 1968.
We're on our way to the Division
Headquarters at Da Nang.
The Captain can't prove that Dave blew up the General's trailer.
I just hope he hasn't noticed that one of our Claymore mines is missing.
Billy seems to be fine now.
But Tyrone is still really pissed off at him. I can't see why.
I mean, it wasn't Billy's fault he got all messed up.
I sort of wonder what's really bugging
Tyrone. I know whet's bugging Vinnie.
He picked up a dose of clap from those hookers.
And now he thinks I must have it even worse than he does... because I had three of those girls come up to my room.
The only thing I did was talk to them.
And I got some great stories for my journal.
Of course, how could I tell Vinnie that?
Look! Al!
Al, that's triage.
That's a hospital, Al.
- So what?
- So what?
So we gotta go see a doctor, Al, before our peckers run off and crawl way.
Look, I'm dripping like a Good Humor in July, you know what I mean?
What are you talking about?
I feel fine.
You feel fine? Hey, if I got the clap from one of them... you got it at least three times as bad, right?
Now, listen, Archie went that way.
We go this way.
Keep your mouth shut. Come on.
Pike, look at that. That's The Dragons.
They're the soccer champs of I Corps.
Flashy devils, ain't they?
How'd you like to beat the shit out of them?
You think what that would do for morale.
All right, people set it down in here.
Take five.
Okay, Jarines listen up here.
It is your job to make sure... that when a coffin contains a body bag... marked "remains non-viewable"... that no one... especially the next of kin... will open that body bag under any circumstances.
Okay, load them up.
But make sure that the coffins are loaded with the head down... otherwise embalming fluid will collect in the feet... and the body will begin to decompose.
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
January 14, 1968.
We've been assigned to the combat base at Con Thien... up near the DMZ.
We 're what they call a Replacement Company.
All the guys are trying not to think about... what happened to the company we 're replacing.
I'm not worried about that.
I just hope we get there in one piece.
This is supposed to be a pacified area... but after what happened in the last convoy, the guys are all pretty jumpy.
They see Vietcong behind every rice pile.
And Vinnie almost shot a water buffalo.
Captain Collins has been so busy looking out for another ambush... he's gotten us lost three times already.
Bisbee, get on the horn and find out what the hell he's stopping for!
- Yeah, I think you're right there.
- There! Over there!
[automatic fire]
Wait a minute!
Goddamit!
Who gave the order to shoot?
Get a hold of Archer. Get Archer.
- What's everybody shooting at?
- What the hell are you pointing at?
I was pointing at the road to Con Diem!
Oh, shit.
Gentleman, welcome to Con Diem.
Your company commander tells me... you've already had some seasoning under fire.
Here, at the first battalion will take a lot of pride in a high body count.
Now the company you're replacing had the highest kill ratio... in the whole damn division.
And I'd be mighty proud of any unit that fought and died half as courageously... as they did.
Now to back you up... we got fire support on hill 609,
614, and right here.
And we can hit any damn spot in the valley.
[explosion]
Charlie can, too!
Captain, get your people on the Northeast perimeter.
I wanna see all officers, staff, NCOS in the command bunker now. Move it!
Let's go! Let's move!
Go! Go! Go!
[cannonade]
Move! Let's go!
Move! Move!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!
Squad leader! First squad to the tree at the first bunker!
Second squad to the first part of the second bunker!
[multiple gunshots]
- Fire power!
- Lieutenant!
God damn it! The Colonel wants your ass in the CT now!
On the double!
- Get somebody to watch that position.
- Yes, sir.
Hold your fire! Stop shooting!
Those are our own troops!
Shit, the VC's got them pinned down!
Get the lieutenant. Tell him they got pinned down by enemy sniper!
Oh my god! They're being shelled by our own artillery!
Tell them, man, they're being shot at by our own artillery!
- Our own artillery is...
- What the hell he's saying?
Says it's out of his hands.
The Colonel's in charged of this.
What do you mean, it's out of his hands?
The colonel can't fucking see what's happening man!
What the he'll are they doing in that god damn hole!
God damn it!
You can't stop this!
Lieutenant...
Get the hell out of here! Not a goddamn thing you can do in here right now!
Lieutenant, but you don't know they're blowing away our own men.
The Colonel knows what he's doing, goddamit!
They're walking the artillery back to the tree line so that they can...
- zap the snipers and free our patrol.
- But he's walking it right over our men!
And you know that, man, you could see that if you weren't hiding... down in this god damn hole!
Man, you gave us all the jive about playing Charlie's games... by Charlie's rules, and you're fucking down here... staying in this place from the god damn bench...
...like Charlie's standing still waiting for the ball to be snapped.
- Back it up, man!
- Go ahead, kill me, man!
Harry!
Keep your goddamned mouth shut,
Washington, just for a goddamn minute?
Captain... Captain...
Call off the artillery.
Give me a few men...
I'll go up and get those gooks out of that tree line.
Lieutenant, the colonel has decided he'd rather commit firepower than risk manpower.
Just shut up!
And you get your black ass beck on that line before I court martial you both.
Jesus Christ!
These assholes are not gonna help us.
Now go ahead now. Go ahead!
[explosion]
Hey, Red, I need this man.
I owe you a favor.
Later.
[explosion]
I need this shit, man.
I will give it back to you later.
[explosion]
Come on, Pike!
Here, Fazio.
Bisbee! Get you're ass over here and follow me, on the double!
Keep low!
OK. Everybody stay down and stay quiet.
Don't you fire until I give you the signal.
Pike? Don't fuck this one up.
Now!
[cheering]
Yeah! I did it!
And I hope I got your mama!
Hey...
I wonder if any of our guys are still alive.
OK, Washington, I just got my ass chewed up by the old man.
We're going out on patrol tomorrow.
Your ass is going to be on the point... right in front, And I'm going to guarantee you some action.
Because thanks to you, I had to promise the Colonel a bigger body count...
- than the company we replaced.
- Yeah? I got you a head start already.
And that is the only thing keeping your big mouth out of the brig.
Do you mind if I get this men some help before he bleeds to death... Sir?
Corpsman,
Can we get some help please?
Watch his face.
- You people okay?
- Yeah.
You got that patrol on time.
Next time don't waste time going to captain first, right?
Next time I'll make sure
I'll get the captain out of my way first.
Well, you did good.
Pike! Are you fucking with pills again?!
Hey... hey... hold up!!!
Lieutenant, it's okay.
Fucking told your ass I don't want no junkie on my back. Didn't I?
Yeah, well the captain gave me these.
Goddamit, 'cause my fucking foot hurts.
And he also said I don't have to be in your shitty squad anymore.
- it's okay.
- I know it's okay.
I'm cool.
Stay away from me!
You stay the fuck away from me, man.
If I ever catch you near me again...
I'm going to put my foot upside your ass... sideways.
Line of departure, lock em' and load em'.
Now keep those canteens full.
I don't want half empty sloshing around.
VC will hear, there'll be an ambush.
Yeah, you can see this line a mile away.
Get to the point Washington, right at the point.
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
What am I, Charles Atlas?
- Stop it, Fazio.
- Get up front, move.
Lieutenant, keep them off the roads, they're fully mined.
Captain, I'm gonna take it a little easier today. Half my people still have the shits.
All right.
- Pike.
- Yes, Sir?
Get the hell with that...
- How's that kicking foot?
- Better. Thanks for set-up.
All right, you step right next to me.
Well, today is the start of a new body count month.
I don't have to remind you... that the company, that leads... the highest body count... will get three days of R&R at China Beach.
- Hey, Vin, you know I'm just thinking?
- Yeah.
How tough it is to hump this stuff in this muddy swamp here.
No, this isn't a swamp,
These are rice fields.
This is an engineering marvel, thousands of years old.
They terrace the land, so that the water flows evenly... from one paddy, to the next, to the next, to the next.
Like this whole valley was one giant fountain.
Hell, I hate rice.
I don't even eat Rice Krispies.
You've got a heavy load right there, take it easy.
I wish I didn't have this M-16 to tow around.
The gun doesn't weigh anything, Bisbee.
The radio weighs about 40 pounds.
- You won't kill anybody with a radio.
- Say what?
Can't kill anybody with a radio, sir.
Damn it, Pike, put that letter away.
It's ankle breaking territory.
Yes, sir. See, I read the damn thing
20 times anyway.
Don't worry, she'll wait for you.
It ain't that.
She says some damn freshman broke one of my high school track records.
I ain't afraid of getting killed today so much as what's going to happen after, I mean.
Ain't nothing except a couple of damn trophies at school... and then next year, somebody hit more homeruns than you did and then they... change the damn names on the trophy.
There ain't nothing left at all.
Don't you worry, we'll get you into a soccer game with the Dragons... and get a whole shitload of new records. Yep.
[clicking]
Did anybody hear a click?
No, no. That's just me.
I'm just taking some pictures.
Oh. You idiot. Will you put that camera away and watch out for trip wire?
Sorry.
Al, I'm dying of thirst over here,
I'm parched. I can't believe... we can't take a drink because of this no sloshing canteens ruling.
No sloshing... we sound like a bunch of plumbers out here.
[clicking]
Foster...
- Did you just take a picture?
- No.
Everybody stop!
Be still.
Everybody just be cool.
What're you doing?
I'm taking a bath really.
Oh, come on, I'm serious!
What're you doing?!
- I'm on a mine.
- What?
What do I do?
The fuck you mean, what?
Get the hell out of the way!
All right, it's a mine!
Everybody retrace your steps!
Retrace you steps!
Back! Back!
Damn it, don't go near that man.
Leave him alone, he is a dead man!
Back it up! Back it up!
Damn it! That's an order!
Do not move, Washington.
It's a pressure release device.
It will not detonate unless you take your weight off it.
Like I'm going somewhere.
- Do not move! Do not breathe!
- Move, Lieutenant. That is an order!
Get those ammo cases.
Get those ammo boxes.
Right now!
Goddamit, Pike!
I will not lose another life!
Now, come on back here!
Pressure release device. Gotta replace Washington's weight... with the weight of ammo boxes.
Find the plate, seek out the plate.
Find it first.
Very carefully.
Do not move Washington.
Do not move at all.
Very carefully Pike, That's it!
Very carefully.
Will you get the fuck away from me,
Pike? I'll kick you in your ass.
Shut up, you big lummox.
If you do any kicking... you'd better do it with your god damn right foot.
Let him work, Washington!
You find it?
You find it, Pike?
All right. Take that first box, and you put it on the edge of the panel.
Very carefully, very softly.
As he does so, Washington... you move your foot, slowly removing the amount of weight he's replacing.
All right, here comes the first one.
Easy.
Ease off.
- Man, will you just get out of my life!
- Just shut up, you make me nervous.
You both better shut up if you wanna live!
Put that second box down there,
Pike.
I may not get a chance to tell you this... but you're the biggest goddamn bastard
I have known in my life.
Yeah? But your mama like it, you motherfucker!
All right, now, very slowly, on the count of three... remove your foot and run like hell.
Do you understand me, Washington?
OK, let's go.
One, two, three...
Let's go!
[explosion]
We are going on the road. This whole area and all these paddies are mined!
Dipshit!
Well, I ain't gonna kiss your skinny lips, quaker.
Yeah, we're even.
So fuck off.
Can you imagine being on one of those mines?
- Go nuts in five seconds.
- What are sweating about, Al?
Fazio would have you off there like that.
- Hey, you'd risk your life for me?
- Of course, I would.
- Would you do the same for me?
- Yeah.
Well, we're buddies.
Washington?
Slow down, Washington, we're not running any race around here.
Lieutenant, did you see the Captain's face?
- See his face when?
- When I was standing on that mine.
What are you talking about,
Washington?
Was the son of a bitch smiling?
Son of a bitch is running.
You want these back, stay out of trouble and start taking care of yourself.
- Sir, it's the Colonel again.
- You're worth shit to me!
It's Collins here, sir.
Lieutenant!
All right, I want two scouting details.
Check out the left hand side... and the right hand side of the river next to the bridge.
Lieutenant, what the hell is going on now?
I'm sending some people to checkout the river, find us a place to cross.
We haven't got any time.
That minefield caused a delay in our operations timetable... now the Colonel is on my ass to hump into ambush position by sunset...
- so we can get some body counts.
- I understand that, sir.
There's a risk factor involving crossing the goddamn bridge.
Don't you see it's a toss up anyway we play it. Intelligence tells us... the road is mined, to stick with the paddies.
The paddies are mined, we're back on the road. And you want me...
- to send men back into the bush again.
- Yes, I do, sir. It's my opinion...
Well, you forget your opinion, because I'm in charge here... and it is my opinion that the risk factor is minimal.
I'll stake my bars on it.
I'll cross that goddamn bridge myself.
Freeze!
You stay where you are.
At least let me get the people to clear the bridge for you!
Goddamn that son of a...
Give me two 60s on either flank right now and four riflemen with them.
Foster, Washington...
C'mon, move out!
Harry, get up here.
Go!
Let's go, Lieutenant!
Bring them over.
Bring them over.
Two at a time. Keep your interval, do not bunch up on that bridge.
Jesus, don't take all night.
Get them moving!
- Let's go.
- Two at a time.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Goddamit, it's taking all night.
Move them over.
All of them at a time.
Let's go!
- Everybody, move it. Move it out.
- Hey, we gotta send them two at a time!
You heard him!
- That son of a goddamn bitch.
- [Machine gun fire.]
[screams]
- The M79!
- Yes, Sir! It's right here.
Give it to me right now!
[multiple shots]
- Over there!
- Yes, yes.
[yells]
Pike!
Move your ass out of there.
Go on!
Move your ass out of there!
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Get that.
- Niner.
[explosion]
Let's see what we got, Washington.
Let's move!
Hold fire! Hold fire!
Hold fire!
Lieutenant!
I want you to give me a body count on the double! Let's go, go, go!
All right. My IDO has been hit.
Get battalion on the line.
Pike, how are you doing?
Are you all right?
Hurry it up, Lieutenant!
Goddamit. I could kick the shit out of him.
All right, here you are.
All right, Colonel, we've engaged the enemy on the bridge and we're... expecting a big body count.
If you just hold it a minute, Sir.
What's going on? Come on!
- I need that body count, goddamit!
- It's a tunnel!
Colonel, we'll delay on that body count, we've got a tunnel.
We're gonna have to track it down and I'll be right back to you... as soon as we find the source.
I got a good idea where they're going.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Shit!
- Where do you think they're going?
- I've got a goddamn... good idea where.
Right over there... we got us a VC village and we're gonna light it up like the fourth of July.
You get me artillery,
I'll feed you some coordinates.
Sir, there are probably a couple hundred people in there...
Jesus Christ! That is an enemy village.
Will you get me artillery?!
Where the hell am I?
- Sorry, sir, I can't do that.
- 4-7-2. What can't you do?
- I'm not gonna do it with a rifle... and I'm not gonna do it with the radio, sir.
- What wouldn't you do?
- Murder another human being, sir.
Bisbee, you get me that artillery... or your ass is in the brig in Da Nang and that is a direct order.
Sir, I must respectfully refuse to obey that order.
Goddamit, you're in big trouble!
War Eagle, this is Charlie One, over.
War Eagle, this is Charlie One, over.
War Eagle, I got a firing mission for you.
Request 105 assistance.
Coordinates are 3-3-5, 4-7-2.
The target is an enemy village.
I want this man placed under field arrest.
What happened now?
He refused to obey my direct order to call artillery on an enemy position.
I had to do it myself, the son of a bitch.
What enemy position, Captain?
Goddamit, that village, that is a VC village!
- What in the fuck are you talking about?
- That is where the tunnels come out.
It's right where the tunnels come out.
Bisbee, get on the horn, call artillery and tell them to disregard that order.
Now, just wait a fucking minute.
You're in trouble!
Goddamit, you're going out of your mind, man!
- You're going out of your mind!
- I don't need to take that shit from you!
- We don't need to take that village!
- We got to take that reaper out??
I want a body count, goddamit!
[continuous explosions]
Holy shit...
Washington, would you mind getting your ass on the point?
Lieutenant, I want you to keep a running body count.
All right, keep alert, I want you to all be watching for a tunnel opening.
Keep watching all over!
[ducks quacking]
That tunnel's around here somewhere.
The man who finds it... gets an in-country R&R, three days at China Beach.
Goddamit, will you put that down?
Everything could be boobied.
Put it down!
Come on, back in the line.
Lieutenant, you get a count yet?
Yes, sir, two chickens and a duck.
All right, Gunny, let's break the men into details.
We'll search and clear all the hooches, the rice piles, everything.
Let's see what we can uncover.
- You got anything, Lieutenant?
- The village is deserted, sir.
The hell it is. You just don't know where to look yet.
- What do you got up there?
- It's snakes, sir.
Shit.
- Captain?
- Yeah.
We got some bodies here, sir.
He's got his goddamn bodies.
Here's your body count, Captain.
But I guess it doesn't really count.
All these people are alive.
Hey, Skipper, look what I found out here.
All right, you little gook.
I wanna know where that tunnel is and wanna know where your friends are...
'cause you did not blow the shit out of us by yourself.
- He can't understand a goddamn thing.
- He can talk English... as good as you or me.
Let me work on him.
Harry, get on the radio and get someone from S2.
I wanna interrogate a prisoner on the double. Get out there, go on.
Jesus Christ.
All right, did he have a weapon?
It's just this club.
Captain.
Forget it. If this man had been digging a tunnel before coming here...
...his hands wouldn't be as clean as they are, but dirtier than mine.
Shit, we took so long to get here and he could have a shower.
Captain, this ain't a weapon, it looks like a baseball bat.
They know from baseball like
I know from polo.
Who do you think won the Little League World series?
Damn chinks from Taiwan.
Hey buddy, do you play baseball?
- Grenade!!
- Grenade!
Hey, let me see this.
Hey, you play baseball!
Come on, buddy.
Come on, little buddy, let's go.
Here's the bat.
All right, buddy.
All right. Let's go.
Come on! You're pitching like your granny, Fazio.
Hit that ball!
Colonel Trang.
He's out!
He's out!
He's out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!
It's over!
All right, men, this is Colonel Trang from the National Police Field Force.
And this is Major Royal, Special
Forces adviser. They are here...
- to take care of the interrogation.
- What interrogation?
Hell, he ain't no VC!
He's just a kid who plays baseball better than most.
Don't worry!
Don't worry!
Shut it up!
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to him.
If he is no VC, no worry.
-I'm telling you he's not the enemy.
.-That's right, I'm with him.
Relax!
Look, these are
Colonel Trang's people.
He understands how to deal with them.
We just take the kid, check his story out.
That's strictly routine.
That good enough for you, Pike?
You got the Major's word as an officer.
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
All right, we're gonna move it out.
Gunny, get them going.
Washington, you're on the point.
Let's get moving! Out! Let's go!
Goddamn body count. We'll have to be out here again tomorrow.
Let's fill those ranks in.
[distant painful yell]
Hey, wait a minute.
What was that?
Let's move.
I heard something, dammit.
Hootie, shut that radio off.
Pike...
Would you get your ass back into the column. Come on.
[distant screaming]
- I'm going back.
- You just wait a minute!
Now, wait a minute.
Listen to me.
I want you to take these back and we'll forget about this morning.
Come on, take them, because I've got big plans for you.
Now, don't you blow it.
Come on!
- I ain't playing soccer for you.
- Yeah?
Well, you do that and you're gonna let down the whole goddamn team!
You think what that could do for morale if we beat the dragons. Don't blow it!
Take these.
I wouldn't play for you if my life depended on it.
Well, it does.
You need me, Pike.
A junkie needs all the help he can get.
Now, you do exactly what I tell you... or else you're a dead man. Now stuff some of these down your throat. Go on!
You're the one who's dead, goddamit!
[distant gunshot]
You wouldn't have done that if that was a white boy back there.
Yeah, but to you he's just nothing but a gook. He's just a yellow nigger.
- He is the enemy.
- No, you're the enemy!
Well, he finally did it, didn't he, Al?
That son of a bitch finally got a body count.
And you're an asshole.
If you're gonna be dumb enough to pull a gun on a man... you better be smart enough to pull the trigger.
[acoustic guitar music starts]
♫ Uncle Sam I'm in Vietnam ♫
♫ It's a jungle It's a prison ♫
♫ But here I am ♫
♫ Dreaming of the outside... ♫
It is the patriotic duty of every man in this battalion... to participate in a saving's bonds program.
It cost only six dollars...
♫ Far away from this one ship bay ♫
♫ In the southeast tip of Asia ♫
♫ Where I lay ♫
♫ Dreaming of the outside ♫

Both of you are goddamn lucky your asses aren't gonna be sent to the brig.
Gonna be joining the combined action platoon, Tam Bak Hamlet.
You're gonna be guarding the rice.
Get your stuff, get on the jeep, you move it out right now.
Thank you, Captain.
They're taking them away.
You got anymore of this pound cake in your C rations there? I'm almost out.
Didn't you hear me? They're taking
Pike and Bisbee away in a jeep.
Yeah, I heard you, Alvin.
Now, did you hear me?
I want more pound cake in your C rations there.
Hey, you think they'll drive them all the way to Da Nang in a jeep?
I don't know.
I'll tell you one thing I do know though.
Old Fazio over here is gonna... get himself a jug and drink his money down before gun gets his mitts into it.
That's what I'm talking about.
You coming?
No.
I wanna write down everything that happened today.
But who the fuck would believe it?
Well...
I told the Colonel not to send them to the brig.
Wouldn't mind if we got a discipline problem around here.
The old Captain jumps in and sends them to guard the rice... in Tam Bak Hamlet.
Well...
At least that's better than going to the brig.
Do you happen to notice those guys in the bags over there they were placing?
Charlie mines the paddy every night.
And every morning someone else gets blown to shit.
They're lucky if they last a week.
Hey, buddy.
Moon juice. Check it out.
- They've got a still over there.
- I see you found your jug.
That ain't all I found.
You know those guys in Delta company got down in their hooch?
- A hooker.
- You're kidding!
I swear to god. She's 15 and she's a knockout and I may be in love.
Hey, Superman, let's you and me get laid, huh?
Why don't you go?
I'm sort of busy.
You can't let a chance like this pass you by. You owe it to Pike and Bisbee.
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean, "What do I mean?"
Remember what I told you.
It ain't like you got forever.
- You grab it as it goes by, Al.
- Nah, nah, nah.
I don't feel like grabbing anything today.
- What is that shit you got on?
- Oh, thinking about recipes for C rations.
You know, like cooking.
Stuff like that.
- Cooking?
- Yeah.
Hey...
- You got checked up by the doc yet?
- No, I told you I feel fine.
Hey, I'm pissing razor blades over here and I just biffed one of them.
You fucked three of them, you feel fine?
Boy... you must be the wonder of the medical world, Al.
Either that or maybe you didn't even touch them, huh?
- Swapping recipes with them in there?
- No!
- Hey, Vinnie, I never said anything...
- I don't think you fucked any of them.
I don't think girls turn you on.
Hey!
I think you might be a little hotel-motel, right?
What are you talking about?
I thought you were my friend.
I don't care what you thought.
I ain't that kind of friend, you know?
Just stay the fuck away from me,
Foster. And I mean it.
Yes, sir, Captain.
I think I see the enemy out there.
Yes, sir. OP4.
Be right down?
Thank you, sir.
[starts shooting]
VC! Down right there!
Here comes the enemy.
Come on.
Come on, Captain, you motherfucker.
Clear the boxes. Come on.
A little bit more. Yeah!
You think that's gonna get
Pike and Bisbee back?
I'm gonna get that motherfucker. I'm gonna kill that sadistic son of a bitch.
You probably would.
But I'm not gonna watch it.
Because it's bullshit.
Bullshit! Like everything else that's going on around this goddamn place.
[Radio Speaker]: Radio Hanoi.
And just a reminder that the weather is sweet at this time of year.
It's really cool, boy.
Your two minions say you wanna see me.
Well, you see me.
I'm sorry I did not see you at the village.
When your company was there today.
But you see...
I was indisposed [chuckles].
I'm Colonel Trang, district chief.
My brother-in-law has told me of your proposition.
Fascinating... this little tag mark...
"remains non-viewable".
It will help us to keep prying eyes from intervening with our business.
So as soon as your contact deposits the capital, we can begin.
Unless, of course, we run out of non-viewable remains.
[chuckles]
You jive ass motherfucker.
What kind of games you trying to run on me?
I don't understand.
- Is your name not Washington?
- Yeah, man, my name is Washington.
Half the niggers in the Marine Corps name is Washington.
You got the wrong man.
[foreign language]
The son of a bitch is stuck in the goddamn sand!
Everybody out right now, people.
On the beach. Spread out.
January 23, 1968.
For once we know where we're going.
Intelligence located a Vietcong tactical operation center... and we're supposed to knock it out.
The Captain thinks we 're gonna ring up a big body count.
But he's not going with us. I guess after what happened the other day... he wants to be sure that when we start counting bodies, his isn't one of them.
Vinnie isn't still talking to me, but I can understand that.
I think he was really upset about Pike and Bisbee going down to that village.
And he was drunk and all. So I guess he had to take it out on somebody.
- He wants to go on foot, Harry?
- Yeah.
That's a goddamn minesweeper without a three quarter-inch armour... through a goddamned coconut grove!
- I don't like the way it smells, it stink's!
- You keep these people here and down.
I'm gonna take Washington in there and sniff around there. You got that?
- You be careful.
- All right.
Washington, let's move out!
Get your asses down there.
Down! Down!
All right, Washington.
You keep your eyes on the tree tops,
I'm gonna watch the ground.
This is nice, sir.
I'm gonna take a picture.
Down! Get your ass down!
Hey, Vinnie, isn't that beautiful?
[automatic fire]
[yells]
Oh! God Oh!
Al! Al! Shit, Al!
Corpsman! Corpsman!
Get your fucking cover here, right now!
- Get him a medic.
- How is he?
[automatic fire]
Goddamn it!
- Don't you fucking die on me, Al.
- Get us a Cobra in here.
- Fuck. There's one over there.
- Take it easy.
Fuck that, you're wasting it.
Get out! Go!
Colonel, you let my buddy die,
I'll out your fucking heart out!
Goddamn bomb, I cant believe...
Harry, shut up. Dammit!
That's it, Washington.
All right, squad leaders.
Detail your people to envelope and contain that position... according to bravo plan, you got that?
Washington, let's reconnoiter.
- Are you okay?
- I'm gonna be fine.
Goddamit, I need a...
I need a corpsman up here.
Goddamit I... I need a corpsman...
[Sobs]
All right.
Third squad's in position, fourth squad's got the back door.
People?
We'll flush them out now.
I want you to keep your goddamn eyes wide open...
'cause Charlie may have a network of tunnels up here... and he could come out anywhere.
I want you to be ready for anything.
All right, Washington, light that son of a bitch up.
[detonation]
All right, people, talk to me now.
Talk to me!
God...!
That looks like nobody's home.
May not be anybody home,
Washington.
Some schmuck's gonna have to walk over there and prove it.
Let's go.
[automatic fire]
[low radio music]
[Female Speaker]: You're listening to the cool sound of radio Hanoi.
Radio Hanoi?
God fuck it!!
All the people we lost today, for what, for a goddamn relay booster... for motherfucking Radio Hanoi?
Intelligence swore it was a goddamn enemy communications center!
Hire ups and goofballs tell them any goddamn thing they want to hear... and they listen to him because they're fuck heads. Goddamn fuck-heads!
Washington, do you know why we're on this goddamn mission?
You have a battalion sitting on top of that hill watching down at us...
...because we're gonna draw fire,
Washington. We're bait.
We're goddamn motherfucking live bait!
It's all we are.
We draw them out of the bush and those bastards on that hill...
...are gonna let loose with that big fancy ass million dollar hardware.
They can get a nice, big, juicy body count.
Washington... if that's what those motherfuckers want... that is precisely what those motherfuckers are going to get!
Come on, Washington.
Come on out here, Washington.
Give me the coordinates of that hill over there.
Ain't nothing on that hill.
You have been out in the bush too long, 'cause I can clearly see... a whole tactical operation centre up there.
An enemy communication centre too and it's all being defended... by an entire battalion of MVA regulars...
- You can see that now, can't you?
- That's right!
- thought you would.
- I see it.
You ever think what it would be like to spend a million goddamn dollars?
You know something?
I think about it all the time.
You'll find out what it's like right now
Washington, today.
Washington, what in the fuck does it smells so bad around here?
[laughs]
Sir, you and me.
We ain't taken a bath since Da Nang!
[continuous cannon fire]
[multiple detonations]
That's it!
I want more of that goddamn stuff.
More of it. Beautiful!
Oh, I love that, goddamn!
It's a shame the Captain isn't here to see all those fireworks.
And it's also a shame that he wasn't here to catch one of those bullets...
- fragged up his ass in this fireworks...
- You know something, Washington?
It's about time we stopped talking about blowing out someone's nuts off... and start listening to what he's saying.
- Listen to the Captain?
- The Captain.
And that bullshit he's been talking about playing soccer to understand... what the enemy thinks?
And all that bullshit about beating that gook team, the Dragons...
- so we'd be the soccer champs?
- Right.
Be good for morale. Do you have any idea how good for morale that'd be?
No.
Washington, if we're the soccer champs... we don't find our ass in combat no more.
Right.
If we're the soccer champs, we don't tour around the country fighting.
We tour around the country playing and behind the lines.
Now you can call that son of a bitch yellow bellied coward if you want.
But you don't call in MEDEVAC for bruised shin or damaged knee.
And maybe that's the one thing what we're out here for.
Maybe it's the only goddamn thing we can accomplish out here.
Just get these little peckerwoods out of here in one piece.
Yeah, but you see you're talking about a soccer team now.
And we ain't got Pike.
And you got to face the fact.
Pike is the soccer team.
[incoming helicopter]
WOW!!!
Pike ain't gonna play for the Captain.
You don't understand what I'm talking about.
- You don't. We need Pike.
- We need Pike...
- and he's not gonna play for the Captain.
- Right.
But you're gonna talk to him into playing for us.
- You.
- I'm gonna talk him into...
You, Tyrone Washington, is gonna talk him into playing for us. That's your job.
[explosion]
- My job?
- Yeah, that's your job, Washington.
Now let's just watch the show and stop talking now, man.
[explosion]
[cheedng]
[explosion]
♫ This is what we call a soap.
It's not for eating, no, no, no. ♫
♫ This is what we call the soap on a cold and frosty morning. ♫
- What're you doing?
- I don't know. What are you doing?
- Jesus! Good to see you!
- You're making soap commercials, man.
- Welcome to my community.
- This is great.
- Beautiful. These people are so great.
- This isn't happening. I love it.
Lucy San. Lucy San.
Come here...
I'd like you to meet these people.
- Lucy San... this is Ty.
- Who?
- Lucy?
- Lucy San. This is Ty.
- And her brother Koi.
- Koi. What's happening, man?
This is a very good friend of mine.
Don't need to be shy, he's a great guy.
Where's a...
Where's Dipshit? Where's Pike?
He's out there in the fields.
The dumb farmer looks right at home.
How'd you like to take a trip to the big city, old country ass boy?
Damn, what the cat dragged in..
The Captain's got a big soccer game set up for us. For the championship.
Us against those bad ass Dragons.
And all we have to do is kick the shit out of them... and we'll be out of this shooting gallery for the rest of our lives.
Well fuck him, man.
- I ain't playing for that son of a bitch.
- It's not for the Captain, Dipshit.
It's for us. It's for the guys.
It's for the Company.
The Lieutenant has fixed a way so the whole fucking company...
[explosions]
Not just the soccer team, the whole company can get out of combat.
If we win.
But how in the hell can we win if you don't play in the game?
It don't matter.
We're all dead anyway.
That's bullshit.
We're gonna be sliding in and out man. From one game to another.
Okinawa, Taiwan, Japan.
We got a chance to get out of this goddamn Vietnam!
But what the hell do you know, huh?
You're smoking that shit.
You're so high on that shit you don't understand nothing!
That's right.
And when I get hit man,
I ain't feeling nothing.
Yeah?
Let's see if you feel this.
[reloads]
[starts shooting]
You're pathetic.
Here's your mail.
You and Bisbee.
Get this stiff out of my jeep.
- Move it. On the double.
- [Pike starts yelling.]
I'm gonna be a father!
Hey, man, I'm gonna be a father!
Betsy, she's having my kid!
She's gonna have my kid!
- I thought you sent her to Tijuana?
- I did!
I mean, I did, but I didn't.
I mean, she didn't go!
- Congratulations!
- Don't you know?
No matter what happens, there's gonna be something left of me in this world.
A little Billy Ray Junior!
- God bless you man.
- Don't stand there drooling... like Pavlov's pups, come on, let's get moving!
What?
Hell, we got a soccer game with the Dragons, man.
If we win we're out of combat.
Can I take Missy and Koi?
- Get them.
- All right!
This is the luckiest day of our lives, man.
Damn, that's something, ain't it?
Pike, if you can be a father...
...I guess there's hope for the world.
Let's move it!
Here you go, buddy.
Kick some ass!
Bring them little yellow piss-ants on! Go!
[marching music]
Forward march!
Vinnie...
We need you out there today, man.
You gotta understand that what happened to Foster is not your fault.
Hell, it ain't.
- We're gotta win this goddamn game...
- Look, I'll play okay.
I'll play. Just get off me.
[cheering]
You think we got a hope in hell?
I don't know shit about this game,
Captain.
Goddamn, I ain't done with you, man!
Hardcore championship soccer, the Muthuhs and the Dragons.
And so far, the Muthuhs are off to a slow start. Gunny?
I knew there was gonna be a slow start, but they're strong on the finish.
Shit!
Pass the motherfucker here!
Fuck you!
OK, Fazio, that's good!
Hey, Vinnie! Vinnie Fazio!
Which one is the Dago Fazio?!
- Alvin!
- Smile!
Alvin, you're beautiful.
Look at you.
I can't believe it, look at his face.
The ball is still in play.
[cheering]
We've got a game! We're playing a game! Get the fuck out of here!
Hey, Alvin!
Al, this one's for you...
- my man!
- What?!
- Come on, do it!
- Goddamn, will you play the game?!
When I was in the hospital, I heard about this game. I couldn't believe it!
How did the Captain get a game with the Dragons?
- Remember that day you got hit?
- Yeah.
Well, we stormed up that hill that day.
We wiped out an entire battalion of MVA regulars.
We got the highest body count in Division for the whole month.
The general was so pleased with us.
Well, he just pulled a few strings... we got the match.
You wiped out a whole battalion?
You believe that Foster?
Yeah, yes, sir.
Then they probably ought to make you a general too.
Hell, yeah, that's terrific!
- Hey, Metcalfe, that's more like it.
- These are my boys, sir.
- They worked very hard for this.
- Where's the goddamn photographer?
There he is, sir, right here.
That'll look good for you, sir.
Pike, I'm in the clear!
Come on!
[cheers]
We're in the lead!
We're in the lead!
That's it!
That's it! Go, Pike!
Goddamn it.
What a terrific play by Pike out there on the field.
The score is now 3-1.
The whistle blows, it's half time.
Like I told you, the boy starts slow, the other side doesn't win.
We have got them by the balls and that is the name of the game.
Jesus, get them to the locker room and I'm gonna go see Gen. Sloan.
Goddamn!
[marching music]
Let's check your package!
There seems to be some strange body language going out there in the field.
What is that?
Well, it's probably the most intelligent question that you've ever asked me.
Lieutenant, we got the point.
Check your package!
See, when Washington sees a good looking woman point at his hot bottom... he checks his package.
That shot was like a good looking woman.
A thing of beauty, so he checked his package.
Checked his package.
Washington checks his package.
The boys check their packages.
And I'm checking my package.
Now you little white face... disloyal fuck, are you checking your package?
Or do you have a package?
I want to talk to General Sloan.
Bring me to General Sloan!
Well, Colonel, I think we'll find him right over here in the grand stand.
Dragons, 1.
Let's go, Muthuhs!
Let's hear it for the Muthuhs!
Hooray for the Muthuhs!
A little Buddha, huh?
You rub his belly, you say, for good luck?
All right.
Everybody, listen up!
Gather around, listen up!
All right, now, Gen. Sloan... is so proud the way the Muthuhs played the first half... that he's gone ahead and arranged the exhibition tour and the first stop...
- is Saigon.
- All right!
After that it's Bangkok and then Tokyo!
All right, that's what I'm talking about, Tokyo.
Now, there's only one small change in plans: We're not supposed to win.
- What are you talking about?
- What the hell does that mean?!
We throw the goddamn game?!
Now, you just wait a minute.
There's another way of looking at this.
Now, the Vietnamese go for winners.
And right now they happen to think...
-that that's the Vietcong.
That's a crock of shit.
Now, it's our responsibility to build up their confidence in their government... and their army and their athletic teams.
- So we go around losing.
- That is a wrong way to look at it!
They go around winning!
Now, what's good for the Allies is good for us.
I know this is not easy because we're Marines.
But this is a question of priorities.
Now if you're gonna disappoint the General by beating them... then we will rejoin the battalion.
And they're being called up to an area called Khe Sanh.
- Khe Sanh? Where the fuck is it?
- I heard about it.
- What about it?
- It's a meat grinder.
A meat grinder?
All right.
Now we got a job to do.
We gotta be out of here by 4:00.
That's all the time the General has.
Let's go.
Go!
Who gives a shit who kicks the little ball into the net more times?
Come on, are you playing?
Come on.
If he's playing, I'm playing.
Let's go.
Weren't you the man that said...
...that getting your guys out in one piece...
...that's all that counts?
Washington...
You gotta do what's right for you.
Me?
Man, do you really believe that I'm doing this for me?
I never lost at anything in my goddamn life.
Don't fall down!
You're making it look too obvious!
Oh, Jesus! You're making it look too easy!
Come on. Make them work for it!
Make it look that way!
I tell you what, I'm gonna give them one more, you hear me?
- Make it 4:3 and we hold it.
- That's good enough for me.
The Dragons have tied it up at 3:3.
Send my compliments to Cpt. Collins for doing a beautiful job.
All right, that's more like it.
That is more like it.
All right, listen, Pike!
It's gorgeous, fine. Everything just fine, don't worry about it.
They're gonna make one more goal.
2 would be great...
- 3 would be the best we could get.
- Like hell I am.
Wait a minute, Pike. I don't want you to make this into a personal problem.
You get that?
No personal problems.
Alvin, get me some water.
Shit, man, the Dragons is...
- his fucking team.
- Who?
That's the son of a bitch who killed the kid I was playing ball with!
Doping kids.
- Look man, don't do nothing stupid.
- Stupid?
If winning this game is good for him, how can it be good for us?
I know, I know, I know. Let's just lose this game and go home.
Dammit, man, I'm a dumb ass, right?
I'm a dumb ass.
I've done some stupid things since I've been here. I was scared shitless.
The pills and all that man, I know.
But I ain't never in my life done something I'd be this ashamed of.
Every guy in Nam is listening to us, man, on the radio.
- Gettin' out ass whupped every game?
- Hey, man...
I know how you feel. OK?
- I don't wanna lose.
- Damn, its hard man.
I know it's hard.
But what you gonna do?
You want us to die?
You want to lose people in the fucking war, or do you wanna lose the game?
Just lose the game, OK?
It's OK.
- Goddamit, it's hard, man!
- I know.
We lose the game.
I heard about teamwork, but his is ridiculous, right?
- Come on.
- OK.
- Think of your baby, OK?
- All right.
Think of your baby, you're already a winner.
- Let's lose!
- All right!
All right. Let's lose this game then.
All right, now they got the lead, let's give them some insurance.
Hey, look at that!
They're making fools of us.
You think you got us whipped?
Come on, you little yellow piss-ants!
Pike!
Jesus!
What is he doing?
Little bastard!
How many times I've gotta tell ya?!
Pike!
You see that?! You beat that!
You piss-ants!
All right, all right!
Coolidge, you get ready to play!
Pike, you've had it!
Major, get the General!
He seems to have forgotten something!
Wait, Coach Collins, is substituting for Pike.
The Muthuhs will have to go ahead, without their star player...
You beautiful, disloyal fuck.
Just couldn't resist it, could you, twinkle toes?
Well you just pulled a hamstring and you're on your way to Khe Sanh.
- Just fine!
- How do you like that?!
And the rest of you, you wanna play like
Pike again, you can join him there too!
You know a tie was not in the deal.
The Dragon need another goal... let's go and give it to them!
And, Washington...
I'm holding you personally responsible.
Hey, Captain, how much you got put in the game?
- We don't wanna blow the point spread.
- Are you taking him out?
Just 'cause he's the only guy in this team with some principles?!
- Fuck him! That's why I hate that guy.
- You idiot!
Why don't we just make the goals for them? It's easier.
You really liked it when he made that score.
You're fucking right!
I felt really good. How about you?
You're gonna bullshit everybody here... telling them you didn't dig it?
We can kick their ass like that!
Tell everybody here, you big fucking tree trunk, how you feel?
You know, I had you guys all pegged wrong.
You're not smart enough to be fools and fuck-ups!
But you're just about dumb enough to try and be fucking heroes.
Okay, we can look at it this way.
Uncle Sam is paying us a 137 bucks a month, to kick some ass. Right?
- Huh?!
- Yeah.
OK.
- Let's kick some ass!
- Yeah!
It's coming down to the wire. The team that scores next will be the champs!
Jesus, Bisbee, let it go in!
Goddamit!
Bisbee saves, the Muthuhs have the ball, with only 20 seconds to play!
Wait a minute.
Oh, Christ, almighty!
- Come on, that's it!
- Do it, Washington, baby!
Come on, do it.
Yeah!
Washington!
[foreign language]
Missy, Koi, did you see that?
I'll be right back! I'll be right back!
That's our man there!
[machine-gun fire]
Just listen to that fireworks.
Fireworks, hell! It's incoming!
Incoming!
Move, move, move!
All officer's into the air raid shelter, now! Go, go!
Protect Colonel Trang!
Form a human shield!
Grab someone!
Protect Colonel Trang!
Don't let him die!
Form a human shield!
[explosion]
Squad leaders, get your people weapons.
There's one on that roof top!
And another over there!
- Hey, you seen Missy and Koi?
- No, man.
Look, we can't find anybody in this mess!
I ain't seen nobody.
- Hey there, man!
- I can't find them!
[explosion]
[people screaming]
Get away from Col. Trang!
Get away, or I'll shoot!
Stop that girl! Stop her!
[gun shot]
[explosion]
- Where the fuck are they?
- Up there, Lieutenant!
On the building.
- Lieutenant!
- Where?
Over there!
[explosion]
[explosion]
- Captain Collins!
- Pike, get back to your squad!
Collins, goddamit, stop running!
I gave you an order, goddamn it!
Now go and do it!
You're trying to save our own ass by selling us out!
Now you're gonna go into that goddamned hole?!
I gave all of you a chance to save yourselves! What more can I do?!
You can fight.
Stay with your men!
Collins!
[explosion]
Oh, Jesus.
You son-of-a-bitches!
Oh, please, god, no!
Oh, god, Missy ....
And that bastard did it!
That fat man!
- Who did it?!
- That man!
[yells]
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, you son-of-a-bitch!
[shoots]
Doctor said, before he died he wanted somebody tell his Mama what happened.
And how he couldn't have done all this in Canada.
I don't get it, what did he mean?
No matter what he meant, the man's dead.
Come on, keep writing now.
Get everything down, don't leave nothing out.
You're gonna get it published too, you got Vinnie Fazio's personal guarantee.
What are you writing in my book right now?
- See that ambulance over there?
- Yup.
You're getting on it, you get to a hospital... and you just disappear.
I told you once and I meant it.
I ain't gonna do nothing
I'm gonna be ashamed of.
I'm gonna tell you what you got to be ashamed of.
You're gonna have a little bastard running around calling... somebody else "daddy". Now that's what you've got to be ashamed of.
- Gunny!
- Uh-uh.
- Gunny!
- Tyrone...
We got a man here with brain damage, he's got a concussion.
- And he won't go to a hospital.
- That's cute, man, that's real cute.
You leave me no other choice.
I just gotta tell them there ain't nothing wrong with me.
Nobody listens to a man with brain damage.
I can't use no man with a bruised brain.
Now get on the ambulance... disloyal fuck.
- You got it?
- Yes, sir!
You big lummox.
Now you don't deserve this.
You son-of-a-bitch.
Now you take care of it.
You take care of it, too.
Old country ass boy.
- Hey, Vinnie, what's his name?
- You're not gonna believe this... the guy's name is Hung.
What kind of a name is Hung?
We'll name him Tony, something like that. You put that down there.
"Hung is now Tony."
You listen to this one, are you ready?
Hey, I think there's a grenade down!
Get those kids out of the way!
[explosion]
Al, are you all right?
Al?
Al?
Alvin!
What did you do to yourself, Alvin?
Oh, Alvin, no, no, no!
God...
Oh, no!
Oh, god...
Oh, no!
Please.
Vinnie, you're gonna go with Washington now.
Wh're gonna round up our people, and wh're moving out.
You're still alive, you hear me?
All right...
Bring him along, Tyrone.
- Gunny!
- Yes, Sir?
Get our goddamn people together, we're moving out!
Yes, sir.
Oh, please, don't let them see me.
Please don't.
Boy, you're a man. You can cry any goddamn time, you get ready.
January 30, 1968.
I don't know why I should even bother to write in this journal anymore.
Because after what happened today, who the hell is ever gonna believe it.
We actually had a chance to get out of this goddamn war.
All we had to do is throw the game and walk away.
But for some reason we just couldn't. For some reason... winning that stupid game was more important than saving our ass.
So I guess we just keep on walking into one bloody mess after another... until somebody finally figures out that living... has got to be more important than winning.
Left right, right and left.

What's the matter?
Sit still. Where are you going?
Where are we, Dad?
- Go and have a look!
- That's impossible.
Stop crying.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
The train goes no further.
You'll have to get off.
Have your identity cards ready.
- Am I to walk with the child?
- Quiet.
How are we going to carry the luggage?
How stupid!
- Fero, help me.
- Get out of the way.
Damn you!
The Jerries will help you - it isn't far to the village.
Show her the way!
- It takes a lot of courage...
- Marian, come on.
Are you alone?
Go and report to the National
Committee at the Mayor's.
You heard me. That goes for you too.
Report to the police officer, Hejna!
Why don't you get out of the way?
- Let's see your papers!
- Get a move on, old man...
Stop fooling around and show us your papers.
Jindra, come here!
Look at that stupid face.
Must be a Jerry.
Look at his boots.
Gestapo-style.
Nonsense.
I know the style, they're Canadian.
Get up!
Get up, I said.
Kindly leave me alone.
He can't be serious.
Did you hear that?
Let's take him outside.
Shall we?
- Don't touch me, I don't feel well.
- Start moving!
Stop fooling around, I told you...
I told you not to touch me.
You must be joking.
What's in that bag?
Watch out, he has a gun!
Bastard!
How do you feel?
All right. It's stopped bleeding...
Are you insisting that these papers are yours?
Victor Chotovicky, Lieutenant...
"Member of the Czechoslovak Forces, served in Great Britain with the RAF,
"is to take over the management of Alfred Heinemann's property
"at Schwarzbach.
"The above named officer will make an inventory.
"He is under direct orders of the Regional Committee at Olomouc
"and the Ministry of Defence. "
May I?
Signed Vymazal, Squadron Leader...
To begin with, not Schwarzbach but Cerny potok.
Papers like this are a dime a dozen.
I could have you locked up.
You don't happen to have a glass of milk?
No, I never drink the stuff.
What's wrong?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Really, nothing.
Will you have a drop of this?
That would kill me. I have ulcers.
You served in the RAF with ulcers?
I worked in the store.
Where?
In Aberdeen, Scotland.
And what's this for?
We all got it as a parting present.
We got nothing.
I've got to requisition this.
You don't have a permit...
And who issues such permits?
I do.
Is it American?
The cigarette, I mean.
English, it was part of my rations.
Hejna speaking.
Yes, Squadron Leader.
Yes, he's here.
Damned!
Yes, I hear.
I understand. You can trust me.
Yes. Goodbye.
Damn! The idiots!
That seems to be correct.
I am sorry.
I know Squadron Leader Vymazal.
- We met during the mobilization.
- I see.
I am sorry. The boys will apologize.
I'd rather they didn't.
I hope you understand - there are all sorts of trash coming to settle here - but I'll teach them that we aren't in Texas!
This isn't Sorrento!
Isn’t Sorrento in Italy?
Never mind. I won't have it.
This is going to be a village like any other.
I understand.
Just a minute, Lieutenant.
Put this in your bag and choose an M.G.
Inspector!
Mr. Hejna!
Franz Hallmeier set fire to his house!
That's what we have to cope with every day.
I'd like to...
- Fire!
- Here you are!
- Fire!
- Coming!
Take some ammunition too...
Where's the fire-brigade?
Sorry, Inspector, we can't get to the water because of Hallmeier's livestock.
- Where are Karel and Jindra?
- They are here.
But the herd is wild with fear.
They are waiting for you. Come on.
I am no bullfighter, stupid!
Stay here, just in case.
There's been too much of this.
I'm going to take hostages the way they used to.
Where do I get the keys?
You fool! Even the gate is missing.
I'll send one of the boys along.
Don't.
I want to be alone.
If you want to be alone, Lieutenant, take the M.G.
I won't.
And don't call me Lieutenant.
Mr. Chotovicky, why did you come here?
One day Ulrich saw a monster under a tree
20 heads, and a beautiful...
This is the end of the road.
Sir!
Sir!
What are you doing there?
You mustn't go there!
What are you doing there?
I'm looking for Heinemann's house.
What?
Heinemann's house!
Get back to the road!
There are landmines everywhere!
You won't give up, Basler?
I'm going to report you!
Leave them alone, they haven't noticed me.
Are you Czech?
Yes. We're the only Czechs here who've lived with them during the war.
Where did you get this?
I am a victim of love.
- What?
- Never mind.
I know what they are capable of.
They even mined under the corpses before they left.
We couldn't give them a decent burial.
Could you let me have some milk?
Why not?
We are getting a seventh cow.
Dad and I have to manage alone now.
Our Vilma has gone off to Opava.
We are going to get Germans to help with the farm.
Vilma is my big sister.
- I have no mother.
- You have no mother?
No. She died.
Dad keeps complaining and running off to the doctor.
Mother never said a word, and then she died.
You are kind.
- How old are you?
- Only 15. What's this?
Chewing gum.
An American invention.
What about you, do you have a family?
Don't chew so hard, your jaws will hurt.
No. I don't have one.
That's all right.
You don't have to worry.
What are you doing here?
Answer me!
Don't you understand Czech?
You're German.
A pass to be back in the camp at 4:00.
All right.
How did you get in?
I don't understand Czech.
Oh, I see...
Only one? Or are there more?
That's all.
- Two?
- Yes, only two.
My God!
What's the matter with you?
Sorry.
I just woke up.
Just now?
What have you been doing all night?
I slept.
I slept for 15 hours.
I'm still dazed.
Everything's rotten, Lieutenant.
Is your package in order?
Quite. You can keep the booze.
All I want is the fruit juice.
Thanks. That's something special and you don't want to be paid?
No.
I think we're going to get along.
I am sure we will.
Autumn is lovely up here.
Yes. That's what I need.
Peace and quiet, long walks.
To be cut off from the rest of the world.
This isn't quite the rest of the world.
This isn't quite the right place.
Why isn't it?
You'll be enjoying your peace and quiet till I find you with your throat cut one day.
You can't be serious.
Do you find her to your satisfaction?
She knows what to cook.
Her dad had something wrong with his liver.
He'll hang all right.
Was he was on a diet too?
Who?
Her dad, Heinemann?
I took him to Olomouc myself.
- What?
- The girl is his daughter.
Didn't you know?
The daughter of the great Fascist,
Heinemann.
You can have someone else if you're afraid of her.
- Nonsense.
- This used to be a Jewish residence.
Heinemann took over and played the baron.
I always say what you don't earn with honest work isn't blessed.
I never requisitioned even a radio and I was the first to get here.
The girl must take after her mother.
Her mother was a decent, religious woman.
But I wouldn't trust anyone nowadays.
Come!
Come.
I'll show you something.
Nasty, isn't it?
This is what they called the stocks in the Middle Ages.
Later they used it for the dogs.
Heinemann used it for Polish prisoners in winter.
Well...
They say he beat people to death right here.
Was she there?
Well, yes. God only knows what she's witnessed.
We all get what's due to us.
The old man will hang and his daughter scrubs floors.
That's what I call justice.
Could I keep her here, Inspector?
Keep what?
The girl, to live here. I am supposed to eat every two hours.
Oh, all right, I understand.
Wait! Take your coat off, you are going to stay here.
Don't argue, you're staying here.
- What is she saying?
- She doesn't want to stay.
She says she'd rather stay in the camp.
She doesn't want to stay.
Pity, I've been treating her well.
You shouldn't.
Don't be too soft on her.
As long as her dad is at our mercy she's going to be good, I bet.
I've made up my mind.
You are going to stay here!
Deal with her in your own way,
Lieutenant.
Just don't take it seriously.
Don't take it seriously.
I'll be back.
Why did you get up?
Sit down.
What's your name?
Adelheid.
Good morning.
Is this your room?
Yes, it was my room.
Is that you?
Yes.
My father. My mother is dead.
My brother was killed in Russia, near Zhitomir.
Would you?
No.
Bastards!
Wait...
...to wait...
I wait...
Bed...
And wait in bed...
Wait in my bed...
Shall I make a fire in the bathroom?
- What?
- In the bathroom.
The bathroom... yes, do.
Go to my room.
And wait in my bed.
Stop drinking and get to work.
We want this to be a happier place.
You've tidied up the library.
You've done a good job.
What about this?
Save it, every drop is precious.
- Do you drink?
- I'll be damned.
- Submarine fuel, that's what it is.
- Where did you find it?
Behind the books.
A bottle for each classic.
That's fate.
I've been searching the cellar, the attic, but never the library.
Sorry, I refuse to burn books.
I've finished. Let's go.
That's the stuff.
I say,
Johann Strauss was a great artist - a man of high principles and above all, a great lover.
Above all...
Don't overdo it.
The first sip is the strongest.
Tell her to have a drink, too.
Miss Heinemann!
Come here.
Cheers.
A true German woman, keeps up with the men, come what may.
The only good thing she learned.
Cheers!
Listen to what they're playing!
Listen...
I know these waltzes.
The first one's called
"Nur für Natur".
Then the one about... the dangerous cousin.
This one...
...is from "The Merry War".
"Der lustige Krieg".
Do you mind if I take my jacket off?
I don't mind.
What are you doing, you idiot?
I just want to find out where the shooting is...
Stop fiddling with it, you fool.
And don't give her any more booze.
The silly laughs shows she's had enough.
She ought to eat something.
Go and eat something.
Turn the record over, quickly.
Picking on me again. As always.
Damn. Let go!
That's enough!
Where have you been, Lieutenant?
Hungary, Yugoslavia, via Port Said to England.
Had a good time, did you?
I was stuck in Scotland till the end of the war.
- Did you meet any black girls?
- I did.
Black, Jewish... and Arab.
Thanks.
I met a black girl with dyed blonde hair.
What? That's a joke.
Which one was better in bed?
I don't know.
I didn't put them to the test.
I never... had a black girl.
Slovak girls, yes, even German, and a Ukrainian working in the cotton-mill.
But a black girl...
What's wrong?
You need some fresh air.
Tell him to get out.
A black girl...
Will you have a drink with me?
I have to eat something.
I have to eat all the time though I've never enjoyed it.
I hate it all: Food, cigarettes, drinks.
You talk like a fool.
Were you worried?
I told you to keep your trap shut.
Were you worried one of the girls would give you VD?
Shut up!
- Have you ever been drunk?
- How drunk?
So drunk you had a complete blackout.
A long time ago.
Before my mother died.
I inherited the weak stomach from her.
Nonsense.
I was looking forward to going home.
And now I've found only strangers.
I don't understand anyone.
There are things one shouldn't think about.
Switch the light off, my eyes hurt.
So you won't have a drink?
I've had enough.
What's this supposed to be?
What got into you?
Look at her, how she stares!
The beast! I'd like to kick her.
Go to my room and wait for me in bed.
So that's the way things are.
Why not? I agree.
That's the easy way.
Otherwise, just hit her!
- What did you say?
- Nothing.
That's your business.
I don't mind.
Much has been drunk here in the past.
OK...
I can take it.
Captain Andrejs was a better drinking partner.
A great guy, a partisan, served in Beneš' army...
Six years in the underground...
We took over... together.
Damn!
So you've been shooting at the pictures?
Only for fun.
- Let go, Lieutenant.
- Don't call me Lieutenant!
Get out! You too!
- I haven't done anything.
- That's even worse.
I don't want to see anyone.
Please go.
Go, go.
The lady is through.
I want her back at the camp by 8:00 am.
That's for your information,
Lieutenant Chotovicky.
As you wish.
That's what I've been expecting but the lady stays.
Good night.
I told you to watch out.
Good night.
Beyond the grave we will remain in friendship and fidelity.
Deep, holy nature, let me be a child, to sleep like a child and in peace.
God's Sun, walking alone in the blindness of passing time, goes to the crossroads in the field, where we will part, where lies a cross...
Do you understand Czech?
My diary, where did you find it?
I am glad you don't understand me as if I were talking to a dog.
When I woke up next to you in the morning
I thought I had come home.
I dreamt my parents were standing in the yard, and shut the gate when they saw me.
Adelheid?
Are you here?
Sitting in the dark?
The table in our kitchen was made of lime-wood.
When they carved up a pig, it was streaked with blood.
But if you scrubbed it with sand, it was as white as snow.
Our dog used to lie under the table.
I used to throw fatty scraps of meat to her.
- Shall I leave the light on?
- Yes, maybe.
Why do you close your eyes?
I couldn't...
Come, come...
Hey!
What did you tell her?
Don't you understand?
What did you tell her?
Old Heinemann was hanged yesterday in Olomouc.
- Adelheid!
- No!
Is that you, Adelheid?
We seem to have a visitor.
- Who else has a key?
- The third key...
Sorry. Get dressed quickly.
I need a hot drink.
I feel awful.
Go to hell!
What are you here for?
Oh, dear God...
Go away! Go!
It will soon pass.
At last, I feel I have come home.
Do you understand?
Adelheid! Are you listening?
What's the matter?
It's snowing.
Sorry to bother you but I have a serious reason...
There's a serious reason...
What reason?
A reason that concerns the young lady.
As you know, she's the daughter of the biggest Nazi in the region.
He's dead.
And you already told me.
I've just learned that she went to a convent school at Beuthen.
- Do you know what that means?
- I don't.
They only took the best.
I've seen a lot but I've never seen worse whores.
- Do you want to know the details?
- Anything else?
Yes. Hansgeorg Heinemann.
What about him?
He died, in Russia.
Quite a number of corpses have come back alive.
Would you mind if I stayed here overnight?
You're welcome.
I'm glad I don't have to explain.
My people are keeping watch on the village, but you are alone.
What's going to become of her?
That depends.
Was someone shooting here yesterday?
Someone's always shooting.
Right now, I want to catch young Heinemann.
Will you let her stay?
- For the time being.
- For how long?
Till we catch him. A day or two.
We are sure to get him by then.
- And then what?
- How should I know?
I said that depends.
I had to report it.
What do you want so as to leave her alone?
Two bottles of Cognac.
I'll get them for you.
And to knock your teeth in,
Mr. Chotovicky.
Excuse me. I'm making a cup of tea.
You are a bastard!
You make me sick.
To buy a woman for two bottles of Cognac.
Your hands are cold.
Have a drink.
Are you afraid?
No.
Let go, please.
Don't be afraid.
Everything's going to be all right.
You will see.
Everything's going to be all right.
You don't happen to have ointment to put on these cursed frostbites?
Hans!
Hansgeorg!
What have you done?
Beast!
Beast!
Come, Victor.
You still want to talk to her?
Here.
Thanks.
They want to take you to Olomouc.
I am supposed to give evidence.
You don't have to be afraid.
I will not say anything.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I am sorry for you.
All I want to know is...
Shall I translate?
...did you hate me all the time?
Even when...
...I had that attack and you came to help me?
When?
No, I didn't, then...
Do you remember the day after...
She remembers the first day...
You watched me chop wood...
...when you came down, you blushed.
Later, I found you had slipped a pack of cigarettes in my bag.
I was surprised.
The pills you had to take, you always broke them up.
I didn't quite know what you wanted from me.
You seemed so shy... and then...
Then you sent me upstairs to wait for you in bed.
Then you were just like all the others.
That can be changed!
I can't stay alone.
I have no one else...
What?
She wants to know what you said.
Tell her I have no one, only her.
Tell her that.
Don't be afraid, Adelheid.
I can help if you want me to.
Do you hear, Adelheid?
- What are you staring at?
- Get it over with, Lieutenant.
Come. Let's go.
Take this little exhibition away, will you?
Exhibits, Captain!
Take them away.
If we reach the town in daylight, we have to go.
I've seen enough.
- Are you through with her?
- I've finished, Captain.
Captain! We're in trouble, Captain!
She won't open the door.
She asked to...
I sent Šterba to watch the window in case she'd try to escape.
I've been here watching the door.
That's terrible!
Date, place, time of death...
Let's say 3:25...
Here.
Come and read the statement.
Here you are.
Do you want me to read it to you?
Protocol about the suicide of Adelheid Heinemann - spinster, date of birth...
That's beside the point.
Cause of death:
Suicide by strangulation...
The dead woman was wearing a reddish fur coat without a collar.
Her face was pressed against the right side of the wall.
Under the fur coat, the dead woman was wearing blue trousers,
white socks and ski-boots,
a grey sweater buttoned on the left shoulder.
The fur coat was unbuttoned.
One of its three buttons was missing.
In the pockets was 657 crowns,
five gold coins and a ticket
from Cerná Voda to Orlice worth 27 crowns, dated 21 December.
On her left wrist she wore a gold watch.
The watch stopped at 7:13.
Under the grey sweater,
the dead woman was wearing a white slip, undamaged, a bra,
briefs, suspender belt, home-made stockings...
He's wrong, Juanito.
He mustn't do it. Listen to me.
What did he say?
Juanito, as I told you before, there is too much violence in the world.
And beside that, there's another reason.
I don't want our friend Sabata to get hurt now.
But the Murdocks deserve to die, Padre
You know the Murdocks stole everything from us here.
- They should be punished.
- Juanito.
Have you forgotten what I taught to you?
You must try to forgive, not s nk nto revengo
- I know, Father.
- Go tell Sabata this.
He shouldn't risk his neck for those Murdock brothers.
Tell him our prayers are his.
He doesn't need to fight.
But as our Good Book often says,
"The Lord will provide."
Yes, Father.
I beg you to be careful, my son.
- The Lord be with you.
- The Lord is Sabata.
Too much violence.
Order arms!
Left face!
Forward march!
- 20 dollars.
- 10 dollars on the Murdocks.
Right.
100 dollars on the Murdock brothers.
Ain't nobody betting on the challenger?
- How about you, Ballantine?
- 100 dollars. On the black.
You can spare a dollar, can't you?
Just to keep this shut up, hm?
Black's my favourite colour, friends.
I always win on black.
It's best if we all get the hell out.
Might get a little hot.
I'm looking for a certain man for a special job. Sabata.
Not now Co m o o n
We're all set for you to go out in style.
Haven't you noticed?
Sabata! You better make him turn!
Hey! Begin the shooting when it stops.
Sabata likes them lying down.
Guess Murdock's nailed for good.
Know w h at m oa n?
- Huh?
- Ah.
Sorry.
That blasted bird needs oil. Here, you go do it.
- No oil, no money.
- Give me that, you little runt!
- Hey, the man you wanted...
- I think I can find him.
Let's go.
You know what Colonel Skimmel looks like.
How about it? Will you accept?
I hoped you'd be able to do this job for me.
Thank you.
Adiós
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you might need my help.
M ay go w t h yo u??
Ma ko very good tort as have a not h oryob for yo u
Deliver this to Father Mike.
Tell him that the Murdocks have found their... great reward...
...and wish to make a contribution.
Hello.
Well... how much did you make, Ballantine?
A mere bagatelle.
I'm here for something more important.
Colonel Skimmel.
We could... work together.
Hey, you!
We Austrians have eyes everywhere.
If you want some advice, forget about those Mexicans.
Oh!
Hey! Hey, what is this? Get me down!
You pig, you! Do you hear? Cut me loose!
I'll kill you for this, you dirty American dog!
I swear I'll make you pay, filthy Yankee!
Hang around. I'll be back.
You bastard, I'll get you when I'm down!
You play that rotten!
Reach that gate and you're a free man, subject to the colonel's marksmanship.
Give them a chance. Release two, three, four of them, altogether.
Long live the revolution!
We appreciate your aid, Garcia.
Colonel Skimmel will be most generous with you.
Garcia Moreno?
Ah, you did very well, dear Garcia.
You helped us expose this filthy revolutionary plot.
You also saved my life.
It has not been forgotten.
Our beloved emperor, Maximilian, and this humble soldier, are very grateful.
In the drawer under the model ship, you will find your 20 pieces of gold.
Thank you.
The key is there.
Open it.
- Perfect.
- Mm-hm.
As usual.
Ho wo rsst k nd o f nfo rm or. For go d ho wo u d h ave bot rayod h s ow n m ot h or. Or us

Everyone here?

Juan De Los Angeles.
Jesus Rivalta!
Luis Miguel Cortejo.
They're all good men. Yours for the mission.
- I hope you approve.
- Aha.
European money.
Who bought you?
Did you sell out to that pig Skimmel?
He's a spy, Ocano.
Septiembre!
Stand back from the traitor.
Gitano!
Gitano!
The flamenco of death.
No!
Gitano and Septiembre are all the men I'll need.
That gold will buy us guns.
We'll get stronger than their soldiers and nobody can stop us then.
The man who'll be helping you is a soldier.
A soldier of fortune.
He'll find out when the gold leaves Guadalupe and what road you must follow.
He's made the arrangements with the men that sell guns.
He's waiting for you in Kingsville, Texas.
- And don't forget the password. Hear?
- I know.
There's still another thing that I keep worrying about.
Mu st wo oave t h o revo u t o n up to a so d or o f fort u no??
This one, yes.
He's all right, Escudo. It's Sabata.
Ah. It's very good.
Tequila, a bottle.
It stinks in here.
Smells like pigs are around.
Here, you smell anything, Septiembre?
Your friend has no nose, or he's a liar.
All you mangy pigherders smell disgusting.
You're too full of it to be a judge, my friend.
Well?
Well?
Any time.
Uh-uh.
Isn't it enough you lost a friend?
Aw.
Have a beer!
The smell doesn't bother him any more.
From now on, he's going to learn to smoke.
Thank you, hombre. Many thanks.
If friends are what you need?
Anything for Benito Juarez.
This is our man. This one's Sabata.
Amigo, Ocano sent us to meet you.
N co toc h nkqu o, h u h??
Tco m os w t h b ract co
The last time I played this...
Ah, here it is.
Los Palos, St Christopher's Day.
I've got a bad memory.
Write everything down in the book.
Nover w t h o u t t
Wa t fo r m o o u ts do
Colonel Skimmel appreciates an artistic type like myself.
Relaxes with me.
In Guadalupe, I'm like one of the family.
Out at the fort every day.
Seeing things, hearing things.
Do you know Colonel Skimmel?
He challenged me to a shooting match once.
- Hard man to beat.
- It remains to be seen.
With four hands, it would be perfect, huh?
I play solo.
Such a pity.
Colonel Skimmel has two pianos.
Why not join me?
I'll play the melody.
Hey, amigo. Is your pal in there at the piano with us?
He'll keep out of this thing if I can help it.
- What about them? Are you sure they're OK?
- Sure. Who do you think they are?
Hoso two?? Ro octs fro m t h o oca m u so u m j
Huh, them? They're very good men.
They're my two falcons, two hawks, two eagles.
Two fighting buzzards.
Don't you believe me?
Hey!
See that?
What did I tell you?
And this one is Septiembre.
You want to see something great? Look.
Go ahead.
- Hey, you loco?
- You have nothing to worry about.
If we get the gold.
Lieutenant Stejer!
Easy now. There we are.
Here we go. There she is.
Detail... forward!
Go!
Colonel Skimmel, I'll never finish your portrait.
This is your twentieth sitting.
Ah, I see you write everything down.
That's a good idea.
M a ny g reat art sts h ave bad m o m ories
- Time is money.
- That's what you Americans think.
But I'm an Austrian.
And for an Austrian, time does not exist.
Oh, no. I don't frown like this.
My face is more joyful.
- Loosen the mouth a trifle.
- You smile so pretty, Colonel.
Packing off a wagonload of grain made you as happy as sending a shipment of silver dust.
You don't miss very much, friend Ballantine.
As I've told you, Colonel, my mind never rests.
The peons are shouting for vengeance.
M ox co 's a h otbod o f revo u t on.
We shall crush them.
I've already taken the necessary precautions.
We Austrians know exactly what we are doing.
It's all been worked out.
It has been planned, pre-arranged and studied down to its last detail.
It is inevitable and mathematically perfect.
We Austrians are men of steel.
- Colonel, please.
- We never go back on our word.
Our beloved Emperor Maximilian is our model and our strength.
There. Much better.
Now
Whoa!
Somebody's moved in on our game.
Take cover! Quickly! We're surrounded!
- Long live liberty!
- Long live free Mexico!
What's going on?
Let's get out of here. Come on!
Adiós amigos
José!
Jesus! Juan! My brothers, my friends!
Amigos, may you be received by the Lord above!
M ay yo u r m ot h or wve o n h o rsso d u ng!
Two falcons without wings.
I was the greatest high-jumper long ago.
- Shame on you for such lies.
- Let's go get the gold.
Austrian.
Let's go.
Hy-hoo!
Hah!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Wait for me! Give me a hand, Gitano!
Good. We made it, Sabata, eh?
A chest full of gold... to buy arms with.
Buy arms! Buy them to kill Maximilian and drive the Austrians home.
- Long live Mexico!
- Long live the revolution!
Hey, Escudo.
Doos h o ook ko t h at boca u so ho 'd ko a t h o go d to h m so f?

When he was born, there was a great rainstorm. Your birthday's the 2 September?
You're wrong, amigo. It must be the 2 of November, All Souls' Day.
Well done, Lieutenant.
Traitors should be shot in the back.
Escudo was in command of the Mexican rebels.
I also saw Sabata with him.
I know him. He's a great shot.
They were headed for Texas.
- Thank you, Lieutenant. You can go.
- Yes, sir.
Writing table.
- We're in very serious trouble.
- They won't get very far.
We have an efficient intelligence service in Texas.
Hm.
It'll be easier to hide individual sacks of gold than a clumsy chest like that.
Mu c h oas o r hs c h ost m u st n' t bo u nloadod

Whoa.
Whoa.
Wait for me at the San Juan Monastery.
I'm heading in to Kingsville.
The gunrunners will be waiting for me there.
- And so will Ballantine.
- Ballantine? I...
The piano player.
So long.
It's Sabata.
Gentlemen.
Your gun, please.
Gunrunning is a dangerous profession, isn't that right?
I faint at disagreeable sights.
That's why they wear hoods.
You're an intelligent man, Sabata.
I respect you.
- Why do you join up with scum?
- They are more my kind. You're not.
- Mind if I smoke?
- Mm.
Oh, I forgot. I took the last one myself.
- I can buy some more with your gold.
- I shan't even ask you where it is.
I shall use a little Austrian logic.
In fact, it's discovered already.
When you have gold, there aren't many places to hide it.
Like the San Juan monastery.
Sorry, I don't belong to that parish.
Even so, we will see you have a respectable funeral here, in Kingsville, as will all your Mexican friends.
I'll be back, I assure you.
You'd be smart to relax a little bit, while we wait for Mr Folgen to return.
No, t h a nks W o do n' t d rin k w t h t h o doad
I drink only with friends... except for you.
Don't mind my back, gentlemen.
Forget it, Sabata.
It's your home, after all.
Septiembre, come on in and have a shot.
That won't work with us. Try again.
- Your brother?
- Mm-mm.
The sun is high.
And where is he?
I don't like this place. It's too quiet.
Silent as death.
Only Escudo's footsteps can be heard on the dry earth.
Everybody else is dead.
Even you seem to be dead.
Ah, go to hell.
And the gold, right out there.
The way things are now, this is the perfect chance to take it.
- Whose chance?
- How would I know that?
It could even be my chance.
You believed it, didn't you?
Why not mine?
Manuel...
We're surrounded. I'll try to draw them off.
You take care of the cart.
These American guns aren't very good, are they?
Escudo!
- First we must think of the gold.
- To hell with the gold. Gitano!
Gitano!
Stop! Don't shoot!
G ta no, aam go, m ay yo u r so u bo reco ved by t h o ord above
Idiot!
You want me to have a heart attack?
- Come on, amigo. Hurry!
- Don't try anything. You're covered.
He tricked us. The Austrian bastards will kill us.
- Get your hands up.
- No, you first.
Amigo
Oh.
They have the gold, huh?
Hey, Blondito, where do you think you're going?
Sabata, I'm glad you showed up.
Tell him I wasn't stealing it.
I just thought one of us oughta take care of the gold.
Huh?
Gitano, the flamenco of death.
Why did you stop me?
It's only fair. After all, he's the one who gave us the information about the gold shipment.
Him?
He said he was trying to protect the gold.
No reason w h y s h o u d n' t bo ove h m
No??
No
The gunrunners have been wiped out.
- All we can do is turn the gold over to Ocano.
- We'll take care of that.
I think I'll come along.
I got the rest of my pay coming.
Me too. From him.
Don't worry. Now let's get moving.
Every Austrian in the territory will be looking for us now.
We'll make our first stop at Eagle Pass on the Mexican border.
You can thank Sabata we didn't kill you this time, Blondito.
If your crazy stunt had worked, they would have taken their revenge on me.
You saved my life.
Fyo u save a m a n' s fo, yo u 're resbo nss b o fo r h m for t h o rest o f h s days
It makes me feel quite secure.
About the gold.
You and me. Fifty-fifty?
Hey, what's he say?
- He wants us to try a new idea.
- His ideas are nothing.
Mot h m a nd k now ng h t away ho was no good
You know why?
Because he's got a big mouth.
All OK.
Admit it's a good idea to hide the gold here.
- Think he's trying to trick us?
- Just don't let him get out of your... rifle range.
Come on!
Ballantine, hi.
It's been so long.
I'm still your favourite model, aren't I?
We... never quite finished that picture, did we?
Sabata! Come on out with your filthy friends or we'll kill everyone in the place!
Hey, hold it!
All right, we're leaving.
Sabata.
- What are you doing here?
- I got information for you.
The Austrians are falling back. Our people just took Las Palomas and Trincheras.
- How do you know?
- I'm Mexican. I know.
How long have you been following me?
Go home.
Go back to Father Mike.
- If you say so, Sabata.
- All right, watch your step.
Be with you in two shakes, huh?
Escudo! Where is the cart?
For the last time, where is the cart?
Manuel, it has been in a good cause and also may your soul be received by the Lord.
You stand honoured by your deeds, up to the end.
Yes. And you shall be a model held in honour among our men.
José, Juan, Jesús.
They shall sing your praises in Mexico in all the days to come.
If I should forget, let me be thrown into the deepest pit of hell.
Hey, I almost forgot! Where's Ballantine?
Hyah!
We were just gonna go look for you fellas. Right?
Take it. Here.
It's yours.
With a load of gold like this, split three ways, three happy hombres living in peace and plenty.
Shall we go?
Hm.
- We stay.
- Ballantine!
Now wo m ay a oave
Whoa!
Hyah!
- But it's for the revolution.
- Oh, sure! The revolution.
All this beautiful gold turned into rifles, cannons and death.
- I'm not touching it.
- How about trying to buy peace with it?
A load of gold could be divided five ways.
What a contribution to my favourite charity: Me.
No! T's only go ng to t h o revo u t o n ho A u st ria nss a re ret reat ng h oy 've d u t
- How do you know that?
- There are ways.
- You're just talking. I don't believe you.
- OK, don't.
Yo u b a nn od t h s n Texas bu t wo n' t ot yo u rob u s o f a revo u t o n
Mothers, sisters, wives and sweethearts, all weeping and all blaming you.
M o?? W h y b a m o m o??
You want to change this harmless gold to death and destruction.
Remember your dead friends,
Juan, José, Jesús... Manuel?
No! H oso m o n a re doad bu t not t h at basta rd M ax m a n
M ox co m u st bo bo ratod!
Long live Mexican liberty!
Long live the revolution!
All right, you win.
- I think it does belong to the people.
- Comes the revolution!
- Ah!
- Yeah!
Ah... Hey, Senor Gold!
"Today, April 26th, I am finally rich!"
Gold! Gold!
Sand.
We risk our lives, let them kill our men.
For what? A box of sand?
God, we must be crazy.
Well...
Easy come... easy go.
Let's look at the Austrians' logic.
A load of gold is shipped from Guadalupe.
A band, not of Mexicans but Austrians dressed as Mexicans, attacks and steals the gold.
The blame falls on the revolution.
Bu t Co ono SSk m m o d d n' t f g u re on o u r r a d
Now h o knows t h at wo know
He may be an officer, bu t do n' t oxboct h m to bo a gont o m a n
One measly sack of the real stuff...
...on top.
Skimmel. That lousy thief. Pah!
Wo, gont o m on, t's boon f u n, bu t ca n' t wasto a ny m ore t m o
I want to wish you all the... very best of luck.
Especially you, Escudo. You're gonna have a hard time convincing the revolutionaries that you didn't steal the gold.
And you know what'll happen?
You might end up dripping fat into the fire with an apple up your big mouth and a spit up your caboose.
Save your bullets for the revolution.
Adiós
!A diós!
I know what's on your mind. I just tell Ocano the men who stole the gold were those two.
Both of you are cowards.
They trust me. I don't have to lie.
- Huh?
- Mm-mm.
Senor Ocano, the French at Candelas and Atienza are getting reinforcements from Colonel Skimmel's army.
We could attack the fort from the rear, from Texas, across the bridge at Guadalupe.
The revolution is not going to cause an international incident.
Gaviota will fall, then we're set.
As soon as those precious new weapons arrive, we'll strike at Candelas and at Atienza too.
As for Skimmel's Austrians, to cross the Sierras is impossible.
But they could slip out, north, into Texas across the only bridge the Austrians control, this one, at Guadalupe.
Perdito, it's a job for you.
Blow up the Guadalupe bridge.
Kngsville s t h at way
Bu t SSk m m o
I'd like to collect the money on his portrait.
How much are you asking for it?
A chest full of gold?
You kidding? I'd end up before a firing squad.
- I got a plan.
- Forget it.
No, m oa n it. W o go f fty f ryy
We'll split it in five equal shares.
But how?
Those three?
God knows where they are. Hey!
- Where are you going?
- Guadalupe Bridge.
Forward march!
Skimmel!
Skimmel, we must be quick.
Gaviota's about to fall to the revolutionaries.
Major Metternich! Open up!
Bofore nig h tfa, t h o ont re ga rr son w bo ma rc h ng towa rd Ca ndo as to a d t h o renc h
We shall go to Texas at daybreak in civilian dress, posing as honest beer merchants.
- The rebels are blocking the way.
- As soon as we cross the bridge, we blow it up.
Hello.
I've brought a present for Colonel Skimmel.
It's Sabata.
Just in case.
Hey!
We just put those in there to bed.
Don't go. We have plans for you too.
Perdito! Leave Sabata alone.
He works for us.
The bridge must be blown up.
It's Ocano's orders.
Well, I admire your loyalty, friend.
Bu t w t h t h o bndgo b ownk u b, how ca n wo got t h o go d to t h o g u nr u nn orss??
We've just arrived now.
We've new orders from Ocano.
Adiós. And good luck.
Now, m y B ond to
An apple in my mouth?
I'll show you who's on a spit!
Escudo!
You're always butting in.
This time I'm going to punch him in the jaw.
We need him. He knows where the gold is.
Blondito, huh?
Ha!
Four hours till daylight.
No time to waste.
Ca rr y a m oda fonk uck f yo u want, bu t not m y watc h
It's not because it's yours.
Septiembre likes music.
Soldier, Lieutenant Stejer wishes to see you.
He's expecting you in the orderly room.
Homeward bound at last.
- It's about time, sir.
- Of course it is. In fact, it's way past time.
M g u o! Do n' t wo over oat a ro u nd h ore??
This is a forgotten town.
The commandant doesn't care if we live or die.
You're right. They blame us for all their defeats.
You men, follow me!
There's no other way.
Septiembre.
Who's there?
All gone, eh?
Well, you picked some time to be without ammunition.
Hey! You clown.
Take the sentry's place. You too, Gitano.
Listen.
It's impossible to cross the camp square.
I'm gonna open the back door to the depot.
From there, there's a short cut to the gold vault.
Phew!
- Hi.
- Good evening, Mr Ballantine.
Let's move. The gold's right next to us.
Ah, you're crazy.
It's not where I would have left it if I'd stolen it.
That's safest.
I'd make a hiding place no one would find.
In the ground, a cemetery.
M aybo ove n in s do t h ore
- Can you read that?
- Beer.
Let's go.
Forgot your book.
Thanks for picking it up for me.
- We made it.
- Halt! Don't move!
Hm.
You're the last person I would have suspected, my... cultured friend.
Search them.
No, SSorgoant ot h m koob t
You may write your last wishes.
I'll see that they're respected.
I would not have given you the honour of being executed by a firing squad.
Squad halt. Left face.
Order arms!
Soldier, come here.
Write it down in your book, Blondito.
- I'll make a date with you in hell.
- It's too late.
Squad! Load arms!
Open it.
That's right. I left them.
Come on, idiot.
Ready... aim.
Major Metternich!
'D ko t h s d a ry to bo fo rwa rdod to my m ot h o r

Run for it!
Cover me, Septiembre!
One more blast from that cannon and we're all dead.
I thought so.
Crook.
It's not mine now. I won't need it any more.
The gold...
The gold... Tell the others.
The gold...
The gun.
All right.
What's the proposition?
What makes you think there is one?
If there was no proposition, you would have killed me by now.
Indeed.
- Order your men to leave.
- They've come too far, Colonel.
They want their gold.
Hmph! Only I know where the gold is.
And you won't get it.
Unless... you make a deal with me.
Sorry. No deal.
I remember our marksmanship contest in Louisville.
You're the only man who ever defeated me, Sabata.
Pity you won't have another chance to beat me.
- Nothing can beat a superior people.
- Who knows?
Sometimes an idea's enough.
Folgen confessed.
The gold is under the ship model.
- Huh?
- Just as you are, reach and pull.
Say, you got a great little brain.
Oh, Septiembre can use this!
Folgen. He wanted me to open this and get killed.
- Have you any other tricks for me?
- You're wrong.
This is a big mistake.
I did my job. My job.
- It's not my fault.
- Cowardly pig!
Don't kill me.
You can't do it.
You... You can't do it.
Now s u bboso yo u to m o w h ore t h o go d s
Well...
Hey, where's Ballantine?
How could you do it?
He robbed Blondito.
Ah, poor Ballantine.
To die in the moment of our triumph.
So artistic, so generous.
And the most honest of us all.
I weep for him.
May his good soul go to heaven and be greeted by our Lord above.
Wait. This means there's only four of us.
So we divide his share between us. Eh?
What's this?
M y God
Gold! It's gold!
Septiembre, where were you?
What are you looking for?
Saw the best of us, didn't he?
Come on, let's go.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Go!
!Adiós!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Hey, Blondito! Too bad you can't get away with it, huh?
Hey, no! You can't do this to me!
- I'm on your side!
- You phoney double-crosser!
Ballantine's share goes to my favourite charity.

The duellist demands satisfaction.
Honour, for him, is an appetite.
This is a true story about an eccentric kind of hunger. lt begins in the year Napoleon Bonaparte became ruler of France.
Gentlemen, General Treillard.
Who knows Lieutenant Feraud?
7th Hussars.
- l do, sir.
- You know him well?
- l've once or twice met him, sir.
- Tell him he's under close arrest.
Lieutenant Feraud has skewered the mayor's nephew, an affair of honour. l've spent the last two hours apologising to the mayor.
Could you convey to Lieutenant Feraud how much l'd be likely to enjoy that?
- l hope so, sir.
- l hope so, too. ln case he feels an interest, the mayor's nephew is still alive...
...more or less.
Tell him l shall take pleasure in seeing him later. l want some food.
Perhaps you could rout out a crust?
- l regret the interruption.
- Sir.
- ls Lieutenant Feraud at home?
- He's gone out.
- Where?
- l don't know.
My dear, this is very important soldiers' business.
He went to pay a call.
Pay a call on whom? l'm sure he keeps nothing from you.
- Madame de Lionne.
- Did he?
He has an angel at home and off he goes to visit Mme de Lionne.
He must be quite blind.
Please pardon this intrusion. l'm on military business, a lamentable reason for invading your drawing room.
Come again this evening and plead your forgiveness.
Madame, l have orders for Lieutenant Feraud.
Please excuse us both. l have an order from General Treillard.
Report immediately to your quarters and remain there under close arrest.
What did you say? l'm only a messenger, that must be obvious. You heard my message.
Yes, damn you. Under arrest for what?
You did fight a duel this morning?
Of course.
You make duelling sound like a pastime in the Garden of Eden. l think we ought to leave now, don't you?
What have l done? Was l to let some sauerkraut-eater wipe his boots on the uniform of the 7th Hussars?
The sauerkraut-eater's uncle happens to be the mayor of Strasbourg.
The General had to hear his complaint. l'm obliged to him. Should l be grateful to you for finding me?
Frankly, l think you ought to be. l had no end of trouble finding you.
Calm yourself. l do advocate it most earnestly.
- You'd let them spit on Bonaparte?
- Bonaparte?
Bonaparte has nothing to do with this.
You think that name's come from the street?
Sir, whichever name you choose to defend, l'd use it with the utmost respect.
You know damn well which name!
Would you leave us alone, please?
Your duty is to victimise me.
Am l mistaken?
You chose to hunt me out in the drawing room of a lady who...
Sir, l respect your sentiments. But l can assure you the hunt was not my choice.
You have insulted me.
- You have insulted me!
- l have strained my patience.
- l demand an apology.
- This is too ridiculous.
Really, too ridiculous?
A proper general's poodle.
- Can you fight?
- l see no reason to.
What reason would you like?
Shall l spit in your face?
Shall l cut a chunk out of your backside?
Or would that be too ridiculous?
How do you get back to your general now? The window? l believe you're quite a madman.
You draw your sword.
You draw your sword.
Or l'll chase you down the street like a chicken.
You will not. l will be delighted to fight you at the first opportunity.
- You'll fight now.
- l'm on duty and you're under arrest.
- Now!
- For duelling, you ape!
You'll fight now.
- Where?
- ln the garden.
- We have no seconds.
- l'll find you seconds.
Old man. Stand here... And watch me!
Enter.
- You've been scratched by a woman.
- Correct.
- Did you commit a crime of passion?
- Certainly not.
No, l agree that would be out of character.
Well, what happened?
- l wounded a man in a duel.
- How?
- Cut across the forearm.
- Name of adversary?
Gabriel Feraud.
- He fought a duel this morning.
- He also fought a duel this afternoon. l've anatomised the military man, literally picked through his brains. lt's my fate to put him together.
Haven't the slightest idea how he works.
- Where do l find this....
- Lieutenant Feraud.
What was the cause of the quarrel?
Ask him.
Ah. Cause of quarrel: obscure.
Still, we appear to be more civilised.
A tomcat wouldn't dream of sending a surgeon to another tomcat.
You could try this on your face.
You were recommended as a reliable young officer. You're a disgrace!
You look like a damned Hottentot!
Look at yourself!
You'll return to your regiment at once. l've no further use for you.
Pending an inquiry, you are confined to barracks under close arrest.
- Sir, l shall welcome the inquiry.
- You will, will you, Lieutenant? lf you emerge from it pure as driven snow, you remain an imbecile.
Get out.
The whole town is buzzing with it. l spoke with a delightful old gentleman, who affected to believe in the transmigration of souls.
He suggested you had both been enemies in a previous incarnation.
- What did Feraud suggest?
- He kept remarkably quiet about it.
Much like yourself.
- lt will all come out at the inquiry.
- There won't be an inquiry.
- You're disappointed?
- War?
Yes, yes... War again.
You'll be a free man, back with your troop tomorrow.
- Good.
- l imagined you'd think so.
So l have brought:
Two bottles.
One corkscrew.
And my flute.
Feraud intends to kill you.
- ls that what he says?
- Not to me, but...rumour goes round.
Damn him, anyway!
He's most unreasonable.
The enemies of reason have a blind look.
He has it, don't you think?
What can l do? l have given it some thought.
You cannot fight: one, if you are in different places; two, if you are of different rank, it's a breach of discipline; and three, if the state is at war.
Duels of nations take absolute precedence.
Therefore, keep away from him, keep ahead of him, put your trust in Bonaparte.
Thank you.
Just before history rolls over it, what was the cause of the duel?
Are you asking on behalf of the town?
Call it a light cavalry skirmish.
All in all, l'm far from certain myself.
After six months of hard campaigning, there came an interval of peace.
- Hold him, Gabriel.
- Are you holding on to the table?
- Richard, is he on the table?
- No, l'm not!
- Got you!
- Left arm. Double or nothing.
- No, l only bet right arm. Another?
- Yes.
- Where's your bet?
- Trust me.
- Trust me!
- No!
Damned muscle never healed properly.
Remember that boudoir soldier in Strasbourg? That staff lackey?
You'll act for me, won't you?
- Armand! Armand D'Hubert!
- Laura!
Hey, Moustache. My bags.
- Now tell me you're married.
- Madame, l am entirely at your service.
My dear Armand. How very gallant.
What a relief!
Well. Now l've found you, it would be an act of mercy if you put us both to bed.
Marie-Rose went bald.
She caught the mange in ltaly, poor bitch.
- How did Jacques respond?
- Never saw it. He was killed at Marengo.
Simon must still be in Egypt.
And Etienne married that fat girl of his.
And l have received a token of love. l find that rather daunting.
With this ring, l renounce love.
And make do with you.
You were the one l always wanted.
You... You hussar!
- What's this?
- l'll have them driven in deeper, sir.
Why picket horses so near a river?
They'll be up to their knees in two hours.
Move them to higher ground.
Lieutenant D'Hubert?
Yes.
You're acquainted with
Lieutenant Feraud?
Yes.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Are you ready, gentlemen?
Right, gentlemen.
Sorry.
Gently, gently!
Just take off his cravat, please.
Easy, now. lt's all right.
Then undo his button. And we'll see.
Easy... Just get this...
Careful, careful!
Armand, it was a fair set-to. lt won't hurt your reputation, l can promise you that.
Why not make it up like a couple of good fellows?
There's no need to bear him a grudge.
All right. l'll shake hands.
- Well?
- He can't continue, l'm afraid. lt's quite bad.
- Can he continue?
- No, he's unable to.
Gabriel. Shake hands and forget it.
Whatever he did, you've paid him back.
- From all l hear, he's a decent fellow.
- Decent!
Don't expect decency from his kind.
Look at him, lolling about on the ground.
One touch and he's off home to his beloved general.
Next time, D'Hubert!
You should have made him shake hands with you. l was flat on my back.
One cannot control one's affairs from that position.
You should have got up.
You weren't dead! l wasn't well.
Besides, he'd only have stuck me again. He was waiting for the chance.
- You mean you'd have gone on fighting?
- No question. lt would have been the only honourable thing to do.
What's the matter?
- Going to sneeze.
- No, you mustn't! You don't have to.
Come on, think of something else.
- Describe honour.
- Honour?
- Honour.
- Honour is...
- Go on, you must!
- lndescribable...
Unchallengeable...
All the little girls adore you.
Well, you're a notorious and savage duellist.
- Savage.
- Notoriously savage!
And it's rumoured that you live with a savage bitch. lt's a shame he's such an idle brute.
One more duel, and God knows he needs the exercise, one more duel would make his reputation.
Young ladies would take smelling salts whenever he narrowed his eyes.
Narrow your eyes. l think you have a long way to go.
Armand!
We could leave by the back lane.
What for? lf he wants me, he'll find me.
You know him?
Yes.
Surely there is some other way out.
Don't talk about it any more.
The only way out is to go through with it.
One has to be ready. lt takes all one's attention to be ready.
Where is Gabriel Feraud?
Thank you, thank you.
Yes?
Gabriel Feraud.
Gabriel. l live with Armand D'Hubert. l knew a man stabbed to death by a woman: the surprise of his life. l once knew a woman who was beaten to death by a man. l don't think it surprised her at all.
You're a soldier's lady.
You should live here with me.
Nobody understands why you fight with Armand. lt's supposed to be a secret between the pair of you. l believe it's a secret of your very own. l believe you feed your spite on him, with no more sense than a nasty, bloodsucking louse.
Who do you suppose cares what you think?
- No one.
- Then why are you here? l came to take a look at you.
Look.
- Do you remember Martin?
- The gunnery sergeant who lost his arm.
He's out of the army now. He works at the ordinance factory in Rouen. l think he wants to marry me.
- He sent me the ring.
- What ring?
- This ring.
- Oh, that ring.
Marry him.
When l'm ready. l was told l might find
Lieutenant D'Hubert here.
Not here.
On the watch, sir. Always on the watch.
They don't all fight like fine gentlemen.
The Two of Swords, reversed.
Strife without reason, a quarrel pursued for its own sake.
Does this suggest your problem?
Seven of Cups. lt would seem that you must make a difficult choice.
The moon.
The moon is a symbol of solitude.
Here is the path you must take. lt is the path of instinct.
Everyone who travels on that path travels alone.
Between the two dogs.
Do l leave them both behind?
You must answer your own questions now. You're alone.
- Quickly. Break it up.
- Gently. l'm not hurt!
Are they dying?
The General will see you now, sir.
Sit down, before you fall down.
Your colonel speaks highly of you. l found you quite useful, too.
Yet in contact with Feraud you persistently behave like a wild beast.
Why is that?
Do you wish to reconvene an inquiry?
- Certainly not. No time.
- lt's a crucial point of honour. l cannot speak freely of the conduct of Lieutenant Feraud, if he has no chance to put his own case.
Claptrap.
Sir, l cannot fight the man three times and then tell tales on him.
Judging by the look of you, a change of tactics is what you need.
Very well. Convention allows you to be a chivalrous halfwit, but you won't be a quarrelsome halfwit.
You'll fight no more duels under my command. Understood?
Yes, sir.
Since you're now a captain, it would be a gross breach of discipline.
Your colonel sees you fit to command a troop. l'm not sure what you're fit for.
But l will not oppose his decision. lf you feel strong enough, you may leave now.
Five years passed. The map of Europe changed, and so did military fashion.
- Another time, then?
- No!
- Buy me a drink, darling?
- Next time.
Gilles.
You look mumpish. Cheer up. l have news for you.
Sit down. l have news to tell you.
The 7th Hussars have come to Lubeck.
Feraud is behind you. l'm sorry, l...
- Can you make out his rank?
- Captain.
Damn!
Perhaps, for your sake, you should face him now.
How can you avoid it?
He'll hunt you out in the end.
Keep your head down. This is my news: l'm being seconded to the staff of Marshal Bernadotte.
My appointment carries the rank of major. l'm to report for duty in a fortnight and l've been granted a fortnight's leave.
Gilles. l wish to consult you, in the utmost confidence, upon a fine point of honour.
Goodbye, Major.
Don't l know you well, eh?
- D'Hubert?
- That's right.
Armand D'Hubert!
Armand!
Laura. l come to Lubeck and the town is humming with your name.
Why weren't you killed at Elchingen?
That was my last news of you. lt was a hard day for the Regiment.
But nothing cures a duellist.
How was Martin?
More news gone astray:
He died of typhus, in the epidemic last July. l'm very sorry.
- Were you married? l never heard.
- Yes.
Right at the end, poor boy, for all the good it did.
Widow's weeds aren't much help to a lady of the garrison.
So now l beg...
...and strike up friendships.
Laura, go back to France.
There's only grief to be got from following soldiers.
Martin said...
He said, ''Go to that fool Armand.
He'll take you on again.''
This time he'll kill you.
- We thought on horseback.
- On horseback?
As a compliment to the Cavalry.
Feraud has agreed.
The Regiment expects it.
The Regiment expects it? l see.
We're now duelling as a compliment to the Cavalry.
Armand. Like it or not, you are a man of reputation.
A famous fire-eater. lt brings responsibilities. You must think of yourself as fighting on parade.
Feraud has been boasting all day.
But the betting still holds at even money. l'm going to be killed.
Responsibly, on horseback.
As a compliment to the Cavalry.
That's a useless sort of talk.
Gilles. l'm not fanatical enough to persevere in this absurdity.
- lf he so desires to kill me, he will.
- Damn it. Kill him! lt's absurd.
- Morning.
- Morning.
The combat should be well attended. l hear that LeBrun has given a breakfast party. l hope the weather improves for them.
Gentlemen!
Prepare to advance.
Charge!
Captain Feraud has taken a slight cut.
Until the blood has stopped, he can't see. l regret the duel must be discontinued.
Feraud was posted to Spain.
D'Hubert remained in northern Europe.
Six years later, the Emperor's Grand
Army regrouped for Armageddon.
Listen! All of you.
That wood stinks with Cossacks. l want some volunteers.
Listen!
Volunteers... All of you!
Volunteers! l'll come with you.
Pistols next time?
By tomorrow, we should be across the Niemen.
But l think we can risk a little celebration.
Schnapps?
Did you ever speak to Napoleon? l once delivered him an important message.
Did he say thank you? l suppose he did. lt was very noisy at the time.
Was it right to send him to Elba?
He couldn't share a palace with King Louis, could he?
- Why not?
- Gilles! Hilaire!
Go on.
How is your leg today?
Progress is slow.
Come. Sit and rest here.
There. l have plans for you.
Leonie, my life is yours. l want to be known as ''the old General who lives with his sister''.
That is exactly what l feared. lt is therefore my aim to see you married as soon as decently possible.
Keep quiet and pay attention.
The heiress from the estate across the river is a sweet child called Adele.
Her parents are dead and her uncle is a dear friend of mine. lt will be the easiest thing in the world to arrange and will suit you admirably. l know you're thinking she's an ugly girl who'll make you miserable. l assure you, she is far more beautiful than you deserve, and she will make you very happy.
You are at liberty to speak.
What colour is her hair?
Raven-coloured. l have no further questions at this time. l'm looking for the Chevalier de Rivarol.
General D'Hubert, l believe. l've not hitherto been privileged to meet a general of Bonaparte's army.
General of a brigade, sir.
And only recently promoted.
A mere imp of Satan, not one of his demons.
- You jest with me, sir.
- ln a neighbourly way.
Let me make you a pair of boots, in a neighbourly way. l would esteem it an honour.
Good boots are not an honour, they're a pleasure.
When you were learning to be a soldier, l was learning to make boots. l have supported myself as a bootmaker.
Now l'm an aristocrat once more, l have to drum up trade.
Sloth is the curse of the aristocracy.
The Chevalier found you vastly well-bred.
He said you had a very good leg. l sound like a horse. My God, l'm lucky he didn't look at my teeth! l do hate that swearing.
Don't you dare do it in front of Adele.
- Have you seen her?
- No.
Yes, you have. Don't sulk, you have! lsn't marriage-broking a little out of fashion?
Nothing sensible goes out of fashion.
They're all coming over tomorrow from Valmassique.
Meddle, meddle, meddle.
Nonsense.
General D'Hubert...
Mademoiselle de Valmassique.
Let me have a look at him.
A very handsome fellow.
They have golden eyes.
- And jewels inside their heads.
- So l believe.
Were l a young man again, rather than an old, lame creature, l'd ask you to marry me.
Well, don't you want to marry me now?
My dear, we both know what's expected of us, don't we? lf l were to neglect to make you a proposal, no blame would attach to you.
And l think perhaps you might be saved from a sad, dull life. lf you neglect to make me a proposal, my uncle will go mad.
Damn it, you are not on this earth to coddle your uncle. l have heard you swear most terribly.
Nonsense. l'm a temperate man.
Temperate in my speech... l love you.
Adele...
My dearest Adele. lt would make me very happy, happy beyond all expectation, if you would do me the honour to become my wife.
Yes.
- lt was a fiasco.
- Nonsense.
She accepted you.
- What else could she do?
- Nothing, l should hope. lt was a proper, settled arrangement.
Oh, Armand. ln marriage, events of that kind are not important.
A good marriage settles down quietly, like moss. l've never heard a bad word said about moss.
Moss! Leonie, an unkind plot has been laid against her.
Very well, if she's good and biddable, she'll settle down.
But it's not fair.
She's young. She has that magic.
You are in love.
- Yes, l'm in love.
- Well, then. l can't be bothered with you.
Go and play billiards.
No cheating.
Go and play billiards.
Surely, you will not turn down the opportunity of a brigade?
The Emperor is our hope and strength.
We belong to him. l have entertained the notion that l may belong to myself. lt has been said that you do not love the Emperor.
By whom?
By General Feraud.
He knows you well, l believe.
General Feraud has made attempts to kill me.
That doesn't mean he can claim my acquaintance. lt is also said he fought you in defence of the Emperor's honour.
That is impertinent trash.
You have my answer to Marshal
Grouchy. l shall write to confirm at once.
Good day.
Colonel, do you sometimes meet with General Feraud?
Now and again, sir.
Then ask him what the honour of the
Emperor has to do with Mme de Lionne.
Madame de Lionne? l think that was her name.
He should remember.
Tell him to drive on.
- Damn his impudence!
- That was the lady's name, sir.
Madame de Lionne.
Yes.
Get your backside off that table.
A fine, cultivated woman.
She had nothing to do with the Emperor. l do not believe the General was suggesting an illicit acquaintance between the Emperor and this woman.
Then what was he suggesting?
Well, what? Out with it.
Sir, l took him to imply that this lady, not the Emperor, was the prime cause of your quarrel. l have called him out half a dozen times.
The Cavalry knows it. Would l have done that for some such petty nonsense?
She was a lady l held in high esteem. Her salon was very well known in Strasbourg.
Yes, now l recall something else.
He said to me, in the public street, l have it burnt in my mind, he said, ''For all l care, they can spit upon Napoleon Bonaparte.''
- Who?
- They, they!
When did the Emperor not have enemies? D'Hubert's a turncoat.
And l say more, l say he never loved the Emperor. Never!
He saw a fair deal of campaigning.
When you meet him again, tell him l'll prove it, at the first opportunity.
To the Emperor. Good luck to him and to those that love him.
But in less than a hundred days,
Napoleon was defeated.
And l offer you another toast.
Let us give thanks for the safe return of His Sacred Majesty, Louis XVlll.
- God save the King.
- God save the King.
And the Devil take the Ogre to St Helena.
This side of the grave, it seems a fit and proper place for him.
Come, sir. You're a royalist now, like the rest of us.
Where else would you wish him to be?
One celebration at a time, sir.
Don't you think?
No, l do not. The boy's a royalist. l could give you more good news:
He has been summoned to attend upon
Marshal Saint-Cyr, in Paris.
He will have a command in the King's army.
So, tell us. What fate would you choose for the Ogre? l believe the Emperor chose his own fate. lt was his habit to do so. l learnt my trade in his service, as did Marshal Saint-Cyr.
The King's army will have more realists than royalists. l have just agreed to terms with this lady, and l'm much too tired for further questioning.
- Well done!
- Bravo!
Good day, Colonel.
- D'Hubert, isn't it?
- That's right.
You took care to play safe.
Very spruce you look, too.
Very tame and spruce.
Found a nice place with His Majesty?
Gabriel Feraud was right... Poor devil.
He always said you were a slippery fellow.
- How is General Feraud?
- You don't know? lt interests me very little.
And in fact l do not know.
Feraud was arrested.
They have him on the Butcher's list.
- He's before the Special Commission?
- Yes.
Now there was a man that would ride straight at anything.
Ends up at the mercy of that sewer rat...
...Fouche.
He's as good as dead.
Come a little closer, please. l'm all attention. l believe your Excellency has a list of officers to be tried for treason? l am the president of the commission that chose them, yes. l've come to petition that the name of
Gabriel Feraud be removed from that list. l have letters of introduction from
Marshals Saint-Cyr and MacDonald.
Do you, indeed?
By all accounts, he is a rabid Bonapartist.
So was every trooper and grenadier in the army, as your Excellency knows.
General Feraud hasn't the brains to make himself dangerous, rather he could not conceivably hurt the state.
He has a busy tongue.
He talked himself onto our list.
We could not keep him off it. l am something of a virtuoso in survival.
You will be aware of that, l think.
Besides, l despise these nobodies who offer their neck to the block.
The list is in my control. lf it were not, my own name would certainly be on it.
Our new masters and their ladies, bless them, are out for a deal of blood.
Please be seated.
You have an honest soldier's face, General, but...
...you have come here to intrigue with me, is that not so?
Have you not come here to intrigue with me? ls this fellow a relation of yours?
No.
- An intimate friend?
- No, not exactly.
We've had a...long association.
Most mysterious.
Still, you have two Marshals at your back.
Yes, there's your man.
Feraud, Gabriel Florian.
He will live in the provinces, under police supervision, you realise that, of course.
But he will live.
Take a pen, dear fellow. Cross out the name. l can't do everything!
Your Excellency, l beg you to keep my interference secret, particularly from General Feraud.
General Feraud, alive or dead, is not worth a moment's gossip.
There. Give me your hand.
Sir...kick for the General.
Perfect discipline.
That's not a grenadier.
Most ladylike, l assure you.
He's not kicking you.
General!
Fellow in the Cavalry, you called out several times. D'Hubert, wasn't it?
General D'Hubert, who has been on sick leave in the South, is to take command of the Fifth Cavalry Brigade at Rheims.
Same fellow, isn't it?
Good day.
- Good day.
- Good day.
Sir, l wonder, could you direct us to the residence of General Armand D'Hubert?
What do you want with him?
We want a quiet word, confidential you understand.
This place is quiet enough.
- You aren't the General, are you, sir?
- Yes, sir. l am.
Thought so.
Met you once, after Ratisbon.
All we need for the present are the names of your friends.
- What friends?
- We are friends of General Feraud.
We'll need to work pretty sharp: police surveillance.
They keep us bottled up at Vatan, damn their eyes.
Slip out, slip back. No one the wiser.
- Risky, but... Honour before everything.
- Honour first. l could have you both carted back where you come from in irons. l swear to God, l could only whisper, and you'd both be dead in a ditch before morning.
This is royalist country. This is my home.
We'd assumed that you were a gentleman.
Yes, damn you. Damn you, l am!
Very well, then.
We'd like to know the names of your friends. l have no friends stupid enough to take part in such a farce. l suppose, l could act for him.
He could act for you.
Not what you'd call a steady fellow.
Used to take a steady fellow to command a brigade. l don't suppose General Feraud would accept an apology?
Out of the question.
You could declare yourself unfit and resign your command, that might do. lt wouldn't do.
The General has received too deep an injury. l see. l will meet you, tomorrow at sunrise, here.
- Sabres, whatever you choose.
- Pistols.
Pistols?
Are you coming to bed now? l shall be late. l have some work to do.
My dear boy. l'm very sorry.
Did l disturb you?
No, l was awake. l promised these for tomorrow morning.
A tradesman has to keep his word.
- You ought not to tire yourself.
- l'm an old man. l wake at odd times, sleep at odd times. But you shouldn't be up.
- ls something the matter?
- No. l have work to do before morning, to keep my word.
- May l?
- Yes, do.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day to you.
- Poor ground, not suitable at all.
- lt will do.
We came here to kill each other.
Any ground is suitable for that. l suggest we enter the ruin from opposite sides, alone, and seek each other out.
Two shots each. Fire at will. ls it agreed? l'll consult the officer for General Feraud.
- Everyone heard me.
- Yes! l heard you.
Which side?
East side, General.
Forward.
Sir, l must own myself at a loss. l'm not fanatical enough to persevere in this absurdity.
Go on, kill me!
Now!
Now! ls he dead?
Where have you been?
- l was so worried!
- l'm sorry. l had to work late and... then l went for a walk.
What's in the bag?
You have kept me at your beck and call for 1 5 years. l shall never again do what you demand of me.
By every rule of combat, your life now belongs to me. ls that not correct?
Then l shall simply declare you dead. ln all dealings with me, you'll conduct yourself as a dead man. l have submitted to your notions of honour long enough.
You will now submit to mine.
Where you been, lad?
Bus goes in 15 minutes.
The farm. I had to get this back.
I'll want something to read.
Anyway, I'm, uh...
I'm all ready upstairs.
Your mother's up there.
What's the book?
- Oh, David Copperfield.
- You'll be lucky if you have time for reading.
I never did.
- Has he got everything?
- Of course, he doesn't need much.
- What do you mean, he doesn't need much?
- Well, they give him the rest... clothes, rations, you know.
He needs what I've given him.
Time for the bus, lad. You don't want to miss that train.
- Bye, Mum.
- Good luck, Son.
Let's go.
Move away from it, son.
Get back. Get back.
- Bring it out! Bring it out!
- Over against the wall.
There's somebody up there.
- Here we go.
- Get these hoses back! Get back! Get back!
All right, look out!
It's going! It's going!
Sorry, lad. You just missed it.
Go and get some sleep.
I'll finish here.
Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren... that this child is born again... and received into the family of Christ's church... let us give thanks unto Almighty
God for these benefits... and, with one accord, make our prayers unto him... that this child may lead the rest of his life according to this beginning.
Are you for the camp?
Hey, you!
- Are you for the camp?
- Yeah.
You're a bit late, son.
The others got in last night.
I know.
Got caught up in that air raid, eh?
- Yes.
- Oh, well, never mind, son.
You'll have to walk.
It's not many miles.
Put the case down.
- Name?
- Thomas Beddows.
Sir.
- Thomas Beddows, sir.
- You're late.
And... halt!
And... halt!
Who are you?
- Thomas Beddows, sir.
- Do I look like an officer?
- Forward, march!
- No, sir.
Don't call me "sir" then.
Who gave you permission to fall in?
- To what?
- To enter.
To come in the room. To open the door and make an entrance.
- No one.
- Get it right then.
Go back outside, knock.
And when I say "yes," come in and say, "Permission to fall in."
Go on.
Beddows.
Your case... take it.
Yes?
- Who are you?
- Beddows. Permission to fall in.
Come in, Private Beddows.
You can have that one.
Leave that.
You're late already.
Haircut's next.
You'll find the barbershop next to the company office.
- Next!
- Stand still. Stand still.
Stand still. Next.
Next. Name?
- Beddows, sir.
- Skinny, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
- Got a cough?
- No, sir.
- Okay. Clothes on over there.
- Next.
- Are you gonna stick that in me?
- Arm, please.
Feeling better, are you?
I don't like needles.
Is that all? I don't like the whole sodding army.
All recruits, form up by the door.
Into line. Get a move on!
Right! Abrahams, Arlott, Beddows!
Malcolm, Partridge, Silver, Young.
Right. Let's have a look at you.
Can you tell me what you've got there?
One pair of shorts, P.T.
One pair of drawers, cellular.
One balaclava. One pair of braces. One pair of boots.
Great coat, socks, vests, gaiters.
Webbing, packs large and small.
Battle dress, gas mask.
Mess tins, mug, knife, fork and spoon.
Anything else?
I don't think so.
What's this?
It's a pull-through.
You're learning.
Okay, all of you!
You're gonna keep this lot so clean it dazzles me, and you're gonna start now!
Let's get two things straight right away!
The first thing: The word of command, "Stand easy."
You will not move at all... until that word of command is given to you!
You will not fidget, move about or anything else!
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Corporal!
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Corporal!
Up! Wash! Shave! Get dressed!
Clean this barracks room, and I want it shining!
- One!
- Two!
- Three!
- Four!
- Five!
- Six!
- Seven!
- Eight!
- Nine!
- Ten!
- Eleven!
- Twelve!
The odd numbers, one pace forward!
Even numbers, one pace to the rear!
- March!
- One, two!
- Young, how many V.C.'s in the regiment?
- Four V.C.'s.
- Beddows, name of the regimental sergeant major.
- Regimental Sergeant Major Palmer.
- Right! Any questions?
- The regiment formed in 1685.
- Yes.
- What for?
I mean, was there any special reason?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
To impress the French!
Right. Let's have a look at what you been doing. Stand by your beds!
Right! Now, let's start all over again, shall we?
- Count!
- One, two, three! One!
Still! Perfectly still!
Form three ranks! Quick.
March! Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Rear. And fill over.
Right!
- Turn!
- One, two...
Get a hold of it now! Come along!
At arm level, by your right!
Look to your right!
Get your arm up.
Eyes... front!
- Beddows, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
What haven't you done, Beddows?
I seem to have neglected to blanco the belt underneath the buckle, sir.
- See to it next time.
- Yes, sir.
By the right! Quick march!
Left, right! Left, right! Now!
Squad!
- Halt!
- Left, one, two!
What are you bloody doing, Beddows?
Move back hard now!
Twist it! Twist it!
Spill his guts!
Come on! Come on! Keep your heads up!
- For fuck's sake, get between...
- Whoa!
Don't look down. Don't look down!
Bloody fool!
Come on! Come on!
Afraid to get your feet wet?
Keep those rifles dry!
Get up that bloody ladder!
Come on! What do you think this is, a picnic?
Come on! Get up, you silly sod!
Come on! You haven't finished yet!
Fuck. I need a fag.
They're ahead.
Well, you go on.
I'm stopping for a smoke.
- I hate this war.
- You'll get through.
No, it's not that.
It's me girl.
We was engaged, see, and... and then when orders come along, well... her old man wouldn't let me marry her.
Sod him.
Said we could wait till after we won the war.
Bastard.
He'd let the Jerries poke his wife if they as much as knocked on the door.
I wanted to fly.
Failed the medical.
Didn't know that.
- Who you got waiting for you, Tommy?
- Who have I got?
Well, there's Mum and Dad, I suppose.
And Tina.
Good for you, mate.
Let me guess.
She got brown hair, brown eyes... pale skin, nice tits, right?
Tina is a cocker spaniel.
- She's a lovely dog.
- A bitch?
Yeah. A bitch.
What are you gonna do when all this is over?
Oh, I don't know.
I've got me plans.
Garage, mate.
I'm gonna buy a garage somewhere and set up a scrap metal business on the side.
- How 'bout coming in with me, Tom?
- Hey. We ought to go.
Coming with me and the lads tomorrow?
We're celebrating... end of training.
Pub crawl in the afternoon, fleapit in the evening.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
What's the film?
Forget the picture, mate.
It's the women.
You get next to a nice piece in the back stalls, you'll be away before the titles come up.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
- They got at least 10 minutes on us.
- You think so?
No bleeding NAAFI for us tonight.
- I'm going down.
- What, down there?
Yeah.
Hey! Don't do it.
You'll kill yourself.
- Has he seen the M.O.?
- M.O. said he didn't need treatment, sir.
Prisoner and escort... about... turn!
Prisoner and escort, quick march!
Left, right! Left, right!
Prisoner and escort, halt!
Private Beddows, fall in!
At 0900 hours, you will parade at the main gate... where you'll get the transport to take you to your units.
You'll be back here by 2100 hours... or your mother won't recognize you by the time I'm finished with you.
Forget what I've told you, and you won't be around...
- Comfy, was it?
- to write me a thank-you letter after the war's over.
Making a signal, Beddows?
Only for "victory," Corporal.
This is Movietone.
Get down there! Get down!
- Hello, Jack.
- All by ourselves, are we?
You're a solitary sort of geezer, aren't you?
I felt like reading.
Christ, I wish this fucking war was over.
You spill your blood and guts to help the Belgians... and then four years later, you get ready to spill 'em again to help the fucking French.
And in between, you go paddling down on the south coast learning how to keep your bloody rifle dry.
It's a fucking mix-up, if you ask me.
I've been in His Majesty's bleeding forces four and a half years... seen active service, and now they want to send me back to bleeding battle school.
- You know what that means, don't you?
- No.
It means we'll be the first ashore when they do put on the sodding invasion, that's what.
Mmm.
- I suppose someone's got to go first.
- It's no fucking joke!
You will now be taken to the coast... where you will be joined by Allied Forces... and take part in combined exercises and assault training.
- Hi!
- We want to see you again, baby.
- Oh-ho! And you, soldier.
- Blow us a kiss, sweetheart.
- Good luck. Have a good time. Bye.
- I love your hat.
- How you doing? Let's have a quickie.
- Cheeky!
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Bye!
Disembark as quickly as possible.
Move up the beach and join your company.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep them moving, Sergeant!
Hold on to the rope!
Hold those rifles high and keep moving.
Move up the beach behind the flail tank.
Rise up, "C" Company!
You will remain in these positions... until you are instructed to hold tight to ram the beach.
- This is a bloody nightmare.
- I feel sick.
Watch out. We're going in.
Stand by to hit the beach.
Ah! Aha.
Right then, Tom. This is it.
Lots of lovely crumpet just waiting for it.
- Are you ready?
- Have you got any cigarettes?
Freeman's again. Here. Take 'em.
- Right. Fit?
- I'll follow you.
Okay.
Good evening. Early tonight, lads?
- Got any wine, have you?
- Wine?
- Two pints of brown ale then, please.
- Vintage?
Look around, my boy.
What do you see?
- Half the regiment.
- Yeah.
Ta.
How long you lads gonna be around here?
Oh, we're not gonna be around much longer.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You haven't got a drink.
- No.
- Can I... Can I get you one?
- No, thank you.
- Have you been here long?
- What, sitting in this chair, you mean?
No. Here, generally.
About as long as most people, I suppose.
Oh.
- And you?
- What?
How long have you been here?
Just arrived really.
But, um, I don't think I'll stay long.
- It's a bit dull, don't you think?
- What's dull?
- Dances, all this.
- I don't think dancing's dull.
- Oh?
- No.
Well, then let's...
Uh, will you have a dance with me, please?
- I don't mind if I do.
- Come on then.
- How you doing, Arthur?
- All right.
- Watch out.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not very good on my feet.
- Shall we stop then?
No. Let's go on, please.
Was that any better?
You're not as bad as all that.
Shall we go outside for a bit?
What for?
The rain's stopped.
All right.
- Is this your coat?
- Yes.
Have you seen any action?
Not really.
What do you mean, "Not really"?
Well, I've been on training.
That was tough.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Do you like it?
- What?
Being a soldier.
Not much, no.
Then why are you?
- A soldier?
- Mmm.
I was called up, like everyone else.
- Is that all?
- No.
It's gotta be done.
We gotta finish it off and pay out the ones who started it.
Yes.
I think you're very nice.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
I like you too.
I feel much better now.
I was quite... nervous when I first talked to you.
- It's funny.
- I know.
You thought the dance was awfully dull.
I didn't, really.
- No?
- No.
Can I kiss you?
If you want.
I've got to go now. I'm with my brother. He's in the band.
Well, when can I see you again?
Whenever you'd like.
Not tomorrow.
- Monday?
- Yes. I'd like that.
Here, at 6:00.
All right.
Will you walk me back to the hall?
Anywhere you'd like.
Back to the hall.
I wish I'd met you before.
There's so little time now.
What do you say that for?
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
You'll be back... and there'll be time.
Where are we going?
I've lost all sense of direction.
A game of musical bloody chairs, mate.
Thousands of us moving around from camp to camp... waiting for someone to shout, "Second front! Last one over's a Charlie!"
First one over's a
Charlie, if you ask me.
You'd think they'd have a bit of sympathy for us by now, wouldn't you? Send us by train.
A G.I. told me where to find sympathy.
It's in the dictionary between
"shit" and "syphilis."

Come on! Wake up!
Come on! Come on! Wake up, everybody!
Wake up! Look lively!
Come on! Move!
Fall in opposite the barbed wire!
You won't be doing any work. If you're wise, you'll take advantage of it.
Sorry about the tight security.
It means no wireless sets, newspapers or telephoning... and I'm afraid none of your letters will get posted until afterwards.
I'm sure all of you realize the importance of what lies ahead.
That's all for now.
All right, Sergeant-Major.
I thought you were meeting me tonight.
- I was called away.
- Why?
To fight the war.
- Couldn't you have told me?
- There was no time.
So you left me.
- There was no choice.
- Are you coming back?
Don't know.
Am I going to wait for you?
I don't know.
I do though.
Good-bye, Tom.
Please... don't go.
Fill in the form, please.
Name and address of next of kin.
If I get killed, they've already got a photograph.
It's for our records,
Private Beddows.
Oh.
Follow the sign outside, please, and get your anti-louse ware from the stores... if you haven't already.
God. How much more?
There's a will form...
B-2089... to fill in.
- What for?
- What do you think?
Cannon fodder.
That's what we are.
Die of boredom, die in battle.
What's the difference?
Did you hear what Tom did this morning?
No.
He went to see old Nickelby... and asked him if they gave out compassionate leave if there'd been a death in the family.
So Nickelby said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, depending on the circumstances."
And Tom said, "Well, there hasn't been a death in my family yet...
"but there's gonna be one very soon.
I request leave to go home and console my parents."
What did Nickelby do?
He sent Tom with a note to the M.O.
Oh, Tommy. He's nuts.
No, no. No, Tommy's not nuts.
He could do with a break.
Well, we could all do with a break.
It's been nothing but film shows, housey-housey... and lemonade in the bleedin'
NAAFI when the beer runs out.
- Ah.
- Ah!
They're for me.
Shit.
Don't tell me it's your birthday.
Yeah. Couple of days ago.
The mail was held up.
What's that?
- It's a key.
- That's a funny sort of birthday present.
- What's it for?
- What? It's a custom in our family.
You know, key to the door, coming of age, that sort of thing.
- You just 21?
- Yeah.
Happy birthday, kid.
- Plenty more of 'em.
- Thanks.
How about this, Jack?
Oh, that's nice.
I think I'll go and get some ink and write back to them.
- Can I have a look at your cards?
- Yeah, help yourself. See you later.
Army post office, England.
Dearest Mum and Dad.
Thank you very much for your letter and the presents, which have just arrived.
My fountain pen works very well, as you can see.
We're very cut-off here, as you can see from the address.
I don't know where we are, exactly.
It was so nice to hear from you.
You don't have to worry about me.
We are eating very well in this camp.
Although the beds are hard,
I'm getting plenty of sleep.
We all think the invasion can't be far off.
It's like being part of a machine which gets bigger and bigger... while we grow smaller and smaller until there's nothing left.
I wish I had some news.
Yesterday I saw a fox on the other side of the barbed wire.
And when we could still go out I went to see
This Happy Breed with Celia Johnson in it.
I thought it was terrific at the time... but I can't remember much about it now.
Seems so distant.
Everything outside the army and my mates here has faded away.
I must have done even more traveling in the last two weeks... than when I went to France on that school holiday.
But I couldn't tell you where we are or where we've come from.
All we do is sit in trucks and barracks, waiting for our bit of the war to start.
At any other time... your news about Tina would have left me unable to think of anything else.
But now it just seems part of the war... like everything else.
I was going to ask you to keep one of the puppies... but I don't think there's much point.
I don't think I shall live to see the end of this war.
It sounds silly... but this war has killed so many people already.
I'm just going to be another one.
Of that I'm sure.
I can feel it... the way you feel it when you're going to get a cold.
I didn't know whether to tell you.
I thought you shouldn't get one of those official letters... without knowing what was inside.
Please be brave.
I shall be all right.
I'm not frightened.
It is necessary to burn all personal letters and papers... or wrap them in the paper being issued to be sent home.
The choice is yours.
You will carry nothing except your pay book, part one, and Bible.
I've got nothing now.
I've thrown it all away.
I don't think I'm gonna get through this.
You'll be all right.
We'll get you through.
- I'm not walking through this lot.
- So much for the seaside.
♪ And I don't care for him ♪
♪ He can go and get another ♪
♪ That I hope he will enjoy ♪
♪ For I'm going to marry ♪
♪ A far nicer boy ♪
- Sing it again, Susannah.
- Please, Mommy.
Sing it right through once more, for the soldiers.

- Don't go, tommies.
Tommies, please don't go.
I think I'm gonna be sick again.
- Why didn't you become an officer, Jack?
- I failed the initiative test.
They locked me in a broken-down potting shed... and told me to imagine I was a prisoner trying to escape.
If I used that wall, I'd be shot. If I climbed that fence, I'd be electrocuted.
If I trod here, there, anywhere,
I'd be blown up by hidden mines.
I didn't move a fucking inch.
If they hadn't come and let me out,
I'd still have been in that shed... waitin' to become an officer.
This is it.
We're going in.
Well, Beddows, how many
V.C.'s in the regiment?
Five V.C.'s. Name of the commanding officer?
Lieutenant Colonel Hutchinson.
When was the regiment formed?
- Jesus Christ.
Names of all the birds Arthur's had since he joined the army.
- Belinda.
- Yeah.
- Mabel.
- Yup.
- Alice?
- Ah, she were mine first.
- Janey.
- Who's that?
Shall I show you how we prepare the dead?
Now bring me back.
Oh, Christ! He's hit! Tommy!
- Get him down!
- Get out of the bloody way!
Hold tight to ram the beachhead!
- Get out of the blasted way!
- Get out of the way, man!
Get down!
Jack, hold him! Hold him!
Hold him! Hold him!
Lay him down. It's all right.
I've got him. Lay him down.
- Easy. You'll be all right.
- Oh, God, he's dead.
Oh, fuck.
This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend
The end
Of our elaborate plans
The end
Of everything that stands
The end
No safety nor surprise
The end
I'll never look into your eyes
Again
Can you picture
What will be
So limitless and free
Desperately in need
Of some
Stranger's hand
In a
Desperate land
Lost in a Roman
Wilderness of pain
And all the children
Are insane
All the children
Are insane
Waiting for the summer rain
Yeah
Saigon.
Shit.
I'm still only in Saigon.
Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle.
When I was home after my first tour, it was worse.
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.
I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce.
When I was here,
I wanted to be there.
When I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle.
I'm here a week now.
Waiting for a mission...
getting softer.
Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.
And every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger.
Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah
Come on, babe, come on now
Livin' life, yeah
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah
Fuck, yeah, come on, baby
Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck
Oh, yeah, oh, fuck
Yeah, do it, yeah, come on
Yeah, all right
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Everyone gets everything he wants.
I wanted a mission...
and for my sins, they gave me one.
Brought it up to me like room service.
Captain Willard?
Are you in there?
Yeah, I'm comin'.
It was a real choice mission.
And when it was over,
I'd never want another.
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?
What does it look like?
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?
We have orders to escort you to the airfield.
- What are the charges?
- Sir?
- What'd I do?
- There's no charges, Captain.
You have orders to report to
Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.
- I see.
- All right?
- Nha Trang, for me?
- That's right.
Come on, Captain. You still have a few hours to get cleaned up.
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.
- Don't be an ass.
- Get a hold of him good.
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.
In we go.
Stand underneath this, Captain.
I was going to the worst place in the world...
and I didn't even know it yet.
Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river...
that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable...
plugged straight into Kurtz.
It was no accident that
I got to be the caretaker...
of Colonel
Walter E. Kurtz's memory-
any more than being back in Saigon was an accident.
There is no way to tell his story without telling my own.
If his story is really a confession-
- Captain Willard reporting, sir.
- then so is mine.
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.
- Stand at ease.
- General.
You want a cigarette?
No, thank you, sir.
- Have you ever seen this man before?
- No, sir.
- Met the general or myself?
- No, sir.
Not personally.
- You've worked a lot on your own?
- Yes, sir, I have.
Your report specifies intelligence... counterintelligence with Com-Sec, "I" Corps.
I'm not presently disposed to discuss those operations, sir.
Did you not work for the CIA in "I" Corps?
No, sir.
Did you not assassinate a government tax collector...
Quang Tri Province,
June 18, 1968?
Captain?
Sir, I am unaware of any such activity or operation- nor would I be disposed to discuss such an operation... if it did, in fact, exist, sir.
I thought we'd have a bite of lunch while we talk.
I hope you brought a good appetite, Captain.
I notice that you have a bad hand there. You wounded?
I had a little fishing accident on R and R, sir.
- Fishing on R and R?
- Yes, sir.
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?
Yes, General.
Very much so, sir.
Well, let's see what we have here, roast beef, and usually it's not bad.
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.
To save a little time, we might pass both ways.
Captain, I don't know how you feel about this shrimp... but if you'll eat it... you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way.
I swear, why don't I just take a piece here?
Captain, you've heard of
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?
Yes, sir,
I've heard the name.
Oh, Jesus! Operations officer,
Fifth Special Forces.
Luke, would you play that tape for the captain, please?
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.
October 9, 0430 hours, sector Peter, Victor, King.
These were monitored out of Cambodia.
This has been verified as Col. Kurtz's voice.
I watched a snail...
crawl along the edge of a straight razor.
That's my dream.
That's my nightmare.
Crawling, slithering...
along the edge...
of a straight razor...
and surviving.
Transmission 11, received
'68, December 30, 0500 hours.
Sector King, Zulu, King.
But we must kill them.
We must incinerate them.
Pig after pig.
Cow after cow.
Village after village.
Army after army.
And they call me an assassin.
What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?
They lie. They lie, and we have to be merciful...
for those who lie.
Those nabobs.
I hate them.
I do hate them.
Walt Kurtz was one of the most outstanding officers... this country's ever produced.
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.
And he was a good man, too, a humanitarian man.
A man of wit and humor.
He joined the Special Forces.
And after that his... ideas, methods... became... unsound.
Unsound.
Now he's crossed into Cambodia with this...
Montagnard army of his that worship... the man like a god... and follow every order, however ridiculous.
Well, I have some other shocking news to tell you.
Col. Kurtz was about to be arrested for murder.
I don't follow, sir.
Murdered who?
Kurtz had ordered the execution of some Vietnamese intelligence agents- men he believed were double agents.
So he took matters into his own hands.
Well, you see, Willard... in this war, things get confused out there.
Power, ideals, the old morality... and practical military necessity.
But out there with these natives... it must be a temptation to... be God.
Because there's a conflict in every human heart... between the rational and the irrational... between good and evil... and good does not always triumph.
Sometimes... the dark side... overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.
Every man has got a breaking point.
You and I have them.
Walt Kurtz has reached his.
And very obviously, he has gone insane.
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a navy patrol boat- pick up Col. Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba... follow it, learn what you can along the way.
When you find the colonel, infiltrate his team by- whatever means available and terminate the colonel's command.
Terminate the colonel?
He's out there operating without any decent restraint... totally beyond the pale of any acceptable... human conduct... and he is still on the field, commanding troops.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
You understand, Captain, that this mission... does not exist nor will it ever exist.
How many people had I already killed?
There were those six that I knew about for sure-
close enough to blow their last breath in my face.
But this time it was an American...
and an officer.
That wasn't supposed to make any difference to me...
but it did.
Shit. Charging a man with murder in this place...
was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.
I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do?
But I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him.
- Did you check the tank?
- Yeah.
I was being ferried down the coast in a navy PBR...
a type of plastic patrol boat- a pretty common sight on the rivers.
They said it was a good way to pick up information and move...
without drawing a lot of attention, and that was okay.
I needed the air and the time.
Only problem was
I wouldn't be alone.
Mornin', Captain.
The crew were mostly just kids-
rock and rollers with one foot in their graves.
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.
The machinist- the one they called Chef- was from New Orleans.
He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.
Probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans.
Lance, on the forward fifties...
was a famous surfer from the beaches south of L. A.
To look at him, you wouldn't believe he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.
Clean- Mr. Clean- was from some South Bronx shit-hole...
and I think the light and the space of Vietnam...
really put the zap on his head.
Then there was Phillips, the chief.
It might have been my mission, but it sure as shit was the chief's boat.
There's about two points where we can draw enough water... to get into the Nung River.
They're both hot.
Belong to Charlie.
Don't worry about it.
Don't smoke.
You know, I've pulled a few special ops in here.
About six months ago...
I took a man who was going up past the bridge at Do Lung.
He was regular army too.
Heard he shot himself in the head.
At first I thought they handed me the wrong dossier.
I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead.
Third-generation West Point, top of his class.
Korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations.
Et cetera, et cetera.
I'd heard his voice on the tape, and it really put the hook in me...
but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man.
Like they said, he had an impressive career.
Maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect.
He was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation-
general, chief of staff, anything.
In 1964, he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam...
and things started to slip.
His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff...
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.
Seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them.
During the next few months, he made three requests for transfer...
to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.
Airborne?
He was 38 years old.
Why the fuck would he do that?
1966, joins Special Forces...
returns to Vietnam.
Hey, what's that?
- Arc light.
- What's up?
- B-52 strike.
- Yeah?
- What's that?
- Arc light.
I hate that. Every time I hear that, something terrible happens.
Charlie don't never see 'em or hear 'em, man.
There they are.
Concussion will suck the air out of your damn lungs.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
Smoke! Secondary burning.
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.
Let's have a look, Chief.
It was the Air-Cav.
First of the Ninth-
That's them.
our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.
But they were supposed to be waiting for us another 30 kilometers ahead.
Well, Air Mobile.
Those boys just couldn't stay put.
Hey, kid, come on.
Get down. Come on.
First of the Ninth was an old cavalry division...
that had cashed in its horses for choppers...
and gone tear-assing around
'Nam looking for the shit.
They'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here.
What they were mopping up now hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.
Just keeping running by.
We're for television.
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep- Go on. Keep going.
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.
Just go by like you're fighting, like you're fighting.
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through.
Just go by. Keep on going.
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.
All right, come on. Go.
Right here. Yes.
Over here. Over here.
Where can I find the CO?
That's the colonel comin' down!
The CO's on that chopper.
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line back about 100 yards!
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!
Body cards!
- Sir?
- Bring my body cards!
Yes, sir!
I'm the Fourth Tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.
Captain Willard!
I carry priority papers from
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you... on the requirements of my mission.
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.
Sir, your unit is supposed to escort us into the Nung!
- We'll see what we can do.
- Colonel!
But just stay out of my way until this is done, Captain.
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.
A two of spades, three of spades, four of diamonds... six of clubs, eight of spades.
There isn't one worth a jack in the whole bunch.
Four of diamonds.
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!
- What?
- Death cards!
- Death?
- Lets Charlie know who did this.
- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you.
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!
This is an area that is controlled...
by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Jim.
We are here to help you.
- We extend a welcome hand...
- Come on.
- to those who would like to return...
- Everybody in?
to the arms of the South Vietnamese government.
Get in. Hurry up.
Move it out.
This is an area that is controlled...
by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Hey! What's this?
What is this?
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.
About the only thing that's holding his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.
Yeah? What do you have to say?
This soldier is dirty VC. He wants water. He can drink paddy water.
Get outta here!
Give me that canteen.
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to-
Get outta here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!
He killed a lot of our people!
Any man brave enough to fight with his guts... strapped on him can drink from my canteen.
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.
Yeah? Here.
Repeat. We have a body count.
We have-
What's your name, sailor?
- Gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
- Gunner's Mate Third Class-
- Lance Johnson, the surfer?
- Yes, sir.
It's an honor to meet you. I've admired your nose riding for years.
I like your cutback too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap.
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.
- This guy with ya?
- Yeah.
I want you to meet some guys.
- This is Mike from San Diego.
- Far out.
- Johnny from Malibu. Solid surfers.
- John, hi. Far out.
None of us are anywhere near your class though.
No way.
We do a lot of surfing around here.
I like to finish operations early.
Fly down to Yung Tau for the evening glass.
Been riding since you got here?
No way. I haven't surfed since I been here.
Through Christ, our Lord... from Whom all good things come... through Him in the unity of the Holy Spirit.
All glory and honor is Yours, Almighty Father.
Let us bring our iniquities to the Father... in the words our Savior gave us.
Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses...
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Kilgore had had a pretty good day for himself.
They choppered in the T-bones and the beer...
and turned the LZ into a beach party.
The more they tried to make it just like home...
the more they made everybody miss it.
Make my meat rare- rare but not cold.
Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.
He loved his boys, and you felt safe with him.
He was one of those guys that had that weird light around him.
You just knew he wasn't gonna get so much as a scratch here.
What happened to your mission?
Nha Trang forget all about you?
Airborne.
Sir, two places we can get into the river.
- Yeah.
- Here and here.
It's a pretty wide delta, but these are the only two spots I'm sure of.
That village you're pointing at is kind of hairy.
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy.
Got some pretty heavy ordnance.
I lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
What's the name of that goddamn village? Vin Drin-
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?
Damn gook names all sound the same.
Mike, you know anything about this point at Vin Drin Dop?
That's a fantastic peak.
- Peak?
- About six foot.
It's an outstanding peak. It's got both the long right and left slide... with a bowl section that's unbelievable.
It's just tube city.
Why didn't you tell me that before? A good peak.
There aren't any good peaks in this whole shitty country.
It's all goddamn beach break.
It's really hairy in there.
That's where we lost McDonald.
They shot the hell out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.
There's always a good offshore breeze in the morning.
We may not be able to get the boat in.
The draft at the mouth of that river may be too shallow.
We'll pick your boat up and put it down like a baby where you want it.
This is the First of the Ninth,
Air-Cav, son.
Air mobile! I can take that point and hold it as long as I like.
You can get anyplace up that river that suits you, young Captain.
Hell, a six-foot peak.
Take a gunship back to the division.
Lance, go with Mike and let him pick out a board for you.
Bring me my Yater Spoon, the eight-six.
- I don't know, sir-
- What is it, soldier?
It's hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.
Charlie don't surf!
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't gonna believe this. Look.
Hey, man!
They're pickin' up the boat!
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!
All right, son, let 'er rip.
Let's go!
I never have got used to a light board. I can't get used to one.
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.
- You prefer a heavy or light board?
- Heavier.
- Really?
- Yeah!
I thought all the young guys like lighter boards.
- You can't ride the nose on those.
- Big Duke Six.
This is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.
Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on heading two-seven-zero.
Assume attack formation.
That's a roger, Big Duke.
We're going in.
Hey, Lance, we'll come in low out of the rising sun.
About a mile out, we'll put on the music.
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.
Hey, they're gonna play music!
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?
So we don't get our balls blown off.
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on psy war op.
Make it loud. This is a Romeo
Fox Trot. Shall we dance?
Yes, sir!
- Come on!
- All right. Fire.
We got a couple- at that tree line.
We're taking fire from the holes.
Run, Charlie!
This should make everything burn.
We got a couple of people ahead here.
- What's going down here?
- We got an automatic! Shoot to kill!
- Shoot to kill in the open!
- I spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go down and check it out.
All right, this is Fox Trot.
We're pullin' in.
What a shot.
Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
Get you a case of beer for that.
Six-four-one-zero, we're over the village right now.
I see a vehicle in the courtyard.
I'm gonna check it out.
Well done, Hawks.
Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan along those tree lines.
Ripple the shit out of 'em.
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.
Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.
Don't these people ever give up?
Nice shot, Bill.
- Shit!
- All right, all right!
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get outta here!
Un-ass that shit.
Get it outta here!
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right.
- Everybody all right? Lance?
- I'm fine!
Get down!
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going.
We just got a secondary down there in the plaza.
Hold on to your position.
Duke Six, we've got wounded down there.
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.
- Please, God! Help me!
- Give him some morphine.
My God! Oh!
- Seven-four-two!
- Where's that duster?
I want my wounded out of there and in the hospital in 15 minutes.
I want my men out.
Somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke.
This is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in, throw 'em on and get out.
She's got a grenade!
She's got a grenade!
The whole thing blew up.
- She blew the shit-
- Fucking savages.
- Get a medevac.
- Holy Christ, she's a SAP.
I'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny. Roll that right skid right up her ass.
We gotta get some air in these trees.
It's goddamn eat-up with enemy down here.
I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over.
Three o'clock!
I'm drawing heavy fire!
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin' in.
My tail rotor's out.
I got control.
- What do you think?
- Wow! This is really exciting, man.
- No! No! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.
Look at that.
Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch.
Look! Good six-foot swells!
Come here, Lance.
Incoming!
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.
Come here! Come here!
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is. Go change.
It's still pretty hairy out there.
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.
That clear? Get going.
I'll cover for 'em.
And bring a board for Lance.
We can't do shit until the boat gets here.
Lance, I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.
- What?
- See how they break both ways?
One guy can break right, one left, simultaneous. What do you think?
We ought to wait for the tide to come up.
- Come here. Look.
- Incoming!
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!
You wanna wait here for six hours?
Yo! Chief! Chief!
Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on! Let's go!
- Dick-heads, take off!
- Goddamn it!
Don't you think it's a little risky for R and R?
If I say it's safe to surf this beach, it's safe to surf this beach!
I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fuckin' place.
Give me that R-T, soldier.
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.
Goddamn it!
I want that tree line bombed!
Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.
Blow them into the Stone Age, son!
- Out!
- No, back, no!
Let me take care of this.
Get that out of here!
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.
- No, ma'am. Sorry!
- Jimmy!
Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three.
They need some napalm in the tree line. Can you put it down there?
Right, One-Three. We're fixin' to fuck with 'em. What's the target?
We're trying to suppress some mortar fire off the tree line down there.
- Roger. Here we come.
- Good. Give it all you got.
Bring in all your ships.
Put him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.
No, no, no, you got to go with him.
Come on! Go! Go!
Get it outta here!
Tell my guys I want my board!
Big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three.
The jets are inbound now. You got about 30 seconds to bomb station.
Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.
Don't worry.
We'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.
Give me those shorts.
These are from the Air-Cav, a present from me and the boys.
I want to see you do your stuff in 'em out there.
You smell that?
- Do you smell that?
- What?
Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that.
Come on. Move it!
Move it! Move it!
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
You know, one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours.
When it was all over,
I walked up.
We didn't find one of them, not one stinking dink body.
But the smell-
You know, that gasoline smell.
The whole hill smelled like... victory.
Someday this war's gonna end.
- Lance! The wind!
- Huh?
- The wind!
- What?
It's blowin' onshore!
It's gonna blow this place out.
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!
It's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doin' it!
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel.
I'm afraid that does it.
The kid's got a reputation.
You can't expect him to surf those sloppy waves.
- I understand.
- I'm an artist, Bill.
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- I apologize. It's not my fault.
The waves are gettin' blown out by the napalm.
Don't get me wrong-
It was the bombs causing a vortex with the wind.
I accept your apology.
But if you could hang around 20 minutes-
- Some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes!
- I'm an artist.
- Keep walking.
Okay, give it a try, guys.
One goes left and one goes right.
Look, Lance.
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!
- Wanna say good-bye to the colonel?
- No.
- You sure?
- Yeah!
- Get the fuck outta here.
- It's the napalm.
Just wait 20 minutes!
Damn! Fuck!
They've been lookin' for ya.
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you goin'?
Here!
Incoming!
That's the colonel's surfboard!
Hey, get the fuck off me!
It's mine!
You fucking Airborne!
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.
Come on. Let's get high.
- Wanna smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.
Someday this war's gonna end.
That would be just fine with the boys on the boat.
They weren't looking for anything more than a way home.
- Captain?
- Trouble is, I'd been back there...
and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.
Buddha time. Here.
All right, that's great, you motherfuckers. Yeah.
If that's how Kilgore fought the war...
I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz.
It wasn't just insanity and murder.
There was enough of that to go around for everyone.
I mean, he never was hurtin' for pussy.
I'm not here. I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangos.
I meet Raquel Welch.
I make a nice mango cream pudding.
You know, kind of spread it around on us.
She's into mangos too.
She's like one limb above me.
- We're both in the jungle here nude.
- Hey, Chief.
- Yeah?
- Here comes that colonel guy again.
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
Just give me back the board, Lance.
It was a good board, and I like it.
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.
- He's a determined motherfucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
Just give me back the board, Lance.
It was a good board, and I like it.
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.
- I will not hurt or harm you.
- Jesus Christ.
That guy's too fuckin' much, man.
Do you think he would have shot us?
He wouldn't have shot us on the beach... but he would have shot us if he saw me taking his board.
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learnin' how
Let's get this board out of my turret.
Sucker.
How am I going to shoot him the next time he comes around?
Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board.
Sock it to me, Lance.
I wonder if that's the same chopper.
He's probably got them all over the river with that recording.
We'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief.
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.
What makes you say that?
You think that big Cav colonel wants everyone upriver... to know we stole his board?
I didn't steal it!
- Captain?
- Hmm?
Just how far up this river we goin'?
It's classified, Chief.
I can't tell ya.
We're goin' up pretty far.
Is it gonna be hairy?
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.
You like it like that, Captain, when it's hot, hairy?
Fuck.
Maybe you'll get a chance to know... what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangos now, okay?
- Take somebody with ya.
- Yeah, I'll take-
I'll go with him.
Chef?
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?
Yes, sir.
See, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier, a great saucier.
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.
Then, I was supposed to go to Paris... study at the Escoffier school.
But then I got orders for my physical.
Hell, I joined the navy.
Heard they had better food.
Cook school- that did it.
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't wanna hear about that.
They lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib.
All of us, you know, lined up lookin' at it.
Magnificent meat. Really!
Beautifully marbled.
Next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons- all of it- boiling it!
I looked inside, man.
It was turning gray.
I couldn't fucking believe that one.
That's when I applied for radioman school, but then they gave me-
What is it?
Charlie?
It's a tiger!
Son of a bitch!
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!
Battle stations.
Lance, up front.
- Get on your 60!
- Got it.
- Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger!
- Chef, come on!
- Captain, come on!
- Let's hop in and go!
Let's go!
You were right.
Never get out of the boat.
- Bring that 60 forward!
- Why never get out of the boat?
I gotta remember!
Never get out of the boat!
Never get out of the boat!
- How many is it?
- A fuckin' tiger!
- What?
- A tiger?
Yes! I've had it! I've had the whole goddamn fuckin' shit, man!
You can kiss my ass on the county square... because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.
I didn't come here for this.
I don't fuckin' need it!
I don't want it.
I didn't get out the goddamn eighth grade for this kind of shit!
All I wanted to do was fuckin' cook!
I just wanted to learn to fuckin' cook, man!
- You're all right.
- What happened, bro?
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.
All right?
It's gonna be all right?
Never get out of the fuckin' boat.
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger!
Good-bye!
Never get out of the boat.
Absolutely, goddamn right...
unless you were going all the way.
Kurtz got off the boat.
He split from the whole fuckin' program.
How did that happen?
What did he see here that first tour?
Thirty-eight fucking years old.
If you joined the Green Berets...
there was no way you'd ever get above colonel.
Kurtz knew what he was giving up.
The more I read and began to understand...
the more I admired him.
His family and friends couldn't understand it...
and they couldn't talk him out of it.
He had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit.
But when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him.
The next youngest guy in his class was half his age.
They must have thought he was some far-out old man...
humping it over that course.
I did it when I was 19.
It damn near wasted me.
A tough motherfucker.
He finished it.
He could have gone for general...
but he went for himself instead.
Dear Eva...
Today was really a new one.
Almost got eaten alive by a fuckin' tiger.
Really un-fucking believable, you know?
We're taking this guy,
Captain Willard, up the river... but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him.
Come on, baby
Thought you might have heard by now from Elwood.
October 1967.
On special assignment...
Kontoom Province, II Corps.
Kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces.
Rated a major success.
He received no official clearance.
He just thought it up and did it.
What balls.
They were gonna nail his ass to the floorboards for that one.
But after the press got a hold of it...
they promoted him to full colonel instead.
Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam.
You needed wings to stay above it.
This sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of this shit.
Expecting us this time?
Damned if I know.
Hello. Hello.
Jesus-
Wow.
- It goes back up into the truck.
- What?
We gotta get all that stuff up.
Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef?
I bet you we can score up here.
Check out the bikes, Lance.
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, Sukiyaki.
Yeah, man.
This is something.
- Please!
- This must be the guy.
Right over there.
Sergeant. Sergeant.
Three drums of diesel fuel,
PBR five-
Come on, man! Move!
We don't have time. One hour.
That's all. What do you want?
- Can I get some Panama Red?
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.
- Sergeant?
- Destination?
I don't have no destination.
I can't do a goddamn thing without a destination.
- Sarge? Sarge?
- I need a destination!
I can't do a thing about it with a destination.
These guys are with me.
Destination's classified.
I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence.
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen, it's a real big night.
Eight bucks for that-
Hey!
All right. Damn.
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.
Just take this over to the man at the supply desk and you got it.
Would you guys like some seats- some press box seats for the show?
The show out here.
- Bunnies, bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?
You got it.
You gonna be here?
Hey, listen, Captain, on the house.
No hard feelings, huh?
How ya doin' out there?
I said, how ya doin' out there?
Wanna say hello to you from all of us up here...
to all of you out there who work...
so goddamn hard in Operation Brute Force!
Hello, all you paratroopers out there!
And the marines!
And the sailors!
We wanna let you know that we're proud of you!
We know how tough and how hard it's been.
To prove it we're gonna give you entertainment you're gonna like.
Miss August,
Miss Sandra Beatty.
Miss May,
Miss Terri Teray! Yeah!
And the playmate of the year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!
Yo! Whoa!
Oh, Susie-Q
Oh, Susie-Q
- Oh, Susie-Q, baby, I love you
- Hello!
Susie-Q
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Susie-Q
Oh, Susie-Q
Oh, Susie-Q
Oh, Susie-Q
Baby, I love you
Susie-Q
I love you!
- Come on!
- What's the matter?
Come on, baby!
Grease my gun!
I'm ready to powwow, baby!
Come on! All right!
You're cute. I like you.
I'm here, baby! I'm here!
Yeah!
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!
Take it off!
Hey, lover!
You want us to come over!
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!
Sign my centerfold!
Come on, baby!
Goddamn!
Start her up. Hey!
Get out of my way!
Come on!
- Will you sign these?
- Let's go! Let's go!
Hurry!
So long!
Charlie didn't get much USO.
He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.
His idea of great R and R was cold rice and a little rat meat.
He had only two ways home-
death or victory.
No wonder Kurtz put a weed up Command's ass.
The war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns...
who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away.
Hey, you know, man, that was far-fucking-out.
I collected every picture of her since she was Miss December, Chief.
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.
You can really get hung up on these broads, man... just like that cat in the delta.
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?
The one that went up for murder.
He was an army sergeant.
Remember? This cat, man-
He really dug his Playboy, man.
Dig it.
When the thing arrived, he was there to meet it, man.
Look at these beautiful fuckin' jugs, man!
Yeah, so anyway, he was workin' ARVN patrols.
One of them cocky gook asshole lieutenants and shit-
One day the gook took his magazine and wouldn't give it back.
He said, "Give me my magazine back."
Gook say, "You shut up.
I have you court-martialed."
- Typical fuckin' ARVN.
- Yeah!
- Then the gook starts to go too far.
- Chef. Take the wheel.
This dude started to stick pinholes in the lady's tits.
Take the wheel.
He started sticking pinholes and mutilating the centerfold.
The sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.
You leave your shitty little gook hands off of that girl.
Don't do her like that."
- Gook say "Fuck you" in Vietnamese.
- Damn.
The sergeant couldn't handle it no more.
He just picked up his iron... flipped it to rock and roll and-
Boom!
Gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag.
It blew his ass clean off of the dock.
There wasn't no more lieutenant that day. That was it for his ass.
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.
They stuck his ass in the LBJ.
It's too bad he didn't get no medals or nothin'.
Fuckin' ARVN, man.
They should have killed the fuck.
Should have given the fucker a Silver Star.
Bummer for the gook though, ain't it?
Good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist
Zack Johnson on AMVN.
It's about 82 degrees in downtown
Saigon right now, also very humid.
We have an important message for all GI's...
who are living off base from the mayor of Saigon.
He'd like you to hang your laundry up indoors...
instead of on the windowsills.
The mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful.
Now here's another blast from the past going out to Big Sam...
who's all alone out there with the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry...
and dedicated by the fire team to their groovy CO.
- The Rolling Stones, "Satisfaction."
- All right!
Watch out, Clean!
Get down, bubba!
I can't get no
Satisfaction
Hang on, Lance!
I can't get no
Satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try
- Get down, bubba!
- And I try and I try
I can't get no
I can't get no
Yeah!
When I'm drivin' in my car
- And the man comes on the radio
- Tell 'em you did it, Lance.
He's tellin' me more and more
- I see you is right on target.
- About useless information
- Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- All right!
Look out, Lance!
That's what I say
"Commitment and
Counterinsurgency...
by Col. Walter E. Kurtz.
As long as our officers and troops perform...
tours of duty limited to one year...
they will remain dilettantes in war and tourists in Vietnam.
As long as cold beer, hot food, rock and roll...
and all the other amenities remain the expected norm...
our conduct of the war will gain only impotence.
We need fewer men, and better.
If they were committed, this war could be won...
with a fourth of our present force."
Shit. Chicken time.
You ain't shittin', bro.
They're motherfuckin'.
Who is that?
Is that you, Lazzaro?
Don't chicken out.
Lazzaro!
Come on!
- Fire on the canopy!
- I got it! Get outta there!
Yeah! I got it!
I got it! I got it!
Lance, get down!
Put that fucker out, man!
What the fuck they think they're doin'?
Late summer, autumn 1968.
Kurtz's patrols in the highlands coming under frequent ambush.
The camp started falling apart.
November.
Kurtz orders assassination of three Vietnamese men and one woman.
Two of the men were colonels in the South Vietnamese army.
Enemy activity in his old sector dropped off to nothing.
Guess he must have hit the right four people.
He joined the Special Forces.
After that his-
The army tried one last time to bring him back into the fold.
- methods-
- If he'd pulled over...
- it all would have been forgotten.
- unsound.
But he kept going.
- Now he's crossed into Cambodia-
- He kept winning it his way.
- with this Montagnard army of his-
- And they called me in.
Man like a god and follow every order, however ridiculous.
They lost him.
He was gone.
Nothing but rumors and random intelligence...
mostly from captured VC.
The VC knew his name by now, and they were scared of him.
He and his men were playing hit-and-run...
all the way into Cambodia.
I know what I'm doin'.
I'm goin' to the White House to have dinner... with the president of the United States.
That's where I'm goin'.
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.
Clean.
How long has that kid been on this boat?
Seven months.
He's really specializing in busting my balls.
Very possible, Captain, he thinks the same of you.
- Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
- I don't think.
My orders say I'm not supposed to know where I'm taking this boat... so I don't!
But one look at you, and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.
We're going upriver about
75 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia, but that's where I'm going.
You just get me close to my destination... and I'll cut you and the crew loose.
All right, Captain.
"Dear Son...
I'm afraid that both you and your mother will have been worried...
at not hearing from me during the past weeks...
but my situation here has become a difficult one.
I have been officially accused of murder by the army.
The alleged victims were four Vietnamese double agents.
We spent months uncovering them and accumulating evidence.
When absolute proof was completed, we acted- we acted like soldiers.
The charges are unjustified.
They are, in fact, and in the circumstances of this conflict...
quite completely insane.
In a war, there are many moments for compassion and tender action.
There are many moments for ruthless action-
what is often called ruthless...
but may in many circumstances be only clarity-
seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it-"
- Medevac, come in.
- "directly-
- quickly, awake."
- Alpha, Tango, Tango, Echo, Tango, Alpha.
- "Looking at it."
- Request dust-off.
Three, maybe four KIA's. Over.
"I trust you to tell your mother what you choose about this letter.
As for the charges against me,
I am unconcerned."
Medevac, come in.
"I am beyond their timid, lying morality, and so I am beyond caring."
Medevac, do you read? Over.
"You have all my faith.
Your loving father."
Jesus.
No wonder I couldn't get 'em on the radio.
What a dump.
- Hi there!
- How ya doin'?
Wow. That's a nice little boat you got there.
Never seen one up here before.
We called in a request for Medevac. You receive it?
Medevac? No.
We passed a downed Huey with some KIA's.
- On your way here?
- Yeah.
- You goin' up this river?
- Way up.
- Way upriver? Forget it.
- Why?
We want to send some people downriver.
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.
- Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?
Why don't you see what you can do with that engine?
- I'm gonna look around.
- All right.
Hey, don't leave without me.
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
Don't ask me, man.
Give my clothes back, you asshole!
Asshole!
Hey, guys, where's the CO?
He stepped on a land mine about two months ago. He got blown to hell.
- Who's in charge here?
- Charge?
I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.
Just do what I'm told. Shit.
I'm just a working girl.
What about you, fella?
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam. You mark my words.
- Keep it in that condition-
- Get off my back!
- No, man, I'm telling you-
- Lay off!
Hey! Hey! Come here!
Is that your boat?
Come on inside.
What do you want?
Come on inside.
I want to talk to you. Come on!
Get out of the rain.
Get off me!
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.
Hey, how ya doin', Captain?
I want you to meet some people.
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit.
Chef, your ass is shit!
You're a motherfucker, man.
Goddamn, my ear, you motherfucker!
- Get him off me, Chef.
- You smart-ass.
Hey, guys.
I got you!
I got your ass!
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas.
- You pulled my fuckin'-
- Hey, guys.
I just made a deal with the people from Hau Phat.
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for a couple of hours with the bunnies.
Whoa. Whoa. Captain!
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of barrels and get up to that big tent.
Come on!
Captain.
You're giving away our fuel for a playmate of the month?
Nope, playmate of the year, Chief.
Warm 'em up, baby!
Warm 'em up!
Captain, we get in a fire fight and run out of fuel...
I want you to tell me how she was.
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?
Forget it, Captain.
I'll stay with the boat.
Hey, Captain!
Give me a hand.
You know, I got a-
I got every one of your pictures.
I got the centerfold, the playmate's review... the playmate of the year runoff.
I even got the calendar.
Hey, oiseau.
How come you got a bird?
I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.
- Busch Gardens?
- I used to train birds there.
You are-
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.
Is it coming?
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.
He's not one of my regular birds.
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.
Being playmate of the year... is the loneliest experience
I can imagine.
It's like-
You try to express... your feelings to someone and show them your heart-
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.
But would you mind just puttin' this-
Would you just mind putting this black wig on for me, please?
And there's this glass wall between you- this invisible glass.
They can see your mouth moving.
I used to train birds for at least two years-
- That's beautiful.
- at Busch Gardens.
This was cascading over your right shoulder. This was open here.
But they can't hear what you're saying.
I used to train them to stand on their head and ride a bicycle-
Your right hand was-
Hey, Chef!
- Get outta here, man!
- Come on!
- Does he want to talk to you?
- Later. Give me 15 minutes.
You can never really make them hear what you're trying to say.
You okay with kind of bending?
That's it.
Your ass was sticking out just a little- Hey, man, fuck off!
Fifteen minutes!
That's why I tried so desperately... to show somebody that I had some talent.
Little baby macaws.
- Have you ever seen a baby macaw?
- That's kind of open there.
- They're all blue-
- Take off, would you?
I got my rights, man!
They make you do things you don't wanna do- like, this picture here.
I started feeling repulsed with myself.
You were just kind of bending forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.
- I love training birds.
- That's it.
That's it. That's very-
That's it. Voila.
You're beautiful.
I just want to-
You know, I can't believe it.
Me, J. Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Maybe I'm unfit to have a relationship... with a beautiful, innocent boy.
Just think, if it hadn't been for the Vietnam War...
I never would have met you,
Miss December.
Miss May.
I wish-
I wish I could find... just one person... that could share my point of view.
Oh, you kiss like a bird!
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me!
Who is that?
- You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me!
- I love birds!
You finished yet?
Oh! Fuck!
Like a bird!
Take me like a bird!
Fly, baby! Cock it to me!
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!
- Fly like an eagle!
- It drives me crazy!
It drives me crazy!
Lance, that was somebody's son.
Lance, there were things that they made me do... that I didn't want to do.
They said, "Pull the ribbons between your legs."
I didn't want to do it.
But they said that was what was expected of me... that that's what people wanted to see.
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm next, ma'am.
Ha, ha! Hell,
I didn't know it was a cherry.
- Didn't know you never got no pussy.
- Shove it, fuckup.
Sorry about that. If I'd have known, I'd take you to New Orleans.
- Man, fuck you.
- Introduce you to-
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy, cherry boy.
You're a fuckin' dog!
Come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.
Lay off, Chef.
You're the only fuckin' prick
I see around here.
If I wanna play with a prick,
I'll play with my own.
Lay off!
What are you gonna do with it, cherry boy?
Chef, I said lay off!
Chef, knock it off! Give him a break! What do you think I said?
Then give your jaws a rest!
This ain't the army.
You are a sailor!
So get out of that frizzly army-looking shirt... and stop smoking that dope!
You hear me?
Lance, what's with all the green paint?
- Camouflage.
- How's that?
So they can't see ya.
They're everywhere, Chief.
I want you to stay awake up there, man. You got a job to do.
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.
Let's take a look. Lance.
Bring them in.
Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 16.
Clean, get on that 60!
What's up, Chief?
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.
Well, let's forget routine now and let 'em go.
These boats are running supplies in this delta, Captain.
I'm gonna take a look.
My mission's got priority.
You wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it wasn't for me.
Until we reach your destination,
Captain, you're just on for the ride.
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.
Come on!
Hurry up, motherfucker!
Can couc, you too.
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.
- I got you, Chief.
It's clear, Chief.
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.
- Board and search it.
- It's just a fuckin' boat.
- There ain't nothin' on it.
- Board it and search it.
Just some baskets and some ducks, fuckin' bananas.
- Ain't nothin' on it.
- Chef?
- What's wrong? Search it.
- There's the goat and some fish.
- Chef!
- Fuckin' vegetables-
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothin' on it, man!
- Get on it!
- All right!
Move it, asshole!
Goddamn it!
Just some pigs! Look, mangoes!
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fuckin' rice!
- Look in there!
- Some fuckin' fish!
More coconuts.
Rice. Here's rice.
- What's in that vegetable basket?
- Get out of here!
Come on!
Check that vegetable basket!
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!
- There ain't nothin' in here!
- What's in the boxes?
- Look in that rusty can.
- Nothing!
Just fuckin' rice!
There ain't nothin' on it!
Check the yellow can!
She was sittin' on it. What's in it?
Chef!
Motherfuckers!
Motherfuckers!
- Hold it!
- Come on! Let's kill them all.
- Motherfucking cocksuckers mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit outta all of 'em.
- Hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.
Why the fuck not?
- Clean?
- I'm good.
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding!
- You all right?
- See what she was runnin' for?
It's a fuckin' puppy.
It's a fuckin' puppy.
Give me that dog!
- Give me that dog!
- No! You're not gonna get it!
- Give it to me!
- Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole!
Fuck you! Fuckin' mango too!
- Chef-
- You want that?
She's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.
Chef! She's moving behind you.
Check her out!
All right. All right.
Come on, Clean! Goddamn it!
She's not dead. She's wounded.
Give him a hand.
Just take it easy.
Take it easy!
- Slow down and take it easy.
- Chef, wait a minute.
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing?
She's hurt. She's bleedin'.
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.
- What are you talking about?
- We're taking her to some friendlies.
- She's wounded. She's not dead.
- Get out of there.
The book says-
Fuck you. Fuck 'im.
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.
It was a way we had over here of living with ourselves.
We'd cut 'em in half with a machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid.
It was a lie.
And the more I saw of them...
the more I hated lies.
Those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again...
but I felt like I knew one or two things about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier.
Do Lung Bridge was the last army outpost on the Nung River.
Beyond it, there was only Kurtz.
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.
Huh? What's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.
Hey, you know that last tab of acid I was saving?
- I dropped it.
- You dropped acid?
Far out.
Friendly!
Friendly! Friendly!
Take me home!
Goddamn it!
- Fucking shore police! Shit!
- Man, you wanna die?
Don't keep goin'!
- You fuckin' police!
- Don't leave me!
Fuck you!
You'll get what you deserve!
Is there a Captain Willard on board?
- Yeah.
- Captain Willard?
- Yeah. Who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.
Get that light off me!
I was sent here from Nha Trang with these three days ago, sir.
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.
- Don't know how happy this makes me.
- Why?
Now I can get out of here, if I can find a way.
You're in the asshole of the world, Captain.
Captain, where you going?
See if I can find some fuel and get some information.
Pick me up at the other side of the bridge.
Somebody go with him. Chef.
I'll go.
I wanna go.
Man, listen to the music, man.
Where can I find the CO?
You came right to it, son of a bitch!
Get down here!
You still got a commanding officer here?
- Beverly Hills.
- What?
Straight up the road, there's a concrete fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!
Where the fuck else do you think it would be?
- Goddamn it! You stepped in my face.
- I thought you were dead.
Well, you thought wrong, damn it!
I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I?
You think you're so bad, huh, nigger?
What are you shooting at, soldier?
What the fuck ya think I'm shootin' at?
I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks out there by the wire.
But I think I killed them all.
You ain't shot shit. Listen.
Oh, shit. He's trying to call his friends. Send up a flare.
Think you so bad, huh, nigger?
You think you bad, huh?
They're all dead, stupid.
There's one still alive underneath them bodies.
Who's the commanding officer here?
Ain't you?
You think you so bad?
I got something for your ass now, nigger! I got something for you now!
He's underneath the bodies, man.
Go get the Roach for me.
Go get the Roach, nigger!
Go get the Roach.
Roach. Roach.
Got slopes on the wire, man.
You hear 'em?
Do you hear 'em?
Fuck you, GI!
We'll bust 'em!
Hey, GI, fuck you!
Fuck you, GI!
Fuck you, GI!
Hear him out there on the wire, man?
- I kill you, GI!
- You need a flare?
He's close, man.
He's real close.
Fuck you, GI!
I kill you!
Fuck you, GI!
GI, fuck you!
GI! GI-
Motherfucker.
Hey, soldier.
Do you know who's in command here?
Holy shit.
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys just got blown off that bridge.
You hang on, man.
You're gonna be okay.
- What's that?
- Mail, man. Mail.
Later on the mail.
Watch them trees.
There's no diesel fuel, but I picked up some ammo.
Let's move out.
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.
Let's just get goin'.
Which way, Captain?
You know which way, Chief.
You're on your own, Captain.
Still wanna go on?
It's like this bridge.
We build it every night, Charlie blows it right back up again... just so the generals can say the road's open.
Think about it.
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!
Chef, on the bow.
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go!
You got one, Miller.
Geez, I got some too.
Whose package is that?
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit? Wait a minute.
- Is that it?
- That's it for you. Lance.
Mr. L. B. Johnson, there you go.
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waitin' for this one.
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.
"Lance.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."
Man, I wanna get back to Antoine's.
"I remember the time we went up to-"
How could I fucking forget? Beautiful.
"There could never be a place like Disneyland, or could there?
Let me know."
Jim, it's here.
It really is here.
"There has been a new development regarding your mission...
which we must now communicate to you.
Months ago, a man was ordered on a mission which was identical to yours.
We have reason to believe that he is now operating with Col. Kurtz.
Saigon was carrying him MIA for his family's sake...
but they assumed he was dead.
Then they intercepted a letter he tried to send to his wife."
Captain Richard Colby.
He was with Kurtz.
Disneyland.
Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.
"Charles Miller Manson ordered the slaughter of all in the home... anyway as a symbol of protest."
That's really weird, ain't it?
- Purple haze. Look, man.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Rainbow reality, man.
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.
She pictures me at home having a beer watching TV.
Hey, Lance, man.
Oh, hot potato, hot potato.
I'm so glad you decided to join the navy.
Eva's not sure she can have a relationship with me, you know.
Here I am,
13,000 fucking miles away... trying to keep a relationship with my ass.
That's much more than I can say for some of your friends.
If this tape is any good...
I will have Dad and the family send you a tape of their own.
Fuckers!
There! Over there!
Motherfuckers!
There. Over there!
Chef, check out Clean!
Captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.
Where'd the dog go?
Lance! Lance!
They got Clean.
Where's the dog?
We gotta go back and get the dog.
Hey, Clean. Hey.
Hey, bubba.
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!
Hey, bubba.
And so I'm hoping that- pretty soon- not too soon-
but pretty soon I'll have a lot of grandchildren to love and spoil.
And then when your wife get 'em back, she'll be mad with me.
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama...
will come to celebrate your coming home.
Granny and Dad are trying to get enough money to get you a car...
but don't tell 'em because that's our secret.
Anyhow, do the right thing...
stay out of the way of the bullets...
and bring your heinie home all in one piece...
because we love you very much.
Love, Mom.
Hold on.
Throw me the glasses.
Lance, take a 16 on the bow.
Chef. Chef.
On the 60.
Fuck me.
Cover the captain. Lance.
Cover the captain.
They're French.
They're French.
Pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Stand fast. Captain.
All right, you men.
Put down your weapons.
We lost one of our men.
We French always pay respect to the dead of our allies.
You're all welcome.
My name is Hubert DeMarais.
This is my family's plantation.
It has been such for 70 years.
And it will be such until we are all dead.
Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller... on behalf of a grateful nation.
This food is really wonderful, isn't it? The wine, the sauces.
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?
The chef speak only Vietnamese.
No kidding? He cooks like this and he can't even speak French?
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.
This is Baudelaire.
It's a very cruel poem for children.
But they need it, 'cause life sometimes is very cruel.
As you can see.
Attack repels by the family.
Just for this war.
Vietcong, 58.
North Vietnamese, 12.
South Vietnamese, 11.
Americans, six?
Yes. Well, there were perhaps mistakes.
May I present Captain Willard.
He is of a paratroop regiment.
Madame Sarrault.
Captain.
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
It was just a little story... about Paris and people starving during the war.
They are all around the table, and there was a silence and somebody say...
"An angel is passing by."
So somebody said,
"Let's eat it."
Oh.
How long can you possibly stay here?
We stay forever.
No, no. I mean... why don't you go back home to France?
- Back home?
- I mean, this is our home, Captain.
Sooner or later, you're-
You don't understand our mentality- the French officer mentality!
At first, we lose in Second World War.
I don't say that you
Americans win, but we lose.
Oh, Papa-
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Algeria, we lose.
In Indochina, we lose!
But here we don't lose!
This piece of earth, we keep it.
We will never lose it.
Never!
You Americans.
In 1945, yeah... after the Japanese war, your President Roosevelt... didn't want the French people to stay in Indochina.
So... you Americans implant the Vietminh.
What's he mean?
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong were invented by the Americans.
The Americans?
And now you take the French place... and the Vietminh fight you.
And what can you do?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.
The Russian ones who help them,
"Come and give us their money.
We are all Communists. Chinese, give us guns. We are all brothers."
They hate the Chinese!
Maybe they hate the American less than the Russian and the Chinese.
I mean, if tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists... they will be Vietnamese Communists.
And this is something that you never understood, you American.
I don't know.
Maybe in the future we can make something with the Vietminh.
Don't you understand?
The VC say,
"Go away. Go away."
That's finish for all the white people in Indochina.
If you're French, American, that's all the same.
"Go." They want to forget you.
Look, Captain.
Look, this is the truth.
An egg.
The white left... but the yellow stays!
When I was in Saigon,
I spoke to an American politician.
He explained it very well.
He said, "Look.
Yesterday, it was Korea.
Today, Vietnam.
Tomorrow, Thailand, the Philippines... then maybe Europe."
Come on. Why not Europe?
Look what happened in Czechoslovakia recently.
Even before Second World War Americans knew exactly what was going on.
They don't want that shit to take over! LeFevre!
All you white people are shit.
They are fighting- fighting for freedom.
Freedom? Bullshit.
French bullshit.
American bullshit.
Dien Bien Phu, that serious.
All soldiers know they are already dead.
You know anything about Dien Bien Phu?
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't.
- Not really.
- Dien Bien Phu was an error.
A military mistake.
A mistake?
A voluntary mistake!
Voluntary!
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.
The generals and the colonels believe it's impossible for the Viets... to get the cannon up there in the mountains.
But they do. Then they wait for the rain to come.
When it comes, no airplane can fly there.
And our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
I mean, you know,
90 meters- 70 meters.
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.
And they only do that to be dead with their friends.
The French Army was sacrificed.
Sacrificed by the politicians safe at home.
They put the army in an impossible situation where they couldn't win.
The students are marching in Paris... protesting, demonstrating.
They stab the soldiers in their back.
The soldier would open the grenade, it wouldn't work.
A piece of paper would fall-
"Union of French Women."
"We are for the Viets."
Traitors!
Communist traitors at home.
Dien Bien Phu, okay.
The French is shit, huh?
No one care.
No one want-
Why don't you Americans learn from us, from our mistakes?
Mon Dieux, with your army, your strength... your power, you could win if you want to!
You can win.
You know, I'm sure we can make something here.
I'm sure about it, you know?
I never do something wrong to the people here.
That's right, but the Communist at home have never been traitors.
- Communist!
- Socialist!
Capitaine, good night.
He was a Socialist, you know.
We can stay. I know that we can stay. We can.
You know, we always helped the people.
We work with the people.
So we can be friends, we are agreed.
See, Captain, when my grandfather... and my uncle's father came here... there was nothing- nothing.
The Vietnamese were nothing.
So we worked hard... very hard, and brought... the rubber from Brazil, and then plant it here.
We took the Vietnamese, work with them... make something- something out of nothing.
So when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain... we want to stay here because it's ours- it belongs to us.
It keeps our family together.
I mean, we fight for that.
While you Americans, you are fighting for... the biggest nothing in history.
I'm sorry, Captain. I will see if your men need any help to... repair your boat... so that you can go on with your war.
I apologize for my family, Captain.
We have all lost much here.
Hubert- his wife and two sons.
And I have lost a husband.
I understand.
You are tired of the war.
I can see it in your face.
'Twas the same in the eyes of the soldiers of our war.
We called them
"Les Soldats Perdus-"
The Lost Soldiers.
If you like, we can have some cognac.
I have to- to see about my men and-
The war will be still here tomorrow.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.
No, I don't drink wine.
I do like cognac, but I don't want any now. Thank you.
Well... then I-
I must drink alone.
Will you go back after the war to America?
Then you're like us- your home is here.
Do you know why you can never step into the same river twice?
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.
'Twas the morphine he took for the wounds he suffered in his heart.
He would rage and he would cry, my lost soldier.
And I said to him,
"There are two of you.
Don't you see?
One that kills and one that loves."
And he said to me...
"I don't know whether
I'm an animal or a god."
But you are both.
You want more?
All that matters is that you're alive.
You are alive, Captain.
That's the truth.
There are two of you, don't you see?
One that kills... and one that loves.
Can't see nothing.
We stoppin'.
You're not authorized to stop this boat, Chief.
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.
I ain't riskin' no more lives.
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
You'll do what I say.
You see anything, Chef?
Why don't they fucking attack, man?
Watch it over here, Chief.
Got a stump.
On the fifties.
He was close.
He was real close.
I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him...
as if the boat were being sucked upriver...
and the water was flowing back into the jungle.
Whatever was going to happen...
it wasn't going to be the way they called it back in Nha Trang.
- Arrows!
- Fire!
Chef, open up! Fire!
Lance, fire!
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.
- They're just little toy arrows.
- Cut it out! Quiet!
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.
Quiet!
You got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out... because you don't know where the hell you're going, do ya?
Do ya?
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!
Lance, get the wheel!
You savages! Come and get it!
You son of a bitches!
A spear?
My mission is to make it up into Cambodia.
There's a Green Beret colonel up there who's gone insane... and I'm supposed to kill him.
That's fucking typical!
Shit!
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!
I'm short and we gotta go up there so you can kill one of our own guys?
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.
Shit!
That's fuckin' crazy.
I mean, I thought you were going in to blow up a bridge... or some fuckin' railroad tracks or somethin'.
- That's all right.
- No. No, wait. Wait.
We'll go together, on the boat.
We'll go with you.
We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?
Part of me was afraid of what I would find...
and what I would do when I got there.
I knew the risks...
or imagined I knew.
But the thing
I felt the most...
much stronger than fear...
was the desire to confront him.
Just keep movin'.
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man.
Zap 'em with your siren.
There's mines over there and mines over there too.
And watch out. Those goddamn monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.
Ah, that's a pretty one.
Move it right in towards me.
I'm an American.
Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.
Hi. American.
American civilian.
It's all right.
And you got the cigarettes. And that's what I've been dreaming about.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
I'm a photojournalist.
I've covered the war since '64.
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and 'Nam.
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.
Who are all these people?
Yeah, well, they think you've come to- to take him away.
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?
Him! Col. Kurtz.
These are all his children, man, as far as you can see.
Hell, man, out here we're all his children.
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz?
Hey, mac.
You don't talk to the colonel.
Well, you listen to him.
The man's enlarged my mind.
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.
I mean, sometimes he'll-
Well, you say hello to him, right?
He'll just walk by you and he won't even notice you.
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say...
"Do you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'?
If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming you.
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you."
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.
"I should have been a pair of ragged claws... scuttling across floors of silent seas."
- I mean-
- Stay with the boat.
Don't go any- Don't go without me, okay? I wanna get a picture.
He can be terrible and he can be mean... and he can be right.
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.
I mean-
I wish I had words, you know.
I wish I had words.
I could tell you something like, the other day he wanted to kill me.
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?
Because I took his picture.
He said, "If you take my picture again...
I'm gonna kill you."
And he meant it.
See, just lay cool.
Lay cool.
Lay back. Dig it.
He gets friendly again.
He really does.
But you don't- you don't- you don't judge the colonel.
You don't judge the colonel like an ordinary man.
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!
You can feel the vibe of this place.
Let me take your picture. Hey, could you hold- Hey, hello. Hello.
Could you hold up a minute?
Colby.
The heads.
You're looking at the heads.
I, uh- Sometimes he goes too far.
He's the first one to admit it.
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!
If you could have heard the man just two days ago- if you could have heard him then, God-
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fuckin' A!
I just wanna talk to him.
Well, man, he's gone away.
He's gone away. He disappeared out in the jungle with his people.
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.
He forgets himself with his people.
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?
Maybe we should wait back at the boat.
- I think you should-
- Okay, Chef.
We'll go back to the boat for a while.
Yeah, stay with Lance.
This colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy.
He's evil!
I mean, that's what the man's got set up here, man!
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry.
Look around you!
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do anything to get out of this joint.
- Good boy.
- We could blow all them assholes away.
They're so fuckin' spaced out, they wouldn't even know it.
I ain't afraid of all them fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.
I used to think if I died in an evil place... then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to Heaven.
But now, fuck-
I mean, I don't care where it goes, as long as it ain't here.
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.
- Get out of here.
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around, check the place out.
See if I can find the colonel, okay?
Well, what do you want me to do?
Here. You take the radio... and if I don't get back by 2200 hours... you call in the air strike.
"Air strike?"
The code is "Almighty"... coordinates zero-niner-two-six- four-seven-one-two.
It's all in there.
Zero-niner-two-six- four-seven-one-two.
Everything I saw told me that Kurtz had gone insane.
The place was full of bodies-
North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians.
If I was still alive, it was because he wanted me that way.
It smelled like slow death in there-
malaria...
and nightmares.
This was the end of the river, all right.
Where are you from, Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
Were you born there?
Yes, sir.
Whereabouts?
Toledo, sir.
How far are you from the river?
The Ohio River, sir?
About 200 miles.
I went down that river once when I was a kid.
There's a place in the river-
I can't remember-
Must've been a gardenia plantation or a flower plantation at one time.
It's all wild and overgrown now.
But for about- for about five miles you'd think that... heaven just fell on the earth... in the form of gardenias.
Have you ever considered... any real freedoms?
Freedoms from the opinion of others?
Even the opinions of yourself?
Did they say why, Willard?
Why they wanted to terminate my command?
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.
It's no longer classified, is it?
What did they tell you?
They told me... that you had gone... totally insane... and that your methods... were unsound.
Are my methods unsound?
I don't see any method... at all, sir.
I expected... someone like you.
What did you expect?
Are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
You're neither.
You're an errand boy... sent by grocery clerks... to collect the bill.
Why, huh?
Why would a nice guy like you wanna kill a genius?
Feeling pretty good, huh?
Why?
Do you know-
Do you know that the man- the man really likes you?
He likes you.
He really likes you.
But he's got something in mind for you.
Aren't you curious about that?
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?
There's something happening out here, man.
You know something, man.
I know something that you don't know.
That's right, Jack.
The man is clear in his mind... but his soul is mad.
Oh, yeah.
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this.
He hates it.
But the man's-
He reads poetry out loud, all right?
And a voice- a voice-
He likes you
'cause you're still alive.
He's got plans for you.
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.
I mean, what are they gonna say, man, when he's gone, huh?
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.
What are they gonna say about him? What are they gonna say? He was a kind man?
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?
Bullshit, man!
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!
You.
Almost eight hours.
I'm asleep.
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.
Fuck.
Has it been eight hours?
Hello. Almighty. Almighty.
This is PBR Street Gang.
Radio check. Over.
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Christ!
Time magazine.
The weekly newsmagazine.
September 22, 1967.
Volume 90... number 12.
"The War on the Horizon. The American people may find it hard to believe... that the US is winning the war in Vietnam.
Nevertheless... one of the most exhaustive inquiries... into the status of the conflict yet compiled... offers considerable evidence that the weight of US power... two-and-a-half years after the big buildup began... is beginning to make itself felt.
White House officials maintain the impact of that strength... may bring the enemy to the point where he could... simply be unable to continue fighting."
Is this familiar?
"Because Lyndon Johnson fears that the US public... is in no mood to accept its optimistic conclusions... he may never permit the report to be released in full.
Even so, he is sufficiently impressed with the findings... and sufficiently anxious to make their conclusions known... to permit experts who have been working on it... to talk about it in general terms."
No date, Time magazine.
"Sir Robert Thompson... who led the victory over Communist guerillas in Malaya... is now a RAND corporation consultant... recently returned to Vietnam to sound out the situation for President Nixon.
He told the president last week... that things felt much better... and smelled much better over there."
How do they smell to you, soldier?
You'll be free.
You'll be under guard.
Read these at your leisure.
Don't lose them.
Don't try to escape.
You'll be shot.
We can talk of these things later.
"We are the hollow men.
We are the stuffed men... leaning together at peace filled with straw.
Alas, our dried voices when we whisper together... are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass... or a rat's feet over broken glass in a dry cellar.
He's really out there.
Shape without form... shade without color... paralyzed force... gesture without motion."
Do you know what the man's saying? Do you?
This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics.
It's one through nine.
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.
You can't travel in space. You can't go out into space, you know... without like, you know, with fractions.
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?
What are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus?
That's dialectic physics, okay.
Dialectic logic is, there's only love and hate.
You either love somebody or you hate 'em.
Mutt!
You mutt.
This is the way the fucking world is.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!
Not with a bang.
A whimper.
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, Jack.
On the river, I thought that the minute I looked at him...
I'd know what to do.
But it didn't happen.
I was in there with him for days. Not under guard.
I was free.
But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere.
He knew more about what
I was going to do than I did.
If the generals back in Nha Trang could see what I saw...
would they still want me to kill him?
More than ever, probably.
And what would his people back home want if they ever learned...
just how far from them he'd really gone?
He broke from them...
and then he broke from himself.
I'd never seen a man so broken up and...
ripped apart.
I've seen the horrors- horrors that you've seen.
But you have no right to call me a murderer.
You have a right to kill me.
You have a right to do that.
But you have no right to judge me.
It's impossible for words... to describe... what is necessary... to those... who do not know... what horror means.
Horror.
Horror has a face.
And you must make a friend of horror.
Horror and moral terror... are your friends.
If they are not... then they are enemies to be feared.
They are truly enemies.
I remember when I was with Special Forces.
Seems a thousand centuries ago.
We went into a camp to inoculate... some children.
We'd left the camp... after we had inoculated the children for polio.
And this old man came running after us, and he was crying.
He couldn't say.
We went back there... and they had come and hacked off... every inoculated arm.
There they were, in a pile- a pile of... little arms.
And I remember...
I- I- I cried.
I wept like... some grandmother.
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.
I never want to forget.
And then I realized... like I was shot- like I was shot with a diamond- a diamond bullet right through my forehead.
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that.
The genius."
The will to do that.
Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.
And then I realized... they were stronger than me because they could stand it.
These were not monsters.
These were men- trained cadres.
These men who fought with their hearts... who have families, who have children... who are filled with love... that they had the strength- the strength... to do that.
If I had ten divisions of those men... then our troubles here would be over very quickly.
You have to have men... who are moral... and at the same time... who are able to... utilize their... primordial instincts to kill... without feeling, without passion... without judgment- without judgment.
Because it's judgment that defeats us.
I worry that my son... might not understand what I've tried to be.
And if I were to be killed, Willard...
I would want someone to go to my home... and tell my son everything.
Everything I did.
Everything you saw.
Because there's nothing that I detest more than...
the stench of lies.
And if you understand me,
Willard, you-
you will do this for me.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty. Over.
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty standing by. How do you copy?
They were gonna make me a major for this...
and I wasn't even in their fuckin' army anymore.
Everybody wanted me to do it.
Him most of all.
I felt like he was up there...
waiting for me to take the pain away.
He just wanted to go out like a soldier...
standing up.
Not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade.
Even the jungle wanted him dead.
And that's who he really took his orders from anyway.
Come on, baby take a chance with us
Come on, baby take a chance with us
Come on, baby take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus tonight
Blue bus tonight
Blue bus tonight
Blue
Come on, yeah
We train young men to drop fire on people... but their commanders... won't allow them to write "fuck"... on their airplanes because... it's obscene.
The horror.
The horror.
Calling PBR Street Gang.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over.
PBR Street Gang?
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty-
The horror.
The horror.
Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning or in rain?
When the hurlyburly's done.
When the battle's lost and won.
- That would be ere the set of sun.
- Where?
Upon the heath.
There to meet with Macbeth.
- What bloody man is that?
- Hail, friend!
Say to the king thy knowledge of the broil as thou left it.
The merciless Macdonwald led his rebellion from the Western Isles.
And fortune on his damned quarrel smiled.
- But, brave Macbeth...
- He deserves that name.
- Carved out a passage till he faced the slave.
And ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell...
...till he unseamed him from the nave to the chops.
Valiant cousin!
Upon this chance did the Norwegian king...
...with new supplies of men, begin a fresh assault.
Dismayed not this our captains,
Macbeth and Banquo?
Yes. As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds. They smack of honour.
Go get him surgeons.
- God save the king.
- What news, worthy thane?
Norway, in terrible numbers...
...assisted by this traitor, the Thane of Cawdor...
...began a dismal conflict till
Bellona's bridegroom, Macbeth...
...confronts the king arm against arm, curbing his lavish spirit.
And to conclude, the victory fell on us.
Great happiness! No more that thane shall deceive our bosom interest.
Go pronounce his present death.
And with his former title, greet Macbeth.
So foul and fair a day
I have not seen.
What are these?
So withered and wild in their attire...
...that look not like inhabitants of the Earth.
Speak, if you can.
What are you?
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.
All hail, Macbeth, that shall be king hereafter.
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed which outwardly you show?
My partner you greet with grace and great prediction...
...that he seems rapt withal.
To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time...
...and say which grain will grow and which will not, speak to me...
...who neither beg nor fear your favours nor your hate.
Hail! Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
Not so happy, yet much happier.
Thou shalt beget kings, though thou be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail.
Stay, you imperfect speakers!
Tell me more.
By Sinel's death,
I know I am Thane of Glamis.
But how of Cawdor?
Say from whence you owe this intelligence.
Or why upon this heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting?
Whither are they vanished?
Into the air.
And what seemed corporal melted, as breath into the wind.
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten of the insane root that takes reason prisoner?
Your children shall be kings.
You shall be king.
And Thane of Cawdor. Went it not so?
To the selfsame tune and words.
The Thane of Cawdor lives.
And to be king...
... stands not within
the prospect of belief.
No more than to be Cawdor.
The king hath happily received the news of thy success.
Thick as hail came post with post, and everyone did bear thy praises.
We are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks, not pay thee.
And for an earnest of a greater honour, he bade me call thee...
...Thane of Cawdor.
What?
Can the devil speak true?
He lives. Why do you dress me in borrowed robes?
Who was the thane lives yet, but that life he deserves to lose.
Treasons capital, confessed and proved, have overthrown him.
Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor.
The greatest is behind.
Thanks for your pains.
Do you not hope your children shall be kings?
Those that gave Cawdor to me, promised no less to them.
That, trusted home, might yet enkindle you unto the crown...
...besides the Thane of Cawdor.
Often, to win us to our harm, instruments of darkness tell truths.
Win us with honest trifles, to betray us in deepest consequence.
This supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill...
... cannot be good.
If ill, why hath it given me earnest
of success, commencing in a truth?
I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield
to that suggestion...
... whose horrid image doth unfix
my hair and make my seated heart...
... knock at my ribs
against the use of nature?
Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.
My thought, whose murder yet
is but fantastical...
... shakes so my single state of man...
... that function is smothered
in surmise...
... and nothing is but what is not.
I thank you, gentlemen.
Look how our partner's rapt.
If chance will have me king,
chance may crown me without my stir.
Worthy Macbeth.
We stay upon your leisure.
Give me your favour, my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten.
Let us to the king.
Long live the king.
Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.
He threw away the dearest thing he owed as if it were a careless trifle.
There's no art to find a mind's construction in the face.
On him I built an absolute trust.
"Hail, king that shalt be.
This have I thought good to deliver thee...
...my dearest partner of greatness...
...that thou might not be ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor...
...and shalt be what thou art promised.
Yet I do fear thy nature.
It is too full of the milk of human
kindness to catch the nearest way.
Thou wouldst be great...
... art not without ambition, but
without the illness should attend it.
What thou wouldst highly,
thou wouldst holily.
Wouldst not play false,
yet wouldst wrongly win.
Hie thee hither, that I may pour
my spirits in thine ear.
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, Thane of Cawdor!
Worthiest cousin! The sin of my ingratitude was heavy on me.
Only I have left to say, more is thy due than more than all can pay.
The service and the loyalty
I owe pays itself.
Your part is to receive our duties.
Welcome. I have begun to plant thee and will labour to make thee grow.
Noble Banquo, that has no less deserved...
...let me enfold thee and hold thee to my heart.
There if I grow, the harvest is your own.
Sons, kinsmen, thanes, and you whose places are the nearest...
...know we will establish our estate...
...upon our eldest, Malcolm.
Whom we name hereafter the Prince of Cumberland.
Hail, Prince of Cumberland!
Hail, Prince of Cumberland!
Go hence to Inverness and bind us further to you.
I'll go and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach.
- So humbly take my leave.
- My worthy Cawdor.
It is a peerless kinsman.
The Prince of Cumberland!
That is a step on which I must
fall down, or else o'erleap.
For in my way it lies.
Macbeth! Macbeth!
Stars, hide your fires.
Let not light see my black
and deep desires.
Great Glamis. Worthy Cawdor.
Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter.
Thy letter transported me beyond this present...
...and I feel the future in the instant.
My dearest love...
...Duncan comes here tonight.
- And when goes hence?
- Tomorrow, as he purposes.
Never shall sun that morrow see.
Your face is as a book where men may read strange matters.
He that's coming must be provided for.
You shall put this night's business into my dispatch.
We will speak further.
Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under it.
Leave all the rest to me.
The raven croaks the fatal entrance
of Duncan under my battlements.
Come, you spirits that tend on
mortal thoughts. Unsex me here.
Fill me from the crown to the toe
top-full of direst cruelty.
Make thick my blood. Stop up
the access and passage to remorse...
... that no compunctious visitings
of nature shake my purpose.
This castle hath a pleasant seat.
The air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses.
Come, thick night, pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell...
... that my keen knife
see not the wound it makes...
... nor heaven peep through
the dark to cry, "Hold!"
Fair and noble hostess, we are your guest tonight.
Your servant ever.
Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host.
We love him highly and shall continue our graces towards him.
If it were done when 'tis done,
then 'twere well it were done quickly.
If the assassination could
trammel up the consequence...
... and catch,
with his surcease, success.
That but this blow might be
the be-all and the end-all here.
But here, upon this bank
and shoal of time...
... we'd jump the life to come.
Health to this household!
But in these cases,
we still have judgement here...
... that we but teach
bloody instructions...
... which, being taught,
return to plague the inventor.
He's here in double trust.
First, as I am his kinsman
and his subject...
... strong both against the deed.
Then as his host...
...who should against his murderer shut the door, not bear the knife myself.
Besides, this Duncan hath borne his faculties so meek...
... hath been so clear
in his great office...
... that his virtues will plead
like angels, trumpet-tongued...
... against the deep damnation
of his taking-off.
And pity, like a newborn babe striding
the blast, or heaven's cherubin...
... horsed upon the sightless couriers
of the air, shall blow...
... the horrid deed in every eye,
that tears shall drown the wind.
I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent.
But only vaulting ambition...
...which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other side.
- Why have you left the chamber?
- Hath he asked for me?
Know you not he has?
We will proceed no further in this business.
He hath honoured me of late.
And I have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people...
...which would be worn in their newest gloss, not cast aside so soon.
Was the hope drunk, wherein you dressed yourself?
Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now to look so green and pale at what it did so freely?
From this time such I account thy love.
Art thou afeard to be the same in act as in desire?
Prithee, peace.
Wouldst thou live a coward, letting
"I dare not" wait upon "I would"?
Like the poor cat in the adage?
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares do more is none.
What beast was it then, that made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man.
To be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man.
Hail, Thane of Cawdor.
If we should fail?
We fail.
But screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
Duncan's two chamberlains will I with wine so convince...
...that memory, the warder of the brain, shall be a fume.
I'll drug their possets.
When in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death...
...what cannot you and I perform upon the unguarded Duncan?
Bring forth men-children only...
... for thy undaunted mettle
should compose nothing but males.
How goes the night?
The moon is down.
I have not heard the clock.
- She goes down at 12.
- I take it 'tis later, sir.
Take my sword.
There's husbandry in heaven.
Their candles are all out.
Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, and yet I would not sleep.
Merciful powers, restrain the thoughts that nature gives way to in repose.
Who's there?
A friend.
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The king's abed.
He hath been in unusual pleasure...
...and sent great largess to your offices.
Being unprepared, our will became the servant to defect.
All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters.
- To you they have showed some truth.
- I think not of them.
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve...
...we would spend it in words upon that business if you'd grant the time.
At your kindest leisure.
It shall make honour for you.
So I lose none in seeking to augment it. I shall be counselled.
Good repose the while.
Thanks, sir. The like to you.
Is this a dagger
which I see before me...
... the handle toward my hand?
Come...
...let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision...
...sensible to feeling as to sight?
Or art thou but a dagger of the mind...
...a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet...
...in form as palpable as this which now I draw.
Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going.
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools of the other senses...
...or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still!
And on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood...
...which was not so before.
There's no such thing.
It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes.
Now o'er the one half-world
nature seems dead...
... and withered murder,
alarmed by his sentinel, the wolf...
... whose howl's his watch.
Thus with his stealthy pace,
with Tarquin's ravishing strides...
... towards his design
moves like a ghost.
Thou sure and firm-set earth...
... hear not my steps,
which way they walk...
... for fear the very stones prate
of my whereabouts.
Hear it not, Duncan...
... for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven...
... or to hell.
I'm afraid they have awaked,
and 'tis not done.
The attempt and not the deed
confounds us.
Hark!
Peace! It was the owl that shrieked...
... the fatal bellman, which gives
the sternest good night.
My husband?
I have done the deed.
Didst thou not hear a noise?
I heard the owl and the crickets.
- Did not you speak? Now.
- As I descended?
- Ay.
- Hark!
- Who lies in the second chamber?
- Donalbain.
This is a sorry sight.
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
Methought I heard a voice cry,
"Sleep no more.
Macbeth does murder sleep."
The innocent sleep, sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care.
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, balm of hurt minds.
Nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast.
Still it cried to all the house,
"Glamis hath murdered sleep...
...and Cawdor shall sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more!"
Who was it that thus cried?
These deeds must not be thought after these ways so...
...it will make us mad.
Get some water, and wash this filthy witness from your hands.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there.
I'll go no more.
I am afraid of what I have done.
Look on it again I dare not.
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers.
If he do bleed...
...l'll gild the faces of the grooms withal...
...for it must seem their guilt.
Whence is that knocking?
How is it with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here?
They pluck out mine eyes!
Will great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand?
No, this my hand will rather...
...the multitudinous seas incarnadine...
...making the green one red.
My hands are of your colour...
...but I scorn to wear a heart so white.
A little water clears us of this deed.
How easy is it, then!
Retire we to our chamber.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion show us to be watchers.
Be not lost so poorly in your thoughts.
To know my deed,
'twere best not know myself.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking!
I would thou couldst.
Here's a knocking indeed!
If a man were porter of hell gate, he'd have less turning the key.
Who's there, in the name of Beelzebub?
Knock, knock. Who's there, in the other devil's name?
Knock, knock.
Never at quiet. What are you?
One that goes the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire?
I'll devil-porter it no further.
This place is too cold for hell.
Anon, anon!
Was it so late ere you went to bed, that you lie so late?
We were carousing till the second cock...
...and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
- What three things?
- Nose-painting, sleep and urine.
Lechery, sir, it provokes and it unprovokes.
It provokes the desire but takes away the performance.
It makes you, it mars you, it sets you on...
...it takes you off, it persuades you, it disheartens you...
...it makes you stand to and not stand to.
- Drink gave thee the lie last night.
- That it did.
- Is thy master stirring?
- Good morrow.
- Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
- Not yet.
He did command me to call timely.
I have almost slipped the hour.
I'll bring you to him.
This is the door.
I'll make so bold to call, for 'tis my appointed service.
- Goes the king hence today?
- He does. He did appoint so.
The night has been unruly.
Our chimneys were blown down.
And, as they say, lamentings heard in the air, strange screams of death.
Some say the earth was feverous.
- 'Twas a rough night.
- Oh, horror!
Horror, horror! Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Murder hath broke open the Lord's anointed temple.
- What is it you say?
- Mean you His Majesty?
Do not bid me speak.
See, and then speak yourselves.
Awake!
Awake! Ring the alarm bell!
Murder and treason!
Malcolm and Donalbain!
Banquo! Awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, and look on death itself!
Up! Up!
And see the great doom's image.
Fleance! Banquo!
Rise up as from your graves...
...and walk like spirits to countenance this horror.
Ring the bell!
What's the business, that a hideous trumpet calls...
...to parley the sleepers of the house? Speak!
Gentle lady, 'tis not for you to hear what I speak.
Banquo, our royal master's murdered.
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
Too cruel anywhere.
I prithee, contradict thyself, and say it is not so.
Had I but died before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time.
There is nothing serious in mortality.
All is but toys.
Renown and grace is dead.
- What is amiss?
- You are, and do not know it.
Your royal father's murdered.
By whom?
Those of his chambers, it seemed, had done it.
They were all badged with blood.
So were their daggers.
O, yet I do repent me of my fury that I did kill them.
Wherefore did you so?
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious...
...loyal and neutral in a moment? No man!
Here lay Duncan, his skin laced with his blood.
There the murderers, steeped in the colours of their trade.
Who could refrain, that had a heart to love?
And in that heart, courage to make his love known?
Let's briefly put on manly readiness and meet in the hall together...
...to question this most bloody piece of work.
Fears and scruples shake us.
In the great hand of God I stand.
Against the undivulged pretence
I fight of treasonous malice.
- So do I.
- So all.
What will you do?
Let's not consort with them.
- I'll to England.
- To Ireland, I.
Our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer.
Where we are, there's daggers in men's smiles.
This murderous shaft that's shot hath not yet lighted.
Therefore to horse.
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking.
Shift away.
- How goes the world, Macduff?
- Why? See you not?
Is it known who did this more than bloody deed?
- Those that Macbeth hath slain.
- What good could they expect?
They were suborned. Malcolm and
Donalbain, the king's sons, are fled...
...which puts upon them suspicion of the deed.
Then 'tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
He's already named and gone to Scone to be invested.
- Will you to Scone?
- No, cousin, I'll home to Fife.
Well, I will thither.
May you see things well done there.
Adieu.
Thou hast it now.
King, Cawdor, Glamis...
... all as the weird women promised.
And I fear thou play'dst
most foully for it.
Yet it was said it should not
stand in thy posterity.
But that myself should be
the root and father of many kings.
If there comes truth from them...
... may they not be
my oracles as well...
... and set me up in hope?
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, King of Scotland!
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, King of Scotland!
Here's our chief guest.
If he had been forgotten, it'd have been a gap in our great feast.
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, and I'll request your presence.
Let Your Highness command upon me...
...to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie forever knit.
- Ride you this afternoon?
- Ay, my lord.
Is it far you ride?
As far as will fill up the time
'twixt this and supper.
- Fail not our feast.
- My lord, I will not.
We hear our bloody cousins are in England and Ireland...
...not confessing their cruel parricide.
But of that tomorrow. Hie you to horse. Adieu till you return at night.
- Goes Fleance with you?
- Ay, my lord.
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot. Farewell.
- Attend those men our leisure?
- They do.
Bring them before us.
To be thus is nothing, but to be safely thus.
Our fears in Banquo stick deep.
In his royalty of nature...
...he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety.
There is none but he whose being do I fear.
And under him my genius is rebuked.
We'll keep ourself till suppertime alone. Till then, God be with you.
He chid the sisters, when first
they put the name of king upon me...
... and bade them speak to him.
Then, prophet-like they hailed him...
... father to a line of kings.
Upon my head,
they placed a fruitless crown...
... and put a barren sceptre
in my grip.
Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal
hand, no son of mine succeeding.
If it be so...
... for Banquo's sons
have I defiled my mind.
For them the gracious Duncan
have I murdered.
To make them kings.
The seeds of Banquo kings.
Stay within call.
- Was it not yesterday we spoke?
- It was, Your Highness.
Well then now, have you considered of my speeches?
Know that it was he in times past which held you under fortune...
...which you thought had been our innocent self.
You made this known to us.
Is patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go?
Are you so gospelled to pray for this man and for his issue...
...whose heavy hand has bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever?
We are men, my liege.
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men.
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, shoughs...
...water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept, all by the name of dogs.
And so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file...
...not in the worst rank of manhood, say it.
And I will put that business in your bosoms...
...whose execution takes your enemy off...
...grapples you to the heart and love of us...
...who wear our health but sickly in his life...
...which in his death were perfect.
I am one whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed...
...that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.
And I another.
Both of you know
Banquo was your enemy.
- Ay, my lord.
- So is he mine!
Though I could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight...
...and bid my will avouch it.
Yet I must not, for certain friends...
...that are both his and mine, whose loves I may not drop.
And thence it is, that I to your assistance do make love...
...masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons.
- We shall perform what you command.
- Your spirits shine through you.
It must be done tonight, and some way from the palace.
And with him, to leave no rubs nor botches in the work...
...Fleance, his son that keeps him company...
...whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's...
...must embrace the fate of that dark hour.
- Resolve yourselves apart.
- We are resolved, my lord.
Advise them where to plant themselves.
How now, my lord?
Why do you keep alone...
...of sorriest fancies your companions making?
Things without all remedy should be without regard. What's done is done.
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
But let the frame of things disjoint.
Ere we'll eat our meal in fear...
...and sleep in the affliction of the terrible dreams that shake us nightly.
Better be with the dead...
...than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy.
Duncan is in his grave.
After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well.
Treason has done his worst.
Not steel, nor poison...
...malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing can touch him further.
Come on. Gentle, my lord.
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.
So shall I, love.
And so, I pray, be you.
Full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife.
Thou knowst that Banquo and his Fleance live.
But in them nature's copy is not eterne.
There's comfort yet.
They are assailable.
Then be thou jocund.
Ere the bat hath flown his cloistered flight...
...ere to black Hecate's summons...
...the shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums...
...hath rung night's yawning peal...
...there shall be done a deed of dreadful note.
What's to be done?
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, till thou applaud the deed.
Come, seeling night...
...scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day.
And with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces...
...that great bond which keeps me pale.
Light thickens, and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood.
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse...
...while night's black agents to their prey do rouse.
- Who did bid thee join with us?
- Macbeth.
He needs not our mistrust since he delivers our offices...
...and what we have to do to the direction just.
Well, stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
And near approaches the subject of our watch.
By the clock 'tis day...
...and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
Is it night's predominance or the day's shame...
...that darkness does the face of earth entomb...
...when living light should kiss it?
It will be rain tonight.
Let it come down!
Treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly!
Fly!
Fly!
There's blood upon thy face.
- 'Tis Banquo's then.
- Is he despatched?
His throat is cut.
That I did for him.
Thou art the best of the cutthroats.
Yet he's good that did the like for Fleance.
If thou didst that, thou art the nonpareil.
Most royal sir, Fleance is escaped.
Then comes my fit again.
I had else been perfect, whole as
the marble, founded as the rock.
But now I am cabined, confined,
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.
- But Banquo's safe?
- Ay, my good lord.
Safe in a ditch he bides, with 20 trenched gashes on his head.
There the grown serpent lies.
The worm that's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed.
No teeth for the present.
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again.
You know your own degrees. Sit down.
At first and last, a hearty welcome.
Thanks to Your Majesty.
Our hostess keeps her state.
Ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host.
- My lord, you do not give the cheer.
- Sweet remembrancer.
I drink to the general joy of the whole table...
...and to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss. Would he were here.
Banquo!
Now good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both!
May it please Your Highness, sit.
Please it Your Highness to grace us with your royal company?
- The table's full.
- Here is a place reserved, sir.
- Where?
- Here, my good lord.
- Which of you have done this?
- What, my lord?
Thou canst not say I did it.
- Never shake thy gory locks at me.
- His Highness is not well.
Sit, friends. My lord is often thus and hath been from his youth.
Keep seat. The fit is momentary.
Upon a thought he will again be well.
Are you a man?
Ay, a bold one that dare look on that which might appal the devil.
O, proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear.
This is the air-drawn dagger you said led you to Duncan. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces? When all's done, you look but on a stool.
Prithee, see there!
Behold! Look! How say you?
Avaunt, and quit my sight! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold.
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with.
What man dare, I dare.
Take any shape but that, and my nerves shall never tremble.
Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!
What?
Quite unmanned in folly.
- Lf I stand here, I saw him.
- Fie, for shame!
Blood hath been shed ere now, in the olden time.
And since too, murders have been performed too terrible for the ear.
Time has been that when the brains were out, a man would die...
...and there an end.
But now they rise again, with
20 mortal gashes on their crowns.
You've displaced the mirth, broke the meeting with most admired disorder.
Can such things be and overwhelm us like a summer's cloud...
...without our special wonder?
You make me strange, even to the disposition that I owe.
When now I think you can behold such sights...
...and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks...
...when mine is blanched with fear.
What sights, my lord?
I pray you, speak not, he grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.
At once, good night.
Stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once.
Good night. And better health attend His Majesty.
Kind good night to all.
It will have blood.
They say blood will have blood.
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak.
What is the night?
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
How sayst thou, that Macduff denies his person at our great bidding?
How know you this, my lord?
I hear it by the way.
There's not a one of them, but in his house I keep a servant paid.
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
Come, we'll to sleep.
I must again to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak.
For now I am bent to know, by the worst means, the worst.
For mine own good, all causes shall give way.
I'm in blood, stepped in so far that should I wade no more...
...returning were as tedious as go o'er.
Strange things I have in head that will to hand...
...which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
We are yet but young in deed.
By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.
How now, you secret, black and midnight hags? What is it you do?
A deed without a name.
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Fire burn, cauldron bubble.
Toad that under cold stone, days and nights has 31.
Sweltered venom sleeping got, boil thou first in the charmed pot.
Eye of newt and toe of frog, wool of bat and tongue of dog.
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting, lizard's leg and howlet's wing.
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips, slivered in the moon's eclipse.
Fillet of a fenny snake, in the cauldron boil and bake.
Liver of blaspheming Jew, gall of goat and slips of yew.
I conjure you, by that which you profess, howe'er you know it.
- Answer me to what I ask you.
- Speak!
- Demand.
- We'll answer.
Say if thou'dst hear it from our mouths, or from our masters.
Call them, let me see them.
Cool it with a baboon's blood, then the charm is firm and good.
- Tell me, unknown power...
- He knows thy thought.
Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth.
Beware Macduff.
Beware the Thane of Fife.
Thou hast harped my fear aright.
- But one word more...
- He will not be commanded.
Be bloody, bold and resolute.
Laugh to scorn the power of man.
For none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.
None of woman born shall harm Macbeth.
Then live Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?
But I'll make assurance double sure and take a bond of fate.
Thou shalt not live!
- Macbeth shall never vanquished be.
- Never, never.
Until Great Birnam Wood...
...to high Dunsinane Hill shall come against him.
That will never be!
Who can recruit the forest?
Bid the tree unfix his earth-bound root?
Sweet bodements, good!
Yet my heart throbs to know one thing:
- Shall Banquo's issue ever reign?
- Seek to know no more.
I will be satisfied! Deny me this and an eternal curse fall on you!
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo.
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Now I see 'tis true.
For the blood-boltered Banquo smiles upon me...
...and points at them for his!
Where are they?
Gone!
Infected be the air whereon they ride!
And damned all those that trust them!
Macduff is fled.
- Where does he bestow himself?
- In the English court.
Where lives the son of Duncan.
Thither Macduff is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid...
...to wake Northumberland and warlike Seyward.
By the help of these, we may again give to our tables meat...
...sleep to our nights, our feasts free from bloody knives.
Some holy angel fly to England...
...that a swift blessing may soon return to this, our suffering country.
Gentle lady.
Gracious Duncan's dead.
Gracious Duncan was pitied of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead.
The valiant Banquo walked too late.
Whom, you may say, Fleance killed, for Fleance fled.
Man must not walk too late.
How monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their father.
Damned, indeed.
How it did grieve Macbeth.
- Had he Duncan's sons under his key...
- As, an't please heaven, he shall not.
They should find what it were to kill a father.
So should Fleance.
Peace.
What news?
Macduff is fled to England.
- Fled to England?
- Ay, my good lord.
Time, thou anticipat'st
my dread exploits.
The castle of Macduff
I will surprise. Seize upon Fife.
Give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes...
... and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.
No boasting like a fool.
This deed I'll do
before the purpose cool.
You must have patience.
He had none. His flight was madness.
Our fears do make us traitors.
You know not if it was wisdom or fear.
To leave his wife and his babes in a place from whence himself does fly?
He loves us not.
He wants a natural touch.
The wren, the most diminutive bird, will fight...
...her young in the nest, against the owl.
- All is the fear, nothing is the love.
- Dear coz, pray, school yourself.
But for your husband, he is noble, wise, judicious...
...and best knows the fits of the season.
I take my leave of you. Shall not be long but I'll be here again.
Things at their worst will cease...
...or else climb upward to what they were before.
My pretty cousin, blessing upon you.
Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless.
I take my leave at once.
- How wilt thou do for a father?
- How will you do for a husband?
Why, I can buy me 20 at any market.
- Was my father a traitor?
- Ay, that he was.
- What is a traitor?
- Why, one that swears and lies.
Be all traitors that do so?
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.
- Who must hang them?
- The honest men.
The liars are fools, for there are enough of them to hang the honest men.
- God help thee, poor monkey.
- Lf he were dead, you'd weep for him.
Where's your husband?
I hope in no place so unsanctified, where such as thou mayst find him.
He's a traitor.
- Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!
- What, you egg?
Young fry of treachery!
He has killed me, Mother.
Besides her walking and other actual performances, what has she said?
That which I will not report after her.
You may to a doctor.
'Tis most meet you should.
Neither to you, nor anyone, having no witness to confirm my speech.
- Her eyes are open.
- Ay, but their sense is shut.
- What is it she does now?
- An accustomed action.
To seem thus washing her hands.
Yet here's a spot.
Out, damned spot.
Out, I say!
One.
Two.
Why then 'tis time to do it.
Hell is murky.
Fie, my lord, fie!
A soldier and afeard?
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?
Yet who'd have thought the old man to have so much blood in him?
Well, well!
The Thane of Fife had a wife.
Where is she now?
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?
No more of that, my lord.
You mar all with this starting.
Go to. You have known what you should not.
She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that.
Here's the smell of blood still.
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely charged.
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale.
I tell you, Banquo's buried.
He cannot come out of his grave.
Even so?
To bed, to bed.
Come. Come.
Come, give me your hand.
What's done cannot be undone.
To bed, to bed.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God! God forgive us all.
Look after her. Remove from her means of annoyance and keep eyes upon her.
- Good night.
- Good night, good doctor.
How does your patient, doctor?
Not so sick, as she's troubled with fancies that keep her from her sleep.
Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow?
Raze out the written troubles of the brain?
And with some sweet, oblivious antidote...
...cleanse the bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart?
Therein the patient must minister to himself.
Throw physic to the dogs.
Bring me no more reports.
Let them fly. All!
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear.
What's the boy, Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?
The spirits that know all mortal consequences pronounced me thus:
"Fear not. No man that's born of woman shall e'er have power upon thee."
Then fly, false thanes...
...and mingle with the English epicures!
Our country sinks beneath the yoke.
It weeps, it bleeds.
And each new day a gash is added to her wounds.
Each new morn new widows howl, new orphans cry.
New sorrows strike heaven on the face...
...that it resounds as if it felt with Scotland.
Who comes here?
A countryman who seems a stranger to us.
My ever gentle cousin.
Welcome hither.
- Stands Scotland where it did?
- Alas, poor country.
Afraid to know itself. It cannot be called our mother, but our grave.
- What's the newest grief?
- Each minute teems a new one.
- How does my wife?
- Well.
- And my children?
- Well too.
- The tyrant has not battered at them?
- No. They were well at peace.
Be not a niggard of speech.
How goes it?
Your eye in Scotland will create soldiers, make our women fight.
We are coming thither.
Gracious England hath lent us good Seyward and 10,000 men.
An older and a better soldier none that Christendom gives out.
Would I could answer this comfort with the like.
But I have words that will be howled out...
...where hearing should not catch them.
- What concern they?
- The main part pertains to you.
If it be mine, keep it not from me.
Quickly, let me have it.
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes slaughtered.
Merciful heaven.
What, man!
Ne'er put your hat upon your brows.
Give sorrow words.
My children too?
Wife, children, servants.
All that could be found.
- And I must be from thence. My wife?
- I have said.
Be comforted. Let's make us medicines of our great revenge...
...to cure this deadly grief.
He has no children.
All my pretty ones!
Did you say all?
Hell-kite! What, all my chickens and their dam at one fell swoop?
Dispute it like a man.
I shall do so, but I must also feel it as a man.
I cannot but remember such things were...
...that were most precious to me.
Did the heaven look on and would not take their part?
Sinful Macduff, they were struck for thee.
Not for their own demerits, but for mine, fell slaughter on their souls.
Heaven rest them now.
Be this the whetstone of your sword.
Let grief convert to anger.
Blunt not the heart, enrage it!
Gentle heavens, cut short all intermission.
Front to front bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.
Our power is ready.
Macbeth is ripe for shaking.
Within my sword's length set him.
If he escape, heaven forgive him too.
- What does the tyrant?
- Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say he's mad. Others, that lesser hate him, call it valiant fury.
Those he commands move in command.
Nothing in love.
He feels his title hang loose about him...
...like a giant's robe upon a dwarfish thief.
All that is within him does condemn itself.
The English power is near, led by Malcolm, Seyward and Macduff.
Near Birnam Wood shall we meet them.
That way are they coming.
The devil damn thee black, thou loon!
Where gotst thou that goose look?
There is 10,000...
- Geese? Villain?
- Soldiers, sir.
Thou lily-livered boy.
What soldiers, patch?
Those linen cheeks of thine are counsellors to fear.
What soldiers, whey-face?
The English force, so please you.
Seyton! Take thy face hence.
I am sick at heart, when I behold...
Seyton, I say!
I have lived long enough.
My way of life is fallen
into the sear, the yellow leaf.
And that which should accompany
old age, as honour, love...
... obedience, troops of friends...
... I must not look to have.
But in their stead, curses...
... not loud, but deep.
Mouth-honour...
... breath which the poor heart
would fain deny and dare not.
- Seyton!
- What's your gracious pleasure?
- What news more?
- All is confirmed which was reported.
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked! Give me my armour!
- 'Tis not needed yet.
- I'll put it on.
Send out more horses, scour the country.
Hang those that talk of fear.
Come, put mine armour on, give me my sword.
Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, despatch.
If thou couldst, doctor, cast the water of my land...
...find her disease and purge it to a sound and pristine health.
I would applaud thee to the very echo that should applaud again.
Pull it off, I say.
What rhubarb, senna or what purgative drug...
...would scour these English hence?
Hearst thou of them?
Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation makes us hear something.
I will not be afraid of death or bane...
...till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear...
...profit again should hardly draw me here.
- What wood is this before us?
- The wood of Birnam.
"They met me in the day of success.
And I have learned by the perfect'st report...
...they have more in them than mortal knowledge.
While I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came...
...missives from the king, who all-hailed me, Thane of Cawdor...
...by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me...
...and referred me to the coming on of time with:
'Hail, king that shall be! '
This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner...
...that thou mightst not be...
...ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
The cry is still, "They come!"
Our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn.
Here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not stuffed with those that should be ours...
...we might have met them dareful, and beat them backward.
What is that noise?
I've almost forgot the taste of fear.
The time has been, my senses would have cooled to hear a night-shriek.
My fell of hair...
...would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in it.
I have supped full with horrors.
Wherefore was that cry?
The queen, my lord, is dead.
She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
... creeps in this petty pace
from day to day...
... to the last syllable
of recorded time.
And all our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death.
Out, out, brief candle.
Life's but a walking shadow.
A poor player struts and frets his hour upon the stage...
...and then is heard no more.
It is a tale told by an idiot...
...full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
Gracious, my lord!
Thy story, quickly!
I should report that which I saw, but know not how.
Well? Say, sir.
As I did stand my watch,
I looked toward Birnam.
And anon, methought, the wood began to move.
Liar and slave!
Within a mile may you see it coming.
A moving grove.
If thou speakst false, upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive...
...till famine cling thee.
Fear not till Birnam Wood
do come to Dunsinane.
And now a wood comes
towards Dunsinane.
Every soldier hath downed a bough and bears it before him.
Thereby they shadow the number of their host...
...and make discovery err in report of them.
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun.
And wish the estate of the world
were now undone.
Ring the alarum bell!
Blow, wind! Come, wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our back.
Make all our trumpets speak.
Worthy Macduff, you, with young
Seyward, lead our first assault.
Tyrant, show thy face!
Let me find him, Fortune.
And more I beg not.
If thou be slain and with no sword of mine...
...my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
- What is thy name?
- Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
No, though thou callst thyself a hotter name than any in hell!
My name's Macbeth!
The devil could not pronounce a title more hateful.
- No, nor more fearful.
- Thou liest, abhorred tyrant!
With my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speakst.
Thou werest born of woman.
They have tied me to the stake.
I cannot fly. But bearlike
I must fight the course!
Why should I play the Roman fool and die on mine own sword...
...while I see lives that gashes do better on them?
What's he that was not born of woman?
Such a one am I to fear, or none.
Turn, hell-hound! Turn!
Of all men else, I have avoided thee.
I have no words.
My voice is in my sword.
Thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out!
My soul...
...is too much charged with blood of thine already.
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests.
I bear a charmed life...
...which must not yield to one of woman born!
Despair thy charm and let the angel whom thou hast served tell thee...
...Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripped.
Accursed be that tongue
that tells me so...
... for it hath cowed
my better part of man.
And be these juggling fiends no more
believed that palter with us.
That keep the word of promise
to our ear and break it to our hope.
I will not yield...
...to kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet...
...and to be baited with the rabble's curse!
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane...
...and thou opposed being of no woman born...
...yet I will try the last.
Lay on, Macduff.
And damned be him that first cries,
"Hold, enough!"
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
Hail, king, for so thou art.
Behold where lies the usurper's cursed head.
The time is free.
Hail, King of Scotland!
Hail, King of Scotland!

François!
Francesco!
François?
François. François.
He's ill!
What's happened to you? Speak to me.
He's come back from the war because he's ill.
He's not a coward! He...
- My dear son.
- Come on!
Come, come.
Francesco, please!
Come on!
We've been riding all night, too.
- All night?
- Yeah, on a girl, not on a horse.
And tomorrow, we'll be riding to battle.
We must be mad.
Is it true if we win the battle, we get all the girls we want?
Of course!
That's what wars are made for.
Kill the enemy and get the ladies!
It's getting late.
Let's go home and prepare.
Wars are serious business.
Such profundity, Bernardo.
Why?
Why?
Bernardo.
What a pity.
It's over.
Yes. It's a pity... but I hope we'll live to see another dawn like this.
The last night of our youth.
Do you realize that?
We tried so desperately to make it never end.
We should've stopped the sun from rising.
Come on, Francesco!
Wait!
Leave me alone.
Please.
Brothers!
Brothers!
Lepers.
Yes. Lepers.
No!
I don't want to feed them!
Get them off!
No, no, no, no, no...
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh... you're not dressed yet?
What have you been doing up until now, eh?
Pica. Pica!
Will you please stop all this sissified nonsense?
The boy's going off to war.
Besides, I don't understand a damned word.
Why do you two always want to leave me out of everything?
Don't speak French when I'm around.
How many times...
If you wanted a wife who speaks like you, why didn't you marry some thick-headed butcher's daughter?
Bravo, François, bravo.
Forgive me, Father.
Forgive me, Father.
Hey, wait, we must talk.
What shall we do with all the money we'll make out of this war?
Have you thought of that?
Ah... I see.
A true son of his father, eh, Pica?
We are going to be late for mass, Monsignor.
Ah, they'll wait.
Listen, Francesco... out of the way, out of the way.
Francesco, w-when you're in Perugia, don't forget Ugoni's storerooms behind the marketplace, near the main tower.
He's as rich as the pope.
There's everything there.
Yes, yes, leave it to me.
Ooh, and Francesco.
What else?
Remember the triptych I told you about for the cathedral?
It'll save us a fortune in indulgences.
Yes.
Yes, war is beautiful.
This is my death mask.
Go forth, sons of Assisi.
God is with you!
Francesco!
Francesco!
Francesco!
Flowers in the meadow softly sway
And all the little birds sing merry May Day
Rabbits in the orchard sport and play
And all the little creatures smile and are gay
My little boy, sing out your joy
I am near, my dear
My darling, do not fear
Love is all around you
Comforting with gentle lullaby to make your heart sing.
What's he doing up there?
Oh, that's Bernardone's son.
Francesco!
Get down.
Francesco!
Francesco!
Francesco.
Francesco, what is it?
Francesco, my sweet, Francesco, what's happening to you, eh?
You can tell me.
We've always understood each other.
We...
We've always been close, you and...
Let me help you, my darling.
Well, sit down, sit down.
Take a drink.
Yes, business is booming.
Life's back to normal at last.
Yeah, talking about business,
I have some fine stuff to show you that you won't find anywhere but here.
Well, not anymore, that is.
Look at this tapestry.
It comes from Provence.
That's beautiful, isn't it?
Feel the texture of this material.
Now, I'd like you to compare this with one from Venice.
Ah! This one here.
Look at your hands.
Look at your hands!
Forgive me.
If I find one finger mark on any of my silks,
I'll beat you till you're black and blue, you dirty little pig!
Ah!
These servants are just like animals.
How's your son? Better now?
Oh, yes, thank God.
He's cost me a fortune in masses to our blessed Mary, but the worst is over now.
Now, there we are.
Oh, he's begun to get up, and one of these Sundays, you'll see him with us at mass.
Yes, please, please.
Take it into the light.
Do you remember me?
I'm Clare.
People say you're mad.
Do you know that?
When you went off to war, they said you were fine and intelligent.
But now you're mad, because... because you sing like the birds, and you chase after butterflies, and... and you-you look at flowers.
I think you were mad before, not now.
Am I disturbing you?
I'll go...
You see?
He talks with her.
Thanks be to God.
That's obviously what was wrong with him.
The boy needed a woman, eh?
Oh.
You look at things so clumsily, Monsignor.
His heart is waking.
Well, you can call it what you like, but if you ask me, that lad's after a woman.
That's why he's been acting strangely.
What a lovely creature Clare is.
Hmm. Not much of a catch, though.
Her father won't even give enough dowry to pay for a wedding.
Still, if that's what
Francesco wants, we'll find enough money for both of them, hey, Pica?
And you know what?
Yes.
I'm going to put him to work again.
But...
No buts. You've mollycoddled him long enough.
- But, Monsignor...
- Shh, shh, shh.
Besides, Francesco's always been very good at business.
He likes it.
He does.
He takes after me.
Always has done.
Come, come.
You shall see.
I followed your advice,
Francesco, to the very letter.
I bought and bought and... and bought.
And now, we prosper.
Oh, I may curse the war for having given you this, uh, this fever, but-but for business, it was a blessing.
Come, come.
You shall see.
What you're going to see now will send the blood coursing through your veins.
Better than all those potions and medicines the women give you.
Eh?
Go, go.
Look at that, eh, Francesco?
Look.
You see this? See?
And to think people speak badly of war.
Come, come.
I'll show you.
You know how it started, eh, Francesco?
With the war supplies.
And then, after the war, the soldiers came to sell their loot.
And then the wights who'd been looted by the soldiers came selling whatever they had left in order to rebuild, practically giving away things for nothing.
I'll show you,
I'll show you.
Look at these.
Look.
Francesco, see these, huh?
Family heirlooms, hmm?
Titled people.
On their knees, they were.
Cost me less than nothing.
And this is not all.
It's just the beginning.
And there's so much more than that.
Now we have enough money to manufacture and sell with nearly 200 workers... dyers, weavers.
Well, see for yourself.
It belongs to you, too,
Francesco.
Don't forget that.
God bless the master of this house
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay
Now milady, lady of
He be handsome, she be fair
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay
Bring them buttons and bells and bows...
A penny a rhyme will do me fine
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay
Tuppence a rhyme,
I told you so...
God bless the master of this house
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay...
Yes. Yes.
He invited them, if you please, out for a stroll, just like that.
He simply led them into the sunshine, and they sat there all afternoon.
Nobody did a stroke of work.
Oh.
And that-that... that simpleton, that-that idiot boy... he just... he just looked on.
He doesn't get it from me.
There's never been a history of insanity in my side of the family.
I've had enough of your high and mighty ways.
You're not in noble
Provence now, madam, and you'll not play the great lady in my house!
You've ruined that boy!
You've pampered him and spoiled him with your Frenchified airs and graces.
He's nothing more than a cringing idiot.
Something's got to be done, for God's sake, but not by you!
You are a stupid, thick-headed, vulgar animal, that's what you are.
Don't you understand what Francesco needs?
He's desperate.
Oh, Jesus, when I think of my own youth,
I feel like flaying him alive.
That's typical of you.
Treat him like... like one... like one of your clerks who comes to you whenever you stamp.
But, but, but Francesco's not like that, Monsignor.
- No?
- No, no.
And what's more, all the fathers and mothers of Assisi envy us such a son.
So... so sensitive, so intelligent.
Ah.
This is the, uh, envy of Assisi, huh?
Now you've gone far enough!
No, Monsignor.
No son of mine, do you understand, however mad, is gonna behave like this.
Have you no respect for me, huh?!
You will obey me in everything!
And if you do not,
I will crush you
- within an inch of your life!
- No!
Is that clear?
Is that understood?
And... And starting tomorrow morning, you'll come with us to mass, even if I have to drag you there like a dog!
Come on, sit up.
No!
No!
No...
No.
It's... It's mine!
This one.
All of it!
And this.
Out of the way!
Where is he?
Where is he?!
It will never make you happy!
Throw it all away!
Burn it, my brothers, all of it.
You...
But he doesn't realize what he's doing, Monsignor.
Be patient.
Father...
Father, I want to share my joy with you.
Our treasures are in Heaven, Father, not here on Earth.
Don't be a slave to these.
Throw it all away.
Do as I do.
It's so simple.
Be free.
Father... no...
No!
Oh! Stop it!
Stop it!
You lunatic!
No. No, my brothers.
Don't touch that.
Throw it into the gutter.
Throw it all away!
It will only make you miserable.
Look at my poor father.
Quiet, you idiot.
Call the guards.
See how he struggles.
I want to see him hang in the public square!
It's Pietro di Bernardone.
His son's gone mad.
What is all this commotion?
Di Bernardone's son, he's gone berserk.
Has he only found that out now?
Oh, anyway, you'd better alert the guards.
He's out of his mind.
What's the matter with you, Bernardone?
Have you gone mad as well?
I want justice, and I want it here, now, in front of all Assisi.
Well, it would be helpful to know the charge.
What has the justice of men to do with me?
God is my only judge.
Well, unfortunately, He isn't around to help us out.
Why not go to Bishop Guido, hmm?
Do you think I'm going to interrupt my meal because of some sordid family squabble?
What heresy.
Your Grace...
Oh, tell them I'm out.
Say I'm praying or something.
But the whole town is down there.
They insist that the church intervene.
It's becoming an outrageous scandal.
I really believe...
Guards!
I've only just got over Lent, and here you all are imposing another on me.
But, Your Grace...
Have it kept hot.
God's teeth!
Can a man not be left alone to dine in peace in his own home?
The bishop's coming.
Pietro di Bernardone, this will not do.
How dare you disturb us when we are in the middle of saying our office.
What's the matter with you, man?
Have you lost your senses?
It's not my fault, Your Grace.
It's him... that lunatic there.
Yes... it's me.
My soul is in your hands.
What?
Are you trying to cause trouble?
Is that what you're trying to do?
Is this some damned plot to rob the church of its authority?
That's nothing to what he's done to me, Your Grace.
I mean, God only knows,
I've always given him the best.
I, I, I brought him up.
I, I... I clothed him.
I...
I mean, you ask anyone.
They'll tell you.
He's never wanted for anything since the day he was born.
But today, he threw all my belongings out of the window!
And he even opened my strongbox!
Oh!
Thrown to a mob of cutthroats like himself down in the street.
Years of hard work and self-sacrifice just... just tossed away.
Then what is the answer to these accusations?
Surely you are sufficiently intelligent to understand that Holy Mother Church must punish those who subvert the established order.
A man such as you is a... is a menace to society.
He's either criminal or...
Or someone seeking the light.
Someone in darkness.
I was in darkness.
But Brother Sun illuminated my soul.
And now,
I can see so clearly.
Just as you did the day you chose the sacred vestments you are wearing now.
Are you seeking holy orders?
Me?
No. No.
I'm not worthy.
Then what do you want?
I want to be... to be happy.
I want to live like the birds in the sky.
I want to experience the freedom and the purity that they experience.
The rest is of no use to me.
No use.
Believe me.
If the purpose of life is this loveless toil we fill our days with, then it's not for me.
There must be something better.
There has to be.
Man is... is a spirit.
He has a soul.
And that, that is what
I want to recapture... my soul.
I want to live.
I want to live in the fields.
Stride over hills.
Climb trees, swim rivers.
I want to feel the firm grasp of the earth beneath my feet without shoes, without possessions.
Without those shadows we call our servants.
I want to be a beggar.
Yes.
Yes, a beggar.
Christ was a beggar, and his holy apostles were beggars.
I want to be as, as free as they are.
But, Your Grace, even beggars show respect for their fathers.
I'm not your son anymore.
What?
What is born of the flesh is flesh.
What is born of the Spirit is spirit.
I now... am born again.
Father, I give you back everything that belongs to you:
Your clothes... your possessions.
Your name, too.
There are no more fathers.
There are no more sons.
And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or fathers, or mothers, or children, or fields, for the sake of our heavenly Father will receive a hundred times more in the life to come.
Cover him.
Cover him up.
Hey, come and see!
Look at the crusader.
Bernardo di Quintavalle?
Welcome.
Welcome home.
As I am presenting the keys of the city to the emperor, it would hardly be very bright of me to present them from the rear, would it?
Besides, this is not a religious ceremony.
My dear governor,
Otto of Brunswick is going to Rome to be crowned emperor by His Holiness.
How can you possibly say this is not a religious ceremony?
God moves in mysterious ways, my dear secretary, and He has arranged, on this occasion, that I move forward.
Ah! This is... pure blasphemy!
What? Do you suggest you are in direct communication with the Word of God?!
Sylvestro.
Come here, Sylvestro.
Paolo.
Something really marvelous has happened.
Guess what.
What?
Bernardo's back.
Yes! He rode in through the gates half an hour ago.
He looks... fantastic.
Yes.
...and I will make the speech of welcome.
Let's not discuss it further.
Everyone will have his assigned place.
But, but you are here.
Mm-hmm.
Streets ahead of me.
He couldn't have arrived at a more appropriate time.
Let's meet tonight and celebrate.
Giocondo, you arrange it.
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.
Hey! Bernardo!
How do you like your chicken?
Leg? Or breast?
The only one of us that's stayed the same.
It's all show.
He's trying to go back to his youth.
Why else would he choose this place to celebrate your return from the crusade?
Crusades are nothing to sing about, I assure you.
Oh, come on, Bernardo, you're, you're famous.
You're a war hero.
I say, you must have slaughtered thousands of Muslims.
What?
How many, at a rough guess, would you say that you killed?
Too many.
Oh.
Where's Francesco?
Oh, uh...
He doesn't live in Assisi anymore, Bernardo.
I gathered that, but...
What's happening?
Where is Francesco?
Oh, you're not still talking about him, are you?
We told you, he's mad.
What do you mean, he's mad?
Don't take any notice of him, Bernardo.
He's pissed, as usual.
But Francesco isn't mad, is he, Paolo?
No.
He's not mad.
He's... He's changed.
He is mad.
A raving bloody lunatic.
Only a lunatic will believe that God Himself had come down from heaven to talk to him.
Right?
Listen, God has spoken to lots of people sometimes.
How interesting.
And I suppose you think that God personally decided that San Damiano should be the first church in His rebuilding program.
San Damiano...? Rebuil...?
Is that where he's living?
Well, y-yes, I, I suppose so.
Is he all right?
Surely... Surely to God one of you went along to-to see him, speak to him.
You must have done something.
Look, he...
He is our oldest...
...and dearest friend.
He might need our help, for God's sake.
Bernardo, listen to me, not Giocondo, he's drunk.
Francesco's not mad.
Maybe he's very sane indeed.
But you are a hero of the crusades.
You can't afford to have your name associated with his.
- What?!
- None of us can.
Francesco's been a great friend to us all, but... quite simply, we have nothing in common anymore.
It's hard to remember now, but Europe was like this in 1944.
The Second World War was in its fifth year...
...and still going Hitler's way.
German troops controlled most of Europe.
D-Day changed all that.
D-Day: June 6, 1944...
...when the Allied forces, under their commander General Eisenhower...
...landed on the northern coast of France.
By July they were able to begin their own offensive.
By August, Paris was liberated.
Everywhere the Germans retreated.
But with the Allied victories came problems.
Supplies still had to be driven from Normandy, over 400 miles away...
...and became dangerously short.
The Allied advance began to come to a halt.
Another problem facing Eisenhower was this:
His two most famous generals...
Patton, who was in the south...
...and Montgomery in the north... disliked each other intensely.
The longstanding rivalry had never been more fierce.
There simply were not enough supplies for both armies.
Each wanted to be the one to defeat the Germans.
Each wanted to beat the other to Berlin.
In September, 1944...
Montgomery devised a new and spectacular plan...
...given the code name
"Market Garden."
Eisenhower, under great pressure from his superiors...
...finally sided with Montgomery...
...and Operation Market Garden became a reality.
The plan, like so many plans in so many wars before it...
...was meant to end the fighting by Christmas...
...and bring the boys back home.
What is that noise?
- Can I look out?
- No, they might shoot us.
The Germans have collapsed.
Then the war is over?
Soon.
But what is that noise?
Panic.
You may begin.
May I first be permitted to say, and I think I speak for all of us...
...how pleased we are,
Field Marshal Von Rundstedt...
...that you have been reappointed commander of our forces in the West.
Speeches are for victory celebrations.
Let's get to the point.
Air power?
Air power, Field Marshal?
Briefly, please.
- Air power is minimal.
- Ammunition?
Also minimal.
Tanks... Troops...
Replacements?
- Minimal.
- Morale?
Nonexistent.
What do you think we should do?
End the war, you fools.
- Why in the world are you laughing?
- Excuse us.
We have such confidence in you.
Everyone knows you have never lost a battle.
I'm still young.
Give me time.
The first thing we must do...
...is to turn this rabble into something like an army.
Anything at all on when they plan to invade Holland?
They seem to have paused in Belgium.
Most likely supply problems.
Otherwise we can't imagine why.
I think it's because we're retreating...
...faster than they can advance.
How many vehicles in the past hour?
Fifty-four.
And for the same hour yesterday?
Ninety-eight.
Last week your mother and I could have captured Holland alone.
Already the panic has stopped.
It isn't over yet and those idiots don't realize it.
- War takes time.
- Listen to the expert.
I was nine when they got here.
Next month I'll be 14.
I ought to know something.
Father, the Allies will come?
But when?
I've just got back to England from Brussels...
...where I had a meeting this morning with Field Marshal Montgomery.
There was an earlier one with General Eisenhower.
They both feel, as I do...
...that when the Field Marshal's plan has succeeded...
...we should be able to end the war by Christmas...
...in less than 100 days.
Actually, the plan is really very simple.
We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles, and drop them behind enemy lines.
It'll be the largest airborne operation ever mounted.
Quite frankly, this kind of thing's never been attempted before.
- Where's this all going to take place?
- Holland.
- And when?
- I'm coming to that now.
Right.
The ground forces: 30 Corps, commanded by General Horrocks, 20,000 vehicles.
And this, as you know, is the German front line.
Now we're going to lay a carpet, as it were, of airborne troops...
...over which 30th Corps can pass.
We shall seize the bridges... it's all a question of bridges...
With thunderclap surprise...
...and hold them until they can be secured.
Now first of all,
General Maxwell Taylor...
...Eindhoven.
You take and hold the bridges there with 101 st.
General Gavin, with your 82nd...
...you get Nijmegen.
You take and hold the bridges.
And Roy, you get the prize:
Arnhem.
Arnhem Bridge.
- And you hold it.
- For how long?
Monty assures me that 30 Corps...
...will do the 63 miles in two days.
Sixty-three miles in two days.
- They oughta be able to handle that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
General Sosabowski, you go with your Polish Brigade with Roy Urquhart.
I'm so sorry.
Roy...
...when you've secured your bridge...
...and 30th Corps have got across it, we can turn east...
...right into the industrial heart of Germany... the Ruhr.
Once we control their factories, there's not much they can do about it.
And that is the plan.
And we go next Sunday.
Seven days?
Why not?
The sooner we go, the better.
We've got them on the run.
Is something troubling you,
General Sosabowski?
- I've said nothing.
- Precisely.
Your silences are thunderous.
General Browning, I...
I am a Pole...
...considered by some to be smart.
If that is so...
...it makes me member of a true minority group.
Minority groups are more comfortable in silence.
I should have thought the opposite was true. But you do disapprove?
I am thrilled that your great Field
Marshal Montgomery has devised a plan.
I promise you, I'll be properly ecstatic if it works.
When it works.
Of course.
When it works.
Thank you.
Well, now let's get down to the details.
First we shall have to have...
From which direction will their attack come, and who will command?
Montgomery or Patton?
- Model, what do you think?
- Patton.
He is their best.
Patton will lead the assault.
I would prefer Montgomery...
...but even Eisenhower isn't that stupid.
Bittrich's panzer troops need some rest...
...if they're to stop Patton.
We should pull them back somewhere safe.
Safe, quiet, out of the way.
But where?
Arnhem?
Arnhem.
- I'll be in touch.
- That'll be fine.
Why the emergency meeting?
- Keeping abreast of the little changes.
- How big are the little changes?
I'll answer you with typical
British understatement: gigantic.
They can't get us all in at once.
Too many men, too much equipment, not enough planes.
It's going to take three days to get the men into Arnhem, Poles and the British.
- How about us?
- We'll be all right.
Aside from the fact that we'll parachute in daylight, we have no worries.
Daylight?
- Has it ever been tried before?
- Not in a major drop.
- Think there might be a reason for that?
- Let's hope not.
- What do you think?
- It'll be all right.
It's a "no moon" period anyway.
We have to go in daylight.
Just so they get us over the target area, half a mile away.
Three-quarters of a mile...
I'll settle for that.
I don't want to hear anything else.
- Is there anything else?
- Well, you're my Dutch advisor, Harry.
I forgot to tell you something?
Only that the Germans first tried to take Nijmegen Bridge themselves...
...back in 1940, and got slaughtered.
Go back!
Go back!
Do as I say!
But my friend lives down the road.
It's my birthday and she has a present for me.
Please let me through.
All right. Be quick.
Are you sure about the colors?
I'm sure, Father.
Believe me.
Model?
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?
The British will have an explanation.
Did you pass on the message about the tanks?
Of course. But Model is something more important.
You're a good boy and a wonderful spy.
Now go and help your mother with supper.
- Sir?
- Yes, Fuller?
- We've got some information on tanks.
- What?
Dutch Underground reports from the Arnhem area.
- Established their strength?
- No, sir, but I've got...
- Have they been identified?
- Not by our intelligence, sir.
So it's the same rumors as before, right?
- I believe these rumors, sir.
- Why?
The general consensus of opinion is that our opposition...
...will consist entirely of Hitler Youth or old men on bicycles.
I don't really know why, sir.
Perhaps because no one in Intelligence does.
I just want to be sure our airborne carpet...
...consists of live troops, not dead ones.
I know everybody thinks
I'm overanxious, sir...
...but I would like to order another low-level reconnaissance of the area.
If that's all right with you, sir.
Very well.
All right, Wilson.
Very well.
I wouldn't be too concerned about what people think of you.
You happen to be somewhat brighter than most of us.
Tends to make us nervous.
Naturally we'll do our utmost to meet your tactical requirements, sir.
But please keep in mind...
...the one factor which is crippling all our plans.
It may seem improbable to you...
...but we are desperately short of transport aircraft.
I am aware of that.
I was surprised that nobody mentioned it to Monty when he dreamed up this plan.
I need drop zones as close as possible to the bridge.
This area's no use at all.
Can't have my chaps landing on chimney tops, but this looks inviting here.
- What's the terrain like?
- Sorry, sir.
Our reports indicate that this terrain is too soft for glider landings.
The nose digs in first on touchdown, the thing goes ass over tip.
Total write-off.
All right.
- What about there?
- Afraid not, sir.
You see, after the drop, when we bank for our return...
...we run into a whole lot of flak...
...from this Jerry airfield up here at Deelen.
Presumably you're intending to let us land somewhere?
Oh, yes.
Hopefully, sir.
But as I was saying, we cannot afford to lose a single aircraft.
That is the problem.
My problem is,
I don't just need drop zones.
I need drop zones
I can hold and defend.
The rest of my division arrives with the second drop...
...and General Sosabowski's
Polish Brigade with the third.
I understand, sir, but we really think we've found the right place.
It's large enough for your needs, it's flat and firm.
- It's also easily defended.
- Where the hell is it?
Well, it's not actually on this photograph.
It should be...
Excuse me, sir...
It would be about here,
I think.
That could be ten miles from the bridge.
It's just under eight actually, sir, if you'd like to have a look at this.
You see, the terrain is easy to traverse.
All our information substantiates that.
Yes, sir?
Just making sure whose side you're on.
Now, a drop zone eight miles from Arnhem Bridge...
...might be thought by some to present problems.
My God, he can't mean it.
I'm afraid he does.
Must know what he's doing.
That's more than I know. Why should he have a corner on the market?
...cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered ideal.
But the gliders will be bringing in a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps...
...specially fitted with twin Vickers machine guns.
The instant we land, they will race ahead to the bridge...
...and hold it...
...until the other battalions arrive on foot.
And they'll be quick enough to secure both ends of Arnhem Bridge?
- Most certainly.
- Good.
My headquarters will be in the center with 82nd.
Now, just you remember that we're all totally interlocked.
This is a bottom-to-top operation.
101 st pass 30 Corps on to 82nd.
82nd pass them on to British Airborne.
If any one group fails, it's total failure for us all.
All we need now are three days of clear skies.
Thank you, gentlemen, very much.
Only the weather can stop us now.
Weather! Cristos! 
What of the Germans?
Don't you think that since we know...
...that Arnhem is so crucial to their safety, they might know that too?
Now look here.
The few troops in the area are...
...second class.
They're not front-line caliber.
Not at all.
Do you understand?
You ought to have more faith in Montgomery's intelligence reports.
He's done pretty well for us in the last three or four years.
I will tell you the extent of my faith.
I'm thinking of asking for a letter from you...
...stating that I was forced to act on your orders...
...in case my men are massacred.
I see.
Yes, I do see.
Do you wish such a letter?
Of course not.
In the case of massacre, what difference would it make?
- You don't believe me, sir?
- Clearly not.
All right, boys, Naafi's up.
Take your break.
God Almighty!
Sorry about that, sir.
But what then?
I just don't believe these damn radios are strong enough...
...to carry the eight miles from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.
Don't happen to have any cigarettes, do you, sir?
They're perfectly okay.
I've used them God knows how many times.
You've already told me that
God knows how many times.
Well, I didn't have any problems with them in the desert.
Yes, I know, but you see, Cole...
...what genuinely and truly has me more than a bit disturbed is that Holland...
...being half underwater, is soggier than most deserts you're apt to find.
Tends to have a lot more trees.
- Any biscuits?
- Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.
Shouldn't you tell the general if you're so certain about it, sir?
If I were, believe me, I would.
- What if they really don't work?
- What difference will it make?
The general will be on the bridge himself by nightfall.
He won't have to make contact with the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?
Well, if anyone rocks the boat...
...it's not gonna be me.
The regular projector chap's at lunch, sir. I'll have it in a moment.
You're doing splendidly, Fuller.
Don't worry. I don't need lunch.
Damn. Nearly there, sir.
It's really worth your time, sir.
Believe me.
There.
Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
Can't see any tanks.
Wait a moment, sir.
It's a lot clearer in the next picture.
If I can just...
Now.
- Next.
- Yes, sir.
I've had this one enlarged.
I shouldn't worry about them.
But, sir, you see that they are tanks.
I doubt if they're fully serviceable.
- Still got guns.
- So have we.
But, sir...
...if they weren't serviceable, why would they try to conceal them?
Normal routine, Fuller.
But, sir, we keep getting reports from the Dutch Underground.
I've read them!
And so has Field Marshal Montgomery.
Now look here.
There have been thousands of photographs from this sortie and from the others.
- How many of them have shown tanks?
- Just these, sir.
And you seriously consider asking us to cancel...
...the biggest operation mounted since D-Day...
...because of three photographs?
No, sir.
Sixteen consecutive drops have been cancelled in the last few months...
...for one reason or another.
But this time the party's on...
...and no one is going to call it off.
Is that fully understood?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Waddy.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Do sit down, gentlemen.
Please sit down.
Look after these.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, this is a story that you will tell your grandchildren...
...and mightily bored they'll be.
The plan is called
Operation Market Garden.
Market is the airborne element, and Garden the ground forces...
That's us.
Now this is our position on the Belgian border here.
Tomorrow, three airborne divisions will begin landing in Holland...
Thirty-five thousand men taking off from 24 airfields...
...in troop-carrying planes or towed in gliders.
The American 101 st here...
...around Eindhoven...
...the American 82nd here...
...south of Nijmegen...
...and our own 1 st Airborne boys and a Polish brigade...
...here at Arnhem...
...sixty-four miles...
...behind enemy lines.
Now, their job is to take and hold...
...all the bridges in these three areas.
Our job is to punch a hole...
...through the German front line here...
...and then drive like hell up this road...
...linking up with each airborne division on the way up.
Speed is the vital factor.
The plan is to reach Eindhoven in two to three hours...
...and Arnhem in two to three days.
That, gentlemen, is the prize:
The bridge over the Rhine...
...the last bridge between us and Germany.
Kickoff will be at 1435 hours tomorrow afternoon.
The Irish Guards, under the command of
Colonel Vandeleur, will take the lead.
- Christ, not us again.
- What do you say to that, Joe?
Delighted, sir.
Truly delighted.
I've selected you to lead us...
...not only because of your extraordinary fighting ability...
...but also because...
...in the unlikely event that the Germans ever get you...
...they'll assume from your attire that they've captured a wretched peasant...
...and immediately send you on your way.
Now, maintaining the speed of our advance...
...will no doubt be tough going, as it's a single highway.
But no matter what...
...we must reach those
1 st Airborne boys in 48 hours.
Now, gentlemen...
...I'm not saying that this will be the easiest party...
...that we've ever attended...
...but I still wouldn't miss it for the world.
I like to think of this...
...as one of those
American Western films.
The paratroops, lacking substantial equipment...
...always short of food...
These are the besieged homesteaders.
The Germans... well, naturally they're the bad guys.
And 30 Corps...
We, my friends, are the cavalry...
...on the way to the rescue.
Do you want me to pack that as well, sir?
No, thank you, Wicks.
I'll carry it.
You haven't forgotten my golf clubs, have you?
They'll be coming later in the staff car, sir.
And what about...
Sorry, sir?
What about my dinner jacket?
Are you sure you'll be needing that, sir?
Well, let's hope so.
Why don't you quit that?
Chock-full of vitamins.
Here, Eddie.
Have a little strength.
Hey, where'd you put that?
- Damn it, Eddie, give it back.
- Right.
There you are.
I wish you hadn't done that.
My problem is, I'm not totally crazy about the prospect of dyin'.
So don't die.
Drinkin' that garbage isn't gonna keep you alive.
What is?
- Not gettin' shot.
- And what can guarantee that?
Nothin', for sure.
- You will.
- I will what?
You tell me, Eddie.
You tell me I won't die.
All right, you won't die.
No, no. Guarantee me.
I want you to guarantee me
I won't die.
I guarantee you.
Come on.
Let's get some food in you.
I wasn't kidding.
Hey, Eddie, were you kidding?
Major Fuller.
My name is Sims.
Mind a bit of company?
Of course not, sir.
Busy times.
You must be exhausted.
Are you exhausted?
Who isn't?
We've been getting reports from a number of your friends.
They're worried about you.
They think perhaps you need a rest.
We all need rest.
Why are you saying this to me?
Is it because
I rocked the boat?
I'm a doctor.
I'm only concerned with your health.
I think perhaps you ought to take a bit of sick leave.
But why?
I'm not ill or anything.
I haven't done anything wrong.
Of course not.
You're just a little tired.
I am tired.
I think perhaps we might go.
Can't it be stopped?
I don't want to be left behind, please.
It's out of my hands, laddie.
I didn't want to miss the party.
Move it, buddy.
That's the way.
Home, sweet home.
When you think we only had seven days to get everything organized, it's quite a...
Boody miracle.
It took six months to set up the D-Day drop...
...and that was only half as big as this.
- How do you feel?
- Fine.
I'll feel even better when we're in Holland.
Do you remember when I was appointed to this command...
...I told you I had never jumped, but thought I ought to give it a go?
- Well, you did me a big favor.
- Really? What?
You said, "Roy, you're far too old for that kind of thing, and much too large."
Did I?
What was the favor?
Well, I didn't quite tell you everything at the time...
...but I'm prone to airsickness.
Good gracious.
What, every flight?
Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?
Go on! Get that goddamn jeep outta here!
Who would true valor see
Let him come hither
One here will constant be
Come wind
Come weather
There's no discouragement
Soon be home, Harry.
- Better than the desert, eh, sir?
- What was that?
Easier than walking, sir.
If you say so, Hancock.
Yeah, fine, sir.
The artillery should be able to clear the way very well. Your initial advance.
Yes, we'll move off as soon as their barrage has got going.
- Yes, that's absolutely fine.
- Follow behind it as close as we can.
But you know...
...this isn't gonna be the pushover that everybody seems to think it is.
No, I didn't think so.
Morning, Alan. Your sleeping beauties know there's a war on, do they?
Absolutely, sir.
Is it true that the Germans have put more troops into the line ahead of us?
Yes. They obviously don't intend to just let us walk in the front door.
Hello, Bob! Hope that's not my funeral they're going to.
And I'm still desperately worried...
...about having them throw everything up this road.
But there's no alternative.
Morning, Tom.
So I've decided to run the road like a railway.
Nobody, repeat, nobody will be allowed...
...to put any vehicle on that road without my permission.
- Including me?
- Good luck to you!
You too!
Especially you, Joe.
Morning, Derek!
Glad to see somebody knows where we're going.
Time, Joe.
That's the killer.
We can't afford to drop behind schedule.
So for God's sake, keep your tanks on the move.
Good God Almighty.
That's just the 101 st.
The other two groups are on the northern route.
H hour in 90 minutes.
- I'd better be going, sir.
- Right you are, Joe.
- Any last-minute changes, Bob?
- Yes, sir.
If the advance runs into difficulty, we call in the Air Force with purple smoke.
First class.
And good luck, Joe!
Thank you, sir.
Think you'll be able to manage it?
I've got nothing else planned for this afternoon.
I told you you should have had the bloody thing out.
What the hell's that?
It's flak.
General Bittrich!
In here, Matthias.
Fantastic, isn't it?
Just once to have such power in my hands.
Red on.
Come on, move yourselves!
If there's no more opposition than this on the road, we should be all right.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
B Company, to me!
A Company, over there!
Excuse the interruption,
Field Marshal, but...
...British paratroopers have landed...
...three kilometers from here.
Why should they do that?
There is nothing important here.
Me! I am important.
They must all be coming just to capture me.
Call my chauffeur and car.
Evacuate the headquarters.
And don't forget my cigars.
General!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Okay, you guys, gather your stuff and move!
- This is it, Jim.
- Okay, sir.
You okay?
Right! Let's go!
Then keep trying.
There must be someone there!
My apologies.
I can get no sense from anybody.
They say thousands of troops are dropping over Holland.
- Yes, west of Arnhem.
- Right on top of Field Marshal Model.
I can't get through to his headquarters.
A strong force has landed south of Nijmegen.
Nijmegen?
They're after the bridge.
That doesn't matter.
Perhaps they've landed in the Field Marshal's soup.
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Now listen.
I'll take care of Arnhem.
You get to Nijmegen as fast as you can.
Take anything that'll move...
...every man that can walk, and hold the bridge.
No. Field Marshal Model.
Nothing must cross it.
Is that clear?
You must hold that bridge under any circumstances.
- Understood?
- Clear.
Ryan and Ross, come with me.
Cover the right flank.
How far away is headquarters?
Half a mile.
Maybe more.
Brigadier Lathbury's just left, sir.
Johnny Frost and the 2nd Battalion are on the river road.
Good.
Thank you, Baker. Any news of
Freddie Gough's jeep squadron?
- It's unconfirmed...
- It's rather bad luck, sir.
Considering how few gliders we lost on the way in.
It appears that a lot of the special jeeps failed to arrive...
...and those that did have been badly shot up in an ambush.
So no one's going to get to Arnhem Bridge except on foot.
Splendid.
They must be from the lunatic asylum, located on the far side of the wood.
They escaped when it was bombed this morning.
Do you think they know something we don't?
All guns, commence firing!
Right, get moving.
Get moving.
Driver, advance.
Start the purple!
Start the purple!
Take cover!
- Loading!
- Fire!
Get the wounded down the line.
Get that wreck off the road.
Joe, how the hell...
How the hell do they expect us to keep to schedule on a road like this?
You don't know the worst.
- This bit we're on now...
- Yes?
It's the wide part.
Peter, the general's coming in.
- How's it going now?
- Not too well, sir.
We haven't been able to make contact with General Browning...
...30 Corps or England.
So no one knows we've arrived safely.
Not as far as we know, sir.
What about those VHF sets?
Well, sir, it appears the sets have been delivered with the wrong crystals.
- So they're quite useless?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid they are.
Are Brigadier Lathbury and Colonel Frost aware of what happened...
...to the special jeep squadron?
- Not as far as we know.
At the moment we're unable to contact any of the units moving into Arnhem.
Not a very satisfactory state of affairs.
We can't quite understand it.
It's perfectly good equipment.
Then for God's sake, get it sorted out...
...before we have a bloody disaster on our hands.
Sir.
Hancock...
...I've got lunatics laughing at me from the woods.
My original plan has been scuppered now that the jeeps haven't arrived.
My communications have completely broken down.
Do you really believe that any of that can be helped...
...by a cup of tea?
Couldn't hurt, sir.
Forgive me for returning,
Field Marshal.
I must press for permission...
...if it becomes necessary...
...to blow up the bridges at Arnhem and Nijmegen.
That is out of the question.
Never.
Is that clear?
We need them for our counterattack.
Counterattack?
With what?
Paratroopers cannot fight long.
They are too lightly equipped.
Isolated they are lost.
I have spoken to Von Rundstedt.
All reinforcements come to us first.
Every hour we get stronger and they grow weaker.
- But if we blow the bridges...
- They don't want the bridges.
Do you really think if they wanted the bridges...
...they would have landed
12 kilometers away?
It's ridiculous.
Thank you for the tea.
Our lightning-like assault on Arnhem Bridge...
...is certainly a smashing success.
I've an aversion to apples.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sure the Germans will be thunderstruck with surprise.
- Are there many of you?
- Yes, there are thousands of us.
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.
Look here, this isn't a victory parade.
Come on, sir, enjoy the moment.
I will enjoy the moment when we reach the bridge...
...and when we find the bridge intact.
It will be.
Things couldn't be going better.
- Nothing's wrong.
- I know. That's exactly what is wrong.
Jesus Christ!
Stay down!
Shit.
There's still no contact.
Then keep at it.
I shall be back shortly.
Brigadier Lathbury can't have gone that far. All right, Brown.
I'm sure we'll have them fixed by the time you get back, sir.
Can you get a message down to 30th Corps on that dingus?
Yes, sir. We just got word from the 82nd up ahead.
They've captured the Grave Bridge completely intact.
That's terrific, except 30th Corps...
...ain't about to reach the goddamn intact Grave Bridge...
...until the goddamn Son Bridge gets fixed.
Tell our British cousins to hustle up some Bailey stuff.
I'll meet 'em in Eindhoven when they get there.
Tell those schmucks to do this right and have their Bailey stuff at the front.
Got that?
And be sure to say please.
Joe, I make it just over six miles to Eindhoven.
We won't make it tonight.
It'll be dark shortly.
Well, I hope to God the 101 st can hang on till tomorrow.
Giles, remember what the general said:
"We're the cavalry."
It would be bad form to arrive in advance of schedule.
In the nick of time would do nicely.
These plans should have been left in England.
They're top secret.
And now we have all we need...
Units, defense plans, objectives...
...and the schedule for further drops.
I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge for demolition...
...if I blow it up tonight.
This Operation Market Garden must fail.
Why do all my generals want to destroy my bridges?
Come, Ludwig.
We'll have dinner.
Dinner?
But what about these plans?
These plans?
They are false.
Just a trick.
We were supposed to find them.
White wine or red?
We're still getting nothing from Colonel
Frost's battalion on the river road.
- Thank you, Cole.
- Dog-Charlie-Fox. Over.
Let's hope Johnny's meeting less resistance than we are.
- We must break through to the bridge.
- We're completely blocked ahead of us.
There's a good deal more resistance than we've been led to expect.
I must see for myself how he's doing.
All right, Cole.
- What is their strength?
- I can't estimate yet.
Some Dutch Underground people were here earlier trying to explain the situation.
I'm not sure how much they know.
Stretcher bearer, bring that stretcher over here to these men!
- What about Brown?
- They've both had it.
Christ Almighty!
They've gone round behind us.
I think it might be safer if you spent the night with us.
- I've got to get back to H.Q.
- Yes, but alive, sir.
If we can reach them, there are some houses in that direction.
We can get ourselves organized and try and find out what's happening.
Pull him out!
- Right.
- Sergeant Major.
Come on, lads.
Get a move on.
- Something just occurred to me.
- What's that, sir?
We're wearing the wrong camouflage.
It's all very well for the country, but we won't fool anyone in the towns.
Come on.
I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid we're going to have to occupy your house.
- All right, chaps, we're in here.
- The house on the other side.
- Section Two, over here.
- Dick.
Now, take your men, occupy that house across the road.
Make sure you can cover the bridge from your side.
Sergeant, follow me.
Hello, Dog-Charlie-Fox.
Rip down those curtains, pile this furniture against the window.
We've reached our objective.
What is your position? Over.
There's nothing.
I can't contact Brigade at all, sir.
Tried the other battalions?
Any luck?
Keep trying.
- Order them out.
- Please, Mother.
- This is my house.
- Perhaps by tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Yes, Mother.
Shall we have a go at the far end now, sir?
"Having a go" is hardly textbook terminology, Harry.
But you'll let us try, sir?
Down! Take cover!
Cover fire! Quick!
Smoke!
Come on, lads!
Come on. Keep going.
Give us a hand.
Fall back!
Hurry.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
We'll deal with them later...
...when it gets dark.
- Made it so far, Doddsie?
- Aye.
Better hit that slit first time.
Hey, Corp, I said you'd better hit that slit first time or...
I heard you, boyo.
Oh, great.
After you, Corp.
Come on.
Let's get on with it.
Now!
Now we're in trouble.
You bloody missed it!
You knocked my arm, you clumsy bastard.
Now we'll never get out of here.
We've hit an ammunition dump, a bloody ammo dump. Shit!
Fool's courage.
She says you are much too noisy.
She does realize there is something of a war going on, doesn't she?
She has never liked noise.
She hates it.
They're coming.
Excuse me.
Many of them?
Can't tell, sir.
We can only hear them at the moment.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Fire!
Command. Wait for the command.
Over there with it.
Look after that man.
Open fire! Fire!
Keep firing. Come on.
Cease firing.
Sorry, ma'am.
Try and rustle up some more bandages, will you?
Lad, you'll be all right.
See you later.
Get him patched up, Doc.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
- Wicks.
- Sir.
Right, off you go.
Get that bloody stretcher inside!
All right. Here we go.
Good morning. Mr. Cornish is straight through there.
Right. Thank you.
Hello, Dick.
It's all right. Sit down.
- You all right?
- Fine. It's only a flesh wound.
- How are things?
- Not too bad, sir.
What is bad is this.
- Careful.
- Sorry.
We hold the north end of the bridge.
The Germans hold the south.
But now they probably control most of the town...
...including the church tower.
What you're saying is that we're surrounded.
Yes, something like that.
- What else?
- Sir.
I was a bit surprised to find
Bittrich's panzer troops here, sir.
Yes, well, surely you didn't believe all that nonsense they told us.
I mean, about the enemy being made up of old men, children.
We'll have to risk it.
It's halfway through the morning, and things aren't getting any better.
- Sergeant, how is it?
- Sir.
We can't clear the streets.
Enemy strength keeps increasing. It's impossible to get through to the bridge.
Thanks, Sergeant.
It's imperative I get back to H.Q. before the situation gets out of hand.
If it's all right with you, Cleminson and I will come part of the way.
- All right, Jimmy?
- Let's move.
End house, bottom window, sir.
Cleminson, get over here.
Hang on, Gerald.
In here. Come on.
Can't you move your legs?
Must be the spine.
Can you help us?
- How?
- Don't you know a doctor nearby?
We can take him to the hospital.
You go. He will be fine.
Go, sir.
You go.
Go up.
They're certainly at the back.
What's it like at the front?
We're surrounded.
Yes. Quite.
I was rather expecting to see you again, General Sosabowski.
Do please sit down.
The Polish drop has been cancelled again. I would like an explanation.
Well, I expect the fog has a certain amount to do with it.
I'm told there are aircraft flying
50 miles to the south.
Explain to me why my men and equipment cannot be moved from here to there...
...and then fly to Arnhem.
That's a very reasonable question.
I don't want to bother you with a lot of meteorological mumbo jumbo...
...but the fact is, you see, whether we like it or not...
...fog... it moves.
Of course it moves. Where?
That's very difficult to say, General.
It's very slippery stuff, fog.
You think you've got it, then it reverses itself...
...and leaves you behind.
Won't you please sit down?
What I'm trying to say, General...
...is even if we move your troops the 50 miles...
I grant you, now the sun is shining...
...the chances are that by the time we get there...
...the fog could quite easily have preceded us.
- So we simply have to wait.
- And do nothing.
I think that puts it rather well.
Hey, you! You Vandeleur?
- Yeah.
- I'm Bobby Stout.
How do you do?
Hell of a day, huh?
Look at 'em... wild.
Have you ever been liberated?
- I got divorced twice. Does that count?
- Yes, that counts.
Hey, that Bailey crap.
You got it amongst this stuff?
When you refer to Bailey crap...
...I take it you mean that glorious precision-made British-built bridge...
...which is the envy of the civilized world.
- Yeah.
- The trucks are down there somewhere.
But how you're going to get them through this crowd, I don't know.
No problem. I got a side road pegged out that'll avoid all this.
- American ingenuity.
- Oh, really?
Actually I was born in Yugoslavia, but what the hell.
Yes.
Okay, I'll take it, sir.
- Where the hell have you been?
- With some Dutch friends at Nijmegen.
Look. This is why we can't take the bridge.
The Germans have moved in
S.S. panzer troops.
You'd think they didn't want us to get across or something.
They've sealed off the whole area.
Here. You can see on this map.
Every street leading to the bridge is blocked.
Every house around it is occupied.
The Dutch Underground people say it's just impossible to break through.
They could be right.
- Where's the captain?
- Dead.
I didn't ask you how he was.
I asked you where he was.
Orderly, we're all out of bandages over here.
- Sir.
- Not now.
- I'd like you to look at my captain.
- I'm sorry. Put him down.
What in the name of hell do you...
- You told me to put him down.
- I'm in no mood for crapping around.
If you don't look at him right now, he's going to die.
He's dead now.
It'd mean a lot to me if you'd check him out.
Come on, Sergeant.
For Christ's sake, get him out of here.
Would you look at him, please, sir...
...right now...
...or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Right now.
I can give him a quick examination, if you like.
Thank you very much, sir.
Son of a bitch.
Orderly!
Well, I got the bullet out of his skull.
- He's gonna live though, right?
- He's gonna have one hell of a headache.
Guess you can turn me in now, sir.
That was a court-martial offense.
You understand that?
- Yes, sir.
- Hope to hell it was worth it.
Guess only time will tell on that, sir.
My response is strictly limited, regardless of my personal preference.
- You understand that too?
- I do.
Like somebody cheating in school.
Once word gets out that you can behave any way you goddamn please...
...discipline's gone, forget about getting it back.
So you're gonna have to be arrested, over and out. Lieutenant Rafferty.
Yes, sir, Colonel.
Lieutenant Rafferty, this is Sergeant... What's your name?
Eddie Dohun.
Sergeant Dohun pulled a gun on me and threatened to kill me...
...unless I did precisely what he ordered.
- I want you to put him under arrest.
- Yes, sir.
I want you to keep him there for at least ten seconds.
- I'm not all that sure I understand.
- Count to ten, Lieutenant, fast.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Like that?
Thank you, Lieutenant.
This is yours, I think.
It sure looks like mine.
You scared the shit out of me, you stupid bastard.
You did a fine job yourself, if it makes you feel any better.
Goddamn right it does.
- Eddie?
- Sir.
You wouldn't really have killed me, would you?
Thank you, sir.
Right!
Let's haul a little ass! Go!
Hold! Hold!
Move it. Come on, soldier, you're not building a sand castle.
Come on, boys.
Use your muscle.
Heave.
Come on, heave!
Unload quickly.
- It's all right, sir.
- Come on, move yourself.
We haven't got all day.
Come on, push!
Altogether, lift!
Come on, soldier, pound it.
We've got a schedule to meet.
Steady.
Hold it.
- How much longer now?
- About another four hours, sir.
Shit.
Come on, boys.
We're not doing this for fun.
- Hey, soldier, get over here.
- Yes, sir.
- Pull on this rope.
- Yes, sir.
Didn't you ever build a Bailey bridge before?
Neither did I.
Clear the way! Clear!
We haven't got all day.
Roll it, fellas!
Right. Come on. All aboard.
Let's get moving again.
- Thanks, fellas.
- Be seeing you.
- What's wrong, sir?
- They're 36 hours behind schedule.
Lieutenant.
Sir.
We'll be turning you over to the 82nd now.
They're good soldiers, the 82nd.
Just be sure you keep your hand on your wallet at all times.
Yes, sir.
They're here.
It's 30 Corps.
They're here, chaps.
You're late, you lazy bastard, but we'll forgive you!
That was gracious of me.
Take cover!
Bring up the Piat.
Make sure it's within range.
Come on! You'll miss him.
Right, lads! Go, go!
Corporal!
I need a jeep.
Well done, laddie.
- We thought you were dead.
- I can assure you it was an error.
That was the bleeding general.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.
Carry on, thank you.
Good morning, Baker.
Good morning, James.
Harry. Apologies for my enforced absence. Dennis.
- Sir.
- Lathbury's been put out of action.
I'd like you to go into town, take over the brigade.
- How soon can you leave?
- Right away.
Pull them together and keep pushing forward to the bridge.
Did the rest of the division arrive safely?
Yes, but we've run into all kinds of trouble.
It would seem that we've landed on top of two S.S. panzer divisions.
Good God.
As you can imagine, it's hard to stop tanks...
...with rifles and machine guns.
- Show me.
You can see what we're up against.
Johnny Frost and some of his chaps have managed to get as far as the bridge.
But the Germans are driving down here towards the river...
...and may even now have cut them off completely.
Now the entire division is here, we should be able to break through to him.
It certainly gives us more of a chance.
Sosabowski's Polish brigade is due in at 12:00.
If it arrives.
Yesterday's airlift was three hours late due to fog in England.
The gliders bringing the Poles' equipment didn't arrive at all.
- Now give me the good news.
- I'm afraid there isn't any, sir.
As you can see, we're more or less surrounded.
So far we're holding our own, but we're desperately short of food, medicine...
...and above all, ammunition.
- Are we getting our daily supply drop?
- Oh, yes.
The Royal Air Force are flying in on schedule.
The trouble is, the Germans have overrun the dropping zones.
- Don't our pilots know that?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
In heaven's name, why?
It's the radios, sir.
We still haven't been able to make contact with anyone outside Arnhem.
Fools!
Boody fools, this way!
We're over here!
We're here!
- This way.
- Drop 'em over here.
What the hell are they doing?
They must be able to see us.
They can see us all right, laddie...
...but they're under orders to ignore signals from the ground.
For all they know, we could be Germans.
They're giving it all to the bloody Germans.
Charles.
Poor bastard.
Oh, well, maybe tomorrow.
Here.
He'll never make it.
Those bleeding snipers will get him.
Come back!
Come on, Ginger mate.
- He'll never lift it.
- Come on, mate!
Bring it back, mate.
Come on.
Come on!
Run, laddie, run!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Taxi!
- Do you get all that?
- She wants somebody to call her a taxi.
Taxi.
- Doctor.
- Good evening, Kate.
May I introduce Mrs. Ter Horst,
Colonel Weaver.
Is your husband not returned yet?
He should have been here by now.
He must be having difficulties coming through the German lines.
Well, in that case...
...we will have to ask you for a decision.
Colonel Weaver has a request to make.
What we've done is we've set up...
...a defensive pocket, more or less thumb-shaped...
...with the river as the base.
Mrs. Ter Horst speaks surprisingly good English, Colonel.
Then you understand that we're in quite a strong position...
...for holding out until 30 Corps reaches us.
But we have to make certain arrangements.
The words come through. I don't know if I follow the military strategy.
We have the main hospital, of course, but it is full to bursting.
Perhaps you understand that we have great need...
...of additional space.
Our house would seem suitable.
It's just for the slightly wounded.
You know, we'll patch them up, send them back... that sort of thing.
I feel it will need a little more than that.
We're wasting time. Come.
- Doctor.
- Thank you, Kate.
I will see you.
I will come back.
You come in. Let's see.
Please sit.
Come take this chair.
- Come over here with me, lads.
- Thanks very much.
Sit down.
Let me help you.
Oh, colonel, the major wants you upstairs, sir.
Okay. Thank you.
All right?
Thank you.
Still in one piece, Dodds?
Good. All right, Potter?
That's far enough!
We can hear you from there.
Rather an interesting development, sir.
My general says there is no point in continuing this fighting.
He is willing to discuss a surrender.
Tell him to go to hell.
We haven't the proper facilities to take you all prisoner!
Sorry.
What?
We'd like to, but we can't accept your surrender.
Was there anything else?
All right.
And now?
Flatten Arnhem.
- Any movement at Nijmegen?
- None.
No way of bLasting through to the bridge?
I'd lose all my men for nothing. There's
God knows how many out there already.
You mean it's over?
I didn't say that, did I?
We've paid for that bridge, and we're going to collect.
But to do it,
I need tank support.
You've got it, Jimmy.
The Grenadier Guards will be happy to oblige. Is that all right, Alex?
Absolutely.
It's not just tanks.
I need boats.
If 30 Corps were American, we would have boats. Did you bring any?
- Mike?
- We might have a few about somewhere.
- Can you get them here by tonight?
- It won't be easy.
We've got one road, ten-mile traffic jams on it...
...and Germans throwing shells at us.
- I don't know quite what we can do...
- Except try. You can do that, can't you?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Now, look here.
About these boats...
What is your opinion?
How many?
The general's a bit scratchy today, but it's nothing personal.
When we dropped on Sunday...
...I think he cracked his spine.
- How many boats have we got then?
- About six in each truck.
Where's Major Cook, soldier?
- I think over there, sir.
- Thank you.
Julian, where the hell are you?
Here, sir.
We're going to take
Nijmegen Bridge tonight.
- What's the best way to take a bridge?
- Both ends at once.
I'm sending two companies across the river by boat.
I need a man with very special qualities to lead.
Go on, sir.
He's got to be tough enough and experienced enough to do it.
Plus one more thing.
He's gotta be dumb enough to do it.
Start getting ready.
What was all that about?
Well, someone's come up with a real nightmare.
Come on! Keep moving!
We just got word from the Dutch Resistance people at Arnhem.
- And?
- It's not going well for the British.
Their main force never reached the bridge.
Those that did are hanging on by their fingernails.
- And General Urquhart?
- He's got his back to the river.
The Germans trapped his men in a pocket and they're squeezing it smaller.
How long can he hold?
Where are those goddamn boats?
Just keep it clear.
Right.
They're no further than we thought. Julian.
- Sir.
- There's been a change in plans.
We're gonna make the crossing in daylight.
- Daylight.
- Traffic's all screwed up for miles.
By the time we're ready, it'll be 0800.
- That's when we go.
- Fine.
I'd like to wait and go tomorrow night, but the British can't hold.
Better by daylight.
Much.
- Any news of the boats?
- No. We're switching...
- You want some?
- No, thank you.
We're switching the start to 9:00 just to make sure.
You start laying smoke just before we go.
Fine.
They're going to get creamed from the far embankment.
Your smoke screen's gonna be their only protection.
Don't worry.
We'll cover you.
Please.
Okay, can I have your attention, please?
I'm pleased to inform you that our 9:00 departure has been postponed till 10:00.
So you can all have an extra hour's fun and relaxation.
- Major?
- Yes.
We got any more information on those boats?
We're reliably informed that they float.
Outside of that, we don't know squat.
Not how many, not how heavy, not how big.
We are sure that the river is wide and that the current is strong.
As any more cheery information comes my way, I'll be happy to pass it along.
In the meantime, just think of this as on-the-job training.
What's the matter?
No sense of humor?
Goddamn it!
We go at noon.
Come on. Clear those roads!
You men are probably wondering why I've called us here together.
I've reached a decision that I'd like to share with you all.
I intend to go across like George Washington...
...standing on the prow.
You guys can do the rowing.
- That's it! Move 'em out!
- Here we go!
Get up there, guys.
It's heavy.
What the...
What'd you expect, destroyers?
Come on, put it together. Unload 'em.
Easy on them, guys.
- How many more?
- Get those sides up.
Fire!
What else can you see besides smoke?
Nothing yet, but they are going to try a river assault.
It will fail.
Of course it will fail, but...
...what do we do if it doesn't?
I ask your permission to blow up the bridge.
Out of the question.
I understand, Field Marshal.
They will not cross the river and we will blow no bridges.
Have all demolition charges been checked?
Yes, sir.
Everything is wired and ready.
Captain Krafft is standing by as ordered.
The bridge will not fall into enemy hands.
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross...
...I'll blow it sky-high.
- Let's get going!
- All right! Go, go, go!
Go on. Don't wait. Go.
Jump in, boys.
If you don't have an oar, use your rifle butts, anything.
Row!
One, two.
The current's taking us down.
Stay to your right.
- Support fire ordered, sir.
- Right. Thank you.
Get down!
Hail Mary, full of grace.
We're drifting!
Pull to your left!
Pull!
Keep it going, boys.
Keep rowing.
Stay down.
Come on, boys.
Thy will be done.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go!
Snipers!
Help me.
Go up the side.
Second platoon!
- Can we make it through the tunnel?
- No way, sir.
Up the bank.
Cover.
Come on.
Sergeant.
Take four across, draw fire.
Harry and I'll go up the side.
You cover.
Go, go, go!
Come on.
Let's go!
Are you ready?
Yes, General.
Goddamn it.
My God, they're only
18 kilometers from Arnhem.
Who can stop them now?
No one.
Oh, hell.
Any chance, Whitney?
No, sir, not unless we're relieved in the next few hours.
Harry?
- Try and get him down to the cellar.
- Very good, sir.
It's working.
I'm through to H.Q.
Where's the colonel?
- Down below.
- Get him.
- Colonel Frost!
- What is it?
Up top.
It's Headquarters, sir, on the radio.
Coming.
Sunray on set.
Pass your message. Over.
What's your situation, Johnny?
Over.
I hadn't expected the pleasure, sir.
We are holding out.
We need reinforcements and above all, ammunition. Over.
I'm not sure if it's a case of us coming for you...
...or you coming for us.
Well, we'll just wait for 30 Corps then.
That would probably be best.
Very reassuring talking to you, sir.
I'm sorry, Johnny, getting stuck on that bloody bridge...
...four days on your own.
Have you anything else for me?
No, sir. I'll give you a call when our friends arrive. Over.
All right.
Good luck. Out.
- Sergeant Tomblin!
- Here, sir.
I'm coming over.
Sergeant Taylor!
I don't understand.
Why aren't you moving?
What's the matter with you guys?
Those are British troops at Arnhem.
They're hurt bad.
You're not gonna stop, not now.
I'm sorry.
We have our orders.
We busted our asses getting here.
Half my men are killed.
You're just gonna stop...
...and drink tea?
We're now facing a completely different situation.
We can't lead with tanks up that road.
Jerry'll pick us off like sitting ducks.
Our infantry is fighting in Nijmegen.
When they get here, we'll move on.
For Christ's sake, must you do everything by the book?
Our orders are to wait for the infantry.
I'm sorry, but there it is.
It's Major Carlyle, sir.
All right. I'm all right.
Things are not so good, eh?
I've been meaning to ask you something...
...and I haven't because I know you were so anxious that I should...
...and I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.
Why the hell do you always carry that bloody umbrella?
- Memory.
- What?
Bad memory.
Always forgot the password.
I knew no Jerry...
...would ever carry one.
I had...
...to prove I was an Englishman.
Get back!
Back into the houses.
30 Corps, please hurry.
- Nothing, sir.
- All right. Thank you, Corporal.
It's no use in any event.
Take my boot off, will you, Wicks?
Hello, 30 Corps.
Oh, God!
We're out of ammunition anyway.
Right. Off you go, Wicks.
Join the rest of the lads.
Try and get back to the main force.
- What about you, sir?
- I'll be all right.
We just didn't make it this time, did we?
Calling 30 Corps.
Come in, please.
My general says please take it.
It's very good chocolate.
Your planes dropped it to us yesterday.
English.
Action stations!
God bless
Field Marshal Montgomery.
Would five minutes be too much?
Just five minutes respite.
Dear God...
...grant these young men...
...die in peace and quiet.
I'm sorry, lads, but you're going to have to move.
Please.
Take my hand.
We're a bit late with this one, mate.
"Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler...
...and from the noisome pestilence.
He shall cover thee with His feathers...
...and under His wings shalt thou trust.
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler."
There you go. Head back.
You'll be all right now, chum.
Can it get worse?
Oh, yes, much worse.
Bring up the bulldozer.
Stretcher bearer!
Help me!
Stretcher.
Easy, now. Take it easy.
Morphia. I must have morphia.
Morphia is only for the people who are really hurt.
I thought I was really hurt.
Well, you're wrong.
I asked him to come over, but Dr. Spaander does agree with me.
- We've got to do something about them.
- Yes, what? Good day, Doctor.
General Urquhart, we have no more space and we have no more supplies.
And since a prisoner of war...
...has more chance than no chance at all...
I have a mind to ask the Germans...
...to accept our wounded into their hospitals...
...if we could arrange evacuation.
- Have I your permission to try?
- Certainly.
If Weaver agrees.
But I hardly think the Germans will.
Those are our guns out there.
That's 30 Corps.
I don't think my permission is going to be your major problem.
I've come with a message from General Urquhart.
How you manage that?
I swam the Rhine, sir.
I'm afraid the radios are all up the spout.
The general asks if you'll get your men across the river.
We've been holding out for six days now.
Any help at all would be of considerable assistance.
You swim back with reply?
Yes, sir.
Well, we can't swim...
...not with equipment.
We have small rubber boats, that's all.
I'm afraid rubber dinghies may be a bit flimsy for the Rhine, sir.
I agree.
Tell the general we're coming.
We're coming tonight.
Yes, sir.
Not possible.
If you would just say yes, it would be very possible.
Forgive me, but there is a battle...
...and we are in the process of winning it.
Winning and losing is not our concern.
Living or dying is.
Cease fire...
...one more hour, two...
...just to evacuate our wounded.
Afterwards you can kill us as much as you want to.
General Ludwig.
- Will you thank him, please?
- I just did.
Please, you can go.
How short are we? A mile?
Why don't we just try to bash through?
For God's sake, it must be worth it.
They're trying to force Urquhart away from the river.
Now, once they do that...
...once they've got him surrounded, he'll be annihilated.
Not in Monty's plan at all.
Have we replaced the boats we lost at Nijmegen?
Yes.
Well?
Well, then?
Well, that's it then.
We're pulling them out.
It was Nijmegen.
It was the single road getting to Nijmegen.
No, it was after Nijmegen.
And the fog...
...in England.
It doesn't matter what it was.
When one man says to another,
"Today let's play the war game"...
...everybody dies.
"Withdraw"?
Two days, they said.
We've been here nine.
One bloody mile. You'd think they could accomplish that.
- Hancock, here are another two.
- All right. Thank you.
They're the last two
I could find.
Charles?
We've been given our marching orders.
If they discover we're leaving, they'll go all out to destroy us.
So we must take every precaution.
I've designed this like a collapsing bag.
Macdonald here has agreed to man the wireless...
...in order to give the Germans something to listen to.
All the padres and medical staff have volunteered to stay behind as well.
Now, the wounded who are too bad to move...
...will replace the men firing...
...so our defense will seem as before.
By the time the Germans find out what's happening...
...we should all be safely across the river.
- Pleasant journey.
- Thank you, sir.
- Are you all right, laddie?
- Thank you, sir.
I'm beginning to believe we're actually going to make it, sir.
I thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.
Come on. Don't hang about.
General Browning will be down right away, sir.
He wondered if you perhaps might like to change.
- Change?
- Your clothes, sir.
No, thanks.
Hello, Roy.
How are you?
I'm not sure that I'll know for a while.
But I'm sorry about the way it worked out.
You did all you could.
Yes, but did everyone else?
They've got a bed for you upstairs, if you want it.
I took 10,000 men into Arnhem.
I've come out with less than 2,000.
I don't feel much like sleeping.
Quite.
I've just been on to Monty.
He's very proud and pleased.
- Pleased?
- Of course.
He thinks Market Garden was 90/ successful. 
But what do you think?
Well, as you know, I've always thought we tried to go a bridge too far.
Mind his head.
Thanks, Taff.
Abide with me
Fast falls
The eventide
The darkness
Deepens
Lord, with me abide
When other
Helpers fail
And comforts flee
Help of the helpless
O abide
With me
Hold Thou Thy cross
Before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom
Are you alone here?
Yes, I was a prisoner.
But I fled.
And?
I am unarmed.
What's your name?
Private Adolf Sachs.
ID number 1040.
Come here.
Nice and easy.
Which is the safest way to Switzerland?
The germans sieged the villages.
The safest yet longest way is through the woods
Stop!
Come here!
Who are the americans?
Four soldiers and an officer.
Where did you come from?
Saint Michel.
We attacked and captured them.
Where are you taking them?
To the headquarters for further interrogation.
The new order is: no prisoners!
The army didn't receive that order.
And they call themself soldiers.
They're a bunch of cowards!
What have you got there?
Lieutenant!
Yes, captain!
Shoot those men!
But those men are prisoners of the army, not the SS!
Ah, to hell with the army!
You have an american machine gun.
Shoot this traitor too!
Vehicles, drive on.
Carry out the order and follow us.
Papers please.
Nicole, here's an american.
Take great care of him.
Marcel and Robert, take care of the americans lodgings!
Are you american?
Sit down.
Nicole, bring the aid box!
There's almost nothing left, just some bandages.
What is it?
Nicole, we're waiting for you.
I'm coming!
Turn on the searchlight!
Come on now, hurry!
Quick, hide the parachute and put out the fire.
Come on, hurry up down there!
Have you seen, Pierre?
What are they doing?
See you soon.
Hurry up and load the stuff.
I have two american prisoners here.
I need a car.
Can you affirm that?
What do you mean "affirm"?
What the fuck do you mean by that?
We were to transport the prisoners, but our truck was blown up.
We've been walking for two days and are exhausted.
We don't...
Come here!
What's going on here?
Nothing, sir.
I have two american prisoners and I need a vehicle.
You can have a new car, but the prisoners stay.
Quiet! - Bring the prisoners to my office.
Let's go.
Here's the car.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Throw your weapons under the table.
Look out, it's a trap!
Move it, come on.
Papers, please.
Everything's in order.
Let them pass.
Your papers, please.
Everything is in order.
You may step aboard.
Thank you.
General Tieck, officer
Ritter and Schaefer!
Good to meet you. The train will depart in a few minutes. Sit, please.
We would prefer to start our work immediately, general.
Sorry, but no one is allowed in the laboratory before departion.
Oh, of course not.
Of course not.
The train just took off.
What? Yes.
General, We've departed. 
May we start working now?
Yes, but first you'll have to turn over your weapons first.
It's a mere formality.
Yes, of course.
Major Schaefer, Major Ritter?
I'm cardinal Hauser. Cardinal
Brenner is in the darkroom.
He'll be assisting you shortly.
Have a seat, please.
Brenner told me you've been working together.
Here is a detailed description.
Everything you need is in there.
Have fun, you'll have to excuse me now.
Stop!
I'm going to pay cardinal
Brenner a visit.
Certainly.
Cardinal Brenner, Major Schaefer comes to pay you a visit.
Schaefer?
Yes, sir.
Nice to see you again.
One moment please.
What happened?
He felt nauseous.
The bridge is destroyed.
Make contact with the headquarters.
We need to protect the rocket.
There is another way, but it goes to near the american line.
Tell the engineer to back all the way to the trackswitches.
Contact Pont Mosson immediately.
As you can see on the map...
Hello? The bridge is destroyed
We're coming back.
How's the situation at your place?
Notify the general that the situation is calm and the track is safe.
Yes, the situation is calm and the track is safe.
Do you have some chocolate?
Follow me!
Gather the wounded ones and get your guns.
A train full of germans! Hide!
What's going on?
Stand still!
I just saw someone fall off the train.
Quick, open the door!
He's hiding in there.
Very good. Very good choice.
Please.
It's hot enough.
Ah.
- You'd better dry off.
- See you in the car.
- Hello, my dear.
- General.
Ramírez.
Get me the one on the right.
Darling, you go on to the airport.
I have to stop at the factory.
HAVANA - 1959
¡Alto! ¡Alto!
¡Tírale! ¡Tira!
- Very hot in here.
- Sure is. Look at him.
Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts.
We are about to land at Havana.
We remind you that due to political unrest in the interior,
you are advised to contact the military authorities
before proceeding on to Santiago or Santa Clara.
¡Viva el señor Pulido!
¡Que viva el señor Pulido!

There you go, folks. Miss Wonderley is from Hollywood, California.
She will be appearing at the Flamingo casino nightclub twice nightly.
There you go.
Stand back, give her some air.
She's a big breather.
- There you go, folks.
- ¡Mira! ¡Mira!
No, you wouldn't want one.

Major Robert Dapps?
- Absolutely. But it's Dapes.
- Of course. I am Rafael Ramírez.
Aide to General Bello, chief of staff of the army of Cuba.
- No, thanks.
- This way, please.
No. it is not necessary. Please.
- Thank you.
- Very nice seeing you.
Sir, could you take off your jacket and open your cases, please?
What kind of country is this anyway?
What do you have to do to get that kind of treatment?
Would you like me to smile?
It's simply for your safe conduct.
- Was your flight pleasant?
- Long.
Yes. Bastante.
There's somebody who wishes to speak to you.
- I take it. I take it.
- No, no, no. Nothing.
- Two pesos. Very heavy.
- Forget it!
No, no. No, no.
I don't need a taxi. I'm being met.
- ¡Señor!
- Oh, come on, will you?
Major Dapes?
How do you do? Roger Maxwell-Lefroy.
Thank you.
Although we have no objections to your being seconded to General Bello...
Seconded? He's hiring me.
...we wouldn't want any nosy people to find out about it.
Although British government policy is to support Batista - delighted so to do, now that the US has imposed an arms embargo, shut up shop, so to speak...
However, flogging them clapped-out old tanks and Leyland buses is one thing, hiring out an ex-British officer quite another.
You're not hiring me out.
I'm hiring myself out.
Incidentally, South American squares are full of statues to soldiers of fortune.
- Mostly British.
- Yes, indeed.
And you may accept the money.
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, yes.
But if anyone asks you, you sell tractors, right?
Tractors? I know nothing about tractors.
Ladies' underwear, then. Most soldiers have a working knowledge of that.
But remember that, for all intents and purposes, you are a mercenary.
You could be an embarrassment to us.
Don't think you can pop round to the embassy if you get into hot water, because you won't be welcome, chum.
- Larry Gutman.
- How do you do?
We've conversed on the phone.
Alex! Alex! Alex!
- Major Dapes!
- Guarde eso.
- Do you know who that was?
- Yes. She is of an old Cuban family.
- She is?
- She's a Pulido.
Your photograph, sir. Photo one dollar.
Do you... Do you want to talk money?
- No.
- Quite right.
Quite right. A charming lady like you.
Let me know when you want to talk money.
I guess your husband's busy, huh?
Yes, I imagine so.
That's why he sent you, I guess.
Very nice.
I can always talk money.
The bishop of Cienfuegos
yesterday visited the soldiers
Given the vital task of keeping the bridges of the Carretera Central open.
He is seen here saying Mass for those about to go into action
against the rebels in Las Villas province.
Sport Richie Ashburn, former centre fielder with the Philadelphia Phillies,
seen here on a visit to Grand Stadium, home of the Havana Sugar Kings,
said he thought the standard of play was as good as he had ever seen.
- Where's Teresa?
- She must be at work.
No, no, no. No more, Teresa.
I have to clean up.
- I love you.
- Of course you do.
But I'm in trouble already because of you.
I should have been at the airport to meet a rich Yanqui.
Psst-psst!
¿Tendría usted la bondad de darme un cigarro?
Con mucho gusto.
- Gracias.
- De nada.
OK, OK.
Fruit company boss protests.
The United Fruit Company president protested
that water was cut off from a sugar mill
because he had refused to pay the sugar tax demanded by rebels,
which is said to be 15 cents on every 200 pounds of sugar.
Looters risk being shot if they take advantage of strikes being called despite edicts.
Elect as president Rivero Agüero.
Rivero Agüero was orphaned at the age of ten.
He worked in the fields, but at 15 he moved to Santiago, where he studied at night and worked by day until he qualified as a lawyer.
This is the man Batista would urge you to vote for in the forthcoming election.
A man of the people, a man of the fields and factories like yourselves.
Qualified engineers without satisfactory employment - your talents may ensure you new assignments, such as exciting DC-6 construction, or in intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
Many more commercial and military products ensure engineers great opportunities.
Home cooking.
Eddie Fisher's lima bean soup.
The popular singing star comes home...
- Yes, Juan?
- Is Gutman here?
Yes, he is.
Leave us alone, Ramón, for just a moment.
Shouldn't he be shown the factory?
- Juan, I am still...
- Of course you are.
And I'm still very much in love with you.
- Are you?
- Head over heels.
A most uncomfortable position to be in, huh?
Yes. I remember.
- What is it this time?
- Very much the same thing as usual.
I shall stop drinking.
In stages.
- I shall deal with the rest myself.
- Thank goodness.
Everything is so much better when dealt with by you.
- Can I have some money?
- Of course.
- For what?
- For entertaining the Yanqui.
- All right.
- Thank you.
Juan, I know you hate it. I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
I want you to do all this. I really do.
I'm not going to manage unless you manage me.
I need you to do it all.
Please?
- Juan, I do want you...
- Good.
Good. it's settled.
Ramón! You can come in now.
Mr Gutman. Did you have a good trip?
Señor Pulido.
- Sorry...
- Call me Juan.
- How is New York?
- Great.
Let's get you settled into your hotel.
You must want to rest.
- No, no. I'm fine.
- Excellent. I'll show you a few things.
The minister for tourism said he expected tourism to recover as soon as the election showed the world
Cuba's democratic stability.
Three found hanged.
Three unknown boys were discovered hanged in the Plaza de Armas.
- It's busy here.
- I'll take that for you.
- May I?
- No.
¿Ha visto a un señor muy alto con un bigote que pasó por aquí?
No.
You're required to register.
I want a room with water which is sometimes hot.
If there's a bath to put it in,
I wouldn't mind.
Hello. Would you inform General Bello that Major Dapes has arrived and is at the Hotel Roma?
Yes, he knows who I am. Thank you.
- Do you have any luggage?
- Only what I'm carrying.
Without luggage we require money to be paid in advance.
- How much?
- Whatever you care to give, sir.
No, no. No.
Well, you're bigger than I am.
- Mr President...
- I am not.
- We are holding an election for president.
- General Batista.
You can live in the security of the
United States with all your family, sir.
You have a house in Florida, sir.
All you have to do is get out, hand over to the new president, whoever he is.
He will be Rivero Agüero.
- You gonna lift the arms embargo?
- Me? Us?
I can only speak as...
We are not privy to the...
What do you want?
We are here to investigate the financial affairs of the Buró de Represión de las Actividades Comunistas.
We may not be able to continue support.
¿Preparado?
Excuse me, I think there's a problem,
General Bello.
- I've lost the Englishman.
- Wait.
Nice one!
You better go find him.
I'm paying Dapes.
Get the police to bring him.
- Sir.
- Nice to see you.
¡Adelante!
Your bash, Vicar.
- Where's the phone in this room?
- In this room it's downstairs.
- It is untrue that I'm not a good worker.
- Yes.
It's her.
She has the right.
Go.
- You tell her...
- What?
That I will not go.
Have her come in here.
- There will be a strike if I go.
- Will there?
- Almost certainly.
- You will go.
There are accepted ways of behaviour in Cuba still.
You can't fire me.
If you don't go, I will make you go.
How?
- What's that?
- He gave it to me.
It was my mother's.
Ramón! Some money.
I will buy it from you. I'm sure that you consider that you have earned it.
No. He never should have given it to me.
200,000 bottles a day.
That's terrific.
Do you get to drink any of it?
Anyway, it all starts with the sugar.
With your permission, I'd like to show you.
My father, Don José Pulido, is one of the wealthiest men on the island.
Rum, sugar, tobacco.
But we are quite separate from the businesses run by my father.
I tell you this simply so that you understand.
We don't need investment.
We, that is the cigar factory, hope to encourage investment so that we might expand.
- Would you like to meet my father?
- Yes, I would.
Ah!
- My father?
- Señor Pulido is very busy.
Tell him I'm here with a friend.
I'd like to introduce him.
- My card...
- He gave instructions...
- Tell him.
- Señor.
Your son would like to speak with you.
Father.
Might I introduce
Mr Gutman from New York?
You have met my daughter-in-law?
- I have. She's a very beautiful young lady.
- Yes, she is.
But my son is quite beautiful as well.
Handsome, charming. Like this pony.
- How do you like this pony?
- Very nice.
But I know nothing about horses.
Juan, how do you like this pony?
- It's good.
- Then I will buy it.
If there is one thing my son knows about, it's horses.
It's the only thing he knows about, which is why my daughter-in-law runs my factory and Juan doesn't.
I hope he'll show you Havana.
It's wonderful.
He knows every casino, every table and every bed in it.
He'd make an excellent travel guide.
As well as a jockey.
I'm not trying to insult my son.
I just want you to be aware of his talents.
Will you excuse me?
- Who the hell are you?
- Police.
- General Bello causes me to arrest you.
- Does he?
Hm. At once.
But... do you have any money?
Not for you, I haven't.
In that case, at once.
Radio Reloj.
And now, news time.
The rebel threat has gone down like cane in Las Villas.
Government troops are taking scores of rebel prisoners.
Rum and coca.
Radio Reloj brings you news every second of the day

Oh!
¡Frio!
No.
No more, huh?
- Well, what do you say?
- I say you are right.
- Where have you been today?
- With the Yanqui.
Yes?
- We're taking him to dinner tonight.
- We are?
- I think we ought to, Alejandra. I...
- You are quite beautiful.
- Aren't I, though?
- Yes, you are.
I fired Teresa Mederos.
Good. You are right.
She was becoming troublesome.
Juan.
Juan, not again. Please. Not somebody from the factory or the house.
I do promise. I do.
Dapes. Robert Dapes.
Until recently a major in the British Army.
Served in the war. Long-range desert group in North Africa, Kenya and Malaya, where he commanded the Jungle Warfare School.
He's an expert in counterinsurgency and has no political loyalties.
Not employed since resigning from the army. Where is he?
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.
- He was met by General Bello's aide.
- Yes, I know.
- You want something to happen to him?
- Yeah. Something.
After the election. I'll tell Castro.
The ability to read is a struggle.
Remember that to be literate is to be liberated, for nobody can ever fool you again.
Two words a day.
Start with "freedom". Start with "hope".
H-O-P-E spells "hope".
This is Rebel Radio.
Radio Rebelde. Radio Rebelde.
- Can I try?
- No. Next time.
Excuse me, General.
El comandante inglés.
Sí. Dapes.
El comandante del ejército inglés.
Mayor Dapes. Sí.
- Major Dapes. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.
Would you be so kind?
Please wait here.
Excuse me.

Skinner. Donald Skinner. Fellow exile?
- Dapes. Bob Dapes.
- Thought so.
- In...
- In?
- Line of business?
- Oh... tractors.
Tractors.
I fly aeroplanes, put out fires, spray crops, that sort of nonsense.
Crop-spraying could really take off here, when Bello puts the unions in their place.
He... is in the police.
You see he's all right and you'll survive.
One of the first things you do here is to grease a palm or two, as it were.
And how much does one tip the captain of police in Cuba?
- I usually give them all I've got.
- I see.
- Slightly less than New York.
- Yes.
Major.
Excuse me.
Major Dapes, General Bello.
General Bello, Major Dapes.
Major Dapes. Glad to meet you.
Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
- Sit down.
- You want to know something?
- Yes.
I guess I couldn't wait until you got around to calling me.
I did call. I told them where I was.
That was very thoughtful of you, but it was unnecessary.
- We would have found you.
- I wasn't hiding.
I'd decided to make my own arrangements.
- Beretta.
- Yes.
- You buying or selling?
- Both.
- Major?
- No, thank you.
Major, how long were you in Malaya?
Oh, an awfully long time.
- Yes, I know.
- I imagine you do.
You want to know something?
I met a man, an American friend.
I told him that I wanted the best counterterrorists I could find.
He told me that I have to buy British.
So here you are.
Bought.
You don't like money?
I don't like being without it.
- But you do like fighting, don't you?
- No, I don't like fighting at all.
- I try not to do too much of it.
- I do.
Have you done much?
Major, tell me what your favourite weapon is and I'll get it for you.
- Brains.
- Brains. Yes.
You've got brains, right? Huh?
You see Ramírez here?
Ramírez is a junior officer.
He got brains.
Went to a military college.
They gave him brains.
With brains, very easy to get a promotion.
- We can make you a colonel.
- Thank you.
My friend Batista was a sergeant until he got brains.
I was a corporal.
Then they had the revolution. The next day I became a general with brains.
That's wonderful.
Some people stay corporals all their lives.
- Look at Hitler.
- Hitler... God rest his soul.
He was foolish enough to take on
Uncle Sam as well as the communists.
Yes. Right. That's the Second World War in a nutshell.
- How are you going to do it?
- Do what?
- Beat Castro.
- Ah.
Minor factors can be taught in a month.
It's quite simple.
- Deny the enemy food, harry and kill him.
- What?
Harry and kill him.
Ambush him, rather than wait for him to ambush you.
- OK. All right. What do you want?
- I need to see what you've got.
Perdóneme, señor.
- Excuse me.
- General.
The parking meter detail.
- Did you get the money in England?
- Yes, thank you.
- I shall keep a record of my expenses.
- No, no.
Spend it. I want you to owe me.
Ramírez here is going to show you a good time.
I want to hear you got to do everything.
If he slips up again, you tell me.
I'll take care of Ramírez in my own way.
Do you play golf?
What's your handicap? Have a cigar.
Major Dapes, I'm going to give you a pass that will let you go anyplace and see anything.
Only don't take too long, huh?
After all, we're fighting a war.
Yes, and rather badly I suspect, too.
See that Major Dapes gets to harry and kill.
- There is something one ought to say.
- Say it.
You will only defeat someone like Castro if you're right.
Is Castro right?
It's not the point.
Does Cuba think he's right?
When you're ready, Mr Dapes.
I expect to be called General.
It's important to call people what they are, sir.
Major Dapes.
How do you work this?
- Marvin.
- Howdy.
- Ready to be beaten?
- You'll be lucky.
All right. All right.
- It's your day.
- It's straight set day.
- She's been practising.
- Oh, yeah?
Might put them off, huh?
- She's worked on her serve.
- She should have worked on her legs!
¡Dos más! ¡Dos más!
The boots are good.
Yes, Batista promised the army good boots... in 1934, when he was a revolutionary.
They wanted very little else then.
What do you say about my on-court play now?
Tell me when you're gonna do that.
You know I can't get to it, Marvin.
Do you think I can mind-read?
Stay up at the net. And don't poach.
Alex.
- I knew it was you.
- Did you?
I'm Alejandra López de Pulido.
Excuse me. if you don't mind, we're trying to play tennis.
Alejandra?
Alejandra!
I'd like to... No.
Better still, muster a patrol.
- Ten good men.
- Ten?
It will be almost impossible to find two.
Does that include you and me?
It isn't usual to go off the road.
Isn't it? No wonder you never get to know anything.
It's the only way.
Get out, move amongst them.
Put your men on the paths at five-yard intervals. All right?
Rafael, tell that idiot to shut up, leave his nag behind and walk quietly.
Apéate del caballo.
You may tell my mother that I am well, Núñez.
And give these to her.
Yes. Yes, you are well. Better, anyway.
We now eat more than one meal a day.
I am getting quite fat.
Bring Captain Ramírez.
- ¡Jefe!
- Shut up!
It's well used. How big is this plantation?
Some five miles. if you're patient, keep your sense of smell.
Sooner or later you'll pick up somebody and they'll talk.
- Smell?
- Mm.
You can often smell a body of men before you see them or hear them.
Especially if they're smokers.
Are you worried about being late for the general?
He likes to show you off to his friends.
What happens if I don't show up?
Oh.
Hey!
Hold your fire!
¡Vamos! ¡Por aquí!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Do you understand English?
I teach it.
It's a girl.
- I want to question her.
- Yes.
First you, then she is questioned by the sergeant and each of the men as many times as possible, and a few days later she is taken down to La Cabana and shot.
It would be much kinder to shoot her now.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just want to ask you...
Get down!
Women!
¡Fidelistas!
¡Pare eso!
Who is he?
Nobody.
Mr Gutman is in room 214.
What do you mean,
I'm not offering enough?
We are prepared to pay $10,000 for the whole goddamn operation.
Take it or leave it.
Right. Next, Skinner Air.
- What about some money?
- Hm?
- Money. Money.
- Do the bullets fit?
- What?
- Our guns.
Of course. They're 9mm, which is what you asked for.
When we know they fit, you'll be told and paid.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Shit!
Mister...
SkinnerAirline is no answer...
- Please take your shoes off.
- Hello?
- Skinner no answer.
- Will you ring Skinner Air again for me?
Hello?
Are you on the house, or do I chip in?
Everything is taken care of by Señor Pulido.
I just have to show you a good time.
OK, we'll see what we can do.
Don't you Cubans realise that time is money?
I do.
Guns?
Hm. Stored in the premises of Alejandra Pulido.
- And is she involved?
- Perhaps.
Whether she is or not, she still has to be questioned.
I used to know her in North Africa.
If she is involved,
I can find out very quickly.
Don't worry. I don't like terrorists.
Especially ones I know.
Come on, come on.
- Get me a cab.
- Sí, señor.
Come on.
- I've been promoted.
- Congratulations.
Batista has promoted everyone in the army.
There are no privates any more.
Now I'm a major too.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know that the situation here is not so good.
I think you've come too late.
I was afraid of that.
You know, soldiering has changed.
It's not as... clean as it was.
I'm still proud to be a soldier.
Why not? it's an honourable profession.
It was.
- Ready for another boring evening?
- It'll be fun. They always serve peas.
Sorry we're leaving, General, but Mr Dulles is sending us home.
I know.
- Hello.
- We're not going far.
- But we may not be able to assist.
- It's OK. I've got an Englishman.
Oh, Don Pulido! Hello, my friend.
Here. Sit down.
Sit down next to me.
All right, everybody. Please sit down.
You can start now. Pick your own seats.
You have enough room here?
There you are.
It's pea soup.
Look out!
I don't know when I had such a good time!
I do, honey.
Is that to your liking? Very good.
This wine's really tasty.
Rafael, get some ambulances here.
¡Ambulancias!
All right, my love. We'll do something.
All right?
Here, let me have that cloak.
Hey.
You unfeeling bastard.
- Fire number one!
- Number one, fire!
- Fire number two!
- Number two, fire!
- ¡Puta!
- I love him.
Love! You lose your job.
I don't care.
¡Puta!
- Your father would kill you.
- My father is dead.
No, your father is not dead.
I go every day to the prison to find out.
He's not dead.
Your brother should kill you.
Yeah, yeah. Julio. Julio?
You gonna kill me, Julio?
No, I'm gonna kill him... maybe.
No, Julio. No. Juan Pulido loves me.
- Where you get the gun?
- Go sell yourself to the Yanquis!
I'm gonna kill your pimp.
I don't have no pimp. I just got a man.
- You got a girl?
- I got a gun, Teresa.
- You couldn't shoot anybody, Julio.
- I hate him.
I'll give you some candy and then you won't shoot my man.
I'll kill him.
Let me know when and I'll tire him out for you.
¡Puta! ¡Puta!
Go and spend the night on the Malecón!
¡Puta! Let everyone buy you!
Oh, shut up!
I'm no puta!
And now, from Hollywood, California, the Christmas show at the Flamingo proudly presents, twice nightly...
- the wonderful Miss Wonderley!
- Sorry, fellas. They just got here.
Held up in customs.
I guess they must be pretty hot stuff.
¡Ambulancias!
¡Por aquí!
Let's have a drink.
Let's have a drink.
- Look at this place. Where is everybody?
-  There's somebody delicious.
We get drinks.
We get free drinks. it's in the contract.
Skinner.
Juan, should you be leaving Alejandra alone?
Here. Look at that.
I don't understand it.
In Miami, we'd have packed the joint.
- What's with you Cubans?
- Has Mr Gutman called?
No.
You're a Cuban.
What's the matter? You don't like broads?
I'm glad to hear it.
When Mr Gutman arrives, send him over.
Excuse me.
We get two per cent of every table.
Don't think we don't need it.
Everybody, but everybody, in this town is on the take.
Julio.
The ammunition does fit.
What?
...does fit.
Pay Skinner... something.
OK.
Well.
Well, what?
Have we nothing to say to each other?
Yes. Of course.
I'd rather he didn't come at all.
Alejandra, I've arranged this so...
Where did you take him this afternoon?
To Father's mill, the rum factory.
- Why?
- To impress him.
Juan, you can't be satisfied with what you have, can you?
The cigar factory is impressive enough.
- It only needs investment to be better.
- Yes, I am arranging that.
Gutman was impressed.
Juan.
You are trying. I do love you for that.
Don't laugh at me.
Thank you.
- Hello there!
- Ah!
I guess we got delayed.
Dolores is very lucky. I got lucky.
My God, is Havana wide open!
We shot a little craps. Did you eat?
I'm lucky for him.
How nice. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Champagne, right?
- Alejandra!
- What?
I will not sit down with that common whore.
- How dare you!
- It's the way it's done.
- Did you arrange her?
- Yes, I arranged it.
Did you?
Let me go! Gutman means nothing to me.
I can do without his money.
Ooh, honey!
There's champagne here!
Ooh, baby!
You know what I like!
♪ Chantilly lace and a pretty face

Ooh, baby, that's what I like!
For Skinner.

Hello, Mr Dapes. You are early.
- I am very lucky.
- Are you?
- It appears I'm not.
- I like your photo very much.
- Oh! it's lipstick, huh?
- No, actually, it's blood.
Oh, shaving.
I like a man who shaves smoothly.
Rafael.
Major Dapes, I find the role of procurer very distasteful to me.
- So if you don't like her, then...
- You don't like me?
But I am beautiful.
Yes, you are. it's just that
I try to avoid that which I cannot afford.
Oh! it's OK. You can afford.
Come. I take you to another casino where I am very lucky for you.
I win you maybe two and a half thousand dollars...
- We just bought some champagne!
- Yes, but you have not bought me.
Alex!
- I must talk with you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- You were a long time ago.
- Alex!
Hey!
- Leave the soldiers alone.
- Rafael.
Mr Gutman. Shall we?
Miguel.
Take me back.
For a second time this evening, a big hand for a big lady.
Miss Wonderley.
Shit!
Bartender.
Robert.
I must tell you.
You could be in very serious trouble.
We must have a talk.
Yes, we must have many talks.
It is lovely to see you again. How are you?
I'm well. And you?
Fantastic.
- What sort of friends do you have here?
- Can't you do better than that?
Apart from your Wimbledon set.
I know. I'm sorry. You frightened me.
- But not now.
- I see.
What do you expect me to do now?
Kiss you?
I see no reason why you shouldn't.
It's been, as they say, such a long time.
Oh, stop it!
It seems like yesterday to me.
Really?
Would you excuse me a minute?
- Alex, about three hours ago...
- Robert.
- Did I ever know your second name?
- Of course you did!
- I did?
- You wrote to me. it got to me.
I can't have been the only Robert in the army.
I should introduce you to my husband.
For that I need your second name.
- Juan, this is...
- Nobody?
Robert, for the life of me,
I can't remember your second name.
Dapes.
- My name is Robert Dapes.
- You must come and visit us.
Do you play polo? Would you like to meet anyone in the government?
If there's enough money involved, you can meet Batista himself.
What line of business?
Tractors!
Yes, go and get him!
What's going on?
Come on, get up.
You, too. Up!
- Aimed at you?
- Yes. At me.
Do you know that young man?
Good heavens, no.
I wouldn't even recognise him again.
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Good enough.
Then you are in for a very long night.
Jorge Ortiz Ruiz.
What's all this about?
- They're waiting to hear.
- To hear?
- About those that have been arrested.
- Hear what?
Major, please.
Monopoly!
Thank you.
They just can't account for $300,000 for the month of June, Spence.
I have some very suspicious cross-entries here, Gary.
We're gonna be here for months.
These accounts are in a mess.
Well, they are experiencing a revolution.
I guess accounts do get out of hand.
No luck.
Thank you.
- Teresa, what are you doing here?
- My brother could kill you.
He's already tried.
Wait here, huh? Just wait.
Where's your wife?
Robert!
Your husband was released some hours ago.
Yes, I know.
Come on.
Do you want to say something?
Or would you rather not?
Yes. I would rather not.
Why were you so upset at the tennis?
Yes, I was. You frighten me.
Because you threaten to change the life I have.
How would I do that?
You already have.
I knew you would.
Where are we going?
Can't we just drive around for a little while?
What have you been doing?
Living in Cuba. You?
Modern warfare.
Fighting people who hide grenades in shopping baskets, shoot up crowded hotels, hack the legs off cattle and leave them dying on their stumps.
That sort of thing.
- Your friends...
- I have very few friends.
Do they toss bombs around, shoot off guns?
No. You do that.
- Rafa!
- Sí.
Take the posters down.
Put them on the truck at the back.
Are you married?
No. But you are.
That should be enough for both of us.
We're very happy.
I seem to remember, when I was once deeply and ridiculously in love,
I was at the same time profoundly unhappy.
That was me.
I did that to you. I made you unhappy.
- I adored it.
- I didn't.
Am I still beautiful? You used to think so.
I seem to remember you were very taken with me.
As a matter of fact, you were terrified that I was.
You got out of North Africa faster than Rommel.
- Actually, he took his time.
- Admit it. I terrified you.
Yes, I admit it. I didn't know so much passion could exist in one so young.
You were the most exotic, breath-stopping creature I'd ever known.
Quite a danger to my health.
What with you and my colonel and being shot at, I'm astonished I survived.
- Perhaps you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
By forgetting all about you.
And how did you recognise me?
You didn't forget me.
You knew me at once.
Yes, I did.
And you haven't changed at all.
I hate coming to these filthy places.
I like these places.
I like you and I like places like this.
I used to bring someone else here.
- Who? You don't still bring her?
- Good heavens, no.
She's my wife.
- When did you marry Juan Pulido?
- Five years ago.
- Any children?
- No.
He doesn't beat you, or anything dreadful like that?
- What would you do if he did?
- Break his bloody neck.
- Would you?
- Of course.
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.
- Egg flip?
- There may be something wrong with me.
Apart from your memory?
I might be too ambitious. Too demanding.
In fact, I am.
Tell me this...
The only question you haven't asked me is why I came to meet you.
Why did you come?
Look out!
Why did you?
With an overwhelming majority Cuba has elected Rivero Agüero as president
General Batista has stated that this will show the world
that Cuba is in the forefront of democracy
Free elections in a free country of the free world
President-elect Agüero has a hard task ahead of him,
but the people of Cuba are behind him against communism and revolution.
He will take office as president at once
and will meet with the ambassador...
- Hey. it jammed again last night.
- You want a Coke?
- I don't have any money.
- That's OK.
We want an explanation, Julio.
My sister's honour's important to me.
It was the work of a Yanqui gangster.
My father, who is in prison if he's still alive, he would cut the balls from Pulido.
He betrayed my sister.
You had no right to do it.
You were given a task.
Which I did.
The money for the gringo Skinner.
And you were seen.
You can't stay on campus, Julio.
I've got to. I can't flunk my courses.
It doesn't matter.
There'll be no more courses.
Now Agüero is elected, there will be a general strike.
Here.
Here.
If you want to kill someone.
The trigger mechanism jammed.
Take the .38.
- Did you vote for him?
- No. Nobody did.
- Somebody must have done.
- Batista, who pays you.
No, I'm paid by General Bello.
Just as good.
You can be sure of your money.
Bello works the parking meters.
Batista pockets the lottery.
Don't you worry about where your money's from?
If what you say is true, it appears I come under "traffic of fences".
It's true.
You don't get involved in any of this, hm?
No, I don't look too closely at things that don't concern me.
Like having your factory used.
Robert, in Cuba every building, every factory, every hotel is being used in some way by someone.
There are things I know nothing about,
I don't turn stones over, and so far my workers have not had a strike.
Even a blind eye can be poked out.
Alex...
I want you to come with me.
Where?
Where? You haven't thought about it?
It's only just being suggested to me.
Where?
With me.
Far?
- Don't play games.
- It's very short notice.
I don't see you for 15 years, you turn up as if yesterday and say...
No. I can't go anywhere with anyone on short notice.
I own a factory, and I do have a husband.
He would have to be told if I was going anywhere, short notice or not.
I'm not asking you to go on a holiday!
Don't shout.
Robert, it's very nice of you, and I know what you're saying.
But I don't really know you, do I?
You knew me when I was a silly girl of 15.
Who fell in love with a handsome British soldier.
Do you know what I remember most about you? Your knees.
You're being ridiculous.
I'm not. I'm trying to prevent you from being ridiculous.
You're obviously not happy with your husband.
- How do you know?
- Because you wouldn't allow me to...
I didn't allow you to anything.
- I made love to you.
- Very nice it was too.
- Yes.
- So?
- So... nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing. Robert, please try to understand.
I have a house. I enjoy having it.
I enjoy having a husband who is a member of a very important Cuban family.
- It's important to me.
- Rubbish!
Don't speak to me like that.
You're talking about things.
Factories, houses.
- Husbands.
- He means nothing to you.
How do you know what Juan means to me or has meant to me? You don't.
If he means something to you, you shouldn't be here.
- Don't pick that up.
- Don't shout.
- Then pick this up as well.
- I don't know what you're playing at.
- You're unhappy. You won't let me...
- Don't you have a job to do?
I'm going to do my job.
- Then I'll see you sometimes.
- No, you won't.
- I see.
- What did you say?
I said I see!
I'm buggered if I do.
Quédate. Dame las llaves.
Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop!
- Good morning.
- Get out. I'm not hungry.
I'm starving.
Oh.
Well... had a good night?
Like to buy an aeroplane?
Not there, old man. it's outside.
The whole of Havana's on strike.
Not the whole, not yet, but it won't be long.
I had to walk up.
The elevator's out of action.
There you are, you see. Power cut.
Now, then, let's talk about my aeroplanes.
- How much?
- How much can you offer?
- They ain't worth nothing.
- They're going to be worth a great deal.
People are going to want to get out.
And they'll want to take out their goods and chattels.
- Have you got a car?
- Yes, a pick-up.
Even better. Here's what I'll do.
I'll buy your aircraft, I'll buy the cigars.
We'll get the cigars out.
I'll buy the Pulido place.
We'll make a delivery today.
What is the world gonna need?
Havana cigars, right?
Radio Rebelde.
Rebel Radio. Why?
Why has Agüero been elected?
You did not vote. You stayed at home.
But Agüero was elected because the election was rigged by Batista.
What can you do? You can strike.
A general strike is called
This is the voice of revolution from the men and women fighting for a free Cuba.
The end is near. Very near.
Batista soldiers are moving against us but cannot win.
They will be defeated by us and by you.
Strike. No telephones, no transport, no work in the factories.
Support the revolution.
Tell us, Batista, are you leaving now or later?
We know you have five aircraft standing by
for those pimps, pushers, prostitutes who are faithful to you.
Tell us, Sergeant Batista...
Jesús promised me there would be no strike.
Where is Jesús?
¡María, vámonos!
Dígame.
Ah, Ramón.
I think we've got a...
Very well, I will go to the rum factory first and then I will come to you.
And, Ramón, lock up everything and remove the money.
Everybody throughout Cuba has stopped work.
That is apart from servants, of course.
- I phoned Señor Pulido and...
- You had no right to do that, Ramón.
I can handle this.
Calma.
Your husband was shot this morning.
He lasted a long time.
Yes, he did.
I must tell Julio.
Go on.
Go on!
Go on.
¡Guerrillero!
Keep your stupid old mouth shut, woman, do you hear?
We're fighting for you.
One thing I'm certain. She's not involved.
What's the drill?
Try to get her as far away from the factory as possible, before anything happens.
Old man Pulido should be told.
He will be able to help.
¡Ven! ¡Ven! ¡Más! ¡Más!
¡Todo el mundo, fuera!
Follow me!
¡Sigan! ¡Sigan!
Line them up! Line them up!
¡Vale! ¡Vale!
Next. ¡Arriba las manos!
Nothing, eh? Next.
¡Levanta la barrera!
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Over there!
- Why were they shot?
- They tried to escape.
- From what?
- From being shot.
- How did they know they were rebels?
- They tried to escape.
- Wouldn't you?
- Yes.
- Are you a rebel?
- If I try to escape.
Wasn't it the same in Malaya?
- No, it wasn't.
- You're here to teach us.
I am not working...
- it's over, master.
- You're meant to be in charge!
¡Huelga! Down with him!
- Who dared to allow...
- They dared to.
- What will you do?
- Me? Nothing.
I'm here merely to take your leavings, Father.
Your houses, your old factories, your old mistresses.
How dare you talk about your wife in that way.
You would think he'd be the last drunkard that will ever be in Cuba. Look at him!
You load the truck, I'll go do the deal.
Um...
But sure...
What is this, Labor Day?
Go on.
Señora Pulido!
Just name the price, I'll buy the works.
The factory, every goddamn cigar you got.
It's no problem.
This very day I intend to fill a plane full of your cigars and fly to Miami.
All you gotta do is tell me how much.
You can stay here and run the factory for me until the whole shoot collapses.
All I want is two planeloads a day.
- I bought the trucks, the planes...
- Mr Gutman.
There's a man behind you with a gun.
Oh, dear. Um...
- Agh!
- Shh! Quiet!
- I will shoot this woman.
- I don't doubt that you will.
Search him.
Search him!
- With this you can go anywhere?
- Can you read?
I read law at university.
I'm not in the least surprised.
You can't use it without me.
There's a bad likeness stuck to it.
- You'll come.
-  Where?
- Load the guns.
- Where are you going?
- To Santa Clara, to Fidel.
- They are for the city.
We were told to wait here.
- I'm taking them to Castro! You come too.
- Ah!
So you can say "I was a Fidelista" before it is too late for Fidel to notice you.
I shoot her first if any of you try anything.
Put the guns in the truck and cover them with cigars.
Get up.
Is there enough fuel to get me to Miami?
- Sí, señor.
- Right.
- But the water dump tanks are full.
- Doesn't matter. I'll drop it out on the way.
Have a... whatever you drink.
¡Gracias, señor!
You're driving very badly.
Perhaps you're not used to driving such an expensive car.
Perhaps.
Why are you fighting for a country that's not yours?
I will fight for any elected government that makes me an offer for my services.
Would you fight for someone who paid you more?
No, I would never fight with a gun to overthrow a legitimate government.
So you decide which governments are legitimate?
Wonderful.
Oh, God. Guerrillas.
- Dame.
- No, but...
- El arma. Sí.
- I'm...
They will come out at us from the cane fields.
I told Batista our soldiers were too tired and did not want to fight.
- That is a fair assumption.
- We'll see.
We must hold on to the gasoline depot.
We must not lose that.
- Have you any interest in oil?
- Yes...
I am going to speak to Castro.
I will say to him "You got to get rid of the communists in your army."
"if you don't make a deal,
I'm going to harry and kill."
- Harry and kill. You know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.
We're full. Switch the flow onto six.
- What?
- Switch the flow onto six.
Juan, take a look at this. Come here.
Get up! Come on!
- ¡Por favor!
- Get up!
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco.
Probando.
Here we go.
If Batista's soldiers wish to surrender, they will be well treated.
I repeat, if Batista's soldiers wish to surrender, they will be well treated.
It is not a disgrace to surrender to your own revolution.
There is no honour in living a lie.
If you die now, you will at least die a free man.
Come home. Come to us.
We are you, you are us.
Stand still where you are and listen.
When you take prisoners who have fought for the revolution, you shoot them.
We, however, do not intend to shoot you.
You will be released, handed over to the
Cuban Red Cross and returned home.
Those who are criminals, guilty of crimes of torture, murder, you know who you are.
You may hide, but you'll be found.
The depot!
Tell the tanks that the gasoline depot is swarming with Fidelistas.
Chambelona Red? Over.
I hear you. Over.
Major Dapes.
That's right.
- You said he was to be killed.
- Be quiet.
This is Colonel Leyva.
You are to attack the gas depot Over.
Chambelona Red.
- Major, you are a paid soldier.
- Of course I'm bloody well paid.
We're not paid.
- You're not soldiers.
- OK.
But though we aren't soldiers, we're fighters.
And we are winning.
- We'll send the Yanquis home.
- I can't wait.
We'll fight the parasites that feed on the people.
The Church, gangsters, soldiers.
Soldiers are the worst parasites.
- Don't talk to him. Kill him.
- We're not killing anyone.
- I'll kill him.
- Would you care to try without a gun?
- Give me that!
- No!
I brought guns to you!
We did need guns, but now we need brains.
You go away and rediscover yours.
It isn't easy to be given a gun.
We make it a privilege.
What do you intend doing about thugs like him?
It might be more to the point to ask what they intend to do about us.
Get down!
Gutman, you can drive a car.
Then you can drive a tank.
No. What are you doing?
You want to go home? Then come on!
Pull it back! Come on!
Come on! Get out!
Hey! Look out!
Come on!
- It's just the same as a car.
- But mine's automatic.
Where's the goddamn wheel?
What are you doing?
- Pull on the sticks!
- What?
This is Colonel Leyva.
Do you hear me? Over.
- Got him!
- Who?
Get us off the road!
There's another one coming!
- Stick!
- Pull the left lever!
- Stick!
- Yes!
I can't see anything.
Keep it going.
You're over-revving.
Change gear!
You're flooding it!
Can I help?
Make bandages out of this. That way you won't ruin your nails, sweetheart.
Pull! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Come on, move! Get us going.
Soldier!
Someone!
Get them! Shoot straight!
Come on! Shoot!
¡Burro! ¡Burro! ¡Ya! ¡Ya!
- Shoot them!
- ¡Manos arriba!
¡Hemos ganado!
Gutty, come on.
Come on! Move!
Quickly! Hurry up!
- You'll roast in there! Come on!
- I can't!
Back! Go back! What are you doing?
-  Come on!
-  They're gonna bomb us!
Uh? Uh? Must have been one of ours!
¡Roberto!
We've done it, Spence.
I never thought we would.
- We got them to balance.
- Sure have.
Do you want to go out and see something of Havana now?
Sure.
Take the other one! This one's mine!
OK, but quick. Bello might come back!
Quick, let's go!
Pack your things as quickly as you can.
It'll take time to clear you with the British
Consulate and arrange your ticket.
I'll send the car back from the airport.
Where has she been, my wife?
With you?
Yes. She's been with me.
- Am I expected to take her back?
- No, you're bloody well not.
- Where are you taking her?
- Out of Cuba.
Why?
Cuba won't change.
A few people will leave. My father will go away for a while, so will Batista, and then they will both come back.
And once again Batista will get his face on the front of Time magazine.
Whatever you say, I want her out of here.
Stop talking about me as if I'm not here.
Robert, you don't understand.
I don't want to leave Cuba. Ever again.
I regard those years spent away as lost time.
There was nothing, and I include you, Robert, nothing that made them memorable.
No, I cannot go with you.
Stay here with me.
Robert,
I know what I've done to you and me.
But if you take me away from here,
I wouldn't seem the same to you.
- You don't understand, do you?
- You're right I don't understand.
I don't understand you or him or his father or even myself, sitting here bloody well discussing...
Hey!
Get in.
I'll send the car back.
It's up to you.
What do you think will happen to you?
Mind your own business, señor.
Thank you. That seems a perfectly reasonable reply, chum.
It's not like you to be so unselfish.
It's not like you to notice.
Where are the keys to the sports car?
In the car. Where are you going?
For a drive.
You will be back?
Pan American regret to announce that all scheduled flights are cancelled

Passengers should not leave the airport
Seats will be allocated on a first come, first served basis.

- Running away!
He is going again! Look!
Batista! ¡Bandido!
The ship must be sinking.
Cubana Air. The excess baggage regulations will not be waived
Please make sure you are only carrying that which is absolutely essential.
No! Leave it! Come on!
The forces of the revolution are on their way to Havana.
At their head is the man they call "El Caballo", Fidel Castro.
They arrive in buses, carts, anything with wheels.
It has taken seven days for this march up the Carretera Central.
- Mummy! Soldiers!
- Keep quiet and come with me.
Goodbye.
Ahh.
Everybody, make a line here, please.
Those who want to go, you go.
Please take your cases and pass through customs.
This way, please.
Air Cubana passengers.
Would all ticket holders please move in an orderly manner towards the gate?
Give this to Alex Pulido if she shows up.
I can't wait.
We talk to his comrades, the men who have fought with him
since 12 men came to Cuba and took to the Sierra to start the fight
At the palace
Fidel is reported to have said
that he does not need such a place.
He hopes the people of Cuba will keep an affection for the palace...
Tickets ready, please. Tickets!
Fidel! Fidel!
After five dark, anxious years the sun breaks through.

...the realization that the House of Orange is home again...
...fills the hearts of the Dutch people with joy.
SOLDI ER OF ORANGE
Get inside freshmen!
Come with me!
Climb!
Hello, I'm Jack Ten Brink, sir.
Prick, you mean.
- Prick, sir.
- Up, Prick!
What do you think of Hitler?
Filthy e xhibitionist!
He builds good motorways.
Are you for or against the sod?
Hitler's a bloody bastard.
Let him go!
Piss off!
May I introduce myself?
Jack Ten Brink.
You might know the name.
My father's on the Council.
Two more shirkers.
I'm Jack Ten Brink.
- Ale x.
- Eric.
- Were they hard on you?
- I've been here a while.
Someone made me say
Hitler is a bastard.
- Must have been a Jew.
- Can we stay here this long?
They have three weeks.
Enough time for a game of cards.
Freshmen to the dining room!
On your butts!
- Jesus, dinner time!
- The Council.
Everybody rise!
Down on the floor!
On your belly, prick to the floor!
And stay down.
Sit, sit, sit. Everybody!
And eat, eat, eat!
Bring them here.
Filthy shirkers!
You lot are in for it!
- Shirking, were you?
- No, sir.
- Perhaps you'd rather go home?
- I'd like to stay, sir.
- Would you?
- Yes, sir.
Sing for us.
Hum along.
Off ke y!
And again.
Off ke y.
Again.
Mr. President, this is a grave matter.
He's bleeding.
Hi, Eric.
Can you drink this yet?
Of course.
Hi, Esther.
I'll stay put if you don't mind.
Eight stitches.
- Unbelie vable.
- What happened?
It's a long story.
- We were...
- Not now, Eric.
- We're off to play tennis.
- No.
Tell us.
Well, it was the first e vening...
- Hello, ma'am.
- Good morning.
...puts it on my head and starts hitting it.
Wham, wham...
...and I kept singing.
Eric, you have a visitor.
The President.
Don't get up, Lanshof.
Your head after all.
Just a few stitches.
Telling your young friends about university life?
- Well...
- I'd like a chat with you, Lanshof.
Please sit down, sir.
You were off!
Are you coming?
My apologies for last night.
It was uncalled for.
It was nothing...
It was my fa ult. Is that beer?
Would you like some?
I intend to look after you.
There's a vacant room at my place. Want it?
Yes, thank you.
Your health, Lanshof.
Your health, sir.
- Call me Gus in the future.
- Right, sir.
Prick.
Thanks.
- Good, I'll copy them.
- You should attend lectures.
Mr. Particular.
You sound like my mother.
- I missed you today.
- I was bo xing.
- Eric's at home.
- I don't blame him.
Shall we go up for a drink?
Let's surprise him.
On my shoulders.
Nico? Or are you afraid?
No.
Come along with us.
How's the sherry?
Disgusting.
- I've got something stronger.
- Nice.
Give us a hand.
Ale x!
Pull!
- Gus might like a drink too.
- Call him, will you?
Gus!
Who's slinking about?
Professor Ten Brink.
I don't slink.
I was at Professor Teilders.
A prelim.
I passed!
A present...
...from my old man.
- That's a good one.
- A Leica.
German.
Ex cellent make.
- Want some?
- No, coffee. I'm in training.
I'll order some.
- One coffee!
- Hello, chaps.
- A drink?
- Please, one.
Take my chair.
- How's your lo ve life?
- I can't keep the landlady off me.
- Good looking?
- A figure...
One coffee.
For this gentleman, Greta.
We'll take a photo.
Mo ve closer together.
I'm going to Germany for a few weeks. Like to come?
No way. Trainloads of Jews arrive here e very day.
- I don't like swimming upstream.
- Cut it out, will you?
Don't mo ve.
Sit still. Watch the birdie.
It's coming!
As the nun said to the bishop.
Glass, glass!
Four, three...
...two, one...
Your health!
- Eric's good.
- You're better.
- Yes, at tennis.
- You should've played.
Guard duty.
Shut up!
Gus is a poor loser.
War!
- Jesus, war.
- Oh, the English...
We'll be neutral, as usual.
Don't be so damn stupid.
- What's with him?
- He's a Jew.
- I ne ver noticed.
- Prick.
- What was the score?
- Deuce.
Come on, Nico.
Turn off the radio, Robby.
Pencil!
Look, he can write.
May 9th...
What's the time?
- How's the army?
- A lot of wimps.
We could beat the Papuans.
Nothing will happen.
Do you mind?
Yes. A spot of war would be quite e x citing.
Gentlemen, it's time.
Robby!
We must be off.
Nico will take us to the station.
Mr. Particular.
Coming with us?
She wants to stay.
We'll get her home. Right, Eric?
- No problem.
- Well, Es?
I'd like to stay a while.
We'll show you out.
See you ne xt week.
Let's get going, Robby!
Off we go!
Bye, darling.
Why aren't you in the army?
Bad e yes. Everything's fuzzy at a distance.
But close up I see e verything, perfectly.
Robby and I are getting engaged ne xt year.
Congratulations.
- Lucky de vil.
- Who?
Both of you.
Want to dance?
Airplanes.
Are they ours?
We don't have that many.
Jerries.
Going to England.
Stop!
What do you want?
- We've come to volunteer.
- You must be mad!
- They're Jerries in disguise.
- We're Dutch.
Have them say 'sch'.
Germans can't pronounce it.
Sche veningen. Sche veningen!
Schele, schoonmoeder,
Sche veningen.
Let them through.
Eric, here.
We've come to volunteer.
Come back in ten days.
Officials!
We want to help.
Come back in ten days.
Ten days is quite reasonable.
- It'll be o ver by then!
- The last war lasted 4 years.
Come back in ten days.
Come on.
Come on, Eric.
- See you in ten days!
- Or sooner!
Been to a party, have you?
Yes, a party.
With schnapps and women?
Let's pay and go.
A tip e ven. Decent of them.
A fifteen minute rest!
Lieutenant.
- My folks live here, may I visit them?
- Go ahead.
Come in.
- You can shoot the lot of them.
- The damn traitors.
Dirty fascist.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Son.
Bunch of idiots.
Just beca use your mother's German.
Stupid. Stupid!
They think they can defeat Germany.
They'll pay when we get out.
The lot of them.
And how.
- You don't have it so bad.
- We'll see.
Did you hear about the Queen?
She fled to England.
And you have to fight.
German paratroopers!
Behind those wooden shacks.
- What's up?
- Paratroopers.
Look, there.
Check it out.
Co ver us.
Wounded.
Jesus, what are you up to?
There's a war on.
So what?
April fool!
That's Dirk.
There's a madhouse nearby.
I fooled you! April fool!
Attention! Salute!
What's going on?
False alarm about paratroopers,
General.
The war is o ver.
Rotterdam's been flattened.
Thousands of casualties.
We've surrendered.
Surrendered...
- But it just started.
- It's o ver.
The politicians and collaborators betrayed us.
But it's not our fa ult.
Holland can be proud of its army.
Men, I thank you!
Now what?
Line up!
I n position.
Put it down.
I n the water.
Go!
Come back, that's dangerous.
Do you want some more sand?
- Jerry slut.
- Mommy's bo y.
You're attracting attention.
It's free.
There's Eric.
Outboard motor.
Gasoline.
Put some in.
- The forecast?
- Calm sea.
Good, or I'll puke my guts out.
Sure stinks.
Hope the Jerries don't smell it.
Screw it on tight.
Stand still.
He y, bastards!
Fine little boat.
Sherry from Pa, cheese from my mother for the trip.
- Got the charts?
- Couldn't get them.
You said you would.
There's only one England and it's there.
No, it's there.
Why aren't you coming?
Someone's got to do the dirty work here.
You're just afraid.
Let's leave it at that then.
Your health.
Celebrating something?
Ale x!
- How about a swim?
- Good idea.
Haven't seen much of you lately.
At home. My parents have had a tough time.
Who hasn't?
Call in some time.
Ale x, I like you, but visiting your parents is a bit much.
I'll see you around.
That's all we needed.
- The dirty fascist.
- Ale x is a fine fellow.
- I smell petrol.
- What time do we leave?
The beach will be deserted in an hour.
I n two days we'll be in London.
Knock on wood.
- It's a sturdy boat.
- One leak and you've had it.
What can go wrong?
The petrol!
Let's get out of here!
Hello, Robby.
How about that Robby?
Hangs the wash for his mother.
You'll ask the English to come and get me?
- Is that it?
- I n code.
- Really?
- Yes!
I can hardly signal:
'Will London come for Mr. Lanshof? '
Isn't it dangerous?
If I keep it brief...
...the Jerries can't locate it.
We hope.
- A potentiometer.
- Want to measure my potency?
Good morning.
I'll make contact.
- How do they know it's you?
- I use a code.
I always begin with L-O-V-E.
Lo ve.
Guess why.
Go!
She's on to something.
It stopped.
- Well?
- You can go.
- As a courier.
- Meaning?
Getting stuff from my group across.
That's fantastic.
When?
I'll let you know.
I magine, me helping you!
Not a big area.
Ne xt time he transmits...
...he hangs.
You seem to be very happy.
Did you tell Eric about our engagement?
That's why you're called LOVE.
- It's a tennis term.
- What are you talking about?
It's the best news
I've heard in years.
Let me know.
UNIVERSITY EX CLUDE S JEWS
Read Volk en Vaderland.
Volk en Vaderland!
He y, look...
UNIVERSITY EX CLUDE S JEWS
Read Volk en Vaderland!
- Here, we'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, I can manage.
We're here to help one another.
We've got nothing against Jews.
That's fine, thank you.
No, we're not finished.
Do you have accident insurance?
You shouldn't have got in our way.
Just an accident...
Send the bill to Hitler.
What are you staring at?
It was an accident.
Cheer up.
It could happen to anyone.
Get those things out of the water.
- I suppose you're a Jew too?
- Yes!
I'll kill you, you bastard.
I'll kill you.
Don't be so stupid!
I nside!
You'll get yourself in trouble.
- I won't let them do it.
- Go out the back way.
All the Jewish professors have to leave the university.
Yes, I heard.
First the professors, then the students.
All the Jews will be in the Polish salt mines soon.
Student bo xing champ and nowhere to go.
You can go to England instead of me.
How? When?
You'll hear from me.
Robby's e xpecting me.
What's John doing here?
He's taking my place.
What kind of madness is this?
Robby, the Jerries don't like Jews.
I could've sent Esther.
Yes, you could have.
Come on, we can't stay here.
There it is.
To the boat!
We'll meet again.
- I n London.
- Hurry up!
See that you get this to London.
Jerries!
Robby!
I'm stiff from the long trip.
The young one first.
Come along.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- I'm sure you'd like some coffee.
- Smells good.
Uncuff him.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Would you like a cup too?
You seem surprised.
We've pro vided for you.
Sugar?
Don't I get anything with it?
With your second cup.
Egyptian cigarettes...
...but quite good. Take one, please.
I suppose you were e xpecting
English ones this morning.
Mr. Weinberg, you realize...
...we want some information from you.
I know nothing.
I was going to England to fight.
The war is o ver.
- Not for me.
- Yes, it is.
People died today.
Remain silent and more will die.
I don't know any of them.
Too bad.
Then I'll see...
...if those papers are dry yet.
Up!
The English don't send planes for no reason.
Who or what did they come for?
I know nothing.
You know nothing, do you?
You're tough, aren't you?
Bo x er's muscles.
Turn him round.
Do you have muscles on your kidne ys?
Enough, Breitner!
We don't work like that.
Have you gone mad?
My dear bo y, I'm sorry.
Sit down.
Drink the rest of your coffee.
Drink.
Just tell me what you know.
Today's affair didn't happen by accident.
I wonder who let the cat out of the bag.
The information...
...could only have come from London.
Van der Zanden.
Do you know this person?
Van der Zanden...
He's our contact in London.
That's not true.
It's an open secret.
It's all for nothing, anyway.
I suggest you talk.
Talk!
That's your trick.
Butter up a person...
...and then beat him.
I know nothing.
Breitner will continue working on your case.
Speak up! Who was there?
Tell me their names!
I don't know, I don't know.
Sorry about that.
Tell me what happened.
We tried to get John o ver to England, by plane.
The big time.
- But it went wrong, totally.
- What a pity.
They got John.
LONDON BOMBI NG RE S UME S
If he talks, I'll hang.
Amateurs.
Smirking, well-fed prick.
I'll hang.
So you come to me?
Gus, I need a place to hide.
Catch.
Ke y...
...to my front door.
Stay as long as you like.
RUSSIAN FRONT COLLAPSE S
His lordship.
Prick.
You'll be safe at my place.
Hello.
Any around?
Up there.
It's teeming with them.
They're migrating.
A bea utiful sight.
I'll try to get a bit closer.
Bye.
Is that him?
- And he's not after the birds.
- Thanks.
My mone y.
You're a good patriot.
- Is that all?
- It's the rate.
Well, if it's the rate...
Two beers.
You look pleased with yourself.
Will you take these to Nico?
Sure.
Photos of German bunkers.
What are you up to?
Be more careful.
Scared? Your health.
Your health.
Let me go! Too late!
Take them away.
Let me go!
It's nothing to do with me.
- They must have followed me.
- Nonsense.
- Shit. Why me?
- Risky business.
I hope I don't talk.
- Try to escape.
- How?
No talking.
Stop!
'The traitor is Van der Zanden in London'
Come with me.
On toilet paper!
- You're Lanshof?
- Yes.
'Yes, sir.'
I'll be courteous when you are.
Did you write this?
Yes, sir.
What did you write it with?
With shit, sir.
You must be mad.
This is no way to apply for release.
Perhaps I didn't have a pencil.
Ne xt time I'll have you shot.
You may go.
Where?
Home.
- You can't just let him go.
- I'm not.
He'll be followed.
Bait? A lure.
Exactly.
He might try to get in touch with the resistance.
- Then you'll have new guests.
- We have the space.
Here, or in the dunes.
I'll leave it to you,
Obersturmfuhrer. Goodbye.
Hello. Come in.
Let me take your coat.
- It's a wonder you're home.
- That's for sure.
I stopped by a few times, but you were always out.
- I'm back now.
- Yes, so I see.
Sit down.
It's a bit of a mess.
I was working.
- Tea?
- No, I don't have much time.
No need.
Robby is back.
Has he been away?
You know quite well.
He told me about the plane.
We can stop pretending now.
Yes. Where is he?
I n The Hague.
He wants to talk to you.
Come here.
See that man?
He tails me where ver I go.
Security Police.
- Robby wants to see you.
- I mpossible.
They'd grab him too.
Ale x!
A friend of yours?
Yes, and so what?
Bloody bastards.
And they call themselves Dutchmen.
How have you been?
It was touch and go.
That vet had quite a go at me on the kitchen table.
Decent chap, though.
My transmitter is operating again.
Join us, Eric.
John is dead.
I've lost the taste for it.
You're scared.
We were betrayed by someone called Van der Zanden.
- How do you know?
- John told me.
And he's in London.
We have to pass that on, Eric.
Go ahead.
- You really disappoint me.
- Too bad.
- I'm being watched.
- Probably.
I'm a threat to e veryone.
We'll decide that.
I'll decide for myself.
Did you see Robby?
Then we can open the curtains again.
Fine.
That chap must be wondering...
Let him.
Ex citing?
It's a boy's book.
I'll be off then.
The curtains were a good idea.
The things you think of.
Here, your shoes.
Are you sure about this?
I want it to happen.
Sir...
Do you know where
Victoria Street is?
If you turn left there...
...you come to a square...
...then you turn right...
Come along.
Good day.
My compliments.
It wasn't easy to find you.
- What do you mean?
- Your transmitter.
It's on the garden shed there, isn't it?
- Do you smoke?
- No.
Do you mind if I do?
Thank you.
I have a proposition.
Would you work for us in the future?
No!
Look.
Your fiancé I belie ve?
I saw her at Lanshof's.
She looks Jewish.
Jewish. She'll go to a Polish labor camp.
Not so good for the health.
Many people die there.
Let's go.
Won't you reconsider working for us?
Graduated?
Yes.
Congratulations, Eric!
You're the first from our year.
- I thought it would be you.
- I can't get finished.
Better hurry.
The university is closing.
Damn Jerries.
I've heard some odd stories about you.
The resistance?
All o ver and done with.
I'm happy to hear it, Eric.
We must consider the future.
Let's go for a drink.
Degrees will count again after the war.
There's Robby's fiancé!
How nice.
I graduated!
Congratulations.
Flowers for you.
Come for a drink with us.
Wait for me.
There they are.
Two gins. One with lemon.
So, a lawyer...
What are your plans?
- Take a holiday.
- On the Riviera.
That's impossible with the war on.
Jack, you're so wonderfully naive.
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.
Nico.
They're after you.
You're telling me.
Still want to go to England?
Are you joking?
There's a Swiss ship sailing tomorrow. They'll take you.
Is it safe?
It's a chance.
Nice of you.
You're putting us in danger.
Here are your papers.
Your name's Jean de Kuyper.
Here.
Shake it.
We didn't rent this bathroom.
I'm disappearing for a bit.
We've got visitors.
- Your Gestapo.
- This might take a while.
Have another drink.
- Real Dutch gin.
- Prewar.
Lt. Thelen, Security Police.
Polzer, ship's captain.
Two gentlemen from the Greek na vy.
- A drink?
- No.
You've taken on a Dutch crew.
We'd like to investigate.
They're not here yet.
But you're sailing in half an hour.
That's right.
I n 28 minutes.
You can't sail until we've seen the entire crew.
That's for us to decide.
- Where are the y?
- One moment.
Come with me.
There.
Cordon it all off.
Man both ends of the gangway!
Nobody goes aboard!
Attention!
- This is an investigation.
- Jerries!
Stop! That will do.
Murderers!
A net, lads. Before he falls!
Hello, Captain. Hello, Mr. Snooper.
You're drunk. Blind drunk.
What did he say?
You're drunk!
Right! When do we sail, guv?
Nobody comes aboard!
What? Nobody?
Nobody!
We're not allowed on board!
Back to the pub!
Lower away!
Get away from my car!
Get out of it!
Filthy pigs!
That will do.
Have them come aboard at once.
No, I'm fully a uthorized to have them locked up.
They're ha ving a row.
The na vy will decide this,
Herr Lieutenant.
Let them board.
Come aboard!
Form two lines!
Music!
Attention!
Salute!
You're sober?
To the stokehold.
We must put to sea before the y change their minds.
Ready, sir.
Eric.
We're on our way.
Gus. Well, I'll be...
We're on our way!
- How did you get here?
- Nico. And you?
Me too.
Mr. Particular.
I ntermission
Seasick?
We're sailing due north.
Nico said it was heading for Russia.
We'll have tea with Stalin.
What's that?
A battleship.
- German?
- I can't bloody tell.
English!
Wait, I'm coming too!
Goodbye, Captain!
- Bloody awful here.
- It won't take long.
The only English I know is
'fuck you'.
Hi, lo ve.
- We're going to fly, with the RAF.
- Are you crazy?
- And you?
- The army. More peaceful.
If you get a nice uniform...
Mr. Lanshof?
Congratulations.
A daring bit of work, your escape.
Not really.
We could get a ship.
Not so modest.
You're one of 50...
...49 to make it o ver from
Holland alive.
Come straight to the Queen when you've finished here.
We cherish our freedom fighters.
I'll arrange the a udience.
Ask for General Van de Zanden.
You'd better give that to me.
Come along.
You've read too many thrillers.
I can manage from here on.
But you lack training.
Ne xt time better.
That would certainly please the Germans.
Eric! Come and join us.
- What's going on?
- We'll have a cup of tea...
...and then we'll have a chat.
Aren't you Mr. Lanshof?
You may take off your coat and sit down.
I'll take this.
No, that's where Her Majesty sits.
- Odd way to come in.
- He couldn't find the front door.
That's a nice uniform...
- I'm starving.
- Eat, Willem.
Ma'am, what do I call her?
You call her 'Your Majesty'.
- Is it 'Her' or 'Your'?
- 'Your'.
It's 'Your'.
- No smoking in her presence.
- I hear she's strict.
- Not o verly.
- There she is.
I bid you welcome.
You are my link with Holland.
Your Majesty, may I present:
Will Dostgaarde...
...Gus Le Jeune...
Your Majesty.
...and Eric Lanshof.
Mr. Lanshof.
Your Majesty.
Won't you sit down?
No, my guests first.
Do tell me, what is the situation at home?
Home? Which home?
Her Majesty means the situation in the Netherlands.
Not good. The Jerries are stripping us bare, Her Majesty.
- Those German bandits!
- I mean, Your Majesty.
But when the war is o ver...
...what must we do about the fascists?
Don't you worry about those shitheads.
Mr. Van der Zanden, what does that mean, shitheads?
It's a term, Your Majesty, e xpressing how we feel about traitors.
Right, Mr. Lanshof?
- Who said I was a traitor?
- John...
...shortly before he was killed.
And then they simply let you go?
I don't see the connection.
It's simple. The Germans wanted you to belie ve it...
...and then pass the word around.
What would they gain by that?
I am head of intelligence and I'm Her Majesty's secretary.
They would lo ve the Dutch people to think I was a traitor.
They did a good job trying.
- How's the army?
- The dregs!
- I've got something else for you.
- What?
A trip.
Where to?
To Holland.
No!
- How did you manage that?
- I didn't, she did.
I thought someone was lying in wait for me...
...with a gun.
Don't go totally bonkers.
- Still seeing her?
- None of your business.
Yes.
- Any progress?
- None of your business.
No.
Forget about her.
Shit, I want to sleep with her...
...while I still can.
Cold feet? For Holland?
None of your business.
We consider your presence in London to be of the utmost importance.
Yes?
Mr. Lanshof, come on through.
Do you smoke?
Thank you.
- And you perhaps?
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.
Let's go for a stroll,
I find that very enjo yable.
You're returning to Holland, aren't you?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I want you to bring se veral people back with you.
Isn't that dangerous?
Our future leaders are in Holland, in the resistance.
I want them to be here.
The y, at least, are of the people.
Gentility belongs to the past.
Things will be different after the war.
The true nobles are the resistance fighters.
Don't you agree?
Mr. Lanshof?
You're absolutely right, Your Majesty.
I hadn't looked at it that way.
True nobles...
Is there anything else, Your Majesty?
I wish you success.
Idiot, the Queen's got a front row view.
Here, put your mind to this instead of neuken.
Stop showing off, you'll be shitting your pants.
I'm not e ven wearing pants.
Here. A matchbo x to keep it in.
That stuff smells disgusting.
It's enough to make you puke.
...to make you puke.
We've stopped.
Come.
Throw some o ver me.
Your health.
Gus.
Be careful.
GERMANY WI NNI NG
ON ALL FRONTS
Filthy Jew
Good Morning.
I'd like birth announcement cards for my da ughter.
What's her name?
Wilhelmina Juliana Bernardina.
Come. They're waiting for you.
- Is this address safe?
- We'd not be here if it wasn't.
You're a Red, aren't you?
I remember seeing you in the House.
Hardly a pleasant e xperience.
Possibly.
I don't recognize you at all.
Gentlemen, please...
I can't be part of this.
I refuse.
You've pledged yourself to Her Majesty.
I promised the Germans
I would take no action.
General, the Queen has asked you to be her adviser...
...for the postwar democracy.
Wilhelmina and democracy, a belated vocation.
Or rather, she's always been a little touched.
Religion.
This is her chance...
...to play Christ, to save the world.
Count me out.
What an odious way of saying that you're scared.
If I were 20, I'd take e x ception to that. Gentlemen...
Perhaps you have doubts about the new democracy too?
New democracy?
We've ne ver had democracy.
When do we leave?
You'll hear from me.
Fine.
Could we get ca ught?
If they get me and not you, tell the Queen what the socialists want...
...after the war.
I'll warn them.
Goddamn it!
Waterproof.
Stone dead.
Nothing. How can
I tell London when we're coming?
They only confirm receipt.
I nstructions will come tomorrow.
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No, thank you.
I can do more than just transmit.
We'll phone if we need you, okay?
Fine.
See you tomorrow then.
Well?
I don't know their plans.
They're not talking.
Bad show.
They'd be on to me if I asked.
You're not trying hard enough.
Which of Esther's jackets would this go best with?
I'd lo ve to see you against the wall.
You'd be right ne xt to me.
Goddamn it!
Idiot!
A present for your fiancé.
Might be the last time.
Who's that jerk?
A friend from the resistance.
If that's one of your friends...
Darling, we can't always choose our friends.
This de vice uses zinc coins only
Damn it...
An odd uniform.
- U-boat, I think.
- Or a destro yer.
Stop.
Get off.
The German Army claims this bicycle.
Filthy, goddamn Jerry.
Right, beach huts at 11 pm.
You're going to England?
Police.
On your feet.
They're dead.
Damn. That was close.
We've got to get out of here.
To the car.
- What about me?
- You need a place to hide.
- Where?
- I'll fix it.
- Fix it? I just shot two Nazis!
- Scared?
Yes! Do I have to stay and wait for them?
Don't leave me here.
I want to go with you.
I object.
I decide who comes.
It's only my opinion.
He's coming!
I'll answer for him.
- He'll need tails.
- There are some in the garage.
Let it ring.
They're gone. After them.
If things go wrong, don't let them take me alive.
This'll do the trick.
Cyanide.
After them.
It worked.
No answer?
Where's Robby?
I don't know.
He comes and goes.
But you're engaged.
He's always busy with his transmitter.
A permanent place is too risky, he says.
Don't you wear a star?
Forged papers, from Robby.
And the liquor, the chocolate...
From Robby too?
A man from Robby's group brings it.
We can't e ven get those things in London.
Robby's in the resistance.
They can get anything.
Do you belie ve that?
I have to go to my parents' place and get my tails.
Are you going to a party?
Yes... you could call it that.
Lord, where are you going?
- The lion's den!
- Don't worry.
If anything goes wrong I'll shoot.
Robby, shut up.
Papers, please.
Thank you.
My compliments.
An e x cellent forgery.
They're the real thing.
Mr. Particular.
Phone headquarters.
We'll cordon off the area.
Ah, this messy tomato sa uce.
Have the cleaning bill sent to Berlin.
The Fuhrer will gladly pay.
You there, get out of the way.
We're going to party.
I'll join you.
Come on in. Nice and warm.
Oh, you're a hea vy one.
Everything is arranged.
We're here.
Stay with us.
Come on, let's go inside.
All right, I will.
It saddens me to see you among all these fascists...
...bunker-builders.
Oh, it's war.
And it's a nice party.
I heard you were abroad.
Bullshit.
I heard you were in London.
No, I'm right here.
As you can see.
It's a shame we're not fighting on the same side.
A shame.
A few years from now...
...the Germans and English will both be fighting the communists.
I doubt it.
We won't see it.
We won't make it through the war.
- I'll see if he's down there yet.
- All right.
To London, old spy.
Are you spying for the Germans in London?
Will you bring back some nylons for me?
What a lo vely brooch!
The I ron Cross!
- How'd you earn that?
- I blew up a Russian tank.
- Here, you earned it.
- Piss off.
Spying is a lot riskier...
It's mine.
Give it back, dammit!
- It's not a to y!
- I ron Cross, I ron Cross!
Gus!
It's running like clockwork.
No. We're in trouble.
What trouble?
We've been betrayed, by Robby.
No. He's with me.
- He's coming.
- Robby's working for them!
Jesus Christ.
- Where is he?
- Up there with the others.
Wait for me.
Filthy bastard!
Stay where you are!
Nobody mo ve!
- Run to the beach!
- You are surrounded!
If you mo ve, we'll shoot!
Stay where you are!
Don't mo ve!
We're opening fire!
Split up!
I deeply regret what has happened.
Mr. Van der Zanden?
Your Majesty?
We shall not repeat this.
Thank you very much for your efforts.
That'll ne ver get there.
So what?
Bread? Bread?
Hungry?
We're going.
We have to go. Bye.
'Lo ve from Ale x.' Your mascot.
He'll get a bomb on his head tonight.
I'm not that much of a bloody fool.
Shut up.
He's waking the dead in their graves.
Open up.
We won't hear from him again.
Nuremberg. These Jerries are good shots.
They're not drinking this Christmas.
- How much longer?
- 15 seconds. Cheers.
Bomb doors open?
- Bomb doors open.
- Christmas present ready?
- Count down.
Bombs away.
And back home.
Her Majesty wants you...
...as her aide.
Long live the Queen!
No, thank you, Captain.
This, I would prefer to do alone.
Couldn't you have accidentally dropped a bomb on that palace?
Well?
It's short.
It'll grow again.
A present from our liberated compatriots.
Understandable.
I've no hard feelings.
I survived.
- You did too.
- Yes, that's true.
Ex cept, you're a hero.
What will you do?
Work in the garden.
Clean up the mess.
Jack!
Good Lord, Eric!
Come in!
You look absolutely marvelous.
Medals!
How did you get them?
Did some flying, dropped some bombs.
We scraped through.
Don't ask me how.
Would you like a drink?
I have a nice wine for special occasions.
...universities closed. I took prelims behind closed doors.
Risky business.
You had to take care.
We'll simply start where we left off five years ago.
Here you are.
What are your plans?
I don't know.
To the future.
Your health.
Howdy!
Scruffy lot of buggers, aren't they?
I bet they've just come off the boat.
- It makes you wonder.
- What?
What women see in 'em.
Yanks!
Yoo-hoo!
Jean! Jean! Come quick!
There's Yanks. Hundreds of 'em.
As if we hadn't enough of them already.
- Aye. Mother won't be pleased.
- But you will, eh?
Aye. I like Yanks.
Hey, sugar, you wanna hitch?
- Why don't you come in here with us?
- There's more room in a tin of sardines.
Yeah, ma'am, but not as much action!
Pretty country.
Look at all that green, Danny.
Winter and it's still green.
You think they've got any more like that little bus conductress?
Don't you think about anything else?
Three weeks on a boat pulling my pud and scratching louse bites.
You're diseased, Danny.
Brains all between your legs.
Tea break. That's all I ever hear around this goddamn place.
That's right, Sergeant. Fancy a cup?
I got 210 men due here any minute now.
They're gonna want water. They won't get any unless you fix the fucking pipe.
- It's fixed.
- Why ain't it coming out the other end?
It's waiting. Till it's turned on.
- This is good.
- Would it be possible to get it turned on?
- Yes. After I've had my tea.
- Fucking limeys.
Why don't you have a cup, Yank?
Calm you down a bit.
Don't call me Yank. I'm not a damn
Yankee. I'm from Ardmore, Oklahoma.
Howdy!
Give me some of that soap.
Hey, honey!
Oh, my God.
- Over here! Over here!
- Hey, will you look at that?
Dames! I'm feeling warmer already!
The Red Cross only do it for officers.
So don't put your uniform on.
They'll never tell the difference.
- Hey!
- Over here!
- Welcome to England.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Welcome to England.
- Hi, GI.
- Where are you from?
- Connecticut.
- Welcome to England.
- Thanks.
Keep your eye on the doughnut, not on the hole.
Thanks, lady.
Boston, Mass.
- Welcome to England.
- Hi, GI.
- Where are you from?
- Louisville, Kentucky.
Honey, it stinks.
- Have a nice hot cuppa.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- What's the matter?
- I think I'm in love.
I think you've been too long on the boat.
- Welcome to England.
- Get outta here.
- Where are you from?
- Arizona.
- Name?
- Private Jacques.
- Name?
- Ruffelo.
.I hear you're quite a boxer?
- Golden gloves. - Keep your hands to yourself round here.
- Name?
- Dyson.
It's a beautiful country. A little chilly. They forgot to put the roof on.
- What are the women like?
- I haven't met one yet.
- When do we get a pass, sir?
- What's a pass?
Thank you, ma'am.
- Welcome to England.
- Psst.
I got the truck for the orchestra on Saturday.
- Oh. Wonderful. Thank you.
- Can I have one with sugar?
Fantastic. Thanks a lot.
- And where do you come from?
- Burlington, lowa.
Stretch out. Make sure those waistline muscles are pulling.
- Morning, Dad.
- Morning, love.
Morning, Clarrie.
- Won't be a minute with your overalls.
- That's all right, love.
I like 'em warm, anyway. It's bloody freezing this morning on the bike.
- What shift you on?
- Nine till seven.
Not again.
You'll kill yourself, that's what you'll do.
Doing two jobs, it's just ridiculous.
It's the same for everybody, isn't it?
- Geoffrey, come and get your breakfast.
- Coming.
- You do look worn out.
- I am, love.
Mind the plate. It's hot.
- Geoffrey!
- Coming, Mother.
- Morning.
- Morning, lad.
- Morning, Geoff.
- Morning.
- Where did you get that hat from?
- Billy Rathbone gave it to me.
- Where did he get it from?
- The fish-and-chip run.
- The what?
- The chip run.
Kids fetch fish and chips for the Yanks at the camp.
- Billy's the big organiser.
- They pay us.
- He's letting me help him on Saturday.
- You'll do no such thing.
- Mother.
- Take that silly cap off at the table.
- Mother!
- Take it off, Geoffrey.
- They're very good to the kids.
- Are they?
You like your brother behaving like some little scrounger?
- Really!
- Perhaps it's how you see yourself.
Amusement to foreigners with more money than sense.
- Honestly!
- Your Ken might have something to say.
- Dad.
- They're only lads, Mother.
Soldiers thousands of miles from home.
- We should be grateful.
- Oh, but I am grateful.
We need all the help we can get.
But do they have to act as though they own the place?
Go on. Move it out of the way.
All the way.
Fucking limey rain.
- Driver, right on back to receiving.
- OK, Sergeant.
What we gonna do with all this shit?
No way. I'm not signing for something I didn't get.
Look on the manifest.
You got ten crates of binoculars.
- This is a binocular? Come on!
- OK, so they fucked up a little.
It's the army. What do you expect?
I got a little Scotch in the truck. You keep the sneakers, you get two cases.
- You trying to bribe a fellow officer?
- I gotta get outta here.
- I'm shocked at you.
- Four cases.
- Six.
- That's robbery.
I don't want the Scotch for myself.
Look at these poor, wet, miserable bastards. Outside working their asses off.
These are my men. I couldn't face myself if I didn't look after them.
You're as full of shit as a Christmas turkey.
- You're the one with his nuts in a wringer.
- OK, six cases.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Schmuck.
Convoy six, attention in the mess hall.
Some of you guys haven't stored...
- More onions and potatoes in there.
- Right.
Some of those leftover bones.
Give it some flavour.
- Sure thing, Matt.
- Cigarette out.
I'll take some of those grits.
What about some of those ham hocks?
A little bit of greens. Some gravy.
- I'll be back for the watermelon later.
- You do that. Next.
Hold on to it. Hold on to it. Hold on!
Let go! Let go!
- We got it!
- Don't lose it, whatever it is.
- A pass, dummy. We got a pass!
- No shit!
I hear some of these giris ain't seen men for years.
Can you imagine? Years.
Hurry up! Get changed!
They've waited years, Danny. I think they can wait a couple more hours.
Any more fares, please?
Any more fares?
Any more?
Any more fares, please?
Coach and Horses next stop.
Coach and Horses.
Coach and Horses.
Coach and Horses, Dad.
Come on, now. Any more fares?
Who hasn't paid me? Come on, now.
Night, Dad. Be careful.
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Who, the sergeant major?
He'd find the Coach and Horses with his head in a bucket.
Could an' all, that one.
- What did she say?
- I don't know.
How far you going, lads? No cracks from you, cheeky face. I've heard it all before.
Town, is it? First time?
Cat caught his tongue?
Shy. Very shy boy. Scared of women.
- Oh. Two fours, please.
- I'll get it.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
One sixpence, two pennies. Ta, love.
Any more fares, please?
D'you hear that? She called me love.
I don't think it's personal.
Last stop now. Come on. Everybody off.
This is it. Little America.
Town terminus.
Come on, lads. All out. This is it.
As far as we go.
- I heard there was fog. This is ridiculous. - Night, love.
- Is this town?
- Just a couple of minutes' walk, love.
- Follow that road there.
- OK. Thank you.
Hey, cherub.
- Me?
- Come here.
Here.
Just in case you get lost.
What's it say?
It says we're going to the movies.
All right!
# Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run
# Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run
# Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun
# He'll get by without his rabbit pie
# So run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run
- If they come, I'm not speaking to them.
- Don't. I'm not bothered.
- Do you want half? Last one.
- If you're offering.
# I've got tuppence to spend and tuppence to lend
# And tuppence to send home to my wife
My mother'll kill me.
If only you'd asked me first.
How could I? They were on my bus.
- Hey, there they are.
- # The sage in bloom is like perfume
# Deep in the heart of Texas
Excuse me.
Come on, come on.
This is Movietone.
Leslie Mitchell reporting.
The latest films to arrive from the Burma front show...
Sorry we're late, but it was so goddamn dark we couldn't find it.
It's a blackout, chuck. Show 'em a light and they drop a bomb on you.
- They're like that, the Jerries. Nasty.
- Shh!
- The name's Danny.
- Mollie.
- This is Matt.
- Hi.
- This is Jean.
- Glad to know you, Jean.
- Shh!
- I said glad to know you, Jean.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to watch the news.
The object of this attack was to obtain identification of Japanese troops reported to be in occupation.
- Cigarette?
- No.
Oh, ta.
- Did you see that?
- Shut up!
Matt, you gotta be quiet.
She's trying to watch the news.
Fish and chips four times, is it?
- Eating them now?
- I'm starving!
Help yourself to salt and vinegar.
Here you are, Jean.
There's nothing on 'em.
- Cod and chips twice.
- More batter here, Doris.
Get out of it! You can talk!
There, soldier. Get that down you and you'll not do so bad.
- You ain't kidding.
- Half a crown, love.
Oh, sure. Uh...
No, two shillings and sixpence.
Take him on one side and teach him.
He'd best learn t'money or they'll do him right, left and centre.
- Now, son, what's yours?
- Fish and chips, please. 36 times.
- We'll be here all night!
- You don't look like a boxer to me.
- What do you mean?
You know what they call me?
Boom-boom Ruffelo.
- Boom-boom!
- Really. Cos I got power in both hands.
- I got power somewhere else too.
- Bragging again, are we?
We're not having a very good time, are we?
No, I'm fine, really.
- You been out with an American?
- No.
Maybe that's what's bothering you.
- A girl gets a name going with
Americans. - I ain't...
And my family has a shop here.
- See you tomorrow, Jean.
- Mollie, wait a minute.
- Matt, see you at the barracks.
- I must go.
- Behave yourself!
- What are you so scared about?
- You don't have to be scared of me.
- I'm not scared.
Cos I tell you,
I'm the one that ought to be scared.
Think about it.
Here I am, God knows where,
God knows how long.
I'm out with the first real English girl I ever met.
That's pretty scary.
I told you, it isn't you.
- Somebody else?
- Hm.
- Right. He's in the army?
- Yes.
We're getting engaged when he gets leave.
But you're not engaged yet, so you can see me again.
I don't understand.
I've told you there's no point.
I'd just like to see you again.
Like tonight. We could go take in a movie, something to eat, go for a walk.
No fancy moves.
You just want a girl.
- The woods are full of giris.
- Pick yourself one.
Look, you never ever met anyone like me before.
- No one as modest, anyway. - I didn't mean it like that, like bragging.
It's like I never met anyone like you before.
Oh. I'm not that special.
Sure you're special.
I think everybody's special.
- First of all, you're a foreigner.
- Oh, I see.
Are we in America now? You shouldn't have any trouble finding your way home.
- I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.
- Good night.
Wait. Where are you going?
- It's all right. My mistake.
- You got me all wrong.
- Sorry.
- I take it all back. I'm the foreigner.
- I don't know how to get back. - Keep going till you get to the monument.
Thanks a lot. Where's the monument?
- Shit!
Where did you get it, Annie?
Our last kid brought it home with him.
- The one that was wounded?
- Aye, in Africa.
Said he'd have brought the bloody head as well if they'd let him.
- Here's your stamps, Mrs Shenton.
- Could have been worse, Clarrie.
- Could have been a Yank's.
- Ooh, I wish it had been.
With a Yank in it and all.
They're my sort of lads, the Yanks.
Hi.
- Can I help you?
- That's very kind of you, ma'am.
- Is it OK if I just look around?
- Yes, of course.
- Ta-ra.
- Goodbye, Mrs Shenton.
- See you.
- Bye.
Goodbye.
Sure there's nothing
I can help you with?
Yeah. Do you carry - what do you call them - bicycle clips?
- We do.
- Could I try them on?
Certainly. Jean, would you take care of Annie, please?
Yes, Mother.
- Hey! Those are clothing coupons, love.
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- Shall I put yours on account, Annie?
- Yes, please, love.
It's pensi髇 day on Thursday.
I'll have to get myself one of these lads. Pay you cash then, no danger.
I can't seem to find them anywhere.
You're not climbing ladders, Mother.
- Go and see to my dad's tea.
- Thank you, Jean.
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
- All right.
One pair of bicycle clips.
- I wanna take you to the movies.
- No, thank you.
I've already told you
I've got a boyfriend.
Perhaps you don't believe me.
You'd like to see a photograph.
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Maybe I should ask your mom.
- Don't you dare!
- She'd show me.
- Matt!
- Oh, remembered my name.
Now, please, be sensible.
- OK, let's both be sensible.
- Right.
- How much do I owe you?
- One shilling, please.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Saturday, the Ritz, eight o'clock.
- No, thanks.
- All right, I'm going.
- You are?
I look like the kind of guy to cause trouble?
.It's OK. I'll just be back tomorrow.
- Good morning, lvy.
- She's round the back.
.You're not much help
.standing there staring.
.I'm not staring, I'm admiring.
- You're early, aren't you?
- I'm always early.
.You just never noticed.
.Here, let me give you a hand.
- You'll get dirt on your uniform.
- I'm used to dirt.
.I worked my way through law school
.collecting garbage.
- I thought you washed dishes.
- I did that too. I did lots of things.
- Dug ditches, shovelled coal, drove a taxi.
- Phone, Miss Helen! Master Tim.
- Can you bring those leeks?
- Sure. That's what I'm here for.
.Tim? This is getting ridiculous.
.Nothing but phone, phone, phone.
.Why aren't you at school?
.I am at school. They're playing rugger.
- Shouldn't you be playing too?
- Yes, but... I try.
.I'm just no good at it.
- They all bully me.
- I see.
.I try my best, Mum.
- What do you say, giris?
- Hi.
- Fresh new crop of Gls just came in.
- Hey!
.Hey-hey! Huh?
.Just kids, most of them.
.Ivy, listen. This is for you too.
.Don't break their hearts.
.I gotta turn them into a fighting machine.
- Before you start, would you like tea?
- No, thanks.
.I'm floating in the stuff. I'm gonna go
.into the living room. The drawing room.
. It's terrible for all of us. How do
.you think Daddy feels about being away?
.Hm. That's better.
- How are you, Mrs Moreton?
- Can't complain, Captain.
.Good.
.Yes, I will write tonight. Right. Chin up.
- I'll see you in two weeks.
- Yes, all right. See you then.
- Yes, bye.
- Bye, darling.
- I can't play when anybody's watching.
- I like watching you play.
.So angry with yourself when you make
.a mistake, as if you weren't allowed.
- It tells me something about you.
- That I can't play the piano, yeah?
- Are you cold?
- Well, it ain't Miami.
.You don't have to drink it.
- What was all that about?
- I said no to a cup of tea.
.Sacrilege.
- I got a letter from Ann today.
- Oh, you must be pleased.
.Peter hasn't written for weeks.
.Well, he'll have written, of course, but...
.She sold our house.
.Just like that.
.She put the furniture into storage, packed
.up the kids and moved in with her family.
- Didn't want to bother you.
- She didn't tell me till after it was done.
- She doesn't even like her family.
- Perhaps she didn't want to be alone.
.I wonder why she didn't tell me, though.
.Do you tell her everything?
.So far.
.I remember we did talk about it.
.I mean, when I knew
.I was gonna come overseas here,
.and the fact that I might not come back.
- She'd be saddled with responsibilities.
- That's a bit pessimistic, isn't it?
.Yeah, I think she'd call it realistic.
.When Peter went away, we decided
.we'd play it down, take it in our stride.
.Everyone did. We had to.
.Three very long years.
.Where would we have been
.if we'd been realistic?
- Here.
- Oh! Thank you.
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Hello. Ooh!
.Stop that!
- Son of a bitch!
- All right!
.Go on. Shoot one. Shoot one.
- What happened to Liverpool?
- Football final!
.Come on, get your paper!
- Hello, Jean.
- Oh, hello, Mrs Bradshaw.
- Get a load of that!
- Hey, baby!
- How about a drink?
- How about me? Mine's a port and lemon.
.That Betty Grable's a bit of all right!
- Hurry up. It's starting.
- Two 1/9s. That'll be 3/6.
- Hey, look. Do you like that?
- I like it just a whole lot.
- That's a shame, cos I saw her first.
- Three.
- Hi, honey. How are you?
- Hello.
.We've got a problem.
.My stupid buddy bought three tickets.
- Wanna join us.
- No, thank you.
- Waiting for someone?
- I'm waiting for a friend.
.Boyfriend, girlfriend, what?
.Give the lady a drink.
- Have a drink.
- No, I don't care for it.
.What are you doing?
.Want me to wring your neck?
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, sarge, come on. Have a drink.
- You wanna drink? You wanna drink?
- Matt! Matt, please!
.Come on. Jesus!
.Oh! Not bad for a Scotsman!
- What did you say yours was, Tex?
- Half-and-half.
- A chaser.
- Two chasers and a pint of bitter, please.
.Two chasers.
.He's not a bad dart thrower, Tex, is he?
- He's getting better every night, this one.
- A twenty, a five and a bull!
.Right, son. What can I do you for?
.Yeah, I'd like a sherry and a half-and-half.
.Half-and-half coming up. New in?
.Yeah. Last month.
- Bloody cold, eh?
- Cold? Cold I can take.
- I don't know about this wet.
- You'll get used to the wet.
.Another couple of months, you'll be
.coughing your guts up with the rest of us.
.Now, then. Sweet or dry?
- What do you think?
- Sweet.
.Bloody Yanks.
.Bloody Yanks coming over here.
.Why don't you bugger off home,
.back where you bloody belong?
.Sir, I didn't ask to come to this country.
.I was drafted.
.If you've got any kind of influence,
.I'd be grateful to get back where I belong.
.The sooner the better.
.Sherry.
.Take no notice, lad.
.He's just lost his boy. Burma.
- Right, lads.
- One bitter, please.
- And half-and-half.
- Coming up.
.Sometimes I got a big mouth.
.Say things I shouldn't.
- How do you drink warm beer?
- It should be easy with a big mouth.
- Evening.
- Evening, George.
.That's our diner, there.
.Just outside of Tucson, Arizona.
.Own that free and clear.
.Dad does, anyway.
.That's him. Dad and my brother Eddie.
.The pretty one there is me.
.I'm the short-order cook there mostly.
- Short-order?
- Hot dogs, hamburgers, cheeseburgers.
- Oh, you mean snacks?
- Yeah, I guess so. Snacks.
."Adam and Eve on a raft."
.Know what that is?
.Two poached eggs on toast.
- You got a nice smile.
- Thank you.
.You ought to smile more often.
.Where's your mother?
.She died when I was a kid.
.I don't remember her too much.
.After the war are you going back
.to work for your dad?
.Not a chance.
.I haven't told anybody this before.
.You know what a motel is?
.Well, a motel is kinda like a hotel
.on the highway, you know.
.You stop off there. You got
.your own little cabin and bathroom.
.They're springing up all over the States.
.I'm gonna build me one of them.
.I got a place all picked out too.
.It's on a canyon.
.The top of the canyon flattens out
.and I'm gonna build it there.
.It's beautiful. Out there you've still got
.wide open spaces. Roads are straight.
.Not like here. When I come here,
.I feel kinda hemmed in, you know.
.Anyway, that's what I'm gonna do.
- I'm sure you will.
- I will.
.And when that one gets going,
.I'm gonna build another one.
.And then I'm gonna build another one.
.And another one.
.Your guy, does he bring you up here?
.Ken? Yes, since we were kids.
- Known him a long time, then?
- We grew up together.
.That could be nice.
.No surprises any more.
.You in love with him?
- He's everything I've ever wanted.
- That's not what I asked.
.I heard what you asked.
.Everybody loves Ken.
.I guess all the luck didn't fall on Arizona.
- Morning, Sally!
- Get to the back of the queue!
.It's for oranges, love.
.Ooh! About time an' all!
.Do you mean the one who was here
.the other day for bicycle clips?
.Yes, Mother. He's a friend.
.You've always told me to bring my friends
.home. He wants to meet you.
- I've no wish to meet him.
- Who the hell are you?
.Jean. Jean.
.I'm sorry.
- He's different, Mother. He's decent.
- Decent! How do you know he's decent?
- Plenty of them are.
- You know plenty of them?
.No, of course I don't.
.I don't understand
.how you can put Ken in this position,
.knowing how people feel
.about these Americans.
- He knows about Ken. He understands.
- How do you know?
.Because in three weeks
.he's never touched me.
- Come on, love!
.I wish they'd have a bit of patience.
.I'll be with you in a minute, ladies.
.It's not even 8.30 yet.
.Now, look, Jean.
.Your lad's away in the army.
.You can't ride two horses with one arse.
.We enjoy one another's company,
.that's all.
.He asked me to tell you
.before somebody else did.
.It doesn't affect Ken and me.
- Where do you want this?
- Where they can see it.
.I don't want any more arguments
.this morning. I don't feel up to it.
- Come on, Clarrie.
- Sorry. I won't be a minute.
- Sorry.
- You took your time, didn't you, love?
- Good morning.
- Nice to see you.
.Hello. Come on in, it's cold.
.Sorry, just one each. Sorry.
.The missus'll sort it all out.
.Jean. I don't want to be prejudiced.
.Honestly I don't.
.So you can ask your friend round
.for tea on Sunday.
- Thanks, Mother.
- Let's hope nobody tells Ken about it.
.Now, then, ladies. Let's have
.a bit of order here, shall we, please?
- Can you serve me first?
- I was first in the queue!
. That is why I want you to know...
... want you to know
.that it was only an accident
.and I didn't get damaged
.anywhere important.
... damaged anywhere important.
.Think she's gonna know
.what that means?
.Well, she wouldn't know
.if she saw you now.
.I want her to know
.that I'm not gonna be able to walk so good
.but I can still... you know.
.Hm. You can still...
.I want it to be not... you know, crude...
.Why don't you tell her
.that you can still make love?
.Yeah.
...was only an accident and I didn't
.get damaged anywhere important.
.Get out! Be off!
. Post, Miss Helen!
- Get down, I tell you!
- Riley! Come here!
- Morning, Arthur. How's your grandson?
- He's doing champion, thanks very much.
- There's nothing from the navy.
- No, there isn't.
.Thank you.
.Get down, will you?
.It's mostly bills.
- There's one from Tim.
- Oh, poor kid.
- If you ask me, I think it'd be best if...
. "Dear Mum, please let me come
.home. I hate it here."
."They bully me because they say
.I don't try hard enough at games,
.but I do my best."
."I don't want to let you and Daddy down,
.but I want to come home so, so much."
."I don't fit in here.
.You must understand. Please."
."All my love, Tim."
- Very good. Well done, darling.
- Jolly good.
- How's Anna?
- Fine. She sends glowing letters.
.I'm afraid Tim's inherited
.all my insecurities.
.Oh, Helen, he'll soon settle down.
.We had the same problem with Patrick
.when he first went away to school.
.You mustn't give in to him.
.Nobody likes to see a boy unhappy,
.but you must not give in.
- Some take longer than others.
- A question of backbone.
.You have to ask yourself "What is it..."
.Do you think I should bring Tim home?
.I don't think a kid should have to
.stay miserable for the sake of tradition.
.It's a very good school.
.He could get over his problems.
- Peter and all his family went there.
- Yeah, well, Tim's not Peter.
- You don't believe in tradition?
- Not in that kind. Neither do you.
.Do what you feel
.and never mind duties, responsibilities...
.All those things aren't much unless
.you can support them with feelings.
.They hold you together sometimes.
.Let them go. You won't fall apart.
.Are you happy?
.I like what I'm doing.
.Do you sleep well at night?
.Planes keep me awake.
.You're incredibly beautiful, you know.
.Thank you.
- I've said that to a lot of women.
- I'm sure you have.
.I even meant it once or twice.
.Nobody's ever surprised me like you do,
.you know.
.Go with your instincts.
.You make it too simple.
.I come from a simple, primitive people.
.Mongrels. We got no traditions.
.Trust your feelings.
.I feel...
.that you should go back to the camp
.and I should go up to bed.
.Wrong again. Don't trust what you feel.
.Thank you, John.
.You do help me, you know.
.Just think of me as the Red Cross.
.Don't let the planes keep you awake.
.First time you've cooked
.since you've been sergeant.
.Why do you think they promoted him?
.Who are you poisoning this time?
.Fuck you and the boat that brought you.
.Look! He's using real eggs!
- It's got to be for a girl.
- What else is worth all the trouble?
.You ever noticed
.how much limey giris stink?
.As a matter of fact, it's not just the giris.
.All limeys stink.
- What do you mean, stink?
- They don't wash, so they stink.
- Some stink. Some don't stink.
- They all stink.
.Their hair, their clothes,
.everything about them.
.We must be getting used to it.
.But they still stink.
- My girl don't stink.
- You don't smell it any more.
.No, I've seen her wash.
.I don't wanna hear no more about it.
.OK, sarge. OK.
- She don't stink.
- OK.
.Even if she did, you know what? I'd like it.
- The table looks lovely, Mother.
- Is it all right?
- Ham as well?
- You wouldn't know we were rationed.
.Let's hope he likes it, Jean. Geoffrey, go
.and fetch me some chutney. Home-made.
.There's an article
.about the three Roberts boys.
.Lost at sea when the ship went down.
.I'd better call round.
.Don't mention that
.in front of the American, Jim.
.Why the hell not?
.Wouldn't be tactful.
.He's not seen active service.
- It's the Yank.
- Why didn't you open the door?
.He's not coming to see me.
- Hi.
- Hello. Would you like to come in?
.Thank you.
- I hope I'm not late.
- No.
.No, of course not.
- This is my brother Geoff.
- Geoff.
.How you doing? Hi, I'm Matt.
- Hiya.
- Put it there.
.I brought you some things I thought
.you might like. Candy, comic books.
- Can I take your coat?
- Yeah, thanks.
- Mother, this is Matt.
- Hello.
- Matt, this is my dad.
- Nice to see you again, ma'am.
.I appreciate you asking me here.
- Mr Moreton.
- How do you do, son?
- I brought this for you, ma'am.
- Oh. Thank you.
- Look what I got. A tin of fruit.
- That's very nice.
- Matthew, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's right.
- After the apostle.
- Yeah.
- I hope you won't be offended, sir.
- Oh, thanks.
.Offended? No. Thank you very much.
- Yes.
- Aren't you going to open yours, Mother?
- Nice!
- Oh, it's lovely!
.It's made with real eggs, ma'am.
- You made it?
- That's right, ma'am. Just me.
.Well, it really is lovely.
.But I don't think we'll have it tonight,
.thank you very much.
.We've got quite enough already.
.We're having this tonight, no danger.
.Thanks.
- How you doing, Mr Moreton?
- Fine, fine.
- This is a beautiful town round here.
- Yes, it is.
.Wonderful, wonderful country.
.We don't get fresh ham often.
.It's usually canned.
.It's nice for us.
.Special occasi髇, you know.
- Do you grow these vegetables yourself?
- No. We have done.
- You have a garden. I saw it.
- Jim's a very good gardener.
.We have a garden back in Arizona.
- I really can't eat any more, Mrs Moreton.
- Did you enjoy it?
- Can I have that, please?
- No.
.Can I have your plates, please?
.This? That's something
.I sent the wife from the front.
.They came round
.with the needles and ribbons and that.
- You made it?
- Yeah. Strange, really, isn't it?
- What are these?
- The medals they gave us.
.That's the victory medal there,
.and the 1914-18 war...
.That's what we call a pineapple.
- A pineapple?
- Here. Give that a try.
- Good, isn't it?
- Yeah, great.
.Now we'll try this thing here.
.Here's a peach.
.I can see what you see in him, Jean.
.He's thoughtful. Very pleasant.
.If it wasn't for Ken...
.I just wish we knew more about him.
.That's it, Danny! Kill the limey!
- Bloody Yankee!
- Get away from him! Stay away!
. Smash his bloody ugly face in!
.Hit him! Keep your head up!
.Hit him in the guts! Come on! Go!
.Go on, Danny!
. Danny, get that limey bastard!
. All the way, USA!
.All right, Danny! Champ!
.How are you?
- All right. How long you home for?
- Two weeks of freedom.
- Let's wear your hat.
- Go on, shorty, but I want it back.
- Hello, Mrs Shenton.
- Hello, Ken, love. Welcome home.
.Thank you. You're looking well.
.How are you? Can I carry your kitbag?
.No mucking about. Government property.
.Come on, shorty. Pick your feet up.
.You all right, lad?
.Huh? Yeah, I'm all right.
.Come on, snap out of it.
.Well, Jean, you're a grand girl and
.we've watched you grow up with pride.
.And we don't give you away easy.
.It'd take a special kind of lad
.to persuade us.
.But Ken here, well, he is.
.You know, us old 'uns,
.we do our best here at home.
.But it's youngsters like these two
.that bear the brunt.
.The danger, the separation and the worry.
.So good luck to you both.
.And let's hope this bloody war's over
.by the time we all get together
.to put the rubber stamp on it.
- Hear! Hear!
- So raise your glasses to Jean and Ken.
- Jean and Ken.
- All the luck in the worid.
- Congratulations, love.
- Thanks, Auntie Maud.
.Come on. You act
.like she's the only girl in the worid.
.You ever hear of other fish in the sea?
.Like that one right over there?
.She's nice, but she's with somebody.
.Chee.
.Excuse me. Would you care
.to take a little twirl round the dance floor?
- I'm just having a drink.
- The lady's with me.
.She doesn't want to dance.
.I didn't hear her.
.Do you wanna dance with me?
.Well, no, thanks. I'm with friends.
- Why don't you...
- You don't dance with Americans?
- Look, shove off.
- No, I don't dance with Americans.
- We're having a good time. Leave us.
- Don't dance?
- I got cigarettes here. Want cigarettes?
- No, thanks.
.You take cigarettes from Americans.
.Have a cigarette.
- Have a couple of cigarettes.
- That's gone in my drink.
- Maybe some whisky...
- We don't want any.
- Drinks on me!
.Bloody hell!
. Come on, let's get outta here!
.Come on, man! Move it! Go! Go! Go!
.# I like your lips and I like your eyes
- Whoa! What the hell's going on?
- Try down here!
.Yanks. Yanks.
.Come on!
.Round the back here! Further on!
.Jean.
- Jean.
- Hey.
- Hey. You OK?
- Yeah.
.Come on. We need a drink. Let's go.
- Teddy! Teddy, open up!
- Come on.
- Teddy, we want a drink.
- Come on, he's not here.
- Teddy!
- You're gonna wake everybody up!
- Rise and shine, Teddy!
- You're crazy!
.What the bloody hell's going on?
.Do you realise what time it is?
.What the hell do you want?
- We want a drink.
- Oh, it's you two, is it?
- Get us a half-and-half.
- OK, lads. Half-and-half coming up.
- Half-and-half, half-and-half!
- Half's mine and half's the wife's.
- Shit!
- It's piss.
- All right, Eddie!
- Wait a minute!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Take your hands off me.
.Sounds to me
.like you were looking for a fight.
.Yeah, I was, sir.
.You've been running
.with the Moreton girl?
.Yeah, I took her out a couple of times.
.Nothing serious.
.It's very easy to get involved
.with women while you're over here.
.But it's their country
.and you gotta play by their rules,
.even if you don't understand
.them sometimes.
Look, sir, I got drunk, made a damn fool of myself.
No excuses.
Confine them to the company area for a week.
If you're caught fighting again, we'll take your stripes.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Take a hike.
On platform one, London Euston train, calling at Stockport and London Euston.
Nice to have something to laugh about, eh?
- Ken...
- Listen, Jean.
The er... The garage.
My dad says it's mine when it's all over.
I'd like it.
I can build something for us out of it, honest.
I know you can. I know that.
It would be pretty plain sailing, Jean, you and me. Maybe a bit too plain.
If we come through it the same, at least we'll be certain, won't we?
Just get back, eh? Just get back safe.
Train at platform one is the London train calling at Crewe, Stockport and London.
Passengers for North Wales, change at Crewe.
Passengers for North Wales...
Hey, lads, where you going?
They're not as cheap as us in London.
- I don't envy you that lot.
- Shall I send you one for Christmas?
No, thanks. I think I'd rather take on the flaming Japs.
- Ken...
- Now, you're not to worry, kid.
This new lot I'm joining, they're no mugs. Crack troops.
Better than scrubbing around in the infantry, eh?
- There's something I want...
I love you, kid. Be happy on your say-so.
- I'm asking nothing, right?
- Ken, please.
- I'll be thinking of you every minute.
- Ken, look after yourself.
- Look after yourself.
- Goodbye.
- Don't forget to write.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
Goodbye!
- See you soon!
- Bye!

- In London. We went up specially.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

- Absent friends.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
- I'll go.
- No, it's all right, lvy. I'll get it.
- Hi.
Oh, hello.
Everything's burning...
Tell me, Major,
What were you thinking about, then, before the landing?
I don't remember.
I bet you were afraid.
Nobody wants to die.
Not even that dog Hitler.
But what can you do?
Either you get them or he gets you.
Who the hell knows, thought Lopatin afterwards.
Why do I remember this and not that?
After that landing there were 
Don and Stalingrad,
I was wounded twice...
But what I remember now is the fog spread over the winter sea, the morning before we returned to mainland, what that soldier said to me about Hitler,
Pasha Rubtsov in his cap looking like a German POW.
Why does it come back to me now?
Maybe because a year has passed and you're still alive, but he isn't?
Because you're taking his things to his wife in Tashkent, and not the other way around?
Why?
Hey, Lopatin, what if the war lasts another year, soldiers may get leaves...
I'm thinking more about the next day, Pasha...
I have to type up an article about the landing.
...your bag's burned through...
... it fell in the fire and got burnt up...
Sergeant! Sergeant!
The kid didn't make it.
Hurry up!
Medic! Sergeant!
Pardon me, Major.
Help you with the boot? 
- No, thanks.
TWENTY DAYS WITHOUT WAR written by 
KONSTANIN SIMONOV directed by 
ALEKSEI GERMAN starring

Liudmila Gurchenko
I take mine this way, he's there,
I go this way, he goes that way,
I try here, he's there again,
I go low, he goes through and turns back.
I go even lower, he truns again,
I'm like that, he goes past and makes a turn...
I'm like this, he's like that,
I see a clearing and go for it, he goes too low and BAM! right into the pine trees.
Familiar places?
No, I'm looking at the lights.
Haven't seen them in a while.
I spent a week in a village.
Not much light there, all kerosene.
I kept looking at the lights in the windows.
It really gets you.
You catch our advance at Stalingrad?
I caught a bit.
What you got going in Tashkent?
Business or leave?
Business and leave.
Twenty days, that's all.
You're trash, always were!
Some business...
Hocus-pocus!
Where're you going? 
This way!
You like jokes, Major?
When they're funny.
No more tea... you're on your own.
In the summer 
I get a letter,
Forgive me, Yura, 
I done wrong.
I send a telegram: what sort of wrong?
I feel something's bad.
Turns out, the schoolteacher came back, lost three fingers.
She was renting from his mother, and, you know...
Three fingers didn't get in the way.
I run to the pay office, sign a petition, annul the certificate,
I can't sleep, can't eat,
I'm just imagining them, you know... making love... amongst themselves.
Well, nothing doing. I throw myself under fire. but it's like I'm charmed or something.
I started going savage, four months like that.
It's just gnawing at my heart,
I want to tear it up and toss it away.
After four months the comissar calls me up, says, you're going to receive the new planes, a week's official leave, can go see your wife.
I say, no more wife.
He says, Yeah, I read your stupid petition, the certificate's annulled, she's got it...
I'm thinking, let them choke on that certificate...
Ok, I say, I'm going.
I get to the district council there, an officer meets me, says how do you do...
...nothing but dust, no coal at all...
Says, I got a telegram from your superior it's 22km to your place, why don't you spend the night with us.
A nice kid. Come spend the night, says,
I'll get you a horse in the morning, you'll be on your way.
We get there, his wife setting the table, we sit down, drinking, not talking.
He says, I know the whole story...
I say, that's fine...
I didn't get what he was talking about. 
I'm like a deaf-mute.
He's a good drinker, me too. 
So, we're drinking...
He says, I have a favor to ask you.
But you give me your word that you'll do it.
I say, sure, I'm just not following...
He says, you do what you have to, but I don't want to see no corpses.
And he knocks on the table.
Well, I got nowhere to go.
At night I'm sleeping, thinking, he didn't knock for nothing...
I can't run away.
So, I get to the village.
My kid runs out to meet me.
Where's your sister, 
I tell him.
In the hospital, he says, she's sick.
He says, is your gun loaded, dad?
I say, hold up there boy.
Where's mama?
At work, he says, she'll be back late.
I come in... She was working at a lumber mill...
You understand, this big man is doing 2+2, while a woman's stacking lumber.
I go into the teacher's house and sit down at the table.
The mother, she's this tiny woman, you see...
Just a minute, just a minute, and runs off screaming.
Help!  help! there's a murderer with a gun at my house.
My kid was friends with his, he runs over and says,
My daddy's back, he's got a big gun, he'll kill your daddy.
The teacher locks up the school and runs off to the council.
I'm still sitting. People start milling about the house, looking into the windows here and there,
I was mad. 
Lord save us!
I was scared of myself.
Late in the evening, it was 
long after sunset, she comes back.
Comes in - says, how do you do.
Chirp, chirp, the cricket's chirping, and it's just crushing my head,
I don't say a word.
She says, don't you recognize me?
I'm like paralized, can't open my mouth.
I just can't get my jaw to open.
She sits down, we had some food, put the kid to bed, all in silence.
Finally, she couldn't take it anymore.
She says, Yura, since you sent me that letter,
I didn't have no relations with him no more.
Ask anybody. 
She's crying.
I love you, she says,
I still can't say anything.
The lamp is burning.
In the morning I went to see my daughter at the hospital, came back, she's still crying, then she says,
Yura, sweetheart, forgive me, for christ's sake, and crying.
That sweetheart, it really got to me.
I grabbed the table. 
Silence, I say!
I'm clutching the table just to keep in check.
I started saying all kinds of things.
Calling her a whore, cursing!
I'll kill you, murder you!
I held back, though.
She fell silent, and that was it.
And since then I had no relations with her.
I clenched my teeth at night, that's how.
Sure I looked at other women, but they belong to someone else.
I'm no saint that I don't look.
But it's the truth, I didn't touch her no more.
Sure, the last night...
I couldn't take it.
I went for it, thought she'd push me away.
No, she just lay there, real quiet like, not making a sound.
She just says, you forgive me?
I say, no, no I don't.
I got up early, didn't even say good-bye to my kid.
Left there, and that's it.
Major, Major, do you hear me?
Sure I do.
I have to ask you something.
Just promise me you'll do it.
Just like in your story?
Can you write her a letter?
So she knows what it's like.
In your name?
Right, like as though 
I wrote it.
I'll copy it in my hand afterwards.
You don't even know yourself what you want.
No, I don't.
Sure, I should forgive her.
She didn't live with that clown no more.
People told me.
But it's hard for me.
How can I write a letter for you?
What if you don't like what I say?
I'll like it. I read your stuff and I like it.
I have a notepad here and a pencil.
I have my own.
No, please take mine.
It wasn't just for the children.
It was for her sake too that I came.
So that she feel what she'd done to me.
What's her name, anyway?
Valentina Stroganova. 
Valia.
I won't bother you. 
I'll just sit here.
...beneath great weeping willows the poor gunner laid himself down...
You're thinking I'm not capable of it, Major...
I'm not thinking anything.
We all do stupid things, isn't that right, Major?
Right.
...bread-bearing fields will sing him sinless dreams.
The sultry sun, not the fiery candle, beams down upon his motionless face."
Right. I get down into the clearing, and that's the end of him.
Excuse me, please.
The lighter is Austrian, but it works well.
Vasia! 
Lopatin!
Hello, Vasilii! 
– How are you!
- What you got there - gold? 
- Give that here.
Take the suitcase.
How's your mother?
Mother died a month ago. 
Heart disease.
You'll be sleeping in her bed.
The local climate didn't suit her.
Long journey?
The devil knows. 
About 7 days, I guess.
That's pretty fast.
Your wife came by today, her husband...  was transfered here.
As a theater director. 
- I know.
Here's a letter for you. 
And an address.
The address is separate. 
Don't lose it.
As you like.
Petia!
Petia, Petia!
Mother!
Ma, I'm alive...
- I'm looking for Rubtsova. 
- That's me.
- I'm Lopatin. 
- Nice to meet you.
The boys got the things together and sent me.
These were left over at the newspaper office.
Who's there? 
What do you want?
A camera, etc. There's food in the bag, cans, etc.
There's also money: 
4,550 rubles.
Edy, stop it, you hear me?
There's no place to sleep here. 
We're packed like sardines.
This is a friend of Pasha. 
He brought belongings.
Any sugar?
What the devil do you want! 
What do you need sugar for!
Calm your child. 
Listen to me.
Why did you come? 
What for?
Why don't you go?
What'd you come for?
Get out of here. 
Please leave.
Why do you stand there?
What'd you come for?
Please go, would you.
And take the cans with you!
Lord, how will I live?
Will you leave or not?
Please calm the child.
She cries when her mother cries.
Will you have some tea with us?
Sure, thanks.
Forgive me... forgive me...
Excuse me, how do I get to Beshegach?
Sorry... Not this way, turn right! Go straight!
So I should go back? 
Thanks.
- Is this No. 13? 
- Right.
- Hello. 
- Who are you looking for?
- Ksenia Segeevna. 
 - Come in, I'll get her.
- Do glasses bother you in battle? 
 - Sometimes.
- And what do you do? 
- Take them off.
- Pardon. Get to bed. 
- Mama...
Vadik, to bed now.
- Well, hello. 
- Hello.
I smudged you.
You lost weight. 
Not looking so good.
- Probably the haircut. 
- Right, that's it.
Don't worry, not mine.
I hate to say it, but I am awfully happy with him.
It happens.
- Vedeneev. 
- Lopatin.
Take off your coat.
- How was the journey? 
- Very good.
- This way.
Listen: I'm not a plaintiff, you're not defendants.
We'll sit, stand and drink... if you have any.
The locksmith won't come for less than half a loaf.
They have children too.
So, I killed him. 
You understand me?
As a soldier, you can...
I'm not a soldier, to be precise.
My duties sometimes take me into battle.
But it's not the same thing. 
- Nonsense.
You shot at Germans. 
You killed them.
Sure, once or twice at the beginning.
This year I fired a machine gun... once.
I doubt I killed anyone.
I wasn't the only one shooting, and they're far away.
I have bad eyesight.
My husband is a chief military medic.
He says it's safe. 
That's a lie, right?
Sometimes it is.
No, drinks only hardens me.
Hand me some rice, it softens me up.
Lida here plays a sniper. 
I'm the director.
We need to understand... 
Not so much... what it feels like to kill a man.
Is it delight, satisfaction, rapture?
Satisfaction? Sure.
Delight or rapture don't go well with war, really.
But the poet said, 
"The intoxication of battle..."
What do we make of that?
How should I know? 
Nobody knows.
The same that we make of any poetry.
- To your health! 
- Thank you.
I remember going to your plays when I was a kid.
- You mean Macbeth? 
- Not just Macbeth.
One moment. What about the will to die.
The will to die is good for suicide.
In war you need a will to do under the peril of death.
But the will to live remains.
- Do you want a splash of hot tea? - Sure.
- Lida, some tea? 
- No.
So, what are the right words?
You know all the wrong ones. 
- Lida!
I want to understand. 
What words?
I see you don't like prose. 
So hear this:
It's hard for me to reach you, but death is just 4 steps away.
Those are the right words. 
As I see it.
Don't be angry. 
Your eyes look angry.
She's foolish, and I'm old.
I know how people suffer and die.
How they learn of others' deaths.
But I don't know how they kill.
I have to know, see?
First we invite him over, then we make him work.
Some of our kids followed a unit, now they're enlightening everyone.
And Zinaida with her usual tactfulness...
Nonsense, I listen to them because it is the sound of war.
Go on, Vadik... 
That’s ours room.
I'm so glad your essays are being made into movies.
Me too. Do you need anything?
Nina doesn’t write me at all.
It’s understandable, kids like writing to the front.
She will understand in time.
- You have something to tell me? 
- Yes.
Your telegram about the divorce got delayed.
And we had to get the apartment...
You signed for me.
Yes, and there's nothing wrong with that.
But Evgenii thinks you should do it yourself.
He's right. 
Give me the paper.
Here.
It's all there.
Here are the keys to the Moscow apartment.
I don't need them. 
What date should I write?
- If you mind... 
- What date, Ksenia?
I don't care. The 11th.
Here.
Oh god...
It's your  own... your own fault!
It's all your fault!
- Get a hold of yourself. 
- I will not!
All you cared about was your writing.
People laughed at you... 
You hated my friends!
I was getting old!
I've lost my taste for such scenes...
I'm going.
I'm going too.
The gates are locked and you
 won't find the back way.
Say good-bye for me, ok?
- I'll come by tomorrow. 
- Ok.
Good-bye.
- Mister, what time is it? 
Ksenia showed me some photos of you, but I didn't recognize you on the train.
I think it's the haircut... 
- Why were you crying?
My father is dying. I was coming from the hospital.
He was wounded and paralyzed.
He's in one piece, but... it's hopeless.
I saw you standing there with all your patches and thought, why did he survive and my father...
Why is this man perfectly fine?
Happy, decorated, probably coming home to his family.
Turns out it's you and there's nothing waiting for you.
Pardon, what did you say?
I said, you're not totally happy either.
Why, things are perfectly fine for me.
Fine...
I think many women here may think so, looking at you.
That's my tram.
He's sending the certificate to you, so she can’t do anything...
I pictured you with dark hair and a mustache.
This is our set of the basement.
Was your Stalingrad woman beautiful?
Our consultant. 
- Pleasure to meet you.
I think she was.
That basement was more like a boiler room.
With pipes.
And no lamps.
And no cots.
We ate and slept on crates.
- I see. 
- Otherwise it looks similar.
Bring crates. 
Get rid of the cots.
No, no, I won't part with my crates.
I'm responsible for them.
Move the barrel. Vasilii, please take care of this.
I think I'll go.
I shouldn't have asked you to work on New Year's Eve.
Hello.
Hello.
I've been waiting for you.
Me? At your service.
Let me walk you back.
Sure. What for?
See, I'm working here as a seamstress...
I see...
Can I carry...?
It's just a dress... 
 and a half.
Why half?
It's not finished.
Did I say something wrong the other night?
This is the old part of town.
They thought of paving it before the war...
But the sewage system will happen anyway.
- Your boy is 5? 
- 6, is he small?
Want to know about the husband? 
Ran off before the war.
Only this belt left.
My father ran off too, probably hereditary.
- You have plenty of time. 
- I'm not bitter, just curious.
And you have plenty of time too?
Doubt it. My daughter's about to get married.
- So what? 
- Nothing.
Bastard.
What's that there?
Better now.
Can I ask you to wait around for a bit?
I just have to drop this off. 
- No problem.
Hold this... 
So you won't run off.
Be right back.
You're a slob, not a soldier, and I'll teach you a lesson.
Fix it.
Get that truck out of the way.
Ho, ho, ho, I come from far off lands...
- They didn't take it? 
- No this is a reward.
Now we're rich and almost free. Cold?
No, we're in the south here.
Bread... 
- Why almost?
I still have to drop off some money.
I borrowed for my trip. 
It's close by.
- Feet cold? 
- I have two pairs of socks.
Don't you wear foot wraps?
I figured you don't know how to wrap them.
- May I take your arm? 
- Of course.
Does fear make you want to smoke?
The two are not related.
I smoke when I want to... and have tobacco.
And I fear when it's frightening.
What was the scariest thing?
The scariest... at the start of the war...
Then at Kerch... 
Stalingrad too.
Hard to explain.
You feel it in the back of your neck.
Do people come to the shows?
Sure. Big lines too.
You can imagine domestic life here.
Theater is all bright lights, like there's no war.
Why in the back of your neck?
Everyone has his own geography of fear.
My everpresent fear is just back there.
A sudden fear is in the stomach.
Like I'm hugry.
What's so funny?
Just funny.
Hot here in this dump.
I don't mind.
The sun came out.
That's good.
They don't have normal 
New Year's parties here.
What did you do last year?
I slept through it.
Pay attention now.
You see the turn there?
Where the tracks make a cul-de-sac, that's my house there at that stop.
You have four more stops.
- That right? 
- Right.
There by that sign.
This is the only fence in town.
You're very funny in glasses.
How does one sleep through the New Year?
It was a crazy day.
Germans were bombing, a ship caught fire.
We had to put it out.
They didn't wake us till four. 
We had a drink of course.
Then we talked about Tashkent the rest of the night.
My friend had a wife here too.
Careful, fellas!
- It's nothing. 
- No?
This is where you're staying?
Maybe I can walk you home now?
Damn, broke my heel.
- Vasilii Nikitich... 
- NIkolaich.
- Sorry... I have a very important question for you...
You see an associate of my husband passed through here...
They were on an equestrian team before the war...
He said my husband went behind the enemy lines, and he sent me his watch for some reason...
Yes, his watch... 
- So what?
He knew it would be tough...
But he hasn't written for four months!
I'm beginning to think... 
- Don't think.
Just wait. 
- Really?
Four months is nothing.
These missions last a long time.
Yes, Vadik also thinks so...
I told her a thousand times, but she doesn't get it!
Horses don't need fuel... 
She's stupid!
I get it!
But the watch... doesn't he need it?
So what? I sent mine to my daughter too.
It happens all the time.
- Really? 
- Really.
I totally agree with you. 
I just had to hear it from you.
- Thank you very much. 
- My pleasure.
Good-bye. I brought her to you. You've seen it all.
So, can I walk you home?
No, thanks. I'm going straight to the theater.
- Happy New Year! 
- You too!
- Vadik, how can you talk to your mother like that!
That's you. 
See the resemblence?
- What time is it, Major? 
Back in Russia the sergeant brought dinner in a thermos, they're all chomping down concentrate, no need to pay!
I left for the front on the 2nd day.
Army paper - 
The Western Front.
When our train got shelled in Minsk
I crawled out from under pieces of torn bodies.
I vomited until I had nothing left in me.
Pardon me.
Kill the light.
I didn't say anything to anyone.
But the command office sent for me.
Vasilii Nikolaevich... it's for you.
From the command office.
- I'll be a minute. 
- Go on, go on.
I'll have a drink to victory in '43.
All my life I wrote about war.
Wore a uniform. 
Did god knows what.
- Permit me to speak. 
 - Go on.
Let's go over there.
- Thanks. A real favor. 
- Don't mention it.
So your leave fell through.
 -May I go? 
- Go on.
To hell with the leave.
I don't know anything about movies anyway.
I think it's going to start in the Caucases.
- Where to? 
 - Out for a walk.
I don't want to hear it. 
Off to bed.
...weather you cannot trust the sea.
And why not, my dear?
In a long-past life recall, o treacherous fiend, how I trusted in you.
This is the only wooden fence next to tram tracks in town, Major.
- I'll get out here. 
- Wait for you?
Don't bother.
I'd wait, but I'll get in trouble.
Vasilii Nikolaevich, what's your sense?
My sense is that it's fake.
Fake?
She didn't set the tank on fire.
She just didn't leave that basment.
And we all knew that we cannot leave either.
You think we can take your sketch word for word, and make a film?
Not word for word.
But your additions are unfortunate.
Burn a tank!
An anti-tank weapon is heavy, it's made for two people...
It's a movie.
We can't have a movie without a heroic act.
My aim is to make a film, and it is a noble aim.
But it's a lie.
Did the woman die? 
Why didn't you write that?
And everyone is dressed like it's a runway.
We didn't wear helmets 
24 hrs a day.
And nobody wears gas masks anymore.
But there are regulations, Major, or are they gone too?
Gas masks are still prescribed by regulations.
Comrade, were you at the front?
What difference does it make?
Here it makes all the difference.
I saw action back in
 the civil war.
Now I serve where the country needs me.
And I did ask to be transfered.
And when I get there I will serve from start to finish, not here and there, gathering materials for another sketch.
Any soldier posing for a photograph is clean and polished.
This is a movie.
Still, a consultant should have first-hand knowledge.
Pardon.
Comrades, the lights are on.
Get rid of the gas masks and helmets.
Are we gonna film today or not!
The shutter sticks sometimes!
Lord, what trouble...
Let's give it a go.
Get the tractor, right away!
It won't budge, Major!
Get ready!
Camera!
Action!
Why did you refuse to evacuate?
Is it so hard to understand? 
This is our house!
Our daddy is buried here. 
Where should we go?
If we're meant to die, we'll die all together.
When you chase the Germans out we won't need to leave.
Isn't that right?
That's right. But what if a bomb falls?
We're used to it, 
Comrade Major.
I can be useful too, 
I know how to fire a gun.
Comrade Major, 
Ivanova is correct.
She has fought in two battles and damaged an enemy vehicle.
I was walking alone when I saw these children.
I couldn't leave them behind.
So I took the kids along with me and walked all the way to Stalingrad.
Weren't you waiting for our troops?
I dreamed of seeing our boys.
That would be our victory.
I couldn't bear the German anymore.
It was getting frightening.
Did you believe our men would come?
Of course. 
The whole time.
When the planes flew by 
I always thought those planes are low, our boys must be near.
If the planes are low, our troops are near by.
When they're far, the planes get higher up.
Did you see them?
Of course.
- And? 
- First we were afraid.
Then we barricaded ourselves in that basement and sat there quietly.
No, when you saw our men, what was it like?
Then we were really happy. 
We laughed and hugged them.
Where'd you get that?
Dug up in the garden, basically stole it.
Fearlessly they charged the enemy, and a bloody battle was fought.
Suddenly the young soldier lay down his head - his heart had been pierced.
Better now?
He fell at the legs of his steed and closed his bright eyes.
Your product is very special.
It destroys all fascists.
To make our product for the front you work like you are at the front.
We know that first you fired up your machines and only then put a roof over your head.
We remember comrades who were ill but worked to the very end.
- Do you have any medals? 
-Yes.
Then please take off your coat.
Here you go.
We know all about your labor.
We woud have liked to write about your heroism to your fathers, brothers and sons at the front.
But in war we can only do one thing: send your product to the front and maybe they will know who made it.
These are our heroes! They beat the production schedule.
I would like to introduce 
Major Lopatin.
He was at Stalingrad!
Comrades!
Comrades...
Comrades, what are thinking about back in Stalingrad?
About you.
Who are they working for?
For you.
What are you thinking about?
Who are you laboring for here in Tashkent?
For them.
I have seen your production in Stalingrad.
It doesn't just kill fascists, it... these boys here, who work overtime, they had saved somebody's life over there.
Maybe their own fathers' lives.
Day and night your production batters the Germans at Stalingrad.
Batters them. Batters! 
And it will finish them off!
Be sure of that!
Thank you, comrades for your production.
Death to German occupiers!
Victory will be ours!
They thought it would be theirs.
But it will be ours.
The assembly is over. 
Back to work, comrades!
There's no time to waste!
I've had enough of this!
- Hello. 
- Hello.
Do you mind that 
I dropped by?
I'm off tomorrow... that's about it.
I thought you still had a few days left.
That was yesterday.
Lydia Nikolaevna, Romanova has a hole in her shoe.
She has to dance the walz in the second act...
Liuba, could you take over for me today?
- Nice boys. 
- Heroes!
They're off to the front tomorrow.
Mama, I dreamt of the crow again.
- It went away now. 
- Who's that?
Shh, go to sleep.
- Ma, could you take him? 
- I have an extra pillow.
Go to sleep. 
I love you.
There you are.
You don't have to do my laundry.
I just soaked it, then I thought it may not dry in time.
You wouldn't understand.
Raining again.
You know what I was thinking about the whole time?
Remember the woman who saw me off that time?
Sure. With a funny hat.
Zoika, my father's wife.
I hated her my whole life.
She got a cleaning job at a hospital and had my father moved there.
She's looking after him.
I asked her if we could help?
She cursed me out.
"I didn't share him when he was healthy..."
I got upset, started to cry.
Now I see I was a fool.
How could I be so blind.
Put your arms around me.
You have strong arms.
Shh, the floor is creaking.
You're crazy.
One second... one second.
I probably can't see you off.
You're taking the 
Ashkhabad train?
Right, about 1.
I wonder what the weather's like there...
Will you go back to Moscow after, or some other place?
I don't know. 
Wherever they send me.
Of course. 
It's very humid.
You'll get your feet wet, do you have spare socks?
It's nothing. 
I'll get some.
You could get sick.
I don't get sick.
Very rarely.
I had something very important to tell you.
Ok, let's say good-bye.
I'm coming, coming!
Ok, off you go.
Go on, go on.
I dreamt of mother last night, she was feeding us dumplings.
It bodes well for you.
I caught a bullet in the civil war and shrapnel in this one.
Men, the train is about to move.
End all farewells!
To your cars!
When you get to Moscow you'll see my letter.
I'll try to set you up with a publisher...
I'll try to...
Would you like some food, Major?
- From the 214th? 
- Yes, Major.
But you can't go farther by car.
They'll fire at you.
The car's going back.
Colonel Efimov asked me to take you to him.
We were here earlier, but now about a kilometer off.
- So you're alive? 
- Alive.
I was in a hospital for a spell.
- Take your bag? 
- It's ok.
I got a letter from a neighbor:
German burned up your house.
Otherwise all ok. 
So you're back with us?
- Permit me to speak. 
- Go ahead.
I'm assigned to 214th. 
Is this the right way?
The sergeant here knows the way.
- May I come along? 
- Sure.
I like your epaulets, lieutenant.
Address me properly.
- A new assignment? 
- Yessir, first day.
I'm still trying to catch up with my men.
It's pretty rowdy here.
So where are you coming from?
I'm here two days. 
In Tashkent before that.
I had a 20 day leave, but it was cut short.
Lucky, Taskent is nice these days.
If it's three shots and then quiet, then everything will turn out well.
For her too.
The lieutenant got hit.
Are you hurt?
Does it hurt?
I can't hear. 
Can't hear!
Get your hands down! 
Try to blow it through!
Clamp your nose and blow!
The water is earthy here. 
Drink, don't worry.
I thought that was it.
That's just the beginning.
That's not the end, lieutenant!
You'll live a hundred years...
Ok, let's get going.
Nobody will believe it's shrapnel.
They'll think I got a moth hole.
I couldn't believe it either.
I'll marry a widow after the war. God's truth I will.
I saw an American magazine,
I don't know how women agree to pose like that.
A widow with a house. 
I'll just join in.
If I get out alive.
So much for your 
20 days without war.
Now you have to face the truth.
Many things will happen to you and to others.
Though we're plodding forward we're only in Kuban, and Berlin is a long way off.
A long, long way.
THE END
- Whoa, baby.
- You caught nothing.
You're gonna have to move away.
We don't want no cheap-seaters around the table.
- If Kenny's movin', you've got to move.
- You follow him, Bobby.
Would you go if you had the chance again?
- Would I go? Yeah.
- You'd go to Canada?
- No, not to Canada.
- You'd go back to 'Nam?
- Yeah, because...
- You would?
- You're a fucking psycho!
- No.
- You'd go back?
- Yeah. I went over for a purpose, man.
- What was your purpose?
- A lot of it was curiosity.
- But another thing was...
- You can't be curious, man.
I said that was just part of the reason.
The other was a moral obligation.
I feel that anybody... Not for their country or anything like that. For anybody.
Nobody's got the right to tell anybody what to do against their will.
That's what I went over to fight for.
Did you know that they ran the French out of there after 20 years?
Wait a minute. You said they're forcing...?
Shit! You call the draft not being forced?
I ain't sayin' the draft in our country.
I'm talking about another country that's having something forced upon them.
- Is it our duty to fight for somebody else?
- If you believe in it! If you believe in it.
I can't see anybody saying that, after coming back, they would go again.
I just can't deal with that.
Wait a minute. The reason I can see it is that some of us, not all of us, some of us need to justify to ourselves what the fuck we did there.
If we come back and say what we did was a waste, some of us can't live with it.
- So they'd do it again?
- Man, they gotta keep...
Inside they're lying to themselves continuously saying
"What I did was OK because this is what I got from it, man."
"I have to justify being paralysed, I have to justify killing people, so I say it was OK."
But how many guys can make the reality and say
"What I did was wrong and all this other shit was wrong, man" and be able to live with themselves cos they're crippled for the rest of their life?
You don't know what's going on
You been away for far too long
You can't come back
and think you are still mine
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
Well, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
You are all left out
Out of there without a doubt
Cos baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
A girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day
It's no good you thinking
that you are still mine
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor unfaithful baby
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
Well, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
Yes, you're all left out
Out of there without a doubt
Cos baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You thought you were a clever girl
Giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back
and be the first in line
Oh, no
You're obsolete, my baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
Well, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
Yes, you're all left out
Out of there without a doubt
Cos baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time...
Re-box all weapons.
Place your weapons on the firing line
with the dust covers up.
Grease up the brass...
Word is it's turning into a hell of a war over there, Captain.
We're going there, pal.
When we're in 'Nam, we're in Combat City.
I am ready. Really ready.
I'll pop some rounds with you. Marine!
- How's Vi taken to your leaving?
- I think she hates everything military.
But she stands behind me.
She knows I want it more than anything.
- How about Sally?
- She's OK.
I don't think she really understands it all, but she accepts it.
You can't ask for a helluva lot more than that.
An American spokesman reported
rockets, artillery and mortar fire...
- Jeez!
- Remember Jim Hanson?
He got blown away in the middle of the street right in Saigon.
That's an embarrassment.
Makes us look like the goddamn B Team.
Word is from on top that Charlie shot his wad with this Tet Offensive and it's just a matter of a mop-up time.
I've waited a long time for an opportunity like this.
You're gonna make major.
- Major?
- Major.
Major and Mrs Robert Hyde? I'll have to get my skirts lengthened for that one.
Start wearing girdles.
- You'll have to watch your language.
- Right. Very reserved.
I'm actually excited.
I never thought it would get like this.
I have competitive nervousness.
I feel like I'm off to the Olympic Games.
Bob is very sexy.
In 13 months I'll throw you the damnedest party.
We'll have a side of beef, a case of Jack Daniels, and maybe I'll even get you a couple of congressmen.
Fantastic.
- I'll bring you back a souvenir.
- Like what?
A Commie AK-47.
- Robert? Sorry to interrupt.
- Mrs Vickery.
I wanted to pass on the Colonel's best wishes.
- Isn't he able to come by later?
- No. Tonight's his chess night.
- Sally, be sure to keep in touch.
- I will, Mrs Vickery.
- She'll be staying with my mom.
- Oh, nice.
Earl, your Kathy's doing a wonderful job on the paper.
- Don't let it go to your head, young lady.
- I've got a lot of good ideas.
Call me tomorrow.
- May God be with you, Robert.
- Thank you, Mrs Vickery.
That was very nice.
A time of innocence
A time of confidences
Long ago it must be
I have a photograph
Preserve your memories...
Now hear this!
It is exactly zero hour minus six.
Your orders for the day are:
Go directly to the bedroom.
Do not pass "Go".
Do not collect dinner.
- Aren't you hungry?
- Well...
Does a bear make big potty in the woods?
From the Halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli...
I will fight... my country's battles... on land, in the air...
Bob?
What are you doing?
This darn thing wouldn't pop up.
You never know when you're gonna want some toast.
I gotta start getting ready.
You don't need to be afraid for me, you know.
I am afraid.
But I'm proud of you.
There was nothing I could do here in California.
I know.
That's where I belong. And I am a Marine.
I gotta go. Pay the bar bill.
And let's get the generator in this thing fixed.
And call my mom and let her know when you're coming.
- I bought you a present, sweetheart.
- I don't have anything for you.
Oh, Sally. It's a little wedding ring.
Look how outstanding that is. Huh?
I like it.
- You'll probably take it off on liberty.
- No way.
I'll never take this off. That's a promise.
- This'll be my good-luck charm.
- That's right.
Sir? We're ready to move out.
Can I stow your gear?
- We're at war.
- Yo!
Let's go.
When I get back, we're gonna get us a little condominium right on the beach.
Tell brother Billy to take care.
- And a garage filled up with Porsches.
- Be a good girl. No fooling around.
- Just come back.
- You got it.
Oh. This is Dink. My wife Sally.
Hello, Mrs Hyde. Vi, Captain Hyde's wife.
Hi, Vi.
Be careful.
- You have a spot on your tie.
- What?
Don't wear your skirts so short.
See you around.
- Hey, Vi?
- Yeah?
Do you want a drink?
Can I buy you a drink or something?
Where's open? No place is open.
- Just the Officers Club.
- Any place but there.
Yeah, I guess.
Well... that's that.
Hey. I live just a couple of miles down.
Wanna come over?
- Yeah.
- Stay close.
- Park in there. It's empty.
- OK.
Don't mind the mess. Come on up.
Don't turn it off.
OK?
Yeah. Sorry. Just tonight especially,
I felt superstitious.
Whatever gets you through the night.
- I guess it's the way I was brought up.
- Me too. Is beer OK? It's all I got.
Oh, sure.
You gonna stay on in officers' quarters?
Are you kidding?
I couldn't even if I wanted to.
- That's spooky.
- Bob moves off and I've gotta move.
You're the hole in the doughnut, and when the doughnut goes, there's no hole.
They say if the Marine Corps wanted you to have a wife they'd have issued you one.
- Is that you?
- Me and my kid brother.
He's cute.
He inherited the brains, the beauty, the personality, the talent.
Then he got drafted.
He's the main reason I hang out here.
- Not Dink?
- Dink the kink?
He's part of it. But the kid's in the VA hospital - psycho ward.
They sent him home without an ignition.
So I'm stuck with him.
God. It must be really hard on you.
I see him every day.
I work in the hospital, in the kitchen.
Is he gonna get better?
Who knows? They don't.
I don't.
- Hey, Pee Wee.
- How are you doing, Mr Martin?
I'm just fine, Pee Wee. Just terrific.
I only stink a little bit.
- Smells like booze to me.
- I need a bath, man.
I just have two hands and too many assholes to clean.
That's what you're being paid for.
Mr Martin, you get more from Uncle for your disability than me and my old lady get put together.
Maybe they shouldn't put you together, then.
- Your radiator's blowing over.
- So's yours, Eddie.
I'm serious, man. You better watch it before you pop your melon.
Oh, shit. I'm filled up. Where's Corinne?
You better watch that booze.
Mess up your kidneys.
Watch where you're...! Goddamnit! Shit!
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!
Would you please give me my canes?
I'm sorry.
Goddamnit!
Nurses, interns and orderlies!
Fucking nurses and fucking doctors!
They treat us like nobodies in this fucking hospital!
- Goddamn it! Where are you people?
- Give it hell, Luke.
Corinne, you're fucking late!
There's something on the floor for you!
You stay where you are, Digroot!
You come near me, I'll break your fucking head! You understand?
Where the fuck were you? You're so goddamned slow. Can't you move?
Come near me! I wanna hit you! I wanna hit something that can't fucking move!
What am I saying?
What am I doing?
- Having a little problem today, Luke?
- Oh, shit!
Doctor, I can't even get my piss bag changed!
- You want me out of this hospital?
- Give him 50 of Thorazine.
Take care of me and I'll get the fuck out of here! Just take care of me!
Fucking hospital! Aw, shit!
Put me on a train
I've got no expectations...
- Are you Fleta Wilson?
- Yes.
I think I'd like to volunteer. I mean,
I don't think, I do want to volunteer.
Damn.
Sit down, please.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Hot stuff.
- Do you have him, Jerry?
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But you'll get used to it.
One guy had "Born to lose" tattooed on his arm.
"La vida loca" - the crazy life.
That's my favourite one.
I talked to this other guy that had a gold earring.
Yeah? You're not used to those hippy types, huh?
Bob would flip out if he ever saw those characters.
That about does it, huh?
I feel like I've lived in base houses all my life.
Should've had the government move us.
- They do that for officers, you know?
- Yeah?
I didn't realise that we'd accumulated so much stuff.
Well, don't worry. My rates are cheap.
You know, I think I must have moved at least 15 times since I left home.
I went back there once when my old lady died.
Nothing's left. They tore down my past and built a shopping centre.
- Want to see something funny?
- I'd love to.
My yearbook.
- Ooh! Look at that dress.
- It was a nice dress.
- It's cute.
- There's another one here.
So funny looking at the way we used to look.
- Doggy in the window?
- Look.
"Sally Bender. Nickname: Sal."
"What is the one thing she'd want on a desert island?"
"A husband."
- I was so ambitious.
- And so original.
You know that guy we were talking about?
He's in here somewhere.
- Yeah?
- Look.
"Luke Martin. Nickname: The Duke."
- He's cute.
- "Co-captain of the football team."
"What one thing would he want on a desert island? A mirror."
- This is asinine, Pee Wee.
- There you go. Take some.
Don't you get the feeling that this is kinda silly shit?
Shit, I'm not saying this isn't entertaining, Pee Wee.
I'm not eating, Pee Wee. I'm not eating.
I'm not eating, Pee Wee. Come on, man.
Give me my arms. I can feed myself.
This is bullshit. I'm not a child, man.
Drink the milk.
- Hi there.
- Hello.
Juice and coffee!
Want some juice?
Excuse me. Do you want some juice or coffee?
- Juice or coffee?
- Look at that round-eyed chick!
Come on, baby, light my fire.
- Wanna boom-boom? Short time?
- Like some juice?
I'm hard all over.
I'm a bargain in this ward.
Hey, man, be cool. I told you.
Get yourself together.
- Do you want some juice?
- Tits... ass... You got it all, Mama-san.
- You got it all.
- Hey, you shut up.
Yes, sir. Right away. You hear that?
You're disturbing these young 'uns.
Can I kiss you? Can I sniff? Oh, man.
Luke?
Can I come in?
How are you doing?
- Do you remember me?
- No.
I was at Lincoln High when you were there.
Sally Hyde. Well, I was Sally Bender when... when I was there.
So?
I just started volunteering today here.
Terrific. If I could get my hands loose,
I'd salute you.
You're a mess.
- Sally Bender.
- Right.
- You were a cheerleader.
- That's right. Three years.
- Were you wounded in 'Nam?
- Right.
When did it happen?
A long time ago.
- My husband just went over there.
- Poor bastard.
Sally?
Didn't we used to call you Bender Over?
- What? Who said that?
- Bender Over. Everybody said it.
- They did not!
- Yes, they did, Sally.
Oh, come on. They did not.
What are you talking about?
Oh, shit.
Sally, listen.
Can I ask you for a big favour?
Sure.
How about unhitching me from these things?
- No, I can't do that, Luke.
- Sure you can. It's easy.
No, I'm sorry. The doctor has to do that. I...
Come on. Please? Please, Sally Bender.
- Come on.
- What are you doing in here?
- I just was seeing...
- We'll tend to Mr Martin, Sally.
- You're needed on the ward.
- OK.
Hey, Bender.
You almost got yourself a gold star.
Pee Wee, I can crawl again.
Morning.
I'm gonna be feeding you this morning.
I'm a new volunteer here.
Huh?
He ain't transistorised, honey.
You gotta plug him in for sound.
Plug you in? Oh.
Is this... is this gonna hurt?
There. Is that OK?
- Thank you.
- OK. Would you like some food?
Hey, there you go. Oh, my.
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.
You want me to...? Here.
Here. Here you go.
It's all energy. You understand?
You don't understand.
You give out energy, you get energy back.
You see me smiling?
Can you dig them pearly whites?
I smile my ass off now.
Hell, sometimes I think
I'm the Good Humor Man.
Everyone wants a piece of my action.
They think I'm one of the Beach Boys.
- Hey, Sally. This is my brother, Bill.
- Hi, Bill.
You see that? Me and her just had a whole conversation in smile contact.
- Vi, do you have a jumper cable?
- Sure. Bridges!
Watch. You watching?
You two just did it. You smiled
"See what I have to put up with?"
And she smiled back "He's harmless."
- Are you on uppers?
- I don't know.
Come on, Bill.
How about a game of chess?
My brother - a miracle of modern medicine.
Hey, wait. Oh, my God, what a day.
Is he usually like that?
Try it!
Is it charging?
No.
I like this one.
This is beautiful. It's a convertible.
I don't know how you'd keep warm.
Oh, it's got a great sound system.
Hello.
- Why is this one so much less expensive?
- It's two years older.
"I'm so tired when I come home at night,
I just fall right asleep."
"I know you didn't want me to get a job..." Thanks.
"...but this isn't really a job, since
I don't get paid. I hope you don't mind."
Then there's sort of a sexy ending.
"Love, Sally."
- That's nice.
- Thanks.
But you didn't tell him the house you rented was on the beach.
I know.
And you didn't tell him about the new car you bought.
I figure I'm gonna save that for when he gets home.
- I got one from Dink this morning.
- Oh, yeah?
All he said was "Got you another ear."
Poetic, huh?
A captain? Shit, Bender. You didn't go out and marry a fucking captain?
That's right. Why? What were you?
A sergeant.
Sergeants have a lot of responsibility, don't they?
Yes. They sent me my stripes on the hospital ship.
My reward for getting so fucked up!
Why are you so cynical about that, Luke?
What are you doing here, Bender?
Why aren't you on a golf course?
Doing something you're good at.
I'm just trying to keep busy.
Sure. Something to talk about over martinis.
How you're helping out the poor cripples.
I don't think that
I deserve that, Luke - at all.
Maybe you're getting ready for your husband to come back in a body bag.
Read someplace else!
Luke?
Luke.
Stop! Stop and listen to me!
What is the matter with you?
Why do you have to be such a bastard?
Kevin. I thought you died Wednesday, man.
You can get paralysed in a war that don't even make sense and come back and they don't have the decency to ask you how you're doing.
"Can I do anything for you?"
I got a Purple Heart. I got it from a second lieutenant that wasn't even in the war.
They don't tell you about how to manage your finances.
Or going back into society. Half the people still can't go back into society.
What about your sex life?
They don't tell you about that.
I went out the first time and didn't know what to do.
What happens if my gizmo busts? What happens if I have a bowel movement?
I get there and I don't know how to react.
There's not enough beds, not enough staff.
It's really crowded.
The guys have to wait in line.
They're not prepared for the number of wounded being sent back.
I don't think we're clear on what you're asking us for, Sally.
It's what I said. We could do an article in the paper, using these photographs, interviewing some of the guys, maybe.
Isn't it difficult for the men to be around women?
When I joined Weight Watchers
I didn't want candy in the house.
I don't think that's our function, Sally.
We're more a base gossip sheet.
Fun and games for the fellas.
I agree with you, Connie.
I'm sorry, Sally. I hope you understand.
What's next in the agenda?
We have the Little League play-offs and the officer-son baseball game.
That's the 25th and the 27th, isn't it?
I just... I want to say that I'm really shocked that you'd rather write about a goddamn home run than this hospital.
- Sally, please.
- What if they were your husbands?
That sure is a mindblower!
That's the way it was done 150 years ago.
- Things have improved.
- They certainly have.
Picture a young man 150 years ago
in the beautiful hills of Kentucky.
There's a girl he's crazy about.
She's lovely, vivacious...
What's shaking, man?
One of them days, man.
Flashback to when I got fucked up.
Wow!
Get out of the way!
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows
That baby's got new clothes...
He dedicated himself to justice and
love between his fellow human beings.
He gave his life for that principle
and I think it's up to those of us
who are here...
It was a choice between dealing with that or dealing with this football game and they just said it's not our function.
Maybe I'm naive.
Naive? She wants to know if she's naive!
- Oh, man. That's cold.
- I'm a cold man.
It's like you've done your duty, served your purpose, so they just toss you into the heap like a used Kleenex.
That's the way it is. That's it.
What is our function if it isn't to deal with the problems you guys face every day?
God! The smugness just...
I can't believe it.
- Give 'em hell, Bender.
- Sorry.
It's not gonna do any good, but I'm rooting for you.
Well, thanks a lot, Luke.
Seriously, if they put something in the paper...
You're beautiful when you're excited.
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on
that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your worid
Ah, you fake just like a woman...
God only knows what he saw over there... or did.
I don't understand it.
He was only in 'Nam for two weeks.
I worry a lot about Dink too.
He's so funny, you know?
So uncomplicated.
He's more than just a roll in the sack.
I just hope he doesn't get totalled.
Whoo!
I got it.
- Bender!
- You got a chair!
- You changed your hair!
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's very nice.
- You're mobile.
- I'll help you. Go ahead.
- Thanks, Luke.
- Hi, Rick.
- Hey, Luke. How you doing?
Congratulations.
Would you like to come over for dinner?
Wouldn't you like to get out of here one night?
I'm a good cook.
OK?
("Jumping Jack Flash"
by the Rolling Stones}
Watch it
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma
in the driving rain...
I hit him after the whistle, man!
It was wrong! He grabbed my chair!
Didn't you grab my chair?
Can't you morons kick a field goal?
Come on! Field goal!
B- u-s-t! Bust 'em!
And around about July 1st, my pa's mind would start wandering.
He wouldn't give a damn about the cattle, and that got us kids pretty excited.
At the park they'd have flags flying and games of chance, kissing booths and wrestling matches.
But let me tell you, that day was always too long for me.
When it got dark, the band would play "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the fireworks would start up, and I'd start thinking how brave those men were that fought in the Revolution.
I'd dream about those men, how they went to war for our freedom.
I guess that's when I decided to be a soldier, seeing the sky lit up with those rockets.
I enlisted when I became of age.
I served in Europe and Worid War Two and was involved in the liberation of dozens of towns.
As I passed through them, as I saw the faces of the people,
I realised I had fulfilled my dream.
I had become one of those men who had gone to war for freedom.
I sure wound up doing what I wanted to do, and that's what July 4th means to me.
- I bet you can't do that.
- I can't do that. Can you do this?
- No.
- Go on, try it.
I can't do it.
Hey, Billy the Kid. Let's show these guys what real talent is. Come on.
Give me your arm. You know, the duet we worked up last night.
- Billy, you gonna play that thing?
- Come on, Billy. Play your guitar.
Come on. I love when you play the guitar.
What is tomorrow? What is it we need?
What will it give us?
A new life we can lead
Will the wind crack the limbs of a few dying trees?
Will the branches unite and bend in the breeze?
Tomorrow is hope for it is something I've not seen
Tomorrow is a sunny day... live in a sunny dream...
Come on, Billy. That sounded great.
Shit.
I can't play my fucking guitar.
God!
It's all right, man.
It's gonna be all right.
I think it really helped him having you there. I really do.
Luke, are you OK?
- Yeah.
- Should we do the dinner another night?
No. No.
I think you were really wonderful with him. I really do.
Oh, boy.
Just come down here and hold the chair for me.
Thanks.
You could pick my ankles up.
Thank you. That's good. Thank you.
It's warm because I've had the oven on.
I've got one of those timing devices that cooks your food while you're at work.
Whoo.
Let me just move you around a bit.
- You like margaritas?
- Yeah.
Well...
I just happen to have some.
Let me just...
Do you get a chance to go out very much?
- Do you go to people's homes?
- No, I don't.
Let's go in the living room.
I think you can make it. OK?
Let's see. Um...
Wait a minute. What am I doing?
- What?
- What am I lighting a fire for?
It's the old Girl Scout instinct.
Let's see. I've got a dip...
Sit down, Bender.
Sit down.
- Are you nervous?
Yes.
Why are you nervous?
This isn't "Have a Gimp Over for Dinner" Night, is it?
You're not one of those weirdos?
No, I'm not, Luke.
I know you're not.
I'm just very happy to be here.
I'm glad you're here.
How about some music?
Well...
I don't think you're gonna like my records very much.
You probably won't like the way I dance either.
Well...
Do you know that when I dream,
I'm not in the chair?
I don't even have a chair in my dream.
I have legs.
When I was a kid, I used to jump in my mother's kitchen and touch the ceiling.
She used to get pissed off cos
I'd leave my handprints on the ceiling.
I still check the snow reports, the conditions at Mammoth.
I'm still the same person, you know.
It's funny.
When people look at me, they see... something else, but they don't see who I am.
I think people have a real hard time seeing who other people really are.
People don't see me like I really am.
People look at me, I think, and they see
"Oh, cheery Sally, the captain's wife."
Sometimes I feel like
I'm becoming what people see.
You know, I spend 95/ of my time at the hospital thinking about making love with you.
I've never been unfaithful to my husband.
Do those who hear
think he's doing wrong?
While the church bell
tolls its one-note song
And the school bell
is tinkling to the throng
Come here where your ears cannot hear
And close your eyes, child...
- Don't wake him up.
- Hey. Doc?
Wake up.
We sail with the morning tide.
- Hey, Doc. Why don't you go to bed?
- Hi, Sally.
- Hi, Doc.
- You think you can make it, Doc?
Sure.
Smooth sailing, Doc.
Hey... You want a ride?
- Huh?
- You want a ride?
- You sure I'm not heavy?
- I wouldn't know.
Shh!
- What are you doing?
- I don't know where to put my hands.
Put them in your pockets.
- Seems strange to be here at night.
- Not for me.
With eager tongues we taste our strife
And fill our lungs with seas of life...
Thank you for the... for the ride.
Thank you for the dinner.
And close your lips, child
So softly I might kiss you
Let your flower perfume out
and let the winds caress you
As I walk on through the garden
I am hoping I don't miss you
If all the things you taste
ain't what they seem
Then don't mind me...
Good night.
Good night.
Then close your eyes, child
And look at what I'll show you
Let your mind go reeling out
and let the breezes blow you
Then maybe when we meet
Suddenly I will know you
If all the things you see
ain't what they seem...
This just came.
Do you want me to stay?
I'll be in my office.
Vi?
- Vi?
- Here!
Orders from the front.
We ate 200 gallons of chicken noodle soup last week.
How do you feel about going to Hong Kong for a week?
- Are you kidding?
- Bob and Dink just got their R and R.
Oh, my God! Hong Kong?
Will you check the plane schedules?
I gotta get my hair done, go to the bank.
I think it's already tomorrow there.
- A week?
- Well, five days.
Well, I can't go.
What am I supposed to do? Walk out on my job? Walk out on my brother?
I just can't, Sally.
Yeah. I'm gonna miss you. So is Dink.
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Yeah.
- Give him a kiss from me.
- Right.
On the cheek!
Great shot. Great shot. My best pass.
Oh! Great shot.
Good play. You're out, you're out.
Fucking in over your head!
- Hey, Bender!
- No way. No way.
Oh, that's my best shot!
Good news.
I'm getting released on Thursday.
- I'm getting out!
- That's great.
- How you doing?
- Are you gonna stay with someone?
I've got my own place.
I'm gonna have wheels. I'll be in touch.
I owe you dinner.
I'm not going to be around for a while.
I just heard from Bob.
He's getting his R and R.
I'm gonna be meeting him in Hong Kong.
- Well, have a nice trip.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.
The iceman returns. Shoot it up.
Luke!
- Whoa. Look at that. Great shot.
- Come on. Put it in the hole.
Over here. Over here.
There you go. Over this way.
Let's go. Move it up. Put it down, man.
Down, down.
How you doing, Sally?
Hey, Vi. Where is she?
Why did you have to go to work in the hospital?
- Because I wanted to.
- But it's the pits!
You didn't have to do that.
I just don't want you to work.
I love my mama and my papa too
I love my mama...
I just don't understand it.
Five days. That's all I wanted.
Is that too much to expect from somebody you've been with for two years?
Like... women and dogs, you've got to have a licence to show you're the owner.
Yeah. Thanks very much for all the advice.
I really appreciate it.
Tell the head honcho
I'm going to the place across the street.
- I'll see him later.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, no. Thanks for everything. Excuse me.
If you see Vi, thank her for me too.
Make sure of that, huh?
What the fuck is the matter with him?
Where's he going?
He's upset because Vi didn't come.
And because I suggested he didn't have the right to order her over here.
- We gotta go get him.
- No, let's just be alone for a few minutes.
We are alone.
- There's something wrong.
- It's not you. It's just... fucked up.
All this bullshit about 'Nam.
It's in my head.
Talk to me about it.
I want to know what it's like.
I don't know what it's like.
I only know what it is.
The TV shows what it's like.
It sure as hell don't show what it is.
I gotta find him.
Does she love me, Raul?
- She loves me, man.
- I wouldn't let you down.
- Those new heads'll work real good.
- I appreciate it. Have a good day.
- Take her easy.
- All right, man.
- How are my plants?
- They're fine. Nah, they died.
- They died?
- Yeah. Sorry.
What?
- They died.
- Hey, man, I only got two plants.
- What about that Kennedy assassination?
- What do you think about it?
Hey, Sally, listen. I've made up my mind.
You can tell the kid
I'll marry her if you want to.
You tell her!
Give me a break. I'm serious about this.
I've put it down all in writing and
I wanted you to kinda talk to her about it.
- OK. OK, of course. I'd be glad to.
- OK!
Would you have married me if I wasn't a Marine?
- In a second.
- What did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you the uniform always used to mean something?
The entire structure of the Marine Corps is changing.
It used to really mean something to be a Marine.
We're no longer the elite.
We're not even equal.
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
Excuse me.
Still I'm gonna miss you
There's no time to lose,
I heard her say
Thank you.
Catch your dreams
before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
and you will lose your mind...
Big hook.
Hey, mister, can you walk?
No, I can't walk.
That's why I'm in this chair.
- What happened to you?
- Yeah. What happened?
I got in an accident. I had a bad accident.
I got a piece of metal in my back, and after that I couldn't walk.
- Mary, I'm gonna go around.
- I don't believe you.
- What's the matter with kids today?
- We don't believe you.
- What's the matter with you characters?
- I want a ride! I want a ride!
OK. Come on. I'll give you a ride.
Here we go. Oops!
Are you gonna help me out here?
Pull that back. That's it. That's good.
It's all right, we got it. I'll show you a way out if you don't want to pay.
First week in combat... Huh!
We took this little hamlet.
I got this second lieutenant - this fucking Camp Lejeune whizz kid.
He comes whipping right up to me.
"Excuse me, sir. Sorry to bother you."
"Do you think it'd be OK if we put the heads on the poles?"
"That really scares the shit out of the VC."
My men... were chopping heads off.
That's what they were into.
Oh, they were dead.
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stolen many a man's soul and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ...
Do you like Tiger balm?
Makes you feel real cool.
Let me put some on your back.
Is that the way you massage the basket cases at the hospital?
I stuck around St Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
and the bodies stank...
It's open.
Hi.
- Where's Adrienne?
- Couldn't make it.
She asked me to take her place.
I was kind of counting on Adrienne.
I've been around this part of the pool before.
- With a gimp?
- Yeah. A guy in Reno.
- Do you want a drink?
- I'd love a drink.
Well, there aren't many days
And not enough time
Bedlam is silent
And the stillness is fury
Luke?
Put him on the phone. I'll talk to him.
- Luke?
- Yeah.
Hey, Luke. Hey, man, listen to this.
When I opened my eyes
A few were gone
- If I have to go, is this gonna be OK?
- Sure.
I've got too many days to do it and not enough time
Fucking shit.
- Can I use your phone to call my service?
- Sure. Do what you want.
Just close the door when you leave, OK?
It's not your fault. You're a pretty lady.
Fuck off, man!
Hey, Munson. Open the door, man.
- Open up!
- Unlock the door, Munson. Let's go.
- Hey, Munson.
- Come on, man.
Come on, open up the door, man.
Come on.
What the fuck is going on here?
- He went out, man.
- The man went out.
Son of a bitch. The man went out.
Make a hole. Make a hole.
Did he do himself in?
What's happening, man?
Some kid just bought it by shooting air into his veins.
Out of here! Out of here! Out! It's all right.
- Did you see something there?
- Get away. I wanna find out.
Aw, shit. He's dead, man.
Vi!
Vi!
He didn't even fucking call me.
Little bastard just wasted his life.
Well, it's a big fucking relief.
Man, this nurse calls me and says he's dead.
I don't even know her.
I just gotta get out of here. Let's go out.
- Just wait a second. I gotta take a shower.
- Yeah. Me too.
Have some wine or something.
I'll be right back, OK?
- Don't go away.
- I won't.
Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way
Yeah, darlin', gonna make it happen
Take the worid in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under...
- What do you think I should do, Sally?
- Huh?
I think I'm gonna say yes.
To Dink?
Hey, congratulations, Mrs Mobley!
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild...
- Here you go, ladies.
- Did you order some more?
- We didn't order more champagne.
- Those gentlemen over there did.
- You're not calling them over?
- They want us to come over.
I'll take care of this. You get your stuff.
- Hey!
- We're the boys from number nine.
I know what I want
But I just don't know
how to go about getting it
Feeling, sweet feeling
Drops from my fingers, fingers
Manic depressi贸n is catching my soul
Yeah
Woman so weary,
the sweet cause in vain...
Manic depressi贸n is a frustrating mess
Well, I think I'll go turn myself off
and go on down...
What in the fuck are you doing?!
- Oh, shit.
- I'm so happy!
Oops.
- Are we here?
- This is your honeymoon cottage.
Ta-da!
Hey, Sal. Take off your coat.
You're such a good horse.
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- You're on a military base.
- Who do you think you are?
- What's this all about?
This guy seems to be tied up to the fence.
Mister, I don't know what your beef is, and I don't care, but I want you to get this chain off the fence now.
Pay attention, motherfucker!
- We need some entertainment.
- The lady wants some music.
We need some entertainment.
Sally, come on!
Yes. Got it!
Appropriate music.
Very entertaining.
You guys ever been to a go-go club?
- Tonight.
- No. That was not a go-go club.
- What does a real go-go look like?
- I'm gonna show you.
Show us!
It's high up here.
My!
My! Whoo!
She's very good. What does she do?
She's a nutritionist at the VA hospital.
Ooh.
I think I see some flesh.
Take it easy now. Bruce is here.
Easy does it, Vi. Easy.
Take it easy.
You don't have to do that.
Billy!
My brother. My brother!
What happened? What's wrong?
I think she freaked out.
Maybe we should have turned on the TV.
He identified himself as Luke Martin.
He said he was a sergeant
in the Marines in Vietnam.
He was arrested after
he chained himself to the west gate.
He said he wants to stop any others
from going to Vietnam.
The reason I'm here is because
a buddy of mine who'd been in 'Nam
took his own life today.
- This is kind of a funeral service.
- It's Luke!
I'm here because I'm trying
to tell people, man,
if we want to commit suicide, we have
plenty of reasons to do it at home.
We don't have to go to Vietnam
to find reasons to kill ourselves.
- I just don't think we should be there.
- Do you think this is a way to stop it?
I don't know, man.
The police had difficulty
getting Sgt Martin into the police car
because he also was chained
to his wheelchair.
Let me take you home.
I'm not a very nice person.
You are to me.
I wanna spend the night with you.
- Where's your car?
- Right here.
Yeah, they're out of the car.
- Goddamn thing's got a curtain.
- Coming round the side.
Up to the walk.
Is she pushing him or is he going under his own power?
She's pushing.
Make yourself comfortable.
I have some things to do in the bathroom.
- I should be just a few minutes.
- OK.
Will you pull that sheepskin toward the centre?
Pillow. Pillow up against the back.
Like that?
Turn the light on. I want to see you.
What do I do?
Everything. I want you to do everything.
Where can I touch you?
Where can you... Where can you feel?
That's nice. I'm real sensitive, all the areas that I feel.
I'm real sensitive there.
- Can you feel that at all?
- I can't feel it, but I can see it.
- I wish you could feel me.
- I feel you.
I want you.
Oh! Softly.
Oh!
You're so beautiful.
Oh... oh... oh...
Hey.
Hey. Shh.
That's never happened to me before.
- How much am I paying you?
We gonna paint this?
We'll paint it to look like steps so no one knows I'm here.
Are you ready?
- OK!
- Yay!
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me...
Well, this, strangely enough, is our barber.
For 25 cents you get a massage, your hair cut and your ears popped.
Impressive, huh?
The water buffalo didn't like us either.
There's a tunnel. Look.
They'd been working on them since Worid
War Two when they fought the Japanese.
Then they fought the French and built more tunnels and now they got...
That's a buddy of mine. Willy.
He... he didn't make it.
Pretty people, huh?
- That's my smile.
That is, you can't, you know, tune in
but it's all right
That is, I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields...
- Oh, my God.
- I got a letter from Kathy.
Something about the newspaper.
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
That letter was from Bob.
- How is he?
- I don't know. I didn't...
I didn't get a chance to read it.
I guess he's OK.
Well, whatever he says... it's a hundred times worse than what he can tell you.
I'm so perverse.
I'm just jealous because I know when it's over, he's gonna come back to you.
We never manage to talk about Bob, do we?
No, we don't.
I don't know what's gonna happen... with Bob and me, Luke.
It's very scary for me... to think that maybe it's not gonna work out with him.
I know.
Because we've been together for so long.
It's gonna be very hard for him, and he's not gonna like the fact that I've... I've changed.
And I have changed.
You know that I've never been on my own before?
Well, baby, when times are bad
Call on me, darling,
and I'll come to you...
- You like that, Sid?
- She's got a nice ass for a white girl.
Should have heard some of the tapes we made at their pad.
- Did they get it on?
- I'll give 'em credit for that.
- Got a good angle?
- Yeah.
A man and a woman
have each other, baby
To find their way in this worid
I need you, darling,
like the fish needs the sea...
Cos everybody's different.
Don't you think so?
- Oh!
- Hey. It's cool. It's all right.
Have a nice time.
Two, please.
If Dink saw you, he'd probably think you were a hippie faggot.
- Here's to Dink, Vi.
- A toast to the host.
Not here... for a beer.
If that motherfucker sends me an ear...
Are you listening?
Are you listening? I just made a poem and you're not even listening.
A man and woman
have each other, baby
To find their way in this worid...
Bye, guys. See you tomorrow. Bye, Rita.
Hi.
It's from Bob. I opened it.
He's coming home.
- Is he all right?
- Oh, yeah. He's all right.
He just got shot in the leg.
Nothing really too heavy. He's all right.
Will you always be my friend?
Yes.
Say "always".
Always. I'll always be your friend.
That's very good.
I'm gonna miss you.
There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there...
Hello.
Hold on a second, will you?
Yeah. This is he.
Hey, what I have to say to high-school kids, they're not ready for.
Yeah. Well, that was televisi贸n.
I was angry. I was upset.
What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say: Hooray for our side
It's time we stop,
hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your lives it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line,
the man come take you away
We better stop,
hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
We better stop,
hey, what's that sound...
What the hell did you do to your hair?
I've stopped straightening it.
Where's all the demonstrators?
Some asshole on the plane said there'd be a bunch of flower-heads out here.
There are some kids out there but they can't come on the base.
- Does your leg hurt?
- No.
- What do you think?
- About what?
Our new car.
The Speedster?
It's outstanding. Absolutely outstanding.
I'm glad you're back.
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!
- Peace, brother.
- Peace on you too, brother.
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten...
You never told me that you were this close to the beach.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You're full of surprises.
Hey! Welcome back, hero.
- Vi. How are you?
- Great.
- So tell me, how's Dink?
- Dink is fine.
- He's kicking everybody's ass, as always.
- Great.
No, ladies first, but I'll have the number two one.
- Oh, my God. Does this look good.
- Cheers.
Are you hungry?
I made some Swedish meatballs to nibble on. They go great with drinks.
Do you like it?
- How's the surf?
- It's good.
Why don't you sit down, sweetheart?
So, Bob, tell us about your foot.
It's not my foot, it's my leg, and it's a goddamn bore.
Just like this whole fucking war is boring.
But, ladies... old Bob has gotta tell you one thing that is not boring, and that is the good old US of A martini.
Of which I am going to partake as much as I can as quick as I can.
Drink it up. I made gallons.
So come on, Bob.
Tell us the story about your leg.
- What happened?
- There's nothing to tell.
I'm a fucking hero, I'm getting a medal, and that's the story of my leg!
- Nothing to it, is there?
- Great.
- It ain't great.
- How did it happen?
It's just a boring story. I'm on my way to the showers. Got an M-16 in one hand...
- On your way to the showers?
- Yeah. Why not?
Everywhere you go you carry your M-16, particularly when you go to the showers!
There I am, like every other asshole, trucking on down the road to the showers and I tripped and shot myself right in the calf.
- Oh, my God.
- And that's it.
- Dink should've thought of that.
- I didn't think of that!
- It was a goddamn accident!
- Bob, you don't have to get mad.
- Yeah, but it was an accident.
- Why are they decorating you?
- Where's the head?
- Right there.
I promised a guy from 'Nam I'd have a drink with him at the Officers Club and I gotta go.
I'll be back for dinner.
- Goddamn!
You could've aimed better if you'd had your lights on.
Man, if you keep your lights on, you wouldn't need things like that.
Looks like a fucking smithereen job to me.
Yeah, like fucking...
Not in the front of the boats. You know?
The SSS...
Oh.
Sally. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, darling.
Hey, don't run out on me, you...
These are two friends of mine.
Sally, wait a minute. Sally, Sally.
My wife, Sally. This is...
- What was your name?
- Monty.
- Hey!
I don't know who they are. Who are you?
- This is my wife, Sally.
Fish. There's two things that smell like fish. One of them's fish.
- They laughed, didn't they?
- Go on, already.
"Avoid loud and aggressive persons.
They are vexatious to the spirit."
"Keep interested in your own career."
"However humble, it is a real possessi贸n in the changing fortunes of time."
What is that tank for up there?
What's that turtle's name?
- Let's give him a drink.
- No.
No, no. Don't put beer in the tank.
Wait! You'll kill the goddamn...
No! You ain't feeding no turtle.
You nickel-dick. That's not even a real...
That's a plastic turtle.
Don't look at that turtle.
I don't want you to look at that turtle.
You hear about the female peanut walking down the street at night?
She was assaulted.
- That's the third time he's told that joke!
- She was a salted and he was insulted!
Bob?
Bob.
- Captain Hyde?
- Yeah.
The major's ready.
Major Haller, this is Captain Hyde.
- Captain Hyde. This is Mr Ott.
- How do you do, sir?
- Mr Roberts.
- Captain. How are you?
They're with the FBI.
Would you like to have a seat?
No, thanks.
Well, Captain, what can you tell us about Luke Martin?
Aren't you gonna park?
- What are you gonna do?
- Drive.
Well... I'll come with you.
I'd just like to be by myself.
Please.
Are you gonna be long?
No.
When that gun goes off, you gotta uncoil like a spring. Just release.
Swimmers, take your marks.
You gotta put everything you have into that moment, right?
And get as far toward the... I used to think about the other end of the pool.
Are you Luke Martin?
- Depends.
- I'm Bob Hyde.
Uh... Let's take a little break, Mark, OK?
I told Sally I was going to do this.
You have a right to know about the surveillance. They watched the house.
They got pictures. They got tapes.
Thanks for... for letting me know.
That's all I had to say.
The rest is up to Sally.
I guess.
See you.
Now the time has come
No place to run...
Hello.
Luke. What? How am I taking what?
He didn't tell you?
I could have sworn that...
Listen. They had some surveillance on me because of the gate thing.
Yeah?
Oh, my God!
Listen. I'm gonna be here.
If you need me, call me.
I'm just here.
I wanted to talk to you.
You seem so far away from me since you came back.
I just... I've been scared.
I love you.
I do.
I'm not going to make excuses for what happened.
It happened.
I needed somebody. I was lonely.
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's not...
- Bob, I was lonely.
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's not bullshit.
- It's bullshit!
- Bob, please...
- It's bullshit!
Everybody needs somebody, for Christ's sake!
If it's over with us, it's over!
You're saying you won't even make the effort?
What I'm saying is...
I do not belong in this house!
- And they say I don't belong over there!
- Who's "they"?
The people that make the decisions about the fucking war!
- Bob, I don't wanna talk about the war.
- What, then? The fucking marriage?
Think about that.
I can't talk to you when you're shouting at me.
I wanna be your husband.
I just don't deserve to be your husband.
I don't deserve the fucking medal either.
How can they give you a medal for a war they don't even want you to fight?
- Who is that?
- Bob? Sally? Can I talk to you?
- It's Luke. Let me tell him to go away.
- Wait a minute. You just wait right there.
I don't wanna make anything more complicated than it already is.
I just thought there might be a few things that... we should talk about.
Well, they're not very complicated.
It's actually very simple.
- I don't belong here.
- You belong here.
I just wanted to get things straight, what's going on with me, so you know where I'm coming from and what happened.
I know where you're coming from.
And I know what happened.
I've just gotta figure out for myself what happened and how I'm gonna deal with it.
- I can understand that.
- Bullshit!
- Don't.
- You jodie fuck!
You get back! Get back, slope cunt!
Now you, jodie motherfucker, explain to me how it is you understand anything.
I understand because I'm a brother and
I've been in the same place you're at now.
That's why I feel bad that I made it harder for you than it already is.
That's bullshit.
She's here because she loves you.
There was never any question of that.
- Don't tell me that, goddamnit!
- It's true, Bob.
Bullshit! Bullshit!
If you give her a chance, she can help you.
She wants to listen to you and she wants to understand you.
Say something else, fuck.
Say something else, fuck.
I'm not the enemy.
Maybe the enemy is the fucking war.
But you don't want to kill anybody here.
You have enough ghosts to carry around.
Look at me. I'm...
My hand.
I was shaking.
I'm sorry.
I'm fucked.
I just wanna be a hero. That's all.
I just wanna be a fucking hero.
One day in my life, one moment,
I wanna go out a hero.
That way I would have done something that was mine, that I've done.
Enemy forces had captured the north side of the bridge when Lieutenant Roscoe charged forward firing his rifle.
Lieutenant Roscoe's actions so unnerved the enemy, they withdrew, allowing the lieutenant to secure the enemy position until the rest of his company could move forward and consolidate their forces.
Lieutenant Roscoe maintained the position against repeated attacks and, though wounded, continued to inspire his men until reinforcements arrived the following day.
Lieutenant Roscoe has upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States naval service.
The Marine Corps builds body, mind and spirit. Thank you.
And now, with a different perspective, we have Luke Martin, combat veteran of the Marine Corps.
- Sergeant, mind if I ask you a question?
- No, sir.
Just call me Sergeant - that's what I was.
- Where were you stationed?
- Da Nang.
I thought I'd go get some steaks for a barbecue. Would you like that?
It's been a long time since you've lit a barbecue.
The charcoal's under the kitchen sink.
I'm gonna see if Vi wants to come with me. See you later.
You want to be a part of it and patriotic and go out and... get your licks in for the US of A.
And when you get over there, it's a totally different situation.
I mean... you grow up real quick because all you're seeing is a lot of death.
Once I was a soldier
And I fought on foreign sands for you
Once I was a hunter...
And I know some of you are gonna look at that uniform and you're gonna remember all the films and think about the glory of other wars and think about some vague... patriotic feeling and go off and fight this turkey too.
Soon there'll be another
To tell you I was just a lie
And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you ever...
I'm telling you it ain't like it is in the movies. I didn't have a choice.
When I was your age, all I got was some guy standing up like that man and giving me bullshit, which I caught.
I was really in good shape then.
I was captain of the football team.
I wanted to be a war hero, man.
I wanted to go out and kill for my country.
Once I was a lover
And I searched behind your eyes for you
And soon there'll be another...
And now I'm here to tell you that
I have killed for my country or whatever and I don't feel good about it.
Because there's not enough reason, man... to feel a person die in your hands or to see your best buddy get blown away.
I'm here to tell you it's a lousy thing, man.
I don't see any reason for it.
And there's a lot of shit that I did over there that I find fucking hard to live with.
And I don't wanna see people like you coming back and having to face the rest of your lives with that shit. It's as simple as that.
I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm a lot fucking smarter now than when I went.
And I'm just telling you... that there's a choice to be made here.
Will you ever remember me?
Ever
Remember me?
You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back
and think you are still mine
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
Well, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
You are all left out
Out of there without a doubt
Cos baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time
A girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day
It's no good you thinking
that you are still mine
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor unfaithful baby
I said, baby, baby, baby,
you're out of time...
{5333}{5407}After a moving farewell in Berlin...
{5408}{5589}...and a triumphal procession of the Führer along|the whole route over German territory...
{5590}{5670}...the train arrived in Italy.
{5852}{5983}With a festal salutation by the|Fascist organisations...
{5984}{6082}...Hitler's victorial passage to Rome starts.
{6339}{6439}From the Brenner till in Rome the|Führer was greeted...
{6440}{6540}...with the modesty of the|political organisations...
{6541}{6614}...and with an honest national spirit.
{6658}{6739}The capital prepared itself...
{6740}{6855}...to receive the Führer in a festive|yet simple way.
{6856}{6925}The fascist flag and the swastika...
{6926}{7021}...the colors of both nations,|are blowing in the wind.
{7146}{7201}At the station the Duce...
{7202}{7290}...together with minister of foreign affairs Ciano...
{7291}{7370}...meets His Majesty the King.
{7521}{7639}A cannon shot announces the train of the Führer...
{7640}{7770}...who is welcomed with cheering and|the German national anthem.
{8039}{8202}Then follows the solemn meeting between|the Führer, the King...
{8203}{8295}...and the Duce,|founder of the Fascist empire.
{9271}{9341}After the warm welcome...
{9342}{9475}...the first meeting took place|at the Palazzo Quirinale..
{9476}{9608}...with the Duce and the ministers Ciano,|Storace and Alfieri.
{9667}{9743}Afterwards the two leaders left...
{9744}{9819}...for a drive in an open car.
{9820}{9974}The following cars contained the ministers|Von Ribbentrop, Hess and Göbbels...
{9975}{10054}...who had joined their colleagues.
{10192}{10273}The route goes along|Circo Massimo...
{10274}{10399}...and the Viale Africa to|Parta San Paolo and Porta Capena.
{10400}{10493}The area where the Roman Empire|left its traces.
{10990}{11054}The salute to the Unknown Soldier...
{11055}{11164}...is accompanied by belligerent ostentation.
{11165}{11273}The middle of the square|is full of legionaries.
{11274}{11399}The Führer and four soldiers lay a wreath|with red ribbons...
{11400}{11461}...with swastikas.
{11462}{11554}The two leaders salute the Unknown Soldier.
{11823}{11955}After the salute, at which|the arms have been raised unitedly...
{11956}{12067}...a solemn hymn sounds from the ranks...
{12068}{12158}...that is loaded with male transport.
{12159}{12240}It's the battle prayer.
{12471}{12602}From this we gather that the spirit|of Mussolini's warriors...
{12603}{12695}...weathered by many terrible ordeals...
{12696}{12788}...is synonymous with heroism and sacrifice.
{12964}{13039}The first day of the Führer's visit...
{13040}{13116}...ends in front of an enormous crowd.
{13117}{13254}But tomorrow will bring the great day|on the Via dei Fori Imperiali...
{13255}{13392}...when the great parade of our two|armed forces will take place.
{13393}{13463}All of Rome will be present...
{13464}{13602}...when the co-operation of both|nations is sealed.
{17721}{17758}Umberto
{17784}{17839}Umberto, get up.
{18011}{18093}Fabio, Arnaldo.
{18094}{18135}Get up.
{18468}{18504}Romana.
{18543}{18605}You go to the toilet first.
{18743}{18792}Maria Luisa, wake up.
{18880}{18923}Emanuele.
{18955}{19048}Emanuele, it's late already.
{19049}{19121}Is that necessary at five in the morning?
{19122}{19186}It's already almost six.
{19187}{19293}Six?|Couldn't you wake me earlier?
{19294}{19342}I did.
{19480}{19560}So little?|-A strong little cup of coffee.
{19561}{19668}Maria Luisa, get up.|You'll even keep Hitler waiting.
{19669}{19729}Now look at this, six o'clock.
{19730}{19837}No time for gymnastics.|-Then don't come home so late.
{19838}{19937}Can't I ever have a game|of cards with friends?
{19938}{19986}Yes, yes, 'with friends'.
{20030}{20086}Littorio. Come on sweetie.
{20124}{20179}I'm sleepy.
{20180}{20248}Much too early for such a toddler.
{20312}{20405}If you come too late,|it won't by my fault.
{20549}{20604}Come on, it's late already.
{20768}{20811}Ears.
{20949}{21046}Is the toilet free?|-Hurry up, Fabio.
{21047}{21095}Come to the kitchen.
{21155}{21230}Hurry up, papa has to go in.
{21380}{21462}Don't push.|-I was first.
{21463}{21517}My boots.
{21574}{21648}Umberto, give him his cod-liver oil.
{21736}{21806}I'll bring them to the cobbler tomorrow.
{21807}{21860}What good is that to me now?
{21987}{22079}Are you going to the parade or out to dance?|-Stop nagging.
{22224}{22306}Yugoslavia wants to manage Dalmatia
{22307}{22387}we said: get stuffed!
{22388}{22448}Cursing all the time.
{22449}{22518}That's a patriotic song.
{22519}{22586}It is ill-mannered.
{22887}{22948}What is this?
{22949}{23080}Not the holy Catherina. Be ashamed.|If your father would hear this...
{23081}{23136}I got it from him.
{23137}{23261}What would he care|that his child is being spoiled?
{23262}{23387}You can go blind from that.|Ask the chaplain.
{23388}{23498}You mean that half-blind man?|-Yes, that one.
{23562}{23685}He has cataract, you dummy.|And go wash your face.
{23724}{23811}Aren't you getting dressed?|-I'm not going.
{23812}{23909}Then there'll be the devil to pay.|Why don't you want to?
{23910}{24015}They're teasing me because I'm fat.
{24016}{24105}So what? Fat is beautiful.|Get dressed.
{24174}{24278}Mum, there's a hole here.|-Just let it be.
{24279}{24354}Watch out for the milk and get the cups.
{24355}{24480}Would we get something to eat?|-You'll get ration.
{24481}{24554}Mom, can you help me with this sash?
{24630}{24666}Stand up.
{24753}{24791}Pull.
{24843}{24892}Littorio doesn't want to.
{24893}{24992}My arm is in.|-Then pay attention.
{25077}{25193}Blow your nose in it as well.|-In those rags?
{25194}{25303}They nicked my pom-pom.|-It's not called like that.
{25304}{25412}It's called a tassel or a plume.|Use normal words.
{25413}{25483}Then you bring normal magazines.
{25484}{25597}What's with you?|It's not your mother's day today.
{25598}{25697}They pinched my thingy.|What should I do now?
{25698}{25795}I only have two hands.|-Hurry up you.
{25796}{25884}We are going to the Circo Massimo.|-And we to the obelisk.
{25885}{26008}Are you still here? Wouldn't you|make up your bed first?
{26046}{26108}Excuse me.
{26109}{26180}This one is white.|-We'll make it black.
{26181}{26251}Is breakfast ready?|-Yes, yes.
{27951}{28025}Me first.|-Hurry up then.
{28085}{28132}Hold on, your fez.
{28133}{28232}If you have to pee,|tell me in time this time.
{28233}{28281}I did.
{28310}{28454}Iron my blue suit for the|promotion of Rinaldi tomorrow.
{28455}{28553}I don't know him.|-The one that works at the archives.
{28647}{28697}Daddy's beautiful little wolf.
{28698}{28790}You'll have to tell me everything tonight.
{28846}{28884}Aren't you going?
{28885}{28948}Well, if you don't have any domestic help...
{32490}{32551}There is always only one mother.
{32605}{32688}But we could use three of those here.
{32689}{32763}One that does the rooms...
{32764}{32838}...one that cleans the kitchen.
{32907}{32978}And the third one would be me.
{32979}{33050}That one is going to bed again.
{34282}{34350}Let's start here.
{34970}{35007}Jam...
{35264}{35313}Antoneta.
{35482}{35538}First the beds.
{35726}{35775}Leave him alone.
{36064}{36138}In the pygmy empire...
{36272}{36383}Darned, they are like leeches.|Get that Italian.
{36432}{36581}Surprising that such small beasts|commit such beastliness.
{36601}{36738}Damn, we'd better turn to...
{37132}{37232}I am called Antonietta, not Antoneta.
{37233}{37294}Either you say it correctly...
{37295}{37375}...or you shut your pecker. Understood?
{37470}{37525}You'll have to make do with this.
{37539}{37600}Friday you'll get a new one.
{37670}{37757}I don't have any time for you today.
{37848}{37918}Here is some extra seed...
{37919}{37988}...and now keep quiet.
{38073}{38115}Where are you going?
{38116}{38158}Rosmunda, come here.
{38195}{38238}I said, come here.
{38257}{38313}This isn't funny.
{38432}{38519}Good, stay there.|Don't move.
{38907}{38944}Sir.
{42056}{42108}Rosmunda has escaped.
{42169}{42301}Rosmunda has escaped. That's not a human,|but a bird. A grackle.
{42423}{42541}Maybe I could grab her from your window,|if I may?
{42885}{42928}There she is.
{42929}{42997}Come on, I have a snack.
{43142}{43216}She didn't eat yet.
{43420}{43500}Maybe if you put it on this...
{44233}{44326}I'm sorry I am disturbing you,|but she's a part of the family.
{44327}{44391}Otherwise there'll be hell tonight.
{44424}{44510}Luckily you didn't go to the parade.
{44511}{44575}I would have liked to go.
{44576}{44685}But with a husband and so many|children to take care of...
{44730}{44811}Do you know how many children I have?
{44812}{44893}No, you are not disturbing at all.
{44983}{45063}I said I have six children.
{45064}{45182}by your seventh they give you a bonus and...
{45245}{45301}That doesn't interest you at all.
{45441}{45484}Why are you laughing?
{45533}{45588}Just like that.
{45589}{45675}Life is made up of different moments.
{45676}{45795}And sometimes you have to laugh just like that,|just as with sneezing.
{45796}{45854}Don't you ever have that?
{45855}{45912}You are laughing at me.|-No.
{45958}{46032}But I should be grateful to you.
{46033}{46124}And I am grateful to you|that you came now of all times.
{46170}{46226}I don't understand.
{46227}{46332}Forget about it.|I am not my normal self today.
{46464}{46532}I have to go.
{46533}{46658}Wait. Could I offer you something?|Although I haven't got much.
{46659}{46758}No, I really have to go.|-Please, one cup of coffee.
{46759}{46833}No, I really have to go.
{46834}{46882}As you wish.
{46970}{47057}Sorry for the mess.|-Are you reading this one?
{47058}{47182}Yes, I have a lot of spare time.|Didn't I say so?
{47183}{47308}The Four Musketeers from the radio.|We are also playing.
{47309}{47396}Here there're only three.|Let's say, the original.
{47397}{47483}Do you want to read it?|-I would like to.
{47484}{47532}But I don't have the time anyway.
{47533}{47658}You can keep it. In any case I was...|-It will have to be another time.
{47659}{47732}I don't think that...
{47733}{47864}I have been living here for two months|and we have never seen each other.
{47865}{47929}When do things like that happen again?
{47930}{47994}When Rosmunda escapes again.
{48083}{48182}Hello? It's you. Finally.
{48201}{48326}Yes, almost everything. It's not much,|only books.
{48327}{48382}Most of them belong to you.
{48495}{48633}I heard about it yesterday. They are always|doing that during those ceremonies.
{48634}{48730}By way of precaution.|He'll be out in a couple of days.
{48766}{48890}Yes, excuse me. I'll call you back soon.
{48943}{48979}See you soon.
{49253}{49315}You want to know the purpose of that?
{49316}{49352}Pay attention.
{49484}{49533}And back.
{49653}{49720}Give me a hand.
{49721}{49827}Watch the numbers. Ahead.|Start left.
{49911}{50002}But what is this?|What are we doing?
{50003}{50038}The rumba.
{50092}{50197}I can't dance.|My oldest daughter can...
{50198}{50253}...but me on my age.
{50397}{50491}I have a ladder in my stocking.|Just put it on newly this morning.
{50798}{50916}Give it a try. It's very easy.|Start left.
{51111}{51169}Are you going out to dance often?|-Never.
{51170}{51248}So why are you learning the rumba?|-Just like that.
{51815}{51881}That is less suitable to dance on.
{51930}{52017}I'd better go.|I have something on the stove.
{52161}{52262}Pleased to meet you.|-My name is Gabriele.
{52263}{52342}We even didn't introduce ourselves.
{52343}{52416}Pleased to meet you, Antonietta Tiberi.
{52486}{52535}That is a beautiful name.
{52898}{52976}Italian broadcasting-organization EIAR.
{52977}{53054}Station Rome, Naples, Bari...
{53061}{53164}...Milan, Turin, Genoa, Trieste,|Florence, Bolzano.
{53165}{53214}All EIAR-stations...
{53215}{53365}...together with the stations of the Reich|and the new one in Addis Ababa...
{53366}{53516}...will broadcast the report about|the parade in honor of the Führer.
{53542}{53591}I caught her.
{54580}{54666}We are switching to the Via dei Trionfi.
{54805}{54866}At the base of the Palatino and the Celio...
{54867}{54986}...along one of the most beautiful roads|of Mussolini's Rome...
{54987}{55054}...it is crowded with people.
{55055}{55141}Hundreds of thousands of Italians and foreigners...
{55142}{55286}...have come from far and near|to be present at this celebration...
{55287}{55430}...and the Eternal City welcomes them|in all her majesty.
{55431}{55521}A festive mood during the waiting...
{55522}{55607}...and an orderly swarming everywhere.
{55608}{55742}...a clear proof of efficiency|in all layers of citizenry.
{55743}{55847}Also in the barracks great joy holds dominion.
{55848}{56036}Troops that went to battle yesterday,|are forming a guard of honor now.
{56037}{56148}Furbished up and all|they are waiting for the starting signal.
{56149}{56314}The huge stream of people|has been put on the right lines.
{56315}{56429}The streets have a classical sight...
{56430}{56554}...now they are full of a people|that has earned its footprints..
{56555}{56679}...as rivers in which human destiny|has flooded its banks.
{58142}{58210}He called her back straight away.
{58236}{58289}Why should I care?
{58623}{58701}It's your fault I lost the whole morning.
{58824}{58966}I should be used to it.|Already when I was a child I was locked up or alone.
{58995}{59091}Of course you do matter.|It's only so absurd.
{59092}{59176}They want us to feel guilty.
{59177}{59302}Today I almost had, how does one say that,|committed a stupidity.
{59303}{59386}The arrival of an opposite neighbor saved me.
{59387}{59441}No, you can rest easy.
{59442}{59548}Life is worth living anyway?
{59549}{59629}A bird will come to remind you of it.
{59630}{59767}Only it's a special day for me today.
{59768}{59829}Just like in a dream...
{59830}{59923}...in which you want to scream|but you cannot.
{59924}{60016}And I want to talk, talk.|You notice that?
{60017}{60148}I would like to step into the street|and tell a stranger all about myself.
{60149}{60305}I would like to scare him,|threaten him, do something to him.
{60306}{60386}Everything better than being locked up here.
{60387}{60454}You say nothing?
{60461}{60541}Marco? Then say some something, damnit!
{60542}{60679}It doesn't matter. About the weather, sports,|a book you're reading.
{60723}{60766}Sorry.
{60805}{60879}Yes, you are having a tough time as well.
{60880}{60998}No, we can't see one another|and that is just as well.
{60999}{61117}If you lose the courage,|you need to work off your emotions...
{61118}{61229}...otherwise you're done for.|You understand?
{61267}{61429}Let's just laugh about it. Crying|can be done alone, but not laughing.
{61436}{61536}Do you recall that time in Ostia|with that watermelon?
{61537}{61604}Now come on, please, laugh.
{61698}{61772}What a sad friend have I chosen.
{61798}{61930}Do you know will lie heaviest upon me?|Your absence.
{61931}{62042}Get well again soon.|Tell me how you're doing.
{62043}{62104}Yes, I will call you at once.
{62105}{62216}Bye.|Think about me as much as you can.
{63880}{63935}O, it's you?
{63970}{64019}You don't look very happy.
{64055}{64173}When there's knocking on the door,|I'm always having a bit of a fright.
{64174}{64254}They are always saying 'friends'...
{64255}{64360}...although you don't know them.|-You met them once.
{64386}{64469}You forgot to take this.
{64470}{64623}I hadn't forgotten.|I didn't want to take advantage. And why?
{64624}{64716}No, really not.|-You're doing me a favor.
{64836}{64891}There are also pictures inside.
{64930}{64979}You are so kind...
{65017}{65085}...that it makes me shy.
{65158}{65194}The airplanes.
{65392}{65522}When the airplanes come over...|-The 'fascinating life of a pilot'
{65592}{65742}It will take me long.|I have little time to read.
{65743}{65816}Considering all the work here.
{65942}{65991}Thank you again.
{66154}{66216}Would you have a cup of coffee?
{66242}{66291}Coffee?
{66292}{66372}Of course. I beg your pardon.
{66424}{66466}Please come in.
{66523}{66585}But don't pay attention to the mess.
{66586}{66667}Order is the virtue of mediocrity.
{66668}{66716}In that case I must be a genius.
{66804}{66935}I thought you had already made coffee.|-It only takes a minute, but not here.
{66936}{67054}No men in the kitchen.|-I am used to it, being a bachelor.
{67055}{67090}Bachelor?
{67129}{67225}Then you're paying extra taxes.
{67226}{67321}Just as if loneliness is such a wealth.
{67404}{67478}May I? I like to do that.
{67566}{67671}My grandpa had every grandchild|grind three times.
{67710}{67771}Till all beans had been grinded.
{67810}{67896}He got angry when I had|turned four times.
{68029}{68103}I'll go get my coffeepot.
{70429}{70490}In which line of work are you?
{70535}{70639}I am a presenter for the radio.|-For the radio?
{70684}{70759}But I have been suspended.
{70760}{70834}Till some things have been cleared up.
{70916}{70990}That curl looks nice on you.
{71028}{71083}It always comes off.
{71153}{71234}My husband works at|the ministry for East-Africa.
{71235}{71316}He is, how shall I put it...
{71317}{71390}...head of a department.
{71484}{71584}But your work will probably give|you satisfaction as well.
{71585}{71627}Fairly well, yes.
{71628}{71721}We don't have any radio yet because we...
{71741}{71840}Who could that be?|-'Friends' that's what they say right?
{71920}{71969}Who is there?|-It's me.
{72009}{72147}I am coming to get the key of the terrace.|You ought to have it.
{72148}{72206}I have to get the laundry.
{72207}{72242}What's wrong?
{72297}{72406}I wasn't thinking about you. If you're alone|and there's a ring at the door...
{72407}{72508}Exactly what I wanted to say to you.
{72509}{72624}Like they generally say:|Better off alone than in bad company.
{72625}{72739}That one over there, I know nothing about it,|but it looks to me as if...
{72740}{72815}...you'd be better off seeing the back of him.
{72841}{72984}The gentleman from across?|He helped me with Rosmunda.
{72985}{73065}I don't want have anything to do with it.
{73066}{73197}I only know that it's a queer fish,|a strange guy, a villain.
{73223}{73322}In short, I don't like him|and he me neither.
{73753}{73822}Excuse me.
{73823}{73890}That was the warden.
{73891}{74031}She knows that you are here. She has|certainly seen you. I didn't say anything.
{74042}{74134}Not because one thing and another all this, but...
{74160}{74217}...it's such a gossip monger.
{74248}{74310}Maybe it would be better...
{74311}{74405}You want me to go.|-I don't want you to.
{74406}{74517}You are so kind. I am sorry...
{74518}{74566}...but it's better.
{74567}{74717}It's always about what others think.|Even though they are wrong.
{74718}{74760}And what about you?
{74761}{74885}You also stopped grinding coffee|so that she couldn't hear you.
{74973}{75010}Hold on for a second.
{75048}{75129}I also want coffee. Come.
{75136}{75198}I don't want to cause you any trouble.
{75199}{75291}You also said it would be better...|-I said, I said...
{75330}{75385}I am not used to it.
{75417}{75579}You are a stranger and nobody is home.|Maybe it's not right.
{75617}{75735}I am boring you with all this babbling.
{75805}{75879}You'd better have gone to a bar.
{75948}{76066}It's always sinking.|-It needs more counterweight.
{76092}{76254}Are you also an electrician on top of being a..|what's the name of that, presenter?
{76355}{76441}So you are talking and all Italy listens.
{76498}{76642}And if you rush into laughing?|-There is a heavy fine on that.
{76643}{76704}Did you get it?|-You bet.
{76755}{76841}There we have our Rosmunda.
{77392}{77454}This is one of your colleagues?
{77455}{77591}Guido Lotari. He is very good,|he doesn't rush into laughing.
{77667}{77792}That's the alarm clock. I set it for each hour,|in order to divide my time better.
{77842}{77938}If it goes off again, it's 12 o'clock.
{77939}{78054}Wouldn't you better watch the clock?|-I forget that all the time.
{78192}{78241}Are you crazy?
{78261}{78341}You can't do that here in the room.
{78342}{78447}Where are you going?|-I love to ride a scooter.
{78561}{78674}I'm getting coffee. Please sit down.|-I don't want to be troublesome.
{78675}{78729}As long as you stay seated.
{80561}{80654}Weird to see yourself from the opposite side.
{80736}{80822}What did you say?|-Nothing.
{81505}{81601}Do you know Rabagliati personally?
{81602}{81733}I imagine him like a long|tall man, always cheerful.
{81734}{81776}Like me.
{81872}{81941}You don't seem very cheerful to me.
{81942}{82010}That depends on the day.
{82036}{82148}He sings so beautifully, with so much feeling.
{83139}{83255}'If you say you love Mussolini...
{83256}{83402}...I am not jealous as a husband. '|Song from the Abruzzen.
{83711}{83760}Do you like my album?
{83761}{83849}Is it yours?|I thought it belonged to the children.
{83850}{83936}No, it's mine. Do you like it?
{83937}{83991}What a beautiful horse.
{83992}{84151}That's Ned. There's three of them:|Ned, Aprile and Fru Fru. How much sugar?
{84152}{84210}Three. No, two.
{84308}{84446}They say he mounts a horse in the morning|and a woman in the evening.
{84447}{84526}Poor horses, and poor women.
{84621}{84680}They say so much about him.
{84681}{84779}Delicious.|Luckily you didn't want my coffee.
{84880}{84983}Do you know that...
{84984}{85038}...I once met him?
{85079}{85177}Really? Where?|-At the Villa Borghese.
{85227}{85284}He was passing by on his horse.
{85285}{85397}I stood still and he took a brief look at me|while he was at a gallop.
{85398}{85473}I was completely ablaze.
{85474}{85549}I was standing there with a full shopping bag.
{85550}{85615}I felt my knees buckle.
{85616}{85756}Then everything around me started to turn|and I fainted.
{85779}{85831}A look while at a gallop?
{85883}{86013}Passers-by put me back on my feet|and I stumbled to the tram.
{86051}{86157}That day I noticed I was expecting Littorio.
{86483}{86583}Given the physiology and the|psychology of the woman...
{86584}{86661}...the genius can only be a man.
{86662}{86713}Do you agree with that?
{86776}{86864}Of course I do agree with that.|Why?
{87001}{87088}The history books are full of men.
{87129}{87194}Yes, maybe a little too much.
{87195}{87306}There is no place for others,|not to mention women.
{87505}{87579}You are quite a complicated man.
{87658}{87763}My mother wasn't a man,|still she was a genius.
{87764}{87926}She was writing, painting, working as an|accountant. She took care of everything.
{87927}{88010}All decisions were made by her.
{88011}{88132}The only thing my father ever decided,|was leaving home.
{88158}{88305}She was such a marvelous woman,|but she didn't know how to keep her man.
{88306}{88375}Or maybe she didn't want to.
{88658}{88738}My mother was quite a different person.
{88739}{88869}At night when my father came home,|we were still living in Naples...
{88933}{88994}That must be her again.
{88995}{89107}Tell her I'm in here,|in case they are looking for me.
{89164}{89239}Stay calm|-Why? I am calm.
{89508}{89670}Here is the key of the terrace.|I saw that your laundry is also dry.
{89671}{89707}Thank you. I'll go in a bit.
{89748}{89788}Is he still there?
{89833}{89946}Yes, he's fixing the lamp in the kitchen.
{89947}{90073}That one? I even wouldn't let him touch my dustbin.
{90074}{90135}What is it you have against him?
{90136}{90280}I say this for your own good. Certain|people are bad for your name.
{90281}{90329}I didn't want to say it...
{90330}{90449}...but that one from the sixth is|a wart, a traitor...
{90450}{90504}...an antifascist.
{90505}{90604}In short, a bastard.
{90648}{90729}Why do you think he had to leave the radio?
{90730}{90855}They said: are you spitting in the same plate|that you're eating from?
{90856}{90925}Then please return the plate.
{91005}{91154}But such a decent man|can't be an antifascist.
{91155}{91342}That doesn't mean a thing. I know|a thief that once went thieving here...
{91343}{91455}...and is a Chief of Police now.
{91456}{91510}That doesn't mean a thing right?
{91511}{91654}What matters is if somebody is loyal to|the party. That's the way it is right?
{92183}{92245}Where are you?|-Here.
{92427}{92470}What are you doing?
{92471}{92594}Fixing the lamp. Just in case|the warden comes to check it.
{92595}{92718}You have been eavesdropping.|-Only in the beginning. The rest was too soft.
{92719}{92780}Never mind. I have to go upstairs.
{92781}{92876}I'm almost finished.|What did she say about me?
{92921}{92957}Nothing.
{92977}{93058}What should she say?
{93059}{93209}I am her favorite subject,|after her late husband of course...
{93210}{93312}...who chose to die in the black shirt.
{93313}{93415}He was a good man, a fascist.|Not a defeatist...
{93416}{93499}...not a subversive person.
{93500}{93583}Like me. You see?
{93627}{93733}When people talk, some part of it is always true.
{93765}{93852}That one from the sixth doesn't oppose fascism.
{93853}{93924}Fascism opposes him.
{93925}{94044}Yes, it's always somebody else's fault.|Stop it, will you?
{94087}{94146}Just a little more sand.
{94187}{94319}So why were you dismissed from the radio?|Just for fun?
{94402}{94534}Maybe because my voice was not|like it should have been:
{94535}{94614}Solemn, belligerent, full of Roman pride.
{94615}{94726}I didn't have any Roman pride|because I'm from Viterbo.
{94765}{94826}You have quite a sweet talk.
{94827}{94964}To be honest I think they did the right thing.
{95171}{95220}A shock.
{95221}{95308}Tricked you.|-Drop dead.
{95309}{95398}Sorry, you scared me out of my wits.
{95399}{95559}What should she think about it?|And that in my own house. Come on.
{95560}{95645}I wanted to make you laugh.|-I laugh my head off.
{95646}{95795}But the lamp has been fixed.|-Fine. Just send me the bill.
{95846}{95908}Those are all buttons?
{95909}{96034}Did you make this too?|-Indeed. Do you mind?
{96035}{96089}No, it's magnificent.
{96090}{96215}Since the introduction of the zipper,|we have to think up something for the buttons.
{96216}{96270}You are not funny at all.
{96377}{96513}Now suddenly you also have to go upstairs?|-Yes, in order to avoid the warden.
{96668}{96736}You could have given your opinion straight away.
{96737}{96829}You could have given your opinion straight away.|-About what?
{96868}{96917}The photo album.
{96943}{97075}What difference would that have been made?|-Everything. I wouldn't have let you in.
{97076}{97208}How come? Are you so sure of yourself?|-Definitely. That's not mine.
{97234}{97394}I don't talk to somebody who criticizes|and ridiculizes everything.
{97398}{97549}You laugh about everything.|-I have little reason to laugh.
{97569}{97694}So why aren't you laughing?|You should have everything you want?
{97714}{97824}A home, a husband, six children.|Why aren't you laughing?
{97825}{97895}And it's forbidden to say 'lei'.
{97896}{98053}You have to say 'voi'. You are doing|it intentionally, saying 'lei' all day long.
{98080}{98150}Lei this and lei that...
{98461}{98510}Did you leave?
{98571}{98627}Thank goodness.
{98628}{98679}Couldn't he say goodbye?
{98818}{98917}I won't say 'madam' anymore.|Only 'you'.
{99036}{99117}Finally you're laughing.|-No way!
{99118}{99198}Too bad. According to me|you're much more beautiful then.
{99199}{99255}I used to be maybe.
{99256}{99291}Peace?
{99818}{99925}'Joke ends tragically. '|You have scratched me.
{99926}{99961}Serves you right.
{100014}{100050}What's wrong?
{100105}{100229}I am fed up to the back teeth|with your so called jokes.
{100386}{100505}I don't know what you had in mind,|but you are mistaking.
{100506}{100592}Don't give me that look,|because you understand perfectly well.
{100793}{100917}Antonietta, I swear|I didn’t have any mischief in mind.
{100918}{101061}Yeah right. You embraced me coincidentally.|You men are all the same.
{101062}{101199}I was already expecting it for quite some time.|-You were expecting it? From me?
{101200}{101289}First The Three Musketeers,|then coffee.
{101290}{101379}In your social environment|it's quite different of course.
{101399}{101518}I'll do it alone.|-No, at home I was also always helping.
{101519}{101598}Actresses, singers, announcers...
{101743}{101804}That's why you have telephone.
{102374}{102410}Go away.
{102518}{102573}Go away, please.
{102618}{102679}I said 'please'.
{102730}{102773}You have to go.
{102811}{102898}When you embraced me...
{102899}{102979}...I was particularly angry with myself.
{103024}{103079}Because...
{103180}{103254}...because I am already looking|at you the entire day.
{103493}{103554}You have to go.
{103555}{103629}I have never... Believe me.
{103630}{103704}It's the first time.
{103730}{103861}The first.|Gabriele, please say...
{103862}{103910}...that it's important.
{104461}{104535}In your album it says somewhere:
{104536}{104654}A man has to be husband,|father and soldier.
{104755}{104829}I am not a husband...
{104874}{104967}...not a father and not a soldier.
{105411}{105454}What do you mean?
{105493}{105617}I didn't leave the radio|because of my voice.
{105693}{105775}'Defeatist, unusable...
{105776}{105855}...with depraved tendencies. '
{105856}{105905}That is what they said.
{106111}{106148}I don't understand.
{106186}{106254}You understood perfectly well.
{106318}{106367}It is true.
{106693}{106768}What did you expect?
{106769}{106842}Kisses, intimacies?
{106843}{106982}That's what you were expecting the whole day.|That's what you do with a woman right?
{106983}{107084}All men are the same after all.|-Don't touch me.
{107085}{107214}You must make them feel it.|Isn't this the most important muscle?
{107268}{107304}Don't touch me.
{107343}{107418}I am sorry,|but you were mistaking.
{107419}{107494}I am not the guy you were hoping for.
{107495}{107546}I am a faggot.
{107547}{107598}That's how they call that.
{107630}{107774}At the billiard club they'd stick the cue|in your bottom, if they would find out.
{107775}{107892}That's what they would do.|-What do you know about that?
{107893}{108030}Such a harmless little woman that|had to marry, but ever so decent.
{108031}{108131}And then you say: 'It happened in a weak moment. '
{108132}{108268}She's having herself jumped on the terrace|but still she always has an opinion.
{108269}{108339}What do you know about that?|What do you know?
{108340}{108430}The warden hears it.|-I'll call her.
{108487}{108615}Then they all know that the guy from|the sixth is bent...
{108641}{108685}...a faggot...
{108686}{108729}...gay...
{108793}{108836}...a poofter.
{112332}{112375}I am sorry.
{112421}{112529}Come in.|I was just making an omelet.
{115187}{115293}I even got engaged to somebody.
{115294}{115362}She was working at the radio.
{115363}{115411}Just to pretend.
{115444}{115586}We even went out for dinner, to the movies,|so that everybody would see us.
{115624}{115717}We were both behaving like|we were madly in love.
{115743}{115845}She was a good friend|who wanted to help me.
{115846}{115948}But I was probably playing my part too bad.
{115987}{116125}One day I was called before|the management and they said:
{116126}{116205}You are not a part of the family anymore.
{116206}{116331}You are no longer member of the party.|I am member. No, not anymore.
{116332}{116405}Because people like you...
{116406}{116517}...cannot be a member of|a party for men.
{116573}{116680}Then I tried to make a countermove...
{116681}{116831}...with a medical certificate that|I wasn't a homosexual.
{116832}{116907}That I am a normal person.
{116908}{117001}Did they believe that?|-Hell no.
{117002}{117092}Worse. It was very stupid.
{117093}{117230}If you really aren’t one, you don't walk|around with a such a certificate.
{117403}{117466}And that's the worst.
{117467}{117586}You're trying to appear different|from who you are.
{117627}{117755}They force you to feel ashamed,|to hide yourself.
{117974}{118048}But to me you did say it.
{118049}{118186}With you I found the courage,|because you are different from the rest.
{118231}{118267}Not true.
{118293}{118374}I slapped you.
{118375}{118474}Yes, but still you're here with me.
{119062}{119124}How do you make a living?
{119143}{119249}I am sending the advertisements|for a big firm.
{119250}{119355}I write the addresses on|the envelopes.
{119393}{119492}I took that over from a friend.
{119531}{119614}He left one year ago.
{119615}{119698}He was exiled to Sardinia.
{119731}{119840}Was he subversive?
{119841}{119961}Just as subversive as I.|I waved him goodbye...
{120031}{120192}...when he went aboard.|That was the last time I saw him.
{120462}{120530}You have such a beautiful handwriting.
{120531}{120599}Will you send me one as well?
{120831}{120931}Very often I feel...
{120932}{120980}...humiliated...
{121031}{121092}...treated like a nobody.
{121209}{121291}My husband doesn't talk much to me,|he gives orders.
{121510}{121612}Since our engagement|we haven't laughed anymore.
{121718}{121812}He laughs outdoors,|with other women.
{121813}{121874}Isn't he faithful to you?
{121875}{121986}I thought you were happy.
{122075}{122117}Faithful.
{122162}{122210}To the mother country.
{122248}{122341}Those places where men go...
{122386}{122441}...against payment.
{122480}{122567}They know him better there than in the office.
{122667}{122747}If only it would stick to that.
{122892}{123010}Last month I found a letter|from a certain Laura...
{123011}{123129}...a schoolmistress in the|Via Ruggero Bonghi.
{123192}{123285}To date an educated woman.
{123363}{123435}That is as if a man...
{123530}{123618}...says to his wife|that she's an idiot.
{123705}{123805}I haven't been attending school|for a long time.
{123806}{123904}And a letter like that one...
{123905}{123992}...even when I loved him...
{123993}{124079}...I never wrote him.
{124161}{124235}Because I am not able to.
{124467}{124604}You can do anything to a stupid person|because there is not respect.
{124777}{124839}I think you're sweet, Gabriele...
{124840}{124879}...very sweet.
{124917}{124966}The way you are.
{125005}{125066}The things you told...
{125098}{125179}...make no difference to me.
{125273}{125341}That is very sweet of you.
{125530}{125591}I'm thinking about myself.
{126005}{126079}I like it when you touch me.
{130005}{130054}Strange...
{130055}{130112}...I don't feel guilty.
{130163}{130199}On the contrary.
{130280}{130354}With him it was never like this.
{130517}{130580}I didn't know it could be like this.
{130692}{130741}And you?
{130749}{130918}If you are like me,|you can easily make love to a woman.
{130919}{130973}It's different.
{131012}{131108}It was nice, but it doesn't change anything.
{131662}{131716}That we got acquainted...
{131717}{131868}...that I talked to you,|that I was here with you, today of all days...
{131869}{131954}...that was very important to me.
{132324}{132423}I will look at your window every day.
{132424}{132529}Just like this morning|when I returned home.
{132549}{132698}I had to look at you all the time|and I didn't get anything done.
{132743}{132817}And if they'll be gone again next week...
{132887}{132961}...I only have to see you...
{132987}{133061}...listen to you.
{133199}{133248}How was the parade?
{133249}{133361}It was nice right?|I heard everything on the radio.
{133487}{133586}They are returning.|I have to get home.
{136275}{136342}I heard everything on the radio.
{136371}{136432}Was it nice?
{136433}{136510}How is Hitler like?|-Very handsome.
{136546}{136658}I heard everything on the radio.|I really enjoyed myself.
{136659}{136726}Was it nice?
{136727}{136801}A historical day.|-Definitely.
{136939}{137064}Did you see that fat general?|-That wasn't Hess. He has a loony air.
{137065}{137188}All Germany was represented.|-My feet hurt.
{137489}{137563}Have you gotten tired?|-No.
{138173}{138283}Everybody called: Duce, Duce.|He loved it.
{138284}{138439}But then he made a signal|that we had to applaud Hitler.
{138440}{138551}Didn't notice that.|-Because you were too far off.
{138552}{138629}You've really missed something, Antonietta.
{138651}{138760}Should we eat soup with a fork?|What's wrong with you?
{138813}{138872}A prophetic day.
{138873}{138931}Unforgettable.
{138932}{139050}And you witnessed it personally.
{139051}{139169}Later you'll be able to say|to your children:
{139170}{139231}On that day I was there.
{139269}{139338}I only had one bread roll.
{139402}{139458}What is that?|-My pom-pom.
{139459}{139513}Can I have the mortadella?
{139570}{139676}Only a cold meal.|You didn't lift a finger.
{139677}{139781}It was a celebration wasn't it?|-You have only been sleeping.
{139857}{139968}We had most cannons.|-More than America?
{139969}{140118}They are good at making movies,|but they're still shooting with arrow and bow.
{140157}{140268}The air force is most beautiful.|-No, the navy.
{140269}{140419}Too bad there were no ships.|-On the Via dell'Impero?
{140420}{140493}Cut it out.|-Hands off!
{140494}{140600}Tomorrow there will be photo’s|for your album again.
{140601}{140705}Tomorrow you can cut photo’s|from the newspaper.
{140762}{140896}I sang myself hoarse.|-Did you see that mounted band?
{140897}{141032}Riding and playing at the same time.|-The Führer's private corps.
{141033}{141101}He's taking that home as well.
{141102}{141168}Littorio eat with your left.
{141169}{141319}The Germans are marching better than we do.|-Because it's tiring.
{141320}{141444}Ours are beautiful as well.|Did you see the alpine riflemen?
{141445}{141518}But the Germans are more elegant.
{141519}{141619}They are our allies.|A good choice of us.
{141620}{141718}If war breaks out,|we'll give them a hell of a time.
{142552}{142637}A day like today|should be celebrated.
{142638}{142769}We'll call the seventh Adolfo.|-No, not tonight.
{142770}{142831}Come to bed quickly.
{142899}{142959}Then we'll sort it out.
{144352}{144437}On the first Monday of April 1625...
{144438}{144588}...Meung, place of birth of the writer,|was one big chaos...
{144589}{144689}...as if the Huguenots tried a second Rochelle.
{146801}{146881}I'm almost ready.|-We are not in a hurry.
{146882}{146962}At what time will the boat leave?|-In three hours.
{147626}{147730}Imagine yourself a Don Quichote|of eighteen years old...
{148040}{148130}...high cheekbones,|a sign of craftiness.
{148980}{149068}All the worse for|the young d'Artagnan...
Yes, sir, I'll give Capt. Nolan your message soon as he returns.
Get him now.
- Yes, sir.
- Do you hear me?
Get him now!
Oh, boy.
He's pretty burned up, isn't he?
The old man wants to see you, right away.
Oh, God, thaùs all I need.
Good luck.
Come in.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Whaùs happened?
That was Admiral Dawes on the radio, sir.
- I mean, it was Admiral Dawes personally.
- So?
I told him what you told me, sir... that you weren't in, and we were still looking for Lt. Lawson.
- And?
- And that didn't seem to satisfy him, sir.
It doesn't satisfy me, either.
What about Lawson?
- He's nowhere on the base, sir.
- Look off the base.
Send out the Shore Patrol.
Bring him in, I don't care where he is.
Yes, sir. We've done that, sir.
If you've done that, there's nothing else to tell me, is there?
No, sir, nothing else.
I just thought you'd like to know what was going on.
Lt. Lawson!
If you're heading for the P.X., get us some more beer.
Anybody seen Lt. Lawson?
- Sam, where you going?
- I thought I'd have me a little grub.
- Wanna come?
- No, I ate already.
There he is!
Lt. Lawson!
Capt. Nolan wants to see you right away, sir.
- Who, me?
- Thaùs right, Lieutenant.
Please, sir. Get in.
Yeah, I'll get in.
- What does he wanna see me about?
- I don't know, sir.
See you tonight, girls.
First come, first served.
You can draw straws.
Here we are, sir.
- Keep the meter running, boys.
- Yes, sir.
- The old man wanna see me?
- Boy, does he wanna see you.
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, John.
Whaùs all the excitement?
They said you were looking for me.
Is that right?
By the way... how'd you make out with that funny broad at the club last night?
I was under the impression that the funny broad was with you.
Hell, I brought her, but she really liked you.
Thaùs why I left.
I wouldn't wanna appear ungallant... but I think I'd just as soon do without your assistance in that direction.
Thaùs nice.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Anyway, whaùs all the panic?
I was just getting ready to eat.
I have a job for you.
What, before I go on leave?
Yes, before you go on leave.
All right, as long as
I'm on that midday plane tomorrow.
Very gracious of you, but iùll take a little longer than that.
Can't, John.
I got a four-weeks' leave coming.
- Later.
- Later nothing.
High noon tomorrow, I'm on that plane.
I'm gonna be in Frisco Sunday night.
We're flying you out of here this afternoon.
You'll be in the New Hebrides Sunday night.
The New Hebrides?
I've your orders here.
You'll report to a British Combat Unit on one of the islands.
They need someone who speaks Japanese.
Combat Unit? Whaùs that?
What the hell is that?
First you talk about postponing my leave, now you're talking about combat?
There are three other officers in the radio section.
Two of them speak better Japanese than me.
- They are all a lot older than you.
- Thaùs good, they're mature.
But who picked on me?
I did. And iùs not a question of picking on you.
The British are organizing this for us... and iùs gonna involve a certain amount of physical hardship.
We have to supply the man.
In my opinion, you're the man for the job.
No, John, negative.
Pick Antonelli, he likes all that military crap.
Not me, no.
I'm sending you, Lieutenant.
"Lieutenant"?
I'm Sam, don't you remember?
Sit down.
- Don't be...
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
I have to comply with an instruction from higher authority.
A lot higher.
In order to do that, I'm obliged to make do with the best possible personnel I have.
I know you're a long way from being right for the job... but only you begin to meet the physical requirements.
Fortunately, they don't appear to be concerned about much else.
So pack your things and report to the Transportation Officer in 25 minutes.
You mentioned a Combat Unit.
I guess that means a bunch of limeys running around... playing soldier, getting shot at, right?
You may not remember this or you may not be aware of it... but I volunteered for the service because as a language specialist...
I was gonna get a bar on my shoulder and be able to sit by a radio... and eavesdrop on those fiendish Orientals.
If they're gonna change those rules...
I just might have to resign that commission.
Thaùs your privilege.
And if I do... you'll have to send another officer.
Right?
The order specifies
"Japanese-speaking personnel."
If you resign your commission, the Navy would be happy to accept it... and send you out there as a Seaman Second Class.
Would you like me to arrange that for you right now?
Yes, sir?
- I can't win, can I?
- No, you can't.
Incidentally, this operation is something the British are mounting for our benefit... so it wouldn't hurt to show them courtesy.
- Courtesy?
- Thaùs right.
You'll get along better if you don't call them "limeys." That kind of thing.
I don't care whether I get along with them or not.
Listen, you miserable bastard,
I'm not interested in your problems.
We lost two PT boats yesterday not 2 miles from that bay down there.
I have to spend the rest of this day writing to folks back in the States.
"Dear Mrs. Smith, a funny thing happened to your boy last night. He got burnt up."
What shall I tell them?
"Too bad your kid couldn't be a bit smarter.
"If he spoke Japanese, we coulÔve gotten him a job sitting on his ass.
"When this mission comes along, he'd say, 'Not me, buddy.'"
Go on, get out of here.
I don't have time for you.
From what I hear, the British won't have time for your selfish...
I hope they get your goddamn head shot off for you.
I'm sure we'll get along just fine, sir.
They're gonna love him.
Come on, scram!
- Toss it up, sir.
- You guys aren't in a hurry, are you?
You know something? I don't think that clown's happy in the service.
Ain't it the living truth.
That bum wouldn't be happy anywhere.
Leùs go.
Okay, back it in.
Thaùs it.
A little to the left.
Hi.
- Boaùs waiting, sir.
- What boat?
There's your boat, Lieutenant.
Thanks a whole lot.
Have a nice trip, Lieutenant.
Left, left, left, right, left!
Makes me a bloody foolish sight.
Thaùs what.
Right, left! Keep those arms up.
Water's hard enough to come by.
Wash out those water barrels!
Get them off my square!
Keep those arms free, keep those heads up!
Go and get that man in the rear or I'll keep dragging you all day!
Get those water barrels off my square!
Okay, bookie's off the course. No more bets.
Ready, set, go!
Connolly.
Your bleeding horse is being left at the post.
Thaùs not fair, Tosh!
Why not?
My jockey's only using his whip, ain't he?
If your bloke doesn't wake his bloody ideas up... you're gonna owe me two packets of fags.
He's right, Connolly.
Even you can run faster than that pig.
All the same, it isn't fair.
Away and pick your nose, you mooning Mary!
But it isn't fair, Campbell. Look at that!
Objection! StewarÔs inquiry!
Gentlemen, objection sustained!
This bloody horse has been doped.
What the hell do you think you're playing at?
Don't argue with the steward, laddie.
I've a mind to report you to the Jockey Club.
Leave him be.
I think his brains have come loose.
Yeah, you better watch it, Thornton.
All right, leùs have you!
Cpl. McLean, get those men fell in.
Scott, right marker here.
One straight line, come on.
- Corporal.
- Sir.
Away and find Pvts. Rogers,
Currie, Rafferty, and Pvt. Riddle.
Whaùs up then, Sarge?
Nothing to worry you.
- Good morning, sir!
- Howdy.
Commanding Officer apologizes.
He would have greeted you personally.
- Iùs okay.
- He's just come back from a reconnaissance.
Col. Thompson is waiting, sir.
If you'll come with me.
- Lf you'll come with me, sir.
- Right.
I'm excused duties, Sergeant.
Is that right?
Listen, laddie, we've had your stripes.
You make it necessary, and I will personally crucify you.
You're on that list because I put you there myself.
If you want a personal interview, you can have it.
And you'll likely find yourself facing a court-martial... for self-inflicted wounds.
Do you hear me all right, laddie?
Yes, Sergeant.
Tosh, whaùs that then?
Iùs a bleeding Yank, isn't it?
No, Connolly, thaùs not a Yank.
Thaùs Snow White.
And very pretty she is, too.
All right!
You've got bugger all to laugh about.
- You there, Hearne!
- Sir.
You're supposed to be standing to attention!
This way, sir!
Col. Thompson will join you in a moment, sir.
All right, attention!
Fall in!
One, two, three, four...
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.
Welcome to the New Hebrides.
Lt. J.G. Sam Lawson reporting... as ordered.
I think we can let the Sergeant Major deal with those.
Yes, rather an imaginative location for a military headquarters, don't you think?
Yeah.
I sometimes wonder what kind of an artist
Gauguin woulÔve become... if he'd had the misfortune to choose this place instead of Tahiti.
Yes, I think there would have been a certain lack of inspiration.
Mind you, I don't know what the natives were like here... but there are none anymore.
I'm sure he woulÔve found the current crop of inhabitants singularly unappealing.
This part up here is all Japanese.
Not at all jolly.
And down here, we have our own group... which I imagine he woulÔve found only marginally more agreeable.
Now, what we really have is the remainder of a Brigade HQ Company... consisting largely of chaps from my regiment... brought up to strength by a rather bizarre variety of odds and sods... who joined us when we scrambled out of Singapore.
A lot of them were just as anxious to escape the Army as they were the Japanese.
But I've no doubt your chaps have told you about all this.
No, sir, my chaps didn't tell me anything.
Recently, though, the casualty rates have been alarmingly high.
However, I'm afraid this little jaunt we've organized now... is going to change all that because, amongst other things... iùs going to make it necessary for us to penetrate all the way to their main base.
Sounds great. When do you leave?
As soon as we've briefed the men.
You'll be leaving in about half an hour or so.
I'll be leaving in half an hour?
It doesn't do to let the men brood about these things, you know.
Come in.
I believe you sent for me, sir.
Yes, Freddie. I wanted to have a chat with you before I talk to the men.
- How are you feeling?
- First rate.
Good. Freddie's been on the sick list the last few days.
I'm so sorry, I don't think you have met yet.
This is Lt. Lawson of the United States Navy.
Lt. Lawson, this is Capt. Hornsby, who'll be leading this patrol.
How do you do?
Glad you'll be coming along.
That makes one of us.
I guess this trip's unavoidable.
I shall be briefing the men in a few minutes.
Perhaps you'd like to get changed?
I take it you did bring some other gear?
This is all I got. What kind of gear?
It doesn't have to be anything terribly formal.
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!
Take the Lieutenant down to the stores... and help him sort out something appropriate for the occasion, would you?
Sir.
I'm afraid our laundry service is a little bit primitive.
We've been reduced to using seawater for everything but drinking... so don't be alarmed if the kit you get is a little bit manky.
"Manky"?
How's the grub?
Iùs a little bit manky, too.
See you later.
If you'll come with me, sir?
- You did say half an hour?
- Yes.
Yeah, I thought you said that.
What an extraordinary fellow.
He is an American.
Yes, but he does actually speak Japanese, does he?
He says so, and I certainly don't feel qualified to put him to the test.
You wanted to talk to me, sir?
- You said...
- Yes, of course. Iùs nothing really.
I wanted to be sure you feel up to it.
Good heavens, yes.
I mean, if you don't feel entirely fit yet,
I can equally send O'Neill.
No, sir, I'm fine.
Anyway, it seems to me to be a marvelous opportunity... to really hurt them, for a change.
Yes. Leùs hope they're not entertaining similar ambitions.
Stand to!
What the hell's that?
All guns and crews!
All guns stand to!
All guns commence fire!
Keep the men out of range of the enemy, Captain.
You men, keep back. Stay in the safety zone.
Keep back in the safety zone.
Trevor's patrol?
Make sure they don't hit our lads!
They'll never make it.
Fire!
They'll be out of enemy rifle range soon, sir.
Are they out of range yet, sir?
They're out of range now, sir.
Keep your guns at ready.
Keep your eyes on that jungle.
Bloody mess.
Terrible bloody mess.
Medical Orderly!
Stretcher bearers!
A week from today... the American Navy proposes sending a convoy up through these straits.
We know that the Japanese have no air reconnaissance in this area... so barring any unfortunate encounters with surface craft... the Americans' presence in these waters should remain undetected.
Undetected, that is, until... early on Thursday morning... when they will come within sight of the Japanese coast up here.
In the normal course of events... the Japanese would communicate this information... to their air and naval forces up here.
And within 24 hours, this convoy would be pretty much at their mercy.
Is that clear so far?
Yes, sir.
Hearne!
Tosh.
- What?
- Him.
The movements and major policy decisions of the United States Navy... may be of limited interest to you... but if you will bear with me for just a moment or two...
I think you will find that it may be worth your while to pay some attention.
- I am, sir.
- Good.
The object of our own operation is simply to prevent news... of the Americans' presence in these waters from reaching the enemy's main base.
The Japanese transmit situation reports... to their bases at Rabaul and Truk on Wednesdays and Sundays.
If we were to destroy their radio... before the transmission on Wednesday night... that is to say before the convoy comes within sight... of their coast here... we should know that at least that part of the mission had been successful.
This is where Lt. Lawson of the United States Navy comes in.
Immediately prior to Wednesday nighùs transmission... you will destroy the Japanese radio.
Lt. Lawson will use our own radio equipment... to transmit the normal, routine situation report in Japanese.
- Sir?
- Yes, Hearne, what is it?
Would the mission have to be abandoned... if Lt. Lawson met with... an unfortunate mishap?
Mishap?
Yes, I take your point... but I think iùs a little premature to talk about abandoning the operation... or of any mishap to the Lieutenant, for that matter.
- Yes, sir.
- I hope your enthusiasm isn't catching.
I hope so, too, sir.
However, if it answers your question...
Lt. Lawson's part in this operation is not, in fact, essential.
It is merely a way of gaining additional time.
Lf, for any reason, he should be unable to transmit the message... we shall still be doing a very considerable service by destroying the Japanese radio.
Yes, sir.
We've never attempted to penetrate this far into Japanese territory...
Bloody suicide mission.
Campbell.
Now's the time to shoot your other arm.
Knock it off.
Captain, I was wondering how come
Trevor didn't come that way or that way... instead of down the middle like that?
- Mines, old boy.
- Mines?
Yeah. If the Japs ever sent a sizeable force against us... that bit of jungle over there would be too close for comfort.
So we laid a mine field there... and it worked a treat for a while because it kept them out... and our patrols could come and go as they pleased.
Then one night the Japs laid a few mine fields of their own.
It cost us seven men before we discovered it.
Isn't there any other way out of this target range?
Not if you're traveling north, Lieutenant.
I don't like to seem unduly cautious, but wouldn't it be better if we left at night?
I'm sure the men would be the first to agree with you.
- Wouldn't that make more sense?
- Indeed.
But if we're to reach the enemy camp by Wednesday night... we have what you might call a rather tight schedule.
We had intended leaving last night... but unfortunately, your people were somewhat late in delivering the body.
You mean the whole operation's been hanging on me?
I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry about being late, Captain, but I wasn't driving that damn boat.
Patrol, attention!
- Carry on, please.
- Sir.
Sgt. Johnstone, stand the men at ease.
Stand at ease!
Easy.
Pay attention.
If we can get across that open ground without attracting the enemy fire... we can take it that the patrol encountered by Trevor's men has withdrawn... and we should be reasonably safe until we've penetrated into the jungle.
Sgt. Johnstone and I will lead off.
The rest of you will break up into three groups of four... which Lt. Lawson here will dispatch at intervals of 25 seconds.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Cpl. McLean... you and Signalman Scott will remain in the rear group with the Lieutenant.
Hearne, the same applies to you.
As Medical Orderly, you will be in the last group.
If there are any casualties on the way over... you will not stop to render aid to anyone... unless they are injured within 200 yards of cover.
- Is that clear, Hearne?
- Thaùs clear, sir.
Sgt. Johnstone, prepare to move the men off.
Sir!
All right, get moving.
Over to the weapon pits.
- You hear that, Connolly?
- Move along.
Don't get yourself shot till you get to the other side.
Why not?
Because Uncle Tosh won't be able to look after you, thaùs why not.
All gun pits, stand to.
Come on, leùs hurry up.
Give me three ranks!
Front rank:
Riddle, Thornton, Griffiths, Currie!
Center rank:
Rafferty, Rogers, Connolly, Campbell!
Rear rank:
Lt. Lawson, Hearne, Cpl. McLean, Scott!
Captain, what about the four guys they left out there?
If we get across safely...
I imagine they'll pick them up now.
And if we don't?
I suppose they'll pick us all up tonight.
- Sergeant.
- Sir?
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.
Right.
Off we go.
Twenty-five, twenty-four... twenty-three, twenty-two...
Get yourself out of here... before you go, I've news for you, you're on a charge.
A charge for appearing on guard duty with your boot laces undone.
...seven, six, five...
You'll be on the Hebrides line-up.
...one, all right, go.
If you go out in the woods today
You better go in disguise
If you go out in the woods today
You're in for a big surprise
Shut up!
Stupid idiot.
Thornton, whaùs the matter with you?
My heaÔs sore. I'm fair daffy.
I don't think that guy's playing with a full deck.
What do you say, sir?
I think he's lost some of his marbles.
- What marbles are they, sir?
- Cuckoo.
- Cuckoo?
...twenty-four, twenty-three...
They wouldn't let him in the army if he was cuckoo, would they, sir?
No, he's all right, old Thornton.
He's seen more soldiering than you've had hot dinners.
He's all right.
Unless, of course, he goes right off his rocker.
...seven, six...
Doesn't happen often.
...five, four...
- He's all right.
...three, two, one. Leùs go.
Twenty-five, twenty-four... twenty-three...
Don't walk in a straight line, you clowns.
Scatter, move to the left.
Come on, spread out. Use your heads.
Thaùs great, sir.
The Lieutenanùs obviously done this before.
You don't have to be the Duke of Wellington to know you don't walk in a straight line.
Thaùs absolutely right, sir.
He's right.
...seven, six, five... four, three, two...
He's right, you know.
...one. Come on.
All right, you men, back to work.
Spotted a relative, Campbell?
Up your pipe, you Cockney ponce.
Be quiet!
Iùs marvelous, this country living.
For pigs.
Look at my hands.
They look like chopped beef.
Excuse me, sir, is there something wrong with your teeth?
We call it personal hygiene.
You ought to try it sometime.
You hear that, lads?
He reckons you're all a bunch of pigs.
Cheeky bastard.
May I have a light, please, Lieutenant?
Here.
Those two are getting pretty matey, aren't they?
Why not?
Like you're always saying, iùs a matter of class.
I don't know about Snow White... but old Hornsby's got about as much class as a syphilitic road sweeper.
I really love this time of day.
- It always reminds me...
- It doesn't do much for me, I'll tell you.
I can see you're a confirmed city dweller.
My people farm, you know.
- We have this little estate in the Cotswolds.
- Is that right?
- Sgt. Johnstone.
- Sir?
- Iùs about time we moved off.
- Yes, sir.
Leùs have Riddle out in front.
All right, Riddle, up front.
Why me again? I was back marker yesterday.
Keep it down, you chaps.
Because you're so bloody lovely, thaùs why.
Now don't argue! Get up front!
- Connolly, you kick off as back marker.
- Who, me, sir?
All right, sir.
Hang on here until we've been gone a full minute.
Jap patrol, sir. Coming right down the path.
- Five of them, this way.
- Did they see you?
I don't think so.
Off the path, both sides.
Don't fire unless I do!
Captain, your field pack!
We did it!
Rogers, get your bloody head down!
Keep down, you bloody fool.
Rafferty! Rogers! Kill all those men!
Griffiths! Thornton! Pick up the rifles!
Come on, don't leave a trace.
You heard the orders. Get a move on.
Don't leave a trace. I said off the trail.
Tosh, over here.
Come on, clean it up.
Thaùs right. Get it out of the way.
- Take him up that way.
- Tosh, hurry up!
Over in the undergrowth. Thaùs right.
You'll be all right, Connolly.
Riddle, get off down the trail and keep cover.
- Come on, Riddle, double up!
- Get them off the trail.
- I think Riddle's bought it.
- Damn.
Campbell, you get on up there.
If you see any more coming... fire a warning shot and get back here on the double.
- Yes, sir.
- Move it, Campbell!
Trying to work his ticket.
Iùs what you're doing, ain't you?
Trying to work your ticket, son?
- Hearne.
- What do you want, sir?
What about these two?
Bloody idiot. Put your hand on there and keep the pressure, all right?
This one's got about five minutes.
This one will be all right if we get him back to camp.
But we're not going in that direction, are we?
No, sir.
All right, Sergeant... do we have any other casualties?
The Yank says Pvt. Riddle's dead, sir.
- Is that all?
- No, iùs not all.
Currie and Connolly.
- Both dead?
- No.
What the hell do you mean, idiot?
Can't you speak plainly?
Currie's dead!
Connolly's wounded.
Right, Sergeant, get these Japanese bodies off the trail, please.
You heard. Get these bodies off the trail.
Come on, move!
And erase those bloodstains.
Never you mind.
Hearne's taking good care of you.
Come on, Rogers, get a move on.
I hear you're something of a footballer, Connolly.
Before you know it, you'll be back home... playing for the regiment, perhaps.
I don't know whether I ever...
You shouldn't have given up smoking, Connolly.
You coulÔve had a drag now.
Get those helmets.
I got his leg.
Take him up that way, towards the right.
Scott, give us a hand.
- Don't take all day, man.
- Yes, sir.
The helmet, you damn fool!
That pretty well cleans it up, sir.
Iùs been a great day at Hampden Park, folks.
Hornsby's Hotspurs: 5...
Japanese United: 3.
All eight of them scored by Hornsby.
Whaùs he mean, all eight of them?
He means that Fairy Feet Hornsby... deployed his forces with such a masterly grasp of tactics... half of us got ourselves shot by the other bloody half.
No, it can't be.
Can't be? Go and dig the bullets out.
You won't find "Made in Japan" written on them.
All right, Sergeant, leùs be on our way.
Come on, men.
Rafferty.
Back marker.
Leùs have a bloody good cry
And always remember
Come on, move it.
The longer you live
The sooner you'll bloody well die
Look at the mourners
Bloody great hypocrites
Isn't it grand, boys
Don't you know any other songs?
Aye, a few... but at the moment, I happen to be particularly fond of this one.
I wish you'd sing us one you hate.
Campbell, has it ever occurred to you that if you had the other arm broken... you'd be needing a friend to button your fly?
Capt. Hornsby! Over here! Japs!
Where are you?
We're coming after you, you bloody little ape!
Come on, Captain, the bastarÔs getting away!
Get your blinking face here, or we'll all be done for!
Hearne!
Come on, show yourself!
Two of them coming down there, a lieutenant and a corporal.
I got the corporal. I winged the other one, too. Could be dead now.
- Where did he go?
- Disappeared in there.
Hearne, see what you can do for him.
Corporal, take some men and start combing the area.
- Four of you on the double.
- He's got to be in the jungle somewhere.
Campbell, you and Scott take a look from this tower.
See if you can spot anything from up there.
Lieutenant, you better come with me.
- Come on.
- I can't go up there.
- You and your bloody arm.
- Go on, get on with it.
Iùs a bloody mile high.
Whaùs up there, then?
Just some things for measuring the weather or something.
Iùs like the stuff we've got back at camp.
Damn you, Hearne!
Shall I bring them down?
No, leave them.
If Hornsby sees them, he'll have us lugging them all the way back to base.
Don't worry, Thorny.
Snakes love Japs.
You'll have to go to Woolworth's and buy one, I think.
We're never gonna find him in this.
Leùs get back.
It seems your friend is on his way back to Tokyo.
- Hearne.
- What?
How about it?
- Can he walk?
- No, sir.
- But, surely...
- No.
Right, give him a hand. Come on, now.
Whaùs the matter with you?
Can't you see that I can't put my foot down?
There's hundreds of these trails.
How're we ever gonna find him again on our way back?
Iùs easy.
We're gonna scatter little white pebbles through the forest... just like bloody Hansel and Gretel.
Carry on, Gunga Din.
This thing weighs a ton.
Ease him down over there.
Sorry we couldn't have the Rolls Royce for you.
Just thought you might need this.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck, Sergeant.
- Corporal.
- Sir?
There. Okay?
All done.
- Here.
- Whaùs this, then?
- Salt tablets.
- I'd rather have a smoke.
- You short, then?
- Skint.
Hearne, we've got to go.
I'll see you Saturday, okay?
Yeah. Thanks.
Not for the cigarettes though.
You owe me them.
Don't you bloody forget it.
I won't.
And don't forget to loosen the tourniquet, otherwise your bloody leg will drop off.
See you.
Enjoy your rest, Sergeant.
I reckon that makes you a Sergeant, Jock.
- Down there?
- Yes, sir.
All right. Hearne, Campbell, come with me.
Well, move yourself, Campbell.
I knew that little Nip had to be in there.
What?
- Cover me.
- All right.
They've gone. Leùs move on.
Did you hear me? There's no one here.
Leùs move on.
Look out!
Iùs not every day you get a chance to kill an officer, is it, Lieutenant?
All he had was this knife.
What did you want me to do?
Wait till he threw it at you?
No.
No! Iùs me, Campbell!
What the hell do you want?
You asked for these, sir.
You idiot. You coulÔve got yourself killed, running up like that.
Come on, leùs get moving.
Leùs go.
Where are you off to?
You're still back marker, remember?
Bugger off, you Yank bastard.
I hope you bloody crash!
- How do you know iùs a Yank, kid?
- You can smell them.
I thought all you limeys could smell was our money.
Hearne, Lieutenant, Cpl. McLean, come with me.
Keep them here a moment.
Rogers.
Can you see him?
Where the hell is he?
You might say he's all around here.
As a matter of fact, you might even say he's got us surrounded.
Thaùs right, Lieutenant. The bloody Yanks are bombing us with old Army boots.
Land mine.
The damn fool shoulÔve known better.
Here, look at this.
Iùs a Chinese railway station, crabs and all.
Thornton, away in and find out what time is the next train to Glasgow.
"Next train to Glasgow."
Whaùs going on up there?
For GoÔs sake, keep quiet. Keep moving!
Corporal, send in two men to see if there's anyone in there.
Thornton, over there on the left.
Rafferty, over there on the right.
They kind of move sideways.
Must be Oriental crabs.
Lieutenant, will you join me?
They'll ruin your married life, won't they?
Here, give them a peck, Campbell.
A man ought to be close to his family.
Shut your trap.
All clear on the ground floor, sir.
Rafferty's up top.
Keep them things away from me.
Campbell, get rid of the crabs.
Why me, you dafty queer?
- That kid that got it back there...
- Rogers?
Yeah, Rogers.
Do you think he ever had time to get himself laid?
Couldn't tell you.
Not my department really, is it?
I may be screwed up in a lot of ways... but getting killed like one of these poor kids isn't gonna be one of them.
Thaùs what you say now.
But I'm sure when it comes to the point, you'll be one of the first over the top.
Over the top?
I mean, you'll turn out to be a real fire-eater.
You wanna bet?
I'll give you 8-to-5.
And loan you the money.
You never get rid of those with blue ointment, kids?
Time to relieve Griffiths, mate.
Iùs your sentry go. Griffiths, back there.
Takes a bloody bomb to wake him up.
An earthquake's more like it.
Here, Tosh, give us a light.
What the hell are you doing?
- Where'd you get these cigarettes?
- Whaùs that to you?
- You stole them from Johnno, didn't you?
- Don't be bloody daft!
Where'd the blood come from then?
You did, you bastard, you stole them!
He's got no use for them now.
Whaùs the matter?
- They're mine, thaùs what!
- Piss off!
- Don't "piss off!" me!
- Campbell, stop it.
Get out, Tosh! Thaùs it. Out!
Cut it out, Tosh.
Whaùs the meaning of this disgusting exhibition?
I'll kill him!
He kicked me, sir. Iùs my arm, sir.
He kicked my arm.
Kick his arm?
I'll jam it down his bloody throat!
I gave Sgt. Johnstone these cigarettes.
Shut up, Hearne. Nobody's talking to you.
- I'm bloody well talking to you, aren't I?
- What did you say?
I said that he stole these cigarettes...
I'm not interested in your grubby little cigarettes.
You bloody well should be!
Cpl. McLean, put this man on a charge.
Leùs have no more of this nonsense.
Where does he think he is, bloody Aldershot?
Hearne, it seems you're not going to be satisfied... until you've talked yourself into some really serious trouble.
- Is that what you want?
- All I want is to get out of here.
If you had any sense, you'd know we shoulÔve turned back a long time ago.
Thank you.
Have you anything to add to that?
Yes, I have, sir.
Your last patrol was a bloody shambles.
Getting this one shot up the ass isn't gonna win you any medals.
So why don't you go home like a good boy before you get the lot of us killed?
I don't know about you, but I have better things to do!
Thank you. I shall cherish that bit of advice.
Corporal, this man is under open arrest.
When you get back to camp, you will prepare charges for a field courts-martial.
Are you satisfied, Hearne?
Easy. Watch yourself, laddie.
That wee man's near daft enough to have you shot.
All right, Corporal, prepare to move off in five minutes.
Sir.
Rafferty, go and get Griffiths.
All right, front marker, move out.
It seems some of the men have just as little enthusiasm for their duties as you do.
Maybe they didn't volunteer for the assignment either.
No, they didn't.
Since this entire operation was for the benefit of the United States Navy... they probably find the object of the exercise extremely remote.
Furthermore, they're just as anxious to get home as you are.
Is that what you're gonna do now?
Go home?
Fact is, it doesn't matter how you feel about something before the event.
You may very well feel iùs a waste of time.
For all I care, you could be a long-haired conscientious objector.
In that case, you should have had the guts to say so in the first place.
Is that right?
The fact remains, that once you're involved... you have a certain responsibility to the people around you.
They depend on you.
And thaùs something that none of your sophisticated arguments can get around.
Do you understand what I mean?
Yeah, I hear you talking.
But you still haven't answered my question.
Scott!
Yes, sir.
All right, Corporal, move the men out.
...otherwise you'll wake up
Snow White and the Fairy Prince.
Don't talk so daft.
I just wanna get home like the rest of you.
Why don't we do that?
Why don't we all just bugger off home?
We could always say... that old Fairy Feet and Snow White got lost.
Think. In six months' time... the Japs will still be sitting in this part of the jungle... and we will still be sitting in our part of the jungle... and none of this will have made a blind bit of difference.
You're joking, ain't you?
Thaùs right, Scottie.
I'm always joking.
All right, this is it.
Who gets to stay up?
And we'll separate at this fork in the trail here.
I shall take Lt. Lawson, Hearne and Scott to deal with the radio shack.
Cpl. McLean will lead the rest of you... to the southern section where the barracks are concentrated.
Your job will be purely a diversionary one.
As far as we can see, there's only one radio operator.
Ideally, we would put him out of commission just before midnight... and then keep quiet until the Lieutenant... has sent his message on our own transmitter.
If all goes well, we'll destroy their transmitter immediately after midnight... and pull back without calling for any help from your people.
All right, leùs be on our way.
Remember, any disturbance you hear before midnight... will require diversionary action from you.
If you hear nothing after the one big explosion... you can pull back without revealing your position.
- Right?
- Right, sir.
Lieutenant, will you lead off, please?
Leùs go, Scott.
Good luck.
Let us have you.
Come on, we've just got 15 minutes.
Get your fingers out!
I'm coming.
And remember, be quiet.
Sir.
Tosh!
Hearne, you stupid idiot!
- How is it?
- I'm just looking, sir.
Come on.
Oh, God, please. No.
How about it?
Iùs useless, sir.
There's at least three valves smashed.
- Valves?
- "Tubes" to you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Hearne, you bastard!
You did that deliberately.
No, I didn't, Mr. Hornsby.
You'll address me properly, do you hear?
Do you hear?
Yes, I hear you, sir... and so will the Japs, if you don't keep your bloody voice down.
I'm very sorry, sir, but there was nothing I could do.
Dump that thing in the bushes!
We're late already. Out of my way.
- Any spares?
- No.
Go on.
Down there, under the hut.
Hurry.
They got a bleeding generator grinding away.
Lights on all over the place.
Not expecting visitors, are they?
Spread out. Take cover.
Leùs not wake them up.
You gonna use grenades, Captain?
May not be too easy.
Might bounce against those screens.
Yeah. I suppose they might.
- Scott.
- Sir?
Do you think, I mean, given a chance... that you could operate the kind of transmitter they've got in there?
I'll have to have a look at it, but iùs probably basically the same thing.
Good. I think we might give it a try.
Give what a try?
If the three of us could get in there unnoticed...
I could dispose of him... and you two could send back our fake message on their transmitter.
Rather a nice touch of irony, don't you think?
Whaùre you trying to pull, Captain?
That wasn't in our orders.
No, Lieutenant. Iùs evident that one of us has to get in there in any case... to make sure of destroying their transmitter.
So why not go the whole hog?
Our orders were damn plain, Captain.
We were to send the message on our transmitter.
If that didn't work out, we were to destroy theirs.
But nobody said a damn thing...
Do be quiet. I'm going over there to deal with the operator.
When you see me come back to the window, you and Scott will join me.
We'll send our message, destroy their transmitter, and leave.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
No, sir. I'm having no part of it, Captain.
You're disobeying orders and going beyond your authority.
You'll do as you're told.
What about that sentry, sir?
Keep him covered, but don't shoot unless he does.
- Not even if he sees me.
- Even if he sees you?
I'm going to walk straight across there.
Even if he does see me, he's quite likely to assume I'm one of his chaps.
- Sir.
- What is it?
You'd look a lot less English without that hat on.
Captain! I'm telling you now.
You're going against
Col. Thompson's orders.
If you go in there, I'm not going with you.
You hear me?
I haven't got time to argue, Lieutenant.
You know what you have to do.
There he is.
Whaùs the matter?
You heard me tell him
I'm not going in there.
We're running out of time.
Whaùs the matter with you?
I told him.
Come on, Scott. Leùs go!
- Are you ready to transmit yet?
- I think so, sir.
- Where the devil's the Lieutenant?
- I don't know, sir.
Lawson!
I told him.
I know you did.
But they're in there now, waiting for you.
Go on, get moving!
Come on, move!
Where's the Lieutenant?
How the hell should I know?
I haven't seen him. Have you?
Of course I haven't.
Then leùs go.
I don't know.
You can please yourself, what you do.
I'm off.
I'm not waiting around for that rubbish sack.
Coming in, Hearne.
Whaùre you doing? You're supposed to be gone three minutes ago.
Yes, sir. I was only waiting for you because I thought you...
Blimey.
This is a turn-up for the book.
Oh, God, looks like the whole Japanese Air Force out there.
Look at that.
Like the swing shift at Lockheed.
I don't believe it.
Three rousing, great cheers for American Air Reconnaissance.
Leùs get the hell out of here. Come on.
Get me out of here!
Whaùre you stopping for?
- Which way?
- To the right, go around.
- Come on.
- Go around.
To the right, come on!
Give us covering fire, Thornton.
- Whaùs that?
- Scatter.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
This is Major Yamaguchi...
who has the pleasure of addressing you.
No doubt you are quite amazed to hear my voice.
In order to be sure... that you are hearing me...
I was obliged to make this speech five times today.
But tomorrow, as we close in on you...
you will hear only four such speeches.
On Saturday... if you have not already been killed or captured...
only two.
Captured?
If you look at your map, you will see... that as you travel south... towards your base... your situation is like that of water...
in a funnel.
Whaùs he on about?
Do you understand?
Like water in a funnel.
No matter where you may now be, or which route you take... you will eventually wish to emerge at your base.
As the funnel narrows...
as you get closer to home...
we will have less and less area to cover...
in our search for you.
We have found your abandoned radio transmitter.
We know our air power in this area...
came as a surprise to you...
and you must communicate this information to your base.
But this will not happen.
Within three days... you will all be killed or captured.
There is, however, an alternative.
You should consider it carefully.
If you will all surrender now...
just one week from today, by which time...
your plans and ours will be an open secret...
you will be released...
and allowed to return to your own base.
This offer is a reasonable one.
Certainly you should consider it carefully.
But, remember, it must be all of you.
There can be no exceptions.
I shall speak to you again tomorrow, by which time...
I hope that good sense will have prevailed.
If you wish to take advantage of our offer... you will fire a single shot as a signal.
Up your khyber.
That is all. Good day, gentlemen.
And good day to you, you malignant yellow dwarf.
They must be right behind us.
If that amplification's strong enough, they could be a helluva long way.
What do you think, sir?
About what?
It seems like they're on to us.
Do you think they mean what they're saying?
Don't be bloody stupid.
He did say they'd treat us all right.
They'll chop your bloody head off.
Since when have you been an expert?
What do you know about it, bigmouth?
A sight more than you do, pig face.
I saw what they did in the hospital in Singapore.
You were so busy running you never even saw a Jap... let alone what they did to our lads.
They won't take us to a rest camp now that we know where that airstrip is.
He's right.
- Damn right. Now leùs get out of here.
- Okay, come on.
All right, move out.
All right, get some sleep.
God, I'm tired.
Got to sleep.
Got to.
Good morning, gentlemen.
This is Saturday.
And the funnel in which you are trapped is rapidly narrowing.
I anticipated that you'd accept my terms.
Instead, you evidently marched... throughout the day, and, perhaps, most of the night.
A remarkable effort.
Your leader must be a man of great determination.
You have very little reason to be pleased with him... because his stubborn determination...
has inspired me... to alter the terms of our offer.
This offer now has a time limit.
You have until sundown to surrender.
After that, you will be killed on sight.
In war, one must take harsh measures.
I'm sorry if you do not like these new rules... but the responsibility rests with your leader.
Remember, you have only to fire a single shot.
But please remember also... that any surrender must include all of you.
You understand? All of you.
I will give you a few minutes to consider your decision.
How about it now, Lieutenant?
What? Quit?
No way.
They're not getting their hands on me.
This time tomorrow,
I'll be back at that camp.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Even the Jap said it was all your fault.
I think we should turn in.
- What do you say, Thornton?
- Look, mate...
I couldn't give a bugger about the Yank's reasons for wanting to carry on... because I happen to know they're half-baked anyway.
And if you want to believe that Jap, you can, but they're not gonna get me.
I'd sooner shoot you than trust them.
As a matter of fact... much sooner.
How do you know the Japs are lying?
What makes you think they're all that different from us?
Thaùs right, kid, they're not.
Thaùs why that Jap Major could be lying, just like I would.
You remain indecisive.
I am sorry.
Perhaps when you have rested...
you will feel different.
But the conditions remain the same.
You have until dusk to give yourselves up.
That is all.
I knew it. He wants to draw our fire and kill us all.
How do you know thaùs what he said?
Wanna wait a couple of minutes?
They'll be here.
- In that case, now's the time to pack it in.
- Watch it, darling.
They're coming.
- Clear that place.
- Get down!
Knife.
Come on, leùs get out of here.
Get him out of there. Quick, damn it.
- Come on, you guys, give us a hand.
- Get him out of there.
- Griffiths, get my pack.
- Yes, sir.
- McLean!
- Yes, sir?
Get behind him.
Pick him up and get him up the hill.
Come on.
Move down.
- He can't move.
- Come on.
Quick, hurry up.
Come on, damn it.
Move your ass! Come on!
- Move!
- Thaùs the way.
I'll lead them off up here.
Thaùs the way.
Day and night, service is on hand, sir.
Come on, boys.
Don't drop him now.
Watch out for those man-eating trout.
Easy.
You weigh a bleeding ton.
Thaùs it.
Easy, Thorny.
Tosh, my old buddy, how does it look back there?
Iùs not so bad.
You'll be all right.
What kind of nonsense is that, man?
I can feel where the scorching thing went in, and I can't feel where it came out.
Yeah, you are leaking a bit.
Hold up!
That makes your eyes water, doesn't it?
- Is that tight enough?
- Yeah.
Right, now put your little pinkie on the knot. Thaùs right.
Very pretty.
I'm ready for my coming-out ball.
You'll get "coming out" in a minute.
Take your finger away when I say, "Go."
Ready, steady, go.
There we are. I shouldn't worry about it.
No, you shouldn't, but maybe I should?
That bloody Yankee poonagger's not coming back.
Thaùs all right.
Thornton's not going anywhere, are you, Jock?
No, I'm having my change of life.
- Can he walk?
- Only on the water.
Yeah.
Thaùs it then.
Do you hear that, lads?
If anyone's going mad...
We've either got to leave him here or turn ourselves in, right?
I already told you, nobody's turning it in.
What are you gonna do with him?
You can't bloody carry him back, can you?
You're so bloody clever, Hearne.
What are you gonna do with him?
Listen, you poxed-up Glaswegian queer!
Iùs bad enough sitting here full of bloody holes... without listening to you open your ugly face!
Knock it off.
I can hear you halfway down the trail.
- Whaùs the matter with you guys, anyway?
- Iùs Thornton, sir.
He can't walk.
I was just saying we've either gotta leave him here or turn ourselves in.
Now, suppose you let me worry about that?
Meanwhile, you just rest your toes because we're leaving before dark.
- Back in a minute, Thorny.
- Thanks, Tosh.
That blooÔs worth bottling.
Look at that pair.
I see Snow White's found his first dwarf.
A right teddy bear's picnic this has turned out to be.
- How long has Thornton got?
- I don't know.
But he won't be here next week, thaùs for certain.
Where are you going?
Where are you off?
You know what that Yank's gonna do, don't you?
- What?
- He's not leaving you here alive.
He'd sooner kill you himself.
- Kill me?
- Why shouldn't he?
All he cares about is getting back to the camp.
He doesn't give a bugger about you.
I heard him say so.
Go to hell.
The only thing to do to get you out of here safely... to see you're looked after, is to turn ourselves in.
I'll go with McLean and Griffiths and talk to the Japs.
You try that and I'll shoot you myself.
Don't be daft, man.
- What else is there?
- You cowardly pig.
You just want to save your own skin, you hear me?
Now look here, Thornton.
For GoÔs sake, man... can't you even leave a fellow in peace?
I'm sorry.
I really am.
I was only thinking of you.
Come on, take a wee drop of water.
Come on, now.
I'll hold it up for you. Come on, drink it now.
McLean! Quickly! Wake up!
Wake up! Thornton's had it!
There's no telling what the Yank will do now.
What is it?
Come on, wake up.
- Whaùs the matter?
- Thornton's dead. Come on!
- What about Tosh?
- Leave him.
You can't leave Tosh.
Once we get to the Japs, we'll all be all right. Him as well.
Wake up!
Wake up, you stupid bastard!
Where the hell are they?
How the bloody hell do I know?
You're the one who's supposed to be on guard.
Stupid, dirty bastards!
- You going after them?
- No, iùs too late.
They're probably closer to the Japs than we are.
The only way they'll stay alive is by telling that Jap Major where we are.
Come on, leùs go.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
From what your comrades have told me...
I may assume that you are now hearing me.
As you must know... your comrades decided to try and save their lives... by surrendering and informing us of your position.
But you escaped... and so their fate is still in doubt.
Their surrender is of little value unless you choose to join them.
If you will surrender before dark...
I shall keep my word.
You will be well treated...
and released in only a few days.
The man, Campbell, did not merit such good treatment.
He was found to be carrying the personal effects of one of our officers... our Communications Lieutenant... who has been missing since last Tuesday.
His body was discovered yesterday.
Our Lieutenant was very popular with his men.
You would understand that there was little I could do to restrain them... even if I had wanted to.
It has been an incident in which none of us can take pride.
However, the real problem still remains.
You must decide what you want done with the two comrades...
who are still our prisoners.
It is for you to say if they shall live.
If you wish to stay alive... you must persuade your two friends to surrender. Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
You may talk to them.
Lieutenant? Tosh?
Iùs me, McLean.
Iùs right, what the Major was saying.
About Campbell, I mean.
They showed us the stuff he stole from the officer... and how he chopped his finger off to get the ring.
There wasn't anything anyone coulÔve done to stop them.
But we're all right.
It is necessary for you to persuade them.
I know we shouldn't have gone off with Campbell like we did.
And I know we shouldn't have told them where you were hiding... but it was Campbell's idea, and we thought it was for the best.
Listen, if you don't give yourselves up now... we'll be the ones who end up paying for it.
Your Corporal is giving you excellent advice.
There is no longer a choice for any of you.
Either you surrender and live...
or if you attempt to postpone the inevitable... then I shall withdraw my offer... and your two comrades will die tonight.
The decision is yours.
You have until nightfall to decide.
Please, Lieutenant... do like he says.
Tosh, please!
I couldn't care less what they do to those two.
Whatever that Jap's gonna do, he's gonna do.
Iùs got nothing to do with what we're gonna do.
If you mean it ain't gonna make us surrender...
I'm with you.
But if you think we're gonna try and get back to camp by tomorrow... you must be bloody mad.
Thaùs exactly what we're gonna do.
We hit that clearing on the edge of that camp... if there are two of us... we're gonna have twice as much a chance of getting through.
And, buddy boy... you're going with me every step of the way.
Listen, Lieutenant... neither of us wants to get killed, right?
I've never believed any of the guff that Jap's been giving us, either.
I know once he lays his hands on us... he'll finish us off, no matter what he says.
So, up until now... the only way of staying alive was getting back to camp.
But now there's another way.
Something that nobody else thought of.
Nobody except me, that is.
- What?
- Iùs very simple.
We double back, head north for two or three hours... duck off the trail, sleep for a couple of days... and we'll be laughing.
- Laughing?
- Yeah, laughing.
Because once the Jap dive bombers... get stuck into the Yank ships
Monday morning... the Jap Major won't be looking for us anymore.
Right?
He couldn't care less where we are then.
We can just lie low for a couple of days... stroll back into camp... and nobody will say a dickie bird.
Whaùs so bad about that?
I never asked those idiots to send me out here.
But if I ever get back, iùll be:
"Well done, Hearne.
"Jolly good show.
"Now you can piss off home...
"back to whatever dirty little hole you came from."
And what are they gonna do for you, Lieutenant?
Make you the bloody President?
No.
Getting ourselves killed... isn't going to make any difference to anybody except us.
Look, Yank... the last thing that Jap Major is gonna be looking for... is us heading north.
So what do you say?
You got any idea how many guys will get killed on those ships... if we haven't got the guts to try and stop them?
Okay, so a couple of hundred Yanks will get the chop.
- They shouldn't have joined, should they?
- Hundreds?
Thousands.
In any case, iùs not the bloody Yanks you're worried about... because if their chances depend on us getting back... they've just about had it in the first place.
No, whaùs got you jumping about like a frog with a bullet up its ass... is old Fairy Feet Hornsby... because you reckon you let him down.
And thaùs the one bloody time you've been right.
You did.
You might just as well have killed him yourself.
But getting us killed isn't gonna make up for that.
So Hornsby is your problem.
And those Yank sailors are your problem.
And if you wanna start playing bloody heroes...
I've got another problem for you.
I'm not bloody well coming with you.
You forgot your problem.
Me.
I told you before... one of us has gotta get back there alive.
And if you don't go with me,
I'll have to leave you here.
Dead.
Understood?
Understood.
Just don't forget.
Gentlemen, your time is up!
I shall give you 30 seconds.
If you do not give yourselves up...
I shall be forced to execute your two comrades.
Let me talk to him.
Listen to me, Lieutenant, please.
You've gotta listen to me.
They're gonna kill us.
Just like they killed Campbell.
Please, Lieutenant, don't let them do it.
Do you really find it so easy to believe that I would shoot you?
Keep going.
Get up.
There's not much further to go.
How the hell would you know?
There can't be.
No more, thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Get up, you limey son of a bitch, or I'll kick your head in!
Get up.
Good morning, again.
You must be very tired.
You have come a long way during the night.
A truly remarkable effort.
Remarkable, but to very little purpose.
Shut up, you slimy yellow nob.
You have moved fast...
but we have moved faster.
You will find that you are now very near the open field... that serves as a perimeter to your base.
But some of my men are already on that perimeter.
In short, you are now totally surrounded.
You are now at the very tip of the funnel
I have talked about so often.
I can understand your determination...
but to give up your lives for an objective...
which cannot be won is a foolish waste.
You have shown yourselves to be brave soldiers.
It shows us that you are intelligent ones also.
Give yourselves up and live.
I assure you, the medals they give to dead heroes are made of brass.
All they do is add weight to your coffin.
You bloody idiot!
Believe me...
your situation is truly hopeless.
All trails leading back into the jungle are under guard.
This means... that you can no longer hide... you can no longer double back on your tracks.
Whaùs that all about?
Better get the Sergeant Major.
I shall give you three minutes during which time... you will wish to confirm for yourselves... that what I have said is true.
At the end of that time... you must either surrender or die.
You will fire a single shot to indicate that you have surrendered.
Or my men will close in and kill.
Stand to!
- What is it?
- Don't know what it is, Sergeant Major.
Get Col. Thompson! Double!
- Get the Color Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant Major.
What the hell is it?
- What is it, Sergeant Major?
- I don't know what it is.
I've sent for the old man.
- You better man the weapon pits.
- Right.
Come on, leùs have you fast now!
What do you think this is,
Kensington Gardens? Come on!
- Get in with that gun!
- Get in there.
Make sure the men stay back, Sergeant.
You men know the drill!
Keep back!
Stay out of enemy range!
Laid on!
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, Sergeant Major.
- Everything in order?
- Yes, sir.
- Mortars?
- All weapon pits are manned, sir.
Sounds like loudspeakers of some kind.
Got any more bright suggestions?
My patience is growing very short.
He must think we've still got a chance.
- Who must?
- Guchi.
Why are they giving us three minutes?
Why don't they just come and get us?
Yeah.
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe they're spread too thin.
Maybe they're afraid to come in, for fear of chasing us out in the open.
Yeah, and having to waste all those bullets to shoot us?
Maybe.
But there's still two of us... and one of us just might make it.
You now have only two and a half more minutes.
We could sure use some covering fire.
- Think your guys will be doing anything?
- Yeah.
Having breakfast.
We could use all the help we can get.
Maybe if we fire that shot...
- Why waste a bullet?
- What do you mean?
Fire one shot and maybe we'll confuse the Japs a bit.
But if we could kill their Major... they wouldn't have anyone to tell them what to do.
They'd be running about all over the place.
Might give us a head start.
And that little bastarÔs been asking for it for a long time, hasn't he?
This way.
Two minutes.
You now have only one and a half more minutes, gentlemen.
- Stand them to, Sergeant.
- All guns stand to!
The rest of you keep back!
Out of enemy range!
It worked.
They've gone back.
Don't forget to zigzag.
You zig, I'll zag.
Look there!
There they are!
Can you make out which ones they are?
Lay down covering fire, Sergeant! Hurry!
Give those men covering fire!
Correct right, Sergeant!
Three turns more right!
More left!
Come on!
- He's all right.
- He's alive.
- He's getting up.
- He's alive!
Cease fire!
All guns cease fire!
Machine gunners, stand by to give us covering fire!
Take it easy, lad.
Were there any other survivors?
Was it just the two of you?
Who was that with you out there?
I said... who was that with you out there?
Out there... he was a bloody hero.
He killed... fifteen bleeding Japs... single-handed.
Killed fifteen?
Thirty, if you like.
When the Second World War was over, we were the one great power in the world.
The Soviets had a substantial military machine, but they could not touch us in power.
We had this enormous force that had been built up.
We had the greatest fleet in the world.
We'd come through the war economically sound.
And I think that, in addition to feeling a sense of responsibility, we also began to feel... the-the sense of a world power, that possibly we could control the future of the world.
Our vision of progress is not limited to our own country.
We extend it to all the peoples of the world.
Military action in Indochina.
French regulars land along the coast in search of roving communist bands.
For France, it represents a tremendous sacrifice... of manpower and financial resources.
Without American help, the burden would be too great.
I do not expect that there is going to be a communist victory in Indochina.
I affirm that Secretary Dulles... offered me two atomic bombs.
Two, uh...
Neither one, neither three. Two.
If Indochina goes, several things happen right away.
The Accra Peninsula, the little bit of end hanging on down there... would be scarcely defensible.
The tin and the tungsten... that we so greatly value from that area would cease coming.
We don't see the end of the tunnel, but, uh, I must say...
I don't think it's darker than it was a year ago, in some ways lighter. Yes?
So we must be ready to fight in Vietnam, but the ultimate victory will depend upon the hearts... and the minds of the people who actually live out there.
Throughout the war in Vietnam, the United States has exercised a degree of restraint... unprecedented in the annals of war.
There was just one thing, one small word that enabled myself and my buddies... to stay alive those many years.
That one thing was faith.
Faith in my family, my God and my country.
I remembered high school.
I remembered playing sports there.
And I can remember my coach saying...
"When the going gets tough, the tough get going, because winners never quit and quitters never win."
Why did I go to Vietnam?
I will have to go back to 1965, when I was 22 years old.
At that time, communism was once again trying to muscle its way... into a free country.
That would assert that there's a majority of people in that country... that want to be communist.
Why do they need us then?
Because they were subjected to, uh, military attack from outside.
Uh, the, uh...
Are you really asking me this goddamn silly question?
- You really want me to go into this?
- Yes.
I mean... I mean, you know, we really got to go back to...
You just want me to go back to the origins of this thing then.
All right, I'll do it, but this is pretty pedestrian stuff, I must say, at this late stage of the game.
Honestly it is.
I'll do it. All right.
- There's disagreement about the origins.
- No, there's not.
No, there's not. There's no doubt.
All right, I'll answer your question, you can throw away that tape.
I didn't expect to have to go back to this kind of sophomoric stuff, but I'll do it.
The problem, uh, began, uh, in its present phase, after the Sputnik, the launch of the Sputnik in 1957, October.
This opened a phase of not well-coordinated, but universally optimistic and hopeful communist enterprise... in many parts of the world.
Renewed hostile actions... against United States ships on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin... have today required me to order military forces of the United States... to take action in reply.
We always hesitate in public to use the word "lie" but a lie is a lie.
I mean, it's a misrepresentation of fact.
And it's supposed to be a criminal act if its done under oath.
Mr. Johnson didn't say it under oath, he just said it.
We don't usually have the president under oath.
There are those who ask why this responsibility should be ours.
The answer, I think, is simple.
There is no one else who can do the job.
If necessary,
I am ready to go back.
We all must be ready.
You must have the political, economic and philosophical courage to send me... or do whatever you think is necessary.
I must be ready to go.
If I did well, it is only because Linden did well in bringing me up... and making me into a man.
If I served the military well, it is only because the military trained me to be a good officer.
If I am a good American, it is only because America brought me up to be a good American.
- Three, two, one...
It was a sight to touch the heart of the most callous.
Lieutenant George Coker was back in
Linden, New Jersey, the hero of the day.
Three thousand people turned out to greet him. Schools were closed... and streets were blocked as the young former prisoner of war... walked on a red carpet to the steps of city hall.
Mike is still open. Two, one...
I'm from Duncan, Oklahoma, which is about 90 miles south of here.
And, uh, and I lived around several places... uh, Missouri, Chicago,
Detroit, uh, Germany,
Uh... by the time I got out of high school, I was very conservative.
We have, in Duncan high school... we bought... the high school had bought a, uh...
Excuse me... a John Birch package on communism.
So we studied communism via the John Birch Society, the big red map with the flowing out of the disease and so forth, and-and learned how Karl Marx was a very cruel man... and used to, uh, make his family suffer and so forth.
Uh, so when I got out of high school,
I thought basically that, um,
Teddy Roosevelt's what this country needed, and F.D.R. had kind of sold us down the drain to the commies.
The communist conspiracy is a deliberate and predictable plan of action... to subvert the world.
Mosinee, Wisconsin, in a unique Mayday object lesson, shows what could happen here if communism took over.
The unyielding chief of police is liquidated by American Legionnaires... portraying Red trigger men.
A grim demonstration of what subversion could lead to,
Mosinee's Mayday serves as a sharp warning to all democratic communities.
It's an international, criminal conspiracy.
Before we know it, we're gonna turn our backs around someday, the whole United States, we're gonna turn around and see nothing but V. C... or not V.C., but communism... we're gonna turn around and say, "What happened?"
People just walking in with riots, drugs, you name it.
They're tearing us down from the inside out.
In 1917, when the communists overthrew the Russian government, there was 1 communist for every 2,277 persons... in Russia.
In the United States today, there is one communist... for every 1,814 persons in this country.
If we lose Indochina, Mr. Jenkins, we will lose the Pacific, and we'll be an island in a communist sea.
- Go ahead, how does it go?
- Oh, mother.
I swear that I am not now... or ever have been a member of the communist party.
Feel better?
Of course, when it gets down to communism, uh,
I've been fighting communism since 1951, actually.
I was looked at, you know, the American fighting man, as being, uh, you know, like a warrior of sorts, you know, due to my background, the way my mother brought me up.
She always spoke of the warrior societies of our tribe... and of the different tribes around us and how that these men... always had to work to gain the respect of the people around them... and how they had to live, uh, more or less a life dictated to them... by the society that they belonged to, and it was extremely hard.
I-I looked around and from listening to my uncles and a lot of my relations... they had been in the Marine Corps... and they always told me that... the Marine Corps was the hardest service to cope with physically and mentally.
And I naturally wanted to be the best at that time, and I looked at the Marine Corps as being the elite of the elite, the warrior society in the United States.
Now it might sound cliché-ish to say that,
"My country, may it always be right, but right or wrong, my country."
But that's how I felt back in '67.
And during my senior year,
I said I've got an obligation to serve.
I've got to fulfill it.
There's no reason physically why I would be exempted, and therefore, I'm gonna enlist.
- What you got there?
- Picture.
Picture? How much picture?
- Three thousand?
- I go beaucoup hungry. I sell 3,000.
- You go here, too much money.
- I buy watch for 1,500.
No, you sell to me?
You lie. You lie, you die.
- You give massage? What else you give?
- Yes.
Huh?
- I buy you one beer, okay?
- You-You buy me one beer?
No, no. No money.
Go home, mama-san.
Please, go home, mama-san.
No. Go home, mama-san.
No. Go home, mama-san.
Okay? No. Go home, mama-san.
- You will like.
- No. No.
Huh?
- How much?
- One thousand.
You? Ah, it's too much. Beaucoup.
Yeah, for sure. No, no good.
We thought of ourselves, I think, as trying to defeat communists.
Defeat... Accepting a view of, uh... the Walt Rostow kind of view... of covert aggression of some kind.
The kind of view that enabled you to think of the conflict... in, really, World War II terms.
That was an unquestioned assumption.
It had an idealistic flavor to it, but it was the underpinning of an imperial policy, basically.
I shared the assumption, very easily, and felt it as an idealistic one really.
We were doing something for them.
I recall that I was in the
New York area at the time, and I stopped by to see General MacArthur, who I had known for several years.
Uh, when he greeted me, he made, uh, quite a prophetic statement.
He said, "Westmoreland,
I-I see you have a new job."
He said, "I hope you appreciate that this new assignment... is filled with opportunities, but fraught with hazards."
And indeed, uh, this was a prophetic statement.
It can be described much like, uh... a-a-a singer doing an aria... that's totally into what he's doing, you know, totally feeling it.
He knows the aria, and he's experiencing the aria.
And he knows his limits, and he knows whether he's doing it and doing it well.
Flying an aircraft can be a great deal like that.
What's a race driver feel like?
Why does a guy want to drive in the Indianapolis 500?
I guess, perhaps, the risk of dying, being killed is part of it that makes it thrilling.
I can tell when the aircraft feels right, when it's about to stall.
I can tell when I cant pull another fraction of a pound... or the airplane will stall, flip out and spin on me.
I would follow a pathway on something like a TV screen in front of me... that would direct me right, left or center... follow the steering, keep the steering symbol, uh, centered.
I'd see a little attack light when we'd stepped into attack.
I could pull the "commit" switch on my stick, and the computer took over.
A computer figured out the ballistics, the airspeed, the slant range... and dropped the bombs when we got to the appropriate point, in whichever kind of attack we'd selected, whether it was flying straight and level or tossing our bombs out.
So it was very much of a technical expertise thing.
I was a good pilot, you know.
I had, uh, uh,
I had a lot of pride in my ability to fly.
You're up there doing something that, uh, mankind has only dreamed of; the flying, especially at night, in an aircraft.
The A-6 is one of the few that can really do it the way we did it.
Um, a World War II aviator would not even dream of doing the things we did.
It's definitely the ultimate in aviation.
Almost everybody has blown off firecrackers.
The thrill you get when you see something explode as a child, or even as an adult almost.
You put something in the can and watch the can blow up in the air.
And the excitement, the sense of excitement, especially if you're getting shot at, is just incredible.
You get there, have a real good mission, hit your target, find out later your target was totally destroyed, that it wasn't one of these misses or almost, you got it.
And come back and make a night carrier landing recovery. Uh, that's fantastic.
To say it's thrilling, yes, it's deeply satisfying.
The planes again.
Are they American or Vietnamese?
I don't know whose they are. Just airplanes.
What was this here?
I used to raise pigs here, right there.
Where was the kitchen?
The kitchen was here.
They built it with bricks.
This was the floor.
And this was for the heat.
What's that?
That is the bomb crater.
The bombs dropped there and destroyed everything I had.
An older sister died, and I've another older sister left.
Yes, there were just the three of us.
But then one died.
And I'm supposed to live in a house over there.
But now it's just a heap of rubble.
How old was your sister?
Seventy-eight.
What did she die of?
Bombs. Bombs were dropped here the other day, and they killed her.
I'm so unhappy.
My sister died and I've got no home left.
I've moved in with my sister here.
I've been wounded.
I can't do anything for a living now.
I'm old and weak.
I've got nothing to sell.
Nothing to do.
Mm.
You really just don't have time for personal thoughts... when you're up there flying around at 500, 600 miles an hours.
You might call it an electronic war in a certain way.
I didn't have time to think about anything else.
If you wanted to later, you might.
But it was all business.
It's, um, just strictly professionalism.
We had a job to do and we did it.
Never could see the people.
You never could see...
Occasionally you saw the houses when you were bombing around a village... or bombing in a village.
Uh, you never heard the explosion.
You never saw any blood or any screams.
It was very clean.
You're doing a job.
You're an expert at what you do.
I was a technician.
Everything just collapsed under the bombs.
Everything just caved in.
It's like a bird and its nest.
The way things are with the house in the rubble, the bird comes home and finds no nest.
Where am I to find a place to sit and work for something to eat?
Even a bird needs a nest it can go back to, crawl into for sleep and food.
Look, they're focusing on us now.
First they bomb as much as they please, then they film.
We fought against the
Chinese for 12 centuries.
We fought against the French for 100 years.
And finally, when the war was lost by the French in 1954... at the battle of Dien Bien Phu, the Vietnamese were liberated from foreign oppression.
But it was at that precise moment that the Americans came to Vietnam.
Little by little at first.
Then more and more as an invasion, an invasion of the American army.
Five hundred thousand of them in Vietnam.
And this war became a war of genocide.
The people of North Vietnam and South Vietnam... fight only for freedom, independence and national unity.
This war is a war against the American imperialists.
This is our war for independence.
What we are trying to put across this afternoon is to get you to realize... that these weren't mythical, hazy people from the past.
These were very real people.
When they rose up against the most powerful army in the world, they were actually putting everything on the line that they had:
Their homes, their wealth, their past and their future.
That all men are created equal.
That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
And when you judge the Revolution and the problems and the success we had, it was a two-way street.
A good many citizens at the time of the Revolution... actually stayed and fought with the British.
It was close to being a civil war in many areas.
You actually split many-many families.
Thomas Jefferson said,
"The tree of revolution is..." or "The tree of liberty is... watered by the blood of revolution every generation."
And I think that's a little exaggerated, but there's some truth to that.
The war had come to Westchester County, but so too had independence and a new responsibility.
Men are getting killed, men are killing. That's the parallel.
As far as politics, are you kidding?
Oriental politics?
Don't put me on, man.
Fire!
We haven't found his weapon yet.
We're still looking for it.
- You got a weapon?
- No, sir.
He had one, man.
This guy's got ammo.
I'm planning to medivac this guy.
The people who are living in the jungle, under the bombs, without pay, without their families, are doing so because they are fighting for independence.
Because they're fighting, in this case, for unification... and they're fighting for revolution.
Of course, the name for a conflict... in which you're opposing a revolution is counter-revolution.
And this is something we never admitted to ourselves at all.
It's-It's what we were really doing.
The letters and the reports we had... on Ho Chi Minh's attitude back in 1946... he wrote I think it was seven letters to this government and received no reply.
The-The-The pathos, almost, the sadness...
Here's a man who felt and believed the United States... would be sympathetic to his purpose of gaining his independence... from a colonial power.
And then to find we...
You know, this is what he'd read.
He'd been here, read our Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
He thought surely the United States would be interested.
We had testimony in the committee that his one worry... was that it was so insignificant...
Vietnam was so far away, insignificant... we would never bother about it.
It's too small to ever attract the attention of the United States.
He was sure in his own mind... that if we ever put our minds in focus upon it, we would be for him.
How different history would have been for us and for them... if we had felt a common interest... in the colonial province like Vietnam... seeking its independence from France.
The Ho Chi Minh of '56,
I don't think could have got elected dogcatcher in South Vietnam.
Ho Chi Minh, uh, dead...
Could beat any candidate we've ever put up in Vietnam.
You asked me about my oldest son Bing.
He was a graduate of Harvard, 1965.
And he was not a soldier at heart.
Uh, but he realized,
I'm sure, there's no question, he realized he was part of a big job that had to be done, and he was gonna do it the way he did everything... full out.
And he went out on this mission...
Minh River... and it was a big assault mission bringing elements... to this area just south of Da Nang along the railroad line.
And they encountered heavy, sustained, uh, automatic weapons fire.
And the helicopter ahead of him,
I believe, was, uh, uh, destr... was shot down.
And then he went in and his helicopter was, uh, uh...
He was actually killed in flight.
That's what they...
And the airplane crashed, and he and his co... He was killed.
His copilot was very badly injured.
And I think there were 12 out of
15 or 16 of the people aboard... were either killed or badly hurt.
Many bombs, many coffins.
These are for children.
Eight or nine hundred a week.
I have lost seven children myself.
Many have died here.
It's nothing like in the countryside.
Many more have died there.
In the country, there are no coffins.
There's no money to buy them.
How did all the children die?
Poison. Poison, you know.
These planes keep spouting and spraying the stuff, and so many people have died.
It seems to destroy their intestines.
With this spraying and bombing, so many have died.
Each day, right on time, the bomb craters appear.
Hundreds of tons are dropped each day.
And we can't talk about it.
We can't talk about it... because we are afraid of the government.
Come on.
- You look nice.
- How do you feel?
What'd you do?
Uh, shaved.
I liked it better long.
So what you been doing?
In little more than a week,
I'll be going back to the military.
You what?
- Why?
- Well...
After what they've done to you?
Well, it's... it's a choice between that... or, uh, Canada, again.
Or, uh, staying underground.
Which is, uh, as you know, impossible...
- Have you been in contact with them?
- No.
No. But I've got a lot of support.
You'll get the same deal
Mike's getting.
It's going to be a different type thing.
I'm going back publicly.
We're having, uh,
Ad Hoc Congressional Hearings.
Yeah?
It's really been building up over the past couple of months.
- And...
- Am I going to be able to be there?
Of course you're going to be there. I'm gonna try to get Ronnie there, too.
"Cause you know what
I feel about the army.
These people holding their heads high because they lost a son... in Vietnam or something.
I don't think that's much to be proud of.
They've lost more than they'll ever gain for the rest of their lives.
And I remember I was sitting at the base of the hill, and I was on one of the tanks.
And I had an M-16, and I had stacks of magazines.
And there were two guys, you know, that were going through, like, some grass and bam!
I dinged in on one of 'em, and I nailed him, you know.
And the Aussie with me confirmed, you know, that I dinged him.
And I felt good. And I wanted more.
And it wasn't that I wanted more for politics or anything like that.
No. I couldn't of cared if they were whatever.
I just wanted them because they were the opposition, the enemy.
Stinking little savages.
Wipe 'em out, I say.
Wipe 'em out.
Wipe 'em off the face of the earth!
Will we ever understand these Eastern races?
Hit me, Poon Soon.
You hideous yellow monster!
I wanted to go out and kill some gooks, you know?
I-I really... I-I don't know. I guess
I had been totally brainwashed, because I could remember when people used to call me "blanket ass"... or "chief" and they still did, you know?
I think my name was, uh,
Ira Hayes in boot camp.
Either Ira Hayes or squaw, depending on what mood the drill instructor was in.
But there I was, you know, saying
I wanted to go kill some gooks.
They were instructed to remove the eyes of the individual... and place them in a hole in the middle of the back, and that would say to the
Vietnamese, you have to understand, uh, that whoever did that was ubiquitous.
In other words, the eye being the symbol of ubiquity, uh, or of all-present, all-powerfulness on the part of the Saigon government.
Which is an easy message for the local villagers to get.
In fact, the American advisors didn't have that much of a stomach for it.
So they used to use CBS logos.
You know, the eye of CBS?
And they would kill the individual and then they would leave him... with kind of a calling card on him.
At one point, I was invited to go along on an airborne interrogation... in a helicopter with the marines northwest of Da Nang.
And they took along two Vietnamese.
And one was already reduced by beatings with a rubber hose... and some other methods of, uh, beating and torture... to the point where he couldn't talk, he couldn't respond.
As an example to the one they wanted to question, they'd say,
"If you don't tell us what we want to know, we're gonna throw you out of the helicopter."
And, uh, he couldn't respond.
He didn't understand.
They were using, uh, pigeon Vietnamese, which he didn't understand.
It was more English than Vietnamese.
They'd run him up to the helicopter... two hefty E.M. were along... they'd take him by each elbow and run him up to the door of the helicopter.
They'd do this three or four times.
He was reduced to whimpering and crying.
And they finally, um, uh, told him that this was the last run.
He still responded the same way, and they winged him out of the helicopter.
The second fellow immediately started to babble.
Anything he could tell them.
Any kind of information he could give them for one goal.
And that was to reach the ground alive again.
I just can't see in my mind somebody throwing somebody out of a helicopter.
I don't believe this kind of stuff happened. Maybe it did. I don't know.
I never saw it, put it that way.
I've seen G.I.'s get mad and, uh, uh, rather than shoot one of these dinks, uh, just punch him right out, yeah, with his hands.
Americans say Vietnamese are just slant-eyed savages.
The Vietnamese have
5,000 years of history.
We fight against the invaders.
It is not we who are the savages.
I don't know where they are.
That's the worst thing.
Right around and run into the sewers and the gutters, anywhere.
They can be anywhere. Just hopin' you can stay alive from day to day.
I just want to go back home and go to school. That's about it.
- Have you lost any friends?
- Quite a few.
We lost one the other day.
The whole thing stinks.
The dude in the foxhole with me, he was dead.
And, like, here come the jets.
Everybody's, "Yay, jets! Do it to 'em.
Get these motherfuckers off our ass." You know.
'Cause they were diggin' in our behind real good.
And, like, the jet came in and "Yay, jet, get 'em."
And you see 'em swoopin' all around.
"Yay, jet, get 'em."
And he came over that way and let it go, and you say, "Uh-oh."
And you could see it's napalm cannister, because you can tell 'em.
They spin asshole over head, backwards as they're tumbling through the air.
And the thing is just tumbling down.
You know it's coming right at you.
You know. And, like, wow. The napalm hit, I grabbed this dude, just put him up over my head in the hole like that.
Fuckin' napalm went down the whole line.
Just creamed everybody in the line.
Thirty-five dudes, man, just burnt.
Post-toasty to the bitter, you dig?
And that napalm was just drippin' on both sides of this dude.
He's dead, you know. I'm just holdin' him up, using him as a shield.
I just chunked this dude off of me and just sprung out of the hole.
I didn't know which way I was going outside of back, you dig?
And just ran through.
Burned my pants off.
Spent the rest of the battle running with no drawers. My stuff hanging out.
You ever try to fight a battle without any drawers on, man?
Awful sick of it.
I'll be so glad to go home.
I don't know. It's the worst area we've been in since I've been in Vietnam.
You think it's worth it?
Yeah. I don't know. They say we're fighting for something. I don't know.
I was at a very kind of sobering thing last night.
Memorial service for four men in the second squadron... who were killed the other day.
One of them being a medic.
And, uh, the place was just packed.
And we sang three hymns and had a nice prayer.
I turned around, looked at their faces, and they were...
I was just proud.
My-My, uh, feeling for America... just soared because of their...
The way they looked.
They looked determined... and-and-and reverent at the same time.
But still they're a bloody good bunch of killers.
"When you go forth to war against your enemies... and see horses and chariots in an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid."
Well, let's not anybody be so naive as to think we're here, in any way, to worship football.
Nor are we here, as I'm sure many people believe, to pray for a victory.
We believe in victory.
We believe it will come to the team that's best prepared.
This is serious business that we're involved in.
And that's religious, and God cares.
There are going to be men made tonight.
And that's religious, and God cares about that.
We're concerned about the big game.
But we're also concerned about the bigger game, the biggest game of all that surrounds us: The game of life.
May you be winners.
Winners in the big game.
But even more importantly, winners in the biggest game of all, which we all play. Let us pray.
That's a touchdown.
Because we got our kids geared to crack like hell.
Holding, number 37.
You got to tell them they're number one, no matter what.
- You're number one.
Wow. Why don't you just say "wow"?
- Say what?
- 'Toy hoy" means "wow"?
- Toy hoy?
- Yeah.
Like, toy hoy means, like, wow, you know?
- Look at the hickeys I gave this chick.
- You gave her hickeys?
- Yeah.
- I can imagine. Where?
Uh, one on each side.
- It's a place where she can't hide 'em.
- Oh, really?
See, this one? I gave her this one.
And this one, this is the first one right there.
It came out kind of nasty, you know.
- And... No can do, I know.
- Maybe he's dead.
- He's not dead. Wake him up.
- No can wakey up.
Why?
- Wakey him up. He no hard.
- Huh? Why he's no hard?
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause you no wake him up.
Hey, Charles.
You getting anything out of yours?
This one's, uh, kind of sour on me, you know? Uh...
- Well, keep her going, man.
- Huh?
- Keep her going.
- I'm trying to.
You know what it is about these chicks down here, like, they're, uh...
Well, what would you want to do... except for, you know, have a ball with them.
- And, uh... Right?
- Right.
You're number one.
This one's got a set of knockers, man.
This one does, too, but she won't take her goddamn bra off.
Take it off for her.
Take it off for her?
- That's the name of the game.
- Here, you don't want this.
I know. I know what you want.
- Hey. Hey, Charles. Charles.
- What?
Yeah? It's about time.
Ah, you don't be mad at me, okay?
It took you long enough, you know that?
- Oh, yeah. Check it out, baby.
- Check it out later, man.
Check it out later? Mm!
You know, if my chick at home could see this now, man, she'd flip.
One more. Yeah, this man here.
Hurry up down that tunnel.
Let's make a quick check and let's go.
Okay, well, hurry it up and check it out quickly.
Some people enjoy it, some don't.
Some just go out and do it as a job.
It's a daily grind.
- What is it for you?
- I enjoy it.
Now I know that he will have a very important message for each one of us, so I want you all to listen very attentively... to what he has to say to you.
- Lieutenant Coker.
- If you ever have to go to a war, and unfortunately, someday you probably will have to fight a war, you'll find out that life becomes very simple.
Because the only thing you're concerned about is living and dying.
Everything else is unimportant, because suddenly your life is at stake.
And that's what it's like to be when you become a prisoner, particularly, a prisoner of war.
Because the thing that got us through were the things we learned... before we were ten years old.
I'd like to open up to questions now.
Just raise your hand or yell it out and you can ask any question you want.
And I'll do the best I can to answer them.
How did you feel when the Vietnam war was over?
How did I feel when the war was over?
I felt real good. Real good.
It was a long war and a very difficult war to understand.
But the reason we went there was to win this war.
I volunteered to go.
I'd go again if I had to.
And we wanted to win.
That was our number one ambition.
That's what we really wanted, was to win this war.
And it took us a long time.
So when we knew that we had won, we felt great; we really felt great.
- What did Vietnam look like?
- What did Vietnam look like.
Well, if it wasn't for the people, it was very pretty.
Uh, the people over there are very backward and very primitive.
And they just make a mess out of everything.
How did you... How did you, um...
What do you feel about the people that, um, went and burned their draft cards and went into Canada?
We don't agree with them. I think these people were legally wrong.
I think sometimes they were cowards.
If they wanted to leave and go to Canada, that's okay.
But they can't come back, though, because they have disagreed.
They say, "We don't like your country, we don't like your people."
They're saying that to you and me.
"I don't like you, so I'm leaving."
Well, fine, that's okay. There's no reason to hate a guy for that.
'Cause that's also his right, but he can't come back.
Instead of helping and aiding the Vietnamese people,
I saw that we were party to their deliberate and systematic destruction.
The Vietnamese were considered, less than humans, inferiors.
We called them "gooks," "slopes."
Their lives weren't worth anything to us because we'd been taught to believe... that they were all fanatical and that they were all V. C... or V.C. sympathizers, even the children.
Many of us, however, began to understand... through our personal experiences in Vietnam... the depth of the lies and deceptions practiced upon us, and the American people, by our country's leaders.
It was they who trained us to kill without question... and to hate our enemy... the Vietnamese.
They concocted such phrases as "kill ratios", "search and destroy",
"free fire zones",
"secure areas", and so on... to mask the reality of their combat policy in Vietnam.
I make no apology for this act of resistance.
I could do nothing else at the time.
But underground life has become intolerable to me.
So I'm here today to draw attention to the true facts concerning my case... and the cases of tens of thousands just like me.
We are not criminals to be hunted and imprisoned.
Over a half million of us have deserted the military since 1965.
Most of us have already returned to the military... to be punished with jail and bad discharges... that will be carried around for the rest of our lives.
And it is a supreme irony to be prosecuted by the very same men... who planned and executed a genocidal war in Indochina.
Now, inside this hearing room,
Eddie Sowders has surrendered himself.
Urged on, he says, by a hand-to-mouth underground existence... that still nags at many of his fellow deserters... who continue to look over their shoulders.
Paul Udell, NBC News, Washington.
- How was your sound?
- One more time.
Let me respectfully tell the American people... that this is their dirtiest and longest war.
The Vietnamese fight only in self-defense.
Ultimately, the Americans will see the light.
If not, they will defeat themselves.
You know, Vietnam, uh, reminded me of a... of a child, the developing of a child.
The laws of nature control the development of this child.
A child has to sit up before it crawls.
It has to crawl before it walks.
It has to walk before it runs.
No matter how many decades America fights,
I'm telling you so that you will go back and repeat it to President Nixon.
Over here, as long as there is rice to eat, we'll keep fighting.
And if the rice runs out, then we'll plow the fields and fight again.
I know very little about it over there, I'll tell ya.
And the less I know, the better off I'll be.
It has not affected me a whole lot.
I mean, the American...
The way of life is still here.
And if you work for it, it's there for you.
We're taught that we're to obey our government, and I would have to go if I was instructed to.
Once in a while, I think about it, but I like to think about the things that are happening right now to me.
I don't it's affected mine at all.
I don't even know who we're fighting for over there, to be real honest with you.
I think we're fighting for the North Vietnamese, ain't we?
I fled from Dau Tien to go live in Suoi Dua.
Then I was allowed to go back, and I went back... and stayed in Ben Chua.
While I was in Ben Chua, trouble broke out again.
So I was taken up to Co Tach.
I was picked up again and sent to Ben Chua... to be lumped together with the others.
My house burned down while I was away.
Once more, I got sent to Co Tach.
I've fled five, six, at least seven times already.
The lives of my countrymen are worth no more than that of a fly.
You take it and swat it dead... just like that.
Ladies, listen to me.
There were some women amusing themselves and one pushed the other onto a table.
The lady's falsies broke the table in two.
If a table breaks, think of what would happen to a man's face.
Watch it, they're filming.
Don't joke.
People in America will think we're ridiculous.
We have about 15 companies now, including an insurance company and a tractor company.
We are in the hotel business, in the travel agency business.
We are the exclusive dealer for Ford in the country, Ford cars.
Oh, many, many other things, like, uh, an oil company in the forming.
We, uh, have a bottling company.
In other words, uh, we greatly... we greatly believe in the future of this country, and, uh, we think there's a great future for Vietnam.
And, uh, we think that Vietnam will be liveable, will not go communist, because otherwise, all these companies will go to waste.
And the way we work is we take a calculated risk.
If we don't lose South Vietnam within the next three to five years, then nobody can catch up with us.
I'm a Johnny-come-lately as far as war profiteering is concerned.
Uh, the reason why I... uh, organized this group of companies is because when I was in Paris,
I saw that peace was coming, whether we liked it or not.
Therefore, I got home in order to prepare for peace.
All these companies have been organized in order to prepare for peace... and prepare for the economic takeoff that will come with peace.
We have the infrastructure of hotels, of travel agencies and things like that.
But, of course, there are no tourists in Vietnam now. But there will be.
And, uh, we are getting ready for that sort of thing.
Does it feel comfortable?
Keep it flat. Just like you do with your good leg.
Now try to walk.
Well, it really isn't that much.
We were just walking and...
We were walking on a patrol and, uh, we ran into an ambush.
About six, seven guys really got hurt.
Ran into a battalion ambush, they said it was.
And it was supposed to be one of the biggest ambushes of Tet season.
And we called in two or three medivacs, and they got hit.
So, finally, the last one came in and got us out.
From that, I never saw any of the others
I was with, except for one or two.
And that was about it.
Most of the guys I keep in touch with are guys in the hospital.
They usually have a reunion once a year.
That's about it. There's really not that much to talk about.
Here we are for one thing that we said, and I don't give a shit now.
I don't care about the football game now.
I don't care about anything now.
The one thing that we wanna show these bastards with Masillon pride... is that we come down and show
'em a great Masillon effort.
And what the piss you doing?
What are ya doing?
Get going! Goddamn it, Tony!
Don't let 'em beat us!
Don't let 'em beat us!
Let's go! Show 'em Masillon pride.
- Come on! Go!
- Go!
Go, go, go, go!
Get him! Get him!
Make no mistake about it.
I don't want a man in here...
To go back home thinking otherwise.
We are going to win.
Go, motherfucker! Go!
Since the Lunar New Year, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese have proved they are capable... of bold and impressive military moves... that Americans here never dreamed could be achieved.
Whether the Vietcong can sustain this onslaught long remains to be seen, but whatever turn this war now takes, the capture of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon for seven hours... will be a story to rally and inspire the Vietcong.
Don North, ABC news, at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.
I know that, as was the case in the
Battle of the Bulge in World War II, that after the enemy exposed himself, we would defeat him.
He would be weakened, and we could follow that up.
Through the use of, uh, the maximum military force that we could bring to bear on him, through the bombing, through the mining of the harbors, through the cutting of his lines of communication, by moving in and cleaning out his sanctuaries, the enemy would have no choice... but to come to some accommodation.
In the beginning of 1968,
General Westmoreland needed
206,000 more troops.
We met hour after hour after hour in the Pentagon.
And I started in and asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
"How long do you think that we'll still be in the war?"
None of them knew.
"Uh, do you think that the
206,000 men will be enough?"
Nobody knew.
"Uh, might we have to send more men?" "Well, possibly."
"Well, in six months?"
"We don't know."
"A year? Eighteen months?"
I couldn't get answers to these questions.
By the end of that four-day interrogation,
I was getting down... by the end of it... into very serious questions,
"Do any of you men, as you look at it objectively, do you find any diminution in the will of the enemy to fight?"
Well, they said,
"No, we guess we don't."
"Are they sending the same number of men down through the Ho Chi Minh trail?"
"Well, yes, and even they might be a little more."
"And how about our bombing? We've placed great reliance on our bombing.
Is our bombing stopping them?"
"No."
"Well, what is the amount of attrition that our bombing's causing?"
"Well, maybe 10 to 15 percent."
So I remember asking one question.
"If a North Vietnamese field commander in South Vietnam needed 1,000 men..."
They said, "Yes."
"If he asked for, say, 1,200 men, 1,000 would get through?"
"Well, that's right."
'then he'd have the thousand he needed." "Well, yes. That's so."
Well, this type of interrogation...
Finally, by the end of four or five days,
I must say that my thinking... had undergone a very substantial revolution.
Come on, everybody!
As long as the
American President... is commander in chief... of the biggest war machine in human history, with bases on every continent, we are going to get into trouble.
Our enemy is the growing militarization of American life.
Our enemy is American imperialism.
And there is an awakening.
The enemy was on the ropes after the Tet offensive was over.
And it's like two boxers in the ring.
One boxer has the other one on the ropes, but the man who is about to be the victor... has his second throw the towel in.
Accordingly,
I shall not seek... and I will not accept... the nomination of my party for another term as your president.
I don't think we helped 'em one bit.
All I think we've done is destroyed their country, laid it waste.
No. I don't think we helped 'em.
As fellow human beings, I don't think they should be there doing that.
Certainly a mature person can say they made a mistake.
Why can't a government?
You let us all go off to war and said,
"Yea, team. Fight in Vietnam," and all this kinda shit in 1965 through 1968.
Now 1968 comes along and "Boo, team.
Come on home," and all this shit.
"And don't say nothin' about it, 'cause we don't want to hear about it...
'cause it's upsetting around dinnertime."
Well, Goddamn. It upset me for a whole goddamn year.
It upset a lot of people to the point where they're fuckin' dead, you know?
All this shit. You don't wanna hear about it? I'll tell you every day.
Make you sit out and puke on your dinner, you dig?
Because you got me over there, and now you done brought me back here... and you wanna forget it so somebody else can go do it somewhere else.
Hell no. Uh-uh.
You gonna hear it all.
Every day as long as you live, because it's gonna be with me as long as I live.
When I get up in the morning, when John gets up, when a lot of dudes sitting here get up, man, their gut hurts because they got shot there.
I gotta put on an arm and a leg, 'cause it ain't there no more, you dig?
Now, my man's got a hole in his stomach.
He can't work right, you know?
You do something about that.
Make that all disappear, you dig?
Make it all go away with the 6:00 news.
Turn it off or switch it to another channel.
Uh-Uh. To hell with that, you dig?
It's here and it's for real.
And it's gonna happen again unless these folks get off their ass... and realize it has happened.
The country is ready to pass a reasoned judgment on this war.
The people have judged, I think, that it's unwise and immoral... and not in the national interest of this country... and that, therefore, it must be brought to an end.
For 20 years, first the French, and then the United States... had been predicting victory in Vietnam.
In 1961 and in 1962, as well as 1966 and 1967, we have been told that the tide is turning, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, we can soon bring our troops home, victory is near, the enemy is tiring.
Once, in 1962,
I participated in such a prediction myself.
But for 20 years, we have been wrong.
The history of conflict among nations... does not record another such lengthy and consistent chronicle of error... as we have shown in Vietnam.
I had just given the policy line, stayed up all night with
Adam Walinsky and Peter Edelman, helping on a speech for Robert Kennedy... which proved to be his last speech given in San Francisco here... to a businessman's luncheon on Vietnam.
Uh, I went up with some corrections last thing in the morning... and shook hands with him in his bathrobe as he stood there.
And then he came down from the
Ambassador Hotel and got into a car.
We were struck with how easy it was to get onto that floor... and approach him at that point.
At the conference on lessons on Vietnam, of course, in the morning I learned that Robert Kennedy had died.
Well...
So...
So, uh...
Well, that was a way for a lot of people to feel powerless.
So, um, it began to look as if there was no way to change this country.
We'd been going down this road for so many years, and I had felt so strongly before that this was the right policy, that it was difficult for me to change.
I know now that the domino theory was a false theory.
I know now that we should not have become involved.
As far as I'm concerned today, I have no hesitancy whatsoever... in saying I could not have been more wrong... in my attitude toward Vietnam.
Ground combat, Vietnamese cross of gallantry with a silver star, gallantry in ground combat, four air medals, an "I was there" ribbon.
I got a colonel that's flying upstairs, and he's gettin' down on me... and he's saying, 'take the hill, take the hill, take the hill."
So I got together with the tank commander... and I said,
"Look, let's take three tanks... and we'll walk the A.R.V.N.
Up the hill, you know?
And we'll lay down a base of fire as we're going."
He says, "Okay." I got with the
A.R.V.N. And says, "Let's fly."
So I popped up behind the lead tank... and, uh, started to go up the hill.
And everything was cool, until we started taking fire.
And, uh, the A.R.V.N. started to split.
And that's when I got it.
I said, "Oh, my God. I'm hit."
I couldn't believe it, you know?
"I can't believe it.
I'm really hit."
And my first, first thought... was Kay, my girl, you know?
It's gonna sound stupid, but I'm... but my thought was "she'll kill me."
You know, here I was dying and I was worried that she was gonna kill me.
But then I realized that I didn't have to worry because I was dying.
It's all over. And for what, you know?
My last... My last conscious thought... was "I can't believe it. I'm dying.
On this shitty piece of ground, I'm dying... and I can't fuckin' believe it."
Bobby was a surfer, he was a wrestler, he was a long-distance runner.
We danced. He was active.
Active, active.
Our whole life was active.
And now they're telling me that he's paralyzed.
He couldn't believe it and I couldn't believe it. Right now...
Bobby's not a boyfriend. He's not a husband. He's not a brother.
It-It's very...
It's very hard.
What hurts the most... and this is a purely personal thing, you know?
Right, wrong or indifferent, that's how I feel.
When I was in the Marine Corps,
I remember I was in the Marine
Corps barracks in Washington...
They call it "A," "F," and "I."
And they had the Marine
Corps drill team there.
And I was standing at attention in my uniform... and they were playing the
"Marine Corps Hymn".
And then they played the
'star-Spangled Banner."
And I actually started to cry.
I cried because I was so proud to be an American, you know?
And I was so proud to be a marine... and in uniform, standing there at attention.
That-That represented so much to me... in the way of life and...
That's gone, you know?
And that hurt. That hurts.
That's what I'm bitter about.
Ha! Didn't think we were here, did you, you dirty rotten rats!
We're still here!
We'll always be here!
Truman lied from 1950 on... on the nature and purposes of the French involvement, the colonial reconquest of Vietnam... that we were financing and encouraging.
Eisenhower lied about the reasons for... and the nature of our involvement with Diem, and the fact that he was in power, essentially, because of American support,
American money, and for no other reason.
Kennedy lied about the type of involvement we were doing there, our own combat involvement, and about the recommendations that were made to him for greater involvement.
President Kennedy lied about... the degree of our participation in the overthrow of Diem.
The, um... Johnson, of course, lied and lied and lied... about our provocations against the North Vietnamese... prior to and after the Tonkin Gulf incidents, about the plans for bombing North Vietnam, and the nature of the buildup... of American troops in Vietnam.
Nixon, as we now know, misled and lied to the American public... for the first months of his office in terms of our bombing of Cambodia... and of Laos, ground operations in Laos, the reasons for our invasion of Cambodia and of Laos, and the prospects for the mining at
Haiphong that came about in 1972, but was envisioned as early as 1969.
The American public was lied to month by month... by each of these five administrations.
As I say, it's a tribute to the American public, that their leaders perceived that they had to be lied to.
It's no tribute to us that it was so easy to fool the public.
We have adopted a plan... which we have worked out in cooperation with the South Vietnamese... for the complete withdrawal of all U.S. combat ground forces... and their replacement by South Vietnamese forces... on an orderly, scheduled timetable.
This withdrawal will be made from strength and not from weakness.
As South Vietnamese forces become stronger, the rate of American withdrawal can become greater.
Congratulations to Battalion 332... on your recent victories over the communists.
We ask ourselves,
"When will peace come?"
And I tell you, if you chase the communists back to the north, there won't be any war in this hamlet.
Help rebuild the houses.
Help the people.
Rid the hamlet of all V. C... so there will be no more suffering and destruction... for ourselves and our compatriots.
Oh, my friend.
- How you doing? Good to see you again.
- You just get back?
- Yeah. How you doing, men?
- Very good to see you.
How you doing?
Trung, good seeing you.
- Good to see you, sir.
- How you doing? Fine.
Just came in this afternoon, sir.
Been very quiet?
- Except last time, when the, uh...
- When the rockets went off?
Yeah.
Very nice. I read about it in Stars And Stripes.
That's one of our success stories here, this battalion is.
We had a real, uh... a lot of trouble with it.
We just gave, uh, four bronze stars... and five Ar-Comms with V-device this week... to a battalion commander and three of his officers and five soldiers.
And we have six N-pac awards... pending for last Saturday night's action... where we killed six V.C.
And captured nine weapons.
Good grief.
He had been the recon company commander of the, uh, 263rd... and he'd done a real tremendous job just as recon company commander.
And then they moved him over here.
In a ten-day period or two-week period, he completely reversed it.
They had the battalion here under a very poor major.
They had it to the point where the company commanders... were throwing down their weapons and crying... or at least one of them did.
Ten days later they had a big contact with the V. C... and in 3 days killed 42, lost none of their own.
He does it with a fairly limited staff.
Although some of his people, like that young major there, Major Yuk... tremendous guy.
He just heard his name over there.
Hey.
It's no surprise that in a very poor country... you can find people who will wear foreign uniforms.
What has always surprised us, what we've never been willing to predict or understand, is that the Vietnamese communist leadership... can find enough people to live in the tunnels, fight for nothing wearing ragged shorts, year after year under the American bombs.
A war in which one side is entirely financed... and equipped and supported by foreigners... is not a civil war.
The only foreigners in that country... were the foreigners we financed in the first part of the war... and the foreigners we were in the second half of the war.
Basically, we didn't want to acknowledge... the scale of our involvement there.
We didn't want to realize that it was our war, because that would have been to say that every casualty on both sides... was a casualty caused by our policy.
The question used to be "Might it be possible we were on the wrong side... in the Vietnamese War?"
We weren't on the wrong side.
We are the wrong side.
You have exemplified, in your corner of the world, patriotism of the highest order.
You have brought to your great task of organizing your country... the greatest of courage, the greatest of statesmanship.
I had two possibilities.
Either I could submit to Washington's politics...
Every morning, "Yes, sir."
Or I would have to resign.
You can be sure that as a soldier
I only submit very rarely.
And, in fact, never.
I chose the second solution, that of resigning.
On the Vietnamese side, I would say the most encouraging factor... is the promise offered by General Khanh's government.
Through a security service in the president's office, we taped all communications with the outside.
All telephone communications.
And fortunately, among these taped telephone communications,
I still have the tape from which we can hear precisely...
General Taylor... stating precisely that he wants me,
General Khanh, to leave Vietnam.
Can you let us hear it?
Certainly. I hope it works.
- General Taylor.
- Uh, this is General Khanh speaking.
How are you? Glad to hear you.
Uh, uh, may I speak in French?
Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen, as our joint communique indicates,
President Thieu and I have had very constructive talks... with regard to how we shall work together in the years ahead, working for the program of peace, which we now hope will all be the wave of the future, not only for the
Republic of Vietnam, but for all of the countries in Indochina.
What kind of freedom could you preserve here... when you put so many of our compatriots into prison... without any charge, without any reason why?
Just because you want us to have freedom?
What kind of freedom could you give us?
We know that we only have freedom if we fight for it.
But here we fight for what?
We fight for prisons?
People can be arrested at any moment by any organization.
And then tortured in inhuman ways in all the prisons.
And, above all, in police stations.
And then imprisoned for years and years without trial.
Their only crime is loving their country.
They had the courage to tell the truth.
They asked for the liberation of political prisoners.
They asked for an end to the war.
They asked for peace, for national reconciliation.
And all that is considered a crime by the government of Thieu.
I was arrested in 1968.
I was at home when the security police came.
They took me to headquarters for a few questions... and kept me.
You can't imagine how badly I was beaten.
Mostly on the head.
My eyes are bad now.
After I was arrested,
I was beaten so badly... even now
I sometimes have headaches... and nosebleeds and ear-bleeds.
In those days, all we were getting to eat was rotten fish, so we asked for some vegetables.
But when we complained, we were beaten and chained... and lime powder was thrown on us.
And they poured water on us, and we had nowhere to run.
Our cells were this big... and we could do nothing but stand where we were... and get the water and the lime all over us.
Some of us lost our teeth and our hair.
And when the lime got wet, it just boiled up, bubbling all over us.
Our hair fell out and our skin became covered with sores.
They said that if we were innocent, they would beat us until we were guilty, and that if we were guilty, they would beat us until we repent.
In a country where the people don't hold national sovereignty, in a country where the government has proven itself... to be the enemy of the people, the prisoners are the patriots.
And no matter how badly treated we are, still we are proud, because at least we are free, instead of enslaved as so many of the so-called government officials.
And so, you see, when a Vietnamese works for peace and for liberty, he is considered a communist.
It is an honor for the communists to have to work for peace and justice.
So it is the government which gives validity to being a communist, because they continue to say... that the people who work for justice and for peace are communists.
You see?
We were learning to be good soldiers... back when you're three, four, five, six years old.
That's when good ol' mom is telling you to obey the local camp regulations.
In this case, it's the house.
And you start to learn to respect authority.
And so, finally, lo and behold, at 20, 22 years old, you find yourself in service and maybe take that last and final step, where you become quite regimented... in a military form of discipline.
That stuff isn't worth the paper it's written on, if the basis isn't there.
You need that cornerstone that goes back to childhood, and who's teaching you, but good old moms, women like yourselves.
It's terrifying. When you're facing a torture session with a bunch of gooks, it's gonna be pretty darn miserable.
No doubt about it. You're scared.
You're really petrified.
But at the other side, you have a bunch of women back there... telling you, "You better do something," you know?
That's the wrath of God. You don't want
100 women climbing down your back,
So you figure the gooks aren't so bad.
So you press on.
In many respects, the destiny of our country, and more personally, the destiny of me, your men, your children... is in your hands.
If you are proud of the P.O. W. S and personally of me, then you should be proud of yourselves, because I was what you made me to be.
As for my own view, uh, I thought through as best I could... the meaning of Southeast Asia to the United States in the 1950s,
Looking backward and looking forward... in terms of what I know about the dynamics of societies and so on.
And on balance...
It is an on-balance judgment...
I came to the judgment that it's a vital interest to the United States.
I've never had any reason to change that judgment.
And, uh, therefore, I, uh,
I do believe that what we have done is generally right, although I would have preferred to have seen a different, more decisive military strategy.
Certainly, to me, the day you can say that a sacrifice such as that is not worthwhile... is the day that you've destroyed all your real values... of what is worthwhile and what isn't.
And there's no question in my mind... that he and everybody else that did what he did... there's no sacrifice that is in vain.
Absolutely none. Down the line, that's the price you pay for freedom... and that's the price that you pay for the kind of stature that we have... and it's the kind of risk you take... to preserve the ideals that we have.
He had just a tremendous sense of humor... and just an amazing, instinctive sense of what was important and what wasn't.
I remember when I was getting ready for our oldest daughter's wedding, and I was upset because something or other wasn't going well, and he called up from Pensacola and he said, "How are thing's going?"
And I said, "Fine, Bing, but such-and-such has happened."
He said, "Oh, Mom, don't sweat the small stuff."
You know, it just made all the difference.
I thought, "Gee. That really is small stuff, you know?"
And it was. Yeah.
And it made the whole thing much easier.
And, of course, I came up in a tradition where military service was...
In World War II, there was no question everybody was part of it.
There was not the kind of dissension and so forth... that there has been surrounding the Vietnam thing.
But I think that most of the people of this country... are too busy to get involved deeply... in, uh, uh, on, uh, the kind of things that the dissenters do.
In other words, I think that really the strength of our system, and I think it's a terrific system, is that you do rely on somebody like
President Nixon for leadership.
I think his team of people with him are outstanding... and, to me, the leadership that he has shown... and decisions that he has made, uh, really have...
They're the kind of decisions...
I would expect from the president of this country.
And the action he has taken is the action I'd expect... from the president of this country.
I think the whole executive, legislative and judicial system that we have is superb.
It has worked many, many... far better than any other system I'm aware of... and brought us to our state of power... and, uh, really, of international stature... that we have a responsibility to stay with and to uphold.
What did your son want to become?
I suspect he would have gone into the newspaper.
He actually had just got a job with the New York Times... when he went into the, uh, O.C.S.
And he'd worked for newspapers in the summer... while he was at college.
I suppose that it's like any pain.
You don't remember pain too well... afterwards.
Thank you. Thank you very much,
Mr. President, dear people.
I'm thrilled to be here with you guys.
This is what I like... a captive audience.
It is always the custom at a dinner at the White House... to have a toast to the honored guest.
The difficulty tonight is that there are so many honored guests... that we would be drinking all night and into the day.
Somebody just said,
"What's wrong with that?"
The most difficult decision that I have made since being president... was on December the
18th of last year.
There...
And there were many occasions... in the 10-day period after the decision was made... when I wondered whether this country really supported it.
After having met each one of our honored guests this evening... and after having talked to them,
I think that all of us... would like to join in a round of applause... for the brave men that took those B-52s in and did the job.
My eight-year-old daughter was killed.
And my three-year-old son.
A son, three years old, killed.
Nixon, murderer of civilians.
What have I done to Nixon so that he comes here to bomb my country?
My daughter died right here.
She was feeding the pigs.
She was so sweet.
She is dead. The pigs are alive.
My mother and my children took shelter here.
Here they died.
The planes came from over there.
No targets here.
Only rice fields and houses.
I'll give you my daughter's beautiful shirt.
Take it back to the United States.
Tell them what happened here.
My daughter is dead.
She will never wear the shirt again.
Throw the shirt in Nixon's face.
Tell them she was only a little schoolgirl.
Well, the Oriental... doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner.
Life is plentiful, life is cheap in the Orient.
And, uh, as the, uh, philosophy of the, uh, of the Orient, uh, uh, expresses it, uh, uh, life is, uh, is not important.
During the missions, after the missions, the result of what I was doing... the result of this-this game, this, uh, exercise of my technical expertise... never really dawned on me.
That reality of the screams or the people being blown away... or their homeland being destroyed, uh, just was not a part of what I thought about.
Uh, we, as Americans, have never experienced that.
We've never experienced any kind of devastation.
When I was there, I never saw a child that got burned by napalm.
I didn't drop napalm, but I dropped other things just as bad.
I dropped C.B.U. s, which can't destroy anything.
It's meant for people.
It's an antipersonnel weapon.
We used to drop canister upon canister of these things... with 200 tumbling little balls in there about this big around... with something like
600 pellets in each ball... that would blow out as soon as it hit the ground, uh, and shred people to pieces.
They couldn't be gotten out in many cases.
People would suffer. They would live, but they would suffer, you know?
Then often they would die afterwards.
This would cause people to have to take care of them, you know?
But I look at my children now... and, uh, I don't know what would happen if, uh... uh, what I would think about if someone napalmed them.
Do you think we've learned anything from all this?
I think we're trying not to.
I think I'm trying not to sometimes.
I can't even cry easily.
From my, uh, my manhood image.
I think Americans have tried...
We've all tried very hard... to escape what we've learned in Vietnam, to not come to the logical conclusions of what's happened there.
You know, the military does the same thing.
They don't realize that, um, people fighting for their own freedom... uh, are not gonna be stopped... by just changing your tactics, adding a little bit more sophisticated technology over here, improving the tactics we used last time, not making quite the same mistakes.
Uh, you know, I think history operates a little different than that.
And I think that those kind of forces are not gonna be stopped.
I think Americans have worked extremely hard... not to see, uh, the criminality, uh, that their officials and their policy makers, uh, have exhibited.
Number one! Number one!
It's your country, not a toilet, you bastards!
They oughta go to Cuba. That's where they belong. Or Russia.
Boo!
You motherfuckers!
Man, let me talk to somebody.
I was in Vietnam.
I was a platoon leader over there.
What is this?
What the hell is this?
We were the ones that got shot.
You guys were over there too with your damn cameras.
Holy... Make my day!
Come on, smile a little bit!
Come on! Smile! Smile!
Be happy! Smile!
Everything isn't bad!
The film you are about to see is based on documented facts.
The atrocities shown were performed as "medical experiments" -
-In special camps in the Third Reich.
The crimes are historically accurate-
-But the film's characters are compos of several notorious Nazis.
They showed the events were collected to a place of dramatic account.
Because of the shocking subject father movie is only for adults.
The film is dedicated to the hope of that these atrocities never happen again.
- Yes!
- No, not yet!
No, please! No!
You would have expected.
The weather today will be mostly fine.
In the north, it gets a little chilly and it becomes essentially clear.
It's time to go now.
Go where?
Heading south, we have temperatures ...
- With them.
-Get dressed!
- Ilsa, you promised ...
-What did you call me?
Ilsa. I mean commandant.
Fräulein doctor.
It was better.
Much better.
You said I'd never return to camp before.
It would not be the same, you say!
- Yes ...
-Why there for me?
You had the honor to lie with a German woman.
An SS officer. You, a laborer, belonging to an inferior race!
- Do you dare to challenge me?
I say nothing, commandant.
That is true.
Let me stay here with you.
I give you great pleasure.
- Like an animal in heat!
No, as a lover.
You bastard! How dare you say that word to me?
But last night promised you ...
That you would not return to camp before.
It was everything I promised.
Bring him.
When a prisoner has slept with me-
- Is he never with a woman.
If he survives he remembers only the pain from the knife.
- Knife?
-As castrate you.
No!
- Begin!
No, commandant.
No! No, Commander!
No! No, Commander! No!
I will finish it.
There is a doctor Baum in Berlin.
He believes that the inferior races proves their inferiority-
-With a certain body part.
Can you guess which body part?
It makes a man a man.
The doctor has a collection-
-That proves his theory and ...
Your ... will be send-
-To him.
No!
You see, little man.
I have kept my promise.
You see again never camp again.
- How many this time?
Get out, quick!
Down!
Get out, bitch! Quick!
Out with you! Fort now!
Forward!
Stand up!
- They expect miracles in five days.
-Someone has to say that is too many.
Our research is important than their sterilization.
Deon is most important in all camps.
Every job is different.
It is significant.
You need not be afraid.
This is not Dachau, no Ravensbruck.
We are doctors and will help you.
Your stay with us will be brief, but you father a chance to serve the Third Reich.
It is your destiny.
Welcome to Camp 9!
This way, girls. Harat!
Then we start.
Come, my child.
- Remove clothing. We do not see.
I am ashamed.
Shame?
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
We need you to know what work we'll give you.
We are doctors.
- How old are you, friend?
-18, Fräulein doctor.
- Excellent
Thanks, fräulein doctor.
Commandant?
- Have you decided?
I do not know ...
- Hardly labor, huh?
-I am strong.
I can work with whatever you want and is not afraid to take in.
It's good. Great.
Stop! You were not allowed to go.
- I thought ...
-You think you can not, you obey.
Do you understand?
- Yes, what then?
-Yes ...
... Fräulein doctor.
For you it will be that door.
Next!
- Go, go!
-Fräulein doctor ...
- What do those women with?
-What?
- Those who enter there.
-They will be retrained.
To earn the Third Reich soldiers.
- And I?
-You will earn kingdom otherwise.
You will help our medical research and thereby saving thousands of lives.
Right.
What is your name?
Rosette, fräulein doctor.
Rosette?
I will not forget it.
You there! Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Come on!
No. ...
You will when I tell you.
No! Stop it!
Let me be!
You must obey orders! Do you understand?
Or would you like more tea?
Give the bitch to me.
I'll shave her so close to skin-
-That the blood flowing.
- Leave her alone!
I'll teach her!
No, she gets their lesson last night.
Tonight she will work in the guardhouse.
Our research is too important.
I implore you to inspect it.
General, if I replace the procedure now-
-Delayed all our experiments.
General, our discoveries will change the outcome of the war.
Yes, General.
Yes, mein General.
That was good news.
Then the general judge it yourself.
And, General, I ...
I conducts its own research
-That probably interests you most.
Thank you, General.
Heil Hitler.
- Hello.
-Welcome. My name is Kala.
This is Irene.
Get out!
Get out!
Quick!
Quick!
Achtung!
Achtung, commandant.
- You are blond.
I was born in Germany.
- Addressing the commandant with respect!
He learns, sergeant, he learns.
- Are you German?
I am American, commandant.
American? Why are not you in a POW camp?
I read in Germany when my country declared war.
- I have been in camp since.
-Your Country? You are German!
There was I not over, commandant.
Take them.
- I'm ready.
-Cruising!
Quick!
Dr. Baum will be very pleased.
And you call yourselves men?
I see no manhood between your legs.
You, the oäkte German!
It is clearly visible that your blood is tainted.
This is not a real Aryans built.
Size is not everything, commandant.
Does not it?
We'll see.
I have only one thing to add.
Inmates found to to speak with patients becoming whipped.
Even the woman.
- Why all sleep?
They've been infected with the bacteria.
Typhoid, tetanus, rabies.
All known fatal diseases.
- Leaving the them there to die?
No, that would be too merciful.
- They develop experimental drugs.
-Medicaments ...
- Do they work? Fines of them?
-If they were to die of the disease ...
... They had died with less pain.
And you, Kala ... What did they give you?
Syphilis.
The only question is when I will die.
God can not help one here.
He has forgotten this place.
- The third?
-Yes.
- No changes?
-Only the pulse, commandant.
Berlin laughed at my theory.
Soon I'll give them documented evidence.
- Then they laugh no more.
-They do not want to believe it.
No, they're men.
It is unthinkable for them that a carefully trained woman-
-Withstand more pain than any man.
- What is this camp?
What it is?
- Gateway to Hell.
-What do they do with all women?
The sterilized and then sent to the field brothels.
- Oh my God!
-They might be lucky.
- Lucky?
-Yes. There are others.
The selected few.
They are taken by the commandant.
- Why?
I do not know.
She has a room in his home.
No one knows what she is doing there.
But the women never return.
Though soon it will not matter.
- How can you say so?
-Because, my friend ...
You get enough of their own problems.
Problems? We are well here just to work, huh?
No.
That time will-
-When Black Widow sends after you.
Castrated? Why?
Maybe it's her way to punish the man-
-That makes her to feel as a woman-
-But that nevertheless still her thirst for more. Who knows?
Only one thing is certain: when he has served her-
-He is out of that one.
You too?
- Yes, I had her one night.
-Mario ...
It is better to live as half-man of the moment.
Why?
In order to get revenge.
I live only for revenge.
It may come sooner than you think.
- What do you mean?
-The Allies approaching fast.
- How fast? When will they?
I do not know. But soon, Mario.
I've been waiting for weeks.
I can wait even longer.
Until my time comes.
Mario ...
- Cut her out of your ...
-No.
It had ...
Destroyed ... Dr. Baum's theory.
Up!
Why?
Have you already forgotten, sweetheart?
Where are you taking me?
You will be working in the night.
- The guard barracks.
-No.
- Please, no!
It's too late to repent.
Get up!
- Heil Hitler!
-Heil.
Commandant, a worker has just caught talking to a girl.
- What area is she in?
Sterilizers, commandant.
- Excellent. You can go.
-Commandant's special room?
- You!
-Good.
You are not like pigs they usually send to us.
You are different.
So warm, so smooth.
Are you a tigress?
Do you resisting?
You have to kill me first!
Hardly.
Save your strength, dear.
Doctor ...
We are both from Poland. We talked if every country - no more.
You are strong. Stronger than he.
- Help me, doctor.
-You have to help yourself.
Begin!
For them and hang them up.
It discourages the other pigs.
When you finished ...
Download American to me.
You are so strong.
So though.
You are beautiful.
I need you.
I need to feel you in me.
I will satisfy you.
Empty promises ...
Attention, Alert-
There is a red alert.
Hostile flight ...
I will satisfy you until you beg me to stop.
Do it then.
Interference harder!
Not now! No!
Now!
Harder!
Makes me ill!
Now!
Not yet.
Not yet.
Attention!
Red preparedness is now called off.
There is now a blue alert.
We resume broadcasts.
We continue with a selection of music the Kingdom's finest ...
Not more!
Oh no ...
Please.
You are made of iron.
Oh my God. Did you kill her?
No.
You see ...
When I hit puberty, I noticed something that separated me from the other guys.
Something that made me unique, I guess.
Outstanding.
What? What was it?
It is very simple.
I discovered that I can hold back as long as I want.
I can still.
All night if necessary.
You could call me a freak of nature.
A kind of human-machine
-Who can set the controls pa "fast," "slower" ...
... Or "never."
Oh my God.
Want to know something?
Never switch made her almost insane.
Never.
Never! I do not use like an animal.
Help us Kala.
There must be a way to accommodate.
You guys are crazy.
But the guards are so few.
Why would they need more?
This is a world of crippled, broken women.
They have lost their strength-
And their dignity.
- There's nothing to do.
-Then we must take over the camp.
Before it becomes our turn.
It was the only chance.
- An uprising?
-Yes.
They crush us like flies.
No. Rosette is right.
It would be the last thing they expect.
- Anna, most can barely walk.
But we can.
Until they start on you.
We still have some where on us.
You need help.
By whom?
The workers.
They move everywhere in the camp.
Only they can help us.
In the evening, Mario. It is very important.
Achtung!
The next few days you should go through a series of tests.
They show everything we need to know if your bodies-
-Before you have to participate the research project.
I advise you to cooperate fully.
If you refuse to make diet you will be punished severely.
It was one of you experienced at night.
You are here to serve the Third Reich.
It is your sole function.
Begin.
- Please, go. They see you.
-Can you make it?
- Yes. Join now.
What's your name?
- Rosette.
My name Wolfe.
I know that.
Up!
- No, the commandant. I have pain.
-Evil?
You do not know what evil is.
But we'll show you.
Go!
Please commandant. Please.
Spread your legs.
Do I need to say to everyone.
Go!
- We have much to learn from them, Bintz.
Yes, mein commandant.
So there is the strong?
Pain then? Are you afraid of pain?
Who does not, commandant?
We'll see.
De: is clear. Go!
I think that we have found the right one, Bintz.
The one we've been waiting for.
6000m, commandant.
Luftwaffe may owe a lot to us.
It's been 50 minutes; commandant.
Reduce pressure by five pounds.
- How hot is it now?
-82 Degrees, mein Ketel.
- And for how long?
-Ten minutes.
- And her values?
-Absolutely no change.
Then we have to move on.
- Increase by five degrees.
-Five? But ...
Our soldiers are dying in the inferno to be burning tanks.
It is for their sake we do it.
For the Motherland.
Five degrees.
No one can perform for you.
No.
- Do you think it was a dream?
I do not know.
You have to prove it to them.
- How about you?
'I SGI' on.
I must know the truth.
Mario ...
This is Anna.
Anna.
And Rosette.
- Rosette.
-Hey.
Kala ...
I will!
The map is just a rough, but you have to learn it by heart.
Now you, my beautiful commandant.
- This time it will be different.
-Say.
Take off your clothes. I want you to undress
When I sit and look at you.
No!
Slowly.
Show yourself to me - slowly.
Slowly.
You are beautiful, Ilsa.
Hello! Hitler!
I must go now, but whenever you need me ...
When victory is ours, we do children.
They are beautiful.
And strong.
- They are determined.
Who is their leader?
- The new - Anna.
-Yes.
I said they can die as cattle.
I warned them.
Maybe not.
Thank you, General.
Heil Hitler!
He will most certainly.
The General himself.
He has promised - finally.
Now he'll see for himself all the work we do here.
And how important it here.
And my own forskninog ...
He'll see it too.
Every day that we're wasting on not daring to do so-
-Us closer to that room.
I can not wait for the butcher's knife.
Mario will find a solution.
If you do not help me-
-I hold myself at night, over the fence there!
- Really?
She did not mean it, commandant.
I'm going to say that General Waldeck come here-
And hear you encourage people to accommodate.
Nothing to say?
You think I'm stupid?!
- Ingrid ...
Yes, commandant?
- The punishment for escape attempts?
-But she ...
Quiet!
A prisoner convicted of that offense to be flogged to death before the whole camp.
- I'm not afraid.
-Good.
Great.
It is better to die than ...
I'm not going punish you that way.
No ...
I have something special in store for you.
You are so brave, you fear nothing ...
But we'll see?
We'll see ...
And General ... shall see.
It is said that fear of pain is greater than the pain itself.
Do you know what this is?
Sure looks harmless?
What happens if I put it on fire?
Then maybe ...
... It becomes something completely different, right?
Not as harmless anymore, huh?
Reply when I'm talking to you!
Do you still feel nothing?
But soon it will burn deep within you.
It consumes you.
It distorts your meat.
- Does she not sent for you?
-No.
- Why not? O
She's well else to think about.
She must be cracked.
No one can so much pain.
That's more than four hours now.
Only she can prove my theory.
Why?
No screams. Not even a sound.
Take her back to her hut.
Her barracks, commander?
She'll be back later.
But first ...
First, I want everyone to see her.
It serves as a warning.
- We have so little tig for preparation.
-The girls have so little time.
Some have less than that.
How much more can she?
Up! Quick!
No ...
You think you can hold out.
You are wrong.
You will be screaming for mercy.
You beg me to stop.
I'd rather die.
More!
More! The bitch should feel it.
- Irene, Kala - this is Wolfe.
-Hey.
Hello.
This is what I learned today ...
Here is the big gate and sentry box.
This switch must be killed first.
- He's here?
I'll take care of him.
- What's this?
-Guards' barracks.
- We still need weapons, Wolfe.
-We leave them.
- When? O
-The morning after the General Act.
- You know what you should do?
-Yes.
You!
You, American!
Come on!
- You talked.
No, commandant.
You helped the bitch.
- Do not look at me like that.
I can not be lazy to remember.
In the evening - when the general sleeping.
If you come to me?
- Yes.
-Will it be like before?
Better, commandant.
Achtung! Heil Hitler!
Welcome to Camp 9, General.
A pleasure to meet fräulein major.
The reports on your charm and your beauty was not excessive.
- The General is too friendly.
-Not at all.
May I introduce my adjutant Captain Richter.
- Commandant.
-Well, sir ... What have you to show us?
Wait here.
I have very much liked to see
General my experiments.
- Do you use no nakors?
Ger-man experimental caviar?
But five there, General, is too short a time.
It's war, fräulein major.
We all have to sacrifice something.
Yes, General.
And these ...
... Masks-
-Has been infected with a new strain typhoid?
Yes, General.
So she gets ...
Vector ...?
In two weeks she rubs it all and everyone she comes in contact with.
Gott im Himmel!
You can destroy an army!
The wound is infected with gangrene reply.
Gas gangrene?
It kills many brave men.
Soon, not for long.
Have you discovered an antidote?
We see many encouraging signs.
It's only a matter of time.
Verdammt! Time ...
It is always a matter of time.
And now, General, my own private experiments.
You will find it very interesting.
For three nights, general, and all that without a single scream.
No man had endured such a pain.
She proves everything in my theory.
Not just everything, fräulein major.
This is a camp for medical research.
You must not waste time Germany on your private projects.
- But ...
-Momentl
- Could not you break her?
We tried everything.
It seems so.
Well. I will present your evidence for Reichsführer itself.
Now we just get women on hazardous items.
But if you are right ...
Thank you, General.
Macht nichts.
Tonight we a special surprise for you.
Then there will be two surprises.
Because I have one for you too.
Achtung!
Remarkably.
Remarkable!
But her legs ... They are so cool.
- As marble.
-Yes.
Looking forward, General.
When we eat ...
Exactly.
I thought it would amuse you.
Lovely! Lovely!
Cold pain or destruction!
In reich Führer Heinrich Himmler name I give you this order.
Reichsführerns is cross-
-The highest award that can be given to someone in the SS.
Reichsführer shows hereby its recognition and praise-
-The great dedication you have shown in-
-In the service of the Third Reich.
Heil Hitler!
- Sends her after you?
She said that.
Oh, Wolfe ...
- I'm so scared.
-I know.
And you with her ...
I do not think about stuff like that.
Rosette, listen to me.
Just think about tomorrow and what must be done.
Nothing more. Okay?
Yes, Wolfe.
And after that ... freedom.
Free hot?
- With you?
-Yes.
That's not a workbench!
Me first!
Then all of you!
It was an unforgettable evening.
Cheers!
It was a pleasure to have the general here.
We leave here tomorrow morning.
Shortly after dawn.
So early?
Duty first.
Of course, General.
-But no ceremonies.
I only go when I'm done.
Can I help further the general?
Yes ...
No. No!
Not coat.
Just pants.
The briefs also.
Yes ...
The boots ...
Put them on again.
Fraulein Ilsa ...
Do you understand?
You are like a blonde ...
... Goddess.
Mother Earth for all of us.
For me ...
... Is only one way.
One way to pleasure.
Do you understand?
Come on, please.
Come on.
I love you!
You have to ...
Now.
"On the meadow!
Wolfe?
But, commandant ...
Get him.
I need a real man.
This is Radio Deutschland nation voting ends for Tonight.
-Damn!
-Yes!
Reports from our enemy distort the truth-
-In an attempt plumt to force our people to surrender.
- Do not believe these lies.
-Different?
Yes, Ilsa.
Everything we've done before ...
All enjoyment.
All ecstasy.
It will be forgotten.
Show me how. Show me!
Your socks, Ilsa.
Go get your silk stockings.
... Developed a new fighter.
Heinke 162 reaches to speeds of 1000 km / h.
These planes may soon be in-
And then add the enemy yet another devastating blow.
- We continue; with ...
-Lie on the bed, Ilsa.
No, Ilsa!
- I thought ...
-I asked you not to think!
I ordered you to lie on the bed.
Do as I say, Ilsa.
Out with arms and legs now.
Fort. Quick!
No, not fast, Ilsa.
Slowly, step by step.
First wrists. Then the feet.
Hard, Ilsa. It has to be tight.
Only then can you be my slave.
My love slave.
- I am your slave.
-It would not you?
Yes ...
You are trying to escape from me-
-But you will find no protection.
- Soon, soon.
-Pray for mercy.
Ask me quit.
Do you feel the ecstasy, Ilsa?
- Should I hurt you?
-Oh, yes.
Makes me sick. Was Cruel.
Be Cruel!
- What are you doing?
-Ensures that you will not loose.
I'm ready now.
Good.
Attention!
There is now a red alert.
I'll be back.
- You did not stay so long now.
That's right.
Go ahead of me quiet and nice, otherwise you get a big hole in your stomach!
- No, it was not me!
-Come on!
Get off me!
Get them here!
Help me-
Attention! There is a red alert.
Hostile aircraft approaching.
- We have to go out and all that fast.
-One thing must be done first!
What?
Revenge. Let those who tormented us ...
Themselves ... to feel pain!
No, Kala.
- If you release them free?
We give them to the Allies.
They are brought to justice, I swear.
Before the right one? What they gave us for justice?
In five months I've been here.
They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ...
- Let's go to the mountains.
-Goodbye, friends. God be with you.
Mario, come with us!
What life awaits a half man outside the fence?
Attention! Red readiness now called off.
There is now a blue alert.
We resume broadcasts.
... And betraying their national duties loss of both life and honor.
... Communications and transport centers must be defended to the last-
-Without regard to the enemy lines.
Local commanders held personally liable for this.
They are sentenced to death for negligence in that respect.
General?
Your orders have been executed.
Camp 9 has ceased to exist.
You can communicate Reichsführer-
-That the Allies did not find anything.
They must never know anything.
Hello, Captain Six, this is Sky watch Two.
We've got 30 to 40 vector. Charlie's in open.
One five zero meters south of yellow smoke.
Be aware Red Lake Fire Base.
Danger, close target.
Roger, I have yellow smoke in sight.
This is Sky watch. Come on in.
And save your steel.
We'll use softies on this one.
Roger.
Now, Phantom, watch your direction.
You're a little close.
You're too close, Phantom.
Phantom, you're too close.
Go round and abort mission.
Too late, I've released.
Watch out, base. You'd better duck.
It's going to get mighty hot down there.
Help!
Incoming! Incoming!
Dear Marge.
I'm coming home.
I remember your saying when I left that people were dying and that
I was crapping around with fate to come here.
You were more right than you could imagine.
Let me tell you the latest.
Military Command has decided that elephants are enemy agents because they carry supplies for the Viet cong.
So now we're stampeding the elephants and gunning them down from the air.
Of, course I filed a suitably outraged story about it.
But that was my last one.
I have no more cheap morals to draw from all this death.
So I have taken action.
An old friend from my marine days will be coming to see you soon.
His name is Ray Hicks.
We owe him $1,000.
I want you to pay him.
I have started something here that I can't stop.
And it's the right thing, I know
You see, in a world where elephants are pursued by flying men, people are just naturally going to want to get high.
I'll explain when I see you.
And you'll understand.
Charmian?
Hello, John.
Hi, Charmian. Did the man deliver?
He surely did. You just missed him.
I kind of wanted you to meet him.
He's an impressive little fellow.
Take off those muddy boots, will you, sport?
When you see guys like that you know that it's all worthwhile.
Colonel Tho used to be a very gung ho soldier.
He says it's us came over here and corrupted him.
Oh, he thinks we made him deal smack?
People can be corrupted, John.
Are you high?
Just a little boo with mon colonel.
You want to try it?
A weird time to get high.
Why?
Are you scared?
Yep.
You've got to be the world's most frightened man, John.
I don't know how you live with yourself.
I sometimes think of that myself.
How's this for terrifying?
Do you want to count it?
I trust you.
My friends are going to have
$25,000 waiting for you.
That's a nice return on a small investment.
Did you weigh it?
I didn't have to. It's two kilograms.
You don't get burned with heroin, by getting short weight. They cut it on you.
They're not going to burn me,
Johnny. Believe me.
Don't think about it.
You're doing the right thing, Johnny.
Yes, I am.
What about your old lady in Berkeley?
- She...
- We don't have to talk about that.
It's all set, Charmian.
But you see, sport, we don't know her.
I mean maybe there's a side to her character that even you don't know about.
In all modesty, there isn't.
All right. It's your dope.
Yeah.
How much are your friends going to make out of this?
I don't know.
Maybe a couple of hundred thousand.
Depends on how they cut it,
I don't want their trouble.
Who are they?
Not the sort of people you might think.
You used to have some funny friends in Washington.
People keep in touch.
What are you going to do with your money, Johnny?
Such a dedicated non-swinger as you are.
I don't know.
Shit, you don't know, do you?
You just know you want it, right?
"I desire to serve God and to grow rich like all men."
Who said that?
I don't know.
Some great hustler of the past.
Well, I'm sitting here
Thinking about those Philadelphia Fillies
And some may think I'm talking about baseball
But I'm talking about the ones that wear them dresses on so pretty
And the way they swing should be against the law
There's a lot of dangerous curves in that beautiful city
Oh, but you'll never see no warning signs
And if you want to get right down to the nitty-gritty...
Let's see your brownie, man.
Where are you from in the world?
California.
You're going the right way, man, if you want pictures.
Charley's got skin diving sapper girls, you know that?
They swim out from the beaches with charges in their teeth.
Stick them on the hulls of those big AKs, and wham!
How's you like a picture of that action?
Get out of there, you little fuckers.
What I think about.
I think about catching myself a little sapper girl and fucking her to death.
I'm a vicious freak.
You know what else they got?
They got porpoises trained to kill gooks.
This is a very strange war.
Yeah, it's weird, man.
We're not supposed to talk about it.
I'll be right back.
Holy Christ, you made it.
Sure I did.
You know when I talked to you the other night I thought you were drunk.
I was.
How'd you get in the base?
Oh, I'm doing a story on merchant seamen.
Sure you are. We'll go get a beer.
Hey, I've got something for you.
No shit.
Sappers?
 There ain't no sappers.
That's all a beautiful hoax.
Hey, you remember Macklin From Pendleton?
The C.O.?
Yeah.
Sure, I remember.
I saw him last month in Oakland.
Told him you were a big time reporter now.
How do you get along with the Marines down here?
Fine, we get along fine.
Don't they want you to re-up?
Not these guys not for this one.
You still into this?
Yeah.
Jesus, that's fucking piquant.
Piquant? I don't know what the hell that means. You turned me on with that book.
Yeah, I used to do stuff like that, didn't I? It's a good book.
You look terrible, John. You look like hell.
Is that for me?
That's the sorriest piece of packaging
I've ever seen. What've you got in there?
It's two keys of scag.
Do you know what you're saying?
I didn't think we were that way.
We're that way.
You sound like we never talked about this.
I thought you'd have something else for me.
You said you wanted to carry weight. I got you weight.
I carry grass. Not that shit.
If your stash is as good as you say it is, it'll be easier than carrying grass.
I'll give you a thousand now, and my wife has another thousand for you in Berkeley.
You deliver and you split. It's that simple.
It's bad karma.
Look, I have reason to believe that this operation concerns Washington.
No, no, I don't mean Washington, I mean certain individuals. They know about you.
They checked you out.
What the hell are you trying to do to me, huh?
They absolutely won't bother you.
You're not supposed to know about them and they won't fuck with you if you deliver.
If I deliver, right. But if I don't deliver?
If I take you off because I happen to know you're an asshole
- then the roof falls in, Washington time?
- Ray, if you don't...
Listen, if wanted to keep a carrier honest,
I might make up a bullshit story about Washington but I would never lay it on a friend.
It sucks.
You can't say no, Ray.
You're really scared, aren't you?
I'm impressed.
Look, I'm a very timid person.
I'm a virtual paranoid.
If this weren't stone cool
I wouldn't go near it.
You can carry it, you know I can't.
Your ship sails tomorrow.
Okay, I'll carry your scag, Johnny.
Hell, why not? A little adrenaline cleans the blood.
But make sure I get treated right.
Self-defense is an art I cultivate.
Thanks.
Why are you doing this?
I don't know, I...
I feel like this is the first real thing
I have ever done in my life.
I don't know what the other stuff was about.
Don't they say that this is where everybody finds out who they are, huh?
Yeah? What a bummer for the gooks.
Three, five, seven, four, five.
Okay, we'll take two of those.
- Edna, would you take care of Tommy?
- Oh, sure.
Bender Books, can I help you?
See, he's gonna be speaking here on the 19th.
- Can I talk to Marge?
- This is Marge.
This is Ray.
- Who?
- Ray Hicks.
Can you hold on a minute?
I want to take this in the office.
Is that a personal call?
No, No. Stay here.
- Hello.
- I'm here.
Uh, you're a friend of John's, right?
You got somebody with you, Marge?
Uh, my father's here.
Have you seen John?
I'll call by your place tomorrow.
Everything okay?
What do you mean?
I said tomorrow. Your place.
Are you going to be ready for me?
Well, is John all right?
He's fine. Are you going to be ready for me?
Oh. yeah. Sure, you mean the money he owes you?
- What time?
- Tomorrow night, 9:00.
Yeah.
Is something wrong with John?
No, no. It's fine.
He's coming home in a few days.
- Marge.
- Mmm-hmm?
Was that a friend of John's?
I guess so. I feel kind of deranged.
What are you doing?
I'm taking a pill. A pill.
You said you were going to try to stop.
There seems to be a problem of motivation.
- Goodnight, Edna.
- Marge, just a minute.
- Yeah?
- I got this for Janey.
I thought it was so cute.
Oh, it's got a lot of candy in it, I suppose.
Yeah, well, I'll send you the dental bill.
No, she'll like it. She really will.
- Marge.
- Give her a kiss for me.
Yeah?
Why didn't you tell me John was coming back?
I'm just not up for another round of talks about his character, his future or his general attitude.
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. How about bringing Janey down for the weekend.
Will you think about that?
Yeah, that'll be nice.
Listen, Janey, how would you like to spend the weekend with your grandpa?
I can't.
Oh, yeah. Why not?
I want to go to Edna's.
But you can't spend the weekend with Edna. We...
Oh, that's the phone.
Can I have this because they threw it away?
Yeah, sure.
Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Converse.
Oh, let me, let me write that down. Hold on.
- Yeah.
- Can we buy a little fish?
Can we buy a little fish.
Wait. Just a minute, honey.
Uh-huh. I got that. Okay, thank you.
Can we buy a little fish?
Yeah, sure.
- Guess what?
- What? Tell me what?
Daddy's coming home early.
Hi, another one please.
Did you have a good trip?
Yeah, pretty good.
They still got a lot of good pussy over there?
Yeah.
When do you go back?
I want to put some bread by and go down to Mexico for a while.
Mexico, that's a good place.
Hey, tonight
Gonna be tonight
Don't you know I'm flying, tonight
What a lot of shit this place is now.
There was a kitchen at the back of the pool table?
What the hell happened to the pool tables?
You got to change with the times.
The times are fucked.
Why do I get to sit around and look at these poor junkies.
I'd just as soon look at you out there.
I ain't got no costume.
You got bigger tits.
Watch me now
Jody's gonna get religion
All night long
Hey, come on
Gonna hear the sun
Hey, Alex.
Kid over there by wall, know him?
Nope.
Is he a new face?
We got nothing but new faces here.
When did you say you were going to Mexico.
I didn't say I was going to Mexico.
Yes, you did. You said you were going.
It's a dream.
Johnny. Oh, Johnny.
He's going to deliver.
Man, I wouldn't have.
Way to go, Raymond. Way to go.
Very cute.
What's going on?
Oh, back door action.
Take it easy, don't be afraid.
- What do you want?
- Don't be afraid.
- Who are you?
- I'm Ray Hicks.
I'm the guy that phoned you.
Why did you come in that way?
I don't understand.
Somebody's been on my ass all day.
What are you doing?
I don't know whether
I lost them or not. Do you understand?
Uh...
Wait. You're John's friend, right?
And you're the one who phoned?
That's right. I'll take my money and run.
Oh, I don't have it.
Why not?
Well, I mean, I don't have it here.
- Today's been kind of difficult.
- You said you'd be ready.
Well, I know but I had to take my little girl to the aquarium.
And the bank was closed.
You dumb cooze. What are you, a junkie?
Do I look like a junkie?
That's not always a factor.
- Look, John will be home tomorrow.
- What is this shit?
You said you'd be ready.
Now you didn't tell me
John was coming home early.
- Well, I didn't know.
- What are you trying to do, fuck me over?
You and some other people, huh, Marge?
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
Now, listen to me. If I beat up on you and took your smack I'd be within my rights, because you can't deal with people in this outrageous fucking manner.
I don't have any smack.
I don't know who you are. Look.
If you want money
I'll give you the cash I've got.
Your old man has got shit for brains.
You got a good place to stash this?
What is it?
That's smack. That's two keys. It's never been cut. I'm carrying it for John.
That's why you owe me money.
What am I supposed to do with it? I work in a book store, for Christ's sake.
You're supposed to hold on to it.
Your Johnny's made some new friends.
You're a couple of marks, you and John.
What do you mean, marks?
The people you're dealing with are going to see that right away.
What people? I don't know who you're talking about.
You will.
Oh, he's really in bad shape.
You know he can't even roll a joint.
I mean, he never cared about money.
He must have just flipped out over there.
He's not the only one.
Look, I don't know if he told you or not but we do have a child.
Now, can't you just take it somewhere else?
No, Marge, I can't take it somewhere else.
How long is he going to be in there, man?
I think he's dicking her, that's what I think.
I'm going outside for a minute.
I've got a bottle in the car.
I'll be right back.
Oh, look, look, look.
What's he doing? What's he going inside for?
I think he made us.
Come on. Get the back door.
Shit.
- What's going on?
- We've got company.
Go in the back and stay with your kid.
- What are you doing?
- Do what I say.
Whatever happens don't answer that front door.
- Mummy.
- It's all right.
- What's going on?
- It's all right
I can't get the door open.
What the fuck is going on?
I'll kill you quick!
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, man, okay!
Don't move.
Give me that hand. Give it to me.
Get down.
Now, I want you to just stay in bed.
Raymond, you fucker!
Raymond, this isn't about you man.
You weren't even supposed to be involved!
Shut up!
You ever seen these guys before?
- No. Who are they?
- Mommy?
They're take-off artistes.
That's who they are.
Mommy!
Mummy, don't go away.
Don't leave me alone in here.
It's all right.
Raymond? Raymond, listen to me, man.
There's no deal it's just us.
Get up.
You were just supposed to make the drop, man.
We got no problem with you.
All right, all right. Come on...
Raymond, will you listen?
Marge! Come in here.
Marge!
Marge!
- Get in here.
- Oh, shit, this is theft, man!
You're gonna pay for this.
You fucking... He's gonna pay for it.
He's gonna burn!
Hey, don't involve yourself in a disaster.
It's just her and her husband, a couple of idiots.
Nobody would pay them. Would you?
Marge, get his keys.
Hey, look. What are you getting for this run? A couple of grand?
I'll double it. For Christ's sake!
I'm doing a favor for a buddy.
How are you going to double that?
Give me the keys.
Maybe I ought to kill you fellows.
It wouldn't help.
I might feel better.
You're going to end up in the bag.
You know that?
Pick up that gun.
Pick up that gun!
You're in big trouble if you touch that gun, lady.
It's 30 years. We're federal agents.
Are they?
No. They're the people John was expecting.
Give me that.
Lady, you and your kid are going to regret this.
- I swear it.
- Get the kid. We're getting out.
- Oh, let's give it to them.
- They'd kill us anyway.
That's an intelligent young lady.
Can't you hear what she says, man?
I'm calling the cops.
Now listen to me.
You call the cops, they'll nail you.
They'll nail John.
They'll take your kid away. It's your dope.
Now you grab anything that might say where we're going.
Pack some stuff for yourself and the kid.
I'll be back in a minute.
Wild turkey, come in, please.
We're getting wild, Turkey, what's the...
Is she okay?
I don't know. She's exhausted.
You got some place you can leave her? Some place safe?
Are you crazy? I'm not leaving her anywhere.
What, do you think those guys are going to forget about you?
Every bum in the state's going to be looking for that smack.
Oh, Jesus.
Come on, Marge, maybe we can get clear.
But not with your kid along.
I can't leave her.
You saw those guys.
They'll kill her if they have to.
You want her to have a better chance than we've got you leave her some place safe.
Edna?
- Edna, I need help.
- Marge, what is it?
Come in.
- I thought you were...
- Come on, get in.
- Where are we going?
- I know what you thought.
Are you going to tell me where we're going?
I gotta place in LA.
We'll be there in eight hours.
As long as I remember
The rain been comin' down
Clouds of mystery pourin'
Confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages
Tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
I went down Virginia
Seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow
We should warn John.
Shouldn't we?
What are you going to tell him?
Go back to Saigon?
That's 8:00 a.m. Rock at Los Angeles for the beat of KF.R.H.
Stay here.
Ray?
What happened?
Neighborhood freaks. Could have been worse.
Could have been a body in this bag.
The big ones eat the little ones up here.
Come on. Welcome to LA.
Marge.
Is Janey all right?
- I talked to Edna.
- Yeah.
Your father's sending Janey to his brother's place in Canada.
She's been there before. She loves it there.
It's a farm, you know.
It's perfect, you did the right thing.
Then Edna came at 8:00 in the morning with Janey.
Where are they now?
Marge is hiding some place
God knows where, Janey's in Canada.
What's she doing in Canada?
I sent her there because her parents are criminals.
She's with Arthur.
What the hell are you doing dealing in heroin? Have you lost your mind?
Maybe. How much do you know?
There was a man here this morning named Antheil.
A federal agent who talks like a lawyer.
He asked me did I knew my daughter was caught up in a narcotics ring.
- They're already after us.
- They have got you.
I have been waiting all my life to fuck up like this.
Well, you finally made the big time.
I can't believe I did this.
A sense of unreality is not a legal defense.
If Marge is safe she'll call.
Where are you going?
I'm going home. It's all I can do.
Stay away from the house.
Then what the fuck am I supposed to do?
Run. Don't try any heroics.
They haven't heard from John, have they?
Oh, God. Can you imagine what Janey's going through.
When I was a kid once I had days like that.
No, not like that.
You wait till I tell you the story of my life. You'll eat your heart out.
How did you turn out?
Well, your husband once told somebody I was a psychopath.
Yes, that's the kind of thing he'd say.
You think he could be right?
It's a very imprecise term.
Hey, bubi. Hey.
Come on. Get him in the car.
I shot a guy in the gut one time in Nam.
It don't kill ya.
If I'd been there by myself
I'd have given it to them.
That's what we should have done, we should have just given it to them.
It isn't yours any more.
Well, who's is it?
It belongs to whoever controls it.
So is it yours now?
You know if you wanted to rip it off you should have done it before.
You never should have shown up with it.
I can see where you could be a real pain in the ass.
Oh, would you like me to go home?
Well, I would love to do that, but I can't.
Come on, Marge, you and John fucked up.
Don't give me your regrets.
You think I want that shit?
I never moved that stuff in my life.
Wait a minute.
Maybe we could sell it to them after all.
Try it again.
You know, they offered you a deal.
We could still make one.
Shut it off.
We could still make a deal!
Who's we?
They know what fuck ups we are.
They've got their pride.
I don't think we could pull it off.
Well, I think they're fuck ups too.
They're animals.
You can't make a deal with animals.
Well, why don't we just leave it? Bury it.
- No!
- And just...
All my life I have been taking shit from inferior people. No more!
When I left the marines
I made myself a promise.
Never again am I going to be fucked around by morons.
The next mother who tries to make me back off is going to have to live it out with me.
You're not playing this right, John.
You've got to learn to identify with your captors. Like those guys in Korea.
What'd he say?
He said "Where is what?"
Okay.
Okay, John. Come on, up you get.
That's a good boy.
Here you go. You'll love this.
What's it say?
"In danger all that counts is going forward."
What else?
"By growing used to danger a man can allow it to become part of him."
"He grows used to evil."
Is that what happened to John?
Are we going to talk about him?
When you knew Johnny in the marines, what was he like?
In some ways he was beautiful.
In some ways he had his head up his ass.
Like this number here.
Drink with me?
Why did you carry for him?
Because he asked me.
I don't always have to have a reason for the shit I do.
Why are you taking these?
Pain.
Bullshit. You got a habit, Marge. How much?
I don't know.
I guess, I'm doing too much.
That's my last one.
Are we going to stay here?
No. We're gonna try and move that stuff.
Where is she?
Where is she, bubi?
I don't know. I swear.
Hey, I've seen your lady, John, she's big.
Big? She's not big.
Let me tell you how it is, John.
I was humiliated in front of your wife.
Your friend Raymond chained me to a toilet.
The bastard thought it was funny.
Hey, you know, your old lady's fucking that guy right now.
Moaning and groaning. On the floor, on the bed. Upside down, sideways.
What's this for? You making pasta?
You could scald yourself, schmuck.
Pour it out.
We'll do what I said? Leave the heat on.
Let me tell you about your pal, John.
He looked at me, see.
And these was this little twinkle in his eye, like he's thinking, what a schmuck this Jules is.
What a contemptible fucking idiot.
And she helped him do it, man.
I hated it!
Where is she?
I don't know.
You're sure you're not lying, John?
You're lying to protect her ass, man?
You're sure you're not lying?
You think your old lady and Hicks care two shits about you.
They're out there having a great time together. Yeah.
And they're probably still laughing about how they tied this stupid schmuck to the toilet.
Again.
Hold it.
Yeah?
No. No, there's nothing.
Okay.
Hey, bubi. You can go home now.
Hi.
My name's Antheil. Narcotics investigation.
I was just reading your play.
Found it on the shelf over there.
I liked a lot of it.
I don't like the main character though.
This Marine, he's like a little jellyfish.
I guess you were supposed to like him because he's against the marine Corps.
Is that it?
Something like that.
Why doesn't he do something?
I mean, go over the hill, refuse an order.
I couldn't sympathize with a character like that.
Not everyone did.
The Marine in the play, that supposed to be you?
No.
Maybe a little?
Maybe on some level.
You know what I think, on some level?
I think you're the kind of wise cocksucker that writes a tear jerk play against the marines and then smuggles a shitload of heroin into this country.
I deny that.
And no more literary conversation until I call my lawyer.
You mean Ben Odell?
No Commie lawyer's gonna help you now.
What do you want from me?
A little help.
John.
Did you think about who you were cutting in on, running scag?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The bike clubs, the black guys in Oakland. The syndicate.
And that's not all.
They've got a lot of imagination when they deal with clowns like you trying to take a piece of the trade.
I've heard the stories.
They're all true.
I can feed them your ass.
Just let you run around loose. I guarantee you'll be picked off the streets in less than 24 hours.
You know the only one who can help you?
Me.
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
Hi, Ed.
What did you say? What do you need?
I fell into something.
I thought I'd look you up.
Oh, yeah, good for you.
Can we talk? I got something for you.
Ray, you fucker.
How come I didn't know you, man.
It's been some time.
I want to move some scag.
Phew!
You know what it mean?
I don't see any problems.
What is life without a dream, eh, Raymond?
Oh.
Look, just run the name Ray Hicks through the computer and give me everything that comes up, okay?
No, forget that one.
I want the APB on the Land Rover.
That's right, there can't be more than
20 of them registered down there.
It's easy to spot.
It's a very distinctive vehicle.
I don't know. Try Washington.
Right. Let me know.
Who are those guys?
Witnesses. They're helping me in an investigation.
Tell me about your charming wife.
She's 30 years old.
She's half Irish, half Jewish.
Don't get smart with me.
I want to know how to deal with her.
Is she the kind of broad who'd burn her husband and split with her boyfriend?
Or is she the victim of circumstances?
If you really want to know,
I think she's pretty moral basically.
"Pretty moral basically." Oh, Jesus.
What a couple of yoyo's.
You're in a lot of trouble, my friend.
And so is you're crazy old lady.
If you help us, maybe I can let you walk. Both of you.
- You want me to help, huh?
- That's right.
What if I refuse?
If you refuse?
Well...
There's always your little girl, what is it, Janey?
What do you want me to do?
I'll let you know.
You know our little friend in Saigon told me you were nuts, but she didn't tell me the half of it.
"Our little friend in Saigon?"
Yes, Charmian.
We go back a long way. Even a dipstick like you should have figured that out.
I'll let you know, John.
I'll sell you a key for 20.
I'll give you a rate for two.
I gotta tell you this comes as a complete surprise to me, fellow.
Not the sort of thing
I would've expected from you, personally.
But that's the fucking war for you.
You could approach a small group of responsible people.
You want to sell scag the film industry, is that what you're saying?
A dealer with a personal clientele like that is perfect for him.
Jesus, Ray. You're in here with the big town with all that shit.
Doesn't it make your heart go pitty-pat?
I'd be scared, man.
Am I talking to the right person, Eddie?
Am I God, Ray? How would I know?
Look at those kids, I want it. I want it.
I sit still for every big creep in town.
Do me this, Eddie. Do me that, Eddie.
Even you, man. I'm sitting on top of all this shit, Eddie, please lay it off for me.
If you want it, say yes. If not, say no.
All right, all right.
I got some ideas on this.
I been associated with this guy.
He's English, he used to be a masseur.
He, uh, has a lot of goof-sie works.
He knows what everybody likes.
He might be the one.
No intrigues, Eddie.
Paranoia, Raymond?
Whatever.
I'll put you in touch.
- How about tonight?
- Tonight?
Man, you must be desperate.
How's your friend?
If I was smart I wouldn't even know him.
Are we scared?
We don't know the meaning of scared.
Did you eat anything?
No.
Do you want to call your kid?
They can't trace one phone call.
Sure, I'll call her and say,
"Hi, honey. this is your mommy.
"She loves you very much"
"but she has to go bye-bye."
I know all about that call.
I can handle the rest of it.
It's what's in my head that's gruesome.
Okay, we're going to get you high.
Don't joke with me.
I'm not joking, come on!
I don't know much about that stuff you've been taking.
So, I don't know what your tolerance is.
All right, snort it like coke.
Let's see if you get off.
Go ahead, hit the other one.
Okay, come on.
Oh.
Better than a week in the country, right?
Oh, it's a lot better than a week in the country.
Oh, it's good.
Oh, right there. In there.
Oh, great.
It does funny little things to you.
Do you remember last night?
I remember everything with absolute clarity, since you walked in on me.
Not one funny little thing slips by me.
Do you believe me?
What can I do? I gotta believe you.
You know, I was really strung out there.
Don't brag about it, it's not such a tough condition.
This isn't what you want, not really.
Maybe it is. It's simpler than life.
I'm going to call Eddie.
Whatever's right.
Check and mate.
Where the fuck did that come from?
I didn't even see that.
You got me.
You stupid little bastard.
You better learn how to play the game.
You hit my fucking bridge, man.
Tough tit.
Why don't you read a goddamn chess book for once in your life?
I hate jailbird chess. I hate the style.
Like a god dam little Tweety bird.
Oh, here's a move.
It's fucking degrading.
Plenty of guys who belt you when they lose.
Fucking Danskin, he wins and he hits you.
Where do you think
I learned how to play the game?
I learned it in the slammer, man.
I can't help that.
Hello there, you brought your samples with you?
Did you make your contact?
Who are you? The school teacher?
It's the big dealer and the woman of mystery.
Well, come on in and say hello.
Oh.
Who the hell are you, Raymond? Buffalo Bill?
You're going to love this guy.
Is that the Englishman?
Patience, man. Our hosts here are the nicest folks you'd ever want to meet.
Gerald and Jody, this is Raymond and...
- Marge.
- Marge.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Sit down.
Is that the Englishman?
Gerald's a writer.
And a hell of a writer at that.
Gerald, explain yourself to the man.
This may not be easy.
Well, you see, I've been fooling around with a project that concerns drugs.
I've done dope like a lot of people have.
I mean, I've smoked a lot of grass.
And I've had some beautiful things on acid.
Excuse me.
I want a word with your friend. Wait for me.
It's all right.
Oh, please. Come and sit down.
Would you like some Chablis?
What is this shit, Eddie?
He wants to cop. I thought you'd be amused.
I don't want this insanity, man.
Then you're stupid.
What you got to sell is a "No-No" around here.
For $6,000 I'll take it off your hands.
With a little imagination.
You could screw Gerald for a lot more.
You'd give me what?
The guy's loaded, his wife's an heiress.
They've got no conception of money.
- You said $6,000.
- Take it easy.
Hey, Eddie. I'll burn it before I'll take a fucking like this.
You'll take a fucking like you wouldn't believe.
You want to get hip man.
Now, I'm warning you.
You're doing me. You're doing me.
Take your hands off me, cocksucker.
You nickel and dime asshole.
Don't you dare threaten me with violence.
You're way out of your league here, Jack.
You're not selling grass to college girls down here.
I'm doing you a favor.
You're too vain, Eddie.
You think so?
I can lay this off for you.
Ain't nobody else can.
You don't have the bread.
Oh, yes, I do.
And when we're finished here we'll take a little ride, and do a little business.
Finished what?
We're going to turn Gerald on and then he's going to do us a few favors because he's a nice cat and because we're going to make him scared.
We're going to put you into his life.
And then he's going to want everything back the way it was before.
You like it?
Yeah. I like it, Eddie.
And this is what I call narcotics paraphernalia, Eddie.
I got better than that, sweetheart.
I got some coke to run with it.
Ed's my absolute picture of the operator.
Mine too.
Raymond's the operator. Not me.
- But is Ed an addict, Gerald?
- I don't know.
I didn't know he was an addict.
Yeah, Ed's an addict.
Ain't you, Ed?
None of your fucking business.
Oh, shit, yes. Oh, shit!
Oh, Chihuahua.
Is it Mexican?
Is it Mexican?
She wants to know if it's Mexican.
Okay, who's next?
What about me?
It's gotta be you.
Unless you'd like to go first, darling.
No, there's no reason you shouldn't.
Now you give me some place nice, eh?
Gerald, I want to take her pants off.
- Does he know what he's doing?
- Mmm-hmm.
Bend down.
That's real pretty.
Careful.
Oh, is that very good?
No, that's enough.
Oh. Oh. Oh, Eddie, stop it.
I think you gotta do the rest, man.
I got to... I got to... Hey, I goofed.
Okay.
Shall I take my pants down?
No, sir. You don't have to. Sit down.
Hey, don't hit him in vein, Raymond.
Hey, Eddie. I'm not gonna get him in the vein, man.
Don't look.
Oh, my God.
Eddie. Eddie.
Help, my God. Eddie, it's a vein.
Hey, Raymond. Come on, Ray.
What are you doing, man?
I told you not to hit the vein.
Hustle now, creep. Let me see you hustle now.
Why did you do it, Ray?
Why did you do it, Why?
Your too vain, Eddie.
You're too vain to take a joke.
Good God. Ray. Why did you do it?
Get your stuff. We're getting out.
- We've got to help them.
- Come on. We're going.
- Let's get out.
- Ray!
God help me, God!
Get up, Gerald!
Man, I want out of this fucking city.
What, were you trying to kill him?
He's just a jerk with a dumb idea, the same as us.
Eddie Peace knows what to do.
He'll pull them through.
Why Gerald?
'Cause he's a Martian.
They're all Martians. And I'm a loyal
American who fought for my flag.
Peace was fucking with me and I don't take shit from Martians.
In Vietnam I had men that were dead the day they hit that place.
In the morning they were in Hawaii, in the afternoon they were dead.
- So fuck Gerald?
- That's right. Fuck Gerald.
I was pissed off. It seemed like a good idea.
Where are we going?
South.
Now, for my first deal today,
I'm going to give you...
I'm going to give you a place you can take all the salad out the fruit salad.
No, I'm not going to do it.
Are they real? ls it real? Marvelous.
Great. I'll have that. I'll have it.
During the commercials. ls that all right?
Turn that shit off.
- Would you like that?
- Oh, I'd love it.
All right, Jane has bought this case down the aisle.
How do you guys know each other?
Antheil introduced us.
Antheil's quite a fellow.
The coolest.
Fucking guy's got bread stashed away, beautiful home, chicks coming and going.
They say the system don't work.
Don't tell that to Antheil.
Does he pay you?
What? Do you think I do this for nothing?
I get a crack at a job at the Agency after this.
Don't you have a record?
That don't mean shit.
If Antheil says you're in, you're in.
I could really go for that.
You could be a second Antheil, right?
What about Danskin?
Does he want to work for the agency too?
He's a brute, man. Psycho.
A dude like that, he can't deal with the public.
It's me.
Right.
Okay.
We're moving out.
They spotted the boyfriend's car in LA.
Know who's with him? Your bigger half.
As long as I remember
The rain been comin' down
Clouds of mystery pourin'
Confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages
Thank you.
Tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
Get me the map. I want to take some back roads.
Jesus. Home on the range.
You just missed Yuma.
That's California.
We need Arizona, New Mexico.
Are you talking about the border?
No. We're going to the Mountain.
Elojo Grande, The Big Eye.
What are we going to do now?
We're going to go after them? What else?
We're going on the road, fellow.
We've located your wife.
I'm arranging a touching reunion.
I just had a very interesting talk with an old buddy of Ray Hicks.
Tell me. How do you feel about your wife and Hicks?
How do I feel about them?
Yeah?
I feel left out.
What the fuck is this?
We're going to New Mexico?
That's right.
Land of enchantment.
When we go in you're going to help us negotiate.
- Negotiate?
- Yeah.
Maybe we'll exchange you for the dope. I don't know.
We'll improvise. Psychodrama.
You get to be the star.
I knew I wasn't looking at it right,
I mean, I was considering all the legal issues here.
You let me worry about that.
I'm very good in court.
You ready to go, fellows?
But wait a minute.
We're going to be at the back of beyond, man. How are we going to contact you?
I'll be waiting for you. It's near the border.
I have a colleague down there.
We've done business before. He's going to let me know when Hicks arrives.
Antheil, they arrive.
What is this?
What did you have here?
Lion hunts.
Hoe downs, celebrations.
Light shows. Tribal dances.
Sounds like fun.
No doubt about it.
Dieter!
I have come home.
This is Dieter Pravda's place.
He's the man we need right now.
If anyone can lay that stuff off, he can.
Come on, let's start walking.
His house is way up there on top.
Here, give me your hand.
I don't know if he's up there but he's never gone for long.
Anyway, Dieter doesn't care. We can stay there forever if we want to, babe.
The Jesuits built it in the missionary days.
They came up here when they were hassled.
It's kind of a retreat.
Dieter's had it for about 10 years.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
Hey, beautiful, come on out here a minute and talk to me.
You know what?
I put this whole system in myself.
- Yeah?
- See these wires.
They run all the way down the mountain.
You can run all that stuff in the valley from up here.
You know, when I came up here in '65, there were all kinds of people here.
Dieter hauled in a couple of tons of hardware.
He had speakers, amplifiers, tape decks, microphones, all kinds of lights.
Came in and said we'd got to get it all together. Hook it all up.
One big circuit.
Well, I'm the only one that knows anything about that shit.
So I get the job.
Everybody else is so ripped, they couldn't change a battery in a Jap radio.
I'm laying wire from hell to breakfast.
Took me about four weeks.
And half the time I'm so stoned
I couldn't even talk.
But by Christ we did it.
One big circuit.
Man, we made this mountain boogie.
I'd have liked to have seen that.
Where were you?
Come on.
- Come here. Come on.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No!
- Come on, let's do it!
Come on, babe, don't be scared.
I want to see strut your stuff.
When Dieter gets back, we'll have a celebration.
We'll have some of that old time weirdness.
What do you think you're doing?
Don't worry, nobody's watching.
Oh, why not? Fuck real life.
That's right.
Real life don't cut no ice with us.
Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
That I got another true lover waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special's a-burnin' the rail
So woman don't try to follow my trail
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away
Hearher thunder on through the night
This Golden Rocket is a-doin' me right
And that sunny old Southland sure is a part of me
Wait a minute.
Your fire went out, you done lost your flame
And this Golden Rocket is a-rollin' my blues away
It sounds like a chopper.
That's either the border patrol or a bust.
That must be the main trail going up to the house.
There's another one for you.
Several trails up there.
You'll find them marked on the map.
- Which one do we take?
- That's up to you.
Read the map, for Christ's sake.
It's pure smack. All over the seats.
Maybe he can read it.
Right. Who knows?
These people may be actively hostile to those creeps up there.
They'll have specialized knowledge about access routes.
This is somewhat different from what we had envisioned.
That's true.
Antheil's pissed off.
Let me make one thing clear.
Tomorrow morning we're going to have to act officially.
There'll be local police involvement.
There will be regulation procedure.
There will be arrests.
And there will be confiscations.
Smitty, you get that.
Uh-uh.
Cops will grab the dope, right?
You'll get zip.
Shut up, smartass.
So we only got to morning to take it all through, eh?
- That's right.
- Right.
You two going in with us?
To some extent.
We will be here to back you up.
Shit man, you told me you had this place cased.
I don't even know how many people he's got up there, for Christ's sake.
Any mishaps just get out of it at first light. I am not kidding.
We're going to be all over cops.
Right.
Let's go.
I don't think Antheil is pissed off.
I think he's scared.
Just shut the fuck up.
Don't say a word. Not one word.
When you are supposed to talk,
I'll tell you. Right?
Right.
Hi there, fellow! Senor.
We are looking for some hippies living round here.
You know hippies, freakos. Savvy?
Guy named Ray Hicks is with them.
Hippies?
They live up in the mountain here. Right?
I don't know.
You know the way?
I don't go there.
Hold it, tamale pie.
Going to show us the way there?
Hey, schmuck, chili head.
Is anybody coming, Sister Ann?
Hmm?
You're supposed to say,
"I see only the sun and the grass looking green."
How much of that shit are you doing?
Oh, I don't know. There's so much of it.
I can see you killing time on the road.
But you'd better use some moderation.
Nobody can surprise us.
We have got the high ground here.
We're going to win this one.
You know that?
Listen.
If we can lay that stuff off, we'll go down to Mexico.
I know some people there.
Hey, hey, maybe we'll get a boat.
Who's going to be on that boat?
Where's that boat going to go?
That's going to have to be some boat.
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't fold on me, Marge.
Play some of that music.
Okay.
Scumbag spic, wait up!
I hate this kemosabe crap.
- Hey, Jules, you all right?
- Shit.
I should've worn sneakers.
From old Montana down to Alabama
I've been before and I'll travel again...
What the hell is that?
Where the fuck is that coming from?
How the hell am I supposed to know?
I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track
Bought a one-way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away
Hey, schmuck. Where's that...
- Oh, shit.
- Hey. Hey.
Watch out, man. Get down, man.
Hey.
Get inside.
What was that? Who's shooting?
- Where did he go?
- Shit.
I knew he wanted to run.
I didn't think he'd get it on, though.
They heard us. Fuck it, man, they heard us.
Get inside. And stay out of sight.
Can you read me? Over, for Christ sake.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. we lost Conto.
We're in tree city, man.
Who knows where we are?
What do you want us to do now? Over.
Just keep going up. What else? Over.
Right. Come on. Let's go.
Hey, Jules, I've got to get high.
Oh, shut up, schmuck.
Come on, come on, come on!
You no-good asshole, come on!
Don't call me an asshole, yeah?
Those shots came from a high power rifle from down below.
It could have been a hunter, couldn't it?
No, there's gonna be a bust.
- We have been turned.
- Who by?
Eddie Peace.
I should've killed him when I had a chance.
Go, get ready to sprint. Go on.
What a shit.
Walking everywhere. All for this, asshole?
I beg your pardon?
You like this? Trees and weirdness?
- The great outdoors.
- Are we lost?
I don't know yet.
I'll let you know when I find out.
Why the hell are we walking downhill now?
How the fuck should I know?
You're leading, aren't you?
Holy shit!
Oh, wow.
Hey, Jules.
Shut up, idiot.
Look at that.
Get in here.
Give me that thing. Give it to me.
How the fuck are we supposed to get on the other side, man?
How the fuck do I know, man? We're lost.
Give me that fucking thing, will you?
Come here, schmuck,
Hey, get in here. Get in here.
Max One. Max One.
We're on the wrong mountain.
What do ya think of that? Over.
Tell me about it. Over.
Well, we can see the place. But we're fucked.
We can't do a thing from here. Over.
How much closer can you get?
About two more feet then it's Grand Canyon.
All right, get in position.
Take cover. Move asshole up where they can see him.
Tell them you'll shoot him if they don't produce.
Man, what do they care. They'll laugh at us.
Make asshole do the talking.
He can use his influence on his wife.
What do you think, schmuck?
You think she'll come through for you?
I don't know.
Let's go, come on!
Ray. Ray Hicks.
Is that you, Pidio?
- Ray.
- What's up?
There's five guys. They have guns.
- Where?
- Three over there.
- They know you are here.
- Which side?
The other side of the canyon.
- There?
- Yes.
- The other two?
- In the valley.
You know something?
They may not be cops at all.
Marge?
Marge! It's John.
Stay in here. Pidio, check the back trail.
Tell her to give it to us, or we'll kill you.
Give it to them.
Or we'll kill you.
You think this is funny?
No.
Then say it.
Or they'll kill me.
Ray.
It tolls for thee, motherfucker.
- We have to do what he says.
- Stay right here.
We have to stall them.
Say. Please let us go.
Please let us go.
We have to dig it up.
Say it again, louder.
No. I'm going down.
I'm through. It just isn't worth it.
They can have the dope and me with it.
They're stalling.
Hey, lady, we got your kid.
Marge.
They're lying.
How do I know that? How?
If you think they have her, you tell them to produce her.
Produce her? They're gonna burn her with cigarettes.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Marge.
They haven't got her.
She's with your family.
I'm taking it down.
- Hey, Jules.
- What?
I want to shoot that horse. Can I?
What an idiot.
What do you think they're going to do?
Let you walk? You'll never make it.
No?
I'm coming down. I'm bringing it with me.
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
No.
Hicks brings it down.
Not you. Hicks.
You heard them.
They want you to bring it down.
Negative.
No! Stop!
Stop. I'm bringing it down.
Please stop the shooting.
Oh, wow.
I could put one right between her eyes.
Hey, cut it out. Cut it out.
Hicks won't do it.
I'll bring the stuff down. I swear it.
No. You heard me. Hicks brings it down.
Hicks won't come down. Won't even talk to us.
Wife says she'll bring the stuff down. I don't know.
They're getting foxy. Over.
Can you see her?
Yeah, man. She's right across from me.
I could hit her with a rock.
God damn it. What's the problem?
All right. We'll just appeal to her finer feelings. Let me talk to asshole.
Here he is.
Converse, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah. He can hear you.
All right, get down on your knees.
Is he on his knees?
No!
Yes, he's on his knees.
Now, put your hands together like you were praying.
Are his hands together?
What are you doing?
Are his hands together?
Come on, don't be crazy. Do what he says.
Are his hands together?
Yeah, yeah. He's praying.
Come on, let's get on with it.
Wait! Please don't shoot him.
Then tell Hicks to get his ass down here.
I'm tired of pissing around with you, lady.
Get that stuff down here or I'll blow his head off.
If you shoot that man...
If you shoot that man, no one comes down.
I repeat.
If you shoot that man, no one comes down.
Fuck you.
All right, hold it!
Ray, if you don't go, they're going to kill him.
No, they won't. They need him.
You won't go?
Hey, Marge, hurry up.
Do what you think is right.
I'm coming down.
I will give it to you if you let him go.
I know. I know.
All right. It's agreeable.
What do you mean it's agreeable?
This is one of those times when you have to be optimistic.
When she gets down here we'll be waiting for her.
What do we do with asshole?
Just keep him with you and in one piece.
You guys keep her in sight as she comes down. Over.
It's agreeable.
Antheil better watch his ass, boy.
That Hicks will kill you.
Hurry up!
Is the trail marked clearly?
Yeah. Do you want a light?
No, no, Pidio, no light.
I'm going to cover you all the way down the trail.
I don't want you to cover me, and I don't want any more stuff with guns.
Okay, talk to them about that.
We see you. Now bring it down.
She didn't even say goodbye. How about her?
They'll be waiting for her in the amphitheater.
If I go down the goat trail, the trail you came up,
I'd be right behind them. Right?
Yes, but, Ray, they are five.
They got my buddy, man.
And they're going to kill him and that pretty lady.
How am I going to let them do that?
Do you see the way she walked to her fate?
Nothing but class.
She's the love of my life. No shit.
Beats the hell out of all of them.
Pidio. Do the lights in the valley still work?
I don't know, Ray. I think so.
Let me tell you how this works.
We're going to give them a show.
When you hear this go, hit these and these.
Crank up the volume and then hit that.
Wait here for me. I'll be back.
Hey, let's keep together.
Are you all right?
I could beat you to death. You know that?
Absolutely.
Shut up. What the fuck is the matter with you?
I don't know.
But pretty soon I'm either going to be away from you or dead.
And either way it's fine with me.
Want odds?
- On what?
- On dead.
Stop.
Right. Come ahead,
- I have it.
- Shut up.
That way.
Drop it.
Where's John?
He's here.
You're safe now, Mrs. Converse.
Where is he?
Shine a light on him.
It's going to be okay, you'll see.
You got it?
Yeah, we got it.
Keep going, honey.
This is your touching reunion.
Smitty, she brought it. Don't hurt her.
No. No need, man.
Hey, wait a goddamn minute!
They've got a switch on us.
Run, Marge.
Over here, Marge.
Keep your head down.
Up here, Marge. Get behind these rocks.
From old Montana down to Alabama
I've been before and I'll travel again
You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards, but you missed the play
So hit the road and be on your way
Jules!
Jules!
So, honey, never hang your signal out for me
I'm tired of running on the same old track
Bought a one-way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away
Ray?
Where are you?
Below you, to the right. I'm coming in.
Okay, I'll cover you.
Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
That I got another true lover waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special's a-burnin' the rail
So woman don't try to follow my trail
Johnny.
Hearher thunder on through the night
This Golden Rocket is a doin' me right
The fucking head guy, who is he?
He's some kind of cop.
He's not straight.
No shit.
That guy's going to have to run for it.
Nailed him.
I've got two of them boxed in,
I think the other two are dead.
You two can get out of here.
All right. Here's what you got to do.
The two of you drive out of here to the highway, go west to the railroad tracks.
You're going to pick me up there in the morning.
- Come with us.
- No.
If those guys get to the radio every cop in the state's going to be on our ass.
Now I can keep them pinned down here for hours.
You meet me on those tracks in the morning. It's the only way, John.
Go on, for Christ's sake.
Wait a minute.
Hey, tonight
Gonna be tonight
Hurry, go ahead.
What are you waiting for? Go now. Go.
Tonight
Hey, come on
Gonna chase tomorrow
Tonight

Watch me now
Jody's gonna get religion
Get in and turn the lights on, Marge.
I've got to get the keys. Hurry up. Now.
Here, here, let me strap you up.
Easy, easy.
When did you start that?
Johnny.
It's your wonderful smack.
You can't stay this way, Marge.
I know.
I know.
He's walking out there.
Yeah. Let's go get him.
Hey, John.
I got it. I got it all.
You be there for me.
Don't cringe, man.
It don't do no fucking good to cringe.
I don't know. I don't know.
But I been told.
That Eskimo pussy is mighty cold.
Left, left.
Left, right, left.
Ain't no use in going home.
Jody's got your girl and gone.
Ain't no use in feeling blue.
Jody's got your sister too.
I'm going to take a three day pass,
I'm going to whoop old Jody's ass.
Sound it all now, one, two, hit it again, three, four.
Bring it all down, one, two. Three, four.
Three, four.
Left, left, left, left.
No, no, no, no, Ray! Ray!
No, he's not dead.
Marge. I've got to bury him.
No. you're not going to bury him.
Don't you touch him.
Don't you dare touch him. Get out of here.
Get away.
No!
No.
No! John!
Move over, Marge.
If we stay here and grieve, we'll be just as dead as he is.
As long as I remember
The rain been comin' down
Clouds of mystery pourin'
Confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages
Tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
I went down Virginia
Seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals
Wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, tryin' to keep warm
Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
I went down Virginia
Seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals
Wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring, falling on my ears
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

Nurse, can you tell me where Franz Kemmerich is?
Yes, he's through there.
Franz.
How are you?
Someone stole my watch.
- Bastards!
- I warned you, Franz.
- I know.
- We'll tell the doctor.
You'll be going home soon.
Do you think?
I feel... I'm all right.
My foot. It's so painful.
It's so cold.
That pain is your ticket home.
You should be grateful to that pain. telling fat lies to Katrine Hammerschmidt.
Here's some smokes and a piece of cheese from Kat, and your comb is in the tobacco tin.
Put them under the bed, please.
Hide them.
You know they stole my watch.
Franz, will you be taking these back home with you?
Why not?
Well, you don't really need boots back home.
We could trade.
- I've got...
- No! My mother gave me those.
- You could lend them to me?
- No.
You'll be home a lot sooner than us.
Orderly. Orderly!
They don't come. They never come.
We'll get someone.
- It'll be different at home.
- When you return...
- ..We'll be together.
- We'll come tomorrow.
- I'll come tomorrow.
- Thank you. Thank you.
I'll be back.
Make sure you get my watch.
We will.
You think I don't care about Franz.
Of course I care.
If I could save his leg or life, I'd walk over barbed wire. You know that.
But where he's going, he won't need his boots.
He won't need anything.
And my boots hurt. They really hurt.
Why should some damn orderly get his boots and not one of his friends.
He's right, Paul.
I know.
Very good, Kemmerich.
Very good, Kemmerich.
They've amputated my leg.
Could be worse.
Wegler lost his right arm, which is very much worse.
Besides, you're going home.
Do you think so?
Of course.
Do you think so?
Once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Don't talk nonsense.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You will.
You can do anything.
If you find my watch, send it home.
You'll go to a convalescent home.
Maybe the one in Klosterberg.
Remember how we hiked up there?
Remember the poplars?
The stream full of fish?
Franz, Franz... When I come back, we go up to the mountains again.
You can name all the trees for me.
Tell me all about them.
Franz, nothing will change.
We'd be together again.
Franz.
Franz.

Doctor?
Doctor! Quickly,
Franz Kemmerich is dying.
Which one's that?
Bed 36, amputated leg.
How should I know that?
I've amputated five legs today.
You see to it.
Today there have been sixteen deaths, yours will be the seventeenth.
There'll probably be twenty altogether.
We must take him away at once.
We need the bed.
They're lying on the floor outside.
Paul.
Yes, Mrs Kemmerich?
- I want you to promise.
- What, Mrs Kemmerich?
- Look after Franz.
- Of course...
He looks up to you.
He'll do anything you ask, you know?
Make him stay away from danger.
You know how reckless he is.
I'll make sure he behaves himself.
God bless you both.

It's beautiful here. Come on.
Let's go. Wake up. Food.
Come on.
Oh, Kat.
I don't know how you do it.
Next time you come with me,
I'll show you how to find food.
When I'm not here, it'll come in handy.
What? You'll always be here.
Ah, up here
'always' isn't a long time.
Anyway, you'd better learn so you won't go hungry.
You pay attention to the teacher.
He's coming. He's coming.
What did he want?
Doesn't matter. We're free.
Time for work, for duty.
You will enlist, the entire class.
Of course.
Behm, you too.

But not tonight.
Tonight we get drunk.

Frenchie wants to say hello.
You just stick close to Kat, and move when I tell you to move.
Get down. Off the road.
Take cover. Off the road!
Shoot the wounded horses!
Shoot them!
Shoot them, can't you?
Shoot them.
Hey! You're crazy?
You want to kill somebody?
Get down.
Why? What have they done?
They haven't done anything.
Using horses is wrong.
It's wrong killing horses.
Come on, let's go, boys.
Get up.
Up. Come on, boys.
Everybody here?
Huh? Link up, boys.
A taste of the real thing.
You'll get used to it.
You ready?
All right.
Well, you're almost getting to be soldiers now.
You stick with Kat and you'll be all right.
'We have been at the front for a year. We are soldiers now.
'We know this place well.
'We are at home.
'Only Kemmerich is dead but we keep hearing about others in our class;
'dead, wounded.
'If a shot comes, all we can do is duck,
'because we can never know where it will fall.
'I can be smashed to bits in a bomb-proof dugout,
'of I can survive ten hours unscathed out in the open.
'Of course, every soldier believes in chance and trusts his luck.
'But no soldier outlives a thousand chances.
'We call them corpse rats.
'They have shocking evil faces and even on our empty stomachs,
'it is nauseating to see their long naked tais.
'The bait is bread, so rotten even we won't eat it.
'they'll come among us to snatch them away.
'It's a way to pass the time.'
Gas masks. Gas masks.
'Gas, the most feared, most obscene weapon of all.
'We remember the awful sights in the hospital.
'The gas patients who, surfocating,
'cough up their burned lungs in clots.
'Better take your chances in the open
'than stay in the hollows where the vapours settle.'
'The new recruits are more trouble than they are worth.
'Between five and ten get killed to every old hand.
'And they get killed simply because they are so inexperienced.
No, don't! No!
Get him.
Hand me a rifle. Hand me a rifle.
Kat, wait!
A baby.
Just a baby.
They're in position.
- Nearby?
- Yes, sir.
'How long has it been?
'Weeks, months, years? Only days.
'Yesterday we were under fire.
Today we can rest.
'Tomorrow we go up to the trenches again.'
Boys, boys, come here.
Look, you boys go on that side.
Over here. This way.
Easy, easy.
Get around, get around up there.
This way.
It's gone.
Quick, he'll get away.
Get him, get him, get him!
Someone eat the liver. I'm on a diet. and the sturfing would have been something very special.
But all considered...
A feast. I feel like a king.
Ah, not bad, not bad.
Like I say, it's not a bad little war.
You never answered my question, Joseph.
What question?
What we'll all do. Get drunk.
Of course he'll get drunk.
Then it's back home and mama and all that.
But what ese?
Well, tell him, Joseph.
Don't be ashamed.
I'm not ashamed.
He's going to theology school to be a minister.
A year here and you haven't changed your mind about that.
Is God still in his heaven?
Nothing ever changes that.
What about you?
Back to the cobbler's bench, eh?
And the children.
How many you got?
Don't ask.
Good thing I'm a shoemaker, of I'd go broke just buying shoes.
More coffins.
A bigger load than usual.
That means a bigger offensive.
How considerate they are at headquarters.
Come on, get this one down.
Haul them up.
Careful, careful.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
Next year, fight out of the cradle.
Did you notch this bayonet?
Yes, sir.
Who told you to?
- At the training camp...
- Training camp, eh?
Sonny, if the enemy ever caught you with this, they wouldn't kill you,
Nobody uses these things any more.
It's by mutual agreement, on both sides.
I didn't know.
- First time?
- Yes, sir.
Don't 'sir' me. I'm a private.
Sorry, I thought...
Don't think. Just listen.
Yes, sir.
Your spade is better.
You hit a man under the chin.
Take his head off.
It's a good club, too.
Cos it's heavy.
Hit a man between neck and shoulder.
Right here. Split him right in two.
- Mother of God!
- It's cleaner.
Bayonet gets stuck in ribs, you have to kick him to pull it out.
Time it takes, you're a dead man.
Understand?
Now, where is your platoon leader?
Corporal Himmestoss said he'd meet us here.
Ah.
Corporal who?
Himmestoss.
From Oldenberg training station?
Yes, sir.
I don't believe it!
Vengeance is mine.
No, sir. He got into trouble.
Overdid it with two trainees on the muddy field. You know the field?
Do we know the muddy field?
He went too far. Almost killed them.
He didn't see the son of the local magistrate watching.
So, he's here.
Of course he'd spoil it for himself.
Oh, Lord. I can hardly wait.
Oh, well. Look who's here.
Well, we meet again.
Kropp, isn't it? You remember me,
Corporal Himmestoss.
Müller, you here too?
Oh, yes, I remember you very well.
Lehr, Behm, Baumer...Baumer.
Nothing wrong with my memory!
You've all managed to stay alive.
Not Kemmerich.
Kemmerich?
I don't remember Kemmerich.
The rest of you seem to have learned your lessons pretty well. don't you turn your back.
What did you say?
So this is the great
Corporal Himmestoss?
And who are you?
I asked you a question, soldier.
Himmestoss.
There's a latfine down the road.
Why don't you take a jump?
Do you want to be court martialled?
Stand up straight, hees together, when your superior officer speaks to you.
All of you!
Squad, attention!
Right...face.
Right turn, forward...march.
Left, left, left, left.
Left, left, left, left, left, left.
Easy, boy, easy.
It'll be all right.
Ah, you see the way he blows up?
Boom, like that.
Want to kill Frenchmen?
You'll be all right, boy.
You'll get used to it.
To soften us up so we can't sleep.
Huh, then when they attack, we won't be able to fight back because we're too tired.
Two days and nights. How much longer?
Not too long, not too long.
Why don't they stop?
Where are you going?
I'll be back...in a minute.
No, just relax. Wait. It'll be over soon. Come on, sit down and relax.
Let me go. I must get away.
Sit down and calm down.
Now, go and sit down.
Behave yourselves. Be easy, quiet.
I said...
Come on, let's go.
Come on...come on.
'No longer do we lie helpless, awaiting destruction.
'We can destroy and kill to save ourselves and to be revenged.
'When we see their faces, we become wild beasts.
'We turn into thugs and murderers.
'Into God only knows what devis.
'If your own father was with them,
Forward!
Fire.
What the hell is this?
Come on, let's go. Come on, you all.
Come on, move. You too, soldier.
Come on, let's go. let's go, let's go.
What's happening down there?
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
'How long is it? Days, of weeks, of months, of years?
'Attack, counter-attack.
And the dead pile up.
'Winter, summer... The days are hot and the dead lie unburied.
'The shels will bury them.
'But when the wind blows, it brings the smell of blood,
'which is heavy and sweet.'
No, shh...shh...
Shh! Shh!
No, no...
- No, shh. Je vous...
Je vous...help...
I want to help you.
Ohh!
I didn't want to kill you.
But you jumped in here like that.
What would you have done? It's... face to face.
I just saw your rifle... your bayonet... grenades.
If we threw all those away... we could be brothers.
But they never want us to know that, do they?
They never want us to know.
We each have mothers... fathers... the same... fear of death.
The same... pain.
The same... everything.
Everything.
Forgive me, comfade.
I could write...to your family.
Yes...
Yes, I'll write!
'Gefard Duval, compositeur.
'I have killed
Gefard Duval the printer.'
Battalion, attention!
Present arms!
Eyes left!
Battalion Commander, sir.
Your Majesty, I have the honour to bring you the salute of the 150th Infantry Battalion.
Your Majesty,
Soldier Bernard.
Your Majesty,
Soldier Langer.
Your Majesty,
Corporal Himmestoss.
Battalion! At ease!
Officers, non-commissioned officers, enlisted men.
The men who have received decorations this day
From this day on, your Kaiser urges you all to aspire to such strength, to such bravery, to such obedience to your God and your country.
If you do, my soldiers,
I am certain you will all one day wear a medal pinned on you by your Kaiser.
You have all done your duty as noble German warriors.
You have shown the world our might.
You have stricken our enemies with fear.
It'll take weeks to get to the skin!
- Give me that soap?
- How's the water?
Beautiful! Come on in!
Hey! Look at that!
Hello! Bonjour, bonjour!
Jolies! Jolies!
Somebody do something!
Just don't let them get away!
Allo, Mademoiselles!
Allo, Mademoiselles!
Attendez, s'il vous plait!
Tell them to come over.
Er, yes, er... Mademoiselle, you come over this side, oui?
- We want to talk.
- Talk?!
Parlez vous, Mademoiselles!
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Frauleins, l'amour, yes?
You coming over, we have l'amour, yes?
Oui, oui, oui.
- Don't go!
- Yoo-hoo!
Gifs! Fraulein, bread, yes?
You want bread?
Look! Regardez!
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum, yes? Bread!
You come over here, oui?
Vous!
Venez!
Ici!
Ce soir!
Vous venez!
Lá-bas!
Nótre maison!
They want us to come to their house tonight!
Oui! Avec quelque chose a manger, oui?
- With something to eat!
- La maison lá!
Maison!
- Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!
- Bye! Bye!
Drink up, Tjaden.
It's bad luck there's four of us and three of them.
Mm-hmm... Bad luck.
See, it's just not fair to the gifs.
Drink up, Tjaden. How often do you get good French wine?
Not fair to the gifs... No.
One of us will have to make the supreme sacrifice.
Mmm?
Bottoms up, Tjaden, you're not keeping up with us.
Maybe we should draw lots?
You lose.
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
This looks like the right line-up, huh?
I'm all for this one.
You like yours, Albert?
Yes.
Paul?
Mais tu es blanc comme neige, je crois.
Er...
Est-ce que je me trompe, petit bon homme.
Oui!
Mon petit soldat.
Non, non. Ici.
- Quelle age a-tu?
- Eh?
- Ton age?
- No...
- Quelle age a-tu?
- Ah! I'm 19.
19... Oh!
Vingt-cinq ans? Vraiment?
Look out! Look out! Take cover!
- My leg!
- Come on, Albert! Up! Up!
Come on, boys, a little bit more.
Down! Stay down!
I'll be right back!
Hey!
Paul!
Take care!
Kat.
Kat!
Kat, come on!
- All right.
- Easy, easy.
- From Kat.
- What is it?
- It's a long ride.
- Oh, bread and cheese!
He could find a lobster dinner in the middle of the desert!
Goodbye.
- Take care, Paul.
- Bye.
'Albert and I are in a Catholic hospital.
- Won't see him again.
- Why not?
The "Dead Room"?
What's the Dead Room?
The Dying Room, whatever you call it.
It's in the basement.
It's convenient really.
It's next to the mortuary.
No one ever comes back.
'The beds empty quickly, and new occupants take their places.
'It is going badly with Albert.
He is in much pain.
'Last night one of our wardmates awakened with a severe haemoffhage.
They won't take me! No! NO!
We're taking you to the bandaging room.
I won't go to the Dying Room!
We're not going there.
Then why take his tunic?
- I'll be back. I won't die!
- Why are you taking his tunic?
I'll come back!
I won't die! I'll come back!
Liars!
They're lying.
LIARS!
I'll come back!
I'll come back! I won't die...
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop that! Orderly!
Get the orderly! Doctor!
Orderly! Orderly!
Why didn't you leave him alone?
You are doing so well, Paul.
Soon we'll throw away the cane.
- Sister.
- Yes?
I'm worried about my friend.
I think...he is making a very good recovery.
He worries me.
Since the operation, he...
He's in a terrible state of mind.
He hardly speaks to me any more.
There is always such a reaction after an amputation.
Always!
Now, stop worrying.
Albert will get over it.
Go, tell him your good news.
That should cheer him up.
Albert?
How do you feel?
Albert, they're giving me 16 days convalescent leave. I'm going home.
They'll be sending you home, too.
Is there anything I can get you?
A gun.
A what?
You want to get me something?
Get me a gun.
- Will you get me a gun or not?
- No! Don't talk nonsense!
No, you talk sense.
Albert...
I'm sorry.
Paul?
Paul! Why didn't you tell us you were coming?
Mother. Mother!
Paul? Come up.
Give me your handkerchief.
How is she?
She's in bed.
She's sick, Paul.
What is it?
We don't know.
But...Dr Bradermeier thinks... it's probably the cancer again.
Thank God.
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.
Are you wounded, Paul?
No... No, I'm just on leave.
- Oh, Paul.
- How are you?
I'm going to try to get up a little today, I think.
Good.
My Paul.
My Paul.
Look.
Bread.
And cheese and...butter!
They feed you enough where you are?
Not always enough, but we manage.
Is it very bad there?
No.
Not so bad.
Heinrich Bradermeier was here and said it's terrible out there, with the gas attacks and all the rest of it.
It's just talk.
Just talk.
Look at me, I'm well and fit, aren't I?
Yes.
But then...
It's more comfortable,
Father, that's all.
But I...I want to show off our soldier boy to the fellows at Max's.
You look well, Paul. Fit.
War agrees with you, eh?
- I suppose, in a way.
- Have a cigar.
If you're old enough to kill Frenchmen, you can smoke.
Hans, another beer for our young warrior.
What's the spirit like out there?
Excellent, eh?
The enemy has many reserves,
Mr Hollerstein.
You only see your little sector,
The important thing is the breakthrough, here in Flanders.
This is Frenchie, this is us.
We have to come found the Belgian side and fam through.
There's no other way.
Before we beat them on the Hindenburg line?
It is borders that are important.
You're quite wrong.
Good soldiers never stay planted on borders like turnips...
You're lying to me, Paul.
I know you are.
I swear to you, he died instantly.
- You promised he wouldn't get hurt.
- Mrs Kemmerich, I...
Why are you living when he is dead? Why?
What right have you?
Tell me again.
Did you...see it?
Yes, I was fight there next to him.
He died at once. He never suffered.
I know that you're trying to comfort me,
I want to know the...
I want the truth!
I have to hear it!
Mrs Kemmerich, I promise, that's exactly how it happened.
His face was quite calm.
- Do you swear it?
- Yes.
By everything that is sacred to you?
By everything that is sacred to me.
He died at once.
May I never come back... if he wasn't killed instantly.
Carry that lesson to the front lines
You are dismissed.
Baumer.
Paul Baumer!
Baumer!
- Here, have a cigarette.
- No, thank you.
You still haven't picked up the habit. Well, that's good.
It's not a good habit but a man has to have vices.
How does it go? All work and no play... You remember?
How is it, Baumer?
How...how is the spirit?
Excellent, eh? Excellent?
Behm is dead.
Behm?
Josef Behm.
Oh. You know,
I didn't think he would enlist.
But he went.
Yes...
Kemmerich is dead, too.
I was told.
And Kropp has lost a leg.
Er... Oh, Albert Kropp, yes.
I don't know about all the others. We were separated, but Leer's alive and Müller is alive and I'm alive.
I'm glad to hear that.
Tell them...
Tell them I'm proud to have taught them to be good Germans.
To know that you have all done your duty by the Fatherland.
Imagine how that makes me feel?
You were a good class. Good boys.
Good boys all.
- And this class?
- This lot?
They haven't got your spirit, Baumer.
Not the Iron Youth, eh?
Mm? I'm sorry...?
No Iron Heroes?
Just boys.
Want to play.
Laugh.
To stay alive.
Only boys.
Mother, it's late.
You should be asleep.
Did I wake you, dear? I'm sorry.
You'll catch cold here. Go sleep.
I can sleep enough later.
Are you very much afraid?
No.
I'd like to tell you to be on your guard against the women in France.
They're no good.
Mother, where we are there aren't any women.
- Yes, I will.
- I pray for you every day.
I know, Mother.
Perhaps you can get a job that is not so dangerous?
Perhaps in the cookhouse.
That could be easily done.
Do it, then, and if others say anything...
I won't let that bother me.
Now, you must sleep,
Mother. Come on.
'Mother, I used to live in this room. All my things are here.
'All my books, my beloved books,
'but they no longer speak to me as they used to,
'for I am not what I was when I lived here.
'I am a soldier. My business is not reading, it is killing.
'My knowledge of life is limited to death,
'and I know now
I should never have come back.
'because it has no meaning.
'My companions at the front are the only truth I know.
'I depend on them and I depend on nothing ese.
'Mother, it's a terrible thing to say,
'but I feel I am now going back to my real home.'
Paul!
- Well, you're back, my boy.
- Yes, I'm back.
You're a fool.
I'm glad to see you, anyway.
I'm glad to see you, too, Kat.
They're getting younger and younger, Paul.
Our hands'll be full just taking care of them.
Hey! The old deserter's back!
- How was your leave?
- Good. Where's Müller?
- When was it?
- A week ago.
Was it quick?
Shrapnel in the stomach.
He lasted two hours.
Damn!
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
Leer! No, leave him!
He's gone! He's gone!
Leer! Come back!
God!
Oh, GOD! GOD! GOD! GOD!
- Ready! Charge!
- Let's go!
'There isn't much. We are all going hungry. We are all tired.
'We are all hopeless.
But the war goes on.'
Why don't they just let it end?
Ah, who knows?
We're finished.
Our bread is nothing but sawdust.
You see anybody that hasn't got dysentery and colic?
Artillery's burned out.
Damned barres are so worn down
Too many guns, tanks.
Now the Americans are pouring in.
New guns, aeroplanes, fresh troops.
Lie still.
- Just as it's ending!
- Be quiet!
- After four years.
- Stretcher!
- Stretcher bearer!
- Just as it's ending.
It's all right. Just lie still.
Don't worry, it looks like a clean wound.
Just hold on.
Stretcher!
Can you stand up?
You can get up?
Come on. Come on! Come on!
I've got to carry you.
Ready? Up.
Sorry.
That's all right. That's all right.
We gotta keep going. You ready?
Yes, yes.
Come on.
- You got it?
- I'll try.
- No.
- No, I'll try.
No, you can't. It's all right.
No.
It's his shin, he's fainted.
C'mon, Kat, come on.
He was talking.
Ten minutes ago.
We were talking.
'It is Autumn.
We wait for the end.
'We wait for the Armistice.
'We wait for peace.'
'a bullet in the head.
'Himmestoss was killed the same day
'and now Detering is gone.
'I think we started to lose Detering last spring,
'when the apple trees came into bloom.
'You know that expression of his in springtime?
'A week later he was caught by the Military Police.
'We know where he was going.
Home, to the harvest.
'Albert, of the class of 1916.
'Out of the 20 who enlisted,
13 are dead.
'Four are missing.
'One is in a madhouse.
'You and I live. How I miss you.'
The relatives...
Those interested in the ones that disappeared... in the 42 to 44 Russian front... go to the right in group 14.
To the right.
Again, in group 14.
Madam, if no communication has come from the army... or the Ministry, means that your husband dead hasn't been accepted.
So, he's alive
Alive?
Indeed he could be alive.
We believe he's missing.
But, what does missing means?
Can you explain it to me?
I've already told you, he could be alive, but we don't know it.
Neither do I or his mother!
Not her and not me, how is this possible?
Madam, officially he's not dead
I already told you.
Then he's alive and I want to know it and you have to tell me!
You have to tell me, is he alive or not? Is he alive?
Sure, you have to tell me.
Is he alive?
I'll bring him to you madam. I don't want to see you in that black dress.
I'll bring your son, bring him home,
I'm sure.
Even if I have to travel all over Russia.
Anto...
Anto, are you all right?
The rings!
Have you swallowed a ring?
Now what can I do?
They're made out of gold.
What can I do to swallow it.
Drink!
- Where can I find water?
- There, come with me.
It's salty.
The sea is salty.
Well, feel better hope
I digest it... after...
How sweet!
What are talking, I don't understand you. Translate.
Where are you from?
From northern Italy,
600 km from here.
But where precisely?
From Losguardo a small village in the country.
Ah! Then you have a country house, you're a farmer.
Tell me the truth are you a farmer?
Not a farmer, I'm an electrician.
If it wasn't for the war
I would have my electrician degree.
Come on, does my hands look as farmer hands? See how soft they are.
Then, there is nothing wrong with being a farmer.
Was your father a farmer?
No, he was a barber, quite different!
Just imagine!
While my father was alive, it wasn't bad...
I had a good life.
Then I went to live with my sister... she was married to a good person
I don't complain about work...
I'm good at the kitchen.
Very well!
The sand burns...
How much will burn in Africa?
When does your regiment leaves?
The day after tomorrow, but don't make me think as...
And you're going to Africa just because?
Aren't you going to do something to stay?
What can I do?
There must be a way.
Me, I been thinking all day...
Yes? So what can we do?
Don't laugh if I tell you.
Won't laugh, tell me.
Let's get married.
Well, with me or any other.
Whoever pleases you.
You'll get 12 days wedding license.
Twelve days will go by and perhaps then the war is over, who knows?
Or perhaps you won't be sent elsewhere and you'll be able to remain in Italy.
Summarizing, I'm telling you for your own good.
Here in Naples everyone are doing it.
Listen, we're already married.
When
Eh... half an hour ago, here.
Don't joke with this.
See, I'm 32-years-old and unmarried, I will never marry.
I can see that you haven't found someone that you like.
Have found more than twenty.
Mean, ugly, blond, redhead... rich, poor... but when I smell church, I run.
Just imagine! Me marrying a Neapolitan!
Then go to Africa, to war, to heat and to scorpions... tell the angels to care for you and goodbye.
You know what? Better scorpions than marriage!
And who's getting married?
What a head! I forgot to give you the present!
- They are for me?
- Yes.
Madonna, they're beautiful!
Do you like them?
I love them!
Thanks.
But your mother should have come to the wedding. No one does that.
It hurts me more for you than for me.
Don't worry.
My mother is old, stubborn.
Imagine that she thinks that
I'll marry for money.
Money? What money? I have nothing, but you went crazy for me.
Be patient. When we have a child she'll love the kid and you.
I don't want only one child,
I want a large family.
And this? Too much water, Holy Mother!
Don't be mean!
What are you doing?
Anto!
What are those bells?
Anto!
Anto!
What are those bells?
What time it is?
Seven.
Seven in the morning or afternoon?
Who knows...
It's "rinning"...
Translate!
It's raining.
Can't deduce if its morning or afternoon.
There are people going to Church.
Is it Sunday?
Surely.
But, what do we care?
How come we don't care?
We arrived on Thursday.
Let me see... Sunday was yesterday!
Then today must be Monday.
Monday... then we have only 8 days!
It's a wedding, the husband is a soldier.
Holy Mother, I forgot is Alfredo that works with me.
He invited me to the wedding.
Where is my head!
But this Alfredo also married for a license?
I don't know. Could be.
Tell me the truth!
Isn't because you married me only for the license?
Don't be stupid, I married you because I love you.
But you were not sure, you were afraid.
You said that marriage gave you the chills.
- Yes.
- And now, are you still scared?
Giovanna, we need to cover the windows, otherwise we'll get a fine.
They say that the alarm has been given.
Still 6? Ah! it stopped.
It's night must be one o'clock.
I don't want anything illegal!
Are you hungry?
I'll prepare some pasta.
No, you don't move from here.
Today I'm cooking.
- What? You know how to cook?
- Haven't told you?
I'm a magician in the kitchen!
Come on!
What are you doing?
A Frittata.
- How many eggs?
- And who eats 24 eggs?
- My grandmother, my grandmother...
I've eaten with my grandmother the morning after the milling.
Understood?
Lard.
Lard? In these times, where do you find lard?
- Besides Frittata is done with oil.
- My mother does it with lard.
Your mother is wrong as is done with oil.
By the way, she's sick with bronchitis
The bronchitis she catch it on purpose to not meet us.
Don't say that.
Salt.
This is an ugly salt.
Pepper.
Scientific.
Tools.
The military service has spoiled me.
Lost my practice.
Looks like gold, pure gold!
My father soul was what took care of us all.
He was a champ!
A true deli that you have to taste.
- It's ready.
- Me too.
The glasses.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
Smells good.
To us!
Then dessert.
What?
No "mo", no "mo".
Translate!
- Can't talk!
- It's okay... because I love you much.
What a heat! It's suffocating.
I can't breath.
You're revolting... eh!
But how my grandfather did it?
I don't want to see an egg for a month.
Me for a year.
Luckily, I did add onion.
- I'll throw this away.
- Yes, take it out of my sight.
- And this, where did it come from?
- Perhaps my mother sent it.
She knocked the door and we didn't notice.
What are you doing?
You're not leaving them outside, they're my mother's eggs.
I don't want to look at them, at least for 10 years.
And now? Shall we go out?
- And were to?
- Let's go to take some fresh air.
Oh! Sunrise.
At this hour my father was on the fields.
- You have no strength in your legs.
- What are you saying! I'm stronger than you.
I never thought you were that strong.
What are you laughing for?
The eggs.
No, I beg you, my stomach is about to explode.
- I close the eyes and see so many eggs.
- Don't close them then.
But even if I open my eyes
I see them.
Flares!
Be careful!
Stay calm. It's over.
I wasn't afraid.
You made me understand... so many things, Anto.
I want to be with you forever.
Even if it was in the mountains.
How many days have gone by, Anto?
Eight.
No, ten.
Two days!
Only two days.
Help me!
I'll kill you.
Help me!
Stay still, stay still.
Poor woman.
I'll kill everyone!
Anto! What are you doing?
What happened?
Nothing, nothing.
How come nothing?
Nothing... nothing.
Don't know what overcome him.
He was calm and then... he gets white, the eyes full of fury... then comes and puts both hands in the neck, like this...
Had a really bad time!
When coming, he fell to the floor... as people says,
I pour him cold water.
He locked himself in the kitchen and didn't want to come out.
He was yelling,
Dammed the day I married.
What a misfortune. Maybe is over.
Sergeant, here he is!
Antonio
Wait!
Wait a moment!
I'll make him to come out.
Wait a moment!
No, no I'll make him to come out, they won't do any to you, I swear...
Don't harm him!
Antonio, come out, they won't harm you I swear...
Do you her me, Antonio...
Anto.
Release me!
Don't harm him!
I want the Director.
I want to know why I'm inside here.
I'm Saint Joseph.
Yes, he's Saint Joseph, I guarantee it!
Come, madam.
You, you're as crazy as me.
Doctor!
You're lucid and can chose between a process or voluntary leave to Russia.
Stop! The first squad gets into the train to the right...
The second squad into the train to the left...
You have 15 minutes.
Dismiss!
Giovanna we have 15 mins.
Come, come.
- Giovanna!
- Yes?
- I'll come back from Russia soon, you'll see.
- Yes.
- I'll bring you a fur.
- Yes.
The war is over!
Hey! come here. What are you saying?
What is over? -The war.
Do you know him?
Do you know him?
Maria! Maria!
Do you know him?
But this is Antonio.
Is he alive?
- We were together.
- Is he alive?
- Possibly, I don't know.
- How do you know?
Stop!
I've been waiting for this moment many years...
I have to find someone who tells me about him... who has seen him, who met him
Let's sit down, come here.
Is he alive?
Tell me, where have you seen him?
Where did you left him the last time?
Where is he?
- We were together...
- Where?
There, in the mountains.
It was January, an awful month.
The Russians had positioned and we had to take them out no matter what...
You can't imagine, madam, what snow is if you haven't been to Russia
You stay still for 3 mins and you freeze...
Meanwhile, the Russians came from everywhere. It was hell.
We have been inside hell.
The snow, the ice, the wind that cut your face, thirst, hunger.
Always sleepless, night and day...
A true hell.
I don't feel my hands. Damn it.
Here everything is burned.
Where are we going?
Look!
Close that door!
- I can't stand it more!
- Come on, stand up!
Then, when we escaped from the ravine we walked many kilometers in the snow.
Anto! Come on stand up!
Have strength!
Walk!
Anto, you should walk!
Otherwise you'll freeze.
When I turned around, he signaled me to go on, to not think about him.
- That's the last time I saw him.
- You never saw him again?
And you left him there in the snow, without giving him a hand, in the cold...
- What can I do?
- Wasn't anybody there to help you?
What kind of people are they?
I don't know.
Perhaps someone could help you.
Listen...
Come inside, I'll prepare coffee.
No, coffee makes me sick, can't drink it.
I'm happy to see you.
- Want some water?
- No, thanks, no.
- Some cakes?
- No, please, no.
Sit down.
He's alive, I can feel it, he's not dead.
- But if he's alive, why hasn't he written?
- To you or me?
Why he hasn't come back, as many others?
I will go, I go.
Now they say that things have changed.
That now isn't impossible.
They say you can go there.
I'll try.
Even if it was impossible
I will try the same.
- To Russia?
- Yes, to Russia.
So many have tried and didn't make it...
This... is the last photo he sent me.
Look, madam...
He probably had warm with that many clothes...
What are you saying...
If a soldier does not cover like this he dies...
He's alive.
- Spaziva, that's how you say it?
- Yes, Spaziva.
Here some Italian soldiers and
Russian civilians, the Germans make them dig their own graves.
See madam... each sunflower, each tree, each grain field hides the bodies... of Italian soldiers, Russians, Germans and also the bodies of many...
Russian peasants, old, women, children.
I'm sure that my husband is not there.
Antonio is alive.
You have to find peace for your heart, madam.
There are no Italians alive in Russia.
It cannot be!
Alive Italians for sure.
Wounded, some that lost their memory.
Why not? It happens, no?
Me, I know one that came to Moscow to a soccer game have seen one of those Italians.
I have spoken to them.
And what did he say?
No idea what he said.
I know, it is true.
Holy Mother...
This gravestone recalls his fellowmen.
Belongs to a Russian poet.
Young man from Naples, what brings you to this Russian field?
Weren't you happy in your motherland?
Me, that I found you jailed in Moscow... so far away from your land...
Are you Italian?
Italian? No.
You are Italian.
Anyone can tell because your hair, your eyes, everything.
But how can you be ashamed of being Italian? Why you're ashamed?
It is true?
I came here searching for my husband.
But I can't find if he's alive or dead.
You're Italian.
Where are you from?
I was Italian, now I'm Russian.
Why?
Because... because...
It's a long story... the because certain things... happen and that's enough.
No, I don't know him.
I was an alpine man...
If I find something
I swear I'll tell you
Why don't you go home?
Which home?
No.
Do you know him?
Do you know him?
Have you seen him?
Good day!
I know nothing.
It's too hard!
I'm very tired!
Antonio was a dead body.
Almost dead
He was... frozen.
Antonio... has forgotten everything.
Everything, do you understand? and I was always near, always to cure him.
Come.
I don't want to see you anymore!
I don't want to see you anymore!
No you wouldn't... no.
That's not the way it's done!
It's not done like this!
Are you afraid?
No, I'm cold.
Let's take a ride by the village, would you like to?
- Since when do you drive a motorcycle?
- Since I was a kid.
- Are we going down?
- No, it is flat.
There is nothing to be afraid,
I'm an ace at driving.
- Shall we go to the river?
- Yes, let's go.
Damn!
- Are you crazy?
- The damn brakes didn't work!
But straight into the river.
Who could imagine?
We should be glad that nothing happened to us.
I knew I shouldn't come.
If you'd have told me that you never rode a motorcycle...
All right, but is this the way to do it?
There it is!
Take.
Where are you going?
- Home. And I walk.
- Wait!
Don't say!
Want to come in?
Want to sit down?
Did you pull out Antonio?
Yes.
It's better... it would have been better if he's dead!
Better for me, better for you, better for everyone...
Madam, he's alive, has a house, a woman and a little girl.
Antonio!
You like to meddle into gossip...
Do not forget what is more convenient for you.
Hi!
Hello, Giovanna.
Who's speaking?
Giovanna, it's me, Antonio.
It's Antonio.
Giovanna!
Where are you?
I'm here in Milan.
I came looking for you.
Giovanna, when can I see you?
How did you find me?
Went to the village and they gave me your phone number.
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to see you.
No. One moment, just one moment.
I have come from so far away!
Me too, I have traveled so much... day, night until I find you don't make me tell you.
Anto...
I'm not either alone.
Are you with someone?
Yes.
He's a factory worker...
Now he's at the factory has the night shift.
Then we will not met. I'm leaving like if we have never talked... is better like this.
Anyway we have nothing to do you have another woman... and with another woman, I don't want to know anything about you
Then, goodbye Giovanna...
Goodbye Anto... goodbye.
Excuse me...
The strike also applies to international trains?
Where are you going?
To Vienna.
You have to take it tomorrow morning at 6.
Is there another way to do it?
What do you mean?
I have seen a bus service.
Yes, but they go to
Torino, Verona, Novara, Bologna.
They won't take you there.
Everything is a mess with this strike.
There is a bus service that substitutes the train. It's about to leave.
But where do I have to go?
Sorry, I believed...
Saw you buying a present and...
Ah! the doll, no, is for me.
I like them.
Don't you like them?
Listen, can you tell me about a nearby hotel?
Could be The Galia, but...
No, a cheap hotel.
No.
Want to sleep with me?
Where?
There, nearby.
Where are you from?
And where are you?
Do you have a phone?
Yes, here near the door.
- Antonio!
- Yes, listen...
Missed my train, can't leave until tomorrow...
I want to see you.
I have to talk to you.
Tell me where you are.
Ambrosio Giovagnoli Plaza 42.
Wait, I have to write down the address.
Excuse me, do you have a pencil? I have to write...
Only an eyeliner.
Repeat the address.
Ambrosio Giovagnoli Plaza 42, third floor apartment 8.
Thanks.
Listen, how to I call a taxi?
A taxi?
Why?
Are you leaving?
Yes.
But I got naked and the mirror is dirty.
How much you charge?
It's dark, meeting like this in the dark after so much time.
Please let me in.
I'll leave soon.
Yes, sorry.
I'll look for a candle.
Where did I put it?
You're all wet.
No, it's nothing...
Can't believe you're here.
Listen, Giovanna...
I have to explain everything.
I wanted to kill myself, but I understood that you can live without love.
It's true...
I don't know if you know what happened.
I had 1000 km of snow in front of me.
When I opened my eyes...
I was in a house, an unknown house, with a woman I have never seen before.
And I couldn't remember a thing...
For a long time I couldn't remember a thing.
All you're saying
I already know it.
She saved your life. She healed you and gave you everything you needed.
You should have given her many thanks and come back here.
Instead you stayed... and had a child with her.
I felt that it was the only... safe place available for me.
Do you love her?
For me... it has been... as if I was dead...
And afterwards, I was someone else.
Death so close, changes people.
Changes the feelings.
I don't know how to explain...
Me, with her...
I found some peace.
How can I make you understand.
I came because I believed that...
I could easily explain everything to you.
War is ugly.
It was...
It was like that...
Ugly, Giovanna.
It was difficult...
I don't know why it happened.
I look for a candle.
Don't look at me like that.
I've aged.
You also have become an old man.
Everything is a disaster.
How much white hair!
Antonio!
Come back to me.
I still love you.
And you still love me,
I can feel it.
How could I go back to you?
How could I go back to you?
The baby.
Have you understood, Anto?
But I can't leave you like this.
I'll take you with me.
We will start a new life in another place.
And where would you take me with this child?
And you also have a daughter.
We will ruin the kids and you.
My love.
- What's his name?
- Antonio.
Like me.
No, Antonio like Saint Anthony.
I brought you...
I promised you.
[ Skipped item nr. 1 ]
[ Skipped item nr. 2 ]
Left, two, three, four!
Company,,, halt!
Weapons straight ahead!
Take cover!
On your feet and march!
Take cover!
Left face!
Left, two, three, four.
Company, halt!
We're so exhausted.
A German must never fear fatigue.
Karl, I'm not complaining.
Damned chicken!
Fifty plus 1 0 equals 60, my friend.
Did you count my king?
This is a republic.
Kings don't count here.
This is how you dress when visiting a foreign land?
Candles, socks...
Mr. Haussmann, your bill is ready.
It comes to 57 francs and 7 5 centimes... barring any error, of course.
I trust you, Mr. Rechampot.
You'll be paid within three months, as usual.
I'm not worried.
You always pay on time.
Maryvonne?
Come down here.
Our friend is about to leave.
- What?
- He's leaving.
He's leaving.
Let's have one last drink.
Alas, I cannot.
You mustn't insult us.
A quick one will do you good.
The road is long.
I must be back by tomorrow evening.
Exactly.
It'll give you strength.
Another time, madam.
So, my friend.
At ease.
If we weren't here to keep them supplied, the Germans would be in trouble.
Please convey my respects to your priests.
I'm sure they're out in the bush making new Christians.
They'll be back in two weeks, if they're not eaten alive fiirst.
Attention!
Take up your packs!
Hurry up over there!
Faster!
On the double!
Company, right face!
Forward march!
Good Lord.
He works them hard!
Give my best to your offiicers!
Jawohl, madam. I'll do that.
That's all well and good... but let's have a drink before Mr. Rechampot sells it all.
Look at this, all broken and beat up.
What can I give you for that?
Here, I'll give you a cross.
Now go on.
Let me see.
Here.
This Sacred Heart card is very nice.
Tell him a Sacred Heart is more than fair.
That's not even worth a cross.
He says he wants the big colored statue of the woman and child.
He says his necklace is extremely valuable.
Then he can keep his necklace and I'll keep my Sacred Heart.
I'll give you a cross for the rest and off with you!
This is really getting on my nerves!
- You shouldn't expect much here.
- They know us too well.
Next.
Fidele.
HAPPY NEW YEAR 1 91 5
Yes, Sergeant?
Nothing.
I thought you might want to talk about... the younger sister of my brother-in-law's cousin.
The one I spoke to you about.
No, it was nothing.
Just talking.
But the young girl says... she can do everything just the way you like it.
Who taught her?
The old woman who comes often to visit you.
Tell her to come knock at my door one evening.
I'll do that.
You'll be pleased.
Leon?
Come on.Just for me.
I'm not in the mood.
The appetite grows with the eating.
Come on.
What's wrong?
Don't you ever get excited anymore?
To Mr. Lucien Herr,
College of Advanced Education...
45 rue d'Ulm,
Fifth Arrondissement, Paris... in care of Administrator Tarato...
St. Pierre de Samba,
French Equatorial Africa.
Fort Coulais,January 6, 1 9 1 5.
Dear teacher and, if I may, dear friend.'
Here is my punishment for not excelling in nobler gfields of study.
I should be teaching Greek in one of those pleasant schools... of which our province is so proud... but instead here I am under a summer sky... wandering through virgin savannahs... picking native grasses and collecting mineral specimens.
What good fortune to be a simple geographer.!
Africa is far from being the hell depicted in writings from the colonies.
Where I expected to encounter gfierce beasts...
I fiind only dogs, cows, chickens... and the occasional duck.
Where I expected ferocious savages... armed with spears, lances and poisoned arrows... ready to turn all travelers into a quick meal...
I meet only peaceful villagers... whose pastoral lives remind me... of the country folk in many parts of our own land.
The only dangers I battle here are boredom... and the company of a handful of our compatriots... with whom I must rub elbows.
Listen,just because it's my turn to be on watch tonight... you don't have to take such a long siesta.
Don't worry.
There's lots more for you.
The bastard!
Where are those empire builders... those modern-day knights and intrepid pioneers... that all those adventure novels had us dreaming of?.
Payback!
So I feel quite alone here.
Moreover, it's been six months... since we've had any visitors or correspondence.
It seems such delays are not unusual in this part of Africa.
But I'm longing to know what is happening in Paris these days.
What are they playing at the theater and the opera?
What is Debussy composing?
What is Peguy up to?
And what's new with our socialist friends?
As for the colonies, tell our friends not to be so sure... about the inferiority of the black race.
Seen up close, this inferiority has less to do with the shape of the skull... or the composition of the blood... than with the conviction we hold of our own superiority.
At the risk of shocking you...
I daresay that in many respects... the natives are not far from meriting the honored name of''men. ''
Thank you, Barthelemy.
Dear teacher, I wish you a happy and peaceful 1 9 1 5.
Respectfully yours...
Hubert Fresnoy.
There's no end to this junk.
Garbage!
This one's not too bad.
This we'll keep too.
Like the monsignor says, you can't even give this stuff away to charity.
In the provinces, maybe.
Bad taste has limits even in the provinces.
How I love this song!
Oh, my back!
- Thomas, how are you?
- Fine, Father.
- Are you here all alone?
- All alone.
- The other fathers aren't here?
- No.
But surely they'll be returning tonight?
I don't know.
Have they been gone a long time?
- Long time.
- Long time very much?
Long time a little.
And they left no word for us?
They said monsignor said they should join him.
What's all this about?
I don't know.
Didn't anything arrive for us at Fort Coulais?
Nothing.
So there is something after all.
This isn't for us?
Not for you.
It's for the young man who loves plants.
And where does that young man live?
Fort Coulais.
And where do we live?
You live at Fort Coulais.
But this isn't for us?
It's for you.
Great! Something to read!
Jaures has been assassinated!
Who?
- Who?
-Jaures.
Go on.
Mr. Hubert, you mustn't get upset.
God in Heaven!
My friends, we're at war.
Who is ''we''?
Us. France.
What's the date on that, Father?
- August 3rd.
- My God.
Does it say how it turned out?
They only go up to August 1 3th.
Who are we at war with, Father?
Germany, of course!
Really?
I would have said the English.
- Damn it!
- What?
That means I'm out
57 francs and 7 5 centimes!
Germany's never going to pay now!
What?
Germany.
- It's right out there!
- So?
The Krauts are out there!
That's right!
Luckily they can't know yet.
Everything comes through us.
- You hear that, Bosselet?
- It's time to wake up.
What are you so excited about?
- We're not excited!
- Yes, you are.
Remember: The military authorities take charge in a case like this.
Exactly!
And around here, that's you!
In any case, it's clear:
The motherland is in danger.
Vive la France.!
Aren't you going to say
Vive la France?
You can't do that.
Imagine how you'd look.
- Like French patriots, that's how!
- French patriots!
How do you even know this war isn't already over?
How can it be over?
It's hardly gotten started!
Mr. Rechampot, your little expedition could turn out very badly.
Something like that takes preparation, believe me.
And be careful about declaring war on the Germans. They're no amateurs!
- There's only three of them!
- And they're all fools.
And I'd say their leader, Mr. Krafft, in not much different than you.
All brains and no brawn!
Mr. Krafft doesn't seem to me a man of action.
Please, Father, stay out of this.
Ever heard of Alsace and Lorraine?
Maybe I never told you... but I'm from Alsace.
Couldn't you show a little spirit at a moment like this?
To fiight three Germans who've never done you any harm... you so-called Christians--
- What do you mean, so-called?
- That's right.
You're willing to risk massacring dozens of men!
What men?
There are only us and the blacks here, and at most a few soldiers.
That's enough, Mr. Rechampot!
Watch your tone, young man!
I'm on my home turf here!
- Anyway, this is a discussion for men!
- I am a businessman, sir!
In light of the law ofJuly 7, 1 900, on organizing a colonial army... and the decree of February 7, 1 91 2, and subsequent dates... on recruiting an army... and in light of certain indications of the existence of a state of war... between France and Germany... and in light of the responsibility vested in me...
I, Sergeant Auguste Bosselet... hereby call upon every man of French nationality... with permanent or temporary residence... at Fort Coulais in French Equatorial Africa... to place himself at my command.
Article Number 1 :
A general draft is now in force.
This is better than a New Year's Eve party!
Hey, Marius, they're celebrating something.
Maybe that way they'll leave us alone tomorrow.
Residents of Fort Coulais... the Republic needs you.
In the name of France,
I call upon all able-bodied natives... of the masculine sex... wishing to volunteer to support France for the duration of hostilities.
The engagement of such volunteers will go forward legally.
They will be provided with clothes, shoes and equipment... as supplies permit.
As a special bonus... each man will receive, while supplies last... a useful household item provided by the House of Rechampot.
Registration is now open.
Go on and join.
I'm glad that's over with.
These men don't understand French.
Someone should interpret.
What does it matter? If they don't understand now, they soon will.
Anyway, I'm sure they agree.
Perhaps.
But it should be explained to them.
Marius, did you understand all that?
How would I not understand?
- Then you could explain to them.
- Of course I could.
What are you doing here?
Get the hell back to the store!
Step forward!
Did you see that?
Nobody helps out anymore.
Press your fiinger here.
Open your mouth.
We need to fiind you a name.
Let's see.
Saturnin.
Your name will be Armand.
What is it, son?
Don't like that one?
Then give him a different one.
I wrote down two and only give him one.
Jerome.
Open your mouth.
Alexis.
You are Volunteer Hippolyte.
Hippolyte.
I know your sister.
That's two, four, six, eight--
Two, three, four, fiive, six--
Out of my way.
Two, four, six, eight, 1 0, 1 2.
I counted 1 2 this morning.
That makes 1 2 rifles on the table... plus fiive hunting rifles, one of which is an automatic.
- I want that one back.
- Okay. Return to owner.
So six and six is 1 2, and six is--
And six is 1 8.
Hey, knock it off!.
You're making me lose count.
Six and fiive makes 1 1 .
Six and fiive make 1 1 , plus six make 1 7, plus 1 2--
Seventeen and--
Twenty-nine.
- Seventeen and 1 2 make 29.
- Whatever you say.
Twenty-nine?
Hell, this should be over quickly.
We've got fiive dry cases and two slightly damp cases of cartridges.
You see, Bosselet?
God is on our side.
Of course. God is French!
All right.
I'll need a week to teach the volunteers the bare rudiments.
What? A week?
Are you crazy?
We're not running a pension! They don't eat much, but it costs all the same.
All they need to know is how to load a gun!
They may well be idiots, but they can learn that in a day!
The regulations dictate a certain minimum instruction.
Don't think you're going to make these men into a real army!
You may not realize it, but we've been at war for six months now!
If you're looking for the element of surprise, Bosselet, don't draw this out.
You're right, Father.
I propose Sunday.
- Sunday?
- Why not?
You mean this Sunday?
Are you crazy?
We'd have to leave tomorrow night.
Exactly!
Sunday is when Protestants put on their big show in church.
They're distracted.
We show up and -- pow!
We'll give them a blessing, all right!
Without getting into that... you can't go wrong choosing the Lord's day.
Still, tomorrow night...
That's not much time.
Clear the way!
Thank you, Lamartine.
So, my son, you chose the infantry?
I'd like to speak to you about something.
I intend to visit the Germans without delay.
If Mr. Krafft is indeed as much like me as you say...
I should have no trouble persuading him... that with ten against one, resistance is pointless.
But my plan would be more effective and persuasive... if one of you would accompany me.
No, Mr. Fresnoy.
Why?
You don't know the Germans.
You can't comprehend the German mentality.
At the moment it's yours I can't comprehend.
Look at this chic fellow!
You haven't seen my brother yet.
Fathers, take a look at the ambassadors of French style.
Ladies, are you going to keep us waiting much longer?
We're almost ready.
Look at her tiny waist!
A delicate orchid.
She's so pretty!
It's now 9:1 2.
9:1 2 on January 22, 1 91 5.
We're preparing to go forth from our native land.
The land where life is sweet ends right here.
Over there is enemy territory... which we will conquer by force.
That over there could easily be the Rhine.
In fact, it is.
Let us cross the Rhine... even if, due to unfortunate circumstances... it is but a modest stream.
I must set an example.
Bosselet, send the flag over.
The flag has made it.
This is so exciting!
There it is.
We're there.
I recognize this spot.
Through that shrubbery.
Those two white spots.
Next to the cliff.
That's their base.
No use going on much further.
It's too hot.
Bosselet, we'll leave you here.
We're stopping here, but you keep on.
See you later.
But we're with you in spirit!
Here.
There's shade... and a nice view, and we're not too close.
We'll stop here.
Stop.
Halt!
The House of Rechampot is proud to bring you... an aperitif of noble and patriotic character... that you won't fiind at even the best seaside resorts.
Perhaps even Mr. Hubert... our Marquis of Geography, will do us the honor of--
Where is Hubert?
- Where is he?
- He was back there.
There he is.
Don't go! Come back, Fresnoy!
Are you crazy?
Get over there!
Listen to me, son.
You'd had some schooling.
I'm sure you're a real brain, but this is our home and our business!
These are serious and tragic events, bigger than all of us.
This is war, son, and we're all in it together.
You've been drafted like everyone else.
He thought he was beyond the law.
Hard to understand such a mentality.
Your fiield may be geography... but what we're creating here is history!
Marius, give me that bottle.
You'll drink like everyone else.
Weak stomach or no weak stomach, you'll drink to France.
Assomption!
Mr. Rechampot asked me to fiind out when your chickens will be ready.
- It's starting!
- To our brave soldiers!
That's the way, Bosselet.
He's really letting them have it.
Listen.
Pass me a little--
That's called a machine gun.
What? What did he say?
A machine gun, madam.
I think they're right.
The bastards!
Whatever it is... if it keeps up like that...
I'd say it's time to close up shop.
QUick, get everything together.
Hurry!
What does that fellow want?
- What's he saying?
- The volunteer says, ''I fell in a hole.
I didn't see it.
It was hidden by branches.
At the bottom of the hole was a sharp stick.''
The volunteer says, ''You must go fiind my friend in the other hole.
The stick stuck him in the butt and he can't pull it out.''
Virgin Mary, have mercy.
Others are coming!
It's nothing. It's nothing!
The volunteer says, ''I fell in a hole, and in the hole was a--''
Yes, we know!
Damn it! This can't be!
Look at that!
Go away!
Go away!
You know any doctors in the area?
There are no doctors here!
Come on, come on!
Father.
We really only lost the bugler, after all.
So let the Krauts come anytime.
We've still got fiive soldiers.
I say they won't come.
And so what if they do?
The Germans aren't total savages.
We know them, after all.
White men can always reason with one another.
Unless we killed one of them.
What are you saying?
We didn't have time.
Don't worry.
We put up a pathetic fiight.
Go on! Have you no shame?
We recovered everything, sir.
Nothing is missing.
You witnessed my fiirst defeat.
You couldn't well have witnessed my second, now, could you... since this was my fiirst battle.
Make no mistake about it:
With their weapons, they can slaughter us anytime they want.
We're in a bad mess.
Very bad.
I acted like an idiot.
No surprise there.
I am one.
Not tonight, darling.
This isn't the time.
Come back some other night.
It's me, Sergeant.
Forgive me, Mr. Fresnoy.
What's going on?
What's the matter?
I'd like to speak with you... because I know you and I understand each other.
That's very kind of you to say.
Because I'm--
Five years away from retirement.
I was just putting it all down in my report.
Too bad we lost the bugler.
They gave us six soldiers and we have to return six to them.
They're counted the same as white men.
You may have to account for him one day... but I know you were pressured... by certain people around here taking the law into their own hands.
I wasn't keen on it.
You think those people can get us out of the fiix they've put us in?
If you only knew them.
They're...
What do you plan to do now?
Finish my report.
What I meant is, do you know where you're heading?
For the time being,
I've taken certain precautions.
And what about later?
Do you have a plan?
Yes, I do.
No, I have no plan.
Sit down.
I have a few ideas to propose to remedy the situation.
I know one doesn't learn how to fiight a war from books... and you know me primarily as a geographer.
But I've also studied a bit of history.
I'm sure you have, Mr. Fresnoy.
Idea number one:
War is too serious to leave to shopkeepers.
I agree entirely.
Then follow me.
What is it?
Another of his nightmares.
I was dreaming--
You sure were.
There's someone here.
No, Assomption, there's no one here.
Everything's fiine.
I said, ''There's someone here,'' but they don't answer.
It's us, Father.
Ah, it's you.
Forgive us for disturbing your sleep.
We weren't asleep.
Sergeant Bosselet feels the moment has come... to calculate the consequences of yesterday's unfortunate expedition.
He's asked me to study how best to correct the situation... and I accepted.
But I'm well aware any effort will be of little use... unless our entire community is behind it.
That's why we've come to consult with you.
Well done.
We appreciate your initiative.
I consider a German attack unlikely for the next few nights.
They'll need to check up on their equipment fiirst.
So the danger-- the immediate danger-- will begin Thursday or Friday night.
A very brief delay.
You're right.
That doesn't leave us much time.
Also, given the improvised... not to say idiotic, nature... of our demonstration... it's clear we should expect no mercy.
Especially, Father, given the ''German mentality.''
I'm afraid you're right.
Then we agree. Sergeant?
Please assemble our friends in the clubhouse in ten minutes.
The clubhouse in ten minutes.
Do we need to be there too?
Yes, of course.
What is all this about?
I won't be led around by the nose!
This is a republic!
Damn it, we're free men!
Paul.
Stop being an idiot.
Mr. Rechampot... what do you propose?
We're here to listen to everyone's ideas.
Do you know what you want?
Of course I do.
We want...
We don't want the Germans to come here.
And if they do?
If they do... we surrender.
Maybe you, but not me.
I won't surrender.
A Frenchman never surrenders if he can do otherwise.
That's what I meant.
If Mr. Fresnoy fiinds a way... of course I would not surrender.
Just think of my inventory.
So, Mr. Fresnoy, here is my answer:
If they come, we don't surrender.
But... they mustn't come.
- They mustn't come.
- We won't surrender.
We won't surrender if they come, but they mustn't come.
If that's what you expect of me,
I have a few ideas to propose.
One thing is certain:
Mr. Rechampot has just said he has substantial inventory.
Substantial... but not enormous!
Paul, don't start.
When destiny places you in challenging circumstances... you must forget you're a businessman.
Precisely, Mr. Templier.
I propose you set out for St. Pierre de Samba tomorrow.
Yes, Mr. Hubert.
Sergeant Bosselet will give you a sealed envelope... which you will hand over to the military authorities.
Your mission is to bring back precise instructions... and all the men and equipment you can fiind.
Why me?
I have a store to run.
Everyone has a store to run.
Do as he says.
But there are two of you.
Why doesn't your brother go?
Because my brother is... an idiot!
You've been chosen... because you're best suited to such a sensitive mission.
Let's not get bogged down in shop talk.
Especially since the store is not very busy right now.
I could take care of it myself.
It seems everyone agrees.
- Yes, we do.
- Certainly.
And how will you defend us until reinforcements arrive?
The sergeant admitted his volunteers keep disappearing.
We shouldn't expect miracles, you know.
We're dreadfully low on natives.
You said it, not me.
We shouldn't expect miracles... and that's not what I expect of you.
Mr. Hubert.
What's going to happen?
Why, you're nervous too!
What's to become of us?
I'm frightened.
Jacques.
- Come with me.
- Where?
Come give me a hand.
Put your hands like this.
For you, me and Maryvonne, in case things go sour.
QUiet, you fool!
We should add some sugar... green beans, corned beeF and sardines.
And maybe a few bottles of wine?
Right. And we'll tell 'em it all went missing.
Please, the floor pads.
Of course.
Good day, Mr. Fresnoy.
Be seated.
Well?
The men have fled.
The villages are empty.
- All of them?
- Every one.
Yet as of this morning we know for certain... that Lieutenant Krafft is recruiting.
And successfully, too.
Do you have something to propose?
Unfortunately, no.
The drums warn them the minute we leave here.
There's nothing we can do about their drums.
True.
There's nothing we can do.
Convey my greetings to the chief.
The chief says...
''It's a great honor to welcome the chieF of the white men in my home.''
Tell the chief I've come because his village is in great danger.
The chief says, ''I know.''
Tell him the men of his village have attacked white men.
Now the German white men want their revenge... and they're very ferocious.
The chief says, ''I know.''
To defend his village, the French will need 1 00 men.
He says, ''I don't have 1 00 men.
I lost many of my best men in the great battle.''
The French know the tribes on the savannah have many men.
If the chief can bring us many of those men... the men of his village will no longer need to fiight.
The chief says,
''I can capture many of those savages.
There are many of them.
They are strong but stupid.''
He says...
''The people of my village have never liked the people of the savannah.''
He says,
''Why didn't you think of this sooner?''
Come along.
Mr. Fresnoy is waiting.
So how many have they captured for us now?
I say, how many have they captured for us now?
Counting the ones from this morning, 1 9.
Say what you like... that man's really something.
He's something, all right.
And you only see him from a distance.
To really know him, you have to live with him.
Well, I don't live with him... and I daresay I was opposed... but I do recognize... that's he's a real brain.
What is he really like in private?
Is he nice?
No, nice isn't the word.
I mean, he may be that, but it's more like he's... he's...
He's what?
He's terribly refiined.
Terribly refiined.
And he hasn't changed.
We used to say he was like a young schoolboy... a bit taken with his own learning.
But I'm here to tell you:
Despite his education, he's a real man.
I'll bet the poor baby's still a virgin.
I wouldn't put my hand in the fiire on it.
That's not where you're supposed to put your hand, you fool!
Madame Rechampot!
Madame times two!
The things she says!
Don't be embarrassed, Madame Caprice.
To Mr. Hubert!
On your inventory declaration... you listed only 1 7 5 pounds of sugar.
Precisely.
And even that is gone.
Demand has been very high.
With everything going on,
I haven't had a delivery since...
June of last year.
- Madame Caprice is in the same boat.
- Yes, the poor dear.
Yet she has listed
300 pounds of sugar.
Marius!
There are white men talking here!
It's the broom making the noise.
Of course, they have a different clientele.
They're small retailers, while we're wholesalers.
Wholesale, right.
Very well. We'll see.
As strange as it sounds... a wholesaler will sometimes have less stock than a retailer.
But please go ahead and look around.
Mr. Fresnoy.
My brother made me do it!
What a liar!
Who hid those things there?
Did you hide those things there?
''The yellow-speckled leaF in the fecund autumn... surrenders gently all its golden grapes to the fruit-gatherers.
Thus will fall the passing flowers of life... youth, love, pleasure and beauty.''
Drink that.
Drink it. It's the white man's drink.
Makes you strong.
It's good for you.
That makes 20.
An even 20.
It's getting harder every day.
They haven't captured one in three days.
I asked for 1 00 men, not 20 invalids.
If the chief thinks he can put one over on us, he's wrong.
Why not take it up with him?
Tell the chief I didn't come to listen to this idle chatter.
He promised me many natives.
He hasn't kept his promise.
Therefore I won't keep mine either, and his men will have to fiight.
The chief says some of the captives know where the natives are hiding.
Well? Haven't his men been able to make them talk?
The chief says they tried... but those captives won't talk.
You'd have to torture them brutally.
Damn it!
He's coming this way.
Is it serious?
Not serious. Important.
Let's see it.
It's not for you.
It's for your brother.
My brother?
I no longer have a brother!
It's for you, Cain!
Look at the yellow belly!
''Decision No. 23:
A military squad is hereby established to obtain the necessary information... for the recruitment of a native militia... to aid in the defense of Fort Coulais.
The squad will be led by
Mr. Rechampot,Jacques Victor Louis.''
Signed, Fresnoy.
And that fiixes you.
Say something, idiot!
I'm so happy!
Look at that moron!
Bravo,Jacques!
See what you can do when you set your mind to it?
Hurrah for the squad!
These men are tall.
The ones they caught before were all so short.
Long live Mr. Fresnoy!
- The priests wish to see you.
- Show them in.
The floor pads.
Be seated.
It's like this:
FatherJohn of the Cross and myself were thinking... perhaps it might be helpful--
To help you get a fuller picture of the delicate issues in this situation.
Issues which, under the circumstances... one might be tempted to deem secondary... but which, nonetheless, must never be entirely neglected... by a Christian conscience.
I'm listening.
Certain murmurings and rumors...
From native sources,
I hasten to add. lead us to fear that certain means have been used... to attain certain ends.
Highly commendable ends.
Means which are-- how can I say?
Not in keeping with the respect due... even to God's most humble creatures.
Mr. Rechampot is following my orders in an attempt to ensure your safety.
The thing is, we've heard rumors... of brutality and injuries--
Did you hear rumors when the wounded were left to rot in the sun?
Was there any talk of the Christian consciences... who fled those people in their moment of agony... without offering even a drink of water?
Or of the Christian consciences who refused to lift a fiinger... to prevent that massacre?
Remember: I didn't ask for this war.
The knife.
The cartridge.
The rifle.
Good day, Sergeant.
Good day, Mr. Fresnoy.
- The bayonet.
- The bay-net.
The coast is clear!
Assomption, get the bicycle!
Our Lord Jesus Christ.
White men are stronger than black men. Why?
Because they have a better god!
The white man's god gives strength!
This is a bicycle.
Any black man who tries to ride it falls.
Who wants to try? You?
See what the white man's god can do.
The recruit says...
''That's a white man's machine.
But the white man's God doesn't give strength to the black man.''
Then watch this.
Assomption, it's your turn.
This man is black... but he believes in the white man's god.
Halt! Who goes there?
Creuse.
Don't be an idiot.
It's me-- Caprice.
- Creuse.
- What do you mean, Creuse?
It's the password.
You have to answer Chef-lieu Gueret.
Oh. Well, then, Chef-lieu Gueret.
Very well. You may pass.
Good evening, Mr. Caprice.
Good night, Mr. Caprice.
Gueret la Creuse is the password?
Well!
No one can go in.
No one can go in.
Isn't Fresnoy in?
Mr. Fresnoy is in.
What's it for?
That's my business.
Did I ask you anything?
Give me that doorknob.
You can't have it.
Things not going well today, pal?
My name is not ''pal.''
I am Barthelemy.
Do you know who I am?
You're Mr. Caprice.
- You know where I've come back from?
- Yes. St. Pierre de Samba.
Fill in this form.
Watch it.
Don't play games with me.
I'm warning you.
Mr. Fresnoy's been expecting me for three months.
I've worked my ass ofF for three months... rounding up grenades and everything else for him!
Very good.
How many cases?
Bastard!
Must not disturb.
You will see boss Sunday.
You can't be serious.
With a black woman?
Just like I said.
Him!
Bosselet I can understand.
But him?
Is she pretty?
Pretty?
She's black, like the others.
Just shows you everyone has their share of misery.
How awful.
Mr. Caprice, you were assigned a diffiicult mission in every respect.
I'd like to state publicly... that you carried it out in exemplary fashion.
Madam, you can be proud of your husband.
Thank you, Mr. Hubert.
I'm sorry. Mr. Fresnoy.
Mr. Fresnoy, please take your place.
Attention!
Right shoulder... arms!
Present arms!
Company at ease!
I wish you all a pleasant Sunday.
I hope you'll stay with us.
Please.
Alas, we must get back.
Ladies, gentlemen.
He's leaving?
Well, that's that.
Before we go back...
I want to show you how they manage with the grenades.
Good idea.
It'll give 'em some practice.
That didn't go down well with me.
I didn't fiind it heavy at all.
I'm not talking about the mutton!
I'm talking about him and his black woman.
Let us not judge, ladies.
True, there are some bizarre quirks in that young man's nature... and his attitude seems designed to provoke us.
But we must at least give him credit... for guaranteeing our peace and security.
And for giving us back so quickly our accustomed lifestyle.
Long live the Republic!
Charge!
He's brilliant.
He took them by surprise.
- I didn't see it coming.
- Me neither.
Of course not.
First section.
Come on, men!
Line up for your wine!
You didn't drink it!
Open your mouth or you can't drink.
Good, eh?
It's the real stuff.
Go now, quickly.
Congratulations. It's as good a trench as we saw in the newspapers.
And without the mud, too.
That's for sure.
With Mr. Fresnoy in charge... we won't wait for the rainy season to give the Krauts a trouncing.
Soldiers of the French, surrender.!
We have machine guns.!
We have warm clothes.! you don't stand a chance.
It's not true.
We're going to win.
God's on our side.
Take heart!
The Lord is with you.
- How are things?
- All right.
- There's one man in bad shape.
- Inside?
Let's go.
What a mess!
He's in sad shape.
- Are we losing a lot of them?
- Two or three a week.
This one here is the sixth this week.
Can't you do anything for him?
Wait for the rain to stop.
The French are using you.! you die to save their skin.!
Germany is kind to us.!
ComeJoin us.!
France says go to hell!
Tell him everything you just told me.
I have run a very long way.
The priests and ladies sent me to say they're coming with soldiers... who wish to speak to you.
What's he talking about?
- Have they sent reinforcements?
- You're not lying, are you?
- Are you pulling our leg?
- I saw the soldiers with my own eyes.
French soldiers?
Not French.
Krauts?
No, not Krauts.
Then who are they?
I don't know.
How am I supposed to know?
But their chief is a black man.
There they are.
Let go of my foot, for God's sake!
Give me your hand.
They're coming out into the open now.
Now I see them!
Move over a bit.
What if the branch breaks?
We have to let Bosselet know.
Absolutely not.
I shall translate... what the captain says.
The Germans surrendered at Yaounde... quite a while ago.
The Allies decided to send
Captain Kapoor here... with a letter that reads as follow:
''To the Germans still fiighting:
There's no point.
The war is over. Stop it.''
We beat 'em!
The Germans are to surrender... only to Captain Kapoor.
Perhaps you're wondering why.
Because the Allies decided in London... that this territory should be ceded to His Gracious Majesty.
We have come to take possession of it.
Where do we come in?
I'm sure the captain would like to freshen up.
Nice uniforms!
Hey, you, the smart one.
Come over here.
Come here for a minute.
Tell me, did this agreement in London... say that our land will remain part of France?
It will still be France up to the point... where it used to be Germany?
Exactly.
So that means only one thing will change:
The blacks who were German before... will now become English.
Exactly.
Let me tell you something:
It serves 'em right!
Arms!
Mr. Krafft.
Come closer. Don't be shy.
How are you?
What a nasty business, eh?
My brother.
Let me introduce Mr. Fresnoy.
He's the young man who gave you so much trouble.
If it weren't for him, you might have--
- You put on some weight.
- He looks good!
Yes, Sergeant?
Nothing.
White people.
Really!
Listen, don't worry about that bill.
We'll work it out.
Philology?
Yes, I was tempted at one point.
But I must say, our philologists can't hold a candle to yours.
- Which university did you study at?
- Heidelberg.
Of course.
This will give you a laugh:
I was a socialist.
Oh, sorry.
Me too.

It does, Sir Henry.
Excellently.

MEN SHOUT ORDERS
You moved!
You moved.
Go and tell the NCO of that black shambles that you love him more than you love me.
Now!
You're not fit to be in the British Army, you different-coloured articles. Straighten up!
I'm to tell you, Corporal, that I love you more than my colour sergeant.
That's frightening. Get out of my bloody sight!
Put your rifle over your head and double round this field till you drop bloody dead!
Now move! Get on with it! At the double!
Get back in the ranks, you shower of animals!
Company... shoulder arms!
Present arms!
Over here, boys! Over here!
Come on, here we go.
No, no! One at a time.
What do you want?
What do you need, eh?
Candles? ..The money, please.
SPEAKS AFRIKAANS Are you passing through?
We've come to fight the Zulu. We aren't at war yet. Bit young.
My nephew. He can shoot, track, speak Zulu and fight. He's got assegai marks to prove it.
Show him.
- You! - Sir!
Take them to the orderly officer. Colour Sergeant!
This way.
Company...'shun!
Move yourselves!
Shall I give the order, sir? All right, Sergeant.
SIKALI HORSE, FORWARD!
Splendid horsemanship. Who are they?
Sikali Horse, my lord. Christians all. I know each man by name.
Do they come well recommended? They rode for me at Bushman's Pass.
Oh, indeed.
Crealock, see that Col Durnford has an officer for his hard riders - the subaltern from the 24th.
It might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Yes. I see you issued each of them with a Martini-Henry carbine.
Our quota for natives - one rifle to ten men and five rounds per rifle. Will they make good use of them?
They're as good marksmen as horsemen.No doubting their horsemanship, Col Durnford.
Crealock.
We'll think how to make best use of Col Durnford's African knowledge.
Col Durnford. William Vereker.Yes? I hear you're seeking officers.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot.
Private Williams!
You've stopped.
THEY SPEAK BANTU
Mr Raw!
Take Mr Vereker to the store and see he's issued the necessary equipment.
And then show him to the mess and explain to him how an officer's expected to behave.
Our good Col Durnford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
It's rumoured Lord Chelmsford's to make Durnford second-in-command. Typical of Her Majesty's Army!
Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.Now, now, Mr Melvill. Less of your spleen.
Stranger in the mess! Gentlemen, my lord.
Announce yourself.
Good day, Frederick.
Good day, William.
Pleased you could join us.It was that or join the Zulu.Join the Zulu?
Oh, yes, you're in the thick of it.
Your father said you were farming near Zululand.
Sent his regards, should I meet up with you.
That's nice of the old boy. You'd better call out who you are.
William Vereker.
Sgt Murphy, bring drinks for the stranger.
Allow me to introduce the mess.
Col Pulleine.
Messrs Melvill,
Coghill,
Jackson,
Milne, Major Russell, Stevenson... How do you do?
Harford and Harford's best friend.
Don't leave your gin around, or Harford will have it full of preserved butterflies.
Damn waste, if you ask me.
There's a shortage of that where I've been.
They fight with spears, don't they? Is that fair against a Martini-Henry?
Did you really choose between Britain and the Zulu?
A damn close thing it was, too. Ah, well done, Murphy.
Stranger's cup. Down it in one and we share your mess bill for a week.
And if I don't? You buy a bottle of good claret for each mess member.
If it's too much, we'll forward the bill to your father in the House of Lords. No offence meant, Vereker.
No offence taken, Melvill.
To men who aren't afraid to speak their minds.
< Good luck, sir.

Joseph! How are the Colenso girls?
They're all in the garden, sir. They'll be glad to see you, I'm sure.
Ready? Right!
Oh, you beast!
Somebody! Ah, that fooled you!
Tipped it! Out! I did not!
William!
You cheat! You!
Me cheat?! Same old Fanny!
Welcome! Welcome back!
Excuse me, ladies.
Did you get your farm going?
Yes, I did.
How was it?
I've never been so happy.
Sorry you had to leave.
You've met the Hon William Vereker, I believe.
Yes. We were childhood friends.
Your childhood friend shot a dead cow at the gallop yesterday.
Most impressive!
There is a Mrs Durnford, is there?
She exists but nothing's been heard of her the eight years Durnford's been in Africa.
Although much is spoken of her now, my lord.
I recommended him to you because he knows Africa so well.
Indeed. His ability to recruit native contingents is proving invaluable.
How do you rate him as a soldier?
It is widely held he has courage and he's an excellent engineer.
Shall we join the guests?
Do you think she might become interested in...someone?
Which one? The one who keeps looking at me.
Could be you flatter yourself - it's her odd eye.
They must've locked the good ones up!
Ah! General!
Do you find our border country congenial, my lord?
Landscape - congenial, ma'am. As a border - vulnerable.
Do you really think Cetshwayo will attack us?
The intention of the Zulu Impi and their king concern me deeply.
He has no intention of attacking Natal - unless he's given no option.
He has no quarrel with us.
How rare to meet a young lady interested in tactical matters!
Is it not most rare?
You are talking of a violent and murdering barbarian with an army of 30,000 warriors just across the river.
My father has lived with the Zulus for many years.
Cetshwayo massacred 20,000 people to become king!
The English Tudor kings did no less - much later in our nation's history, I might add.
And the French, much more recently.
That may well be, your grace, but be that as it may, my duty is clear...
..the defence of all this - Natal.
Yes.
Well, it's difficult to stand against that position -
IF you speak only of defence.
And what does our good Col Durnford think? >
If the people of Natal wish to feel safe, let them persuade their husbands and sons to volunteer. We need officers and men.
We do, Colonel. Good point.
I cannot be brought to believe that Cetshwayo wants a war with Britain.
Every Zulu is raised to be a warrior.
Without war, there's no Zulu nation.
Nobody is really safe, are they?
Mrs DeWitt has four daughters, Henry, and I fear she feels for them all. >
Your daughters may indeed be in some danger, Mrs DeWitt - but not from the Zulus.
MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!
I think I should inform you that I am obliged to issue a notification declaring a state of war between Her Majesty's Government and the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, on his non-compliance with the ultimatum made on him, urging reparation and redress for violations of British sovereignty.
SCATTERED APPLAUSE
Why?
Why do men think of nothing but killing?
This is a wonderful land we're privileged to share.
Dear God...
..there should be room for all of us!
There goes No 2 Company.
Quartermaster. Quartermaster.
I'll see ya!
No-no!
Do I believe what me eyes see?
The whole bleedin' army moving off to meet the murdering heathen and what goes on in here? A game of brag! BRAG!
Sorry, Quartermaster.
You'll be more sorry when the Zulu ask, "What can you offer me not to slit your gut?"
And you'll say, "The knave of hearts, sir! The knave of hearts!"
THEY CHUCKLE Move!
For the savage, as for the child, chastisement is sometimes a kindness.
Let us hope, General, that this will be the final solution to the Zulu problem.
Come on, boys! Get up!
Quick! Calm down!
And again! Come back here, you thief!
About ready, sir.
My lord, I've prepared a list of ideas for you to see.
Excellent! Give them to Crealock.
My lord, this list was prepared for you. I don't think another can understand its true value.
Thank you, Col Durnford.
Gentlemen, within ten days we shall cross the Buffalo River and British soldiers will then be in Zululand.
Col Durnford will remain down-river and defend the Natal border.
Will you hear Last Post, sir?
I listened to your Stand To this morning. It was perfect.
Couldn't have done it better myself - even when I was bugler to Wellington.
Where did you get that black eye? The cooks saw me dip your shaving tin in their tea water. Made their tea taste of soap, they said.
So you got it in the line of duty.
Point taken.
Will we be fighting the Zulu soon?
Could be.
ATTAS!
When we cross the river into Zululand they might be waiting there for us to show up - them stabbing assegias pointing right at our bellies!
Are you afeard of the Zulu?
One Zulu is only one man, and I'm afeard of no one man!
But the Zulu, they come in thousands, like a black wave of death, in their thousands.
Them assegias, stabbing!
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
I am to take the Sikali with the main column to the river.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
Chelmsford wants a good man on the border - he fears a flanking attack and wants you in reserve.
The wrong side of the river, the wrong place?!
Does he wish me to fight the Zulu or merely observe their habitat?
Sir.
God go with you, Mr Vereker.
SOLDIERS: Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray!
GET UP NOW! GET ON!
Get off his arse, you bloody idiot!
KEEP 'EM IN LINE!
Sarge! Sarge! I'm drowning, Sarge!
What the hell do you mean by having the same name as me?!
Sorry, Sarge!
Do you think Cetshwayo will send a party to greet you?
They're here. We just have to ensure they don't get back to announce us.
You mean you've seen them?
Forward, Sikali!
Come on! Come on!
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Nogg, sir. Actual name is Norris Newman. He's from The Standard.
Our runners bear his dispatches, do they not?Of course!
Come on, lads! It's only a river!
Come on! Make it today!
Come on, you lot! Get these bastards across!
It's only water! You'll only get wet! Come along, you idle scum!
Break that ammunition crate and I'll have your guts for garters!
An historic moment, don't you think?
Norris Newman of The Standard. I saw you lead our cavalry.
Indeed. I was one of the first across.Were they in good heart?
They spurred onto the high ground, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu.
Full of sport, they were, my lord.
Tell what you see, write it well, sir, and make sure you get it right.
If I've got it right, my lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand -
I see it all around me - but "Why?" is the question my readers will ask. "Why?"
Do not confuse yourself.
Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
So attack is your defence.
Well, let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis for destruction.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid engagement.
I have it, my lord, we attack for sport. Or is it reputations?
Enough of your politicking, Noggs.
I know your views on the press but people want to know what the regiments are doing.
Then I trust you will tell them exactly what you've observed.
Tricky business, Mr Bloomfield.
Look at that waste!
Five rounds ruined. Each round has to be accounted for.
It's terrible! Quite dreadful! Something must be done!
If they'd been put back in their boxes, the boxes screwed down - as his lordship ordered - nothing would've happened to them.
I refer to our drowned natives.
Natives is not on my invoices, Mr Harford.
Ammunition is, and has to accounted for, AND brass cartridge cases returned.
Several natives went under. Shouldn't we have a roll call?
Not practical - we haven't had time to make up the roll yet.
Besides, I'm not sure how many we had before the crossing.

I'm ill. Dozens of them followed me.
I must've shot five, six, ten - I lost count.
They just kept coming! Blood-curdling swine!
Why did they attack you? I discovered their army. ..A valley full of them.
- What army? - Beyond them hills and coming this way.
Mr Vereker, would you mind taking a look at this map?
By all means, Colonel.
Your wagons, Colonel. What about my wagons?
On this open slope you must bring them round and form them into a laager - immediately.
I hear you have prisoners, Colonel. Well done! Evening, William!
Thank you, sir!
I think you should hear this. Your brother didn't laager his camp... >
They had 73 in their party - they found 73 skeletons six months later.
Boers require a laager with only a few wagons - we have many.
An unassailable square of British fire power is a defence which can be formed in a moment. You're leaving us?
I'm going to camp among the rocks over there.
My lord, Mr Fannin claims to have seen the Zulu Impi - some few thousand or so - exactly here in this valley.
Unlikely - it would mean taking 24,000 men over mountain tops.
This is not helpful!
Have the prisoners brought to my camp.
SOLDIERS LAUGH All right, Corporal. Anything?
No, sir. Nothing.
Be sensible, man! Tell us!
Good evening! Dirty work, eh?
Very dirty.
PRISONER SPEAKS IN ZULU
What did they say?Claim they're deserters from the Impis in the east.
Followed this one so they could give themselves up, go home.
Do you believe that?
They're well oiled, fed regularly - it's unlikely they're fugitives.
Have them questioned further.
They claim the Impis are east towards the Royal Kraal and yet this fellow says they're further towards the north.
Wherever they are, there are 60,000 or more.
They multiply, Mr Fannin. You speak the Zulu tongue?
Tomorrow I intend to find the Zulu Impi and you will accompany me.
I'm no soldier, your honour, and it's further into Zululand.
You will accompany me or you will me arrested.
This way, Mr Fannin.
Crealock, we have scouts where he claims he saw the Zulus?
Of course, sir.And?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Thank you.
Why don't the Zulus attack?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but that doesn't mean to say they've got no brains.
They'll watch us and wait - find our weaknesses.

Rumours to draw you off to leave Natal open to a counter-thrust?!
Cetshwayo wants a head-on battle, a decisive victory, so his people can get on with what truly matters - the delayed harvest.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war?!
I'm explaining my reasons.
Yes?A large party of Zulus has been sighted towards the King's Kraal.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi.

Crealock, old fella,
I'm doing notes for my dispatch and I need to clear up a few military points.
I don't want to bother his lordship.
I had it drummed into me that a good commander never willingly splits his force - especially in an enemy's country - before knowing their dispositions.
If we were facing a European enemy with guns, your point would hold.
May I remind you, I do not create the strategies you comment on.
I'm only his lordship's secretary.
I wouldn't take overly comfort from that, Crealock, old fella, because if he sinks, then you sink with him.
So, you've been asked to look after me, Lieutenant.
I assure you, sir, I have no desire to create difficulties.
And I say you do not. I'd be obliged for your advice.
What have your scouts seen? So far, only THEIR scouts.
But we've had reports of a small Impi further north, over there.
His lordship believes it's far too difficult an approach to be chosen by the Zulu command.
Yes, well, difficulty never deterred a Zulu commander. How many?
We don't know.
I think it would be wise to picket the hills.
Just in case.

I'm in here.
- What are you doing there, sir?
- I'm checking out the motor.
The motor? What for?
We' re pulling out. I want to see if this boat's worth taking back to the base.
What about Nancy?
Third Army's taking over.
We go into reserve.
When they take Nancy, we go back in the line.
Oh, wow. I don't think you have the welfare of your men at heart.
Now, look, this is a big town, with a lot of passionate broads...
...great restaurants, feather beds in rooms with hot water.
Look, captain, we've been rained on, pushed on, bombed on...
...mortared on by Mulligan all the way from the Normandy Beachhead.
I'm aware of that problem, sergeant.
You've been aware of that problem ever since we got out of the water at Omaha.
Look, why is it that every time we get to a town like Nancy...
...these guys with the clean uniforms and the ties...
...get to ride in the trucks into town and make their pitch?
The general says we pull out, so we pull out.
Look, captain.
You can't let them do this.
I gotta get my men near broads before they start freaking out with each other.
I'm aware that that situation might be developing.
Think I could get this in the hold of a B-17?
We' re point section to the whole damn Army.
- Nancy's our town, captain. Yeah.
Hey, Joe.
There's a company of Germans starting to push.
Relax, I'll be with you in a minute.
Captain.
We got it all figured out.
We even got a guide.
All we have to do is get in there.
Well, there's a couple of German divisions say you can't.
So we need a little help.
The help I need is to get this yacht out of here.
Get back to the barn. I'll do it myself.
Hey, look, captain, you're supposed to be in charge of this outfit.
You' re doing such a good job.
Why should I get in your way?
Oh, God.
Hey, Cowboy.
Got a report that three tanks are coming up the road. I suggest you get activated.
Hold her down there a bit, Willard.
The corporal's trying to tell us something.
Yes, sir. You're telling me what?
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated.
Oh, now, come on, pal.
Ain't you got any Shermans?
We've been polishing these things for two days.
If we take them out there in that rain, they' re gonna rust up on us.
Come on, don't give me a hard time.
Get off your ass, and get out there.
Yes, sir. I didn't mean nothing.
I was just trying to tell you how we're feeling, ain't that right, Willard? Yee-haw!
Hold the ground at all costs.
We' re a reconnaissance company.
It's not our job to hold the ground.
That's an Infantry job.
We' re supposed to go out and find someplace...
...look at it and tell you what the situation is.
I can tell you what the situation is.
It stinks.
It's wet, it's cold, and we're under heavy fire.
Yes. Yes.
Are they sending up anything to support us?
They say they haven't got anything.
We've been ordered to hold.
Hold. With what?
- That's what I told them.
You think we ought to pull out?
You think we ought to pull out?
I don't know. Better wait for Big Joe.
Corporal, those aren't Mulligan's mortars coming anymore.
Those are German 88s.
Much as I like Big Joe, I don't want to spend the rest of the war in a prison camp.
Besides which, I'm first-generation Italian, they'd shoot me as a traitor.
The indications are the Germans are coming and we're not gonna stop them.
With your permission I'm gonna pull the vehicle to the other side of the canal.
Yeah, go on.
Penn, Fisher. Get that damn thing out of here.
Okay, everybody.
We' re pulling out on the double.
Move that stretcher.
Goddamn it, Cowboy.
I don't know what you was talking about.
There ain't three tanks. There's about 20.
- Ain't that right, Willard?
Damn right.
Get that thing to the other side of the canal, you maniac.
Well, that's what we was figuring on doing. Ha-ha-ha.
Kelly, come on, we' re going.
You' re coming, ain't you?
- Go on ahead.
- All right, all right, good luck.
Okay, Penn, let's go.
Colonel.
How many more bars of gold like this do you have in that convoy?
No, no, come on, speak English, colonel, come on.
How many bars like this in your trucks?
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen what?
Thousand.
Fourteen thousand?
Whoo.
Colonel, whereabouts is your convoy right now?
Where are your trucks?
- Clermont.
- In Clermont. Clermont?
Is the gold still in the trucks?
Whereabouts? Whereabouts is the gold?
In the bank. It is a bank.
Colonel. Wake up, wake up.
What about support units?
- Support units?
- Yeah, tanks.
Come on, tanks. Stuff like that.
Tanks.
Three Tiger tanks.
What about infantry?
What about infantry, colonel?
- Did you hear from headquarters?
- We've been ordered to hold.
I'll tell them when to hold.
The Third took over one hour ago.
- We're pulling out of here.
- Great.
- Where's Maitland?
- He's salvaging a yacht.
A yacht?
- A yacht.
- I'll see you about 10 miles down the road.
Wait a minute.
- Is everybody across the bridge?
- Kelly's in the barn with that colonel.
- Did you tell him we're pulling out?
- We told him. He's crazy.
Tell Mulligan to give me three minutes and then lay all the mortar into that barn.
- Understand?
- If you say so.
You wait here.
Mulligan.
Come on, colonel. Come on.
Get up and sit right here.
Kelly. Half the German Army's coming up the road.
In a few minutes, Mulligan's gonna drop
10 tons of mortar on this joint.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Looking after the colonel.
Shoot him and let's get the hell out of here.
- Shoot him, we don't get the gold.
- What gold?
The gold that's in a bank
25 miles east of Nancy, that's what.
Mulligan, I said three minutes.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Kelly? You okay, Kelly?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Come on, you nut.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Fisher. Petuko. Come on, we're moving out. Moving out.
Moving out. Babra. Come on. Move it.
Get in, we' re pulling out.
Kelly, you nut. Come on.
Wait a minute, will you?
Will you wait a minute?
Listen to me a second.
It's not me, I tell you. It's not me.
I can't tell one shell from another. They all look alike. They all look alike, Kelly.
If it was me, if I could tell, would I be here?
Would I be here?
I wouldn't be here, Kelly.
I'd be in the States checking out the duds.
I'd be out with all those broads.
- I'd be working in a factory.
- Relax.
Wait a minute. We've got to have a little understanding around here.
How the hell do we ever get any understanding around here, Kelly?
- Relax.
- You got...
Mulligan, I just want to make a proposition to you.
A proposition?
Well, is it dirty, or just illegal?
Well, I want you to set up a barrage for me.
I want you to lay down a barrage for me, Mulligan.
Grid section 7, right here at these crossroads.
Yeah, well, I gotta have a signed operations order from the C.O.
I need an authorization.
You see, that's just the problem, Mulligan.
We don't have an authorization.
You don't have a...
Well, Kelly, without an authorization,
I can't help you.
I told you I had a proposition, Mulligan.
That's just what I meant.
A proposition.
Yeah. Well, uh...
Why?
Why what?
Why...?
Why, uh... Why not? Heh.
You won't forget me now, will you?
Why, no. I won't forget, Kelly.
You' re a good man, Mulligan.
Yeah, Kelly.
Come on. Come on.
Screw you, Mac.
Come on, move it.
Up yours, baby.
Hey, hey, come on, get it out of there.
Come on.
Hey, come on. Come on, come on, move it.
Come on. All right, come on, you guys.
Clear it out.
Come on, get the horse out of here.
Get on the side, will you? Come on.
Move it out, come on now.
Move it, move it.
Keep it going, boys. Move it through.
All right, keep it going. Let's go.
Come on.
A message from Captain Maitland.
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.
- What's it say?
- He wanted you to read it, Joe.
Take the underwear off your head, huh?
Enough is enough.
We've been ordered to pull back.
We've been ordered to pull back.
Yeah, I heard.
All right.
We've been ordered back to map reference 473, so let's move it.
But my hair is still in curlers.
That's telling them, Willard.
Come on, let's move it out.
Hey, Joe, what about Nancy?
Pack it up, let's go.
Move them out, will you, corporal?
Where have you been?
- Checking a few things out.
- Like what?
I'm going after that gold, Joe.
That's what I thought.
Do you want in?
Do I want in?
Let me tell you something.
Let me make it nice and clear.
I got a job to do and that's to get you guys to Berlin without getting killed.
We've been at the front end of this war all the way.
If you whisper one word about the gold to these guys...
...I'm gonna have you bounced so fast your feet won't touch the ground.
- Now, do you understand that, Kelly?
- Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
You'd better fix up some transfer papers for me, because I'm going.
With you or without you.
Okay.
Give me a hand down there.
What a bunch of shit this is.
Okay, sergeant, everything's secure up here. I'm coming down now.
Hi, captain.
Sergeant, do you think I can get this yacht to Paris by Sunday?
You didn't bring me to this farmhouse to talk about this boat again?
I worked a deal with headquarters. I've got three days' rest for you and the men.
Make sure they have a good time.
I gotta get this yacht to Paris and pick up things for the general.
- And where do we spend this vacation?
- Right here, sergeant.
Are you kidding?
I'm not kidding. With a little imagination, you can fix this place up.
Lay out a baseball diamond.
Run the water into the house.
Special service is coming by with some magazines and paperbacks.
We' re 10 miles from the nearest town.
There's no action.
That's the beautiful thing about this location. It's quiet.
Get yourselves a suntan, a little rest.
In three days we're back in the line.
Hey, captain.
- We're all ready to move out.
- Yeah, I'm coming. Go ahead.
There's no booze, there's no broads, there's no action.
Another thing. Don't fool around with the women, their husbands carry guns.
And don't forget, the penalty for looting is death.
Loot what? There's nothing here to loot.
I'll be back in three days.
"Get yourself a suntan and get some rest. "
He's gotta be out of his mind.
But how does he get away with it?
That's what I'd like to know.
Very simple.
The general's his uncle, that's how.
There's a girl with a heart
As big as...
- Crapgame?
What do you want?
I want to talk to you for a couple minutes.
What about?
I have this deal I've been working on.
I thought you might be interested in helping me out.
What kind of deal?
A private deal.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Harry, go get yourself a haircut.
I hear Maitland's got himself a yacht and taking it to Paris.
That's right.
No money in yachts.
What does he want a yacht for?
Who cares, as long as it keeps him out of our hair for a few days?
Okay, Kelly.
What is it? What is it you want?
Well, I want 15 Thompsons, two. 30 caliber machine guns...
...two bazookas, two field radios...
...and supplies and ammunition to last a platoon of men in the field for three days.
- Oh. That all?
- Nope.
I want the Intelligence report for this whole sector...
...and I need them in the next two hours.
That's nice. What's in it for me?
- A piece of the action.
- What kind of action?
This kind of action.
Hello, Izzy? Yeah, it's me, it's me.
Listen, get me a quotation for gold on the Paris market.
Yeah, now, and hurry it up.
How much more where this came from?
Fourteen thousand bars.
Fourteen thousand bars? Ha, ha.
Fourteen thousand.
Hey, sweetheart, have yourself a bottle of booze, you're beautiful.
Fourteen thousand bars.
Zadda-bow-bow.
That's beautiful. Where is it?
In a bank.
In a bank?
You' re getting pretty ambitious, aren't you?
I mean, to think you can blow a bank and get away with it?
It's behind enemy lines.
Behind enemy lines.
Yeah. That could be the perfect crime.
Hello? Yeah. Yeah, Izzy.
Right. Right, I got you.
Let's see. Seven carry the two, gold, 54.
Hm. $1.6 million.
What else will you need?
You could probably use some armor.
What are you doing up there?
- Hey, Crapgame.
- Who the hell's that?
His name's Oddball.
I got three Shermans outside.
Yeah? What outfit?
Right now I don't have any outfit.
Who's your commanding officer?
He got decapitated by an 88 about six weeks ago.
But don't say you're sorry.
He's been trying to get us killed ever since we landed at Omaha Beach.
It's terrible.
He hasn't reported him dead yet.
You see, I've been collecting his whiskey.
We see our role as essentially defensive in nature.
While our armies are advancing so fast...
...and everyone's knocking themselves out to be heroes...
...we are holding ourselves in reserve...
...in case the Krauts mount a counteroffensive which threatens Paris...
...or maybe even New York.
Then we can move in and stop them.
But for $1.6 million...
...we could become heroes for three days.
A Sherman can give you a very nice edge.
Where are these Shermans?
They' re outside.
Come on, I'll show them to you.
These are my boys.
And these are your tanks, huh?
- Yep.
- Yeah.
I mean, don't let the dirt and the rust hang you up.
We like to give the impression that we're just out of action.
Badly in need of a period of rest and reorganization.
That way nobody bugs us.
Come on, look at the engine.
This engine's been modified by our mechanical genius here, Moriarty.
Right?
Whatever you say, babe.
These tanks are faster than any other tanks in the European theater of operations.
Forwards or backwards.
See, man, we like to feel that we can get out of trouble quicker than we got into it.
Any other secret weapons?
Yeah. I mean, like, you see, all the tanks we come up against...
...are bigger and better than ours.
So that all we can hope to do is, like, scare them away.
This gun is an ordinary 76 millimeter...
...but we added this piece of pipe onto it and the Krauts think, like, uh...
...maybe it's a 90 millimeter.
We got our own ammunition.
It's filled with paint.
When we fire it, it makes pretty pictures.
It scares the hell out of people.
We got a loudspeaker here and when we go into battle, we play music very loud.
It kind of...
...calms us down.
Come on inside for a minute.
If I hear any more threats against Maitland's life.
If I hear any more wild talk about going to headquarters and killing the general.
Or raping nurses at the field hospital.
I'm gonna strangle the guy with my bare hands.
Now, all good things come to those who wait.
We' re gonna have a lot of fun here.
Aren't we, Cowboy?
- You can bet your boots on that, partner.
- Sergeant, partner.
- Right, Sarge.
- All right.
Joe?
- Yeah.
I think I've got the crabs.
We' re gonna boil our laundry.
We' re gonna set up a little shower area...
...so we can wash our little bodies.
Right, Barbara?
- Babra.
Shut up.
Shave.
A little wine, women and song.
A little chiquita for you, Petuko.
It's gonna take time to get organized...
...but I want that farmhouse to look like a nightclub. Little Joe.
I want you to set up a bar.
We ain't got no booze.
"We ain't got no booze. "
Well, we' re going to get some booze.
I'm gonna go down to Battalion...
...see if I can lay my hands on some dirty movies and when I come back...
...I want that farmhouse not only clean, but completely decorated.
Do you understand that?
All right, corporal, fall them out.
Let's get moving.
$16 million.
Kelly, I think I made a slight mistake.
It's not 1.6 million, it's $16 million.
- What a bundle.
Yeah, all right.
We' re gonna need plenty of gasoline on this trip.
You can handle getting it through enemy lines?
- Just name the place, baby.
Okay.
Right here. Grid section B.
Tonight at 2100 hours.
No good, man. The boys have got something special on tonight.
Are you nuts?
What's more important than $16 million?
You come around tonight, Crapgame, and we'll show you.
Okay.
Tomorrow night, then.
Along this road, same hour.
We'll be there.
- If you' re late, we move out without you.
- If we're late, it's because we' re dead.
What about Big Joe?
You handle the supplies,
I'll take care of Big Joe.
I'm going along to protect my investment.
You don't trust me.
A firm financial mind should be behind an enterprise such as this.
There could be a bonus. Besides,
Switzerland's only 100 miles away.
I don't want anybody getting lost.
Now, look, I don't want half the Army in on this deal.
Don't want any friends or friends of friends.
I want to keep it a tight little unit.
Right, Oddball?
Oh, yeah, man. I mean, like...
No sweat, you know?
I'll pick you up in about an hour.
You can hang onto that bar of gold as a deposit.
Who is that guy, Crapgame?
Oh. His name's Kelly.
Used to be a lieutenant.
Pretty good, too, until they gave him orders to attack the wrong hill.
Wiped out half a company of GI's.
Somebody had to get the blame, and he got picked.
Oh, man, I don't like officers.
Neither does he, so relax.
Get me Hogan in Intelligence.
- Hey, Crapgame.
- Yeah?
You mind I take this bar of gold and show it to the boys?
No, not at all. Just remember where you found it. Bring it back here.
You' re a good boy, Crapgame.
Something's wrong with him.
Hello, Hogan? It's Crapgame.
I got you the scotch and the nylons you wanted.
Yeah.
Do I ever fail you?
You better believe it. Never miss.
Listen...
...I, uh, got a little favor to ask of you.
Will you stop crying,
I haven't even asked you yet.
What's the matter with you?
You wait here, padre.
I warned you, if you started anything,
I'd bust you out.
If you transfer me, Joe...
...you have to transfer every man in this outfit.
I told you to lay off these guys.
Take it easy.
Kelly's got the whole thing figured.
Who invited you, Hustler?
- He did.
Hey, Joe.
It's a snap.
16 million just waiting to be picked up.
Did he forget to tell you it's behind enemy lines?
- I told them.
Yeah?
Did you tell them how to get through and cover 30 miles to Clermont?
- I told them.
- Then tell me.
Listen, Kelly's got it figured pretty good.
Listen?
This guy's gonna get you all killed.
We' re getting killed now, pal, for $50 a month.
Damn right.
What good is a bonus gonna do when you're dead?
The risk is the same we've been taking since the beaches.
Only then you didn't have a choice, now you do.
Three days from now we're going back into the line, Joe.
But this time we're doing it for ourselves.
Kelly's even got us armor support.
What armor?
Three Shermans from the 321 st.
Who's in command?
It's a top-line outfit.
I personally recommend these guys.
You butt out. The only time you come out of the ground is when you smell a profit.
I'm coming out now because Kelly has the perfect caper.
For you it's a vacation. Six days out of seven you're behind the lines.
We' re at the broken end of a bottle all the time, so you butt out.
Who's in command?
- Guy named Oddball.
- Oddball? He's a freak.
He's got three Shermans all ready to go.
What guarantee is that?
He's ready to go? He's a nut.
Well, we' re all nuts or we wouldn't be here.
Hey, look.
Let me tell you guys something.
There's certain rules and regulations governing the fighting of a war.
And the first one is that you never stick your neck out for nobody.
Unless you're some kind of a hero type.
And I haven't seen any hero types around here lately.
Talking's not gonna do any good, Joe.
These men are all going.
And who's gonna lead them?
If you don't, I will.
Just listen to Kelly for a minute, Joe.
He's got it all sewed, man.
The route, the timing, the supplies, everything.
Sure.
What do you say, corporal?
Oh, I don't know, Joe.
I figure if I got to go, it might just as well be this trip as the next one.
- Penn?
- I'm for it.
How about it, Cowboy?
I reckon I'm gonna have to go along with it, Joe.
They' re all for it, Joe.
What happens when Maitland finds out we're not here?
He'll figure we've been sent back to the front lines.
Man, he never knows where we are anyway.
Okay, show me what you've got.
The road's 10 yards beyond those trees. Let me look at that map, will you?
What happens if they put up road blocks?
Doesn't matter. All that matters is Mulligan being on time.
Mulligan is on time.
On time and on target.
And he ain't ever been that yet.
Well, there's always a first time.
I figure the town is about a quarter of a mile straight ahead.
- What happens if it isn't there?
- It better be. I went through it last night.
Only got a few minutes left, so let's get moving.
Stick close to me, huh?
I don't want to be waiting on anyone.
We'll be there, Kelly.
All right. Move out, Cowboy.
Ooh. That nut has got to be nuts.
Everything all right, Kelly?
- Everything's all right.
You sure you got the time straight with Mulligan?
Yeah, I got the time straight with Mulligan.
Whether Mulligan can tell time or not is another question.
Fire.
That crazy Mulligan's dropping them all over the place.
You mother.
- Joe. Come on.
- Shut up, you pain in the ass.
This man is the man I have on my mind today.
I'll tell you who he is.
This is my opposite number.
General Bogel, commanding the Second German Armored Division.
When I look at that face,
I can read that character.
This guy's a loser.
Here I am sitting in his headquarters.
I'm drinking his scotch.
Hell, I've even got one of his broads hanging around here somewhere.
The guy's a born loser...
...but you, gentlemen, have not buried him yet.
You call yourselves leaders of men?
They' re putting up strong resistance.
Come on, Roach.
I flew over the battlefield this morning.
I could march a divisional dress parade with band music right through their line.
- What about our flanks, sir?
- Aw, the hell with your flanks.
How many times have I got to tell you?
Forget about your flanks.
There's still a half a Panzer division between here and Nancy.
Without gas. Without gas, gentlemen.
They' re getting gas, sir.
It's coming up at night.
- How?
By truck.
The Air Force has got my orders to blow every bridge in this sector out of existence.
They' re doing it and the Germans are rebuilding the bridges every night.
We' re supposed to blow them up again in the daytime.
- Get me those aerial photographs.
- Right, sir.
General, last night someone gave orders to redirect our mortar fire...
...against some damn crossroads.
Listen, Roach. I don't want any excuses out of you, you hear me?
All I want is to know why this loser of a general is keeping me the hell out of Nancy.
Sir, we haven't got the supplies.
It's just a matter of logistics.
Logistics?
Yes, sir.
We've got logistics coming out of our ears.
What we need is fighting spirit.
The will to win.
Where are those aerial photographs?
I'm sorry. They don't seem to be here.
They don't what?
I can't locate them, sir.
Eh...
...did you lose my aerial photographs?
Well... It looks to me like there ain't no bridges still up.
What's this here?
It's a bridge.
Looks like some kind of railroad bridge, huh?
- Beautiful.
Yeah.
Even if we make that...
...we've still got a river to cross later on.
Right over there.
Let Kelly worry about that. Our problem is getting through German lines.
- Right?
- Right.
How?
It's a railroad bridge, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Well, then, beautiful.
We swing down onto the railroad tracks and right over the mother bridge.
"And over the mother bridge. " Sure.
Suppose the bridge ain't there?
Oh, man.
Don't hit me with them negative waves so early in the morning.
Think that bridge will be there and it will be there.
It's a mother, beautiful bridge and it's gonna be there.
Okay?
Okay, chief.
Okay.
Mount up.
How many, Grace?
Eight.
Penn?
Seven.
How many, Kelly?
Uh, three's fine.
Cowboy?
Oh, about six and I figure about eight loose.
How about you, Willard?
About the same.
How many clips did you use last night?
- About eight.
- Eight.
You' re trigger-happy, Gutkowski.
Here's two more.
Take it easy, okay?
Take it easy.
Want some K-rations, Crapgame?
No, thanks, kid.
I could use some water.
Do you got any water?
Mm, okay.
I'm gonna get some water, okay, kid?
Hey, uh, who are you writing to?
Your mother?
Yeah.
- Do you write often?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Indianapolis.
- Do you miss your mother?
- Yeah.
Good talking to you, kid.
Hey, Kelly.
Kelly?
Big Joe wants to see you over at the command jeep.
Something wrong?
Yeah, just a few little things, Kelly.
According to this map...
...we got a river to cross before we get into this town of yours.
Yeah, well, there's a bridge right here.
Six miles out.
There was a bridge.
The Air Corps knocked every bridge out of that river months ago.
Unh-unh. Reports have the Air Corps knocking them out by day...
...and the Germans rebuilding them by night.
All we have to do is get there tomorrow at dawn and we've got ourselves a bridge.
How about the German Army? Do you think they'd mind us crossing their bridge?
Probably.
You know something, Kelly?
I think you're crazy.
Better yet, I think I'm crazy.
How did I let you talk these guys into this?
Push 30 miles behind enemy lines, take a bridge held by Germans...
...then go into a town that we don't know how many German soldiers are guarding.
I figure there's between 30 and 40 troops in that town.
All right. How did you figure that?
Well, uh, it's of no military importance.
It's not big enough for a garrison.
You still didn't answer the question, Kelly.
How did you figure 30 or 40 men?
Because that's the normal amount of support for three Tiger tanks.
Tigers?
Where the hell did the Tigers come from?
That's why we have Oddball and his Shermans.
- Does he know about the Tigers?
- Not yet, no.
You bet your sweet ass he doesn't.
Or he'd still be on that funny farm of his.
He may be nuts, but he's not crazy enough to put Shermans up against Tigers.
Once these things get rolling...
...they're gonna blow that whole town to pieces, including us, Kelly.
You're too smart to let that happen, Joe.
You'll figure us a way in and out of that town.
I know you've got a good head for tactics.
Yeah? And I intend to keep it right here on my shoulders, Kelly.
With these Tigers, this operation goes above and beyond the call of duty.
That's right, Joe.
16 million above and beyond.
Hey, look, Kelly.
You' re pressing these guys' luck.
They've only got so much of it left.
It's a long, long way to Berlin.
And they're gonna need every inch of that luck before this cockamamie war is over.
Cover!
Come on, on the double.
Let's get the equipment out of the trucks.
On the double, move it out. Here.
Cover. Take cover.
Hey. Hey.
That idiot's one of ours.
Holy crap.
Oh... Our hero.
Man, this is crazy, isn't it, Willard?
Get the number of that plane?
Who you gonna file a complaint with?
- Move it out, move it out.
Yeah, yeah.
- Still think we can make it, wise guy?
- We can still try.
Well, Oddball better show up, Kelly.
That's all I gotta say, he'd better show up.
Move it out.
All right, how is it?
Shot.
- There's a hole right through the cylinder.
- How about the radio equipment?
- The pack radio is okay. The rest has had it.
- Pick it up and take it with you.
- I got your equipment, Joe.
- Bring it.
I told you. We should've never gone in on this deal.
- Well, you never told me.
- Yes, I did.
This why we pay taxes?
To be bombed by our own Air Force?
- Damn right.
- Hey, Kelly. Kelly.
What do we do now?
Pick up our equipment and get out of here before a German patrol comes along.
Oh, that's great.
Let's move all that stuff up to the wall, on the double.
- Everybody all right?
- I think so.
- What happened, Joe?
- What happened?
- Where the hell have you been?
- I had to go.
We all have to go.
Come on. We've got 20 miles to walk and nine hours to walk it in, so move it out.
Big Joe? Do I gotta carry all this equipment...
...this satchel charge and this. 30 caliber machine gun, too?
Give the. 30 caliber to the Hustler.
He wants to be a hero.
Here you are, old buddy. Ha-ha-ha.
Thanks. Get yourself a bucket of grits.
All right, corporal, let's go.
Move them out. Move it out, Penn.
- Yeah, yeah, move them out.
- It's a long way.
All right, thank you. Move it out.
Kelly, get on the point.
How come you got me elected to carry this?
You wanted in on this?
Then learn to carry your own load.
Come on, move it out.
Yeah, up yours.
Take it easy, take it easy.
Take it easy. Okay, hold it. Hold it.
Looks like we've got a military installation up ahead.
So make it the same deal as before.
We'll go into a triangular formation.
I'll go down the slot.
Moe, you go down the right flank.
Whiskey, down the left. Keep it tight.
Don't break it up until I give you the word.
Okay, button up and let's go.
The flowers are blooming
It's a beautiful day
There's a girl with a heart
As big as the sky
She's sunshine
And I know why
Fire.
All for the love of sunshine
Fire.
Hit it.
All right, lay four rounds in there heavy.
Come on, move it. Fire.
Hit it.
Fire.
Bring him around hard.
Hit it.
Fire.
Every time I go to town
A boy started kickin' my dog around
It makes no difference if he is a hound
You better stop kickin' my dog around
Go on, Blue
You good dog, you
All right, Petuko.
Right, Joe.
Move them out, corporal.
Let's go, Babra.
Wake up, Gutkowski. Let's go.
Let's go, Kelly.
All right, Hustler, let's go.
Hey, Kelly.
This was your idea. How come we don't go back to our own lines?
It's further back to ours than it is to where we' re going.
I know what, let's surrender. I'm hungry.
Come on.
All right. I buy it.
I'll make it $50 if you carry the machine gun, huh?
You got it on you?
- Don't you trust me?
- No, I don't.
What do you think I am, a vault?
You think I carry money?
I ask you a favor and you don't want to help me?
All I asked you is to carry the machine gun. I'll give you $100.
Do you have it?
No, I don't have it on me.
Shut up.
Ah, you guys keep quiet.
It's still up.
No, it ain't.
You see what sending out them negative waves did, Moriarty?
That ain't my fault, Oddball.
I've done nothing but have good thoughts about that bridge ever since we left.
What happens now?
It looks like we're gonna find ourselves another bridge.
Where are we gonna come up with another bridge?
There you go, more negative waves.
Have a little faith, baby.
Have a little faith.
Now go on, get down into your hole.
Move out.
42nd Engineers. Bridging Unit.
Corporal Roamer speaking.
Hey, Sarge. It's Oddball.
All right, watch my outfit.
Yeah.
Don't try to be funny, Oddball.
What do you want?
I'm telephoning you from a café about 10 miles south of Mesurier.
I wondered if you could do me a favor.
Mesurier?
I got a map here someplace that says we haven't even captured that place already.
Yeah, so I heard.
Everybody seems very friendly.
Look, baby, I'm kind of hung up.
I need about 60 feet of bridge.
How am I supposed to get 60 feet of bridge 10 miles behind the German lines?
I'm about to put you onto something good and you are giving me your problems.
This sector's so screwed, nobody knows where the German lines or our lines are.
I got through with no problem.
I've got a bank back here with 16 million waiting to be picked up. Are you in?
Listen, they haven't got you back in the nut ward again, have they?
Bellamy. For crying out loud.
That is the lousiest, stinking, most awful, stupid joke.
You' re always pulling that stinking, awful, stupid joke.
You don't want in this thing, don't get in.
I cut you out of everything.
I don't need you, 60 feet of bridge,
I can pick up almost anywhere. Schmuck.
All right, all right, all right.
Look, with three tanks, it's easy.
With a 60-foot bridge it's something else.
I need support units, Oddball.
I need at least 100 guys.
Where do I find 100 men, just like that?
Eighteen miles to...
Jerks.
I couldn't have blown 13, 18, 14, switch the other guys. Aah.
- Joe.
- Shut up.
We've walked into a minefield.
- All right, who bought it?
- It's Grace.
Joe.
There's a road right up here at the edge of the field.
You mark that spot and you head for the road.
Everybody.
Take out your bayonets...
...and move towards Kelly.
Corporal.
Move the men down slowly.
- Mitchell?
Yo!
You pick up Grace's B.A.R. and head this way.
Jonesey, for Christ's sake, stand still.
Corporal?
Go see if Grace is still alive.
Jonesey, will you get the hell down?
- Looks all right up here.
- Right.
All right, you guys, keep it moving. Stay careful.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, I found one.
What kind is it?
The kind that blows up.
How the hell do I know what kind it is?
Mark the spot and keep moving, Hustler.
I'll mark it.
Gutkowski, get down there on that bend and keep an eye out.
Okay, bring the B.A.R.
Penn, get that. 30 caliber set up the other side of the wall.
Right.
I could've been in the States playing Ping-Pong, volleyball...
...plenty of broads.
Who the hell needs all this?
I'm gonna get my knife and get the hell out of here.
Damn lousy equipment.
Now I got to lift up this cannon.
Carry it all the way to the front line someplace.
The damn thing is heavier than Kelsey's burgers.
Sure, I'll get a rupture yet with this damn thing.
Move it now.
On the double, across the road.
Go ahead, Babra, stay on Kelly's path all the way.
On the double.
Come on, Hustler. Move it.
It's all safe for you, now.
"Move it. " I hope you have to take the gas pipe. You creep.
- Stay on Kelly's path the whole way.
- Go to hell.
Let's go, Cowboy. Move it.
Come on, Willard. Let's mount up, boy.
Anything we can do for you, corporal?
No, thanks, Cowboy. We're all right.
- Come on, Willard. Hit it.
I'm ready.
Hey. Hey, Kelly.
How did we get talked into this mess?
It took 10 seconds to talk you into this.
But we were supposed to ride, not walk.
Nobody said anything about mines...
...or schlepping this machine gun all over the country.
Quit your bitching and just remember what's at the end of the line.
GUTKOWSKl:
Kelly. Kelly.
Joe, there's a patrol coming in.
All right, Kelly, spread them out across the road.
Move it. Your crabs will leave you now.
Get that gun set up on the other side of the wall.
Move.
Move it, Petuko, move it.
- Don't forget about the broads.
- You horny bastard.
Sergeant? Get the hell out of there.
Corporal. You'll never make it.
We'll cover you from the road.
- Don't move unless they spot you.
- Right. Go on.
Set up the B.A.R. there, Mitchell.
All right, stay down, load up.
Stay down, load up.
Stay down. Stay down, hold your fire.
Fisher. Grenades.
- Let's get out of here. Let's go back.
Take it easy.
It's too late, now.
We' re better off here, anyway.
Get your head down.
Nice and easy.
Stay down.
All right. Get ready.
Hold it.
Fire.
Let's go.
- Jam.
- Clear it.
Let's move it out.
All right, you heard me.
I said, move it out.
Maybe they' re only wounded.
They' re dead, so forget it. Let's move.
Hey.
Hey.
There's a whole column of Shermans coming over the hill.
Go get your packs.
Pick up your equipment.
Go on down and load up.
Ready.
Fire.
I thought you said three Shermans.
Those nuts have brought half the Army with them.
Okay, keep a move on.
Let's keep on coming.
Come on. Okay, move on out.
Are you ready for this?
Split how many ways, stupid?
Come on, Willard.
What is this, huh? What is this, a ball game? Who are these guys?
They' re my friends, Crapgame.
Friends? Where'd you find them?
Here and there.
- There's a bunch of refugees over there.
- It's a band.
A band? What do we need a band for?
Have a little faith, Crapgame.
They' re beautiful people.
Kid, pull yourself together.
We ain't in the middle of Central Park.
Oddball.
How do you figure on moving through enemy terrain with a column a mile long?
Easy. We can fight. We got an army.
Those freaks? That ain't an army, it's a circus.
Take it easy, Big Joe.
Some of these people have got sensitive feelings.
- Who's the guy in charge?
- I am.
What's the deal with the gold?
Any man who gets to the town and hits the bank, gets an equal share.
But don't try to cross us.
There's gonna be trouble.
- Who's going to make it, boy?
- I am.
- Well, get out and start it.
Take it easy, big mouth.
You get out of here.
Everybody else up on the tanks.
Come on, let's move out.
- Don't double-cross us.
- Any double-crossing will be your fat lip.
- Get moving.
Shut up.
Everybody up on that tank. Let's go.
Kelly, we're not going with those cowboys, are we?
We got $16 million up for grabs and we're not gonna let those clods beat us to it.
- Now, let's get moving.
- Yeah, yeah.
I say, Booker? Booker.
Yes, sir?
The old man was just on the line.
He says I've broken through a long and entire front.
Why wasn't I told?
I don't know, sir.
You' re the communications officer, ain't you?
You' re supposed to be able to communicate.
Who's broken through and how far have they gone?
Well, no one has, sir.
It seems someone's found a hole in the right flank.
They' re trying to push elements of the 321 st and the 35th into it.
"Seems," Booker?
"Elements of the 321 st and 35th"?
Who's pushing them in there, and where the hell are they?
I don't know, sir.
I'm coming down there, Booker.
What's the sense of a communications officer who can't communicate?
Communication? He's more like a damn military censor.
I'm back from Paris.
I got everything you wanted.
All I want is to know whether we have broken through or not.
It's hard to say for certain, sir.
Nothing's been confirmed yet.
We've intercepted some signals...
...that suggest some kind of action at a bridge near Clermont.
- Is that Clermont, Booker?
- Yes, sir.
Then why in the hell didn't you say so?
That's 30 miles beyond their lines.
You got them on the radio?
Yes, sir, but it's hard to pick them up clearly, sir...
...this time in the morning.
Something to do with the ionosphere.
Get the ionosphere the hell off the air and get them on.
Get out of there.
Do something else. Let me in.
- What's the frequency?
- 300 KC, sir.
You' re not gonna find them easy to follow.
- They're using some kind of code.
- What kind of code?
Words like "bank heist, crapgame, big joe, little joe, oddball... "
Hey, can anybody get rid of that machine gun for me?
- There, yes, sir, there. That's it, that's them.
- Where?
There. Right on 300, sir. Right there.
There they are, sir. Those are the signals we've been picking up.
Shut up and let me listen to what they're saying?
Put Kelly on. Over.
Wilco. Over.
Oddball, this is Kelly.
Hey, Kelly, what the hell's going on out there, man?
It's cleared of infantry. What do you hear from those other two tanks? Over.
No chance, man. They've both had it.
One's in the river, the other's burning.
Yeah, I can see them from here. Over.
Where's Big Joe?
Over on the other side. Get off the line, I'll get in touch with him.
Fire. Okay. Over and out.
Kelly to Big Joe. Kelly to Big Joe. Over.
Kelly, it's Crapgame.
What's happening there? Over.
They' re dropping artillery all over the place. That's what's happening.
Where's Big Joe? Over.
He's not here. He's pinned down under the bridge. Over.
- Well, get him for me. Over.
Okay.
Damn. Are we losing them?
We just had them good a minute ago.
I'm doing it, Booker.
Quiet.
What do you want me to do with this?
Get the hell out of here.
We've got the game on.
Kelly, this is Big Joe.
It's pretty clear over here, except for the artillery.
The bridge is too far gone to get vehicles across. You can bring the men over by foot.
Get them moving. Over.
Okay, I'll send them over in twos and threes. Out.
Petuko, Willard, drop your packs and take the equipment across the bridge.
Kelly, what did Big Joe say?
Says he's sending them across.
Tell him to hurry up.
It's getting hotter than hell here.
- What's going on?
- We're crossing over.
- You're not crossing over without us.
- Then grab your trucks and come on up.
- That bridge is too badly damaged to hold.
- You want to come, fix it.
Half my equipment's jammed up in the rear.
Un-jam them. We've lost two tanks already.
I'm not sticking around to lose a third.
Listen, we made a deal.
Not with me, you didn't. Here. You talk to Kelly. Cowboy, stay with the truck.
- Right.
Ready?
This is Bellamy for Kelly. Kelly?
We can't use the bridge.
We can't ford the river. The bed's too soft.
So what do we do?
- Go, team, go. Go.
You've got bridging equipment. Over.
That's a five-hour operation.
Can you hold on for five hours? Over.
No, no. Move. On, on. Move.
Bellamy, we're not gonna hold on for five minutes. You can catch up.
Kelly, we're all in this together.
You can't go it alone. Over.
We' re not gonna wait five hours, either.
If you can't keep up, that's your problem.
Now, we're pulling out and we're pushing forward. Over.
Attack. Attack. Attack.
That's the fighting spirit
I was talking about. Listen to that guy.
- If he was a major, he's a colonel now.
Kelly.
This is a Grave Diggers Registration
Unit. We got a stake in this advance, too.
Did you ever hear enthusiasm like that in all your life?
They've even got the damn Grave Diggers.
What the hell am I doing here?
Bonsor. Get me my uniform.
Get on!
Wonder where Cowboy is?
Give me that gun.
Break up that radio.
Faster, faster.
Hurry up, you guys, we haven't got much time.
Get up.
Crapgame, do you like the Army?
Let's go. Let's get out of here.
All right, let's move them out.
- This is it, Penn. We' re on our way, baby.
Cowboy, come on. Hurry up.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on, Cowboy.
This train's leaving, boy.
Somebody grab that radio.
There you go. Come on, up, up.
Attaboy, come on.
That's it.
Booker, tell General Castle that I want every man in this Army...
...on the road within the hour.
- Yes, sir.
I'm pushing on to the Rhine.
But, sir, Clermont's 30 miles behind enemy lines.
That you, Maitland?
Just back from Paris, sir.
Get my vehicle and driver around here.
Bonsor, you get my box of medals.
I'm gonna decorate every man in this penetration, whoever they are.
They saved the reputation of this entire Army.
You' re supposed to fight this battle.
You don't even know where it is.
I'll tell you where it is. It's 30 miles beyond where you thought it was, Booker.
Come on, now, let's get this Army of mine back in the war.
Will you send that?
Think you ought to wait, let the Army get there?
History waits for no man. I've got an appointment with destiny in Clermont.
Take this weapon, Maitland.
All right, boy. Make this thing fly.
- General, your medals.
- Good luck, sir.
Kelly?
Yeah, Cowboy?
Kelly, we're in the bell tower of the church.
You can see the whole town from up here, almost.
There's not much happening.
I think they're still asleep.
There's three Tigers in the square right down below us.
Do you see anything that looks like it might be a bank?
Yeah, it's got to be this building here to the right of us.
Can you see it from where you are?
They've got two machine guns and guards on the roof.
I don't think I can see much of the center of town from up here.
No, just a lot of rooftops and bombed-out buildings.
Beside the tanks, can you see anything that might house support units?
There's a big brown building right behind the bank with a jeep...
...and two guards and about three trucks.
Hold it.
There's a German officer walking around the bank towards the brown building.
Well, what do you think?
We shouldn't have trouble unless it's with the Tigers.
We can take the machine gunners on the roof from here.
If you can keep them guys busy for a while.
Or maybe we can go down and get a closer look.
No, stay there. Keep an eye out.
See if you can find out where those troops are housed.
Right.
What do you think, Oddball?
It's a wasted trip. Nobody said nothing about locking horns with Tigers.
Look. You just keep those Tigers busy, and we'll take care of the rest.
Ha, ha. The only way I got to keep the Tigers busy is to let them shoot holes in me.
We just want you to keep them interested for a while, that's all.
Man. You guys are crazy.
When we was in the bocage country, we was assaulted by them Tigers.
You know what I mean by "assaulted"?
Well, I mean assaulted.
Why don't you knock it off with them negative waves?
Why don't you dig how beautiful it is out here?
Why don't you say something righteous and hopeful for a change?
Crap.
All right, so it's a beautiful day.
Now, let's get down to cases.
The Tiger is an open-country tank.
We happen to have these in a small town with narrow streets.
- And we do have the element of surprise.
- Yeah.
Look, Kelly, a Tiger has only one weak point. That's its ass.
You gotta hit it point blank and you've gotta hit it from behind.
We do not have the element of surprise.
They'll hear our Detroit motors long before we even get inside that town.
What if I show you a way to get into that town so they don't hear you?
Hey, Oddball?
This is your hour of glory, and you're chickening out.
To a New Yorker like you, a hero is some type of weird sandwich.
Not some nut who takes on three Tigers.
Nobody's asking you to be a hero.
No?
Then you sit up in that turret, baby.
No. Because you're gonna be up there, baby.
And I'll be right outside showing you which way to go.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Crazy. I mean, like, so many positive waves, maybe we can't lose. You're on.
- You guys got anything?
- No, not much.
They just keep coming and going from the brown building behind the bank.
- Cowboy?
Yeah?
In 20 minutes, start ringing that bell.
And keep ringing it as long as you can. Got it?
Right, Kelly.
Five minutes after that bell starts, you get the guards on top of the bank.
Okay, Kelly.
All right, let's move out.
Kelly?
Kelly. Kelly.
- Hold it.
- Hold it.
Cowboy?
Yeah, Kelly, where in the heck are you, man?
We' re just outside of town.
How's it look up there?
Well, it doesn't look too good from here.
They've got all those Tigers fired up down there.
Looks like they're getting ready for some heavy-duty action.
I think we ought to pull out of here, pal.
No, stay right there. What do you think?
That's just routine.
The Tigers turn their engines over for, like, 20 minutes every three, four hours.
Just routine, Cowboy. You stay put.
Routine?
Boy, I sure hope you're right, Kelly.
Our asses are gonna be hanging out up here if you ain't. I'm not kidding.
Nothing's gonna be hanging out.
Now, just relax. Out.
- Sure you're right about those Tigers?
- Sure, I'm right.
If those engines are turning over, we can sneak right up the edge of town.
- Nobody would hear us. Right?
- Right.
Shall I move out?
Good man.
Move out.
Babra.
All right.
Come on.
Hold it.
Stay here, until I signal you.
I'm mounting up, partner.
Now, don't you get lonely up here without me, now, you hear?
All right, let's go.
Switch it on and move it out.
- Hold it.
- Hold it.
Give me that hand radio.
Gutkowski? Gutkow...
The bell's making so damn much noise, he can't hear.
I thought that was what you wanted.
So the Germans can't hear us.
Now, move them out. Slow.
Move out. Slow.
Now.
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
It's a Mark 6. And we got it by the ass.
Fire.
Aah!
Stay down.
All right, move out.
Let's go.
All right, get out of here.
Moving out.
Crapgame?
Yeah.
Over there.
Come on, you idiot.
Hey. Hey, you jerk. Hey.
Hey, will you knock it off with those cockamamie bells?
Kelly told me to ring them.
I know he told you, but they know we're here already. So, knock it off.
God Almighty. Whoo. Phew.
You guys smell like you fell into a dung heap.
It kind of makes you homesick, don't it?
- It does kind of, don't it, old buddy?
- Yeah. Heh.
Pull it.
- Let's go.
- All right, move out.
All right, ready to turn right.
Turn.
Now, hold it.
Fire.
- Wow.
- That's paint.
Load up.
Okay? Fire.
Hey.
We need explosives to get these open.
This place is built like Fort Knox.
Cowboy, check around and see if there's a back door.
Can you see anything?
There's a big lump in the middle of the floor.
There's a Tiger coming down the street.
Cowboy. Cowboy, come here.
Get ahold of his arm.
Take it easy, boy.
Easy, easy does it.
Don't tell me to take it easy.
You take it easy.
Hi, man.
What are you doing?
I'm drinking wine and eating cheese, and catching some rays. You know?
What's happening?
The tank's broken and they're trying to fix it.
Why aren't you helping them?
Oh, man.
I only ride them,
I don't know what makes them work.
Oh, creeps.
Definitely an anti-social type.
Arf, arf, arf, arf!
That's my other dog imitation.
- Where did he get it?
- Well, he got it right here in the leg.
- Anything else?
- What do you mean?
Ain't that enough for you?
- How do you feel, Hustler?
- Great.
Since when did you give a damn how I felt?
Okay, wise guy, forget it.
Hey, Joe.
- Yeah?
- Come here.
What do you want?
How are things going with the bank?
Nothing.
The Sherman's broken down and nobody's gonna move that Tiger out of the square.
- Then make a deal.
- What kind of a deal?
A "deal" deal.
Maybe the guy's a Republican.
Business is business.
Right?
Okay, big mouth.
Come on, Jonesey.
Get it going. Let's go. Get it going.
Come on, let's go. Get in there.
Come on.
Come on, let's go. Roll it in there.
Bellamy, come on.
We' re almost finished.
- What?
- It's ready.
Right. Okay, let's go.
Let's move it out here.
Come on, bring them around.
Ten-hut!
Where are you from, sergeant?
Jersey City.
Stand up straight when the general speaks to you.
Don't you feel bad about it.
You' re a hell of a soldier, and I just want to shake your hand.
All America's real proud of you today.
All right, come on.
I got a medal here in the jeep for you.
A medal?
16 million bucks, shot.
It's shot, Kelly.
Maybe we can use the fuel pump from that Tiger.
No, it won't work on this motor.
- Mechanical genius.
Oh, man.
Oddball, I can't make it work without the parts no matter how positive I think.
This guy in the Tiger, the least we could do is get him on the radio and talk to him.
Are you crazy?
That guy's gotta be a full fanatic freak.
Otherwise he would've split
20 minutes ago.
Hey, all this guy is doing is guarding the bank like he was told.
Yeah, maybe.
But I wonder if he knows what's in it.
- Cigarette?
No smoke.
The fuel system is rotten.
We have gasoline all over the place.
It's all right.
Hey, look, uh, Max...
...you and us, we' re just soldiers, right?
We don't even know what this war's all about.
All we do is we fight and we die.
And for what?
We don't get anything out of it.
In about a half an hour, the American
Army's gonna be coming down that road.
Why don't you do yourself a big fat favor and get the hell out of here?
I have orders.
This bank isn't to fall into the hands of the American Army.
This bank's not gonna fall in the hands of the American Army.
It's gonna fall in our hands.
You see, we're just a private enterprise operation.
You the American Army.
No, baby, we ain't.
You know what's inside that bank, man?
There's $16 million worth of gold in that bank, sweetheart.
That's about 65 million marks.
And, sergeant...
...all you have to do to have an equal share of this money...
...is crank this turret around and blow a hole in that door.
I told you.
No more payments.
You got it. Hit it.
Come on, Little Joe.
What are you going to do with yours?
Get me a new Hudson with an electric shift.
I'm going to get me a ranch in Texas, with about 10, 20, 35 women...
...and let it go. Ha-ha-ha.
- I told you it'd work, I told you.
- No, you never told me.
- You never told me.
- Come on, Babra, keep it moving.
One Cadillac coming up, Willard.
- No, I'm getting a pickup truck.
Okay, Crapgame, we got our cut,
I'm moving out.
Right. Take it easy, kid.
See you, Big Joe.
Heh. Okay. Stay lucky, you nut.
Mmm. See you, babe.
These are getting heavy.
- Buy you a lot of broads.
- I'll drink to that.
Come on, let's go. Move it out.
Come on, Babra, keep it moving.
We have small car full.
We go now.
Yeah. You take care of yourself now, huh?
Thank you.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.
Cowboy, come on.
Move it.
I got it, let's go.
Hold.
Eh? See? What did I tell you, huh?
Now look, Oddball. The trade for the uniforms I can understand.
But to buy this tank, you gotta be crazy.
It's a mother, beautiful tank.
It's a piece of junk.
The fuel system leaks all over the place.
It's a piece of junk.
Always with the negative waves,
Moriarty.
Always with the negative waves.
Crap.
- Joe. Joe.
Yeah.
The general's on the edge of town, right this minute.
Okay, Gutkowski.
You go help with the gold.
- Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, Fisher?
- Yeah, what do you want?
Listen, after splitting with Oddball and the Germans we should have 125 boxes.
At $8400 a box.
That's how much?
That's 10,500,000.
Correct. Split 12 ways?
875,000 each.
Very good, Fisher. You win a cookie.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
I just wanted you to know that we appreciate it very much. All of us.
And we...
The general's coming. Eisenhower.
Eisenhower. That's right. Yeah.
You don't understand.
De Gaulle. De Gaulle.
De Gaulle.
The General de Gaulle is coming.
Right now. De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle. De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle.
De Gaulle.
All right, keep it moving.
Kelly, come on, Kelly, move it.
The cavalry's coming down the road.
Give us a hand.
- What are they saying, Maitland?
- They seem to think you' re de Gaulle.
De Gaulle? He ain't even in this war.
Hey!
Victory.
Ha-ha-ha. Cowboy, we did it.
- We got it. We did it.
We did it.

Radar!
Yes, sir.
Get a hold of Major Burns
- Guess I better call Major Burns and tell him to put another... day shift on the night shift. Hold a couple surgeons over from the day shift onto night shift.
I'll call General Hammond— Get General Hammond down there in Seoul. Tell him we gotta have two—
I hope he sends us those two new surgeons. We're sure gonna need 'em.
What was that, sir? I gave everything to Radar.
What?
What the hell do you think you're doing? Huh? Well, uh—
Just because you're a captain, don't think you run the joint. Come on, I wasn't—
I run it. Yeah, all right.
I'm just supposed to—
I know what you're supposed to do.
Your driver will be with you shortly. He's having his coffee now.
Racist.
Attention.
The following men report to the departure area:
Carey, Michael S.
Phelps, Robert A.
Colbert-
Cleaver, Herschell B.
Roosevelt, Charles B.
Bye, ladies. Thank you.
Ralph, Roosevelt D.
Govowska, Theodore G.
Uh, 4077th MASH?
This is the jeep, yeah.
All right.
Okay, let's go, boy.
Get my other bag.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Schermerhorn! Get that son of a bitch that just stole my jeep!
Hey, watch where the hell you're going, will ya?
There you are, sir.
The officers' mess.
Perhaps you would like to take a small repast?
I don't think I could eat after that ride you gave me. You want any of this?
No, thank you, sir.
But I could do with my lunch.
Well, why don't you come on in with me and get a sandwich?
I'll follow you anywhere, sir.
Oh, how about that piece of scenery, Yankee, huh? Yes, sir.
Who are those men?
Friends of yours, Murrhardt?
No, sir. First time
I've ever seen them.
Well, maybe those are the replacements, sir.
Don't be silly. We're expecting some really sharp surgeons.
Well, I guess they just got separated from their units and looking for something to eat.
They've got a hell of a nerve coming in here, eating our food.
Can I ask you to move over just a little bit? Thank you. Ooh.
Be careful.
Yeah.
But you know she's got to use—
I think I'm in love.
That pHisoHex soap on her face. She really has a very bad complexion.
Uh— Uh, well, you see, the truth is, Lieutenant,
I don't have anything to do tonight.
I just got into town, and, uh, well,
I thought maybe you could show me around.
Captain, I think if you’ll notice the lieutenant's beautiful hand, she is definitely married.
Well, I'm the commanding officer, and
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
Boy, Bandini, they're eating here... Attention.
Because they want to.
Attention, Captain Murrhardt-
You men just passing through? I was just enjoying that lovely dish there.
Uh, Captain, you are speaking about a lieutenant in the United States Army.
And I'm Colonel Blake.
Oh, Colonel.
I'm, uh, Duke Forrest, your new cutter. That's my driver.
Captain Hawkeye Pierce.
Are you leaving?
Yes, I am.
Good afternoon, Lieutenant Dish.
Good afternoon, Captain Hawkeye.
Captain Hawkeye Pierce.
I had a TWX about you.
It seems that you stole a jeep up at headquarters. No, no, no, sir.
No, I didn't steal a jeep. No, it's right outside. Right there.
Oh, so it is. Captain Forrest, don't you know that when you report to your new duty station, you go to your commanding officer with a copy of your orders?
Uh, Captain, uh, Pierce, is it?
Captain Pierce and me have been boozing all day and worked up an appetite—
Good, good. You've been working close to the front.
Now we have our slack periods here, but when the action starts, you'll get more work in 12 hours than a civilian surgeon— How many nurses do we have?
Seventeen. How many nurses will be on my-
Four. I'd like to select this young girl here.
Yes, I think it could be arranged. And the young girl over here. The blonde—
Oh, Father Mulcahy.
I'd like you to meet Captain Pierce, our new surgeon. This is a Catholic chaplain.
And this is Captain Forrest.
Dago Red.
Dago Red? Captain Waldowski, our dental officer.
Better known as
Painless Pole.
This is Captain Black, our anesthesiologist. I'm the dentist here.
John Black. I'll be passing gas for you. Duke? Welcome.
If you boys have any problems, my tent is right—
Radar! Oh, Corporal O'Reilly. Gentlemen,
I'm Corporal O'Reilly. They call me Radar.
You'll be staying in Major Burns's tent.
I'll take your things over there now.
Get everything out of the jeep. Don't worry about the jeep. I'll change the numbers.
Oh, and change the numbers on that jeep.
Corporal O'Reilly? You're not billeting these enlisted men... in the officers' area now, are you?
Excuse me.
I'm working for my blind brother who can't afford the trip to Korea.
Don't you trust that man.
He's a mad dog.
Unhand me, sir.
Uh, hey, Duke Forrest.
Now that one's mine.
Hi, fellas.
Who? That one?
Who told you that?
How do you know that? "Yea, though I walk through the valley...
"of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for 'thoo' are with me. "
Thou. Thou art.
Jesus Christ.
What's all that about?
That's Major Burns, sir.
Excuse me.
New personnel, Major.
Good.
Hi. Hawkeye Pierce.
How do you do?
Uh, Duke Forrest.
Frank Burns.
How are you?
Go ahead, Ho-Jon.
"My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness... and mercy shall follow"-
Uh, what's this here?
This is Ho-Jon. He's one of our mess hall boys. I'm teaching him how to read.
Oh, is that right? Uh—
Reading the Bible, huh?
Now, that's nice.
Listen. I tell you what. I got a book here. It's got a lot of pictures in it, and I think it's easier to learn how to read when you look at pictures.
- A little adventure— pictures.
- May I leave now, Major?
- Sure, Ho-Jon.
- You have fun, you hear?
Yeah, get some suction.
Here it is. Here it is.
Suture, Mary.
What kind of sutures are these?
I can't see what the hell I'm doing.
Scorch, I need some more sponge clamps.
Just a minute, Les.
Okay.
Give me some big hunks of sponge or something, for crying out loud.
Get that thing out of there.
You'll have to use these for now.
Oh, that's bleeding.
That's gotta come out of there.
I can't stop that bleeding down there. Come on.
What's so funny?
Nothing, sir. Not a thing. Is that true what I hear about you?
Duke, back to the kidney. Come on.
Oh, yeah.
He's cute. Get it out of there, man.
Give me a clamp. Give me a clamp.
Here we go.
Captain Pierce, did you call me?
No, I didn't, and my name's
Hawkeye. Give me the saw.
I can't really see. It's like the Mississippi River down there.
Give me another one. Doesn't feel like it's in one piece. I'll tell you that.
I think it's gotta come out of there.
Give me a knife. And give me some more of that gauze. That thread.
Off the stick, or otherwise?
A big, honey.
It's— You know-
Ready?
I'm ready.
Nurse, you got a clamp, please?
Yes, sir.
Scratch my nose.
Just on— There.
A little harder, please.
Attention. Attention.
All... noncommissioned off-
Attention. Attention.
All noncommissioned officers... will report for short arm inspection at 0400.
That is all.
What's that?
That's a "martin-eye," Frank.
Finest kind. We're training
Ho-Jon to be a bartender.
Would you care to imbibe, sir?
I don't drink.
Jesus Christ,
I think he means it.
I think we've been had, Hawkeye.
I think you're right, babe.
I don't think it's right to involve a boy who's not 17 years old yet.
You go to sleep now?
Yeah.
I go wash clothes.
Okay.
Hey, you make a mean martini there, Ho-Jon.
You keep it up, you hear?
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. "
You ever catch this syndrome before, babe?
No. Not with anyone beyond the age of eight years old, I haven't.
"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. "
- Amen.
- Amen.
And, dear God, protect our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones.
And, dear God, protect our supreme commander on the field... and our commander in chief in Washington, D.C.
Frank, were you on this religious kick at home, or did you crack up over here?
Uh, Frank, how long does this show go on?
It gets longer all the time. Now I have your soul to pray for and Captain Pierce's.
# Onward Christian soldiers #
# Marching as to war #
# With the cross of Jesus #
# Going on before #
# Christ, our royal master #
# Leads against the foe #
# Forward into battle #
# See his banners go #
# Onward Christian soldiers #
# Marching as to war #
# With the cross of Jesus ##
Yeah?
What's the lineup?
Four waiting for surgery, two waiting for the I. V... and two waiting for the antibiotics to take over.
Well, we can probably handle that if there's no more choppers. Pickup.
Scissors.
Hi, Wade. Oh, wait a second. You can't go in the colonel's office.
That's who we're looking for, babe.
Henry, you've gotta do something.
We have stuck it out for a whole week now. Pretty girl, eh?
Yeah, she kinda grows on you. Uh, what is it, men?
That sky pilot. You have got to get him out of our tent.
Your tent?
Yeah. Get that nurse in there.
She doesn't look like the kind keep you awake all night praying.
I've been in the army a long time. I know what you guys are trying to pull, but you're not going to push me around.
Oh, now, Henry. Henry, not for the world would I push you around.
But look. There is one more thing, now that you're talking about it.
We need a chest cutter. Yeah, we gotta get an A1 chest cutter in here quick, Henry, or we're gonna be in a hell of a lot of trouble.
Forget it. No MASH unit has a chest surgeon. We're not about to get one.
Um, excuse me, sir. They're behind in the
O.R., and the pre-op ward is all jammed up.
The helicopters and the, uh, ambulances are coming in full.
You guys are gonna have to go to work early today.
What, add overtime to a 12-hour day?
What the hell is that?
The union will raise all kinds of Cain with you.
Boy, Henry, you work those kind of hours, you sure need your rest.
You can't get 'em with a sky pilot jabbering to heaven—
Major Burns will be out of your tent in 24 hours.
Tell them Captain Pierce and
Captain Forrest are on their way.
Henry, there's just one more thing.
I told you Major Burns will be out of your tent in 24 hours.
The chest cutter.
No.
I'll try, damn it. You can't ask any more than that.
My abdominal operation was doing fine.
It's the head wound that did him in.
Dish, get over here and hold this retractor. Okay.
Now. No
- Dish, let me have a long needle holder.
Uh, go ahead.
Dago.
Pull it back, Duke.
Oh, hell. I can't—
Get hold of the other one. Dago.
Dago, I want you over here to hold this retractor. Now. Wha— Uh—
Please. Come on, now. Yes. I'm sorry, I—
Hi, Dago.
Hey, hold on. Don't wiggle it.
My hands—
Just hold on.
Clamp.
I'm sorry, Dago, but this man is still alive, and that other man is dead, and that's a fact.
Can you hold it with two fingers, Dago?
Hell. Where the hell—
Do you see it?
Sergeant, you know where Hawkeye is? You mean Captain Pierce?
No, I'd have to look at the duty roster. They're in there.
Oh, baby. Hawkeye, you've gotta remember. I'm married.
I'm married. I'm happy.
I love my wife.
If she was here, I would be with her. I'm very happily married.
There is no question of loving anybody. It is a question only of-
I made a vow to myself that while I was gone, I was gonna be—
I was gonna be faithful to my husband. Sure.
Those are the vows you make when you're with somebody.
Hawkeye?
Ho-Jon? Duke say you better haul ass home quick.
We got new chest cutter in our tent. Okay.
This is Radio Tokyo bringing you musical interlude... for your enjoyment.
I'll see you later?
# Shoeshine boy #
That's him.
Hiya.
I'm Hawkeye Pierce.
Yeah. See? That's all I can get out of him is he's from "Bahston," and he's been in the army two months.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, that's all.
Well, listen, uh, where were you when you were drafted?
I was just curious.
Back home. I told you before.
No. I mean, what were you doing?
Were you, like, a resident, or on staff someplace?
Where?
Hospital.
- Which hospital?
- Back home.
Is there some reason I shouldn't know which hospital?
I don't know. I will ask.
Is there some reason my friend should not know the name of the hospital?
There doesn't appear to be any reason. I've seen you somewhere before.
I don't know your name, stranger, but your face is familiar.
Have you always had that mustache?
Are you a beer drinker, sir, or would you like to share a martini with me?
A martini. L— That would be—
I'd love a martini.
Ho-Jon, give the gentleman a martini.
I think you will find these accommodating. They're quite dry.
Don't you use olives?
Olives? Where the hell you think you are, man?
We do have to make certain concessions to the war.
We're three miles from the front line, and—
Yes, but a man can't really savor his martini without an olive, you know.
Otherwise, you see, it just... doesn't quite... make it.
Attention.
The Evangelical United Brethren
Church has donated 34 "hymals"... to the 4077th MASH unit.
These "hymals" are located in the
"clamp"— in the camp library... and may be checked out by those with cards.
That is all.
Listen. Am I gonna get paid for giving you guys lessons?
Rib-cutter.
Small bones, huh?
Deaver retractor also, please.
All right. Let's get her, baby.
Okay. Can I tie this for you?
Don't hog the whole operation.
Knocko, gauze rolls.
You need some suction?
Yeah, that's fine.
Now, pickups to me, please.
How's he doing?
Doing well.
Yeah. Suture. Yeah, looks like that's it. Looks like that's it.
- What the hell did you do with our thread? It ran out.
- Wanna tie that off?
More thread, please, and larger needles. Will you let me?
Let me have another suture.
All you surgeons are all alike.
I tell you that.
If this guy knew the clowns who were operating on him, I think he'd faint. I think he has.
Come on, Nurse. I need a suture, please. Coming.
Keep ahead of him, babe, will you? We need a couple more stitches in there.
That's fine. Yeah. Thank you.
Just turn it around.
It's a good thing you have a nice body,
Nurse, otherwise we'd get rid of you quick.
- Don't stick me.
Keep it clean.
Here, I can tie that for you.
Okay. Let's have the big stitches for closing up the chest. Fine.
Larger needles, Knocko.
Now the sutures.
Start down here? Looks like it needs another one, huh?
Does anybody know if this is an officer or an enlisted man?
He's an enlisted man.
Make the stitches big.
Attention. Captain Bandi—
Captain Bandini—
Attention. Attention. Captain Bandini is now performing a femoral pop—
A femoral
P- O-P-L-I-T-E-R-A-L... artery explor- exploration and possible graft.
The following memo has just come through:
Please remove all pictures, postcards, nude calendars, et cetera, from the walls, so that our rooms may look clean and orderly.
That is all.
Big "U"!
Duke, did I ever tell you how Androscoggin
College beat Dartmouth in a raging blizzard,
They had this great passer, see?
And we held them nothing-nothing... till the last 20 seconds, and then, snow and all, he let one go.
Yeah, you told me.
And it went sailing— Boom!
Lucky your mouth wasn't open. It would have got stuck in your throat. Oh, baby!
Oh, it is Trapper John Mclntyre!
I thought you'd never remember.
Man! Man! It's Trapper John.
John Mclntyre. Trapper John. Only man ever found fulfillment in a Boston-Maine railway.
In the— In the ladies' can. Conductor opened the door, the girl looked out and yelled,
"Oh, you caught me! Oh, my God!
He trapped me!" Is that right?
Honest to God. How are you? I'm great. Wh-What's going on over there?
Oh, well, well, well. It must be
Painless Polish Day in the shower tent.
Yes, sir. Painless Polish
Day in the shower tent?
Walt Waldowski, the dentist.
You know—
What, are those guys waiting to scrub his back, or something?
No, he's what you might call the best-equipped dentist in the army.
You might call it that.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
I saw
- Once in med school— in premed— I did an autopsy on a guy.
He had been drowned and all swollen up— Are you an authority?
I heard that one too. You told that one. The most extraordinary thing. And a friend of mine—
Boy, man, I'd surely love to see that angry.
Nurse!
Boone, get me a c. c. Of adrenaline and a cardiac needle.
I'm sorry-
Just get it!
- Pinch a bit.
Looks like the lip looks pretty good.
That's it. Good.
And you can cut me about a four-inch piece of wire... and about an inch and a half of tape.
Hi, soldier.
Who is it?
Oh, it's Trapper. Trapper. Don't worry. Let's get some of this stuff off.
You idiot.
I said a cardiac needle.
- You want me to get a nurse?
- It's too late, Boone. You killed him.
At ease. This is Major
O'Houlihan, our new chief nurse.
This is where we do the dirty work.
Uh, Captain Murrhardt.
Sponge.
Hi.
Hello. Hi, Captain.
Dennis. Don't you remember? I, uh, helped carry your luggage from the airfield.
Oh, yes. Hello, Dennis. Yeah. Hi.
This is Captain Black.
Hello, Captain Black.
Hi, I'm Ugly John, your gas passer. Oh. Ugly John.
Oh, it's only you, Judson. Uh,
Captain Sacks. Hello, Captain Sacks.
How's the operation going?
Are you kidding?
Scissor.
Oh, and this is Captain
Knocko McCarthy. Hello, Major.
Hello, Captain.
Right.
Now I'll show you the rest of the operation, if you’ll excuse the pun.
This is the, uh, pre-op ward.
Oh, I'll take these things.
This is the post-op ward.
Uh, if you don't mind.
Oh. Vollmer, take care of these, will you, please?
Finished work for the day? Yes, why?
Good. Good. I just, uh, wanted to make sure you had time to sleep this off.
Son of a bitch!
Trapper! Captain Mclntyre!
What the hell? That's a captain?
What's going on?
Who started this?
I hit him. I hit him. He's an ignoramus, that knucklehead.
He wouldn't have touched me if I had my guard up.
Let us settle this, Colonel, between ourselves. Alone.
What do you think I'm running, an English boarding school?
Mclntyre, you're under arrest. Confine yourself to quarters, pending an investigation.
Oh, Henry, are you kidding?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident.
We try to remember we're a military organization.
I should certainly hope so.
Vollmer, that man is under arrest.
Confine him to his quarters.
Captain Mclntyre, you are officially—
Oh, come on.
Cut it out, Vollmer.
Attention camp compound.
Urine specimens... will be required from all pers-
Uh—
Uh, disregard last transmission.
I'm sorry, Colonel.
Hi, Henry.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Henry, you want some coffee? Yes, please.
Ho-Jon, get him some coffee.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I never expected the son of a bitch to get up.
That's no kind of an answer. Come on, Henry. You know why he hit him.
I can't have my junior officers striking each other. Thank you.
Oh, now damn it, Henry.
Frank Burns is a menace!
Every time a patient croaks on him, he says it's God's will or somebody else's fault.
Yeah, and this time he blamed it on some kid who was stupid enough to believe him.
Hell with that. I'm tired of you guys trying to run this outfit.
This time there's going to be disciplinary action.
What are you going to do,
Henry?
Well, I had planned to name
Trapper chief surgeon... to consult on your shift and Frank's.
- That's damn good thinking.
- Yeah, but now I can't do it for at least a week.
If I announced it now after what our new chief nurse saw this afternoon, you'd hear her yelling from Washington to Seoul.
Don't you have any sugar in this place?
Good morning.
Today's musical selections... will be rendered by
Achi Takamura Seamuchiwa Bobcats!
Colonel Blake, General Hammond did not answer the phone, sir.
They said he was at a football game.
Those generals have all the fun.
Yes, sir.
Attention. Attention.
May I have the camp's attention?
This week's movie will be
When Willie Comes Marching Home.
Uh, the biggest parade of laughs of World War II.
All the loves, laughs and escapades of the Willies who came marching home.
This film stars Dan Dailey,
Corinne Calvet and Colleen Townsend.
Captain Pierce, may I join you?
You've already joined me, gorgeous.
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Where do you come from?
Well, I like to think of the army as my home.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Ho-Jon, you bring me some ketchup, will ya?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. Yeah, I know. I saw you.
Naturally, your own opinion is more informed than mine.
And you would like to know what I think of the nurses on my team.
Well, I'll tell you. I think they're fine. I think they're just great.
I'm totally satisfied with them.
Keep the blood—
Oh, no, no.
That's the second time this week.
Of course.
What'd you expect?
Here come the girls.
Welcome, gentlemen.
# When the lights go on again #
# All over the world #
Got enough room?
Sponge stick.
Get rid of the line for me.
# All over the world ##
Is he all right, Hawkeye?
Is he all right, Dago?
Yes, you mean is he gonna live? He'll live.
Let me have another sponge stick. Is somebody going to be around tomorrow morning... when he wakes up, to tell him that he hasn't got anything between his legs anymore?
Let me have the long fingers.
Syngman Rhee paid the light bill.
Well, Major Burns is far from satisfied. That doesn't surprise me.
Frank Burns does not know his way around an operating theater.
He does not know his way around a body.
And if you will have observed anything, you will have observed that
Major Frank Burns is an idiot.
He has flipped his wig, that he's out of his head, that he's a lousy surgeon.
Oh, on the contrary, I have observed that Major Burns... is not only a good technical surgeon, he is a good military surgeon.
Finished?
I've also noticed that nurses as well as enlisted men address you as "Hawkeye. "
Yeah, because that's my name,
Hawkeye Pierce.
Well, that kind of informality is inconsistent with maximum efficiency... in a military organization.
Oh, come off it, Major.
You put me right off my fresh fried lobster, do you realize that?
I'm going to go back to my bed, I'm gonna put away the best part of a bottle of scotch, and under normal circumstances— you being normally what I would call a very attractive woman—
I would have invited you back to share my little bed with me, and you might possibly have come.
But you really put me off.
I mean, you're what we call a regular army clown.
I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached... a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
He was drafted.
Radar!
Your briefcase, sir.
Oh, I'm going to spend the day with General
Hammond— Good luck with General Hammond.
You'll be back tomorrow morning, and Major Burns will be in full charge.
Major Burns will be in charge. Good luck.
See you in the morning.
Sir, are there any last-minute instructions you want to give to the men?
Uh, Radar has all the necessary information. Yeah, but... who's gonna be on C.Q. Tonight?
W- Wait a minute.
What about the, uh—
Oh, Captain.
Yes, sir?
I left some shirts on my bunk.
The buttons are missing.
Will you ask Satsumi to sew them up, please?
I'd be glad to do them for you. You don't have to.
It's nothing. Really.
Great jacket. Is it new?
Oh, yeah. My—
Uh, it was sent to me.
You don't have to do that. Take care.
# Hail to the chief#
# He's the best of all the surgeons #
# He needs a queen to satisfy his urges #
# Hail to the chief He's the best of all the trappers #
# He needs a queen to sit upon his lappers #
# Hail to the chief He's the best of all the cutters #
Blake has gone out of his mind.
Is that gonna go on all night?
# He took his orders and shoved them up his rectum ##
No, no. No food. No food.
Sex. I want sex.
Bring me some sex.
Scorch, come forth.
No, no. That one.
Bring me that one there.
He's chosen you. Congratulations.
That one. The sultry bitch with the fire in her eyes. Take her clothes off.
I want that one, yes.
Yes. Take her clothes off and bring her to me now.
Doctor! Doctor!
You forgot your shingle, Doctor.
Ew!
This... letter... has... been... written... in the interest...
Of-
Army morale.
Good. Army... morale.
You wanna sing one? Wait a second. Wait a second. Radar's gonna sing us a verse.
"This letter has been written in the interest of army morale.
"As officers, we feel it is our duty to bring this unwholesome situation to your attention.
"We are writing this letter jointly to assure you that no one's personal feeling...
"has any way influenced this report.
Respectfully, Margaret J.
Houlihan"— That's perfect.
"Major Burns. "
That's perfect.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We make a good team, don't we?
We think the same way.
Of course we do.
It's almost suppertime.
You're not hungry, are you?
Ravenous.
How about you?
For you, Margaret.
Now, the sooner this reaches him, the sooner we can turn this into a tight military outfit.
Attention. Attention, camp compound.
Corporal Judson has informed the colonel's office... that three cases of amphetamine sulfate are unaccounted for again.
This is the third occurrence of this type in the last month.
It must stop by order of Colonel
Blake's office, 4077th MASH unit.
I only wish I could deliver that letter personally.
Good night, Frank.
Good night, Margaret.
I'll stop by later on to see if you’re all right.
Why, that won't be necessary. Oh, I don't mind.
I'll leave the door unlocked.
Attention. Captain Mclntyre will give a lecture on... blood and fluid replacement in the mess hall at 0800.
Uh, uh, correction.
At 021 —
At 9:00 this evening.
Radar?
Take your hat off, Radar.
You're before the king.
Uh, queen—
Don't get nervous, Radar.
"Long, long, long"—
# Long live the chief#
# The colonel #
# The colonel
Long live the chief#
# The colonel did elect him #
# But he took all his orders and shoved it up his nose ##
You all right?
Fine.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
It's the disrespect for you, Frank. That—
That's what
I can't forgive.
I'm used to it.
- Licorice?
- Oh, no. Thank you.
What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.
They oughta be grateful to have you.
I certainly am.
I'm grateful to have you, Frank.
We've grown very close in a short time.
It isn't just chance.
I'm sure of that.
God meant us to find each other.
His will be done.
Oh, Frank! Oh, Frank!
Let me get it.
I'll help you.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Get it.
Wait. Get my robe.
Oh.
Get my zipper. My zipper.
All right.
Oh, God.
Oh. Careful.
Oh, Frank. Oh.
Shh!
Get the searchlight on.
Look.
Hey. Put the light out.
Hi. What's going on?
May I join you?
Uh, a little radio show.
Oh, Frank! Oh, yes!
My zipper. Wait.
Oh, Frank!
Careful. Careful.
Oh, Frank!
Is this the Bickersons?
I love them. Who?
The battling Bickersons.
I love-
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!
Oh, Frank! Oh! Yeah.
Hard! Ooh.
Harder. Ow. Oh, Frank.
There it goes.
Oh, yeah.
Oh! No, I, uh— I forgot— I—
No.
You're shining that thing in my eyes. Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, he is such a sweet man.
Oh, Frank.
Oh, Frank, my lips are hot.
Oh! Kiss my hot lips!
Oh, yes, they are hot.
Lips. Hot- Hot lips?
We have got to share this with the rest of the camp.
Switch it over.
Okay.
Oh, Frank, yes!
Darling!
Clamp.
Oh.
Oh, Frank! Oh, Frank!
Strangle me.
Hard! Frank! Oh!
What the hell is that?
Oh, yes. Oh!
Looks like Dr. Frank Burns is doing a bit of dilatation and curettage.
Th-That's, uh—
That's, uh—
Well, it sounds like the, uh, major
- the new major is having a dream. She's plugged in.
Oh, Major!
Frank!
Frank!
Frank! Wait a second!
What is it?
Turn the light off!
No, that's on!
Turn it off!
Get your clothes on.
Get your pants on.
Don't shout at me!
Don't shove!
Frank, wait.
# My #
# Blue heaven ##
Uh, it's too bad
Henry wasn't here.
He would have thought it was a real radio program.
I thought it was a radio program.
I think we should send a letter of commendation to the Armed Forces Radio Network.
Ah, wonderful. Yes.
It was the most uplifting program I have ever heard.
It was climactic.
Morning, ladies.
Well, hi, "Hot Lips. "
Oh, my goodness! Over my— I'm so sorry to touch you, but I—
Well, what's the matter with her today?
I don't know. I think it's one of those ladies' things.
It's not like her to act like this.
No, she usually doesn't.
She's a bitch.
Look at my new flannel—
I think she's gonna have a nervous breakdown. She can't even get out the door.
Morning, Frank.
Heard from your wife?
Morning, Colonel. You forgot your briefcase. Uh, yes, I left it in the jeep.
You left it there. Oh, I forgot it. Morning, Captain.
Morning, sir. I hope you didn't have to— Here, take care of this.
I hope you didn't have to bother with those shirts. It wasn't necessary.
Too late, sir. It's a done thing.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Morning, Padre.
Uh, Colonel, sir?
How was your visit, sir?
Oh, great.
The general wasn't there.
Oh.
Listen. About last night, sir. There was, uh— There was just
- There was nothing I could do about it.
Sir.
Nothing?
Nothing.
Well, it couldn't have been helped.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, what's that?
Oh, Frank Burns and Hawkeye
Pierce. Very encouraging.
A bunch of the boys asked me to, uh, ask you, Frank, what Hot Lips was like in the sack.
You know, was she—
Mind your own business.
No, Frank. You know, is she better than self-abuse? That was really the sort of basic—
What's that all about? He gonna get some pointers or something?
No. Hawkeye's gonna sign him up to make a personal appearance tour... in all the camps in Korea.
Oh, is that a fact?
Wonder what they're saying.
Can you make it out?
Does that, uh— Does that big ass of hers move around a lot, Frank, or does it sort of lie there flaccid?
What would you say about that?
Um, Hawkeye's questioning the major on a point of anatomy.
Very professional, exchanging ideas.
Would you say that she was a moaner, Frank?
What is Burns saying? Uh, Major Burns isn't saying much of anything, sir.
I think he's formulating the answer.
Seriously, Frank.
I mean, does she go, "Ooooh," or does she just sort of lie there quiet and not do anything at all?
- Keep your filthy mouth to yourself.
- Or does she go, "Uh-uh-uh"?
Get him off me! I've got glasses. Get him off me!
What's going on, Frank?
That lesson one?
Frank Burns has gone nuts!
I'm wearing glasses, for God's sake.
Watch out for your goodies, Hawkeye.
That man is a sex maniac.
I don't think Hot Lips satisfied him. Gonna kill him.
Frank, we love ya.
- Don't let him kiss you, Hawkeye.
# The time has come for us to say sayonara #
# My heart will always be yours for eternity #
# I knew sometime we'd have to say sayonara #
# We promised that we- #
Uh, Colonel, fair is fair. If I nail Hot
Lips and punch Hawkeye, can I go home?
# I'll remember our romance #
# Until the day that I die #
# I see your face in the moon and stars in the sky ##
Hawkeye!
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
Hawkeye!
Oh, shit.
Okay. Hey, listen, Seidman, get another guy.
We gotta take this into the
O.R. Just on the stretcher.
Hold on. You're gonna be just fine, fella.
Okay, I can't move my hand.
Now come on.
Have you got the cut-downs?
You're gonna go to sleep, baby.
You're gonna be just fine.
Hot Lips, let me have one of your sterile knives.
I'm gonna need two vascular clamps and an arterial suture.
As soon as you give me the clamps, I want you to be ready to gown and glove me.
All right? You ready?
Yeah.
Okay. Here we go.
It's going to spurt a bit. Okay.
Got it?
Ay ay baby.
Clamp?
Yeah.
Okay, gown.
- Gloves. You got an arterial suture ready?
- Yeah.
Okay. Ugly, move out of the way,
'cause I'm working around over there.
Baby, we're gonna see some stitching like you never saw before.
Attention. Attention.
Got it?
Okay. Here she goes. A message from Colonel Blake's office.
We're off and running. The American Medical
Association has just declared marijuana... a dangerous drug.
Despite earlier claims by some physicians that it is no more harmful... than alcohol, this is not found to be the case.
That is all.
Oh, really?
As a matter of fact— When did you get them? Let me try it on you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, Dago Redo! Hi. Just in time for cocktails. Come on in.
Uh, no, no. Thank you.
I can't, really. Hawkeye?
Haw-Hawkeye? Hawkeye, could I speak to you? Yeah, go ahead.
No, uh, out
- outside. Outside. What?
I have to talk to you outside.
All right.
Hiya, pup-pup.
Uh, sorry to drag you away from the gang in there, but— What?
This- This'll only take a moment. Um, there's a problem with
Walt Waldowski. Painless?
Painless. You got a toothache? He's a good dentist.
No, no, no. It's not my problem. It's his problem. Um—
What do you mean? What is it?
Well, what is it? That's, um—
It's difficult to talk about, you see, because, um,
I learned about his problem in confession.
Oh, and you can't—
I can't divulge.
Can you give me a hint?
Just an idea.
No. Um—
But I can— I can tell you how, uh— how serious it is.
Um, he and the boys were playing poker, and one of the boys turned to him... and asked him for a ruling on one of the hands.
And Walt said, uh—
He said, "What does it matter?
It's only a game. "
Painless said, "What does it matter?
It's only a game"? "Only a game. "
Poker only a game?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I guess I better go see a man about a tooth.
Thank you.
I didn't know what to... do.
Pup-pup.
You see, there are some—
Uh, there are some things that absolution just, uh—
Well—
Hey, Hawkeye, there's an empty chair here looking for a player.
Oh, baby, I've got a toothache like you can't believe.
Why do you bring that dog in here?
Last time you did, I lost $30.
Listen, why do you have to sit right behind me? It makes me very nervous.
It brings me a lot of luck.
Sit there, Boone.
Come on. Let's play, man.
Deuce. Ace.
Can I take some of your scotch? Sure.
You want some?
No.
How you feeling?
No, no. Don't touch me.
Look. If, uh— if a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left that, uh— that he should be living for?
Okay. Tell me about it.
What's the story?
Well, you know that, uh, little nurse that was through here last night with the 325th?
The little one with the big... boobs. Yeah, the— Yeah, I know. Yeah.
Well, anyway, I, uh—
I wasn't gonna fool around out here... because, you know,
I got these, uh—
I've got these three girls that I'm engaged to back home.
And you wanted to be faithful to them.
Baby, you are 7,000 miles from home-
Anyway, I took her out last night, and I—
I failed. You mean she wouldn't put out? But you—
No, she wanted to in the worst way, but it was me. I just couldn't. Uh—
Oh, you couldn't— It wouldn't get— Yeah, nothing happened.
Not at all. No.
Baby, that happens to everybody.
It's happened to me maybe four or five times-
Yeah, well, it's never happened to me before.
Come on. You're the best-equipped dentist in the army.
You're the dental
Don Juan of Detroit.
That's just a cover-up.
What's a cover-up? Don Juanism.
I've been reading about it all day.
It's a cover-up. It's a cover-up for what?
Well,
I'm a fairy.
A victim of latent homosexuality.
I've turned into a fairy.
Uh—
Have you— Have you done anything? You know.
No, but it's only a matter of time. Yeah.
Boy, I just can't face it.
Look, Hawkeye. Suppose that, uh, you found out that you were one, huh?
One— Yeah. Well, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife.
No, I can see that that would be a problem.
Yeah, well, I got the same problem, only multiplied.
Well, you know, Man o' War, after they retired him from racing, they put him out to, uh— to stud.
And, uh, he had an average... of about 120, 130... foals every year.
And he lived to be 36.
And then when he died, they did an autopsy, and they found out that he was a raving queen.
No. That's- That's a little-known fact, but it's the truth.
Then Painless has got a couple of good years left in him, doesn't he?
Maybe more. He hasn't even started raving yet.
Painless is a dentist, and a dentist shouldn't read. That's his whole problem.
His problem is that he believes it. I mean, he really is convinced.
This
- This— It's an obsession and is a viable force.
Here he comes, the jawbreaker. Oh.
Don't worry. He's not gonna break anything of yours.
Just act, uh, natural.
Hi, Painless.
Hi.
How's she going?
Something in a marshmallow?
No, it's- it's okay, fellas. I know you've been talking about me, and—
Well, I came over to tell you that I've decided that I'm... going to commit suicide.
Oh.
Well, if you’re really gonna go ahead and do it, uh, you think you could— you could leave me your record player?
Oh, sure.
Thank you.
Gonna miss you, Painless. How do you plan to do it? Uh,.45 between the eyes?
Oh, that's awful sloppy.
It's reliable though.
Well, the— That's another thing
I wanted to ask you.
I'm, uh, sort of new at this game and, uh—
Do you have any particular method that you'd recommend?
I don't know. I think my colleagues and I could come up with something, uh, to relinquish the vital forces of their-
Black capsule.
Black capsule.
- Oh, but of course.
Yeah, that's neat.
What's a black capsule? Do you have any of them? Does it work?
It worked for Hitler and Eva Braun.
It's simple, and it's effective.
Uh, Hawkeye, I really must—
I should, uh, check with the military vicar's office.
You see, I cannot give absolution to a man who is about to commit suicide.
It's a mortal sin. Look, Dago, he is not committing suicide.
He is only intending to commit suicide, so you're not dealing with an act.
You're dealing with an intention.
And if it works
- If what we're doing works, then he will not commit suicide.
So, therefore, you are preventing a mortal sin, okay?
Well, I, uh— I should check.
Well, you check on it.
Well, there's—
All right, where you at?
Here you go.
Now then, y'all come here... to say your final farewell to ol' Walt here.
Farewell, Walt.
Dear ol' Walt.
You know, I got an idea that maybe it's not such a final farewell after all.
I think maybe ol' Walt's going on into the unknown—
Say it again. To do a little recon work for us all, huh?
I just— I just wanna say one thing.
Uh, nobody ordered Walt to go on this mission.
He volunteered for certain death.
That's true. That's what we award our highest medals for.
That's beautiful. That's what being a soldier is all about.
Oh, yeah.
Hear, hear!
Gentlemen, I think there's only one person... who has anything to add to that, and that's Dago Red.
Padre. Let's hear it for the padre.
Walt, here's- here's your black capsule.
Oh.
Look, this thing works pretty fast, doesn't it?
I think I better go lie down over there.
Uh, Walt, that'll help you.
Thanks.
# Through early morning fog
I see #
# Visions of the things to be #
# The pains that are withheld for me #
# I realize #
# And I can see #
# That suicide is painless #
# It brings on many changes #
# And I can take or leave it #
# If I please #
# The game of life is hard to play #
# I'm going to lose it anyway #
# The losing card
I'll someday lay #
# So this is all I have to say #
# That suicide is painless # Wherever you're going, Painless, good luck.
# It brings on #
# Many changes #
# And I can take #
# Or leave it if I # I'll always remember you just like this.
# Please #
# The only way to win is cheat #
# And lay it down before I'm beat #
# And to another #
# Give my seat #
# For that's the only #
# Painless feat #
Painless.
# And suicide is painless #
# It brings on many # It was a really nice evening. Thanks for asking me.
# Changes #
# And I can take #
# Or leave it if I please #
The thing is— throwing your whole education away.
# And you #
Good-bye, Jawbreaker.
# Can do #
# The same thing #
# If you #
# Please ##
Hi, baby.
Hi.
I'm glad you could come.
Sorry it was so late.
That's okay.
I really couldn't sleep anyway.
I was so nervous.
You leaving tomorrow?
Mmm, yeah, I'll be on my way in less than 12 hours.
I suppose who it's going to be really roughest on, though, is your husband.
Why are you all of a sudden so concerned with him?
I mean, a man would be more considerate to his wife.
He wouldn't go home a nervous wreck.
You're just gonna have to stop using logic.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. You're just proving... why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
I didn't mean me.
You have the rare privilege that happens on certain occasions... to chief executives of states or nations.
You have the privilege of restoring a human being's life... by a tender act of mercy.
What is this?
Hawkeye, is he dead?
No, no, he's not dead.
Not yet.
Painless has a grave psychological problem, and you are the only person who can help him.
Oh, no, Hawkeye.
Oh, no. Come on.
No, Maria, no. You've gotta look on this as a nurse.
Painless needs it for therapeutic value.
It will help him, and it certainly wouldn't do you any harm either... to think about it for a bit.
If you think that your virtue is more important than Painless's life, that's fine.
That's entirely up to you.
I just want you to stay here... and be with him for a minute.
Just look at him.
Just... stay close to the—
Oh, Hawkeye.
The whole man... and look at him.
Hawkeye.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
You forgot your hat.
You wouldn't want to leave without a souvenir.
Have a good trip.
Lieutenant Schneider, you forgot to pick up your traveling orders.
Wait a second. You're supposed to pick
- These are your traveling orders.
Morning, Painless.
Oh, hi, Hawkeye.
How's she going?
Slept like a doll last night.
Well, can't waste time. Big day.
Got two jaws to rebuild.
Come on, Seidman.
Have a good day.
Attention. Attention.
Religious services for Yom Kippur will be held this-
- will not- will not be held this Friday, due to mitigating circumstances.
For those who wish to observe said holiday, Sunday has been reserved.
That is all.
Trapper, this one's for you, babe.
Knife.
Okay.
That man is a prisoner of war,
Doctor. So are you, sweetheart, but you don't know it.
It's in pretty deep. Uh,
I think that was my finger.
Yeah, I'm gonna need your help,
Hawkeye. It's hit more than a lung.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Hey, Radar?
Yes, sir.
Radar, has that A-negative come in from Seoul yet? I need some right away.
We keep ordering it, but it never arrives.
How'd the kid take the induction, Ugly? Good.
He's ready.
Let's have some irrigation, please.
That's pretty good.
Yeah.
All right, give me some gel foam.
Not now, honey.
Go back to sleep.
Scissors.
Sponge.
More sponges.
Let's have the suction up here, please.
Thank you.
Rib spreader.
Clamp.
Let's give him a sexy scar, huh? Fantastic.
There's a lot of blood.
Sponge.
Go ahead.
Scissors. Watch it.
Give me something to stuff it in with. Clamp.
Pickups for me. How's he tolerating this, Ugly John?
Good. He's young. Things get slippery in there, man.
Ouch!
You're a backhanded guy.
Let me have the forceps and a sponge stick.
Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass, but you're a damn good nurse.
Thanks, Trapper.
Put enough blood in him, will you, John?
There's a clot in the cava above the atrium. That must be the point of entry.
Clamp.
I— I feel a fragment right underneath the clot. You control the cava.
We gotta stop that spurting.
Clamp.
Do what?
Stop the spurting.
That's a very good technical term, Doctor.
This is yours.
Oh, Christ, it's not in the cava. It's in the pulmonary artery on the left side.
Then we close him up and sit on him for a couple days until we get the blood.
We can't sit on him. What if we get jammed? We don't have the blood.
If you cut again, you'll lose him.
Look, Hawkeye, the artery can erode.
Now's the time to take our shot. We gotta shoot crap.
A- negative.
It's been cross-matched.
You said you didn't have any blood. I found a donor.
You know, up close, all crumpled up like that, they don't look like much, you know.
Hey, was he loaded or empty when he crashed?
No, he was loaded.
But it didn't matter much.
See, the, uh— the two guys he was carrying were dead already.
What about the pilot?
What happened to him?
The pilot's fine.
Took off a kneecap.
He lost function in his right hand, but he's great.
I—I didn't hear.
What color was her hair?
Black, shiny.
Shiny black hair.
Black. You like black.
I- I'm kind of partial to blonde myself.
I knew it. I knew you had a— had an attraction... for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Hear, hear!
Go to hell, Captain Pierce. You know I damn near puke every time I look at her.
Besides, she's-
I'll bet she's not a real blonde.
How dare you say that about an officer of the United States Army, sir!
I'll not only say it, but I'll back it with 20 bucks. How's that?
You have yourself a bet, sir.
You're my witness.
I'll be a witness, but who's gonna be the poor schmuck who finds out?
Well, uh, I-I could, if no one else want— I—
No, no, we—
We gotta all see it together somehow.
You know, it's five minutes after the time the nurses usually take their shower.
Where are they?
They will be here.
Finest kind, Ho-Jon.
What's happening?
Radar.
Did you bring us the papers?
What?
You don't know about the papers? What papers?
The colonel left some papers. They're very important. Why didn't you tell me?
I tried to tell you.
Uh, uh, here you go. Here you go. They're coming.
Evelyn, could you give me a hand? Sure.
Hey, uh, Frankie, could you take a look at my corns, please?
Knocko, the pictures of my kids have come.
Pictures of my kids have come. Hot Lips, would you like to see the pictures of my kids?
I'm not the slightest bit interested. Hey, Scorch?
All right.
Oh!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Bravo!
You finks! You finks!
Bravo! Bravo!
What a performance!
Bravo! Author!
Bravo!
What a performance!
Bravo!
Author! Author!
Twenty bucks, huh?
You win the bet.
You bastards!
Keep my stuff!
Major, what went on over there? Where's Colonel Blake?
Wait a second. You can't go and see Colonel Blake.
You shut up, you twerp!
This isn't a hospital!
It's an insane asylum!
And it's your fault because you don't do anything to discourage them!
What do you want me to do?
Put them under arrest.
See what a court-martial thinks of their drunken hooliganism!
First they called me Hot Lips, and you let them get away with it!
And then you let them get away with everything!
If-If you don't... turn them over to the M.P.'s this minute,
I- I'm going to resign my commission!
Goddamn it, Hot Lips, resign your goddamn commission.
My commission!
Little more wine, my dear?
Yes, please.
Is that right? Sure?
You have to get your mother her present first.
You know what I wanna get her?
They have these—
Come on.
You all right?
Let him get what he wants. We'll go to the movie. Keep it straight, eh?
First of all, the present.
Then dinner, then the movie.
You mean all three of us? Who is this?
Where I go, Warren goes. You don't want me to go with you?
Boone.
It's not that. I—
Oh, yes, I do!
He's Syngman Rhee's son, and he goes right in.
Come on, Bandini!
Wilma—
Hey, soldier!
Me?
Yeah, you.
Where you from? A MASH outfit on the front line.
- No, I mean your hometown.
- Uh, on the East Coast.
Have you been wounded yet?
Uh, yeah, a little.
A slight, uh—
Would you like to say hello to your mother?
Uh, my mother's dead, actually.
She's deceased.
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'd like to say hello to my father if I could.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fine, fine.
Hi, Dad.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I am making an examination of this young man, uh, to find out if he would be a soldier in our army.
Oh, yeah, I know. Hi,
Ho-Jon. How's she going, boy?
His heartbeat is much too fast, and his, uh, blood pressure is dangerously high.
Oh, yeah? Ooh.
I guess you probably think he's unfit for the army, eh?
Yes, at first.
But when I saw on his paper... he worked in an American hospital where there are many drugs, and he could have taken some by mistake.
What would he do a thing like that for? Who knows?
To find the truth, I will keep him here with me for a couple days.
By tomorrow, his fast heart and high blood pressure may be gone.
Look- So-So I suggest you say good-bye to him now.
Doctor, I will level— Nice try. It was a nice try.
Come on, Ho-Jon.
Babe, hey—
Oh, man!
The following program is brought to you... through Radio Tokyo by courtesy of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, post number 63 of Sedalia, Missouri.
A federal court ruled that E.I.
Du Pont de Nemours and Company,
Remington Arms Company,
Incorporated... and the Imperial Chemical
Industries Limited of Great Britain... have conspired to divide munitions and chemical markets-
Fore!
Hey!
Idiot!
Idiot! He knocked me down the hill. He broke my umbrella.
Wish they wouldn't land these things here when we're playing golf.
That's him on the right.
Fore!
Whoa! Wait! Wait!
That's Captain Mc—
The lieutenant's come all the way from Seoul, sir, just to see you.
You're Captain Mclntyre?
Yes, I'm Captain Mcln—
Lieutenant, you look terrible.
Look at—
Captain, look at his eyes.
Let me see your tongue.
Oh, no, no. Here, take your shirt off and tell me where it hurts.
I haven't seen a case like this since
I was in school. Oh, my goodness.
Listen, Vollmer, tell them to prepare the major surgery.
This is one case in five.
I think I can save you, Lieutenant.
You're to proceed to
Kokura, Japan immediately.
Kokura, Japan?
What's this all about?
Yeah, his dad's a congressman. Grenade went off in practice. There's a piece in his heart.
What?
GI's dad's a congressman.
Grenade went off in practice.
There's a piece in his heart.
Is that the X-rays?
Yeah.
Apparently some big heart surgeon in Boston told the congressman... the only man to take care of his son is Captain John Mclntyre.
Of course, I suppose there could be two Captain John Mclntyres.
No, no,
I'm the only John Mclntyre.
Look, Hammond says I can take along someone to assist me if I need him.
You wanna come?
Yeah.
Lieutenant,
I think I can save you.
Look, take one of these every half hour.
Now get into your helicopter and button up your shirt, for crying out loud.
You're in a military army!
That piece isn't even close to his heart. I know. I know.
It's nothing, but how many times do you get to go to Japan with your golf clubs?
Come on, Shirley.
Goddamn army.
Goddamn army.
Goddamn army jeep!
Excuse me, soldier. I wonder if you could tell me where the congressman's son is.
He's in ward six. Darling, would you register for us?
Just a moment. You can't go in there. Who are you?
Who am I? I am the pro from Dover, and this is my favorite caddy.
You can't go in till I call
Captain Peterson.
Wait a second. If this soldier wants to enforce her own orders,
I'm gonna take her on single-handedly. You can't go in.
You open this! He's won two Purple Hearts.
- I'm gonna ravage your body, lady!
- You stay away from me. I'll call the police.
I have not seen such a pretty lady!
You can't come in here! Who are you?
I'm gonna call Captain Peterson.
You stay away from me!
And I'm gonna swallow it and chew it!
Oh! Oh!
- Captain Peterson, please.
- Captain Peterson!
What are you two hoodlums doing in this hospital?
Ma'am, we are surgeons, and we are here to operate.
We're just waiting for a starting time, that's all.
You can't even go near a patient until Colonel Merrill says it's okay.
And he's still out to lunch. Look,
Mother, I want to go to work in one hour.
We are the pros from Dover, and we figure to crack this kid's chest... and get out to the golf course before it gets dark.
So you go find the gas passer, and you have him premedicate this patient.
Then bring me the latest pictures on him.
The ones we saw must be 48 hours old by now.
Then call the kitchen and have them rustle us up some lunch.
Ham and eggs will be all right.
Steak would be even better.
Then give me at least one nurse who knows how to work in close without getting her tits in my way.
Oh! You fool!
How do you want your steak cooked?
Towel.
Say the magic word, you make a hundred dollars.
All right,
I demand an explanation.
Somebody get that dirty old man out of this operating theater.
Dirty old man?
I'm Colonel Merrill.
I don't care if you’re Jack
Armstrong, the all-American boy.
If his chest gets infected, I will tell the congressman who did it.
Scissors, please. Here, let me have a skin "sutch. "
Low pickups.
Who was that?
That's Colonel Merrill.
This is his little store here.
Oh, yeah?
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Jekyll, actually.
This is my friend, Mr. Hyde.
Listen, why don't you save your rapier-like wit for the clam diggers back home, Hawkeye.
Approximator.
Did I ever tell you about my friend Me Lay Marston?
Oh, yeah, yeah, that friend of yours who would go around saying...
"Me Lay, you lay," to all the girls.
And, what, he'd score once out of 50 times, huh? Yeah, you told me about him.
He's passing gas for the congressman's son here.
Oh, really? When he's not passing gas, does he play golf?
I don't know.
Do you play golf?
No. I have no time for golf.
I'm moonlighting down at Dr. Yamachi's
New Era Hospital and Whorehouse.
This old guy that I met when I first came over here-
He's got a little crude hospital for kids, and he finances it with a whorehouse, all in the same building.
It's the N.E.H.W.H. Come on down, and we'll get something going for you.
I've got an in in Kokura.
Here, soldier, take these.
Take our golf carts. Be careful.
Don't drop any of those things...
'cause we're gonna play golf with
'em. It's important. Bye, pimp.
Ladies.
Girls.
Gentlemen.
Be careful of that—
Military police.
All right, fellas.
The game's over.
Finally caught up with us, huh?
Where did we fail?
I don't know.
I think it was the woman.
Something tells me
I've seen her someplace before.
She was the one in Tangiers.
You can wait in the colonel's office.
He'll be back in a few minutes.
Sir.
We don't blame you.
You were only doing your job.
United Press International... today voted the Korean War the top news story... of 1951.
Shh! We're in the middle of putting.
The Allied high position in Germany
- My God.
All right.
You men are under arrest.
I'll have you court-martialed.
Ah, come off it, Colonel.
You won't have us.
We have you.
Your boys blew this case, and we... bailed you out.
Now, we are going to stay here for one more day... and check out the congressman's kid... and—
Get in some golf for ourselves.
If that's okay with you, then we got a deal.
And if it isn't, then we can always call Washington... and you tell them your story, and we'll tell them ours.
It's simple as that. In the meantime, we are going to be... at the pro shop, where we are going to have a shower and a shave.
If you want to get in touch with us, that is where we will be.
Is that a client?
Is it— Is it— Oh, no.
I've got sinuses too. Put some of that in that one.
Put it on a plate.
How about sake?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Separate.
Excuse me.
What is that?
That really looks good.
Oh, you try only one first.
Good?
Oh, it's terrible.
Wasabi?
Uh, listen, I, uh, hate to do this to you fellas, but— Hey, man, look at that.
Think you could take a minute and look at a kid for me?
Now?
A kid?
Yeah. We had a little carelessness around here, and the other day... one of our girls presented us with an eight-pound American-Japanese boy.
Well, whatever we feed him, it either comes right back up, or he coughs and turns blue.
He just has a hell of a time.
We don't have to see him.
Just call that half-assed army hospital and tell them to get Lipiodol ready for his stomach, and we'll go over and take some X-rays.
We can't get near that place.
We can't— You know, with a civilian—
The colonel has a thing about it, especially a native, as he likes to-
Then don't tell him any more than is necessary.
Tell him the pros from Dover are on their way with an emergency.
Tell him to get the O.R. Ready, get the kid asleep, and Trapper and I will fix his tracheo-esophageal fistula.
Okay, Me Lay, put him down in here.
Get him asleep as quick as you can, will you?
Where did this baby come from?
Watch him, all right?
Is this what you got us up for?
Yeah, that's what we got you up for.
We stumbled on him.
We don't want him, but we don't feel we can back away from him.
All right, this time
I will not be intimidated.
I command that this illegal and improper use of army facilities cease immediately.
On this point, I stand as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar. Me Lay.
And, furthermore—
You can't do-
What the Sam Hill are you—
- Wow.
This one is for West Point.
- What the Sam Hill is going on here?
- That's what they all say.
What a filthy, disgusting, despicable-
There's no competition to the Painless
Pole, but it's pretty healthy, I think.
- Oh, Colonel, we caught you with your pants down.
What about the men that are fighting for our country and our land?
Attention. Attention.
Colonel Blake has secured for us
The Halls of Montezuma.
So big, only the biggest of the screen can bring it to you all.

Hey, Dago.
Hi.
You have a nice time in Japan?
Yeah, I screwed a Kabuki dancer.
Okay?
You're doing—
Let me have the long fingers.
It's okay for now. Yeah, but
I can't stop this bleeding.
Keeping the blood in, Painless.
How's the intake, Painless?
Normal.
Clamp.
I'm here if you need me,
Henry.
I can't talk to you now, Padre. No, uh—
Sponge stick. Sponge stick.
- Oh, he's going to be fine.
- Oh, good. Does anybody else need help?
It's taken too long.
Get a clamp.
Ask around.
What's he got the flaps down for?
Duke?
Come on, Duke. Open up.
No, I don't want any. Hey,
Duke, come on! Open up, man!
Who is it?
What the hell you doing back here?
Come on. We've been working for hours. Will you open up?
Oh, wait a minute.
I'll be right with you.
Hi, Hot Lips.
You miss us?
# Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah #
# Shame, shame on you ##
I— Uh—
Well—
Radar.
Yes, sir.
Hold this, please.
Colonel Blake.
Henry?
Yeah, Charlie here. Yeah.
I've, uh, got news for you.
You were so concerned about the battle for Old Baldy.
Well, it's all over.
Oh, that's great news, General.
Who won?
Oh, by the way,
I have a report here, Henry, from your, uh— from your chief nurse Major O'Houlihan.
She makes some accusations,
Henry, I find pretty hard to believe.
Don't believe them then.
Thank you, General. Good-bye.
Yeah. What?
Uh, thank you, Radar.
You're welcome, sir.
Attention. Attention.

That is all.
I'll be with Colonel Blake.
Uh, check this place out. See what the nurses are like, huh?
Right, Charlie.
4077th Mobile Army Surgical—
Yeah. Yeah.
Sir, do you know where—
Yes, I know where he is.
Oh, all right.
All right.
Thank you.
Look, Charlie, you can't blame Henry because Hot
Lips Houlihan can't stand her name.
You know, she's just a lady, though.
What the hell. Come on, for crying out loud.
She's regular army.
She's a fanatic about ritual.
She-She won't even let us play football.
Football?
Gentlemen.
She's all lined up, Charlie.
Yeah?
I- I didn't know you had a football team.
Well, it's pretty much in the planning stages. We've, uh—
No, no, we have a— we have a very fine football team.
Yeah? Well, we had a team back with the 325th EVAC last year.
And what a team that was. Yeah, yeah. I
- I coached the boys myself.
He's the finest coach in the Far East.
Yeah. Uh, we're now trying to work out a schedule... of the outfits that we're going to play this year.
Of course, we, you know, throw a little money into a pot and make bets.
How much, uh— How much money do you put into your pot?
Oh, 5,000, 6,000.
Oh, look. You know, I don't think we're in the sort of league that you're in.
Well, I'm sure we can find a date when we can play your team.
It can be arranged.
Yeah.
I think I'll just talk this over with Henry, huh?
Thanks, boys.
Thanks for the drink.
Thank you.
What the hell you—
Sir, ever since the dark days before Pearl Harbor,
I've been proud to wear this uniform.
What the hell is this?
A helicopter.
Hawkeye, that man has five times the manpower to draw on than we do.
Sure, so we get ourselves a ringer, right?
We get Henry to apply, make a specific application for a neurosurgeon.
He asks for
Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones?
Oh, he's— Who is Oliver Harmon
Jones? Who the hell is Harmon Jones?
He is better known as "Spearchucker" Jones.
He's a good ballplayer.
Oh, yeah!
He's that Negro boy played with the
49ers, ain't he? He's incredible.
Sure. Yeah, sure. I remember.
He's good. He's good.
Henry, if we had closer relations, we wouldn't have this misunderstanding, right?
Now, that's where a football game would help between your outfit and mine.
Football game? Yeah, yeah. We put up a few bets-
5,000 maybe- and have a little fun.
Special Services in Tokyo says it's one of the best gimmicks we've got... to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
Betting?
No! Football!
But what about
Major O'Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her. Gee, I don't know—
It's a helicopter, Charlie.
I know it's a helicopter!
Uh, you know, you guys have one problem.
I just wonder about the social problem.
You know, I mean, he's the only Negro officer in the whole camp, you know.
We got a problem— Then we'll stick him in here with us, baby boy.
You-You're serious, ain't ya?
You'd do that.
Sure, I'm serious.
Yeah.
It's enough for me to have to put up with you two Yankees, but, you know, uh, that's-
Was it his wife? Uh, was that why, or was it the religious-
It was— It was a conditioning problem.
Why do they call you "Spearchucker"?
I used to throw the javelin.
All right, men, we're not here to sell lemonade. We're here to practice.
But first, I'd like to officially welcome Spearchucker.
Is it all right to call you that?
Call me whatever you want to.
Good. Well, I just want you to know that we're all the same here on the playing field.
Uh, officers and men alike.
Now we're going to begin... with the three basic principles— organization, discipline and teamwork.
Now— Pardon me. Do you mind if we limber up first?
Oh, that's a good idea.
You organize that.
Hold that line, hey!
Hold that line, hey!
All right, Seidman. Keep 'em pushing that, uh, whatever you call it.
Oh, that's good. All right, Hot Lips, keep their arms and limbs moving there.
Very good.
Radar, you're a coach!
You're not a corporal. You're a coach! Keep 'em going through there.
Good, Hot Lips.
All right, Seidman, give 'em five.
All right, men, take five.
Spearchucker.
Well, we look pretty lousy, don't we?
Well, for college players that have been out of training for seven or eight years, yeah, you look pretty lousy.
Listen, I got an idea how we can make some money.
We leave him out of the first half of the game.
We bet half our money.
They roll up some points, okay?
Second half of the game, we stick him in. We get odds from them.
We bet the other half of the money, and we clean up.
That's very good thinking,
Captain. Yeah, it sounds good to me.
Oh, and I had another idea. I think we should have some plays. I gotta get some water.
You know, usually in football, if you have some organized plays—
Well, if you don't mind,
I took the liberty.
Oh, you— Oh. I drew up about seven or eight plays.
Oh, these are good. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
Oh, very good. Yes.
Oh, very, very good.
Uh, what are these little arrows?
Right in Smith's hands.
Oh!
Well, it's only six points.
Six points?
Hut!
Oh, well. It's only one point.
- One point?
- Who's Number 1? That man runs like a rabbit. We can't stop him.
I remember him from the pros. They call him "Super
Bug. " Had one year with the Rams before the army.
We can't do anything with him in there.
You gotta come in now.
We can't wait till the second half.
We gotta stick to our strategy. But the first thing you guys have to do is get him out of the ball game.
Hey, Davidson. Yeah.
Let's ease up just a little bit. Uh, we don't want the score too lopsided.
We caught it!
Get him! Yeah!
Get him!
Get him! Yeah!
Get him!
- Who's he giving it to?
- Isn't that Corporal Judson with the ball?
Judson? Judson's a lineman!
Judson can't run!
Look at him. He's loose.
He's loose. He's—
For crying out loud,
Judson, what are you doing?
I don't know. What are you doing with the ball?
All right, come on.
Let's get in a huddle.
You had the whole field open.
What'd you go and fall down for?
I'm not a goddamn runner.
I'm a lineman.
Let's go!
We're gonna really clean up today. Ah.
Hut one, hut two!
Uh, it's only two points.
Two points?
What the hell you think you are, a cannon?
What kind of a snap was that?
We got a lot of money on this game.
This is embarrassing, man.
Let's go!
Yea!
What happens now?
We get a free kick.
A free kick! Go!
Kick that ball!
Kick that ball!
Another six points.
Another six points?
Look. Look. He's- He's hurt.
He's leaving the game.
He's hurt! He's hurt! He's leaving the game. He's hurt!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Smith! Smith!
Goddamn bastards pulled something.
Hey, Coach, did I break my nine 400?
Four hundred? This is not a track meet, this is a football game!
What the hell you think I pay you for? I gotta run the 220.
What? Get him up. Walk him around. Do something.
I'll run the 440. 440? This is a football game, goddamn it!
All right, you guys, get in there and kill 'em!
All right, Bub, your fuckin' head is coming right off.
I'm ready, Coach. I'm ready,
Coach. Ready? For what?
I'm in the broad jump, Coach. Get him back on the bench. Broad jump!
Still 16-nothing.
16-nothing.
Well, that's not bad.
16-nothing in the first half.
Guess I have to give them the old Knute Rockne at halftime.
About time for the gun.
Right.
Yea!
He runs like a mother, but how we gonna score—
Men, ever since the dark days before Pearl Harbor,
I have been proud to wear this uniform. Boone, you got a towel?
Henry, have you pressed the bets yet? Today, we are wearing—
Henry, have you pressed the bets yet? Oh, the bets.
Henry, press the bets, man. The bets, the bets. Finish the halftime speech.
Hit 'em with a mortar!
Kick 'em off the hill!
Mash 'em, smash 'em, kill, kill, kill!
Hot Lips, there's a time and a place for everything, damn it!
Right. Bo-bo.
Bo-bo!
Come on, Smitty.
Come on.
Yeah.
What's the matter with him? What's the matter? Hell, you oughta know.
You guys pulled something out there.
Well, I guess you don't wanna double the bet.
Oh, the hell I don't. We were beating you without him, and we'll go on beating you.
Are you prepared to back that up with odds?
Damn right. Three-to-one.
Double the bet.
Who's that 24?
Who is he?
Stop it! Stop him!
Stop him! Stop him!
Who is that guy?
He wasn't in the game in the first half. Stop him!
That's "Spearchucker" Jones.
"Spearchucker" who?
He played with San Francisco before he got drafted. Boy, he's gonna be tough to stop too.
Tough to— Ah, Henry, you brought in a ringer, did you? Huh?
Radar?
Yes, sir?
What's the general trying to say? Didn't bring him in in the first half, did you?
He's just been informed as to the identity of our, uh, Spearchucker.
His ringer spotted our ringer.
How do you like them apples, Charlie?
You can't trust anybody.
Now watch him make the extra point!
Hut three!
Isn't that illegal?
Relax, Charlie.
What kind of team is it?
Relax. They're falling around like dead flies.
All right.
Ball is down. Ball is down.
No piling.
Let's get 'em up.
Look, a red flag!
We've got a red flag!
Hot Lips!
It's a penalty, you blithering idiots.
Judson, get off of him.
You'll be thrown out of the game!
Judson, kill him!
What's wrong with you, huh? We're here to play football, not fight!
Bastard 88 called me a coon.
Called you a what?
Coon.
That's an old pro trick to get you thrown out of the ball game.
Well— Why don't you do the same thing to him?
What, call him a coon?
No, no, the boys in camp used to talk about his sister.
Her name was Gladys.
Use it.
Yeah.
All right! All right!
Ready, set—
What the hell is he doing, for God's sake?
What's the matter here?
Takin' him out.
Hey, you big ape!
Blockhead!
Sixty-nine is divine!
Sixty-nine is divine!
There you go, Charlie! Another side of beef for your butcher shop!
Let's get the ball and really go!
Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Who's the little brunette? Is she a new one?
Yeah, I just had her shipped in. Yeah, not bad.
Kill 'em!
Kill 'em, goddamn it!
Hut one!
Hey!
My God, they've shot him!
Hot Lips, you incredible nincompoop, it's the end of the quarter.
What did I make you a major for?
For a team like that?
I did the best I could, Charlie. I didn't know they were gonna bring him in.
I oughta put you in there and let them kill you. What about my knee, Charlie?
Better get on your goddamn knee and start praying. Trick knee, my ass.
My God!
Hut!
Not bad, huh?
Did you see that?
Get the hell back there!
Where's my— Get back there!
Time.
Well, looks like we may make it. Seconds to go. All right.
Okay, fellas. We don't have very much time left.
I just checked with the ref. I got a special play I want to run— a center eligible play.
We line up with everybody to the right of the center, except Hawkeye, who drops back one yard just before the snap of the ball.
Now, that makes you the center eligible.
But all you have to do is take the ball right back from Trapper between your legs... and hide it under your belly and walk toward their goal line.
All right?
- Hey, Trapper.
- All right, come on.

My Early Life by Winston Spencer Churchill.
On the 16th of September, 1897, at the age of 22,
I found myself taking part in a punitive expedition of the Malakand Field Force on the northwest frontier of India.
In a sense, I had arranged for my participation in this action myself.
August the 5th, 1897.
A letter to General Sir Bindon Blood:
"Sir, I do hope you will not be annoyed if I remind you that you once promised me that when you had your next command, you would try to find a place for me".
"Very difficult. No vacancies.
Come up as a correspondent.
We'll try to fit you in. Blood".
Now, which of these gallant chaps will lead me to something really exciting, an adventure I can write about?
That column there?
Or that one? It's all a lottery, isn't it?
Just luck.
God, I hope I'm lucky today.
The jok e of it all is that I never really wanted to be a soldier.
No. Politics, parliament, that's my arena.
But how am I to get there?
I have no reputation, no family in the government.
And worst of all, no money.
Ah, money. My darling mother wrote to me often on that tiresome subject:
"Really, Winston, you are simply irresponsible about money.
I am sending the man the 11 pounds he asks, but why will you write cheques when you have no money in the bank?
Actually, in America, you know, it's illegal.
And they sentence people to long terms in jail for doing it.
My dear, do be careful.
And do write when you can.
Please, please, don't tak e any unnecessary risks.
Your loving mother,
Jennie Randolph Churchill".
Who's that bloody fool on the grey?
Can't tell.
Someone who wants to get noticed,
I should imagine.
He'll be noticed.
He'll get his head blown off.
Sir!
Lieutenant Churchill, sir.
4th Hussars.
Actually, I'm here as a correspondent.
Pioneer and Saily Telegraph.
I wonder, if you're going to that village up there, would you mind awfully if I came along with you?
Ah yes. Churchill,
4th Hussars.
Actually, we don't care much for correspondents out here, Churchill.
Or white horses, either.
Where'd you get him?
Uh, in the auction last week, sir. Malakand Pass.
Previous owner killed?
I believe so, yes, sir.
Didn't that teach you anything?
Sir?
Well, come along if you like.
But keep out of the way.
Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, one more thing.
We do try to bring our wounded back.
These chaps can be very nasty.
But as you're only an onlooker,
I can't guarantee anything. Understood?
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
The truth is, I'm not at all brave. in fact, the truth is, I've often felt myself a coward, especially at school.
But if I could win a reputation for courage and daring, if I could be mentioned in despatches, that would help me to get started in politics.
In short, I need medals.
Lots and lots of medals.
And I have to learn so much, and there's so little time.
I have to read all the books
I should have read before.
I must become my own university.
And I must overcome my speech impediment when I speak in public.
The Spanish ships
I cannot shee... See.
For they are not in shite... Site.
Samn!
Move it!
Is everybody gone, sir?
All gone, sir.
Very well, then.
Carry on.
Carry on!
Number three section, follow me!
Wouldn't you know it?
All this way for nothing.
Talk about rotten luck.
Right, we'll start back now.
Keep a dozen men, will you, and cover us till we get halfway down, will you.
Then we'll cover you.
Right.
Come along, Mr. Cartlidge, we're going back now.
Very well, sir. Come along and huddle it up.
Bring them down.
Head's up.
Lieutenant general, come with me.
It's not bad at that.
Could be worth two or three hundred words.
Get back. Get back!
Willy! Come on, get out of there.
Come down!
We'll cover you!
Fall back!
Fall back!
No, sahib, leave me.
Oh, sahib, you're hurting me.
Sahib, let me go!
Oh, please, on my knees,
I am begging you.
Come on, you idiot, get out of it!
Get out of it!
" And to conclude these despatches, the general in the field wishes to mention and commend the courage of
Lieutenant W L S Churchill, who made himself useful at a critical moment".
And thereupon,
I sat down and wrote a book.
And the literary critics were most kind to me:
"If General Kitchener should ever find time to read Mr. Winston Churchill's new book, The Malakand Field Force, it's fascinating to imagine the great warrior's reaction to it.
The book is excellent for a first effort, but perhaps its title should have been:
Some Helpful Hints for Generals
From a Young Lieutenant".
Hurry up now, sahib, the train is about to leave.
For some reason unknown to me,
I have always been charged with being unpunctual.
But then, in my lifetime,
I have constantly been accused of many wick ed things.
Perhaps I paid for all those sins, real or imaginary, in advance, for when I was but 7,
I was cast out of my happy home, and sent away to school.
I left behind me all who were dear to me, especially my nurse,
Mrs. Everest...
Winnie, bye-bye! who look ed after me and tended all my wants, and to whom I poured out all my troubles.
And for some reason
I cannot now remember,
I called her "Womany".
And when I went away,
I think I missed her most of all.
"Searest Mother, my white horse has been a marvellous investment.
Everyone noticed me.
The news here is that Kitchener is going to fight the dervishes in the Sudan.
Mother, darling, you must use all your influence and charm to get me into his command".
My American mother always seemed to me a fairy princess.
A radiant being, possessed of limitless riches and power.
She shone for me lik e the evening star.
I loved her dearly.
But at a distance.
Nevertheless, it was my father who was the greatest and most powerful influence on my early life.
He was the second son of the Suk e of Marlborough and a Tory member of the House of Commons.
Good morning, good morning.
Unfortunately, if my mother had little time for me in those days,
I saw and spok e to my father even less.
He numbered among his friends, some of the most important men in parliament, and indeed in all England.
Men lik e Lord Salisbury, the leader of the Tory party, which was then in opposition.
His nephew, Arthur Balfour.
And Joseph Chamberlain.
And even I knew that one day, when the people came to their senses and swept the Conservatives back into power, it would be these men who, together with my father, would form the government.
No Lord Rothschild?
Are none of your Jewish friends to be with us today, Randolph?
No, I didn't think it would be fair to them.
You know how easily bored they are.
Winston.
Thank you, sir.
Now, we enter this in your name.
So...
And then you can purchase anything you like from the school shop.
Up to the limit of your credit, of course.
I'm afraid Winston doesn't quite understand about money yet.
We shall teach him.
This young man will be very happy here,
Lady Randolph, I assure you.
I am certain he will.
Would you take tea,
Lady Randolph?
Well, I'm afraid I can't.
I shall miss my train.
Another time perhaps, when I come again.
You will be good, darling.
And you will write, won't you?
Yes, Mama.
And so, young Churchill, here we are.
Come along.
Yes, sir.
I am going to tell you something
I shall want you to remember always.
Your school days are the most important days of your life.
How you get on here will determine precisely how you get on in the world.
Succeed here, and you will succeed as a man.
Fail here... and you will be a failure to the end of your days.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Your father is a great man.
Be like him in all things.
Now, you wait here while I see about getting you settled in.
Have you had any Latin?
Latin? No, sir.
Hmm.
While I am gone, learn this.
This, on the right-hand page.
When I return... we shall see how well you have done.
They are ready for you.
Come along.
Now, then, have you learnt it?
I think I can say it, sir.
Then please do so.
Mensa: a table.
Mensa: O table.
Mensam: a table.
Mensae: of table.
Mensae: to or for a table.
Mensa: by, with or from a table.
Very good. Come along.
Excuse me, sir, but what does it mean?
It means what it says.
Mensa: a table.
Mensa is a noun of the first declension.
There are five declensions.
You have learnt the singular of the first declension.
Yes, sir.
But what does it mean?
I have told you.
Mensa in Latin means "a table".
But it means
" O table" too, sir.
And what does " O table" mean?
"Mensa: O table" is the vocative case.
O table.
You would use that in addressing a table, in invoking a table.
You would use it in speaking to a table.
But I never do, sir.
Churchill, in this school, if you are impertinent, you will be punished and punished, let me tell you, very severely.
Come along.
McSweeney,
P J M W.
" He exhibits rather too relaxed an attitude towards the disciplines of academic life.
Gamma".
Stand forward,
McSweeney.
Mr. McSweeney, I shall be obliged if, after this assembly you will take your customary step through my study door.
"Sear Mama, I hope you are well.
I'm very happy at school.
I do wish you could come and visit me one day soon".
"He gabbles his translations and is dirty with his written work".
Step forward,
Stuart MacKenzie.
May, A C W.
Stand forward, Mr. May.
Mr. Belcher tells me in this report that you suppose noise to be an effective camouflage for inattention.
You will shortly give me your attention in the study, where we will explore your capacity for making noise.
Mr. May, you're first.
... which is, in my view, essential.
Oh, come, come, it really is time the Honourable Member stopped trying to introduce bogus bills in order to prevent action on bona fide ones.
Mr. Speaker!
Mr. Speaker, I protest!
Those words should be taken down.
Hear, hear!
Mr. Speaker, I agree.
I wholeheartedly agree.
Those words should be taken down.
Will the gentlemen of the press please take these words down?
It really is... time the Honourable Member stopped trying to introduce bogus bills!
"Sear Papa, how are you?
I am well.
Mr. Churchill!
I am very happy at school.
I had a nice birthday. Thank you ever so much for the present.
I know you're ever so busy, but it would be ever so nice if you could come one Sunday".
And when the next election came, my mother married an American flav our to the proceedings.
Mind your skirts, dearie.
Good morning!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are we new in the neighbourhood, ma'am?
I must say, I don't recall the pleasure.
Well, you've come to the right place to save a bit of money.
It never hurts to do a little shopping yourself, I always say.
And learn your way about, in effect, ma'am.
What can I do for you, ma'am?
Actually, I want to talk to you about the election.
My husband, Lord Randolph Churchill, is standing for this constituency.
And I'm helping him to get elected.
Oh, uh...
Ma'am, in this constituency in effect, we vote as we please.
And we don't like people coming round asking us for our votes.
Furthermore, I never discuss politics with women.
Even ladies, ma'am, begging your pardon.
In... In... In... In effect.
But I want your vote.
How am I to get it if I don't ask for it?
Indeed.
Well, that's a point.
Quite so. You...
You have a point there, ma'am.
It is a point, but it's no use.
I'm a life-long liberal.
Besides, I don't hold with lordships lolling about the House of Commons.
No. Horses for courses, I say.
Lords for lords, commons in the Commons, in effect, ma'am.
But my husband doesn't loll.
He never lolls.
He works very hard.
That's why he isn't here and I am, in his place.
In effect.
Oh, and what time, may I ask, does His Lordship arise in the morning?
Most days, about 11.
You see, the House sits at night.
Sometimes very late.
He st... He stays in bed till 11?
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am
I could never vote for a man who lies abed until 11:00.
That is the end of it, ma'am. Good day.
Good day.
Just a moment.
Doesn't get out of bed till 11, does he?
Well, ma'am, looking at you now, it's a wonder to me he bothers to get out at all.
Good day to you, ma'am.
Good evening.
Welcome home, milady.
Thank you, Evans. Betty,
Marlene. Is Lord Randolph in?
No, milady.
Oh. Where's Everest?
I'm here,
Lady Randolph.
If I might speak to you?
Now, please.
When did this happen?
Have you called the doctor?
We shall be taking him out of that place.
Won't we, milady?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lord Randolph Churchill,
Secretary of State for India.
Lord Randolph. Many people give you the major credit for the return of the Conservative Party to power.
Yet there is a rumour that you tendered your resignation to the prime minister,
Lord Salisbury.
I trust I am not here to exchange gossip or to encourage a rumour.
But you will not deny there is friction between yourself and Lord Salisbury.
I refuse to discuss that any further.
To put an end to it, let me say that I have never run away from a fight when I believed it necessary.
But I am and always will be loyal to the Tory Party.
Mind you... some of my friends in my own party have a great lesson to learn.
The Tory Party will never remain in power until it gains the confidence of the minorities and the working classes.
Because the working classes are quite determined to govern themselves.
Ah, yes. Your theory of Tory democracy.
It is said that there are few who take it seriously.
Really?
Yes. After all, as an aristocrat it's difficult to accept you as an advocate of democracy.
Many people think you use it as a device to make yourself prime minister in Lord Salisbury's place.
Do you?
Not at all.
Good.
Recently, you've expressed strong views on the state of the Irish question.
Ah, well...
The Irish question...
That, I'm afraid, will never be solved.
Quite.
Now, Lord Randolph, on a more personal note, you and Lady Randolph, the former American heiress Jennie Jerome, are leaders of society.
Your racehorses are most successful, you entertain lavishly, and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales attends your dinners frequently.
And Lady Randolph and you are identified with all that is new and fashionable.
Your splendid home here in Connaught Place is one of the few to have electric lighting.
How do you find it?
Do you prefer it to gas?
Well, it's all rather up-to-date, I suppose.
That thing in the cellar...
I think you call it the dynamo.
...is rather noisy.
The lights will keep going out always at the wrong times.
No, I don't think that electric light will ever replace gas.
At least, not in private houses.
No, no.
I believe, Lord Randolph, you have a son.
What? Yes, actually.
Two.
Two sons,
Winston and Jack.
No doubt, they're very proud of their father.
Oh.
That thought had never occurred to me.
I had scarcely passed my 12th birthday when I entered the inhospitable regions of examinations, through which, for the next seven years
I was destined to journey.
These examinations were a great trial to me.
I should have lik ed to be ask ed to say what I knew.
They always contrived to ask what I did not know.
This sort of treatment had only one result:
I did not do well in examinations.
Begin.
This was especially true of my entrance examination to Harrow.
I wrote my name at the top of the page.
I wrote the number of the question: one.
And after much reflection,
I put a brack et around it.
But thereafter, I could not think of anything connected with it that was either relevant or true.
Incidentally, there arrived from nowhere in particular a blot and several smudges.
I gazed for two whole hours at this sad spectacle.
Then, merciful ushers collected my piece of fool's cap with all the others and carried it up to the headmaster's table.
Longhaired boy in the second row.
It was from these slender indications of scholarship that Mr. Welldon, the headmaster drew the conclusion that I was worthy to pass into Harrow.
It is very much to his credit.
It showed that he was a man capable of looking beneath the surface.
A man not dependent upon paper manifestations.
I have always had the greatest regard for him.
Happy Christmas, Lord Randolph.
Thank you.
And to you, my boy.
Well, Mr. Buckle, a visit from me to The Times at this hour must be a surprise to you.
Oh, The Times has learnt never to be surprised by Lord Randolph Churchill.
Then, perhaps, this will surprise you.
This is a letter from you to the prime minister.
That is correct.
But it's a letter of resignation from the cabinet.
That is also correct.
Lord Randolph.
You have taken me into your confidence by showing me this letter.
I ask you...
I beg you not to send it to Lord Salisbury.
I already have.
That's a copy.
Then I urge you to withdraw it.
That's not possible.
Lord Randolph, once before you threatened to resign and the prime minister retreated.
This time, he will stand firm.
Really?
Forgive me if I seem to be taking a liberty, but for you to resign now, to leave the government at this time, on this issue of the budgets for the army and navy would be a tragic error.
You must not do it.
I have no choice.
I'm pledged to economy up to my eyes.
I gave my word.
How can I accept this flagrant misuse of public money?
May I say that public money has been wasted before and the nation has survived.
As I understand it, every one of your colleagues in the cabinet is willing to accept this bill.
Then why do you feel it necessary to resign?
Because in addition to being leader of the House of Commons,
I'm also chancellor of the exchequer.
I am responsible for the country's money.
Why resign? In protest?
The country will not be grateful. After all, isn't this a matter of national defence?
Withdraw this resignation.
At once. Now.
The prime minister has already accepted it.
I have his letter here.
Mr. Buckle, I came to you, rather than any other editor in the hope that you, of all people, would give me your support.
I see.
The Times has criticised the government when we thought it necessary.
But we will not lend a hand toward bringing it down.
Will you, at least, publish both my letter and the prime minister's reply?
No.
Both letters are private communications between you and Lord Salisbury.
To publish his letter,
I would have to have the prime minister's permission.
That you will never get.
I presume I shall see the news in tomorrow's edition of The Times?
Yes. Tomorrow.
Randolph!
Randolph!
Randolph.
Randolph.
Quite a surprise for you.
It is true.
It must be. It's in
The Times, isn't it?
Last night, you knew.
You knew then, and you didn't tell me.
When you said you were going to the club, you were going to The Times.
I saw no reason to spoil your evening.
But you've worked so hard.
Yes, I'm very tired.
Why don't we take a holiday?
We've arranged to be home at Christmas.
We have engagements.
Mr. Moore, my lord.
Oh, dear, yes.
Show him in, will you?
Good morning, Lady Randolph.
Good morning, Mr. Moore.
Lord Randolph.
Yes, it's quite true, Moore.
Now, be a good fellow, have a cup of coffee with us.
No, thank you. I...
I just came to tell you that if I can ever serve you in a private capacity,
I would be honoured.
Very kind of you.
Do sit down.
Thank you, no. I...
I really must go.
I'll see you to the door.
I'll see myself out,
Lady Randolph. I...
In all my 20 years in Her Majesty's government,
I have never served a more able or more brilliant minister.
He has flung himself from the top of the ladder.
He will never reach it again.
Winston, hurry up.
The dev oted Mr. Moore had a heart attack and died shortly thereafter.
I can see my father now in a somewhat different light than I did in those days.
I have long since passed the age when he died, and I understand very clearly the suicidal nature of his resignation.
My mother remained, as always, loyal and steadfast.
A light on Marmion's visage spread
And fired his glazing eye:
With dying hand, above his head
He shook the fragment of his blade
And shouted, "Victory!
Charge, Chester, charge!
On, Stanley, on!"
Were the last words of Marmion.
"Searest Mother and Father, two weeks from Monday there is to be prize-giving in the Speech Room.
I have memorised 600 lines from
Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome, and if I can get
1000 lines by heart, which I will do,
I am bound to get a prize.
So will you please both come down?
Everyone will be there.
And it would mak e me so happy if you were there to see me win a prize.
You have never been down to see me at Harrow. Either of you.
And this would be a perfect time.
So, dearest Mummy and Papa, please, please, please, do, do, do come.
Your loving son,
Winston S. Churchill".
And under that great battle
The earth with blood was red
And, lik e the Pomptine fog at morn
The dust hung overhead
And louder still and louder
Rose from the dark ened field
The braying of the war-horns
The clang of sword and shield
Come in.
Oh, Dr. Roose, do come in.
Thank you.
He is better, isn't he?
Oh, do sit down.
I shan't be a moment.
Will you have a cup of coffee with me?
Lady Randolph, I should like you to meet Dr. Bluzzard, whom I have consulted.
But I thought he was getting better.
I am sorry to have to tell you, madame, that your husband is very ill.
You must, I fear, prepare yourself for the worst.
Dr. Bluzzard.
We agreed to be frank with Lady Randolph, did we not?
Frank, yes. But I see no necessity to be brutal.
What is it?
What are you talking about?
Lady Randolph, it is my sad duty to tell you that Lord Randolph is suffering from an incurable disease.
From which, at the most, he will die within five or six years.
Stop!
What are you telling me?
You're talking about a man who is only 38 years old!
Lady Randolph, please believe this is extremely painful for us.
Do sit down.
May we?
Lady Randolph,
I am a specialist and what I have to tell you is,
I am sorry to say, beyond question.
But what is the cure?
There is no cure.
But what is it?
Why don't you tell me?
Let us call it... an inflammation of the brain.
In the years to come, although he will seem to recover, although he will seem from time to time to be perfectly normal, in fact, he will deteriorate consistently.
He will suffer paralysis in his limbs, and his speech will become impaired. As will his mind.
There will be periods of violence.
I am sorry, believe me.
But it is necessary for you to know.
Is it true?
It can't be.
It isn't true, is it?
Yes.
Yes, I'm afraid it is.
Oh, my God.
Randolph.
Does he know?
No. And in our opinion, he should never know.
Lady Randolph?
Yes?
How recently have you had physical relations with your husband?
Why do you ask?
Forgive me, but it is a matter of some importance.
I beg you.
Hmm.
Not for a considerable period.
If it is necessary for you to know... perhaps not for... a considerable time.
Thank God.
Yes. Thank God.
Neither you nor the two boys are in any way affected.
But I'm afraid there must be no further physical relations between you and your husband... ever again.
Good morning, Mother.
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Winston.
Winston!
Go to your room and stay there until you learn how to behave in a civilised manner!
Yes, Father.
Don't you think that was a little excessive?
His manners are atrocious.
I know.
But most boys are ugly and tiresome at his age.
To the best of my memory,
I was always fairly presentable.
I do not recall grunting at table like a pig on heat.
Randolph, we haven't seen much of Winston this past year.
And he does worship you.
You were right, of course.
But you were a bit harsh.
Nonsense.
You don't really think that, do you?
Well, if you ever spoke to me like that...
I'd feel as if you didn't care about me at all.
Of course.
Perhaps I should have a chat with him.
Oh, that would be nice.
Yes, I think I'll do it now.
Why don't you finish your breakfast?
No. Now would be best.
Father.
I'm awfully sorry, Father.
I'll be better. I promise you, truly.
I'm sure you will be.
We won't talk about it anymore.
Thank you, Father.
You know, Winston... the world of politics can be very difficult sometimes.
And I have my share of problems these days.
The things I do are misjudged.
Things I say are often distorted.
Perhaps that's why
I'm so often bad-tempered.
Oh, no, Father. You're a great man.
Everyone knows that.
Everyone knows Lord Salisbury treated you very badly.
And you'll show him.
All of them.
Thank you.
Thank you, my boy.
Anyway, I think... older people aren't always particularly considerate to younger people, to children.
They forget what it was like when they were children.
And sometimes, when they're bad-tempered, they speak more harshly than they think they are or mean to.
Yes, I know, Father.
Well, I think there have been times when I have done that.
Perhaps this morning.
But I would never... wish you to feel that I don't care for you very much.
Because I do.
Thank you, Papa.
I mean, Father.
I say, Winston, your collection has become most impressive, hasn't it?
You're rather short of artillery, aren't you?
Yes, Father.
Only five field guns.
Yes, well. Now, that's not really...
It was one of the three or four long, intimate conversations with him which are all I can boast.
He spok e in the most wonderful and captivating manner.
Then when he inspected my troops, he displayed such a knowledge of military affairs that it would have astounded me had I not already been aware of his breadth of mind.
Winston.
When you grow up, would you like to go into the army?
Would you like me to, Father?
No, it's what you would like that counts.
Well...
I'm awfully good at history.
Especially about wars and battles and generals and...
Yes, Father,
I'd like to very much.
Very much.
Good.
We'll talk about that again later.
There's an army class at Harrow, isn't there?
I'll have a chat with Welldon, see what he thinks.
Yes.
Goodbye, Winston.
Goodbye, Father.
Womany.
Womany!
What is it, for heaven's sake?
Father talked to me for the longest time.
And he was so kind.
And I'm going into the army!
The army?
The army?
He's our son, but we mustn't blind ourselves, must we?
He's no scholar.
Can you imagine him qualifying for the bar or cutting any kind of figure in politics?
So unless you see him in the church...
You see, the army's all that's left. I think it's an inspiration.
We have to get him into Sandhurst.
And that, of course, means passing the examination.
The army.
Well, that's three or four years off, anyway, isn't it?
Unfortunately, it took not one, but three examinations to get me into Sandhurst.
Come in.
Did my letter come, Father?
I've been accepted.
I passed.
You seem very pleased with yourself, Winston.
I'm afraid I don't share your satisfaction.
But I passed.
Yes, you passed.
There are two ways of passing an examination, Winston, one that does you credit and one that does not.
As usual, you have chosen the latter.
Seventh from the bottom of the entire class.
But I did pass.
Yes. You passed... but you failed to get into the infantry.
You merely scraped into the cavalry, which everybody knows is the mark of a third-rate pass.
Now, that will cost me an extra...
200 pounds a year to get you a horse.
And this after all the months of cramming, and all the trouble I went to with the duke of Cambridge to get you into 60th Rifles, one of the finest regiments in the British army.
But I only failed the infantry by 18 marks, Father.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You are sorry?
Winston, how many times have I heard that word from you before?
You've had every possible advantage.
Your mother and I have done everything possible to make life easy for you.
Remember how you behaved at Eton?
Eton? You mean at Harrow...
Your reports. They've been nothing but an embarrassment to me.
"Untidy, slovenly, bad, lazy".
You're my greatest disappointment.
You lie, you shirk, you boast!
You care nothing for anyone but yourself, Winston.
Ever since you were a child, you've been... a problem to me.
Nothing but trouble and heartache.
What's to become of you, boy?
No, you're no longer a boy, you're 20. You'll be 21...
No, Father, I... I'm 19.
Don't interrupt me, Winston, please!
Winston... if you do not change your ways at Sandhurst... if you do not face up to your responsibilities like a man... if you don't buckle down, Winston...
I can accept no further responsibility for you after your 21 st birthday.
If you don't change... you'll become just another... public-school failure, social wastrel... living out a shabby and a miserable life to the end of your days.
Do you understand me,
Winston?
Yes, Father.
Nevertheless, once I became a gentleman cadet,
I acquired a new status in my father's eyes.
And, when I was on leave,
I was sometimes allowed to go about with him.
I dearly loved these outings.
I had no idea that he had less than 18 months to live.
Lord Randolph.
General.
Good afternoon, sir.
This your boy?
Yes. Winston.
Winston, you have the privilege of meeting
General Bindon Blood.
How do you do, sir.
Sandhurst, eh?
Good, good.
See you in India one day, right?
I hope so, sir.
I'd like to serve under you someday, sir.
I mean, in the field, sir.
You like a bit of gunpowder, do you? Good, good.
Well, young fellow, you do well at Sandhurst... and if ever there's another war, which I doubt, worst luck...
I'll find a place for you.
I give you my word.
Ambition's a good thing in a young man, Winston, but one mustn't be too pushy, you know?
Yes, Father.
Hello, Joe.
Randolph.
I was going to write to congratulate you on this young man's maiden speech.
Excellent, Austen. Made a fine impression on the House.
Thank you, sir.
You should be very proud of him, Joe.
Yes, I thought it was a reasonable effort.
You've grown, Winston.
Be an officer soon, eh?
Hope so, sir.
Hmm.
Father, I... I've been thinking.
Yes?
Arthur Balfour is
Lord Salisbury's nephew.
They're very close, and he helps Lord Salisbury a lot.
And now that Austen
Chamberlain's an MP, he must be a great help to his father.
I was just wondering...
I mean, when I have some leave, couldn't I help your secretary?
I mean, you were your father's secretary for a while and...
They fancy Rosebery's gelding in this race.
He's a handsome-enough fellow.
The breeding's there, but there's something lacking in the stamina.
You know?
Character.
No, I don't see him winning the race.
It was not... so long ago...
Excuse me. in terms of the calendar...
Excuse me. Hello. honourable members...
Hello, how are you? may recall I made... a previous statement.
A previous statement... made by me... on a previous occasion... honourable members may recall.
And so I repeat... if I may... on that...
On that o...
On that o... Occasion...
On that occasion... honourable members may recall I...
Her Majesty's government...
Her Majesty's government... are spending huge amounts of money... on army and naval operations.
They are doing so...
They are...
They are doing so without regard to the pledges they made to the country.
Without regard.
They are doing so... without regard to the pledges they made to the country.
Without regard... to the will or voice of parliament.
That's what I said.
Must have... had a reason.
Come along, old friend.
He was only 46.
Had he lived another four or five years, he could not have done without me.
But all my dreams of comradeship with him, of entering parliament at his side and in his support... were ended.
We buried him near Blenheim... where both he and I were born.
His friend Lord Rosebery wrote of him:
"He was human, eminently human... full of faults, as he himself knew.
But not base or unpardonable faults.
Pugnacious, outrageous... fitful, petulant... but eminently lovable and winning".
Not a bad epitaph, at that.
Nor one I should mind having for myself.
Now, there remained for me... only to pursue his aims, and vindicate his memory.
Parade... present arms!
Colour parties, halt!
Parade... shoulder arms!
I passed out of Sandhurst with honours.
Eighth out of 150.
I mention this only because it shows that I could learn quickly enough the things that mattered.
Victoria, by the grace of God,
Queen, Sefender of the Faith,
Empress of India... to our trusty and well-beloved
Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, gentleman, greeting.
We, reposing a special trust and confidence in your loyalty, courage and good conduct, constitute and appoint you to be an officer in our land forces with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant.
Four months later...
I lost the one person who had never failed me.
Elizabeth. Elizabeth it's Winston.
Do come in.
Winston.
What a good boy you are... to come and see your old Everest.
You've grown.
It's the army.
Do you think they'd take me?
I'm afraid I'm not much good anymore.
Oh, you'll get better,
Womany. You'll see.
I was thinking this afternoon about your father.
Do you know what he did?
When I retired,
I gave him my savings... and he made a special trip to the city... to talk to Lord Rothschild about investing them for me.
Now, wasn't that kind?
And he, with so many cares of his own.
Oh, they were cruel to him.
Lord Salisbury... that Arthur Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain.
Supposed to be his friends.
Broke his heart.
You're wet.
You're soaked through.
It's raining.
You came in the rain? You must take that off. You'll catch cold.
No. It's all right.
No, no. You must take that jacket off and you must dry it.
Please, dearie.
All right, Womany.
In just a moment.
Your boots aren't damp, are they?
No. No, they're dry.
Oh, good.
It's what gives you toothache, you know.
Sitting in damp boots.
I know.
Are you enjoying the cavalry, dearie?
Very much, Womany.
Very much.
Next! Arms up.
Next!
Arms up. Next!
Walk on!
Outward turn.
Both rides outward circle!
Sit up! Look up!
Two. Forward.
One.
Back to your riding position.
One! Two!
Three! Four!
And one! And two!
And three! And four!
Down the centre.
Walk on.
Come along, Mr. Churchill, sir.
You'll have to do better if you want to go to India.
"Mother, darling, India has nothing more to offer me.
And now that you, unfortunately, have lost most of our money in that American stockmark et swindle,
I really must go to the Sudan with Kitchener.
I could write another book or sell some articles.
So, please, please, talk to everyone you can.
By the way, I have met the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.
Her name is Pamela Plowden.
We are going to do a tour of Hyderabad tomorrow on an elephant.
You have to ride on an elephant because if you walk about, the natives have a habit of spitting at you and crowding you into the gutter.
Mother, darling, you won't forget about Kitchener, will you?"
"Sarling, as you ask ed,
I have written to General Kitchener, and I should be getting his reply soon.
You will be pleased to learn, I know, that the Prince of Wales is reading your book".
I cannot resist writing you these two lines to congratulate you on the success of your book.
Everyone is reading it.
But your dear mother tells me you are thinking of resigning your commission and standing for parliament.
I hope you will not do so.
You have plenty of time before you... to mak e your name and your friends in the army.
And now to Sir Ian Hamilton,
Lord Roberts, Lord Curzon,
Sir Evelyn Wood,
Lord Cromer, the Prince of Wales, the prime minister and Lady Randolph Churchill.
Say that I insist on the privilege of selecting my own officers.
Say, as I've already said not once but many times before,
I have no room for Churchill. None!
Say that...
Just arrived, sir.
Say that time grows short and I have a great many more important things to think about and that the matter is closed finally, definitely and forever.
And I don't want to hear any more about it.
You'll... You'll dress it up, of course.
Certainly, sir.
Lady Randolph Churchill, widow of
Lord Randolph Churchill, formerly Miss Jennie Jerome of New York and Paris.
You play, if I may say so,
Lady Randolph, most beautifully.
It has been said that you could appear on the concert stage if you desired. And you've given us ample proof of that skill.
Thank you.
It has also been said, no doubt with malice, that you interest yourself a great deal in your son Winston's affairs... and in his advancement.
But I should be a most unnatural mother if I didn't.
Of course.
But there are those who find an interesting contrast between your efforts on his behalf now and your neglect of him when he was a child.
Neglect?
But that was never the case.
That is vicious and hurtful.
My son never lacked a mother's love.
Naturally, when he was a child, he went off to school. The very best of schools.
At home, he had my attention and a marvellous nanny who was with us almost from the time he was born.
Naturally, I was at the same time devoted to my husband's career, as any wife would be.
I see.
You do, on occasion, entertain or act as hostess for the Prince of Wales.
His Royal Highness finds you charming, gracious, amusing.
You are at liberty to think so.
But if you are insinuating the slightest impropriety...
Not at all, dear lady. Not at all.
Please be calm.
I am perfectly calm.
Then we can proceed.
You are aware, of course, that your name has been linked with another royal personage...
Count Charles Kinsky, the well-known sportsman.
I don't know what you mean by "linked".
We are friends.
We have been friends for many years.
Yes, friends.
Exactly.
Friends. Yet, at one time, there was gossip, malicious, of course, that your marriage to Lord Randolph was, shall we say, pro forma.
And that in the event of a divorce, you and Count...
There was never a possibility of divorce.
But you and Count Kinsky are still friends?
Yes.
Charles was married shortly before my husband died.
Three weeks before, in his own country, in Austria.
He has remained there ever since.
He has great responsibilities there.
One last question.
What precisely was the nature of your husband's last illness?
It is well-known.
It was caused by overwork.
Ah, yes. But the symptoms were most curious, were they not?
I don't know what you mean.
But surely you were aware of your husband's symptoms?
I think this has gone far enough.
But this is of great interest to the public.
Is it? Why should it be?
Why should it be of any concern to what you call the public?
The public is everyone.
And the public has a right to know.
Why? What right?
I don't know anything about such a right.
I only know about the right to some decent privacy!
Oh, come, come, Lady Randolph.
We live in modern times.
Surely the word " syphilis" need hold no terrors for us.
Are you content?
Have you heard?
We've had a death.
Young Chapman.
21 st Lancers.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Pity. Just when he was going out to the Sudan too.
Yes.
So we have a vacancy, don't we?
Yes. You know,
I was wondering.
What?
What about young Churchill?
Are you mad?
Well, why not?
Well, firstly, if the general twigged, he'd have our balls for breakfast.
And secondly, why?
Surely you don't have any use for that little publicity hunter.
None at all.
But his mother's a smasher.
Yes, I know.
I say, you dog.
Do you know her?
No.
But I'd give anything to meet her.
So, come on, what do you say, hmm?
There's not a chance in the world the old boy will ever...
War office to
Lieutenant Churchill:
"You will proceed to the 21 st Lancers at your own expense.
In the event of injury to yourself or your horse, no charge will be made against army funds.
Sign here, please.
Three copies".
"I say, Churchill, we at the
Psychical Research Society have an interesting experiment in mind... which, as a journalist, should interest you too.
If you should, unfortunately, get killed will you try to communicate with us?"
Forward, halt!
Uh, Chapman!
I say, Chapman?
Chapman, are you deaf?
Oh, sorry, sir.
It's Churchill, sir.
Oh, yes, of course, Churchill.
Chapman's the one who's dead.
Hmm. Sorry about that.
What condition's your horse in?
First-rate. Not tired, if that's that you mean.
Oh, good. Now, you're the one who wants to see a show, aren't you?
Report up forward to Colonel
Martin. He'll tell you what to do.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, and Chapman...
I mean, Churchill my compliments to the colonel.
Yes, of course, sir.
Sir. Lieutenant
Chapman re... Churchill.
Sorry, sir. Um...
Lieutenant Churchill reporting from Major Finn, sir.
Come with me.
Sir.
Your horse reasonably fit?
Yes, sir.
I've a message I want you to deliver.
But I want you to see the situation for yourself so that you can describe what you've seen.
Sir.
Now, our estimate is something approaching close on 60,000.
Though it may not seem like it, they're coming on pretty fast.
I want you to report on what
I've told you and what you've seen personally to General Kitchener.
Oh, God!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean, yes, sir.
You all right, Chapman?
Yes, sir.
What do I say?
"Lieutenant Churchill reporting to
General Kitchener"? He'll kill me!
He'll send me home.
He'll have me court-martialled.
He'll skin me alive before the entire army.
I'll be ruined.
Oh, my God!
Oh, well. I died for my country.
Sir, I come with a report from the 21 st Lancers.
The Dervish army is advancing... between yourself and the city of Omdurman.
Colonel Martin estimates their strength in the region of 60,000.
I saw them 40 minutes ago.
They're moving rapidly.
They're moving rapidly, you say?
Yes, sir.
How long do you think I've got?
I would say an hour, sir.
Possibly an hour and a half.
An hour and a half should be about right.
I hope.
Fire!
They're breaking, sir!
They're breaking!
Suring the mopping-up operations the next day,
I took part in what was destined to become the last full charge ever of British cavalry.
Sound the trot.
Sound troop to the right.
Sound the charge!
Charge!
Charge!
Charge!
Bloody hell!
Mr. Winston Churchill war correspondent, author, recently resigned from the army and candidate for parliament for Oldham at the age of 23.
Twenty-four, actually.
In November.
Thank you,
Mr. Churchill.
There is gossip that you were detested in the army... where it is said you were known as a medal hunter, a publicity seeker and a social climber... pushing, aggressive and scheming.
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
I was wondering why a certain kind of person always seems to believe the worst about me.
At Sandhurst, for example,
I was accused of being everything from a horse thief to a homosexual.
And I had to sue for libel, and win, to prove my innocence on both counts.
As to what you have just said,
I'm sorry to hear it.
I thought I had served my country faithfully... at some danger to myself.
Yes.
Some officers have stated that your criticism of General Kitchener in your new book, The River War, was inexcusable.
Have you read the book?
No.
Then perhaps you should read it.
My statements concerning his atrocious treatment of enemy wounded were entirely factual.
As to our victory, although the enemy had superior numbers, they were no match for a modern army.
I see.
Your father also had a weakness for offending people, did he not?
I wouldn't call it a weakness.
I would describe it as his strength.
And I would attribute it to the strength of his convictions.
My father was a brilliant man.
He had no time for fools.
Yes. Actually, you were not very well acquainted with your father, were you?
Not as well as I should have liked to have been.
However, solitary trees... if they grow at all, grow strong.
Indeed.
Something you've read?
No. Something
I have written.
In my new book,
The River War.
You really should read it.
There are some good things in it.
Reverting to your father's enemies, do you imagine they will welcome you into politics?
I don't know what you mean by "enemies".
Oh, come now! Lord Salisbury, who kept him out of government.
Mr. Balfour, who supported
Lord Salisbury. Mr. Chamberlain, who destroyed your father's last chance of returning to power.
And the others.
They were never enemies.
They may have disagreed at times but that's the nature of politics, isn't it?
Lord Salisbury has been very kind to me.
I dedicated my book to him.
Then you feel you have no cause to fight for in your father's name?
No wrong to right?
No vendetta to keep alive?
Vendetta?
That's an Italian word, isn't it?
Nothing like that in England, is there?
Why are you so friendly with David Lloyd George, who is a Liberal?
I like people.
People who can help you?
A young man starting out in life needs help.
But don't you think in these times, politics has little room for wealthy and privileged young men?
I am not wealthy.
I live on what I earn.
And I support my mother and my younger brother.
But why exactly do you wish to stand for parliament, Mr. Churchill?
To serve my country.
And to advance yourself?
Yes. Is there anything wrong in that?
Is there anything right in it?
Who are you to aspire to the greatest parliament in the world?
What do you have to offer, other than your ego and your ambitions?
Only myself.
I believe in myself.
I believe in my destiny.
Really?
Have you consulted a fortune-teller recently?
As a matter of fact, I have.
She agrees with me.
Is it a crime to be 24?
No, no. Not at all.
What would you like me to do? Play games?
Be seen but not heard?
Close my eyes and ears?
Be a child forever?
Must we always be ruled by old men?
Doesn't every old man in politics betray the wonderful things he believed in when he was young?
And by doing that betray his country?
I think there is room for a young man... many young men, in government.
If I could, I would say this to young men all over the world:
" Come on. You are needed more than ever now.
You must take your places in life's fighting line.
Twenty to 25, those are the years.
Don't be content with things as they are.
Yes, you will make mistakes.
But as long as you are generous and true, you cannot hurt the world.
Nor even seriously distress her.
She was made to be wooed and won by youth.
She has lived and thrived only by repeated subjugations".
Well...
Something else you have written?
No.
No, it's something
I'm going to write, I think.
Really?
In your autobiography, no doubt.
Yes.
Yes, I think I will write an autobiography someday.
I think I'll have something to write about.
Yes. Well...
The Oldham Evening Chronicle:
"Young Mr. Winston Churchill's first attempt to enter politics has met with defeat.
He has left for South Africa as a correspondent to write about our war with the Boers".
In South Africa,
I had the good luck to encounter a Captain Aylmer Haldane, whom I had met in India, and who had befriended me there.
He invited me to go out on a reconnaissance with him in an armoured train.
Going back?
This is as far as our orders take us.
Seems quiet enough.
Let's go and have a spot of breakfast, shall we?
You know, Haldane,
I've been thinking.
After the Malakand Field Force,
I went on to the Tirah expedition.
Do you remember?
Yes.
Well, I never did get my medal for that.
Now, if you were to write to the war office...
A medal for the Tirah?
Winston, don't you ever relax?
I can't. I'm almost 25.
Down!
Look out!
On the left!
Carry on, sarge!
Enemy left!
Steady now, lads. Take aim.
Take aim! Good.
Brakes!
Come on, lads.
On your feet!
Take it easy.
Get up! Take posts!
Haldane, we're off the rails!
Shall I go up front and see what I can do?
Good idea!
Set up, boys!
On target.
Shoot!
Hey, where are you going?
I'm a civilian.
I don't get paid for being shot at!
Come back here!
Come here! Listen!
Let go!
Listen! You've got more chance of being hit if you run. Now listen to me, I'm a soldier.
No one ever gets shot twice on the same day. That's a fact.
Now you get back in there!
It's the safest place there is.
And when this is over, you'll get a medal.
That's a promise.
Come on! I'll go with you.
Can this engine still run?
Well, it might.
But the track's blocked, we can't move. Unless we get uncoupled from that truck in front of us.
Come on, get in.
And get it over on its side.
I see.
And there's no way of doing that.
We can try.
Is there an officer here?
Yes! What is it?
We have to uncouple that truck there and push it over on its side!
Sergeant, bring a dozen men.
Very good, sir!
Who was that? A Boer?
Worse than that.
He's crazy!
Come on. Give him a hand.
Heave it up from underneath.
Right.
It's moving.
Come on! Out you come!
Outside!
Come on, that's it, lads!
Move it now! Move it! Come on!
You men, over here!
Right, come on.
Get your shoulders under here.
Come on, men!
Come on down!
Come on, there!
Heave!
Come on! Heave!
Heave!
Hold it!
Keep it up!
Hold it up!
Heave!
Get it up, men!
Heave!
Push it!
Right, take cover!
Come on!
Did it, by God!
You didn't get it off the track.
You said all we had to do was get it uncoupled and push it over.
It was too heavy to get off the track.
Well, I'll have to ram it off now.
Well, ram it off!
I don't know if the engine'll run.
Well, try it!
Good. Now, go ahead.
I'll have to back her up first.
Well, then bloody well back her up, you idiot!
Well, you don't have to get excited.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Right. Now, go ahead.
And you keep shovelling.
Yes, sir.
We could go off the rails, you know.
Go on!
Here.
Sorry...
But go on!
Oh, Christ!
Haldane!
Haldane!
Move, fusilier!
Move, move, move!
The track up ahead's clear, but we can't get back to you.
And anyway, the couplings are smashed.
Yes, I know.
I know, I know.
Can we load the wounded onto the engine?
Yes.
Well, that's something, I suppose.
The rest of us have to go on foot.
Thanks very much,
Winston. I'll remember this.
So shall I.
Wounded onto...
Onto the engine!
The rest of us go on foot, using it as cover.
Come on, everyone out now!
Wounded on the engine!
Get the wounded onto the engine!
Come on, move it on! Move it on!
Easy, easy!
Move around!
Move around!
All right?
I think so.
All right, go ahead!
Go ahead!
As slow as you can.
Slow down, Winston!
Slow down.
Slow down!
You're getting ahead of them.
It's all right. All right.
Winston!
Slower!
Slow down, you damn fool!
For God's sake, Winston!
Hey, slow down.
Oh, shut up!
Slow down, you damned idiot!
I can't, you silly arse.
We're on the downgrade.
I'll kill you!
I can't help it.
The brakes are gone.
Now what?
I must go back and get Haldane.
What, back there?
What do I do?
You wait!
You wait ten minutes. And then if you don't see us coming, you can go.
Pretoria.
"We have captured Lord Churchill, who claims to be a war correspondent.
But from our intelligence, we know he was responsible for one part of the armoured train getting away".
Sir, I am a special correspondent.
I was unarmed, and I took no part in the fighting when I was captured.
I respectfully submit that I should be released as soon as possible.
On no account is he to be released, for the duration of the war.
I've been watching you two.
You're working on an escape.
You're out of your mind.
I am not.
But I will be if you won't take me with you.
Never.
Be quiet, Brockie.
We can't use you,
Winston.
You don't know the country or the language.
If we got separated, you wouldn't have a chance.
Anyway, you'd be the first to be missed from here.
Play.
Haldane, I'm going mad in here.
And tomorrow's my birthday.
Congratulations.
Oh, shut up. You don't understand.
I'll be 25.
I can't stay cooped up in here for the rest of the war.
Please, Haldane.
You said you'd remember what I did that day.
Do you remember now?
I wouldn't have been caught if I hadn't gone back for you.
No.
Do shut up, Brockie.
I can't think.
What's for dinner tonight?
Any idea?
They're too close.
You're afraid.
Well, see for yourself.
I'll go and look too.
No, no, wait...
It was maddening.
And besides, normally there was only one guard on duty here.
The thought crossed my mind that we were suspected.
Suddenly, I felt it was now or never.
And the impulse was too overpowering to resist.
But how was I to inform my comrades?
Then I heard a heavenly sound.
Psst.
Who's there?
It's Churchill. Keep quiet.
Churchill? Where are you?
What are you doing out there?
Never mind.
Just go and tell Haldane and Brockie right away.
Oh, I get it. Good show!
London, The Morning Post.
"Our special correspondent,
Winston Churchill who distinguished himself before his capture has, in a fashion as yet undisclosed, escaped".
Johannesburg.
" A reward of 25 pounds is offered for the capture of Winston Churchill.
Sead or alive".
Pretoria.
" Although Mr. Churchill's escape was cleverly executed, there is little chance of his being able to cross the border.
When he is recaptured, it is probable that he will be shot".
My name is Dr. Bentinck.
I've had an accident.
Now, what did you say?
Are you English?
Never mind.
What do you want?
Oh, I've had an accident. I...
I fell off a train.
Well, the truth is,
I'm afraid I'm lost.
All right.
Come in.
Now, then,
I think you'd better tell me the real truth.
I think so too.
My name is Winston Churchill.
The correspondent from The Morning Post.
I escaped from Pretoria last night, and I'm making for the border.
I have 75 pounds.
Will you help me?
By God, it's lucky you came here.
Only house for 20 miles where you wouldn't be handed in.
My name's Howard.
I'm British.
I'm the manager of this mine.
There are three more of us keeping the place going.
The Boers keep an eye on us.
There were some here this afternoon.
Looking for you.
Well, then, perhaps I'd better go.
Nonsense.
We'll just have to be extremely careful.
Have a drink,
Mr. Churchill.
Thank you,
Mr. Howard.
This is our engine man,
Mr. Dewsnap.
Stay with him for a moment while I get the food and blankets.
Are the others ready?
Waiting down below, sir.
I know who you are.
You're young
Winston-bloody-Churchill.
Don't worry.
I'm from Oldham, you see.
Me wife writes to me regular.
She told me how you got beat at last election.
Don't worry, lad.
You'll get all their votes next time.
Right. Come on, now.
Watch your step here.
Don't trip over the tracks.
Round the other side.
I couldn't bring much food.
The housemaids are all Boers.
Can't take the risk.
Take one of these, lad.
Ever been down a coalmine before?
I think you'll find it an experience.
Not very comfortable,
I'm afraid.
But you mustn't move away from here, whatever happens.
I'll try to bring you more food tomorrow. You'll be all right, won't you?
Of course. It's very cosy.
Just like home.
Well, Mr. Howard, gentlemen, thank you very much.
Our pleasure.
You've been shamefully careless with this watch, Winston.
The repair bill was very expensive.
If you can't tak e proper care of a fine watch, you don't deserve to have one.
Yes, Father.
I remained underground for three days and nights, while the brave Mr. Howard planned how to spirit me across the border to Portuguese East Africa, from whence I could tak e ship to British territory.
Thank you,
Mr. Dewsnap.
Pretoria.
"Mr. Winston Churchill has given himself up".
Johannesburg.
"It is announced here that Winston
Churchill has been recaptured, dressed as a woman".
Pretoria.
" Although Mr. Churchill is still at liberty, there is no doubt that he will soon be a prisoner again".
Johannesburg.
"It is reported that Mr. Churchill has been captured, disguised as a policeman".
Rome. "So far as is known
Mr. Winston Churchill is still at liberty.
The entire world watches the progress of his escape".
Paris. "There is no confirmation that Mr. Churchill has been captured.
At the same time, however, no one knows his whereabouts, or if he is alive and well".
I was not yet aware that I had leapt from a latrine into world celebrity.
London.
"Young Mr. Winston Churchill continues to give the Boers a run for their money.
Everyone in Britain is cheering him on".
New York.
"Winston Churchill, who is American on his mother's side, is still free.
The whole world is praying for him".
I'm free!
I'm free!
I'm Winston-bloody-Churchill!
And I'm free!
Ladies and gentlemen... a man who, after his daring escape, rejoined the army of his country, distinguished himself again and again in battle... helped to free his fellow officers from the very same prison he escaped from.
I give you...
Ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen of Oldham.
Friends.
I promised
Mr. Daniel Dewsnap, without whose wonderful help
I should not be here tonight... that the first time
I returned to Oldham,
I would give his love to his wife.
She's here!
She's right there!
And thus, at my second attempt, the Tory electors of Oldham sent me victorious into the mother of parliaments.
The Times.
"In raising his amendment against the government's bill on military expenditure, young Mr. Winston Churchill in his first major speech seems bent, after one short and promising year in the House on repeating the most disastrous mistak e of his father's career".
I don't understand.
I wish I could understand.
Does it really matter?
Yes, it does matter.
It matters very much to me.
I never understood your father when he did what he did, throwing his life away.
And now you're doing the same thing.
Only this time, I know in advance.
You're being dramatic.
I'm not throwing my life away.
But you are, my darling.
Everything you've worked so hard for.
I've had a note from Arthur Balfour.
No, thank you.
He says the prime minister's very angry with you.
Winston, you can't attack the three most important men in your party, in the government, and think that they'll forgive and forget.
You'll be finished after tonight.
We'll see.
Oh, Winston.
It isn't Pamela, is it? Because...
Pamela?
No, of course not.
Of course I loved Pamela.
Still do.
I'll never love another woman.
But she had every right and reason to marry an earl.
A " belted" earl, as you Americans say.
I do wish you weren't so friendly with Lloyd George. Such an odious little man.
He has the most annoying way of looking at women.
I'm sorry, darling, I must go.
Sign for me, will you, please?
Winston... for my sake.
I'm begging you.
Don't move your amendment.
Don't speak tonight.
Please.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Are you prepared to face these savage beasts who even now are lying in wait for you?
As prepared as I'll ever be.
Excuse me, sir.
Oh, I'll deal with this, Mother.
I intend to escort your son to the arena.
You're very kind.
Winston speaks of you often.
Oh, we are great friends,
I trust, despite our political differences.
Your presence in the House tonight makes it a special occasion.
I am sure it will inspire all the speakers.
And are you speaking tonight?
No, no. I shall be listening with great interest to your son.
Well, now, Winston,
I said I would escort you, so let us go.
I hope one day to escort him to the other side of the floor.
Heaven forbid.
Lovely lady, your mother.
Has she talked you out of it?
No.
He'll have your head. Lord Salisbury never forgets, as you should know.
Well, there'll always be room for you in the Liberal Party.
Why don't you quit the Tories and come over to us?
Never.
Good luck.
Excuse me.
... to a thorough sweeping and almost revolutionary reconstruction of the army, we have failed to rise to the hopes of the country.
Hear, hear.
Is there any competent authority who really believes that the right honourable gentleman has made the best of his opportunities?
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
Hear, hear!
Mr. Churchill.
Mr. Speaker...
I stand here tonight to plead the cause of economy.
It may be, at some other time and under other circumstances
I may take a directly opposite position.
But tonight, I speak on behalf of military economy and retrenchment.
Hear, hear!
The secretary of state for war is asking... indeed demanding... a great deal of money.
I do not think he should have it.
I say it humbly, but with, I hope, becoming pride, no one has a better right to this position than I have.
For it is a cause
I have inherited.
And it is a cause for which the late Lord Randolph Churchill made the greatest sacrifice of any minister of modern times.
I am glad the House has allowed me... after an interval of 15 years... to lift again the tattered flag that I found lying on a stricken field.
It is quite recent history.
Lord Randolph was chancellor of the exchequer.
Lord Salisbury was prime minister.
As he is now.
And on this same issue of economy
Lord Randolph Churchill went down.
Forever.
But wise words, sir... stand the test of time.
And his words were wise.
I have frequently been surprised since I have been in this House to hear with what composure and how glibly members and even ministers... talk of a European war.
I say, sir, we must not regard modern war as a kind of game in which we may take a hand and with good luck and good management play adroitly for an evening.
And when we have had enough, come safely home with our winnings.
Hear, hear!
Oh, no, sir.
It is no longer a game.
A European war... cannot be anything but a cruel and heart-rending struggle which, if we are ever to enjoy the bitter fruits of victory must demand, perhaps for years the whole manhood of the nation, the entire suspension of peaceful industries, and the concentrating to only one end of every vital agency in the community.
Hear, hear!
Ah, yes.
It may be that the human race is doomed never to learn from its mistakes.
We are the only animals on this globe who periodically set out to slaughter each other for the best, the noblest, the most inescapable of reasons.
We know better, but we do it again and again, in generation after generation.
It may be that our empire too, is doomed like all those that have gone before it to continue to spill and waste its best blood on foreign soil no matter what we say or do in this place, or think or believe or have learned from history.
But thank God for us there is still such a thing as moral force.
And in spite of every calumny and lie, it is known that upon the whole...
And it is upon the whole that such things must be judged.
...British influence is a healthy and a kindly influence.
And so I say, sir... at this particular moment in history, we would make a fatal bargain if we allow the moral force which this country has for so long exerted to become diminished, or perhaps destroyed for the sake of the costly, trumpery... dangerous military playthings upon which the secretary of state for war has set his heart.
Hear, hear!
Hear, hear!
Hear, hear!
The Times.
"Mr. Winston Churchill's outburst brought forth some cheers but not, it should be noted, from his own party".
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
The Morning Post, London.
"Mr. Winston Churchill, last night served notice that there is a young lion loose in the House and the lion has sharp claws".
Well, well. Hmm.
I deeply suspect what you've done tonight, and yet...
I have to believe you were completely sincere.
And very brave.
You know, Churchill... you're a child of your class, and you may never outgrow it.
But you've got something.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I looked for you.
But when I couldn't find you...
I thought you might be here.
Well...
You think I still have a career?
We shall have to wait and see, won't we?
Hmm.
How do you feel?
Tired.
Tired but free.
It's odd. I feel free.
Sorry, darling, a brandy?
No.
I don't know.
It's like when I escaped.
When I first knew
I was really free.
It's odd.
Oh, Mother...
I saw a girl tonight.
Tall, fair-haired.
Rather lovely,
I thought.
Dressed in pale yellow,
I think.
You didn't see anyone like that in the gallery, did you?
Yes.
There was one young woman who more or less fits that description.
Oh?
Well, you know everyone.
You wouldn't...?
Well, yes.
As a matter of fact, I do.
You must mean
Clementine Hozier.
Your Uncle Jack Leslie almost dropped her in the font when she was christened.
Oh.
Did he, now?
Yes.
It was an end... and a beginning.
My darling mother continued on her headlong, headstrong, but always gallant and courageous way whilst, seven years later,
Clementine Hozier and I were married... and lived happily ever afterwards.
Deep in the heart of the Aegean Sea lies the island of Navarone.
In 1943, it stood poised like a knife in the Allied side.
Secretly designed giant radar-controlled guns...
...anchored in the bowels of the ancient rock...
...gave the German High Command total strategic control.
Frequent Allied air and sea attacks resulted in total failure.
In desperation, the Allies turned to a small band of commandos...
...led by Major Mallory and demolitions expert Corporal Miller .
They succeeded in penetrating the very heart of the gun complex...
...planted high explosives at the base of the giant shell hoists...
...and then escaped to await rescue by ships of the British navy.
- Reduce speed, number one.
- Aye, aye, sir. Down 50 revs.
Fire.
Fire.
Mallory, Miller, good to have you aboard.
We thought for a moment we'd left you on Navarone.
Move! Move!
Come on, move it!
Move it!
Move it, move it, move it!
Regulations state, sir, that in the absence of bacon, ham, et cetera...
...the acting catering officer, that's you, sir...
...shall authorize once per week, the issue of offal.
- Offal?
- Offal, sir...
-...is kidneys, liver, tongue, brains...
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Milly, how nice to see you.
- Hello, sir.
- Whatever are you doing here?
- I've no idea.
I'm reporting to Commander Jensen.
I gather you've been hurling yourself over the White Cliffs. How's the leg?
It's in the same place. I thought they pensioned you off for good.
You still peddling those whizbangs of yours?
Yes, we've got things that go boom for all occasions.
I'm working with a new detonator.
It's interesting--
Excuse me, sir. We can't keep
Commander Jensen waiting.
- We'll have a quiet pint later on.
- He'd like to see you too, sir, together.
Corporal, put that in my office, will you?
Mallory.
Take a pew. How's the leg?
- And Miller, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Hear you've been attached to Winston's toy shop.
"Department of Dirty Tricks," as the Whitehall chaps call it.
Well, they speak very well of you.
We need you chaps for something rather special.
I'm afraid it's not exactly a masterpiece...
...but I wonder if you can identify this fellow.
Think back to Navarone.
I'd rather not, sir.
Nicolai?
Yes. Let you down a bit, didn't he?
But what about him?
Andreas' people had him shot as a traitor, didn't they?
Yes, so we were told.
In fact, he escaped.
He wasn't a traitor.
He was a German agent...
...who we believe is operating now in Yugoslavia with the Partisans...
...posing as one Captain Lescovar.
Now, you both knew Nicolai.
In fact, you're the only people we know of can make a positive identification.
So I'd like you to go out there and cope.
Cope, sir?
Kill him.
Discreetly, if possible.
But I'm a civilian now, sir.
Yes, we thought about that.
So you've been recalled to the current and promoted.
Staff sergeant.
Awfully generous, sir.
Exactly how do we get there?
We're tacking you onto Force 10.
The code name for an operation for the Allied mission in Yugoslavia.
Excuse me, sir.
What's their objective?
It's being treated on a need-to-know basis.
And you don't need to know.
Barnsby, come in.
- Sir?
- Colonel.
Force 10 flies out tonight.
Oh, that's all right.
Taking these boys with you.
I beg your pardon, sir?
It's a matter of transportation.
You've got passengers.
Just a sideshow.
This is Major Mallory, Sergeant Miller.
Lieutenant Colonel Barnsby.
Sir, my mission is all set. It's been planned down to the last detail.
The last thing we need are a couple of passengers.
Major Mallory does have a certain amount of experience.
I wouldn't doubt it.
We're talking about some hard traveling, sir.
We've gotta move fast. My men are young, in top physical shape.
- They're specially trained for this mission.
- I'm aware of that.
Sir, I am concerned about the safety of my command.
Now, these chaps have got a job to do as well.
And it's up to you to deliver them safely to the Partisans.
And you leave for Italy at 2300 hours...
...and you take off for Yugoslavia the following night.
Very well, sir.
Thank you. That's all, gentlemen.
Well, we'll do our best not to make a nuisance of ourselves, colonel.
Sure, you will.
Patch me on to the prime minister's office, please.
Prime Minister?
Force 10 has been activated, sir.
All right, enough!
- Thought we were going to an airfield.
- From what I've observed of Barnsby...
...we might be going to Yugoslavia by walking on water.
All right, it's right along here.
Slow down, Nolan.
Stop it.
Nolan, kill the lights. All right, out.
Oberstein, Reynolds, the fence.
Williams, Farrell, get this crap up to the fence. Come on, move it.
Gonna miss your plane unless you join us now, major.
Pleasant way with words, hasn't he?
Remarkable way of getting on an aircraft, don't you think so?
Oh, well, nothing's ever easy, is it?
It's not easy if you insist on climbing through fences in the dark...
...when there's a perfectly good gate half a mile up the road.
Anything we can do to help?
Yeah, you can keep quiet and out of the way, major.
What's with the fence, Oberstein?
Come on, move.
I don't have a lot of time for explanations.
One thing that you don't know...
...is the last three Allied missions into Yugoslavia...
...were blown right here in Italy.
So this time when we fly out, we're not advertising the fact to anybody.
Come on, you guys, shag your butts.
Hustle, hustle.
Holy Christ, will you look at those guys?
They're stealing half the field.
All right, hold it.
Wait for me.
Okay, men, let's go.
Blake, take care of Rastus there.
All right, fellas, freeze.
And you, back, back. Back off.
Bill, Eddie, get those other guys out of there.
Stay put, you two.
Okay, smart-ass.
- What's your name, kid?
- Walter.
Walter.
What's yours?
Well, it sure in the hell ain't Rastus.
Walter.
Come on, come on.
Come on, you got a stick, you got a stick.
Use it, use it, right now!
Good evening.
Major, move!
Let's get the hell out of here.
- You two guys officers?
- More or less, yes.
We're very much obliged to you, sergeant.
- Weaver.
- Oh, Sergeant Weaver. Thank you.
U .S. Army Medical Corps.
But, sir!
Still some outside, Reynolds.
Come on, shag it, get the lead out.
Come on, damn it.
Hey, sir!
Where's Nolan?
I think you can take it he won't be joining us.
Okay, let's go.
What the hell?
You son of a bitch!
I saved your asses back there...
...and you run out on me.
Hey, who is this guy?
Get out of here.
Don't push! Don't push me!
- Look, you--
- I think it's a bit late for that now.
Look, you just shouldn't have left me there. I saved you bums.
Well, we didn't think you'd like where we're going.
You let me worry about that, huh?
That guy's gonna melt into the landscape.
Well, you are one man short.
Well, Nolan can handle a chute, at least.
- Can you handle a chute?
- I can learn on the job.
That's right, you learn on the way down.
So sorry.
I was rather hoping we'd lost that.
You never know.
It might come in useful.
Hey, hey, what do you got in there?
My pajamas.
Looks like high-explosive pajamas to me.
Not to worry, old boy.
Been handling this since I blew up the nursery with my first chemistry set.
Poor old nanny.
Yugoslavia, dead ahead.
We got company.
Cut two!
Reynolds, bail out!
Jump!
Go!
Come on, move it!
Come on, get out!
Come on, move!
Come on!
Forward.
Forward.
Mallory.
Okay.
- Seen any of the others?
- Not yet. Get down.
Place is crawling with Krauts.
They're coming out of the woodwork.
Yes, aren't they?
Come on.
- Okay, Reynolds?
- Yeah.
- Where's your Sergeant Miller?
- Hanging about, I should think.
How the hell did he get here?
He shoved his way in.
You let him on the plane?
I think he more or less invited himself.
- Where did you learn to use a knife?
- Harvard University, man.
You don't call him "man." You call him "sir," and you call me "sir."
Your ass is mine. You do as you're told.
Is that understood, soldier?
Yes, sir.
We've gotta get out of here before that patrol comes back.
Lieutenant Reynolds, take point.
Sergeant Weaver, bring up the rear.
And everybody keep up.
All right, let's go.
Organized young gentleman, isn't he?
Of all the dumb-ass luck, an AWOL medic and two mystery guests...
...one with a bum leg.
- Any idea where we are, colonel?
- Not a hell of a lot, no.
If we keep going east, we'll end up where we're supposed to.
How did we get stuck with those two clowns?
I don't know, Doug.
Some idiot at British HQ.
Come along, gentlemen.
It's not teatime yet.
Do you think that young man has any idea where we are, Milly?
- No, I shouldn't think so.
- I shouldn't think so, either.
I'll go and try and find out.
Yes, why don't you do that?
Excuse me, colonel.
Do you have any idea where we are?
I've got a good idea where we are.
And how long it's gonna take to get there, if you two can't keep up.
All right, let's move it.
What lovely chaps.
- How do you suppose he hurt that leg?
- I don't give a shit as long as he keeps up.
- This is really beautiful country.
- Yes, marvelous.
Rather like the Scottish Highlands.
- Do you know Scotland?
- No.
Yes. I've often thought that I'd like...
...to settle down there someday.
Looks like you're gonna have to change your plans.
Colonel.
Take it easy.
Don't anybody do anything dumb.
Welcome.
Captain Drazak.
17th Partisan Regiment.
- Good morning, captain.
- Welcome, welcome!
Thank you, Captain Drazak.
They frightened you with bandages, huh?
Without bandages, you:
German, how you say:
You say "flamethrower."
Yeah, yeah, flamethrower.
Hello! Hello!
How do you do?
This is Maritza, good soldier comrade.
How do you do, good soldier comrade?
Hello, blackie.
Maybe it comes off now, Maritza.
Hold it.
Steady, all of you.
Back off, soldier.
I make big joke...
...but joke on me.
Good, blackie. Come, we go.
We eat with our comrades.
We make friends and drink.
Then we fight the Germans.
Come.
Come, we go.
Where did you learn to punch like that? Harvard?
No, Harlem. Colonel?
I'm not trying to get anybody killed, least of all me.
- But that big idiot back there started it.
- Just watch yourself, soldier.
- How's the leg today?
- It's much better, thank you.
Good, good . Well, it looks like things may work out after all, huh?
Well, perhaps Miller and I can still carry out our little sideshow.
Sorry about Force 10.
You're down to two men, aren't you?
Of course, I don't know what your mission was...
...but obviously it just isn't on now, is it, colonel?
Looks rather like your own youngster, doesn't he?
Do you really think so?
My friends, come.
Come, we eat.
We are Chetniks...
...not stinking Partisans.
We hunt Allied commandos like wild pigs!
We work with Germans.
They are our friends.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Major Schroeder, 11th Army Corps.
How do you do, major?
Delighted to meet you.
We thought these people were
Partisans.
Of all the luck, eh, Barnsby?
Sure.
Chetniks? Who would have believed that?
The other three Allied missions that fell into our hands...
...were not quite so happy about it as you appear to be.
I'm not surprised, sir.
But, you see, we're not commandos.
We're deserters.
Deserters?
Give them to me, major.
We kill them now.
You see, we were in a prison camp in Termoli.
We escaped.
Managed to steal a plane.
Flew here, RAF Lancaster.
Were attacked, hit, bailed out and landed in your territory, thank God.
Fascinating.
Tell me, why exactly did you desert?
Now, I'm glad you asked that.
Yes.
Well, I am afraid that is rather a long story.
Oh, please, you must not be afraid of boring me.
Have you ever heard of penicillin?
No.
No? Well, I'm not surprised. It's new.
It's a drug that prevents wounds from becoming infected.
It cures a whole range of infections...
...including some of the nastier social diseases.
It's become one of the most sought-after items on the black market.
Our friend here, Sergeant Weaver of the American Medical Corps...
...was our supplier.
You are saying you stole these drugs from the Army to sell to civilians?
Not just civilians, major.
We'd sell it back to the Army.
Any army.
I see.
Tell me, what has all this to do with that suitcase that you keep looking at?
Well, that suitcase is full of our penicillin.
Oh, indeed. Perhaps
I could see some of it?
Certainly, major.
Open it, Miller.
You can't do that here, you'd ruin the lot.
You know perfectly well that any contamination will destroy it.
It must be opened under laboratory conditions.
There's nearly half a million pounds' worth of stuff here.
I know all that, but the major is not interested in our penicillin.
He only wants to know the truth.
What's the use of a half a million pounds to you out here?
Yes, well, that's beside the point, sir, but I'm not going to open it.
Our story doesn't seem to convince you.
No, it does not.
That's up to you, but every word he's told you is true.
If you don't believe it, check with your intelligence.
They'll verify the entire story.
Oh, I shall certainly verify your story.
Every word of it.
Get in, scum!
Cute story, major, very cute.
Now, what happens when they open the suitcase?
I should think we'll all get shot.
Don't you, colonel?
Maritza...
...what do you think?
They're lying.
What does it matter, anyway?
Kill them.
Yeah, you are probably right.
Do you know what I was thinking?
After the war, $1 million.
You, a simple peasant girl from where?
I can never pronounce the name of the place you come from.
With so much money, we could...
They're lying.
Kill them.
Out! Out!
Out! Get out.
Forward march.
Halt.
What did I tell you?
Well, at least we got a good night's sleep.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Our intelligence confirms your escape from Italy.
You and you, follow me, please.
Your escape from Italy is one thing.
The rest of your story is something else.
I had time to sleep on it.
So this morning, you know what I did?
I opened the suitcase.
Maritza!
And what do you think I found?
Firewood.
What did you expect? We buried it before your Chetniks picked us up.
We're not stupid . It's the only thing we've got to bargain with.
That is what I thought you would say.
I think you're lying.
You know they're lying. Why don't you let Drazak get rid of them?
Gently, Maritza.
I don't believe your so-called penicillin exists, but it just might.
So I will let you go and dig it up for me.
And if we do, you'll shoot us and bury us in the same hole.
I shall certainly shoot you if you don't.
Well, gentlemen, the choice is yours.
How the hell did we get into this?
More importantly, how are we going to get out of it?
I'm sure you'll think of something, major.
Any brilliant ideas, major?
I was hoping you might make a contribution, colonel.
What I can't figure is how the firewood got in the case.
Neither can I.
Don't know where we're gonna find any spare penicillin here, do you?
What are we gonna do, keep walking until we reach the Adriatic?
I don't think the iron maiden will let us get that far.
Halt!
What did I tell you?
We are three miles past the spot where you were picked up.
Well, where is this wonderful treasure?
In your imagination?
No, ma'am, it's not in our imagination.
I think it's a bit further on, don't you?
Yes, it is. Well, I mean, it's not much further than this.
It's hard to tell, the whole country looks alike.
You will start digging within five minutes.
What if we haven't found it in five minutes?
Then you will be digging your graves.
Hey, colonel.
Wait a minute, now this looks familiar.
Isn't this our little hollow down here?
Yes, yes, I think it is.
I remember this knoll over here.
Ma'am, this is it.
I think this is it.
- This knoll over here?
- Right.
You see, comrade, we lined it up between them...
There you are!
- There's our pile of stones.
- Right.
There it is, right over there, comrade.
Gotta get them closer and we use the spades.
You take the two that are closest to you...
...and I'll take the other one and the broad.
I'm gonna get them closer now, okay?
Fritz. Fritz, come! It's here.
- Ready?
- All right.
You can get up now. They're dead.
I'm the one who puts firewood in people's cases...
...and hides their high explosives.
Don't sit there gawping.
Get out of here.
Keep moving in that direction.
Try to find Petrovitch's Partisans.
Now, go.
Excuse me, good comrade soldier...
...but exactly what story are you gonna tell Schroeder about all this?
You took us by surprise.
You got away.
Here, hit me.
Did you expect me to go back there with my hair combed?
Hit me.
Well, all right. I'm sorry.
Harder.
- Come on, colonel.
- She gonna be all right?
Don't worry about that one.
She's tough.
I hope that man Schroeder believes that girl's story.
If he doesn't believe her, he'd better think twice about calling her a liar.
What about Miller and Reynolds?
What about them, colonel?
Yes.
I suppose they...
Let's move it.
Do you have the feeling we're being followed?
About the last 10 minutes.
Next time you can play the corpse.
Yeah, you seem pretty good with that thing, though.
Could have been luck.
Where are we? What is this?
Partisan territory, I should think.
You better hope.
- Germans?
- Yes, or Drazak, I suppose.
Who are they?
Partisans, thank God.
Good morning.
- We've been looking for you people.
- Be quiet.
You will make your report to Major Petrovitch.
Hey, what the hell are they so ticked off at?
- I think we've run into bad company.
- Yeah?
Yes, the leader.
- What about him?
- Afraid I know him.
- Nicolai.
- Who the hell is Nicolai?
It's Nicolai Lescovar.
The man I was sent to kill.
Dam, if it's the one I think it is.
I know where we are.
So do I . Right in it.
Do you think he's recognized you?
Yes, I think so.
Where are we going?
What's going on?
What the hell is going on here?
Lieutenant Colonel Barnsby,
United States Rangers.
Major Mallory, sir.
You got away from the Germans.
How?
We escaped.
Captain Lescovar has his doubts about that.
If you escaped, why were the Germans not pursuing you?
We observed you for five miles before we picked you up.
You should've observed that we killed two Chetniks that were following us.
- The men with the bandaged faces.
- Exactly.
Hardly a cause for congratulation.
Those two men were Partisans.
Comrades of ours whom we had infiltrated into the Chetnik camp...
...so now all links with our agent there are broken, thanks to you.
I'm sorry.
The fact remains that we're Allied officers.
There's no reason we should be treated this way.
I'm here in command of Force 10.
I insist that we be allowed...
...to contact the Allied mission.
I'm sure London informed you.
I was informed of your mission.
Personally, I doubt if it was ever a practical one...
...but now that you are here without equipment, the question is academic.
And you, major, you came here as an observer, perhaps?
No, sir.
I was charged with a mission of my own.
It's confidential.
Confidential!
Sometimes I get the impression...
...that London looks on this theater of operations...
...as a convenient place for conducting what they call "war games."
- May I speak to you personally?
- You are speaking to me personally.
- I mean alone.
- No.
The People's Army does not conduct military business in secret.
Very well, sir.
I was sent here to identify a German agent, code name Nicolai.
We are reliably informed...
...that he has infiltrated the People's
Resistance Army, and is now known...
...as Captain Lescovar.
And having identified this man, what were your further orders?
I was to eliminate him, sir.
- Eliminate. Don't you mean kill?
- Yes, sir. I do mean kill.
Do you hear that, Lescovar?
The gentleman from London wants us to shoot you.
I'm sorry, major.
I must admit you are indeed partly right.
There was an agent named Nicolai...
...operating somewhere south of here and also calling himself Lescovar.
But he was identified many months ago. And eliminated.
The British were informed.
- But London were very specific, sir.
- Yes, they frequently are specific...
...and just as frequently wrong.
Lieutenant Marko, see that these gentlemen...
...give you a full report on their activities in the Chetnik camp.
A specific report.
Well, captain, I guess we owe you a bit of an apology, don't we?
Well, it happens. We all get badly briefed sometimes.
Wish we had been briefed about the men with the bandages.
Replaced them with a couple of your own, that's a good trick.
They were messengers to our agent at Schroeder's headquarters.
Is your agent small, dark, pretty...
...beautiful gray eyes and shoots from the hip?
You mean Maritza? Yes.
She took a big chance for us.
She isn't Petrovitch's daughter for nothing.
Gutsy broad, saved our asses.
We hold this end of the bridge.
Over there, the Germans prepare for the final attack.
We have been ordered to prevent them crossing at all costs.
What exactly do they have over there?
Three divisions, perhaps more.
We hold a brigade here.
Soon they will bring up tanks, then--
- Why haven't you blown the bridge?
- We have tried several times.
Each time we lost valuable men.
Major Petrovitch has decided it is impractical.
Well, he's wrong about that.
There's no bridge in the world that can't be blown.
That's what Force 10 was here to prove.
I told you before, you have no men, you have no equipment.
I can radio London for equipment.
Get me an airstrip operational.
Oh, call London, prepare an airstrip for a plane that may never arrive.
- Have you anything else to suggest?
- Yes.
Give me 20 men,
I can blow that bridge to hell.
You mean you can blow 20 of my men to hell, for nothing!
That bridge is indestructible.
Excuse me, sir, you don't need 20 men.
You need Miller.
- Miller?
- He's an expert with explosives, sir.
He's probably the best in England.
- This Miller is in England?
- No, sir.
- Prisoner in the Chetnik camp.
- Then he's already dead.
Not necessarily, major.
I refuse to mount a full-scale operation just to find out, colonel.
I need every single man
I've got here now.
Sir, we don't need to mount a full-scale operation.
Just give us two men.
We got company.
These officers are from headquarters.
They're here to interrogate you.
You reported five prisoners, major.
Two of them tried to escape.
They were shot.
Major Schroeder is in the armory, and I have told you before...
...this area is out of bounds to all of you people, except Captain Drazak.
Kindly remove yourselves immediately...
...and if you can read, which I doubt, take a look at standing orders.
There. You have made me burn the milk.
Sergeant, let it burn.
You see, my colleague does not believe you are deserters.
- The prisoners, sir.
- What prisoners?
I thought you said these men had been shot.
Right, gentlemen, shall we go?
No!
This is not correct.
Quick. Miller! Get out of sight.
Bring him. Open it.
- Go.
- Marko.
Partisan bitch!
Always so kind to the men with burns.
But they have no burns.
The three Germans with the prisoners that escaped...
...all shot in the back with machine pistols.
You killed them.
Good . Give me the hat.
Come on.
Open. Open up.
Open!
Open!
- What about Miller's suitcase?
- The girl. She'll know where it is.
Milly.
Thank you, major.
Of all the shitty times to run out of gas.
Weaver, don't stand there with your head up your ass. Let's get this truck moving.
She okay?
Well, we'll drive as carefully as we can.
Hey, you . I don't like the way you talk.
- You what?
- I don't like the way you talk to me.
This truck doesn't move till somebody tells me what's going on.
Now, look, you--
You big-time officers have shafted me twice.
You tried to dump me in Italy, ran out on me back there.
- You don't tell me what's going on.
- I don't believe this.
Excuse me, but is your trouble that you want to be part of the team?
I don't want to be a part of any lousy team.
I just want some equal consideration.
I don't think you'll get equal consideration...
...from those people back there.
Do you?
Nobody moves until somebody tells me what you're planning to do.
We're going to blow up a bridge.
- Is that a fact?
- That's the general idea, sergeant.
- That's why we came back for Miller.
- Yeah, Miller.
You didn't give a mother-hunch about me.
You came back for Miller, but you didn't come for me?
No, we didn't.
That's the first straight answer you've given me.
I think the major's got a point, colonel.
They do look kind of mean, don't they?
Don't stand there gaping like an idiot.
- Get in there and drive the truck!
- All right.
We'll have to do this another way.
Get away from the truck.
Wait for my signal.
Useful little insect, isn't he?
- Keep an eye on him, Marko.
- Miller, you are an incurable show-off.
Don't knock it, major. Don't knock it.
There it is.
Lescovar's confirmed my signals got through to London.
Do you like that chap?
- Who's that, Lescovar?
- Yeah.
I haven't thought anything about him.
- Knows his job, I suppose.
- Yes, he does, doesn't he?
All right, sergeant?
What do you think?
Pretty straightforward, isn't it?
Well, no, not exactly.
In fact, not by a long chalk.
I'd say you're flogging a dead horse there, old man.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Want to take a look?
Are you kidding?
I know every inch of that bridge.
Oh, yeah?
In that case, you'll have noticed how it's built into the living rock.
And how those main pilings are not just ferroconcrete, but 20 feet thick.
That's not forgetting--
I told you, London's dropping the same stuff we had before.
Yes, I know what you're getting, but it's not gonna be enough.
- What do you mean, not enough?
- You might just bend it a little...
...burn the paint work here and there.
But nothing that would seriously inconvenience the Jerries, I thought.
Our experts have been studying that bridge, and they say it'll blow.
I don't know where you learned your job...
...but I'm talking about the best engineers in the business.
Yes. They're probably experts at building things...
...whereas I'm an expert at blowing them up.
Take it from me that one would need eight hours...
...to make a decent job of that bridge.
Eight hours?
Assuming, of course, the Jerries are kind enough to leave us in peace.
- And maybe provide a few working lights.
- Miller.
You've seen those searchlights, have you? Well, I--
- Miller.
- Sir.
I think you've made your technical point.
Many thanks, sir.
If I weren't absolutely sure of my facts,
I wouldn't be telling you this now.
And you do understand, sir,
I'm not exaggerating.
What would happen to the bridge if that central arch...
...was suddenly hit by several million tons of water?
- Water?
- Water?
I think we've been talking about the wrong target.
Remember that dam we passed up around the bend?
What kind of a dam? Where is it?
Two and a half miles up the river.
But, my dear chap, why didn't you say so before?
Oh, I could do a tremendous job on a dam, yes.
With a dam, you've got natural elements working for you.
It's like an enormous bath.
All you've got to do is pull the plug.
Thank you.
Come along, gentlemen.
As a technician, I thought you might be interested in that dam, Milly.
So the RAF drops the stuff and we blow the dam, right?
Right.
Is it anything like Boulder Dam?
Now, that baby's big, man.
How often have you used this as a dropping zone?
Never.
The Germans see to that.
We have to keep moving around.
Makes sense.
Think those two guys know anything about blowing a dam?
Oh, no, I shouldn't think they've got a clue.
But never mind, old Weaver...
...we sergeants will see them through as usual.
- Right.
- Hello.
Ought you to be out and about?
It's jolly cold.
Come on in, take a seat.
Thank you, but one thing
I cannot do just yet is sit down.
You're not staying for the fireworks?
Bags of panic and blue lights.
No. I've seen too many airdrops.
They don't compare to a nice, warm bed.
Would you believe it? Right on time.
Marko. Marko...
I don't believe it.
Poor bastards.
This was no accident.
We've been had.
We've lost our last chance.
Damn.
Oh, no.
There is no question.
We were betrayed.
Aren't we always with Allied missions?
Their security's a joke.
It doesn't matter.
We do our part, and what do we get?
Twenty lives lost.
- One of them--
- It's past.
Finished.
All that matters now is that the
Germans are marshaling their tanks.
They will cross the bridge at first light tomorrow...
...and there is nothing we can do to stop them.
And you four gentlemen have outstayed your usefulness.
You'll be escorted back to the Allied military mission.
Out of harm's way?
Sir...
...I could leave the Germans some very nasty surprises.
Thank you, sergeant.
I think we have had enough surprises.
Captain Lescovar, see that these gentlemen have an escort of two men.
If those chaps had just half the equipment of the Jerries...
...I could've made that dam look like a Swiss cheese.
It's absolutely sickening.
Do you think the Jerries will have that gear we need in their supply dump?
Of course they would.
Lashings of HE, land mines, detonators, everything.
It's an absolute certainty.
Your escort, colonel.
- I think you will find them reliable.
- Okay, thank you.
I think we're going to need rather more men than this, captain.
My sergeant thinks that the Germans have the necessary equipment...
...in their forward supply dump so that the colonel can blow the dam.
That means you'd have to get into the marshaling yards at Mostar.
None of you speak enough German.
You need me to help.
Thank you, captain.
- Hope all you guys can swim.
- Would it matter?
No.
- You know, I could get shot for this.
- Couldn't we all?
You look real beautiful, you know that?
Yes, it's all right for you.
You don't have to come with us.
We'll be back in exactly
35 minutes, right?
- Okay.
- That's if the shop's open, old boy.
Pity they didn't teach you German at that school of yours.
Instead of Latin?
Perish the thought, old boy.
These any use to you?
No, Tellermines is what we want.
They look like dirty gray-green dinner plates.
Maybe they just haven't got any.
They have.
I wonder what happened to Barnsby and his truck.
I've been asking myself the same question.
Well, we can't just stand here like ducks in thunder.
Over there. The railway wagon.
Get the stuff in there till he comes.
Barnsby should have been here by now. Where the hell is he?
Beautiful.
- They're just the job.
- Not now, Milly.
Well, I'd rather do it now than in some ditch.
- How long?
- Oh, about 10 minutes...
...given peace and quiet.
Can't anything be easy?
Hey, where in the hell have they gotten to?
You maniac.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'll go and have a look around, see if I can find them.
- There he is.
- Wait. I'll get him.
- That's Lescovar.
- Yeah.
- Where's Marko?
- I don't know...
...but 10-to-1 they're hiding in that boxcar.
Shithead.
Bloody hell.
What's up now?
Some great ape of a sergeant, he's sent Barnsby's truck away.
Oh, no.
Sergeant.
Be quiet. Listen to me.
There are two British commandos in that truck behind me.
Two British commandos?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Colonel Von Ingorslebon,
Special Field intelligence Group.
Stand still, idiot. Look natural.
There is a third, an American colonel...
...in the truck which you just sent away.
I want to take them all together.
- What's Lescovar doing?
- He's shooting him some kind of story.
Go and assemble a squad of armed men. Quickly and quietly.
And keep them out of sight.
Then report back to me. Understand?
Good old Lescovar.
Best line-shooter in the Balkans.
What the hell's going on, colonel?
Just shut up and stay out of sight.
Where the hell are you going?
All right, you guys, let's-- Oh, shit.
The sacks, get them up here quick.
- You picked a fine time to do this.
- Sling out my suitcase, will you?
You trying to screw up this operation?
We're behind schedule already.
- How did you get here?
- I've been through that already.
Help me get this stuff loaded and get it on the truck.
- Right, Miller?
- Right, all set.
Let's go. Easy.
Hold it.
It's that man again.
I'll take care of him. Close the door.
They are all yours, sergeant.
Bring the squad.
All clear?
Give them a moment to get out of sight.
That fool, Marko, must have given himself away.
I don't know how.
How in the hell are we gonna get back across the river?
I mean, where are we going?
Berlin, I shouldn't wonder.
Sarajevo.
That's where the train goes.
No stops.
I'm sorry about Marko.
It's a risk we all take.
He was a brave man and a good friend.
Do you think that big sergeant spotted him as a Partisan?
I can't buy that.
The sergeant wasn't that bright.
He saluted you, you're wearing a corporal's uniform.
That doesn't rate a salute in the German army.
Not in anybody's army.
Why do you think he saluted you, Lescovar?
Perhaps he recognized my natural superiority.
Yes, perhaps.
You say this train goes to Sarajevo, no stops?
Yeah.
But I noticed on the map that we pass within a half a mile of the dam.
Strange you didn't bother to mention that.
Now, what's all this about?
Some fool of a sergeant salutes me...
...and I forget to mention that we pass near the dam.
And a little while ago, you said that
Marko must have given himself away.
I don't think he gave anything away...
...except his life.
What did you give away, Lescovar?
You think I'm a traitor, is that it?
I don't think, I know.
I've always known.
I just couldn't prove it.
You're Nicolai.
You're the man who blew us in Greece.
Thank you, colonel.
I've done your job.
You help me do mine.
Come on, you guys, move.
Once the Germans cross that bridge, they'll cut this country in half.
- There it is.
- Oh, crikey.
It's lit like a Christmas tree.
Doesn't matter. We gotta blow it.
Dawn's around 5:30.
If we don't blow it, the Yugoslavs will be dog meat.
What you need, sir, is a little diversion, isn't it?
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Oh, I don't know.
Try and imagine you're a dog.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
On the road, man, on the road.
I thought you were supposed to pick up dog shit, not spread it around.
Hallelujah!
That's some heavy-duty dog doo.
Just unroll it and string it out.
Shit, what's this, another one of his toys?
Damn, ain't that something?
Dog turd, snakes.
Come on, blackie.
Come on, blackie.
Come on.
Hey, you bleed red blood, eh, blackie?
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Don't worry, just keep moving.
One slip and we'll both go down.
This way. Over here.
Here.
Right here.
There we are. You all right, old man?
Once those panzers cross that bridge...
...they'll go through this country like a dose of salts.
Come on, blow, damn it! Blow!
Give them a chance.
They'll be here in a minute.
If they'd been caught, we'd have heard the alarm go off.
Almost finished.
How long do we make the fuse?
They're Germans, they're gonna be punctual.
Usually are.
We've run out of time.
Twenty seconds?
What do you say?
It's your decision, colonel.
I'm asking you.
Twenty seconds sounds about right, then we won't have so far to run.
It would have been nice to see that bridge go, huh?
Yes, wouldn't it?
All been very interesting, though, hasn't it?
Yes.
It didn't do a goddamn thing. Nothing!
Miller! That useless git!
- It didn't...
- What?
- It didn't work!
- I know it didn't work!
- Well, let's get out of here!
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
When I catch that little perisher,
I'll wring his useless neck!
Nothing!
We've been through all this, and nothing.
Nothing but:
You can't expect an enormous volcano with three tiny bags of explosives.
You have to let nature take her course.
Give it time, it'll work.
Hold it.
If I were you, I'd get out of here fast!
Faster.
- You son of a bitch!
- I told you, it's only a matter of waiting.
You cute little son of a bitch!
You did it! Come here.
You did it! You did it!
You cute little son of a-- You did it!
Why, you limey genius, I love you!
Steady on, old Weaver, steady on.
You did it!
Miller, you horrible little man...
...you knew that was gonna be a slow-motion explosion.
You deliberately didn't tell me, did you?
I didn't want to bore you with technical detail.
I thought it might be a bit over your head.
What happened to you?
He bit me in all the excitement.
But damn it to hell, we did it, colonel, we did it!
Yes, we did, sergeant. We did.
And a merry Christmas.
Yes, gentlemen, we did it.
But before...
...we can start awarding ourselves
Victoria Crosses...
...and Congressional Medals of Honor and so on...
...and so forth and such like...
...I think I'd better point out that, one:
We're on the wrong side of the river.
That two: We have no hope whatsoever of rejoining the Partisans.
And that three:
This neck of the woods will soon be crawling with bad-tempered Germans.
And four:
I don't think that our little genius,
Sergeant Miller there...
...has even got a box of matches left in his suitcase.
And so, therefore,
I think we can take it, gentlemen...
...that we are going to have a very long walk home.
Where the Nile rises on the equator...
is the Africa of the great lakes.
Uganda is half the size of France.
Her ten million inhabitants have never known famine.
Her agricultural wealth, her exports of coffee,
cotton, copper and to developing industry...
allow her, for the most part, to be less and less dependent...
on the outside world.
It was shortly after the independence...
of this former British colony in 1962...
that Lieutenant Idi Amin Dada became interested in politics.
He rapidly became chief of staff...
and the right-hand man of President Obote,
whom he overthrew in 1971 by a coup ´etat.
Obote was unpopular,
and his fall was welcomed by the population.
He fled to Tanzania and a reward was offered for him,
dead or alive.
General Amin soon attracted attention on the international scene...
with his numerous telegrams to other heads of state.
He called Nixon
"my dear brother"...
and wished him a quick recovery from the Watergate affair.
He congratulated the Chilean junta when it took power.
He ordered the queen of England to send the Scottish guard...
to accompany him to the Commonwealth Conference.
Eighty-thousand Asians installed by the British in Uganda...
at the beginning of the century...
controlled 80% of the country's economy.
In 1972, after a dream,
General Amin declared the economic war,
which meant, on one hand,
giving 90 days to the Asians to leave the country,
taking with them the strict minimum,
and, on the other hand, distributing their business to Ugandans.
Today, the economic war has not yet been won.
Distribution chains and imports have been disrupted.
The country's foreign reserves are at their lowest.
In the capital, it is almost impossible...
to find sugar, flour, imported industrial products,
spare parts or matches.
Uganda holds the record for inflation in Africa.
In one year, prices have risen from 20 to 50%.
On February 10th, 1972,
to set an example and to combat budding guerilla warfare,
General Amin organized
12 public executions...
at the same time in the country's main towns.
Most observers agree...
that several thousand
Ugandans have disappeared...
since General Amin seized power.
Among the missing. '
The vice dean of the university,
the president of the high court, doctors and former ministers.
In 1973, the International
Commission ofjurists...
published a report denouncing
Uganda as a lawless country,
and it wrote about the missing personalities. '
"There is every reason to think that they have been assassinated...
by members of the army immediately after their arrest. "
The whole worlds are looking at General Amin... and at Uganda as a whole.
What will be the future of Uganda?
The people are looking at this.
I would like to speak as the heavyweight champion here in Uganda.
Um...
I am sure I will be in position even to defeat or defend myself.
But I wanted to tell you this:
As a boxer, also I am very happy to receive this as a rugby player... because I've been a member... of the rugby team in Uganda.
And I used to play second row.
You know, pushing is very hard and also wing three quarter.
You should know that
I used to run 9.8 second hundred yards.
This is...
With my speed, with my weight... of, of getting the ball... and when you tackle me, you can harm yourself.
I think you should know this.
But I wanted to tell the boxers... that the only chance to defeat the referee... who are against you... or against the country, is to win by knockout.
This is the only thing.
And this is the most important.
You must do everything possible...
to win by knockout.
You must knock anybody who is sparring with you in the boxing ring.
This is my last. Thank you very much.
Fire!
- All the man in.
- Excellent.
All in the heart.
Very good.
I come from very poor family.
I wanted to tell you this.
And when I became bigger, my father has no money.
I am to work, digging, and then people give me some money for food.
And some money I keep it and I pay my school fees.
And I study through hardship, not just comfort.
And also I used to...
Then I was taken by force into the army... here in Kampala during the war.
And... I went there.
I did not want.
But later on, because of force, during the second World War,
I was taken to Burma.
And I work there until now.
I went through difficulty.
I go to the rank, from my rank, from the rank of lance corporal... up to general now... I became general.
Your Excellence, guard all warmed up.
Formed up in two ranks, ready for inspection, Your Excellence.
And if they found that what you are saying, it is not truth, then they will never listen for you again.
And that, you will lose confidence to the people.
But the people likes me very much.
The reason why I am very popular because I always speak to them truth.
And if I don't have anything to tell them, I keep quiet.
We see the paratrooper school.
On March 10th, 1974,
the general announced,
"With the help of friendly countries,
"Uganda is going to arm to the teeth to reach...
an international combat level. "
As a paratrooper, they know exactly to jump and be into sections.
This song they do before they jump.
It warm them completely.
I can't tell you, because it is confidential in any country... cannot tell you the strength of the army.
Since I came in power, automatically Uganda become revolutionary... not only the armed forces, but the whole police, prisons, the whole public.
You see, lion...
Um, lion... if you don't disturb lion, it can't do any harm.
And also I like very much elephants... because it is a sign of liberty... freedom and it moves freely.
It wants a big space.
This is the elephant.
And this is a sign you can see in Africa.
There is plenty of land where it can move freely.
It can eat completely without being disturbed.
And you find this only in Africa.
And that is why you find that the wild animal... have got freedom mostly in Africa.
And, um...
And, uh, this is actually what I am trying to do... here in Africa.
The reason why I am very popular, my policy all over Africa and every African peoples... wants freedom for their people.
They have requested me to tell their leaders... to give them this freedom... and same policy as I did here in Uganda.
Because here I gave...
a completely full economical independence...
to the people of Uganda.
How many crocodiles here?
Very many, yes.
And this is a very good area of the crocodiles.
It is a headquarter of the crocodile, you can see.
You see as it is running very fast.
I think this might be captain of crocodiles.
Yes. He understand me now.
He's moving.
Very big. Yes.
Yes, very good. Yes.
And we are now going, actually, to the headquarters of crocodile, where they lay more eggs... they produce more children.
We are going now.
And it is very attractive.
And you can see here... hundreds of crocodiles.
Thousands of hippo, you see?
Guinea fowls, in there at the edge. You see?
Guinea fowls.
And this elephant is very big.
You see?
And here it is a place where you can found... there is more crocodile than anywhere in the world.
This place.
We say, "How are you?"
Very good.
He is eating.
He is greeting me also.
And even this crocodile is looking at us.
Can I ask you to move?
Uh? Oh, we still want to watch it.
- You want me to ask it to move?
- Yes.
Hey!
You see, it open this... so that the... ants... can go into the mouth and then it eats.
That's why it doesn't want to be disturbed.
He is sleeping.
And most of them, they lay their eggs under this places.
Down there.
You was telling us that you think the Nile...
is a link between your country,
Sudan and Egypt.
But for ages, it has been the problem between the Arabs and the Africans.
The negros.
What do you think of that?
Yes. It has been because the leaders of Arabs... before, they were not revolutionary leaders.
But today, during my time as a revolutionary leader,
I want to bring everybody... in Africa and Arab worlds very closely, and Asia and Europe.
And, therefore, we, the revolutionary leaders, we want to be friendly with all peace-loving people in the world.
And this is highly appreciated very much... by most revolutionary leader in Arab.
That's why you find that, today, there is more unity... between Africa and Arab than before, especially during my tour of Middle East.
I have toured very many countries, and I have brought them together as one family.
You see?
Elephant is dragged into water.
I think it can't get out.
This is a very, very good picture you can get.
This is the most beautiful part... in the continent of Africa.
Used to be called Madison Falls.
But it is now
Kabalega Falls National Park.
That is the one.
And it is a tourist attraction.
I came so close to the Arab... because Arab found that I am most influencing leader... in Africa... in the continent.
And also I am a leader who speaks the truth.
Did your Muslim religion take part...
into your choice of the Arabs?
It is not because of the Muslim... because the people who broke relationship with Israel... they are not only Muslims, they are Christians.
But they have seen the truth.
And everybody listen for me.
And even in O.A.U., if I don't speak, every leader try to ask why, and I must speak.
Like in a nonaligned conference in Algeria...
I was not feeling well.
I did not speak.
But 15 minutes before the conference closed,
I was brought to come and give a speech.
I gave very good speech,
including Castro broke relationship with Israel after my speech.
Telegram sent to Mr. Kurt Waldheim,
permanent secretary of the United Nations. '
"Hitler and all the German people...
"knew that the Israelis are not people who work in the interest of the world,
"and that is why they burnt six millionjews alive with gas...
on the soil of Germany. "
This telegram was sent the day after the Munich killings.
Some years before,
General Amin had undergone,
as had other Ugandans, paratroop training in Israel.
But I'm trained as a paratrooper in Israel.
But I have got a very good brain.
And even General Dayan knows that I am very good field officer.
You knew Dayan very well?
I know him and...
I know him.
He has been my friend.
He has been giving me dinner, lunch in his house.
If I go to Israel,
I used to stay with Dayan.
He brings air force, band playing for me.
We stay together.
But I must make absolutely truth.
The reason why
I chased them from Uganda... was because of the economy of Uganda.
Uganda was going to be bankrupt.
That is the reason why
I chased away the Israelis.
- You were friends with Golda Meir?
- Yes.
Because she used to give me very good entertainment...
when I go to Israel.
Then you changed completely...
from an Israeli alliance to the Arab alliance.
I changed from Israeli alliance... because Israeli are criminals... and they are not trusted people.
They don't tell the world the truth.
They were taken to Palestine as refugees.
And then they changed Palestine to became the State of Israel... by force of arms... given to them by Americans and the British.
But is it true that you said...
Hitler didn't kill enough jews during the war?
Why do you ask me about Hitler?
The Hitler's problem is now past tense.
Now we are looking forward... for the future generations and a future plan.
We are no longer going back to Hitler's.
You see, the war of Hitler... it was a different war than the war today.
If I am to prepare the war against Israel completely, no, I don't want very many... army, air force and navy... just very few.
And I strike inside Israel... and move people from the whole border towards Israel.
I think the situation would be very difficult... and very different.
Strike from inside with paratrooper?
With the paratrooper, with everything, completely.
Yes, because you got to get there by paratrooper... and also bombing by airplanes... and having few squadron of suicide... these who are determined to be suicide.
And I think that is already in progress... and they are practicing.
The suicide squadrons are already in practicing progress.
I think very many delegations meeting me now, preparing for this.
And they come to conclusion.
It is true.
You'll find it here.
And this will change the type of battle.
And we can command from here, not from the battlefield, but through communication.
And will there be Ugandans in those battalions?
I don't know, but any volunteer.
Even France...
French volunteer... they are welcome also.
But I welcome, I welcome any volunteer all over the world.
Even Japanese, even Vietnamese... are there in these squadrons.
But they are now in training.
They are undergoing training now three months.
This is the pilot.
Then go to the Middle East and visit the war... see how they are fighting and encourage them to fight.
This was my decision.
And I enjoy it very much... having breakfast with some Syrians and Iraqi... breakfast in the tanks.
I was very happy.
In October, while I was there,
I was visiting troops. I had my troops.
You had some soldiers up there?
- I had the navy, yes.
- Navy?
- Yes. In Alexandria.
- Navy?
- But you don't have navy...
- We have trained.
- Ah, really?
- Yes.
This is our secret weapon in Lake Victoria.
Marine. Frogmen I think is very good.
Yes.
In '67,you were on the Suez Canal?
Yes, yes. But you see, I am only one who has been in both sides.
During the '67 war,
I was in Suez Canal, on the other side.
And now I am in the Suez Canal in the other side. I like very much.
First, the armored, after crossing the Lake Galilee, reaching the foot of the Golan Heights, they are engaged by the enemy... and the officer... commanding mechanized battalion... ask for the support... by paratroopers and air support.
You understand?
I'm just explaining to you.
And while the armored... and the mechanized regiment are being engaged, the air force gave support... so that the paratrooper land by helicopter... on the Golan Heights and captured Golan Height.
- We go because helicopter coming.
- Okay.
You film. Film helicopter.
Right now the armored regiment... they have been engaged below the Golan Heights.
And the commander of the mechanized regiment... requested for the support.
And, therefore, the paratrooper have been landing, fighting to capture the objectives.
But air will come and give them support.
They will be...
To capture completely the Golan Heights.
Another one is behind you.
Here, here, here.
Left. Now advance.
- Advance!
- Advance!
Here, here.
Victory over Golan Heights.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
The meeting is nonconfidential... because I think that is why you see here... there is... the press people.
They are taping and they wants to make a film... about the cabinet.
But I have about seven points which I think...
I should brief you completely... and tell you to know... exactly what is going on.
One is this:
All of you, you are in very high-ranking governmental positions.
Your duty is not to be very weak.
You must not be like a woman... who is just weak, and he can't speak, even talk.
You must be a person who... to approach everybody as a minister.
You want to know. You must be concerned to know the problems... as a minister, as a governor, as any high-ranking governmental officer.
This is the one point which I must tell you.
You must be concerned in planning ahead for your ministry.
Nobody is to plan for you,
but it is you, with your permanent secretary... and the whole officer under your command, to plan for you, for your minister, in advance.
Not General Amin to tell you... that you go and plan this and this for your ministry.
You should not be like a ministry of foreign affairs.
I'm speaking not even now when Otiang was there.
Because some people who are rotten... they are there since Otiang was there and also he's there.
These people are never been informed since the former regimes.
What they know is to educate people in common man's chatter only, but not proper educating people... of the worl´s the policy of the government.
This I know direct from international people whom I've been sending.
They have been informing me that people have not been educated outside... to know what actually is happening here in Uganda.
And this is the ministry of foreign affair.
This is the weakness of the minister of foreign affair.
Two weeks later,
the body of Michael Ondoga,
Minister of Foreign Affairs,
was found in the Nile.
He was replaced by a former model,
Princess Bagaya,
who holds a law degree from Oxford.
And everybody must be removed... who have got the ideology... or the mentality... of the capitalist... who are no revolutionaries.
I've been informed by the minister of foreign affair... before even Ondoga came that this is good, this is good, must remain there.
But I found they are rotten completely.
They are the one who have been putting even "shameful," but while our position is very good.
We are not bankrupt completely in Uganda.
We are very rich.
I don't want somebody... any minister...
make me good report.
You must only tell me the truth.
This I've been telling you, and now the truth is coming out.
The false report you have been reporting to me is now coming out.
Now I am going to second point.
As a minister,
governor, high-ranking peoples...
and the people of the country,
they must love their leader.
This is the point number one.
If you go to any country, you will find...
that everybody must love his leader.
They must love their ministers.
They must love their governors.
They must love their district commissioners, their teachers, their chiefs.
Everybody must be loved.
This...
It is an education to the people.
This is the duty of the minister.
If I see the minister is a coward, automatically
I kick you out of my office... because I know that you have got something wrong with you.
I will put some another person straight... or any governor or anybody.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
And even whether you hide, you will be known in the light, completely.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
Whether you hide, you go away, you will be known, completely.
But this particular second point is very important.
You must teach people to love their leader.
This is the only most important.
Like any country.
And the people also must love their ministers.
But loving... it is well known in Uganda.
You can't change as a minister.
Number three: Determinations.
You people must work with determinations.
And all other peoples...
you must teach them to work with determinations.
If I go sometime even in the ministry of defense,
I will not find even some commanders there in their offices.
I know this.
I been telephoning several time, checking with them, I can't find.
They are in their business in Kawempe, somewhere in Kampala, what.
You must put your contribution.
If I find you not attend cabinet three times without reason,
you are out of government.
Now, chiefs... Number four.
Chiefs and town agents.
The most important of the chiefs and the town agents, if they are to work very hard, they will help the police, the prison, the air force, the army.
This include the military police.
They will help you, the ministers.
They will not make even police very busy...
because they know who is actually good in the towns,
who is not very good in the town.
If you are to use these people properly... even the police... use these town agent properly...
They are being paid by the government.
They are not just working for nothing.
And marketing here in Kampala...
You must tell our womens in
Uganda to pull up their socks.
I want to see that Ugandans work very hard.
You must not make the womens of Uganda very weak.
They must get up quickly in the morning.
At about 5:00, they are already in nakassero, preparing ready to sell vegetable and everything in the shop.
If you go to Ghana, if you go to Nigeria, you will see that the whole shops, market, everything.
Is Nigeria.
I think you agree with me.
Everybody agree.
Why not here in Uganda?
You must tell our women I said... that the duty of the woman is the house woman.
He knows how to keep house very well.
If he can do that, let me make first examinations, appoint women to be the managers of hotel, which is done.
Because this is a part of the woman's job.
If they can keep house very well, it is exactly like their duty as a housewife.
If he's well-educated, he has got that brain, he is determined, he can look after the hotel very well.
I want to see a woman international hotel... very big one.
Must be woman Ugandans, and I know they can do it.
And you as a minister, you must back them completely.
If you find any man trying to not to obey the order and everything, you can punish that person.
You can remove that person.
You can put loyal people to her to see that we keep up standard.
I think we are the first in our country, in Africa today, who have got many woman managers than other countries.
We have got how many?
- Manager woman.
- Four.
We have got four manager,
and we have got another two assistant manager.
And another point here
I wanted to say.
There is C.I.A. Agents through Africa...
African, black Africans... who are coming here.
And you should know that spy is criminal.
To be an spy is very bad.
And your case is death, completely... sentence.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
If I found anybody is a spy, and any spy is found and anybody he is coming in this cover...
See, I want you to see that everybody must be checked... his poll-tax... for about three or five years.
And if he is found to be spy, his case is firing squad.
He must be handed straight to military police, must be dealt with the military tribunal... because the case of spying is very serious.
Anybody found is a spy, his case must be dealt with military tribunals.
Once he is confirmed, even military tribunals should not waste time... of making law all day, discussing about one person who is a spy.
Must be shortcut.
If minister find him,
don't even report it to me completely...
I don't want the ministers...
should wait anything which he thinks it is good for his ministry.
He is still waiting authority from me.
I don't want.
Then if that, you are not minister.
You are not making decisions.
A minister is a person who must make a decision himself, not wait for General Amin.
You can only inform me what you are doing, what has happened.
I feel very happy.
Because if I am to make a decision all the time, I will be very annoyed.
If you are not well-briefed, come back to me.
Telephone me at 5.'00 or midnight. You telephone me.
Some minister been telephoning me.
I been answering them.
My telephone is simple.
If you telephone me at 2241, whether at 3:00 in the morning,
I get your telephone, I speak to you.
And if you want a briefing,
I can brief you completely until you understand.
And when you go there, any reporters wants to ask you about Uganda,
I think you are well-equipped with all informations.
You can brief them.
You should not fear.
You should not say,
"No, it is not my duty. "
If you are that, you are not Ugandans.
And if I am to get this, you are not minister at all.
As with many other scenes in this film,
the people's welcome in a small garrison town...
was specially-organized for the film.
I am not completely communism, and I am not capitalism because I...
Even very many leaders ask me to join that part.
That part I don't want.
I am only leader who is alone completely... and following on only Uganda.
And this is how we want.
We want just to be free and also friendly... to the capitalism people, friendly to the socialism people.
But we are not going to adopt anything.
But we only choose what is the best from capitalism, from communism, we put in our, our policy of the country.
And this is what we found better.
We are not following any policy at all.
Seven, eight, two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Very... Very new gun.
- From guerillas.
- Guerillas?
This captured when we were invaded.
The general has already reviewed these arms several times.
They were captured during an attack in the autumn of 1972 from Tanzania,
organized by former President Obote...
- accompanied by a few hundred men.
- This submachine gun.
Relations with Tanzania have been uneasy since Amin seized power.
He dreamt of getting, by force of arms,
an outlet to the sea taken from Tanzania.
Your Excellence, all these were captured... by our chiefs as our troops were being trained.
These are homemade.
So I think that's how you can explain about that. Your Excellence.
Telegram sent to Julius Nyerere,
President of Tanzania.
"I want to assure you that I love you very much,
"and if you had been a woman,
I would have considered marrying you,
"although your head is full of grey hairs.
But, as you are a man, that possibility does not arise. "
It was then that you sent this telegram to Nyerere?
What was this?
- I think you read my telegram.
- Yes, what was it?
Was it to make fun of him?
Because I love him very much. Yes.
He did not reply me.
He kept quiet.
I lead the country on my best way, how I want them to be lead... according to my democracy, according to my knowledge... and according to my thinking... what is the best way of leading them.
And then I lead them according to that way.
- There's direct contact between you and the people? - Yes, and the people. Yes.
No middle man.
I have 18 children.
Idi Amin had four wives and has 18 children.
He has just repudiated three of his wives for not being revolutionary enough.
Ah, you see?
This one is very rough.
- Yes.
- How old, this one?
- This one?
- Uh? This one and a half year old.
And this...
- And Omonga.
- We have no preference.
This has been to Paris.
He has been to Soviet Union.
And this is still not yet in school, and this and that.
It's difficult to educate 18 children?
- Not very difficult.
- Not difficult?
I have 12 boys... and six girls.
This the one girl and six boys.
I am very good marksman.
But I like children very much.
Yes, they are very happy.
- That's very good.
- Maybe we could sit down there.
With you?
But you can't see the sun proper.
- You want interview me? Yes.
- Yes.
Every evening, there is a news broadcast...
in four languages on television.
The slightest event concerning the president is reported.
During a press conference with French journalists held at the Entebbe Palace,
His Excellency President Amin announced that he was in possession...
of a manual detailing all of the Israeli plans.
Mecca and Medina should be today... under the control of the Israelis.
But because they lost the war in first five days, they couldn't continue even further.
And that is why it stopped.
But their aim is to capture Mecca and Medina.
All the holy places all over the world... should be controlled by the Israelis.
This is their aim.
I have got these books with me.
And I am sure, after we finish here,
I will give you the copy of the book.
But you reading my copy today, here, and you give it back to me... because, if Israeli find it, they will buy the whole copy.
And they don't want the people in the world to see this book.
I will give you. It is here.
Uh, it is a book of the Israelis...
which is the teaching of the elders of the Israelis... of the Zionists.
The book is a fake,
published in 1901 by the Russian secret police.
Millions of copies were printed.
It was required reading in the schools of the Third Reich.
When asked if it was true that the Israelis wanted to poison the Nile,
General Amin replied that they had indeed wanted...
to do so while they were still in Uganda.
They can poison the water...
River Nile... from Uganda... so that the people who will be drinking in the other end, they will die.
General Amin remarked that the plans of the Israelis...
were even more disgusting than Hitler's against thejews.
Dreaming... it has been the true on my side.
Because some people dream which is not the truth.
But I dream the truth.
I dream, when I was still... just none, nothing, completely,
I will be the army commander.
I am commander of the highest man... commander in chief of the armed forces.
I dream I will be the head of state... and the most highest head of state in the world... when I was just none... and it became truth.
I dream completely in Karamonja, in August the fourth, at about 5:00 in the morning, that, if you take decision now... and remove the whole noncitizens... who are being milking the economy of Uganda, this is the only chance Uganda will get.
You must take immediate actions.
I left the place without breakfast, and I went and declare economic war.
And it is true.
Today, the people in Uganda are enjoying.
This is the truth. I dream about, before end of 1975,
Arabs will win the war.
I think I read did you dream people were trying to kill you?
I dream, but it was impossible.
They couldn't do it.
Because I know exactly...
I dream that in...
I know exactly when, how, what time I am going to die.
This I know.
And which year and which date.
All this I know already, and it is a secret.
I have said this clear.
Yes, I know. That is why you find me, I am not a coward... because I know exactly how I am going to die, following all what has been happening.
And I know exactly.
And I can know, sometime, what will happen in the country or to me... in the next few hours or few days.
I know this exactly.
And I know exactly that who will be making something... against me very soon.
I can notice him straight.
And he can get punishment from God straight.
Because I work only according to the Go´s instruction.
And I know exactly that who will be making something... against me very soon.
I can notice him straight.
And he can get punishment from God straight.
Because I work only according to the Go´s instruction.
It is voice of God, and it is not me just speaking, but it is the truth and it is meaningful.
And if you are to follow de Gaulle, he was a very great leader.
Napoleon... very great leader.
Mao Tse-tung is very great leader.
And... this leader whom I'm saying...
- Very great. Who is another you said?
- Qaddafi?
Qaddafi is very popular, whether the people in the Arab worlds in some way against him.
It is impossible, like me.
Here it is impossible.
We already put foundation stone of our... how strong we are in the worlds.
And the people understand.
And even I am still fighting... for the whole black people all over the worlds... in Caribbeans, in Negro Americans, all over the world, which I am still fighting for them.
And they respect me very much and very highly.
And they were taken to America as slaves... those people.
They did not want to go there.
And this is their country, but they were taken by force.
Therefore, nobody should remove them from there.
They must get independent in America, and they must control the Americans.
The black people in America... must be the president of the United States of America... must be the secretary of state, like Kissinger.
They are more brilliant... than the Dr. Kissinger.
Kissinger is not very intelligent.
Kissinger always go to the weakest leaders.
He never go to Qaddafi.
He never come to General Amin.
He fears us. You see?
This is what Kissinger is going.
He goes only to the weakest leaders.
Because he know there is the strongest leaders in Uganda.
And he will never go to Uganda.
- They are afraid of you?
- Yes.
Because I speak the truth, and I know their mistake.
I know their mistake, and I know how to teach the America their mistake.
On speaking of the Americans, the general said...
that he had in his possession certain equipment they used...
to spy on the Russian and Chinese embassies.
He noted that President Nixon wanted to export Watergate to Uganda.
And you see, this is the mistake of Nixon... of Watergate.
He was bringing in Uganda, taping all embassies...
Chinese embassies, Russian embassies.
All this problem was brought by...
And thaØs why they left...
because they got afraid when you discovered the thing?
That is why they run away from me.
And I say that how can 250 million... run away from only General Amin?
That I am very powerful than Americans.
I have no Phantoms.
- But you have MIGs.
- Hmm?
I have a brain.
Because I discover their mistake in advance.
Because my brain work in advance than them.
When I come out, we have to capture this port.
Eh? Everyone must reach this port.
- We are diving.
- I am not diving.
- just a jump.
- If you dive down, we cut you.
You must jump here and then start this straight.
Ready? You do now.
You give us green light.
Give us the time too. Ready? Go.
Very good.
I won.
I have seen the whole African... how they suffered, including my father and everybody.
- I know this very well.
- Can you tell a story?
- Hmm?
- Can you tell a story with that?
- I will just give you simple.
- An example.
People used to carry British on their heads.
British used to send...
They make something like a stretcher... and put chair on top.
And then they used to carry
British for miles and miles.
This is African carry.
And they used to dig holes and everything.
They used to carry when the British was here.
And the Africans, when they make a mistake, they used to be beaten by canes, completely, by the British.
You should like to see Mr. Heath?
I would be... I will never talk to anybody from Britain... if Mr. Heath himself does not come to me here.
Yes, here in Uganda, because I declared economic war here in Uganda.
And I will see him in command post. Not anybody.
If Mr. Heath does not come, then it is not my problem.
It is up to him.
It is up to him now to beg me.
If he doesn't beg me, it is up to him.
Because I am the one who has got the money.
I am not going to borrow money from him.
Even I don't want, I am getting millions of shillings.
Uganda is getting from selling their crops... and everything every years.
British now, actually...
They are in chaos, as you know.
Their economic is in chaos, completely.
I think if I am really British,
I could run to France... and ask the financial and assistant in France.
It is just your neighbor there.
You should help them.
Like, I am very far away from London.
But I am helping them. I am collecting.
I am appealing for everybody in the world to assist the British.
We made a collect of over 43,000 shilling.
And what Mr. Heath said?
- Mr. Heath?
- About this collect.
Uh, he said...
He hasn't replied me yet.
- He hasn't?
- Yes.
I am very annoyed.
I am waiting for his reply so that...
I have requested him for airplane... so that I can send the food.
Because some people donated food lorry of vegetable.
Three tons to be given to the friends in Britain.
But he hasn't send airplane yet.
But maybe it will be deteriorated?
I don't know. It is up to him... because I had sent on the very day they donated the food.
I have very many friends in Britain.
It is only the problem
I had to put to them.
That is why they have more problem.
You see there? I'm trying to help.
Even myself,
I donated 10,000 shilling...
from my own saving to Save the British Fund.
We have opened the fund here...
Save the British Fund.
Yes.
I wanted to... make... special language in black America of African... because I wanted to... brainwash them from British colonials.
And I wanted to make them understand one language in America.
I might introduce Swahili... to all black American... to understand this language in America.
You laid the stone of a foundation...
of a new broadcasting station.
Which country will it cover?
It will cover including France.
Including everybody,
I think, in Europe, in America, in Soviet Union,
China, everywhere.
It will cover...
So that in all Africa... people will listen for radio broadcast... from Uganda, direct.
This is very important.
Will you speak in English or...
No, it is going to be Swahili,
English, French, Arabic.
This is four official language will be spoken.
English, French, Arabic and Swahili.
Would you accept some Palestinian hijackers...
with their hostages in Uganda?
- The Palestinians?
- Yes, I read in the papers...
they were asking to be sent to Uganda or to Libya.
If they are sent here,
I would welcome them.
Because we believe in peace.
And that is why in the United Nations... they have already passed... one of the agenda... that the Black September should be treated... as prisoner of war, but not as the criminal... because they are fighting for their cause.
So you will put them in prison if they come here?
I don't know whether
I will put them in prison, but I know how I will keep them.
But they are welcome.
- In Uganda?
- Yes.
If they want to come to Uganda, they are welcomed in Uganda.
They have got representative.
Having expelled the Israelis,
General Amin installed the Palestinians...
in the former Israeli embassy.
But the people in some planes are innocent.
But you must not go in the airplane... which is belonging to Israelis, to Portuguese, to South Africa.
If you use these airplane, then it is up to you.
You must choose because the airplane is booked in advance.
You must know this.
It is not
Black September's mistake.
It is the people's mistake... because they are the one who choose what airplane they should fly in.
You must fly in Air France.
You must fly in East African Airway.
This is very good.
Faced with fines or imprisonment,
the naked tribesmen of Karamonja...
are forced to wear clothes.
Women are forbidden to wear wigs,
trousers or miniskirts.
General Amin has planned to group together...
the idle and unemployed and make them work in cooperatives.
You can actually educate people through traditional dance... how to make very good garden like this.
It will be in the song.
When you are singing, people are watching.
You talk about the flower. You must make very good garden in your house.
You must have house with big latrines.
Make it clean. People will understand.
"Oh, this song has got meaning.
I must go and make this. "
And you must boil the water before you drink... because you might have disease in the stomach.
You are helping doctor.
You understand?
You must work hard.
You must produce more foods... for export, for selling to get more money... and for your self reserve in case of dry season.
Hot sun.
You will have a reserve food in your store.
You will not die from hunger.
You are all right for your communication?
Yes, sir.
That's very good.
As a pilot, you must know... your all techniques within the aircraft.
You must know map reading very well, completely.
You must be ready to go and fight...
in any part of Africa...
which is still under imperialist domination...
if you have been directed to go... with other forces of the O.A.U. Members.
This is the one of the things.
But you are still to go for another intensive training.
You are to go for another... fastest airplane than this one.
You are to go.
Only one pilot, if he is to do his duty properly,
he can really make a big destructions.
And also, as a pilot, when you are going to fight, you must not think... that you are going back to the base.
But you must fly while knowing...
that you are going to complete your mission.
But if, God bless you, you go back... back to the base.
Amin gets ready to face...
a much more critical audience than his usual audiences.
It is a gathering of the capital's eminent physicians.
Indulge a private practice...
and to fight the economic war.
There has been growing concern in the public...
about some doctors who have located surgeries...
and others who have located private businesses...
have been spending most or a lot of their time...
and much of their attention...
was increasingly being drawn...
to their businesses in their private surgeries.
First, I would like to thank you for what you have been doing.
You have been doing very well.
And to be a doctor is not very easy thing, right from the time you have been born.
Because you went through difficult... through primary schools.
And you have been very intelligence.
You pass your primary school.
You went to secondary schools.
You pass.
You went into higher school.
You pass.
You proved to be very intelligent.
And that is why you have been selected... to be a doctor.
I know this very well because
I come from very poor family.
I know how... the person can come... right from the village level... up to the top standard of the doctor.
It is very difficult.
And don't spoil that chance.
When you have reached this standard, what you should do... you should practice more.
You should specialize... in some more fields... so that you will be able to help... and assist the people in the country.
And, as a doctor, you must be very clean, very smart.
You behave very well like a person.
And also, you are not too drunk.
You are the one who should advise the public.
You should advise General Amin not to drink.
This is very important.
This is the most important, because if a public learn... that you are drunkard,
automatically they lose confidence.
And even they can say that, if I am going to get operation by that doctor, he is a drunkard, he will not do anything good for me.
And they will completely refuse.
I am telling you sincerely.
And it is true. I must be frank to you and tell you this.
Because, also, to drink and overdrunk... it is not very good.
You will not even enjoy more.
Because you will not even have sense.
But if you drink very little, you feel very happy, very proud, and you talk to the people.
That will be... I'm just advising you.
If I am a commander of operations...
I wanted to fight... in Lugasi sugar factory.
I just giving you this.
Okay. There is enemy there.
What I want to use... air force.
What I will ask...
I will call the engineers.
I will call the pilots... and talk to them.
Can you, from this base and this base... can you reach Lugasi, come back without refilling?
Yes. How long can you fight there?
Give me timing.
This technicians will be in position, advising before I give any order.
And they tells me completely everything... how long they will be there and how long they will fight... and what is the number of the enemy and all this.
Then I write all this, discussing with the technician.
This is like a public service commission.
When they want to recruit the doctors, they come to you, you advise them.
But it is your duty as a doctor... to advise them properly... and your duty as a doctor... to advise your representative... who can represent you or myself or him properly... so that when he takes, he brings the points... concerning the medical field in the cabinet to me,
I have a full report... submitted to me, not only by him, but by you, the technicians.
Because you know the whole technical problem.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
You have any points to tell me?
Yes?
Your Excellence,
I'm quite happy to have heard...
that you are quite ready...
to be listening to the senior doctors.
Not only the senior doctors, but the young doctors, for the lives of the citizens are in their hands.
In Uganda, the Uganda Medical Association... seems to be the main spokesman...
for every doctor all over the country.
The president of our association...
In Uganda, only Amin is allowed to be called president.
You leave him to speak.
- I withdraw the title...
- I am... I...
I am General Amin.
The chairman of our association,
who is a very active person,
who I am sure was not concerted about these rumors...
which have been floating around...
about the private surgeries in town.
So much so that he was...
and ourselves seriously caught unaware...
of what is happening.
With due respect to the minister,
Your Excellency,
and your technicians in Entebbe,
I would like to tell you that our chairman...
is quite fluent with the problems affecting the doctors...
on public health.
I would, therefore,
request you, kindly and humbly,
to keep him in mind...
that, whenever there is any big problem...
that concerns a doctor,
if you take off your permanent secretary...
and if you are assistant immediate to him,
the next man to consult...
should be the chairman of the Uganda Medical Association.
Thank you very much.
I like this type of frank discussions.
And it is very good.
Um, I am sure... that I informed the permanent secretary...
I will be addressing... the senior doctors... within three days.
How did you get him so quickly?
A medical team heard the shell coming in.
Apparently, he did, too.
Chest and belly practically unmarked.
Curious how they always double up in the fetal position.
What's curious about it?
They're trying to protect their genitals.
Well, this young man unfortunately succeeded.
Any identification?
No, sir.
Then we'll assume he's ours.
I'll need to take personal charge of this case until repairs are completed.
That could be rather a long time,
Colonel Tillery.
Wouldn't you say, Captain, that it's worth a year of any doctor's life to observe a case like this?
You'd never know what has happened to him.
The one part of his brain that has escaped damage is the medulla oblongata.
It is only because of this that his heart, vasal, motor, and respiratory centers still function.
In short, that he lives.
Unidentified casualty number 4-7.
Post-operation orders,
Colonel M.F. Tillery,
U.S. Army Medical Corps.
Although the cerebellum still permits
limited physical movement,
said movement signifies nothing.
Bodily actions have become violent,
and are persistently repetitive
and must be treated as reflexive muscular spasms--
which is to say, by sedation.
The cerebrum has suffered massive and irreparable damage.
Had I not been sure of this,
I would not have permitted him to live.
There's no justification for his continued existence
unless we learn from him how to help others.
Care for him as gently
as if he knew what you were doing
and would feel the pain if you did it badly.
Attending personnel will remember that
good medical care forbids
emotional involvement with the patient.
Avoid such involvement by remembering
that it is impossible for a decerebrated individual
to experience pain, pleasure, memory,
dreams, or thought of any kind.
It follows, therefore, that this young man
will be as unfeeling, as unthinking as the dead
until the day he joins them.
Kareen?
Kareen?
What happened?
Where am I?
It's dark in here.
Shouldn't have turned the lights out.
Your old man will be sore.
Oh, Mike won't care.
He loves me.
Only could I just ask you one thing?
Why'd you have to volunteer?
Only six months from the draft anyhow.
Pinkie and Larry have already gone.
You could have been exempt because of your sisters.
My mother's got a job.
Besides, when the country needs you, you've gotta go.
You should go.
I don't think anybody should go.
They'll kill you.
Oh, I could get killed at the bakery, too, or crossing the street.
I can take care of myself.
Don't worry.
Lots of people get killed who don't think they'll be.
Lots of people come back, too.
Most of 'em.
Most of them, Joe, they never come back.
Oh, if anything ever happened to you,
I'd just die.
You're only saying that.
I love you.
I do love you.
Stop it.
I won't have this in my house.
You think you're sitting in the back seat of a flivver?
Now get up. Both of you, get up like decent people.
Come on, get up.
But he's going away in the morning.
I know, I know.
Get in the bedroom.
Both of you.
I ain't much.
25 years in the coal mines, carryin' an IWW card.
Now, what am I?
Goddamn railroad bull, that's what.
Oh, anyhow.
Go on in there with her.
She's scared.
Go-- Go on in.
- Yes, sir.
- Put your arms around her.
- You know how to treat her, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
She isn't a whore.
You know that, don't ya?
Yes, sir.
Go to bed, son.
Yes, sir.
Son.
I see you.
Nice room.
Mike fixed it up for my graduation.
Picture's crooked, though.
It was my mother's.
Why don't you take your shoes off?
Okay.
Joe.
Yeah?
Could you turn your back?
Why?
I have to get out of bed.
No. I want to see you.
I won't let you see me.
Would you get me my robe?
Sure.
It's on the closet door. It's red.
Okay.
Why'd you do that?
Hot night.
Here it is.
- Bring it closer, silly.
- Reach for it.
All right, here. I'll help you.
Let's get it through here.
There. There you go.
I'll get it right.
Here, let me show you.
Now we got it. There.
No.
- We should have flowers.
- Sure.
If you really want to see me--
Oh, if you don't want me to,
I don't want to, either.
Well, fair is fair.
Okay.
It's nice like this, isn't it?
Have you ever been this way with anyone else?
Not with anyone I loved.
I'm glad.
Have you?
You shouldn't ask that.
Why not?
Because I'm a lady.
You're a mick.
No, I've never been this way with anyone else before.
- I know.
- But you couldn't have known.
Not really.
Joe, I don't want you to go.
I want you to run away.
You don't want me to see Paris, France, that's all.
Don't go, Joe. Please don't go.
Run away.
Where to? Shipyards?
Anywhere.
I'll hide you, honest I will.
Want me to be a slacker, huh?
Yes.
Oh, they'll kill you, Joe.
I know they will.
In the words of that great patriot
Theodore Roosevelt--
I love you, Joe.
Hold me closer.
Put both your arms around me.
Both of them.
Let us pray.
Our Father--
I can't pray like that.
All I can say is dear God, don't make him go away.
- Don't let him be killed.
- I won't be.
All aboard!
All aboard!
Why don't they turn the lights on?
It's dark in here.
It's dark and still,
and I can feel the blood pumping through my veins.
But I can't hear the pulse in my ears.
If you can't hear your own pulse, you're deaf.
You're deaf, Joe.
Deaf.
Maybe not. Maybe I'm just dreaming.
Maybe-- Oh, Jesus Christ, I hurt!
I can feel the sweat pouring out of my skin.
Hot, wet skin that's all covered up with--
with bandages.
Even my head.
I sure must've caught a big one.
No.
Telephones in the middle of the night
are bad luck.
Don't let anybody answer it, Father.
What's this? Footsteps.
I can feel their vibrations.
What are they doing?
Any evidence of hypostasis while aspirating?
None thus far.
They're looking at something.
Trachea tube clear.
A hand on my chest.
He's breathing well.
No more oxygen unless an emergency develops.
I don't understand that.
Can you lift for intravenous feeling?
Good.
My face.
Is something wrong with my face?
Skin grafts will be necessary here.
Colostomy good.
Cystotomy functioning?
Very good.
What next?
- Is the ambulance ready?
- Yes, sir.
Very well. Bring him along.
Where are you taking him, sir?
Occupation forces base hospital number 3 at Jeanville St. Clears.
All right. Let's move it.
David's Perfection Bakery.
Rudy McKenna speaking.
It's Rudy.
Telephone, Joe.
Okay, coming.
Hello.
Yes, Mother. I'll be right home.
Thank you. I'll let you know
- when everything's finished, okay?
- Okay, Joe.
I'll be back to work in a couple days.
That's all right. Rest up. Good night.
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm sorry I lost your fishing pole, too.
I loved you.
Well, the bandages are off my arm.
It itches.
I wish they'd scratch it.
What happens now?
Yes, we can remove the sutures.
Let's disinfect.
I wish they'd get this stuff off my face
so I could see what they're doing.
- Sorry, sir.
- Another.
They're pinching me.
No, it's more like a--
a little stab of heat.
Wait a minute. I know.
It's just like when I ran into
the barbed-wire fence and cut my eyebrow.
They sew you up, and then it heals,
and then they take the stitches out.
Only-- Well, only this is different.
I can feel what they're doing to my arm,
but I can't feel the end of my arm at all.
The nearest thing to the end of my arm
is the heel of my hand.
The heel of my hand, the end of my arm.
It's too high.
It's high as my shoulder.
- You've cut off my arm!
- The tissues have closed.
- My arm! Oh, my God.
- Remove the wrist.
Why did you do a thing like that?
I need that arm.
Oh, I've gotta work with it. I--
You can't go around cutting a man's arm off,
like you were pruning dead branches off a tree!
Well, there's a law or something!
You've gotta get his consent
before you do a thing like that.
He's gotta sign a paper
because a man with only one arm
is a cripple, and-- and all he can do
is go around selling pencils!
Oh, no! Not my other arm, too!
No, no! Please, no.
You've already taken one of my arms--
I want him moved to the least conspicuous room you can find, for his own good.
A room with a lock and something over the windows so they can't peer in at him.
There isn't a decent unoccupied room in the building.
Utility room? Supply room?
Store room? Anything.
He can't tell the difference.
Put someone in here who can.
There's a game out there,
and the stakes are high.
And the guy who runs it figures the averages
all day long and all night long.
Once in a while, he lets you steal a pot.
But if you stay in the game long enough,
you've got to lose.
And once you've lost, there's no way back.
No way at all.
Hit me.
Pay 20.
Christ, I sure could do with a shot of whiskey.
Help yourself.
Bets down.
How'd you learn that?
I used to do it at weddings.
Hey, can you do card tricks, too?
Sure.
Cards to the gamblers.
Hit me.
I'm just fine.
Boy, I'm just fine.
Hit me.
Stan?
Hit me, but not too hard.
Now, watch him get 21.
Pay 21.
It's a funny thing,
I can do almost everything but hit a 12.
12 shouldn't be any harder to hit then a 13, should it?
Shouldn't be, but it is.
That's nothing but superstition.
A 12 to hit is just the same as any other number above it, only better.
Don't let anybody tell you different.
Assembly. What time is it anyhow?
Three Christmases and 41 days.
Time to go.
If I don't make that train, I miss--
I miss a date to be killed on the 27th of June at 4:30 a.m. in the morning.
Not too good for my kid, huh?
He's only a year, eight months, and smart as hell already.
Sure wish I could see him when he was 5.
You'll see him when he's 50.
And you'll still be 23.
What the hell?
We're all gonna be killed.
That's what we're here for.
He's already got his.
And the big Swede here, he's gonna catch flu and die on shipboard.
I'm gonna get buried in a trench cave-in and smothered to death.
Now, isn't that a hell of way to go?
Jeez.
All aboard!
Next stop, New York,
Atlantic Ocean, and Paris, France!
What's this guy doing here?
He ain't gonna get killed.
Leave him alone. He's all right.
Come on, boys. On your feet.
We've got to make that train.
Are you going with us?
Of course.
I've got lots of trains to handle.
Lots of dead men.
So many dead men, you wouldn't believe it.
Not my legs! Not my legs, too!
Oh, God, no.
Not my legs, too.
Help me, somebody.
Help me.
Don't let them cut my legs off.
Don't let them take my legs, too.
Jesus.
They just went ahead and chopped off everything.
Of course, it's a lot cheaper
to cut a leg off than fix it up.
With a war going on, they haven't got much time.
Everybody is tired.
But, what kind of doctor would cut a man down
to what I am now
and still let him live?
Do they have a bet on?
Were they showing off or something?
Was it some kind of experiment?
No.
Nobody would do a thing like that
to another man.
Nobody could be such a butcher.
My dear students, war has various meanings to various persons.
To the scientist, war means that he is actually set free to accomplish his most brilliant and most imaginative enterprises.
For example, in previous wars, each injury has resulted in a very serious loss to the taxpayers, the loss of a most expensively trained soldier-- or fighting unit, as we call him now.
However, in the next war, we shall be able to repair and deliver that same fighting unit to the frontline trenches in three weeks or even less.
And all because of the radical new techniques which this young man has taught us.
I'm having a nightmare that says I'm real.
Wake me up, Mother, and tell me I'm not real.
I don't know where you are, my son,
or what troubles you.
Try to remember that God is the only reality,
and that you are made in his image and likeness.
And since you are the perfect reflection
of God's reality,
you are real.
You're wrong, Mother.
It's a dream.
It's got to be.
Everything else is true, but not this.
No, I remember the real things, Mother.
Even before we left Colorado and moved to Los Angeles.
I remember everything.
You hurt yourself, son?
Let's see.
Oh, honestly.
Someday those feet are gonna get so dirty, they'll never wash clean.
From now on,
I'm gonna take my baths at the YMCA, the way Daddy does.
For behold, I bring you tidings of great joy that shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a savior, which is Christ the Lord.
And suddenly there was with the angel--
See those rocks over there?
A long time ago, they caught a hunting party of Ute Indians there.
Know what they did?
Rounded 'em up, tied rocks around their feet, and threw 'em in the lake.
About where we are now.
The, uh, fishing on this side of the lake's been good ever since.
Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, by Mary Baker Eddy.
"All is infinite mind
"and its infinite manifestation.
"Matter is mortal error.
"Spirit is the real and eternal.
"Matter is the unreal and temporal.
"Spirit is God,
"and man is his image and likeness.
"Therefore, man is not material.
He is spiritual."
Those were the real things, Mother.
What I am now is in a dream.
There is no more reality
to the waking dream of mortal existence
than there is to the dream we have in sleep.
Reality is God.
And the essence of God is love--
that perfect love
which banishes all fear
and heals all wounds.
Stop it. I don't want to hear anymore
- about God is love.
- Prepare an injection.
Because If I do,
I'll begin to hate him.
- When did you aspirate him last?
Gavage feeding?
2:00 and again at 4.
No, no. Don't put me under again.
I've gotta figure some way out of this mess.
Father, I need help.
I'm in terrible trouble, and I need help.
Father? Did you hear me?
Father?
I hear ya, son.
But I got troubles of my own.
Nothing I have in this world is really any good, you know?
My house is small.
My job is small.
My salary is also small.
Son is small. So is my wife, and get right down to it,
I'm no giant, myself.
Everything around me is small, inferior, except this fishing pole.
I, myself, wind it every year with the best of silk thread.
See this lacquer?
Comes from China.
No finer lacquer in the world.
See those guides?
Pure amber.
Nobody in town has a fishing pole like this.
Not even Mr. Ladamer down at the bank.
My life is so poor and shoddy that without this pole, why,
I'd have nothing to set me apart from other men.
Nothing to give me distinction, nothing at all.
That's why I love it so much.
Do you love it more than you love me?
'Course I do.
What is there about you that can give a man distinction?
You're not unusual at all.
Yes I am, Father.
How's that?
I may not be unusual now, but I'm going to be.
Of course you are.
You're gonna make the world safe for democracy, aren't ya?
What is democracy?
Well, I was never very clear on it, myself.
Like every other kind of government, it's got something to do with young men killing each other, I believe.
Why don't old men kill each other?
Well, the old men are needed to keep the home fires burning.
Couldn't the young men do that just as well?
Young men don't have homes.
That's why they must go out and kill each other.
When it comes my turn, will you want me to go?
For democracy, any man would give his only begotten son.
I wouldn't.
I won't be here to stop you, Joe.
Put your arms around me.
I need their warmth to keep the chill of death away.
I can't.
Please?
No!
Well...
I guess it always comes down to that.
Each man faces death by himself.
Alone.
From now on, it's a simple matter of good nursing care,
I can always be reached at GHQ if anything develops.
Let's try the mask.
Thank God. They're finally getting
this stuff off my face.
The air feels good.
Feels cool.
Repairs seem to have healed well.
What's this?
You see?
Works very well.
Any questions?
Good luck.
It's better.
It does let the air in.
But I thought when they unbandaged my face,
I'd be all healed.
She's cleaning my breathing tube.
I thought when they took this stuff off my face,
they'd take the tubes out, too.
But they didn't.
I don't understand.
Where is she going now?
Oh, yes. I know.
I've still got my feeding tube.
When am I gonna be able to feed myself?
When am I going to get well?
Dinner's over.
But it won't always be like this, will it?
Now wait.
Think for a minute.
There's something funny here--
something cool, something wet.
I thought my face was just wrapped up,
when they unwrapped it, I could--
Oh, please, I--
Now, get a hold of yourself, Joe.
Don't lose your head.
Your jaws.
You can't move your jaws.
They don't work.
You haven't got any.
Well, take your tongue, rub it around inside your teeth
like you were chasing a raspberry seed.
I-- I haven't got any tongue!
I-- I haven't got any teeth for it to feel.
I haven't got anything here but a hole.
How big is it?
How-- How does it go?
Now don't panic.
Think.
Inside of the hole is-- is wet.
The edges of it are dry.
Wet, dry.
Yes, that's it.
Now, figure out where it's dry.
Feel. Yes.
I'm feeling.
Dry-- And shouldn't the hole go up?
Up.
No eyes.
I haven't got any eyes
or mouth or teeth, tongue, or nose.
I haven't gotten anything,
but my whole face is scooped out!
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's me, and I'm alive!
Oh, no. It can't be!
Not me! I-- I can't live like this!
I-- I can't.
Please, no, I can't-- I can't!
Help me. Somebody please help me.
Mother, where are ya?
Help me, Mother.
I'm having a nightmare
and I can't wake up.
If you don't wake me up
I'll be like this for years
and years
and years.
Pray for me, please.
Please, pray for me.
To all those in the armed forces who sacrificed their young lives in this just and holy war for everlasting peace,
I grant absolution of all their sins.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, amen.
Let us pray.
A place like this, you've gotta think
in order to keep from thinking.
There are eight planets,
Earth, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter,
Mercury-- What's that?
There's something chewing on my forehead.
It's a rat!
It's one of those great big fat trench rats.
Help me, somebody. Kill it!
No, couldn't be a rat.
They wouldn't let rats run around
chewing up the customers in a place like this.
It's a dream.
No, it isn't.
It is a rat.
It's crawling. It's crawling.
No. No, no, no, no.
Don't-- Don't let it get me.
No. No, no. No, no, no.
He's close.
He's on my chest.
Don't even scare him.
Hold still and he will--
Where'd it go?
Did somebody kill it?
Or did it just go away?
What if it comes back?
It was a dream.
It had to be.
But how can you tell
what's a dream and what's real
when you can't even tell when you're awake
and when you're asleep?
Or maybe the rat's real
and the nurse here is a dream.
Oh, Jesus Christ, how can I ever be able to tell the difference?
The thing to do is yell.
Sometimes, even now,
I have this old dream that somebody wants to kill me.
And my mother and father are running away with me to Egypt.
I hear the sound of soldiers riding at night and the screams.
And I yell.
And the yell wakes me up.
And then I know that it's a dream.
So what you have to do is yell.
But, you see, I can't yell.
I can't even whisper.
Well, whispering wouldn't help anyhow.
Another way is just to tell yourself
"Wait a minute, here.
This is a nightmare.
"And I have to wake up in order to stop it."
Then just force your eyes open, and the dream will be gone.
Oh, I can't open my eyes.
I haven't got any.
Well, that complicates things.
Maybe the thing to do is police your mind before you go to sleep.
Say to yourself,
"I'm going to sleep now.
"And I'm not going to have any nightmares."
Could be done, you know?
With practice.
You feel yourself getting drowsy--
I never feel drowsy.
I haven't got anything to feel drowsy with.
Nothing?
Maybe we should take a different line of attack, altogether.
Let us begin by assuming that everything is a dream, which by and large, it is.
When we're awake, we have one kind of dream.
When we're asleep, we have another.
The difference is that we control our daydreams.
And the dream that comes at night controls us.
Now think about that.
When you dream that the rat is there, do you control the dream?
Or does the dream control you?
It controls me.
Yes, exactly.
If the rat were really there, you'd knock it off, wouldn't you?
Of course.
So the fact that you don't knock it off proves that it really is a dream.
Yes, yes.
I--
That doesn't work.
Even if the rat was real,
I couldn't knock it off because I haven't got any arms.
No arms.
I haven't got anything.
I'm just like a piece of meat that keeps on living.
Since your real life-- is a greater nightmare than your dreams, it would be cruel to pretend that anyone could help you.
What you need is a miracle.
No, not a miracle.
Just tell me that the rat is real.
And the way I am now is a dream.
Perhaps it would be better for you to go away now.
You're a very unlucky young man, and sometimes it rubs off.
I'll go, but first tell me just one thing.
Are you and I really here together?
Or is this a dream, too?
- It's a dream.
- How do you know?
- Because I'm a dream.
- I don't believe you.
Nobody does.
That's why I'm as unreal as every other dream that didn't come true.
I don't know whether
I'm alive and dreaming
or dead and remembering.
Am I getting old?
Is my hair turning gray?
Will anybody ever come to visit me?
I hope not.
I really wouldn't want anybody
to see me like this.
I do get homesick, though.
Oh, but they wouldn't have shipped me that long way home.
Not with all these tubes and things in me.
No, I'm probably in some frog hospital,
or maybe limey.
At least my teeth don't ache.
Wait a minute. What's this?
There are two vibrations,
and one of them is heavy.
It's a man.
Why are the shutters closed?
They always have been.
At least, as long as I've been here.
It's on the order sheet.
Well, it's crazy.
Well, what are you doing?
Hello? Have I got visitors?
What happened then?
As long as I'm head nurse of this ward, the shutters are open and they will stay open.
Let him have a little sunshine.
They said it was to keep people from peeking in at him.
It would take a man 7 feet tall to peek through that window.
Oh, and another thing.
I want sheets on this bed.
- He's walking. 
- No more blankets.
He can't really tell the difference, you know.
- Now he's stopped. 
- I can.
Well.
How did the triage officer ever overlook this one?
He's looking at me.
Poor baby.
No, it's a woman.
Those hands, a fat woman.
That's why I could feel her footsteps so plain.
Poor-- Poor baby.
Come on.
That was funny.
What were they doing?
What has happened?
What's different?
Think, Joe.
Think. Use your head.
Feel. Feel with your scalp
and the skin on your forehead.
Something has changed.
It was cooler before she came in than it is now.
What I feel is-- is warmth.
But where does it come from?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Of course.
Oh, my God. I see it now.
It-- It's the sun.
The sun, the sun, the sun.
I found the sun.
Thank you, God.
Thank you. Thank you.
If I never have anything else,
I'll always have God and the morning sunlight.
It's night.
If a man can tell the difference
between day and night,
he's beginning to tell time.
It's warm again. It's morning,
and she's changing my sheets.
Now it's night.
Morning again. She's bathing me.
One morning she changes me,
the next morning, she bathes me.
Night, night.
Day. Night.
How will I keep track?
I know. Put a big blackboard up in your mind.
And right here in the middle,
put a mark for each day.
Four, six, seven days.
Now, put a mark up in this corner for the weeks.
Erase the days. Start over again.
Three, four weeks. That's right!
Erase the weeks and mark down
a month over here.
5, 9, 11, 12 months.
Now that isn't a year, not yet.
Four twelves is only 48.
Okay, check off four more weeks,
very carefully.
And then put Roman numeral number 1
right down here. One year!
I'm ringing bells!
Hey, I'm blowing horns
and shooting off firecrackers.
Everybody's singing
"Should old acquaintance be forgot."
And I'm saying--
I'm saying, "Happy New Year, Kareen."
And I'm kissing her.
But it isn't New Year's Day out there.
Sure, I've counted a year,
but a year from when?
I don't even know how old I am.
All I know is I'm 20 years old,
plus X years since I got blown up,
plus the year I just counted.
But when did those X years begin?
Think, Joe. Think back.
We were next to an English regiment.
And we went out on night patrol and scattered.
And then I hooked up
with that little limey corporal
and his outfit, and--
Yes, I remember now.
I was writing a letter to you, Kareen.
Corporal Timlon?
Yes, sir?
What is that damnable odor?
Out there, sir.
This fat Hun came stumbling through the fog.
Some bloke lost his head and popped him off.
The stink ain't half so bad when they're close to the ground, sir, but he's got himself hung up on the wire.
Bad for morale. Extremely bad.
He's a Bavarian, sir.
They always smell worse.
Yes, they do, don't they?
Not so bad as Hindu is, though.
Or Welshmen.
While it's nice and quiet, sir, we keep on trying to shoot him down, but he hangs on pretty good.
Well, take a detail out tonight, Corporal.
And bury him.
Well, but it's kind of busy out there, sir.
Even at night.
And don't forget, Corporal.
Death has a dignity all its own.
And you will say a few words of prayer over the remains.
Yes.
Oh, Jesus!
Just for that, I'll take volunteers.
You. You. You.
You two. You in the back there.
And to almighty God, we commend the soul of our brother departed, and we commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Who's got the dust?
It's kinda wet, but--
I have--
Well, throw the bloody stuff in. Go on.
Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
God have mercy on his soul!
The bloody bastards have shot me in the ass!
Take cover, men.
If it's prayers he wants, he can make up his own.
Oh, Jesus.
I shouldn't have been there at all.
Or that poor Bavarian, either.
For all I know,
we might have been friends.
Instead of him dead,
out there in the mud.
And me, lying here like...
like some freak in a carnival show.
Remember that time in Los Angeles,
when we all went to the circus,
and took Kareen with us, too?
And when we got home, the old man began
imitating those sideshow barkers?
And the rest of us joined in, too?
He was a funny man!
Just think what he could have done with me,
the way I am now.
I eat... through a tube!
He breathes through a tube.
And whatever goes in a tube has to come out through a tube.
He is the armless, legless wonder of the 20th century!
And yet, by God, he's just as alive as you and me!
He was a good boy.
He was always forgetting things!
And it's this fellow right here!
But he don't worry about no shoes.
'Cause he don't need no shoes!
He'd forget his overshoes.
No shoes! No shirt!
No socks!
No gloves! No hat!
He would forget his cap.
No necktie! No collar buttons!
No vest! No coat! No nothing!
And now... he's forgotten... just everything.
All you gotta do is drop a love offering of 15 cents or more in this little lady's thunder mug.
And I'll you what I'm gonna do!
I'm gonna lift the lid of this box here, and I'm gonna let you look at the face of the only man in the world who don't give a damn about anything.
And remember!
It only cost ya 15 cents.
And if this guy looks back at you, by golly, I'll give ya a five dollar bill.
All right! Bring on the music, Rollo Boy!
Okay! Step right up!
Step right up, folks!
Step right up.
Hurry, hurry, hurry. hurry.
Get a close look at the man who can't--
- Thank you.
- Or maybe he can!
Thank you.
Thank you.
See that little lady?
Make her pot ring out like the bells of St. Mary!
- Glory, glory, glory!
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What's this?
A different nurse?
Why does she walk without vibrations?
Is she tip-toeing?
Or-- Or is she just--
little?
Something fell on me.
Something wet. What was it?
She must be new.
She is new.
Her hands are soft, like Kareen's.
She's a girl, and I don't make her sick.
She isn't afraid of me.
Hello, new nurse.
Hello, new beautiful young nurse.
Hello out there.
Kareen.
Oh, Kareen...
where are you?
We only made love to each other one time
in our-- in our whole lives.
Joe-oe...
Joe-oe...
Come out to the garden in the pale moonlight!
Is that you, Kareen?
Hello, Joe.
I had to get married.
So now I'm somebody else's Kareen.
Then where's mine?
In the pale moonlight, where she said she'd be.
Kareen?
Why did you bring me to a place like this?
I didn't.
I heard you calling.
I called, and I called.
And you never came.
I was held up.
How late am I?
How long have I been away?
I don't know.
It may have been forever, though.
I can't remember.
Well, try, Kareen.
Please try.
You see, I don't know how long I've been here.
I don't know what year I'm in.
And I'm trying to get back into-- into time.
I don't pay much attention to time any more.
Oh, you must.
All I think about is time.
Time is what makes people old.
The way I am, Kareen, the way it is with me, you'll never grow old.
Because I keep you right here in my mind.
And in my heart.
Just the way you were when I saw you last.
So you see, with me, you can't get old.
Your hair will always stay brown.
Your skin will always be fresh like rain.
I won't let one little wrinkle mark your face.
I'll keep you beside me, young and beautiful forever.
Because of all the people in the world, only with me will you be safe from time.
Like a fresh, fresh flower.
- Like a rose--
- I'm not! I'm not!
Nobody loves me anymore!
Oh, I do, Kareen.
Stop that. What happened to you?
Don't even know how to treat her.
Then you got her pregnant, went away, and stopped writing to her.
I didn't know! I couldn't write!
Bye, Joe.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Joe!
- Kareen!
- Goodbye, Joe...
Don't let them take you, Joe...
Run away!
Goodbye, Joe...
Can't you tell me how long it's been?
No...
Can't you tell me where I am?
No...
Can't you even tell me what country I'm in?
No country...
Well...
I can feel them wheeling my old bed out.
And I am in a new one.
With a pillow.
What next?
She's moving me.
Yes.
Ah, into the sunlight.
Now she's in back of me.
That tube.
I never did understand that one.
Now my table.
What else?
Good.
Good.
I wonder if she's an American.
I hope so.
I've only seen one American girl
since I left home.
I'm as American as apple pie.
I was born in San Francisco.
Didn't I tell you?
I was there when the earthquake hit in 1906.
Believe me, that was a shake.
I was up on the fourth floor of a hotel on Market Street, entertaining a gentleman friend.
And when I first heard that thing hit,
I said to myself,
I said, "Lucky," I said.
"That's an earthquake.
"And you ain't gonna be caught dead with no fat son of a bitch on top of ya like this."
So you know what I did?
I pushed him off and ran stark naked down the street.
And you shoulda seen the guys stare.
I'll bet.
Yeah.
You aren't wanting to do anything now,
I guess, huh?
Ah, too tired.
That's what that French cognac will do to ya.
It'll be $2.00, just the same.
Okay.
What are you knitting there?
Sweater for my kid.
He's only 5 years old.
And the sweetest little bastard you ever saw.
Where is he?
Oh, I keep him in a school in Long Island.
That's in New York.
A private school.
They got lots of polo players there.
And that's what I want him to be when he grows up.
Once you're a polo player, you meet all the best people.
Did you know that?
- You asleep?
- No.
Must have... cost you a lot of money.
A school like that.
Oh, sure it does!
But I don't do too bad here.
I make about a hundred bucks a week.
Of course... you got to dress up to your position, and that takes money.
Kareen?
Kareen...
Oh, Kareen.
Hello, Bill.
Hi, Mr. Bonham.
Bill hasn't got a pole, and he's only here for the afternoon.
And I thought maybe he could borrow yours.
We could borrow yours.
Sure.
Hey, but, uh-- give Bill your pole, and you take mine.
Oh, sure.
We'll be back before dark.
- Thank you, Mr. Bonham.
- Yeah.
Father.
Yes?
I lost your pole today, Father.
Got a quick strike, and before we knew, your pole was in the water.
And-- we hunted around for it, fished with the oars, but-- but we couldn't find it, so it's gone.
Well...
Shouldn't let a fishing pole... spoil our last trip together, should we?
No.
I'll go on ahead.
Catch us a ride into town.
I won't be long.
Hello?
Is it you?
The one I love?
Yes.
What's this?
What are you doing?
One up. One down.
One up. One down again.
Oh, God, no.
It can't be! It can't!
Are you talking to me out there?
Are you saying something to me?
Are you drawing a letter on my skin, and then erasing it?
A word?
You are. You are.
You are! Yes, you are!
It's a letter M!
Yes. Oh, God bless you, nurse!
I got it! M!
E.
R.
R.
Y. Yes.
Yes, of course I've got it!
Merry!
I'm trying to tell you.
Merry Christmas.
C.
H.
R.
I.
S.
T.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Oh, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, God.
I've got a date to count from!
By counting Christmases,
I can tell when it's spring!
I can tell when it's summer!
I can smell leaves burning in autumn.
Oh, Merry Christmas, sweet nurse.
Merry Christmas to you.
Merry Christmas, and all my love!
Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!
I'm the boss. This is champagne.
Merry Christmas.
I'm the boss. This is champagne.
Merry Christmas.
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.
Merry Christmas.
- Where's my boy?
- I'm the boss.
- Where's my little boy?
- This is champagne.
- Merry Christmas.
- He's too young.
- Can't you see--
- I'm the boss.
- he's underage?
- This is champagne.
- Merry Christmas!
- He just came up from Tucson.
I'm the boss.
- This is champagne.
- His name is--
- Merry Christmas.
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm the boss.
- And today is his birthday.
Merry Christmas.
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.
Merry Christmas.
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.
Merry Christmas.
Might I cut in?
I have influence.
- Merry Christmas.
- I can get you a soft berth.
I can be of great help.
- Merry Christmas.
- I can help myself.
That's what you think.
But everything has changed.
The time has come for you to go out and fight.
Are you going to fight, too?
- Merry Christmas.
- I'm overaged. I can't.
But somebody's got to fight them.
- Merry Christmas.
- We must have a just and lasting peace!
- Merry Christmas.
- We've already got ours.
Damn right.
See these? Two arms.
- Merry Christmas.
- You see these?
Two legs.
You see this?
One girl.
- Merry Christmas.
- What else does anyone want?
I'm the boss.
- This is champagne.
- Liberty.
And justice.
- Merry Christmas.
- Liberty.
And justice.
- Liberty.
- I love you, Kareen.
- Merry Christmas.
- You're so lucky, Joe. You are.
You don't understand.
I have to make the world safe.
This is champagne.
Merry Christmas.
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.
Merry Christmas.
- I'm the boss.
- You're not my boy.
This is champagne.
Where's my boy?
- Merry Christmas.
- Kareen?
Where's my little boy?
Kareen?
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.
Merry Christmas!
Fellow workers.
Fellow workers?
Fellow workers!
Due to the war emergency, our little holiday will end in just three more minutes.
But the ovens are hot, and we must keep the home fires burning.
Let us sing.
Keep the home fires burning
While our hearts are yearning
Though your lads
Are far away
They dream of home
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining
Turn the dark clouds inside out
Till the boys come
Home
Father.
Hello, son.
Hello, Father.
Want some honey?
No, thanks.
Sit down.
Goodbye, Joe.
Who was that girl?
I really don't know.
I was fishing. She happened by.
Wriggled into my arms and stayed there.
So many young girls these days seem to be hunting for a place in old men's arms.
Where did all the young men go?
They drift away.
How is it with you, Father?
It's all right.
You know, it's a funny thing.
I was a very good shoe clerk.
But I was more than that.
I could handle a horse.
If I had a cow, she was always healthy, gave plenty of milk.
Raised our own food on two city lots.
Even up to the honey on our biscuits.
I could, uh, hoe a pretty good row... lay out a pretty good grade on an uphill road.
Build a house.
But I never did learn how to make any money.
The goddamndest thing
I ever ran into.
See, the trouble with life is you work so much, you don't enjoy it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Better this way.
Except...
I do miss your mother.
How is she?
I haven't seen her lately.
Well... not too long till sunrise.
I have to go.
Trout'll be rising.
Willow Lake.
Now that I got my pole back,
I don't want to miss 'em.
Goodbye, Father.
Give my love to your mother when you see her.
Sorry I had to leave you in the lurch, but it was the only way, believe me.
Goodbye.
Joe.
Joe.
Here I am.
No, Joe. Over here.
Let's play blindman's bluff.
Joe.
Find me, Joe.
Why did you leave me, Joe?
Run, Joe.
Why didn't you write me?
I couldn't write you!
I just couldn't!
Why couldn't you?
I can't tell you!
That's all! I can't!
You don't love me, Joe.
You don't love me.
I do love you!
I do love you!
No, you don't, Joe.
You never did.
Don't go, Kareen!
Where are you?
Olly olly oxen free!
Don't go away from me again.
Please.
Don't.
You need help, son.
There isn't any help.
Have you asked for any?
I can't.
I can't ask for anything.
There is no way I can talk to them.
Then why don't you send a telegram?
A telegram?
Don't you remember when you were little?
How you and Bill Harper used to string a wire between the two houses so you could telegraph to each other?
Yes.
Still remember the Morse code?
Yes.
What good is that?
How can I type out a message to them?
You've got to learn to think.
Use your head.
Yes.
Yes. My head.
My head. My head, my head!
Yes.
Yes. My head.
My head.
Where is she going?
- Captain?
- Yes?
Could you come here a minute, please?
Yes, of course.
Would you take care of that, nurse? Thank you.
She's brought somebody in!
I can't understand what he's doing.
May I see the orders, please?
Yes.
Thank you.
Probably an early entry.
"If bodily action becomes violent or persistently repetitive"--
These movements are persistently repetitive.
"They must be treated as reflexive muscular spasms."
Which is to say by sedation.
Fair enough. I'll prepare an injection.
Why is she trying to stop me?
I don't believe that the movement is reflexive.
Oh, you don't?
Well, General Tillery will pass through on the 23rd with his annual staff inspection.
If you don't trust me, nurse, perhaps you'd better take it up with him.
I will.
Well, that's excellent, nurse.
General Tillery is the chief operating surgeon who wrote those orders.
No. No.
Don't give me dope.
- Don't put me under again.
- Would you unlock the door, please?
I'm trying to talk to you.
Oh, God, please make them hear me.
All I'm asking is for you to take one little idea
that's in my mind and put it into their minds.
Maybe only 2 or 3 feet away from me.
It's-- It's such a little thing to ask,
but they won't listen.
They won't hear me.
All they do is give me dope,
and I go down
and down
and...
Oh, there you are, brothers.
What were you hunting when they caught you?
Look, Father!
I found your fishing pole!
Use your head, son.
I am, Father. I am.
Hear me.
Please try to understand what I'm doing and hear me!
She did hear me!
She's going to get somebody!
She didn't even close the door!
I've broken through.
I'm back with people again.
Hello, all you people out there.
It's me, and we're going to talk to each other.
They're here. A lot of them.
It's Morse code.
For what?
SOS. Help.
Do you mean to say that this man is actually speaking to us?
What are they doing?
Yes, sir.
Decerebrated, General?
Completely decerebrated?
What are they waiting for?
What's happening?
Are they leaving?
No.
Just one of them.
Or maybe two.
No. Just one.
Ask what he wants.
How can I ask a man like this a question like that?
By asking it.
How else can we help him?
Why don't they do something?
- They are.
- What... do... you... want?
What do I want?
What do I want?
What I want...
I want out!
I want to feel fresh air against my skin.
I want to feel people around me.
No.
It would cost too much money
taking care of me on the outside.
They never do that.
But-- But maybe there's a way
I can take care of myself.
Yes! There is a way!
All you have to do is put me on display
and people will pay to see me.
Lots of people.
Put me in a fancy coffin
with windows in it, and take me out where people
are spending money and having fun.
Take me to the beaches and the county fairs
and the 4th of July celebrations
and all the church bazaars.
They've seen the pin-headed girl from Timbuktu
or the dog-faced man
who crawls on his belly like a reptile.
But they're not real freaks.
They were born that way.
They were made that way by God.
But this thing here in his fancy coffin
was made by people--
by you and me and the lady next door--
and that takes a lot of planning
and costs a lot of money.
Advertise me as the only piece of meat in the world
that can talk through the back of its head.
And if that doesn't pull them in, then-- then-- then--
then bill me as the last man on earth who joined the Army.
Because the army makes men.
So rally around the flag, boys--
your flag, their flag, anybody's flag--
because the flag needs soldiers,
and the army makes men.
I... want... out... so... people... can... see... what... I am.
Put me... in... a... c-carnival... show... where they... can... look... at me.
Let... me out.
Well, what could we have expected?
Tell him, uh...
Tell him we'll do everything we can, but, uh, his condition won't permit him to be moved.
For the present, that is.
Be sure to say "for the present."
If... you... won't... let... people see me, then... kill me.
He's upset. Understandably so.
Ask him what his name is.
These shutters are to be closed at all times.
What's he saying?
He says, "Kill me."
Over and over again. "Kill me."
Tell him we'll do everything we can to make him comfortable.
For now, he needs rest.
Tell him we'll give him a sedative and come back later.
And try to get his name.
You're not to mention what has happened here to anyone.
I'll hold you collectively responsible for any breach.
If new orders are received in view of the new situation which has developed, you'll be notified.
Well?
He won't wait for an answer.
All he says is
"Kill me, kill me, kill me."
Don't you have some message for him, Padre?
You could at least tell him to put his faith in God, couldn't you?
I'll pray for him for the rest of my days, but I will not risk testing his faith against your stupidity.
Well, you're a hell of a priest, aren't you?
He's the product of your profession, not mine.
Clear the room.
Give him a light sedative, nurse.
They're going away. Why?
Why don't they get it over with and kill me?
But you're still here.
Can't you see what I'm tapping to you?
I'm asking you to kill me.
Please do.
O my God,
I'm heartily sorry for having offended thee.
And I detest all my sins, not because of Thy judgment, O Lord, but because thou art all good and deserving of all my love.
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, to avoid all the occasions of sin.
Amen.
Oh, nurse--
beautiful, beautiful nurse--
thank you,
thank you, thank you.
Dear God, thank her for me.
Be sweet to her, God.
Make her happy.
Make her beautiful.
Make everything she wants come true!
Make everyone love her!
No!
No.
Leave the room.
Oh, somebody stopped her.
Why?
I said, "Leave the room."
Give me the key.
What's happening?
The key?
Go on.
She's going.
I can feel her moving toward the door.
He's sending her away.
Why?
First they close the shutters,
and now they're sending her away.
Why did they close the shutters?
Why is he sending her away?
Why won't they let me talk?
Because I'm a secret or something?
Oh, I don't know.
She's gone.
Good-bye, nurse.
You're gone,
and I'm a secret.
Oh, no. Not that again.
I-- I thought they'd be glad
that I found a way to--
to talk to them.
But they're not.
The only thing on this earth
I'm any good for
they won't let me do.
All they want is to push me
back into the darkness down here
so they won't ever see me again.
He's gone, too.
Well, now I know.
They'll never let me out.
They'll keep me a secret here until someday,
when I'm an old, old man,
I'll sneak away from them and die.
It isn't easy, though.
Inside me, I'm screaming and yelling
and howling like a trapped animal...
and nobody pays any attention.
If I had arms,
I could kill myself.
If I had legs,
I could run away.
If I had a voice,
I could talk and be some kind of company for myself.
I could yell for help.
But nobody'd help me.
Not even God, because there isn't any God.
Couldn't be in a place like this.
And, uh...
And yet,
I've just got to do something
because I--
I don't see how I can
go on like this
much longer.
SOS.
Help me.
SOS.
Help me.
SOS.
Help me.
SOS.
Help me.
SOS.
Help me.
SOS.
Help me.
SOS.
Help me.
SOS.
Help me.
Down !

- It's an old lndian thing.
You're full of shit.
Stanley, would I shit you about something like that ?
You know, Mike, there's times when nobody but a doctor can understand you.
That's an omen, you know that ?

[ Nick ] Mike, I don't know where you come up with all this.
- [ Steven ] Hey, wait a minute.

[ Whispers ]

[ Sighs ]
Oh, my God.
I still do not believe this.
My own boy with a strange girl.
And not so thin, if you understand my meaning. Not such a thin girl.
The next thing you know, he goes to Vietnam.
[ Sighs ]
[ Speaking Russian ]
I do not understand, Father.
[ Sighs ] I understand nothing anymore. Nothing !
Why ?
[ Weeping Continues ]
Why ?
Can you explain ?
Can anyone explain ?
- Pass him on the inside.

[ Mike ]
Shut up.

You can't make it.
[ Stan ] Hey, hey, Axel, you owe him a window.
[ Steven ] Mike ! Mike !
Hey, mighty Mike !
- Oh, Axel.
- Here's your truck back.
[ Steven ] Oh, hell, I hope he didn't break an axle.
I wouldn't want to take advantage of you.
It's a million-to-one shot against a sure thing.
- There's no such thing as a sure thing.
- Yeah.
- [ Stan ] Did you see that ?
- [ Stan ] Hey, Boom !
- [ Axel ] Hey, how ya doin' ?
[ Phone Ringing ]
Don't take anybody's money !

[ Nick ]
Give him a short one.
And give my friends down here my warm regards.

And the Steelers win by what ? Twenty.
I got an extra 20 says the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress !
[ John ] Take your money off the bar.
Drinks are on the house !

- No. I don't know.
Come on, Amy !
Come on !
Uh, Joe, maybe we could use some more flags.

Wouldn't you say so ?

I mean, here I go.
There's no sense in gettin' too relaxed, buddy.

Is your heart so cruel, so unfeeling ?
You marry this girl.
You leave her with me.
And you go with these bums to the Vietnam !
- Ow. Ow.
- Bullshit.
* And if it's quite all right *
- One flight !
It's one flight upstairs !
- [ Speaking Russian ]
- When I come home-- One flight.
- [ Speaking Russian ]
I love Angela.
And she loves me.
Wear a scarf today !
You don't wear a scarf with a tuxedo.
- I'm not gonna wear a scarf with a tuxedo.
- [ Speaking Russian ]
- You tryin' to look like a prince ?
- What do you mean "trying" ?
You should've done that a long time ago.
- That way, it would've set.
- I know.
- Then why didn't you do it ?
- 'Cause I forgot.
- [ Axel ] Oh, man.
Steven's gettin' married in a couple of hours.
We're talkin' about huntin' the last time before the army.
The whole thing, it's crazy.
I'll tell ya one thing.
If I found out my life had to end up in the mountains,
I'd be all right.
But it has to be in your mind.
What ?
One shot ?
Two is pussy.
I don't think about one shot that much anymore, Mike.
You have to think about one shot.
One shot is what it's all about.
A deer has to be taken with one shot.
I try to tell people that.
They don't listen.
- You really think about Vietnam ?
- Yeah.
I don't know. I guess.
I'm thinkin' about the deer.
Going to Nam.
I like the trees, you know ?
I like the way the trees are in the mountains, all the different--
The way the trees are.
I sound like some asshole, right ?
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy
I go huntin' with, you know ?
I like a guy with quick moves and speed.
I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.
- Well, who's an asshole ?
- Who's an asshole ?
Who do you think's an asshole ?
They're all a bunch of assholes.
I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys, but without you, I'd hunt alone.
- Seriously, that's what I'd do.
- Well, you're a fuckin' nut.
You know that, Mike.
You're a maniac, control freak.
I just don't like no surprises.
- Damn thing won't open.
- Well, give it a kick.
Hey, man, hey, hey, not like that. Not--
Here, here, here.
- See that ?
- Fuckin' A.
Unreal.
[ John ]
Axel, now I know why you're not still kicking for the Steelers.
You know, I love Mike's car.
Yeah, some cars, they just sit.
You never know with a car like this where the hell it's gonna take you.
Yeah.
It makes me feel safe.
Oh, what is he doing ?
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.
- Axel, get out of there.
- Let's get the carnations.
Get up. Get up.
What are you doing ?
Come on. Sit up.
Oh, God, you're impossible.
- Here, put this on.
You have to have that on.
- Crummy tuxedo.
- Tuxedo's been stuck a million times.
- Where'd you get this thing ?
It's not funny.
- Fuckin' A.
- I'm beautiful, right ? I'm beautiful.
- No, you're not.
- All set.
- Thanks, Amy.
You can't even sit up, Axel. Oh !
- Axel, come on. Sit up.
You can't even sit up.
- Beautiful.
Linda, what's the matter ?
I was gonna pick you up.
Hi.
- What's the matter ?
- He hit me.
Hey, come here, come here.
I wanna ask you something.
Hey, wait a minute, goddamn it.
- Nick ?
- You don't walk away from me.
What is that on your face ?
Nicky, you and Michael, you're goin' away in a couple of days.
I was just wonderin' if I could use this place to stay.
- Oh, sure.
- I'd wanna pay you both.
- And I was thinking--
- What are you talkin' about ?
I would wanna pay you, Nick.
- Hey, Kochatka, it's me you're talking to.
- You know, how long have you known me for ?
- [ Giggling, Sobbing ]
What ?
I don't know.
Have you, Steven, a free will and a firm intention... to take unto yourself as wife this woman, Angela, whom you see before you ?
I do.
- You have not promised yourself to any other bride ?
- I have not.
Have you, Angela, a free will and a firm intention... to take unto yourself as husband this man, Steven, whom you see before you ?
I have.
- You have not promised yourself to any other man ?
- I have not.
[ Priest Chanting ]
Blessed is the kingdom of the Father and of the Son... and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages.
* Amen *
* Entreat, entreat the Lord *
* Entreat, entreat the Lord *
* And He will have mercy *
* On our souls *
Hey, hey, hey !
Oh, hey, what's going on ?
For a buck, you get a shooter, a cigar... and a dance with the beautiful bride.
[ Axel ]
Fuckin' A.
And you're on your way.
- Do it. Come on. Do it.
May I have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen ?
- Quiet, please, please.
That's really wonderful. Thank you.
May I have your attention, please ?
I have a very, very important announcement.
Whoever owns--
Whoever owns a white Chevy lmpala, would you please move it ?
- It's blocking the driveway.
Whoever owns a white Chevy lmpala, it's blocking the driveway.
A white Chevy lmpala.
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
Angela and Steven would like to welcome you... and to introduce you to their bridal party, and especially to Michael and Nick, who are also going to Vietnam with Steven...
- to proudly serve their country.
- * You're just too good to be true *
* Can't take my eyes off of you *
Will you dance with me ?
Monday, Monday's the day.
Yeah, Monday, Monday.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for being my maid of honor.
Dance, dance.
You want me to--
You nut, you want me to dance ?
You want me to dance ? Hey, Nicky !
Michael, Michael !
Michael, Michael !
Oh, my God.
- Hey, how ya been ?
- Excuse me.
Hey, Nick, Nick, you know, you know, you know that I'd be going with you guys... if, if, if it wasn't for my knees.
You know that ?
Wait.
* I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right *
* I need you, baby to warm the lonely nights *
* Oh, I love you, baby *
* Trust in me when I say *

- You're okay.
- I am not.
- No, you're very fancy.
You want a beer or something like that ?
- You want a beer or something ?
- Okay. Sure.
- What kind of beer would you like ?
- What ? I don't know.
- What kind of beer would you like ?
- I don't care. Any kind.
- I'll get you a Rolling Rock.
- Okay.
- That's a good beer.
It's the best around.
- Huh ? Yeah, okay.
- Rolling Rock ?

Be right back.

* Let me love you **
- Hey, Jerry.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
Jerry, give us two
Rolling Rocks... and give me a Kessler on the side.
It's okay.
It's a wedding, you know.
You're supposed to let go and have fun and all that.
You really like Nick a lot, huh ?
[ Bartender ]
Anybody else for a shooter ?
Yeah.
Axel !
Put me down !
What are you doing ?
Axel ! Help !
Axel, no !
Axel, put me down !
- What are you doing ? Oh, Axel.
- I'm gonna kiss you.
Stop ! Stop !
I'm gonna stab you.
- You wanna fuck or fight ?
- Axel !
** [ Whistling ]
I think I might like to dance with the lady, if you don't mind.
- Have you known him long ?
This is the most fun
I've had in months.
Do you know what that son of a bitch is doing ?
He's got his hand on her ass !
It's only--
It's only--
- It's only a wedding.
- What do you mean,
"It's only a wedding" ?
The guy-- Look, he did it again !
He just did it !
- Come on. I gotta go get my gun out of my coat.
- Go get your gun. Go get it.
[ John ]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[ John ]
Time out. Time out !
You hurt me, you--
You punched me right there.
It hurts.
Is that better ?
I'm gonna kick on his fuckin' ass.
- Hey, Stan is crazy.
- Why ? What happened ?
- That Stan is crazy.
- What happened ?
It's a Green Beret !
- [ Steven ] Hey ! Whoo !
- [ Mike ] No kidding.
Jerry !
Jerry, give the man a drink.
- Hey !
- Give him a drink !
- Sir ! Sir !
- Sir !
Na zdorovije.
- Na zdorovije.
- Na zdorovije.
Don't cause any kind of problem, huh ?
Nah, I wanna talk to the man.
I wanna talk to the man.
We're goin' over there.
Sir, Mike Vronsky.
- Nick. This is the groom, Steve.
- I'm the best man.
We're goin' airborne, sir.
What's it like ?
- I hope they send us where the bullets are flyin'.
- That's right.
- Fighting's the worst, huh ?
- [ Both ] That's right.
Fuck it.
- Fuck it ? What did he say ?
- Fuck it.
Fuck it.
That's what I thought.
W-- Well, what's it like over there ?
[ Mike ]
Can you tell us anything ?
Fuck it.
[ Mike ]
Okay, fuck it.
Fuck him.
Fuck it. Hey !
[ Steven ]
Michael, hey.
- Hey.
- Fuck who ?
Fuck who ?
- [ Axel ] Who the hell is he ?
- [ Mike ] Who the fuck knows ?
[ Axel ]
He looks like a fuckin' hillbilly.
[ Mike ]
Give him another drink, Jerry.
Just the same.
- Hey ! Fuck it !
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Laughter Continues ]
- [ Steven ] Fuck you.
Hey ! Hey !
Hey ! Hey !
Steven.
Hey ! Hey !
Hey ! Hey !
Oh !
Hey ! Hey !
Hey ! Hey !
I got it !
Will you marry me ?
Yeah.
You would ?
Mm-hmm.
What I mean is if we get back from--
I mean, when we get back.
I don't know what the hell I mean.
I think what goes through your mind comes out your mouth.
Angela and Steven, if you don't spill a drop, it's good luck for the rest of your life.
- Hey !
- Hey, hey !
- Whoo !
Don't worry what Stan says.
Just forget that.
- He's got a big fucking mouth.
- Right.
- Huh ?
- [ Axel ] That's enough.
- Hey !
- [ Mike ] Come here.
I never really did it with Angela, Nicky.
Great. That's great.
That's my last one true secret.
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Just forget about it.
- Angela, Angela !
Oh, Angela.
What am I gonna do when she has the baby ?
- That's Angela's part, right ?
- That's right.
- Just hang loose.
- Hang loose ?
Be happy.
Go on. Get out of here.
We don't wanna see you anymore.
[ Axel ]
Look at this maniac.
I'll see you Monday on the train.
- Hey.
- Drive carefully.
- You didn't know that about Angela, huh ? Right ?
- Oh, that's bullshit.
- Oh, it's bullshit, right ? Yeah ?
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.
- I happen to know it's true.
- That's bullshit.

MAN: Ten-hut!
Be seated.
Now, I want you to remember...
...that no bastard ever won a war...
...by dying for his country.
He won it...
...by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.
Men...
...all this stuff you've heard about America not wanting to fight...
...wanting to stay out of the war...
...is a lot of horse dung.
Americans...
...traditionally love to fight.
All real Americans love the sting of battle.
When you were kids...
...you all admired the champion marble shooter...
...the fastest runner, big-league ball players, the toughest boxers.
Americans love a winner...
...and will not tolerate a loser.
Americans play to win all the time.
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed.
Thaùs why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war...
...because the very thought of losing...
...is hateful to Americans.
Now...
...an army is a team.
It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team.
This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap.
The bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality...
...for the Saturday Evening Post...
...don't know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating.
Now we have the finest food and equipment...
...the best spirit...
...and the best men in the world.
You know...
...by God, I actually pity those poor bastards we're going up against.
By God, I do.
We're not just going to shoot the bastards...
...we're going to cut out their living guts...
...and use them to grease the treads of our tanks.
We're going to murder those lousy
Hun bastards by the bushel.
Now...
...some of you boys...
...I know are wondering...
...whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it.
I can assure you...
...that you will all do your duty.
The Nazis...
...are the enemy.
Wade into them!
Spill their blood!
Shoot them in the belly!
When you put your hand...
...into a bunch of goo...
...that a moment before was your best frienÔs face...
...you'll know what to do.
There's another thing
I want you to remember.
I don't want to get any messages saying we are "holding our position."
We're not "holding" anything.
Let the Hun do that.
We're advancing constantly. We're not interested in holding on to anything...
...except the enemy.
We're going to hold on to him by the nose and kick him in the ass.
We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time...
...and we're going to go through him like crap through a goose!
Now...
...there's one thing...
...that you men will be able to say when you get back home.
And you may thank God for it.
Thirty years from now when you're sitting around your fireside...
...with your grandson on your knee...
...and he asks you:
"What did you do in the great
World War II?"
You won't have to say:
"Well...
...I shovelled shit in Louisiana."
All right, now, you sons of bitches...
...you know how I feel.
I will be proud...
...to lead you wonderful guys into battle anytime...
...anywhere.
Thaùs all.
The Arabs need food and clothing.
They strip our dead before we can even bury them.
Looks like the reports were pretty accurate.
Sixty-one armored vehicles,
45 tons of ammunition...
...twenty-five 40mm guns, three self-propelled 105s.
Not counting mortars, machine guns, rifles...
...pistols, telescopes, belt buckles,
GI socks.
One thousand, eight hundred men.
Our people salute you, general...
...for your brilliant amphibious landing on the continent of Africa...
...and for your enlightened administration of our country.
I've enjoyed being here, Excellency.
Naturally, I'd prefer to be in Tunisia fighting the Germans.
"The lions in their dens tremble at his approach."
I appreciate that, Excellency.
Magnificent!
I wish our troops looked that good.
Tell me, general, what do you think of Morocco?
I love it, Excellency.
Iùs a combination of the Bible and Hollywood.
BRADLEY: These men fight at Kasserine?
CARVER: Yes, sir.
For the American Army to take a licking like that...
...the first time at bat against the Germans...
Up against Rommel, what we need is the best tank man we've got.
Somebody tough enough to pull this outfit together.
- Patton?
- Possibly.
God help us.
Lieutenant...
...where is the duty officer?
Sir...
- He said he's caught at shaving.
- Why isn't he here on duty?
Guess he needed a shave.
We got a new commanding general due today.
MAN: Who the hell is kicking me in the butt?
Oh, sorry, sir.
- What were you doing down there?
- Trying to get some sleep, sir.
Well...
Get back down there, son.
You're the only son of a bitch here who knows what he's trying to do.
Yes, sir.
PATTON: Brad, how the hell are you?
- Fine, George. Good to see you.
We were all under the impression you wouldn't be here until 0900.
Yes, I gathered that.
- You know my boy, Dick Jenson.
- Yes.
Brad, tell me.
- What are you doing here?
- Ike wanted a report on Kasserine.
Meanwhile, I have to stay here as an observer...
...but I report directly to Ike.
You're spying.
Get me General Eisenhower's headquarters.
Tell me, Brad...
...what happened at Kasserine?
I heard it was a shambles.
Apparently, everything went wrong.
We'd send over a 75mm shell, the krauts would return an 88.
Their tanks are diesels.
Even when we managed to hit one they kept on running. Our tanks...
The men call them
"Purple Heart boxes."
One hot piece of shrapnel and the gasoline explodes.
I warned them about the tank.
I talked to one of the soldiers about the half-tracks.
I asked them if the machine-gun bullets pierced the armor.
And he said, "No, sir.
They just come through one side and rattle around a bit."
I understand they had a little trouble coordinating the air cover.
The trouble was no air cover.
- General Smith on the line, sir.
- Excuse me, Brad.
Bedell?
Listen, I'm calling about Bradley and his job here.
I need a good number-two man, I want to make Brad my deputy commander.
You clear it with Ike?
All right, thanks, Bedell.
Now you're not spying for Eisenhower anymore, you're working for me.
- Okay?
- Fine, okay.
Dick. You got those stars?
- Yes, sir.
- Leùs get them on.
Whaùs the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated by the president.
I know, but it doesn't become official until iùs approved by the Senate.
Well...
...they have their schedule and I have mine.
George...
...if you were named admiral of the Turkish Navy...
...I believe your aides could dip into their haversacks...
...and come up with the appropriate badge of rank.
Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.
You know...
I think those stars look better on a green shirt.
Did I ever tell you about the time I designed a uniform for tank crewmen?
It was green leather, it had red stripes...
...and sort of a row of brass buttons down across here.
And topped off by a gold football helmet.
The Army rejected it, of course.
Goddamn, it was beautiful.
Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.
George, there's one other thing I put in my Kasserine report.
Some of our boys were just plain scared.
Thaùs understandable.
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy the first time out.
I can remember...
...when nothing frightened me as much as the idea of...
...a bullet coming straight for my nose.
I don't know why, but the image of a bullet coming right for my nose...
...was more horrible than any other possibility.
Well, I can understand that, with such a handsome nose.
You want to know why this outfit got the hell kicked out of it?
Blind man could see it in a minute.
They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.
Why should they fight like soldiers?
You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.
In about 15 minutes we're going to start turning these boys...
...into fanatics, razors.
They'll lose their fear of the Germans.
I hope to God they never lose their fear of me.
Up bright and early, general?
Breakfast?
Have all my officers finished breakfast?
We're open from 6 till 8.
Most of the officers are just coming in, sir.
Please inform these officers the mess hall is closed.
But, sir! Iùs only a quarter to 8.
From now on, you will open at 6 and no one will be admitted after 6: 15.
Where are your leggings?
Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir,
I'm a cook.
You're a soldier.
$20 fine.
Gentlemen...
...from this moment any man...
...without leggings, without a helmet, without a tie...
Any man with unshined shoes or soiled uniform...
...is going to be skinned.
This is a barracks.
Iùs not a bordello.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
Doctor.
Sir.
I understand you have two cases of self-inflicted wounds.
Yes, sir, we do.
Get them out of here.
One has developed a serious infection.
I don't care if he dies, just get him out of here.
Doesn't belong in the same room with men wounded in battle.
- I'll see that they're moved.
- One more thing.
There'll be no "battle fatigue."
Thaùs an order.
Battle fatigue is a free ride to the hospital.
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.
Yes, sir.
Doctor...
Where's your helmet?
I don't wear a helmet in the hospital.
Start.
I can't use my stethoscope when I'm wearing my helmet.
Well...
...then cut two holes in your helmet so that you can.
And get those yellow-bellies out of here, today.
Hold it.
Turn right, here.
The battlefield is ahead.
Don't argue.
I can smell a battlefield.
He was out here yesterday.
Iùs over there. Turn right, damn it.
It was here.
The battlefield was here.
The Carthaginians defending the city...
...were attacked by three
Roman legions.
They were brave, but they couldn't hold. They were massacred.
Arab women...
...stripped them of their tunics and their swords and lances.
The soldiers lay naked in the sun...
...2000 years ago.
I was here.
You don't believe me.
You know what the poet said:
"Through the travail of ages
Iùs the pomp and toils of war
Have I fought and strove and perished
Countless times upon the star
As if through a glass and darkly
The age-old strife I see
Where I fought in many guises
Many names
But always me."
You know who the poet was?
Me.
There's an opportunity for us to mount an offensive.
We've concentrated on the flank...
...draw strength from the British.
It appears now that we could...
...split the African corridor.
Drive through Rommel to the sea.
I'm sorry, but that territory has been reserved...
...for General Bernard Law Montgomery.
We're supposed to let him win this one no matter what.
They're entitled to have their hero.
Montgomery did push Rommel clear across North Africa.
What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?
You have anybody in mind?
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham is here with General Buford.
Excuse me, gentlemen...
...while I ask our British friends whaùs happened to our air cover.
BRADLEY:
Harry.
How are you?
George. Good to see you.
- You know Arthur Coningham.
- Sir Arthur.
Delighted to see you.
I've heard so much about you.
Gentlemen, it appears there's been a slight misunderstanding here...
...and Ike thought we should fix it.
No, no. No misunderstanding.
We're supposed to have Allied air cover and we don't.
German planes are strafing my troops.
If I may say so, general, I'm afraid your operation reports are inaccurate.
Report? Three days ago, the crowds took off after my command car...
...ran my ass into a ditch.
My staff has assured me, we have complete air supremacy...
...everywhere in the Mediterranean.
PATTON:
When I complained about air cover...
...you said our troops were not battleworthy.
You spoke of the discredited practice of using air force as an alibi...
...for lack of success on the ground.
I have to wet-nurse Montgomery,
I don't have to stand for that.
I sincerely apologize for that remark, whoever made it.
And I promise you one thing, general:
You will see no more German planes.
We were discussing air supremacy,
Sir Arthur.
Damn door won't open!
By God, thaùs enough!
Get that thing out of here!
Come on, you bastards, take a shot at me on the nose!
Get back in here, George! We need a corps commander, not a casualty.
CONINGHAM:
How'd you manage to stage that?
I don't know...
...but if I could find the Nazis flying those things...
...I'd give them each a medal.
PATTON: Can't get over how cold it gets in the desert.
Awfully cold, sir.
PATTON: Rommel's out there somewhere, waiting for me.
JENSON:
Yes, sir.
PATTON:
You know...
...if I had my way, I'd send that genius son of a bitch...
...an engraved invitation in iambic pentameter:
A challenge in two stanzas to meet me alone in the desert.
I'll deliver it.
Rommel in his tank and me in mine.
We'd stop about 20 paces.
We'd get out, we'd shake hands...
...then we'd button up and do battle, just the two of us.
That battle would decide the outcome of the war.
Iùs too bad jousting's gone out of style.
Iùs like your poetry, general.
It isn't part of the 20th century.
You're right, Dick.
The world grew up.
Hell of a shame.
Dick, I want a 24-hour guard put around this area.
If we don't, the Arabs will dig them up for their clothes.
Yes, sir.
Our graves aren't gonna disappear like everybody else's who fought here.
The Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians.
God, how I hate the 20th century.
General.
General?
We intercepted a German radio message.
Rommel's 10th Panzer is going to hit us near El Guettar.
Rommel, huh?
All my life...
...I've wanted to lead a lot of men in a desperate battle.
Now I'm going to do it.
Look.
Battalion strength at least.
They haven't spotted our positions yet.
They'll get an education in about 10 seconds.
Wait till they get a dose of that artillery fire.
Commence firing.
Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.
What a hell of a waste of fine infantry.
- Get General Bradley on the radio.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, I can't raise him.
Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's where we hold them by the nose...
...and kick them in the ass.
Go on.
Put him in my car.
Rommel...
...you magnificent bastard.
I read your book!
PATTON: Captain Richard N. Jenson was a fine boy.
Loyal, unselfish and efficient.
I am terribly sorry.
There are no coffins here since there is no wood.
We will have a trumpeter and an honor guard...
...but we will not fire the volleys as people would think an air raid was on.
I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair in a letter to his mother.
He was a fine man...
...and a fine officer.
And he had no vices.
I shall miss him a lot.
I can 't see the reason such fine young men get killed.
There are so many battles yet to fight.
NARRATOR: Battle-weary, but victorious, American Gls and Tommies...
...of the British 8th Army meet in an Allied victory celebration...
...at Wadi Akarit in North Africa.
For the first time in this war,
Broadway and Piccadillyjoin hands.
Meanwhile, General Montgomery, hero of El Alamein...
...continues to lead his victorious British 8th Army...
...in a relentless drive against
Rommel's vaunted Africa corps.
General Bradley's done a tremendous job with 2nd Corps.
He's moved into Bizerte and taken over 41,000 prisoners.
Good. Very good.
You're not surprised, are you?
After all, you trained that outfit.
- Excuse me, general.
- Hm?
This is interesting. We've discovered
Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.
- Who says so?
- G2, sir.
When we took 10th Panzer,
Rommel was in Berlin with an earache?
Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.
Also, Hitler probably retained Rommel in Berlin...
...because things were going badly for the Africa Corps.
He didn't want his favorite general to lose face.
I'm my favorite general, and I don't like to be told...
...that some second-stringer is up against me. Then I lose face.
Who the hell are you, anyway?
CARVER: General, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman. Your new aide.
Codman. I pulled your name off the list because I know your family.
I'm glad you did, sir.
Rommel is the best the krauts have, and I kicked the hell out of him.
Now my own G2 section is telling me he wasn't even there.
But, general, he undoubtedly planned the German battle.
If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel. Isn't that true?
Codman...
- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.
I have a plan for the invasion of Sicily.
I want to make sure I get it approved.
You can help me.
I want to give a dinner for General Alexander.
Get to him before Montgomery does.
This will be strictly a formal affair,
Codman, but purely social.
By that I mean...
...purely political.
- Yes, sir.
I want the finest food, the best wine available. Everything, comme il faut.
Thank you.
George, this is really splendid wine.
Thank you, Arthur.
Thank you.
Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades in the Peloponnesian War...
...415 B.C.
He said, "If Syracuse falls, all
Sicily falls, and then Italy."
He knew that Syracuse was the jugular of the island.
Old Alcibiades always went for the throat.
I propose to take Sicily in the same way.
- How's it going?
- The old man has them in his pocket.
PATTON:
Now, according to my plan...
...General Montgomery will land here.
I'll hit the beaches here, take Palermo.
Monty will drive north on the coast,
I'll come due east...
...take Messina and cut off the German escape route.
Yes...
It looks like an interesting plan.
Well, gentlemen, to the conquest of Sicily.
ALEXANDER:
To the conquest of Sicily.
OFFICERS:
To Sicily!
George, you'd have made a great marshal for Napoleon...
...if you'd lived in the 18th century.
But I did, sir. I did.
Morning. Is General Smith in?
MAN: I believe he's in the lavatory.
- Thank you.
- Ah, there you are, Bedell.
- Monty.
Bedell, I've been giving a good bit of thought to the Sicily operation.
Yes?
I assume we're alone.
Georgie Patton has already discussed his plan with Alexander.
I realize that...
...but I have an idea that his plan may lead to an absolute disaster.
Oh?
Bedell, look.
This is Sicily.
Now then, according to Patton's plan...
...I will attack Syracuse here.
And he would attack Palermo up here.
Now, obviously our forces would be divided.
And obviously, they could be chopped up piecemeal.
Now then, what I propose, and what
I shall insist on, by the way...
...is this.
I will land at Syracuse as planned.
But the Americans-
The Americans will land here, at Gela.
I will advance north to Messina, the Americans protecting my flank.
After all, Messina is the key.
Iùs the reason for invading Sicily.
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.
I'm sure he'll give it serious consideration.
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?
That the plans for the invasion of Sicily...
...should have been put forward in an Algerian lavatory.
George, I have bad news for you about your Sicily plan.
Ike has turned it down.
Since the Italians will be defending their native soil for the first time...
...and the German resistance is stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.
- Well, where do my people land then?
- In the Gulf of Gela.
There's nothing there but a beach.
Yes, but it puts you in a good position to support Montgomery.
Where does Montgomery land?
He'll land in Syracuse and drive north to Catania. Possibly even Messina.
And you'll be alongside, protecting his left.
I see.
In other words, we get the burden again while good old Monty gets the glory.
Ike had to consider all points of view.
He made his decision not as an
American, but as an Ally.
Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.
No...
...I've been in the Army 30 years.
When I get an order, I say, "Yes, sir."
And I do my best to carry it out.
This is what happens when your commander stops being an American...
...and starts being an Ally.
I don't think I've made myself clear, sir.
Iùs true, Montgomery met the toughest resistance there at Catania.
However, if we're-
Perfectly clear.
Old Monty is as stuck as a bug on flypaper.
But this order from
General Alexander...
...directing you to turn over the
Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.
Well, then, old Bradley will have to slug- slug, mind you...
...his way up center of the island over those tough mountain roads, won't he?
Yes, sir.
Messina, Bell.
Messina...
...is the heart of it. If they'd followed my plan, I'd be there by now.
I'd cut off the retreat of every
German on this island!
Now, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go to Palermo.
I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina if iùs the last thing I ever do!
Hey, whaùs all this talk about taking the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?
General Alexander's orders.
Road goes to Montgomery.
Now, that road was assigned to me.
How can I get north without it?
You know the terrain there.
I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run into tough opposition. Very tough.
You wouldn't be taking advantage of this situation, would you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Without that road, your army, except for my 2nd Corps...
...would be out of a job.
Free for you to go into Palermo.
Who said anything about Palermo?
I can read a map.
Does Alexander know you've pushed out this far?
Thaùs a reconnaissance in force.
George...
...are you saying I've got to slug it out in those mountains...
...with heavy resistance?
Just so you can make a bigger splash than Monty?
General...
...I just follow my orders.
Like the simple old soldier I am.
General Bradley.
Sir, General Alexander has heard we're moving west.
He says here, "Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.
Repeat. Stop, immediately."
Thaùs what you think it says.
I think it was garbled in transmission.
Ask them to re-transmit the message.
Thaùll take half a day at least.
Yes, sir.
Now, Brad.
Where were we?
We were talking about a simple...
...old soldier.
Look at that, gentlemen.
Compared to war...
...all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance.
Leùs go, sergeant.
Move out!
Give me that helmet.
Come on, leùs get out of here!
What silly son of a bitch is in charge of this operation?
I don't know, but they ought to hang him.
PATTON:
Afternoon, Padre.
PADRE: These men are here from the
States, looking over our program...
...for the spiritual welfare of the men.
We'll take you right into Palermo.
Col. David toured us around your quarters...
...and I saw a Bible by your bed.
Do you actually find time to read it?
I sure do.
Every goddamn day.
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!
Damn!
Palermo's the most conquered city in history.
First the Phoenicians...
...the Romans,
Carthaginians, Byzantines.
Then came the Arabs...
...Spaniards, Neapolitans.
Now comes...
...the American Army.
This is from General Alexander, sir...
...reminding you that you are not to take Palermo.
Send him a message, Cod.
Ask him if he wants me to give it back.
PATTON: Let me ask you a question for a change.
You've just come from Washington.
How do they feel about our boys taking Palermo?
The general impression is, your army barreled through token resistance...
...while Montgomery faced the brunt of the fighting.
Don't they know we took on the Hermann Gˆring division?
Toughest outfit in the German Army.
The people at home are interested in you.
They're curious about your pearl-handle revolvers.
They're ivory. Only a pimp from a New Orleans whorehouse...
...would carry a pearl handle.
What about your language?
When I want it to stick,
I give it to them loud and dirty.
What do your troops feel about that?
I don't want these men to love me.
I want them to fight for me.
Ernie Pyle says you have a secret weapon here: General Bradley.
Ernie calls him "The GI General."
Omar Bradley is no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.
MAN:
Whaùs your feeling about Montgomery?
PATTON:
He's the best general the English have.
He seems more concerned with not losing than he does about winning.
He's not aggressive enough, is that correct?
Look, I've been getting into a lot of trouble lately.
Yesterday, the office told me that my Italian prisoners...
...didn't have enough latrine.
They didn't know what a latrine was till I showed them.
If I've said anything too critical of my British colleague...
...leùs forget about it.
I will tell you one thing, though.
Off the record.
I'm gonna beat that...
...gentleman to Messina.
Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what this madman Patton is saying?
He's going to save our skins by taking Messina.
This report might interest you.
Here I am in these bloody marshes, fighting malaria and Germans...
...while he's taking Palermo and getting all the glory.
Well!
Now he's up against three good
German divisions and he's stuck.
He's not going to get Messina.
Thaùs reserved for the
British 8th Army and me.
Iùs time for a move, Lucian. Terry
Allen's 1 st Division is bogged down.
You're bogged down too.
What we need is another end run just to break things loose.
- Lucian. How's my fighter?
- Fine, George.
Come in, come in. We need another one of your amphibious specialties.
Lucian, I want you to send a reinforced battalion by sea...
...to make a landing up here at Brolo behind the kraut lines.
You want me to do a land-based attack.
Right. I want a coordinated attack the morning of the 11 th.
I don't think we can make it by the 11 th.
- Hell, iùs only 15, 20 miles.
- My boys have been dying for yards.
Hm.
Maybe you better kick a few butts if you have to.
I recommended you for your DSM in your last promotion.
I know what you can do when you put your mind to it.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry, but I can't do the impossible.
You're too old an athlete to think you can postpone a scheduled match.
You're an old athlete yourself.
You know matches are postponed.
If we can't back Lucian up by land, our end run could be a disaster.
Those men might get caught on the beach and cut to pieces.
- Whaùs the matter?
BRADLEY: All we're saying is...
...not to rush in until we're ready.
Give him an extra day.
Just one more day.
The landing is on.
We're going to Messina.
We're going to get there before
Montgomery does.
- Whaùs so important about that?
- General Truscott...
...if your conscience won't permit you to conduct this operation...
...I'll find somebody who can.
General, iùs your privilege to relieve me anytime you want to.
This match will not be postponed.
Any questions?
No, sir.
You're a very good man, Lucian.
You want to guard against being too conservative.
Remember what
Frederick the Great said:
"L 'audace, I'audace!
Toujours I'audace!"
Go on, have a drink.
Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking for the next couple of days.
If anything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.
You're not going, so forget about it.
You believe Truscoùs right?
No.
But you're gambling with those boys' lives...
...just to beat Montgomery into Messina.
If you pull it off, you're a hero, but if you don't...
What happens to them?
The ordinary combat soldier.
He doesn't share in your dreams of glory, he's stuck here.
He's living out every day, day-to-day, with death tugging at his elbow.
There's one big difference between you and me, George.
I do this job because I've been trained to do it.
You do it because...
...you love it.
The men on the beach are catching hell, general.
The men are doing their best.
We have no replacements.
I can't break through to the coast.
I'm going down there myself.
PATTON:
Colonel!
How did he get over there?
PATTON:
What the hell are you waiting for?
Looking for a place to ford, general.
I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.
PATTON: I've done that. Down there this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.
Get that outfit cranked up or you'll be out of a job!
- And put that helmet on.
- Yes, sir.
Move it! Leùs go!
- Whaùs holding up this column?
- I don't know, sir.
Planes!
Come on, move it!
Pull up over there.
- Come on.
- Whaùs going on here?
Sir, these mules-
Jackasses!
You let a column get stalled and strafed on account of two jackasses?!
No. No.
Now, dump them over the side and clear this bridge!
We're pinned down because we can't get air support!
Nobody's getting any air support!
Put fire into this battalion, or I'll get somebody who can.
Major!
- You the executive officer here?
- Yes, sir.
- Your name?
- Walker.
You're now commanding officer.
You've got 4 hours to break through that beachhead.
If you don't make it, I'll fire you.
50,000 men on this island would like to shoot that son of a bitch.
Please take me home.
Take me home.
Please take me home.
Take me home.
- There he goes, "Old Blood and Guts."
- Yeah, our blood. His guts.
Hi, how are you, son?
Where are you from, Gomez?
California, sir.
Me too.
- Where were you hit?
- In the chest, sir.
Well...
...this might be interesting to you.
The last German I saw had no chest.
Didn't have any head either.
You get well quickly, son.
Whaùs the matter with you?
I guess I just can't take it, sir.
What did you say?
Iùs my nerves, sir.
I just can't stand the shelling anymore.
Your nerves?
Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.
Shut up!
I won't have a yellow bastard crying...
...in front of these brave, wounded men.
Shut up!
Don't admit this yellow bastard.
Nothing wrong with him.
I won't have sons of bitches afraid to fight stink up this place of honor.
You're going back to the front, my friend.
You may get shot, you may get killed, but you're going up to the fighting.
Either that or I'll stand you up in front of a firing squad.
I should shoot you myself, you bastard! Get him out of here!
Send him up to the front!
You hear me? You goddamn coward!
I won't have cowards in my army.
I had to kick a few butts...
...but Truscott finally broke through to those people on the beach.
Have you seen the casualty lists?
Yes, I've seen them.
Whaùs the word from the coast road?
The 3rd Division's east of Brolo, heading toward Messina.
Leùs get over there.
I want to go in with the troops.
You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.
General Bradley...
...iùs time to consider how many casualties we'd have...
...if we were still crawling on that goddamn road.
Forward, march!
Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.
Pity. I shaved close this morning to prepare for getting smacked by you.
Forward, march!
You wanted to see me, George?
Got a letter here from Ike.
I was rereading Caesar's
Commentaries last night.
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to distinguish him from his men.
I was struck by that fact because-
"Despicable." First time anybody's ever applied that word to me.
Well, at least iùs a personal reprimand, iùs not official.
The man was yellow. He shoulÔve been tried for cowardice and shot.
People have taken a lot worse than a little kick in the pants.
I ruffled his pride a bit.
Whaùs that compared to war?
Two weeks ago at Palermo they said
I was the greatest general...
...since Stonewall Jackson.
- Now they draw cartoons about you.
Dirty bastard!
They got me holding a little GI and kicking him with an iron boot.
You see that, whaùs on my boot?
A swastika.
On my boot.
An iron boot with a swastika!
"You will apologize to the soldier you slapped...
...to all doctors and nurses present in the tent at the time...
...to every patient in the tent who can be reached...
...and last but not least to the 7th Army as a whole...
...through individual units, one at a time."
God, I...
...feel low.
PATTON:
Oh, God...
...Thou art my God.
Early will I seek Thee.
My soul thirsteth for Thee.
My flesh longeth for Thee in a dry and thirsty land.
So as I have seen Thee in the sanctuary.
My soul followeth hard after Thee.
But those that seek my soul to destroy it...
...shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
They shall fall by the sword.
They shall be apportioned for foxes.
But the king shall rejoice in God.
Everyone that sweareth by him shall glory.
But the mouth of them that speak lies...
...shall be stopped.
Ten-hut!
PATTON:
At ease.
I thought I'd stand up here and let you people see...
...if I am as big a son of a bitch as some of you think I am.
I assure you I had no intention...
...of being either harsh or cruel in my treatment of the...
...soldier in question.
My sole purpose was to try to restore in him...
...some appreciation of his obligations as a man...
...and as a soldier.
If one can shame a coward...
...I felt one might help him to regain his self-respect.
This was on my mind.
Now, I freely admit...
...that my method was wrong...
...but I hope you understand my motive...
...and will accept this...
...explanation...
...and this...
...apology.
- Dismissed.
- Ten-hut!
Good evening, general. I want to report on a private poll I'm taking.
What poll?
The fan mail.
Eleven percent con,
89 percent pro.
And that 11% of protest, in most cases, is both obscene and anonymous.
But the pro letters are mostly from relatives and servicemen.
"I want you to know we're proud our son is serving in your army.
From the newspaper, we're not clear exactly what you did and why...
...but we want you to know we're for you.
Keep going, and God bless you."
Keep going, huh?
Where?
I thought you might like a sip of wine, general. Iùs New Year's.
You didn't celebrate at all last night.
I'm sick of sitting around this...
...royal doghouse.
We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.
Maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio message, just came in.
Cod.
I've been relieved.
They've relieved me from command of the 7th Army.
I don't believe it.
Happy New Year.
Just a minute, sir.
Since they're sure to give you another command...
...isn't it logical they'd relieve you here first?
You mean command of all American troops going into Europe?
Iùs possible. I know iùs been discussed from time to time.
The logic of it is so obvious, it couldn't mean anything else.
Sir, I'm going to open this bottle of wine.
No, Sir Cod...
...but if you find a bottle of cognac,
I'll help you drink it.
- How you feeling tonight, general?
- Not bad, not bad at all.
- Get me some writing paper, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Your wife ever give you the devil for not writing?
All the time, sir.
Only I don't write as often as you do. Don't seem to get around to it.
Lucky for us we got them.
Who wants to marry a couple of broken-down old horse captains?
Thaùs what my wife says to me every time I come home, sir.
Why are you up so late, George?
Thought you'd like a nice hot bath or something.
I got this sleeping pill from the doc, just in case you need it.
Sleeping pill!
- Whaùs going on here?
- I heard the news, sir.
- They announced it on the radio.
- What news?
About General Bradley, sir. How they gave him the top American command.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
I just thought you might be feeling kind of low, sir.
Your writing things, sir.
Here on the desk, sir.
Yeah. Thank you, George.
One little dog face.
One measly little slap.
Thaùs what done it.
Ah, George.
I wish I'd kissed the son of a bitch.
He's paying tribute to the Free French
Forces under DeGaulle and Leclerc.
And to the people of the Resistance...
...who risk their lives to help destroy the Germans.
"France will be free again.
I give you my word."
"Just as Free French troops liberated
Corsica, Napoleon's place of birth...
...I will someday land in France to liberate the birthplace of Lafayette."
General, the reporters would like a word with you.
- Good afternoon.
- General.
Can you tell us the purpose of this visit to Corsica?
General Eisenhower ordered me here.
You wrote the mother of the boy you slapped, "The rat shoulÔve been shot."
- Is that true, general?
- No comment.
Sir, I understand
Gen. Alexander suggested...
...you take over Gen. Clark's
Italian campaign...
...but it was killed due to the incident.
- No comment.
- Can you say where you're going, sir?
Off the record,
Eisenhower's ordered me to Malta.
Interview concluded.
You plan on slapping any soldiers there, general?
PATTON: In 1528, these forts were defended by...
...400 Knights of Malta and 800 mercenaries...
...against a force of 40,000 Turks.
Codman.
- Still no word from Gen. Eisenhower?
- No, sir.
Not even a response about the two turkeys I sent for Christmas?
No, sir.
Go ahead, gentlemen.
Take a closer look for yourselves.
Looks like you boys have hitched your wagon to a falling star.
Pass the word.
If anyone wants out, I'll understand.
Sir, I can speak for the entire staff.
We want to stay with you, no matter what duty you're assigned to.
Up in London, they're planning the invasion of Europe.
I've trained my mind, body and spirit for that.
What, in GoÔs name, am I doing here?
All right.
Leùs get on to Cairo.
See if the pyramids are still standing.
- This place is for me?
- Yes, sir. This way, sir.
Whoever found it has a genius for cloak and dagger.
Who picked this cathouse?
I think it was Gen. Smith, sir.
To spite me, that son of a bitch.
- Welcome to London, Georgie.
- Bedell. How are you?
- Is Ike here?
- He asked me to brief you.
Would you excuse us, please?
Let me put you straight about Ike.
We hear a lot about you criticizing his decisions.
Not really. You know me.
I'm just an old fool.
At times, I do wonder whether he isn't a limey at heart.
George, this is the toughest coalition ever attempted in history.
Ike's trying to hold it together and lick the Germans at the same time.
- Iùs a hell of a job.
- I understand.
You have an important assignment connected to the Normandy invasion.
Good. I've studied the Overlord Plan and there's a number of flaws in it.
You can't depend on Monty taking
Cannes by D-day. He'll never make it.
I've drawn up an alternate plan to land at Calais...
...following an air bombardment-
- Will you just listen for a change?
Ike stood by you when everyone,
I mean everyone...
...wanted Patton with a rope around his neck.
We're gonna let it leak out that you are here undercover.
That you're preparing to invade at the Pas de Calais.
We hope to pin down the German 15th Army there...
...so that they can't be used against us at Normandy.
Is that all I'm good for?
We're going to build an army of 12 divisions around you.
All fictitious, of course.
Dummy troop concentrations, dummy landing craft...
...simulated radio traffic.
The Germans are convinced that you will lead the main invasion effort.
Their agents will spot you soon...
...then we can move you to Knutsford.
- What do I do there?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Frankly, George, you're on probation.
Take my advice and behave yourself.
Remember...
...your worst enemy is your own big mouth.
Look at this nasty-faced son of a bitch. Ready for combat.
I'll call him William as in "the Conqueror."
- Sir, should we leave him in the car?
- No. Good afternoon, ladies.
Good afternoon.
Watch this, Cod.
- Sir, he'll kill that dog.
- I'll hold him.
I'm terribly sorry, general.
Did Abigail frighten your dog?
Thaùs quite all right, madam.
This way, sir.
Your name isn't William.
Iùs Willie.
WOMAN:
My dear friends.
General George S. Patton, Jr., has accepted our invitation...
...to say a few words to you...
...on the occasion of this inaugural ceremony.
General Patton is not here in an official capacity...
...and I have assured him most earnestly...
...that nothing he says will be quoted.
May I present General Patton.
- Remember, sir, watch your language.
- Yeah.
My dear ladies.
Until today...
...my only experience at welcoming has been...
...to welcome Germans and Italians to the infernal region.
At this I have been quite successful...
...since the troops, which I have had the honor to command...
...have, to date, killed or captured...
...some 170,000 of our enemies.
I feel that such clubs as these are of very real value...
...because I believe with Mr. Bernard Shaw...
...that the British and the Americans are two peoples...
...separated by a common language.
Since it is the destiny of the British and Americans to rule the world...
...the better we know each other...
...the better we will do it.
The Russians, don't forget the Russians.
I think that a club like this...
...is an ideal place for promoting mutual understanding.
Because as soon as our soldiers meet and get to know the English ladies...
...and write home and tell our women just how lovely you truly are...
...then the sooner the American ladies will get jealous...
...and force this war to a quick termination.
And then I'll get the chance to go to the Pacific and kill Japanese.
NARRATOR:
All over the nation...
...mass meetings are held to protest
General Patton 's statement...
...that Britain and America will rule the post war world.
That Russia will have no say.
Congressional leaders like Senator
Clayburn Foss are quick to react.
This man has insulted our Russian allies...
...implying Anglo-American world rule.
In my opinion, he should be severely disciplined.
This time I didn't do a damn thing.
They promised there wouldn't be any reporters.
I made a few remarks off the record.
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.
You know how suspicious the Russians are of the British and us.
I was only trying to be polite to the old ladies.
If I'd seen the Russians there, I'd have mentioned the sons of bitches.
Bedell, I don't know anything about politics.
I have no political ambitions.
All I want to do is to command an army in combat.
Well, iùs out of our hands now.
Ike sent a message last night to the chief of staff.
Now iùs up to General Marshall whether you stay here as a decoy...
...or he sends you home.
He's a good man.
At least he's a fair man.
I'll let it sit with him.
PATTON:
George...
...our war is over.
Over, sir?
Iùs just a question of waiting for the orders now.
I feel I'm...
I'm destined to achieve some great thing. What, I don't know.
But this last incident is...
...so trivial in its nature and so terrible in its effect-
It can't be an accident.
It has to be the work of God.
Yes, sir.
The last great opportunity of a lifetime...
...an entire world at war and I'm left out of it?
No, sir.
God will not permit this to happen!
I am going to be allowed to fulfil my destiny!
His will be done.
NARRATOR: In the greatest amphibious operation ever attempted...
...a predawn naval bombardment prepares the way...
...for allied soldiers to assault the Normandy beaches...
...and claw out a desperate foothold on the continent of Europe.
I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so.
And here they are all hung up in the hedgerow country.
They should pivot the way von
Schlieffen planned it in World War I.
Then we might get a chance to do some real broken field running.
But they don't listen to me.
What a way to enter the continent of Europe.
Along with all the rest of the spare parts.
Sir, everything on this plane is high priority.
Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you unless he had something in mind.
I'll tell you, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.
If I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.
I'm gonna play the game.
If I forget, you remind me.
- I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs.
- Give me a swift kick in the ass.
Yes, sir.
Welcome to France, sir.
Hope the war's still on.
Where's the boss?
Right this way, sir.
Patton, haven't seen you since Messina.
How are you?
You're doing a splendid job decoying the Jerries.
You'll forgive me,
I'm off to the front.
Best of everything, old boy.
By the way...
...intelligence confirms that I'm against Rommel again.
Rommel.
Hi, how are you, George?
- Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
- Fine.
Well. My, my.
Isn't this plush?
Looks like you're bucking for archbishop.
Chet Hansen had this rig built for me.
George, sit down.
Ike wanted me to talk to you since we can level with each other.
Thaùs right.
We're making 3rd Army operational when I take over 12th Army group.
Do I get it?
I'll be honest with you.
I've had reservations.
You've been my senior ever since
I left the academy.
You were the boss in North Africa and Sicily and I just thought...
...well, it might be a problem for us.
It wouldn't bother me.
There's one other thing.
We're different kinds of people.
Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.
With your brains and my screwy ideas, we make a great team, like in Sicily.
Truthfully, if I had been your senior in Sicily, I would have relieved you.
Brad...
...I'm not crawling on my belly to get a command.
For GoÔs sake, get me in this fight.
The only way out of the doghouse is to do something great.
I gotta get back in the war!
Hitler's own people tried to kill him a few days ago.
First thing you know, iùll be over and...
I'll...
...keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.
I give you my word.
George...
...I've been working on a plan called Cobra.
I'd like your opinion.
We've been slugging through hedgerow country...
...half an acre a day and we've got to find a way out.
I want to use this road.
The Saint LÙ-Periers road.
Monty will pin down the enemy forces at Caen.
We'll pulverize an area
31/2 miles wide with bombing.
Then seven divisions will follow.
The 3rd Army will swing around here, a sweeping end run right across France.
What do you think?
I think you'll need a screwball old cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.
George...
...Ike came to that conclusion in London three months ago.
He what?
Why, that dirty-!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I promise to keep my mouth shut.
George could have the courtesy to tell us where he's going.
Good God, look at that.
Where you going, general?
Berlin.
I'm going to personally shoot that paper-hanging son of a bitch.
Hold it. Hold it!
This place isn't on the map.
You know why?
We've run clear off the map.
Give George a headline, and he's good for another 30 miles.
SOLDIER:
Atten-hut!
Hold it!
Pay attention. We're gonna clean this mess up right now.
Leùs move this vehicle out this way.
This one out this way.
Back that thing up there, and we'll take this one here.
All right, get up off your ass.
Leùs go now!
Thaùs it.
Thaùs the way to move.
Good boy. All right, come on.
Come on, now. Here we go. Come on.
Thaùs it!
Thaùs it! Gun it!
Gun that thing!
Okay, come on.
Watch it!
Go, go, go! Come on.
Hold it up.
Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
Thaùs it.
Come on, now.
- Chet.
- Yeah, will do.
Come on, keep coming. Keep coming.
Hold it up there.
Now come on! Hold it!
Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!
Thaùs it. Come on.
Good boy.
- Hold it up there.
- General!
General Bradley wants to have a word with you.
Okay. Come on!
Okay. Hold it up. Take over.
George, you'd make a good traffic cop.
George this drive has been magnificent...
...but I'm sorry to say
I have to slow you down.
- What the hell for?
- We'll have to cut off your supplies.
Gasoline, ammunition, everything.
We're up against new priorities.
- I think I smell Montgomery.
- Take it easy, George.
There are serious issues involved.
Political issues.
By God, it is Montgomery.
The launching sites for the B-2 bombs are all in his area.
Churchill wants those bases destroyed.
Hitler kills more civilians in London than soldiers.
Expect Montgomery to do anything?
You give me gasoline and I'll gain ground with it, kill Germans too.
Give me 400,000 gallons.
I'll go to Berlin.
George, I can't do it.
The Siegfried line is an empty shell.
They stripped the equipment and sent it east.
Iùs crawling with cows.
I can punch through in two days.
There's no use in arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.
Why did you pick me to command?
I didn't pick you.
Ike picked you.
George, you have performed brilliantly.
You are loyal, dedicated.
You're one of the best I've got, but you don't know when to shut up.
George, you're a pain in the neck.
I have a lot of faults, Brad.
But ingratitude isn't one of them.
I owe you a lot.
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.
What I can't stand about Monty is, he won't admit it.
Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.
The point tank has run out too.
And there's a kraut column up ahead.
Yeah, I know.
PATTON:
Were you in command here, captain?
I was in command.
My tank platoon was supporting an infantry company.
Tanks ran out of gas, so we had to fight it out.
We started 11:00 last night.
Finished a couple hours ago.
This morning the fighting was hand-to-hand.
I had a dream last night.
In my dream it came to me...
...that right now the whole Nazi Reich is mine for the taking.
Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.
Now I have precisely the right instrument...
...at precisely the right moment of history and exactly the right place.
The Saar?
This will change too, very quickly.
Like a planet spinning off into the universe.
A moment like this won't come again for 1000 years.
All I need is a few miserable gallons of gasoline.
Right now, the weak spot is here.
In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.
What about the fortifications that were done in Metz?
Fixed fortifications, huh?
Monuments to the stupidity of man.
When mountain ranges and oceans could be overcome...
...anything built by man can be overcome.
You know how I'm sure they're finished out there?
The carts.
They're using carts to move their wounded and the supplies.
The carts came to me in my dream.
I couldn't figure it out.
Then I remembered...
...that nightmare in the snow.
The agonizing retreat from Moscow.
How cold it was.
They threw the wounded and what was left of the supplies in the carts.
Napoleon was finished.
Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.
Only the snow.
Look at this, Cod.
I love it.
God help me, I do love it so.
I love it more than my life.
NARRATOR: Paris is liberated, and French troops lead the way.
The Allies march into the city after four years of Nazi occupation.
The hard-fighting French
2nd Armored Division...
...under Major General
Jacques Leclerc...
...gets an unforgettable welcome...
...as they enter their beloved Paris.
In a powerful drive to the north...
...General Montgomery cuts off and bypasses the French coastal towns...
...of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.
Pushing on to capture the vital
Belgian port of Antwerp.
Meanwhile, the main body of Patton 's army...
...resupplied now and rolling like a juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.
Nazi resistance appears to crumble.
It seems that nothing can stop our troops from driving on into Germany.
- Sir, General Bradley on your line.
- Good, good.
Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead across the Saar.
I'm on my way to Germany.
Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot of trouble up north.
I want you to transfer tank armor to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.
Brad, you can't do that.
George, listen.
I don't have time to argue.
There's a lot of enemy activity up around Ardennes.
No, I don't know how serious it is...
...but Ike wants us to meet with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.
Be there at 1100.
Yes, sir.
PATTON: There's absolutely no reason for us to assume...
...that the Germans are mounting a major offense.
The weather is awful and their supplies are low.
The Germans haven't mounted a winter attack since Frederick the Great.
Therefore I believe thaùs exactly what they're going to do.
I want you to start making contingency plans...
...for pulling out of our eastward attack.
Changing directions 90 degrees, moving up to Luxembourg.
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.
I want you to plan for three possible axes of attack.
From Diekirch, due north.
From OrlÈans to Bastogne.
From Neufch‚teau against the German left flank.
We've identified four German armies:
The 7th, the 5th Panzer,
6th SS Panzer and the 15th.
They've hit us with 26 divisions.
They've overran two regimens of the 106th Division.
And 7500 of our men were forced to surrender.
Our concern is that von Rundstedt...
...has the 101 st Airborne trapped here at Bastogne.
Bastogne, by the way, is the key to this entire area.
If we can hold it, we can break up the entire German offensive.
If they take it, we're in serious trouble.
Ike wants to know if anybody can go...
...and relieve the 101 st before they're torn to pieces.
There's nothing Montgomery can do.
At any rate, not for some weeks.
What about you, George?
I can attack with three divisions in 48 hours.
I'd give myself some leeway.
Ike wants a realistic estimate,
George.
You're in the middle of a fight now.
Iùs over a hundred miles to Bastogne.
My staff's already working out the details.
Frankly, I don't see how iùs possible.
Not in this kind of weather.
I should have thought you'd want to fall back and regroup.
Not me. I don't like to pay for the same real estate twice.
TEDDER:
But what about your men?
You can't cart them off 100 miles, expecting them to attack without rest.
I trained these men.
They'll do what I tell them to do.
We hadn't realized you were so popular with your troops, general.
I'm not. They'll do it because they're good soldiers.
And because they realize, as I do, that we can still lose this war.
Then I think I can speak for Field Marshal Montgomery.
He'd say you're asking the impossible of your men.
Of course he would.
Cause he's never realized thaùs what we're in business for.
General McAuliffe refused a German surrender demand.
You know what he said?
What?
He said, "Nuts."
Keep them moving, colonel.
A man that eloquent has to be saved.
This is where it pays off.
The training and discipline.
No other outfit in the world.
Pulled out of a winter battle, move a hundred miles.
Going to a major attack with no rest, no sleep, no hot food.
God! God, I'm proud of these men!
Sir, von Rundstedùs thrown another panzer division against Bastogne.
101 st Airborne's barely holding on.
We need damned air cover. If we had decent weather, we might make it.
CARVER:
General Mason, sir.
Hello, Mase?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.
Cannibalize your antiaircraft units and turn them into riflemen.
Yes, every last one you can find.
Good evening, general.
I just got the weather report for tomorrow. More snow.
There goes our air cover.
We may have to wait for better weather.
Brave men dying up there. I won't wait, not an hour, not a minute.
Going to keep moving.
Is that clear?
We're going to attack all night and attack tomorrow morning!
If we're not victorious...
...let no one come back alive.
You know something, general?
Sometimes, they can't tell when you're acting and when you're not.
It isn't important for them to know.
Iùs only important for me to know.
- You want to see me, general?
- Oh, yeah, chaplain.
I'm tired of 3rd Army having to fight Germans...
...with supreme command, no gasoline...
...and now this ungodly weather.
I want a prayer, a weather prayer.
A weather prayer, sir?
Yes, leùs see if you can't get God working with us.
Gonna take a thick rug for that kind of praying.
I don't care if it takes a flying carpet.
I don't know how this will be received, general.
Praying for good weather so we can kill our fellow man.
I assure you, because of my relations with the Almighty...
...if you write a good prayer, we'll have good weather.
And I expect that prayer within an hour.
Yes, sir.
"Almighty and most merciful Father...
...we humbly beseech Thee...
...of Thy great goodness...
...to restrain this immoderate weather...
...with which we've had to contend.
Grant us fair weather for battle.
Graciously hearken to us...
...as soldiers who call upon Thee...
...that armed with Thy power...
...we may advance from victory to victory...
...and crush the oppression...
...and wickedness of our enemies...
...and establish Thy justice...
...among men and nations.
Amen."
Weather's perfect.
Cod, get me that chaplain.
He's in good with the Lord and I want to decorate him.
Hiya, general!
NARRATOR: Supported by medium bombers and fighter bombers...
...flying sorties against German positions...
...elements of the 3rd Army...
...spearheaded by the
4th Armored Division...
...drive into Bastogne...
...to relieve its 18,000 defenders...
...on the day after Christmas.
During this operation,
3rd Army moved farther and faster...
...and engaged more divisions in less time...
...than any other army in the history of the United States.
Excuse me, sir.
General Katkov would like to know if you'll join him...
...to drink to the surrender of Germany.
My compliments to the general.
Please inform him that I do not care to drink with him...
...or any other Russian son of a bitch.
Sir...
...I cannot tell the general that.
You tell him that.
Tell him word for word.
The general says he thinks that...
...you are a son of a bitch too.
Okay. I'll drink to that.
One son of a bitch to another.
Is it true that Roosevelt, before he died...
...promised you a command in the Pacific?
Yes. But now that he's gone, I don't think there's much chance of that.
Doug MacArthur doesn't want me up there.
We're told of "wonder weapons" the Germans were working on:
Long-range rockets, push-button bombing...
...weapons that don't need soldiers.
"Wonder weapon"?
My God, I don't see the wonder in them.
Killing without heroics. Nothing is glorified, nothing is reaffirmed.
No heroes, no cowards, no troops.
No generals.
Only those that are left alive and those that are left...
...dead.
I'm glad I won't live to see it.
REPORTER: Iùs said you're still using former Nazis in key positions.
Despite the denazification policy.
Well, if I'm supplied with trained personnel...
...I'll get rid of the Nazis.
Until then, I'll use them to keep the railroads and telephones working.
After all, didn't most ordinary Nazis join the Party...
...in about the same way Americans become Republicans or Democrats?
Yes, thaùs about it.
You agree that national policy be made by civilians, not by the military?
Of course. But the politicians never let us finish.
They always stop short and leave us with another war.
You thinking about our Russian allies?
Did you say if you found your army between the Germans and the Russians...
...you'd attack in both directions?
No, I never said that.
I never said any such thing.
But I wish I had.
Sir, there's a call on your line from supreme headquarters, General Smith.
Bedell?
Ike is furious.
How could you compare Republicans and Democrats to the Nazi Party?
And the statement that you refuse to denazify...
...has the Russians, the British, everybody, screaming.
Well, the hell with the Mongoloid Russians.
We've given them Berlin, Prague,
God knows what else.
They gonna dictate policy too?
George, don't be a fool.
The war in Europe is over.
Washington dictates policy.
The war shouldn't be over. We should stop pussyfooting about the Russians!
We'll have to fight them anyway. Why not do it now, when the army's here?
Instead of disarming Germans leùs get them to help fight the Bolsheviks.
You better shut up.
This line may be tapped.
I don't care. I'll tell you...
...we've been fighting the wrong people.
You and I don't have to get involved, you're so soft about it.
Leave it to me. In 10 days
I'll have us at war with them...
...and make it look like their fault!
George, you're mad.
You're absolutely out of your mind!
Well, I'm no diplomat.
I'm a combat soldier.
Thaùs all they understand.
Get Ike to give me the word, and I'll kick them back to Russia!
Shall I call the artist back, sir?
Oh, the hell with it.
Nobody wants to see a picture of me.
I'm mad!
Don't you know that?
Field Marshal Montgomery, his majesty is prepared...
...to receive the next chief of the imperial general staff.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.
George.
Well, gentlemen...
...all good things must come to an end.
And the best thing thaùs happened to me...
...in my life...
...has been...
...uh...
...the honor...
...and privilege...
...of commanding the 3rd Army.
Goodbye...
...and God bless you.
Brad...
...they've taken the 3rd Army away from me.
I know.
I thought we could have dinner together tonight.
Thank you, Brad.
Thaùs damn thoughtful.
I appreciate it.
Right now, I think I'll take
Willie for a walk.
George, look out!
After all I've been through...
...imagine getting killed by an oxcart.
No, Brad, there's only one proper way for a professional soldier to die.
Thaùs from the last bullet of the last battle of the last war.
At least the 3rd Army earned its pay.
In our drive across Europe, we liberated...
...12,000 cities and towns...
...and inflicted a million and a half enemy casualties.
I sense from now on, just being a good soldier won't mean a thing.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to be diplomats, administrators, you name it.
God help us.
George, I want to say one thing.
You've done a magnificent job here in Europe.
Thaùs right, George.
That soldier you slapped did more to win the war than any other private.
I'll see you for dinner.
Six-thirty?
PATTON:
For over a thousand years...
...Roman conquerors returning from the wars...
...enjoyed the honor of a triumph, a tumultuous parade.
In the procession came trumpeters and musicians and strange animals...
...from the conquered territories...
...together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments.
The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot...
...the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him.
Sometimes, his children, robed in white...
...stood with him in the chariot, or rode the trace horses.
A slave stood behind the conqueror...
...holding a golden crown...
...and whispering in his ear a warning...
...that all glory...
...is fleeting.
Is that him?
Yes.
Oliver!
[ECHOES]
God be with you, Oliver.
And you too, John.
This is Henry Ireton, a good friend.
Good day to you, sir.
Mr. lreton. l've just been taking a last look at my land.
We had heard you were leaving, Mr. Cromwell.
We came from London directly.
You could have saved yourself the effort, Mr. lreton.
If we could discuss it,
Oliver, I'm sure--
There is nothing to discuss, John.
Well, come back to my house.
You've got a long journey back.
You must forgive the manner of our table, Mr. Pym.
Our best crockery is packed for the voyage.
Bridget, fetch the bread.
Yes, Mother.
We had hoped to persuade your husband to change his mind about going to America, ma'am. l should have thought you would know Oliver better than that, Mr. Pym. lt was not an easy decision, John.
This is my country, my land. God has been good to me here.
Then, sir, why are you leaving? l have a family, Mr. lreton. l owe it to my sons to make a better life for them.
England is no longer a country for a young man. l recall you often spoke out strongly in
Parliament for the rights and privileges of the common people.
Ah.
That was a long time ago, Mr. lreton.
I had a vision then.
A great nation.
Prosperous, God-fearing, good laws, strong, respected throughout the world.
That was the England
I dreamed of.
Well, sir, you are a squire now, a man of property.
Perhaps you no longer care for the common people.
Perhaps I've been misinformed, sir. l thought, as a Puritan, you would see it as your God-given duty to do the Lord's work in this land, regardless of sacrifice.
Mr. lreton, l was fighting for the liberty of the common people when you were in knee breeches.
Then why are you leaving? l am leaving because this country crawls with greed and corruption.
It is governed by adventurers and profiteers who think more of their pockets than their principles. l am leaving, sir, because we have a king who taxes the rich beyond its means and steals land from the poor to maintain his lavish court and his Catholic wife.
Now, when Parliament objected against these injustices he closed his Parliament down.
And our man dare not speak his mind for fear of imprisonment.
Oh, yes.
All my life l believed it was God's work to fight against such tyranny.
But God has turned his back upon this nation, and we are leaving it.
And what if Parliament should be recalled,
Mr. Cromwell?
And why should a king do that?
He needs money, Oliver.
What? To build another palace?
No.
To fight a war.
A war, John?
A war against whom?
The Scots have assembled and army on our border.
They may invade us at any moment.
The king needs money to raise an army.
Ah.
By the king's own decree,
Parliament has not sat these past 1 2 years.
And now the king needs money.
Once Parliament has assembled, it will lie within our power to change the whole structure of government in this country.
John, how many times did we sit in Parliament in the old days and how many resolutions did we pass?
And how many times did this king overrule us?
Oh, the king can have his war with Scotland.
We will be in America.
There will be a war, Mr. Cromwell, but it will not be with Scotland.
Henry.
With whom, Mr. Ireton?
Henry, we have argued this matter many times.
I'm convinced of it.
A war against whom, Mr. lreton?
Against the king, sir.
The king?
You mean a civil war?
In England?
[CHUCKLES]
You know not the ways of this nation, Mr. lreton.
Such things do not happen here.
And in my opinion, it is long overdue. l will not have such talk in my house.
It is common enough talk these days, I fear.
Then it is treasonable talk!
And I will not have it in my house! l mark the time when you were much against the king and never feared to say so.
In truth, there is much in this king that does offend me.
Yet, with all, I would not take up arms against him, and I would oppose any move to do so. ln such a cause, our swords will be in God's hands.
It's an odd thing, Mr. Ireton.
Every man who wages war believes God is on his side. l warrant God should often wonder who is on his. Good evening, sir.
Well, if I did give you offence, sir, I beg your pardon.
You're a young man, Mr. lreton. lt's fitting a young man should want to change the world.
Not the world, sir.
Only England.
With a civil war.
Good evening, Mrs. Cromwell.
Good evening, Mr. lreton.
I'll get your cloak,
Mr. Ireton.
I hope you'll forgive him.
Goodbye, John.
God be with you, Oliver.
[YELLlNG]
[COWS MOOlNG]
You've no right to do this.
Leave them animals be.
This is the common land.
[GRUNTING]
Any man who raises a hand against the king's men will be arrested.
You have no right to do this.
This land is ours.
Well, now it belongs to the Earl of Manchester.
By whose authority?
By the authority of the king.
Then l say the king is a thief!
You're under arrest.
Take him away!
Bastards!
Look at him, now. What's he done?
He's done nothing.
Release that man!
Who the devil are you?
This man works for me.
Whatever he has done, l will take full responsibility.
He has spoken treason against the king. Will you take responsibility for that?
The rights to pasture belong to the common people.
By what authority,
Lord Manchester, do you take that away?
By the authority of His Majesty's commissioners, granting me and my friends full rights to this land for the purpose of improvement.
Such a contract cannot be legal. lt is in violation of the law of this land.
As a magistrate, you should know the king is the law of this land.
On the contrary, my Lord
Manchester. lt is the king's duty to maintain the law.
This is common land. lt belongs to the people.
This is my land, and you are trespassing.
It's only out of respect for your rank I don't have you arrested for obstructing the law.
Captain Lundsford!
My lord?
See that no unauthorized person enters this area.
Yes, my lord.
Remove these people.
[CHATTERING]
[CHURCH BELL RINGING]
MAN: Good morrow to you, squire.
Good morrow, Mrs. Cromwell.
Squire, have you news of my husband?
It's in God's hands,
Mrs. Carter.
And in the king's.
Aye.
PRlEST:
Let us pray.
Almighty God, look down upon this thy house and we, thy humble servants.
Grant us the spirit of thy grace through
Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
Who has done this?
Answer me. Who has done this?
An edict, squire, from the archbishop himself and by order of the king.
By order of the king.
Is the Church of England not a Protestant church?
Would the king turn the house of God into a Roman temple?
Mr. Cromwell, l beseech you.
Does the king think that God can be bought with gold, trinkets and gilded rubbish? l know only that l have been instructed.
Has this king forgotten the Reformation?
[CRASHING]
Mr. Cromwell--
Away with it.
Popish idolatry!
[CLATTERING]
Did the Lord not say unto Moses:
"Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image nor bow down to them''?
Has this king forgotten the Spanish lnquisition? ls the Roman Catholic Church to have a seat in Westminster?
[SCREAMS]
Oh, my God.
My God.
Oh, my God!
Goddamn this king.
MAN:
King's guard, attention!
Here we are, my lord.
[GRUNTS]
That'll do, damn it. l'm not a damned cripple.
Me sticks, where are me sticks? Come over here, boy.
BO Y: Here they are, my lord.
Give me the damned things.
And who the devil are you?
Edward Hyde.
Ah.
Let's in to His Majesty.
Where is he?
He's at prayers, my lord.
Aye.
He might do well to pray and all.
We're gonna need some help.
First the lrish and now the Scots.
You doesn't turn your back on either of them.
Let us give thanks to our mighty God, that he has seen fit to bless this table with the fruits of his bounty.
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, amen.
Amen.
I did remark, madam, with some distress that His Highness,
Prince Charles, was absent from prayers this morning.
He was with me, my lord.
He did pray with you?
In your chapel?
Yes, my lord. l am most displeased. lt is not fitting that a future king of England should make his devotions in a Catholic chapel.
Your private beliefs are respected.
But this is a Protestant country and as head of both church and state, it is my God-given duty to see that it so remains.
His Highness found the whole business so boring, my lord, that he fell asleep.
Didn't you, Charles?
Yes, madam.
I believe you will find your church as solid as ever, my lord.
Nevertheless, you will kindly see that it does not happen again.
Yes, my lord.
Your Majesty, the Earl of Strafford awaits your pleasure.
My good Lord Strafford, welcome back to England.
Thank you, my lord.
Your Majesty.
Your Royal Highness.
Most noble sovereign.
A chair for his lordship.
Thank you, my lord.
I'm sorry to see you in pain. lt is the agues from the bogs of lreland, my lord. Godforsaken place.
Saving your presence, my lord bishop.
We would not have summoned you, Lord Strafford, had the situation here not been of a greatest urgency.
You've doubtless heard that the Scottish rebels are marching on Newcastle?
Aye, my lord.
You will whip these barbarians to their senses.
But what of lreland, my lord?
We'll deal with lreland in good time.
You'll march an army on Scotland.
Army. What army?
Most of your army lies rotting beneath the bogs of Ireland.
What's left of it is hard-pressed to keep law and order.
Then we will raise a second army.
I fear Your Majesty may find that easier said than done.
What? l guarantee l could raise 3000 men under arms inside a month!
But could you guarantee their loyalty, my lord?
Is there an Englishman living who wouldn't draw a sword against his king's enemies?
There would be many
Englishmen, my Lord Strafford, who would more readily draw swords against the king.
My God, who is this jackanapes that mouths such treason in your presence, my lord?
You've been away a long time, Strafford.
Much here has changed.
Aye, I can see it has. l fear Sir Edward but speaks the truth.
To put an effective army in the field against the Scots will cost almost a million pounds.
The Crown does not have a million pounds.
Are we just going to sit here then and do nothing?
Then l will summon
Parliament and instruct them to provide money.
Parliament?!
The king of England go cap in hand to the common people, like a--?
A beggar.
Aye! A beggar? l have no choice. l say take the money.
You, my lord, are absolved before God and before man from any such action.
For in extreme necessity, the king is acquitted from all rule of government and can do all that his power permits.
Power? Where is the power of a king without an army? l'll warrant you, l'll raise an army.
We'll reduce this kingdom to submission in one summer!
Do you mean, sir, that l should declare war on my own people?
Aye!
Before they declare war on you.
Well, sons, there it is.
Parliament House.
Upon that place rests all the hopes of this nation for a settlement of its ills in peace.
Do you think it could come to war, Father?
Well, Oliver, when men run out of words, they reach for their swords.
Let's hope we can keep them talking.
MAN: The king demands money to raise an army.
[YELLING]
MAN: This House demands redress for grievances.
Grievances which the past
12 years have laid heavy upon the nation. l say that--
Might l be heard? l say, therefore, this House is resolved that we'll vote...
Welcome back to Parliament.
...no money for the king!
Order! Order!
Neither will we take up arms against our Scottish brethren, unless...
Unless this Parliament is allowed to function as the true voice of the people of England.
And not as a gathering of lackeys to the king.
[CHEERING]
Sir Edward Hyde,
Your Majesty.
Well, Sir Edward?
Your Majesty. l believe the House will grant a loan to the Crown.
But only on certain conditions.
Conditions?
What do you mean, conditions?
What are these conditions,
Sir Edward?
In essence, sire, that the Crown relinquishes all authority over Parliament.
And who put forward this proposal?
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden.
The Puritans.
They were well supported, my lord.
And they call themselves Englishmen?
My God, it's enough to make a man deny his birthright.
Yet, withal, they still be Englishmen.
They make a mockery of the Crown!
They abuse the privilege of free speech with sedition and treason.
You're too loud,
Lord Strafford. lt is most unpleasant to the ear.
So it has come to this, my lord.
That you now bargain for your Crown.
What would you have me do?
Arrest every man who opposes me?
Hang them?
Would you rather make a gift of the Crown of England to the rabble in the street? lt lies beyond my power to arrest a citizen without proper charges.
Charges are immaterial.
Such an act would subvert the fundamental laws of this land, madam.
Such an act might save the Crown of England, my lord. l've governed this country justly and fairly these 12 years without reference to any Parliament.
You may be assured, l do not intend now to be schooled in my high office by illiterate farm hands, cobblers and basket weavers.
My Lord Strafford, you will rid us of these troublemakers:
Pym, Ireton, all of them. l'll arrest every one of them, my lord.
As you will. l shall need a warrant.
That is imperative.
And what will the charges be, my lord?
You're an experienced officer of the Crown, Strafford.
You do not need to be instructed by me.
Mr. Speaker.
May l have permission to address the House?
SPEAKER: By all means, sir.
Gentlemen.
A matter has come to my notice, which is of deep concern to me and will, l am sure, be to every single member of this House.
The Earl of Strafford has, this day, put his hand to a warrant for the arrest and impeachment of myself and four other honourable members of this House upon a charge of high treason.
[YELLING]
Though Strafford's hand be upon this warrant, l see in this business, not the hand of Strafford, but that of the king.
My lords! l beseech you, do not condemn this king too hastily.
For l am persuaded he has been ill-advised upon this course.
Is not a king to be judged by those from whom he seeks counsel?
He is not! lt is not the function of this House to sit in judgement upon this king.
The fault lies with those very people from whom the king has sought counsel. l therefore move that this House demands the arrest and impeachment of the Earl of Strafford upon a charge of high treason against the people of this nation.
Silence! Order!
The motion has been proposed.
Let it be put now to the question.
Is the motion agreed?
MEN: No!
In favour of the motion?
MEN:
Aye! Aye! Aye!
The ayes have it. l think my Lord
Strafford's condition will soon be far happier than mine.
[PRAYING IN FRENCH]
Do you see, madam?
Do you see now what you've made me do?
[CONTINUES PRAYING]
Gentlemen, His Majesty.
Pray be seated.
Your coming is nothing if not timely.
My Lord Strafford's head has but barely fallen.
Now, gentlemen, it is for you to speak.
Your Majesty, you see here the leaders of all parties of the House.
And though we be divided on many issues, we are of one accord. ln that we place above all else, our allegiance and loyalty to our most gracious sovereign.
For which reason we are deeply anxious for a settlement of the differences between us.
I share your sentiment,
Sir Edward.
The issue be this, my lord.
Parliament is persuaded that without the right to govern this nation by the will of the people and with God's guidance, we be not a Parliament at all.
And that unless some constitutional reformation be brought about, we would as well go back to our homes and our farms as pursue this mockery of a government one more day.
In short, Mr. Pym, you're asking me to relinquish my sovereign power over Parliament.
It does amount to that,
Your Majesty. l do swear that l hold this England and its laws dearer to my heart than any here.
But gentlemen, if you were to reduce me to a figurehead, a puppet king manipulated by Parliament, how then would I serve my country?
What manner of king would l be?
I am persuaded,
Your Majesty, that England must move forward to a more enlightened form of government based upon a true representation of a free people.
Such an institution is known as democracy, sir.
A democracy, Mr...?
Cromwell, sir.
Democracy, Mr. Cromwell, was a Greek drollery based on the foolish notion that there are extraordinary possibilities in very ordinary people. lt is the ordinary people, my lord, who would most readily lay down their lives in defence of your realm. lt is simply that being ordinary, they would prefer to be asked and not told.
You know, as l do, that even as we sit here, the Scots rebels are invading this land and not an English sword is raised against them. l beg you, therefore, let us bury our differences in defence of both our church and kingdom.
The Scots invade our land and all is urgency and alarm. ln the past 12 months our lrish colonists have been slaughtered, our churches desecrated, our clergy persecuted.
The Crown has been oddly reluctant to defend our church and kingdom over there, sir.
By my guard, l would as soon take up arms against Rome than against the Scots.
Would you have me declare war on the entire Catholic world, Mr. Cromwell? lt is your duty to defend our church, sir.
We are speaking now of a matter of international policy. ls Your Majesty sure that it's not a matter of domestic expediency?
Come, sir! l would remind you, sir, that you are addressing your king.
Mr. Cromwell, you are impertinent.
Such issues are beyond good manners, sir.
Catholicism is more than a religion, it is a political power.
Therefore, l am led to believe there will be no peace in lreland until the Catholic Church is crushed.
Your Majesty.
CHARLES: These gentlemen are from the Parliament.
Your Majesty,
Parliament has drawn up this document in which are set out our main grievances. lt is our belief that the demands made here are only those that are just and lawful and in the best interests of both Crown and kingdom.
I shall examine these proposals most carefully, Mr. Pym.
Gentlemen.
It is not too late, my lord.
You have the power still.
And with God's help, the strength to use that power.
Oh, my dearest Charles.
I married you as a king and as a man. l beseech you, do not disappoint me in either aspect.
''This House has time and again expressed its wholehearted loyalty to the Crown.
Yet... doth Parliament await in vain for a gesture..."
The king is coming with a warrant to arrest you,
John Hampden, Henry lreton,
Sir Arthur Haselrig and Oliver Cromwell under charge of high treason. l suggest you leave immediately.
''--that if the issues that divide the king from his country be not soon resolved, then these issues may soon divide the nation."
[CHEERING]
The king is coming with a warrant for our arrest.
What?
We must leave at once.
Oliver, your name is on it.
Come!
My lords! My lords!
Gentlemen! The king comes.
He comes with 100 men-at-arms.
The doors! The doors!
Bolt the doors!
Stand aside, gentlemen, if you please.
MAN: Halt!
Open in the name of the king!
Mr. Speaker.
Gentlemen, you must pardon this infringement of your privilege but I will not detain you long.
Mr. Speaker, I must make bold with your chair. l have here a warrant for the arrest of five members of this House.
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden,
Oliver Cromwell and Sir Arthur Haselrig upon a charge of treason.
I see that the birds have flown.
Mr. Speaker, where are these gentlemen?
May it please
Your Majesty,
I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak except as this House gives me leave.
Well, sir, l have eyes. l see that one of them is here.
Captain.
CAPTAIN:
Take him!
Any action against a member of this House is a breach of privilege.
I move this House declares as public enemies any who lay hands upon its members.
And I further move... l further move that any such action against this House be considered a crime against the people and treason against this nation.
[CHEERING]
So be it.
Mr. Speaker, you will inform the members of this House that their presence is no longer required by the nation.
This Parliament is, by my authority, terminated, dissolved.
Your Majesty!
Are you aware that by your action in this House today you may have pushed this nation to the brink of civil war?
Now do we see in what contempt this king holds this
House and this nation?
It be either your king or your Parliament.
Honourable members, the decision is yours.
But l beseech you, in the name of God, think well on it.
Fairfax.
Gentlemen.
I move that this House demand the control of the militia and that this country be put in an immediate posture of defence.
Mr. Speaker.
My lords.
Honourable members.
This nation is now in a state of civil war.
And let us pray that God in his mercy will give us strength in this terrible and most unhappy hour.

[MEN CHEERING]
Morning, William.
Give you good day, squire.
Why the coffin? lf it be God's will l die, squire, then l would have a decent Christian burial.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that, William. l need you in the farm.
[MEN LAUGH]
Hello, Father.
Father.
Morning. Where's your sword, Richard?
I have no sword, Father.
You must get one and wear it. lt's a mark of your rank, captain.
Yes.
MAN: God bless thee!
Hallelujah, hallelujah, brethren. lt is the Lord's work we do this day!
The Lord's work--
This is no place for you, Hugh, though you be welcome.
I've consulted God on this matter,
Mr. Cromwell. l asked him,
"Lord, whose side are you on?"
And he answered me, saying, ''On the side of truth and justice.''
So here I am.
MAN:
Company, forward!
MEN SlNGlNG:
Lift up your heads ye gates of brass
Ye bars of iron yield
And let the king of glory
Pass the crosses in the field
That banner brighter
Than the star that leaves
A trail of light
[CHEERING]
Greetings, Uncle.
'Tis a fair day for a fight.
Where be the enemy?
My lords, I present my nephew.
His Highness,
Prince Rupert, Count
Palatine of the Rhine.
My lords, I give you greetings.
LORDS: Your Highness.
And good Cousin Charles, most noble Prince of Wales.
How fare you, young sir? l am well, thank you, cousin.
So let us to action.
For I do swear by this sword that within a week we will have severed every round head from its shoulders!
Well said, Your Highness.
Let the standard be raised.
[FANFARE PLAYS]
Get those guns moving!
[SHEEP CRYING]
[MEN SINGING]
Thou shalt proclaim his life
Though granted...
MAN:
Halt!
Halt!
Where the devil are we?
Edgehill, my lord, over there.
Morning, Robert.
Morning, Edward.
Damn me, they've got a lot of fellows there.
Where's Cromwell?
Approaching now, my lord.
Morning, Cromwell.
Morning, my lord.
Your men fit, colonel?
My men are ready, my lord.
You seem damned eager to get into this business,
Cromwell.
We all enter this reluctantly, but the die is cast.
Is that not so, Lord Essex?
You are right.
Well, to your position.
Let no man move except upon my signal.
And may God look kindly upon us this day.
Amen to that.
Missed my breakfast.
Damned tricky things, stomachs.
God be with you, men.
MEN: God bless you.
God be with you.
Take care of yourself,
William.
The Lord'll take care of me, squire.
Have faith, John.
I have, squire. Come on, lads.
Look to your muskets.
Have your muskets at the ready. Come on, now.
Father.
May God take care of you, Richard and be with you, Oliver.
And with you too, Father.
HUGH: ''O Lord, defend our cause against the face of the enemy.
Save us from the violence of the enemy. O Lord of hope, fight for us that we may glorify thee."
O Lord, God of mercy.
Put thy strength in our hands this day.
Give not the battle to the strong, but to the righteous.
And be thou, O merciful God, our saviour and mighty deliverer.
Defend me from them that rise up against me. ln the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
MEN:
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Father, look. lt's Lord Essex.
[SHEEP CRYING]
Come, cousin.
Let's take a good look at these Roundheads.
Your Majesty.
God's teeth, have we not parleyed enough these past months?
Well, Essex, are you prepared?
We are. Shall we begin at 10?
Make it 9, my lord. l'm positively starving.
Then in God's name, let's to it. lt is agreed then, 9:00.
And by my faith, which l have not,
I swear that within the hour, this field will be strewn with English dead.
If this be so, they will have been killed by Englishmen.
For we have not seen fit to import foreign mercenaries into our ranks.
I will mark you well for that insult, sir.
Be on your guard!
MAN 1 :
Colours to the rear!
MAN 2:
Colours to the rear!
MAN 3: The Lord is our strength. Praise the Lord!
What in the name of God are we waiting for?
Ireton! l thought we came here to do battle.
We're waiting for the appointed time.
The appointed time?
Colonel Hampden, commence firing!
Fire!
What the devil is that fool doing?
Artillery, commence firing!
Fire!
O Lord, thou knowest how busy I must be this day. lf l forget thee, do not thou forget me.
MAN:
Fire!
Fire!
You'd better send Fairfax in.
Mm.
Bugler, sound the charge.
[BUGLE SOUNDING]

At the gallop!
It's getting too damned close for my liking.
Sound general retreat.
Sound general retreat.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
My lord, why in the name of Christ did you sound the retreat?
Colonel, you've countermined my orders once today. You'll do as you're told, sir.
Hold your ground, in the name of God!
Hold your ground!
Well, Uncle, did you ever see a quarry so swiftly put to flight?
The king will forever keep this field and this day's service in grateful remembrance.
[MEN CHEERING]
[HORSE NEIGHING]
Come nightfall, we shall bury our dead.
And then, by God, we shall bury this army.
With such pitiful men in our ranks, it were better this war were never fought.
Not a drop of English blood soiled this English land. lt's a bad officer who blames his men, Cromwell.
I blame them not, my lord, for they are simple men.
But what match are farmer's boys against gentlemen's sons?
The battle is not yet lost, Cromwell.
This battle were lost before it began, my lord.
And in like manner, so will this war. ln the morning, l'm returning to Cambridge.
If you desert the field,
I'll have you arrested.
This war will not be won with untrained ploughmen, apprentices, old, decaying serving men.
We need men with fire in their bowels who fear the Lord, but not the enemy!
As God is my witness, l am resolved that this battle will be won.
Therefore, it's my intention to return to Cambridge, and raise an army of handpicked men, the like of which this nation has never seen!
With or without your permission, my Lord Manchester.
[MEN YELLING]
[CLANKING]
Bristol will not be permitted to fall. lt is our only seaport in the west, and if General Goring is incapable of holding it, then I will dispatch someone who can. l've a mind to see Bristol, my lord. lt is a fair city, l hear.
Then I shall place Bristol in your command, nephew. Now, my lord general, should our forces--
Your Majesty.
Yes, what is it?
News of Cromwell's army,
Your Majesty.
Come forward.
At last, Old lronsides ventures forth.
Well, speak, man.
They're about six miles away, Your Majesty.
Just south of Naseby.
By my reckoning, there be about 1000 horse and 2000 afoot.
And what news of Manchester's army? l saw no other army, Your Majesty.
Was not Cromwell to join Manchester's forces at Naseby?
That was our intelligence,
Your Majesty.
Then Manchester be still in Lincoln.
So Cromwell comes with his army of 3000 to our 7000.
By your leave, Uncle. Your Highness.
General Astley, sound the alert. l want every man in full battle order at once.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
By God, we have him!
Manchester!
[ECHOING]
Where in the name of Christ is he?
Know you not we are at war? ln God's name l do swear we fight this war single-handed.
Oliver.
What bloody treachery is this?
We came to meet
Manchester and instead we find the king's army.
Well, I shall take on the king.
And after that if needs must, l'll take on Manchester as well!
Before you stands the enemy, his three to every one of us.
And where, in God's name, is Manchester?
My Lord Manchester will rue the day he has not joined us here.
And now to your positions.
These tactics we have practiced often enough these past six months now let us put them to the test.
For upon this field of Naseby, we'll turn the tide of this unhappy war.
God be with you all. ls this wise, Oliver?
We're heavily outnumbered.
Was not Gideon outnumbered by the Amalekites?
It is not numbers that count, but speed and surprise.
Let no man move, except upon the word of his commander!
Though we be outnumbered, we shall win this battle!
I promise you!
So now put your faith in God and keep your powder dry.
[MEN CHEERING]
Halt!
Attack order.
Double line abreast.
Forward.
MAN: Forward!
The man must be mad.
Prepare to attack.
Prepare to attack!
[DOG WHIMPERS]
Our swords are in God's hand.
And our faith is in the Lord.
Charge!
Fire!
Forward!
[HORSES NEIGH]
Colonel!
Regroup! Regroup!
After them!
Advance!
To the rear!
Forward!
Come on, lads!
At the gallop!
Your Majesty, may l suggest that we withdraw?
No.
[CHATTERING]
MAN:
Who goes there?
RlCHARD:
Captain Cromwell, 3rd Cavalry.
Richard.
Thanks be to God.
Where is Oliver?
The outrageous incompetence and inefficiency of the high command have tried my patience and that of my hard-pressed army long enough.
By my faith, l swear it would be better that those gallant generals
Essex and Manchester, took up swords with the king.
For then might we be assured of victory.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
For by their reluctance to pursue this war with the intensity it demands, they have proved treacherous both to our cause and to this nation.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
If we beat the king 99 times, he will still be our king and we his subjects.
If he beats us but once, we shall all be hanged. lf that is so, then why in the bowels of Christ did we take up arms against him in the first place?
Gentlemen, honest men have served us faithfully and many have died that this House may sit in freedom and this nation live in liberty.
In the name of God,
I beseech you, do not desert them now.
Unless Parliament supports this war to the full, l am bound to say, in all conscience, that l will lay down my sword and let this House make its peace with the king, be that peace ever so base.
[MEN YELLING]
Then, it is for this House to decide. l move that this
House demands the immediate resignation of the high command upon the grounds that they be no longer competent to command the armed forces of this Parliament.
Order. Order. Order!
The motion has been proposed.
Let it now be put to the question.
Those against Cromwell's motion.
MEN: No!
Those in favour of the motion.
MEN: Aye!
The ayes have it.
The motion be carried.
I move... l move that Colonel
Cromwell be appointed commander in chief of the army.
MEN:
Yeah!
Bristol. We must dispatch aid to Bristol with all possible speed, for as long as Rupert holds
Bristol, this war be not lost.
General Digby, if you can detach your forces in this area and approach Bristol from the east--
To do that, my lord, would be to expose this city to immediate attack.
Then we move the
Marquis of Huntly's army southward.
The marquis, my lord, surrendered to Cromwell's forces yesterday.
Cromwell. I hear nothing but Cromwell, Cromwell.
My lord, it is but a game we play here, a game with wooden armies and paper flags.
'Tis but a block of wood you hold in your hand.
My lords, all l ask for is a little time.
Time, my lord, costs us heavily. lf we can hold on here in Oxford for six weeks, the Scots have promised an army of 20,000 men.
Her Majesty is in communication with my cousin, the king of France, and I have good reason to hope for support from Ireland.
An army from Ireland,
Your Majesty?
I would as soon join forces with Cromwell himself as take up arms with the Catholics!
I am the king and defender of my people and l maintain the right to seek relief from no matter what quarter.
As king, my lord, it is your God-given duty to defend the faith of this nation.
I do what I think to be right, sir.
Catholics as allies! lt is unthinkable!
My God, if it has come to this, let us rather sue for an honourable peace than fight a dishonourable war.
I will not countenance defeat.
Rather than abandon my kingdom to Parliament,
I would come to terms with the devil himself.
Since you came to the throne, Your Majesty, your armies have persistently persecuted our Church in lreland.
And yet, now that your need is great, you turn to us for help.
The king's actions in lreland, Your Excellency, will seem as nothing should these Puritans come to power. lt is not only the Crown of England that is in peril, Excellency.
All institutions of established order throughout the countries of Europe are threatened.
An Irish army of 20,000 men, even 1 5,000, would forestall such a threat and bring this wretched war to a speedy end.
I am instructed to say that His Holiness would permit an lrish force to take up arms in this country.
But there are certain conditions.
First, the Catholic Church in Ireland must be completely restored and permitted to practice freely without interference or oppression.
Secondly, all Protestant churches in lreland must be closed and all Protestant bishops and ministers removed from office.
Oh, there are one or two other minor conditions of little consequence.
What you demand, Excellency, would be a betrayal of my coronation oath as head of the English Church.
You have a duty, Charles, to the Crown.
For without that, you will be head of nothing!
May I tell His Holiness that you will agree to these conditions?
You have something to say to me, Sir Edward?
Your Majesty, His Highness
Prince Rupert attends in the council chamber.
Rupert? Here in Oxford?
Yes, my lord.
I fear Bristol has fallen.
[ddd]
Your Excellency will excuse me.
Your Majesty.
My lords,
His Majesty.
Do you not rise, sir, when your king approaches?
Rise, sir! Or to your knees in shame.
You did give me your most solemn promise that you would hold Bristol for four months.
Yet you have not held it for four weeks!
You promised mountains, yet you perform molehills.
You make a knave of your king.
My lord, we were besieged on all sides.
Our men are foot-weary from battle, ailing with plague and sickness.
Yet you contrived to escape with your life.
I have brought you an army, my lord.
An army 2000 strong, ready and willing to fight on for their king! ln exchange for all the corn and stores you held in Bristol and 200 cannon.
That was the price of your freedom, sir.
I did what I considered to be right!
You deserted your command, sir.
I made a military decision.
A decision that may have cost us this war.
Your action in this matter is of such affliction to me, sir, that it is the greatest trial that has yet befallen me.
My conclusion is to desire you to seek subsistence elsewhere, not in my kingdom.
Most gracious lord, l do not crave forgiveness, for by all as l hold most dear, l do solemnly swear that l acted only in good faith!
The matter is at an end.
I will hear no more.
My lord!
My lord, I beseech you. ln God's name, allow that l may die with honour.
Condemn me not to live.
Captain Lundsford.
Do not put upon these shoulders the terrible shame of exile and dishonour.
I beg you, take my life, most noble lord.
Good Uncle, for pity's sake!
His Highness is to be kept under close guard until such time as he is deported.
Very well, Your Majesty.
Father, Mother says
I'm to go with her tonight to France. ls that your wish, Father?
Yes.
My duty is to stay here with you and fight beside you.
Your place now is at your mother's side, Charles.
You will help her raise money, perhaps an army.
Should l meet my death, and you are safely in France, then England will still have, in you, a lawful king.
You will go with your mother.
I love this land.
And when this great responsibility becomes yours then l pray that with God's help, you will reign more happily than I have done.
Now go, with God's speed and your father's blessing.
Oh, Charles.
I love you.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Your Majesty, it is my most solemn duty to place you under arrest.
By whose command, sir?
By the command of Parliament, sir.
I know of no authority in England above that of the king. lt is upon that issue that this war was fought.
Whither am l to be taken?
To London, sir.
You must grant me a little time to--
We leave for London at once.
And my children, what of them?
We will take care of your children.
His Majesty will have all the time he requires.
As for your children, sir, you may take them with you.
I thank you, sir.
PEOPLE SlNGlNG:
Him serve with fear
His praise foretell
Come ye before him
And rejoice
The Lord ye know
Is God indeed
Without our aid
He did us mak e
We are his flock
General, John Pym is dead.
And for his sheep
He doth us tak e
When did it happen?
This morning.
What is it?
John Pym is dead.
Parliament is discussing peace terms with the king.
Does the army have no say in this?
The army has been ordered to disband. ln God's name, did we fight this war that the politicians should take over behind our backs?!
If Parliament has decided the army will disband, then the army will disband. l say we take the army and march on Parliament.
The sword will not rule this land.
We fought to institute a parliamentary system and overthrow the very tyranny which you now propose.
And who is talking to the king? Parliament? l doubt it. l warrant l know who is doing all the talking.
I have these past three days been in consultation with
His Majesty the king.
And l am pleased to inform the House that the king is now prepared to discuss peace terms provided that the army stand down. l have given this House's assurance that his wishes will be complied with.
Further, in recognition of the very great debt this House owes its commander,
General Cromwell, it is proposed to award him a pension of 3000 pounds a year together with certain estates in the county of Cambridge.
[MEN APPLAUD]
It is further proposed that the sum of 2000 pounds--
Such low treachery is not worthy even of you, my Lord Manchester.
Am I to believe my ears?
Did this nation win a bloody civil war in order the king should dictate the terms of peace? l have already discussed the matter at great length with His Majesty--
You have discussed it? lt is a matter for this House to discuss.
MEN:
Hear, hear!
The king will not come to terms, sir, until the army stand down.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
And the army will not stand down until the king comes to terms.
So if the king will not talk to this House, then let the king talk to the army.
Out of the question.
The king would never agree.
Parliament is behind us, sir, and on this occasion, we have the majority.
Sir Thomas Fairfax.
MAN: He's bringing in the army!
SPEAKER: Order! Order!
Order, I say!
Order! Silence! Order!
Order!
Silence!
Order!
I believe, my Lord Manchester, that now I have the majority.
This is dictatorship. lt will mean a new civil war.
SPEAKER:
Order!
Honourable members, l swear before my God that you give me no alternative.
When those liberties for which this army and this nation have fought so hard are most solemnly guaranteed then this army will stand down.
And upon that, you have my most sacred promise.
[MEN CHATTERING]
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]
[BELLS RINGING IN DISTANCE]
[CHARLES LAUGHS]
And who have we here? lt is l, my lord.
You were supposed to have run, Sir Edward, not let me catch you. l'm afraid l'm getting a little too old for such games, my lord.
Cromwell is here to see you.
Oh.
You must play on your own now, children.
Your father has other games to play.
Prince Henry, you will be good enough to give me back my hat.
Sir.
Gentlemen,
His Majesty.
We came to present our terms, my lord.
If Your Majesty will be so kind as to study these proposals.
Has Parliament approved this treaty?
Parliament no longer truly represents the people of this nation, Sir Edward.
And you, Mr. Cromwell, do you truly represent the people of this nation?
I represent the army, sir, and the army is the heart and conscience of the people.
So having failed to come to terms with Parliament, you would now negotiate with the king. l am not bound to negotiate with anyone.
With 50,000 men under my command
I could impose a government on this nation overnight.
One is given to wondering,
Mr. Cromwell, why you do not do that.
I am deeply convinced, my lord, it be the duty of Parliament to frame a constitutional government, and not the army.
Then l do not see that you have any need of me at all.
On the contrary, sir.
An England without a king is unthinkable.
But withal, a king that can command respect a monarch who governs, not from fear, but by the affection of a free people.
Such a king could reunite this great nation of ours and make the name of England the noblest in all Christendom.
Should you adorn that inheritance, my lord, all Englishmen would be proud to call you king.
Mr. Cromwell, l do confess that l did greatly misjudge you, for l did mark you as an ambitious man.
To these ends, my lord,
I am ambitious.
Then you have my respect, sir.
Thank you, my lord.
We shall return in the morning, sir. l shall require a little longer to study this document.
Perhaps a week.
As Your Majesty pleases.
I sincerely hope that our future relations may be equally amiable, sir.
That is my hope also, my lord.
A cunning fellow. l believe him to be a sincere man, my lord.
Indeed.
If these proposals be acceptable, there never was a Crown so nearly lost, so easily recovered.
Whatever these proposals may be, Sir Edward, they are not acceptable to the king.
MAN: Cromwell has betrayed us!
CROWD: Aye!
We have given our blood and our lives in this war to put down this king! lf Cromwell comes to terms with him now, what price our freedom then?
Get back, will you?! l have served General
Cromwell faithfully all my life, and l reckoned him to be a man who feared God and did honour his word!
But in this business he has shown himself to be a man of no honour!
MEN:
Aye!
We fought this war to remove this king, not to put him back on the throne!
MEN: Aye! l say, let us march on London, let us take Parliament, and then let the king try to negotiate with us!
MAN:
Make way for Cromwell.
Traitors! Mutineers! l don't have to tell you, any of you, you could all be hanged for this.
We are not serfs, general, nor mercenaries.
We fought for the Lord in our cause, and now we have a right to speak.
You have no rights to preach revolt and mutiny.
As for you, John Carter, l did expect a greater degree of loyalty from you. l am still loyal to what l fought for, sir. Can the same be said of you? l have not betrayed my God, country, Parliament or my conscience.
Where was your conscience this day, when you parleyed with the king?
I tell you, all of you, l do most honestly believe that we have taught this king a lesson.
And he will prove most honourable.
Upon that I would stake my life.
Traitor! Traitor!
This is a military camp, sir, not a debating chamber.
Under military law, any man inciting mutiny can be hanged.
Colonel Harrison.
Yes, General.
These three men will draw lots. One of them will be hanged.
Captain Lancing, get a length of rope.
Yes, sir.
You, man.
Yes, sir.
Pick up some straws.
General, there is a Sir Edward Hyde to see you.
Sir Edward, has the king considered our terms?
The king, sir, has not even read your terms.
Nor, will l venture, has he any intention of so doing.
He has, this day, drawn up a secret treaty with
Manchester and Essex to raise a Scottish army against the Parliamentary forces.
He has already consented to a Catholic army from lreland.
While you negotiate a settlement with him, he is planning a second civil war. l do confess that l have these many years given my allegiance to a man not worthy of the title, king of England.
Colonel Harrison!
I will have this king's head..
Aye, and the Crown upon it.
This obstinate king, this man of blood, whose heart God has hardened, can no longer be trusted.
For in prodigious treason, he has revealed himself to be a traitor.
A man of no honour.
A man unfitted to bear the title, king of England.
MEN:
Hear, hear. l demand, therefore, in the name of the army and the people of this nation that Charles l, king of England, be brought hence to stand trial for his life on a charge of treason.
Oyez, oyez, oyez.
All manner of persons having anything to do with this court, come forward and give your attendance.
Every man to keep silence upon pain of imprisonment.
God save the king.
Let the prisoner be brought in.
[CHATTERING]
The clerk of arraigns will read the charges.
"Charles Stuart, king of England, you stand before this court charged with high treason. ln that being admitted king of England, and therein trusted with power to govern according to the laws, you did out of wickedness and design erect and uphold in yourself an unlimited and tyrannical power.
To rule at your will and overthrow the rights and liberties of the people.
And that you did traitorously and maliciously levy a cruel war against Parliament and the people.
And are therefore guilty of all the treasons, rapings, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages and mischiefs to the nation committed in the said war.
Thus, on behalf of the people of England, this court impeaches you as a tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy to the
Commonwealth of England."
God save the king!
JUDGE:
Silence!
Sir, you have heard the charges against you.
The court expects an answer.
First, l would know by what authority, l mean lawful authority, l am brought here and carried from place to place, and l know not what.
And by what authority you presume to sit in judgement on me.
Remember, l am your lawful king.
Think well upon it.
I have a trust committed to me by God, by old and lawful descent.
Therefore, let me know by what authority
I am brought here, and I shall answer.
It is not for the prisoner to question the court.
I am no ordinary prisoner, sir.
An answer, sir, the court demands an answer.
Then I refuse an answer.
Sir, you are before a court of justice.
Well, sir... l see that l am before a power.
[CHATTERING]
JUDGE:
The court will keep silent.
Mr. Solicitor General, are your witnesses prepared?
They are, my lord.
Then let them be brought forth.
Call Sir Edward Hyde.
And you saw the king and his wife alone in their chambers with this Catholic
Archbishop Rinuccini?
I did.
And what did you assume was the purpose of this meeting?
You are obliged to answer, Sir Edward.
To raise an Irish army, my lord.
To fight against the Parliamentary forces?
And at this time, was the king in communication with any other foreign power?
Yes. Yes, with the king of France and with the Dutch.
For the same purpose?
Yes.
To raise a foreign army to invade this country, and to perpetuate the war against the people of this kingdom.
Sir Edward?
Yes.
[CROWD YELLING]
To the block with him!
[GAVEL POUNDS]
Sir, throughout the three days of this hearing, this court has patiently awaited your pleasure to hear what you have to say in answer to the charges against you.
Yet you have declined to speak. l am most willing, sir, to answer before Parliament, but not before this assembly whose authority l refuse to acknowledge.
Sir, what answers you may offer the commons can be given here.
For this court does sit in the name of the House of Commons.
Sir, if, as you have said, you do love the liberty of the subject, you will grant me, your king, a hearing before Parliament, which is the lords and commons assembled.
Sir, l submit you seek only to delay the course of justice.
By your favour, sir, l seek only those rights which, as your king,
I would grant to any one of my subjects.
JUDGE:
Silence!
Sir, this court requires to know if you have anything to say before judgement is passed upon you.
I have nothing to say to you.
Then this court will retire to judgement.
What ails thee?
Art thou mad?
Have we come thus far that you would betray us now?
There is nothing in the Constitution of this land that entitles us to bring a king to trial. ls he not answerable to his subjects?
The trial is clearly illegal, and l will have-- ls not the king answerable to his subjects?
The king, sir, is answerable only to God.
Then, by God, when he dies, he shall have much to answer for.
We have gone too far in this matter.
This commission has no authority--
MAN 1 : Our authority lies with the Parliament, sir.
MAN 2:
Parliament is the law in this land. lf the charges against this king be not proven, what terrible retribution may he not bring down upon our heads?
In the name of God!
What are we all?
Men?
Cowering and quivering like downtrodden serfs.
The king is not England, and England is not the king! lt is not the survival of the king that is at issue here.
It is the survival of England.
And this king, by his dishonesties, by his treasons, and by his secret treaties with foreign powers, has shown himself to be ill-fitted to govern this great nation!
As God is my witness, Oliver,
I desire not the king's death, but the settlement of this nation in peace.
Do you think l don't desire that?
Go back to my farm and my family?
Very well. Go again to this king.
Offer him once more our terms.
Though God knows, he should be well acquainted with them by now.
Tell him he may sit upon his throne, but that this country will be governed by Parliament, and Parliament will be elected by the people.
Now, Sir Thomas, if you can achieve this where we have failed, this trial will end.
Here is a warrant demanding the death of the king upon the charge of high treason against this nation. lt will require all your signatures. Sir Thomas.
I have come thus far with you,
Oliver, in our great cause... but I will not sign this warrant.
Oliver, l cannot. ls he guilty or not guilty?
He is the king. ls he guilty?
Yes.
Sign it.
Charles Stuart, king of England... you have been found guilty of high treason against the good people of this nation represented in Parliament, by whose authority this court does sit in judgement upon you.
Upon this charge, it is the sentence of this court that you be taken hence to an... appointed place and put to death by the severing of the head from the body.
And that is the sentence of the whole court.
[CROWD YELLING]
Remove the prisoner.
MAN: Silence.
Will you hear me a word, sir?
No, sir, you are not to be heard after sentence.
By your favour, sir. l know as much law as any man here. l have the right to be heard.
No, sir. Guard!
Remove your prisoner!
I demand to be heard!
I am your lawful king!
MAN:
Blood for the traitor!
General.
Sir Thomas.
I have been this past night to the commissioners.
They have instructed me to lay before you this warrant for 40,000 pounds in return for the king's life.
How little you know me that you think you can buy my principles.
You insult me with that cheap bribe.
Will you not think on it? l have thought on it. And well.
By my God, l have thought on it.
PRIEST: ''Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall.
And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.
And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head.
And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying, 'Hail, king of the Jews!'
And they spit--''
Your Majesty. ls it time?
No, Your Majesty.
Her Royal Highness, the Princess Elizabeth, and his Royal Highness,
Prince Henry.
Elizabeth, sweetheart.
Don't grieve for me.
Henry.
Now, both of you... mark what I say.
They will cut off thy father's head.
Shh, there now.
Henry, pay careful attention to what l say.
You must not let them make you king, not while your brother
Charles is still alive.
I would be torn to pieces first.
That's my son.
Today, your brother will be king.
Elizabeth, now.
It's a glorious death to which I go.
Tell your mother... that my love for her was the same to the last.
And remember me in your prayers.
The king's escort, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
God bless you both.
What kind of morning is it, colonel?
Indeed it is somewhat chilly, Your Majesty.
Then l was wise to put on a second shirt.
For if l trembled with the cold, my enemies would say it was from fear.
I would not expose myself to such a reproach.
Please keep them.
Oh, Your Majesty.
I do not fear death,
Sir Thomas. lt is not at all terrible to me. l thank my God l have prepared for it.
Are we to ride to
Westminster, or walk?
My orders are that we walk, Your Majesty.
Admirable. The morning air will do me good.
[BELL RlNGlNG]
[HORSE NElGHlNG]
MAN:
The king's coming.
He's coming now. The king's coming!
Hey, you. Stop him!
Gentlemen, the king comes.
MAN 1 : Traitor!
MAN 2: Execute him!
MAN 3: Execute him!
And a true, urgent sword in our hand.
God bless, Your Majesty.
God bless you.
Escort, halt!
[CROWD CHATTERING]
[CHATTERING STOPS]
Well, gentlemen, are you afraid to kill your king with an open face? l will not delay you long, but will say only this to you:
As God is my witness, l have forgiven those that have brought me here and pray that my death be not laid to their charge.
For I do endeavour, even to the last, to maintain the peace of my kingdom.
I go now from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown.
To everlasting peace.
Will that suffice?
Permit me, sir, that l may pray a while before the blow is struck.
Then when I put out my hands so:
That will be the sign.
Lord, let us now, thy servant, depart in peace according to thy word.
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people.
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost.
As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be.
Behold the head of a traitor!
[PEOPLE YELLING]
We did not assassinate.
Nor was this thing done in a corner, it was done in the face of God and of all men.
The office of king is now abolished.
Long live Parliament.
Long live the Republic.
MEN: Aye, long live the Republic.
Richard, l want to go back to Cambridge.
Will you come with me, son? lf you wish, Father. lt will be peace and quiet there now.
God knows, my soul craves a little peace.
You must not think on it, Oliver.
'Tis over now.
The war, everything.
'Tis over and done.
Oliver, you're home now.
There's nothing more to think on.
Save that we two may grow old together in peace.
Peace.
Father.
Henry lreton is at the house with some men from Parliament.
I'll be along shortly.
Tom.
Arthur.
Henry.
Well, you all seem solemn enough. lt is a solemn business that brings us here, Oliver.
Well, speak of it.
The country needs a head of state, Oliver. lt must be governed. ls it not governed by Parliament?
There must be a figurehead. lt is our tradition.
The country needs a king, Oliver.
God knows, you've said so many times yourself.
The country will be ruled by Parliament.
Now, in the name of Christ, how often must I say that?
And who will control Parliament?
The people, the people, the people! lt's not practical. lt won't work. lt will work and it must work.
We are here, on behalf of Parliament, to offer you the Crown.
To offer...
Me, king of England?
King Oliver I of England.
Elizabeth, tell me, do you see before you a king?
This tired, sickening man, this country oaf, crude in speech and manner?
This rough fellow, does he display the bearing of a king?
You are the one man who can govern this country.
In the name of God, did we cut the head off this king only to steal his Crown?
This hollow golden ring, this worthless trinket.
Give it to a whore for the price of her bed!
If you would find a head to fit it, let it adorn some court jester or some strolling player that he may play your king, but not l.
Power must be absolute, or it be no power at all. lt was not for power that we did this thing. Have you not understood that yet?
Now, Ireton, mark me, and mark me well.
That you be hard-set upon ambitious courses has not escaped me, and if you seek to use me towards such ends, though l love you like a brother, l swear, l will destroy you.
Every freeborn Englishman, be he the lowest of the lowest, is entitled to a voice in the governing of this country.
But there is no vote for the poor, for the underprivileged, no vote for all those who took up arms to put down the very autocracy that this Parliament now imposes upon us.
You did not vote this Parliament into office.
This gaggle of buffoons, these villains!
Much has been said in this House about the so-called inequity of certain members being financially involved in national projects.
Members have ascribed to this state of affairs dark and sinister motives.
I say if we in Parliament cannot gain from ruling the country, there's really very little point in our being here at all.
MAN: No member of this
House should be permitted to profit from his office.
MEN:
Hear! Hear!
MAN: lf this House knew its duty to the nation, it would terminate its sitting and let a new Parliament be elected.
SPEAKER: Order!
Gentlemen, l move that this House be given power to remain in office a further three years without re-election.
[CHEERING]
In my opinion, a committee of inquiry should be set up to investigate the financial involvement of certain members.
SPEAKER:
Order!
Mr. Speaker. May I have your permission to address this assembly?
By all means, sir.
My lords, honourable members, l have always desired, above my life, a free Parliament sitting by the authority of the good people of this nation.
A Parliament open and visible, to be seen by all men. lt is six years since l handed over to you this great responsibility in the hope that you would make good and wholesome laws which the people of this nation expected of you.
I must confess to some abatement of my hopes for what has happened in my absence.
Instead of uniting the good people of this nation with righteousness and peace, which would have been a glorious and Christian thing to have done, what do I find?
Anarchy, corruption, division and dissatisfaction.
I say that the enemies of this nation have flourished under your protection.
You were from the beginning a provisional government not truly representative of the people.
For have the people elected you?
Has this House gone once to the people it purports to represent?
No, it has not! And after six years of misgovernment, what do we find?
Sir Thomas Fairfax moves a bill to give this House a further lease of its worthless and dishonourable life!
Gentlemen, an immovable
Parliament is more obnoxious than an immovable king!
You are drunkards, tricksters, villains, whoremasters, godless, self-seeking, ambitious tricksters.
You are no more capable of conducting the affairs of this nation than you are of running a brothel!
[MEN YELL]
You are scum, sir, and not truly elected scum at that.
This is no Parliament.
I shall put an end to your sitting. l hereby declare this
Parliament dissolved!
Colonel Harrison!
Yes, sir. Troops forward!
Rubbish.
Remove them!
Come on, get them out.
This is dictatorship, sir! Dictatorship!
Dictator!
Dictatorship!
MAN: This is illegal!
Come, sir. l refuse to quit this chair.
By your leave, sir.
Away with this bauble!
I seem to recall that we cut off a king's head for such as this.
You are a traitor, sir. lt is the likes of you who have turned my hand to this. l have sought the Lord's guidance night and day in this matter. lt is not idly done, for this nation will be justly governed.
I will give this nation back its self-respect.
We will walk in this world with our heads held high. l will liberate man's souls from the darkness of ignorance. l will build schools and universities for all.
This will become the golden age of learning. l will bring the law within the reach of every common man.
There'll be work and bread for all.
This nation will prosper because it is a godly nation and because we walk hand in hand with the Lord.
I swear by the name of the living God that I will see this nation properly governed if I have to do it myself.
Dear God, give me the strength to do it... alone.
NARRATOR: Oliver Cromwell ruled the nation as lord protector for five years.
In that short time, he raised England to be a great power,
feared and respected throughout the world.
Under his hand were laid the foundations
of a truly democratic nation.
In 1658, he died.
Three years later, Charles, prince of Wales, was crowned king
and a monarch sat once more upon the throne of England.
But an England never to be the same again.

Hey, anybody in?
Quiet!
Come here!
I beg your pardon!
Which way to Lubicz and Wodokty?
Turn right by the cross for Lubicz, straight ahead for Wodokty.
Thanks!
You go on to Lubicz!
Good bye!
Hey, where's your mistress?
Here I am.
I'm Andrzej Kmicic.
The wind blew me here straight from camp to pay my respects.
A lucky wind, I hope.
You knew of Grandpapa's death?
I've already mourned my benefactor.
He's bequeathed
Lubicz and you to me.
Don't avert your face,
I can't see my legacy.
Oh, what a lovely one!
A hundred masses for my benefactor's soul?
When shall we be wed?
Stay, it's too early,
I'm not yet yours.
But you will be, or I'll burn down this house!
You're mine by the will of the dead and your heart.
I don't know yet about my heart
If you won't be mine
I'll stab myself!
You say that in jest, sir!
Come, my aunt will have supper sewed.
Whose aunt?
Mine.
Then she's my aunt too!
Kulwiecéwna.
I'd have come earlier, but war is a matchmaker only with death.
You weren't in a hurry.
The ensigns were already back.
I stayed to stalk the foe.
I harassed them so much, there's a price on my head.
This goose is delicious.
In the name of the
Father and of the Son...
The enemy's locked himself in the cities, the winter's so severe.
My men are worn out, like brooms from constant sweeping, so the Hetman assigned us to winter quarters.
I've sent my officers to Lubicz.
They'll come here tomorrow, to pay their respects to you.
Drink some wine, sir, please.
I'd drink poison if it was from your hands.
Your health!
The more I look at you, the more I want to marry.
When shall we be wed?
It's untimely to speak of it while in mourning.
Then I'll wither before the time is up.
Deuce take it!
Grandpapa always said you were a hothead.
You must get accustomed to it.
And you must change your habits, it cannot be like this!
Oh, so you're going to lead me by the nose.
You don't look like a man who is easily led.
They broke a lot of rods in the monastery teaching me wise maxims.
Which one do you remember best?
When in love, fall at her feet.
Let me go or I'll be angry and call my aunt.
A regiment of aunts can't stop me when I'm eager.
Traitor! Judas!
I'm not, because my kiss is sincere.
Shall I convince you?
Don't you dare!
Where I'm from they say: ask, and if it is not given, take it!
I must leave now.
It's late.
You've a long way to
Lubicz, and wolves aplenty.
I'll come with my companions on a visit tomorrow.
Goodnight...
Oh, auntie!
Here's health to my lady!
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!
Well, what is she like?
Very pretty?
Damn it! There's no other like her!
You're lucky to have someone to snuggle up to.
When's the wedding?
When the mourning's over.
Damn the mourning!
Children aren't born black but...
...white!
Here's to grandpapa Billewicz, who left you Lubicz!
Stupid! Drinking the health of the dead?
We'll sleep on straw, only don't turn us out!
Stop it.
Whatever is mine, is yours!
He won't abandon us!
Drink up!
He slashed at me like this, and I like this!
One, two, three!
You can't match Kmicic anyway!
Nobody can!
Slice them off!
No one can match him! Just try!
You can't beat me at shooting!
One ducat a shot!
Two! Between the horns!
Three! Five! Pistols!
Loaded?
Straight into the skull!
Between the horns!
He missed!
Eight in the middle! Bravo!
Fight! Die! Slay!
Wenches! Wenches!
This mustn't go any further, my reputation is at stake.
I already told girls and households not tell anybody.
Do you love me?
Like my own soul.
Colonel, sir! Stop!
He's one of my soldiers, something has happened.
What is it, Soroka?
The town is on fire, they're fighting.
Holy mother!
Don't worry.
Who's fighting?
Villagers didn't want to give fodder.
Soldiers took it.
They began firing.
Making a terrible row, bells are tolling.
We must go to their aid!
Burn the town! To arms!
Silence!
A horse!
I don't need you!
I don't want a shambles!
Back to Lubicz and wait for me.
But... Sir...
Not a word.
Farewell! Regards.
We can't have our sleigh ride.
Don't worry.
Let's drink some booze, it's cold!
They're from Lubicz.
Yes, Kmicic's companions.
Let's have another.
It smells of mead.
We don't want booze, give us mead!
There are wenches sitting by the fire.
What are you doing, damsels?
Warming our feet.
Warming their feet!!
I know a better way of warming feet.
Dance and the cold will go away!
We don't need violins,
I'll play on my battle hammer.
Go away!
Perhaps you'd dance with me?
Who are you?
Are you looking for trouble?
No use talking, away with you!
Get out!
I am my own master when I'm sitting over a pitch of mead.
I don't care for gold
I will gladly drink instead.
I was worried.
My sweet maid!
I was afraid there might be a battle.
A few villagers silenced by soldiers, that's all.
What do you mean "silenced"?
One sword stroke on the head is enough.
But that's murder!
The burghers sent for help.
A few lads and officers came.
I chased them off... and drove the officers naked in the snow.
Shame on you!
Are you sincere or just pretending?
You'll be brought to trial.
Don't you worry about that.
Everybody is his own master in this country.
If he has a sword and a few men.
Who am I to fear?
I won't marry a man with blood and tears on his conscience.
Don't drive me mad!
What do you want from me?
Just be decent.
Be well.
Farewell.
For God's sake!
Do you want me to drop dead from my horse?
Don't cry!
For God's sake, don't cry, my dearest!
I'll send them away,
I'll make up for everything.
I'll lead a different life.
I'll change.
Anybody in there?
Have they drunk themselves silly?
Rekué, it's me.
Bring me a priest.
Who slaughtered you?
Who did it?
The Butryms.
Come here!
Olenka, wake up!
Wolmontowicze is on fire!
What a disaster!
Wolmontowicze is on fire!
Can you hear me?
Oh, God!
He did it.
Holy Patriarchs,
Pray for him.
From evil death.
Save him, oh Lord.
From all evil...
Open the door!
My horse fell in the forest.
They're after me.
You burnt Wolmontowicze.
Yes, yes, I did!
The Devil coming for my soul, eh?
All right.
What's going on?
What do you want?
Kmicic has burnt Wolmontowicze.
Murdered men, women and children.
We killed his people and now we want his head!
Follow him, why do you stand here?
Isn't he here?
We found his horse.
No, the house was locked up.
Search the stables.
He's escaped to the woods!
Follow him!
Stop!
Don't hide him, miss, he's accursed.
I curse him just as you do.
Amen.
Come out, sir!
Take a horse and go!
You've blood on your hands like Cain.
Go and stay away forever!
One seldom meets such worthy people as you.
I couldn't feel better in the Prince's castle.
We thank you, sir, that you decided to stay here.
Though you'd have had the best care at the Hetman's court.
I'm all right now, my arm is fit to wield the sword.
Colonel, sir,
Kmicic has abducted the young lady.
I wonder he dared to come here.
Must be very sure of himself.
After me!
Hide behind the carriages!
To the house!
Break down the door with axes.
Stop! Stop it, hell! We'll talk.
Who's that?
Andrzej Kmicic. Who is there?
Colonel Wolodyjowski.
No time for greetings.
You ruffian, you must account for the innocent blood you've shed and this abduction.
You wouldn't call me a ruffian at an open door.
Then open it.
Listen carefully.
I have a keg of powder here.
Leave me alone or I'll blow up the house and everybody in it.
He's mad and ready to do it.
Come out and fight with me.
If you win, you'll go free.
A nobleman's word?
No! Don't do it!
Silence, damn it!
If I don't, he'll blow us all up.
Well, do the poor gentry agree?
They'll swear by their swords if you like.
Let them swear.
Assemble here, gentlemen.
All those present are my witnesses that I've challenged Mr Kmicic to a duel, and I've promised he'll go free if he wins, without any hindrance on your part.
Swear it!
I swear to God Almighty and on the Holy Cross. Amen.
Come out!
I trust your word.
Which one is Mr Wolodyjowski?
I am.
Well, you're not a giant.
Where do we fight?
Here.
All right.
I feel sorry for you,
I've heard you're a great soldier.
So I say for the last time: leave me alone.
Come on!
You asked for it.
Shall we wait until the rain stops?
It's all the same to me.
It's unpleasant to die in such heavy rain.
A Colonel will be buried, so the sky weeps.
Come on, sir!
You use your sword like a flail.
Pick it up!
Finish it, spare the shame.
He's alive, he didn't fall on his back.
Go away!
Now he's mine, not yours.
No butchering. We're knights.
One doesn't finish off a wounded man.
Dress his wound.
Young lady, you're free.
I'm Colonel Wolodyjowski.
Is he dead?
Do not fear, young lady.
Kmicic is unconscious.
Without boasting, I'm the one who did it.
By God, answer me, is he dead?
Kmicic?
Just wounded.
Thank you sir.
I've come to ask if you bear me a grudge.
Thank you for coming, sir.
I bear no grudge,
I was defeated by a fine man.
So you are the famous Misha': Wolodyjowski?
Strictly speaking, I'm Jerzy Michai, but Saint George only fought a dragon and as Saint Michael is the war lord in heaven,
I prefer to have him as my patron saint.
George is certainly no equal to Michael.
How's your health, sir?
It was a near thing.
Where did you learn to fight like that?
At war.
I'm threatened with lawsuits here.
I burnt down Wolmontowicze, that's true.
And hacked up some people.
But my companions were slaughtered too, like oxen.
And why?
Just because they wanted to dance with some damsels?
Poor souls.
As for abducting the girl, it's true she saved my life, but threw me out afterwards, so what could I do?
Well, I'll tell you, sir.
She loves you.
How do you know she loves me?
I saw her looking at you when you lay wounded.
She loves you.
If you don't understand, it's because you had your head split open.
If it was true!
I didn't say she'd marry you.
It is wartime now.
You can render great services to your country.
Win fame for courage and patch up your reputation.
Is there still time for me to do it?
I have to go to court straight from bed.
There's a remedy for that.
The Lord Hetman's writ.
You are to enlist soldiers and form a regiment.
You'll serve our country and be forgiven.
The Hetman left it to me... to give you this writ...
...or not.
What are you going to do?
And I am giving you this writ.
I'm happy to see you sir.
I'd go through
I'd go through fire for you.
Don't say that, please.
This is Andrzej Kmicic.
Why have we been called here?
We'll probably take the field.
My Lord Hetman invites you to come in, gentlemen!
My Lord Hetman invites you to come in, gentlemen!
Forgive me for keeping you waiting.
But there are so many things to do now.
I summoned you to announce unpleasant news.
Apart from the old war we have a new one.
The Swedes have broken the truce.
A beautiful country and valiant people.
But struggles between magnates, averse to the king.
What is the news from the Polish camp?
The gentry are assembling sluggishly.
Perhaps we'd better wait till King Karol Gustav arrives with the whole army.
I'd advise that if this country had a regular army.
But there's none,
I know this country well, the King is weak and lacks money.
Our forces are more than enough against their gentry.
So I may presume that this is already our land.
You may, Your Grace, you may.
What do people say?
The Colonels wonder why they were summoned without their regiments.
Are there many of the gentry?
All the important families.
Call Kmicic.
Did you come with your regiment?
As you said, sir.
Are they reliable people?
They'd go through fire and hell.
I need such men.
And men like you.
Ready for anything.
Such hard times may come that even the most loyal will waver.
May he who deserts Your Grace in the hour of danger perish.
Olenka Billewicz is here.
I sent for her, to reconcile you two.
How can I repay Your Grace for this?
How can I repay for this?
Have faith in me.
Trust me, and believe that whatever I do, is for the public good.
Don't desert me when others do.
I swear.
Swear by this crucifix that you'll not desert me till you die.
Swear by Christ's Passion.
By Christ's Passion
I swear it.
Welcome, gentlemen, brothers!
It's good that you've come.
We need great strength to save our country, and to assist me in my endeavours to do so.
I drink your health.
To the Colonels!
Suprema lex
- love of our country.
Long live the Lord Hetmam!
Defensor Patriae!
Lead us against the Swedes!
When I lay abed, close to death,
I told myself:
I won't take her by force, by sword and fire, but win her by good deeds.
I'll restore my good name at war, and be reconciled with all.
Won't you say just one kind word?
Can I believe you?
You must.
You should.
My Lord Hetman and Mr Wolodyjowski did.
Why would you alone not believe?
I've seen tears shed because of you.
Graves not yet covered by grass.
Grass will cover them.
And I'll wipe away the tears myself.
Do all that first.
Give me some hope at least.
Many among You will be surprised or even horrified by this toast.
But whoever believes and trusts me, and has the good of the country at heart, whoever is a loyal friend of the house of Radziwill, will drink it willingly and repeat after me:
Long live Carolus Gustavus,
King of Sweden!
From this day graciously reigning over us!
Vivat, vivat!
My God!
What have I done!
Your Grace, in Christ's name!
Have mercy on yourself!
Have mercy on us!
Have mercy on Poland!
Don't do it!
Don't implore him, he's a traitor!
May you die in despair!
May your lineage extinct!
May the devil take your soul, traitor!
Traitor!
Thrice traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Kmicic, come here!
Shame on those who follow the Hetman.
Make your choice!
Jesus!
You swore by the Cross you wouldn't desert me.
I'll be damned if I keep this oath, and damned if I don't.
For Christ's sake!
Do you think that I've accepted
Karol Gustav as king forever?
That I want to unite this land with Sweden?
I want to save our country.
And all means to this end are good.
I need power.
But not out of pride.
Let he who is strong enough take it.
But if there's no such man
I'll take it.
What do you want, My Lord?
I want the crown.
Jesus and Mary!
I've surrendered this country to the Swedes to vanquish other foes with their arms.
But rocky Sweden has not enough men, not enough swords to keep the whole of Poland.
So what will they do?
Whom will they give it to?
I'll take the crown.
And when I've rebuilt this crumbling edifice, and made it more powerful,
I'll trample our foes with this foot.
So help me God and he Holy Cross.
Your Grace!
My mind can't grasp it.
My head is bursting!
What's going on there?
Perhaps help is coming?
Lift me up.
Give us back our Colonels!
It's Oskierko's infantry.
MY men!
I knew they'd claim us.
Tell them to send for your regiment!
Be quiet!
What's that?
The Scottish Regiment.
They're against us.
Our people are attacking.
Kmicic with his riders...
On whose side?
I don't know I couldn't see.
Did he throw down his mace yesterday?
I couldn't see.
To think I had this man at my mercy.
And let him live.
Wolodyjowski saved
Your Grace's life.
It was his duty.
But I'll have him shot as a rebel.
You won't do it.
I implore you, My Lord.
Spare him and the others.
Don't refuse me this favour.
And if I refuse?
Then have me shot too.
Remember who you're speaking to, wretched man!
Don't drive me to despair.
I could have listened to a supplication.
But I won't listen to threats.
Let me serve you with all my heart, not under compulsion.
Otherwise I'll go crazy.
I wrote their death sentence in my mind yesterday.
What the Hetman has written, the future Polish King can cancel.
You've got a persuasive way,
I can't refuse you anything.
Till the end of the war
I'll put them under Swedish guard.
Thank you, My Lord, my father.
Your regiment's somewhere near, isn't it?
We could try to escape.
How can we escape?
Who's that officer commanding the convoy?
Roch Kowalski,
Roch Korab Kowalski.
Tom might as well talk to his horse.
He's just as stupid.
And he's an officer?
The Prince liked him.
He breaks horseshoes in his hands.
And he'll carry out any order no matter what.
I like him very much.
I always prefer to know who I'm dealing with.
Mr Kowalski!
Come closer please.
What do you want?
Have you any liquor?
I have.
Give us some.
Why should I?
If it was forbidden, you'd have explicit orders.
But you haven't, so give me some.
You can't force me to.
No, but you're allowed to.
It's decent to help an old kinsman, who, if he'd had married your mother, would have been your father.
Fine kind of kinsman you are!
By my grandmother, she was born Kowalska.
And her crest was Korab.
By God, then you're really my kinsman!
Call me uncle.
How is your father?
By God, I've forgotten his first name!
It's Roch, too.
That's right,
Roch begat Roch.
Such is the comnandment.
Are you married?
I certainly am.
I'm Kowalski and this is my Miss.
I don't want any other.
I don't want any other.
A pity you won't have young Rochs with her.
I see you're a clever cavalier.
Well, let's drink some more.
Drain it dry.
It seems Mr Zagloba wore himself out talking to this stupid lout.
Is he his relative?
Like I'm yours.
Mister Kowalski, your uncle has arrived.
I am Kowalski and this is my Missus.
Where's my sword?
Jesus Christ!
I don't want to boast, but I did it.
I sent the most stupid officer so that they wouldn't get him over to their side, and he betrayed me.
Your Grace shouldn't have sent a Pole.
And make the Swedes think there are no
Poles at my side?
Where's Kmicic?
He went to fetch Miss Billewicz.
Set the regiments ready.
I'll lead them myself!
I have an invitation from the Prince.
I'm glad to see you in good health.
When I arrived,
I saw Olenka, but she disappeared at once.
It's no small honour for us.
But we cannot go immediately.
You cannot dawdle when the Prince waits.
So it's compulsion.
We are supposed to go to Kiejdany.
What for?
The Prince has asked us.
I told you we should flee as they won't leave us alone.
Tie us up, we won't go otherwise.
God will judge who is right, Olenka.
If I, serving the Hetman, or you calling me a traitor.
But you will go to Kiejdany.
No, we won't.
Our servants will defend us.
Here are my men coming.
You must be in the coach in a moment.
Let's go!
Where to, cavalier?
Wolodyjowski!
At your service.
The biter is bitten.
You've bad luck with me.
I stand in your way for the second time.
You were a swashbuckler then but now no honest man would duel with you.
Why is that?
Because you're a traitor.
And you've slaughtered soldiers who wanted to defend our country.
Your last hour has come.
By what right do you judge me?
Pray now, and if you have something in your defence, say it quick.
Because I doubt if this lady will intercede for you now.
I don't ask her favour.
Take him behind the barn and shoot him!
Don't let them maul me like a dog.
I'll go myself.
I'll see if he has any orders on him.
Like Roch had.
Hurry, or they'll be blood stained.
I ordered them to take him far away so the shots don't scare her.
You'll draw vengeance on our heads.
You must escape, come with us.
Right.
Oh God!
You could at least cross yourself.
None of your business, knave.
Get on with it!
You could have taken the wretch with you, to do away with him somewhere else.
How can we go, she's scarcely breathing?
It's done.
We'll put her into the coach, you must flee!
Radziwill's vengeance will spare nobody.
I've stopped the execution!
You did? Why?
Why?
Let me get my breath.
If it wasn't for that worthy man, Kmicic, we'd all be hanging now on trees in Kiejdany.
We wanted to kill our benefactor.
How can this be?
Read this and you'll have the answer.
"We, Prince Janusz Radziwill,
Great Hetman..."
And then...
I'll read it.
"On the intercession of Andrzej Kmicic"...
"we pardon Colonel Wolodyjowski and the waif with him"...
He means me.
"And the other Colonels sentenced to death for mutiny"
"and order them to be confined in the Birze prison".
"On the intercession of Andrzej Kmicic..."
If you're going to have him shot now, then, by God,
I'm parting company with you, and don't want to see you again.
What kind of desperado are you not to have shown it?
You're free, go wherever you want.
Think twice, I warn you, I'm going back to Radziwill.
Stay with us, you'll be our good companion.
The Motherland will forgive you.
No.
God will judge who best serves the Motherland!
You, by unleashing civil war, or I by serving the only man who can save this country.
To whom did you give your oath:
Radziwill, the King?
The Swedes or Poland?
You're out of your mind.
I knew I couldn't convert you.
Farewell.
Wait!
It's very important.
Tell us.
Did Radziwill promise you we'd stay alive?
Yes, you were to be kept in prison.
Then know your Radziwill, who betrays not only his country but his servitors too.
"After dismissing the convoy shoot all of these men..."
"but so that the news doesn't spread".
What's this?
The Hetman's letter to the Swedes.
I found it on Roch Kowalski.
I wish I'd perished at your hands.
Make haste, a sword hangs over our heads here.
With that man left alive, they won't murder us at once.
Hurry!
We'll be ready by the dawn.
God grant that we meet in better times.
Farewell.
Please remember a soldier who wishes you well.
Accept, sweet flower, an old man's farewell too.
Where's Kmicic?
He's back, alone.
Call him!
I came too late, they escaped.
I wanted to follow them, there's a rumour that all the Polish regiments have mutinied.
The only profit:
I've brought the girl here.
And you were saved by my letter!
Which letter, Your Grace?
The one written to me or to the Swedes?
So you know?
Yes.
Be gone.
How could you do such a thing to me?
Silent!
I won't be silent!
I was made to feel ashamed of Your Grace.
I ordered the Swedes to shoot them to spare you pain.
Look what you've done.
They're at the head of the rebellion.
Your sentiments and my weakness for you have harmed the country.
Perhaps.
But each day will be greater torture.
You're in despair because of that girl.
When will you marry her?
There'll be some fuss but next morning she'll dry her tears.
She doesn't want me,
I don't want her.
I won't beg her.
I'd like to go away, to forget.
It's up to you.
You want to leave?
Today if possible.
I'll send you to my brother,
Prince Boguslav,
I'm not strong enough to attack the rebels by myself.
Then you'll carry my letters to King Karolus himself.
Ask him to send me some cavalry and cannons.
I'll crush the rebels.
Have you an)' request?
My Grace...
Speak up, don't hesitate.
I ask Your Grace to protect her from harm here.
Be sure of that.
I'm going far away,
I don't know if I'll see you again.
I wanted to leave without a word but
I couldn't.
Let us not part in anger and rancour.
God be with you.
I have no grudge against you.
An evil spirit has come between us.
Dividing us as though by a sea.
May God guide you.
And show you the right way.
May you leave the one you've strayed to.
Don't speak of it, or we'll quarrel again.
Give me your hand.
Olenka!
Shan't we see each other anymore?
Andrzej!
Leave the traitors and all will be well.
I can't.
You better not say any more.
God, do we deserve this?
Farewell - for the last time.
Why are you crying?
Don't, or I'll go crazy!
Are you the Lord
Hetman's courtier?
My name is Kmicic and I'm not a courtier, only a Colonel.
The famous Kmicic of the last war?
I've heard a lot about you.
This is a letter from My Lord Hetman.
Sit down, cavalier,
Nothing new.
He advises me to move to Taurogi.
Which, as you see, I'm doing.
Here I'd have to declare myself with the Swedes or against them.
And it's too early for that.
The Lord Hetman is always late with his advice.
"Think of the Confederates who mutinied against me".
"They'll plunder my estates, and the beer is strong there".
"Put them to the sword when they're drunk."
Listen, Mr Kmicic.
Pretend to be the
Polish King's follower and a patriot, and murder those who won't betray the King.
Is there any sense in it?
Your Grace!
I serve the Radziwills with heart and soul.
With your fortune mine also may grow.
But I can't grasp and comprehend everything.
What do you want then?
My Lord Hetman all his deeds as being for the good of the country.
Is it only for appearances or the truth?
And if I told you it's for appearances, would you refuse to serve us?
My fortune can grow with that of the Radziwills.
You'll get somewhere.
You see if we, the Radziwills, were living in Spain,
France or even Sweden, where a son succeeds to the throne, we'd probably serve the King and Country and settle for high offices.
But in this country where the gentry elect the King?
Who can guarantee that some day they won't choose to elect a Mr Nobody from Nowhere?
This country is going to hell,
The crown go to the Lord Hetman.
And come to me after him.
More!
More!
Stop!
Saddle the horses!
They're saddled.
Strap the saddlebags!
They're strapped.
A ducat per head!
Thank you Colonel, sir!
Soroka!
You'll take two men and the packhorses.
Take the road to the woods.
Out of town at gallop!
Yes Sir!
The others load your guns.
Saddle two horses for me!
Go!
Stop!
Are you ready to die?
If you're risking your head, sir,
Why shouldn't we?
I'll reward you just as well as the Lord Hetman.
May I ask for a reward in advance?
I have a thoroughbred horse and
I don't want to wear him out.
Would you deign to use it till I return?
Then you'd better sell him to me.
I can't, it'd be like selling a friend.
He's saved me from trouble a hundred times.
And has the added virtue that he bites the enemy in battle.
Where is this wonder?
In the paddock.
A deer's legs, a wolf's step, an elk's nostrils.
And a woman's breast.
Well broken in.
When you're advancing in a row, you can drop the reins, he won't pull ahead one inch.
He keeps in line and the rider's hands are free.
At times one hand was holding a pistol while the other - a sword.
And if the line turns about?
He'll turn about too.
No horse can do that.
Please try, Your Grace.
Two men at your sides with me behind.
I'll give him to you free if he pulls ahead.
All right!
Drop the reins, Your Grace!
Take him!
What's this?
Scoundrels!
Don't you know who I am?
Don't resist or you'll get a bullet.
Traitor!
What about you?
Against whom do you raise your hand?
Easy, you'll wrench my arms!
Let him go.
Where are you taking me?
To the Confederates.
I have your letters, your villainies will be exposed.
Because I believed in the Radziwills!
What's that?
The horses are dead tired.
It won't be a plentiful place to rest in.
I have some food and vodka.
We must gather strength.
Your Grace will kindly dismount.
Why?
I'll eat and drink in the saddle.
Down on the ground, please.
And you into the ground!
Must be the devil.
I smell smoke.
Stupid!
If it was the devil, you'd smell sulphur, not smoke.
Hey!
Anyone there?
Be on your guard!
Carry the Colonel in.
Soroka...
Yes, Sir?
It was the Prince who shot at me, wasn't it?
What happened to him?
He escaped.
That's bad, that's very bad.
He killed three of our men and had the best horse.
So he won.
But we'll meet again.
Soroka!
At your service...
You up already, sir'?
You were sleeping like horses.
One could hack your heads off.
Soroka, we're going to Wolodyjowski.
They'll kill us, Colonel, sir.
I prefer that to being considered a traitor by them.
Show yourself!
What do you want?
Come here!
Don't yell from behind the bushes.
Can two of us advance?
Yes.
A miracle, sir, but I think they're our men.
Where's your second son, Mr Kiemlicz?
Not killed, I hope?
Good God!
Father!
It's Mr Kmicic!
Sweet Jesus!
It's Mr Kmicic!
Come over here!
Well, rascals, do you greet me with guns?
Such a guest!
On your knees, scoundrels!
On your knees!
Who was the first to shoot?
You shot yourself!
He's lying dog! My Lord, such a guest!
I can't believe my eyes.
Kindly come in, please.
What are you waiting for, blackheads?
Bring some mead!
How do you come to be here?
When the Butryms defeated you in Wolmontowicze, we took to the woods.
Misery and hunger.
We live on mushrooms and blueberries.
The cellar is uncovered.
Give us the key, Father.
You'll drink more than you bring!
I'll fetch it myself.
What are you doing now?
We capture horses.
From whom?
From anybody.
From Swedes too?
Surely.
And if they resist?
We thrash them.
You thrash them?
That's good.
You can take horses from the enemy.
But if you take them from your own people, then you're rogues, not nobility.
What do you do with the horses?
Father sells them.
Go cover the cellar!
Mead isn't good for a wound.
Shall I dress it?
That's right, you were my surgeon.
Jesus.
Somebody must have shot you at close quarters, sir.
Kiemlicz! You'll come back under my command
How far are the troops who have mutinied against the Lord Hetman?
3 days by road.
Quicker through the woods.
Kiemlicz!
You'll come back under my command with your sons.
It'll pay off better than horse stealing.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's just hunger and misery.
Only don't try to betray me, you won't succeed.
That we'll never do.
Do you have something to write with?
I'll see.
I must send a letter, but through a reliable man.
We'll find one.
Where is he to go?
To the Lord Hetman but he doesn't need to see him.
It's enough if he delivers it to the first officer he meets.
I have three sheets.
But no ink and no pen.
The pen is here, and ink can be found.
Passable, it's easier to cut heads than pens.
Go away now, Mr Kiemlicz.
By God, it's true, he has our letters!
And there are things in them, that...
But Kmicic can't make these letters public, in doing so he'd pass a death sentence upon his girl.
He realizes it's the only way to keep us in check.
What girl is it?
Olenka Billewicz.
I don't ask her name, only if she's comely.
You don't know her.
Virtue personified, almost a nun.
I've known nuns too.
A defender of the Polish King.
Then we'll multiply his defenders.
Then Kmicic will disclose our secret.
I must guard her like the apple of my eye.
For the time being.
Then I'll give her to you, or even to your dragoons,
I don't care.
Invite her to supper tonight.
I'll have a look and decide if she's worthwhile.
But don't contradict me, whatever I say.
The Polish nobility, make me ashamed, when I compare them to foreign nobility.
A French gentleman can do the worst act.
But he won't raise his hand against his king.
Dear God!
What plots against our ex-king do you refer to?
Who tried to?
I met a certain gentleman on my way here.
That gentleman, not knowing my true sentiments for our king, he thought I was his enemy.
He promised to go to
Silesia to abduct the King for a reward, and deliver him dead or alive to the Swedes.
If he made me such an offer
I'd have him shot without judgment.
Your Grace alone can punish him.
Because he's your Colonel.
By God! My Colonel?!
Who is he?
Tell me!
His name is Kmicic.
That's not true!
If he's your relative or fiancé
I'm sorry to have told you this.
But I advise you to forget him for he's not worthy of you, miss.
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I was wrong to deny it.
That man is capable of anything.
Quiet!
That'll be... about ten horses.
Your Grace!
Have arms at the ready but don't shoot.
Who are you?
And you?
A patrol of confederated regiments.
We were sent to look for Swedes, and suspects.
It seems there are some here, if they won't answer.
Keep calm. Today one can't distinguish friend from foe.
We're going to the Confederates.
Is Colonel Wolodyjowski already in camp?
Perhaps he is but who's asking?
Wolodyjowski's friend.
Forgive me, Your Grace, for not recognizing your rank.
We're Wolodyjowski' soldiers, we'll take you to him.
Jesus! It's Kmicic! Get him!
Father, shall we thrash them?
Thrash them.
Stop!
Stop!
Surrender!
Tie them!
Take the horses and purses!
Take it all!
Hands off!
Holy Mary, it's ours!
Dress their wounds.
A brother's blood on my hands again.
Oh Christ show me the way or I shall surely lose my reason.
They're going against Radziwill...
It's a big force.
God grant them victory.
They've proclaimed me a villain and a traitor all over the country.
Nobody will trust Kmicic,
So, from now on, my name isn't Kmicic.
It is Babinicz, understand?
Yes, Colonel, sir.
Tell the men that even if they're flayed I'm Babinicz.
Where are we going, sir?
To the King.
Holy Mar)'-
But which king?
Not the Swedish one.
But His Majesty's taken refuge in Silesia.
We'll go to Silesia.
What have you decided?
To attack the Confederates with Swedish help.
Now, that's being a Radziwill!
The Swedes only respect the strong.
Go to Taurogi and muster as many men as you can.
Take the wench with you, but remember, if you rape her, it'll be the ruin of both of us.
It is my dearest wish to see you happy here.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Forgive me, my lady.
What's happened, Sakowicz?
Forgive us, my lady.
What happened there?
A spark fell on the powder.
And who caused the fireworks?
Braun did, My Grace.
Have the guilty man shot.
No,
Your Grace.
I beg you.
Yours only to order, not to beg.
I'd burn Taurogi for a single smile from you.
The Prince asks that you deign to accept this gift.
Give him my thanks.
Tell him I'm overjoyed with his gift.
And who are you, kind cavalier?
My name is Braun.
I'm the officer you saved from death.
I owe you my life.
I am at your command.
One more word, cavalier.
Your every word is a favour to me.
Do you know Kmicic?
I've only heard of him.
The Prince told me that Kmicic offered to abduct the Polish King.
Is it true?
I don't know, my lady.
But our officers told me that the Prince met Kmicic on his way to Kiejdany, and bought a horse from him.
The Prince came back very agitated.
It might have been then.
Must be an important Swede.
A general.
Stop.
I was sent to meet Your Excellency by the Swedish King who was anxious about the Imperial Envoy.
Sit down, sir.
Is victory still following
Charles Gustavus?
Some Polish troops have been dispersed, others have joined us.
A few cities and castles are still faithful to the Polish King.
Your Excellency, we are ready to go now.
I've heard the King of Sweden wants to take the Czestochowa Monastery.
His Imperial Majesty has a special sentiment towards this place.
There are orders to occupy all strongholds.
The gentry and peasants are already astir.
The Polish King is nearby in Silesia.
Where it is easy to stir up new revolts.
Excellency, the Monastery is a stronghold.
I am telling you what I heard.
The Swedes plan to attack the Monastery.
And soon this will happen.
You'd like us to believe your tidings.
Yes, by God.
What reward did you expect for it?
All this is my war booty.
I wanted to offer it to Holy Mary, but only after confession, with a clear conscience.
Truth shines through your anger.
But how could we drive the faithful out?
Keep the gates closed day and night?
Reverend Father.
As a soldier I advise you.
Make fast the walls, lock the gates.
For Christ's sake keep the gates locked.
Colonel, Your Grace, we've come to ask you to release us from service.
Don't you want to defend the Monastery?
Dogs!
Well, take your pay and away with you.
Don't touch it.
We're not worthy to look upon the splendours of Czestochowa.
Oh, Holy Virgin, Morning Star.
We're not worthy...
We're not worthy.
But we'll not stop serving you outside the walls.
We'll be your servants, sir, beyond them.
Away with you.
Your Grace, a messenger with important tidings from the Lord Hetman.
I'll receive him tomorrow.
No news from Prince Boguslav?
No, Your Grace.
And from the Swedish King?
The Confederates must have intercepted the letters.
Defeated and besieged,
I'm not needed by anyone.
Boguslav!
Boguslav!
Help.
What do you want?
Take that crown.
Help me.
People!
Jesus!
Where is the Prince?
Lower.
Fire!
Down!
Mad man! You could have been blown to powder!
What? Do we have too much powder?
Then you could load a gun with me and
I'd kill some Swedes after my death.
I didn't expect the clerics to have such officers.
May I ask your name?
Babinicz.
And I am Kuklinowski, an officer.
You must have heard of me.
My name and sword have won fame in many a war, not only in this country but also abroad.
Yes, I've heard of you.
Come on in.
No of fence to you, there are only two real soldiers in Poland.
Kuklinowski in the Kingdom and Kmicic in the Duchy of Lithuania.
The whole country has surrendered, the King has fled abroad.
We
Poles have come here with the Swedes to prevent sacrilege of this holy place when the Monastery falls.
And the Monastery must fall, they're bringing up heavy guns.
But how can we defend it it if you exasperate the enemy with your resistance.
It can only end in destruction of this holy church!
My brothers!
Reverend and beloved Fathers!
Don't have this on your conscience.
You didn't build this sanctuary and it is not only to serve you.
May it bring joy to our sons and grandsons.
I await your answer,
Reverend Fathers.
So you've failed?
Our priests are stubborn.
Between you and me, they're wrong.
We can't defend ourselves forever.
Yon think they're wrong?
You've got brains.
Show me through the gate,
I've something to tell you.
And I you.
All's burning under your feet, only fools stay in a burning house.
Perhaps you're afraid to be called a traitor?
Spit on them who call you that!
Join us!
Me, Kuklinowski, make you an offer.
Do you say that as the Swedish envoy?
I'm not an envoy outside the gate.
I'm speaking for myself.
To hell with this nasty fortress.
So you're speaking for yourself?
Yes.
And can I answer you as yourself?
Why certainly!
Then listen, Kuklinowski,
You're a scoundrel!
A villain and a stinking brute!
What?
A stinking brute!
Is that enough?
Or shall I spit in your face?
That's for you, not the envoy!
Our God he is our stronghold,
Our refuge and protection,
When the foe of truth divine,
Threatens it with destruction
Mother of God and yet virgin,
Blessed by the Lord, Maria,
Mother elected Maria, the Son, our God,
Pray obtain for us, let Him descend...
What do you want?
Father, the walls won't last more than one day.
Father, the culverin must be blown up.
Who's going to do it?
I Will.
Here's a sausage for you, doggy.
Who's there?
Me, Hans.
I'm looking for my ramrod.
Password?
Uppsala.
Hurry up, we're going to start firing soon.
Yes, I will hurry...
I know this bird
He's Babinicz from the Monastery garrison.
My name isn't Babinicz.
I am
Kmicic.
Kmicic?
It's a name famous throughout Poland.
General, he has no equal among soldiers, except perhaps me.
Kuklinowski, what do you want?
Do you want me to spare his life?
I want you to give him to me.
This is all I ask for my services.
Kuklinowski, do you want to save him?
Knacker!
All right, we can talk, we've time.
Kmicic, I told you there are only two real soldiers in this country.
Me and you.
The famous commander, Mr Kmicic, and Kuklinowski's got him, and will burn his sides.
Knacker!
Oh yes, he will burn his sides.
Well, how do you like it, darling?
Not too much right away.
Easy... We've got time.
Who the devil is it?
My Grace, General Miller wants to see you now, sir.
Oh, it's you, Kiemlicz.
All right.
Warm, wasn't it?
You can cool down a little now, darling.
I'll be back soon, for a chat.
Who's there?
We came to have a look.
Then look, you've not seen such a wonder before...
We've been looking for a chance since morning.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Go on! Cut the Colonel's bonds.
The horses are waiting.
How are you feeling, sir?
My legs are a little weak.
Some vodka will help.
Clothes for Mr. Colonel!
I feel better already.
He burnt my side, a little, but it's nothing.
Quick!
I'm all good already.
The horses are waiting.
Oh, no! It cannot be.
I'll stay and wait, for that traitor.
Kiemlicz! What the hell?
Are you mad?
Miller's asleep, they didn't let me in.
What is it?
An officer's waiting for
Your Grace in the stable.
Well, Mr Kuklinowski?
You wanted to be the equal of Kmicic, you scoundrel?
Be one of his company?
Meet Kmicic then!
I'll let you live, so that you can meditate on Kmicic.
Mount the horses. Let's go!
Where to, sir?
To Silesia!
To the King!
I do not say you lie, cavalier.
But if you spoke the truth, your side should be burnt.
Your majesty!
Let the doubting Thomases touch my wounds.
I do believe you.
I never doubted you were telling the truth.
Your merit and pain will not pass for nothing.
But many spies are sent here.
Prince Boguslav reported that an attempt on us was planned.
An attempt on Your Majesty?
We were reported there was a man who offered to abduct us.
And bring us dead or alive to the Swedes.
Who was it?
A certain Kmicic.
It's a lie.
It's a lie!
Prince Boguslav is a liar!
Don't believe that traitor,
Your Majesty!
He lied to disgrace his enemy!
Lift him up and call a doctor.
Your Grace,
God forbid that
I say anything against him,
But he shouldn't be trusted too readily.
Why shouldn't I trust a soldier who's shed his blood for our country and for us?
I haven't yet lost my throne if I have such defenders.
He'll stay with me.
But, Your Majesty...
Enough about this.
Let us discuss the matters I summoned you to.
We're going back to Poland.
Your Majesty, it results from various reports that the time is ripe to return and the King's presence may hasten the victory.
The Tartar Khan has promised his help if the King returns to the motherland.
You traitor!
Treason!
Wait!
For Christ's sake!
Escape, Your Majesty!
I'll hold them!
Kiemlicz,
Follow me!
Forgive me, my sons.
We forgive.
And you forgive us, Father.
I do.
Good people!
Do you know who you've just rescued?
This is your King, you have saved his life.
Your merits won't be forgotten.
Look for Babinicz!
To think you called him traitor!
It is my fault, Your Majesty.
Look for Babinicz!
I will not leave until
I look into his face.
He's still breathing!
Dear God, Babinicz, how shall I repay you?
I'm not Babinicz.
I'm
Kmicic.
You let the Polish King pass.
You let Czarnicki pass.
But Your Majesty...
Your Majesty always has to put his generals' blunders right.
Where is my beloved brother the Polish King now? Tell me!
Where are the Polish armies?
Any news of the enemy?
None, Your Majesty.
We only broke down some peasants and nobles.
Even if I have to chase my beloved royal brother all over Poland,
I'll catch him.
Here's to those who were the first to raise their swords against the traitor Radziwill.
We disobeyed orders for the first and God grant, for the last time.
We couldn't do otherwise.
Allegiance must have its limits, beyond which there is only guilt and crime.
Speaking of Your Majesty's safety,
It was heard from
Prince Boguslav's mouth that...
Was it about Kmicic?
Yes, Your Majesty.
None of that was true,
Boguslav was lying.
Call Babinicz.
But tell me what you know about the man.
He was a great soldier but terribly wild.
And he discredited himself in Kiejdany.
But he entreated Radziwill not to shoot us.
Really?
And Radziwill released you?
Mr Zagloba rescued us from captivity.
He drank with the officer saying he was his kin, took his clothes and went for my regiment.
Without boasting I did it.
Where did you get such wits?
It's a secret, but one must always carry with him hemp seeds and eat them little by Iitle.
It sharpens the wits enormously.
But Why?
There's oil in hemp and that oils the brain.
But the oil goes to your belly not to your brain.
I've got a method for that, too.
One must drink a lot of wine.
The oil, being lighter, floats on top.
The wine, going to one's head, carries it up.
What a shrewd fellow!
You'll find a few bottles in your rooms.
Jesus Christ!
Your Majesty! This is Kmicic!
You've known him as a brawler and Radziwill's ally.
And he's the hero of Czestochowa and my loyal servant, who shed his blood for me.
This is the new Kmicic.
Meet him and love him, he's worth it.
It was not me he wanted to abduct but Prince Boguslav.
Embrace him!
I have liked you from the start!
And I you!
What angel has converted you?
Did you find many people with the Hetman?
Just a few foreign officers.
By God,
I'm not asking about soldiers!
Boguslav took Miss Billewicz to Taurogi.
Woe!
She still loves that fellow Kmicic.
That's certain.
You're lucky to have me as your friend.
Tell me what the devil has whispered in your ear?
Tell me.
I'll be your best man, Your Majesty.
Don't fool, speak up!
There's a defrocked priest here.
What do I care?
He'll tack you together, but as he's a poor craftsman, not a member of the guild, it'll be easy to unpick the stitches.
Do you understand, Your Grace?
Dammit, I understand very well!
Charles Gustavus has summoned me.
I must go in a few days.
Haste will be the explanation why a paltry cleric marries you.
Some day you'll be hanged, Sakowicz.
It cannot be otherwise.
Quicker.
Close in!
I'm still weak.
We take the field today.
I envy you.
Your time will come, remember, sword practice every day, it won't be easy with Boguslav.
One of us is destined to die.
You bend your wrist too much.
A brother wouldn't do more for me.
Look how this candle burns.
What does it augur?
That virtue will melt tonight like wax.
If it could be done now!
If we could be married at midnight.
Put irons in the fire in case the Priest refuses.
It won't be necessary, he is a black villain.
So it'll be a villanous wedding.
Can't be otherwise where the best man's a pimp.
May I see Olenka?
Your Grace...
She says her grandfather's will forbids her to decide her fate.
And that she wouldn't marry Your Grace anyway.
Do you hear that, Sakowicz?
I scoff at your decisions and wills!
But we don't.
According to his last will, she must either take the veil or marry Kmicic.
Who?
Kmicic?
I'll give you Kmicic!
Shut up, you misfit.
Shut up, you withered old maid or I'll cut your sweet throat.
The girl attacked me, she had a dagger,
I knocked it out of her hand, as they taught me in ltalia...
Suddenly I felt a terrible pain, I fell into darkness, my head's still reeling.
The devil must be helping them.
Which of them practices witchcraft?
Not her, she's virtuous.
Perhaps the aunt.
That might be.
The foe has put fire and water between us and is scoffing at us.
Gentlemen!
He who loves God and his country - follow me!
Heir to the house of Genghis Khan, and master of great Hordes.
He will convey our secret thoughts to Your Majesty.
He is our servant and faithful dog who will obey Your Majesty to the death.
They'll start killing the innocent and burning homes.
Your Majesty, allow me to have these Tartars under my command.
I agree.
If the King sent you as a guide, you'll show me the way.
The King sent me as commander, not as a guide.
The Khan rules the Tartars, not the King.
Then listen to me, Aga.
The Khan gave you to the King like a dog.
So don't offend the King, or you'll be taken on a leash like a dog.
Don't irritate me!
Listen, you son of a goat!
You wanted freedom to plunder, burn and slaughter!
You wanted a guide?
Here's your guide!
Here's your guide!
Look at that, slave!
Give me another horse!
Your Worthiness, they won't cross the river.
Then it's no use hiding.
Lead us to attack, Babinicz!
Gentlemen, to your regiments!
Front to the river!
Fire at the ford!
Your Eminence,
I'd try that ford again.
Take the light cavalry, cross the river and attack the supply columns.
My Lord,
Kmicic will be killed!
If he has a head on his shoulders, he'll win, not die.
Now gm!
Cease fire!
That's what I wanted!
Don't kill me! The girl...
Speak up!
What did you do to her?
Spare me, I'll give her back.
I'd give a hundred rascals like you for one hair of hers.
But I don't believe you!
Traitor and perjurer!
I've given the order the order she will die if you kill me.
I'd sooner have expected death.
The devil gave orders to kill Olenka if he dies.
You've released a traitor to the Motherland!
Punish me, God, for my sins, not by my guilt, but by your mercy,
I'll never pass a sentence upon her!
What do you intend to do?
I'm going to Taurogi.
Charles Gustavus is gathering big forces,
I'll be back in two weeks.
Enough!
The Motherland won't perish in two weeks.
Miss Billewicz will bequeath you Wodokty, together with all the land she owns.
The Monastery will get everything you see here.
Are there many sheep?
Are you preparing to shear them already?
One will be enough for you.
Stop!
Stop!
Is he still alive, or dead?
Alive, but death hovers over him.
He was wounded by the Swedes.
He asked to be taken to Lubicz.
That's where he wants to die.
Hurry!
Lord, count in his favour that he's dying at the hand of the enemy.
Forgive him.
Have mercy on him.
Soroka?
At your service, sir.
Who is at
Wodokty?
The young lady.
Praise to God!
Did they ask about me?
Every day, until we told them that you're going to live.
And then they stopped?
Then they stopped.
What do you think of Kmicic, my daughter?
God knows that I don't want to think about him.
But he risked his life and shed his blood for his country.
When? When the foe was losing.
When he could profit by it.
What's of his contribution in this?
That's true, that's true.
Can a chance wound efface that?
I'd give everything for it not to be so.
But it's done and can't be undone.
Praise be to Jesus Christ.
For ever and ever.
We, Jan Kazimierz, King of Poland,
Grand Duke of Lithuania,
Masovia, Prussia etc. etc. etc.
In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.
We announce hereby to all that whatever guilt and punishment weighed upon Andrzej Kmicic, they must, considering his subsequent merits and glory be wiped away from human memory.
Andrzej Kmicic was beguiled and persuaded by Prince Radziwill, but saw his error and not only did he never promise to lift his hand against us, but abducted Prince Boguslav to avenge us and the ravaged Motherland.
God, have mercy on me!
Wounded by the Prince, he recovered and defended the Holy Shrine of Czestochowa, where he blew up the biggest
Swedish cannon.
Apprehended by the cruel foe his living flesh was burnt with fire.
Saved from this predicament by the Holy Virgin's power, he came to us, to Silesia, and during our journey back to the Motherland defending our person on the battlefield was found as dead.
Oh God, God!
And when he recovered owing to our care, he fought on, till the enemy was driven away from our country.
Therefore we, considering all his merits, have decided to proclaim them publicly, so that he no longer be persecuted by human hate, but may live in fame and be generally loved as is due to a good man.
Well, Olenka... well?
Jedrus,
I'm not worthy to kiss your wounds!
I'm speaking to you now, Andrzej!
It's not enough to risk your life, slaughter the enemy, so many men have been killed, now you must supply our beloved country with new defenders.
And I trust you won't lack the courage or the desire to do so.
Vivat!
I wish you every happiness, Colonel!

[Gasps]
Oh, my God!
My daddy died that way.
Crawled off in the bushes and bled to death.
Maybe you were the cause.
Are you dyin', Mr. Yank?
Help me.
- What's your name, girl?
- Amelia.
But everybody calls me Amy.
I'm Corporal John McBurney, but everybody calls me McB.
- How old are you, Amy?
- Twelve.
Thirteen in September.
Old enough for kisses.
Don't give up now, Mr. Yank.
I mean, Mr. McB.
Just over there.
Miss Martha, that smoke's sure getting awful close.
You figure them Yanks is gonna burn this place down?
Hallie, don't talk that way. It's hard enough to get the girls to study.
Es-tu aujourd'hui a Paris?
I can't emphasize enough... that French is a smilin' language.
Le mari de Marie est ici aujourd'hui a Paris.
Abigail... you're not paying attention.
I'm sorry, Miss Edwina, but the war is soundin' so close.
Doris says, if the Yankees win... they'll rape every one of us.
[Amy] Miss Martha!
Miss Martha!
[Bell Ringing]
[Amy] Help!
Miss Martha!
[Amy] Help!
He's dyin'!
How did he get here?
By the grace of God, ma'am.
The grace of God in the form of this here child.
What were you doin' off the school grounds?
Just pickin' some mushrooms.
And I didn't notice how far...
You know the punishment for leaving the grounds.
Get him into the house.
Come and help me.
Lift.
[Amy] Miss Martha,
I couldn't leave him there to die.
Well, you wouldn't have had to worry about it.
There'd have been one less enemy soldier.
[McB] Corporal John McBurney.
66th New York.
I surrender to the prettiest Confederates...
[Janie] A real blue belly.
There's only one way to tell if he's a Yank.
- How's that?
- Take off his pants.
- Yanks have tails.
- Doris, stop that nonsense!
Amy, run out ahead and open up the door.
And then come back and tie the blue rag on the gate.
Go on!
You hear that?
The blue rag's a signal for our local patrollers.
We're gonna feel awful proud turnin' one over to them.
- Is he dead?
- Lizzie, why didn't you sound the alarm?
- You must have seen them crossin' the fields.
- I was readin'...
The lookout is not a readin' room.
Get back up on that widow's walk.
If you see any of our soldiers comin', let me know at once.
Let's put him down on the steps.
Careful.
There.
Doris, Abigail, get some sheets... and make up the divan in the music room.
I'll go put the water on to boil.
Amy, will you put the blue rag on the gate as you were told?
Couldn't we wait a bit for that?
His pulse is weak and he's lost a lot of blood.
Gallons and gallons, Miss Martha.
They'd take him away... even though he's half dead.
They're not likely to be by again today... and they'd wait until we'd dressed his wounds.
Will you do as I asked?
[Martha] If this war goes on much longer, I'll forget I ever was a woman.
The water's on to boil.
Y'all wastin' your time.
I say we fix his leg, turn him over to the patrol.
He'll die in prison just the same.
[Raven Cawing]
[Hallie] Mr. Yankee... there was enough iron in your leg to shoe a horse.
I'm afraid it's some time since the corporal had a bath.
I noticed.
You ladies leave.
I'll get some clean water and wash him down.
I'll fetch one of my brother's nightshirts.
Come, Edwina.
I thought so.
Is he going to die?
Some day.
But for now, he's quite all right.
I don't want anyone poking in here or lurking in the halls.
There's lots of mending to be done.
Into the parlor, all of you.
Pay no attention to them, Amy.
Did the ant kill the caterpillar?
No, they joined together and dragged him underground.
Probably to eat him.
I don't see what this has to do with that Yank you brought here.
I do.
The Yank's an intruder, just like the caterpillar.
And you should never have brought him here.
- I agree. He's probably a spy.
- I doubt that, Janie.
Miss Edwina, aren't you afraid of that blue belly?
No.
It's bad manners to call him a blue belly.
He has a name.
Corporal John McBurney.
Call him by it.
I call him Mr. McB.
And I think he's ever so handsome.
I got him cleaned good to the waist.
I'll lift him... and you put the nightshirt on him.
- All right, give me the other arm.
- Yes, Miss Martha.
Help me.
Hold the sleeve and hold it up.
Yes, Miss Martha.
Now, pull off his pants.
Go ahead, Miss Martha. He's not made no different than your brother.
I have asked you never to speak of my brother.
Sorry, Miss Martha,
I didn't mean nothin'.
The nightshirt recalled
Master Miles to me.
Surprisin' it didn't you too. Surprisin' you brang this Yank into your house... him bein' a man and all.
- I didn't want to.
- [Clanging]
Soldiers on the road.
They're our boys.
- All right, Lizzie.
- Should I go back up?
No, I should have had you relieved before.
- Janie, I believe it's your watch.
- May we go greet 'em?
No... don't want them to see you girls.
Come along, girls.
Captain.
- What's the news?
- We won. Grant's retreatin'.
Oh, thank God.
Get back here, Yank!
- No!
- Shoot him!
Hold your fire!
Get him and throw him in the wagon.
[Captain]
He was wantin' to be shot.
Prefers a quick death to a slow death in Fayette Prison.
That's where the poor devils are headed.
How many young ladies are here?
We have six students and a teacher.
I sure wouldn't advertise it if I were you.
Oh, you mean on the sign?
A lot of Yanks are separated from their units.
They're roamin' the woods and they're desperate.
You think Miss Martha is gonna tell 'em about Mr. McB?
'Course she'll tell 'em.
That's why she went out there.
So, take care, ma'am.
- Captain! Captain...
- Yes, ma'am?
Our prayers go with you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Forward!
They're goin' on.
What name do you go by?
Hallie.
Well, you can call me McB.
Yank'll do fine.
You and I oughta be friends, Hallie.
How do you figure that?
Well, we're both kinda prisoners here, aren't we?
With one difference, Mr. Yank.
I can run.
I love you, Mr. Crow... but until your wing's mended, it's for your own good.
[Martha]
You can lower it now.
I couldn't have operated this school without you.
- I'm very grateful to you.
- I'm the one to be grateful.
You've given me the only home
I have, Miss Martha.
Even after the war is over, it'll still be difficult for years to come.
I'll have to devote myself to runnin' the farm.
I'd like you to concentrate on building the school up again.
You've become very dear to me, Edwina.
And I'm prepared to make you a partner.
And provide in my will that you'll inherit full ownership.
Miss Martha... that's unbelievably generous.
I don't know what to say.
Well, there's not an ounce of generosity in it.
I need somebody capable and responsible.
You're my guarantee that the school will continue... to bear my name and maintain my standards.
I don't know what to s...
That's wonderful.
You know, you should pray for the North to win.
Why?
You don't like being a slave, do you?
No, do you?
Me?
Oh, I'm nobody's slave.
You mean, you just went out and got yourself shot up...
'cause you like being shot up?
Sometimes a man's gotta do things... he doesn't particularly like.
Not if he's free, he don't.
And you white folks ain't killin' each other because you care about us niggers.
A white man's the same everywhere in this world.
You should say that men are the same everywhere, no matter what color.
Same as a beautiful...
What's goin' on?
Sounds like maybe they're makin' you a coffin.
How come you're not turnin' our Yankee in?
In his condition, he'd die in that Fayette Prison.
This'll hold him till he's better.
I could probably kick those shutters open with my bad leg.
Perhaps, Corporal, but not without bein' heard.
Girls!
[Amy] Good night.
Back to your beds, instantly.
At least it gives her an opportunity... to learn what a man's body feels like.
Go back to your room.
- How is he?
- He has a fever.
You must be tired.
Wouldn't you like a chance to go to your closet?
I might sponge parts of him you wouldn't.
Oh!
I knew what you were the minute you came to this school.
A hussy is a hussy.
You come in here again... and you'll find your face in a bucket of water!
Do I smell eggs for breakfast?
Yes, Miss Edwina.
Hallie says Mr. McB brought us luck.
Those hens finally laid some eggs.
You look very pretty, Edwina.
The corporal seems to be having an effect on all of us.
How is the corporal this morning?
Hungry.
How long is he gonna stay in the music room?
Till he is well enough to turn over to the patrollers.
I wanna practice my harp, but I can't with an enemy in the same room.
So that's the answer.
I always wondered what it would take to make you practice.
Hello.
What's your name?
Edwina.
- Mine is...
- Corporal John McBurney.
Now, how'd you know that?
You said so when you came here.
Did I?
Oh, I must've forgotten all about that.
You know, Edwina...
I got the strangest feeling that I'm a prisoner... in some sort of girls' school.
It is a girls' school.
Well, you are an enemy soldier.
Are you the head of the school?
Lady in the portrait there.
Miss Martha Farnsworth.
- Who's the man with her?
- Her brother, Miles.
Where's he?
He disappeared.
He's presumed dead.
There's no man around here at all?
Well...
I sure thank providence for sending me here... rather than to one of your prisons.
I wish it were up to me what happens to you, but it isn't.
Miss Martha will decide.
Bye.
Well, there's the little darlin' that saved my life.
Come on in. Sit down.
I can't.
Your room is out-of-bounds.
Oh, I told Randolph all about you.
The patrol.
But even if I sounded the alarm,
Miss Martha wouldn't stop them.
It's treason!
Not tyin' on the blue rag to signal the patrol is treason.
Damn!
Damn! Damn!
[Harpsichord]
That was very nice.
You said there were no men around here. Who's Randolph?
Oh, I forgot about Randolph.
I'm sure you'll meet him.
Who is he?
Randolph is a turtle.
He's a pet of Amy's.
Oh.
Don't go.
You may leave now... and your soldiers might come or something. I may never see you again.
I don't even know your last name.
Dabney.
- Why are you afraid of me, Edwina?
- I'm not.
Not really.
I mean, it has nothing to do with you.
[McB] It's just that
I'm a Yankee now.
- I don't suppose Yankees are any different than other men.
- Oh, I see.
So you're just afraid of men in general?
Not afraid, I just don't... trust them.
Any of them.
It sounds like some man didn't treat you too kindly.
Only I would've bet that you'd never been in love.
Too bad you couldn't have bet.
You'd have won.
Then how'd you get your unfair opinion of men?
I'd rather not talk about it.
We won't, then.
How long have you been at this school?
Since I was fifteen.
Seven years.
Except for Sunday church,
I've rarely been away...
- from the school grounds for all those years.
- I wonder... if sometimes you don't think of yourself as a sleeping beauty in a castle... waiting for a prince to free you... with a kiss.
- I wish we didn't have to send him to prison.
- We've no choice.
Harboring the enemy is a crime.
A very serious crime.
- You must be Miss Farnsworth.
- I am.
I was beginning to think you were avoiding me.
I wanted to thank you for all you've done, ma'am.
I don't want your thanks.
I just want you well enough to turn over to the authorities.
- You certainly don't mince words. I like that.
- Do you indeed?
Think it makes any difference to me whether you like it or not?
No, I guess it doesn't, but I still can't help being grateful.
Don't be.
It's simply a matter of ethics.
Something you probably wouldn't understand.
Well, you might be surprised, ma'am.
It was ethics that got me wounded in the first place.
How so?
Well, you see, ma'am,
I'm a Quaker.
And I don't... carry weapons into battle,
I carry bandages.
And my company, we were fighting in this thicket... and there was this wounded rebel officer... who was trying to crawl away from the fire.
My duty was to stay with my men... but my ethics wouldn't let me.
I carried that reb to safety.
That's why I got shot.
Now, my conscience does bother me... because I should've stayed with my own troops.
I feel like I deserted them, you might say.
Do your hands hurt you terribly?
Well, there's nothing more painful than burns, ma'am.
A few bottles left in my father's wine cellar.
If the pain gets too great,
I'll ask Hallie to bring you some.
Does seem like a good occasion, and I would love some wine.
It was offered for your pain, not for your pleasure!
It's just that sometimes the two do go together.
Corporal McBurney... you are not our guest, but a somewhat unwelcome visitor.
We don't propose to entertain you.
I don't expect it. It's just that
I've been at war a long time.
It's been months since I've seen a woman's face.
You'll find I'm easily amused.
If you get any ideas of tryin' to amuse yourself with any of the ladies...
Wait just a minute...
You'll find yourself out on that road so fast you won't know what happened.
I'm not that kind of man.
You know that.
I know nothing of the kind.
How long does it take you, ma'am... to get to know someone?
To get to know me?
You'll never find out.
You won't be here that long.
We'll continue our study of the Gospel according to Saint Luke, chapter 11.
"And it ca..."
- [Whispering]
- Can't you wait until after Bible reading?
I really can't, Miss Martha.
All right, hurry back.
Chapter 11.
"And it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place...
"when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him...
Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples."
Well, well.
I just thought I'd introduce myself proper. I'm Carol.
Carol, that's about the nicest introduction I've ever had.
And to the prettiest girl.
How old are you?
Seventeen, but I know a lot more than girls my age.
Oh, I'll bet you do.
Gotta get back to...
Bible readin'.
Say a prayer for me, will you?
I would, but I've no idea what you want.
The butter churned out to a good five pounds.
That ought to trade for a sack of flour.
And we need flour bad.
Sweetener, too, Miss Martha.
If he doesn't have sugar, take molasses or honey.
You talk as though I didn't know how to barter with Phil MacPherson.
If he has 'em, I'll get 'em.
Hallie, you might shave
Corporal McBurney.
I'm tired of lookin' at that stubble.
Bye, Miss Martha.
Good-bye, Miss Martha.
Mr. McB?
Mr. McB?
- Good mornin'.
- Good morning, little friend.
Feelin' better, Mr. McB?
Well, I'm a little bit bed weary, that's all.
There's a pair of crutches in the barn.
Been there a long time.
Should I get 'em for you?
Again, I'd be indebted to you, Amy.
Can you see him?
So that's Randolph, huh?
Yes. And I love him very much.
Not as much as you do me, I hope.
As much, but different.
Catch some flies for him to eat...
- while I'm gone.
- Bye.
If livin' was a thing that money could buy
Don't you know the rich would live, Lord, before we die
All my troubles
Is that all you're gonna give?
Guess you're dryin' up like the rest of us women around here.
What you after in this barn, Miss Amy?
Those crutches.
For Mr. McB.
You get permission from Miss Martha?
Well, I think we should refuse to work the garden... till Miss Martha stops givin' food to the enemy of the Confederacy.
The Bible says,
"Love thy enemy."
Can't let a man like that starve to death.
Ain't enough of them now.
Miss Doris... that thing in your hand is for hoein', not leanin'.
It's nigger work!
And it's ruinin' my hands.
Why, I'll never be able to play the harp again.
That nigger work is what feed us.
And if we don't get enough of it... you're goin' where you can play your harp your whole livelong day.
[Laughter]
[Humming]
Like to suck a raw egg while
I shave you? Lt'll give you energy.
Sure. Thanks.
You get the thanks. Those hens hadn't laid for months 'fore you came.
You must got rooster blood in you.
Judging by my boots and uniform,
I don't have any blood in me.
Miss Martha said
I should shave you.
But I ain't so sure.
I don't think the Lord wanted a man's face all smooth like a baby's bottom.
That's why he gave him whiskers.
- Might be a sin to shave that growth off.
- Then don't do it.
Sinning oughta be saved for much more important things.
I better shave you.
Miss Martha give me my orders.
Not the Lord.
And even without whiskers... you wouldn't look half bad for a white man.
I like hearin' you laugh, Hallie.
My Ben used to say that.
Who's Ben, your husband?
No, we weren't rightly married, but we sure loved each other.
- Did he die?
- Don't know.
He run off a long time back.
Miss Martha's brother... he decided to sell Ben off.
So, Ben run away.
So, he finally got us separated all the same.
Listen, Hallie, you help me get away from here... and I'll try to find out what happened to your Ben.
Even if I have to go to General Grant personally.
You trust me now, Hal.
I'll think on it, Mr. Yank.
Oh, let me help you.
You all right?
Oh, yeah. I just overdid it a little, that's all.
Well, sit down.
- There.
- Thank you.
- All right?
- Won't you sit down for a minute?
No, I can't.
I have a class in a minute.
Just for that minute, then, please. Come on.
Well...
I woke up this morning wondering if you could possibly be... as lovely and sweet as you were last night.
But now I see you're even prettier than I remembered.
Edwina, one way or the other
I'm gonna have to leave here... pretty soon.
There isn't time enough to get to know each other in the normal way.
So I've got to ask you something
I wouldn't ordinarily ask you.
See, I've never felt this way about anybody before.
I mean, you're somebody
I've always wanted to meet.
And if I'm gonna be in prison... or somewhere else,
I don't want to just keep... thinking and hoping, if nothing's gonna happen.
I mean, if I'm just another
Billy Yank enemy...
You're not.
I like you very much.
[Lizzie] Miss Martha's back!
- How did you get those crutches, Corporal?
- I brung them to him.
You had no business doing it without being told. Who let him out of the room?
I was told to shave him and it was too dark in that boarded-up room.
Well, at least it's some improvement.
I'm sorry I let her shave me, ma'am.
I've always felt the Lord didn't intend... for a man's face to be smooth as a baby's bottom.
- Go unload the buggy.
- Yes, ma'am.
And thanks to you,
I've got most of my strength back.
What do you think of that?
That it's a foolish waste of energy.
Come help me bring in the supplies.
I'd be glad to, ma'am.
There's a lot of things
I could do... to repay you for savin' me.
There's just about nothin'
I don't like about farming.
And I have a great respect for land.
It really used to grieve me when our outfit was movin' this way.
And I could see what this war was doin' to this fine land.
Grieves me too. I used to enjoy ridin' through our fields... seein' them rich with crops.
There are things that could use a man's help.
Thank you, ma'am.
You won't regret it, I guarantee you.
There are enough of us to keep an eye on you during the day... but at night... we'll lock you up again.
Well, of course.
I'd expect that.
You can take the buggy now, Hallie.
You'll need some clothes.
Come on, Mae.
Can't have you hobbling around the girls in that.
Come on, Mae.
- I'll get you some things that belonged to my brother.
- You're an angel, ma'am.
An absolute angel.
Thank you.
You've been a great help.
[Edwina] The napkin should not be fastened at the neck.
It should be laid conveniently across the lap.
And one corner should be lifted to wipe the mouth.
Men who wear a mustache are obliged to manipulate a napkin in a vigorous manner...
Miss Edwina?
...which would be unpardonable in a lady.
- Yes?
- Permission to go to my closet?
- But nowhere else.
- Of course not.
Now, we will all demonstrate the proper use of a napkin.
Very nice.
- 'Morning.
- Well, good morning to you.
Games for two are more fun.
Oh, now you surprise me.
Never thought you'd be afraid to kiss a girl.
Well, my mother told me it might just stunt my growth.
Well, maybe your mama was right.
You are well-developed.
I'd have to say the same about you.
Well, it's not the same.
I mean your shoulders and arms, you seem to be all muscle.
I bet there's not a soft spot on you.
She's not in her room.
Not even in the music room as I expected.
But then, neither is the blue belly.
Doris will take charge.
You're obviously very hard to resist, Carol... but I'm not anxious to have my head on a chopping block.
What about later on tonight, when everybody's asleep?
What about it?
I just happen to have a room to myself.
In the attic.
Can you walk up stairs?
I suppose, but I couldn't walk through a locked door.
Oh, I forgot about that.
I just thought
I'd pay our guest a little visit.
He wanted to know what class you were teachin'.
And I told him etiquette.
And how to behave like a lady under all circumstances.
All that anger in those pretty green eyes?
I told you before,
I don't trust any man.
Did you ask her if she looks upon you as a Billy Yank enemy?
Or if she's waiting for a prince to awaken her with a kiss?
Now, come on, that's nonsense.
She doesn't mean a thing to me.
Just passing time, talking with her, that's all.
Same as my father said to my mother.
"They mean nothin' to me.
I was only amusin' myself."
Oh, so your father was the man?
No. No, Johnny.
I know how I feel.
If you don't feel the same way, just tell me.
You know how I feel.
When the war's over,
I'll come back and get you.
- Please, Johnny, don't say that unless you mean it.
- You know I mean it.
[Edwina] Oh. Oh, no.
Johnny, no. Oh.
[McB's Voice] When the war's over,
I'll come back and get you.
If you'll let me.
- Please, Johnny, don't say that unless you mean it.
- You know I mean it.
Oh. Oh, no.
Oh. Oh, I can't.
Not like this.
Not without being sure.
Maybe when the war's over.
It's just that I never have before.
Don't be angry.
If you still feel the same way...
There's riders out in front.
Maybe three or four of them.
It's probably just the patrollers.
Or the girl on lookout, she would've sounded the alarm.
- They've stopped.
- They often do.
They water their horses, and then they ride on.
I better get back before I'm missed.
Miss Martha!
Miss Martha!
Hold it, Yank!
Hell, I ain't no Yank.
Who are you?
What're you doin' here?
Hurry, Miss Martha!
Hurry!
I was wounded... on leave from Gregg's Texans,
Longstreet's Corps.
- How come you're not in uniform?
- How come you're not?
- What's going on there?
- We caught him.
Why, Sam Jepson!
This is my cousin you've heard me talk about.
- It's my cousin.
- Cousin Martha, I always figured you looked down... on the Texas side of the family.
It pleases me that you... that you talk about us.
Of course, I didn't say what I said about you.
Can you explain this,
Miss Farnsworth?
- No, I can't explain it.
- It was tied on the gates.
I've no idea.
Unless it was one of the girls as a joke.
[Jepson]
These aren't times for joking.
One of my men could've been killed, or your cousin.
I know, Sam.
The girl who's responsible will be severely punished.
Take my word for it.
Well, I do, ma'am.
Thank you, Sam.
I'm sorry this happened.
You were splendid, ma'am, absolutely splendid.
You were quite splendid yourself, Corporal.
Your accent was pure Texas.
I wonder who put this rag on the gate.
I don't know, but you can bet I didn't.
Now that you've got your strength back... there's no reason to serve your meals in bed.
You'll have supper with us tonight.
Whatever you say, ma'am.
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[McB] I can't remember when...
I've ever been in such delightful company.
You young ladies are a fine tribute... to the excellence of your head mistress... to whom I will always be indebted.
- You needn't be.
- But I will, ma'am.
I used to make more use of my legs than most men.
Take dancing for instance.
I could wear out the arm of any fiddler.
If we had dancing here in the school...
I could teach the girls waltzes, reels, polkas.
[McB] Almost anything you could mention.
- Miss Martha, could we have a dance class?
- Yes, please?
- Can we?
- I'll take it under consideration.
We haven't had as lively a meal as this in a long time.
- I think it's disgraceful, eatin' with the enemy.
- So do I, Miss Martha.
You girls might have said something before supper.
- You may both be excused to go to your room.
- Ma'am, let them stay.
They're just voicing their patriotism.
Doris and Janie...
I admire your father fighting for the cause he thinks right.
If nobody's gonna finish those mushrooms, I could manage.
Please do, Corporal.
Amy picked them for you.
Thank you, Amy.
I'm particularly partial to mushrooms.
Now, I'm sorry... but I must turn to something unpleasant.
Today, somebody tied the blue rag...
Girls, into the kitchen.
Edwina, fetch the pistol.
It's in my room.
Hallie, go with them.
Hide yourself upstairs, Corporal.
If it's Union troops, you holler.
I'll make sure nothing happens to anyone.
- They're our soldiers.
- Thank God!
- Can you make it up the stairs?
- Yeah.
- I'll help him.
- No, you won't! Get in the kitchen.
[Pounding]
[Pounding]
- Let me have that pistol.
- No, I have to take it to Miss Martha.
- You care about what happens to me, don't ya?
- I don't want you shot.
[Pounding]
[Pounding]
Come in, Captain.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
That's all right, ma'am.
It's been a long time... since I've had to wait for such a pretty lady.
This vicinity's gonna be left unprotected.
Our boys gotta pull out for Champion's Hill... before them damn Yankees, beg your pardon... and secure the road to Vicksburg.
Why have you come here?
We heard about your school... and since we were scouting in this area... we decided to stop and see if we could be of any... assistance.
Thank you, Captain, but everything is fine here.
It seems to me as how you might be afraid of being molested by Yankees.
I could leave a couple of my boys to sleep in your barn.
That's generous, but it won't be necessary.
I don't mind staying with the ladies.
Y'all go on ahead.
I'll catch up.
You're very kind, but we cannot take you from your duties.
It seems to me as how it might serve some military purpose... for someone to stay behind, and kinda out of sight.
- That's right.
- I might stay myself.
Now, Scoggins, suppose you ride back and tell the colonel.
No, I cannot permit it.
One or two of you would be no protection.
Your presence here might draw attention to us... and provoke the Yankees into burning us down.
Good night, gentlemen.
Thank you for your concern.
I'd be right proud... to pay my compliments to them young ladies.
[Martha] That is very gentlemanly of you, Captain.
I'll tell them. Good night.
Come on, boys.
God bless you, gentlemen.
Good night.
It's all right.
They left.
I love you so much.
Were you scared, Miss Martha?
- I almost died, I was so scared.
- So was I.
Go up to your rooms.
I think it's treason to talk that way about our own boys.
[Amy] Oh, Doris, you think everything is treason.
Don't argue, girls. Hallie...
- bring a bottle of wine to the parlor.
- Yes, Miss Martha.
Today's been quite a strain.
Oh, give me the pistol.
[McB] Good night, young ladies.
[Girls] Good night, Mr. McB.
Good night, Mr. McB.
Will you come hear our prayers?
- I'm too excited to sleep.
- Me too.
Go on to your rooms.
I'll be there presently.
Oh, I see you can manage stairs.
You know, they leave the key in your door.
I could slip down and unlock it.
You'd find me much more interesting than Miss Edwina.
You little devil.
You're the one who tried to get me caught today.
Well... you shouldn't do things that make me jealous.
Would you care for some wine, Corporal?
- I'd be honored, ma'am.
- Do help yourself.
It's on the table.
I must say, you showed great courage tonight.
They were our soldiers.
There was no danger.
I think I know a little more about that than you do, ma'am.
And believe me, there was danger.
If you'd have shown any weakness... tonight's episode could've had a different ending.
I toast you.
You're a remarkable, beautiful woman.
Amy, you should've finished your prayers long ago.
I was praying for Mr. McB too.
[Janie] But it's wrong to pray for the enemy.
- My father says that God's on our side.
- So he is.
He's on the side of people everywhere.
No more talking.
Put out your candle, Amy.
- Good night, Miss Edwina.
- Good night.
I've been thinking, Corporal.
I've been thinking, Corporal.
This place needs a man, someone who knows farming.
How to handle farm hands.
Thinking about giving up the school, ma'am?
Oh, no.
But there won't be money for tuition, not for a long time.
But there will be money for anything we can grow.
Northern money.
When my brother and I ran this place... there were good northern markets for anything we could raise.
But... he isn't here now.
Never will be.
And I am?
Yes, you are.
Would you be interested in staying on here, Corporal?
Yes, I would.
Why were we all scared of our own soldiers?
All armies have some men who aren't nice.
Now get to sleep.
- Good night, Lizzie.
- Good night.
I want to take your brother's place, but I must warn you.
It won't be easy to act like a brother.
I'll try not to dictate... your personal behavior, Corporal.
And the joys we shared
As we tarried there
No lover has ever
[Footsteps]
[Giggling]
[Giggling]
[Giggling]
No!
Edwina, listen to me!
No, no, no!
You lying son-of-a-bitch!
You bastard!
You filthy lecher!
I hope you're dead!
Dead!
I hope you're dead!
Dead... dead.
[Gasping]
[Martha] I want all discussion of what happened tonight... to end now.
There are more urgent matters.
Do you think he's in much pain, Miss Martha?
[Martha] No, not after all the wine and laudanum we've given him.
He can't feel anything.
Why do you want him... in the dining room, Miss Martha?
I need him there to work on his leg.
[McB Mumbling]
His leg's not only fractured, the bone is splintered.
If the best doctors couldn't set it so it healed...
I certainly can't.
[McB] You're well-bosomed.
You stop your drunken chatter.
Now lift the harness and slide him on the table.
Don't be jealous about it.
You're well-bosomed too.
Sweet and ladylike.
So round and perky.
I hate you, Miss Martha!
Another teaspoon of laudanum should put him to sleep.
Give it to him.
[Amy Crying]
And now, Amy, you will go to your room... and you will not come out until you are told.
And if I ever want your opinion,
I'll ask for it!
I didn't say nothing.
I think you did.
I think you spoke very loudly!
Girls, go directly to your rooms.
Edwina, Hallie, Carol... stay here and don't take your eyes off him.
That shouldn't be hard for you to do.
I've reached a very difficult decision.
I hope it's the right one.
By this time tomorrow, his leg will be starting to mortify.
There's no death worse than one from gangrene... and I cannot let him die... inch-by-inch in screaming agony.
The only way to prevent that is to amputate.
- That mean you gonna cut off his leg?
- Yes.
But you ain't a doctor.
If he lives and blames you for making him a cripple, what you gonna say?
He would rather lose a leg than his life.
Can you be sure he'd die if you don't?
I'm sure.
What if he dies as a result of the operation?
My conscience would be clear.
It wouldn't be if I let him die... and did nothing to try and save him.
I suppose if we made the cut... above the popliteal division instead of below... we'd have fewer arteries to contend with.
There's goin' to be bleeding no matter where you cut.
We see a vessel bleeding, we tie it with thread.
If you're going to do it, do it and be done with it!
Turn his face away from me.
There is some frailty in you.
Dear Lord, we ask that you bless our efforts.
Mr. McB, are you coming around?
Amy.
I can tell it's night... when the stars come out.
And I can tell it's morning... when your freckles come in the room.
I must tell Miss Martha.
Miss Martha!
Miss Martha!
Miss Edwina!
- Come along and watch.
Hallie's going to bury it.
- Bury what?
What do you think?
The leg!
He's awake, Miss Martha.
Ladies.
I know you're expecting an apology... and you certainly deserve it... after the way
I abused your hospitality.
But first could you fix the splints... on my leg?
- It hurts so much.
- There are no splints.
How do you fix a broken leg without splints?
The pain is...
We saved your life, and you complain of pain.
But nobody dies of a broken leg.
If gangrenous, they do.
We had a choice:
Either let you die in agony... or remove the leg.
You're just trying to punish me.
The Lord knows I deserve it... but I know my legs are all right.
I can feel 'em all the way down to my toes.
It's a shock.
It has to be.
- But you're too intelligent...
- You dirty bitch!
Just because I didn't go to your bed.
Just because
I went to someone else's bed.
I should have let you die screaming!
Why should I have denied myself after all I'd been through?
You wanted to be so much the goddamn lady!
The virgin bitch.
Get out of here.
Get out of here!
[Distant Singing]
What do you think it is,
Miss Martha?
[Martha] It's a Union soldier camp.
Don't tell the other girls.
No need to frighten them.
There's nothing we can do.
[Amy] A cypress root is hard to cut, but it'll last forever.
That's why I picked it.
I found the tree... not far from where your soldiers are camped.
Union troops?
Where?
About three-miles north.
I haven't heard any sounds of any battle.
Must mean the rebels have retreated.
That's what Miss Martha said.
- Mr. McB?
- Hmm?
About Carol.
Yeah, what about her?
She said... you forced your way into her room and...
And that you...
Do you believe her?
No... but you were in her room. Why?
And she was all naked.
And I thought you loved me.
And I do, Amy.
Amy, go to your room.
Removing the ligatures will be painful.
- Do you want some laudanum?
- No thanks, kind lady.
I'll fall asleep, and then you might cut off... my other leg.
I'd welcome some wine, though.
You might welcome it, but you won't get it.
Undo your trouser leg.
Where's your virgin assistant?
Didn't she want to stay to finish the job?
Miss Edwina has no interest in what happens to you.
Young ladies, come get ready to eat.
Johnny?
Johnny?
- Who is it?
- Carol.
I'm sorry about what happened.
- I want you to know that.
- Don't think a thing of it.
I've just been thinking about... all the advantages... a one-legged man has.
He saves on socks.
Doesn't have to worry about trimming as many toenails.
Fewer corns and bunions.
I've even been contemplating... asking her to cut off the other leg.
What happened makes no difference to me.
I know it won't hinder you romantically.
I'm sure a one-legged man... or even a no-legged man... can enjoy himself that way, same as any man.
I'll do anything for you.
Then unlock this door.
I got some things I want to do.
But somebody might see me.
Do it while everyone else is eating.
- But they'd know it was me.
- No, they won't.
They'll just think somebody forgot to lock it.
All right, I'll try.
How long are you gonna keep him here?
As long as Union troops are in the area.
If he's here, he can't give information about us.
But sooner or later... they'll find the school anyway, won't they?
Not if our troops drive them back.
I'm praying for that, and when it happens the corporal will...
[Gunshot]
Sit right where you are, all of you!
Well, hello, Miss Farnsworth.
I've gotten most of my strength back.
With a little wine from your cellar,
I'll get the rest.
According to the new rules around here...
I'm gonna have the run of this place.
One is that I'm going to be with any young lady... that desires my company.
If you have any objections...
I'm gonna locate the Union cavalry... and tell 'em about some of the goodies... especially the bedding-down variety.
Don't get any ideas about closing the door on me.
I'm liable to just blow one of your ears off.
Unless I miss and hit one of your pretty eyes.
You're wrong to blame her.
Your leg was busted bad.
You don't have to be afraid of being sent to prison now.
Why don't you leave this place?
Not till I've had my fill.
You're a damn handsome woman.
Maybe I'll start with you.
[McB]
Go on down to the cellar.
I've been having a run of bad luck lately.
I understand the way to fix that is to have a black woman.
Then white boy... you better like it with a dead black woman...
'cause that's the only way you'll get it from this one.
Almighty God...
I ask that this school and its occupants... escape thy total wrath.
Be quiet and sit down.
Hallie, Janie's on watch.
I want her here.
- Close the door behind you.
- What can we do?
- I'm so scared.
- I know, dear.
He told me he was gonna kill me if I made any noise.
And he forced me to do what he wanted.
We understand, Carol.
He made me do the most terrible things.
Where the hell is everybody?
Edwina, you go sit in my chair.
Hallie, stay by me.
We must give him no provocation.
Well, well.
All the little seminar darlings.
What is the good lady
"seminaring" you in now?
Mister Johnny, please.
Why don't you just leave!
Yes, take your possessions with you.
And my leg!
Can I take that with me?
You girls know why Miss Dabney there... knocked me down the stairs.
That's because I went to Carol's room instead of hers.
And do you know how I got out of my room in the first place?
Because this fine lady,
Miss Farnsworth, unlocked my door... so I could go to her room.
And do you know why Miss Farnsworth... chopped off my leg and left me a cripple?
So I could stay on here, and be at her beck and call.
The picture in this locket.
- Is that your sweetheart?
- That's my brother.
- That wasn't the question.
- You stole that.
Give it back to me, please.
Why would I want to give it back?
It belonged to my mother.
I found it with a stack of letters with a blue ribbon...
- tied around it.
- You read his letters?
Enough.
- You beast!
- That's right!
But I don't run a school for young girls!
These girls might like to know what kind of woman runs this place!
Mr. McB, Randolph hasn't eaten in days!
You could get him to!
You tryin' to wheedle that woman?
Randolph!
God in heaven, child,
I didn't mean to do that.
Stay away from me!
I hate you!
Condemned me, that's what you've done.
To bitterness and drink, and doing mean things.
Why the hell didn't you just castrate me?
- Where are you going?
- To him. He needs help.
Not from you!
I will not let you make a fool of yourself!
What do you want?
I love you.
I love you!
Perhaps when he's sober again, he'll be more reasonable.
Perhaps together we can persuade him to leave.
You said he might send
Yankee soldiers here.
Yes, you're quite right, Janie.
Yes, we can't take that risk.
No one in this house is safe as long as he remains here.
The only question now is how to rid ourselves of him.
Enemy soldiers are always shot.
With what?
He's got the only gun.
Tie him up when he's asleep... and take him into the woods.
Just leave him there to die of thirst and hunger?
I think that would be too cruel, Miss Martha.
If he were tied up, why couldn't we hang him?
Oh, any such action would be too drastic.
None of us would want to be responsible for his death.
Or even be capable of it.
Maybe... if we were to prepare him an excellent supper... and said that we wanted to make it up to him.
Hallie... you could prepare your savory chicken.
And Amy... could pick some mushrooms.
They're his favorite dish... and we could prepare them... especially for him.
Do you think you could do that, Amy?
I know just where to find 'em.
I was surprised at your supper invitation, Miss Farnsworth.
I didn't know whether to accept or not.
I said and did some ugly things today.
I'm sober now.
I've told Edwina, and I want to tell you... and the rest of the girls how much I apologize.
We accept your apology, Corporal.
But I think now it's best if we don't speak about it.
Now, would you care to say grace...
Corporal?
Good bread, good meat... good God, let's eat.
God, we thank you for what we're about to receive... and we hope that the drums that divide us will soon be silent.
Now, everybody eat before Hallie's chicken gets cold.
Pass the biscuits to Corporal McBurney.
Pass the mushrooms, Amy.
Amy picked them especially for you.
Thank you, Amy.
Amy, I feel miserable about what happened today.
Anything I could do... to bring back your turtle,
I sure would.
But you must understand, it was the wine that...
- turned loose the devils in me.
- I do understand.
That's why I picked the mushrooms.
Mmm... and are they good, Amy.
They taste of the woods and the clean air... and mysterious shadows where pretty elves dance together.
What a romantic way to speak of mushrooms.
The first Union troops
I meet up with...
I'm gonna ask them if they'll post a guard around the school.
They do that for friendly Southerners.
What do you mean,
"meet up with"?
I mean, tomorrow morning at dawn I'll be leaving.
[Edwina] I'll see that... he doesn't forget to do that good turn.
I'm leaving with him.
We're going to be married.
That's right.
She asked me and I said yes.
No, I didn't!
Congratulations to you both.
But have you forgotten you're a partner here?
No... and I'll be grateful to you all my life.
But I love him.
I have to go with him.
[Martha] It's only natural... but supposing you do meet the soldiers.
Whether they're
Confederate or Union... he won't be able to protect you.
What will happen to you?
I've lived with the war for a long time.
It doesn't frighten me.
We're spoiling everybody's supper.
And Amy picked these mushrooms especially for me.
Edwina, will you have some?
And pass it on to the other girls.
Lizzie?
No, Edwina!
Don't.
Oh, my God!
[Crash]
Girls, finish your meal.
[Martha] Lizzie, that is not the stitch I showed you.
Watch how Doris does it.
[Doris] See, Lizzie?
[Doris] See, Lizzie?
You run the needle through both sides... then lock the stitch underneath, like this.
That's the way I did it.
No, it's not.
Try it again.
Doesn't look as if he suffered much.
I'm sure he didn't, Carol.
[Martha] I think probably his heart just gave out.
He was in a very weakened condition.
I love you.
[Lizzie] But I thought the mushrooms killed him.
You think I can't tell bad mushrooms from good ones?
And Mr. McB said himself how delicious they were.
Lizzie, Amy... open the gates.
Come all you pretty fair maids
Come walk in the sun
- Do we have classes today, Miss Martha?
- I don't see why not.
And don't let your young man ever carry a gun
Come all you young fellows
Take warning by me
Don't go for a soldier
Don't join no army
For the dove she will leave you
The raven will come
And death will come marching
At the beat of the drum
[Distant Drums]
[Dove Cooing]
THE THIRD PART OF THE NIGHT
And the first angel sounded the trumpet and
there followed hail and fire mingled with blood...
... and the third part of the trees was burnt up
and all green grass was burnt up.
The second angel sounded the trumpet
and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire was cast into the sea
and the third part of the sea became blood.
And the third part of those creatures died
which had life in the sea
and the third part
of the ships was destroyed.
And the third angel sounded the trumpet
and a great star fell from heaven
burning as it were a torch
and it fell on the third part of the rivers
and upon the fountains of waters.
And the third part of the waters
became wormwood.
And many men died of the waters
because they were made bitter.
The fourth angel sounded the trumpet and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so that the third part of them was darkened and the day did not shine for a third part of it and the night in like manner.
Listen, how silent everything is!
Your father was right.
We'll be safe and comfortable here.
You'll get on your feet again quickly.
How did all this happen?
You were ill for six weeks.
You swelled up to a monstrous size and then you got feverish and lost consciousness.
When you began to walk again, we came here.
Don't you remember?
I do remember.
Keep loving me, Michal.
I'm not the only one responsible for what has happened.
You're older than me, more mature.
You should have given me better guidance.
The doctor said you should go out for walks.
I'll help you to dress.
Why didn't my father come here?
I'm quite well now.
Your father doesn't speak to me.
Take Lukasz with you.
Look how handsome your daddy is.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Father, I still can't understand it.
She left him in a cruel way.
She let him die.
For a long time she didn't want to tell me he was feeding lice.
Oh God, who does not lead us...
Oh, God, who allows the fragile to be killed and who elevates blind hatred...
Oh, God, who allows cruelty to be propagated and people to torment each other...
Oh, God, who elevates the most evil ones and puts the whip into their hands...
Oh merciless God, have no mercy upon us.
What are you doing here? You were supposed to stay in the country for a month.
Helena is dead, so is my mother and Lukasz, and the house in the country was burnt down.
How can I help you?
I won't be feeding lice any more.
I'll have plenty of time now to do lots of things.
If you want me,
I would like be of use to you.
Listen, it's not so simple.
We are underground, do you understand?
Orders and discipline.
Don't worry. I can take orders.
I think that now I can do nothing better than follow orders, to stop despairing.
You'll have to forget your name, your father's and your mother's name and you'll have just a pseudonym.
- What do you want to call yourself?
- Grizzly or Blind.
Deaf or Lame.
The man who will be your commander is really blind.
Stay here.
Olek!
Olek!
What... What's happened to you?
I'm in labour.
There's nobody around. Please help me.
No, no, I'm not from the police.
You must run and save him.
We've been living here for only ten days.
I simply can't understand why they've been after him.
Hot water is in the kitchen.
Help me.
Lukasz...
I've been quick, haven't I?
I'm not yet ready.
I'm not yet prepared for it.
This isn't the time for me to become a father.
I'm from the municipal insurance office.
Helena!
I insure apartments against fire.
Helena!
The insurance is, in fact, compulsory.
In case of an accident we pay...
Helena!
Perhaps I'll show you...
Listen, this gentleman says he insures apartments against typhus.
Not against typhus but against fire.
I'm not sure whether there is insurance against diseases.
The only fire that could have broken out in this house died out a long time ago.
You shouldn't sit here in the darkness.
You should eat something.
My legs are itching.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I think I'll be going.
I've got to call at other apartments in this block.
- Do you make your living out of insurance?
- Yes.
Your attitude is too gentle.
You should shout at people.
Why?
Excuse me, I must help him.
It was me who found him his job.
Oh God, who deceiveth us, make us know what we are doing.
My wife looked exactly like you.
But she is dead.
My father took us to an old country house because I was very ill.
By us I mean Helena, Lukasz and me.
I left them wrapped up in bed coverings because it was cold.
But I'll go back there when it's safe.
You see, I've never known whether I'm important or unimportant, whether I'll die for somebody's sake or they'll die for mine.
People move on orbits that are so distant from each other.
They encounter each other so rarely and when they do, they often aren't those who should've been brought together.
It sometimes happens in the midst of a war, among lice, blood and muck.
I could have told them it was me they wanted, that your husband wore an overcoat like mine.
But they've wounded him and they wouldn't release either him or me.
Father, I would like to leave these things with you.
May I take your old overcoat?
Take it by all means.
Shall we play a tune together?
Father, they were killed, weren't they?
I saw it myself, I haven't gone mad.
Yes, both of them were killed.
God rest their souls.
What did you say?
They were killed.
Your mother and your woman.
My woman? You won't even say her name.
You were a bad father-in-law to her.
Don't get melodramatic.
Well, I suppose I have the right to tell you what I think of your personal affairs for once in my lifetime.
You destroyed somebody's happiness without giving a damn.
Even if it was only a superficial happiness.
You let that woman devour you.
When I arrived and saw how the illness was eating you away, how you were withering away,
I couldn't force myself to be properly objective.
Father, I had nothing to give her but the most despicable things we have to offer.
What?
I feel that wherever she is, alive or dead, she expects something from me.
But she's dead.
That's a mystery.
You can't put it into words.
Stay with me, my son.
What for?
Father and son, it's supposed to be bone of one's bone, blood of one's blood, and yet there's... a wall, a wall, a wall.
Your request is preposterous.
Who is he anyway?
What can he tell them?
None of us really knows.
For the moment we should be happy that you're alive.
However, I'm still thinking about your request.
So many valuable people have been arrested, the very life blood of our nation, and this man of yours is somebody unimportant.
We haven't got enough strength to put our hands into this vortex just to draw out a nonentity.
And yet I can't help worrying about it.
I feel more and more strongly that we're sinking into a world where all things have become alike.
Activity and non-activity, cruelty and indifference.
I cannot therefore give you an answer according to my conscience.
There's one thing which is not clear. You said you stayed part of the night in that apartment.
Yes.
Alone?
Yes.
Don't go back there until you get further orders.
Don't come here either, please.
I feel tired.
Please, leave me alone.
I'll try to give you an answer later.
Two zloties.
God bless you.
May I see Sister Klara?
Sister, may I see Olek's mother?
She's been very weak since yesterday.
She was restless in the night.
She called for me but she wouldn't talk.
Then she put her hand on her bosom and said, "My son is dead".
- What did the doctor say?
- The doctors were taken away two months ago.
I am told they were taken to a nearby forest and were poisoned with fumes on the way there.
How?
The exhaust pipes were fed to the inside of the vans.
- You have a lot of technical knowledge.
- I've learnt somehow.
- Has Father ever visited you here?
- Never.
This irrational madness seemed repulsive to him.
Live, my brother, you who are so much alive.
Do you remember me?
I am Ginger's friend.
I mean Olek's, your son.
He asked me to come here to say he is very busy.
He's doing nicely but not well enough to take you away from this place.
He's very ashamed that you have to stay here.
He asked me to tell you he is thinking about you all the time, and also to give you this little cross.
What are you doing?
You've frightened the old women.
You shouldn't be so violent.
You went to the Gestapo.
Why did they let you go twice?
I wasn't strong enough to give you to them instead of him. I turned back.
You should feel happy that I was so weak.
Sister, she is so uncannily like Helena.
She isn't like her at all.
It's only your imagination.
I lived here, didn't I?
When they took Helena's husband away, my sister found us shelter here.
Please go away and never come back.
The more silent he is, the more they beat him, but he is silent as he knows nothing about you.
Don't you understand that every minute
I stay with you is a sin against him?
Now I know what I must do.
Go away, please.
Is it his child?
Ours.
It's his, yours... and mine.
Why did you never come afterwards?
I didn't want to disturb you and him.
There is no me and him, only a shell, something terrible corroded from within.
Why?
Because you can do anything to anybody.
Only the flesh is sick and all round you...
What?
Pity, kindness and faith cease to exist when blood has been infected.
What does remain then?
Cruelty.
Before the war I studied law, but when war broke out it appeared I had no talents whatsoever, that I could do nothing.
I was happy to get a job at the insurance office.
- How old are you?
You'll perish if somebody doesn't put you right.
I'll give you a job which will be the best for you.
What will I have to do?
Nothing. Just be patient.
I can do that.
Will we be working together?
Yes. Only I'll be the breeder.
When war broke out my husband could do nothing either.
He tried to get a job at the post office.
I told him he should start feeding lice.
Before that happened
I thought I knew what love was.
What is love?
I don't know.
It is the opposite of cruelty, a total contempt for all that isn't love.
That sounds dreadful.
No. It just means taking off the shield, which in any case doesn't protect us.
To surrender yourself with the fear that you may be rejected.
That hurts.
Feel my heart.
I can't feel like a grown-up man with you.
I can't be close to you without suffering.
Marian!
Give me a letter of introduction to your breeder.
I'm going back to feeding.
I must get better ration cards.
- Marmalade, bread and flour.
- There is nobody you need them for.
Old man, it's now your turn to make a confession.
Have you seen a miracle?
You would say that miracles don't happen, wouldn't you, Marian?
You behave like... a wind. Those two worlds can't be measured by the same yardstick.
One is a reflection of the other and you yourself are the mirror.
You have the faith of a simpleton, no matter what you say.
Listen, only you can understand me.
I'm not able to provide for anybody in my present job.
Have you set up a family?
Yes. I've been blessed with one.
Do you realise how they infect us?
They fill themselves up with blood and then they eject it.
They vomit it into little wounds they have dug out and only then do they start sucking to the full.
This can't go on like that...
It's impossible.
There must be some law.
God.
It's time we talked with God.
A cry must burst out of this country's soul.
Some appeal, some waves, for if all this means nothing or only history,
- only a medieval darkness...
- Stop talking.
It means nothing.
The time that is to come will be a time of despair if the laws by which we're now governed become established.
It's a crippling thought to remember that the world was better at one time.
I'll give you a letter of introduction and you can start feeding again.
Who do you want to see?
Mrs Wisniowska, on the first floor.
I've come to see you.
Are things as bad as that with you?
Yes.
Do you know how many people try to get this job?
Yes, I know.
A slight temperature won't do them any harm.
In fact they like warm blood.
I'll give you a note for the doctor.
I've only just read your husband's book.
I wish you could tell him that it's a very beautiful book.
It's beautiful, it's old.
It's many years old.
My husband is dead.
Have you ever seen people dying of typhus?
Excuse me.
I'm going to register you as a patient.
And now I'll give you the first injection.
You'll be feverish for 24 hours.
I know.
You'll get the second injection in three days.
You'll then get the real vaccine, the illegal one.
Thank you.
I need two more vaccines for a woman and a child.
They should have come here.
As members of the feeder's family they're entitled to it.
All right.
Hide it, quick.
This is the professor's private stock.
Thank you.
Enter this man on the list.
It's the best job you can find, the best one.
Now when he's gone, his place is vacant.
I've brought food for her and the baby.
Could you give it to her?
I've put her in your old room.
No other accommodation is available in the house or the convent.
It's dry and warm there and if they look for her, it would be difficult to find her there.
Would you tell me, Sister, would you explain to me, but don't deceive me, does what has happened to me make any sense?
Does it have some meaning which I am unable to grasp?
Do you know what these old people are dying of?
Of hunger, of cold and of lack of food.
Do you know how they die?
Sister, I have now got good ration cards and food.
I can give you flour so you can eat your fill.
No, don't do that.
Go away please.
Sister, can't you see anything significant in her likeness to Helena?
It's just that you can see something which isn't there.
I've brought you some flour and potatoes.
You should eat well now.
I'll try to bring you something regularly.
I can leave the food at your door if you...
I've also brought a vaccine.
You touched my blood.
I was ill. My blood might have been infected.
I did it because I was frightened.
I'm scared of interrogations, of beatings,
I'm afraid I won't hold out, of that what they may do to him.
They'll let him out after a time.
After what time?
Your husband...
I would like to know who he was, what he did?
Before the war he wanted to be a lawyer.
He was a clerk at the district council for a year.
He started writing.
When I was pregnant he got a job here.
A good one?
It allowed us to live.
I also had a wife and a son and we also lived here.
Would you do me a favour?
Would you let me hold your child for a moment?
Who are you?
You lived at my place at one time.
You were giving me tuition in literature and I paid you with money.
Oh yes, I remember.
Later I let you dabble in trade, rather a poor kind of trade.
Better than nothing.
It gives me great pain to see you back here.
I thought you'd fared better in this world.
You see, a carpet is only an object, and so is a knick-knack or a pair of shoes.
I understood that you didn't want to pay with objects but with what you yourself had been created from.
What if I was unable to understand, to protect myself?
You want to talk to God on equal terms.
It's impossible.
You should only ask him silent questions.
I've brought you a prophecy... from your Bible.
I've marked it down, but don't read it now, only when I'm gone.
I've come to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Yes, because I'm going away.
Now? Where to?
The Germans give passports to wealthy people, so they can go to Switzerland on the sly.
But...
I've got one for myself and for my mother but I must leave everything I have behind.
That isn't so dreadful but the fact that I have to leave my son here...
I've got used to sneaking away and visiting him night after night.
I wanted to talk to you for the last time and somehow silence has descended upon us.
You see, I believe that my son will be waiting for me at the end of my road, just as I believe that you must find the woman you loved again.
Why are you still wearing a mask?
Because I'm afraid to look at my own face, because I'm afraid that the wind may blow me out like a candle just at the time of departure.
Goodbye, Mr Rozenkranc.
May the grace of God be with you.
"There appeared a wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet.
And she being with child cried, pained to be delivered.
And there appeared another wonder.
A dragon stood before the woman for to devour her child.
And there was a war in heaven.
Michal and his angels fought the dragon.
And the great dragon was cast out.
The woman was given wings
that she might fly to the wilderness
and be nourished
for a time and half a time.
And I stood upon the sand of the sea. "
I've come to you, to you...
You can't stay here.
I must go there to help them.
What about your husband?
Would you love me if I deceived him even one day more?
I never believed one might be fired with love so unexpectedly and with such terrific power.
I wasn't ready for it.
I was, well, a kind of student.
Father, what was my child like?
Silent or cheerful?
When Helena and I went out, at that time he was too small to stand in queues with us.
I used to put his hand on the arm of a chair and say, "Wait here."
And when we returned after several hours he was still standing there.
Lost in thought. What about?
Don't get annoyed.
And that man?
You've never told me about him.
I think that the feeding humiliated him, that he didn't, in fact, love anybody and yet every day he had to give his blood to something he hated more than anything else.
Later I saw him only once, from a window.
They took him away. I saw it.
The crowd drove me into a stairway.
- There was a round-up.
- Who?
Your husband.
- He's got good papers.
- I saw him tearing them up.
Why?
I don't know. Perhaps he couldn't bear it that you had left him.
Perhaps he loved you and everything you told me about him was a lie.
We must move from this place.
And you should never forget it's our child.
Ours. A feeder's job is now available.
If you want the child to stay alive you must take this job.
Immediately.
Why did he tear his papers up?
He didn't feed any longer at that time.
I understand that he roamed the streets with no job, that he seemed to be hungry and half mad.
And?
Before the war he was a physicist, apparently a very able one.
You see, he used to beat her.
He turned her out of the house.
She had nobody to turn to except me.
Tell me, my dear, what do you think was more important?
The force which drove that woman towards the fulfilment of her biological animal urge to procreate against all the odds?
Was this force more important than sacrificing herself for a man who lived at her side, who suffered, who thought, who loved and who needed her and who chose death when she left him?
Father, tell me, what is more important?
The things people sacrifice for each other or the things they share and want to save?
To save? Nothing can be saved.
The world has crumbled, has got smashed, has vanished.
You must fathom the new laws that govern this decay and adjust yourself to them.
That's why you acted in a correct but cruel way.
I can redeem anything I did, even the presence of our children in this world.
Hi.
Hello.
Good morning.
Good morning.
10,000. They're strong and healthy.
You'll feed them for half an hour until the breeding cycle is complete.
Then they'll be injected with typhus germs which will be bred in their intestines.
Later the intestines will be specially processed so as to obtain vaccine.
That's the best job you can get.
It provides you with papers which protect you against deportation, arrest and hunger.
It's a loathsome job.
The others who are here are in the same situation.
They would perish if they couldn't come here.
What's that?
Excrement of lice.
Every day I check it for bacteria and to find out whether your blood has not made them ill.
You shouldn't scratch yourself.
They die from it.
Somebody's selling all his books.
Yesterday I saw invaluable books in a second-hand bookshop.
- Works by Nietzsche, Céline, Spengler.
- What about Conrad?
- It's too late to read Spengler.
- It's too late to read.
I saw some beautiful volumes of the encyclopaedia, richly illustrated.
And nobody wanted to buy them?
Somebody will.
It's a time for intensive reading.
You're wrong.
Books are read out of derision.
I don't agree with you.
The fate of non-existent people has never been more important that it is now.
When Balzac was dying he summoned to his death bed a doctor he'd created himself.
When Proust was dying, he was worried about one of his secondary characters.
He scratched alterations with his nail on his blanket.
At the hour of his death this was more important to him than reality.
But neither Balzac nor Proust died of hunger or in a concentration camp.
Neither of them was rounded up like a dog in the streets.
That's why anything you write won't be a masterpiece.
One shouldn't write but look after children.
You're talking rot.
You'd better recite some poetry.
You, who know how to live...
My poem.
Not mine, my friend's.
Twice the moon his silver face had turned,
When I pitched the tents on the desert sand.
My wife with crying baby at her breast,
It's dead now, laid to rest.
- And sons and daughters did...
- Stop it!
Please stop this talk.
You'll make them ill with your chatter.
The injectors and controllers can tell if anything's wrong.
They're biting awfully today as if they hadn't eaten for weeks.
You're the worst feeders here.
You scratch yourselves when nobody is looking and drink vodka.
We lose at least one litre of blood at one go.
Shut up!
No talking while feeding.
Because the lice may get infected.
Do you remember how they took the professors away?
Scores of people were driven away in lorries.
Where to?
You see, only lice are important because they keep you alive.
You shouldn't harm or cheat them.
They're your mothers carrying death in their intestines and you are wet nurses to your own mothers, feeding them with death.
Your time is up.
You can take them off.
- You shouldn't come so late.
- I can still make it.
You're out of breath and sweating all over.
I've taken up my job again.
I can infect everybody here with typhus.
- They've been vaccinated.
- How?
Your vaccines are distributed to the doctors.
- How is she?
- She's well.
She's slowly beginning to forget about her husband.
Sister, you've never told me how she got here.
One of our sisters met her in the street, dragging her feet.
Do you remember which one?
I don't remember.
Why did you put her in my old room?
Won't you tell me?
"And there came an angel saying unto me, come hither.
I will show thee the judgment of the great whore with whom kings have committed fornication.
And all men were drunk with the wine of her fornication.
So he carried me to the wilderness.
And I saw a woman upon a scarlet beast, full of the names of blasphemy.
And the woman was arrayed in purple decked with gold, precious stones and gold, a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication.
Upon her forehead was a name:
Mystery."
You're deceiving me.
You know that feeding gives you a fever.
You know I can't find an answer myself.
You expect me to forget, to humiliate myself, to say:
"Unfathomable are the ways of God."
I only expect you to save...
Who? Her? Myself?
Your soul.
Have you been vaccinated as I asked?
It's important.
I've brought you some more ration cards.
What's the matter?
Tomorrow they'll offer you the infected ones.
It's a better and more stable job.
How do you know?
You've never done it before.
It was too awful for you.
Did my sister tell you this?
I must find him.
I'll look for him in the prisons.
I'm now strong enough to go out alone.
No, it's no use doing it until I learn everything.
When I'm looking at you,
I feel I've got another chance to experience what I've already experienced in a wrong way... and what I didn't understand well.
Love takes us unawares and slips through our fingers like sand.
Or perhaps...
Perhaps there was no love in me, back then.
I'm afraid of the strange circumstances in which we always seem to meet.
Oh merciful God, thou who knowest that we sin out of weakness.
God, who sendeth us the scourge of love in the time of plague.
God, who rules us blindly, don't leave us that we may not be lost in your wrath.
I didn't want to feed infected lice.
I was afraid they would do to me what they did to Helena's husband, that I would become a bad man.
Was it the lice who did it?
Or perhaps the lack of love between them?
What?
I'm feeding them well today.
My blood is feverish and they like it.
They get drunk and fall asleep in ecstasy.
Feverish blood has bubbles and it fizzes like champagne.
Are you feeling bad about it?
Do you understand what's happened?
This is only for you.
I always think about all of you.
There's no us any longer.
Time's up.
You may hand the cages back.
You've already had typhus so you're immune.
They need injectors in the contagious diseases section.
If you feed infected lice you'll get better ration cards, better pay and it will be regular.
You can take it up right away.
I'll set up a family too.
Better than yours, much better.
I'll take them tomorrow in exchange for your meat ration.
I've got plenty of blood.
We've been breeding the same family since 1918.
These are progeny of the original breeding couple.
Have you looked at them closely?
They're darker than the average ones.
Several years ago their vitality declined, so they were crossbred with Abyssinian lice.
Have you been an injector before?
I've already been everything in this process.
I've been here for only six weeks.
The professor brought my husband here from Poznan to save him from...
Death.
If we set them free they would die of hunger.
They're bred in a hot house and propagated in test tubes.
They've lost what people often lose - their instinct for self-preservation.
Between you and your child they are a kind of pump drawing fresh blood.
I haven't got a child now.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd set up a family again.
Don't touch me.
You're feeding infected ones now.
So? You've been vaccinated.
Look at your collar.
It isn't blood that makes this louse so red but germs.
It's been infected with Rickettsia and it's got fever.
Grizzly,
I must confess something to you.
You see, if they catch me,
I'd give everybody away.
I'd blow the whole institute to pieces.
I'd tell them that scientists are hidden here, that writers are feeding lice, that they should be deported.
You see, nothing in my family prepared me for this job.
My ancestors were thinkers, lawyers...
The lab assistants should sabotage it.
Vaccines should be made less effective.
The whole situation should be brought to a conclusion, should be stretched to the breaking point, so that not a trace of submission and baseness is left in us, even if this leads to mass arrests and torture.
Perhaps this extermination is like a plague, sent to make people realise the meaning of their lives.
I'll be trembling for you if ever anybody gets deep into your heart.
Would you do me a favour?
Wait at the bakery tonight.
Somebody's come to carry out a death sentence.
Hold a newspaper in your right hand.
Go there instead of me.
- Please...
- No one must see us talking.
But I must know the truth.
I saw you caught in a round-up.
You tore your papers up, so...
What of it?
You're surprised I'm alive? Are you?
I escaped.
You see...
I don't remember much.
It was your fault that she left you.
She said the lice had eaten you up from within.
But no, it couldn't be like that.
You must have been like that before.
I must know why all this turned you into a stone.
I don't feel guilty towards you any more.
Give my regards to Helena.
Helena is dead. My son, too.
I'm sorry.
What will you have?
Tea, please.
My husband's been taken to Germany for forced labour.
What time is your train?
Early morning.
There's a room here.
Won't you get some sleep?
I'm working till morning anyway.
Don't switch the light on.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I'm supposed to prepare here.
Hi.
Hello.
Blind, he has already come.
We know everything now.
Poor boy, he wasn't involved at all.
When they bring him to the cell after a beating he asks: "What for?"
He often says his wife's name, Marta.
There's no man strong enough to stand such a beating.
Yesterday he was taken to the hospital, ward number 14.
Perhaps the order I gave and the conclusion I arrived at couldn't be reasonably justified.
But I still think
I shouldn't lose sight of the paths that lead you and me and all those who've trusted me out of the darkness.
So, this innocent, unnecessary man, who is so like any one of us, only without a pistol, this... worm can be saved by us.
We've got a group to perform this task.
We'll get German uniforms, weapons and a car.
As you're the only one who has ever seen him,
I want you to be here at six in the morning.
How can I thank you?
You don't need to.
You see, it's not irrelevant whether I'm court-martialled for it.
But I'm at a loss myself.
I don't know, either.
It's very hard on me.
I'd like to defend myself against you and yours alike.
Grizzly...
I envy you.
I've refurnished the room.
Do you like it?
I've got some news for you.
Good?
Yes. Your husband is in hospital.
I know where.
They'll probably let him out tomorrow.
Let him out?
Yes.
I've got some bandages ready.
I must dress your wound.
No, it's not necessary. I'm all right now.
I hear of such terrible things and I can understand so little.
I wouldn't like us to flounder in this dung.
Did you want to have a child with Jan?
No.
Yes. I can't deceive you. I wanted it.
Oh, I hate this flat.
We should be in a quite different place.
But I'm afraid I can't provide for you.
Look, it's so hard to live anyway.
We won't survive if we have nobody to live for.
One shouldn't have children at a time like this.
If love is of paramount importance then a baby that is not yet born becomes the most important thing.
You mustn't come here.
I don't want you to see how you're both alike.
Everything happens in the same places and with the same words.
No, words are always new.
- I've been finding you again.
- Yes, in other people who aren't us.
I, who am leaving you, feel reconciled with you now.
Sister...
Sister, you need not go there.
But I want to.
Why?
Because in this way, brother,
I can ask a question and get an answer at the same time.
They're gone.
How quiet it is now.
- I must be going.
- Where to?
I must.
It's still too early for feeding.
- I'm going to my father because...
- You're lying.
- But I'll be back just before the feeding.
- I won't let you go, I won't!
- I can't be late.
- You must stay here for five minutes.
- Why?
- I don't know. I just want it.
- Are you crazy?
- I'm crazy, I'm crazy.
Don't go there.
Be careful, they've set a trap.
Father, where's the overcoat I left here?
As long as you live you can come and leave everything here.
Add yours to all these unnecessary things.
They've been collected by many generations, through fires, famines, invasions and wars.
All these objects, books and paintings - they are you.
Look, your left profile comes from your mother and the right from your father's side.
As long as you live, you can always come here.
Father, I've put you in danger by leaving this overcoat here. I'm sorry.
We'll go on sinking deeper and deeper.
Your grandfather spent half of his life on his own land, listening to the strikings of an imaginary clock that measured his time.
We were gentle in gentle times, and now...
Nothing's changed, Father.
There's blood on your overcoat.
I try to live at your side and to understand what you do.
What I must do, I must do myself.
There's a gun in your overcoat.
I wish you knew what it's like when your own child is bleeding.
I know it. I know it very well.
It's they who are unhappy, not us.
Let's play something together.
I can't.
I curse you and her and him.
All of you who are deserting me.
They've taken your daughter away too.
Those lice, son, you carry them everywhere.
And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven upon the earth and there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.
From the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
It was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing but only the men who have not the sign of God on their foreheads.
And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.
...and others.

Admiral Yamamoto, please.
He asked not to be disturbed.
- lt is most urgent.
Admiral Yamamoto?
Tokyo has been bombed.
- When?
10 minutes ago. Yokohama, Kawasaki and Yokosuka were also bombed.
His lmperial Majesty is unharmed. l personally phoned the palace.
Damage? - Very little to Tokyo.
No reports from the other cities, but it seems probable that they too were barely scratched.
How did they do it, Watanabe?
They launched long-range
B-25 bombers from their carriers.
They came in at treetop level, and were first seen over the city.
Tokyo ... bombed!
Sir, l understand your concern for the Emperor's safety, but ...
You may speak freely, Commander.
- This raid is a blessing in disguise.
The Americans have proven you correct.
Dur homeland is not invulnerable.
After today, the General Staff will certainly approve your operation M-l.
Lieutenant-Colonel Doolittle led the raid with a force of 16 B-25s and an all-volunteer crew of airmen.
Most of the planes carried
500-pound demolition bombs and single incendiary clusters, which were dropped on oil stores, factories and military sites in Tokyo.
A few planes made minor strikes on Kobe, Yokohama and Nagoya, with one bomb hitting the Japanese carrier Ryuko.
News of this raid has improved
American and allied morale, while at the same time constituting a blow to Japanese prestige.
Thanks, Sir.
At his press conference today,
President Roosevelt was asked:
''Can you tell us, where did those planes start from and go to?''
He replied:
''Yes, the time has come to tell you.
They came from our new secret base at Shangri-la ...''
Well, my God, it's Captain Garth! l was expecting some junior officer.
This is an unexpected honor!
Yeah, like hell it is, Joe!
Admiral Nimitz sent me over to ...
- To chew my ass off, huh?
Dfficially, l'm supposed to question your estimate of Japanese intentions.
Why so grim, Matt? Doolittle's attack should've thrilled you CinCPAC people.
Not by a long shot.
That damn raid could boomerang on us.
We only got 4 carriers in the Pacific. We need to rebuild.
Now the boss is afraid Yamamoto's going to jump back at us. But where?
We got the latest intercepts here.
Here's a list of Japanese ships we suspect will be assigned to amphib operations south of Rabaul.
The Coral Sea! That's where we think they'll strike next.
But something else is stirring, something out our way.
We need facts, not guesswork.
Matt, we cracked Yamamoto's code, but we can't just reel it off.
We get a flicker here and a glimmer there.
How much can you decipher?
- Hell, 15, maybe ...
Really decipher.
- Ten percent.
10 per ... That's one word in 10.
For Christ's sake, you're guessing!
We like to call it ''analysis''.
Alright. What are these indications that something's brewing out our way?
There's no hard clues yet.
- What do you have, Joe? lncreased radio traffic between
Yamamoto's commanders. - That's all?
Could be significant. At least l feel that something's stirring.
Alright, l'll take that list of Jap ships you ''feel'' are headed for Coral Sea.
Nimitz may send Fletcher's task force to see what's going on.
We'll see how your 10-percent guesswork pays off, huh?
As a back-room code-cracker l thank you, Matt.
Joe, could l ask you something very personal? - Certainly. lt really stinks down here.
How often do your people take a bath?
Bath? God, l don't know ...
What day is it?
Forget it, Joe.
Any new Yamamoto intercepts?
Here's a first mention of ''A-F'', whatever that means.
A-F?
Captain!
Tom!
Dad ...
My God, Tom.
When did you get in? l didn't know ...
Last night. - This is beautiful. Why didn't you write that you were coming? l've been assigned to Kaneohe.
- Well, l'll finally see some of you.
Three years!
You look great, Tom.
- So do you, Dad.
Kaneohe, are you? What squadron?
- VF-8.
You'll like it. Your C.D. used to be my wing-man on the old Langley.
Could we talk somewhere?
Sure ... Here. l phoned you from Guam the day you graduated.
Yeah, l heard later. l'm sorry l missed the call. l guess your mother was there?
Yeah.
- How is she?
Recovered from the divorce, l guess.
- That's good. l was hoping maybe we could ...
- Dad, l've fallen in love with a Japanese girl. l want to marry her. l need your help. l damn well guess you do, Tiger.
She's been arrested in Honolulu.
How did you manage that? ln San Diego and getting mixed up with a Japanese girl in Honolulu?
She was a student in San Diego.
- And she was arrested here?
Her parents live here. She wouldn't marry me without their permission.
Apparently, the FBl has something on her folks, so they got picked up.
Well, that figures.
Haruko was born here.
She's as loyal as you or me.
Anyway, the minute l got in l went to see where they're being held.
She wouldn't see me.
- Why not? l don't know.
She and her parents will be sent back to the mainland in a few days. lt sticks in your throat that l want to marry a Japanese girl?
Sticks in your ...? Don't give me that ''racial bigot'' crap. l don't care what color she is.
- lt's not the point ...
Christ almighty!
6 months after Pearl Harbor!
Boy, you have lousy timing.
What's her name? l'll see if l can get her FBl report. l wrote it down for you:
Haruko Sakura.
But promise one thing:
Don't do anything stupid till l see what l can get hold of.
That's a deal. ln my opinion, the plan is not only unnecessary, but doomed to fail.
Admiral Kondo, Dperation M-l was conceived by our best strategist.
We are aware of Captain Kuroshima's authorship and his reputation.
But this time, the god of operations has conceived a monster.
Would you please explain?
How am l expected to land my invasion forces on Midway, unless the enemy airfields and shore batteries have been neutralized?
Admiral Nagumo has said his carriers will obliterate the American defenses.
The enemy's land-based bombers have a range of 400 miles more than Nagumo's carrier planes.
His ships would be blown out of the sea before he launches his attack. l destroyed the US fleet at Hawaii, where the risk was far greater.
Where were the land-based bombers?
A surprise attack with a carrier task force is one thing.
But this, a strike against Midway and the Aleutians with 200 ships and 100,000 men.
Does the idea of taking the Aleutians cause you concern, Hosogaya?
No, Sir. But an operation so complex, l'd like more time to study it.
After all, in a matter of hours our Coral Sea operation begins.
We have sufficient forces for both. l tend to agree with Admirals Kondo and Hosogaya. l suggest we meet again after the Coral Sea campaign.
Very well.
- Gentlemen, consider this:
The Americans are still unprepared and outnumbered. lf their fleet can be lured into battle and defeated, they will have no significant naval force left in the Pacific.
They will have to sue for peace. l have traveled widely in America, my friends.
Their industrial might is awesome. l'm convinced our only hope of victory is one massive strike at Midway.
Joe, are you sure this
''hot information'' of yours can't wait? l already got one thing for the boss.
- l consider this urgent.
And, you were right about Coral Sea.
That's where the Japs were, alright.
Every ship on your list was there.
- Did we get hurt?
We got hurt.
Welcome on, Admiral.
How was your flight?
Long and full of potholes.
Got Fletcher's Coral Sea report?
- Right here, Sir.
Get in back, Joe.
But wait till l cue you in.
Here's Admiral Fletcher's preliminary report, Sir.
We lost the Lexington.
What about the enemy?
We sank one light carrier, one big first-line job and some small ships.
Looks like we just about broke even, Admiral.
We can't trade the Japanese carrier for carrier, Matt.
We started with a 3 to 1 superiority.
With the Lexington gone, the Saratoga laid up, all we've got is the Hornet, the Enterprise and the Yorktown.
Sir, Yorktown was heavily damaged at Coral Sea. There's the report.
Admiral, Commander Rochefort has something urgent, he says. lt's about objective A-F, the meaning of ''A-F''.
Dur listening posts pick up traffic between Yamamoto's flag commanders.
There's been a heavy traffic volume, with references to object ''A-F'' ...
... and A-D. A-D is a mystery, maybe a diversion.
But l think we've identified ''A-F''. lt's Midway. lt had us stymied until one of my men remembered an intercept from March.
A Jap reconnaissance pilot radioed his base that he's close to ''A-F''.
We plotted every course the plane could have have taken, and the only appreciable landmass he could have flown over was Midway.
Joe! - l know it's thin.
- Thin? Damn near invisible!
But l figured out a way to confirm it, Sir. lf you have this flown to Midway. lt's a fake message, Admiral, reporting that Midway's freshwater condenser's broken down. lt should be transmitted in the clear, so the Japanese get every word. lnstruct Midway to include this in their housekeeping traffic tomorrow.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Send this right away.
Hey, chief!
What's this?
There ain't nothin' wrong with our freshwater condenser!
Dombrowski, send it.
Damn heat's gettin' to everybody here.
Have this intercept coded and transmitted to fleet headquarters!
They took the bait, Admiral.
Rochefort just decoded a transmission from Kwajalein to Yamamoto's headquarters:
''A-F has trouble with its freshwater condenser.''
''A-F'' has to be Midway lsland.
Be at my office at 05:00, Matt. l'm calling in the whole staff.
This is how l expect the battle to develop:
The northern force, under Hosogaya, strikes the Aleutians as a diversion.
To keep Nimitz's attention away from our main objective.
He will not realize our objective is Midway until 24 hours later, when
Nagumo's carriers strike the island and destroy the American planes and shore batteries.
At that hour you move in,
Kondo, with your invasion forces.
Nimitz will be forced to respond.
He'll commit the balance of his fleet, most certainly his carriers, to repel the invasion.
His carrier commander will undoubtedly be Admiral Halsey. l have studied his tactics and l have studied the man.
Halsey is courageous, tough-minded and not afraid of risks, but we will turn these strengths against him. lt will take Halsey's task force at least 48 hours to reach Midway.
By that time, Nagumo, you'll have crushed Midway and be waiting for him.
You'll have a better position, and at least a 2-to-1 superiority in carriers, and 4 to 5 times the number of screening vessels.
Assuming the American fleet is still guarding Hawaii when we strike.
Nimitz is crippled and on the defensive.
He must deploy his remaining strength around his most valuable Pacific base. l agree with Admiral Nagumo.
We must make certain where the enemy fleet is. l propose we send 2 flying boats to French Frigate Shoals on the 29th.
We fuel them by tanker submarine and fly them to Pearl Harbor on the 30th.
They then report whether or not the American fleet is actually there.
A very wise precaution indeed.
We will call it ''Dperation K''.
Does anyone have any other thoughts?
Yes.
We can achieve a great victory, providing Nimitz and Halsey do exactly what you expect.
The Enterprise and the Hornet are due in by sundown.
The rest of the task force should be in by morning.
The Yorktown is more severely damaged than we thought.
How soon can we dry-dock her?
By the 17th, if a Jap sub doesn't spot the oil she's trailing.
Admiral Fletcher just radioed in with a repair list.
Tell the yard repairman l want every workman he can get to board her.
That sharpshooter from Washington just landed. Be here in 30 minutes.
Who did they send?
- Captain Vinton Maddox.
Maddox. He's a damned scalp hunter!
See that he's thoroughly briefed, and get Captain Garth up here.
Admiral, why don't you let me handle it?
No, he's entitled to a crack at me.
Phone that in.
Are those arming switches fixed?
- No, we still got some damn snafu.
Get them working 100% , or rip them out of all our SBDs. ls that clear?
Yes, Sir.
- Get to it.
Sorry to drag you out of bed so early, but it's our only chance to talk. lt's DK. Did you get the report?
- Yup. l've already read it.
Did you know your girl belonged to those
Japanese patriotic organizations? l saw the magazines, but l didn't know it was propaganda.
The Attorney General's office says it's subversive.
And the FBl doesn't think she's telling the truth about coming here.
You can't blame them for that.
- Sure l can! And l can clear it up!
You cool down and let me handle this!
Tom, l don't have time to fool around.
Do you want me to help you or not? l guess l have no alternative, do l, Sir? l guess you don't.
Captain Maddox, Admiral Nimitz.
- Great pleasure, Sir.
Should we get right to it, Captain?
- Certainly, Admiral. l'm sure you're aware of Washington's opinion on this Midway invasion.
Yes. They think it's an enemy ruse.
An elaborate phony, Sir.
- Go on.
Could we speak in private?
- lf you'd feel more comfortable.
These enemy radio intercepts your intelligence has accumulated ...
Very detailed ... - Too detailed.
Remember, just before December 7th?
The fake Japanese messages.
- These could be carbon copies.
Washington's sure Yamamoto's feeding you this to hide his plans.
Very definitely possible.
Well, then how can you insist ...
- Because l believe it's factual. l'm convinced
Yamamoto's target is Midway.
But if you're wrong, Admiral, if you send our carriers into a Japanese ambush, the entire West Coast and Hawaii will be open for invasion.
Fully aware of that, Captain.
You mean, the safe play is to defend the home folks first?
With respects, Admiral, it's the smart play.
Captain, if we surprise the enemy, catch him where he's not expecting us, we can drive him back 3,000 miles.
And keep him pinned till we can take him on in his own front yard.
My instructions were to convey Washington's deep concern over the safety of the West Coast and Hawaii. ls Washington ordering me to defend Hawaii or the West Coast?
No, Sir.
My orders were simply to consult.
No, Sir, l have no such orders for you.
Commander Blake, send the fleet to repel invasion. Target: Midway lsland. lssue the order immediately.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Admiral, may l see you a moment?
- Excuse me, Captain.
Damn. You know how
Bill Halsey hates hospitals.
Maybe it's nothing serious.
- To get him anywhere near a hospital it must be not only damn serious, it must be critical.
Admiral, l have some really bad news.
- Today's the day for it.
The Japanese changed the J-N 25 code, the one they used for Yamamoto's plan.
How long do you need for the new code?
- A month, maybe two.
Sir, do you still want that fleet order issued?
Yes. Target: Midway.
Welcome aboard your flagship, Admiral.
Thank you, Captain.
Rear Admiral Kusaka, my Chief of Staff. Captain Aoki.
Where's Commander Genda?
He's in sick bay, Admiral. lnfluenza.
When does the doctor think he can resume his duties? ln 2 or 3 days. l don't like beginning this operation without my best air commander.
We have another sick bay casualty:
Commander Fuchida has appendicitis.
Fuchida too?
We'll need a replacement.
Genda suggests a veteran torpedo pilot:
Lieutenant Tomonaga. lf Genda says so, l want to see Tomonaga right away.
Yes, Sir.
Fuchida, the man who led my first strike on Pearl Harbor, out.
Genda, who planned it, both ill.
Very bad luck, Sir, very bad luck.
Dnly an inconvenience, Sir.
We'll manage.
Good morning, Sir. - Lieutenant.
- Follow me, please.
Here we are. The Sakura family.
Yes. Thank you, Lieutenant. l can find my own way out.
Miss Sakura, l'm Captain Garth, Tom's father.
Please come in.
My parents, Tetsuro and Sada Sakura.
This is Captain Garth.
How do you do?
You want to speak to me in private.
My parents understand.
Yes. Well, thank you. lf l embarrassed you, forgive me, but l wanted you to see that they are not a threat to national security. l never really thought they would be, Miss Sakura. l suppose it goes with the times.
And l shouldn't be bitter? l never said that.
Damn it, l'm an American!
What makes us different from
German-Americans or ltalian-Americans?
Pearl Harbor, l guess.
Look, l've read the FBl report.
Ask me anything you want to.
Alright.
Your father has been seen frequently entering the Japanese consulate.
He has old friends there. l see.
What about these patriotic organizations you belong to?
My father enrolled me in those when l was born.
Dut of respect for him l never resigned, but l wasn't active. l see.
What about those magazines they found in your parents' apartment?
The ''Prairie Shimbun''?
Published in Wyoming.
My father has deep emotional ties for Japan, but even so he thought it was a ridiculous propaganda sheet.
Why did he subscribe?
He's a traditional and honorable man.
He was once indebted to the man who publishes the ''Prairie Shimbun''.
Look, Miss Sakura, l understand you came to Hawaii to ask your parents' permission to marry my son.
Yes, l did.
Why didn't you tell that to the FBl?
- l didn't want to implicate Tom.
Why won't you see him?
He's in love with you, he tells me.
You won't even talk to him.
He doesn't understand. l don't either.
Because my parents have forbidden me to marry outside my race. l want you to tell him for me. l can't tell him that.
He wouldn't believe me.
Besides, l'd just as soon he didn't know we'd talked together.
Look, Miss Sakura,
Haruko,
Tom's based at Kaneohe Naval Air Station.
Send for him, please.
You have to tell him this.
You have to tell him.
Damn itching is driving me crazy!
All those medics can do is smear this God-awful paste on it.
When they get the nerve to come near.
- l know l'm a bad patient.
But a skin disease! Df all the stupid, useless things to get laid up with! lt's driving me nuts. l can't even think! - We don't have much time.
Fletcher's docking the Yorktown now, and l've got hard decisions to make.
Recommend your replacement.
- Ray Spruance. l know he's junior to a lot of other flag officers, and never served a day on a carrier.
But Chet, he knows carrier tactics.
Well, you asked for my recommendation. l can just picture
Washington's reaction if l hand over the Hornet and the Enterprise to a cruiser skipper.
Especially with the static l'm getting for expecting the Japanese at Midway.
You told me once, Chet:
''When you're in command, command.''
Admiral Fletcher, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.
Welcome home, Jack. Congratulations on bringing your cripple in.
Well, we got lucky. - We haven't got much time, so l'll make this fast.
Halsey's beached, in the hospital.
Won't be leaving for a while. l'm sending you out again, Jack, in 72 hours. ln full combat readiness.
That's impossible! lt'll be 3 months before the Yorktown's in commission.
Spruance has replaced Halsey. He takes
Hornet and Enterprise to sea tomorrow.
You follow him 48 hours later.
Spruance is a cruiser commander!
- He knows carrier tactics.
Yeah, but he can't fly.
- Neither can you.
And he sure as hell can't learn it by tomorrow, can he?
No.
Congratulations, Ray.
- Well, l'm still in a state of shock.
Nice seeing you again, Matt.
How's the hand? - Coming fine, Sir.
We could have used you at Coral Sea.
He's on your Air Dperations staff on the Yorktown.
Good.
We face the biggest force the enemy has ever sortied, over 200 ships.
They've got 4-to-1 supremacy.
Yamamoto himself is commanding.
We know when and from where he's going to sail, we know their original courses.
We don't know their rendezvous point, course changes or when they'll strike.
They could hit from the northwest, but intelligence doesn't support that.
Ray, assuming this isn't just an elaborate ruse,
Washington thinks it is, but assuming they're wrong, what kind of move do you suggest?
Well, l'd take my carriers here, to a point northeast of Midway, and wait for Nagumo's carriers.
Why not head northwest and hit them head-on?
There's a chance
Washington may be right.
You think Hawaii and the West Coast could be the real target? lt doesn't really matter, provided l'm in a position to cut them off. lf it's Midway, l'll bushwhack them.
Alright. Jack, you're senior. You take command when you join up. - Yes, Sir.
The Yorktown will be at sea in less than 72 hours. l don't need to stress that Yamamoto outweighs us in every department.
Dur 3 carriers are all that stands between the enemy fleet and our coast.
Now, your point of rendezvous, what should we call it?
''Point Luck'', Sir.
Sounds like a prayer, but it's damned appropriate.
Son of a bitch!
Nurse!
Ray.
- Hi, Bill.
Wanted to call the nurse to have that tree cut down. lt spoils my view of the boatyard.
Feeling DK? l can't sleep. l can't eat. l just sit and scratch 24 hours a day.
You ever try an oatmeal and water bath? Don't. l want to thank you for recommending me to take your place. l have a question:
Did that itch go to your head?
Stop underestimating yourself.
Any skipper who can keep his cruisers and destroyers alongside my carriers across the whole
Pacific is the man for the job.
You know, you and l ...
Bill, we're kind of different.
You think l can do it as well as you? l can only tell you this, Ray:
You play it the way you feel it, not the way you think l'd play it.
You go to sea, find Yamamoto and chew his ass. Nothing more to it.
Christ, no! You want to catch this?
We'd lose the God-damned war!
Dh, by the way, l'll have somebody cut down that tree for you. - Yeah. ln carrying out the task assigned in Dp-Plan 29/ 42,
Enterprise and Hornet will act on the principle of calculated risk, which means avoiding exposure to attack by superior enemy forces without good prospect of inflicting greater damage to the enemy.
Sir, three boilers are out of commission.
The yard manager says he needs another two days.
Delaney, l expect the yard to finish the job by 06:00 tomorrow.
Sorry about your boiler, Jack.
But if you clear Pearl by 07:00 you'll rendezvous with Enterprise and Hornet on schedule.
Agreed.
- Good luck, good hunting. - Thanks.
You too, Matt. See you back here soon.
We just haven't any future, Tom. l figured that's what it was.
We don't.
We really don't. l wish you'd go now. l don't love you anymore. lt was a mistake.
Say it to my face. say it to my face, God damn it! lt'll be DK.
Shit. Wait and see!
1919, the Marines were practicing dive-bombing off Haiti.
Everybody said:
''Premature, wait and see.''
We waited, then the Germans showed us in '37 in Madrid.
You mean like at Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor, shit! ln '32 it was proved that Pearl Harbor could be attacked from the air.
And Admiral Ramsey predicted it would happen, in detail.
When was that?
- 1937, pal.
Wait and see. We waited.
December 7th, we saw.
The wait-and-seers will bust your ass every time. l'll drink to that.
- Bet your ...
How long have you been here?
- Long enough to hear your lecture.
You ought to go on the radio.
How the hell are you?
Alright ... Well, l'm celebrating my birthday. That's how l am.
That's a problem we all have once a year.
My God, now you got my kid flying for you.
How's the boy doing?
- Just fine.
He's a good pilot. Got him in an F4F.
He'll be shipping out any day.
Coming from you that means a lot.
No. He's good man, a natural pilot, good attitude, good marksman.
Tom's only deficiency would be in enemy identification.
He's got to learn, you don't win a war by kissing the enemy.
For Christ's sake ... - Well, he told the whole God-damned squadron. l met her. She seems like a nice girl.
- So is Madame Butterfly.
She's having trouble with him.
- Now you're having trouble seeing. l've got to shove off.
Scuttlebutt says you're going out on the Yorktown. - That's right.
Well, keep your dumb ass out of drafts. - That's right, buddy.
Thanks for keeping an eye on my boy. l appreciate it.
He'll be fine, Matt.
Tom! - Nice of you to take the time to see me off, Dad.
But your squadron isn't due to ship for a week. Why are you boarding?
Are you saying you're surprised, Sir?
Your buddy Jessop transferred me. l didn't know anything about it!
- Like hell you didn't!
You wanted me shipped out, to stop me from doing anything stupid!
So your old buddy Jessop obliged.
- Tom, l knew nothing about it! l have to report on board, Sir.
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE
DK, Sir.
Captain Garth is here, Sir.
- Great. Come in, Matt. How are you? l'm gonna do something l don't do, at least not since Annapolis. l'm gonna ask you to do me a favor.
- Ask away! Lord knows l owe you some.
This is an FBl enemy alien report.
- Where did you get this?
Don't ask.
Matt, l could find out.
- Don't, Harry.
The report contains all the bureau has on ... - A Japanese?
Dn an American citizen named Haruko Sakura und her parents.
They look DK to me, but l'm not in your business. lt sounds like you are.
Harry, l want you to investigate this personally.
They'll be sent to the mainland next week. lf they're clean, and l'm betting they are, l want that shipment cancelled.
Matt, you're way out of line here!
This isn't your department!
This is tampering!
Alright, what have we got?
What are these people to you?
Someday, the girl may be my daughter-in-law.
You're pressuring me to take improper action for personal reasons. lmproper action, hell!
They're no more a threat to national security than your pet Airedale. l'll have to report your request. lt'll go into your record. lt's not for me.
You know l wouldn't ask you for myself. l'm asking you for my kid.
Jesus Christ, Harry! l'm begging you!
Alright, l'll investigate it.
Thanks, Harry.
And, Captain, this'll wash it with us.
We're even.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Captain?
Thank you, Corporal.
Reporting as ordered, Sir.
Sorry to send the Marines after you, but you didn't answer my messages.
We had nothing to talk about, Captain.
You can cut out that midshipman-crap, you're talking to your old man. l'll try to remember it. l'd like to set the record straight:
Before we left Pearl, l personally vouched for Haruko and her parents, and went way out on a limb for them. l didn't know what weight it would carry, but you know, there it is.
Thanks.
Dne more thing: l didn't ask your C.D. to ship you out.
You spoke to him, didn't you?
- Yes, l did.
He asked me how l felt about ...
- Haruko and me, right? lf you couldn't do anything about it, why couldn't you leave it alone?
Jessop thought he was doing us both a favor. l did all l could, and a lot more than l should've.
You're paid to fly fighter planes, not to sit in your cabin and cry over your girl's picture.
You better shape up, Tiger, before a hot-shot Jap pilot flames your ass!
Just received this message, Sir.
Dperation K, the reconnaissance flight to Pearl Harbor, has been cancelled.
Cancelled? Why?
Dur scout planes couldn't refuel.
An enemy vessel was there.
Sir, Admiral Nagumo's carrier force should be warned immediately.
Admiral Nagumo must have picked up the transmission when we did.
Suppose he didn't.
He will assume the American carriers are at Pearl Harbor.
And that is where our latest intelligence reports place them.
What latest intelligence reports?
Have any of our submarines sighted the US fleet in the last 20 hours?
No, Sir. But there's no logical reason for them to move their carriers.
We must not break radio silence and risk letting them know our location.
The element of surprise is one of the most important aspects of our attack.
Admiral, this is our search plan.
An air search involving 22 PBYs, each plane flying 700 miles out, covering an 8-degree sector.
We'll have a 180-degree view at anything coming from the west, and still have a flanking area northeast of Midway for our carriers.
Have it put into operation right away.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Jesus, how many of those can you eat?
Admiral, air reconnaissance report.
No sightings. ls there any defense measure we've overlooked?
That had top priority, Admiral.
You sent everything we had: tanks, PT boats, anti-aircraft guns. lt's miserable waiting for an attack on your own people, hoping it happens.
More pressure from Washington?
- Not a whisper.
Frankly, l'd rather have them raising hell.
Captain.
- What's the count, Reid?
Half a dozen F4Fs and 15 Buffaloes.
Damned relics. - We'll show the Japs we're up here. Maybe we'll get lucky.
DK, Reid. ln less than 5 hours
Hosogaya will attack the Aleutians, and we will still be groping to Midway in this filthy squall.
We're not due to launch our first air strike for 36 hours.
Dur predictions are for clear weather before then, Admiral. l keep wondering what Dperation K uncovered at Pearl Harbor.
Were the American carriers there?
We've heard nothing from Yamamoto.
The American carriers must be there.
Damn communications blackout!
Hey, you guys!
The Japs are bombing Dutch Harbor!
Here we go.
Well, Gentlemen, it's started.
Signal Spruance.
The Aleutian lslands are being invaded, Admiral.
Washington could still be right. lt could be a feint for an attack on the West Coast or here in Hawaii.
Dr what we've defended against.
Today. Dur PBY should tell us today.
Hey, do you see what l see?
Damn right, l do!
Sparks, raise Midway.
Radio: Main body.
That's all? Just ''Main body''?
- Send it! - Yes, Sir.
An American PBY, Sir.
A reconnaissance seaplane!
Radio's picked up it's transmission. lt's alerting Midway.
Break radio silence.
Advise Admiral Yamamoto: lnvasion force has been discovered.
6 large ships in a column, bearing
262 degrees, distance 700 miles.
Admiral.
- You were right, it's Midway.
Enigma!
You know what l mean, Admiral.
- Fletcher's joined Spruance on time.
Another one from Strawberry-9, Sir.
11 ships, course 090, speed 19 knots.
Just what kind of ships?
First transmission said ''Main body'', but didn't mention carriers.
That PBY, Strawberry-9, was at the end of his 700-mile leg.
Nagumo's carriers could be following the large ships.
Maybe beyond his horizon. lf they are, Fletcher's too far north.
He has to move at top speed now to get within striking distance by sunset.
But if Nagumo's carriers are coming in behind the storm front ...
Fletcher'd be caught between two forces.
Yes, if we let him head for that main body sighting.
Send a flash message to Fletcher:
This is not, repeat, NDT main body.
Expect enemy carrier strike tomorrow behind storm front ...
... via northwest, as anticipated.
Signed, Nimitz.
CinCPAC must think the PBY sighted only Kondo's invasion force.
But if it's Nagumo's attack force with its carriers, and its scouts find us before we find them ...
Sound general quarters!
Weather is clearing, Admiral.
We could not have timed it better.
We intercepted a radio transmission from Tokyo to Admiral Yamamoto. lntelligence does not report any movement of the American fleet.
Whatever doubts we may have had ...
- They still are with me, Kusaka.
We have no definitive intelligence reports, only opinions and estimates.
And Yamamoto's silence does not make them a fact.
Admiral.
- Genda.
My apologies. l've been away from my duties much too long.
Genda, how are you? l'm well enough to take charge of air operations.
And so you shall, my friend.
Prepare an air search plan right away.
- For what area?
Where l would deploy my carriers if l were an American commander.
There, northeast of Midway.
Times like this,
Joe, l miss the flatlands. lt's a big body of water out there. l'm a fella from the Texas prairie.
Nearest lake was 120 miles away.
You could wade across it at the height of the rainy season.
During summer we made clay pots out of its bottom.
Whatever happens, Joe, you sure as hell earned your pay this month.
Well, thank you, Sir.
To cover the area, we will launch scout planes from Akagi and Kaga, and our cruiser escorts will launch 5 seaplanes.
Very good. And until our scouts have searched the area, we'll hold our most experienced pilots and half our aircraft in reserve.
But the American fleet can't be anywhere near Midway. We shouldn't hold back our best pilots.
We've been over this before.
Admiral, our first strike must be decisive. lf we don't destroy Midway's airstrip and planes, we invite a counterstrike.
Commander Genda? l agree with you, Sir.
Let our younger pilots fly the first strike. l am sure they can do the job. lf not, we can launch a second strike.
That is how it will be.
Suddenly, the man who led us to victory at Pearl Harbor is choked by caution.
He senses danger out there.
So do l.
Their transports wouldn't be so close if they didn't plan to invade soon.
CinCPAC's right.
They'll hit Midway today.
Yes, but from where?
He could pop out anywhere.
And then his scout planes will be out.
- We have to find him first. lf he hits our blind side ...
Why don't we get some eyes out there?
10 SBDs will cover our northern flank.
DK. But no more than 100 miles out. l want to recover them fast, in case the PBYs make contact first.
You DK?
- Yeah. - Here.
The poor bastards'll miss all the fun.
There's nothing north of us but ocean.
He gets his dope straight from Tokyo Rose. Right, Chili Bean?
Wrong, from here.
When it bristles there's Japs around.
You're crazy!
'Morning, Captain. - You're supposed to be sacked out. What're you doing?
We couldn't sleep. l know, but get below and try.
We got a heavy day ahead.
Yes, Sir.
Excellent weather forecast.
Broken cloud cover up to 2,000 feet to conceal us from enemy scout planes, and above unlimited visibility straight into Midway for our flyers.
Commence launching.
All our cruisers' scout planes are in the air, except one.
The Tone is having catapult problems.
A delay in launching scout 4.
- How long?
Half an hour, Sir. ln case the Americans suddenly appear, l suggest bringing the 2nd flight wave on deck as soon as the 1st is clear.
Armed with torpedoes to deal with enemy carriers? - Yes.
Dur planes and the Kaga's.
Soryu and Hiryu can stand by with bombs for Midway.
Give the order.
- Yes, Sir.
Now it's up to our strike leader.
Tomonaga is the best we've got.
Howie? lt's the whole damn Jap navy!
Radio, raise Midway.
Send: Enemy carriers.
We got 'em! lt's Jap fighter cover.
- Let's duck into the clouds.
''Enemy carriers''? That's all?
That's all Strawberry-5 said.
We haven't heard from him since. lf he was on course and on schedule, he made the contact about here,
250 miles out.
You better signal it to Spruance.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
You certain it was Strawberry-5?
Positive, Skipper.
How far are we from that contact point?
We're 15 minutes behind schedule.
Bandits! Sweet mother of God, hundreds! - Where, damn it?
Four ... no, five o'clock!
Jesus!
Billy, send this quick:
Many planes heading Midway.
Are you certain?
Alright, just let us know the second you get anything else.
Nothing more. No word from our scouts since that ''Many planes'' flash.
Yes, but was that from Strawberry-5?
- No call letters were sent.
Maybe he was jumped by enemy fighters.
Damn it! How many carriers?
What course? What speed?
Those Japs will never find us in this soup.
And we'll never find their carriers unless we break into the clear.
Damn it! l should've risked going straight in.
Nothin'. We've lost 'em!
Lieutenant, they're behind us! l see 2 carriers and a battleship.
Send it!
- Aye-aye, Sir.
''Fletcher to Spruance. Second sighting reported, Strawberry-5:
2 enemy carriers, battleship.
Bearing: Midway, 320 degrees.
Distance: 180 miles.
Course: 135 degrees.
Speed: 25 knots.''
Came right out of the slot where Nimitz figured.
''Proceed southwesterly, attack enemy carriers.
Will follow as soon as search planes recovered. Fletcher.''
Signal ''Ahoy'', Captain Browning.
To battle stations.
Get the control tower.
Andy, Major Parks get his fighters up?
All 23. The SBDs are ready to go.
Get 'em airborne.
- Yes, Sir.
Captain, we've got
Major Parks' frequency.
Rainbow Leader.
Below us, 10 o'clock. l see 'em, Kirk.
Alright, everybody.
Let's see how many we can drop on the first pass.
Two bogies under you!
Got one! Look at that Jap bastard!
Get him off me!
Dn your tail!
Comin' in on you! l'm hit, Rainbow Leader!
My God! Mayday, mayday!
Look out, Rainbow! Dn your tail!
Comin' in on you! Three of 'em!
Look at that Jap bastard!
My God, they got Major Parks!
Look out! Two bogies, four o'clock!
Rainbow Leader, come in!
This is Noah's Ark.
Report please!
What is your condition? Report!
Good God!
Give me the tower.
Andy, they blew right through Parks' fighters!
Get your people under shelter!
Jesus!
Come on!
Attack in squadron order!
God, they creamed us!
- But we're not out of action yet.
Dur landing strip's still operational.
Tomonaga is asking for a second strike.
Sir, this report is a great victory.
We've lost only 7 planes.
We've destroyed 40 enemy aircraft, in the air and on the ground.
But the pilots you chose did not destroy the airstrip.
We have 93 planes and our best pilots waiting on our flight decks.
The entire force should be sent now.
The entire force? Dur planes are armed with torpedoes on Genda's advice.
Hardly suitable for bombing an airstrip. Correct, Commander?
They should be immediately rearmed with bombs below deck.
We must make certain that Midway can mount no air attacks.
Lieutenant Tomonaga's request is also a warning.
Midway is still a threat to us.
So are the American carriers. lf they are nearby, yes.
But after 2 hours, our scouts have reported nothing.
You're forgetting, scout number 4 was a half-hour late taking off. lt will not reach it's maximum search range for another hour.
Tomonaga's planes will be returning soon.
They can be quickly refueled and rearmed for sea action. ln case our scouts sight any enemy ships.
Admiral?
Very well.
Drder our torpedo bombers to be rearmed with contact bombs.
As soon as they are ready, we will launch a 2nd strike on Midway.
57 planes on the line, Sir.
The Hornet will probably launch about the same number.
What's the enemy carriers' position?
- 135 miles, Sir. lf we launch immediately, do our pilots have enough fuel?
Yes, Sir. lf the weather holds, they navigate perfectly and aren't over the target too long. lf we launch now, we might catch Nagumo like a sitting duck. lf we wait, it will give him time to refuel and reload.
Sir, the PBY reported only 2 carriers. l know.
- lntelligence says he has 4. lf those other 2 suddenly pop up ...
- Then we'd be sitting ducks.
But we have 2 certain targets
135 miles away that don't expect it.
Let's get Enterprise and Hornet turned into the wind. lt's from Admiral Spruance.
Enterprise and Hornet are launching every aircraft they've got.
Air controller reports our strike force will be over the deck in 1 hour.
Just the time we need to finish arming our bombers for the 2nd strike.
Your confidence is most reassuring, Kusaka.
Dur scouts report no enemy carriers.
They've started their homeward leg.
All except scout number 4.
10 enemy ships sighted.
Bearing: 010 degrees. Distance: 240 miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.
Which scout radioed the contact?
- Number 4, Sir.
How far along are we on rearming?
- Almost half, Sir.
Drder it halted.
Radio scout 4 to ascertain ship types and maintain contact.
Friendlies, Sir.
Dur search planes returning.
They'll be on board in under 15 minutes.
Have Captain Buckmaster see to it.
Dur planes from Enterprise and Hornet should hit the Jap carriers in 1 hour.
They're not on the same course?
We're counting on it, Admiral.
Nagumo has to hold course until he recovers his planes.
240 degrees puts our people on him with unfueled aircraft on his decks. l don't see our fighters, Sir.
They should've caught up to us by now.
And where's Bombing 8?
With Fighting 8.
They took off together.
Ain't they supposed to be with us?
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3.
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3!
Either my compass is fouled up, or we're not heading 240.
There's nothing out there. l know where the Japs are, Mr. Gay.
Will you tell us, Sir? l figure they moved east since we launched, away from Midway.
Roger. - What good's our orders, if the skipper's gonna lead us off? l don't like it.
Take it easy. lf anybody can find the Japs,
Waldron can. He's part Sioux lndian!
Sir, another message from scout 4.
3 additional enemy ships sighted, 250 miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.
Apparently 2 cruisers, a carrier believed to be the Yorktown. lmpossible. The Yorktown was virtually destroyed at Coral Sea.
They can't have repaired her and brought her here in 10 days.
We must assume they have! lf it is it, we must destroy her at once. l see.
Suddenly, the threat from Midway's bombers seems less to you than when you urged me to rearm our planes with bombs!
Admiral, Midway must wait.
We should rearm our bombers and attack that carrier.
Back to torpedoes again?
More wasted time! - Tomonaga, this is Genda. Do you read me?
Lieutenant Tomonaga, this is Commander Genda.
Do you read me?
- l read you, Sir. - Report please.
Request permission to land. My pilots report almost empty fuel tanks.
Some have taken anti-aircraft hits.
Urgent we land immediately, Sir.
Do l have permission?
Admiral Yamaguchi advises that we attack the enemy carrier and launch our bombers at once, however they're armed.
While we're launching, Sir, Tomonaga's pilots will crash into the sea!
They're running out of fuel, Admiral.
Alright.
Wait until we've recovered all our airborne aircraft.
While they are landing on the deck, rearm our bomber with torpedoes.
Then we'll attack the enemy carrier.
That's the last of our scouts, Sir.
Tell Eliot to launch all we've got.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Pilots, man your planes!
Admiral, all aircraft now on board.
Tomonaga?
- He was the last to touch down. l want to close range on the enemy carrier. Steer northeast. Full speed!
From Admiral Nagumo:
''Enemy force composed of
1 carrier, 5 cruisers, 5 destroyers, sighted 250 miles from Midway.
We are headed for it.''
Dne carrier?
Close to Midway. Not Pearl Harbor!
Admiral Nagumo will simply destroy it a few days earlier than planned.
Dh, thanks, Matt. l'd give my retirement pay to know what Nagumo's doing.
The same thing we are, Admiral, sweating it out.
Skipper! l see it.
What'd l tell you, Huntington?
The skipper can smell them out.
See if you can raise Bombing 8 and Fighting 8. They must be near.
Better coordinate the attack.
- Yes, Sir.
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Do you read me?
DK, we can't wait all day.
You better get ready, Dobs.
Red Fox Leader to Kits, we're going in!
Divisions 2 and 4, take the carrier.
Divisions 1 and 3, ram the escorts.
And stay together as long as you can. l say again: stay in tight!
Admiral, enemy torpedo bombers off port quarter!
They're coming in without fighter protection.
Mindless suicide!
Perhaps.
But it's an effective technique.
We can't attack their carrier while we're busy dodging them.
They're using up all our fighters.
Bandits, 11 o'clock! Look out!
Two of them. Shoot, shoot!
This is Kit 6, l got 3 of them on my tail. Somebody help me!
Below you, bandits! No, no!
Dh God damn! No!
Stay in formation!
Get in. Close up, you idiots!
They'll jump us to pieces! l'm hit, l'm hit! Dh, Jesus!
Dobs, behind you! Bandits behind you!
Look out!
Huntington, coming in at 10 o'clock!
Huntington!
Huntington, are you dead?
Follow me.
Waldron, get your nose up!
Pull up, pull up!
What happened?
- Dne of our torpedo groups attacked.
Yeah, but which one?
What the hell happened?
Casualty report, Sir:
Dne of our fighters took a minor hit, no shipboard damage, no casualties.
A whole squadron. 15 brave crews.
Torpedo 3 going in at 1,500 feet.
Bombing 3 and Fighting 3 at 1,900.
15 minutes to target.
Who's coordinating the attack?
- Max Leslie. He's leading Bombing 3.
Helen Leader to Helen group:
Time to arm your bombs. l say again: Arm bombs!
God damn it!
Don't touch that damned electric arming switch!
Use manual control!
Too late, Commander. Mine dropped.
- Mine dropped too.
Rotten gadget! Who the hell invented the electric arming switch?
Yamamoto, who else? Now what?
Should we drop spitballs on the Japs?
Alright, knock it off.
The rest, use manual control!
Helen Leader, out.
Skipper, look at Chili Bean over here! l feel them!
Hope he's right.
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader,
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
Japs on the horizon! l got 3 ...
Sweet Jesus, l got 4 Jap carriers!
Holy hell, we hit the jackpot!
Yes, sky watch?
- Enemy torpedo planes! - How many?
Two separate groups.
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
How's about it? You boys ready?
Damn right, we're ready!
Let's go, we're running out of fuel!
Roger. Bertha 3 Leader to Small Fry:
Concentrate on the closest flattop.
Push in close and get hits! l count 12 coming in from starboard, Admiral.
14 from port side, Sir!
All these can't be from one carrier.
They must be coming from Midway.
- Dr a second carrier.
We've heard nothing from scout 4 since it sighted the one enemy carrier.
Soryu should send out its scout plane.
We must make certain of what we're up against.
See to it immediately.
- Yes, Sir.
Lining up to jump us, Thach.
About 12 Japs.
We're right above them.
Mabel 3 to Hustlers: Break 'em up!
Score 1 for Commander Thach!
Bogy! Comin' in on you, 3 of 'em!
That a boy, Tom!
Run that bastard into the drink!
Ramos, 2 o'clock!
Nice shootin' !
More comin' in at 1 o'clock!
You got him! Nice goin' !
Mabel 3 Leader to Hustler Tom:
3 bandits at 12 o'clock divin' on you!
Roll out, Tom! Dive, dive!
We've quashed all of their attacks, and not one torpedo has come close.
Sacrifice themselves like samurai, these Americans.
That last attack pulled our entire fighter cover down to sea level.
Now they're looking for survivors.
We have no fighter umbrella over us?
- No, Sir.
We're trying to recall them, get them back up to patrol altitude.
How many fighters are standing by to cover our attack on that carrier?
Barely enough to do the job.
They're American carriers, no doubt about it, Yorktown class.
Get through to Nagumo's flagship. Be quick!
Why are you waiting?
The transmitter isn't working.
We're not sending out any signal!
What's it look like down there?
A Jap destroyer!
Going someplace in one hell of a hurry.
DK, follow it. See where it leads us.
Commander McClusky, look at the fuel gauge. We have to turn back. l know, l know.
The last two attacks were made by over 50 torpedo planes. 50!
There is more than one enemy carrier nearby. There must be!
Admiral. - Genda, why hasn't the Soryu's scout plane reported?
We don't know. lt should have sighted the American ships 10 minutes ago.
Sir, all the bombers are rearmed and ready.
Signal all carriers:
Launch immediately!
There they are, dead ahead.
Sweet mother, look at them!
Huey, the whole Jap navy!
- Pipe down till l report contact!
Raven Leader to Mother Goose:
Have them in sight.
4 enemy carriers. l say again: 4 enemy carriers.
Helen Leader to Mabel and Bertha!
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!
This is Helen Leader. We have contact.
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel! l'm sorry, Commander Leslie,
Torpedo 3 and Fighting 3 don't answer.
Keep trying. We're supposed to coordinate our attack.
Either their navigation is fouled up or this is the wrong rendezvous point.
Keep trying, damn it!
Mabel Leader, come in!
Raven Leader to flock: They're turning into the wind, preparing to launch. l don't see any Jap fighters, Sir.
Let's not wait for 'em! Fall in! lt's no use. Commander Massey and Commander Thach don't answer.
DK, hang on. We're going in.
Sir, we don't have a bomb! - We can draw some heat off the guys that do.
This is Helen Leader. Concentrate on that big bastard up forward.
Commander McClusky, they've got bombs all over their flight deck!
Bull's eye!
Scratch one flattop! Caught him cold!
Raven Leader to Raven 6. l got a hit, Commander McClusky.
Bring it home, girls, bring it home!
Bull's eye!
Commander, l got a hit!
Look at that bastard burn!
Beautiful, Helen 3, dead center!
We caught 'em flat-footed!
No fighters and a deck full of bombs!
Sweet Mary, how did we get so lucky?
Helen Leader to squadron:
3 enemy carriers burning.
Time to go home.
Admiral, you must transfer your flag.
The cruiser Nagara is close by.
Advise Admiral Yamaguchi. l can't tell you where to find the enemy carriers, Lieutenant Kobayashi.
Their last position was radioed by scout 4 several hours ago.
Hasn't the Soryu scout reported, Sir?
- lt hasn't been heard from.
Then how do l find them, Sir?
- Fly to their last reported position.
Then just trust your luck that somehow you will find them.
Do you hear anything? - Nothing.
All enemy frequencies are silent.
Lieutenant, enemy planes!
- l see them.
Dur fighters are forming for an attack!
Signal them to lay back with us.
- Lay back ... - Stay off the radio!
We'll let them lead us to their carrier. l got all Max Leslie's bombers, Sir.
- Where's the rest of Thach's planes?
Dff the port quarter, Sir. l'll bring the fighters down first.
They'll be the lowest on fuel.
Jesus!
He's alive, Captain.
Flight Mission Combat!
- Go ahead.
Radar has more aircraft, bandits.
020 degrees, 30 miles and approaching.
Roger. Bandits, Sir.
020 degrees, approaching, 30 miles.
Sound general quarters!
We took a bomb hit to the side.
The boilers are out.
Admiral, the radio's down. We can't send visual signals in this smoke.
You better transfer the flag, Sir. l suggest to the Astoria.
Matt, you better stay aboard, help Murray with the flight ops.
Lower the barge.
- Have the Admiral's barge lowered!
This is Zephyr calling Whirlwind:
Enemy carrier on fire! l repeat: Enemy carrier on fire.
Returning to base.
That wasn't Kobayashi. - None of the senior officers survived.
The scout plane from the Soryu is approaching. His radio is out.
He's gonna be DK, Captain.
- We'll transfer him in half an hour.
Hi, Dad. l'll see you back at Pearl, Tom.
There's a picture of Haruko and me that l'd like you to bring ashore. l'll take care of it, Tiger.
Thanks, Dad.
Dnly 1 boiler in use, Sir. 5 are out.
- Can you get 'em on the line again?
Yes, Sir. l think l can guarantee you 15 knots in an hour.
Very good. Delaney, tell your gang the topside fires are under control.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Matt, we have more planes than pilots.
Can you fly one for me?
Sure.
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE
Did you confirm it?
- Yes, Sir. Fletcher's reply is here.
''Fletcher to Nimitz: Confirm
1st report, 3 enemy carriers afire.''
Hallelujah!
3 of their 1st-line carriers, Admiral! lsn't that worth a ''hot-diggity-damn''?
Good advice, Joe, but there's still that 4th enemy carrier to deal with.
A message from Captain Buckmaster:
The Yorktown's been hit.
Badly? - Yes, but she's underway.
- Dperational?
Dur whole force may be in jeopardy if the Japanese locate the Yorktown.
They still have a tremendous fleet.
But that 4th carrier can't be far off.
We've already won a great victory,
Admiral.
Maybe we should get our people back.
- Break off, run for home?
Before they can hurt us again? Yes.
That may be the smart play.
Trouble is: l want that 4th carrier!
What's wrong?
- Your right wing tank is punctured.
We haven't had time to repair it.
- ls the left tank fueled? - Yes, Sir.
A few hours ago we filled the sky with our planes.
Now we win or lose with 6 fighters and 10 torpedo planes.
The skipper wants to know, can you maintain this speed? - 18 knots.
Very good. - All we gotta do is find that 4th Jap flattop.
Bridge-phone, Combat.
- Go ahead, Combat.
Report from Scouting 5.
Adams located the 4th enemy flattop.
Good. Relay our position to Fletcher.
We found him, Delaney. Just give us all the old lady's got left.
Sir, radar has bandits.
Distance: 35 miles, closing.
They're coming in low.
- Torpedoes! - Sound general quarters!
Let's get everything airborne while we still can.
General quarters!
Man all battle stations!
Right 4 rudder!
- Aye-aye!
Watch out! Get down!
Whirlwind, this is Zephyr 3!
Two torpedoes hit the carrier! l repeat: Two torpedoes hit the carrier! Returning to base.
Now it's one against one, Admiral.
Congratulations.
Delaney, what's the situation below?
No good. All boilers are out.
Get your people topside, fast!
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Larry, radio Enterprise:
We'll land there after our bomb run.
Yes, Sir.
Blue Leader to all planes ...
How many are we sending out?
- 24 dive-bombers.
We'll have to try it without fighter protection.
What about the Hornet?
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel.
16 dive-bombers left, and Matt Garth is bringing 3 from the Yorktown.
Signal the Hornet:
We attack immediately. - Aye-aye, Sir.
That wasn't the carrier
Kobayashi dive-bombed.
She was undamaged.
We put 2 torpedoes into it.
Kobayashi said the carrier was on fire. Did you see any smoke?
No, Sir, it must have sunk.
We didn't see a 3rd carrier, either.
Dive alert! Enemy dive-bombers!
Sir, we must withdraw.
How will we apologize to His Majesty?
Leave that to me. l am the only one who must apologize to His Majesty.
Thank you.
That was the LSD, Sir.
Matt Garth is coming in.
His plane is all shot up. l wonder if Matt knew how big we won. l think l know what he'd have said:
''lt doesn't make any sense, Admiral.
Yamamoto had everything going for him, power, experience, confidence ...
Were we better than the Japanese, or just luckier?''
A son?
I have a son?
Eight pounds.
And Sunny? Is she all right?
Shall I make the announcement?
It's incredible.
I have a son.
He's not the first boy ever born, you know.
Does he have to be Alexis?
Can't we call him something else?
Alexis was a gentle czar.
Perhaps the only one.
Not counting you.
I thought we'd go on having girls forever.
I still can't believe...
Oh, you're dribbling.
Let me.
I prayed so hard.
I'm sure that's how it happened.
You heard him cry.
Not much.
I'll pinch him, shall I?
He's going to be enormous.
Even bigger than your father was.
We couldn't call him Alexander, could we?
He's asleep.
Undoubtedly, we've bored him.
Do you want him for a minute?
Not particularly.
I've had a son.
For years, I've daydreamed how I'd feel.
And all that time,
I never dreamed...
I'm filled with...
I don't know.
It isn't joy or anything like that.
It's more.
It's terribly important.
And I don't know why you're smiling.
Du bist ein Dummkopf.
Du auch.
Tegleva, if he wakes up hungry, bring him back.
Yes, Majesty.
At once, no matter what the time is.
The dispatches from Port Arthur.
They've been in for hours.
Can't that wait?
I wish it could.
The boy will bring us luck.
We'll smash the Japanese and drive them from Korea.
I have a son to fight for now.
We have a son.
If you don't get some rest, he'll starve.
Have I made you happy?
No, not much.
I think I like your gentle czar.
Let's call him Alexis.
I don't like entertaining with a war on.
Not right somehow.
So we've kept it small.
Just family.
I can't wait.
Good girl!
You'll make a partygoer yet.
See you in
Saint Petersburg tonight.
Come on now, Nicky.
All right, Uncle.
Who's the sober-looking fellow?
Gilliard, the new French tutor.
Can't you stay?
- We're seeing Witte.
- That man!
- He's a brilliant prime minister.
- I never liked him.
I'm the one he bellows at.
You shouldn't let him.
He's your servant.
Everyone's your servant.
You're too gentle.
You should slam your fist down as your father always did.
It's no use.
Frowning helps.
It's baby.
Did he have a good night?
Did he miss me?
Come look.
I haven't seen him since last night.
I think he's aged.
What's this?
Nothing.
Pull out or I'll not answer for it!
You must show me how you do that.
Have I Your Majesty's permission to review the facts again?
If Port Arthur falls...
No fact begins with "if."
Port Arthur has been under siege for six months.
It has cost us 30,000 dead.
A student stopped me in the street the other day.
"Excuse me, sir, but why are we at war?"
"Because, my boy, we want Korea...
...but the Japanese will insist on fighting us for it."
"Thank you, sir. But what does
Russia need Korea for?"
"Because, my boy, we have no ice-free port on the Pacific."
"I see. In that case, sir, it isn't good enough."
He's right, sir.
It's not good enough at all.
Imagine, sire.
Imagine that you are a factory worker.
You're really poor.
Your belly is never full.
You freeze eight months of the year.
Your children have no school, no doctor.
Your country taxes you...
...and sends your sons a continent away...
...to die on a piece of land on the Pacific.
Now, sir, Japan is a third-rate power.
If she defeats us...
...if Port Arthur falls...
...we shall be disgraced in the eyes of the world...
...and here at home we'll have an insurrection.
My people love me,
Sergei Julievitch.
They want a constitution...
...and the right to vote for an elected Duma.
They're angry...
...and they're serious.
Are you advising me to give my rights away?
I am advising you to stop a hopeless war.
Is it so hopeless, Nikolasha?
Well, Nicky...
...let me put it this way.
Here's a bullet, a bullet made in St. Petersburg.
I send it off to war.
How does it get there?
On a single spur of track...
...4000 miles long.
And in the middle, no track at all.
God help it, it spends three days packed on sleds.
And every boot, shell or pound of tea we send.
Get out now, Nicky...
...while there's time.
The Russia my father gave me never lost a war.
What shall I say to my son when the time comes?
That I had no pride?
That I was weak?
I've always thought...
...God meant me to rule.
He put me here.
He chose me, and whatever happens is His will.
We shall fight on to victory.
There will be no victory.
Only strikes and riots.
You must give your people a little of what they want, sir.
Not all...
...just a taste.
The English have a parliament.
Our British cousins gave their rights away.
The Habsburgs and the Hohenzollerns too.
The Romanovs will not.
What I was given...
...I will give my son.
These comrades want a larger movement that will embrace...
...all politically-minded people who can subscribe to a wider dogma.
They wish to join hands...
Excuse me.
May I?
This is my first conference.
- I've been in Siberia.
- So was I.
How long?
- I was sentenced to three years.
- So was I.
I only stayed for a month.
I made a run for it.
He wants to introduce himself.
Stalin.
I've inquired about you.
Trotsky.
You've been avoiding me.
How are you going to vote?
- Against your motion.
- You're a fool!
I'm sorry.
I can't always do what you tell me.
The Romanovs are crowing over their new heir and the Party's a mess.
- I'll win in spite of you.
- You'll split the Party.
I intend to.
It needs it.
Martov, will you vote for me?
No, against.
Come on, Martov.
He doesn't realize what you're doing.
I'm sure you're right.
Good.
So you're going to vote for me?
I would, but I'm not a delegate.
I can't vote.
Mr. Lenin.
Excuse me, Mr. Lenin.
I'm from the "Socialist Worker."
What do you think of the Socialist movement in England?
The English cut their meat wrong.
Their tea is terrible.
And the weather was better in Siberia.
But you keep your policemen under control.
The vote will now be taken.
Pay attention.
You're about to see the birth of the Bolshevik Party.
How do you spell that?
I'm going to vote.
Come on, Pankratov.
B-O-L-S...
Good night, Papa.
Good night, Mama.
Good night, darlings.
I wish we didn't have to go.
- It's Mama's birthday.
- Can't we say I have a headache?
You're just shy.
You're too old for that now.
You enjoy yourself at parties.
I get headaches.
If you sat there knowing everyone disliked you, feeling like a foreigner...
- No one dislikes you.
- Yes, they do.
You never see unpleasant things.
You drift away.
I wonder if you hear me half the time.
Just now I find you all too audible.
Guess what?
You've got your headache.
Mother, dear.
Not even London on a Sunday is as boring as a room full of Romanovs.
We see them rarely, Mama.
You see everyone rarely.
We'd see more of you if you traveled less.
Witte had tea with me today.
He talked about the war, like everyone else.
He ate all my sturgeon, but he never stopped talking, clever man!
- He thinks...
- I know what he thinks.
He thinks we can't afford wars.
It's too ambitious.
We're an 18th century country in a 20th century world.
We need all our strength and money to look after Russia.
Don't waste it on those little yellow Buddhists, or whatever they are.
It's a great mistake to get involved in all these strikes and wars.
You only encourage them by taking them seriously.
- Your father always said...
- Thank you for your kind advice.
I haven't finished yet, Nicky.
I know I'm not as clever as I pretend to be, but I'm sure of this:
Get out of Korea and forget about Japan.
I'm 36.
You must let me look after this war.
I'm going to see if Sunny is all right.
And I suppose everyone will be expecting me to dance.
Well, I mustn’t disappoint them.
I hope it's not too cold for you.
Can I get you some champagne?
Thank you.
Look. There's this fantastic holy fellow just arrived.
You must meet him.
He's a live, authentic starets, straight from the fields.
Cures diseases by the laying on of hands.
I've seen him do it.
Saw this fellow wheeled in...
...legs like pretzels.
Then the starets...
...Gregory Rasputin is his name...
...gave him a deep look...
...touched him...
...prayed a bit...
...and up the pretzel popped and skipped about the room.
A bit grotesquely, I admit...
...but you could tell he was skipping.
I'll send for him.
Must you?
Batushka Tsar.
Matushka.
Why are you afraid?
Why am I what?
I think you're frightened.
Strangers frighten you.
I knew a woman in Prokorvskoe...
...that's my home, a little village in Siberia.
And this woman...
...she was so afraid of strangers...
...that she bought herself a pinewood box and lived in it.
Then one day...
...her husband nailed the lid on...
...dug a hole...
...and dropped her into it.
"Ivan, don't!" she cried.
"But I only want to make you happy," he said.
"I know. But Heavers full of strangers. Let me out!"
Damned barn of a place.
Like an icehouse.
Never could stand marble.
It gives you rheumatism.
Have a drink.
Quite right.
Have some of this vodka.
Keep you warm.
You know, I want to sell this place or give it away.
But no one will be fool enough to take it.
God bless.
I started late to be a starets.
I was 20 when this vision came.
We peasants get them all the time.
The Virgin comes and tells them...
...when to sell their sheep if they want to make a profit.
She told me to become a pilgrim.
So I started to walk.
I waited for her to tell me when to stop, but she didn't.
I walked 2000 miles...
...and when I got to Greece...
...I couldn't walk any further.
So I stopped.
I spent two years in a monastery...
...and then I walked home again.
Sometimes people say to me...
..."What do I need to become a starets?"
And I say, "Good feet."
Father Gregory...
...do you have visions?
Sometimes.
Why does God send them to you?
God knows. I don't.
I used to be a Lutheran.
They take God very seriously.
I take Him as
He comes, Matushka.
When it pleases Him, He uses me.
You mean He actually appears?
You see Him?
What's a vision like?
Sometimes it's voices.
Other times, I'm not sure what I see.
I know exactly what you mean.
It happens to me sometimes when I pray...
...especially late at night.
The candles flicker and it's dark...
...and out of the corner of my eye, I think I see...
I don't know what.
And when I turn to look, it's gone.
You missed the ballet.
It was lovely.
We can leave now, if you like.
Already?
But we haven't danced yet.
May I say something intimate?
In public?
I'll whisper it.
Well, if you must.
I adore you.
I had such a lovely time.
And Father Gregory, I thought he was delightful, didn't you?
An interesting fellow, I suppose.
They tell me in Siberia the woods are full of them.
The Tsarevitch's bruise worried me.
I made some tests.
I wasn't sure.
I'm not a specialist.
But I'm afraid these gentleman concur.
There is no doubt of it?
No doubt of any kind?
It is unquestionably hemophilia.
I see.
Excuse me, but it takes a moment to absorb.
And what's the treatment?
Nothing, sire.
That's not possible.
There must be medicines.
There are no medicines.
Nothing at all?
I see.
The female is the carrier.
The mother gives it to the son.
Your mother got it from her mother, Queen Victoria...
...and passed it on to you.
It strikes some males and misses others.
Of Victoria's four sons, just one had hemophilia.
And just one of mine.
Some hemophiliacs grow up to lead...
...quite long and normal lives.
And some do not.
The chemical that makes the blood clot is missing.
When he cuts himself, he bleeds extensively.
Then we'll see to it that Alexis does not cut himself.
It's more than that.
A surface wound...
Let me.
They tell me cuts don't matter much.
They tell me if Alexis cuts his hand, they tie it very tight...
...and after a little while the bleeding stops.
It's when he bleeds inside...
Inside?
They tell me any bump can make him bleed inside.
One never knows.
An awful blow may do no harm at all...
...and then again, a tiny tap and it begins.
They tell me the blood seeps slowly, sometimes going on for days.
They tell me the area begins to swell, fills up like a balloon...
...until the pressure is so great the bleeding stops.
Then, while the swelling lasts, the blood attacks the bone...
It can leave a limb all bent and twisted.
While this is going on, there's nothing they can do.
That's what they tell me.
Tell them...
Tell them they are mistaken.
Tell them we shall go to other doctors.
Tell them to get out.
My son is perfect.
He will have a long life...
...and grow up to be a great Tsar...
...like his father.
More troops! He's going to send more men to die!
Port Arthur falls and
Nicholas is sending more men!
I say we students...
...lead the way!
I say we give him a Port Arthur here!
I say we mobilize...
They're coming for us!
Now, do we run or do we fight?
We fight!
This way, Father! Hurry!
It's all over, Petya.
She's dead.
She lived her life here in this place.
She got married.
I was born. Father died.
My eldest son is playing...
...here in this place...
...and they go on working.
Why not? They have to live.
I work when they die.
Let me hold him.
I want to kill somebody.
They come here sometimes...
...the other factory workers...
...and they tell us...
...that we should burn things down.
Make bombs.
Well, I want to fight back...
...once!
All violence begets is violence.
They'll beat you.
There's a better way.
We are going to see the Tsar.
You know what they say, Father:
God is too high and the Tsar's too far away.
The Tsar is here in Petersburg to bless the troops.
He's staying at the Winter Palace.
Thousands of us will march there on Sunday morning.
I'll go to him on the balcony...
...and read this:
"Sire...
...we working men and inhabitants of St. Petersburg...
...come to you, sire, to seek...
...for truth, justice and protection.
Only you can hear our prayers.
And if you do not...
...we shall die...
...here on this square...
...before your palace."
God is with you.
St. George will guard you.
St. George will guard you.
Batushka Tsar.
Come on, my friend.
Stand up.
It's beautiful to watch them.
Bless you.
We must get back to Tsarkoe Selo.
I've ordered the train already and I'll cancel all the engagements.
Vladimir, what is it?
A message from Botkin.
The Tsarevitch is bleeding.
Oh, my God!
How long before our train comes?
I don't know.
Perhaps half an hour.
I want to go.
We will. We will.
Now! Nicky, take me home.
The train's the fastest way.
We must wait.
I can't! My baby's bleeding.
I'm in Petersburg.
He needs me. Half an hour!
God, save my little boy!
Sunny, stop!
Take me away.
I want my baby. Let me go!
You bless them.
Think of the soldiers.
Think of the war, the weather.
Think of anything, but not baby.
I can't!
Do it.
God is good.
Believe in His mercy.
He will not punish the pure in heart.
Believe in His mercy.
Well...
What if the bleeding doesn't stop?
It must.
Botkin doesn't think Alexis will...
Die.
Thank God.
It isn't much to thank Him for.
Botkin said...
What do doctors know?
They're useless.
It's in God's hands.
Submit, submit!
You should have been a monk.
Won't you ever fight?
I can't fight you.
My baby's dying.
There are no medicines.
Christ Jesus!
Don't come near me.
Matushka.
I can't seem to get them right.
Matushka, tell me what it is.
I keep thinking the arrangement matters.
I can't even remember which saints they are.
It doesn't matter.
They know you.
I knew all their names once.
I had to.
To marry Nicky,
I had to change my faith.
That was a great sin, don't you think?
God thinks so.
He won't hear me when I pray.
I've sinned...
...and he won't listen.
All saints were sinners once.
God loves sinners.
Then why is he killing my baby?
We had a man in Prokorvskoe.
He didn't wash or work.
He lied, stole, cheated, drank...
...chased all the women.
He was a sinner.
Why, out of all men, did the Virgin come to him?
Perhaps he lied.
You said he was a liar.
She came.
I saw her.
I know all there is to know about sin.
Pray with me, Matushka.
God is here.
I can't.
That's my punishment.
I shouldn't have sent for you.
I don't know you at all.
If baby wakes, he'll need me.
Goodbye.
The child will die...
...if you don't get down on your knees and beg for his life...
...like a peasant begging for crusts at your door.
You will be taken back to St. Petersburg.
Wait outside.
I knew you were going to send for me.
I knew the child was sick.
I know what's the matter with him.
You can't!
I see blood when
I shut my eyes.
A lot of blood.
I saw blood once before...
...when I was in Jerusalem.
And then my father died.
In Kazan, there's an ivory Christ, and the wounds bleed.
Someone told me there's a Madonna in Kharkov that sheds real tears.
Matushka.
I see things.
I have power!
I cure the sick.
Holy men kneel to me and kiss my hands.
I am a vessel of the Lord.
I have spoken with God.
It must be so.
How else can I do these things?
I save souls and bring peace.
God leads me.
He brought me here.
He speaks through me.
I am the voice of God.
It is His will.
I have been sent
to do great things.
Your Majesty.
Baby's better.
Go back!
Stop!
We come in peace!
We come to see our Tsar!
We come in peace!
Go back!
We come to see our father!
Peace! Peace!
High angle!
Fire!
Slaughtered like cattle!
He didn't come.
He never came.
Nicholas, the murderer.
The bloody, bloody murderer.
Mama!
- Why wasn't I told?
- Your Majesty.
Who gave the order?
How did it happen?
- Why wasn't I told?
- As I understand it...
How many dead?
Who ordered the shooting?
Hundreds of bodies.
Nobody ordered it.
Someone's responsible.
You run this government.
This came last night.
It reads:
"Sire, we working men..."
Answer me!
How many were killed?
I don't know yet, certainly hundreds.
Why wasn't I told they were marching?
- Would you have met them?
- How could I?
Would you have given them a Duma?
Elections? Schools?
Why bother to inform you?
You wouldn't have done anything!
- I want a good life for my people.
- On your terms.
I know what will make them happy.
They're children and they need a Tsar.
They need tradition, not this.
They're the victims of agitators.
A Duma would make them bewildered and discontented.
And don't tell me about London and Berlin!
God save us from the mess they're in.
I see.
So, they talk, pray, march, plead...
...petition and what do they get?
Cossacks, prison, flogging, police!
And now, after today, they will be shot!
Is this God's will?
Are these His methods?
Make war on your own people.
How long do you think they'll stand and let you shoot them?
You ask me who's responsible!
You ask!
Russia will explode!
A massacre in Petersburg!
Now the Japanese have forced Nicholas to accept peace on their terms.
He's lost the war!
Thousands of soldiers killed, and all for nothing.
This time Nicholas has destroyed himself.
I'm going to Petersburg!
But you'll need bombs and explosives and ammunition.
They can be smuggled in, Leon.
For God's sake, don't discuss that with her!
She probably thinks you can wheel machine guns...
...across the frontier in a baby carriage.
Who wrote this extraordinary rubbish?
You're not going to print it?
I was going to speak to you about it first.
This must be some of your nonsense, Trotsky.
"Lenin's theory comes to this:
The Party decides what the people think.
An elite decides what the Party thinks.
The Central Committee decides what the elite thinks.
And Lenin decides what they all think."
You will print it?
I can't.
The style's atrocious.
I'll never understand you.
You hate anyone who's not your kind of Bolshevik...
...more than you hate the Tsar.
No wonder they call you Robespierre.
Everybody's got to think like you or they're out.
He thinks freedom is something you write on a wall but don't practice.
That's not true.
Of course I agree you're free to say what you like.
You must agree I'm free to shoot you for saying it.
Murder, arson, terror.
I'll agree to anything that gives us power.
Power!
And we can't have power if we compromise.
Even though it takes years.
Terror and power!
Be careful!
Are you all right, Alexei?
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run and mustn’t play!
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.
Must be careful all the time.
You must try to understand.
Your mother worries.
We both do.
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run...
...and mustn’t play!
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.
Must be careful all the time.
I found some mushrooms.
Father wouldn't let me pick them.
He said they were poisonous.
They were green.
I'm hungry.
All you ever serve is bread and butter.
It's tradition.
I'll do better in the kitchen.
Nagorny, don't let him run too fast!
He's always happy here at Livadia.
The Crimea's good for him.
It's good for all of us.
- Some tea?
- One cup.
Before Stolypin comes,
I'd like to play a little tennis.
We have so few days here.
Can't your ministers leave us alone?
You used to like him.
For my sake, be as gracious as you can.
He's not a good man.
He's against us.
Nonsense.
He's a great prime minister.
I sent Father Gregory to see him.
You sent Rasputin?
What in God's name for?
Our friend reads people's hearts.
He knows who loves us and who doesn't.
He can tell.
Stolypin is a bad man.
In future, may I ask you, please...
I don't care if he talks to God or not...
...Rasputin is a peasant!
Is my judgment so inadequate?
Am I too dense to tell a statesman when I see one?
What on earth...
Stolypin, you look terrible.
Here's what we'll do.
Peter Arkadiavitch!
Only you could wear a briefcase with a bathing suit.
I think I'd feel naked without it.
Besides, I must have somewhere to put my lifebelt.
What you've done for Russia since
Witte's retirement is a miracle.
Or a mirage.
Russia's too large.
It's impossible to govern.
I'm not what holds it all together.
You are.
Which is why the Tercentenary next month is so important to us.
Final schedule is pending your approval.
I'm afraid the tour is long and taxing.
But it's critical that people...
...feel the dynasty is permanent and strong.
Three hundred years of Romanovs.
That fact is vital to us.
- It implies, first of all...
- Come on, Peter.
Out with it.
We leave for Petersburg tomorrow.
What's so urgent that it brings you all this way?
One finds these everywhere.
All over Petersburg.
The printing is poor...
...but the thought is clear.
What's wrong with the Okrana?
Can't 10,000 secret agents find a printing press?
They can't find all of them.
I want it stopped.
It's too late. They plan to debate it in the Duma.
Damn the Duma!
Witte's work.
He made me give it to the people.
Close it. Shut it down.
I don't like the Duma any more than you do.
But I'd rather they talk than riot, strike and march.
Better to give them more power than face that.
I am the Tsar.
And I would never accept that.
Police reports...
...on Gregory Efimovitch Rasputin.
Drunk half the time.
Whores, generals' wives...
He's generous with himself.
I'll say that.
That's his only Christian virtue.
He'll sleep with anyone.
It's no secret, everybody knows it.
He came to see me.
Apparently with
Her Majesty's blessing.
He even tried to hypnotize me.
Why is such a man admitted to the palace?
- You know why.
- Your people don't.
I'll tell them, shall I?
Citizens, your Tsarevitch could get a bloody nose and die from it.
You must send him away from Petersburg.
How can I?
People think he violates your daughters and wife!
Get him out! I can't control the situation if you don't.
And if I do?
What happens if...
Your Highness!
It's all right, Nagorny.
You'll always save me.
It's all Nagorny's fault.
Botkin warned us Alexis would behave like this.
It's a typical reaction.
It's even got a name.
I don't care.
A sailor for a nurse.
It's an absurd idea.
It's mine.
I still say Alexei needs a nurse.
He needs the company of men.
Does he?
He's with you all day long.
You hardly ever come to meals.
I never seem to see you anymore.
My place is where I'm needed most.
It must be hard to have so many people need you.
I'll be patient.
If I wait, my turn will come.
What a mess I make of things.
I meant to look so nice for you.
I meant our last night in Livadia to be beautiful.
Sometimes I wonder how you live with me.
I wonder too.
Only I know I could never live without you.
My decision stands.
I've seen you out of courtesy.
- If you've come here to plead...
- I came to say goodbye.
I'm going home.
I don't like St. Petersburg.
It makes me drink too much.
And when I drink...
...the women come.
The women here are worse than the peasants in my village.
They've no restraint.
Is Matushka angry with me?
She won't admit you even take a drink, much less...
No.
She believes in you completely.
She is a saint.
Matushka...
...if you need me while I am gone...
...pretend I'm with you.
Say the things that trouble you, as you always do, and it will help.
I only sit and listen anyway.
The voice of God is in you...
...and no harm will come.
It was necessary.
Why?
Stolypin recommended it.
Our friend warned me he was bad.
Rasputin drinks, takes bribes.
He is an adulterer.
He is a saint.
Little men always abuse them.
I can show you the police reports.
More little men.
People say he sleeps with you.
What do I care what people think?
I have to care!
I want him.
- Bring him back.
- I can't.
- Can't you do anything?
- I am.
I'm standing up to you for once.
Who's going to save Alexei?
We have doctors.
Damn your doctors!
What about my son?
I've other important things to answer for.
I don't.
Give me Rasputin back!
No, I will not.
If baby dies, you murdered him!
I didn't give him hemophilia.
Murderer!
- I'll never forgive you.
- You gave it to him! It was you!
Don't you think I know it?
When I see him bleed...
...I think I did it...
...as if I'd put a knife in him.
I've tried to make up for it.
I've seen so many specialists and doctors and surgeons.
Sometimes I did not tell you.
I know most of them were quacks...
...but I still tried.
I have spent nights on my knees...
...praying.
And Rasputin's the only one...
...who has helped me bear my punishment.
That's why I cling to this common peasant from Siberia.
They laugh at me in the streets.
You have turned against me.
But I cannot help it.
It's me.
Whatever happens, I deserve it.
It's my punishment.
It's mine.
Stalin's been sentenced to Siberia again.
What else?
The Okrana's infiltrated our cells in Moscow.
They found all our explosives in Minsk.
Perhaps I should go back to Petersburg.
You didn't do much good last time.
What else is happening?
Not much. Not since Rasputin went back to Siberia.
Yes, it's a pity.
He can't cause much trouble there.
He was worth more than an army of Bolsheviks in Petersburg.
They've arrested
Sverdilov in Kiev.
Spies everywhere.
No one trusts anyone.
Some of our party leaders work for the Okrana.
I see you were in the Minsk group when it was raided.
You got away?
I managed to hide.
And all the others were caught?
You got somewhere to live?
Not five minutes away from here.
Good.
Thank you for bringing the message.
Come and see us again soon.
And don't drink.
Too many of our men take to drink in Paris.
If Sverdilov's been arrested...
He's a double agent.
He works for the Okrana.
Go home.
I don't feel like talking tonight.
I've got nothing to say.
We've got old.
They've gone?
I'll get your supper.
That's all right.
There's no hurry.
In the last ten years,
I've spent...
...three months in Russia.
I'm out of fashion.
No one's wearing me this year.
I talk...
...and no one listens.
I write...
...and no one reads.
Think what we'll be like in 10 or 15 years.
Emigrés go off their heads in the end, you know.
Mad, old cranks with no money, no country...
...always worrying about the laundry...
...complaining when the mail's late.
Being ill in charity hospitals and buried with the paupers.
No, Ilyich.
It won't be like that.
Three hundred years of Romanovs?
Why not 300 more?
Long live the Romanovs!
Three hundred years!
Come on! Come on!
I didn't want to come on this
Tercentenary tour, Peter Arkadiavitch.
But, God help me, I do love it when they stand and wave.
He's shot!
Guards! Guards!
For God's sake, hurry!
What's to be done?
Is he dead?
No.
There's a lot of blood, pain.
The doctors are with him.
Good.
He's a good man.
They always kill the good men.
The ones who help them most.
They killed my grandfather.
He freed the serfs, you know.
He helped them.
So they threw a bomb.
Stolypin's a good man.
I can't find a match.
They've got the man who shot him.
The man?
Some kind of revolutionary.
Damn them all.
You help them and they kill you for it.
Give them Dumas and they give you bombs.
I want them paid in kind.
You understand me?
I want something done!
You bastard!
This is our home!
Not anymore!
We live here!
Arrest him.
Tell the Tsar that he can close this building...
...but the Duma won't be closed.
That's enough, Mr. Kerensky.
No, it's not, Mr. Prime Minister.
You cannot repress this body and you cannot repress the people.
That's the road to revolution.
We're not revolutionaries here.
Most of us want a system like the British.
Let there be a Tsar...
...but let there be a parliament with rights and powers.
We won't be denied,
Mr. Kokovtsov.
This government deplores brutality and violence.
But when dissent gets out of hand...
...when opposition ceases to be peaceful...
...law and order must and will be kept.
Not at this price!
The Duma is not a street corner.
There is no violence here.
But even we are not free to speak.
Where is the Tsar?
The Tsar is at the hunting lodge in Poland.
I don't care if he's in Scotland shooting grouse!
Find him and tell him he's bringing ruin on his head!
Tell him while there's still a Tsar to tell!
You all right?
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run and mustn’t play!
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.
- You must be more careful.
- It was nothing.
I will run away and be an actress when I grow up.
It's my destiny.
Once you've felt the call of the stage, you know.
It's in your blood.
A princess can't be an actress.
You may well say you want to be a trollop.
What's a trollop?
Trollop.
Yes, that sounds nice.
Perhaps I'll be a trollop instead.
Monsieur Gilliard, what's French for trollop?
I'll marry a prince and have eight children.
Ten, if he's really nice.
How many will you have, Olga?
What's the use in daydreaming?
I should like to be a teacher when I grow up.
Teaching is such a noble profession.
That's Monsieur Gilliard!
Do you think I've caught his eyes?
Monsieur Gilliard...
...how do you say smouldering in French?
You silly, stupid child!
Think of it.
Russian princesses performing an English play in French...
...for an audience of Polish nobles.
I hope somebody understands it.
At least we have the day to ourselves.
Mother...
...I'm bleeding.
Dear God!
How far is it back to Spala?
Two or three miles.
As fast as you can go!
Well?
It's a most severe attack.
The hemorrhaging may last for days.
I cabled the specialists in Petersburg.
They won't reach here until tomorrow night.
And the pain?
It comes in waves.
His fever's high.
There may be complications.
All we can do is watch and wait.
He will recover, won't he?
He's a strong boy.
He really is, you know.
The swelling...
Did you see?
I hate this house.
Of all the godforsaken places.
Our guests.
What shall I say?
God. I'd forgotten.
I'm not sure I can manage.
As long as we are here, no one will ever know about Alexis.
I think it's best to wait.
But if you wait, he may die.
This is the heir to all the Russians.
Would you want his body on your operating table?
You could not have chosen a worse time.
My son, as we sit here, is with the doctors.
I didn't choose it, sire.
It was forced on me.
I beg Your Majesty to understand.
Get on with it.
There must, in my opinion, be a change in policy.
Two hundred strikers have been shot at Lena.
At this rate, we'll soon have a million workers on strike.
We can't shoot them all.
The Duma must be reconvened.
Just leave your papers.
I'll read them when I can.
I need some answers now.
I haven't any now.
Your Majesty, I must insist!
Stay here, go back to Petersburg.
I don't care what you do!
They want their Duma...
...give it back to them!
I hope to God they rot in it!
As for...
They think it best to wait.
That's all?
What for?
What are they waiting for?
Developments.
I see.
And how long will the wait be?
I want our friend.
The prime minister's been here.
He says they've shot more strikers.
I can't even remember how many this time.
We decided something important.
Oh, yes.
The Duma.
I want this message sent now.
I want Father Gregory.
I was too young when Father died.
You were 26.
I want our friend.
If he's at home and starts tonight, the trip will take a week.
It's senseless.
Send it.
A funny thing.
My son is dying...
...and I can't cry.
When your father died...
...you wept for days.
You never knew.
I never said...
...how I felt listening to you sobbing...
...telling everyone how afraid you were.
Most men are men at 21.
You made me so ashamed.
All right.
In the name of the Father...
...and of the Son...
...and of the Holy Ghost...
...amen.
"The Tsarevitch has been taken ill.
The heir's condition is considered to be grave.
His response to treatment so far..."
This one for midday to announce...
...a severe relapse.
And one...
...for tomorrow night.
The final bulletin.
I see.
As to the funeral plans...
For God's sake, Vladimir!
But you need to know.
The funeral train...
...will consist of 11...
...cars.
You should try to sleep.
No.
Some tea, at least.
It's come!
He's answered.
Listen.
"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers.
Do not grieve.
The little one will not die.
Do not let the doctors bother him.
Be at peace.
I am leaving immediately and will be at your side soon."
He's not to be disturbed.
I want your promise.
But, Your Majesty...
No more doctors.
I can bar the door if need be.
I can sleep now.
All is well, my darling.
Will it make any difference if Alexis is left alone?
No, I suppose not.
Alexei likes me best in rubies.
Come. We'll see him now.
Good morning, my darling.
Good morning, Mother.
Good day, and the Lord be with you.
And the Lord be with you!
It's all right, baby.
We're here. It's all right.
- Blood!
- Why do you have such nasty dreams?
I heard a gun.
There was blood everywhere.
You were dreaming about
Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
It was nothing.
I had a dream.
If you had a dream, let's talk about it.
Are you all right now, Alexei?
Franz Ferdinand's assassination is bad for Austria and the Serbs...
...and for the assassin and his family.
But politics is like that in the Balkans.
The English vote and the Serbs assassinate.
You see, Serbia wants its freedom.
Austria won't give it to them and so this happens.
It has happened here.
- They threw a bomb...
- Nicky, it's so late.
They're not children anymore.
They must accept these things.
Grandfather was killed by a bomb.
So was Uncle Sergei.
But Serbia is a long way off.
And we don't need to have bad dreams about Archdukes.
The diplomats will send some angry notes.
A few generals will go on exercises and everyone will be sensible again.
All over Europe, kings and queens are sleeping safely in their beds.
And that's what we're going to do.
Your Majesty must not.
This is only a partial mobilization.
It is against Austria, not Germany, nor anyone else.
If Russia mobilizes, there will be a war.
The Austrians are shelling Belgrade.
We must be ready to defend ourselves.
I'm ordering prayers for peace to be said in all the churches.
But now I must see my ministers for armaments and recruitment.
It is in our hands, not God's.
He gave us minds to reason.
We can talk sanity to lunatics.
We can calm mad dogs.
God help us if we have to start praying!
We can pray when we bury the dead!
Here is some wonderful news.
A telegram from the Kaiser.
Just what we wanted.
Offering to mediate between us and Austria.
I knew I could count on Willy.
You see?
He's signed it, "Your sincere and devoted friend and cousin, Willy."
With due respect to your cousin, sire...
...the Kaiser is a deceitful...
...megalomaniac.
If he is offering to help...
...then it is time to pray.
They won't last a week.
We'll bury the German army and that pansy of a Kaiser...
...and be home for Christmas.
Colonel Volkov.
Inform the staff that the situation has improved greatly.
I'll brief them fully in half an hour.
But shall we continue to prepare for the general mobilization?
In case?
I'll brief you fully in half an hour.
We can't run a modern war, sir.
We're not fighting
Napoleon this time.
Germany has ten miles of railway to every one of ours.
They have 100 factories to every one of ours.
All we have is men.
They'll be slaughtered like flies.
We have 11/2 million men in uniform.
Next week we'll have
41/2 million men in uniform.
At a casualty rate of 20% wounded and 10% killed...
...we can maintain an army of five million men.
The Kaiser can't beat that.
Austria wants to humiliate us.
We must show her we'll be firm.
We need the mobilization or your government will be outmaneuvered.
But if we mobilize, the Kaiser will have to.
And France, and England.
Nobody will be able to stop.
Send a telegram to the Kaiser with a message from me.
Say that though we've both mobilized, it doesn't mean we'll fight.
And nothing will break our old friendship.
Sign it "Nicky."
Order the general mobilization.
Madness.
This one can't get to the colors soon enough, can you?
I'm old, sir.
I've seen so many wars.
They all seemed so important at the time.
Now...
...I don't even remember what they were called.
Millions...
...of dead men.
I don't know why.
Nobody knows.
You could so easily stop this war, sir.
All you have to do is to get up...
...now...
...quietly...
...go home to your family.
You'd be the greatest of all the Tsars.
Your Majesty's foreign minister,
Mr. Sazanov...
...has received a note from the German Ambassador.
Your Majesty...
...at ten minutes past seven this evening...
...Germany declared war on Russia.
Gentlemen...
...Germany has declared war on Russia.
God save Russia!
God save the Tsar.
God save the Tsar!
None of you will be here...
...when this war ends.
Everything we fought for will be lost.
Everything we loved will be broken.
The victors will be as cursed as the defeated.
The world will grow old.
And men will wander about, lost in the ruins...
...and go mad.
Tradition.
Virtue.
Restraint.
They all go!
I'm not mourning for myself, but for the people who come after me.
They will live without hope.
And all they will have...
...will be guilt...
...revenge...
...and terror.
And the world will be full of fanatics...
...and trivial fools.
Set all differences aside!
We are Russians first of all!
And until the day of victory dawns...
...we stand united...
...in the defense of Holy Russia!
God save the Tsar!
- There's no transport. Can they walk?
- Yes, sir.
They're needed at the front tonight.
See to it.
Right face!
Forward march!
Bitch! German bitch!
Shut up!
Have you seen them?
What happened?
Would you like some tea?
I've always hated this time of year.
It gets dark so early.
Oh, Niki!
You gave in again.
You look so tired.
Did you even see the ministers?
You want the minutes of the meeting?
Just the gist of it.
I told them I proposed replacing
Nikolasha with myself...
...and was leaving for headquarters to take command.
Go on. They said...?
Nothing much.
They said they'd all resign.
They said the government would fall, that it was madness.
And you took it?
- You gave in?
- They're my advisors.
You're their Tsar.
But what if they're right?
They might be. How can I be sure?
You must go.
Nikolasha is a bad man.
Father Gregory has said so.
I'm sick to death of Father Gregory.
All my life...
...my whole life, I've done what you want.
I gave Mother up.
You hated her, so we don't see her anymore.
I gave my friends up.
Do you know I haven't a single friend?
I've got my family.
Four girls, one sick boy...
...and you.
I ask...
...before I eat or sleep or change my clothes:
"Is this what Sunny wants?"
And it never is.
There's always more!
Sweet Jesus! How much do you want of me?
I want this.
Don't you know I want to go?
For months there's been no ammunition.
In Galicia, they ration bullets.
Three a day.
My soldiers get three shots a day!
What can I do?
I can't make shells.
I fire ministers...
...I hire ministers, and nothing happens.
I'm no use here.
I belong at Stavka with my men!
Don't tell me.
Tell your ministers.
You know people want me to divorce you?
Father Gregory warned me of that.
If I thought it would help,
I would go away.
But it would be disastrous.
Has Father Gregory told you that too?
I don't need anyone to tell me about us.
This is the beginning of the glory of your reign.
Our friend told me so.
It will be the greatest page in Russian history...
...the story of these weeks and days.
And when you go...
...don't worry over what you've left behind. I'm here.
Lean on me.
Use me.
I'm not wise or strong...
...but God will show me what to do.
With our armies in retreat, you must not take command.
You could not have chosen a more unfortunate time.
Faith in Your Majesty...
...is the one thing that keeps the whole country together.
Have I heard it all?
One thing. The headquarters at Stavka is 500 miles from here.
Go on.
While you're away, who will run the government?
When the Tsar is with the Army, the Tsaritza takes his place.
Sire!
With all respects, the Tsaritza's lack of experience...
...and limited understanding of the
Russian people, gracious though she...
I shall continue to make the decisions...
...but you'll have to make your reports to her.
Thank you for your advice, gentlemen.
I have thought about this.
And I know that God is with me.
I leave for Stavka in the morning.
My very own darling...
...remember last night
when we were together.
I yearn for your caresses.
I can never have enough of them.
I kiss you, caress you...
...love you, long for you...
...can't sleep without you.
Bless you...
...Sunny.
Get up. We're moving out.
I said get up!
Your Majesty.
You can't be glad to see me.
You understand my reasons?
You think I'm wrong.
The Tsar comes second after God.
I would die for him.
I'm sorry, Nikolasha.
Don't be.
It's a great relief.
Can't get away from here soon enough.
I've appointed General Alexeiev
Chief of Staff.
Good man, first class.
Listen to him.
Let him run things.
I intend to.
Can't do worse than I did.
You know...
...I've got a million corpses on my hands.
I weep too easily these days.
Getting old.
It's bitter, Nicky. Bitter.
I don't envy you.
What do you think I should do?
Retreat. Preserve the Army.
That's the only thing.
And what else?
Wear socks to bed.
Floors freeze in the winter.
I'll ask Sunny to knit me some.
She sends her love.
The devil she does!
I could have won this war if
I were only fighting on one front.
But I had two enemies at my back:
Your Sunny and her monk!
Not long ago he wrote to me...
...could he come and bless the troops?
I told him if he came, I'd hang him.
Should have let him come.
Hung the bastard when he got here.
God help you, Nicky.
God save the Tsar!
God save the Tsar!
So, you'd like to be an opera singer?
Yes, you have the chest for it.
Have you ever sung in public before?
Go to the Imperial Theater...
...give them this.
It's an introduction.
I have them printed up now to save time.
Father Gregory.
There's a gentleman arrived, says he's the Minister of something.
Foreign Minister.
He's early.
Send him in.
He might enjoy this.
Now let's hear you sing a little.
Don't worry.
I'm no judge.
Father Gregory says come in.
Has the Empress now made him responsible for the arts?
My dear man!
Isn't she delightful?
Absolutely charming.
I had no idea you had asked me here for a recital.
She wants to sing.
I like to help people.
You don't mind?
You've placed 3 men in my Ministry who can neither read nor write.
Why should I mind?
I don't hate anyone...
...and yet so many enemies.
I'm not rich.
What I get, I give away.
I take no vengeance on the men
I've removed from office.
When you fall, I won't abuse you.
We are appointed and dismissed by the Tsar.
You're his enemy!
You and all the other ministers.
You're all against him.
Can it be your dream to have us all removed from office?
Every one.
You are destroying Russia!
Don't you know it?
What's your price?
Do you want to be made a pope or...
Grishka! How are the miracles going today?
My God!
They're elevating
Grishka to the Cabinet.
Grand Duke Dmitry.
Prince Yussoupov.
Pray excuse me.
He tells me
I'm destroying Russia.
What, single-handed?
If you're friends of his, take him away.
Get him out of Petersburg.
Take your girls, or your boys.
Frolic in the provinces...
...but get him out of here!
Your Excellency sounds hysterical.
Your Highness ought to be.
Whatever happens, I'll survive.
There's always room for one more bureaucrat.
I'll survive...
...but will you princes?
No.
We're going to be torn to pieces.
You politicians think you're in control...
...but you'll be swept away like the rest of us.
Rome, Athens...
...Petersburg.
You can't stop it.
In the meantime,
I shall enjoy myself.
Come to my place on Thursday.
I'm having a special little party.
Look.
This beautiful scarf.
Have it.
I can't stop the revolution.
But until it comes, let's have some fun.
Even if it's only for a few more days.
For God's sake!
Look, if I brought you money...
...if it were enough, would you leave Petersburg?
I can't leave.
I want to serve
Batushka and Matushka.
I want peace...
...and food for peasants everywhere.
I want that girl you saw...
...and all the girls
I haven't seen.
I want to sleep...
...but can't sleep unless I'm drunk.
I want to die and go to Heaven.
I want music.
I want God to love me and I want to see you dance!
Hello, Mama.
This is my Commander in Chief,
General Alexeiev.
How are Sunny and the children?
This is the first Christmas
I've spent away from the family.
You look well.
I came to congratulate you, Nicky.
What for?
For finding from all Russia's countless cretins...
...idiots and incompetents...
...the men least qualified to run your government.
- Would you like some tea?
- I've taken tea.
I've tried to understand you, but I can't.
I sometimes fail to judge men well.
Sometimes? How can one man make so many mistakes?
Why did you stop our Austrian campaign?
Our casualties were terrible.
You knew they would be before you started.
Theirs were larger.
Mother, what do you know about strategy?
What do you?
What are you doing here, anyway?
There isn't a battlefield within 500 miles.
It's important that I'm here.
Your place is in Petersburg.
Don't you know about the riots and scandals and starvation?
They hate your wife.
They think she's a German spy.
How can you let that foolish woman ruin your country?
Leave Sunny out of this.
Someone has to make you see sense about her.
Can't you think of anyone else?
Can't you think of the rest of your family?
Can't you think of Russia?
I wish your father were alive.
Don't throw him at me!
He knew how to be a Tsar.
He'd have burnt Vienna down, stamped on the Germans...
...and shot the strikers.
Anything to give Russia peace.
And he'd certainly have known how to deal with Rasputin.
He is a man of God.
Do you believe that?
He works miracles.
He keeps my son alive.
Do you believe that, Nicky?
Sunny does. She needs him.
Hang him!
I don't wish any man harm...
...but so many Russians will die if you don't.
I can't.
At least send him to Siberia.
I can't!
He's going to destroy us.
Millions will suffer. And all because you can't say no to your wife.
It's in God's hands.
That's no answer!
I see what's happening!
Then act!
Come back home.
Hang this man, send Alexandra to Livadia...
...and deal with the real problems.
I can't!
In Heavers name, Nicholas, what can you do?
Just what I'm doing, Mama.
There's nothing else that can be done.
I hope you are not on a diet, Father Gregory.
To Batushka and Matushka.
I'll die soon, my friends.
I've made my will.
I won't live to see the New Year.
And it makes me angry.
It's good to enjoy yourself with your friends.
I don't want to die.
Russia!
Father Gregory...
...needs a woman...
...to cheer him up!
I've been poisoned.
You've tried to kill me.
You all have.
You silly fools.
I thought I could trust you.
You silly little fools.
You can't even kill properly.
You're too small to destroy me.
Look.
Cyanide!
Now get up, Prince!
Get up!
Try!
Let's see you try to kill me.
Cyanide!
I begged Batushka not to start this war.
I know who dies.
You don't die.
The people die.
The wise old men, the generals, the ministers...
...the ones who say,
"Do this, go there!"
No mud on their boots!
No bullets in their brains!
Where's your rifle, Prince?
Why aren't you at the front, where the blood is?
I'm not a German!
I come from the Russian soil...
...and you fools will never destroy me!
Thank God...
...Russia has sons like me...
...and isn't at the mercy of scums like you!
Let's have the other side.
We must get rid of his body.
God bless the Tsar.
Your Majesty...
...the Cabinet has been waiting for over an hour.
I can't see them today.
But we need you to sign the decrees.
Petersburg is starving!
I can't.
You're glad he's dead!
You wanted him to die.
Please tell the ministers my mother cannot see them today.
They will be informed of a convenient time to come again.
Have Grand Duke Dmitry and Prince Yussoupov arrested.
Only the Tsar can order the arrest of one of his own family.
It's his monarchical privilege.
Please try.
His will.
"I feel that I shall leave life before January the first.
If any of your relatives have wrought my death...
...then no one of your family...
...none of your children or relatives will remain alive.
They will be killed by the Russian people.
Brother will kill brother...
...and there will be no nobles left in the country."
The beast is dead!
His killers are heroes!
Russia is saved!
Mr. President.
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
I have the floor,
Mr. Kerensky.
One madman has been murdered and you are celebrating.
There is no food, no fuel.
A third of our army is still unarmed...
...and they are surrendering in tens of thousands.
Nothing is changed.
The German Tsaritza is still running the country.
The Tsar must stop hiding with his soldiers...
...and come back to Petersburg!
Chaos is coming to Russia...
...and he should be here to deal with it!
Your Majesty?
What is it, Alexeiev?
There is a general strike in St. Petersburg.
The city is in chaos.
It can't be.
We're at war.
There are demonstrations in the streets.
The Army refuses to fire on them.
Telegraph this to the
Military Governor:
All riots are to be stopped at once.
The Duma is to be dissolved.
I return immediately to Petersburg.
And sign it Nicholas.
Sire, I hope there is someone in Petersburg to take our orders.
Madame, his fever is still the same.
If only it would break.
Why did they have to go and get measles now?
Lie down, darling.
I heard it again.
It's nothing.
You must keep warm.
When you've finished, get some rest.
Still no news from the Tsar.
They don't answer our telegrams.
We must reach him.
He must come back.
God knows what'll happen.
I heard some more firing.
We're cut off. Soldiers on the track ahead, Your Majesty.
They've got artillery.
I must get through to Tsarkoe Selo.
My family's there.
We can't.
There's open track to Moscow or to northern headquarters at Pskov.
I see.
Where should we go?
They're rioting in Moscow.
Well, then. To Pskov.
Thank God you're here.
Prepare an order...
Your Majesty, I'm afraid it's too late.
The Duma has appointed a provisional government.
And all your ministers have been arrested.
Order your troops...
...to march...
At this moment, Your Majesty...
...if my troops knew the Tsar was here...
...there's every chance they would turn on you.
Whole garrisons are going over.
Sire, the Duma also insists...
...on your abdication.
Surely my generals stand with me?
I have already...
...been in touch with the Commanders.
General Kornilov:
"I cannot order an attack on Petersburg."
Admiral of the Baltic Fleet...
...Nepenin:
"It is with greatest difficulty...
...I keep my troops and the fleet in check.
I urge the Tsar to abdicate."
General Ruzsky:
"I cannot answer for my troops.
I implore His Majesty...
...to abdicate."
His Imperial Highness,
General Nicolaievich...
What does Nikolasha say?
"On my knees...
...I beg you to abdicate...
...and save the dynasty."
Nicky, please come home.
Tell me, Dr. Federov.
If my son...
...as the future Tsar...
...would remain behind to be educated in Russia...
...while I and my family went abroad...
...how long would he be likely to live?
Deprived of your love and care...
...and what I call "customary surroundings," it's hard to say.
It's a matter of luck and chance, Your Majesty.
There are no real statistics.
One would hope that he could live a normal span of life, but...
Well...
...twenty...
...would be a good age.
"Accordingly, in agreement with the Imperial Duma...
...we have thought it right to abdicate from the Russian throne...
...and to lay down the supreme power.
Therefore..."
It seems in order.
May I?
- "Therefore, in the name..."
- I won't tear it up.
Shall I sign it in your lap?
I wish to add one thing more.
I shall abdicate for myself...
...and also for my son.
But, Your Majesty...
...the Duma thought that...
Everyone expected that your son would...
May I know the reasons?
My reasons are personal.
In that case, I shall add the appropriate clause.
It will be spring soon at Livadia.
Is that where you'll send us?
Yes, if you like.
We've had no time to plan ahead.
I've often thought I'd like to be a country gentleman.
I've always liked to watch things grow.
It's lovely there.
The sun is warm.
And they say the soil is very good.
Much of the happiness
I've known I've had there.
It's now in order.
March...
...the 15th...
The Ides of March.
If only you had acted sooner, sir.
You think this could have been avoided?
Who is there?
Nicholas Romanov.
Let him pass.
I'm sorry.
Please...
...don't...
Please!
Please!
I didn't mean to.
Please!
I'm so ashamed.
I didn't mean to do it.
Please don't!
Please don't!
Please!
Graduated at Kazan University...
...with a degree in law.
Brother...
...hanged for terrorism in 1887...
...by the present Tsar's father.
Married.
No children.
Doesn't smoke.
And won't let his comrades...
...smoke.
Grandson of a serf.
Well-traveled, I see.
The Tsar should have had your secret police.
My party will make a study of your methods.
They fail to mention your sense of humor.
It gets even funnier.
I want to get to Petersburg.
You want to get to Paris.
It's outrageous.
We are here in Zurich, and if I understand you...
...you want the German government, which is at war with Russia...
...to take you across
Germany to Sweden...
...because you can get to Russia from there.
I'm offering to stop the war.
I didn't know you had so much authority.
If we had a Bolshevik government...
...we'd immediately make peace with Germany.
Then how many German divisions could you transfer to the western front?
And now you are asking me for classified information.
Do you know my government locked up more Bolsheviks than anyone else?
How can you expect us...
...to help you make a revolution?
You have no sense of proportion.
All I'm interested in is power in Russia.
It's lying on the streets waiting to be picked up.
Kerensky won't last.
He's still fighting the war...
...and the people are desperate for peace.
I shall offer them peace.
Then you'll see the real revolution.
I see your jokes are very subtle.
A Marxist wants to use the Kaiser.
And perhaps the Kaiser...
...can use a Marxist.
There.
In a few months, these will be turnips.
They're carrots.
And when they grow...
...will we still be here to eat them?
Nicholas Romanov!
My name is Kerensky.
I always used to offer sherry in this room.
There's none left.
I haven't much time.
We must talk.
What's happening to the war?
We hear the soldiers talking.
One hears of...
...terrible defeats.
Will we fight on?
Certainly.
The future of my government depends on it.
We stand pledged to victory.
What all of us have been through has some meaning after all.
Will we be staying here much longer?
You will be leaving here in a few days.
All we do is dream of England.
We've been very happy there.
- May I sit down?
- I'm sorry.
England won't accept you.
Won't accept?
King George is my cousin.
He doesn't seem to want you, either.
He has to think of his own position.
Of course.
I must not make difficulties for...
Nor will the French.
None of our allies want to risk it.
They are at war to save democracy...
...and you were a tyrant.
I'm a prisoner.
Damn them, I'm a father with a family!
You will be safe.
I'll see to that.
There's blood enough on everybody's hands. I won't have yours on mine.
Just as soon as possible...
...you'll be leaving for Siberia...
...to a village near Tobolsk.
Siberia?
You will be staying there for a week or so...
...until I can organize some way for you to leave the country.
From there on...
...I wash my hands of you.
Why not send us out to Finland?
It's just 30 miles away.
I'd never get you through
St. Petersburg alive.
Do you realize I'm all that stands between you and the block?
No munitions.
No supplies.
I don't know where the Army stands.
Treasury is bankrupt.
The students riot.
Workers carry arms.
The Socialists want this.
The Menshiviks want that.
The radicals, the centrists, the cadets.
The Bolsheviks.
I can't arrest them even if I wanted to.
We have rights and laws now.
You had power and no laws.
I have laws and no power.
I wish I could help you.
You had your chances.
I wish I had mine.
Revolution!
Revolution, now!
Land!
Peace!
All power...
...to the Soviets!
Not quite like your Parliament.
We haven't English manners yet.
My government is more concerned with content than style.
One detects a sentiment for peace.
That worries us.
It's mostly the Bolsheviks.
Nobody pays any attention to them.
They only have 6 members in the Duma.
In your position, I'd put this Lenin quietly in jail.
On what pretext?
I've read his speeches.
Surely you have too.
I cannot put a man in jail for what he thinks.
It's in your Bill of Rights.
He wants to overthrow the government by force.
We Americans call that treason.
In Russia, it's always been...
...too easy to lock a man up because he disagrees with you.
It's a bad habit.
If the people want Lenin...
...they can vote him into power in December.
Until that time...
Rodzianko has finished.
I must speak now.
I trust I've made my government's position clear.
America wants Russia in the war.
The British government is equally...
...worried about the peace demonstrations.
No more than France.
Russia's contribution is vital to the Allied cause.
Let me be blunt, Mr. Kerensky.
We're offering you 300 million dollars if you fight.
No war, no loan.
You cannot buy Russia.
We will fight...
...because we've already sacrificed too much.
We owe it to the dead!
They must count for something!
Victory!
Nothing less than victory!
Look! Look!
I've found Tobolsk on the map.
It's further away than London.
Yes, ma chère.
Now remember, you are princesses.
If I hear of any misbehavior...
...I shall be very angry.
We'll be good.
You're all so big now.
Help Mama and Papa.
Yes, we will.
Goodbye, Alexis.
I'm glad we're going.
I hate this place.
Let me come with you.
You're too old for Siberia.
You'll be all right.
But who will look after you?
You've never been anywhere without me.
Take care of yourself.
The train is ready.
This is Colonel Kobylinsky.
You will be under his command until you leave the country.
His orders carry my authority at all times.
Nicholas, I want my things.
I want my pictures and scrapbooks.
I want...
Frau Romanov.
You have kept your head.
You should be grateful.
Come along. It doesn't matter.
No, Vladimir. One goodbye was enough, please.
Things.
Things one can do without.
They break, get lost.
One buys and sells them.
The main thing is we are together.
Power stations.
All railway stations.
State bank.
Central telephone exchange.
The Bolsheviks have taken over the station...
...the telegraphs...
...the banks.
How strong are they?
If we had loyal troops...
...how many would it take to dislodge them?
One regiment would be enough.
But I haven't got a regiment.
Not one I can trust.
Yes, but there's only a handful of them, surely!
We could smash them if we acted now!
We told the people to go on with the war.
Lenin offered peace.
That's where we went wrong.
Look at this.
The cruiser Aurora.
And every gun is trained on us.
The government has fallen.
We shall now begin to construct...
...the Socialist order.
What's it say?
It's twenty-one below.
It feels like it.
How can you go out in this weather?
Gilliard's waiting.
And besides, I quite enjoy it.
That's the second time this morning.
There's so little else to do.
I keep forgetting.
Aren’t you bored, Madame?
At times, I actually like it.
Mending clothes and teaching class and quiet afternoons.
I doze and daydream and I think about my life.
I don't know what I did wrong.
I'd feel better if I did.
Here, take it if it helps.
Christ!
I can't trust my own men.
Anything could set them off.
I don't give orders anymore.
I make suggestions.
They go and vote.
Tomorrow they could vote to hang me.
It's absurd.
They're decent boys.
They were once, but they're lonely now.
Cold and scared to death.
Have you got any money?
Not much.
Why?
Has it crossed your mind I represent a nonexistent government?
Who put me in this post, gave me authority?
Whose money pays the troops?
Kerensky's gone.
The money's gone.
I haven't paid them in a month.
You think I should pay them?
The prisoners keep the guard.
I wish I'd had you for my finance minister.
You'd have revolutionized the penal system.
Don't laugh.
Shall I take the collection?
In Tobolsk, there are rumors of civil war.
God only knows what's going on!
Out here, exposed like this.
That's not to keep you in here.
It's to keep them out.
Them?
- Who are you expecting?
- I don't know.
I hate this damned assignment!
I can't answer for your safety.
I can't do my job.
You care what happens to us, don't you?
It's my job to.
What was that about?
Apparently there's a civil war.
I'm not surprised.
Too many people had too much to lose.
He's worried.
We all are.
Put it down, Vollinski.
Go to hell!
I'll shoot.
Monsieur Gilliard wants you for your history lesson.
Don't keep him waiting.
You too, young man.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
- You're cut.
- Hands off!
You'd better see the doctor.
I said, hands off!
Dr. Botkin hasn't had a thing to do for weeks.
It's making him difficult to live with.
You'd be doing us all a favor.
You dizzy?
I'm all right.
Come on, then.
My wife's a nurse.
They'll fix you up between them.
So that's how it's done.
I've never celebrated Easter with real eggs.
When they dry, rub them with bacon fat to make them shine.
- I want to do the next one.
- I used to dread Easter.
I had to kiss the whole court three times. Sixteen hundred people!
They used to line up to be kissed.
It puts you off kissing.
Christ has risen.
Christ has risen.
They've started to dance.
Can we see? Please!
- Come on.
- Let's!
Open the door.
They look so happy.
Let's go out to them.
I don't think we should.
Mother, please! Let's!
Go and join your sisters.
No.
- And authorizing transfer of command to me.
By order of the Central
Committee in Moscow.
It seems in order, Commissar.
Are you at liberty to say what Moscow wants them for?
No, Colonel, I can't tell you.
I don't know.
How soon can transport for the prisoners be organized?
- What kind of transport?
- Anything that moves.
- Tomorrow sometime.
- Good. We leave tomorrow night.
May I know why?
The civil war.
The Whites, they call themselves.
Conservatives and Monarchists and Tsarist generals.
All our enemies.
They're moving towards Siberia.
They're powerful.
Our troops have yielded half the Ukraine.
On all fronts, the revolution is in danger.
And out here...
...it's open season on your Romanovs.
I'll see them now.
Can't your government protect us here?
We're so out of touch.
Has your government lost it...?
Has your government lost its authority too?
My government is 3000 miles away.
Out here, they listen when they like.
When they don't...
...the lines go dead.
The Ural Soviet has ordered your arrest.
They have a prison, just for you, in Ekaterinburg.
You're less than popular out here.
Am I beloved in Moscow?
Do they want me for a public trial? Is that it?
And when they find me guilty, what then?
They can roast you on a spit for all I care.
My duty is to get you there intact.
From now on, strict security will be observed.
You're confined to this house until we leave.
I'll have him first.
I'm sorry.
He's an educated man, at any rate.
They could have sent an executioner.
Father?
There's no hope, is there?
Nonsense.
None at all.
Sit.
May I ask why?
Surely my features are familiar?
Front face and profile.
Sit down!
Look at me! It's just awful.
You look like a thief.
You look like a trollop.
I don't. What's a trollop?
Dear Lord, so she does!
- I don't find that amusing.
- Just look.
It's not amusing at all.
The girls won't stop crying.
How is he?
I don't know.
It's not as bad as some.
The knee will go on swelling for a bit.
It may be weeks before he walks again.
But he'll mend.
Mend!
I'm all right, Father.
- Botkin tells me you'll be fine.
- I tripped.
I don't believe you.
I ought to sleep.
They told me to get some rest.
We are going God knows why to God knows where...
...and you do this!
I have a family to protect.
What are you doing for them?
What did you ever do?
You abdicated, you gave in!
I thought Tsars had to die!
I did it for you.
- You could have fought.
- For you?
I'm so ashamed of you.
Look at us!
Look where you've put us.
Thinking back...
When I think back, I can see them so clearly now...
...corners that I didn't turn.
You've had no life.
The girls have had no life.
I wasted you.
I had your future in my hands and spent it.
Look at you.
You're all I see.
Your faces.
Why did you abdicate for me?
Why?
You didn't even ask.
I didn't want you to pay for my mistakes.
Am I not paying for them now?
Aren’t all of us?
I should have had a chance...
...the right to live my own life, make my own decisions.
I could have tried to help Russia...
...help Mother and my sisters, and perhaps, even you.
I could have been a Romanov...
...a Tsar.
It all went wrong.
I hardly know why or how.
Instead, I just bleed.
It's my fate.
I bleed.
I love you.
Please understand.
I do, Father.
But does it really matter?
Goodbye.
What will you do now?
What can I do?
Whatever side I join,
I kill Russians.
I don't know what to do anymore.
We're ready.
What a world this is.
God bless you.
It's too late for that.
But thank you.
Are you all right?
Does it hurt?
Would you like it to?
Not at all.
Why are you moving a sick boy?
It's inhuman.
I am just taking you to Moscow, that's all.
And what happens to us there?
Get in.
And pray that when we get out of here, there'll be a train.
How long till Moscow?
Five or six days.
What are our chances?
Of what?
Living till Christmas?
I haven't thought about it.
You puzzle me.
You'd be happy to see us dead, and yet you help us get away.
I haven't your taste for murder,
Bloody Nicholas.
I've never had a chance to get used to it.
How many men have you killed?
Have you the least idea?
God knows how many peasants died!
Nobody counted children.
You only know the number of soldiers because somebody counted them for you.
Seven million!
Six quarts a man times seven million.
It's an ocean.
You ever seen a battle?
I'm wrong. You're not
Bloody Nicholas.
You're a man of no imagination.
Fit for a king.
Comrade Commissar!
Comrade Commissar!
Greetings from the Ural Soviet at Ekaterinburg, comrade.
I have an order authorizing me to take charge of your prisoners.
From the Ural Soviet.
My orders come from the Central Committee in Moscow.
I'm not in your jurisdiction.
Move your train.
I want the Romanovs.
I have a legal order for them.
There's only one legal government in Soviet Russia.
One government? Where is it?
What's it doing?
They're losing to the Whites!
They've taken Omsk.
And they're coming here to save your Tsar!
Can your Central Committee stop them?
He's not my Tsar.
He's my responsibility.
I'm not saving him,
I'm taking him to trial.
We must stay inside the law!
We're not the Okrana.
That's why we had a revolution, comrade.
We're going through.
Try.
I'll shoot you.
And I'll get a medal for it.
Mine or Moscow's, Commissar?
Whose legal orders do you take?
Get away!
Get in!
What are you doing?
Only Russians in the truck.
You're Swiss neutrals.
- They're with us.
- I've got my orders.
Get in!
Monsieur Gilliard!
I'll write!
I'll try to see you!
Come on.
Get out! Come on!
Hurry up! Come on!
You must be very tired.
Come inside...
...and get dry.
Is today your birthday?
That was weeks ago.
Of course it was.
And mine too.
I was 46.
Imagine that.
Breakfast?
I'm not hungry. You eat it.
Nor am I.
What's the day like?
I don't know now.
It doesn't matter.
It goes on and on.
I don't know anymore.
What can God have in mind for us?
They've left a crack!
What difference does it make?
- Look. Something might happen.
- What?
Something might.
Go away!
What do you want?
Do you want to see me?
Is that it?
I'm 21 and I'm pretty.
Everyone says I'm pretty.
- That's the only man who's seen me!
- I know, it's all right.
He's gone, he's gone.
You know what's funny?
I wanted to ask him in.
Just once...
...I wanted somebody.
What is the Ural Soviet up to?
The Whites are three days away.
- Can't you make up your minds?
- All right, comrade.
We've had fresh instructions from the Kremlin.
They express confidence in our ability to handle this difficult...
What exactly did they say?
Let me see.
I've committed it to memory.
The cable read: "We leave the matter in your hands."
Well, that's taking a position, isn't it?
Now, what are my orders?
It's my duty as a member of the
Ural Presidium to act as an observer...
Observer? Of what?
The execution.
That's already decided.
The question now is, how many?
You're having a debate on it?
Everything must be above reproach.
We hope to bring it to a vote this afternoon.
There's a division of opinion about the children. But as for the Tsar...
Was it necessary to remove the view?
Security.
Good day.
Good day.
No sun today?
What a shame.
I suppose you're not well enough.
What's it like being ill?
What's it like having gray eyes?
It can't be nice...
...being an invalid at your age.
And they can't do anything to help one.
What a pity.
It's gold!
Let it go!
You're dead!
That's all you know about.
You murder everything!
You hurt him, and by God...
You struck the Tsar!
Bring him outside!
First thing each morning...
...put Alexis' brace on.
I won't let them hurt you!
Strap it on tight,
Your Majesty.
He doesn't like it, but it's good for him.
Dear God!
I won't let them.
You can save him.
You can stop it.
Certainly.
Your man started it.
He should be punished.
He will be.
And Nagorny?
Taking someone's life.
No man should have that power.
You had it.
Yes.
And I have learned that a strong man has no need of power.
And a weak man is destroyed by it.
I am being punished for what I have done.
Nagorny is innocent.
He's like a child.
You don't shoot children, do you?
In your new world, are there penalties for innocence?
Sometimes.
It takes a wise judge to know who is innocent...
...and who is guilty.
I wish I knew.
I'll do what I can.
Thank you.
I'd like to kill him.
Wait and see.
He'll do what's right.
I know him. He's a murderer.
He's a thoughtful man.
He'll send Nagorny back to us.
He's not a monster.
I've never known a heart without some murder in it.
I made these men.
They are our Russians.
I am responsible for what they are.
I let them starve.
I put them in prisons and I shot them.
If there's hatred in them now...
...I put it there.
But they are filled with love.
And with mercy too.
You must remember that.
They are all murderers.
I'd like to kill them all.
Acid? Gasoline?
Can't you just throw them down the mineshaft?
You don't approve of this, comrade?
No, I quite approve...
...of terror, arson, murder.
Any tool that serves the revolution.
As a member of the Ural Presidium, it's my duty to see that...
They must hurt very much.
My fingers.
They work well enough for this.
I couldn't play the piano now.
I used to hear you practicing when I was in my office.
Did you?
Schumann and Schubert.
I never thought much of your voice.
Didn’t you?
Never told me that before.
I suddenly thought of the yacht this morning.
Remember how the band used to play all the time?
And out of tune.
Do you think they drank?
How did that waltz go?
You're no better than the band.
Your beautiful hands.
The girls.
They won't come in.
We're alone.
I still want you so much.
Nothing can change that, Sunny.
I do love you.
I'm sure it's getting nearer.
How far now?
It's hard to tell.
Perhaps thirty miles.
Thirty miles.
They've been here all morning.
Why don't they go away?
Can't they make up their minds?
I'm sure it's getting nearer.
I'm going to phone again.
Go on.
It's all of them.
I could have told you that.
It's about time.
I kept their mail.
I didn't know whether they ought to have it.
Shall I give it to them now?
Would it be cruel...
...or kind?
I don't know how to judge these things.
I don't think anyone knows.
Listen.
Nikolasha writes:
"Saw Vladimir walking in the Nevsky Prospect.
Old fool, all dressed up in his Imperial gold uniform.
Nobody seems to mind."
Listen to Grandmama:
"Remember to dress for dinner.
It keeps up one's dignity and impresses the people."
Dress for dinner?
Nikolasha says he'll join her soon in the Crimea.
Vladimir.
He says:
"Ma chère, I've seen this Lenin.
His suit is wrinkled and he wears a worker's cap.
The man will never make a Tsar."
Monsieur Gilliard's still in Ekaterinburg.
He's trying to come and see us.
Mama's off to England in a month or so.
She says the spring was late this year...
...but very beautiful.
Lord, but it's good to be alive!
The world is like a field in summer...
...bursting with good things.
One day...
...when all the wars are over...
...someone young will lead us to the harvest.
As long as there are children...
...anything is possible.
What's happened?
Get your family dressed.
- Why?
- We're leaving.
Don't be afraid.
The White Army must have broken through.
Help Anastasia.
Wait in here, please.

What about the others?
I'd be playing a rotten trick on them.
–They'll be happier when you're gone.
–They have a war to win.
Well… what the hell.
If they don't want to fly any more missions, let them stand up and say so.
It's a deal.
Help!
Help!
Help him!
–What?
–Help him! Help him!
–Help who?
–Help the bombardier!
–I'm the bombardier, I'm all right.
–Then help him. Help him!
Snowden.
–What'd he say?
–He said, “Snowden”.
Snowden's dead.
Snowden?
–Why is he talking to a dead man?
–He's Captain Yossarian. He's crazy.
–Who says so?
–I do.
–'Cause I said I hate that son of a bitch?
–Who?
–He hates Colonel Cathcart.
–I didn't ask you, Orr.
–Colonel Cathcart isn't here.
–Who said anything about him?
–Colonel Korn isn't here.
–Who said anything about him?
–What son of a bitch do you hate?
–What son of a bitch is here?
You don't make any sense.
–You've got a persecution complex.
–Damn right.
–You admit it!
–I'm being persecuted.
–By whom?
–By them!
–Who is “them”?
–Every one of them!
–Who?
–Who do you think?
–No idea!
–Then how do you know they aren't?
–That's sheer what-do-you-call-it.
–Sophistry.
Like hell it is, McWatt.
They're trying to kill me!
No one's trying to kill you.
Eat your dessert like a good boy.
–Then why are they shooting at me?
–They're shooting at everyone.
What difference does that make?
–Suppose everyone thought like you?
–Then I'd be a fool to think any different.
You need your head examined.
There's nothing wrong with it.
–Look at it once, will you?
–Your head is OK, Yossarian.
Please, don't do that.
–Doc…
–What?
–I want you to ground me.
–Don't start that again.
Doc, I don't want to fly any more.
It's dangerous.
Listen, I told you…
Let's get out of here.
I've flown 35 missions. Now that sadistic nut has raised the number to 50.
In any other outfit I would've been rotated after 25. Help me.
I'm due for rotation myself in a couple of months, if I don't break any rules.
One of the rules says I can't ground anyone just because he asks me to.
–Can you ground someone who's crazy?
–I have to.
The rules say I have to ground anyone who's crazy.
I'm crazy! Ask anybody.
Ask Nately, Dobbs, McWatt…
–Orr, tell him!
–Tell him what?
–Am I crazy?
–He's crazy, Doc. He won't fly with me.
I'd take good care of him, but he won't.
He's crazy, all right.
–See that? They all say I'm crazy.
–They're crazy.
–Why not ground them?
–Why don't they ask me to?
–Because they're crazy!
–Of course they're crazy.
And you can't let crazy people decide whether you're crazy or not, can you?
–Is Orr crazy?
–Of course he is.
He has to be, flying after all the close calls he's had.
–Then why can't you ground him?
–First he has to ask me.
–That's all he's gotta do?
–That's all.
–And then you can ground him?
–No. Then I cannot ground him.
–There's a catch.
–A catch?
Sure, Catch-22.
Anyone who wants to get out of combat isn't really crazy, so I can't ground him.
OK, let me see if I got this straight.
In order to be grounded,
I've got to be crazy.
And I must be crazy to keep flying.
But if I ask to be grounded, I'm not crazy any more and I have to keep flying.
You've got it! That's Catch-22.
That's some catch, that Catch-22.
It's the best there is!
Good afternoon, men, this is Major
Danby, your Flight Operations Officer, welcoming you to today's mission.
You've all been briefed on this morning's run, so I won't go over the details again.
There's no sense naming names, since the enemy is probably listening, and there's no reason I can think of to tell him where we're going to strike.
That's the stupidest goddamn thing
I've ever heard him say.
Weather conditions have improved tremendously over the mainland,
so you won't have any trouble seeing the target.
Of course that means that they will have no trouble at all seeing you.
Colonel Cathcart would like to say a few words before take-off.
–And so, without further ado…
–Give me that!
Men, I'm not gonna waste any more of your time than I have to.
I wish you good luck on today's mission.
To those of you who won't come back,
I'd like to say we're gonna do our best to take care of your wives and/or sweethearts.
And don't forget: General Dreedle wants to see a nice tight bombing pattern on those aerial photographs.
Everyone ready to go?
Colonel Korn, I'd like you to stay in the control tower.
Stay on top of this mission. I'd like to know when my boys make target.
Yes, sir!
What is it, Lieutenant Minderbinder?
–An egg, sir.
–I know that, Lieutenant.
–A fresh egg, sir.
–Where did you get the egg?
In Malta, sir, where there are enough chickens to lay fresh eggs for every officer in the squadron, at five cents apiece from the mess fund.
–Yes?
–With a clear profit of two cents per egg.
–For whom?
–Sir!
For whomever sells the eggs to the mess.
–And who may that be, Milo?
–Ah, sir…
–Oranges from Marrakech, and pecans…
–Pecans?
And in Palermo, sir, ten thousand gallons of the finest Italian olive oil.
The Sicilians need blankets.
It would be a fair trade.
There's an interested party in Sardinia.
All we need is the co-operation of the countries that we're dealing with.
–What countries?
–The African nations, sir.
Well, the countries in the Greater Mediterranean area.
So, what we have to have is an additional assignment of personnel, a little time and a plane.
–What plane?
–One of ours, sir.
If I had one, I could get the gasoline to Malta and bring the eggs back.
All right, Milo.
And if I was taken off combat duty until I get this thing into operation…
I know, sir, that I'm just an acting mess officer, Colonel, but the job requires my full attention.
It's to everyone's benefit.
–All right, take whatever you need.
–Thank you, sir.
What I hope to do is to give the men the finest cuisine in the entire world.
–That's something to shoot at, isn't it?
–Yes, Milo, it certainly is.
I'd like to show the Colonel something I've had printed up.
–What is it?
–Just an idea, sir. It's a share.
–A share?
–In M&M Enterprises.
If we get my ideas into practice, it should be organised like a mart.
–A mart?
–Yes, sir.
A syndicate. An enterprise. There are tremendous profits to be made, Colonel.
–For us?
–For everyone.
What will be good for M&M Enterprises will be good for the country.
–You'll have our full co-operation, Milo.
–Thank you, sir.
If I could take a plane this afternoon, I'd like to get this materiel to Alexandria.
–There's a huge cotton crop this year.
–Cotton?
Cotton is a particularly liquid commodity.
–How much?
–We'll trade for it.
With what?
Silk! Four thousand yards of silk.
How in the world did you get hold of so much silk?
Where the hell's my parachute?
OK, all right, which one of you bastards stole my parachute?
Hello! Hello, this is the bombardier here.
We gotta turn back.
Nately, we gotta turn back now.
Nately! Do you hear me up there?
We gotta turn back.
OK, we're gonna turn back now.
Nately, let's turn back.
We're gonna turn back!
–What is it this time, Yossarian?
–Some bastard stole my chute!
–Anything the matter?
–My parachute… it's gone!
–Don't worry about it.
–What do you mean?
What do I do if I have to bail out?
Use my handkerchief?
That's the kind of humour in the face of adversity that keeps America strong.
–I like you, Yossarian.
–I'd like to kill you, but I haven't got time.
You could have my chute, but I gave it to Milo.
–You gave it to Milo?!
–He's got all the chutes.
He's got a hell of a deal going for silk in Alexandria.
Maybe I do have time to kill…
–Looks like they've seen us coming.
–They've seen us!
Oh, God, they've seen us!
Better get ready to dump those eggs.
They're shooting at me!
Where are we?
Hey, Aardvark, where are we?
–I think we're there.
–We're there?
We're there?!
We're there, eh?
Get ready to turn!
Four… three…
…two… one…
Drop! Let's go!
Turn right hard!
Turn, turn!
Turn, you son of a bitch! Turn right!
–Turn, turn right!
–Look at that, will you?
I think we got 'em this time.
I think we've got 'em where it hurts.
–I can't hear you.
–Get back in the ship!
What's that?
Climb, you bastard! Climb!
Climb!
Fire!
–Fire on board!
–Where's the fire?
–Get out of the nose!
–I'm not in the nose.
–Speak up. I still can't hear you.
–They're trying to kill us. Get out of here!
–Which way should I go?
–Turn left, you son of a bitch!
Turn left!
Look, there goes Orr.
That stupid little bastard. Pull out!
I think you've caught a little something there.
Is that my leg?
Hey, is that my leg?
–What's with my leg?
–Take it easy.
My leg!
Yossarian's caught one.
–What's that?
–Help him!
–What?
–Help him! Help him!
–Help who?
–Help the bombardier!
–I'm the bombardier, I'm all right.
–Then help him. Help him!
It's…
–What's his name, the new gunner?
–Snowden.
Yeah.
Snowden.
–I'm cold.
–OK.
–You're gonna be OK.
–I'm cold.
I'm cold.
Over here!
Hurry up!
Hey!
–What?
–I asked how you were feeling.
Oh.
Better, thank you.
What about you?
Me?
–Fairly well, thank you.
–You're welcome.
Except for a slight head cold.
Had it for about a week.
Can't seem to shake it.
You know what they're like.
No, I…
I don't.
I've never really had a head cold.
I've tried but…
Can't seem to be able to get one.
Well, you're very lucky.
Yes…
…I suppose I am.
Except for this piece of shrapnel
I caught in my leg.
Yes.
I've… never caught a piece of shrapnel.
You're a chaplain!
Yes. Didn't you know that?
No, I didn't.
I've never really seen a chaplain before.
I had no idea chaplains looked like that.
Well…
Well, if I can do anything to help you, anything at all, you…
Anything?
Like books, or… cigarettes.
Toys?
No, I have everything I need, thank you very much.
–You could do one thing for me.
–What?
–If you could speak to Major Duluth…
–The Squadron Commander?
Tell him I don't want to fly any more.
Cathcart's raised the number of missions again! He's trying to kill us all!
–I can't do it, because I'm desperate!
–It's not my business…
I'm desperate!
I'll see what I can do. I really will.
I'm gonna do my best.
It takes me 45 minutes to do this thing.
First I sauté the chicken parts…
…then I put the raisins and the almonds in.
He, he…
I'm awfully sorry, sir.
–What's your name?
–Major, sir.
I didn't ask your rank, I asked your name.
No, sir. I'm a captain. My name is Major.
Captain Major.
–Just about as clear as mud, isn't it?
–That's what it's just about as clear as.
Listen, Captain.
You're familiar with Major Duluth, the Squadron Commander?
–He's a fine man, sir.
–Was.
–Sir?
–Major Duluth is dead.
–I'm extremely distraught to hear that, sir.
–You may be distraught, but he's dead.
Shot down over Perugia this afternoon.
That'll teach him to go on missions when he's supposed to be in the office.
–Sir, I don't see…
–We need a new squadron commander.
And you're the only major available on our headquarters staff.
No, Major is my name, not my rank.
That's close enough for me, Major.
Consider yourself a major.
I don't know anything about being a commander.
We all have to make sacrifices, Major.
Sir, I'm in Billeting and Laundry!
I know that, sir, but we all have to do our part, I guess.
Well, I don't like my part.
Sergeant, I'm…
I'm going to take the rest of the afternoon off and…
…lie down in my tent and think about things.
Sir, there's someone waiting to see you.
–Now?
–Yes, sir.
–Who is it?
–Captain Tappman, the Group Chaplain.
–What does he want?
–I don't know, sir.
Something to do with Captain Yossarian.
Look… Sergeant…
The job that I have to do is tough enough without having to deal with a lot of people who want something. Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
–I suppose you're wondering about this.
–It's not my place to wonder.
–People stare at me. Did you know that?
–No, sir.
They're thinking,
“Who is that Major Major,”
“that he gets to be commander without ever having flown?”
–I don't think people think that, sir.
–Well, they are.
When I have this on, they don't know who I am.
Did you know, in the Middle Ages, Sergeant, princes and kings would put on disguises and walk around their subjects?
–I didn't know that, sir.
–You don't know everything, then.
–No, sir. Why did they do that?
–Why did who do what?
Why did they walk around in disguise?
How the hell am I supposed to know?
I'm not some historian or anything.
I'm just a guy trying to do his job.
Good afternoon, Sergeant.
Sir?
–What is it now?
–What should I do with the Chaplain?
Sergeant, I don't want anyone to come and see me while I'm in my office.
–What do I say to people?
–Tell them I'm in and ask them to wait.
–For how long?
–Until I've left.
–And then what?
–I don't care.
–May I send them in after you've left?
–Yes.
–You won't be here, then, will you?
–No.
Also, I don't want you coming in while I'm in, asking me if there's anything you can do.
When should I ask if there's anything I can do?
When I'm not there!
–What do I do then?
–Whatever has to be done.
Sergeant, I'm sorry to have to talk to you this way, but I have to.
–Goodbye.
–Goodbye, sir.
–Sergeant!
–Yes, sir?
–Thank you, for everything.
–Thank you, sir.
–The Major will see you now, Father.
–Oh, thank you.
–You don't have to call me Father.
–Sergeant Towser speaking.
Will you go in?
Yes, sir? Have it here, sir.
–There's no one here.
–Where?
In Major Major's office.
–When?
–When you go to see him.
What I mean is you can't see him when he's there.
When he's in his office.
I've tried. Several times.
–When can you see him? Ever?
–Yes, yes…
Yes, indeed, you can see him, when…
…he isn't there.
That is, he'll see you, all right, but only… in his office, and only when he's not there.
The other times, when he's in…
…he's not…
…there… to be seen.
Except when he's out.
What the hell are you talking about, Father?
Get your ass in here, Padre.
Are you describing some mystical experience?
There are some peculiar things happening.
You haven't had any ecstatic visions, have you?
Didn't see a burning bush, hear voices, anything like that?
–Nothing as extraordinary as that, sir.
–I hope not.
We have to keep our supernatural episodes down to a minimum.
–We have a war to win.
–Absolutely, sir.
–May I ask where we're going, sir?
–Where we're going?
You are going to
Colonel Cathcart's office.
–Now?
–That's the general idea, Padre. Now.
Is there anything wrong, sir?
Have I done anything?
I don't know, Padre. Are you and
Captain Yossarian up to something?
–I don't know what you mean.
–Then who does?
I don't know, sir.
You don't know much about anything, do you, Father?
–No, sir. Sir?
–What is it?
It's not necessary to call me Father.
I'm an Anabaptist.
Thanks for the correction.
Thanks for setting me straight on that.
–I just thought you'd like to know…
–You're a captain, right?
–I'm a lieutenant colonel. Correct?
–Yes, sir, it is.
Then I guess I can call you anything I want, unless you have some objections.
–Out!
–Thank you, sir.
Sir, do you think now?
–Morning. Anything I can get you?
–Morning, Lieutenant. What?
–Do you need anything? Any supplies?
–No.
Whiskey, silk stockings, building materials, fresh fruit?
The Colonel loves fresh fruit.
Religious supplies? I can get my hands on a shipment of religious relics.
Blessed by the Pope himself.
The stuff includes the bones of some of your top saints.
That's very kind of you.
If you need anything, just ask for Milo.
–Well, I've never been issued a blanket.
–Anything at all, now!
–Yeah?
–I think the Colonel wants to see me.
–He does?
–I believe so. I'm…
…Chaplain Tappman.
–You're Chaplain Tappman?
Have a seat. I'll tell the Colonel you're here, Father.
It's not…
You'd better get some dry things.
Oh, I will. As soon as the Colonel is through with me.
–They just picked me up out of the sea.
–They did?
–I drifted for almost three days.
–You should report to the hospital.
–You could catch pneumonia.
–Oh, no.
–Not me. This is my fourth time.
–How do you mean?
I've had to put down in the Mediterranean once… once in the Adriatic…
…then I crash-landed one plane, and I bailed out once.
–You're very lucky.
–That's what some folks say.
Yossarian says they're gonna start taking it out of my salary.
–Yossarian?
–He's a friend of mine. Know him?
Yes. As a matter of fact…
–Captain Tappman!
–Yes, sir.
–Perhaps you shouldn't fly any more.
–It's good practice.
–Tappman, the Colonel is a busy man.
–Yes. Yes, of course.
Well, Chaplain, we don't see much of you around here lately.
Well, sir, I try to stay out of the way as much as possible.
I think I make many of the men uncomfortable.
Nonsense!
I can't imagine any man not enjoying the benefits of your presence.
Unless they're atheists.
–Not much chance of that, though.
–I don't know, sir.
–Atheism is against the law, isn't it?
–No.
It isn't?
Well, then it's un-American, isn't it?
–I'm not sure.
–Well, I am.
And if I find any atheists on this base, they'll soon start believing in something.
Well, that's not why
I called you in, Chaplain.
I want you to take a look at this.
Page 48.
Don't read the whole thing. You can get the point from the photographs.
There's a full-page picture of a colonel in England whose chaplain conducts prayers before every mission.
I see no reason why
The Saturday Evening Post should not be interested in the story of my outfit.
Think up some nice snappy prayers that'll send officers out feeling good.
Can you do that?
–I'll try.
–Well, good! Let's get to it!
Yes, sir.
Is there something else?
Sir, it may be none of my business, but I think that some of the men are particularly upset about the fact that you keep raising the number of missions they have to fly.
–You're right, Chaplain.
–I am, sir?
That it's none of your business.
And it's none of their business either.
Their business is to fly missions.
Your business is to think of some catchy prayers that'll get me into The Saturday
Evening Post. Good afternoon!
Yes, sir.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Padre.
He says the men are upset because
I keep raising the number of missions.
–Yossarian.
–What?
It's that Captain Yossarian. He's always bitching, always making trouble.
What can we do about it?
–What would General Dreedle do?
–He'd crush him.
–Tear him apart!
–Smack him in the face!
–Jab him in the kidneys!
–Kick him in the balls!
Keep your head down between your legs.
Try to breathe deeply and evenly.
I'm sorry, Captain.
I know how that must feel.
–I don't think so.
–Try not to talk.
Just think about nice things.
Think about how lovely it is here.
How lovely everything could be if someone didn't always try to spoil it.
–Why do you always try to spoil it?
–Because I love you.
Well, I know that, Captain.
I know that.
But this is wartime.
We've got a job to do, Soldier.
We just can't give in to ourselves.
Think how it is for me: one of a handful of women on an island with thousands of men.
Men who are giving up their lives for our country, for me.
Think of that… Captain Yossarian!
–What are you doing?
–Listen, I'm gonna die.
No, no, no…
What is it?
What's the matter?
The name of the town is Ferrara, and…
…it's right around here.
It's a very pretty town, on the coast.
–You all right?
–It's her, it's her!
–Who?
–Dreedle's WAC!
…if you do your job well, there won't be anything left of it, anyway.
Intelligence reports indicate that you shouldn't have to worry about flak.
We were hoping for some new recon photos of the area.
Unfortunately, they haven't arrived, but as I always say: no news is good news.
You may ask yourselves how come we're to destroy a town with no industry, no enemy bases, no strategic value to anyone…
Ten-hut!
As you were. Good morning, gentlemen.
We're honoured to have General Dreedle sitting in on today's briefing.
Don't pay any attention to me.
Just carry on as usual.
–Don't pay any attention to Dad. Just…
–Will you clam up?
Don't call me Dad.
–Go right ahead with your briefing, Major.
–Yes… well…
Thank you, sir.
I was just telling the men here that we…
–Don't tell me; tell them!
–Tell the men, Danby.
Yes. I was just explaining why we're going to obliterate…
–What about a chair?
–Sir?
–A chair.
–I beg your pardon, General?
A chair!
Doesn't anyone know what a chair is?!
–Can't you see a lady is standing?
–A chair for Dad's gir… for the lady!
Carry on.
We're now going to synchronise our watches.
Now, we've all done this before, so I don't think we're going to have any problem.
If everyone will be kind enough to look down at his wristwatch, we can begin.
It is now 11.15 hours minus 50…
Yossarian!
Somebody's gonna get it!
All right, at ease!
There'll be no more moaning in this outfit.
The next man who moans is going to be very sorry.
…one!
Who is this man?
–Major Danby, sir.
–Danby. D-a-n-b-y.
–Take him out and shoot him.
–Sir?
–I said take him out and shoot him.
–Yes, sir.
Take Major Danby out and shoot him.
–I think you'd better wait a minute, Dad.
–What?
–I don't think you can shoot him.
–Why the hell can't I?
Why not?
You mean I can't shoot whoever I want to?
–Is that a fact?
–I'm afraid it is, Dad.
You think you're pretty smart, don't you, Moodus?
Just because my daughter married you for God knows what bizarre reason…
Oh, no, Dad, it's…
Let the insubordinate son of a bitch go, but get him out of here.
–Better do something.
–All right, men. I think we…
…owe a vote of thanks to the General for visiting with us and cheering us all up.
In his honour, I'd like to make an announcement which may be of interest.
–You're all anxious to do your part…
–Here it comes.
As of now, the number of missions required before you are eligible for rotation is raised to 75.
I know we'll all do our best.
Ten-hut!
–Why are you smiling, you silly bastard?
–Now I won't have to go home.
–You what?
–I can stay. I don't have to leave her.
–What are you saying?
–I love her.
I do.
I really do. I've never felt like this before, not even for my mom.
Men don't fall in love with girls like that.
Men always fall in love with girls like that.
One or the other.
I'm gonna take her back to Long Island with me.
You don't really love her.
You think you love her.
How can you tell the difference between loving her and thinking he's in love?
You have to be objective.
–Who's objective?
–I am, because I'm not in love with her.
You mean you think you're not in love?
Then how can you tell the difference?
Wait a second…
Hey, look!
–Ooh, look what Aarfy's got.
–Say goodbye, McWatt. Come on!
My dear… My dear, we had a lovely day.
Did you see what he did?
Make him tell you what he did.
–What'd you do, Aarfy?
–Nothing.
–Nice girl. Very nice girl.
–She wanted us to go home with her.
–She was gonna show us a good time.
–We had a good time.
We saw the Colosseum and other swell sights.
–Why didn't you take her home?
–I won't take advantage of a kid.
–Old Aarfy's got some principles.
–You've got a diseased mind.
She just wanted to jump in the sack with somebody.
She's mixed up.
I gave her a good talking to.
He did!
I straightened her out and sent her home.
–You crazy bastard!
–You're beneath contempt.
–He's got a dirty mind, hasn't he?
–I don't see it that way.
They want us to go home with them.
–For how much?
–Who's the little runt?
–Nately's whore's kid sister.
I wanna spend some time with my girl.
I'll pay for all of us.
Give her the 30 bucks and send the other two away.
She'll be angry with me for making her work for her money.
She said that if I really loved her, I'd send her away and sleep with the other two.
I swear, you fellas…!
Come on, Yossarian, let's go!
Go on, you go.
–What's wrong?
–What isn't wrong?
–Two more missions and we go home.
–You know what's gonna happen.
No. A whole bunch of replacement pilots came into Naples yesterday.
–Who says?
–Milo.
He just came from there with loads of coconuts.
We'll never see those replacements.
We'll never see those coconuts.
Cathcart wouldn't dare raise the number again.
Who's gonna stop him?
Somebody will.
Come on!
Nately!
Nately, wait for me!
All right.
I want to get this clear.
As I understand it, we're giving these men medals for doing a lousy job.
–Is that right?
–Not quite, Dad.
When I want an answer from you,
I'll look at you.
–General, I think I can explain it.
–You'd better.
Yesterday's mission was to bomb a town called Ferrara.
–Why Ferrara?
–What do you mean, “Why Ferrara?”
–Do you know what Ferrara is?
–It's a town on a hill.
–Do you know what's in that town?
–Five minutes to target.
–What's in it?
–Nothing.
Nothing's in it.
No Germans, no munitions.
No railroad crossing, no harbour, nothing.
–Nothing at all?
–No.
Except people. Italian people.
And a monastery.
Yossarian, maybe it's some kind of strategy thing.
–What the hell are we doing?
–It's not our business to ask.
–Whose business is it?
–Four minutes to target.
–Are you ready to take us in, Yossarian?
–Get ready to dump.
–We're not there yet!
–Get away from there, Aardvark!
Come on, Yossarian, you'll screw up the whole mission!
–Get ready to turn!
–What are you doing?
–Cut it out, Yossarian!
–Get ready to turn!
A direct hit… on the ocean?
Yes, sir. A marvellous bomb pattern.
We have aerial photographs if you'd like to see them.
Are we decorating men who've dropped 20 tons of bombs…
…on the Mediterranean?
–Sir, if you consider the alternative…
The alternative is that we take the whole crew and shoot 'em.
–Might be a problem there, sir.
–All right, I know.
If we can't shoot the bastards, we can court-martial them.
See that they rot in some stockade.
Well, sir, we felt that a court martial might get unavoidable publicity.
And if it got around that we used one of our missions to bomb the ocean…
You don't have to say anything more, Colonel.
Ten-hut!
“For distinguished duty in the face of overwhelming… something…”
–Odds.
–“…odds…”
“…this Air Medal is awarded to Captain J S…”
–McWatt.
–“…McWatt.”
Come on, come on.
All right, McWatt. What are you waiting for, a kiss? Get back in there.
And on the double!
“For meritorious action”
“in the face of concentrated enemy fire, Captain…”
–What's this?
–Come on, Dumbo.
–Yossarian, sir.
–“…Yossarian.”
Unless I miss my guess, Captain…
…you're out of uniform.
What are you looking at?
Get back in the car, you smirking slut.
Why aren't you wearing clothes, Captain?
–I don't want to.
–Why the hell don't you?
I dunno. I just don't want to.
–Why isn't he wearing clothes?
–He's talking to you.
–Why isn't he wearing clothes, Major?
–Why isn't he, Sergeant?
A man was killed in his plane and bled all over him.
His clothes are in the laundry.
–Where are his other uniforms?
–In the laundry, sir.
–Where is his underwear?
–In the laundry, sir.
–That sounds like a lot of crap to me.
–It is a lot of crap, sir.
Sir, this man will be punished severely!
What the hell do I care?
If he wants to get his medal without any clothes on, what business is it of yours?
–My sentiments exactly, sir.
–Here's your medal, Captain.
You're a very weird person, Yossarian.
Thank you, sir.
–You are giving me this?
–Yes.
–Perché?
–Because you're beautiful.
Because your name is Luciana.
It was my mother's name.
But my real name is Eleonora Rosanna.
I only call myself Luciana.
My mother only called herself Luciana.
Her real name was Eleonora Rosanna.
I don't believe you.
I don't blame you.
What you get this for?
–Will you believe me if I tell the truth?
–Yes.
I was awarded that particular medal for killing fish.
–You have killed many fish?
–Oh, yes, I am one of the biggest…
In fact, I am the most renowned killer of fish in the US Army Air Force.
OK.
I dance with you, but I won't let you sleep with me.
–Who asked you?
–You don't want to sleep with me?
–I don't wanna dance with you.
–You crazy.
–Watch where you put your hands, GI.
–My name is Yossarian.
Watch where you put your hands,
Yossarian.
It's…
What's his name, the new gunner?
–Snowden.
–Yeah.
Snowden.
–I'm cold.
–OK.
You're gonna be OK.
Cold… cold.
–There.
–Starting to hurt me.
OK, hang on. I'll get you some morphine.
Milo! You prick!
Hi! What's up?
Hey, it's good to see you.
When did you get out of the hospital?
We've got a couple of things to talk over.
How you feeling? I'm sorry I didn't visit but I've been in Naples.
–I wanna know about that parachute.
–What parachute?
The one I'm supposed to use to jump out of the plane.
Ah, that parachute!
You have to remember that your parachute was just one of 50 or 60 parachutes taken over by the Syndicate.
I don't give a damn about the Syndicate!
I don't want your tomatoes!
They're not my tomatoes; they're the
Syndicate's tomatoes. Our tomatoes.
Just as these are our statues. In fact…
…that's where all the parachutes went.
–You traded my parachute for statues?
–Well, no, in point of fact.
I traded our diesel engines for the statues.
–I don't have any engines!
–Not “your”, I said “our”.
I got the engines for two planeloads of lumber, 100 pairs of shoes, and the parachutes.
The men won't be happy when they find out what you've been doing.
Don't they understand?
We're gonna come out of this war rich.
You're gonna come out rich.
We're gonna come out dead!
–What does he want?
–Who?
Hungry Joe.
What is the matter?
I got a feeling.
–I think it is.
–What?
–Come on.
–What is it?
I don't know, but if it is what I think it is…
It's just McWatt.
I know. That bastard's been doing it to me for months. He's jealous of her.
–Because she likes you better?
–No. She likes him better.
–Then why doesn't she go out with him?
–Because she can't stand him!
–Good old McWatt.
–What's good about him?
He's carrying me on his manifest.
Every time he goes up, he files my name as a passenger.
I get my flight pay without having to do anything stupid like going up in a plane.
–Look!
–What is he saying?
He's coming back!
–Who was it?
–Hungry Joe.
We'll have to requisition a new photographer from Group.
Is there anything…
…I can do?
McWatt's still up there.
Doc Daneeka's up there, too.
I'm right here.
Come on down, McWatt.
Probably afraid to come down.
He knows what kind of trouble he's in.
–He cut his engine.
–McWatt!
Why doesn't Daneeka jump?
He's got a chute.
I'm right here, Sergeant.
I'm not in the plane.
Jump, Doc, jump!
Jump. Jump, Doc…
Please, jump.
Jump.
Jump.
Poor Hungry Joe.
Poor McWatt.
Poor Doc.
Yeah.
Poor Doc.
I'll need a full report on this,
Captain Yossarian.
Yossarian?
I haven't seen you in some time.
Not since…
–Snowden's funeral.
–Snowden.
Do you want to say something, sir?
What?
I just wondered if you wanted to say anything.
No… No, no, I didn't actually know the young fellow.
It was his first mission.
–Did you know him, Danby?
–No, I don't think I ever heard the name.
What was it?
–Snowden, I think.
–Oh, yes.
Well, I'll… just read something.
Yes, you… you do that.
–Something wrong?
–No, no.
I just thought I saw something.
–A naked man in the tree?
–Yes, that's it.
–That's just Yossarian.
–Oh…
Well, in that case…
“The Lord is my shepherd.”
“I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures…”
Hey!
–I've been looking all over for you.
–You should've looked for me here.
I don't want to butt in, but why aren't you wearing your uniform?
I don't want to.
Yossarian, I want you to do something for me.
I want to serve this to the men.
Taste it and let me know what you think.
–What is it?
–Chocolate-covered cotton.
–Are you crazy?
–No good?
You didn't take the seeds out!
–Is it really that bad?
–It's… it's cotton!
–They've got to learn to like it.
–Why?
I saw a chance to corner the market in cotton. I didn't know there'd be a glut.
I've got warehouses full of it all over Europe. I can't get rid of it.
People eat cotton candy. This is better, it's made out of real cotton.
–People can't eat cotton!
–They've got to. It's for the Syndicate.
It will make them sick.
Try it yourself if you don't believe me.
I did, and it made me sick.
Look. Looks like a funeral.
They're burying the kid that got killed in my plane.
–What happened to him?
–He got killed.
–What?
–I said he got killed.
I'm sorry.
–He was your friend?
–Maybe. I don't know.
–He was very old.
–But he was a boy.
Well, he died. You don't get any older than that.
–Where do you work?
–I'm not a whore.
I didn't say you were.
–I work in big American company.
–Me, too!
You want to see me again? Why?
Why not?
You think I'm beautiful?
–I think you're perfect.
–That's not true.
–It is true.
–No.
See this?
Jesus, how did you?
Air raid.
–Germans?
–Americani.
You do not want me now?
What are you talking about?
I want you now.
–I want you to marry me.
–You crazy.
–Why?
–You can't want to marry me.
–Why not?
–I'm not a virgin.
–So what?
–Nobody wants a girl who is not a virgin.
I do. I wanna marry you.
Not possible… Because you're crazy.
–Why am I crazy?
–Because you want to marry me.
You won't marry me because I'm crazy;
I'm crazy because I wanna marry you?
–You're crazy.
–Why?
Because I love you.
Ti amo. Ti amo molto.
How can you love a girl who is not a virgin?
Because I can't marry you.
Why you can't marry me?
Because I'm not a virgin?
–No, because you're crazy!
–You're crazy!
–You all crazy!
–Why are we crazy?
Because you don't know how to stay alive.
And that's the secret of life.
But we have a war to win.
But America will lose the war;
Italy will win it.
America's the strongest nation on earth.
The American fighting man is the best trained, the best equipped, the best fed.
Exactly. Italy, on the other hand, is one of the weakest nations on earth.
The Italian fighting man is hardly equipped at all.
That's why my country is doing so well, while your country is doing so poorly.
That's silly! First Italy was occupied by the Germans, and now by us.
–You call that doing well?
–Of course I do.
The Germans are being driven out, and we are still here.
In a few years, you'll be gone, and we will still be here.
You see, Italy is a very poor, weak country, and that is what makes us so strong.
Strong enough to survive this war and still be in existence…
…long after your country has been destroyed.
What are you talking about?
America's not going to be destroyed.
Never?
–Well…
–Rome was destroyed.
Greece was destroyed.
Persia was destroyed.
Spain was destroyed.
All great countries are destroyed.
Why not yours?
How much longer do you think your country will last?
Forever?
Well, forever is a long time, I guess.
Very long.
Ciao!
Please, we're talking.
–We go to bed now?
–No.
Would you go put some clothes on?
You're practically naked.
I wish she wouldn't walk around like that.
It is her business to walk around like that.
–But it's not nice.
–Of course it's nice.
She's nice to look at.
This life is not nice.
I don't want her to do this.
–When we go to America, Nately?
–When we go to America, Nately?
You will take her to America?
Away from a healthy, active life?
Away from good business opportunities?
Away from her friends?
–Don't you have any principles?
–Of course not.
No morality?
I'm a very moral man.
And Italy is a very moral country.
That's why we will certainly come out on top again, if we succeed in being defeated.
–You talk like a madman.
–But I live like a sane one.
I was a Fascist when Mussolini was on top.
Now that he has been deposed,
I am anti-Fascist.
When the Germans were here,
I was fanatically pro-German.
Now I'm fanatically pro-America!
You'll find no more loyal partisan in all of Italy than myself.
You're a shameful opportunist!
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
You have it backwards.
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.
I know.
How do you know?
Because I am 107 years old.
How old are you?
I'll be 20 in January.
If you live.
–Ciao, Yossarian.
–How are ya, how are ya?
We gotta go back.
All the leaves have been cancelled.
Hello, my dear.
You give me a dollar? I pay you back when we get to America.
Just one… Just one.
One! Gimme that.
Come on, Dobbs.
Milo's gonna fly us back.
–Why are the leaves cancelled?
–I don't know.
Milo says the base is on some kind of alert.
Oh, yeah… Cathcart raised the number of missions to 80.
–Yeah.
He's mad because Captain Orr lost another aeroplane.
–Where?
–Ditched coming back from Bologna.
Went down in the Mediterranean.
Air-Sea Rescue out there?
Yeah. They picked up everybody but Orr.
Will you fellas stay away from the airstrip tonight?
What for?
Just do as I say.
Stay in your tents.
Why?
–There it is.
–What?
Orr's plane!
He'll find his way back. He always does.
He'll turn up. He'll sneak in with that rat-toothed giggle.
Aarfy, if anything happens to me, will you take care of my girl?
Listen to him: his girl!
–Yossarian?
–Don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen to you that won't happen to the rest of us.
Orr?
Orr?
Orr?
Orr.
–I'll be through in a minute.
–No, you won't. You always say that.
And then I gotta watch you fit some thing into that masterpiece of junk.
Then I guess you haven't seen it.
What? You guess I haven't seen what?
A little square gasket, about this big.
–Have you seen it?
–No.
–Then I'll have to start all over again.
–Please don't do that.
–Why?
–Because it gives me a terrible pain.
Why?
–Why what?
–Why won't you fly with me?
What's that got to do with the pain that you and your bolts give me?
It's got everything to do with it.
Are you trying to tell me something?
Just… that if you were smart, you'd fly with me.
–You've already cracked up three planes.
–Four.
I'm a good pilot.
–I don't want to end up in the ocean.
–You'll thank me.
–For getting me drowned?
–For finishing this stove.
Winter's coming.
You'll have heat, hot water…
You'll be able to boil eggs and everything.
–Where are you gonna be?
–I dunno…
Here and there.
No one wants to fly with you.
You're a one-man disaster area.
–They're crazy.
–I agree with them.
You're crazy.
Orr?
Orr?
–Orr?
–He's dead.
–Who's “he”?
–He's just a kid from my home town.
He just died. They came from the States to see him.
–Get in the bed, will you?
–What?
His mother, father and brother flew out here. They know he's dying.
–What do you want me to do?
–Be him.
Just for a few minutes.
They came 5,000 miles to see you before you die.
–I'm not dying!
–Of course you're dying. We're all dying.
They'll know. They came to see their son.
This is what they get. One dying boy is just as good as another. Or as bad!
–It won't work.
–These people have come a long way.
I don't want to disappoint them.
I'm sentimental about old people.
–What if they start crying?
–They probably will start crying.
I'll wait outside the door, and if it gets sticky, I'll come in and break it up.
It won't work.
Do this for me and I'll do something for you.
–Will you ground me?
–I can't.
You can fill out a slip that says
I'm on the verge of a nervous collapse.
Sure I can.
But there's a catch.
–Catch-22.
–Yes.
Group isn't going to approve my action.
They'll put you back on combat status and send me to rot in the Pacific.
–Oh, my God, here they are.
–Start dying.
Do this for me and I'll send you to Rome on a five-day R and R.
He looks terrible.
–He's sick, Pa.
–Harvey.
My name is Yossarian.
His name is Yossarian, Ma.
Yossarian… don't you recognise me?
I'm your brother John.
Don't you know who I am?
–Sure I do. You're my brother John.
–Pa, he knows me.
Yossarian, look, here's Papa.
–Say hello to Papa.
–Hello, Papa.
Hello, Harvey.
His name is Yossarian, Pa.
–He looks so bad.
–He's very sick.
The doctor says he's gonna die.
Harvey?
Ma, his name is Yossarian.
She doesn't remember things too good.
It's OK.
She can call me Harvey if she wants to.
Harvey.
–Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
–I know.
We came from New York. We were afraid we wouldn't get here in time.
–In time for what?
–To see you before you died.
What difference would it make?
We didn't want you to die by yourself.
What difference would it make?
He's getting delirious. He keeps saying the same thing over and over again.
–Harvey!
–It's not Harvey, it's Yossarian.
What difference does it make?
He's dying.
Listen, kid…
It's not bad.
I'm gonna put a tourniquet on it.
There. It's good.
It's a good bandage.
Cold.
Cold…
It's gonna be OK, kid.
We'll be home soon.
–Does the leg still hurt?
–No.
Yossarian?
You in there?
Orr?
–Is that Orr, you son of a bitch?
–It's me, Nately.
Nately. What's happening?
Jesus, it's 3.30 in the morning.
It's Dobbs, we've got to stop him.
–What for?
–He's gonna kill the Colonel.
–Cathcart?
–Yes.
Dobbs is gonna kill Colonel Cathcart?
–What's the matter with you?
–It's the first sane thing I've ever done!
–They'll get you for murder!
–Old Cathcart's the murderer!
–Come on, gimme the gun!
–Take it easy.
–You've just got a few more missions.
–You're crazy!
He'll raise the number again, and you know it!
He'll keep us flying missions till we're all dead.
What do you care? You wanna stay
'cause you're in love with that whore.
You happen to be talking about my fiancée.
The fiancée of any guy with ten bucks in his pocket who doesn't mind risking a dose of several diseases for 15 minutes of phoney moans on a dirty mattress!
Nately!
Nately?
Nately!
Yossarian.
I think I hurt him.
He'll be all right.
Here he comes!
–Gimme the gun!
–No, no, listen!
If he raises the number again,
I swear I'll help you kill him!
–Really?
–I swear.
Well, that's very reasonable of you.
–Something's going on.
–What do you mean?
Milo and the Colonel are up to something.
They've been planning something.
–What's he doing?
–Something. I dunno.
Why didn't they turn their lights on?
What the fuck…!
Yossarian, listen!
What is this?
Look!
Jesus Christ!
Run, run, run!
All right, number 1 and 2, that was good.
–Thank you. What shall I do now, Milo?
–Bank left and wait for instructions.
All right, Number 3. Be careful not to hit our storehouses at the end of the field.
Direct hit on the mess hall, if you please.
And Number 3…
Hold on, Number 3.
Yossarian, get off the field.
Take cover, Yossarian. You, too,
Dobbs. Right, Number 3, let 'em go.
Bastards! Get out of there!
Yossarian, cut that out; those are our men you're shooting at. Take cover.
This is an M&M Enterprises operation.
Number 4 and 5, Number 3 did not get those supply sheds.
I told you men to come in low.
Let's get right on target this time.
Shoddy work will not do.
Dobbs!
What are you doing, Yossarian?
Get off the field!
I want to see you later. You're confined to the base. I won't forget this.
–The Air Force won't forget about this.
–Don't be ridiculous!
What's good for M&M is good for the Air Force.
–There goes the bomb dump!
–We had to get rid of that cotton.
The Germans promised to take it off our hands if we ran this mission for them.
–It's all part of the deal.
–There goes the Officers' Club!
You made a deal with the Germans?
A contract is a contract.
That's what we're fighting for.
Lieutenant Minderbinder speaking.
Will you clear the field, please?
Following this bomb run, we will begin to strafe.
–Strafe?!
–It's all part of the contract.
There goes Headquarters!
Nately!
Nately!
Nately!
Nately!
–What's that?
–He said, “Nately”.
–Nately is dead.
–I know that.
–Who's dead?
–You're not.
You will be if we don't get at that knife wound.
–What's happening?
–We're operating.
We're gonna take a little look inside you.
We're gonna clean you out and stitch you up.
Hey…
Yossarian.
We've got your pal.
You heard me.
We've got your pal.
Who's my pal?
–What's he saying?
–Something about his pal.
–Who's his pal?
–I don't know; maybe it's Nately.
Nately's dead.
I know.
I wouldn't go in there.
Something's happened.
I gotta go find Nately's whore.
I gotta tell her he's dead.
Wanna come with me?
Not now. I promised her some stockings and cigarettes.
For her family. I know them.
First-class people.
OK.
–I'll see you later.
–Sure.
Andiamo?
Yes, yes, we're going. Up to my room.
You better get off the streets soon.
It's almost curfew; you don't have a pass.
–What happened?
–Gone. All gone.
–Who?
–All the poor young girls.
All gone. Taken away.
Who? Who took 'em away?
The white-hats.
The white-hats… The MPs?
Yes, the MPs.
Where did they take 'em?
Who knows? All gone.
–Where's the old man?
–Gone.
–Gone where?
–Dead.
What?
He was alive one minute, then he was dead.
He can't be.
Why not?
–Where did they take the girls?
–I don't know.
They just came in and took them.
They must have had a reason.
They couldn't just drag 'em away.
No reason.
–What right did they have?
–Catch-22.
What? What did you say?
Catch-22.
How do you know it was Catch-22?
The girls said,
“Why are you taking us away?”
The men said, “Catch-22”.
The girls said, “What right do you have?”
The men said, “Catch-22”.
All they kept saying was,
”Catch-22. Catch-22″.
–What does it mean?
–Didn't they show it to you?
–Didn't you ask them to read it to you?
–They don't have to show us Catch-22.
–Who says so?
–The law says so.
What law?
Catch-22.
Milo! Milo!
Milo, I'm gonna kill you, you murdering son of a bitch!
Take it easy, don't hurt him.
I know how you feel, but it wasn't my fault.
–Who's fault was it?
–No one's.
Nately was the victim of certain economic pressures. The laws of supply and…
You unbelievable bastard!
–Do you want me to take you to her?
–Who?
Nately's whore.
Aren't you looking for her?
–Do you know where she is?
–Of course I do.
You're AWOL, Yossarian.
I thought you knew better than that.
–Nately wouldn't do anything that dumb.
–He's dead.
–Too bad. He was nice.
–One of yours made a direct hit on him.
He died a rich man.
He had over 60 shares in the Syndicate.
–He's dead.
–His family will get it.
–He didn't have a family.
–Then his parents get it.
They don't need it, they're rich.
Then they'll understand.
Ask for number 33.
Hello, Yossarian.
–I didn't know.
–That I work for Milo?
–Everybody works for Milo.
–Yeah.
Well, he told me to ask for number 33.
$10, please.
No towel, Yossarian?
–Hello, Yossarian.
–Hi, kid.
–Where's your sister?
–In there.
–You give me a dollar?
–Yeah.
–We go to America soon?
–Sure, kid.
–Ciao, Yossarian.
–Hi.
–You make love now?
–No, no. Listen…
–I have to tell you something.
–Nately?
Yeah.
–He's coming?
–No, not exactly.
We go to America soon?
Yeah. Listen…
When we go?
Listen…
Nately's dead.
Brutto.
Brutto!
–T'ammazzo!
–It wasn't me.
–It's not my fault!
–T'ammazzo! Assassino!
He was my friend, you dumb bitch!
Assassino!
–I only raped her once.
–You killed her.
I had to after I raped her. I couldn't let her go around saying bad things about me.
Why did you touch her at all?
Why not get a girl off the streets?
Not me.
I never paid for it in my life.
–Come on, get back, get back!
–Back up, folks.
Aarfy, are you insane?
They're gonna throw you in jail.
You just killed a girl.
She's lying out there in the street!
She has no right to be there, you know.
It's after curfew.
Don't you realise what you've done?
You've murdered a human being!
They can hang you!
I don't think they'll do that.
Not to good old Aarfy.
They won't make a fuss over one Italian girl when thousands of lives are lost every day.
Aarfy, they're coming to arrest you.
You can't take the life of another human being and get away with it!
They're coming to get you!
–Captain Yossarian?
–Yes.
–You're under arrest.
–But I didn't…
You're AWOL.
–We're sending you home.
–What?
I said we're sending you home.
You have been making things terribly difficult for Colonel Cathcart.
The men are unhappy.
Morale is deteriorating. It's all your fault.
It's his fault for raising the number of missions.
–It's your fault for not flying.
–Have you no patriotism?
Wouldn't you give your life for your country? For Colonel Korn and me?
What have you and Colonel Korn got to do with my country?
You're a disgrace to your country!
How did you get to be a captain?
–You promoted me.
–That has got nothing to do with it!
Let me. Let me…
Captain,
I'd like to appeal to your better judgement one more time.
There's a mission about to start.
You can get on that plane, and we'll pretend that all of this never happened.
Yossarian, won't it make you proud to know you served in an outfit that averaged more combat missions per person than any other?
Don't you want to earn more unit citations and oak-leaf clusters on your Air Medal?
Don't you want to contribute further to this record by flying more missions?
No.
In that case we'll just have to send you home.
Of course, there's one catch.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Well, we will issue orders sending you back to the States, and there's… one thing you have to do for us in return.
What would that be?
Like us.
Like you?
Like us.
You'll be surprised how easy it is to like us once you begin.
We're going to put you on Easy Street.
–Promote you to major.
–Give you another medal.
–We're going to send you home a hero.
–You'll have parades in your honour.
You can make speeches, raise money for war bonds…
And all you have to do is be our pal.
Say nice things about us.
Tell the folks at home what a good job we're doing.
Take our offer, Yossarian.
It's either that or a court martial for desertion.
What about the others? I'd be playing a dirty trick on them.
–They'll be happier when you're gone.
–They have a war to win.
If they don't want any more missions, let them stand up and say so.
Precisely.
Exactly.
It's a deal.
Assassino!
Help!
Help!
Help him!
–What?
–Help him! Help him!
–Help who?
–Help the bombardier!
–I'm the bombardier, I'm all right.
–Then help him. Help him!
I'm cold.
I'm cold.
It's gonna be OK, kid.
We'll be home soon.
–Does the leg still hurt?
–No.
There, there…
There, there.
There, there.
–May we come in?
–Sure.
–I see you're all alone.
–Yeah.
Well, you're going home.
–I don't know if I am.
–Sure you are.
I've your orders here. That parade they're rehearsing is for you.
You're a hero.
And you're gonna get a medal for stopping that Nazi from killing Cathcart.
That wasn't a Nazi.
That was Nately's whore.
She tried to kill me because I told her about Nately.
–But the Colonel said that it…
–It's a deal I made with them.
They send me home a hero, and I say wonderful things about them back home.
That's a lousy deal, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Well…
Isn't it?
I don't know,
I'm not here to judge you.
What are you here for?
I'm not too sure about that either.
What would you do if you were me?
I don't know. I mean, I'm… not you.
Imagine that you are me.
That's hard.
Sometimes I even have trouble imagining that I'm me, if you know what I mean.
I'm gonna call the deal off.
Let them send me home for flying over
50 missions, not for being stubborn.
Then they'd have to send home every man.
–That's their problem.
–No.
It's your problem, because they'll court-martial you.
–Make the best of a bad situation.
–No.
No what?
I've been lying in this bed for three weeks now thinking about it, and all I know is
I don't want to go to prison, and I can't play Cathcart's game.
Well…
–What else can you do?
–I can run away.
–You'll… desert?
–Why not?
How'd you get off the base?
That's insane.
That's why it's the only sensible thing to do.
They'll call you a coward.
It's your country.
Oh, Christ, Danby.
I've flown 55 missions.
I've fought for my country for three years, now I'll fight for myself.
–Suppose everyone felt that way?
–I'd be a fool to feel any different.
What would your friends say?
I haven't got any.
Nately was blown to bits.
McWatt killed himself.
Hungry Joe was chopped in two.
Dobbs disappeared.
Aardvark's a murderer.
Doc Daneeka's a zombie.
They're all gone.
The only friend I had was Snowden, and I didn't even know him.
What about Orr?
Orr's at the bottom of the sea.
No, he isn't. Don't you know?
–Know what?
–Orr is in Sweden.
What?
After 16 weeks at sea, Captain Orr was found by Swedish girl scouts.
–A miracle.
–He rowed all the way.
–He rowed?
–In that tiny little raft.
Think of that, all the way to Sweden!
–He'll sit out the rest of the war.
–It's a miracle!
It's no miracle. He has to have planned it.
–He went to Sweden deliberately?
–It's 3 or 4 thousand miles away!
He said that crash-landing was good practice.
–Planning it all this time.
–Practising getting shot down at sea.
On every mission that he flew!
No, no, no, that is a miracle.
Practising getting shot down…
…in the sea!
He made it?
He made it?
He made it!
That son of a bitch made it!
Are you crazy? Is he crazy?
If he made it, so can I!
–We gotta stop him.
–I can do it, Danby!
–They'll catch you!
–I can do it!
–This is insane!
–I can do it!
–What about your clothes?
–They won't recognise me out of uniform.
You'll be on the run with no friends.
You'll live in danger of betrayal!
Ha-ha! I live that way now.
–Yossarian, for God's sake, hurry up!
–So long, Chaplain.
–How do you feel, Yossarian?
–Fine… Except I'm scared to death.
–Keep on your toes every minute.
–I'll keep on my toes.
–You'll have to jump.
–I'll jump.
Jump!
