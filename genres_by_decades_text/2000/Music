What came first?
The music or the misery?
People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos... that some sort of culture of violence will take them over.
Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands... of songs about heartbreak, rejection... pain, misery and loss.
Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable?
Or was I miserable because
I listened to pop music?
You don't have to go this second.
- You can stay until whenever.
- No.
- We've done the hard part now, I might as well just--
- Stay for tonight, then.
Laura--
You're just gonna--
My desert island, all-time top five... most memorable breakups, in chronological order... are as follows:
Alison Ashmore,
Penny Hardwick...
Jackie Alden, Charlie Nicholson and Sarah Kendrew.
Those were the ones that really hurt.
Can you see your name on that list, Laura?
Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten.
But there's just no room for you in the top five. Sorry!
Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliation you're just not capable of delivering.
If you really wanted to mess me up... you should have gotten to me earlier!
Which brings us to number one on the top five all-time breakup list:
Alison Ashmore.
♪ Candy on the beach
There's nothing better ♪
One moment they weren't there-- not in any form that interested us, anyway-- and then the next, you couldn't miss them.
They were everywhere.
And they'd grown breasts.
- And we wanted--
- ♪ I want candy ♪
Actually, we didn't even know what we wanted.
- ♪ I want candy ♪
- But it was something interesting.
Disturbing, even.
My relationship with Alison Ashmore lasted for six hours: the two hours after school, before The Rockford Files... for three days in a row.
But on the fourth afternoon--
Kevin Bannister.
Slut.
It would be nice to think that since I was 14, times have changed.
Relationships have become more sophisticated.
Females less cruel.
Skins thicker.
Instincts more developed.
But there seems to be an element of that afternoon in everything that's happened to me since.
All my romantic stories are a scrambled version of that first one.
Number two on the top five all-time breakup list... was Penny Hardwick.
Penny was great looking, and her top five recording artists... were Carly Simon, Carole King,
James Taylor, Cat Stevens... and Elton John.
♪ I remember when rock was young ♪
- ♪ Me and Susie had so much fun ♪
- Erin! No, come here!
♪ Holdin'hands and skippin'stones ♪
She was nice.
Nice manners, nice grades, nice looking--
She was so nice, in fact, that she wouldn't let me put my hand... underneath or even on top of her bra.
Attack and defense.
Invasion and repulsion.
It was as if breasts were little pieces of property... that had been unlawfully annexed by the opposite sex.
They were rightfully ours, and we wanted them back.
- ♪ Crimson and clover ♪ - Sometimes I got so bored of trying to touch her breast... that I would try to touch her between her legs.
It was like trying to borrow a dollar, getting turned down, and asking for 50 grand instead.
I wasn't interested in
Penny's nice qualities, just breasts.
And therefore, she was no good to me.
What's the point?
It never goes anywhere.
Rob?
I started dating a girl who everyone said would give it up and who didn't... and Penny went with this asshole named Chris Thompson... who told me he had sex with her after something like three dates.
I own this store called Championship Vinyl.
It's located in a neighborhood that attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers.
I get by because of the people who make a special effort to shop here.
Mostly young men... who spend all their time looking for deleted Smith singles... and original, not re-released, underlined, Frank Zappa albums.
Fetish properties are not unlike porn.
I'd feel guilty taking their money, if I wasn't... well, kind of one of them.
- Morning, Dick.
- Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.
Have a good weekend?
Yeah, okay. Um, I found the first Licorice
Comfits album over at Vintage Vinyl.
The one on Testament of Youth.
Never released here, a Japanese import only.
Great. Great.
- I'll tape it for you.
- No, that's okay. Really.
You liked their second one, you said.
Pop Girls, etc.
That's the one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.
Oh, you never saw the cover, though.
You just had that tape I made you.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one yet.
Well...
- I'll just make it for you.
- Okay.
- Dick, what's this?
- It's the new Belle and Sebastian. You like it?
Holy Shiite.
What the fuck is that?
It's the new Belle and Sebastian--
It's a record we've been listening to and enjoying, Barry.
Well, that's unfortunate, because it sucks ass.
Yours, I assume?
♪ Mm, yeah ♪
♪ I used to think maybe you loved me ♪
♪ Now, baby, I'm sure ♪
- Turn it off, Barry!
- ♪ And I just can't wait till the day ♪
- It won't go any louder.
- Turn it off!
♪ Now every time I go for the mailbox ♪
♪ I hold myself down ♪
♪ 'Cause I just can't wait till you ride me or--♪
Okay, buddy.
Uh--
I was just trying to cheer us up.
So, go ahead.
Put on some old sad bastard music.
See if I care.
I don't want to hear old sad bastard music, Barry.
- I just want something I can ignore.
- Here's the thing.
I made that tape special for today, my special Monday morning tape for you, special.
It's fuckin' Monday afternoon!
You should get out of bed earlier.
Come on, dude.
Play it. Don't you want to hear what's next?
- What's next?
- Play it!
Say it.
"Little Latin Loopy-Loo."
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
No!
- The Righteous Brothers.
- Well, never mind.
No, not "never mind." Tell me right now.
What's wrong with The Righteous Brothers?
Nothing, I-- I just prefer the other--
- Bullshit!
- How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
- Since when did this store become a fascist regime?
- Since you brought that tape in.
Oh, man, that's great! That's the fun thing about workin' in a record store.
You get to play crappy pap you don't even want to listen to.
I thought this tape was gonna be a fuckin'... conversation stimulator, man!
I was gonna ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning.
- You just had to fuckin' ruin it.
- We'll do it next Monday.
No! I wanna do it now!
I can't fire them. I hired these guys for three days a week... and they just started showing up every day-- that was four years ago.
Number three in the top five all-time breakup list?
Charlie Nicholson.
Sophomore year at college.
Whoo! Am I glad that's over.
As soon as I saw her,
I realized she was the kind of girl...
I'd wanted to meet ever since
I was old enough to meet girls.
I mean, she was different.
She was dramatic, and she was exotic.
And she talked a lot, and when she talked... she said remarkably interesting things about music, books, film and politics.
- And she talked a lot.
- Have you ever seen him less than 300 feet tall?
- No.
- Huh? No.
And you won't, will you, sweetheart? No.
Kiss my neck.
Yeah.
And she liked me.
She liked me. She liked me.
At least, I think she did.
- Do you like that one?
- Yeah.
It's okay.
We went out for two years.
And I never got comfortable.
Why would a girl, no, a woman like Charlie go out with me?
I felt like a fraud.
I felt like one of those people who suddenly shave their heads... and said they'd always been punks.
I was sure I'd be discovered at any second.
And I worried about my abilities as a lover.
And I was intimidated by other men in her design department... and became convinced she was gonna leave me for one of them.
Then she left me for one of them.
The dreaded Marco.
Charlie! You fucking bitch!
Let's work it out!
Just open the fucking door.
Charlie!
Look, let's talk it--
Char--
And then I lost it.
Kinda lost it all, you know?
Faith, dignity, about fifteen pounds.
When I came to a few months later...
I found to my surprise
I had flunked out of school.
Started working at a record shop.
Some people never got over 'Nam, or the night their band opened for Nirvana.
I guess I never really got over Charlie.
But the thing I learned from the whole Charlie debacle... is that you gotta punch your weight.
You see, Charlie, she's out of my class.
She's too pretty.
Too smart. Too witty. Too much.
I mean, what am I?
I'm a middleweight.
Hey, I'm not the smartest guy in the world... but I'm certainly not the dumbest.
I mean, I've read books like
Unbearable Lightness of Being... and Love in the Time of Cholera.
And I think I've understood them.
They're about girls, right?
Just kidding.
But I have to say... my all-time favorite book is Johnny Cash's autobiography, Cash byJohnny Cash.
Championship.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Um...
I was thinking I could come by the house... and pick up some stuff while you're at work tomorrow.
While I'm at work.
While I'm at work.
- Ooh, boy. Oh boy, oh boy--
- That's what you've got to say... is "Oh, boy," and " Bravo."
- Laura, this is just so dumb.
- Look Rob, I gotta go.
I'm looking for a record... for my daughter for her birthday.
"I Just Called to Say I Love You."
Do you have it?
- Yeah. We have it.
- Great. Great.
- Can I have it, then?
- No. No.
- You can't.
- Why not?
It's sentimental, tacky crap. Do we look like the kind of store that sells...
"I Just Called to Say I Love You"?
Go to the mall.
What's your problem?
Do you even know your daughter?
There's no way she likes that song.
- Oh-Oh-Oh-- Is she in a coma?
- Oh, okay buddy.
I didn't know it was "Pick On
The Middle-Aged Square Guy" Day.
My apologies.
I'll be on my way.
Bye-bye.
Fuck you.
Nice, Barry. Really, really nice.
It was top class.
Rob, "Top Five Musical Crimes Perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80s and '90s." Go.
Sub-question: Is it unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for latter-day sins?
Is it better to burn out than to fade away?
- Barry, I'm fuckin' broke, man.
- He was gonna buy one record... which we didn't have, and then leave and never come back.
- That's not the point. What did he ever do to you?
- He offended me...
- with his terrible taste.
- It wasn't his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Are you defending that ass-muncher?
Come on, Rob.
You're goin' soft in your old age.Jesus.
Now, all of a sudden
I'm offending your golf buddy.
I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, pal.
That's the worst fuckin' sweater
I've ever seen. It's a Cosby sweater.
A Cosby sweater!
Did Laura let you leave the house like that?
- Fuckin' asshole.
- Hey, hey!
- Will you shut up? Will you?
- Break it up.
You're a fuckin' maniac. I swear to God.
If you tore this thing... it's vintage, and I would fuckin' sock your nose.
You'll pay big.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Look, Dick.
Laura and I broke up.
She's gone. So if we ever see
Barry again, you can tell him that.
Oh, of course I will, Rob.
No problem.
No problem at all.
I'll tell him next time I see him.
Definitely.
I've, uh, got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem.
I'll just tell him, you know, about Laura... then... when I tell him... the other stuff.
Mmm.
Do you want to talk about it?
That kind of thing?
No. Thank you, though, Dick.
Thank you.
Look at these.
I used to dream I'd be surrounded... by exotic women's underwear forever and ever.
Now I know they just save their best pairs... for the nights they know they're gonna sleep with somebody.
Hello, Laura, this is your mother.
Your father's angina is a little rough today.
I thought he might like to talk to you. It's no big deal.
I love you two. Bye-bye.
Anyway, me and Charlie, we didn't match.
Marco and Charlie matched.
But me and Sarah, number four on the all-time list, we matched.
She'd just been dumped by some asshole named Michael.
I mean, Michael was such an asshole.
I'd just been run over by Charlie.
I know exactly what you mean.
I mean, it's just so painful.
And draining. I'm just gonna be by myself for awhile.
Me too.
Me too.
It made sense to pool our collective loathing for the opposite sex... and while we were at it, we get to share a bed with somebody at the same time.
We were frightened of being left alone for the rest of our lives.
Only people of a certain disposition are... frightened of being left alone for the rest of their lives at 26.
We were of that disposition.
- So, when she told me--
- I met someone else.
- Who?
- Just someone else.
It was contrary to the whole spirit of our arrangement.
So, how come I got dumped?
What?
- Hey, Dick, come on in. What is it?
- Oh, um... well, we're going to Lounge Ax, and I was just wondering... if you wanted to come along with us.
Whoa!
Uh, Marie De Salle's playing.
You remember I told you about her today? I like her.
She's kind of Sheryl Crow-ish, crossed with a, um... post-Partridge Family, pre-L.A. Law Susan Dey kind of thing.
- But, you know, black.
- Yeah.
So, um, I just wanted to know if you wanted to come along.
Barry thought so, too, really, but I guess...
- it looks as if you're reorganizing your records.
- Reorganizing my records.
Um, what is it?
Chronological?
No.
- Not alphabetical.
- Nope.
- What?
- Autobiographical.
- No fucking way.
- Yeah.
I can tell you how I got from Deep
Purple to Howling Wolf in just 25 moves.
- Oh, my God.
- And, if I want to find the song "Landslide"... by Fleetwood Mac,
I have to remember... that I bought it for someone in the fall of 1983 pile... but didn't give it to them for personal reasons.
- That sounds--
- Comforting.
Yes. It is.
- Hello?
- Well, shit, I can stick around, you know, man... if you want me to help out.
But you really shouldn't keep them piled like this...
- because it gets pressured--
- Hold on. See you tomorrow.
- Oh. Okay. I'll see you.
- Okay.
Hi, Mom.
How's the store?
You're very lucky that Laura is doing as well as she's doing.
Because if it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep.
She left.
She's gone.
What?
What do you mean?
- Where did she go?
- How would I know where?
She's gone.
Girlfriend leave.
Not say where gone.
Laura move out.
- Well, call her mother.
- She just called.
She doesn't even now.
Probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
- That is not what's upsetting me.
- It fuckin' should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this would happen.
What are you gonna do, Rob?
I'm gonna drink wine.
I'm gonna watch TV and go to bed.
- Then I'm gonna go to work.
- And then what?
I'm gonna meet a girl, have children, and the next time we talk...
- I'll have it all figured out, okay?
- I knew!
- I knew it was gonna happen.
- What are you getting so upset about?
- You know why she left.
- It's got nothing to do with marriage.
- So you say.
- Mom? I'm telling you, for the last time.
Laura didn't even want to get married.
She's not that kind of girl.
That's not what happens now.
Oh, I don't know what happens now.
Apart from, you meet someone, you move in, she goes!
You meet someone, you move in, she goes!
Shut up, Mom. Goddamn!
That's some cold shit.
John Dillinger was shot dead behind that theater in a hail of F.B.I. gunfire.
You know who tipped them off?
His fuckin' girlfriend.
He just wanted to go to the movies.
Is that Peter fucking Frampton?

Rob! It's your turn.
Okay. I'm feeling kind of basic today.
Top five side ones.
Track ones.
"JanieJones," Clash.
From The Clash.
"Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On.
Nirvana, "Smells Like Teen Spirit," off Nevermind.
Oh, no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.
How about "Point of No Return" on Point of No Return?
Shut up, shut up. "White Light/White Heat,"
Velvet Underground.
- That would be on my list.
- Not on mine.
Massive Attack,
No Protection, the song is...
- "Radiation Ruling the Nation."
- Oh, kind of a new record.

Now, why would you sell it to me and not to him?
- Because you're not a geek, Louis.

It really made me feel like less of an asshole.
Ohh. Well.

Hey. Like the music.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I can go turn it off if you want.
You might be sick of it.

Laura doesn't know anybody called Ian.
There's no Ian in her office.
She has no friends called Ian!
I'm almost certain she has never met anyone named Ian in her life.
She lives in an--
..."Ian-less" universe.
"I. Raymond."
Ray. "I."
Ian.
Mr. I. Raymond,
"Ray" to his friends... and more importantly to his neighbor.
The guy who, until about six weeks ago, lived upstairs.
I start to remember things about him now.
His horrible clothes and hair.
His music:
Latin and Bulgarian... whatever world music was trendy that week.
He had rings on his fingers.
Awful cooking smells.

Hi, Barry.
♪ Sufferin' and borin' ♪
♪ I feel I'm ignorin' ♪
♪ My time in the world Have you heard-- ♪
For a couple of years,
I was the deejay at a club.
I was good at it, I think.
And while I was doing it, it's the happiest I've ever been.
And, that's where I met Laura.
She was already a lawyer, but she worked for Legal Aid... hence the leatherjacket and the clubbing.
Oh, I liked her right away.
- Hey!
- Hey!
That's a kick-ass record.
- What?
- That's a kick-ass record.
Yeah, I know.
- Um, what's your name?
- Laura!
Hey! I was gonna say, um, come back next week and I'll make you a tape.
- All right. Thank you.
- Okay?
- Rob.
- I'm still Laura.
To be honest, I hadn't met anyone as promising as Laura... since I started deejaying, and meeting promising women... is kind of what the deejaying thing is supposed to be about.
And anyway, we-- we moved on from there.
She lost her lease on her apartment in Lakeview... and she moved in with me.
And it stayed that way for years.
She didn't make me miserable, or anxious... or ill-at-ease.
And you know, it sounds boring, but it wasn't.
It wasn't spectacular, either.
It was just... good.
But really good.
So. How come
I'm suddenly an asshole?
I get the feeling that Liz talked to Laura.
And Liz stuck up for me.
And Laura told her a few things.
I don't know what precisely Laura said... but she would have revealed at least two, maybe even all four... of the following pieces of information:
- One, that I slept with someone else--
- He slept with somebody else.
- What?
- ...while she, Laura, was pregnant.
- While I was pregnant.
- No!
Two. That my affair directly contributed--
...pretty much directly to me terminating the pregnancy.
No.
Three, that after the abortion...
I borrowed a large sum of money from her--
- ...four grand or so--
- ...and have not, as of yet, repaid any of it.
- Bastard!
- Four.
That shortly before she left me...
I told her that I was kind of unhappy in the relationship.
And maybe sort of looking around for someone else.
He was "sort of, maybe," looking around for somebody else.
Did I do and say those things?
- Yes.
- No!
Yes, I did.
- I am a fuckin' asshole.
- That's it.
Liz. No, sit down.
Sit down.
That's shocking.
That is shocking.
First of all, the money.
Laura had it, and I didn't.
And she wanted to give it to me.
I've never been able to pay her back... because I've never been able to.
Just because she moved in with some Supertramp fan... it doesn't make me five grand richer.
And number two: this stuff about me half-looking around for someone else--
She tricked me into saying it.
We were having this State-of-the-Union type conversation... and she said, matter-of-factly, that we were pretty unhappy at the moment.
And did I agree?
And I said yes.
And she asked me whether I ever thought about meeting other people.
So, then I asked her if she ever thought about meeting someone else.
She says, "Of course."
So I admit that, yes...
I daydream about it from time to time.
Now, I can see what we were really talking about... is her and Ian, and she suckered me into absolving her.
It was a sneaky lawyer's trick.
And I fell for it because... she's much smarter than me.
All right.
Then the pregnancy.
I didn't know she was pregnant.
Of course I didn't. I didn't know because she hadn't told me.
She hadn't told me because I had told her that I had sort--
Yes, I'd slept with someone else, so I didn't find out she was pregnant... till way later.
We were going through this good period, and I made some crack about having kids.
- What?
- She just burst into tears... and I said, well, what is it, you know?
And I made her tell me, and she did... and I went into this brief and ill-advised bout of self-righteousness.
You know,
"What right do you have? My child too."
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah, blah.
That pretty much brings us up to date.

Number one.
Alison Ashmore.
- Hello? Hi.
- This is, uh, Rob Gordon calling.
- I'm an old friend of Alison's. And, um--
- What did you say your name was?
Rob. Rob Gordon. Um--
I was actually her first boyfriend... in the 7th grade, and I was just wondering if you had any way of reaching her.
- Her number, or--
- I hate to quibble with you, Rob... but Alison married her first boyfriend.
Kevin Bannister.
He is her first and last boyfriend.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- No, I'm quite serious.
She is Mrs. Kevin Bannister, and she lives in Australia.
- We went out together in the 7th grade.
- I beg your pardon.
Well, technically,
I'm her first boyfriend, okay?
I met her a few days before Kevin did.
- Technically, number one. Me.
- I don't know what you mean by "technically."
You know, I'm number one.
Me. Technically.
I see. Well, maybe it's my mistake.
I've got to go now, Bob.
Okay, bye-bye.
♪ Who loves the sun ♪ ♪
Alison married Kevin!
I am fine now.
Married her junior high school sweetheart.
Kissed me on the bench, kissed Kevin on the bench, married Kevin.
This is great!
It's got nothing to do with me.
This is fate.
This is destiny.
It is beyond my control.
Beyond my fault. I love this!
I want more. I want to see the others on the big top five.
I want to see Penny, and Charlie and Sarah-- all of them!
You know, just see 'em and talk to 'em.
You know, like a Bruce Springsteen song.
You call, you ask 'em how they are, and you see if they've forgiven you.
Yeah, and then-- And then I'd feel good.
- And they'd feel good.
- No, they'd feel good maybe, but you'd feel better.
I'd feel clean and calm.
That's what you're looking for.
You want to get ready to start again... that'd be good for you.
Great, even.
You'd give that big final good luck and good-bye to your all-time top five... and just move on down the road.
Good luck, good-bye.
Thanks, Boss.
Penny is as beautiful as she was in high school... and really grown into herself.
She reviews movies for a living, which is unassailably cool... even if she does make these little notes with this little flashlight pen.
We have a good time, and we hate the same actors... and everything's goin'great.
She tells me about her life,
I tell her about mine.
We both get it.
We both relate.
And then, with no real explanation,
I just launch into it.
I tell her about how Laura wanted to sleep with Ian and not me.
Charlie wanted to sleep with Marco and not me.
Alison Ashmore wanted
Kevin Bannister and not me.
And you, you wanted to-- You wanted to have sex with Chris Thompson and not me.
And I was hoping you could help me understand why this keeps happening.
Why, you know, I'm doomed to be left.
Doomed to be rejected.
Do you understand?
Um, we-well,
I-I was crazy about you.
I wanted to sleep with you one day, but not when I was sixteen.
You know, when you broke up with me-- you broke up with me-- because I was, to use your charming expression, tight--
I cried and I cried and I hated you, and when that little shitbag... asked me out, and I was too tired to fight him off-- it wasn't rape, because I said okay, but it wasn't far off!
You know I couldn't have sex until after college because I hated it so much?
That's when you're supposed to have sex, Rob. In college!
And now you want to have a little chat about rejection!
Well, fuck you, Rob!
My God, she's right.
I broke up with her.
I rejected her.
That's another one I don't have to worry about.
I should have done this years ago.
- Ma'am? Can I get the check, please?
- Right away, sir.
Next up, Charlie.
But I'm not quite ready for that.
So I go directly to number four on the all-time breakup list.
Sarah, my partner in rejection, who rejected me.
- Hi, Rob.
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.
- Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
- Nice to see you.
- Want me to come--
- You want-- You want-- Okay, let's go out.
I can't believe I left you for him.
- Probably seemed like a good idea at the time.
- I don't know why, though.
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Um, no, yeah.
- No? No.
- Yeah. I mean, I'm in between things.
- How are you doing?
- Me? Not good.
- Really?
- No.
Oh, it's so hard.
The medication I was on is not working.
So, we're trying something else, but it's like they don't know about it... so I'm like a guinea pig, and--
But I'm making money. That's good.
I lost my job a month ago.
So it's been like hand to mouth--
No, I haven't got the heart for the rejection conversation.
There are no hard feelings, and I'm glad she ditched me and not the other way around.
I'll call you.
Nice to see you.
- Fine. Bye. See you later.
- You too.
I could have wound up having sex back there.
And what better way to exorcise rejection demons... than to screw the person who rejected you, right?
But you wouldn't be sleeping with a person.
You'd be sleeping with a whole, sad, single-person culture.
It would be like sleeping with Talia Shire in Rocky, if you weren't Rocky.
I feel guilty enough as it is.
There's only Charlie left now.
She's in the fuckin' phone book.
She should be living on Neptune.
She's an extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth, not a person in a phone book.
Hello, this is Charlie.
Answering machine.
I'll leave a nice, polite message... and she'll never call back.
The Killing Moon E.P. is almost impossible to find, especially on C.D.
Yet another cruel trick played on all the dumb-asses who got rid of their turntables.
- But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album--
- I have all the other ones.
- Oh, you do? Well, how about theJesus and Mary Chain? - They always seemed--
They always seemed what? They always seemed really great is what they always seemed.
They picked up where your precious Echo left off... and you're complaining about no more Echo albums.
I can't believe you don't own this fucking record! That's insane!
Jesus!
Well, the interesting thing about Green Day is that... so much of their music is, in truth, directly influenced by... in my opinion, two bands.
- The Clash--
- The Clash!
Uh, correct, The Clash.
But also... by this band called Stiff Little Fingers.
Um, I think you would really love this band.
It sounds great.
- My name's Annaugh.
- The name's uh-- My name's Dick.
Is this the new Green Day?
You don't have it?
That is perverse.
Don't tell anybody you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.
It's gonna be okay.
I will now sell five copies of the three E.P.'s by the Beta Band.

Hi.
What do you want?
I thought I could give you a ride back.
- Are you coming home?
- Yeah.
Well, I'd like to come over to your house to pick up some things.
My house.
- How'd it go today?
- All right.
- Do you wanna go?
- Sure.
So, have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
You bet. You can take this with you if you want.
Look at this place.
Laura, it's a dump.
What are you making now?
Sixty, seventy a year?
And you were living in this shithole.
Bet you can't even remember what you were doing here.
I was here because I wanted to be with you.
It had nothing to do with this place.
So, uh, where are you staying now?
I think you know that.
- I had to work that out for myself, though, didn't I?
- I'm sorry.
I know I haven't been very fair.
That's why I came to the store tonight.
It took me a while to work up the courage.
- You scared now?
- Yes, of course I am.
I feel terrible, Rob.
You know, this is really hard.
Good.
So... how is everything going with Ian?
Is it working out okay?
- You're living with the guy.
- Don't.
I'm just asking how it's going.
Look, I'm not living with the guy, okay?
I'm just staying with him for a few days until I figure out what I'm doing.
I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.
I'm getting to a point where
I want to get my shit together... and I can't really see that ever happening with you.
And, yes, I sort of got interested in someone else.
And that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.
But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.
Probably nothing.
So, what?
You definitely haven't decided to dump me? Is that it?
There's still a chance we might get back together?
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know... there's a chance, right?
I mean, it would be like if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill... and the doctor said, "I don't know if this patient has a chance of survival."
That doesn't mean the patient's definitely gonna die, does it? I mean, he might live.
- Even if it's a remote possibility.
- I suppose so.
- So we have a chance.
- Shut up, Rob.
- I just want to know, what chance do we have?
- I don't know what chance.
If you could tell me roughly--
All right, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together.
- Nine?
- Nine.
- Great.
- Look, I know I'm asking a lot... but could you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?
No problem.
- You want me to leave my own house?
- Yes, please.
Laura, can I ask you one question?
Yes. One.
You're not gonna like it.
Just ask it.
Is it better?
Is what better?
Better than what?
Well... sex, I guess.
Is it better?
Is that really what's bothering you?
Yes. Yes, of course.
Do you really think it would make a difference either way?
- I don't know.
- Well, the answer is, I don't know either.
We haven't done it yet.
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
Not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No. I was living with you, remember?
We've slept together, but we haven't made love.
Not yet.
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What?
Sleeping together is better.
Sleeping together is better?
But not the sex, because you haven't done it yet?
- Will you please just go?
- Yeah.

I wrote that about me and my ex dividing our record collection.
Great, great song.

- I guess she's happy.
- I don't speak about Laura with as much depth.
But it feels, even to me, like I'm being intimate.
I express regret,
I say nice things about her... and I hint at a deep ocean of melancholy just below the surface.
Which is all bullshit, really.
I've just invented a sketch of a decent, sensitive guy... because I'm in the position to invent him.
And I guess all that charming, nervous stuff seems to work somehow... because we get back to her house and...

- James.
- James.
Do you miss him?
Yeah.
That's how it works, right?

- That way. You?

- Ah, so it is.
- Talk to you.

Right.
What did Laura mean last night when she said, "I haven't slept with him yet"?
Yet! What does "yet" mean anyway?
It means you're gonna do it, doesn't it? Or does it?
Just come on. What would it mean to you, that sentence:
"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet"?
Well, to me it would mean that you're a liar.
You've seen it twice. Once with Laura-- oops-- and once with me and Dick.
We had that conversation about that guy making shotgun ammo off-screen in the 14th century.
Right. But let's just say that I hadn't seen it.
And I said, "I haven't seen
Evil Dead II yet." What would you think?
I'd think that you're a cinematic idiot, and I'd feel sorry for you.
All right. But from that one sentence, would you think that I was going to see it?
I'm sorry, Rob.
I'm struggling here.
You're asking me what would I think if you told me... you hadn't seen a film that you have already seen.
Just listen to me.
If I said to you--
"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yes.
Would you get the impression that I really wanted to see it?
Oh, well, you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone.
Right. I'm not gonna see that movie.
But the word "yet."
Yeah, you know what?
I get the impression that you wanted to see it... otherwise you'd have said you didn't want to go.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
How the fuck am I supposed to know? Probably.
- Why?
- Because it's a brilliant film.
It's so funny and violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
I never thought I'd say this, but can I go work now?
Look, Laura, if you don't want me to call you at work, then give me your home number.
Oh, I forgot.
You can't.
I'm not gonna get off this phone until you agree to meet me for a drink.
I'm sorry, but I don't see why this has to be on your terms all the time, really.
Okay, okay!
We'll meet, then, tonight.
That'd be great if you're not too busy.
It'll be really good... to see you.
So, how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to say you haven't, and I want that to be the truth.
I can't do that.

I think you're running, you're running from a sharp point... that anybody hits in any relationship, and it's just gonna happen again.

- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Is that him?
- Look, can you-- can you call me at work?

You look upset.
Yeah, I'm-I'm upset, but I'm fine.
- Maybe I should talk to him.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job.
Yeah, I know. But, Ian, there's really nothing to resolve.
But thank you.
You have got to stop calling her.
You're really upsetting her, and him!
- Like I care about him.
- Well, you should.
- Why?
- Because all you're doing is forming a little unit.
Them against you! Before you started all this psychotic madness... there was no unit; there was just three people in a mess.
But now they've got something in common.
And you don't want to make anything worse.
How could it get any worse than Laura with Ian?
- Come on, Liz.
- Rob, Rob, Rob.

Just what is it?

We just got together.
Is Tuesday night cool for you?
- We'll just, you know...
- ♪ What I have told you ♪
- jam.
- Yeah.
- ♪ Can you dig it ♪
- All right.
Later.
- What?
- What do you mean, what?
You've had that poster up on the wall for, like, 17,000 years.
And then some guy comes in off the street.
You act like it's no big deal.
- It's just a garage band. It's nothing special.
- You don't play an instrument.
I can sing. What, you think I'm gonna stick around here the rest of my life?
Hey, it's half past a monkey's ass. Let's go.
Uh, I can't meet you guys at the club tonight.
- Why?
- ♪ In Mendocino ♪
- Who are you going to see?
- Nobody.
Rob! Lookie, lookie!
Dick, are you getting some?
Un-fucking-believable!
Dick's got a hot date!
How did this happen?
What rational explanation can there possibly be? What's her name?
- Anaugh.
- Anaugh? Anaugh Conda?
- Anaugh Moss.
- Anaugh Moss?
Is she all green and fuzzy and mossy?
And you met this bruiser where, exactly?
The home for the mentally challenged or the blind or the bus station?
Um, here. She asked me about the new Green Day album, and--
Oh, man! Finally!
Anaugh.
That's great, Dick!
Really smoke that ass.
Listen, Rob,
I can't go to the club, either.
I gotta get some lyrics down on paper.
Oh, yeah, me too.
Well, not, uh, lyrics to get down.
But, um, um--
So, I'll see you, um, tomorrow.
- Hi, Laura.
- "Top five dream jobs."
- Hey, that's private.
- "Number one: journalist for Rolling Stone magazine, 1976 to 1979.
Get to meet the Clash, Chrissy Hynde,
Sex Pistols, David Byrne.
Get tons of free records.
Number two:
Producer, Atlantic Records,
1964 to 1971.
Get to meet Aretha,
Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke."
- More free records.
- "More free records and a shitload of money."
- "Number three: any kind of musician."
- Besides classical or rap.
- "Settle for being one of the
Memphis Horns or something." - Sure.
- "I'm not asking to beJagger or
Hendrix or Otis Redding." - Uh-huh.
"Number four: film director."
Any kind except German or silent.
And number five, we have "architect."
- Yeah.
- Seven years' training.
- I'm not sure I even want to be an architect.
- So you've got a list here... of five things you'd do if qualifications... and time and history and salary were no object?
- Yeah.
- One of them you don't really want to do anyway.
Well, I did put it at number five.
Wouldn't you rather own your own record store than be an architect?
- Yeah, I suppose.
- And you wouldn't want to be... a 16th-century explorer or the king of France?
- God, no.
- All right. There you go, then.
Dream job number five: record store owner.
I find it interesting that you keep showing up here, Laura.
Well, this is the last of it.
Those bags look heavy.
Where's Ian?
Or Ray or--
What is his fucking name anyway?
- What do you call him? Ian or Ray?
- Ray.
- I hate Ian.
- I hate him too.
Yeah, I'm sure.
See ya.
Good-bye.
Top five things I miss about Laura.
One: sense of humor. Very dry, but it can also be warm and forgiving.
And she's got one of the best all-time laughs in the history of all-time laughs.
She laughs with her entire body.
Two: She's got character.
Or at least she had character before the Ian nightmare.
She's loyal and honest... and she doesn't even take it out on people when she's having a bad day.
That's character.
Three:
I miss her smell... and the way she tastes.
It's a mystery of human chemistry, and I don't understand it.
Some people, as far as your senses are concerned, just feel like home.
I really dig how she walks around.
It's like she doesn't care how she looks or what she projects.
And it's not that she doesn't care, it's just-- She's not affected, I guess.
And that gives her grace.
And five: She does this thing in bed when she can't get to sleep.
She kind of half-moans and then rubs her feet together an equal number of times.
It just kills me.
Believe me, I could do a top-five-things about her that drive me crazy... but it's just your garden-variety women, you know, schizo stuff... and that's the kind of thinking that got me here.
Ahhh! Damn!
- You maggots!
- Whoa, whoa! Toss it, man!
- You're pretty when you're angry.
- Shit!
Hey, Rob, Laura called.
Really?

- What is this?
- It's Vince and Justin.
- Who's Vince and Justin?
- Those little skate fuckers.
- No way.
- Way.
It's really--
It's really fuckin' good.
Hey, do you guys know Vince and Justin, the guys that come in my store?
- Yeah, they're right over there, man.
- Thanks.
- Quit smoking. I'm telling you--
- Hey! Your tape.
- It's good.
- I know. We made it.
- Thank you. - I mean,
It's rough, but, unbelievably, it shows promise.
I'll put out your record.
Any profits we split down the middle after I recoup expenses, okay?
Recoup expenses? Man, you're gonna recoup a big, fat Mercedes is what you're gonna do.
- We're not there yet, Justin.
- I'm Vince.
Whatever.
What's the name of your band?
- Uh, the Kinky Wizards.
- Nice.
What's the name of your label?
Top Five Records.
What was that? You just told them you're gonna put out a record with them?
Yeah. So what? You said yourself those guys are good. What are you getting hot about?
Well, it just seems that you think it would be wiser to start a record label... by putting out a record with business-crippling Nazi youth shoplifters... than someone you know in your bitter, jealous heart is a musical visionary.
What do your songs sound like? Sex Pistols?
Nirvana? Pop Abrams and the Smurfs?
- You wouldn't be familiar with our immediate influences. - Try me.
- They're mostly German.
- Kraftwerk? Falco? Hasselhoff?
Hey. You called?
Fuckin' asshole.
Laura, are you all right?
My dad-- My dad died.
- What's up?
- Laura's dad died.
Oh, drag.
I'm sorry, Rob.
Hey, top five songs about death.
A Laura's dad tribute list.
Okay? Okay.
"Leader OfThe Pack."
The guy fuckin' beefs it on his motorcycle and dies, right?
"Dead Man's Curve."
Jan and Dean.
Do you know that right after they recorded that song, Jan himself, um, crashed his--
- It was Dean, you fuckin' idiot.
- It was Jan.
- It was a long time after the--
- Okay, whatever.
"Tell Laura I Love Her."
That would bring the house down.
Laura's mom could sing it.
- You know what I'd want?
- Huh?
"One Step Beyond" by Madness.
No, no, no, no, no.
Wh-When are you going home?
In a minute, when I get it together.
And, uh, "You Can't
Always Get What You Want."
Immediate disqualification because of its involvement with The Big Chill.
Oh, God, you're right.
Um, Mom wants you to come to the funeral.
- Oh. Me?
- Yes. My dad really liked you.
And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it.
"Wreck OfThe Edmund Fitzgerald."
Uh, Gordon Lightfoot.
Bastard. That's so good that should have been mine.
Do you, uh--
Do you want me there?
I don't care, as long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
- Is Ray going?
- No!

Hey. How are you doing?
I'm all right, I suppose.
Mom's not too bad.
But Laura-- I don't know.
Yeah, well, she's had a rough time of it already, without this.
It's just so hard when you put all of your efforts into one area of your life... and it doesn't work out.
Don't mind me, really. Just pretend like you're talking about someone else. It's okay.
Well, in fact, we are talking about someone else. We're talking about Laura.
- Oh.
- Oh?
Don't fuckin' say "oh" like that to me, Liz.
I'm really sorry, Jo. Look,

But that's not much of a life, is it? Huh?

Just because it's never the time, Liz?
I can't go on apologizing my whole life.
I think just the once would do!
- I'm very sorry, Laura.

No.
- You're soaking.
- Yeah.
You're also an idiot.
Look, Laura,
I'm really sorry.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Why don't you just get back, and I'm just gonna wait here for the bus.
No, I don't want to be there. When I saw you leave,
I used it as an excuse to get out.
Is there anything I can do?
- Come on.
- Where?
I'll show you.
Let's go.
Right.
Dad used to bring us here when we were kids.
Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
'Cause I want to feel something else than this.
It's either that, or I go home and put my hand in the fire.
Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
No. I only have a few left.
I've been saving them for later.
Right.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Right. Right.
I knew there was a reason
I wore a skirt today.
- Just stay there.
- Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Hey, go be with your mom.
I'm too tired.
I'm too tired not to be with you.
So if you had a bit more energy, we'd stay split up?
But things being as they are, you being wiped out and all, you wanna get back together?
- Is that it?
- Yeah.
Mmm. What about Ian?
Well, Ray's a disaster.
Look...
I, I know it's not very romantic, Rob.
But there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.
- I just--
- So... that's it?
Well, you've made it clear you want me back, so--
Look, um, we can talk about it later if-if you want to.
Right now, I--
I just--
Right now, I just want to go home... with you.
Okay.
So... yeah.
And so we got back together, and it was great.
She moved all her stuff back in, all at once.
- When did you decide to get back with me, exactly?
- I'm not telling you.

How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?
That's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
No, it's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.
Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel make pop records.
Made. Made. Marvin Gaye's dead.
His father shot him.
You could say it was everything
I ever wanted... really.
- Marvin Gaye! "Let's Get It On."
- I know.
That's our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship.
Oh, is that so? I'd like a word with him, then.
It was everything I ever wanted.
Except, for some fucking reason... this--
Excuse me.
Is this Stereo Lab?
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
I haven't heard this one.
It's really good.
Yeah, I know.
Are you Bob?
Rob.
Oh, right. Yeah, Rob.
You used to deejay.
I used to go to the Double Door to hear you spin.
You were unbelievable.
- Really? Well--
- I'm Caroline.
Hi.
- What do you do?
- I work for The Reader. I write a music column.
You're Caroline Fortis?
I read your column.
- It's great.
You really know what you're talking about. - Thanks.
- Rob, phone.
- Can you take a message?
It's your girlfriend.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Hey, what the fuck is this?
- Talk to your woman.
- It was her idea.
♪ Crumbs busted Pass the popcorn As I kick--♪ ♪
Laura!
"Dance music for old people"?
It's an idea I had when I was with, um, Ian... and I thought it was such a good one, that I was really annoyed we weren't together anymore.
- It may be why I came back.
- A record release party?
What if I was doing something that can't be cancelled?
- What are you ever doing that can't be cancelled?
- That's not the point!
- The single cannot be done. There's a million things!
- It'll be done. Guess what?
Oh, guess what? Barry said his band will play a set.
Barry is playing at this thing?
Fucking, what are you-- Are you insane?
Barry, I'll give you ten percent of the door if you don't play.
Rob, we're getting that anyway.
- Twenty. Twenty percent.
- No! Come on, Rob. We need the gig.
A hundred and ten percent. That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
- Rob, we're called Sonic Death Monkey.
- Sonic Death Monkey?
Yeah. And if Laura and her bourgeois lawyer friends can't handle it, fuck them.
Let 'em riot.
We're Sonic fucking Death Monkey.
Let me get this straight.
We made the C.D. with you.
Now your friends and your girlfriend are throwing some kind of celebration party... and you're asking us not to come to the party?
Exactly.
I don't know, dude.
That just seems kind of stupid.
It's just the whole thing is just blown way out of proportion.
It's just a three-song CD.
It's a single.
It's just-- It's not a big deal.
It's just that you're making something.
You, the critic, the professional appreciator... put something new into the world.
The second one of those things gets sold to someone, you're officially a part of it.
Congratulations, Rob.
You know, I guess I think I've always been a professional critic... you know, or some sort of professional appreciator or something.
And I just wanted to, you know, do something new... put something new out into the world... kind of really put my money where my mouth is.
Yeah. Wow. You know,
I would love to hear them.
- Why don't I send it over to you when it's, uh, done?
- Really?
- I will look forward to that.
- I will look forward to sending it.
- You know, we should get back to the interview.
- Yeah, let's do that.
Okay. What are your all-time top five favorite records?
In the club or at home?
Listen. I'll tell you what.
Why don't I just make you a tape?
Now, the making of a good compilation tape is a very subtle art.
Many do's and don'ts.
First of all, you're using someone else's poetry to express how you feel.
This is a delicate thing.
So, for this one,
I'm thinking...
I'm thinking--
When is this gonna stop?
When's what gonna stop?
Uh, nothing.
Who's the tape for?
Just some girl who interviewed me for The Reader.
So what am I gonna do now?
Just keep jumping... from rock to rock for the rest of my life until there aren't any rocks left?
Should I bolt every time I get that feeling in my gut when I meet someone new?
I've been thinking with my gut since I was 14 years old... and, frankly speaking, I've come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains.
Hi. Drinking lunch on a school day.
That's a nice surprise.
- Are you nervous about tomorrow night?
- Not really, no.
Well, are you gonna talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
- No, I'm gonna talk to you.
- Great. What are you gonna talk to me about?
Um, I'm gonna talk to you about whether or not... you want to get married to me.
- I'm serious.
- Yes, I know.
Well, thanks a fucking bunch.
I'm sorry. Two days ago, you were making tapes...
- for that girl from The Reader.
- Yeah.
Well, forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Would you marry me if I was?
- What brought all this on?
- I don't know.
- I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
- About what?
This stuff. Love and... settling down and marriage, you know?
I want to think about something else.
I changed my mind.
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.
- I do. I will.
- Just shut up, please.
I'm trying to explain, okay?
That other girl, or other women, whatever--
I mean, I was thinking that they're just fantasies.
You know? And they always seem really great... because there's never any problems.
And if there are, they're cute problems... like, you know, we bought each other the same Christmas present... or she wants to go see a movie that I've already seen, you know?
And then I come home, and you and I have real problems... and you don't even want to see the movie I want to see, period.
- There's no lingerie and--
- I have lingerie.
Yes, you do. You have great lingerie.
But you also have the cotton underwear... that's been washed a thousand times, and it's hanging on the thing and--
And they have it too. It's just I don't have to see it because it's not in the fantasy.
Do you understand?
I'm tired of the fantasy... because it doesn't really exist.
And there are never really any surprises, and it never really--
- Delivers?
- Delivers.
Right.
And I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of everything else, for that matter.
But I don't ever seem to get tired of you.
So--
I think I know what you mean.
But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I don't know. I didn't think about it, really.
I thought asking was the important part.
Well, you've asked.
Thank you.
Uh, thanks for coming out here tonight.
That was just a little bit of"I Sold My Mom's Wheelchair"... the title track from the album of same name... the record we're having this record release party for.
The two burgeoning criminals behind this opus are standing by the bar.
They're underage, and we'll lose our liquor license--
But we'll get to them in a moment.
First, I have to introduce a band, so please don't leave... until after they finish and we play the record.
Right now, it's my great, great pleasure.... to introduce...
Sonic Death Monkey.
I'm an idiot. I should've played the whole album first.
- These people are gonna burn the place down.
- No, no, it's gonna be fine.
These people are ready for anything.
- It's gonna be fine. Watch.
- Thank you.
You're so kind. Rob, thank you for the enthusiastic intro... but we're no longer called Sonic Death Monkey.
We're on the verge of being called, uh, Kathleen Turner Overdrive.
However, this evening we will be Barry Jive... and the Uptown Five.

I bought some aspirin down at United Drug
In case you shake apart and want a brand-new start
To do
That
Jazz
Let's go, babe.
But I didn't even meet your friend. That manager guy.
Don't worry, Roxie.
It's all taken care of.
You told him about me?
Yeah, kid, it's all arranged.
Find a flask, we're playing fast and loose
And all that jazz
Right up here is where I store the juice
And all that jazz
Come on, babe, we're gonna brush the sky
I betcha Lucky Lindy never flew so high
'Cause in the stratosphere, how could he lend an ear
To all
That
Jazz?
Oh, you're gonna see your sheba shimmy-shake
And all that jazz
Oh, she's gonna shimmy till her garters break
And all that jazz
Show her where to park her girdle
Oh, her mother's blood will curdle
If she'd hear her baby's queer
For all
That
Jazz
Hello, Miss Borusewicz.
Mrs. Hart.
This is Fred.
He's my brother.

And all that jazz
Start the car,
I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold, but the piano's hot
It's just a noisy hall where there's a nightly brawl
And all
That
Jazz
Say it again, Fred.
Oh, you're a star, kid.
My little shootin' star.
No, I'm no one's wife
But, oh, I love my life
And all
That
Jazz
That jazz
Oh, say it again, Fred.
Where's the fire, huh?
Amos ain't home till midnight.
Hey, I don't want you to feel like I'm nagging at you, but don't you think it's time
I met your friend down at the Onyx?
It's been a month since you told him about me.
And I know
'cause that was the night
Velma Kelly plugged her husband and her sister.
You know they say that she found
'em in the kip together?
Gosh, if I ever found Amos slipping it to somebody else...
I'd throw him a great big going-away party.
It's getting late.
I have been thinking a lot about my act.
Whenever I get a good idea
I write it in my diary.
It occurred to me the other day that all the really, really knockout acts have something a little different going on.
Like a signature bit.
And I thought that my thing could be aloof, you know?
Give 'em just enough to get 'em good and hungry, but always leave 'em wantin' more.
Hey, once I get a name for myself, maybe we could open up a club of our own.
You could run it, and I could be the headliner.
What's the idea?
Wake up, kiddo. You ain't never gonna have an act.
Says who?
Face it. You're a two-bit talent with skinny legs.
I'm just a furniture salesman.
Yeah, but you got connections.
- That guy at the club.
- There is no guy.
That night...
It was the first time
I set foot in that joint.
I was collecting on a bet from the trombone player.
So you never told anyone about me?
Sugar, you were hot stuff.
I would have said anything to get a piece of that.
And now? Now?
We had some laughs.
Let's just leave it at that.
You can't do this to me.
Would you get off?
You touch me again,
I'll put your lights out!
- Wait.
- Your husband will be home soon.
Wash yourself before hitting those sheets again.
You're a liar, Fred.
Yeah, yeah, so what?
You lied to me.
That's life, sweetheart.
That's life.
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
You're a son of a bitch!
Hotcha
Whoopee
Why you bothering, Sal?
This one's all wrapped up.
It's a new city record.
From killin' to confession in an hour flat.
SGT. Where did you get the murder weapon?
I keep a gun in the underwear drawer.
Just in case of trouble.
That's just fine.
Sign right there, Mr. Hart.
Freely and gladly.
Don't say we beat it out of you when you get on the stand.
No, I gave myself up.
Surrendered of my own free will.
Isn't he the cheerful murderer?
Shootin' a burglar ain't murder.
Just last week, a jury thanked a man.
I'm grateful for citizens who know the law.
Get in there.
You too.
Sit down.
Okay. From the top.
A man's got a right to protect his home and loved ones, right?
Of course he has.
I come home from the garage, and I see him climbing through the window with my wife, Roxie, laying there, sleeping like an angel.
That true, Mrs. Hart?
It's the God's honest truth.
My wife had nothing to do with it.
She wouldn't hurt a worm, not even a worm.
It wasn't till I fired the first shot she even opened her eyes.
I always said she could sleep through the St. Paddy's Day Parade.
When I think of what would have happened if I went out for a beer instead of coming home.
It makes you sick even thinking about it.
For her first number, Miss Roxie Hart would like to sing a song of love and devotion dedicated to her dear husband, Amos.
Sometimes I'm right
Sometimes I'm wrong
But he doesn't care
He'll string along
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine
Sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm up
But he follows round
Like some droopy-eyed pup
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine
After I shot him, he kept coming at me, so I had to pull the trigger again.
He ain't no sheik
That's no great physique
And Lord knows he ain't got the smarts
But look at that soul
I tell you, that whole
Is a whole lot greater than the sum of his parts
And if you knew him like me
I know you'd agree
What if the world slandered my name?
Why, he'd be right there taking the blame
He loves me so
And it all suits me fine
That funny, sunny honey
Hubby of mine
Supposing, just supposing, he had violated her.
- You know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.
Think how terrible that would have been.
It's a good thing I got home from work on time.
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine
Name of deceased,
Fred Casely.
Fred Casely?
How could he be a burglar?
My wife knows him.
He sold us our furniture.
He gave us 10% off.
Lord knows he ain't got the smarts
You told me he was a burglar.
He was dead when you got home?
She had him covered in a sheet, and she's telling me some cock-and-bull story and how I ought to say I did it
'cause I was sure to get off.
"Help me, Amos," she says.
"It's my goddamn hour of need."
Now he shot off his trap
I can't stand that sap
- Look at him go
- And I believed her.
- Rattin' on me
- That cheap little tramp.
She was two-timing me, huh?
I'm through protecting her now.
She can swing for all I care.
I'm down at the garage working 14 hours a day, and she's up here munching on bonbons and tramping around like some goddamn floozy!
Thought she could pull the wool over my eyes.
- That scummy, crummy
- Well, I wasn't born yesterday.
- Dummy
- Some things a man can't take.
- Hubby of mine
- She pushed me too far.
That little chiseler.
Boy, what a sap I was!
You double-crosser!
You big blabbermouth!
You promised you'd stick.
You been stringin' me,
Roxanne!
You told me he was a burglar!
The whole time, you been up here jazzin' him.
You are a disloyal husband!
Look, it's true.
I shot him.
But it was self-defense.
He was trying to burgle me.
From what I hear, he's been burgling you three times a week for the last month.
So what do you say, Missus?
That's him, all right.
Thank you.
Your story doesn't wash,
Mrs. Hart... so try this on for size.
Fred Casely was a good time on the side with Goofy here as a meal ticket.
Meal ticket?
He couldn't buy my liquor.
Fred Casely could?
With a wife and five little Caselys?
Or did he forget to mention them?
What?
All his.
Oh, that bastard.
That bastard!
Yeah, I killed him.
I would kill him again.
Once was enough, dearie.
Take her downtown. Come on!
This is it. 2641/2.
Here they come.
This way, honey.
It's a shame to hide such a beautiful face.
Why'd you shoot him?
Give us a profile with a smile like the girl from the toothpaste ad.
Enjoy it while you can.
Take this down.
Assistant District Attorney
Harrison says this is a hanging case.
I'm ready to go to the jury tomorrow.
What do you mean, hanging?
Not so tough anymore, are you?
Take her down to the Cook County Jail.
We need a headline.
Why'd you shoot him?
Was he cruel? Did he beat you?
Hey, what do you mean, hanging?
Morphine, opium, cocaine?
- Arm length. 31 inches.
- Arm length. 31 inches.
Height. 66 inches.
The Matron's on her way, so don't get too cozy.
Put out that cigarette!
Ever had Morton before?
She's fine.
Long as you keep her happy.
And now, ladies and gentlemen... the Keeper of the Keys, the Countess of the Clink... the Mistress of Murderess Row...
Matron Mama Morton!
Ask any of the chickies in my pen
They'll tell you
I'm the biggest mother hen
I love them all, and all of them love me
Because the system works the system called
Reciprocity
On your feet.
Welcome, ladies.
Got a little motto
Always sees me through
When you're good to Mama
Mama's good to you
You might think I'm here to make your life a living hell, but it's just not true.
There's a lot of favors
I'm prepared to do
You do one for Mama
She'll do one for you
I'd like to be your friend, if you let me.
So if there's something that upsets you or makes you unhappy in any way... don't shoot your fat-ass mouth off to me
'cause I don't give a shit.
They say that life is tit for tat
And that's the way I live
So I deserve a lot of tat
For what I've got to give
Don't you know that this hand
Washes that one, too?
When you're good to Mama
Mama's good to you
Let's go.
You must be Hart.
Ain't you the pretty one.
Thank you, ma'am.
Oh, no, call me Mama.
I'm here to take care of you.
You'll be habitatin' down in the east block.
Murderess Row, we call it.
Is that nicer?
I don't think I belong in here.
I didn't actually do anything wrong.
No need to tell me.
I never heard of a man getting killed when he didn't get just what was coming to him.
Hey, Mama!
Come here. Come here.
Velma Kelly.
You're the Velma Kelly.
I was there the night that you got arrested.
Yeah.
You and half of Chicago.
Look at this, Mama.
An editorial denouncing me in "Redbook" magazine.
"Not in memory do we recall so fiendish and horrible a double homicide."
You couldn't buy that kind of publicity.
Couldn't buy it?
I guess I can keep this, then.
Nice try.
If you want my gravy
Pepper my ragout
Spice it up for Mama
She'll get hot for you
When they pass that basket folks contribute to
You put in for Mama
She'll put out for you
The folks atop the ladder
Are the ones the world adores
So boost me up my ladder, kid
And I'll boost you up yours
Let's all stroke together
Like the Princeton crew
When you're strokin' Mama
Mama's strokin' you
So what's the one conclusion
I can bring this number to?
When you're good to Mama
Mama's good
To you
Ah, yes!
Mama?
It's kind of freezing in here.
You don't think there's something wrong with the heat?
Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but... if you got a couple extra blankets tucked away -
Lights out, ladies.
Okay.
Okay.

You know how people have these little habits that get you down?
Like Bernie.
Bernie liked to chew gum.
No, not chew. Pop.
So I came home this one day, and I'm really irritated... and I'm looking for a little bit of sympathy.
There's Bernie lyin' on the couch... drinkin' a beer and chewin'.
No, not chewin'. Poppin'!
So I said to him, "You pop that gum one more time..."
And he did.
So I took the shotgun off the wall... and I fired two warning shots into his head.
He had it coming
He had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there
If you'd have heard it
I betcha you would have done the same
I met Ezekial Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago, and he told me he was single, and we hit it off right away.
So we started living together.
He'd go to work.
He'd come home.
I'd fix him a drink.
We'd have dinner.
And then I found out.
Single, he told me?
Single, my ass.
Not only was he married...
Oh, no...
He had six wives.
One of those Mormons.
So that night when he came home from work...
I fixed him his drink, as usual.
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic.
- He had it coming
- Pop, six, squish
- He had it coming
- Cicero, Lipschitz
He took a flower in its prime
- And then he used it
- Pop
- And he abused it
- Six
It was a murder, but not a crime
Cicero, Lipschitz
Now, I'm standing in the kitchen carving up the chicken for dinner, minding my own business.
In storms my husband, Wilbur, in a jealous rage.
"You been screwin' the milkman," he says.
He was crazy, and he kept on screamin',
"You been screwin' the milkman!"
And then he ran into my knife.
He ran into my knife 10 times.
If you'd have been there
If you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same
Yeah, but did you do it?
Not guilty.
My sister, Veronica, and I had this double act.
And my husband, Charlie, traveled around with us.
Now, for the last number in our act... we did these
20 acrobatic tricks in a row.
One, two, three, four, five... splits, spread eagles, backflips, flip-flops.
One right after the other.
One night before the show, we're down at the Hotel Cicero.
The three of us boozin' and havin' a few laughs.
We run out of ice, so I go out to get some.
I come back, open the door... and there's Veronica and Charlie doing number 17.
The spread eagle.
Well, I was in such a state of shock...
I completely blacked out.
I can't remember a thing.
It wasn't until later when I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead.
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
They had it coming all along
- I didn't do it
- She didn't do it
- But if I'd done it
- But if she'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it
But if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?
I loved Al Lipschitz more than I could possibly say.
He was a real artistic guy.
Sensitive. A painter.
But he was always trying to find himself.
He'd go out every night looking for himself, and on the way... he found Ruth, Gladys,
Rosemary, and Irving.
You could say we broke up because of artistic differences.
He saw himself as alive... and I saw him dead.
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
- They had it coming
They had it coming all along
- And if they used us
- And if they used us
- Then they abused us

Could you tell us that we were wrong?

Who belongs to them?
What's it to you?
Nothing.
Heard they were Velma's.
The Hunyak does her laundry for a buck a week.
Fresh towels for the can.
Make it quick.
I'm gonna take care of you now.
I know a couple of things.
Hear me out.
Billy Flynn's set your trial for March 5th.
March 7th you'll be acquitted.
March 8th, Mama is gonna put you on the vaudeville circuit.
Now you're an agent, too?
Until Ma Bell installs a line in your cell... all the calls have gotta go through me.
What kind of dough are we talking about?
It's a crazy world.
Babe Ruth is wearing rouge and playing the Palace for $5,000 a week.
Yeah. What about someone with real talent?
I been talking to the boys over at William Morris.
Due to your recent sensational activities... they think they can get you $2,500.
Jeez, the most me and Veronica made was $350.
That's what happens when you have the right representation.
I always wanted to play
Big Jim Colosimo's.
Do you think you can get me that?
- Big Jim's?
- Yeah.
I don't know. That's gonna take another phone call.
How much is that gonna cost?
You know how I feel about you.
You're like family to me.
You're like one of my own.
- I'll do it for 50 bucks.
- 50 bucks for a phone call?
You must get a lot of wrong numbers, Mama.
Oh, Miss Kelly, got your personals.
Freshly pressed by yours truly.
No, it's my pleasure.
Hey, listen, can I ask you something?
You know that Harrison guy?
He said that what I done is a hanging case and that he's prepared to ask for the maximum penalty.
- Yeah, so?
- So I'm scared.
I sure would appreciate some advice.
Especially from someone
I admire as much as you.
Since I can remember, I have wanted to be on the stage.
What's your talent?
Washing and drying?
No. I danced in the chorus.
That was before
I met my husband, Amos.
Look, honey, you want some advice?
Here it is.
Direct from me to you.
Keep your paws off my underwear, okay?
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
For nothin'.
She's something, ain't she?
No matter how big she gets, she's still as common as ever.
I'd like to help you, dearie.
Take a load off.
So, what do you figure on using for grounds?
Grounds?
What are you gonna tell the jury?
I just figured
I'd tell them the truth.
- The truth?
- Yeah.
That's a one-way ticket to the death house.
Holy Mother of God.
Oh, relax.
In this town, murder's a form of entertainment.
Besides, in 47 years,
Cook County ain't never hung a woman yet.
So the odds are 47 to one that they won't hang you.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
You're talking to the wrong people.
What you need is Billy Flynn.
- Who?
- Billy Flynn.
He's only the best criminal lawyer in Illinois.
What he don't know about juries and women...
How do you get Billy Flynn?
Well, not by praying, dearie.
First, you give me $100.
Then I make a phone call.
Well, you just...
I mean, it seems pretty steep for a phone call.
He's worth every cent.
He's never lost a case for a female client yet.
With a sweet little puss like yours... let's just say justice ain't so blind in Chicago.
He's never lost a case?
Never.
Every girl in this place would kill to have
Billy Flynn represent her.
Billy
We want Billy
B-I-Double-L-Y
We're all his
He's our kind of a guy
And, ooh, what luck
'Cause here he is
Ladies and gentlemen... presenting the silver-tongued prince of the courtroom.
The one, the only Billy Flynn.
I don't care about expensive things
Cashmere coats, diamond rings
Don't mean a thing
All I care about is love
- That's what he's here for
- That's what I'm here for
I don't care for wearing silk cravats
Ruby studs, satin spats
Don't mean a thing
- All I care about is love
- All he cares about is love
Give me two eyes of blue
Softly saying
"I need you"
Let me see her standing there
And honest, mister,
I'm a millionaire
I don't care for any fine attire
Vanderbilt might admire
No, no, not me
- All I care about is love
- All he cares about is love
Good morning, ladies.
- Not guilty!
- You tell 'em, sweetheart.
That's what he's here for
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Miss Kelly, do you remember anything about that night?
I passed out completely.
I can't remember a thing.
Only that I didn't do it.
Any idea who did, dear?
No, but my client is offering a substantial reward to anyone with information about this crime.
How much is the reward,
Miss Kelly?
I don't know. How much?
We'll work it out after the trial.
If there are no more questions...
Miss Kelly and I have work to do.
What's this about a reward?
Awfully dumb, reporters.
They'll write it up wrong.
You deny the whole thing later.
Thank you.
All he cares about is love
Mr. Flynn, I'm Roxie Hart.
- Who?
- Mama talked to you about me.
Oh, yeah, right.
The cute one.
I was hoping that you might represent me.
You got $5,000?
Gee, that's a lot of money.
Mama didn't say anything about $5,000.
Lookit, Mr. Flynn,
I'm not very good at this... but maybe we could make some sort of arrangement between us?
I can be an awfully good sport.
Good, you got that out of your system.
You mean just one thing to me.
You call me when you got $5,000.
All he cares about is love
Show me long raven hair
Flowin' down about to there
When I see her runnin' free
Keep your money, that's enough for me
I don't care for drivin' Packard cars
Or smoking long buck cigars
No, no, not me
All I care about is doin' the guy in
Who's pickin' on you
Twistin' the wrist that's turnin' the screw
- All he cares about
- All I care about
Is love
Oh, he'll see you now.
Well, hello, Andy.
My name is Amos.
That's right.
Take a seat.
You're a remarkable man.
Your wife two-times you... plugs the guy, then tries to pin it on you.
Most men would let a dame like that swing.
But, no, you're sticking by her.
Makes you a hero in my eyes.
That's right.
I'm a hero.
Did you bring the money?
I didn't do as well as I hoped.
But I will, Mr. Flynn.
This is only a thousand.
Plus there's $300 I borrowed from the guys at the garage.
There's $700 from the building-and-loan fund.
And that's all I got so far.
But I'll give you $20 off my salary every week.
I'll give you notes with interest. Double. Triple.
When you came to me yesterday...
I didn't ask if she was guilty or innocent.
I didn't ask if she was a drunk or a dope fiend. No.
I said, "Do you have $5,000?"
You said yes.
But you don't have $5,000.
I figure you're a dirty liar.
I don't waste my time with dirty liars.
Look. I'm real sorry,
Mr. Flynn.
On the other hand... your devotion to your wife is really very, very touching.
I took your wife's case, and I'll keep it... because I play square.
Now, look, Hart...
I don't like to blow my own horn, but if Jesus Christ had lived in Chicago today and if he had $5,000 and he'd come to me, things would have turned out differently.
All right, this is what we're gonna do.
By the end of the week,
I'm gonna have Roxie's name on the front page of every newspaper in town.
"Sweetest little jazz killer ever to hit Chicago."
That's the angle I'm after.
You make an announcement we're gonna have an auction.
We got to raise money for her defense.
They'll buy everything she's ever touched.
Your shoes, your dresses, your perfume, your underwear.
And Victrola records.
Like the one I was playing when I shot the bastard.
I didn't hear that.
Not that I didn't have grounds.
- Hey, what are they?
- That's for trial.
Nobody's gonna care a lick what your defense is unless they care about you.
The first thing we do is work up sympathy from the press.
They're not all pushovers like Mary Sunshine.
But there's one thing that they can never resist... and that is a reformed sinner.
So, what was your favorite subject in school?
Oh, I was a real dummy.
There must have been something you were really good at.
I got high marks on courtesy and hygiene.
Perfect.
You wanted to be a nun.
A nun?
Where were you born?
On a chicken farm outside of Lubbock.
Southern home filled with every luxury and refinement.
Where are your parents?
Probably on the front porch in their rocking chairs.
Parents dead.
Family fortune swept away.
You were educated at the Sacred Heart.
Then you fell into a runaway marriage.
Left you miserable, alone, unhappy.
You got all swept up in the mad whirl of the city.
Jazz, cabarets, liquor.
You were drawn like a moth to the flame.
Now the mad whirl has ceased.
You are a butterfly crushed on the wheel.
Which is it? Is it the moth or the butterfly?
You have sinned, and you are sorry.
God, that's beautiful.
Cut out God.
Stay where you're better acquainted.
Kid, when I'm through with you, not only will you be acquitted, every man on that jury will want to take you home to meet his mother.
I was born on a beautiful Southern convent.
What?
Oh, holy shit!
I'm never gonna get this straight.
Pipe down on the swearing.
From here on, you say nothing rougher than "Oh, dear."
Try again.
I was born on a...
I came up with more to do on the witness stand.
I thought I'd get all teary-eyed and ask to borrow your handkerchief.
Then I thought I'd take a peek at the jury like this.
Flash 'em a bit of thigh, huh?
What do you think?
Sounds great.
Don't you want to hear the rest?
Tomorrow, kiddo.
You're at the top of my list.
Well, well, well.
Sorry to be late, Mr. Flynn.
Hope you weren't too bored.
I like it.
I like it.
Hey, Pollyanna...
I heard your press conference is tomorrow.
Yeah, what's it to you?
Well, you wanted my advice, right?
Well, here it is.
Don't forget
Billy Flynn's number-one client is Billy Flynn.
Meaning what?
Meaning don't let him hog the spotlight.
You're the one they pay to see.
We can only sell them one idea at a time.
I can still see him coming at me with that awful look in his eyes.
And?
And we both reached for the gun.
That's right.
You both reached for the gun.
Ready?
Yeah.
- Miss Hart!
- Miss Hart!
Good day, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, Miss Sunshine.
My client has just entered a plea of not guilty.
We look forward to a trial at the earliest possible date.
Are there any questions?
Miss Sunshine.
As you know, my paper is dry.
Do you have any advice for young girls seeking to avoid a life of jazz and drink?
Absolutely, yes.
Mrs. Hart feels that it was the tragic combination of liquor and jazz which led to her downfall.
Next question, please.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I would like to say how flattered I am that y'all came to see me.
Mrs. Hart is very pleased -
I was a moth crushed on the wheel.
You know, a butterfly drawn to the...
I bet you want to know why I shot the bastard.
Shut up, dummy.
Mr. Billy Flynn in "The Press Conference Rag."
Notice how his mouth never moves.
Almost.
Where'd you come from?
Mississippi
And your parents?
Very wealthy
Where are they now?
Six feet under
But she was granted one more start
The Convent of the Sacred Heart
When'd you get here?
How old were you?
Don't remember
Then what happened?
I met Amos
And he stole my heart away
Convinced me to elope one day
Poor dear! I can't believe what you've been through!
A convent girl.
A runaway marriage.
Tell us, Roxie...
Who's Fred Casely?
My ex-boyfriend
Why'd you shoot him?
I was leavin'
Was he angry?
Like a madman
Still I said,
"Fred, move along"
She knew that she was doing wrong
Then describe it
He came toward me
With the pistol?
From my bureau
Did you fight him?
Like a tiger
He had strength, and she had none
And yet we both reached for the gun
Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, we both
Oh, yes, we both, oh, yes, we both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh, yes, we both reached for the gun, for the gun
Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, they both
Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes, they both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh, yes, they both reached for the gun, for the gun
Understandable
Understandable
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible
Comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible
How you feelin'?
Very frightened
Are you sorry?
Are you kidding?
That's your statement?
All I'd say is
Though my choo-choo jumped the track
I'd give my life to bring him back
- And?
- Stay away from
- What?
- Jazz and liquor
- And?
- And the men who
- What?
- Play for fun
- And what?
- That's the thought that
- Yeah?
- Came upon me
When?
When we both reached for the gun
Understandable
Understandable
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible
Comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible
Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, they both
Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes, they both reached for
Let me hear it.
The gun, the gun
Oh, yes, they both reached for the gun, for the gun
A little louder
Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, they both
Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes, they both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh, yes, they both reached for the gun, for the gun
Now you got it
Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, they both
Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes, they both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh, yes, they both reached for the gun, for the gun
Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, they both
Oh, yes, they both, oh, yes, they both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Both reached for the
Gun
Both reached for the gun
Move over, Al Capone.
The Windy City has taken a new criminal to its heart.
The name on everybody's lips is Roxie Hart.
The sweetest little lady ever accused of murder in Chicago.
Women want to look like her.
Fellas want to go out with her.
Some little girls even want to take her home.
Don't get any ideas, little lady.
On the other side of town... the assistant D.A. Promises the game little sharpshooter will swing before the year is up.
Who knows?
If he lives up to his word,
Assistant D.A. Harrison might become
Governor Harrison someday.
Back at the scene of the crime... everybody wants a little piece of Roxie Hart.
This jar of cold cream set her husband back $20.
Maybe this pretty little lady will get some of that famous Roxie style.
It seems everybody these days is rooting for Roxie Hart.
Take those wilting flowers to the orphanage and make sure they know who sent them.
So, kiddo, given any thought to what you want to do after Billy gets you off?
I think I'd like to go on the stage.
I figured as much.
I already called the Morris office.
Really?
How much is that gonna cost me?
My standard deal.
10% of all your takings.
Yeah, well, we'll see, Mama.
Besides, I don't even have an act yet.
Killing Fred Casely was your act.
Those stiffs in the audience want to say they saw somebody famous.
That's a freak act.
And besides,
I am better than that.
Well, of course you are, cupcake.
You can be as big as
Sophie Tucker.
You really think so?
Bigger than Cantor and Jolson combined.
I always wanted to have my name in all the papers.
Before I met Amos...
I used to date this well-to-do ugly bootlegger.
He used to like to take me out and show me off.
Ugly guys like to do that.
Once it said in the paper:
"Gangland's Al Capelli seen at Chez Vito with cute blond chorine."
That was me.
I clipped it, and I saved it.
You know, all my life,
I wanted to have my own act.
But, no. No, no.
They always turned me down.
One big world full of "no."
And then Amos came along.
Safe, sweet Amos...
...who never says no.
I've never done this before.
But, you know, it is such a special night.
You are such a great audience!
And I really feel like I can talk to you, you know?
So forget what you've read in the papers.
Forget what you've heard on the radio, because...
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Not that the truth really matters.
But I'm gonna tell you anyway.
In the bed department...
Amos was zero.
When he made love to me... it was like he was fixing a carburetor or something.
"I love ya, honey. I love ya."
Anyway,
I started fooling around.
Then I started screwing around, which is fooling around without dinner.
Then I met Fred Casely... who said that he could get me into vaudeville...
...but that didn't quite work out like I planned.
I guess it didn't really work out too great for Fred, either.
So I gave up on the whole vaudeville idea because you kinda figure after all those years...
...opportunity's just passed you by.
But it ain't
Oh, no, no, no, no, but it ain't
And now?
Well, if this Flynn guy gets me off... with all this publicity...
I got me a world full of "yes!"
The name on everybody's lips
Is gonna be Roxie
The lady rakin' in the chips
Is gonna be Roxie
I'm gonna be a celebrity
That means somebody everyone knows
They're gonna recognize my eyes
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose
From just some dumb mechanic's wife
I'm gonna be Roxie
Who says that murder's not an art?
And who, in case she doesn't hang
Can say she started with a bang?
Roxie Hart
Boys
They're gonna wait outside in line
To get to see
- Roxie
- Roxie
Think of those autographs
I'll sign
"Good luck to you"
Roxie
And I'll appear in a lavaliere
That goes all the way down to my waist
Here a ring, there a ring, everywhere a ring-a-ling
But always in the best of taste
I'm a star.
And the audience loves me, and I love them.
And they love me for loving them.
And I love them for loving me.
And we love each other.
And that's 'cause none of us got enough love in our childhoods.
And that's show biz...
...kid.
She's givin' up her humdrum life
- I'm gonna be - Sing it
- Roxie
She made a scandal and a start
And Sophie Tucker will shit, I know
To see her name get billed below
Roxie Hart
I can't take it anymore.
You can't go anywhere without hearing about that dumb tomato!
Oh, no, Mama, not you, too.
I have some bad news.
The tour has been canceled.
What?
Your name's been out of the papers too long.
All you read about today is that Hart kid.
She's hot.
And what am I supposed to do, huh?
Suck up to her like everybody else?
It couldn't hurt.
Over my dead body.
Mind if I join you?
Lights out. 10 minutes.
Smoke?
Look what some Johnny sent me.
Triple-cream caramels all the way from San Francisco.
I'm watching my figure.
You know, the trial.
Hey, great mention of you in the Trib today, huh?
You know, there have been so many.
I just can't keep track.
Did I tell you, you are exactly the same size as my sister?
You'd fit into her costumes perfectly.
Really?
Yeah. I was thinking with all the publicity that's piled up between us, and when Billy gets us off, we'd be a natural to do an act together.
You think so, huh?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Miss Velma Kelly in an act of desperation.
My sister and I had an act that couldn't flop
My sister and I were headed straight for the top
My sister and I earned a thou a week at least
Oh, yeah
But my sister is now unfortunately deceased
I know it's sad, of course
But a fact is still a fact
And now all that remains is the remains
Of a perfect
Double
Act
Watch this.
You have to imagine it with two people.
It's swell with two people.
First I'd
Then she'd
Then we'd
But I can't do it alone
Then she'd
Then I'd
Then we'd
But I can't do it alone
She'd say,
"What's your sister like?"
I'd say, "Men"
She'd say,
"You're the cat's meow"
Then we'd wow the crowd again
When she'd go
I'd go
We'd go
Then those dingdong daddies started to roar
Whistled, stomped, stamped on the floor
Yelling, screaming, begging for more
And we'd say, "Okay, fellas, keep your socks up
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet"
But I simply cannot do it
Alone
So, what do you think, huh?
Come on, you can say.
I know. You're right.
The first part's shit.
But the second part... is really nifty.
Okay.
She'd go
I'd go
We'd go
And then those two-bit
Johnnies did it up brown
To cheer the best attraction in town
They nearly tore the balcony down
And we'd say, "Okay, boys, we're going home
But before we go, here's a few more partin' shots"
And this we did in perfect unison
Now you've seen me going through it
You may think there's nothing to it
But I simply cannot do it
Alone
So, where was the part where you blew her brains out?
Okay, Roxie,
I'll level with you.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't bother.
You think you're fooling me?
You're all washed up, and it's me they want now.
And I'm a big star.
Single.
Oh, I almost forgot.
You were in the paper today, too... in the back, with the obituaries.
"Velma Kelly's trial has been postponed indefinitely."
Seven words. Wow.
Oh. Here's a little piece of advice.
Direct from me to you.
Lay off the caramels.
And now, for all you
Chicago stay-up-laters.
You night owls who only come alive after dark.
We dedicate this tune.
"Chicago After Midnight."
This all took place on Lakeshore Drive.
Incredible. Incredible.
All right. Yeah.
Thanks, Tom.
They just arrested this woman for a triple homicide.
Really?
Get this.
She's an heiress.
What?
All the family's in... pineapples, grapefruits, some kind of fruit.
So anyhow, this dame,
Kitty what's-her-name... she's playing house on the North Side in an apartment with a guy named Harry.
What Harry does for a living, no one's quite sure, but it doesn't matter because she's footing the bills.
Anyhow,
Kitty comes home tonight.
Harry's in bed, which is par for the course.
She goes to change.
When she returns, she notices something rather odd.
Extremely odd.
Kitty disappears for a second.
Cool as a cucumber.
When she returns, she gently wakes up Harry.
Harry says, "What? I'm alone."
She says, "Alone?
You got two other women in bed with you."
So, get this.
Harry says, "Come on, doll.
You gonna believe what you see or what I tell you?"
Good night, folks.
Give us the line!
Give us the line!
Miss Sunshine.
From the Evening Star.
I wonder if you wouldn't mind saying a word or two?
Sure, I'll say three.
Go to hell!
Please direct your questions to her counsel.
You're not my counsel, and I want my money back.
It's not your money.
It's your mother's money.
Are you sorry, dear?
Sure, I'm sorry.
Sorry I got caught.
- Oh, Miss Sunshine?
- Not now, Roxie.
I got a letter from a guy.
He says he's going on a hunger strike until I'm freed.
That's nice, dear.
Miss Baxter?
Did you know these two ladies personally?
Did I know these two ladies?
Was that your question?
Yeah, that's my -
She's very high-spirited, isn't she?
Miss Baxter?
Oh, hey, Mr. Flynn!
Mr. Flynn!
- Yeah, hi, Trixie.
- It's Roxie.
Yeah, sure,
I was just kidding.
Did you get my trial date yet?
Listen, kid...
I'm at the top of your list, right?
Go to hell!
Boy, what a hellion, huh?
She's a socialite, too.
Her mother owns all the pineapples in Hawaii.
What the hell do I care about pineapples?
- All right.
- Listen!
Miss Baxter will answer all of your questions.
Afterwards, I'll be happy to give you an interview myself.
How's it feel, kid?
J. Edgar Hoover couldn't find your name in the papers.
Mr. Flynn!
Someone open this door immediately!
Oh, my God!
Roxie! What is it, dear?
Oh! Oh, no.
Don't worry about me.
Oh, I only hope the fall didn't hurt the baby.
Baby?
Shit!
Roxie, when did this happen, darling?
Well, Doc, is she or isn't she?
She is.
Would you swear to that statement in court?
Yes.
Good.
Button your fly.
I would just like to say that... my own life doesn't matter now... just that of my unborn child.
You poor dear, to have your baby born in jail.
My readers won't stand for it.
I can assure you that won't happen.
She'll come to trial at the earliest moment.
I think it's sweet.
First time we ever had one of our girls knocked up.
When is the baby due, Roxie?
I just heard the good news.
I'm the father!
I'm the father!
Roxie, who's the father?
That question is completely out of line.
How dare you insult this brave, young woman.
That's enough.
Roxie, honey!
It's me! Daddy!
It's Daddy!
Roxie, I came as soon as I could!
If someone stood up in a crowd
And raised his voice up way out loud
And waved his arm and shook his leg
You'd notice him
If someone in the movie show
Yelled,
"Fire in the second row!
This whole place is a powder keg!"
You'd notice him
And even without clucking like a hen
Everyone gets noticed now and then
Unless, of course, that personage should be
Invisible
Inconsequential
Me
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
I tell ya
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
Oh. I didn't see you.
Sit down. Sit down.
Look, Andy, I'm afraid
I got to hit you hard.
And I can only hope that you'll be big about it.
Amos. My name is Amos.
Who said it wasn't?
Oh, it was the kid's name
I was thinking about, yeah.
You know when she's due?
September.
Oh, but pass out those cigars, anyway.
I don't want you to give a damn when people...
People what?
Laugh.
Laugh?
Why would they laugh?
'Cause they can count.
Can you count?
September.
Here's a copy of Roxie's first statement from the D.A.'s office.
It says she hadn't copulated with you for four months prior to the incident.
Well, she would know.
Yeah, I guess we hadn't done no copulating since...
Wait a minute.
That don't figure out right.
I couldn't be the father.
Forget about that now.
My client needs your support.
You mean she needs a meal ticket.
That's all I ever been.
This time she's gone too far.
What are you gonna do?
Divorce her?
You're damn right!
I'll divorce her!
She probably won't even notice.
Yeah?
Yeah, put him through.
A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
Unless that human being next to you
Is unimpressive
Undistinguished
You
Know
Who
You still here, Andy?
Yeah, I'm still here.
I think.
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
I tell ya
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
Never even
Know
I'm there
I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.
I've been waiting 10 minutes.
Don't do that again.
This dress makes me look like a Woolworth's lampshade.
I'm not wearing this.
You're wearing it because I tell you to wear it.
When Andy's on the stand,
I want you to be knitting.
Knitting?
Oh, for Christ sakes.
- A baby garment.
- I don't know how to knit!
Then learn.
That is no way to win a jury's sympathy.
Oh, you don't need advice anymore.
Lookit here, Mr. Mouthpiece... it seems to me that I am the one who's coming up with the good ideas.
I am sick of everybody telling me what to do.
You treat me like dirt.
You treat me like I'm some dumb common criminal.
But you are.
Well, it's better than being a greasy Mick lawyer.
Who happens to be saving your ass!
Who's out for all he can steal!
Maybe you'd like to appear in court without me.
Well, maybe I could.
Have you read the morning papers?
They love me!
Wise up! They'd love you a lot more if you were hanged.
You know why?
'Cause they'd sell more papers.
You're fired.
I quit.
Any lawyer in this town would die to have my case.
You are a phony celebrity.
You're a flash in the pan.
In a couple of weeks, no one's gonna give a shit about you.
That's Chicago.
What happened?
It's the Hunyak.
She lost her last appeal.
So what's that mean?
Well, that means that next week, she's gonna...
This is Mary Sunshine coming to you from the Cook County Jail... where history will be made today.
Katalin Helinski will become the first woman in the state of Illinois to be executed.
And so, ladies and gentlemen...
And now, ladies and gentlemen... for your pleasure and your entertainment... we proudly present
Katalin Helinski and her famous
Hungarian disappearing act.
You know, it's really not that bad.
You clear about everything we agreed on?
Yep. I've been up all night rehearsing.
What do you do when Harrison starts coming after you?
I sit still and look straight ahead... never at the jury.
- And?
- And I look modest.
- And?
- And...
- And say nothing.
- That's right.
- That was the deal, right?
- Right.
You asked me back.
I do all the talking this time.
Absolutely, Billy.
Whatever you say.
Mr. Flynn.
His Honor's here.
Thank you.
You ready?
Yeah.
I'm scared.
Ah, don't be.
I've been around a long time.
Believe me. You got nothing to worry about.
It's all a circus.
A three-ring circus.
These trials, the whole world.
It's all show business.
But, kid...
You're working with a star.
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle 'em
Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it
And the reaction will be passionate
Give 'em the old hocus pocus
Bead and feather 'em
How can they see with sequins in their eyes?
What if your hinges all are rusting?
What if, in fact, you're just disgusting?
Razzle dazzle 'em
And they'll never catch wise
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle 'em
Give 'em a show that's so splendiferous
Row after row will grow vociferous
Give 'em the old flimflam flummox
Fool and fracture 'em
How can they hear the truth above the roar?
Throw 'em a fake and a finagle
They'll never know you're just a bagel
Razzle dazzle 'em
And they'll beg you for more
- I object!
- Sustained.
Your Honor, I haven't even asked the question yet.
Give 'em the old double whammy
Daze and dizzy 'em
Back since the days of old Methuselah
Everyone loves the big bamboozler
Give 'em the old three-ring circus
Stun and stagger 'em
When you're in trouble, go into your dance
Though you are stiffer than a girder
They'll let you get away with murder
Razzle dazzle 'em
And you got a romance
Hello, Amos.
Amos.
That's right, Mr. Flynn.
Amos.
Amos, when did you file suit for divorce?
A month ago.
Was there any reason at this time?
I'll say.
The newspapers said Roxie was expecting a little stranger.
That's hardly grounds for divorce, is it?
A little too much of a stranger.
You mean you doubted the paternity of the child.
Well, sure.
Tell me, Amos.
You share a bed with your wife?
Yes, sir, every night.
And you expect this jury to believe that you slept next to this woman every night without exercising your rights as a husband?
Well, I could've if I wanted to.
- Oh, but you didn't.
- No, I did.
- Did what?
- Want to.
- But you didn't.
- Didn't what?
- What you wanted.
- Wait. I'm getting confused.
Did you ever question
Roxie herself?
Did you ask her if you were the father of her child?
No, sir.
But if you became convinced that you were wrong... you'd be man enough to admit it.
You'd take her back if Roxie swore that you were the father.
- Which she does.
- She does?
She does! She does!
No more questions!
You can step down now.
Well done, Andy.
Oh, Roxie, I'm so sorry.
Aw!
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle 'em
Show 'em the first-rate sorcerer you are
Long as you keep 'em way off balance
How can they spot you got no talents?
Razzle dazzle 'em
This is the moment we've been waiting for.
Roxie Hart finally takes the stand in her own defense.
And they'll make you a star
Order! Order!
Proceed, Mr. Flynn.
Roxie,
I have here a statement in which you admit to having illicit relations with the deceased,
Fred Casely.
Is this true or false?
I'm afraid that's true.
You're an honest girl, Roxie.
When did you first meet
Fred Casely?
When he sold Amos and me our furniture.
Your personal relationship with him - could you tell the jury when that began?
When I permitted him to escort me home one night.
I don't think
I would've gone with him if Mr. Hart and me hadn't quarrelled that very morning.
- Quarrelled?
- Yes, sir.
Well, I suppose it was his fault.
Oh, no, sir.
It was my fault.
I suppose I just couldn't stop pestering him.
Pestering him?
About what?
I didn't like him working those long hours at the garage.
I wanted him home with me... to darn his socks and iron his shirts.
I wanted a real home and a child.
So you drifted into this illicit relationship because you were unhappy at home.
Yes. I was most unhappy.
Roxie Hart!
The state has accused you of the murder of Fred Casely!
Are you guilty or not guilty?
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I killed him.
I did, but I'm not a criminal.
I'm not a criminal!
Do you recall the night of January 14th?
Could you tell the jury, in your own words, the happenings of that night?
Well, when Fred came over,
I told him my good news.
And what was that?
That me and Amos were gonna have a baby.
And that it was all over between us.
What happened then?
Well, then...
Then...
Did he threaten you, Roxie?
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel is leading the witness!
Sustained.
What did Casely say when you told him the news?
"I'll kill you before I'll see you have another man's child!"
Could you tell the audience - the jury - what happened next?
Well, in his passion, he tore off my robe... and he threw me on the bed.
And Mr. Hart's pistol was lying there between us.
And then?
We both reached for the gun, but I got it first.
Then he came toward me with this funny look in his eyes.
He was angry and wild!
- Wild!
- Wild!
Did you think he meant to kill you?
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
So it was his life or yours?
And not just mine.
I closed my eyes, and I shot!
In defense of your life!
To save my husband's innocent, unborn child!
- Roxie!
- Order!
What a bull's-eye, huh?
Order in this court!
I'll clear this court if necessary.
There's pandemonium here in the courtroom.
Order! Bailiff!
Mrs. Hart's behavior throughout this ordeal has been truly extraordinary.
Yeah, I bet it has.
Opening her eyes, she fans herself with her attorney's handkerchief.
- Handkerchief?
- Poor child has had no relief.
She looks around bewildered, seeming to want something.
Oh, it's a glass of water.
Oh, Mama, that was my bit!
I told Billy I was gonna do that at my trial!
But now her eyes flutter wildly, and she -
Mrs. Hart has fainted again.
Oh, jeez.
She slumps over, her chiffon dress up around her knees, revealing a glimpse of a blue garter with a rhinestone buckle.
Oh, Mama, she stole my garter.
- She stole my garter!
- Don't break my radio!
First, the slob steals my publicity.
Then she steals my lawyer, my trial date.
Now my goddamn garter!
What do you expect?
These days you get a little success... and it's good riddance to the people who put you there.
There ain't no justice in the world.
And there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Nerts to that.
You think I got you up here just so you can listen to my radio?
People write some pretty interesting things when they think no one's looking.
Oh, Mama.
The state calls a rebuttal witness.
Left hand on the Bible, raise your right hand.
You swear to tell the truth, so help you God?
And then some.
Have a seat.
Would you state your name for the record, please?
Velma Kelly.
Miss Kelly, will you please tell the court if the object I am holding is the one you happened to come upon in the defendant's jail cell?
Yes, it is.
I submit this as Exhibit "X."
Roxie Hart's diary.
I object!
My client has never kept a diary.
And even if she did, this would be invasion of privacy in violation of the Fourth Amendment and illegal search without a warrant.
Yeah.
And she broke the lock.
Order! Order!
Well, that settles that.
I'll allow it.
What's the big deal?
It's just a bunch of doodlings.
If you would read for us, please.
I haven't worked in a while.
"What a laugh, plugging Fred Casely.
The big baboon had it coming.
I'm just sorry
I only got to kill him once."
I never wrote that!
You...
Hey, she made that up!
- Order! Order!
- She made that up!
Please, Mr. Flynn, get control of your client.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.
Sit down. Shut up.
It's only making it worse.
I have no more questions.
Your witness, Mr. Flynn.
Ladies and gentlemen, a tap dance.
Miss Kelly, did you make a deal with Mr. Harrison?
Maybe to drop all charges against you in exchange for testifying?
Well, sure.
I'm not a complete idiot.
Good. Good.
Since you gave such an impressive performance for Mr. Harrison, maybe you'd do me the same honor.
- I'd be delighted.
- Thank you.
"Fred Casely assured me he'd get me an audition down at the Onyx.
Then he reneged on his pledge, and that was my motive for attacking him."
Pretty fancy way of saying
"He's a big fat liar who welshed on a deal, so I shot him."
"Amos accused me of having an affair... so I told him that the charge was erroneous."
Objection, Your Honor!
Mr. Flynn is twisting this evidence to draw conclusions that are specious and...
- Erroneous?
- Exactly!
Order! Order!
Miss Kelly, do you know the meaning of the word perjury?
- Yes, I do.
- Do you know it's a crime?
Yes.
If it turns out that you knew that this diary was a fake...
I'd hate to think of you rotting in prison for the next 10 years.
Since you won your freedom.
Look, all I know is what I was told.
Oh, so, all right.
So you didn't find this diary in Roxie's cell?
No.
Mama - Miss Morton gave it to me.
She said someone sent it to her.
Someone? Any idea who this mysterious benefactor might be?
No. She didn't know.
All right, let's see if we can work this out.
Someone who writes about reneging on pledges and erroneous charges.
Call me crazy. Doesn't that sound like a lawyer?
A lawyer who had a sample of my client's handwriting.
Mr. Harrison, didn't you ask Roxie to write out a confession?
Yes. You're not suggesting
I tampered with evidence?
No. I wouldn't.
Don't be ridiculous.
No. That's thoroughly and utterly absurd.
Now that you mention it...
Your Honor, this is outrageous!
I know. I agree.
To even suggest that the prosecutor would make a thieves' bargain with Velma Kelly... then fabricate the very evidence that set her free!
Just so you can win another case and move one step closer to the Governor's Mansion!
Why, it's simply beyond all imagining!
I'll hold you in contempt!
No, it is not even conceivable!
But if it were, wouldn't it be time to say:
"Come clean, Mr. Harrison"?
Even in Chicago, this kind of corruption cannot stand!
Will not stand!
That's enough, Mr. Flynn!
I agree, Your Honor!
It is enough!
The defense rests.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mary Sunshine... reporting live from the Cook County Courthouse.
The city of Chicago has come to a complete standstill... as the trial of the century finally draws to a close.
Mrs. Hart sits quietly at the defense table.
Hands folded.
Wondering what fate has in store for her.
And now a hush falls over the courtroom... as the 12 men of the jury file slowly back to their seats.
Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
The jury has reached a verdict.
Will the defendant please rise?
What is your verdict?
We, the jury, find the defendant...
Roxie Hart is innocent!
She's innocent!
Get your paper!
Roxie Hart is free!
She's free!
Come on! Move it!
First she shoots the husband, then she plugs the lawyer.
Don't you want to take my picture?
I'm the famous Roxie Hart.
Hey, what happened?
Billy, what the hell happened?
This is Chicago, kid.
You can't beat fresh blood on the walls.
But my publicity, Billy.
My name in the papers.
I was counting on that.
Your gratitude is overwhelming, kid.
I just saved your life.
Yeah, and you got $5,000.
And what do I get?
I get nothing?
It's $10,000 once I collect from Velma.
I get nothing?
Oh, don't forget your blessed diary.
Hope you don't mind.
I added a few erroneous phrases.
Sorry I couldn't tell you.
Couldn't take a chance.
I never lost a case.
You're a free woman,
Roxie Hart.
And God save Illinois.
What do you want?
I want you to come home.
You said you still wanted to.
And the baby.
Baby? What baby?
Oh, Jesus.
What do you take me for?
There ain't no baby.
There ain't no baby?
They didn't even want my picture.
I can't understand that.
Why didn't they even want my picture?
It's good
Isn't it grand?
Isn't it great?
Isn't it swell?
Isn't it fun?
Isn't it?
Nowadays
Ladies and gentlemen...
Miss Roxie Hart says
"Good night."
There's men everywhere
Jazz everywhere
Booze everywhere
Life everywhere
Joy everywhere
Nowadays
You can like the life you're livin'
You can live the life you like
You can even marry Harry
But mess around with Ike
And that's good
Isn't it grand?
Isn't it great?
Isn't it swell?
Isn't it fun?
Isn't it?
But nothing
Stays
You can like the life you're living
You can live the life you like
Didn't she kill a guy awhile back?
Ah, who can keep them straight anymore?
But mess around with Ike
And that's good
Isn't it grand?
Isn't it great?
That's great!
We'll be in touch.
I'm not quite finished yet.
Wait, wait, wait.
One more.
I could...
Just a second.
I'm not -
God damn it!
Thank you!
Here's the music, hon.
Thanks.
God damn it.
You know, you're really pretty good.
Yeah, that and a dime.
What are you doing here?
I heard you been making the rounds.
If it was up to you,
I'd be swinging by now.
I always knew
Billy would get you off.
You should learn how to put things behind you.
Oh, thank you.
I'll put that at the top of my list.
Right after finding a job and an apartment with a john.
Shut up and listen to me!
You really are something.
Coming in here like some goddamn queen bee.
All full of advice for a poor slob like me.
Let me tell you something,
Miss Velma Kelly.
I got a new life now.
One of the best things about it is it don't include you.
I thought we could help each other.
You thought wrong, didn't you?
Listen to me.
I talked to this guy downtown.
He said one jazz killer is nothing these days... but two...
We could make a couple of hundred a week.
Think about it, Roxie.
Our faces back in the papers.
Our names on the marquee.
Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart.
Shouldn't it be alphabetical?
That could work.
Couple hundred?
Maybe we could ask for a thou.
We're worth it.
Forget it.
It'll never work.
Why not?
'Cause I hate you.
There's only one business in the world where that's no problem at all.
Ladies and gentlemen... the Chicago Theater is proud to announce a first.
The first time anywhere there's been an act of this nature.
Not only one little lady.
But two.
You've read about them in the papers.
And now here they are.
Chicago's own killer-dillers.
Those scintillating sinners.
Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly!
You can like the life you're livin'
You can live the life you like
You can even marry Harry
But mess around with Ike
And that's good
Isn't it grand?
Isn't it great?
Isn't it swell?
Isn't it fun?
Isn't it?
But nothing stays
In 50 years or so
It's gonna change, you know
But, oh, it's heaven
Nowadays
Okay, you babes of jazz, let's pick up the pace.
Let's make the parties longer, the skirts shorter.
Let's all go to hell in a fast car and keep it hot!
Me and Roxie, we'd just like to say thank you!
Thank you!
Believe us, we could not have done it without you!
And all
That
Jazz
That jazz
While truckin' down the road of life
Although all hope seems gone
I just move on
When I can't find a single star
To hang my wish upon
I just move on
I move on
I run so fast
A shotgun blast
Can hurt me not one bit
I'm on my toes
'Cause heaven knows
A moving target's hard to hit
So as we play an ice ballet
We're not the dying swan
We just move on
We move on
Just when it seems
We're out of dreams
And things have got us down
We don't despair
We don't go there
We hang our bonnets out of town
So there's no doubt
We're well cut out
To run life's marathon
We just move on
We just move on
So fleet of foot
We can't stay put
We just move on
Yes, we move on
Come on, babe, why don't we paint the town
And all that jazz?
I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down
And all that jazz
Start the car,
I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold, but the piano's hot
It's just a noisy hall where there's a nightly brawl
And all
That
Jazz
Find a flask, we're playing fast and loose
And all that jazz
Right up here is where I store the juice
And all that jazz
Come on, babe, we're gonna brush the sky
I betcha Lucky Lindy never flew so high
'Cause in the stratosphere, how could he lend an ear
To all
That
Jazz?
Oh, you're gonna see your sheba shimmy-shake
And all that jazz
Oh, she's gonna shimmy till her garters break
And all that jazz
Show her where to park her girdle
Oh, her mother's blood will curdle
If she'd hear her baby's queer
For all
That
Jazz
Come on, babe, why don't we paint the town
And all that jazz?
I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down
And all that jazz
Start the car,
I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold, but the piano's hot
It's just a noisy hall where there's a nightly brawl
And all
That
Jazz
No, I'm no one's wife
But, oh, I love my life
And all
That
Jazz
That jazz
This film is based on a true story.
In 1996, during the first Chechen war, the bordering region of lngushetia was threatened with invasion by Chechen detachments.
A psychiatric hospital was located near this border.
The inmates lived their lives unaware of the coming events.

What are you morons ogling at?
Who takes those trains these days?
Nothing but cheap dealers.
Everyone's smuggling stuff somewhere.
Russia's got the clothing fever.
And our Little Nell is posing like some Greek statue in the Pushkin Museum.
Ever heard of that museum, you shitheads?
Cleaning detail, finish up.
The rest of you, get to bed.
You hear me?
Yes, sir!
So, you losers, seen enough?
Had your little fix?
Shame on you.
War and stupidity will feed this generation.
A generation of junkies and trash.
I spit in your faces.
"Thunder rumbles on the front
"My boots tramp on regardless
"Charge, onwards to the enemy!"
Wipe that up, please.
Get lost, scumbag.
Wipe it up.
I spit on you all, the runts and the tyrants,
Iinks in the chain of strength trampling my homeland!
Physical abuse is illegal.
That's a violation of the law on psychiatric care and the rights of the citizen adopted in July 1992 by the Supreme Soviet.
-Wipe it up!
-I'll do it!
Wait.
Leave her alone.
She has bad nerves.
-She spat, she cleans it up.
-Who do you think you are?
To give me orders!
You maniac, schizophrenic bald scribbler!
Maniac, schizophrenic, bald scribbler!
A man must not force a woman.
You animal! Goddamn screw!
Flunky!
In the camp, guys like you were smothered under mattresses.
-Get up!
-Come on!
You're humiliating humanity.
Your turn will come one day.
Just wait a while and we'll change places.
I'll spit and you'll wipe it up.
"Sit down by my side
"Take me in your arms and sing
"l feel so alone without you
"But complete when you're near"
Open up! Who locked me in?
Crazy bitch.
"Sit down by my side..."
Good morning, my love.
He's covered in fly shit again.
Damn things!
I thought I'd killed them all.
I dreamt he sang me love songs again.
I dreamt of cocks again.
Cocks with wings like angels flying all around me.
He's missing me so much.
I can tell he's waiting for me.
Give it a rest.
I bet he already has a wife.
Are you stupid, Lucia, or what?
She's a girlfriend.
He doesn't love her.
He knows he has a fiancee in Russia.
For the wedding day,
I'll buy a big white hat.
Hats really suit me.
Lucia! There! There it is!
Bastard!
I'll beat the shit out of you!
Quiet!
It's dead.
Stop pushing.
You're not getting through,
I'm next!
-What about your toilet?
-Flooded again.
You'll crap all over ours again.
Have you seen Goga?
You haven't seen him?
Goga!
We'll miss our turn!
Have you seen Goga anywhere?
-Has Mahmud been here?
-Yeah, but he's gone again.
Where's my place?
He was keeping it.
Get to the back of the line,
Citizen Atanessian.
Hey, Tut-tut, come out now!
Shorty's going to burst.
You were keeping my place?
Where am l?
I was here before anyone for you.
Gangway!
Stop! Let Goga through.
I'm going nowhere.
Never!
No privileges here!
This is the women's toilet.
Come on, Shorty's bursting.
A real mafia, selling places in line.
Get out of there, bitch!
I have a bladder!
Here, this is for later.
And that's for you so you won't be jealous.
Lucia told me everything.
Just think!
Be quiet or there'll be trouble!
Understand?
See you.
See you.
Doctor, are we eating with the women again?
Don't you like it?
Oh, we do!
If you behave, you can eat with them every day.
That's a violation of the rules governing psychiatric care.
Vika, our rules were written ages ago.
In America, they've done it for years.
The quiet patients eat together.
It has a beneficial effect.
But if you'd rather eat alone, that's no problem.
Doctor, can you give me something so I don't need to poo?
I'm sick to death of having to queue every day.
You can't have it all, Mahmud.
Life's like that.
Like what?
Well...
It's when new shit is produced every day.
Nothing to laugh about.
That definition has a certain depth to it.
Misha!
Wait!
Roustam, watch Vika closely!
Do your best!
Go on! Well done, Zoia!
Now, the bridge!
Let's stop and do the bridge!
Lie down!
Heads towards me!
Good, Lucia!
Well done! Congratulations!
Zoia's the best at it.
Vika, careful!
You'll break your neck!
Janna, look, I'm a yogi!
Well done, Shorty!
Give him a round of applause.
Well done, Shorty!
Give him a big hand!
It wasn't me!
Hurray! We're burning!
"Two guitars behind the wall
"Strike up a sad song...
"You and I lie together
"On a narrow bed
"You stare at the ceiling
"And seem to count the flies
"l feel so lonely
"And you don't even see"
Can I have your porridge?
-Who's that?
-Grandpa.
A tooth!
A tooth in my porridge!
A human tooth!
You know what this means, comrades?
Imagine what they're feeding us if our teeth are falling out.
I want to know.
Who did this?
Who gave Mahmud matches?
-You don't know?
-Who's asking you?
Who's going to own up?
I warned you not to give him matches.
Do you want to be burned alive or what?
He's capable of it!
Well?
Who'll own up?
I already told you it wasn't me.
It wasn't me!
Stay away, you're going to hurt me!
My bladder! Put me down!
Don't touch me.
Aminazine up the backside.
Strap them to their beds.
Very well.
Do we have to force-feed you?
Aren't you sick of it?
You can be so stubborn.
You know very well
I'm going to do it.
There'll be no train today.
All go back to your rooms.
-ls it broken?
-No, it's fine.
He's just tired of pulling those heavy carriages.
Even iron locomotives get tired sometimes.
All go back quietly to your rooms.
The phone's cut off and the radio's dead.
What does that mean?
It's not good.
We'll have to evacuate the patients.
But we'll need to find money first.
Fire me if you want, doctor, but
I won't spend the night here.
What are you doing?
Give it back!
-Let me have a go.
-You'll break it!
It's not going to break!
"Water flows from the well..."
Tell him. It's my accordion!
Lucia, they've taken my accordion.
What's wrong?
They've taken my Shorty away!
That faggot Goga. The asshole!
I'll smash his head in with my iron.
They're in the women's ward.
-Who let the violent ward out?
-We did.
-What if the doctor finds out?
-He's not here!
The rats have deserted the ship!
The Communist regime is over!
Freedom!
Stop it!
You should be ashamed!
I'll untie you.
Shorty, my love, are you all right?
Do you like my wig?
It's Claudia's, the second floor nurse.
Open up!
Vika let the violent ward out!
The doctor went for a bus to evacuate us.
I woke up at 4 in the morning.
The place was deserted.
Freedom! Down with Fascism!
Take to the streets!
I'll go.
Not a soul.
The coast is clear! Hurray!
Down with the bars!
Break it down!
Bombs! Mother!
Faster!
-Wash the floor.
-But we're being attacked!
Even if it's a world war,
I don't give a shit!
I warned you, Vika!
Play!
Will they kill us?
Tank regiments are commanded by total idiots.
You send in the infantry first, then the tanks.
It wasn't me!
Don't kill me!
Don't worry.
We won't hurt you.
Don't hurt me.
It's nothing to do with me!
Wow! She's hairy.
It's a man.
-Where's the doctor?
-Getting buses.
-Who are you?
-Alikhan.
I need a room without windows for the prisoners.
In the basement.
Spirit and bandages for the casualties.
Upstairs, in the interns' office.
But the violent patients have locked themselves in.
Cut it, instead of staring!
Will you fucking cut it or not?
-We need spirit.
-I have some cologne.
Over here.
Hold me down.
Pour it on!
That hurts.
Hello.
What's the sense in sending three of you to cover her?
She never listens!
We told her not to go!
We couldn't stop her!
You lay down your life for a sniper.
Calm down. Got any antibiotics?
Hand them over.
She's a woman?
Yes, a Lithuanian.
With nerves of steel.
-ls the basement this way?
-Yes.
Did we scare you?
What are you, a bandit group?
This is Shorty.
Janna, I'm hungry.
Everyone's hungry.
I haven't eaten a thing all day.
Let go of me!
Remember the guy with the green eyes?
As soon as I saw them,
I got goose bumps.
Did you see his beard, Zoia?
Nice and soft.
You hear? I touched his beard.
It was so soft.
They've taken my accordion again.
He pressed me up against the wall and said he could guess my name.
I said,
"You'll never guess."
Hello.
Come in and help us.
Do you like it?
That's my accordion.
It is? You know how to play?
I don't believe you!
I do know how.
Sit down and show us, then.
Come on, don't be afraid.
You're pretty. Are you a nurse?
-I live here.
-You're sick, then.
I used to be but I'm not anymore.
A polka?
Any other pretty girls?
Yes.
A lot?
There's Lucia.
I share a room with her.
Then there's Sonia.
And Vika, she's very beautiful.
You play well.
-I can dance too.
-You dance?
You're kidding us!
I'm doing the circus school exam.
I can even tap-dance.
Incredible! Show us.
I don't have the right shoes.
Show us anyway.
What music do you want?
Something fast.
Faster.
Do you believe me now?
What a woman of passion!
Will you marry me?
You want to marry me?
Marry you?
Yes, today. We can hold the wedding this evening.
Are you crazy?
I already have a fiance.
Damn! Where is he?
In America, on tour.
One fiance's not enough for a woman like you.
One in America, one here.
Ask my friends.
Ahmed never lies.
Bring your accordion tonight.
You will come?
I'll be waiting!
What a fiance!
What's up? You want kebabs?
The Russians are coming!
Ahmed, get up to the roof.
Quick!
MENTAL PATlENTS
Don't shoot!
We've an offer to make.
Are you going to shoot?
Make sure you don't miss.
Don't shoot!
Get out!
What do you want?
My captain wants to speak to yours.
Captain, come here.
Well?
We have one of your corpses.
Want to lD it?
Check if it's one of ours.
Any dope?
Two crates of ammo for 5 ounces.
1,500 rounds?
What kind of shit is it?
Top quality. Try some.
We don't sell crap.
Okay. We'll leave the crates with the body.
Well?
It's Salman.
How much?
Two thousand bucks.
Tell Mahomet, he'll fix it.
Take Askhab and get the body.
Let's sit down a while and count the money.
All right.
A villager said he was yours.
If not, we wouldn't have known.
Count out two thousand.
No hundred-dollar bills?
Small bills aren't money for you?
You went begging to gather all that together?
Fuck me!
The 20th Paratrooper Regiment.
You were in Afghanistan, then?
Did you guys save our asses in the Chungur ambush?
Your commander had a stammer.
Poltavchenko, a great guy.
You said it.
What's your name?
There's time for a quick joint.
You'll really marry me?
It went off by accident!
Hold your fire!
Our captain's over there!
You fuckwits!
Are you totally wasted?
Sir...
Shut it!
You'll end up in deeper shit!
Captain!
Wait!
Get back in!
Hurry!
You forgot the money!
We'll manage without it!
We had an agreement.
Give it to your mullah!
I owe you that after Chungur.
I'm sorry.
You will forgive me, won't you?
I'll pray for you every day.
I won't abandon you.
You'll find someone else.
What are you doing?
-Nothing.
-Where are you going?
Lucia, are you afraid of men?
Me? Yes. I don't know... No.
I'm getting married.
He asked for my hand.
Who?
The best-looking Chechen, in a black hat.
He plays the accordion too.
It takes your breath away.
That's it!
I can't cheat on him.
On who?
Bryan.
He'll find two new ones.
You can have my new patent leather shoes.
No, I can't accept.
Take them, please.
I'll just try them on, then.
Perfect.
If Bryan comes tomorrow, what'll you tell him?
Go, don't turn down your chance to be happy. Go!
Go!
No, I can't go!
It only happens once in a lifetime, never twice.
So?
I have some presents for you too.
Goga, here. "The Miraculous
Power of Water".
Thank you.
Zoia...
-My toy elephant.
-I'll take it later.
Take it now, I'm going.
Thank you.
A silver spoon for your first baby.
Can I have your accordion?
I can't, it's my breadwinner.
As my dad, the human torso, used to say.
Hi, everyone.
Janna, I've never been good at giving presents but I don't think this will spoil things, far from it, in fact.
I wish you happiness.
I only wore it once.
A hat!
I've dreamt of one.
Hats suit me so well!
To be honest,
I never thought you'd do something like this.
It's a powerful symbol.
As the world ignores this tragedy, you're marrying a man who is fighting against Russian imperialist policy.
It's an act of international significance.
All the mass media should know about it.
I call it popular diplomacy in action.
Even if,
I have to admit that I'm going to miss your gym classes terribly, along with your humanity.
I'm not afraid of saying it.
Shut your mouth, Vika.
All right.
We've found a proper wedding veil!
That's my bedspread.
Calm down, Vera.
I don't want a veil.
Hats suit me better.
Janna, come over here.
Roustam, help us.
One...
Two...
Three...
What a knockout!
Let's take a picture!
Ali's got the camera.
Where is he?
He's locked himself in his room.
I knocked but he didn't answer.
Can I come in?
Give us the camera, please.
There's no film left.
You want to upset me but it won't work.
No, it's really all gone.
I have a gift for you.
You mustn't leave.
Lucia says I mustn't miss my chance.
It only happens once.
You mustn't go.
Bye!
There's a war outside.
Let go, you're hurting me.
Are you stupid or what?
I've brought you an apple.
Eat it. That way the nurse won't shout at you.
Zoia will grate it for you.
I've got a hat.
Andrei, sweety.
The hat.
See you.
See you.
Last New Year, we kissed, you remember?
This will be the second time.
Keep the curtain closed or the flies will crap all over Bryan again.
Vika, be careful when you do the bridge.
Don't go breaking your neck.
Fedia, you're a plumber, so fix the toilets.
There...
Bye.
I'm going.
Bye.
-Where are you going?
-I'll see her to the gate.
Let's go upstairs to watch her go.
Let's go.
Hello.
-Hello.
-Hi.
Come on in, women are always welcome.
Be careful here.
Hello.
Here I am.
Ahmed, your fiancee's here.
Ahmed's marrying his beauty.
You were right to come.
Sit down at the table.
Next to your fiance.
Get her a clean plate.
Ahmed, why don't you ask her to sit next to you?
Is it true?
What?
You promised her?
Yes, he did, sir, I was there.
We were all in the laundry room.
Say something.
It's tasty. All we get is porridge and cocoa.
Ahmed, I'm waiting. Is it true?
Yes. Why? Is that a problem?
A wedding needs wine.
Sir, may l?
You made a poor choice.
He's an actor.
Never trust an actor.
I don't usually keep my word.
But I will now!
I'm marrying her.
You're all witnesses.
Pass me the vodka.
You know our dances?
No, only the polka.
Go on, you play!
Look at this woman!
Such talent!
Show them how you dance!
Come here! Come on!
I've come to take her back.
-ls he a relative?
-No.
His name's Ali.
He helped us out earlier.
Come and eat with us.
Sit down.
Don't!
He never takes his pack off, even when he sleeps.
What's it in? Dollars?
It's a secret. I can't say.
Why are you doing this?
She's sick.
I'm not sick.
I'm perfectly healthy.
Let's go back.
You want to take her back to the nuthouse?
It's not a "nuthouse", it's our home.
That's where we live.
We'll spend our lives here.
Have a drink. We'll talk later.
Come on!
Leave him alone!
They're letters.
They're not letters, they're poems.
Ali is a poet. They're poems.
Ali, don't be angry. Read them your poems instead.
"The storm brings darkness, the wind howls,
"Like a beast, like a child
"lt howls at everyone
"Twisting round tenderly
"Like a wanderer lost on earth..."
Let's go back.
Ahmed!
Leave me alone!
My hat!
Good evening, my sweet fiancee.
Forgive me, please.
For what?
I can't marry you.
He can't survive if I abandon him.
Who can't?
My fiance, Bryan Adams.
-He loves you that much?
-You've no idea!
It's crazy how much he loves me!
But that's not the reason.
It's because I love him.
It's tough on him.
He wouldn't get by without me.
Is he in the army?
No, you're in the army.
He's a singer.
He's Bryan Adams.
-The American star?
-He's Canadian.
He was born in Canada and lives in London.
His father's a diplomat, he loves opera.
Bryan Adams loves opera?
No, not Bryan, his father loves opera.
Perhaps Bryan does too.
Do you know that we're alive because someone somewhere loves us?
They pray for us and give us strength.
Tell me, who's praying for you?
Someone has to be.
Don't worry, someone has to be praying for you too.
That's all.
You're not angry, are you?
I should be asking you for forgiveness.
I never intended to marry you.
I was just fooling around.
I often speak before I think.
When that argument started,
I spoke out of pride.
After, when we danced,
I saw how stupid I am.
I'd make a poor fiance.
But you're a great dancer!
I never thought
I'd carry a gun one day.
I couldn't even shoot straight.
But when my brothers were killed, when the roof fell in on my father,
I went and asked them for a gun.
So now I shoot.
I wonder... when they'll kill me.
You won't get killed.
You're special.
Who do you look like, your father or your mother?
Who do I look like?
Like a bald bastard, that's who!
-Totally fucking bald.
-So what?
Ali's bald too, and so is the doctor.
Lenin was too.
And he was smart.
And his wife loved him.
And aliens, forget it!
Not only are they bald, they're green.
I need another drink.
I've got some vodka.
Fedia stole it from the laundry.
So you're an actor?
That's a bad idea, beautiful.
Time to fix the hangover.
I told you to eat something.
I don't remember a thing.
You danced and then you cried.
After, you fell asleep on my breast.
Wet it with some beer.
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
I've cheated on my beloved.
Stop it!
You can go back to him.
I won't tell him anything.
No, it's too late.
He'll never forgive me.
You and l will be together forever now.
Listen, what's your name?
Janna... Timofeeva.
Janna, don't think that way.
You understand me?
Don't panic!
Everyone pair off!
Move to the boiler room!
Vika, that concerns you too.
Nothing concerns me.
I don't have time to talk to you.
Don't touch me!
What are you doing?
That's hospital property!
Don't forget anyone.
Stick together, in pairs!
Come in here!
In pairs!
The Russians are at the market!
Help me! Teach me to shoot!
Get out of my way!
I want to help.
Okay, give me those sacks.
Vakhid, teach me to shoot.
Try to understand.
I have to be with you.
It's such a joy, fighting for your own freedom.
I don't want to miss the party.
-Get to the basement!
-Show me!
It's such a joy, fighting for your own freedom.
We're heading for the market!
Go back home!
You understand Russian?
Where's my home?
Here!
You're totally crazy!
I can play the accordion!
Look, I can play the accordion!
Faster!
Don't stay there!
Down with
Russian chauvinism!
Let's go!
Freedom!
I love you!
Don't stay there!
Don't leave me!
I'm yours now, Ahmed,
I'm your wife!
Those are not yours!
What are you doing?
Tell him I'm your wife!
Go, you're in the way!
I don't have a wife! Go!
Ahmed, don't kill me!
Ahmed,
I love you!
Don't kill me!
Fire,
I love you.
Don't kill me.
Mud,
I love you.
Don't kill me.
Go now, I'll stay here a while.
Go on.
Lucia!
Zoia!
I can't take anymore!
What are you doing here?
Go down to the basement!
Lucia!
Anybody!
She's been killed in my room!
She has a headache.
Listen to me, she's lying on Lucia's bed!
You didn't eat your apple?
The nurse says that
God forgives.
Will he forgive everyone?
Who?
God.
Which one?
You know, God.
What do you see?
An apple.
Is that all?
Well, yes, what else?
It's an apple.
I see different nations on that apple, people that love each other and destroy each other, fighting for generations, and dying.
They stare up in hope to see my face.
And you want me to eat them?
I can only forgive them.
Just as I forgive you.
I'm aware of your existence.
Go now.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
A new hairstyle.
It's getting in my way.
You didn't leave?
Well, no.
There wasn't enough room in the truck.
Besides, I cut my hand.
Where's your fiance?
I changed my mind.
Shorty, come here!
Janna is back!
Doctor, where have you been?
I went to get some buses, but the Chechens captured them, along with me.
We went to Sali.
We had no idea where you were.
I'm staying with you now.
Will we have our pills again?
Colonel, you're holding all your pills.
Pills again!
-Everyone upstairs!
-Let's go home!
We'll sort the mess out.
How do you feel?
The nurse isn't coming back?
I don't know.
I heard her grandson's been killed.
Nobody hurt you?
No.
We sang every night, we danced and drank beer...
I'm glad.
Good...
Is he still alive?
Who?
Him.
Ahmed. Is he still alive?
Let's go in.
Let them kill him.
I want him to be killed.
Bullet or bomb, straight in the head.
A shell or a missile.
I hope he's crying in pain.
And that he forgets about me.
I hope he suffers a lot.
Let's go.
Anybody here?
Scouts, forward!
Go in!
Where are you dickheads off to?
You have your instructions in black and white.
If you see Chechen corpses, you keep going!
If not, watch out!
Someone's out there!
-What is it?
-There's a guy in there.
What's with him?
-You read the sign?
-Yes, sir.
We're in the nuthouse. Stop!
It could be booby-trapped.
-Do you get it?
-Yes, sir!
I can't.
I can't let anyone through.
Get me your captain.
What's all this shouting?
Let my patients use the canteen.
No way, we haven't checked it yet.
Let me pass, then.
I need to get syringes.
All right, go on!
What is this? Look at him.
He seems half-dead.
It's nothing.
Just an adrenaline attack.
He's in shock.
He'll get over it.
Get the picture?
Look at my boots.
I've never seen shit like this.
As soon as it rains, there's fucking mud everywhere.
If a tank passes, we're stuck.
And there are mines everywhere.
Look at my laces.
It's crazy!
I can't undo them now!
I can't take anymore!
All Chechens should be shot.
Where are my men?
Where is Vaska?
Victor's head was blown off.
Listen,
Serguei was shot by a sniper.
He was such a great guy!
Listen, give me a shot of something strong.
Just don't let my men see.
Hold it.
I don't get it.
What happened to me?
Know what the most important thing in the war is?
It's not victory.
The most important thing is Death.
I've never known fear.
Maybe your mind hasn't felt it, but your flesh has.
Tolstoy said,
"Why is a man happy when he kills another?
"What's there to be happy about?"
Feeling any better?
Not a fucking word to anyone!
Understand?
Faster!
Right and left!
Hey, Miss Musician, have you seen anyone?
-What?
-There is nobody!
Head on up.
They must be upstairs.
Nobody goes out, unless you want to be shot!
Understood?
Is it the war again?
We're looking for bandits!
They're hiding here somewhere.
Understand?
Everybody hit the floor!
-It's the war, all right!
-Get down!
Toss in a smoke bomb!
Surrender, you fuckers!
Wait.
Rekemchuk?
Holy shit, we're shooting at our own side!
Rekemchuk, are you fucking crazy?
Answer me and make it snappy!
They shot Smirnov on the roof.
We were firing at you...
It's just a scratch.
Safonov is hurt.
We'll set him straight.
Get up there, hurry!
Fucking move!
Unit 2, send in the tanks and surround the asylum.
Yes, the one near the bridge!
To avoid further casualties, put down your arms and come out.
To avoid further casualties, put down your arms and come out.
Stay. There are bandits upstairs.
Lucia, I'm going with you!
Go on up!
To avoid further casualties, put down your arms and come out.
No country treats its people like this.
Listen, they're firing on the bandits.
Is the train coming through tonight?
The doctor promised.
Of course. If he promised...
Is this place free?
Look!
Attention!
Don't be afraid of these soldiers.
They're kind.
They caught the bandits on the roof.
One of them got away.
Did you see anyone suspicious?
If you do,
Iet the guard out in the yard know right away.
Understand?
We'll show you one of the bandits.
He's a very bad man.
Is he one of the men who took over the hospital, smashed our windows and stole our drugs?
Bring him in!
Well, who knows this man?
He's hurt.
What?
What did you say?
He's hurt.
And so you haven't seen someone suspicious around?
Right!
Petrov, hold on.
Take the prisoner to HQ!
We'll soon see.
The building's clean, as they say.
Any problems, call HQ.
Who's that?
Who are you?
I'm sick, I need to be treated.
Do you all know him?
He's one of us, he's Ahmed.
Right! He's our Ahmed!
He's in our room.
In some ways, they've made their most ambitious record yet.
And ambition is not synonymous with record sales.
You know?
I mean, this is not...
This is a masterful, dense, artistic statement.
It could bomb.
I need more piano.
Less noise?
Less noise.
Yeah.
I could take less noise.
One, two, three.
# It's my father's voice dreaming #
# Of sailors sailing off in the morning #
# For the air-conditioned rooms at the top of the stairs #
# His jaw's been broken #
# And his bandage is wrapped too tight #
# His fangs have been pulled #
# And I really want to see you tonight #
No. I'm sorry.
# I am an American aquarium drinker #
# I assassin down the avenue #
# I'm hiding out in the big city blinking #
# What was I thinking when I let go of you? #
# Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning #
# Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers #
# This is not a joke, so please stop smiling #
# What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt? #
# I want to crawl through those brown eyes dreaming #
# Take you from the inside #
# Baby, hold on tight #
# Well, you were so right when you said I've been drinking #
# What was I thinking when we said good night? #
# I am trying to break your heart #
# I am trying to break your heart #
# But still I would be lying if I said it wasn't easy #
# I am trying to break your heart #
What are you doing?
"Hello!"
"Hello. "
"Welcome to our movie.
We are going to be seeing lots of film about Wilco today. "
I've got to say we're pretty lucky.
I think Wilco is in a position where they can make the record they want to make.
I mean, there is definitely...
I don't know if I'd call it pressure, but there's definitely a feeling that this is sort of the moment.
"They are very funny guys. "
Give him a cigarette.
Oh, yeah. I got one.
I need a piece of gum.
I think... and, of course, hope... that this record is gonna be a pretty big priority for Warner when it comes out.
And... you don't get that every time you put a record out.
"So, anyway, I was touring...
I was touring on the road with Wilco. "
Oh, here's your gum back.
One, two...
# The cash machine #
# Is blue and green #
# For a hundred in twenties #
# And a small service fee #
# I can spend three dollars #
# And sixty-three cents #
# On Diet Coca-Cola #
# And unlit cigarettes #
# I wonder why we listen to poets #
# When nobody gives a fuck #
# How hot and sorrowful #
# This machine begs for luck #
# All my lies are always wishes #
# I know I would die if I could come back new #
You know, there are two kinds of potential.
There's artistic potential, which I think for them is unlimited, and there is commercial potential, which is really quite mysterious to us because there are so many factors that are out of your control, and we try not to think about it too much and just... try to make a great record, and hope and push the label to make the right decisions and do the right things promotion-wise and so on.
This is an interactive band.
These are four or five people, you know, who make music together, and the music wouldn't sound the way it does unless these five people are together in the room at the same time, making the music.
It's a constant process.
I mean, we make records, and they're, um...
Like, that ends up being a thing that you're making, and you have a million options as to what that thing can be and what shape it can be.
We generally go for a pretty straight, definitive version of what the song sounds like it should be and then deconstruct it a little bit and see if there's some more exciting way to approach it.
# Echoes in my heart #
# And gravel in my palm #
There's no reason at all not to destroy it.
You know?
We made it, so it's ours to destroy, and that's liberating and exciting in a really creative way.
# I need a camera #
# To my eye #
# To my eye #
# Reminding which lies that I've been hiding #
# Which echoes belong #
# I'm counting on #
# Two days in Central Park #
# With gravel in my heart #
# And echoes in my palm #
# Phone my family #
# Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk #
# And no, it's not okay #
# I smashed a camera #
# I want to know why #
# To my eye #
# Reminding which lies that I've been hiding #
# Which echoes belong #
# I'm counting on #
# Two days in Central Park #
# With echoes in my heart #
# And gravel in my palm #
I think this record's more of a leap for the band.
This is probably the closest to pure collaboration
Wilco has ever got.
Personally, I'm really happy
'cause Jeff and I have done a lot of this stuff together.
This is the first time that Jeff and I have made a conscious effort to get together at the loft and write songs.
Not that things don't happen spontaneously, um, with the Wilco recordings, but there is a lot of conferring with each other, a lot of deliberation, a lot of, like Jeff was talking, destroying what we've done, trying it from the back door, turning it upside down.
# I'm counting out #
# The days to see how far #
# I've driven in the dark #
# Echoes in my heart #
# Phone my family #
# Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk #
# No, it's not okay #
# No, it's not okay #
# No, it's not okay #
Uh, okay.
It's the first record where we've really done everything ourselves.
We're engineering it ourselves, and we're doing it in our space.
We're doing two seemingly contradictory things... we're making a record in a very relaxed environment with no outside input, but at the same time, we're accepting a certain kind of pressure that we're putting on ourselves.
It's nice not to have a producer for Wilco because we're all, any one of us, perfectly capable of... directing or shaping a musical moment.
Everything is just kind of set up to just keep making records.
I know it's cool to bitch about your record label, you know?
But, I mean, they're letting us make a record in our loft, and they haven't heard a word of it.
They're giving us $85, 000, and they haven't heard a word of it.
You know, that's trust, right?
They trust us.
You're always playing the...
You're pretty much doing
1, 5, 6, 4 on all the...
A lot of times, when you're playing, if you don't have any, like, sonic landscape behind you, everything turns into a folk song.
That's pretty much what you do, right?
Yeah.
We just wanted it to not sound like a little folk ditty, you know?
So we wanted to have just, like, some kind of sonic weight under all of that and, uh, just something kind of weird and fucked up.
# It's my father's voice dreaming #
# Of sailors sailing off in the morning #
# To fight the war #
That picks it up some.
# For the air-conditioned rooms at the top of the stairs #
# They head to the table #
Tune the "A" string to a "B" flat and it...
# And it makes no difference to me #
And then you put them together and you'll get some really magical moments.
# They cried all over overseas #
# And it's hot in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
And we thought that might be rhythmic enough to play to.
# There's bourbon on the breath of the singer you love #
It's kind of along with some of the more noise tracks, but it's rhythmic, so it's something that they can play along to.
# He takes all his words #
# From the books that you don't read anyway #
It was about 3:00 in the morning.
We were either gonna get something great or lose our fucking minds.
All these things are just blaring in here, you know?
That's when it all kind of exploded.
# They cried all over overseas #
# And it makes no difference to me #
# When it's hot in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
# And it takes all the breath out of me #
# When they cry all over overseas #
# When it's hot in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
# It's hot in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
# I'm not going outside #

Hey.
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.
Now, the Latin voice.
We're going to do something with Jeff Tweedy, who plays rock 'n' roll.
# One, two, three, one, two, three #
# Gonna rock and... #
So, with the community that you are doing now, did you play music, uh... porque...
Do you think that your music, uh, reaches out to children who don't have a fighting chance?
Um...

# Set my sights on one whispery kiss #
I'll sign that.
If you know how to spell
"Simón"... go for it.
S- I-M-O-N-E?
That sounds like right, yeah.
"Real pal"...
Do your record... My...
I have an idea.
Does it come out on... compact disc?
M m-hmm.
# I dreamed about killing you again last night #
# And it felt all right to me #
# Dying on the banks of Embarcadero skies #

Let's just do a lot of good crowd control tonight and, you know, bring up the whole political thing, just fuckin'...
The whole thing about women's rights, lesbians' rights, and stuff like that.
I'm gonna play to it.
I'm gonna play to the crowd.
Cool.
'Cause, you know, the Dow is down about 30%, you know.
And as soon as I looked at that,
I just knew what kind of position you're in and stuff.
I've got to kiss some major ass to, you know, to get it... my portfolio back together.
Totally. I know. I know.
I have...
I hear you, man. Totally.
I totally... I canned my stockbroker two weeks ago.
How's the place out in the Hamptons? Good?
M m, it's a fixer-upper.
I mean, the pool is shit.
Yeah.
Spielberg told me... He's like,
"I went over to Jeff's... "
'Cause he knows your fuckin' music is a big bullshit thing... and he was just like,
"I saw his fucking pool," you know, and he was just, uh... he's funny.
You know, he reminds me a lot of you.
You are stupid.

Wilco record.
They sound nothing like that on the record.
Poetry?
Are you saying that my lyrics are poetry?
I like you.
Here's some more... poetry for you.
I wanted to go out and play some shows acoustically.
It seemed like the good time to do it.
We haven't really toured for a while.
The record's still being made.
And take a little break from the record, go play some music, and see how things go.
# There are rows and rows of houses #

Jeff, do you remember Scott from Reprise?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Hey, great job, man.
Well, thanks. Thanks.
You know my friend Sarah?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, excellent.
# In a sea #
# Black with ink #

- Pushing Wilco all the way.
- All right.
# Try to fold it over #
# If I had a boat #
# I'd probably... #
# Roll over #
Hey, is the new record more like...
Is it gonna be more like "A. M.," or is it gonna be more like...
"Summer Teeth"?
Uh, it's really not that much like either one of those records,
I don't think, so...
Ooh. Really?
# Surely there is somebody #
# Who needs #
It sounded like it was a trip-hop album or something.
There were tape loops and samples and...
There are those things, but it's not like a trip-hop record.
Tricky.
# I am so #
# I am so #
# Out of tune #
# I am so #
# Out of tune #
# With you #
I'm happy with it, and we're almost done with it, so, uh, you just have to wait another month or so.
A month or two months.
And you guys are gonna tour on that straightaway, then?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Well, hopefully it'll come out in July.
It's, um... it's got a lot of the drums and holes... and holes in the songs in it.
That's...
So you're like...
Is Courtney Love in there?
No.
Sorry.
A lot of big, open spaces between what's supposed to be, like... the music part.
I don't know. I'm gone.
# We all return #
# Music is my savior #
# I was maimed by rock 'n ' roll #
# I got my name #
# From rock 'n ' roll #
Uh, it's Jeff.
Cool?
- Yeah, it seems fine.
- Great.
That's exactly the mix you'll have out there.
# How can I convince you it's me I don't like #
# And not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes #
# When I've always been distant #
# And I've always told lies for love? #
# I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say #
# How can I be closer and get further away #
# From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie? #
# I've got reservations #
# About so many things #
# But not about you #
And then maybe...
Something... I don't know.
You know, it's...
Sure.
Yeah.
It's only a single.
It's the first time, where he goes,
# I got a reservation... #
Yeah. Yeah, the first one is the double one.
Okay.
I think he's gonna stay away from...
What's that?
Uh, I guess the next... four or five days.
Yeah. We're mixing.
I'm not at the loft.
I'm at the studio.
Tony's here.
# I... #
All right.
#... got a reservation #
All right.
Well, I'll call you later.
Pajama day?
This is, like, this is the record that needs to take the band to another level.
If that didn't happen, it would be a tragic sort of missed opportunity and that it would damage the band.
I think every record I've ever made, somebody has said,
"This is the big one. "
"You guys are gonna be huge. "
And when I saw the reality of the situation,
I felt a little dumb for believing it.
# Make no difference ever known #
# Make no difference ever known to me #
We do have a new A&R guy, M io, who's really, like, younger and cooler than our last guy.
So who knows?
Maybe he'll come in and say something really cool.
Maybe he'll be great.
# I'm the man who loves you #
# I'm the man who loves you #
I think this sounds great.
Yeah. It's a song.
Do you want to hear the new one again?
Can you guys tell me what it is about the drum sounds on this that's not happening?
You said you can't get a good snare sound?
You can't brighten them up.
I think that's what's kind of cool about it.
They're murky-sounding, you know?
- This is all you can get out of them.
- I think it's great.
If the overall song feels good to you, you're gonna fall in love with the little parts of it that are fucked up.
To sum up what I'm thinking...
- You can't change one piece of the puzzle.
- Right.
I don't think well-defined, bright drums with presence and definition would serve the feel of that song.
You know, it's a $ 150-an-hour argument, but that's okay.
Whatever they lack
I say are actually a virtue in this cut.
If we go with this new one, there is more redoing than...
Jeff thought before he left, for instance.
What is coming up right now is exactly what came up when I first started talking to Jeff about it, which was, "I think this does create a domino effect. "
Did anyone have any problem with this song
- until last night when you tried to E. Q. The snare?
- Yes. Absolutely. Always.
Always since day one.
Maybe we should mix stuff that we know is done.
There is no fucking pressure, man.
This is day two in the studio for this record.
- Three.
- Three. Okay.
There's still no pressure.
I just know if we mix both of these, we're gonna go,
"Neither one's it. "
I just know it.
I think it'd be great if we just mixed and leave all tracking for the loft.
Honestly.
Jeff's on his way down.
Oh, his... Alert the media.
Has he...
Has he been... Was he alerted to the situation?
No. He just called for a status report.
Oh, and you said,
"Status not good. "
We had a little bit of a work stoppage... a grinding... grinding to a halt, like, "Well, hold on.
What exactly... How are we supposed to do this?"
It was like really readjusting to how things are gonna work when we're in a different environment from our luxurious... little dreamworld.
We're spending $ 1, 000 a day to be here.
Anytime we get stumped from here on out, we should just... move on.
That's what we're deciding.
I think we've all kind of decided that.
Like, I don't want to mix them both.
At the same time, I don't want to get too hung up on this.
It's an important decision.
Oops. We happened to make it the day we were here.
Or not make it.
You know, whatever.
Let's move on.
You know, we've spent $ 1, 000 in stupider ways in this band.
Like all that blow in Amsterdam. That was...
Well, I must have missed out on that.
There's more pressure on Jeff, you know, externally and self-imposed, I think.
He is aware that the success or failure... artistically, primarily, of the record reflects mostly on him.
Cut to the real mix to "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
Why couldn't we do that when we're mixing
"Heavy Metal Drummer"?
Well, why not do it now?
Because we got to go off-line, unmute everything to find out what track that thing's on.
Can't you just look and see what track it comes up on?
Yeah.
But I don't know if it's just one track or two or what part of the kit it is.
Okay, how would we do it...
How would we overlap it mixing it separately?
We'd just say the orchestra at the top of
"Heavy Metal Drummer" is there.
It wouldn't have to be a, like, mastering thing?
Well, no, 'cause the orchestra is in "Heavy Metal Drummer"... in the top of "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
But it seems...
That seems backwards to me.
Why not mix it up to the cut point instead of trying to mix the other one from a new starting point?
Why not mix it... mix it to the edit?
Do you know what I mean?
Instead of, like, making a new edit for the... when we mix
"Heavy Metal Drummer. "
All right. I guess...
I- I... to me, it's the exact...
There's...
It's the exact same thing.
You mix one up to here, or you start the other mix here.
M ix, start.
Right there.
All right.
I didn't know that you wanted it to sound exactly like it does here.
I thought you wanted it to be the noise going over whatever was really on
"Heavy Metal Drummer" there.
I don't want the orchestra to go into "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
It cuts right there.
Right. And I...
Okay, okay.
Let me try to explain myself.
Um... what I...
I didn't know that...
This is taking a lot longer than doing one mute.
I know, but can I explain myself, please?
I didn't know until now that you wanted it to start with a little kit...
Big kit.
Well, we can do it both ways.
No, I don't...
I don't give a shit.
You just... I just...
You misunderstood what I was saying.
I- I assumed, apparently wrong, that it was noise until "Heavy Metal Drummer" started.
But now I understand that it's orchestra until a subset of
"Heavy Metal Drummer" starts, then, two measures later,
"Heavy Metal Drummer" really starts, right?
- Sure.
- Okay. I didn't know that.
I thought we were just saying,
"Hey, that would be cool if the noise went right up to
'Heavy Metal Drummer. "'
Does that make sense?
Well, whatever.
I don't know.
I don't know what the problem is.
I don't.
I just want you to understand me, like understand...
Why is that so important?
I don't have to understand you all the time.
It's okay.
Like, we found it, and... and we can do it.
Okay.
It... It seems to me like you're making a-a big deal out of not wanting...
Not wanting to... Okay.
I've just been sitting here trying...
I've been listening to you explain yourself.
And do you understand it?
Sure. I understand it.
Why couldn't you just say,
"I understand what you're saying"?
I did.
Two seconds ago, you said,
"Why is it so important that I understand you?"
Well, because it doesn't seem like you were gonna let me understand you.
You were gonna have to explain it to me again and again and again.

No.
I just throw up all the time when I have migraines.
When I was a kid,
I threw up...
I used to throw up like 30 times in a night and get put in the hospital for dehydration.
# Who will rock the cradle, who will sing the song? #
That feels better.
You're right. It's six of one, half-dozen of the other.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I-I guess
I wasn't explaining myself...
See, now we have to do all our outro mutes on everything else.
Why?
Well, because we have a bunch of other things open.
I mean, it just cuts right there.
No, but up to there.
You know what I mean?
- Oh, right.
- Up to there.
Well, we would have had to do that anyway.
Yeah, some of that we would have, yeah.
But I was... I was... Yeah.
I was just thinking it'd be...
We'd just start
"Heavy Metal Drummer" that way was what I was thinking, you know?
I'm cool. It's...
I'm totally cool, all right?
It's over.
Right now, um,
Reprise Records is in a pretty serious state of flux, which I'm a bit nervous about.
I mean, I'm not worried about the record not coming out.
The record will come out, but you don't know whether we're gonna be getting the... same sort of enthusiasm out of whoever the replacement person is.
It's just a mystery.
What about "M ust be High" or "Casino Queen"?
Nah.
I'm just thinking in terms of rockers, man.
Yeah.
If we got easy rockers, we should probably...
I don't want to do that anymore, man.
You don't want to rock?
No, I don't want to just fall back on a bunch of easy rockers.
No, I'm just thinking with four days to practice and four shows.

I'd go either way.
When this record ended up being finished, it actually felt fresher to me than it had felt for months.
After... We did a bulk of the recording in a, you know, over a year or so, and somewhere towards the end of that year, it got to be kind of nit-picking and going back and retracking songs and knowing exactly what we were going for... less exploratory.
And... And that was starting to get kind of rough by the time we went to CRC to mix.
We got bogged down in certain things like, um, redoing drums or, you know, certain calls that were good that helped us later on.
But for whatever reason, it... it just bogged down.
Doing the record... the final mixes... at Soma and hearing them through Jim O'Rourke's ears, actually hearing it with someone who is coming at it with some fresh perspective and being able to collaborate on the final mix is kind of like...
Well, we're kind of throwing everything out the window, but we're also kind of getting back to what the original thing was.
When it went to Jim with completely fresh ears, he heard them a little differently, and right away, as soon as we heard how he was mixing... like "Trying to Break
Your Heart," the first thing he mixed, then it was like,
"Oh. This really works. "
That's why bands don't mix records.
Definitely it was like a...
It was a final stage of collaboration.
Like mixing the record...
That's what I always felt like mixing should be... like it should be the last stage of, uh, of inspiration.
I think we tried to make it powerful, like with two guitars.
Can you beef up your tone a little, then, or something?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay.
This is so steady now.
Yeah. I thought it was feeling great, man.
God, I thought it felt great.
No, I mean, we can try the two guitars again if it feels too weak.
I just think that we've tried the two...
I think the two-guitars thing is, like...
M ight be obsolete, you know?
Uh, I'm not sure what that means, but I'll try.
No, I just...
It's just that it was...
What's that?
That felt great to me.
That's all.
It just felt fuckin' rockin', you know?
That's all.
# Jesus, don't cry #
# You can rely on me, honey #
# You can combine anything you want #
# I'll be around #
# You were right about the stars #
# Each one is a setting sun #
# Tall buildings shake #
# Voices escape singing sad, sad songs #
# Tuned to chords #
# Strung down your cheeks #
We actually officially delivered the record... or sent them the final mixes of the record.
I must have had 50,
60 definite possibilities for magazine features, let alone television appearances, which were starting...
Offers were coming in.
And I just thought like, "Boy, this is gonna be so great, you know, it's all set. "
I think the press has always loved Wilco, but now we're gonna take it even to another level.
When we delivered the record, though, we didn't hear from them for like two weeks, you know?
So we... we thought that was probably not a good thing.
I knew that I was sitting on something that people were gonna beat down the door to get.
And then the advances didn't get made.
So June is rolling along, and I'm going like,
"Well, we're losing time,
"we're losing... we're losing people to deadlines.
"They're not gonna be able to cover this record if we don't hurry up. "
And then, about the third week in June,
I'd heard, "There's a problem. "
Next thing I heard was that... they asked us to change the record.
I don't know how they... what they wanted us to change.
And Tony told me that... that was their response, and... and I told Tony that we weren't interested in changing the record.
Their A&R representative was M io Vuchovich, and what I had heard...
Like I said,
I never talked to Wilco about the way this chain happened, but what I heard from my side was that M io had some ideas about changes to the record or additional recording or mixing or things like that, and the band had felt like,
"That's the record.
We're finished, " you know?
"We're not really in the mind to make changes, and it's sort of a take it or leave it. "
And I think it went up to M io's boss, David Kahne, the head of A&R for Warner's and Reprise, felt like M io was right and that changes did need to be made, and if the band wasn't interested in making them, then they should probably be on another label.
Next thing I heard was that they wanted to know if we wanted to leave.
Well, I just think we've been jerked around so many times and that this is the ultimate jerking-around.
You know, like this
"We're gonna drop you" shit or whatever it is or
"You can get out of the deal. "
Either way you want to look at it, it's still... majorly being jerked around, and... you know, why should I think that things are gonna change?
Actually, when Tony first told me that this was a possibility...
I have to be completely honest... it hurt my feelings.
It's like a feeling of rejection.
It's got to be more than some sort of promise of, you know,
"We love you and we're going to take care of you. "
Do you know what I mean?
Because we've heard all that before, and I just think that the wound from this episode of making this record, delivering the record, and getting, basically, nothing but headaches in return is pretty deep and gonna be pretty tough to heal, and you're not just dealing... you know,
I'm not the only person you've got to make feel good.
We never got too specific about what exactly, uh, made them hate it.
Okay, but I just want you...
I want you to understand one thing.
This is really important.
Right now I believe that the best thing for the band... for the band... the present and future of the band... is to be away from Reprise Records.
It was at a weird time in the Reprise inner circle because Howie Klein, who had been president of Reprise for a long time... since Reprise was reactivated... he'd also been at Sire when Uncle Tupelo was on Sire and a big fan of the band... had just left the label.
In fact, I think the day that the band turned in the record... the end of June... right around then, he... that was his last day.
A day or two after I retired,
I got a phone call from one of Wilco's many, many, many, many fans at Warner Brothers... and that was the first of many phone calls I got... telling me that Wilco was dropped.
I would guess that if I was an executive at a record company... high-up executive.
I don't mean the people working in the trenches, but I mean the guys with, you know, the gold-plated cellphones, you know?
If I was up there and I listened to "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"
I probably wouldn't get it.
Why don't I get it?
Because it doesn't tell me exactly who it's for, it doesn't tell me exactly what it's about, and it doesn't tell me exactly how much it will sell.
From what I gather, I think that they didn't even think there was a single to work on.
There's pretty stuff in there, there's hard stuff in there, there's mystery in there, there's... there's really sweet... tunes.
And there's, you know, an abrasion in there as well.
But it's all there, and you really have to kind of sit with it.
You have to allow yourself the time to get something out of it.
There's no chance that Wilco would have ever been dropped when I was president of Reprise Records.
We're now in a... a culture... not just a business, but a culture... in which we expect everything to happen
Like that.
You know, you have people outside, standing around talking on cellphones.
You know, the gist of the conversation is,
"I'll be there in five minutes. "
Who gives a fuck?
Just be there in five minutes.
Don't talk about it.
You know, it's... You get...
People are just so impatient, and as a result, you know, we're looking at things in ways like,
"Well, how much time do I have to devote to this?"
And it's really sad because, you know, music, art, literature, poetry, you know, even great technical... technological inventions... they're not meant to be
Done and done with that quickly.
It was, like, kind of just a shock to be, like, slapped in the face with, um... um... this calculated world of... international, multinational... whatever... corporation.

I see a band here that is really ambitious artistically.
It's not a VH1
"Behind the Music" story.
It's not a drugs-groupies- celebrity kind of story at all.
This band's story is the music.
Twenty years from now, they're probably gonna get more of their due than they are now.
I don't think they're a band that fits in with a lot of what music gets played on the radio.
The appreciation for its records is going to increase as time goes on.
In the making of this record,
I felt like I got no support... zero.
Emotional, financial... whatever.
Then, at some point in the process, you start asking yourself, "Why are we... What are they doing?"
We don't need the money.
You know, the band can go out and play gigs and make the money to pay for the records, so...
They're not getting the band on the radio.
Um... you know, it's really... at this point, to me, their value is really, really questionable to us.

Hoarding it, pig.
I'm stealing the band's pizza.
Oh, I got busted!
I'm sorry, dude.
- Is that cool? Is it cool?
- Does anybody have a pen?
I don't have nothing for you to sign!
Tell him to sign your ass.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I can do that.
You'll have to sign my boobs.
Actually... Would I?
I don't know.
I've never...
Someone in our band did that once, actually.
You can sign my ass.
I have nothing else to sign.
- Really?
- Do you wanna?
If you sign her ass, you have to sign my ass.
And if you sign her ass, you have to sign my ass.
You can sign my chest.
That's what Jimmy...
Oh, we saw Jimmy in the, uh...
- Are we on the lighting stage?
- Sound check.
...with Straitjackets in the elevator last night.
Remember the guy who sat in...
- Oh. Oh, my God.
- Jimmy Lester?
- What?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This is a...
I met Bob from
"Sesame Street" yesterday... last night.
- Bob?
- Oh.
Do you know Bob?
Does anybody know who Bob is?
- Yeah.
- I can't remember that.
- How'd you meet him?
- He was in our hotel.
He's doing a kids' show right now as we speak.
Oh, man.
He's like, "Yeah, I got...
Big Bird's coming in tomorrow, and we're... "
There's Jay right now as we speak.
So also, although it's already been blown, but J. P. Asked if we could sort of steer clear of the stage for a little while.
Until...
Until sound check is over?
Until Jay gets, uh, done?
Has Jay been here since like 6:00 in the morning?
Gentlemen, we have about
35 minutes to do all of this.
Yeah, we're going Glenn, we're gonna go... Jay Bennett, the entire keyboard world and Jay Bennett electric rig.
Keep him there.
After Jay, we'll do Johnny real quick,
M r. Tweedy, let Leroy get his world sussed out.
We're only gonna have time to do about two songs.
Check. Hey, hey, hey.
Yeah, the delay's not working.

Let's talk about Jay.
All right. I probably won't have much to say.
- Okay.
- Just warning you.
Okay.
It's my understanding, from what I heard in the grapevine, that that was sort of an amicable separation and that, um, I...
And I don't know that this is true, but the hearsay is sort of that he didn't feel that he had had as much a role in the songwriting as he wanted to have or, uh...
I think that there's some truth to that, and I think there's an effort... there's an effort made for it to be amicable.
Since Jeff's solo tour and Glenn joining the band, uh, some dynamics in the band had altered in... many different ways.
I think Jay's contribution to the band over time and our collaboration was important and was valued in the band.
As for the circumstances surrounding him leaving,
I really think that that's up to Jay to define.
And as far as my, uh, feelings about it,
I couldn't be happier.
Jeff was convinced that he really needed to tell Jay directly and he needed to be the guy to do it.
We sat down, and he said,
"I don't think I can make music with you anymore. "
And I said, "Why?"
And, uh...
I'm not sure I ever got an answer that made any sense.
Jay wore out his welcome in a lot of ways.
It's hard to be working with somebody, uh... that... that needs more than you can... than you can give him.
And, um, you know,
I'm more interested in being... playing music with people that I can share with than give things to.
Jeff was threatened by me.
It's clear.
By the attention
I was beginning to get.
Um...
He wanted the band back.
That's simple.
That's a simple answer.
You know, Jeff went into this big, long analogy about how a circle needs a center, you know?
Well, he was gonna be the center, right?
I wasn't gonna be the center.
It's hard for me to talk about.
Um, I mean, I've known Jay for... 16 years?
17 years?
And... our friendship had, uh... run its course.
There's a lot of power-related issues in Wilco, and people are...
They don't want to lose their gig, man.
And so they don't want to step outside of their little, uh, um... uh... scripted role.
'Cause if they do, this is what happens.
I think we all knew everyone would be happier in the end, and I think Jay would totally agree with that.
It did not come as a total shock to me to be asked to leave Wilco.
It had been in the back of my mind.
In fact, I'd talked to Leroy about this extensively... that, to quote myself, "My days in Wilco are numbered. "
I had thought very, very seriously about leaving the band.
I just happened to be beaten to the punch.
When you're Jay Bennett or whomever and you leave the band, you have to kind of start over.
You're going back to playing for 35 people or 100 people or whatever from sold-out theaters.

They delivered a great record, and I think it's a record company that, for whatever reason, can't handle that type of great record.
And so, fantastic.
Let's go do something else.
I don't know how to make
I don't know how to make something other than the record we made, and I think to entertain any of their half-assed, fearful, frightened bullshit would be to compromise something that is a big part of my soul.
You know?
Like, it's a part of my heart.
And I don't have any interest in doing that anymore.
I think it's a really, really, really strong record.
I think it's a statement.
I think it's the right record for them to make... now in their career.
And I think there are dozens of labels that would be ecstatic to have it and who, if you delivered this record, would call you up and, you know, be excited about it.
That's all.
You know, that's what I'm tired of is, like, no enthusiasm.
Why is Wilco dropped, uh,
24 hours after they deliver a record like
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"?
Um... I mean, we've contemplated that question at great length over the summer, and in the end,
I think Tony and I both just sort of put our hands up and said, "I guess we're glad that it just happened,
"and we won't try to overintellectualize it any further. "
But I really think, looking back on it, it's because of marketing.
And it's because you have an artist like Jeff Tweedy who's put out, uh, you know, four or five records in a row with a record company and they haven't been able to bring sales up to a level where it's really significantly affecting their bottom line.
They, uh, I guess, stop thinking about it from a pure artistic level and just say, "We don't make money on this guy. "
And then he delivers a record which, for whatever reasons, they evaluate as being difficult to raise to the next level of public appeal, so they say, "Well, okay, we're not going to... "
I guess, to use a phrase...
"throw good money after bad.
"We've spent $ 200, 000 recording this record,
"but it's gonna cost us another $300, 000 or whatever
"to launch a marketing campaign for it, and we just don't think we're gonna make our money back. "
So they drop the artist.
Um, this, of course, creates a situation for us where we have a finished record and we want to put it out.
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" has actually turned into a kind of metaphor.
It's now a measure of what record companies... or not even so much record companies, but the corporations that own record companies... are willing to put up with.
Ultimately, what it came down to was they had told Jeff Tweedy,
"We don't like your album.
We don't want to release it. "
In the end, you know, it doesn't really matter who puts the record out.
Eventually, either in the near future or in the way-far, distant future, someone's gonna get it.
As long as music is available, someone will hear it.
The record label must have found it to be something of a public-relations problem, because the press really latched on to the situation as something of a... using Jeff as a poster boy as to what problems were going on in a lot of record companies... and in particular
Warner Brothers... with their artist rosters.
And they didn't want it to blow up any further than it did.
So they, um, after a certain amount of, uh, anxiety-ridden conversations, said, "We think the right thing to do
"is let you take your record somewhere else... wherever you'd like. "
Every time we put out a record, the length of time that a record company is willing to actually even, uh, humor you about, like, working on your record has gotten shorter.
Music is not limited to what happens in a business quarter.
And...
You know... this is a record, okay?
This is something that, probably, someone will buy.
They'll pay, 15, 16... whatever... bucks for it.
And that's cool, but, you know, what's encoded somewhere in the bottom of this thing... this dopey little disc... you know, that's what matters.
This... the artifact, the actual object... is not.
What's encoded in here, if it's any good... you know, you'll hear it.
And you'll either get it or you won't, and just as... as a... as a writer, as a fan, as a guy who just listens to music a lot... you know, if you don't get it... you know, I just think that's kind of too bad.
# There's a magazine called Sunset #
# And a tape machine that won't let #
# Me ever forget this impossible longing for you #
"Yankee Hotel
Foxtrot" has been finished now for about six months.
The band have done a little bit of touring, um... word got out that the band were out of their deal, and we started getting a lot of calls, um, and basically started talking to people.
I think we were dealing with about...
25 or 30 labels initially, and then, as time passed, we have been whittling the list down, and we're now talking to five or so and hope to have that resolved in the next week or two.
I don't have any money.
I don't have very much.
Oh! I only have $6.
You want something to eat,
Sammy?
Yes.
I want something to eat.
What do you want?
Soda.
Soda.
Honey, I don't have enough money.
I know.
I'll go get some money.
Never in my wildest, most optimistic moment did I think that we'd be sitting here in the position we're in right now, which is with a finished record that... is ours to take wherever we want.
You could certainly say that they fucked up by letting the band go and walk away with a record.
It's really an opportunity that maybe comes along once in a career.
The claw machine ripped him off.
It wouldn't play?
No, it... it went by itself.
Tony, smell Sam's butt.
No, thanks.
I need to know if he needs a diaper.
I think he does.
I was surprised at the number of record companies that were willing to pay a large amount of money to be sort of in the Wilco picture.
# Oh, yeah #
Recognize it?
What is it?
- Guess. It's one of your songs.
- It's one of my songs?
"I'm Trying to Break
Your Heart"?
No.
Uh, "I Need a Camera"?
No.
- "Dreamer in my Dreams"?
- No.
No?
- "Casino Queen"?
- Unh-unh.
- "California Stars"?
- No.
Tell me.
It's something with a drum in it.
"Heavy Metal Drummer. "
Yes!
How's that go?
# I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands #
# I used to go see on the landing in the summer #
# She fell in love with the drummer #
# She fell in love with the drummer #
# She fell in love #
# Shiny, shiny pants and bleached-blond hair #
# A double kick drum by the river in the summer #
# She fell in love with the drummer #
# Another, then another #
# She fell in love #
# I miss the innocence
I've known #
# Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned #
# Unlock my body and move myself to dance #
# Into warm liquid, flowing, blowing glass #
# Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears #
The record had started to leak a little bit from labels and so on, and copies were starting to float around.
And initially we tried to slow it down... we knew we couldn't stop it... and then, at some point,
I think we just decided,
"You know what? It's out there.
"Let's embrace it and make it available through our website if people want to hear it. "
A lot of people were really aware of the new songs, to the point where, I think, a lot of people, in the front rows, at least, knew all the words.
# Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned #
# I miss the innocence
I've known #
# Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned #
# Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned #
# Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned #
# Whoo-hoo #
# Whoo-hoo #
# Whoo-hoo, hey #
# Whoo-hoo #
# Whoo-hoo #
# Whoo-hoo, hey #
After months of... discussions and ruminations, we have decided to sign...
The band's gonna sign to Nonesuch records.
We've agreed to all the major terms, so the record will come out on Nonesuch in April.
I do find it ironic and a little humorous that Time Warner is the parent company of both of these labels...
Reprise and Nonesuch.
- Are you Jeff?
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
One way to put the reason for picking Nonesuch is that they were the best combination of sort of the business deal and a creative home.
In hearing the record, you know, in the first 30 seconds,
I felt that there was something going on with this record that I hadn't heard in a Wilco record before and that it, you know, was... it sounded brave to me.
Um, you know, it may have been the same 30 seconds that convinced Reprise that they didn't want to put out the record.
Okay, you ready to start signing things?
M m-hmm.
Yeah, it looks good.
Hold on.
One more.
This is to get paid.
Definitely sign that one.
And I sign here.
You sign there.
And you're back in the fire.
Thanks.
It's a deal.

We're about two months away from the record coming out.
The advances are here.
Jeff is in town doing press.
He goes to Europe next week to do press.
It all begins now.
# Be not so fearful #
# Be not so frail #
# Someone watches you #
# You will not leave the rails #
What are we, almost eight months or nine months since the record was originally planned to come out on another label?
So it's been a long road, but it's the beginning.
# Be not so fearful, be not so pale #
# Be not so sorry for what you've done #
# You must forget them now #
# It's done #
We're... couldn't be more excited about the long-term prospects of being able to work with this band.
# And when you wake up you will find that you can run #
# Be not so sorry for what you've done #
It's a long road to here, but, you know, it's a new chapter now, and, uh, we're, um... couldn't be more optimistic.

That's the coup.
That's like the coup of all time for us.
To basically get, you know, one of the biggest entertainment corporations in the world to release us from a contract essentially scot-free with a record that they had already paid for and then sell it back to them for three times the money.
They just liked the record so much that they paid for it twice.
Hold your breath.
Make a wish.
Count to three.

Think she'll get over thisaway?
Might.
Best bed them down.
Come on, Tig.
There she goes.
Looks like we're in for it.
You see them?
Can't see them.
Can't hear them.
You ever seen one this bad?
Not since Noah and the flood.
Well, you should know, Boss, since you was there.
What did you say?
He said, "You should know since you was there. "
Well, even that wasn't this damn wet.
One thing's certain.
Noah never shoveled as much bull from them he had aboard.
Let's rustle up some grub.
Mose?
Hey!
- That hurt?
- Yeah.
Mose, still got them cards?
Yeah, I got them.
Get them out, and let's have us a game after breakfast.
Button!
Pull them plates under here.
You gonna play them cards, Mose, or stare a hole through them?
Don't rush me.
I'll take four.
Oh, for pity's sakes.
"Take four. "
All right, that's it.
I'm out.
Me too.
A man's trust is a valuable thing, Button.
You don't want to lose it for a handful of cards.
Well, at least it ain't raining.
Get yourself dressed, Button.
Help Mose get things cleaned up.
Then you walk out and look for them horses.
Looks like you could use a little muscle there, Charley.
You just keep on like you are.
You'll get your chance soon enough.
No need to ask for more chores, Mose.
Every man's got to pull his weight.
Yeah, but my weight is half of yours.
You know, it's hard to figure
Charley sometimes.
I ain't even sure if he likes me.
He likes you.
You know, Boss had some pause about hiring me on.
Too big to get around on horses and work them cows.
Afraid I'd eat too much.
It was Charley that talked him into it, and I ain't one to take a man's confidence lightly.
You know I ain't, either.
I know you ain't, but it's best to keep remembering it if you want respect when you're riding with men like Charley and Boss.
Button, pull.
Pull it.
Button!
Button!
Quit playing with that dog and pull the wagon!
Pull it!
- Pull!
- Oh, yeah!
Yeah.
That's it.
Hey, hey!
Look at that!
Old Boss sure can cowboy, can't he?
Yeah.
Broke the mold after him.
Main bunch is working towards water.
We'll go up-country, find the rest, and we'll push them there.
Look at that.
A couple of damn kids.
Anyway, once we get them, we can start driving them back closer to camp.
It'll be a while before we see another town.
Could use supplies, coffee and such.
Mose!
Ow!
Mose!
You'll have to ride back to that town we passed.
When you want me to go?
Tonight.
I'll go.
I can go.
How long you figure, Charley?
Without cows slowing things, maybe one day there, one back.
Sounds about right.
Come on, Boss.
I can do it.
Sure you can, boy.
Just don't know if that town's ready to have you turned loose on it just yet.
English!
Damn! Shit!
Bullshit!
By God, if you're gonna pick your feet like a monkey, you do it downwind.
Swear to God, old Tig takes better care of herself.
Starting to think it was a mistake not getting you on in some town to learn a trade.
I don't like towns.
Never liked them.
Oh, you're just saying that
'cause you heard me say it.
Get yourself a trade and set up in a town.
You'll always have a roof over your head, a bed up off the ground, and food no further away than a café.
Ain't that so, Charley?
That was a big help.
Might as well be talking to this horse.
Put your boot on, Button.
Let's go to work.
Course, if you was to live in a town...
You'd have to clean up some.
Otherwise, no one could stand the stink.
What you do that for?!
Cheating at cards.
Cheating.
I apologized to you for that!
Eh, Boss?
I apologized to him for that.
Evidently he ain't over it yet.
It's getting dark, Boss.
He could have got hurt between that town and the camp.
Probably just taking his time.
Don't suppose he got into a poker game, do you?
Wouldn't gamble your money, Boss.
What if he's lying out there waiting for us to come along?
We'd never find him tonight.
Now, come on down from there.
He's worried.
- You worried?
- Yeah, I'm worried.
Been worried since yesterday.
Should have sent me.
Mose can look out for himself.
Then why ain't he here with us?
Well, you never was wanting to go to towns.
Well, I don't want to go now neither.
But we better find him, wherever he is.
All right.
You and me strike out early.
Button can watch the outfit.
Button, come on down from there and get supper a-working.
Most likely be back before suppertime.
But three sets of eyes, it's better than two.
- You stay with the wagon.
- Come on, Boss.
No one is gonna bother it.
We haven't seen a single person since we set up the camp.
I always feel better if someone's close around.
You been working hard, deserve a little loafing time.
Stay right here.
Stay, Tig.
Wants to go.
She acts like she does, but she don't.
Still got the heart, not the legs.
You keep that rifle close.
Always liked me a sidearm with some heft.
Took this off a man who couldn't pay all he owed for some cows.
Damn fine weapon.
Always noticed you favor something light, don't you?
Set it right down.
Thank you.
Hello!
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Like to feed and water them, curry them down with saddles on.
Okay, that'll be four bits each.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Not planning on staying long?
Long as it takes to find who we're looking for.
Maybe I can help you gents.
I been here since Harmonville was Fort Harmon and we still had soldiers to chase off Indians.
I know everybody in town and for miles beyond.
Big man needing a haircut, about 30.
That's his rig right there.
Oh, yeah.
Know who you're talking about.
Very friendly young fella.
Looks like he's been living out of saddlebags most of his life.
Got his horse in the corral.
Ride with you, does he?
Know where we can find him?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.
He got into it with some cattlemen over at the general store.
- Some cattlemen.
- Yeah.
Busted them up pretty bad, too, before Marshal Poole came up and hit him over the head with his gun barrel.
Yeah, he's lucky he didn't get shot in the back.
You might want to keep that in mind when you're talking to Marshal Poole.
Saddle his horse.
That cover what he owes?
Oh, yeah.
Name's Percy if you should need anything else.
Much obliged.
Hold on.
How long you had him here?
I brought him in here yesterday afternoon.
It wasn't easy getting him into the cell.
Why is that?
Goddamn bear.
Size of it.
Evening.
Name's Boss Spearman.
This here's Charley Waite.
Evening.
Believe you have a friend of ours.
Name's Mose Harrison.
Yeah, I got him here.
He started a fight in the general store.
Mose don't start fights, just finishes them.
I just said he started it.
You said he didn't.
Maybe you're calling me a liar.
You got a charge against him?
I got plenty.
Inciting a fight.
Disturbing the peace.
Creating a public nuisance.
Take your pick.
Hear tell he got hit over the head.
He'll be fine.
Well, I come to get him.
Well, you pay the fines, and you can have him.
How does $50 each offense sound?
Like robbery.
Lot of money.
Oh, yes, a lot of money.
I been waiting for you,
Mr. Spearman.
My name's Denton Baxter.
Be your men Mose tussled with.
That's right.
You know, folks in Fort Harmon country don't take to free grazers or free grazing.
They hate them more than they used to hate the Indians.
I expect by "folks," you mean ranchers like yourself.
I got the biggest spread around.
Bigger than any three or four put together.
Built it up with me own two hands, piece by piece, along with this town.
And there ain't no free-graze cattle gonna take the feed off my cattle on this range.
Free graze is legal.
Times change, Mr. Spearman.
Most folks change with them.
A few holdouts never do.
You know, a few years back, a free-graze outfit came through.
One night, the cattle got stampeded, the wagons caught on fire, and one of those boys was shot off his horse in the middle of it all.
Shot in the back, was he?
Your man's horse and rig are at the livery barn.
You can take him with you when you leave tonight.
And come sunrise, you hitch up your wagon and get your damn free-graze cattle moving and keep them moving till you're out of Fort Harmon country!
Now, you let Mr. Spearman fetch his man so he can be on his way.
Charley.
- Mose.
Mose.
Looks like someone's put the boots to him after he was down.
Does it?
Mose, you gotta get up.
Charley, I'm glad to see you.
I don't much like this town.
Here you go.
Boy, they really lit into him.
You got a doctor in this town?
Yeah.
Doc Barlow.
It's the house up behind the barn by the church.
Look for a picket fence.
He's got a sign out front.
Oh, my.
Bring him right in.
Lay him down in there.
I'll fetch the doctor.
Get his legs, Boss.
Easy, easy.
Good.
I'm Dr. Barlow.
Boss Spearman.
Charley Waite.
Patient there's Mose Harrison.
He works for me.
These wounds are old.
Easier to treat if you bring him in right away.
Your marshal had him, and he don't keep a friendly jail.
This is the man who was in the fight with Dent Baxter's men?
He certainly gave as good as he got.
Broke the arm of one.
Knowing them, they had it coming, I expect.
Let's see what we got here.
- Aah!
- Easy.
- Easy, Mose.
- Easy, Mr. Harrison.
Nobody's trying to hurt you on purpose.
I'd say you got a couple of broken ribs.
Gonna need to get this shirt off.
Sue, I am gonna need some soap, some water, and some alcohol.
I want you to drink this,
Mr. Harrison.
- That's it.
Let's clean up these cuts on his face.
He's got a nice gash in his scalp there.
I'd say to good health, but then I'd probably be out of business.
We'll drink to good health for them that have it coming.
The two of you can wait in the parlor.
Be better he didn't travel.
Well, he'll have to.
How much I owe you, Doctor?
We're even.
I figured I made enough off the damage he did to Baxter's men.
Wish he'd have made you wealthy.
Ma'am.
Doc Barlow's got him a pretty wife.
Notice that, did you?
Well, I ain't dead.
Glad to hear it.
Sweet, too.
Treated us as good as anybody.
That's a real lady.
A woman like that makes a man think about setting down roots, eh?
Doc looks like a real hardworking feller.
Probably working away on making some little ones, too.
Creates quite a picture, now, don't it?
Yeah.
Heard they're worth a thousand words.
Hey, Tig.
Now, where do you suppose he is?
Goddamn kid.
Button's all right, Boss.
Anyone done him harm, they'd have gone through the wagon.
Reckon you're right.
Here he is.
If you're awake, you might want to see this.
- Where you been?!
- I seen it before.
Out with the herd.
I thought I told you to stay with the wagon.
- What happened to Mose?
- Did you hear what I said?!
Yeah, but what happened?
Run into a little trouble in that town.
Looks like more than a little.
Are we moving on?
We always do, don't we, once we've grazed off a place?
Did I do something wrong?
Just leave him be for a while.
Here.
Have some coffee.
Made fresh, for a change.
There was three riders scouting up the herd this morning.
Where?
Maybe half a mile out.
Just sitting there, looking at the cattle.
Same ones?
Four this time.
Country's filling up.
Maybe we should push on.
Do no good, Button.
I seen them like Baxter before.
He means to have this herd or scatter it to the wind.
If he was gonna take the herd, why not just keep you in town?
Marshal already had Mose.
Wants us all in one place.
Far from there when it happens.
Don't make no sense, him telling us to move on and all.
Weren't the only thing he said.
Most time, a man will tell you his bad intentions if you listen, let yourself hear.
A few years back, a free-graze outfit come through.
That weren't no idle story.
Let's find out for certain.
Beautiful country.
A man can get lost out here, forget there's people and things that ain't so simple as this.
How long we been riding together, Charley?
Nigh on 10 years.
Mm-hmm.
You know what they call that, call it a decade.
Long time.
Been a lot of change since then.
What's on your mind, Boss?
Way I figure it, we can leave the cattle and run, or you and me can go in the dark and stop them before they scatter the herd.
You reckon them cows are worth getting killed over?
The cows is one thing.
But one man telling another where he can go in this country's something else.
That rancher sat in that jailhouse, sneering and letting his lawman lay down the law till he figured it was time to show us that he gave the orders around here.
Ooh, sticks in my craw.
Well, we sure as hell owe them for what they done to Mose.
Yeah.
I'll saddle the horses.
You two keep a sharp eye out.
Got the scatter-gun.
We'll be watching for them.
You'll want to douse that fire.
Button, keep to the wagon.
I don't want to see you out in the open.
Okay?
I got some sugar in that town.
It's in the wagon.
I wouldn't want to have him coming down on me like these cowboys.
What the hell's the matter with you, Gus?
You're twitching all damn night.
Damn back's so sore from being flung into that stove.
Feel like I been humped by a 300-pound whore.
Well, Gus, I'd say you got off easy.
Look at my face.
Well, you can bet Butler will square things with that big man for breaking his arm and all.
Did you hear it snap?
I heard it snap.
Lucky for him he shoots with either hand.
One twitch, and you're in hell!
Now, get on your feet, all of you!
Now, throw them guns on the ground.
I ain't a-gonna say it again.
And kick them away.
Which one of you's got a sore back?
Which one?
Him.
- You're Gus?
- Yeah.
Ought not gang up on a man three-to-one.
Ohh!
Wait a minute, mister.
- It wasn't our idea to jump him.
- Shut up, Wylie.
Get up, you son of a bitch.
- What's your name?
- Vince.
Mighty nice tie-down you got.
You're a gunhand, are you?
- You fast?
- No.
Uh-huh.
How many riders does he have?
I said, how many riders?
The rest are on their way to your wagon.
Uhh! Aah!
You want to smile now, go ahead.
Be a while before he's of use.
Charley, throw me them saddlebags.
Put your spook hats on.
The ones in your belt, put them on.
Now get your britches off.
Not taking my britches off for nobody.
You listen out of your good ear now.
Now, get them off!
Pretty scary bunch, eh, Charley?
Get belly-down, flat-out!
Uhh!
Get your peckers in the dirt.
- Hyah! Hah!
Hah!
If I hear so much as a twig break...
I'll come back and kill you all.
Charley.
Charley!
No Tig come to meet us.
Ooh.
The bastards.
They shot the boy, but he's alive.
Is that Mose?
He's dead.
Shot him in the head.
Charley?
Charley?
Charley, get the lantern and the whiskey.
Yeah.
Come on, wake up.
Charley.
They shot him here and cracked him in the head here.
We'll have to dig that bullet out.
You done good, Boss.
Him going in and out like that.
I don't know.
He lost a lot of blood.
A whack on the head can make a man strange for the rest of his days.
Well, you done all you can.
He needs a doctor now.
If Button lives through morning, you take him in the wagon and move on.
You just gonna sit out here waiting with them cows?
That's right.
And I'm gonna kill every son of a bitch that comes to take them.
For one man on open ground, you sure got a lot of killing in mind.
You know I never gone against you, Boss.
Always let you do most of the talking.
But he needs that doctor back in that town, and I aim to take him.
If you want to come, we'll go together.
Otherwise, you do what you have to do, I'll do the same.
You think they'll let you waltz in there and waltz out?
I don't figure into it.
Button deserves every chance we can give him.
All right.
But I aim to kill Baxter and those that done this.
And if that marshal gets in the way, I'm gonna kill him, too.
So you best get your mind right about what's got to be done.
I got no problem with killing, Boss.
Never have.
Looks real nice, Charley.
Yeah, a man ought to have something to show he was here.
Be gone in another big storm.
Don't matter none.
He's got your dog for company.
He'd like it you put old Tig with him.
Yeah, he was more
Mose's dog in the end than he was mine.
Be right to say some words.
You want to speak with the man upstairs, do it.
I'll stand right here and listen, but I ain't talking to that son of a bitch.
And I'll be holding a grudge for him letting this befall a sweet kid like Mose.
Well, he sure as hell wasn't one to complain.
Woke with a smile.
Seemed like he could keep it there all day.
Kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it, whether it was or not.
To tell you the truth, Lord, if there was two gentler souls,
I never seen them.
Seemed like old Tig wouldn't even kill birds in the end.
Well, you got yourself a good man and a good dog, and I'm inclined to agree with Boss about holding a grudge against you for it.
I guess that means "amen. "
God.
Charley, you all right?
I'm fine.
Seems like you was, you know...
I said I'm fine.
Just got some old feelings coming up.
You know, we never asked each other much.
That's always been okay with me.
I figured it was okay with you.
But you said some things the last couple of days.
Things that seemed like they had kind of a history to them.
Hey, Charley?
Don't stand behind me, Boss.
When I was a kid, a bunch of us would go into the woods with our peashooters.
Nothing fancy, just enough to kill a bird or a squirrel, maybe something larger if we was lucky.
Killed my first man in them woods.
Held the paper on our farm, and after my pa died, he'd come around to get payment from my mom in any way he could.
Weren't much older than Button when I shot him in the throat.
Knew there'd be more killing, so
I run off and joined the Army.
War was on.
They was only too happy to have me.
My first skirmish was like hunting with my friends.
We just sat up in some trees, and they came marching at us.
Must have been a hundred of them dead after the smoke cleared.
Went around and shot the rest who weren't.
Those of us with the knack was made into a special squad so we could travel light and on our own into enemy territory.
Orders were pretty simple.
Make trouble wherever we could.
With room like that, it wasn't long before we was killing men that weren't even in uniform.
Seemed like that went on the rest of the war.
After that, I come West.
Lot of call for a man with them skills.
And I put them to work for men just like Baxter.
Every once in a while,
I almost get through a day without thinking about who I am, what I'd done.
He drifted off again.
No better, but no worse, either.
You're a real honest man,
Charley.
Well, I ain't gonna lie about Button.
Not Button I'm talking about.
- Mr. Spearman.
- The doctor in?
No, he's not here.
We got a boy that's hurt bad.
Here, put him in the examining room.
It's not his hearing, ma'am.
He hears real well when he's awake.
Mr. Spearman, I'm checking if there's blood in his ears.
It could mean a fractured skull.
Are you the boy's father?
No, ma'am.
His name's Button, and he works for me.
It appears that's not very healthy.
You know the way to the parlor.
Sit down.
I'll be a while.
Well, I don't think it's a fracture.
Concussion's more likely, but it's bad.
I have to admit, we don't see a lot of people shot.
I cleaned and dressed the wound.
Doesn't look infected.
What about the fever?
He needs to lay still and let his body do its work.
No offense, ma'am, but we come a long way to see that the boy gets looked after proper by Dr. Barlow.
Now, where's he at?
One of Dent Baxter's hands came and fetched him out to the ranch.
Some men there had an accident night before last.
You must tell me what happened,
Mr. Spearman.
Baxter sent his men to stampede the herd, and I figured me and Charley to stop them.
Surprised them where they was hiding, and we had at them.
Them's the one Dr. Barlow's putting back together.
We got back to camp, others had shot Mose in the head, shot Button, left him for dead.
Oh.
Shot our dog.
I'll be getting money.
It's not necessary.
We pay our way, ma'am.
Please, sit, Mr. Waite.
Button.
Is that his real name?
Please, sit.
Yeah, it's the only one we've known.
He's just a boy.
Yeah.
Picked him up in a Texas town a few years back, living off café garbage.
Couldn't speak a word of English.
Thought we was doing him a favor.
What about you?
Hmm?
You know that the marshal works for Baxter.
People saw you ride in.
There's payment to be made by them that done this.
Don't intend to run.
We could wire for the federal marshal.
If he started riding today, he wouldn't make it for a week.
With the storm coming, maybe longer.
We're obliged to deal with the marshal and Baxter ourselves.
What about Button?
Well, he's fighting for his life.
We're gonna do the same.
Whatever's needed for Button, you do it.
If he wakes, he's gonna need to stay here a couple days so we can watch him.
Whatever's best for him.
Can't stay away from my little paradise, gents?!
Believe Satan says the same at the gates of hell, old-timer!
We'd like to put the horses up.
Had a tough trail.
I'd like to set the wagon yonder.
Help yourself!
Hurry up, though!
I seen it like this before!
Big one's coming!
Hyah, hyah, hyah!
Son of a bitch.
Sorry, Charley.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Maybe you should have built it in another spot.
Ah, mercy.
Get the dog!
Get the dog!
Get the dog!
It's a dog there, Charley.
Take this.
There he is.
Back here, Charley!
To your left!
To your left!
Get him!
Get him!
You all right, Charley?
Yeah, considering
I've just been swimming.
I owe you, mister.
That's a sweet pup you got there.
Remind you of anyone, Charley?
Small version.
Too small to be let out in this weather.
Belongs to my daughter.
I tried to grab him, but the water was too fast for me.
If you're going into the café,
I'd be proud to buy you both a cup of coffee.
Coffee would be good about now.
This is like the storm that washed away Gunnison
10, 12 years back.
The water come down from the mountains.
Nowhere to go but straight into town.
- Killed a lot of folks.
- It's okay, Bill.
Town's been here a long time, Mack.
It'll be here a lot longer.
That's right, Papa.
Every once in a while, a good storm washes through and leaves her as clean as a baby's bottom.
Got to look on the bright side, gents.
Marshal.
Meat and spuds, Les, as always.
That should cover our meal.
Worth a man's life to walk across that road tonight.
Thanks for the coffee.
Well, appreciate what you done.
That'll be two bits.
Two bits.
I'll be having words with you two.
And we'll be having more than that with you, Marshal.
No need to make the café messy... with folks.
I've got a warrant sworn out for your arrest for assaulting Baxter's men.
We got a warrant sworn for attempted murder for them that tried to kill the boy who's laying over there at the doc's.
Swore out another one for them that murdered the big fellow you had in your cell.
Only ours ain't writ by no tin star bought and paid for, Marshal.
It's writ by us.
And we aim to enforce it.
Is that so?
We got no quarrel with none of you folks.
Baxter's men bushwhacked our friend and shot him dead.
Shot a 16-year-old boy, too.
And clubbed him so hard...
He might not live.
Tried to take our cattle.
Your marshal here ain't gonna do nothing about it.
You don't like free grazers in this town.
We don't much like being here.
But a man's got a right to protect his property and his life.
And we ain't letting no rancher or his lawman take either.
We got no intention of harming bystanders.
Anyone who helps or comforts these goddamn lawbreaking free grazers is gonna have to deal with me.
Your call, Marshal.
We don't have to settle this here and now.
You ain't going nowhere in this weather.
But I'll be seeing you gents real soon.
You can count on that.
That marshal ain't gonna wait.
That son of a bitch is gonna get some men, come looking for us.
He's gonna need us locked up tight in that jail by the time Baxter hits town,
'cause if we ain't,
Baxter's gonna start to think that maybe Marshal Poole ain't worth what he's paying him.
You got something on your mind, just spit it out.
Well, I say we take him right at the jail.
Lock him up, wait for Baxter to come riding in.
Hell, Charley, why don't we just ride out to Baxter's ranch and go straight at him, too?
Well, I'll fight wherever you want, Boss.
You just make the call.
God damn it.
Now, hold on, Charley.
Hold on.
Well, you asked me.
I told you.
Charley, come on in out of the rain, would you?
Come on.
Come on.
Just getting testy in my old age.
Sounds like it's not such a bad idea.
Just roll it around is all I ask.
All right.
What'd you think of my speech in there?
Liked it.
Maybe I ought to run for mayor.
Well, I believe officeholders got to be living, Boss.
Come to see about the boy.
He's asleep.
But, please, come in.
Are you sure, ma'am?
We're a mite rank.
We don't want to mess your house.
No, no.
No, please, it's all right.
Come on in.
Thank you, ma'am.
There you are.
I can't get my fingers in.
We can't get our big fat fingers in these holes.
- Too many broke knuckles.
Oh, let me get you something bigger.
- No, ma'am, we can make do.
- No, no. It's all right.
It's just nice to be sitting at a table set with fine china.
Those were my mother's.
They were the only things of hers that survived the trip out here.
I don't know why
I bring them out.
I can't hold them, either.
Guess it just makes me feel good.
I say what's on my mind, good or bad.
I admire that.
Try living with it.
See that?
No need for a wife or home.
We're just like a... an old married couple.
So, is it marriage that scares you two
- or putting down roots?
- No. Who'd have him?
All rangy and mangy like a rough old dog.
How about I hold your head underwater for just a little while?
I married once.
Never knowed that, did you, Charley?
Had a wife and child.
Sweet little spread, too.
It was nothing fancy, but we was young.
Loved each other.
Never had a cross word.
They caught the typhus and died.
And after that, home didn't seem a place to spend time.
Believe I've changed my mind on that now that I'm getting on in years.
If Button lives and we survive Baxter,
I swear I aim to see to it there's a home he's sleeping in instead of the cold prairie.
Have yourself a last cup of tea, Charley.
I'd like to see Button again,
Miss Barlow.
Of course.
I know the way.
Whew.
Been riding with him 10 years.
Never said nothing about being married.
Where are you and Mr. Spearman spending the night?
Don't rightly know.
It... depends on circumstances.
You mean Marshal Poole?
We have a spare room.
It's yours if you want it.
Couldn't do that, ma'am.
We'd be putting you in a spot with the marshal and Baxter.
Besides, it's a small town.
Wouldn't look right, particularly with the doc away.
I'll take those.
You know where they go?
I saw.
Thank you.
Been raining like hell ever since we got here.
Water washing right down
Main Street.
Charley saved a pup from being washed away.
Looked a little like old Tig.
Now, if you can, you got to listen and pay attention.
'Cause I got something important to say.
I ain't been looking after you for you to go out this way.
The world ain't a perfect place, Button.
But you got unfinished business here.
So you come back, you hear me, now?
You come back.
Kind of dumb talking to him like that.
No.
No, it's good.
You all right, Mr. Spearman?
Believe I'm as right as a man can be under the circumstances.
Circumstances? That's just what
Mr. Waite called them.
I asked him to reconsider, and I'm asking you.
By "reconsider," you mean tuck tail and run?
I mean save your life and his.
He'll listen to you.
Charley thinks for hisself,
Miss Barlow.
He's a good man, and he knows what has to be done.
I'll be paying you now for whatever else Button needs.
In case it goes bad for Charley and me, maybe you and the doc will see we're taken care of properly.
I'd like to put pen to paper if you have them.
Yes. Of course.
Mr. Waite?
Look at my face.
- Oh! Sorry!
I'm sorry.
It's all right, Charley.
Okay?
It just be us.
It's all right, Charley.
It's all right, Charley.
It's all right.
I'll get it.
Jumpy is all.
She ought not to sneak up like that.
She weren't sneaking.
I scared that woman half to death.
Yeah.
Scared me a little bit, too.
Well, that's how it is, Boss.
Ain't a pretty picture.
Got your wits about you now?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It weren't as bad as it looked.
I'll bet.
Go! Hyah!
Two whiskeys, barkeep.
Barkeep!
Two whiskeys.
You see that sign?
Around these parts, free grazers is the first.
Now, he asked you twice.
Ain't gonna ask again.
Hey, Bill, it's all right.
These are the fellows that saved my dog.
I couldn't serve them if they saved Jesus himself.
Mr. Baxter would have my job.
Baxter the owner?
That's right.
Give me a bottle.
I'll serve them myself.
You know I can't do that.
Now we'll have our drinks.
Believe I'll have me another.
Yes.
Well, looks like the rain's let up a bit.
Well, if it don't, there'll be trout fishing right on Main Street.
I'd like you to meet my boys.
Ray and Cory.
We run a freight outfit when the weather cooperates.
Boss Spearman.
And the marksman here is Charley Waite.
Is all that true, what you said in the café?
Yeah.
There's a kid at the doc's house put on death's doorstep by Baxter.
Doc's wife's caring for him until he comes back after the storm.
Doc's wife?
Yeah.
Miss Barlow.
You mean Sue?
That's right.
Well, she'd make somebody a fine wife.
But she ain't the doc's.
That's his sister.
His sister?
Ain't his wife.
Good evening, Mack.
Ralph.
Ray, Cory.
Whiskey.
This is Ralph Peterson.
He runs the general store.
That's where I was when the dog got free.
You fellers the free grazers,
I expect.
No offense.
Personally, I don't stand with others around here about free grazers.
There was a fight in your store about a week or so back.
Some of Baxter's men jumped our friend.
He was a big feller.
Yeah.
I saw the whole thing.
That big feller drubbed the hell out of them other three.
Broke one's arm.
Be a gunhand named Butler, would it?
That's what they say.
Felt bad about your friend.
Is he all right?
He's dead.
That's too bad.
Seemed like a nice young feller.
It's a shame what this town has come to.
You could do something about it.
What?
We're freighters.
Ralph here's a shopkeeper.
You're men, ain't you?
I didn't raise my boys just to see them killed.
Well, you may not know this, but there's things that gnaw on a man worse than dying.
Hey!
Evening, gents.
Evening.
Better get out of this weather, or your bones are gonna be even stiffer than mine.
Heading into the saloon to do just that.
Come looking for you boys.
I'd have bought you a drink if you was earlier.
Then turn around and do it now.
Marshal's got men waiting to waylay you back at the livery.
Another one's in your wagon.
And then there's another in the shed across from it.
Marshal with them?
No.
He's sitting up there all by his lonesome in that warm, dry jailhouse with his feet up waiting for them to bring you in.
Or kill you.
Well, thanks for the warning.
Like I told you, never been partial to the marshal's ways.
Dent Baxter's either.
You're near the only friend we got in this town.
I'll be buying a drink or two.
You keep it quiet, all right?
Time's come.
How you want to play it?
Well, I work for you, Boss.
I'll play it however you want.
Nobody works for anybody here,
Charley.
Now, the name Butler mean anything to you?
You hear names when you're on the other side of things.
He as fast as they say?
He's a killer.
Know him if you saw him?
He ain't hard to recognize if you know what you're looking for.
Yeah.
Too bad if we get shot up tonight before we get a chance at him and Baxter.
Sure as hell is.
Tell you what,
I'd like to sit someplace dry while the marshal's men sit out in this rain.
Won't be so steady come morning.
Small town.
It's hard to hide even at night in this weather.
What do you want to do?
Yep.
Heard me an idea sounded pretty good.
You did, did you?
Well, all right.
He's alone.
Get your hands up.
You must be plumb crazy.
Shut up.
You're dead men.
Didn't he tell you to shut up?
What's that?
Chloroform.
Stole it from the doc's.
You gonna arrest me for that, Marshal?
Jesus.
Well, looky here.
He's asleep.
No.
Looky here.
Put 'em down.
This way.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
You like it, you son of a buck, you?
- Huh?
A little bit more?
A bit more?
A bit more.
Wasn't no call to leave me setting out like that.
- There wasn't a lot of time.
- I ain't bait, Charley.
I hear you.
Best you remember it.
Well, I guess you ain't gonna let me forget, are you?
Starting to enjoy that part, aren't you?
Sorry if we woke you.
No, no.
You didn't.
- Come to see if...
- Go see for yourself.
Hey.
- Hey, Boss.
- Hey.
You gave us a fright, pard.
Thought we was gonna lose you.
Just taking a little nap, that's all.
It's good to have you back.
We owe you, Miss Barlow, and we thank you.
You best thank God instead.
Yes, ma'am.
We'll... give that a try.
Well, I expect you men are hungry.
Button just ate.
I thought I'd make myself some breakfast.
Two more mouths wouldn't be any bother.
I'm just gonna change.
You.
You should try to sleep.
He will.
Now, you do as she says now.
Yes, Boss.
Okay.
Boss?
Yeah?
Mose?
I'll be along in a minute,
Charley.
Be seeing you, Button.
Aah.
If you don't mind my saying, ma'am, you look...
Tired.
Oh.
It's been a long night.
Why don't you sit?
Let an old cowpoke cook up some breakfast.
No, I couldn't let you.
Sure, you could.
Thank you.
I want to apologize for earlier.
Oh, no, no.
There's no need.
You were startled.
No, it was more than that.
I've been trying to put some bad times behind me.
But sometimes they don't stay put.
Always makes me feel better to let things breathe a little.
Not bury them.
I'm learning that.
Trying, anyway.
Well, that's all any of us can do.
Just glad Button's getting better.
Don't believe I've ever seen
Boss so worried.
Well, the doctor will be on his way home as soon as the storm's passed.
By the doctor, you mean your brother?
It's just we've been thinking that you and the doc was... husband and wife.
Oh.
You did?
Didn't find out till last night.
Thought you was married, Sue.
Why, no.
I'm...
I'm not, Charley.
Well, that's good.
I mean that's good to know.
Otherwise, we'd been thinking wrong.
We wouldn't want to do that.
No.
No, of course not.
Much obliged to you, ma'am.
You're very welcome,
Mr. Spearman.
Thank you, Sue.
Take care of yourself,
Charley.
Are you just gonna go off like that without saying nothing?
Ain't nothing to say.
I seen how you look at that gal and the way she looks at you.
It ain't right to walk away without a word.
What do you want me to tell her, Boss?
We probably ain't gonna make it?
Be a big fat comfort.
I don't know what you should tell her, Charley.
I wish I'd have said more to my wife before she passed.
This may be the last time she sees you in this world, Charley.
Or you her.
So tell her whatever you can.
'Cause she's entitled to more than just your backside walking away.
Charley.
I'm not sure what's worth saying or not.
Well, you don't have to say anything.
Yeah, I do.
Boss is right about that.
He's right about a lot of things.
It's just...
I'm not who you think
I am, Sue.
I've... been places.
I've done things.
Most of them, I'm not proud of.
You know, I always hoped somebody gentle and caring might come along.
Years pass.
A small town and all.
And your hopes begin to fade a little every day until you hardly remember what they were.
I've seen who you are, Charley.
The way you looked after that boy and the respect you give Boss.
It might be little bits.
But they're enough for a woman who looks.
Men are gonna get killed here today, Sue.
And I'm gonna kill them.
You understand that?
Yes.
I want you to have this.
It's always brought me luck.
I... can't take your locket.
It's not your choice when it's a gift.
It's a good likeness of you.
It's my mother when she was young.
She's beautiful.
I want you to know that if I don't ever see you again that I meant everything
I said to you and I appreciate everything you said to me.
Ain't nothing that happened in this old town been a surprise.
Except you.
I'll be seeing you,
Charley Waite.
Happy?
Yeah.
If you are.
Morning, boys.
Brung you breakfast.
Hey, you kids.
Come away from there.
Come on.
You get along.
What do you suppose this looks like?
It don't matter.
Whole town knows there's a fight coming.
They just hope it don't spill over to them.
Well, if I'm gonna get killed,
I got a hankering to soothe my sweet tooth.
Morning.
Morning.
What can I do for you fellers?
Thinking about some candy.
- Candy?
- Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Candy.
Got anything you want.
- Got jawbreakers.
- Yeah.
Gumdrops, candy canes, licorice, caramel, honey crisp.
Jujubes, lollipops, milk chocolate...
Looking for something special.
Now, what's the most expensive you've got?
Well...
Ooh.
I got just the thing.
- This is dark chocolate.
- Yeah.
It comes all the way from Switzerland, Europe.
That's near France, see.
They call it bittersweet.
Melts in your mouth.
- You tried it?
- No.
How do you know it melts in your mouth?
Well, truth is we can't afford it ourselves.
Mm-hmm.
I'll take two.
Don't you want to know how much?
Nope.
Yes, sir.
And three of your finest cigars.
My friend and me got a hankering for Switzerland chocolate and a good smoke.
Now, these come all the way from Havana, Cuba.
Thank you.
- Anything else?
- No. That'll do it.
How much I owe you?
It's... $5.
Charley.
Here you are.
Believe I'll enjoy these later, Boss.
Yep.
You ought to do yourselves a favor and ride on while you still got time.
Tried minding our own business.
This is good.
Worth every penny.
You're gonna get yourselves killed.
Try that, Ralph.
Go on.
Sitting right here in front of you.
Never even tried it.
Shame to go forever without taking a taste of something.
Charley, let's go.
Percy!
Up here!
Brought you a cigar.
All the way from Havana, Cuba.
You don't say?
I've heard about them, but I never had one.
Much obliged to you.
What do you think?
Better than them crappers
I usually smoke.
So, you're gonna make your stand down here?
Yeah.
But out there around our wagon.
Not much choice without getting a lot of innocent folks shot up.
Like to place some guns and ammo where we can get to it on a short run.
Help yourself.
We'll try to stay out of your barn.
Might not be able to.
Best bring in your livestock.
Be wishing you good luck now.
Thank you.
It's a pretty day for making things right.
Well, enjoy it.
Because once it starts, it's gonna be messy like nothing you ever seen.
I ain't survived my years without being in some fights, Charley.
I ain't doubting your grit, Boss.
You got more than any man
I ever known.
It's just that...
I don't mean to be hard.
It's just the other night, them fellows back in them trees we let go.
It was my call, Charley.
I can see now it was probably a mistake.
It's not what I meant.
I mean, maybe it was.
But the fact is it's what I always respected about you.
What I always appreciated.
How you treated other people and how you treated me.
How you never look for no trouble.
That kept me from trouble.
But it's found us here, Boss.
And if we're to have any chance, you'll...
You go on and talk, Charley.
I'll hear you.
I'm almost certain they'll be overly confident in their numbers.
Especially if we're standing right out here in front of them.
It's not like we'll have any advantage.
But if they're out there with us, then they won't have as much as they might have otherwise.
I don't figure all of them to be killers.
Only two or three like Butler will have done much of it.
I'll be looking to him.
The others will be hired men.
Probably saddle tramps.
Maybe ex-Army.
The rest will be cowpunchers.
They won't want to line up in front of us.
It'll happen fast once I start.
So just keep yourself moving forward.
And they'll either move or root.
Maybe even freeze up.
It don't matter which.
You just start right in on them with that scatter-gun.
When you've done both barrels, drop it, pull your pistol, and make a run for that building where we stashed them others.
I'll be trying to do the same if I can.
Right.
Sounds like you got it all worked out.
Yeah.
Except the part where we don't get killed.
Best smoke these while we got the chance.
Yeah.
I'm thinking about getting out of the damn cattle business.
You never said nothing except nag me and Button about getting ourselves out.
Well, maybe my own words struck a chord.
Thought maybe
I'd sell off the cattle and have enough to start up a saloon somewhere.
Man could stay cool in the summer and dry in the winter.
Some dancing girls might be nice, you know?
Have to get me some.
Yeah.
"If I die, please sell my good horse and my good saddle and my guns to buy a tea set for Miss Barlow. "
"Charley Waite. "
"Postscript...
I like this one.
But I don't know. "
"Princess pattern. "
Oh, hell.
What's the matter?
Oh.
Looks like you waited too long.
Kind of like us and free grazing.
Well, good is good.
Melted or not.
Looks like you're plumb chained, to your work, Marshal.
Get up, Poole.
He ain't worth a damn.
Get them all up!
Sobered up!
Ooh.
I got a feeling there's gonna be a new marshal in town.
All right!
It's time to settle these free grazers.
Oh, you leave your horses.
We're walking down to their wagon.
When we get there, you better empty your guns in them.
Or I'll damn well shoot you myself.
Now, you three skirt the buildings.
Get into the alleys on the side.
- Come on.
Hayley!
Come away from there.
Finish these later.
Okay.
I'm not going to my maker without knowing your given name.
Mine ain't Waite.
It's Postelwaite.
Charles Travis Postelwaite.
What's yours?
Sure ain't Boss.
I mean it, Boss.
I'm asking you straight up.
It's Bluebonnet.
Bluebonnet?
Bluebonnet, yeah.
No middle name?
No, just Bluebonnet Spearman.
And don't you tell no one.
I want to hear you swear an oath. Now, go on.
I swear it.
All right.
Okay.
Just in case.
Said eight.
Count five.
You should have run when you had the chance, Spearman.
Not much for running from cowards.
I see the marshal ain't with you.
You won't find it so funny when you're all shot to hell and dying.
- You the one killed our friend?
- That's right.
I shot the boy, too, and I enjoyed it.
Hayley!
Back up!
Where's the back door?
- Back door!
- Right this way.
It's locked.
You hit?
I'm good.
You.
You get out of this house!
You pull that trigger, Baxter, and you can forget about me patching you up.
You get your bag.
You're with me.
Go on.
Get the hell up, Poole!
On your feet, God damn it!
Yeah!
You're... going out there.
We ain't ourselves yet!
I see they hobbled you.
It's been a while since I was in a fight.
I panicked. Fell back.
Like to have broke my foot.
Ornery old fool.
Well, or that damn Cuban cigar got me riled up.
Charley.
You two wait here.
Hold on, there, Charley.
Hold on.
I ain't looking over my shoulder the rest of my days.
Charley.
You said we was gonna kill them all.
I aim to do just that.
I meant kill them.
Not murder them.
Splitting hairs, ain't you, Boss?
Mister, I heard what you said.
I won't come after you.
I promise.
No, I expect you won't.
I ain't gonna let you do it, Charley.
You do this, you ain't no different than Poole or Baxter or that gunhand of his that murdered Mose.
Him killing Mose is how this started.
We come for justice, not vengeance.
Them is two different things.
Not today, they ain't.
Step aside!
Listen to him, son.
You done what you had to here because they give you no choice.
Don't go making this into something bad.
This ain't the way, pard.
Mister, thank you.
Thank you.
Didn't do it for you, boy.
Just make peace with your bad deeds.
Sue!
Get in here!
Oh, my God.
Get out of the way.
Button!
- Put it down.
- Let the lady be!
We got your boy, Spearman!
You better drop them guns and come walking down the street or I shoot him.
You've got ten seconds!
We ain't giving up our guns.
He's gonna kill Button anyway.
One!
The only chance for him or us when we walk up is these guns.
Two!
Three!
Sue!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it right now!
Four!
Sue.
You're a disgrace,
Marshal Poole.
You always have been.
I know it.
That's just the way it is.
Five!
Six!
Have a nice rest, did you, Marshal?
You'll be having a long one yourself in a minute.
Been enough killing for you?
Be enough when you're both dead and buried.
Let the woman and boy go.
They ain't a part of this.
If you want considerations, you drop them guns on the ground.
Let her take him to the doc's.
The doc's in jail, and he ain't leaving unless your guns are in the dirt.
I'll crush any man who stands with them!
When I finish that,
I'll torch your homes and drive your wives and children out into the cold prairie.
So you women, you better take hold of your men.
If you don't, you'll be raising orphans by winter.
Mack Langly!
It doesn't matter whether you run or stay!
You and your boys are already dead!
Mack Langly is our friend!
I didn't come all the way from Ireland to see my land pissed on by free grazers.
Now, I want them guns in the dirt.
Him first.
The gunhand.
Looks like you're losing your army, Marshal.
Get down!
It went through?
Yeah.
Is he hit, Sue?
- Sue, is he hit?
- No! No!
But he's bleeding bad again!
God damn it.
Can you stop it?
I'm trying.
I'm gonna kill you, Baxter!
Well, come on, if you're coming!
Can you cover me?
Might be best to wait him out.
Probably bleed to death.
I ain't waiting.
Button needs that doctor right now.
Well, you know, that door's locked.
Well, it won't be when the scatter-gun hits it.
I'm waiting for you, Spearman!
I'm coming for you, you son of a bitch.
Okay, Charley?
Yeah.
You ready?
Yeah.
I'm dying.
And for what?
More cows?
Killed a good man.
And maybe that boy out there out yonder.
You get no sympathy for your death.
Get!
You're... nothing.
Yeah? Maybe so.
But I'll still be breathing in another minute.
Well, kill me, then.
No.
I ain't wasting a good bullet to ease your pain, you son of a bitch.
Your man's in the saloon.
Ordered everybody out.
Asked to see your sister iffen she's willing.
He'd like to speak with you,
Miss Barlow, iffen you ain't offended by entering a saloon.
Sue.
Doc.
Bring him on up.
Put him in there.
We'll make room.
Baxter got any kin?
Daughter is all he has left.
It'd be right if somebody explained things to her.
There never was any love lost between 'em.
Even so, she's his daughter.
And kin is funny about such things.
Come on.
Come on.
I didn't mean for you to have to... walk into this place in front of those people.
I don't care what anyone out there thinks, Charley.
You don't have to stand up for me.
Well, just the same,
I wanted to tell you that I'll be leaving in a day or two.
I'd like you to stay.
I think others would, too.
I can't say I haven't thought about it.
Truth is, there wouldn't be a corner here that don't have a bad memory for me.
I've been holding my love a long time, Charley.
I know you feel something for me, too.
I do.
But I ain't no more than those who come to kill us.
You seen that yourself.
Maybe you've done some bad things.
Maybe worse than bad.
But what happened here today wasn't one of 'em.
And those killings, they don't give you pause?
I'm not afraid of you, Charley.
It brought me luck.
Just like you said.
It's yours now.
You keep it.
I don't have the answers,
Charley.
But I know that people get confused in this life about what they want and what they've done and what they think they should have because of it.
Everything they think they are or did takes hold so hard that it won't let them see what they can be.
I've got a big idea about us, Charley.
And I'm not gonna wait forever.
But I am gonna wait.
And when you're far away,
I want you to think about that.
And... come back to me.
I'm in love with you, Sue.
Been that way since
I first laid eyes on you.
Just took me a while to see things clear.
I know I'm not the kind of man you expected to walk up your front walk.
If I was your brother,
I wouldn't choose me for you.
Charley...
Do you know how old I am?
Don't care how old you are.
I'm not a girl anymore.
You're the handsomest woman
I ever saw.
I've had my disappointments,
Charley.
Well, I'm not gonna be one of them.
I never thought I'd live as long as I have, Sue.
I guess living the way I have, it never really mattered.
But thinking I was never gonna see you again was maybe...
Was maybe the most awful feeling
I ever had in my life.
I know I can be a good husband to you.
And I know I ain't asked you proper.
But I'm asking you now.
Will you marry me, Sue?
Charley.
Yes.
I'll marry you.
And can I kiss you?
I'm gonna give you a thousand of these before I'm done.
Hey, Charley!
Looks like the doc changed his mind about you.
Something wrong?
No.
Everything's fine.
I forgot to tell you
I'll have word about the saloon by the time you get back.
Sounds good.
You take care, now.
Charley.
Sue.
I'll be along.
Saloon?
Told you I was wanting out of the cattle business.
There's a saloon right back there just had its owner die.
Hoping you'd be my partner.
I cant afford something like that.
Not even half.
Well let the brains of the outfith do the thinking.
Sue!
You are coming back, aren't you?
And i will be waiting for you Charles!
Keep nothing private.
Have to go back know.
I don't want to loose side of the roof tops.
I mean it Sue.
Got to go!
How this gonna work if you don't do what i say.
I told you, I'm gonna give you a thousand of these before I'm done.
I'm gonna make sure you do.
Let's go get our cows!

{44062}{44121}While your theories|are scientifically sound...

You want to be Atticus Finch. Good!
- I like him.
- Why?
- He's honest.
- Yes.
- He stands up for the right thing.
- Yes.
- And he's a good father.
- He is.
- Did it all by himself.
- Did what all by himself?
- Raised his kids.
- He didn't!
Who was the woman that came every day?
- Calpurnia.
- Calpurnia. He remembered.
- What about Boo?
- What?
Boo's the most interesting character in To Kill a Mockingbird.
Excuse me.
I'm a teacher. "Xmas" isn't in the English language.
It's either "Merry Christmas"...
...or "Happy Holidays."
Thank you.
Sure.
Tell me about Livia.
She killed everyone so her son could be king. Like Nixon.
Please, please, please.
- Anita?
- Hey, Mom.
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks. I already ate.
- Are you sure? I made soy cutlets.
- I'm fine.
Wait. You've been kissing.
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.
- I can tell.
- You can't tell.
Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.
What you got under your coat?
- Why can't we listen to our music?
- It's about drugs and promiscuous sex.
Simon and Garfunkel is poetry.
The poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex.
Honey, they're on pot.
First, it was butter.
Then sugar and white flour.
Bacon, eggs, bologna, rock'n'roll, motorcycles.
Then, it was celebrating
Christmas in September...
...when it wouldn't be commercialized.
- What else will you ban?
- You wanna rebel against knowledge.
- I give you the Cliffs Notes on life.
- We're like nobody else I know!
I'm a college professor. Why can't
I teach my own kids? Use me.
Darryl says you use knowledge to keep me down.
He says I'm a "yes" person and you are raising us in a "no" environment.
Clearly, Darryl doesn't hear "no" much.
I can't live here! I hate you!
- William hates you.
- I don't.
You don't even know the truth.
- Don't be a drama queen.
- Feck you!
This is a house of lies!
There it is.
- Your sister used the "F" word.
- I think she said "feck."
- What's the difference?
- The letter "U."
Are you really in our grade?
Hey, guys! Check it out.
William doesn't have any pubes.
- How old are you, man?
- He's not a man.
- He's a baby.
- Bet he doesn't get zits.
Everyone has hair.
What's wrong?
- How old are you, like 2?
- How pathetic!
Where are your pubes?
I had them.
I shaved them off.
He's a funny guy.
See you, pubes.
- Hey, noodle.
- Hi, guys.
Put on your seat belt.
We got our annuals.
- Received your annual.
- Right, received.
I look so much younger than everyone.
Enjoy it while you can.
Mom, it's time.
- Can this wait till we get home?
- Pull over.
Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.
He knows how old he is.
Kids make fun of him because he looks young.
Nobody includes him.
They call him "The Narc."
- They do?
- What's a narc?
- A narcotics officer.
- What's wrong with that?
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.
I'm 12.
She skipped me a grade.
Big deal. I'm a year younger.
They're 13, I'm 12.
Aren't I?
I put you in first grade when you were 5 and didn't tell you.
- So I'm how old?
- This will scar him forever.
Don't be Cleopatra.
We have to be Mom and Dad.
You put too much pressure on him.
When he rebels in some odd way...
...don't blame me.
- How old am I?
You skipped an extra grade.
You're 11.
Eleven?
So you skipped fifth grade.
- They pad the grades too much.
- Eleven?!
You also skipped kindergarten.
I taught it to you when you were 4.
This explains so much.
- You've robbed him of an adolescence.
- Adolescence is a marketing tool.
Honey, I know you were expecting puberty...
...but you'll have to shine it on for a while.
Who needs a crowd?
Who put such a high premium on being typical?
You're unique.
You're two years ahead.
Take those extra years and do what you want.
Go to Europe. Take a look around.
See what you like.
Follow your dream.
You'll still be the youngest lawyer.
Your dad was proud.
He knew you were a predominately accelerated child.
What about me?
You are rebellious and ungrateful of my love.
Somebody's gotta be normal around here.
This song explains why I'm leaving home to become a stewardess.
We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?
I love you.
Man, take good care of her in San Francisco, man.
One day...
...you'll be cool.
Look under your bed.
It'll set you free.
Watch the plant.
You're 18 and I can't stop you.
She'll be back.
Maybe not soon.
Here's a theory
for you to disregard...
... completely.
Music, you know, true music not just rock'n'roll, chooses you.
It lives in your car, or alone, on your headphones...
...with vast, scenic bridges and angelic choirs in your brain.
It's a place apart...
...from the benign lap of America.
Did you know
"The Letter" by The Box Tops...
...was a minute, 58 seconds long?
It means nothing. Nil.
They take two minutes to accomplish...
...what Jethro Tull takes hours to not accomplish.
You see, this is fatuous, pseudo blubber.
You know, which is fine...
...but to foist it off as art...
The Doors? Jim Morrison?
He's a drunk, posing as a poet.
- I like them.
- Give me The Guess Who.
They got the courage to be drunken buffoons, which makes them poetic.
It's an honour to have the great rock critic and editor of Creem...
...back home in San Diego,
Lester Bangs.
Live, "American Woman"?
Have you ever...? The most brilliant piece of gobbledygook ever!
Give me some
"White LightlWhite Heat."
Lggy Pop!
Amen! Put this on.
This isn't on your playlist.
- Isn't it a bit early for that?
- Not for me.
That was Lester Bangs, this is
Alice Wisdom and here is lggy Pop.
So you're the kid sending me those articles from the school newspaper.
I've done stuff for a local underground paper.
- What are you, the star of your school?
- They hate me.
You'll meet again on their journey to the middle.
Your writing is good. Too bad you missed rock'n'roll. It's over.
- Over?
- It's over.
You got here for the death rattle.
Last gasp. Last grope.
- At least I'm here for that.
- What do you use?
Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.
You like Lou Reed?
Early stuff.
Lately, he's trying to be Bowie.
He should just be himself.
But if Bowie's doing Lou...
...and Lou's doing Bowie,
Lou's still doing Lou.
If you like Lou.
- You take drugs?
- No.
Smart kid.
I used to do speed.
And sometimes a little cough syrup.
I'd stay up all night, writing and writing.
I mean, like 25 pages of dribble.
You know, about the Faces, or Coltrane.
Just to fucking write.
All right.
It's been nice to meet you.
Keep sending me your stuff.
I can't spend all day talking to my many fans.
I understand.
- Goodbye.
- Yeah, goodbye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You need a ride?
No, man, I took the bus.
Once you go to L.A., you'll have friends like crazy.
But they'll be fake friends.
They'll try to corrupt you.
You look honest, they'll tell you everything.
But you cannot make friends with the rock stars.
- Is it okay if I...
- lf you're to be a rock journalist...
You don't get much, but you'll get free records from the record company.
There's just fucking nothing about you that is controversial.
God, it'll get ugly.
They'll buy you drinks.
You'll meet girls.
They'll fly you places, offer drugs.
It sounds great, but they aren't friends.
They want snobbish stories about the rock stars' genius.
They will ruin rock and strangle everything we love about it.
They're trying to buy respectability...
...for a forum that's gloriously and righteously dumb.
You're smart enough to know that.
The day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real.
Then it just becomes an industry of cool.
You're coming along at a very dangerous time for rock'n'roll.
I mean, the war is over. They won.
And 99% of what passes for rock these days...
...silence is more compelling.
So I think you should turn around, go back and be a lawyer or something.
I can tell from your face that you won't.
I can give you $35.
- Give me 1000 words on Black Sabbath.
- An assignment?
Yeah, yeah.
You have to make your reputation on being honest...
...and...
...you know, unmerciful.
Honest.
Unmerciful.
If you get into a jam, you can call me. I stay up late.
Look, a generation of Cinderellas, and there's no slipper coming.
You wanted to be Abraham Lincoln.
You wanted to be Atticus Finch.
You want to get high?
I just have to listen.
- That's what Lester said.
- As long as this is just a hobby.
I'll pick you up right here at 11:00 sharp.
If you get lost, use the family whistle.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Don't take drugs!
"Don't take drugs!"
Yes, Mother!
Hi, I'm William Miller.
I'm from Creem magazine to interview Black Sabbath.
Not on the list.
- Sir, I'm a journalist...
- You're not on the list.
Go to the top of the ramp with the girls.
We won't bite!
What happens after I go to...
Who are you with?
Me?
- I'm with myself.
- Who are you with? What band?
I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm a journalist.
I'm not... Not a... You know.
You're not a what?
You're not a what?
I'm not a...
...groupie.
We are not groupies.
This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.
Groupies sleep with rock stars because they're famous.
We're here for the music.
We are "Band Aids."
- She ran a school for Band Aids.
- We don't have intercourse.
We inspire the music.
We're here because of the music.
Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.
It's famous.
It's a long story.
I'm retired now.
Visiting friends.
She changed everything.
She was the one who said,
"No more sex.
No exploiting our bodies and hearts."
- Right.
- Just blow jobs, that's it.
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening.
- This is our journalist friend.
Journalist friend, meet Polexia Aphrodisia...
...Estrella Starr...
...and you are...
- William Miller.
- Here comes Sabbath!
- Ozzy, Tony, it's us!
It's me, Polexia!
I think I saw Sapphire.
"Does anybody remember laughter?"
Sapphire!
Come on!
Passes, girls!
Come and get them!
- Oh, no, not this one.
- Who brought Opie?
He's with us.
- Don't go anywhere, Opie.
- I'll take care of this if I can.
Come on, boys, pick it up!
We're an hour and a half late.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Freddy! Open up!
It's Stillwater! We're on the show!
I'm a journalist for Creem magazine.
Oh, the Enemy. A rock writer.
I'd like to interview you or your band.
Look. I'm sorry, but could you please fuck off?!
We play for the fans, not the critics.
Russell, Jeff...
...Ed, Larry.
I really love your band.
The song "Fever Dog" is a big step forward for you.
And you guys producing it instead of Glyn Johns...
...that was the right thing to do.
And Russell, the guitar sound...
...is incendiary.
Incendiary.
Way to go.
Hey, man! Don't stop there.
- I'm incendiary too, man.
- I didn't mean "fuck off."
- How are you doing?
- He's with us. This way, bro.
- He's not on your list!
- Here's a list of people who belong.
Hey, Red Dog!
We're playing you tomorrow night, man.
- Yeah?
- How you doing, brother?
Good to see you.
The Allman Brothers Band's number one roadie.
- How are the guys?
- Having a ball, man. Having a ball.
We have an Allman Brothers
Band party, man.
Everybody's boogying, getting off. It's like family.
We got these now.
Check that out.
You can taste the colour with your mind.
- You'll be in Maryland?
- Yeah.
All right. Dickey and Gregg send you their love.
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy, brother.
Good, man.
People have a hard time explaining rock, really explain rock'n'roll.
Maybe Pete Townshend, but that's okay.
Rock'n'roll is a lifestyle and a way of thinking...
...and it's not about money and popularity.
Although, some money would be nice.
It's a voice that says,
"Here I am...
...and fuck you if you can't understand me."
And one of these people is gonna save the world.
That means rock'n'roll can save the world...
...all of us together.
And the chicks are great. But what it all comes down to is that "thing."
The indefinable thing when people catch something from your music.
- Wait, what am I talking about?
- The buzz.
The buzz, and the chicks, the whatever...
...is an offshoot of the buzz.
Like you saying you liked
"Fever Dog." That is the fucking buzz!
Found you a pass.
Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.
Oh, Stillwater.
Now you're mysterious.
How old are you?
- Eighteen.
- Me too.
How old are we really?
- Seventeen.
- Me too.
Actually, I'm 16.
Me too.
Isn't it funny?
The truth just sounds different.
I'm 15.
What's your real name?
I'll never tell.
The Enemy!
Russell! Hey.
This is Penny Lane.
Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.
Pleasure.
- Penny Lane, like the song.
- Have we met?
Come here, man.
I wanna tell you something.
It's...
It's not what you put into it.
It's what you leave out.
Listen to Marvin Gaye, a song like "What's Happening Brother?"
There's a single "woo" at the end of the second verse.
- You know that single woo?
- Yeah! I know that woo!
Yeah! That's what you remember.
It's the silly things.
The mistakes. There's only one and it makes the song.
It's what you leave out. That's rock'n'roll, what you leave out.
- You're the enemy. Are you 18?
- Yes.
There you go, still young enough to be honest.
Bring the lights down.
Hey, get the Enemy in here.
- San Diego!
- Ready, baby?
Good evening, San Diego!
Stand right over there.
Would you please welcome...
... from Troy, Michigan:
Stillwater!
You want to come to L.A?
We'll be at the Riot House all week.
- Riot House?
- Yeah.
The Continental Hyatt House.
It's on Sunset Strip.
Oh, yeah, right. Sunset Strip.
Well, tell your friend...
...Miss Penny Lane to call me.
Tell her:
It ain't California without her.
We want her around, like last summer.
Say it just like that.
- Got it.
- I'm under "Harry Houdini."
I get it.
- Come on, let's blow this spot!
- Hey, Enemy.
Come up to L.A., we'll talk some more.
- Bye, Opie.
- See you later, Jeff, Polexia, Dick.
Scully, Ed. See you, Mick, Gregg.
Later, guys.
Bye, Opie.
Bye.
Hey, Red Dog.
I'll see you later, man.
The Wheel.
Frosty.
Ainsworth,
I'll see you around, man.
- Penny!
- Hey, be cool.
Penny, you just missed Russell.
He's at the Riot House and said for you to call.
He's under the name Harry Houdini.
- You know about the Riot House, right?
- I think I've heard of it.
He had a message. He said:
"It's not California without you.
We want you around like last summer."
No! He said, "Tell her it ain't
California without..."
- I get the gist.
- Right.
So how well do you guys know each other?
Call me if you need a rescue.
We live in the same city.
I think I live in a different world.
Speaking of the world...
...l've made a decision.
I'm gonna live in Morocco for one year.
I need a new crowd.
Do you want to come?
Yes.
- You sure?
- Ask me again.
Do you want to come?
Yes, yes.
- You've gotta call me.
- Okay.
It's all happening.
It's all happening.
It's all happening.
You all right?
Yeah, yeah. Great.
And it's not about money
and popularity.
And the chicks are great.
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hey.
- So, your sister's a stewardess now.
- Yeah.
She and Mom are still...
I'd say not speaking, but I don't know that they ever did.
The things we did inside these walls.
That's okay.
I don't wanna know.
- It is my room now.
- We flew the friendly skies.
Okay, okay.
You seem cooler.
I am thinking about going to Morocco.
Tell me if you need a little help with your mom.
- A little may not be enough.
- She still freaks me out.
- She's famous.
- Listen...
Go ahead and do whatever you were doing.
- I'm just gonna hang in here a moment.
- Okay.
I worry about drunk drivers.
Mom, I'm 15.
Right?
Yes. You're 15.
And, here's that money
I owe you.
Your father's favourite joke.
I don't do it as well.
No, I thought that was pretty good.
Small bills on the outside.
Call if they're drunk.
I will call you if anyone, anywhere, gets drunk.
- And don't take drugs.
- Very funny.
See? Sense of humour.
Have fun at the dance.
I'm glad you're making friends.
- Mom, stay.
- Okay.
Love you.
Goodbye.
I always tell the girls,
"Never take it seriously.
Never take it seriously, you never get hurt.
If you never get hurt, you always have fun.
And if you ever get lonely...
...you just go to the record store and visit your friends."
- So you and Russell...
- No!
Russell has a girlfriend, and I can't even say her name.
It's all happening.
I'm about to use you as protection.
These guys are with Alice Cooper.
I'll pretend I don't know them.
Does Alice know you're here?
I'm just showing my very dear friend
William Miller around.
He's a very good friend of Lester Bangs.
I'm responsible for his moral conduct.
Penny Lane!
God's gift to rock'n'roll.
I'm retired.
And don't argue with me!
- Retired? Again?
- It's Reg. Humble Pie's road manager.
Penny, come to Portland with us.
- Have we met?
- Have we met?!
I've made a decision.
I'm going travelling to India.
And then, I'll learn to play the violin.
Then, I'll go to college for one year.
There's nothing they can teach you in college.
Call Alice, under the name
Bob Hope.
- I heard you were with Russell.
- Please, I throw the little ones back!
I lost my head!
Martin Bell's a fucking asshole.
And I'm in love with Jeff.
Polexia!
Harry Houdini, please.
- Houdini. Harry Houdini!
- It was Sable.
- Who's Sable?
- We had this really great night.
And he said it was going to mean something. And I'm in love with Jeff!
I saw them on the 7th floor.
Mr. Jimmy Page, Mr. John Paul Jones,
Mr. Robert Plant.
Mr. Robert Plant signed...
...my T-shirt five minutes ago.
Dude, please don't smear it.
He touched this pen.
- Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
- I picked that up.
He tours with them, but not "with" them.
Yeah, they're on the 12th floor now.
There's no bigger
Zeppelin fan than Vic.
Very dear, very close friend of Lester Bangs.
William Miller.
Hey, you're that comedian.
- Leonard!
- Blow me!
Okay, time to put on the lampshade.
Ladies and gentlemen!
At this time, please extinguish all smoking materials...
...for the captain has turned on the "No Smoking" sign.
Your seats and tray tables should be locked...
...and in their full upright position.
The hell with it.
- Play on.
- Miss Penny Lane.
Thank you. Thank you.
Act One, in which she pretends she doesn't care...
...about him.
Act Two, in which he pretends he doesn't care about her...
...but he goes right for her.
Act Three, in which it all plays out the way she planned it.
She'll eat him alive.
We've gotta stop them.
Stop them?
You were her excuse for coming here.
I need ice.
I'm worried about people using her.
She brings out the good in everybody else, but what do they do for her?
It kills me.
Do you have any pot?
No. Not on me.
- Do you smoke?
- No.
But I grow it.
Yeah.
- Grow it.
- You're funny.
Funny. If you were only taller and
English and rich and a guitar player.
And older.
I'd...
I'd be somebody else.
Yeah, good point.
The Enemy.
I'm always around if you wanna talk more.
- Okay.
- All right.
Bless me, Father, for I may sin tonight.
How does it end?
What?
The story about the girl who dumps the guy who has the ex, ex-wife.
Calls her a hundred, okay...
...five times and doesn't even leave a pass in San Diego.
Wake up.
I'm retired.
I never believed you anyway.
You're too good-looking and talented.
You're retired like Frank Sinatra is retired.
Miss Penny Lane, let me tell you what rock'n'roll will miss.
The day that you truly retire.
The way you turn a hotel room into a home.
The way you pick up strays wherever you go.
The way you know the words to every song.
Every song.
Especially the bad ones.
Mostly the bad ones.
That green coat in the middle of summer.
The real name that you won't reveal.
I could keep going, but my glass is full.
Damn.
Come to Arizona?
Never.
We leave Thursday morning at 9 a.m., and pack light this time. Jesus.
- William Miller?
- This is he.
This is Ben Fong-Torres.
I'm the music editor at Rolling Stone.
We got some copies of your stories from the San Diego Door.
- Is this the same William Miller?
- Yes, it is.
"Voice of God," "Howling Dogs,"
"The Spirit of Rock'n'roll."
- This is good stuff, man.
- Thanks.
Thanks. Thanks.
I think you should be writing for us. Any ideas?
- How about Stillwater?
- Stillwater?
"Hardworking band makes good."
New album out, their third.
Starting to do something. Crazy.
Let's do 3000 words.
We'll join the band on the road.
Don't let the band pay for anything.
We can only pay, let me see,
3000 words...
All right, a grand.
What's your background?
Are you a journalism major?
- Yeah.
- What college?
I need you to do that thing
that fixes the garbage disposal.
I certainly know how my lady gets when you don't snap to it.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
Stillwater?
Beware, beware...
...of Rolling Stone.
They'll change your story...
...they'll rewrite it, you know, turn it into swill.
Besides that, what would be wrong with it?
You got starry eyes, my friend.
Look, do the story.
Who cares, you know?
It'll be good for you.
Remember this: Don't do it...
...to make friends with people who are trying to use you...
...to further the big-business desire...
... to glorify worthless rock stars
like Stillwater.
Don't let those
swill merchants rewrite you.
- "Swill merchants." That's good.
- Yeah, swill merchants.
- What are you listening to?
- Stillwater.
Stillwater?
Fucking kid's doing drugs.
No, no, no, no.
No more than four days and I want a phone number where you are.
Call me twice a day, and do not miss more than one test!
And no drugs.
Oh, this is a big mistake.
Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.
- This is what I was talking about.
- Russell, excuse me.
I was wondering if we could talk when we get to Phoenix.
I want to interview everybody and want to start with...
...just you and me.
- Absolutely.
I've got a thing in a couple days.
- What?
- Oh, it's a thing.
Where you go there to graduate.
School.
I never graduated.
Look what happened.
You're here interviewing me.
No, no, no, no.
Don't put that in Rolling Stone.
In our bios, we all graduated.
Him with honours.
We'll figure out something later, okay?
Just enjoy the ride.
- Keep playing that song.
- All right.
I need to stay in your room.
Russell's in a bad mood.
He's very Bob Dylan in Don't
Look Back. He's trying to write.
Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?
- Sure.
You okay?
Yeah.
Come by in a few minutes for that interview.
Sure.
Is this Mr. Miller?
Yeah.
You have a message from Elaine.
Your mother.
She's a handful.
- I know.
- She freaked me out.
Tell her to stop.
I'm worried, man.
No, you can trust him.
He's a fan.
But it's Rolling Stone.
He looks harmless, but he represents the magazine that trashed "Layla"...
...broke up Cream, ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.
Don't forget the rules. He is the Enemy. He writes what he sees.
If I don't get into a room and take a Valium...
Although it would be cool to be on the cover.
You're gonna get me in trouble.
You're so trying to get me into so much trouble.
Oh, my God.
Simon Kirke from Bad Company is by the pool.
Housekeeping.
Housekeeping.
Go away!
Should I come by later?
Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood!
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- Go away!
You okay?
Yeah.
Go away!
Don't worry. Come to the radio interview tonight. Okay?
Go away!
- Bye.
- You're so rude.
The guitar and songwriting of Russell Hammond.
Vocal stylings of
Jeff "Bebay." Jeff "Babey." "Babay."
- "Bebe."
- Bebe.
"Fever Dog."
The band is Stillwater.
Watch with your mind as they materialize.
Look at the dogs wearing the funny hats juggling just for you...
...freaks and family.
It's Quince...
...with Stillwater, here, live.
It's the Night Circus.
Every minute a baby is born somewhere.
Life. Death.
Hermetically sealed bags of human emotion.
Bags of love.
Bags of kindness.
How'd y'all get together?
Not to get into a me thing, but I did start the band...
...sometime ago and I placed an ad in a magazine called Peaches.
And Russell Hammond answered.
Peaches.
It was a gift from God.
Nobody plays like Russell.
Shit, man. Thank you.
You might wanna hit that delay button, Quincy.
Quince?
Now we're talking, right?
Right?
Why the fuck wait for an interview to say something nice about me?
Why not say it to my fucking face? I tell you every time you nail something.
Everybody pays you compliments.
It's not my fucking job to kiss your fucking ass.
Whose fucking job is it?
Because my ass is dying for a kiss.
I know yours is too.
It's my fucking job.
I think you're all geniuses.
And to all the folks out there:
Smegma.
Nice.
Fellas.
Feces.
The song is "Love Thing."
Your mind is starting to take effect.
They've come to watch you swallow fire.
You scream...
...soundlessly...
...on the Night Circus.
- I thought that went well.
- Yeah. Absolutely.
Pronto.
- May I speak with William?
- He's in the bar with the band.
They're back from the radio station.
Is this Maryann with the pot?
Hello?
No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.
This is Elaine, his mother.
Could you give William a message, please?
Tell him to call home immediately.
And also tell him...
...I know what's going on.
Okay. But I'm just gonna say this, and I'm gonna stand by it:
You should be really proud of him.
Because I know men, and I'll bet you do too.
He respects women,
and he likes women.
And let's just pause
and appreciate a man like that.
You created him out of thin air.
You raised him right.
He's having a great time.
He's doing a good job.
Don't worry, he's still a virgin,
and we're all looking out for him.
You know? That's more than I've ever said to my own parents.
So there you go.
This is a maid speaking,
by the way.
- Can you please hold it down?
- Sorry, ma'am!
Russell. So, what is it you love about music?
Shut that thing off and I'll tell you the truth, all right?
Look. Fuck, I trust you, so I'm just gonna lay this right on you.
Just make us look cool.
I will quote you warmly and accurately.
Well, that's what I'm worried about.
You see, some of us have girlfriends back home, you know?
Some of us have wives.
And some of the people that you meet on the road...
...are really amazing people.
Like you.
Some of the stuff that happens, it's good for...
...a few people to know about, as opposed to, say...
...a million people.
- Understand what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.
They say you're dangerous.
You see everything.
Most people...
...are just waiting to talk.
But you listen.
I grew up with these guys, but I can't play all that I can play.
I'm past them, as musicians, but...
...the more popular we get, the bigger their houses get...
...the more responsibilities, the pressure.
The harder it gets for me to walk out on them.
Then you forget.
Forget what it's like to be a fan.
It doesn't sound like music anymore.
It sounds like...
...lifestyle maintenance, or something.
"Lifestyle maintenance."
That's...
I used to be able to hear...
...the sounds of the world.
To me, it sounded like music.
Now, I don't hear it...
...anymore.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.
What am I doing?
I'm telling secrets to the one guy you don't tell secrets to.
No.
We'll do the interview tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Okay.
So tonight it's...
Well, friends.
- Yeah, right.
- We trust you.
Larry Fellows...
What is your role in Stillwater?
What is the chemical you add to the chemistry?
I'm the bass player.
Right.
And when you take that away...
...what would be missing, stylistically?
What chemical?
A bass?
Okay.
- What's going on?
- Russell got electrocuted!
Okay, everybody be cool!
Come on! Let's get on the bus!
Let's go!
Who's taking care of us?
What about the gear?
I'll deal with it. Get on the bus!
- Come on! Let's go!
- Hey, cowboy.
- You the manager?
- That and more.
You didn't finish your full set, man.
Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup almost killed my guitarist!
You trashed my dressing room and didn't do 25 minutes!
- Don't fuck with my band's safety!
- Fuck you, man!
I'm gonna report you to every promoter in this country!
- I'll call Frank Barcelona!
- You don't know him!
You're all amateurs!
- Come on!
- You want it?
What do you got?
Watch the shirt, fuck!
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Take it easy, man.
I hope you got a lawyer.
Make a live album!
This is your last tour!
What? What? What is that?
What are you, Bruce Lee?
Come on.
Take it easy.
Lock the gates!
Go through the fucking gate.
Lock the gates on these fuckheads!
- Where's my goddamn cart?
- William?
I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.
She says you gotta call home immediately.
And she says to tell you,
"I know what's going on."
So I'll see you guys in Topeka, okay?
Amateurs! You don't know who you're dealing with!
Lock the gates!
- You want to buy a gate?
- Yeah!
You just bought a gate!
Hey. Give that to me, William.
Give me that.
Russell, wake up.
Wake up. It's a girls' running team.
Goddamn!
Let it go, fellas. Let it go, buddy.
When are we getting to Topeka, man?
- Larry, you're a sick individual.
- Wake up, man.
Look at all the tasty-looking high school girls.
We can't stop the bus for every girl in shorts.
Hey, when we go to Morocco...
...we should wear completely different clothes...
...and be completely different people.
What will our names be?
What do you think of Russell?
I like him.
But that's between us.
Because I am a professional.
Give them a break.
There are problems in the band.
- Off the record.
- What problems?
Okay, I got it.
Your name should be Spencer, and mine will be Jane.
- I can't keep up with you.
- Oh, no one can.
You're coming to Cleveland, right?
Cleveland, Ohio?
Oh, no, no, no.
I have to get my interview with Russell before Greenville.
- You've got to help me, okay?
- Here's the thing about Russell.
He's my last project.
I only do this for a very few people, and I think we should do it together.
Because all the guys are good, but he could be great.
What's your real name?
All right, let's go.
Oh, it's okay. I'm easy to forget.
Just leave me behind!
I'm only the fucking lead singer!
So, Ed Vallencourt, what do you love about music?
You said you'd tell me where you were.
- And call twice a day.
- I know!
- You said you wouldn't miss any tests.
- I'll be home for graduation.
- Mom...
- Where are you?
Right now, Topeka, then Greenville, then home.
What about graduation?
We had an agreement.
I'm sorry I didn't call you yesterday.
I miss you and I don't understand why I've driven my kids so far away.
By all rules, don't I
get you for another three years?
Was I not fun?
Yes.
This is Beth from Denver.
She's one of the legendary original Band Aids.
- She's clairvoyant!
- I can't read your mind or anything.
I mean, I pick up things
here and there.
Estrella says hi.
- She says I can stay in your room.
- Sure.
Great! I've got some...
...hydroponic pot!
Wow, your aura is really fantastic!
- It's this beautiful purple colour.
- I love you.
I missed the last thing you said.
- Your aura is purple!
- I love you.
- What?
- Purple! It's purple!
- Mom, what?
- Your aura is purple!
I miss you and I love you!
I love you.
All right.
Fire away. I'm ready.
Do you have to be sad to write a sad song...
...and in love to write a love song?
Is a song better if it really happened to you?
Like "Love Thing." Where did you write that? Who is it about?
When did you get so professional?
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.
It's the record company's mistake, and they will pay.
T-shirts are gone... band happy.
All right?
Can we just skip the vibe and go straight to us laughing about this?
Yeah, okay.
I can see you want to get into it.
How can you tell?
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.
Here.
Let's take a good look at it, all right?
See, you love this T-shirt.
It lets you say everything you want.
Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.
It's a T-shirt.
Do you give a shit about a T-shirt?
I'm just hungry. Let's just go find some barbecue or something.
I'll always tell you the truth.
You doing coke again?
Oh, yeah, all the time.
This is big stuff, man.
From the very beginning, we said I'm the front man...
...and you're the guitarist with mystique.
That's the dynamic we agreed on.
Page, Plant. Mick, Keith.
Blackmore, Gillan.
But somehow it's all turning around.
We have got to control what's happening!
- There's a responsibility here.
- Excuse me.
Didn't we all get into this to avoid responsibility?
I can't say any more with the writer here.
Trust him. Say what you want.
I work as hard, or harder, than anybody on that stage.
You know what I do? I connect.
I get people off!
I look for the one guy who isn't getting off...
...and I make him get off.
Actually, that you can print!
And yet, why do I always end up feeling like I'm a joke to you?
You want to pretend this won't be a very big band? Well, it is!
You call yourself a leader of this band...
...but your direction allowed this T-shirt...
...when you allowed Dick to manage us.
Because he's your friend!
Don't you see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.
Is it my turn now? I think we should, for once, say what we really mean.
- This is the part where you quit!
- Right, I'm so predictable.
Deal with it.
- I'll say what nobody else will say.
- What?!
Your looks have become a problem!
All right, okay, enough! Break it up.
Everyone out of the room for five minutes.
Hey!
Yeah. William. Sorry.
Come on, man. Come on.
Let's go find something real.
From here on out, I'm only interested in what is real.
Real people, real feelings.
That's all I'm interested in from here on out.
You're real.
- Thanks.
- You know...
...you know all about us, and I don't know shit about you.
Tell me, what's your family like?
My dad died of a heart attack.
My sister believes that my mom is so intense...
...that she had to escape our family.
They can't find a way to get through it.
They don't even speak anymore.
Plus, she gave me all her albums, and now she's a stewardess.
It's good to talk about.
Really good.
But here I am telling secrets...
...to the one guy you're not supposed to tell your secrets to.
You're Russell from Stillwater.
Well, yeah, on my better days
I am Russell from Stillwater.
Want to go to my friend Aaron's party?
I know you're a big rock star and all...
...but want to hang with good people and have a good time?
We're just real Topeka people, man.
Oh, my God. Holy shit. Fuck!
I grew up with that lampshade.
I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!
That's William over there.
Hey, William!
You, Aaron, are what it's all about.
You're real.
Your room is real.
Your friends are real.
Real, man, real. You know? Real.
Real, you know?
You're more important than all the silly machinery.
Silly machinery. And you know it!
In 11 years, it's gonna be 1984, man.
Think about that.
Want to see me feed a mouse to my snake?
Yes.
Can I have that bitchin' belt?
Take it.
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, brother.
We should probably get back with the others.
- Oh, it's over.
- Hey...
...there's acid in the beer that's in the red cups.
That's mine.
Topeka. Check it out.
Please, don't give him any more acid. Thank you.
Dick? Dick, I got him.
He's okay.
He is on acid, though.
I can't really tell.
How do you know when it's kicked in?
I am a golden god!
Yes, you are!
I am a golden god!
Hey, Russell.
Don't jump.
And you can tell
Rolling Stone magazine...
...that my last words...
...were:
"I'm on drugs."
I think we should work on those last words!
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.
I got it. I got it. This is better.
Last words:
"I dig music."
"I'm on drugs!"
Just come on down...
...and we'll go back to the hotel.
Okay.
- Jump.
- Jump!
Somebody help him.
I'll save you, Russell!
They've been crying for you
like a bunch of whimpering pussies.
Oh, the band's over.
- This is my family now.
- That's right.
- Right.
- Definitely. It's over.
- He's staying with us.
- Let's just go to Greenville.
We'll listen to some great music, we'll finish the tour...
...and then we'll leave those ungrateful fools behind.
Then we'll come back here, where you'll live.
- That sounds good.
- He can stay in our basement.
- I see what you're doing. I like it.
- Okay, good.
Come on.
I got it, man, I got it.
That felt kind of good, though.
Excuse me, kids.
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.
How do we know you're not a cop? Huh?
The Enemy?
Stop fucking looking at me!
He's your guardian angel.
Don't worry.
He only means half of what he says.
Which half?
Just help me get my interview.
- I have to go home, Dick.
- Okay, okay.
- I have to go home.
- Look.
You saved the tour.
That's good enough for now, okay?
- Come on, big fella, let's go.
- I hurt the flower.
Did you, man? You hurt the flower?
That's nice. Come on, on the bus.
Ladies and gentlemen, the evening is over!
We hope you all enjoyed yourselves, and we'll see you all again in 1974.
Good evening!
I have to go home.
You are home.
In Carl Jung's opinion...
...we all have a sixth sense, intuition.
When you feel you can't live without someone you just met...
...this could be the memory of a past love from the collective unconscious.
Or it could just be hormones.
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.
Rock stars have kidnapped my son.
Most of the fuckups in the world...
... come from the brain,
not the instincts.
My whole thing is to try and...
My thing is to make my brain go away.
But I can't, except on stage.
The brain should be a softening influence on the instincts...
...but the instincts should drive.
Trying to reconcile the brain with ancient urges.
The way the brain interprets these instincts...
...is a heavy trip.
Vallencourt, are you getting on the bus or what?
Come on, let's get on the bus.
U sually I'm brain...
... and Russell is instinct.
But when we're both instinct...
... that's when we make
the most memorable music...
... because it's the best.
Show me any guy who said he didn't want popularity...
...and I'll show you a scared guy.
I've studied the history of music.
Most of the time, the best stuff is the popular stuff.
It's safe to say popularity sucks.
It allows you to forgive yourself if you suck.
And I don't forgive myself.
Do you?
Lester, Rolling Stone is calling me.
I don't have my key interview.
- Days are going by.
- You're flipping.
That's good. All right.
This is how you blow their minds.
He'll ask you...
- This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?
- Yeah.
He'll ask you how the story's going, and this is what you do.
Tell him...
...you know, it's a...
It's a "think piece"...
Think piece.
... about a mid-level band...
...struggling with their own limitations in the, you know...
...harsh face of stardom.
Harsh face.
Yeah, he'll wet himself.
All dressed up and no place to go.
Greenville.
I'm bored.
Who hid the Quaaludes from me?
I have to pee.
Wow! Cute.
Let's deflower the kid.
Whoa. Hold on, hold on.
Wait. I should leave.
I think things are going backwards for me.
- Backwards?
- Well, I don't know. I just...
I thought maybe we could hang out.
You know, do some stuff back home...
...like regular stuff.
Get to know each other a little bit better, and then I'd see you pee.
I mean, you know, that's just the way I usually do it.
You're one of us.
If you come to Cleveland...
...Bowie will be at Swingo's,
America's greatest hotel.
I'll introduce you to him, and his security guard, Dennis.
Don't you have any regular friends?
Famous people are just more interesting.
Well, I would be worried that they were using me.
Boy, if this was the real world...
Not that anybody's using you!
No. Hold on.
I'm not famous. But...
- Your time has come.
- Did Russell call?
- Deflower.
- Opie must die.
- Pants him, girls.
- Stop. We're talking.
Opie must die.
- No. Okay, this isn't funny.
- No, come on!
- Up!
- Please.
Guys, come on. I have to write.
Come on, Penny, join us.
Take a vacation from yourself.
Leave this up to professionals.
Don't worry, William.
I've seen the future, and this
all works out reasonably well.
Reasonably?
Hello?
Hello. This is Ben Fong-Torres calling from Rolling Stone.
Hi, Ben Fong-Torres from Rolling Stone.
Hello, hello.
Hello, Ben.
William Miller, this is your editor
at Rolling Stone. How's the story?
I'm getting good stuff out here.
Yeah, it sounds like it.
Man, I need some...
Now, listen. Get it together, man.
We're professionals.
I don't need to tell you this.
You're not there to party.
We already have Hunter Thompson.
You're out there
to interview and to report.
Now, this isn't Creem.
This is Rolling Stone.
This story is due in four days.
How is it shaping up?
It's a think-piece about a mid-level band...
...struggling with their limitations in the harsh face of stardom.
That's great.
I like what we're saying. Let me try and get you 1000 more words.
Now, it's in consideration
for the cover...
... but don't tell the band.
The cover.
Crazy.
Crazy.
Some coffee.
Me too.
Greenville is so boring.
You know, any other city in the world, and you'd still be a virgin.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What?
I've never written anything more than a few pages in my whole life.
- Don't worry, baby, you will.
- I gotta find Russell.
- I gotta find Russell.
- Oh, will you take the laundry?
Take the laundry?
What am I to you? Huh? Tell me.
Tell me right now.
What am I to you?
Excuse me, sir, will you sign for this?
Good morning.
Please go the fuck away!
We'll do the interview in Cleveland.
No, I can't go to Cleveland.
Come on, man, we'll have more time there.
Don't be tense.
Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.
- I can't go to Cleveland.
Can we help it if we like having you around?
Come to Cleveland.
I don't want to go to Cleveland, okay?
I want to go home.
I like it when you yell.
I'm not gonna let you miss out on the rock mecca of the Midwest.
You're with us.
- Rock'n'roll.
- Rock'n'roll.
I know, I know.
"It's all happening."
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi.
- It's Stillwater!
- Oh, my God!
Hi, welcome to Swingo's.
You must be Stillwater.
"Memory of a Free Festival," that's vintage Bowie.
Ziggy Stardust is mass media.
It's hamburgers for the apocalypse.
It's Bowie!
Jeff and Russell are the band's figureheads...
...but the true Stillwater fan...
...knows that the purity, the core of
Stillwater, comes from Ed Vallencourt.
Hi, Mom. I'm gonna fly back Monday morning.
No, I'll only miss one test.
I'll make graduation.
Tell her you're a slave
to the groove.
Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.
I play guitar in Stillwater.
How does it feel to be the mother of the best rock journalist we've met?
Hello?
You got a great kid here.
Don't worry.
We're taking good care of him.
You should come to the show...
...and join the circus.
- Listen, mister.
Your charm doesn't work on me.
I'm onto you.
Oh, of course you like him.
Well, yeah.
He worships you people. That's fine as long as he helps make you rich.
- Rich? I don't think so. We sit...
- Listen to me.
He's a smart, goodhearted
15-year-old kid...
... with infinite potential.
You're not talking
to some apron-wearing mom.
I know about your decadence.
I shouldn't have let him go.
He's not ready for your world of compromise and diminished brain cells.
Am I clear?
- Yes, ma'am.
- lf you break his spirit...
... harm him in any way...
...keep him from his chosen profession, which is law, something I value...
... you'll meet this voice in person...
...and it will not be pretty.
Do we understand each other?
- Yes, ma'am.
- I didn't ask for this role...
...but I'll play it.
Now go do your best.
"Be bold, and mighty forces will come to your aid."
Goethe said that.
It's not too late for you to become a person of substance.
Please get my son home safely.
You know, I'm glad we spoke.
- All right, boys.
- All right.
Your mom kind of freaked me out.
She means well.
From Troy, Michigan...
... would you please
welcome to Cleveland...
...Stillwater!
When you play a great show like tonight...
I need everyone's attention, please.
Girls, I need five minutes with the band alone.
Right. Well, it seems the rumours are true.
The record company's sent a big-time manager here...
...to try and talk you into replacing me.
It's Dennis Hope.
You've all heard of him.
He has all the big bands, and he wants five minutes with you.
Well, I think we've gotta do this.
- Send him in.
- Bring him in.
- We'll send him out on a rail!
- All right.
We'll do the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from there.
We got a manager who's been with us all along.
Respectfully. We all have our roots.
Bands should hold on to their roots.
Those roots need to be augmented.
I'll tell you the truth.
I may enrage some...
...and enthral others.
I don't give a fuck.
Your manager here needs a manager.
Example: If you hadn't run out in Phoenix...
...we could have sued over Russell's hand.
But you left, negating the contract, forfeiting the deposit.
You travelled a long way to pay that promoter to electrocute you.
Your damages have put you in the hole.
You owe the record company more than you got.
But there's money to be made.
I brought a plane.
More shows to make up the difference.
- Respectfully.
- We travel by bus.
Doris is the soul of this band.
That bus has been our home since we were the Jeff Bebe band.
I'd travel on a pogo stick to make more money.
You could play more dates.
It's not about money. It's about the music and turning people on.
Clearly. Respectfully.
But on the distasteful subject of money...
...just know that you're all making it, right now...
...and it's all out there.
I'm just talking about bringing it back here.
Why pay for something we can do?
You know how not to get charged for the ice below Chicago Stadium?
You know how to do a headlining tour?
Do you know Claire Rothman in L.A?
Know Bobby Cowan, Danny Marcus...
...Lisa Robinson?
Know Frank Barcelona?
This is Cleveland!
Where's Kid Leo? Where is he?
You know how to get a record not pressed, but played?
I didn't invent the rainy day, man.
I just own the best umbrella.
You may believe this will last forever. It does not.
Your biggest fan right now...
Your biggest fan...
...is gonna go to college, buy clothes, spend that money elsewhere.
And you know what? They'll tape your record from a friend.
You gotta take what you can, when you can, while you can...
...and you gotta do it now.
That's what the big boys do.
If you think Mick Jagger'll still be there...
...trying to be a rock star at age 50, you're sadly mistaken.
Well, thank you, Dennis.
- We'll think about what you said.
- Oh, no...
...l'll think about it.
I'm not auditioning.
I came here to decide if I want to represent you.
So I'll stand outside and think about whether I wanna stay.
It was a good show.
I miss him already.
You're coming along at a very
dangerous time for rock'n'roll.
The war is over. They won.
They will ruin rock'n'roll...
... and strangle everything
we love about it.
- Put them up.
- I don't know what that was.
Donkey dick, man!
A donkey dick is funny everywhere.
Is Russell here?
Hey, the Enemy! Come on in, son.
Welcome to the road manager poker party.
This game's been going on for two years. Come on, find a spot.
- Mick's with The Who.
- How you doing?
Raymond's with the Eagles.
Reg is with Humble Pie.
- I think you know Red Dog.
- Hey, brother!
We developed this system of poker over time...
...to play in any condition, which helps.
We let Russell in because he brought hash.
- The press is here.
- Don't mention me, or The Eagles.
- I'm done.
- I'm out.
- I'm in.
- All right.
Side proposition to the winner:
For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...
...l'll throw in three ladies...
...including Miss Penny Lane and the famous Band Aids...
...who have to leave the tour before New York.
- Okay with you?
- Russ is getting soft.
- Is that okay?
- Okay.
It's a deal.
Show them.
Three lovely ladies in the custody of Humble Pie.
- Be good to them, Reg.
- We owe you $50 and a case of Heineken.
All right.
- Joint?
- Know how I know this is good stuff?
- How?
- It's from Crosby.
- Is that the Crosby weed?
- It's from Crosby.
- Oh, I'm in.
- I'm in.
Give me a light. I want fire.
Look, nobody's feelings are getting hurt here.
She knows Leslie's coming to New York tomorrow. Everyone understands.
It's the circus.
Everyone's trying not to go home.
Nobody's saying goodbye.
Quit looking at me like that.
I'm making a wish.
So...
Penny, our friend
Has gained another year
But long ago she threw it in gear
She rocked the south
The east, the west
Could we get off this tour
As Black Sabbath's special guests
She says she's retired
But we've heard that before
She chose us
In Penny Lane we trust
She is a fan of this band
Much more so than us
Thank you, baby.
Who wants the "P" in Penny?
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Sorry the plane isn't bigger.
I'll take a piece.
Who didn't get cake?
Any extra plates?
Anybody?
You think you can fool me.
I can read you.
I know what you're thinking.
- What's that?
- You're worried about me and Russell.
Yeah, I gotta work on that.
You're so sweet.
God, if there was more of you in him.
Don't tell me this stuff.
I want to like him.
Did you miss a test or something?
- You have no idea.
- I know I'm not on the plane.
I won't go with another band.
I could go with the crew, but that'd be pathetic...
...and the girls are all going with Humble Pie.
So if you could find out from Russell...
Forget it, I'll fly myself.
I have lots of partial tickets.
I know his ex-wife- current-girlfriend thing will be...
That's not a good idea.
What are you saying?
Did Russell say something?
- I don't know anything.
- I know he wants me there.
Wake up!
Don't go to New York.
- Why are you yelling?
- I thought we were going to Morocco.
There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.
There's not even a Penny Lane.
I don't even know your real name.
If I met a man in the real world who looked at me the way you...
When and where does this "real world" occur?
I mean, I am really confused here.
All these rules...
...and all these sayings and nicknames.
Honey, you're too sweet for rock'n'roll.
Sweet?
Where do you get off?
Where do you get "sweet"?
I am dark and mysterious and pissed off!
And I could be very dangerous to all of you.
I am not sweet.
And you should know that about me.
I am the Enemy!
You should be happy for me.
You don't know what he says to me in private.
Maybe it is love, as much as it can be for somebody...
Who sold you to Humble Pie for 50 bucks and a case of beer?
I was there.
I was there!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
What kind of beer?
Welcome to New York!
You can be nervous.
You should be. Just be yourself and leave a pint of blood on the stage.
Hey, William.
We showed you America.
We did everything but get you laid.
No. Yeah?
I'm from the Church of Lenny.
We bow to his will.
He is the king of kings.
- Can I get an autograph?
- Made out to who?
- She's here.
- To Lenny.
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.
Leslie!
Room's fully stocked.
Air conditioning's on.
- You look stunning.
- Thanks. See you later.
All right, bags in five!
Cars leave for the party at 6.
Oh, God.
There are lighter souvenirs, you know.
I kept thinking I was gonna go home the next day.
So did I, 15 years ago.
That's the wrong bag, you idiot!
William?
Vic!
It's all happening.
They're here.
Zeppelin are here. They are here.
They're at the Plaza.
Sapphire and Miss Penny Lane are there too.
They're all staying under the name
"Emily Rugburn."
- Wait. Penny Lane is here?
- Emily Rugburn.
William Miller?
Sir, you have an urgent call.
Hello?
This is Jann Wenner, publisher of Rolling Stone.
Congratulations, it's a cover.
Leibovitz will shoot them in L.A...
...but we need you in San Francisco...
... tomorrow. You can finish
the story here. Talk to Ben.
You can tell the band. Alison, our fact-checker, needs you...
... to transmit whatever you have
of the story tonight.
There's a mojo at the Daily News you can use.
A mojo?
A mojo. It's a modern machine that transmits pages over the telephone.
It only takes 18 minutes a page.
As soon as people leave,
I'll fit you in.
- Excuse me. Got an I. D?
- No.
Hey, man, he's cool.
- Dennis, how's it going?
- Great.
Well, enjoy.
Opie.
I'm going to England with Deep Purple in an hour.
Don't forget me, okay?
It's all happening.
I must vamoosh.
Hey, the Enemy.
We got a table back there.
They're all looking for you.
Guys.
Guys!
You're gonna be on the cover of Rolling Stone.
Are you serious?
The cover of Rolling Stone.
And we made it together.
And they don't just put somebody...
...with one little hit on the cover of Rolling Stone...
...fucking magazine, man!
Damn it, I'm gonna enjoy this.
When I first bought the magazine...
...The Beatles were on the cover.
The Beatles.
Four of them, four of us.
Thank you!
Who is that girl?
She's creeping me out.
She's not with any of you, is she?
Yeah, she's with me.
So, who's gonna shoot it?
I want Annie Leibovitz.
I love Annie's stuff.
She does great stuff.
I am no good at goodbyes.
And you...
...are the last...
...of my old-time friends.
Polexia...
Polexia went to England with Deep Purple.
Can you believe that?
Even Sapphire went someplace else.
All she left was her Quaaludes.
Oh, wonderful.
Where's Beth?
Where's my friends?
Where are all my friends?
Front desk?
Could you please send a doctor?
Room 537.
Penny, get up!
I'm up.
My wife's had an accident with some Quaaludes.
- So tired.
- You gotta get up, Penny.
Penny, get up. Get up.
You know that.
You know that I'm retired.
I've always been.
I'm retired, and I'm tired.
- Jane Abbott.
- Miss Jane Abbott.
Miss Judy Stanton.
- Raymond Sanchez.
- Mr. Raymond Sanchez.
Seats and tray tables.
Seat back and tables locked.
And our pending graduate...
...William Miller, not present.
Why doesn't he love me?
And to the class of 1973...
... we say, don't forget to remember
yourselves as you are today:
Full of hope, and the dream that everything is possible.
And remember this,
20 years from now...
...when we all own home computers...
...and we all travel in electrical cars...
...that move swiftly, high above our city...
...that the key to the future, is keeping today alive...
...forever!
Forever! Forever!
Penny, no! Wake up!
Well...
...now that I have your attention...
...I know you've heard this before, and I've never said this to anybody.
Nobody who didn't legally have to say it back to me.
But...
Oh, God, why am I so nervous?
You'll never remember this.
I love you.
And I'm about to boldly go where...
...many men have gone before.
Who do we got here?
- What's her name?
- Emily.
Okay, sweetheart, sit up, sit up, sit up.
- Good girl. What'd you take?
- I'll get her legs.
- What did you take?
- Okay.
- What did you take?
- I don't know.
Yes, you do.
Tell us what you took.
Emily, we have to pump your stomach, okay?
- Emily, wake up.
- Got the tubes. Here we go. Water.
All right, you'll have to swallow this tube.
All right? Open, open, open.
- Come on.
- Don't fight us, we're trying to help.
- Relax.
- Come on, swallow. Swallow.
I know. I know.
Swallow this now.
No, don't bite on it.
Swallow. Emily, come on, swallow.
- Just relax. Got it.
- Very good.
There we go.
All done. All done.
Feed some liquid into your stomach.
You never did half
of what you said.
It was in the middle of
"Midnight Rambler."
Keith Richards saw me...
...and came to the front of the stage. He pulled me out...
...and he took me backstage...
...and gave me a Coke, ice...
...and a lemon.
And I never went home.
I've done twice the things
I said I did.
What about your mom?
She always said, "Marry up.
Marry someone grand."
And that's why she named me "Lady."
She named you "Lady"?
Lady Goodman.
Lady Goodman.
That's great.
Now you know all my secrets.
You've got me.
See you back in the real world.
Thank you...
...William Miller.
Hey, Lady!
Welcome to Eastern Airlines
nonstop...
... to San Diego.
In preparation
for our departure today...
... we'd like to ask, please, that
you extinguish all flammable items...
... and return all seats
and tray tables to their full...
- that your seat belts
are securely fastened.
And do make note
of the emergency exits.
Why didn't you come to the party?
Bob Dylan came.
He was at our table for an hour or so, right?
- Yeah.
- Just rapping.
Bob Dylan at our fucking table. I was looking for you to introduce you.
What happened to you last night?
It's a long story.
Hi, this is Craig, your pilot.
We've caught the edge of
an electrical storm.
Oh, my God.
- Electrical storm?
- Buckle up tight.
- Rock and roll.
- We shouldn't be here.
- My God!
- Whoa, baby!
Doris, we miss you!
All right, listen.
We're gonna try and land in Tupelo.
- We found a field to land in.
- A field?
I can't breathe, man.
It'll be a rough set-down, but we should be fine.
Just hang in there, and we'll get you out of this.
Everyone says it's so glamorous out here.
He just said we're gonna die.
Oh, my God!
If something should happen...
Maybe I never said this enough.
I love all of you.
I once hit a man in Dearborn,
Michigan. A hit-and-run.
I hit him and just kept on going.
I don't know if he's alive or dead...
...but I'm sorry.
Not a day goes by
I don't see his face.
Oh, my God!
Look, I love you all too.
You're like family to me!
Especially since Marna left me.
I want you to know, if I took an extra dollar here and there...
...it's because I knew I'd earned it.
- I slept with Marna, Dick.
- I did too.
I waited until you broke up with her, but me too.
I also slept with Leslie, when you were fighting.
- You slept with Jeff?
- Yeah, but it didn't count.
It was the summer we were free of all rules.
- And you say you love me!
- I don't love you, man. I never did.
None of us love you.
- You act above us. You always have.
- Finally, the truth.
You just held it over us, like you might leave.
Like we're lucky to be with you.
And we had to live with it, man.
I had to live with you...
...and now I might die with you, and it's not fucking fair!
Please, enough!
I'm still in love with you, Leslie.
I don't want to hear any more.
Shut up, Jeffrey!
- It's all happening.
- What the fuck!
- Whatever happens, you're dead!
- Don't be self-righteous.
Not now, man.
You were sleeping with Penny, that fucking groupie...
...last summer up until yesterday.
Tell Leslie that!
- Shut up!
- I quit!
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I quit!
"That groupie"?!
She was a Band Aid.
All she did was love your band.
And you all used her.
All of you.
You used her and threw her away!
She almost died last night while you were with Bob Dylan.
You're always talking about the fans, the fans, the fans.
She was your biggest fan, and you threw her away!
And if you can't see that, that's your biggest problem.
And I love her! I love her!
Fuck it!
I'm... I'm gay!
Thank God, we're alive!
We're alive! We're gonna make it!
Write what you want.
Leave your package on the desk.
I'm not a messenger,
I'm one of your writers...
...William H. Miller.
He's just a kid.
Go right on in.
You're William Miller?
- Yep.
- Oh, baby.
Did anything happen?
After $600 in room-service bills?
Did you tape Hammond?
Where were you?
What did you want to write?
This reads like their version.
You obviously saw more than you wrote about.
- Something must've happened.
- Push up Flippo's Who cover.
Good. It'll take me three days to do this.
It's all handwritten...
...on little bits of paper.
- It's a puff piece.
- They call women "chicks."
- I have a problem with that.
- You want them to like you.
Ben, you told me to send what I had!
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.
Oh, man.
You made friends with them.
See, friendship is the booze they feed you...
...to get you drunk and feel like you belong.
Well, it was fun.
Because they make you feel cool.
- Hey, I met you. You are not cool.
- I know.
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.
Because we are uncool.
While women will always be a problem for guys like us...
...most of the great art in the world is about that very problem.
Good-looking people, they got no spine.
Their art never lasts.
They get the girls, but we're smarter.
- Yeah, I can really see that now.
- Because great art is about...
...guilt and longing...
...and love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love.
Hey, let's face it,
you got a big head start.
I'm glad you were home.
I'm always home. I'm uncool.
- Me too.
- You're doing great, you know?
The only true currency in this bankrupt world...
...is what you share with someone else when you're uncool.
Listen, my advice to you...
... I know you think
these guys are your friends...
...if you want to be a true friend to them, be honest...
...and unmerciful.
"I'm flying over Tupelo, Mississippi, with America's hottest band...
...and we're all about to die."
- Dark, lively.
- Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.
- Did this all really happen?
- I'll check the quotes.
I just got off the phone with Rolling Stone.
- Me too. What's he using?
- He's using it all.
This according to the fact checker.
- So what.
- "So what"?
We come off like amateurs.
Some average band trying to come to grips with success.
Jealous and fighting and breaking up.
We're buffoons!
"Rock'n'roll can save the world"?
"The chicks are great"?
I sound like a dick.
- You are a dick.
- I never said that.
Maybe we don't see ourselves the way we really are.
Is it that hard to make us look cool?
He has you on acid, screaming,
"I'm a golden god."
They used him to fuck us. They'll probably just put you on the cover.
Wait. I never said,
"I'm a golden god."
Or did I?
We never took him seriously.
Now it's serious.
I liked him as a person.
He was never a person.
He was a journalist!
You had the right idea all along.
- How about the flight?
- It's all there.
It's unspecific who says what.
No names are noted in the embarrassing sequences.
It's just obvious who's who and we're fucked!
I told him he could write what he wanted.
They haven't talked to Russell.
Deny it to the fact checker.
One call. Then they can't print it.
- Is that true?
- This is war, my friend.
If you'd met me earlier, he'd have never been here.
He'll live.
Let's identify the goals here:
T-shirts, foreign markets, your contract, merchandising...
...happiness...
...realizing your dreams, money, cool...
...meeting the Beatles.
Let's put all of it in the pot.
It all depends on mystique.
Not giving too much away.
I'm going to L.A.
Call if you need me.
Before I go, let me give you a lesson in mystique.
You can only have one.
Which one do you want?
Which one are you gonna choose?
As long as you can't see what's in this hand...
...you'll always want it more.
It's phenomenal, to be honest with you.
Sophisticated, intelligent.
We only cut out a couple of graphs.
Jeff Bebe's mom sent over a shoebox full of childhood photos.
- She did?
- It's gonna look fantastic.
The band just denied 90 percent of the story. It's a fabrication.
You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.
Did you talk to Russell Hammond?
He's the one who denied it.
- Now wait a second.
- Denied it.
We're going with The Who.
Manuscript's in my office.
He's just some fan.
What do you expect?
Ben! Wait!
You guys, this is my brother.
- Nice to finally meet you.
- You have a good day.
You guys, I'll deadhead back later.
I think I'm needed.
See you.
You look awful.
But it's great.
You're living your life.
You're free of Mom.
Hey, I'll take off work.
Let's have an adventure together.
You and me, finally.
Anywhere you want to go.
Anywhere in the world.
This isn't my idea of a good time.
- Just get me to my bed.
- I'll deal with her.
I forgive you.
I didn't apologize.
Hey, Sapphire.
Hey, boy.
- I hate goodbyes.
- Me too.
All right, so I didn't like you much.
Do we have to like each other?
I sort of thought so.
I think it would've worked against us, I really do.
You know what they say: All the great partnerships hated each other.
We didn't hate each other that much, did we?
No, maybe not.
I could work on it, though.
I just can't picture you with Leslie.
I'm the you they get, when they can't get you.
- Sorry.
- Forget it. It's cool.
- I'll see you later on.
- All right. See you.
Is Penny okay?
The Quaaludes incident?
Well, it wasn't pretty.
She could've died.
I always told her not to let too many guys fall in love with her.
Guess I was wrong.
One of them saved her life.
William?
What do you care? I mean, we all know what you did to him.
I mean, everybody knows.
Even Penny Lane.
Something tells me,
20 years from now...
...we'll remember her.
And not much else.
Can you believe these girls?
None of them use birth control, and they eat all the steak.
I mean, they don't even know what it is to be a fan.
You know, to truly love some silly little piece of music...
...or some band so much...
...that it hurts.
Hello, Penny?
It's Russell. Don't hang up.
I can't really talk now.
I'm in a roomful of people.
Actually, I'm alone.
I won't call again, I promise.
But I need to see you face to face...
... because I'm never
as good as when you're there...
... and I can see myself
the way you look at me.
And I'm sorry. If we could
just get together and talk...
Let's say all the things we never said.
Give me your address.
I'm coming to you...
...this time.
Got a pen?
Hello, Penny.
Hello, Penny.
I'm Russell Hammond.
So this is the famous Russell Hammond.
Come in.
- Is she home?
- Who? Anita?
- Where am I?
- Hello?
Hi.
You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.
Oh, man...
My son is very important to me too.
And I do think you owe him an apology.
- I appreciate you showing up.
- No, no, I agree.
There's hope for you yet, Russell.
Well...
Hi.
So this is...
...where the Enemy sleeps.
You know, I think we both wanted to be with her.
And she wanted us to be together.
You should give her a call.
You both live in the same city.
- You really think I should?
- Yeah.
That girl really cares about you.
Man, I never even knew her real name.
Oh, I called your magazine...
...and told them the truth.
I don't know what they'll do, but I said every word you wrote was true.
We are gonna do this one more time.
So, Russell...
...what do you love about music?
To begin with...
...everything.
- Tickets!
- How much?
Morocco.
Seat by the window, please.
Thank you.

Ok then, you're late again.
One more time, and you're gone.
Dad's gonna be pissed off, mate.
Yeah, righto.
Got a minute?
When we're outside.
You got any teaching jobs going at the moment?
I told you when you quit, no second chances. That was two years ago.
I can't keep workin' here, waitin' to fall into one of those bloody machines.
Be at my place tomorrow.
3:00. Sharp.
What for? You'll see.
And bring both your shoes.
What are you doin' tomorrow?
I don't know. Stuff. Why?
I was gonna drop by Walter's.
I don't know. Want to come?
What?
Give you a ride.
Whoop-de-fuckin'-do.
I wonder how those girls have matured.
Thanks, right.
I thought I said 3:00. Yeah, uh, sorry, the, uh... the traffic was a shocker.
Well, put your shoes on and get warmed up.
All right, everyone to the bar.
What am I doing here?
Just go with it.
Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
I never thought I'd see you guys... You still here?
Walter's the only one who'll give him a job. You guys. Good to see ya.
Place is exactly the same, huh?
No, mate, some things have improved.
Come on. Lift those legs.
Make it snappy. Snappy!
Keep your taps clean.
Bloody prick.
All right, give me a nice clean finish.
Five, six, seven, eight.
You want to improvise, you do it in your own time.
Bit rusty, aren't you, mate?
Yeah. All right, take five, everybody.
Didn't think you guys would turn up for this.
Turn up for what exactly?
Last week, Walter got a call from a guy he tapped with before his accident.
Anyway, this guy's done a lot of big shows, you see... Spit it out, Gus.
He's auditioning people for a new tap show in Sydney.
You beauty. What a waste of time.
Then again, maybe not.
- Yeah, that's the hairdressing chick.
- Are we next?
- She just opened a salon on Darby Street.
- Sweet.
- She moved up from Wagga not that long ago.
- Hey, glamour.
Listen up, everybody.
Gather round.
I'd like to introduce you to Gerard Ball.
Gerard's Anthony Ford's choreographer.
This is a great opportunity for you all.
Please, give him your best.
Keep it simple and no improvising.
I got it covered.
You haven't got it covered.
This guy's a professional.
Easy, tiger. Okay,
I want everybody to do this.
And keep it going. Keep it going.
Who are they? The Okden brothers.
Steer clear.
Arms straight.
Okay. Stop there.
Everyone I point to, step forward.
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.
- There you go.
- The rest, you can go. Thanks for coming.
Okay, I want you to do this.
Okay. Five, six, seven and...
Stop. Stop. Stop!
Stop! Whoo!
Why would I hire you if you can't follow a simple direction?
Because I'm bloody good.
Thanks for coming.
In fact, thank you all for coming.
I've seen enough.
Fifteen years of tap class for a... oh, 12-second audition.
You owe me a schooner for this.
Yep. Whatever.
Before you leave, clean up the studio and put the CDs away.
G'day, I'm Mitch. And you're... Hi.
I prefer redheads anyway.
Well, I thought you were great.
- I'm Linda.
- Sean.
That spin you did, I'd love to be able to do that.
Well, well. If it isn't
Prancer the Tap Dancer.
Nice slippers.
What do you want, Huey?
Well, we miss having you around.
Don't we, fellas?
Yeah, mate. We miss ya. Yeah. We need your expertise. We want you to come back.
So you can keep ripping us off?
Oh, geez, mate.
Oh, geez, that hurt.
Come here.
No, come here. Come here. It's all right.
Come here.
You wanna work for me, stay out of my fuckin' business, all right?
Yep. Got it?
Mm-hmm. Good.
But I don't work for you no more, you ass-wipe.
Ah.
Hey!
Oi! Don't you fuckin' dare!
Then fuck off!
See you later, pretty boy. Yeah?
See you later, dickhead.
Next time.
- What was that about?
- You all right?
Yeah. Yeah.
Good, thanks. So, does this happen after every audition?
Can I have a word?
Hey, help me out with him, yeah?
Shut the front door.
Sean's got it.
Hey, ugly. Yeah, good game?
Yeah, good.
You should've seen this.
Yeah? They'll run the replay in a minute.
Beautiful.
Dad, guess what. Get out of the way of the television.
Dad, guess what. Sean's got a job in Sydney tap dancing.
What? 800 a week.
- We can finally get some peace, eh?
- I thought you gave it up.
Yeah, old Hopalong Walter had an audition today. Oh, did he?
You're not goin'.
Dad, this is a real break.
Yeah, what happens when it finishes?
You're back up here on the dole.
Come on, Dad. Shut up, Mitchell.
It's his life. Shut up.
- Eight blokes have been retrenched this month.
- Exactly.
There's no security at the steelworks anymore.
More reason to hang on to what you've got.
When are you gonna get it into your head that anything would be better than what I do now?
And when are you gonna get it through your thick skull that you're not goin'?
Yeah, try and stop me.
You've never even seen me tap.
And don't smoke that shit out the front, boxhead. Yeah.
Sorry I swore.
This is great. You piss him off, and then you piss off.
I wonder who he's gonna take it out on, eh?
Thank you very much.
Get off! Get off. You'll scratch the Duco.
Oh, Christ.
Here, a present.
You should come with me.
I'm not interested, mate.
I reckon I could get you in.
No.
Come on. It'll be a blast.
We've always wanted to get out of this place. No, you have.
Well, what are you gonna do? What?
Work in the steelworks forever and ever. Amen.
No, I've got my own plans.
Oh, yeah?
You gonna deck this out as a cubbyhouse again, are ya? Shut up.
Yeah? What, and rent it out for five cents?
- Get fucked. Yeah?
- Yeah, what then?
Well, seriously, I'm saving up to buy my own truck.
All right, I figure that I'll start with one rig... and see how it goes... Well, come with me.
It's 800 bucks a week.
800. Even if you could get me in,
I'm not giving everything up for a job that's only gonna last three months.
Dad's right.
What do we do when it's over?
Improvise.
What are you doing here?
It's 6:00. Thought I might finish your lesson.
You been tapping long?
Nah. Just a couple of years.
How come I haven't seen you there before at class?
I quit when I had to work at the steelworks.
Can't make a living out of tap in this town.
Why does Walter keep churning out all these amazing tappers... if there's nothing for 'em to do afterwards?
He makes a few bucks.
He's a bloody great teacher. Yeah.
He just loves tap.
I'd forgotten how much I missed it...
You know, when you're on a roll and you forget all the bullshit, everything that's pissing you off.
It's great.
So, you opened that salon, huh?
Hey. Watch this.
- How's that?
- That's pretty good.
Bullshit. You're just saying that to get into my pants.
No, I'm not.
Well, yeah, I am actually.
No! No, no, no.
You're pretty good.
No. I've got terrible timing.
Well, let's see if we can take those training wheels off.
Okay? Tap, step.
Tap, step. Exactly.
See? I told you so.
Just my luck. I'm about to leave and you turn up.
I told you I had terrible timing.
There's no chance of you, uh, opening up a barbershop in Sydney?
Absolutely.
Once I take over Newcastle,
Sydney's next.
World domination, huh? Hmm.
Come on.
Up, up, up, up!
Go on, get it out! Get it out!
Yeah! Come on!
Jesus, Sean!
When are you gonna learn how to tackle?
He did a goose step.
Take 'em down now. Boys.
- Yeah.
- Good game, guys.
Hey. You coming to the pub?
Can't do it.
He's got a job in Sydney tap dancing.
They payin'?
Three month contract. I thought you gave it up when we all did.
Walter had an audition.
He didn't invite me.
That's 'cause you tap the way you tackle.
- Come on, Col.
- Travelin'.
Maybe you should practice tackling her.
- She's got you by the short and curlies.
- Get stuffed, the lot of ya.
She hates me. You shouldn't have bonked her sister.
It was her cousin. It was three years ago. Whatever.
See ya, fellas. See ya, mate.
Hey.
- Hey, Sean.
- Hey.
Good luck in Sydney, mate.
Show 'em how it's done.
Thanks, mate. Yeah. No worries.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is a great place. Yeah.
Yeah, my mom used to bring me here when I was a kid.
You must miss her.
Yeah.
She would have liked you though.
You're leaving tomorrow.
Let's not rush this.
Okay. Okay.
All right, Dad.
I'll see you, then.
Yeah, righto. Have a safe trip.
Yeah, thanks, I will.
What a warm send-off.
Hey, don't forget to speak to Gerard.
I think he really liked me.
Yeah. Well, don't hold your breath.
You can still come.
- Go on, fuck off.
- All right. Good luck with your scheme.
I'll be there on opening night.
You're just saying that to get in my pants.
Mmm.
All right, well, um,
I'll give you a call.
And come down before that, like, on a weekend, when I'm settled in.
I'd love to.
Hi, mate. You all right?
You off then? Yeah.
Don't screw it up.
Keep it simple and no improvising.
Keep it simple. No improvising.
Get out of here. I got it covered.
Don't worry.
* I see the city and it isn't what it used to be *
* A million houses goin' up and down in front of me *
* No time to let the concrete set *
* Before it's broken up again *
* Don't care if it's historic
Don't really care at all *
* A hidden landscape on the brink of a development *
* A protest rally never satisfied with development *
* Both striving for a perfect world *
* Each having their own opinions *
* It's all a sequence
It goes on and on *
* All torn down *
* All torn down **
Stop. Stop! It's sloppy.
First positions.
Hey. You're doing well.
Just two things.
Don't upstage Anthony.
Huh? During the routine, stay in line.
And, uh, that's Anthony's fiancée.
Absolutely no idea.
Now I want it right in this little crease here. Is Sebastian coming?
He's such a piker. Yes, Sara.
I know where to put it, okay?
Come on. We're on.
Yeah. No, we're gonna get a cab.
See you there. All right, bye.
What?
The business line is not for personal calls. Is not for personal calls.
Okay. Okay.
- What is wrong with you? You've been a pain in the ass lately.
- Bullshit.
- Sara?
- Total pain in the ass.
Well, sorry, girls. I've been trying to balance the books.
It's not easy, you know. Didn't I tell you to stay away from the Okden brothers?
Don't start. Don't tell me you've got the hots for old doorknob Sean.
Doorknob? Yeah.
Everybody's had a turn.
You know.
- Hey, has he rung yet?
- No, I guess he's just really busy.
Well, why don't you ring him?
'Cause I don't have his number.
He's been gone three weeks and hasn't rung?
Girl, the guy's finding it somewhere else.
Ow.
We're going out.
No, thanks. I'm not in the mood.
You can't go on waiting for him to call.
We're going out. We're gonna have a couple of drinks and a bit of a dance.
It'll be fun. Come on.
You're right.
- Hi, this is Linda.
- And Kim.
Ladies and gentlemen, the beep.
Hi, Linda. It's me.
Uh, I can't believe I'm finally getting through. Your phone's always busy.
Anyway, I've been pretty flat out, but they're finally, uh, giving us this weekend off.
So, it'd be great if you could come down.
Uh, I've got my own place set up, but, uh, well, the phone's not on there yet.
So, leave a message at the theater.
I miss you.
How's that new boyfriend?
Yeah, right, Mitch.
Hey.
Boop. Hey.
Hey. How you' doin'?
Hello. How you goin'? I'm goin' good.
Can I buy you a drink?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Schooner of New.
"I feel like a Tooheys or two."
Or three or four.
Have you heard from Sean? Shit, no.
Excuse my language.
How come you didn't go to Sydney with him?
Tap dancing's not real work.
Yeah, but you like it, don't ya?
Yeah.
I like to surf too, but I'm not gonna make a living out of it.
Do you reckon Sean's gonna come back to
Newcastle with his tail between his legs?
No. He's never coming back. Eh?
Yeah. Why do you say that?
He's my kid brother, and he's been wanting to get out of here for years, and he couldn't face Dad unless he does well.
Slap that bass. Slap those feet.
Slap that bass.
Gonna slap those feet.
- - Hey! You're a bloody little upstart. You're sacked.
- What?
- You heard me.
Now get out of here.
- Oh, you little shit.
- You better leave.
Get him out of here. Everyone's standin' around. Stop lookin' at me!
* Oh, yeah *
Yeah!
Get out.
Whoo-hoo!
- You're a heaps good dancer, eh?
- Oh, you're just saying that.
Linda. Hey, glamour. Wait up.
What's up? What's wrong?
- ** - Nothing.
I'm just not very good company tonight. Oh.
- One more. One more. One more.
- Ohh.
Here's my favorite song.
I gotta work tomorrow.
They're playing my song. It's mine.
Oh, Mitchell.
Your favorite song?
Yeah, it's my song.
- Yeah.
- * Leave the city far behind *
* Don't need people with a one-track mind *
* Jealousy takes all their time **
Shit!
What?
Sorry, um, you gotta get up.
Well, good morning to you too.
Hi, Linda. It's me.
Uh, I can't believe
I'm finally getting through.
Your phone's always busy.
Anyway, um, I've been pretty flat out...
- What's the rush?
- I'm late.
For what? Work.
You'll have to let yourself out, okay? Okay.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Fuckin' prick!
You know how cold it is... Fucker!
You fucker! Get off!
Come on. You only just met her, and you said you weren't comin' back.
- She was fair game.
- Fair game? That's bullshit... and you know it! What are you gonna do?
Beat me up?
I'm sorry.
I mean... I like her heaps.
Yeah.
She's lovely.
So, how was Sydney?
Did you go to the opera house?
- Hello, sweet.
- What do you want?
- Hmm?
- How... How come you're back?
What do you care? Can I...
Can I talk to you, please?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
- Alone.
If you can fuck him, you can talk in front of him.
Take it easy. Take it easy? How about you stay out of this, Mitchell?
- It's always about you.
- What?
Ever since we were kids, it's always been about you. Yeah.
If something's not about you, you have a little cry. So many tears I can swim.
Mitchell, shut up!
Hey, listen. Everyone kept saying that you played around, right?
Oh! And when I didn't... Sara said you had a bad reputation.
- I didn't hear from you!
- I called!
That many times!
What? You were never on the fuckin' phone!
I... I thought that you'd...
You'd found someone in Sydney.
Thank you for having such faith in me!
Sean, listen, I'm sorry.
Please...
I'm sorry. Late for that now, isn't it?
You can have her, mate.
Would you like my jacket?
Just...
- I thought you were in Sydney.
- Didn't work out.
And now John, 40 minutes out.
Move over.
This one's gonna pull up.
Last night's game.
I fell asleep in front of the telly.
Got pissed in front of the telly actually.
And tolling the kicks up.
Oh, yes!
One of your old actions, eh, Dad?
Yeah.
Except I was tougher than that bastard.
You can get your job back, you know.
I had a talk to Bobby Williams, asked him not to fill the position.
Yeah, thanks for the support, Dad.
- You screwed up a golden opportunity.
- Can we not talk about it?
- What the hell happened?
- I thought we weren't gonna talk about it.
I'm gonna start my own tap group.
I learned one thing. Me and the guys are better tappers... than any of those wankers
I worked with in Sydney.
Have you got any idea what it takes to put on a show?
Don't worry. I'll improvise.
Startin' now.
Can I use your studio for rehearsals?
Up, down. A one, two. Good go.
A five, a six, up, down.
A one, a one, a one, a one, a one and a two and a three and a four and a five, six, seven, eight.
Good go. All right, thank you.
Hey, hang on.
I want a word with ya. Hey.
Hey. What are you doing back?
Ooh, long story. All right, Gus, listen.
Basically, I'm starting up a tap group, and I want you on board.
And you, what's...
What is your name?
Oh, Johnno. Johnno. Johnno.
What do you reckon?
Oh, man, I've got a wage here.
Uh, five, six, seven, eight.
Yeah. Well, you wouldn't have to quit work.
Down, a one. I mean, we'd be rehearsing at night.
Up, stage. And a wage?
Walter's pay is crap.
You could make loads of extra money.
Pick 'em up!
Two, three, four.
And you'd be performing.
Yeah, okay. All right, up and to the corner. Thank you.
Johnno, you've got nothing to lose.
You're young and you know how to tap dance, but you need to take the next step, which is to perform with some guys who really know how to tap dance.
Sounds a bit risky.
Well, for me it is.
For you, it's not.
Look, you're young. You're still in school, for Christ sakes.
Mate, this is the best offer you'll ever get.
You can't be Walter's gofer all your life.
And when you're in a show, girls want to knock you off.
- I'm in.
- What do you say, gofer?
Huh? Girls. All right, travel.
We get to go to Brisbane. We get to go to Jupiter's Casino, the Gold Coast.
Hey, hey, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Sean.
Let me get this straight, mate.
You waltz in here, you criticize my job, and then you expect me to drop everything... to join some nonexistent tap troupe that's gonna tour Queensland?
Yeah, that's about it.
When do we start? Eh?
How about now?
Whoo.
Hey, what kind of drugs are you on?
You know how I feel about that shit.
Yeah, I know how you feel about this shit as well.
If it took off, you wouldn't have to work here anymore. Hi, Sean.
Well, it's worth a laugh. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Real laugh a minute.
Complete strangers wanting to beat me up because they think I'm some dancing poofter.
Give him a drink, mate.
It's all right.
Don't worry about that, mate.
We know you're straight.
You stare at tits all night. Yeah.
Are you in? Whoo.
Is Mitch doing it?
- No.
- Well, then who?
Uh, a new kid called Johnno, Angus, myself.
Oh, fuckin' Angus.
The guy's a total pain in the ass.
Never shuts the fuck up.
Chat, chat, fuckin' chat.
Yeah, all right.
Worried he's gonna show you up?
I'm heaps better than that prick.
Really? Yeah.
- Show me.
Come on. Dance, you big lug.
* I know that I look kind of funny *
* Sometimes
I just don't act right *
They're showing you up.
* I'm not a teenage dream
I never made the team *
* Like Frankenstein
I get some people afraid *
* I don't even have to try *
* They cross the street to pass me by *
Come on! Take it off!
* Come on, tease me **
Are you gonna join?
Don't know. Come on.
All the other guys are doing it. I'm not making you any long-term promises.
Good man. Right.
Put these on. I want to see if you're in form.
No. Let me think about it.
Derrick, you look just like the construction worker from the Village People.
Yeah, right.
Oh, fuck!
You might want to lift your feet a little too. Your taps sound a bit muddy.
All right, all right. Come on.
Let's take it from the top.
We'll remotely stay in time?
Can you stop fucking about?
Sorry.
Five, six, seven and...
Lookin' flash, boys.
Come on, Col. Time to go.
I better get going. What?
Sorry, guys. We haven't finished.
Colin, fun and games are over.
Well, anybody need a lift?
Why isn't this working?
Now, Sean, I've been thinking about it, and the fact of the matter is...
The fact is the matter, what?
Our routines are no different to the most basic stuff tap dancers have always done, mate.
We're just wearing different hats.
Your station, 2HD.
With Summer and Tony this morning.
We've just heard news there's been a major traffic problem in Hunter Street, Newcastle.
A two-car accident, partially blocking one lane, causing massive traffic problems.
If you're in that area...
Where were you till all hours?
Out and about.
How much money have you saved towards the rig?
About 3,000. Mm-hmm.
Still gonna get the late-'80s Kenworth?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
They run about 80 grand, don't they?
Yeah, I reckon if I save about 15,
I can go for a loan.
Hmm. Well, it's only five grand, but...
I'll throw in the money that your mother left ya.
I thought we weren't getting that till we turned 25.
You weren't. But this is for something worthwhile, isn't it?
That's great. Yeah.
What did I tell you?
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
I guess the girls were right.
Didn't take you long to find someone else, eh?
Oh, Linda, this is my cousin Annabelle.
Hi. Hello.
Listen, I'm gonna go. Um, thanks. I hate coming down here on my own.
No worries. Say g'day to your mum, yeah?
Yeah. Nice to meet you.
See ya.
You were saying? Sorry.
How much for the extractor? 100.
I've got 90. That's all right.
- Shit!
- You must have a problem with your hearing, Mitchell.
Excuse me? Never fuck with a man's livelihood.
There's a blue. Hey, boys!
There's a blue on!
How's my tap dancing, sunshine? Whoo!
You mother...
Take this!
Easy.
Hurry up!
Go! Go! Go! Come on!
Hurry up, you squashed fuck!
I don't know why the hell
I'm helping you! Just go!
Get him! Shut up!
- Turn the fuckin' music up!
Come on. Hit him.
I'll fuckin' kill him.
I got him.
Whoo!
You're fucked! You're fucked!
Hit him! Hit him!
Fucker!
Fucker!
Yeah.
Whoo!
Esther.
You're playing with the big boys now, son.
I find out you're selling again, I'll put you out of business for good.
Fuckin' prick! And you watch it too, you little faggoty cocksucker.
You're a wanker, Huey!
Chilly, eh, boys?
What the fuck was that about?
Tell me! I just lost my fucking bike.
I've got a business going.
What business?
For the last couple of months, I've been stealing cars and selling the parts.
You fucking what? And Huey hasn't taken kindly to it.
Well, what's it to him?
It's what he does.
And I used to work with him, and he ripped me off and...
Well, now he can get fucked.
Eh, fuck him.
Jesus. Fuck, Mitch!
Oh, settle down.
What if Dad found out?
Settle... Shh.
Settle down. Settle down. Yeah.
Yeah? That fuckin' prick just nearly ran us down.
It's not for long. Just till I've got enough money for me rig, and then we're sweet.
No worries.
Christ! You're dreamin'!
You're gonna get yourself busted or killed!
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Piss it off, mate.
It's bad news.
Oh, whatever. Jesus.
Look, I'm starting my own tap group.
Why don't you do that?
No way. Everyone else is doing it.
Yeah? Mmm.
It's your thing.
Now just think.
Where could you put on this show for free?
Here?
Yep.
Plenty of room up the end there for a stage.
Place hasn't been used for months.
I don't think you'd have any trouble getting permission to use it.
It's not what I had in mind.
Yeah, well, improvise.
Yeah, all right.
I'll still need... heaps of money for... lights, sound, stage.
Yeah.
Don't look at me.
- You want to borrow $4,000 to put on a dancin' show?
- Yeah. Yeah.
You'll get the money back with interest.
I've retrenched 16 men... in the last two weeks.
All right. You can use the machine shop, but that's it, all right?
I'm not sponsoring no fuckin' dancing show.
- And don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
- All right, thanks.
G'day. G'day.
You know the money Mum left me?
Yeah. Could I have it now, please?
What for? Does it matter?
Yeah, of course it matters.
I'm trying to put a tap group together.
The money's for something worthwhile.
I'm not gonna let you flush it down the shit-house on some half-assed dance show.
- But you gave it to Mitch.
- Because your brother's got brains.
He's buying a rig.
Now, that's worthwhile.
So what I wanna do don't matter?
The answer's no, Sean.
Now go back to work.
What are you doing here?
Your dad told me that I might find you here.
Sean, listen, would you...
Would you just hear me out?
I'm really, really sorry about what happened.
I was drinking.
I know that's no excuse.
I really screwed up.
It was my brother, for Christ's sakes.
I'm really sorry.
I thought we had something.
We do.
We do.
S-Sean.
I love you.
I love you.
But if we give it like a graduated cut up the side, you're gonna free up all that lovely curl that you've got naturally.
It's gonna look beautiful. You still want to be able to wear it up to work.
When's the wedding date? A couple months?
I think it'll look really nice.
Can I have a word?
Mitchell, I'm working.
It's just for a sec, sweet.
Just for a sec.
Just for a sec. Excuse me.
Mitchell, look out.
Oh, my God. You're off your face.
Nah, no.
Look, you don't think Sean's gonna hang around, do ya?
What? Do ya?
Yeah, I do. No. I mean, like, until he gets another chance, and then he's gonna be gone just like a rat up a drainpipe.
You better leave. I've gotta get back to work.
I should... should just forget it ever happened, eh?
Yeah.
I can't. I love ya.
Look.
We can be friends, okay?
But that's it.
Come on, mate.
Go home and sleep it off.
Go on.
Hey, Sean! Sean.
This is my cousin Newt. His band wants to be in the show.
You think Bon Jovi's music's appropriate?
He trained at the Con.
The Conservatory of Music in Sydney?
No. Connolly's School of
Guitar on Baker Street.
He'll do it for free.
We could use a live band.
** Something like this.
All right!
* Yep *
- Car bloke, mate?
- Yeah.
This it? Yeah. Two-liter turbo.
I'll take it. Cool.
Boys!
Good evening, son.
Good to have you back.
All right, get the shit.
* Rack 'em up, Jim
It's your break *
* Set 'em up, Max It's my shout *
* You know, I really could go a round or three *
* You wouldn't believe the crap
I've had to deal with this week *
* And I'm shoveling most of it for free *
* Grace under pressure
That's what the old man said *
* Well, the old man said a lot of things in his time *
* Well, fighting a bull's one thing * Fuck. My car.
* Fighting bullshit's another *
* You know, around here the bullshit just never seems to die *
* I just want nothing on my mind *
* Nothing on my mind *
* Nothing on my mind *
* Nothing on my mind *
* Nothing on my mind *
* Nothing on my mind *
* Nothing on my mind *
* Nothing on my mind **
One, two, three, four!
Fuck it.
I can't believe he's actually getting worse. I didn't think it was possible.
- You guys talking about me?
- Yeah.
You really do suck, mate.
Yeah, all right.
Come on, let's take it from the top, the music part. Okay, Sean.
All right, it's too loud.
I can't hear the taps.
- Turn it down.
- Don't go no lower than that.
How many times are we gonna have to fuckin' tell you?
- Just turn it down.
- Hey, Mitch!
How are ya, eh? Doin' good?
Nice to see you shaved off the bum fluff, Derrick.
Boys.
Hey, Sean.
Oh, no. What happened to you now?
Don't worry about it.
I like your new tap style, but your band is bloody loud.
You're gonna have to do something about that. Yep. Tell me about it.
This guy is a kook.
Get him a root, he'll improve.
- That's beyond my powers.
- I've had a root.
What are you doing here? You gonna come and join us for a bit of a tap dance?
What's the point of all this shit?
Come on. Let's go have a beer.
What's wrong with it? We're doing something. Better than the steelworks.
Plus, I need some bloody inspiration.
These guys are shit.
Yeah, yeah. No, only joking.
Put some boots on.
Give me something.
No, he's right.
You are shit. Let's go.
Ah, Mitchie! Shut up.
I just can't believe he's doing it.
I feel like we're mates again.
That's great.
Sean. What is it?
Come on. I don't have time for this, huh?
I need to know. I'll shoot you.
You're gonna shoot me?
Yeah, I'll shoot you.
I think I'm gonna shoot you.
I think I'm gonna shoot you.
Huh? Don't. Don't.
Are you all right? Yeah. I'm just not feeling very well.
Oh, do you want me to get you something?
No, I'm fine.
This looks good.
Got a Stiffin's man.
All right, smart-ass.
Hey, guys. I'd like you to meet my friend Holly.
She's a cadet journo at the Herald.
Said she'd do a story on us.
It's a pleasure. Idiot.
So, what's the name of this tap troupe?
Bootmen. It is?
Yeah.
Hey, so, Holly, is it, um...
Hey! I thought you'd given us a discount on this stuff.
I did. Well, I don't have that sort of money with me.
Well, at 6:55 on the night,
I want $3,700 in cash, or I pack up all this equipment.
Understood? Understood?
Yeah. I'll see you at rehearsals.
What for?
Well, this does include you running the lights and sound desk, doesn't it?
No. That's an extra $200.
"Doesn't it"? What?
Hey, that's a rip-off.
Yeah, it is. It is.
But as they say, like it or lump it.
3,900? Yeah.
Even at 10 bucks a head, we still need 400 people... to turn up on the night just to cover that.
It ain't gonna happen.
We're gonna need more than a newspaper story.
Haven't you ever wondered why nobody gets a ride home with you?
Because nobody wants to be trapped in a car with you. Shut up, all right?
Go, go, go!
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Excuse me, sweet.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Hey, look at these bloody idiots.
Shit. It's the boys.
Now, this is wide exposure. Yeah.
You forget your pom-poms, lady?
Come on.
Hey, we should look on the bright side.
Even if we did get it back to front, at least it was wide exposure.
Yeah, except now everyone in town thinks we're complete dickheads.
Every time you fuck it up, it's gonna cost you two bucks.
Colin.
I just saw you on television.
Yeah?
Yes! Getting arrested.
You looked like a bunch of morons.
Why do you always have to be so negative?
Nothing's ever good enough. You're either whinging about something or bossing me around.
Why can't you just be nice for a change?
I saw that, Johnno. I do not have to stand here and get insulted.
- Well, then go.
- All right.
Well, go on. All right, I will.
Well, you're still here.
You did the right thing, mate.
What do you know?
You've never even had a root.
What's a root?
Come on, Dad. I wasn't charged.
Only because I know Bluey Roberts.
You made a goose out of yourself, you made a goose out of your brother, and you made an even bigger goose out of me.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Want to join our dancing troupe, Gaz?
Certainly got the legs for it.
You want a punch in the face, Clem?
Huston. Uh, no, no, no!
Huston. Get out of the way.
Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!
Don't fuck with me again, pin dick!
Jess.
Huston.
- Hey!
- Hi.
We're going to rehearsals.
Come and watch. No. I...
Can you just hold on for a minute?
Because I need to talk to you both.
You okay?
What's wrong?
- I'm pregnant.
- You're joking.
It's his.
Sean. Sean!
All right. I give you the nod, you know what to do, right?
You betcha. All right.
Hey, Sean.
We'll get going in a sec.
Good. Great.
Here he is. You're late.
- Fuckin' told ya.
- What the fuck happened to you?
I ran into some blokes who don't appreciate tap dancers. I'm quittin'.
You can't do a runner now. I told you before we started I didn't want this shit.
We need you. Don't we?
- See you later.
- Come on. It's just a black eye.
Huh? Get over here, you dickhead.
Hey, hey, guys, hey, I just have one question at this particular juncture.
Shut up, you ferret.
Hey, don't start on me, all right?
We gonna rehearse this thing or what?
Yes!
What the fuck do you... Shut up!
Drumroll, please.
Why didn't you tell me about rehearsals?
You know how I hate to be late.
- What now?
- Well, now that's not nice to say to me, is it?
I even brought my own tap shoe.
- Pretty fuckin' good, eh?
- I hope you brought your leotard.
- Fuck it!
- I'm calling the cops!
See ya.
Mitchell!
No!
Hey.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mitch.
Man, you're all right. You're all right.
You're all right.
You'll be all right, mate, yeah?
Give us a kiss.
Oh, Jesus. Mitch.
Mitchie. Mitchie.
Better come down, son.
I can't see you anymore.
It's Mitch.
I think about him all the bloody time.
I'm sorry.
He's so little.
G'day, Mr. Okden.
Should be a good game today.
Should be, Col. You all right?
Yeah, sure.
Look, I know this ain't a great time to bring it up, but are we gonna do this thing or what? No.
Come on, mate. You got us started.
I can't do it, mate.
Mitch would've wanted it.
Don't fuckin' tell me what Mitch would've wanted.
I don't feel like going to the football today.
You go with Col, and I'll go home.
I'll come with you.
All right. See you later, Col.
See you, Mr. Okden. See you, mate.
Righto! Can I have your attention, please?
I've called this meeting because I've received a bit of bad news from management.
Due to the company's new direction, operations at these steelworks... will be scaled back immediately... before a full closure in three months.
Three months? Righto, listen up.
All employees will be entitled to severance pay... commensurate with the length of employment.
That's it.
Hear us over that bloody band now, eh?
Hey, tiger. What if the Bootmen could put on a benefit for these guys?
Bootmen? I thought you gave that idea the flick.
These guys are gonna need money.
If we could get 5,000 people to turn up for a show...
Five thousand?
Just go with it for a sec.
If we charge them 10 bucks each, we'd have 50 grand.
Yeah, but there's
4,000 steelworkers.
You'd end up giving them, what?
About 12 bucks each. That's not including the cost of putting on the show.
These guys don't need a handout.
What they need is retraining, learning about computers, that sort of stuff.
If we take the 50 grand, subtract
10 for the cost of the show, we'd still have 40 grand to buy the computers.
Hey, now that's not such a bad idea.
Whoa! Quite the bouncer, aren't we?
You better believe it, bub.
What's this benefit thing about? How the hell's that gonna work? Mates!
Whack these on your boots.
Why? You want to be heard over that cousin of yours, Newt?
What have you got in mind? Hey!
What have I told you blokes about playing bloody cricket in the studio?
Mate, can you call around to all the other tap schools? What for?
We need something to make this benefit really big.
Big enough for you, tiger?
What's this?
Dad, it's the only way
I know how to help.
We can... We can raise some money, right?
And, I don't know, start a retraining center.
And, I don't know, it would...
Mightn't make Mitch's death... feel so pointless.
I really want you to come too, Dad.
Just once. Please.
Everything's still set up.
Not here. Then where?
Not here.
A benefit in the actual steelworks, in one of the workshops there.
Gotta get some money together for retraining.
We're hoping to get quite a bit of money. Good kid.
Just a reminder, the benefit concert for the steelworks is this weekend.
Hey. Hey.
So you like tap dancing?
I might see you there.
I'm in.
- Move!
- Get off the road!
Look, I just have to say that... when you have the baby, uh, I want to... I want to take care of you both.
I... I can handle it. You know,
I've really thought it through.
I've got enough money, and I don't expect anything from you.
I really want to help.
I really do.
Thanks. Yeah.
It doesn't seem real.
Shh.
Jesus, not again.
Excuse me, fellas.
For what, being a faggot?
Hey, boys, if you want to punch a poofter, well, here I am.
Bit different now it's two on two, huh?
Damn!
Hey, don't worry, man.
You're not my type.
Ten bucks! Ten dollars, folks!
Thanks. Ten bucks. Thank you.
Hey, the traffic's backed all the way up to the railway tracks.
You won't start till tomorrow night, at this rate.
Oh, yeah. We'll clear
40 grand at least, eh?
You all right? Yeah. Fine.
Now, what is it?
Well, the whole bloody town's here except Dad.
I thought he'd come.
Yeah.
Hey, it's a great job you're doing.
Break a leg, all right?
Well, tiger, aren't you gonna say,
"Keep it simple and no improvising"?
No. It's your show. You can do what the fuck you like.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Ten bucks!
- Ten dollars, folks.
- Sorry, mate. Excuse...
What are you doing here? I thought you might need a hand.
Ten dollars, folks. Cool.
Eh? Eh? Go get ready.
Yeah.
Come on, folks.
- Ready for sound.
- I love these things.
Thank Mitch.
Thanks, Mitch.
Yeah, thanks, Mitch.
All right, boys. You all right?
Just keep it simple. No improv...
I can't believe I just said that.
Let's just do it. We know it.
Yeah!
Whoo! Oh, yeah!
All right! Whoo!
Go, Col!
Whoo! All right, boys! Oh, yeah!
Bring it on! Yeah!
Oh, look!
Go, Col!
Whoo-hoo! I love you, Col!
Mum would have been so proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
They're still clapping.
You better go back out there.
Yep.
Here we go.

What'd I say?

Woman's voice: All my life, all I ever wanted to be was a rock and roll star.
...Sixty-one-forty-one
Afton Place was my home...
...Junkies, thieves, rednecks and queens...
...Rock and roll stars and freaks like me...
...I tried to leave this place where the sidewalk screams...
...And the courtyarÔs littered with broken dreams...
...But those dirty, dirty angels keep on pulling me in...
...Promising me more of nefarious sin...
Woman's voice: I was this dorky seventh grader from the Valley when I had my first cool experience.
My boyfriend, Johnny Miller, had his dad drive us to see lke and Tina Turner at the Hollywood Bowl.
Oh, man.
She scared the shit out of me!
It was the most bad-assed thing
I'd ever seen a woman do.
Suddenly, the idea of becoming a teacher or a nurse lost its edge.
Sorry, Mom.
...35 flew by near Sunset and Vine...
...I'm not getting any younger...
...Hollywood is killing me, this town's a motherfucker...
...I tried to leave this place where the sidewalk screams...
...And the courtyarÔs littered with broken dreams...
...But those dirty, dirty angels keep on pulling me in...
...Promising me more of my very sin...
Woman's voice: The second after
I'd got my driver's license,
I grabbed my fake I.D., jumped into my Pinto, and headed straight over the hill to Hollywood.
I saw the band X at The Whiskey, and I fell in love with Punk Rock.
I left that show knowing
I had to have my own band.
So I got an electric guitar, learned three chords, and cons some chicks into starting a band with me.
That was 20 years ago.
Today, and God knows how many bands later, not much has changed.
Not the gigs, not the clubs, not the money.
...I tried to leave this place where the sidewalk screams...
...And the courtyarÔs littered with broken dreams...
...But those dirty, dirty angels keep on pullin' me in...
...Promising me more of nefarious sin...
...My favorite sin...
Tonight, we made
$13.50 each.
Not even enough to support my eyeliner habit.
Lady with a baby, make a hole.
And what lucky ladies get to share this glamorous life with me?
Let me introduce you to my band.
Thaùs Faith. Guitar God by night, guitar teacher by day.
Oh, man, she loves her guitar!
I think she only stopped sleeping with it when she started sleeping with Sally.
Thaùs Sally.
Hmm, leùs see.
If Shirley Temple and Keith Moon had a love child, she would definitely be Sally.
You need help with that, missy?
Oh, yeah.
That beautiful mess is Tracy.
Lucky for her, she's a trust fund baby.
And a great bass player.
What did I say about the feet?
Oh, this is Jessica.
Hey.
It must be Friday.
- Hey.
- Am I going to see you later on?
Yeah. I'll call you.
Jacki... don't say you're going to call me unless you're going to call me, okay?
- I will see you later.
- All right.
See you later.
Let me just finish up here.
Fine.
Chicks.
I spent over 20 years living, breathing, fucking, sucking, eating, sleeping, and dreaming all things rock and roll.
It never occurred to me that I might not make it.
So, did I really want to be slugging it out in little clubs, still chasing that rock and roll dream when I was 45?
50? How about fucking 60?
I mean, at what point do I become a joke?
In two days I'll be 40.
And surprise, surprise,
I ain't no rock star.
I could quit and become the bitter old bitch who devoted her whole life to rock and roll and never succeeded... or I could stick with it and become the bitter old bitch who refused to give up.
Hmm, bitter rock chick in a band?
Bitter rock chick without a band?
Either way, bitter and rock and roll end up together.
Woman:
Go this way.
This, if...
Hello, lesbian lovers.
Hello, lady who kept make up from mind.
Now here's a foolish question.
Is Tracy here yet?
Hello. Testes, one, two, three. Testes.
...Ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga, ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga...
...Ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga...
...I can't stop this feeling...
...Deep inside of me...
...Girl, you just don't realize...
...What you do to me...
- Fuck!
...When I hold you in my arms so tight...
Shut up!
...Hooked on a feeling...
I cannot believe you know the words of that fucking song!
Tracy, while we were waiting for you, we took a vote.
We're now a cover band.
Cover this, dude.
Whore.
I'm like Cher.
Hey!
...That you're in love with me...
Yeah, yeah.
No way, man. I read the pamphlets.
Today's marijuana, tomorrow I'm a crack whore.
Faith:
I know this girl.
She had a labia reduction.
Man.
Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for that cheap rock and roll sound?
The band you've been trying to avoid all your life, the fucking worst band in the history of rock and roll.
- Would you mind not fucking...
- I'm embarrassed to introduce...
All right, Nick, Nick, enough.
Here, smoke pot and shut up, dude.
Think this could wait until after rehearsal?
- I don't think so.
- I don't think so. We'll be right back.
- Nick: Yeah!
- Come on, man, leave 'em alone.
Iùs the rock and roll sound.
- How much?
- 200, baby.
Oh, thaùs what I'm talking about.
I musùve been a good boy.
You look so good.
God, you're so beautiful!
Why don't you come with me, huh?
You don't need to practice.
They can practice. Quit.
- C'mon, Nick.
- Come with me in Mexico.
I can't, they'll kill me.
I got to stay.
Go. Get out.
At least come into the bathroom with me.
I want to show you something.
Don't be a fucking pig, dude, c'mon.
Go.
- Yo!
- Shut your hole!
...She says bad luck follows me around...
...All my friends have let me down...
...I don't need this dress, these drugs, this town...
...These people, this party, yeah, iùs bringin' me down...
Buen dia, compadre.
- How are you doing?
- Good, good, good.
Real good.
...She says
I never used to live like this...
...I had it all and walked away from it...
...I don't need these problems, this drama, this shit...
...Iùs 3:00 a.m.
And I'm losing my grip...
...With mouth full of lies and heart full of sighs...
..."Why me, oh Lord, why me?" she cries...
...'Cause everyone else is so fucked up...
...And everything else is so fucked up...
All the time.
...And it always finds me, iùs just my luck...
...Ms Tweak lives in Hollywood...
...Looking up at hell she thinks she's got it so good...
...She don't need no friends, no family, no man...
...She don't need nothing, man, she don't give a damn...
...With a mouth full of lies and a heart full of sighs...
..."Why me, oh Lord, why me?" she cries...
..."'Cause everyone else is so fucked up"...
..."And everything else is so fucked up"...
...And it always finds me, iùs just my luck...
...She says,
"Blah, blah, blah"...
...She says nothing at all...
...She says
"Blah, blah, blah"...
...She says nothing at all...
Look at you.
I can't believe you didn't tell me you were getting out?
I wanted to surprise you.
You know that guy?
Grab my bass, will you?
Oh, man!
Who's this guy?
I don't know, he's kind of fucking hot though.
In an "America's Most Wanted" kind of way.
- Hi! I'm Faith.
- I'm Animal.
Animal?
- I'm Sally's brother.
- You have a brother?
Named Animal?
Wow!
Well, where you been?
- I was in...
- He was in college.
Yeah... no, he's got lvy League written all over him.
Hey guys, can we just have a minute, please?
- All right.
- Thanks.
- I was in prison.
- Did he just say prison?
Yes, he did.
How long and what for?
Dude, you're not supposed to ask that!
Is there a prison etiquette
I don't know about?
I want to make sure he's not a child molester, or a rapist.
Jacki, he's... he's my brother.
They're always someone's brother.
You look friendlier in the photos.
Iùs nice to finally meet you, Jacki.
What photos?
Great to finally meet you, Jacki.
Nick, say hello to Sally's brother, Animal.
- Hey, man.
- Nick: Animal?
You got a problem, man?
I don't know. Do I?
I don't know.
Do you?
Stop it, Nick. Splashing your testosterone all over the place.
Shut up, Jack!
Don't talk to her like that, man.
Maybe I should just come back later, huh?
Wait a minute.
Where are you gonna go?
I saw a motel a few blocks back.
It rents by the week.
Dude, we got an extra room, you should totally stay with us.
Is that okay?
Sure, yeah.
Jacki:
Yeah, iùd be totally cool.
'Cause if Tracy and Sally just play it totally straight, and I come in just kind of chugging, like really slow, slow, slow, slow.
Then you'd come in with this lead, really slow, toom-toom-toom, build, build, build, then we just slam into the chorus.
Iùll be hot, man.
So shall I start without you?
I got to go.
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. Come here.
- Turn that thing off.
- Uh-huh.
Love is evil.
And cruel.
Radio: I'll tell you another thing. If your teenager is listening to the heavy metal music, be warned:
This could be the first step towards renouncing Jesus.
- Oh my God!
- What the fuck is that?
This music is sponsored by Satan himself...
Ooh, Satan!
...goes hand in hand with premarital sex, alcoholism, addiction to marijuana, and in some cases, madness.
- Wild madness!
- Oh, God!
...So messed up,
I want you here...
...In my room,
I want you here...
...Now we're gonna be face to face...
...And I'll lay right down in my favorite place...
...But now I wanna be your dog...
...'Cause now I wanna be your dog...
...'Cause now I wanna be your dog...
...Well, come on!
Man: Fuck, I didn't hear the beep.
Jacki, Iùs Chuck from Triple Z records.
Listen, uh, I'm sorry...
Hey Chuck, whaùs up?
I'm not busy, man.
Yeah, I know about it, iùs next month.
I read it in the Weekly. Why?
...'Cause now I'm ready to feel your hand...
Thaùs too bad, man.
Yeah, I mean, well, you know, I got to ask the rest of the band, but... that sounds pretty cool.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I'll get back to you, man.
Cool, thanks. Bye.
What is your problem?
Jesus, that was Chuck!
- I don't care who that was.
- He wanted to tell me...
Like I give a shit?
I got to pee.
Fuck!
Jacki's voice: Every band dreams of getting a call like this.
Yes! Yes!
- You're such a dick!
- Just a second!
Jacki's voice: Oh God. Please don't let us fuck this up.
What are you doing?
You know what, fuck you, Jacki and your band! I don't need this shit!
Jessica, come on, man, don't be stupid, you're not leaving.
You're so smart?
You don't even know when to apologize!
- Apologize for what?
- For what?!
I'm sorry for picking up the phone when I was fucking you again!
- Jessica...
- How about, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry for not being at your birthday
'cause of my damn rehearsal!
- You knew about that.
- You never hang out at my house.
You don't take me dancing to the gay bars 'cause...
- 'cause you hate the music?
- Well, it sucks.
- Fuck the music.
- Okay, I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry!
Oh, I'm sick of this shit!
I just apologized.
Come on, you know you don't want to leave!
Iùs mine!
Jessica!
Fuck.
Ooh! Chuck called!
What the fuck did he want?
He came sniffing around here, and then what? Nothing.
- Just listen...
- I don't know. No, Jacki.
- Fuck him, and his faux British accent!
- Faux?
Listen, I know the guy is super cheesy but he gets shit done.
Dude, he doesn't even fucking return your calls, man.
Maybe he's busy.
Thaùs funny, because when
I don't return people's telephone calls, that means I don't wanna talk to 'em.
- Guys, come on, let her finish.
- Jacki: Thank you, Sally.
Okay, you're ready, this is great. Now... well, you know the drummer guy, from Thrill 13, right?
Well, he O.D.'d.
Wow! Now, that is great fucking news, dude.
Thaùs not what I meant.
Oh, wait, they're opening for X, right?
They were.
And one of the reason's Chuck called, he can't promise us anything, but he's going to try to get us that opening slot.
What? Thaùs fucking great!
Oh, and thaùs not all.
He wants to take a meeting with us on Thursday.
Oh my God! He's going to sign us, I know it.
You are the sweetest little angel.
What, isn't that part of the reason that we're in a band?
- To get signed, and go on tour?
- Actually, I'm in a band so I get laid.
Come on, dude, chicks do not need to be in a band to get laid.
- Faith: Shut the fuck up.
- Nice.
Okay, ready?
- What do you think?
- Oh, um... it... that wasn't bad.
Yeah!
Okay, but do you remember, we were talking about... the dynamics of a song.
Whaùs that?
Um... oh, look at... we're out of time!
- Okay, I'll see you next week, then.
- Yes, cool.
Okay, bye.
Mom, that was really good, thank you. It was so good.
Well, after coffee, you get to open your presents.
- Oh yes, presents!
- I spent a lot of money.
But I got a big question, serious question,
I don't see a pony anywhere, am I ever going to get a pony?
Every year, I'm promised a pony, and every year there's no pony!
Oh, I'll never forget the look on your face when we got you that bike that looked like a pony.
- I didn't know that.
- And she named it Lucky.
Did you know she used to put carrots in the garage hoping that the bike's going to eat the carrots?
I loved that bike. One time, I remember
I came out to play, and it was gone?
- Remember that?
- Somebody stole Lucky?
- I don't remember that.
- No, Dad took it.
Dad hid Lucky to teach me a lesson to not leave it out on the front lawn.
- What else is new?
- How can you not remember that?
I came in, I was freaking out, screaming and crying,
"Oh my God! Oh my God!
Where's Lucky?"
He said, "If it was up your ass so you'd know where he was."
How about when he used to say,
"Go get me something to hit you with."
- What was that?
- How lame were we?
Why did we always get him a belt?
How genius would it have been, if we came with a wet noodle and said,
"Go ahead, Dad, whale on us."
I wish I had a dollar for every time he said,
"Did your mother have any kids that lived?"
- Shut up, you, guys.
- How about when he'd give us a bath?
- Our special bath...
- That is enough!
Way to go, Jacki.
I told you, that shit is just not funny.
- You think I don't know that?
- Yeah.
Enough.
Sorry, Mom.
I just don't know how you and your sister can joke and go on like that.
Well, what are our choices?
So, how are things going with the band?
What?
Nothing.
They're fine.
They're good. I mean... we'll see.
We have a small label looking at us.
Well, thaùs terrific, isn't it?
Yeah, we'll see.
Will they show all those tattoos on MTV?
Mom, I'm gonna keep my sleeves over it, all the time.
Just for you.
See that?
There.
I bet if you got a job illustrating books instead of people they'd provide you with...
Both:
Medical and dental insurance.
Well, honey, iùs true! What if, God forbid, something happens to you!
- Nothing's gonna happen to me.
- And you smoke way too much.
Mom, I smoke just enough.
Come on, I know you got a cake in there somewhere for me.
Yep.
I baked your favorite chocolate.
- With marshmallow frosting.
- Yes!
Come on, Mom.
Bring it on!
Jacki's voice: She left him when I was 10, thank God.
Still, a day doesn't go by when I don't think about him.
After all, he helped make me the woman I am today. Way to go, Dad!
Dude, she is going to be so psyched.
- She better like it.
- You kidding me?
She's gonna fucking love it.
Nothing says "life-time commitment" quite like a tattoo.
How's that girl you've been seeing?
Whaùs her name?
Jessica.
How is Jessica doing?
She dumped me.
Whaùs wrong with you?
You can't keep no man, you can't keep no woman...
Sally spells her name with one "L", right?
Oh, you suck!
Jacki:
Thaùs a bitchen shirt, by the way.
Oh, thank you.
Iùs too bad we missed that whole riot girl scene by about a butt hair.
- Or 10 years.
- Same thing.
But you know, you did pioneer that whole "Riot Mom" thing... that was good.
Oh, happy birthday too, by the way.
Ow! Shit!
- What?
- Fuck, that hurts!
Iùs a tattoo, man.
Iùs got to hurt a little feel to good.
- Come on, now. Don't be a pussy.
- Jeez! You don't do that again.
Do you ever think about quitting?
Quitting what?
Music.
Well, leùs pretend I could do something else, which I cannot.
Um... no.
Oh, wait, who's this, who's this?
"We're gonna play as long as there is an audience, man.
And when there's no audience, we're gonna play for the bartender!"
I never did that lame-ass gesture.
You're such a dick.
You might as well tattoo that on your forehead.
No, seriously, don't you ever think about being 50 or 60 years old, hauling our gear around, passing out fliers, fighting with the bookers and still sweating the rent?
Fuck the rent.
Ahem.
- Hello, my angel.
- Hey.
Whaùs up, girl?
- Where's Sally?
- Her room.
- Is Jacki here?
- Uh-uh.
You know, iùs these meaningful talks we have... that just make me feel so connected to you.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Open 'em.
- Oh, is it real?
- Yes, iùs real!
Ouch!
Jacki just did it today.
Oh, my God, Faith.
Happy anniversary.
Oh, baby, iùs so, so beautiful.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
- Let me see it.
- Oh.
You know,
I was noticing something... something different about you today.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
You have this brother.
Hey!
I wanted to tell you about a thousand times, and then he just showed up.
So, what did he do?
Faith, no.
Well, do you even want him here?
Yeah, I do.
Please don't make me talk about this right now.
You don't have to talk about that.
You want me to get that?
Hey.
Hey.
- How are you doing?
- Mm-hmm. I'm good.
- I guess I'm gonna finish to get ready.
- Mm-hmm.
He's coming with us?
I thought it was girl's night out.
Apparently not, dude.
After the gig, leùs go do something.
Can't man.
Nick's coming over.
Oh, you suck!
When was the last time we hung out?
I miss you, man.
- Ever since you and Nick got together...
- Jacki.
At least I'm in a relationship.
God forbid you have an emotion or two.
Thaùs really sweet.
We're talking about you right now, not me.
No, Jacki.
Iùs always about you.
Right now we're talking about your opinion of me.
No, right now iùs about my concern for you.
You mean for the band?
You got a problem, dude.
You got to deal with it.
My only problem is you at my ass lately.
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Other than that, I'm just fine.
Tracy, we have a really good chance of getting signed.
I don't want you to fuck this up for me.
- You?
- Us, you know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Are you in this band because you like to play, or are you still just trying to piss of your parents?
Yeah.
At least I'm not a 40-year-old wishing
I was a 25-year-old rock star.
- Fuck.
- Come on, you guys, leùs go!
Hey, Jacki!
Happy birthday, dude!
Is it your birthday?
Hey, happy birthday! How old are you?
How big is your dick?
I'll wait outside.
So, what are we going to do about Ms. Tweak?
I never thought I'd long for the days when Tracy was just drinking too much.
You're not thinking of kicking her out, are you?
I'm thinking I'd like to kick her ass up and down the street.
- She's a fucking great bass player.
- She's a great friend!
Can you imagine going into the studio with that? She'd be a nightmare.
- Talk to her.
- I tried. She doesn't want to hear it.
Do you want to see a hot show?
Nick, how many times do I have to tell you I do not like bell peppers?
Man, I told the guy twice... no bell peppers.
The guy's an asshole.
Fuck, man!
Mmm!
The good stuff.
What is wrong with you?
- I had a fight with Jacki.
- Again? Fuck her.
You think I drink too much?
Is that what she said?
You know, she could use a fucking drink.
Don't worry about any of that tonight.
I want you to just relax.
Have you been thinking about the fantasy, hmm?
- We're not doing that tonight, are we?
- No, no, not tonight, but... maybe you've been thinking about it, hmm?
Come on. Get off.
You promised you wouldn't talk about it once I agreed.
All right, what movie did you rent?
I thought we'd watch one of the ones I got last week.
Right. Porn and pizza.
Thaùs real romantic.
How long is that guy staying here, anyways?
- Nick, don't start, man.
- No, I'm just asking... how long?
And don't pick a fight with him either, all right?
Oh, yeah? And why is that?
Because he's been in prison, and has lots of tattoos?
I'm so scared.
No. Because iùs stupid, and pointless, thaùs why.
God, why do guys always have to fight?
Because we're men.
Manly men.
And thaùs what men do.
They already fucking hate you.
Can you please not make it any worse?
What are you talking about?
They love me.
...I was into smashing bottles...
...Oh, yeah...
...While you were laughing, calling me crazy...
...Oh, yeah...
...Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
...Oh yeah...
So are they... together?
Do you got a problem with that?
No. She's never mentioned it though.
Still bugged about Tracy?
Jacki: Whatever.
What do you know, anyway?
I know
Sally really looks up to you.
I know you've worked your ass off for this band and good things are finally happening.
- And I also know...
- Jesus Christ!
Didn't you have anything better to do in prison than listen to Sally's up-to-the-minute Clamdandy reports?
No.
Look, I know she didn't tell you about me, but I feel like I know you guys.
Dude, you didn't know your sister was a dyke!
No. I know you are sometimes.
So, Animal, what did you do for fun in prison?
She said you could be a bitch.
- But mostly she said nice things.
- Yeah, and you believed her?
Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't find myself liking you as much as I do.
Really?
...It was a good life honey...
- And I think you like me, too.
- What?
...We never had to beat...
...around the bush...
- I said I think you like me.
...Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
...Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah!
...If I fall short...
...If I don't make the grade...
...If your expectations aren't met in me today...
...There's always tomorrow...
- Yeah!
...Or tomorrow night...
- Come on, Nick, let me see that ass.
...Hang in there, baby...
...Sooner or later
I know I'll get it right...
...Please don't give up on me...
...Oh, please, don't give up on me...
- Come on, you can't do it like that.
Yeah.
...I know iùs late...
...Late in the game...
...But my feelings, my true feelings...
...Haven't changed...
...Here in my heart...
...I know, I know I wasn't wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong...
...I'd like to make amends...
...For the love that I never, ever, ever, ever showed...
And now I am going to make you achieve multiple orgasms without even touching you.
I will achieve this with hypnosis.
Look into the sacred one-eyed snake's eye.
- Nick.
- Concentrate on the snake.
Concentrate on the snake.
Do not laugh!
You do not want to anger him.
- Nick!
- What?
Come here and fuck me.
Come on.
...Don't you give up on me...
...Please, please, please...
- Come on, kiss me.
...Don't give up on me...
Tracy.
Tracy.
Thanks, baby.
Maybe you should call her.
Tracy knows we're meeting Chuck at 7:00. She's gonna show up.
- Sally: What if she doesn't?
- Jacki: I'll fucking kill her.
Ah, lives to fuck up another day.
Ha-ha.
Dude, I am never drinking red wine again.
Thaùs a start.
Listen, missy,
I'm hung over, I'm not deaf.
Hey, did you hear about our hot date with Jacki and Animal last night?
It was not a date!
You're such a fucking dick.
Oh yeah?
Did you fuck him, you whore?
No, she didn't.
Right Jacki?
Come on, man, he just got out of jail.
He'd fuck anything.
- Yeah, whaùs Nick the Dick's excuse?
- Just kidding, Jacki.
Make up does make the girl.
Could we be serious just for a second?
I just want to ask you a question.
Seriously, if you didn't know me, how old would you think I was?
I do know you, and I'm not playing that game.
Just humor me.
C'mon now, how old do I look?
C'mon now, I could take it.
Okay, you look...
I can't, I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
- Who cares, Jacki?
- You're such an asshole.
- And how old are you?
- 23, why?
Yeah, well, when I was
"23, why?" I didn't care either.
Well, I think you look like you could pass for 29.
Thank you.
But I'm not 29.
And the fact that I have to fucking lie about my age... it pisses me off.
Iùs true. Unless you're young, hip and look good on the side of a building in a fucking designer jean ad, we're not gonna get signed.
I mean, iùs just... I'm sorry.
I do not foresee a rock and roll
Jacki doll in the near future.
And I hardly doubt that we'll be drinking cola in some $30-million lame-ass video.
Iùs bullshit.
I play the guitar.
I write my own fucking songs.
Iùs just bullshit, man.
I don't want to lie.
I mean, everyone is a fucking liar.
Well, I think that you look really good for your age.
I'm going to go take a shit.
Jacki, there are worse things than getting old.
Yeah, like what?
Like not getting old.
Faith:
That would suck.
Hey, Chuck.
Hello, Clammies.
How're we doing today?
Dandy.
Nice shirt, Chuck.
You're going to be my new daddy?
If you play your cards right,
I think we could work something out.
We'll work that into the contract.
Jacki's voice: Okay, two dykes, a wannabe rock star, and a tequila-guzzling speed freak walk into a restaurant.
I always imagined it would be a bit more... I don't know, glamorous.
I mean, we'd be in this big, beautiful office, we'd sign on the dotted line, and cut to: Band onstage playing to thousands of adoring fans,
"Whaa-aa! You guys rule!
Yeah!"
My whole future is hanging in the balance at the Big Drip Cafe.
Okay, here's what I want.
I've been thinking about it for so long.
She really has.
I want it to be totally original. I want a rose, but I want it to be yellow.
- Thaùs so pretty!
- Right?
Okay, and I want two leaves on one side, but only one leaf on the other side.
Because I'm a Gemini, do you know what I mean?
Totally.
Because sometimes I can be so crazy, and then sometimes, I'm just...
- Not, right?
- Exactly.
- Something like that?
- Oh my God, thaùs it!
- Oh, it so is!
- Where do you want it?
I want it on my ankle, but really low, and really really small, so I can hide it.
And also, if I decide I don't like it later, I can just have it removed.
So, I have about a half an hour. Can do it?
Hmm.
No.
Well, why not?
Girls, there's not enough time to explain this to you now.
Besides,
I got a costumer.
I'm doing the Sistine Chapel on his scrotum.
You can stay and watch if you want.
You don't mind, do you?
No. No, you guys can stay.
Oh, you know what?
We'll come back later.
Cool.
They're out there, breeding.
So, whaùs up?
Nothing. I just thought
I'd come by and check out the shop.
- It looks great.
- Thanks.
So, let me guess.
Your mother did not name you Animal.
No, that was Sally.
I started playing drums when I was about, I don't know, 12, and Sally was really into The Muppet Show.
You know, the little hairy red guy who plays the drums, always screaming.
Animal.
So you're telling me you're named after a Muppet?
Unfortunately, yes.
But you can bet I told the guys in prison a different story.
So, why were you there?
I killed someone.
Well, manslaughter.
Thanks.
Wow. Who?
Our stepdad, whose name was Dick, if you can believe that.
He was always telling my mom she was as useless as tits on a board.
My mom was passed out on the couch.
She slept through the whole thing.
I got off from work early that night.
And to get to my room you have to pass Sally's room.
And on my way by,
I thought I heard voices.
That sounds like Sally's crying.
So, I look in, and there he is on top of her.
So I go to my room and I get my baseball bat.
I come back swinging.
He never heard me coming.
I just remember Sally... hugging her knees, on the corner of that bed, screaming at me to stop it.
I just kept hitting that fucker.
I didn't plan on killing him... but can't say I regret it.
Maybe next time we get together, we can talk about... other things.
- The next time?
- Yeah.
I came here to ask you out.
On a date?
Yeah. Iùs okay, isn't it?
- Iùs a little weird.
- Well, whaùs weird about it?
How old are you?
I'm 27.
Yeah, well... ahem...
I'm not 27.
So?
So, I think you could find someone a little bit more, you know, buoyant.
I think you're beautiful.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
Before you went away to the big house... did you date much?
Did you ever have a girlfriend?
No.
Mm-hmm.
So, it is safe to say that intimate relationships are not something you've had a lot of experience with?
It is safe to say...
I have had absolutely none.
Hmm.
So, you... you want to go get something to eat or something?
I'm not hungry.
Why don't we just grab a drink?
I'm not thirsty.
Do you wanna go see a movie?
I don't watch movies.
- We could just go hang out.
- Oh my God, you're persistent.
I've been in prison for the past 10 years.
Maybe you should get yourself a hooker.
Jacki, thaùs not what I was getting at.
...Tangled up in whaùs best...
Come on,
I'll give you a ride.
No, I'm just going to walk.
Animal, no one walks in L.A.
Well, they do if they have an expired license.
Either that or take a bus.
Ooh, the shame train.
I don't mind walking.
I'll see you later.
Jacki's voice:
Okay, he's a virgin.
A convicted murderer virgin, without a driver's license.
Why am I finding this sexy?
What are you doing here?
I didn't know where else to go.
What happened?
Tracy, what happened?
Oh, shit.
Shit.
I don't even know where to start, dude.
Thank you.
You mind?
No, go ahead.
So, Nick... he comes over tonight.
Tracy, that drives me crazy.
Can you talk so I can understand you?
Sorry.
All right.
Nick's been bugging me for months.
He wanted to do this whole "rape fantasy" thing.
Jesus, tell me you didn't go along with that.
I kept telling him no, women don't have fantasies about being raped, that iùs total bullshit, right?
But then it hits me.
I mean,
I kind of did have a fantasy.
I don't want to hear this.
- Just listen.
- I really don't want to hear this.
Jacki, just listen.
I had no idea when it was going to happen.
So he shows up tonight,
I'm crashed out on my bed, comes in my room... he's wearing a ski mask, gloves, full on... movie-of-the-week rapist attire and dialogue...
"Don't say a word, you won't get hurt."
And I'm playing the whole victim thing,
"Oh, no, please, please don't hurt me."
Meanwhile, I'm reaching under my pillow for my gun, which I've been keeping there since he became obsessed with this whole fucking stupid thing.
So, I point the gun at him, and I pull off a few rounds, and then...
Wait, wait a minute.
You shot Nick?
Well, yeah.
That was my fantasy.
To kill whoever tried to rape me.
You killed Nick?
Of course not, dude!
What do you think, I'm crazy?
I loaded the gun with blanks, but he didn't know that.
Tracy, I mean, that... thaùs pretty fucking cool.
Once he realized he wasn't dead, he got really fucking pissed.
No shit!
Whaùs so funny?
Oh, fuck.
He peed his pants when he thought that I really shot him.
He really fucking scared me, Jacki.
He started talking all kinds of crazy shit.
And he hit me.
I just got the fuck out of there.
Fuck him.
Rape fantasy.
Can I stay here tonight?
Sure.
- Would you do me a favor?
- Hmm?
I don't think
I locked the front door.
My bag is in there, my credit cards and my cash, and just... please.
Give me your keys.
I forgot how much fun it was hanging out with you.
Great, no straw.
Where's Tracy?
Well, she's not with me.
Does it look like she's with me?
'Cause I don't see her standing here.
Look, Nick, if you guys are fighting again...
No, we're not fighting.
What do you watch?
- A movie.
- A movie?
Whaùs that smell?
Is that you, Mr. Pissy Pants?
You know what?
I lied.
Tracy is mad at me.
- Do you want to know why?
- No!
Look, Nick, you need to go home, take a shower and go to bed.
I'll call you a cab.
You can wait outside.
Hollywood. Yeah, can I get the number for Celebrity Cab?
Whew!
Whaùs that all about?
Don't make a sound, and nobody's going to get hurt.
You're a freak, do you know that?
Nick: Huh?
"Nicky, I used fake bullets!
I thought you'd think it was funny."
Hmm?
You mind if I ask you a question, hmm?
Where the fuck is Tracy?
- Huh?! Where's my fucking girlfriend?
- I don't know!
I think you know.
Nick:
Whaùs the deal?!
No!
Sally?
Oh, shit! Sally, sh... oh, sh... oh, baby!
Oh, fuck!
Okay. Okay.
Iùs okay, baby.
Iùs okay.
Shh, shh... Iùs okay, I'm here.
I'm here.
Fuck! Fuck!
Okay, shh, don't move.
We're gonna get you help, okay?
Fucking, fucking, fucking motherfucker! Fuck!
...Bring on the ugly, bring on the shit...
...You bring me something that I just can't fix...
What?
...If I make you ugly...
...It might do the trick...
...No one can fix you...
- Is she all right?
...You make me sick...
- Tracy...
...You bring out the worst in me...
...And you bring out the hate in me...
...My rap is something you can say...
...Now you're ugly...
Shit.
Hey, I thought that was you, man, whaùs up?
- Nothing.
- Where's Tracy?
- I don't know.
- What, you got in another fight?
- Yeah.
- You guys!
I just came from this lame-ass party over at Cherokee. I'm just going home.
I'm going home too.
All right, man.
See you later.
Hey! Get in!
- What?
- Come on, I'll give you a ride home.
Get in the car.
You can picked up for prostitution the way you're walking around in your stupid hood.
When I was in high school, my mom wanted me to work in one of those burger joints.
- Really?
- Yeah.
But I told her I'd rather put a cigarette out in my eye.
I mean, think about it, Nick.
How many times could you actually say,
"Hi, welcome to Burger Bastards, how may I help you?"
"Would you like a drink with that?"
"Hey! Did you try our new fajitas?"
It wouldn't be long until I just snapped!
Then some day, some foolio drives up and asked me to "hold the pickles."
I'd just lunged through that window with a French fry scoop in my hand and I just rammed those fucking pickles right down his throat.
Jacki, you just missed my turn!
Fuck!
Next thing you know, I'm standing in front of some judge with this court-ordered attorney pleading the "special orders do fucking upset us" defense.
Yeah, great. Listen, flip a bitch at this light, will you?
- I'm fucking tired.
- But iùd be worth it.
You know why, Nick?
- You're a fucking idiot, you know that?
- Because when shit like that happens, iùs never about the pickle.
Okay, thaùs good.
Animal, thaùs enough!
What the fuck are you doing?
You're gonna kill him!
Fucking asshole!
I gotta pee.
Jacki's voice:
Okay, a murderer, a rapist, and a dyke walk into a tattoo shop.
Oh, God.
Please, a little help here!
I need a sign, man.
Just a little something to tell me what the fuck I'm supposed to do.
...Bring on the ugly...
...Bring on the shit...
...You bring me something...
...That I just can't fix...
...If I make you ugly...
...It might do the trick...
...No one can fix you...
...You make me sick...
...You bring out the worst in me...
...And you bring out the hate in me...
...My rap is something you can say...
...Can't see you comin'...
...But we feel you leave...
...Don't see your own messes...
...You don't feel the grief...
...When you bring on the ugly...
...When you bring on the shit...
...You bring me something...
...That I just can't fix...
...You bring out the worst in me...
...And you bring out the hate in me...
...My rap is something you can say...
...Now you're ugly...
...Did I take revenge on my broken brother?
...Shall I make amends?
...Should I even bother?
...Did he pay the price for so many others?
...'Cause I don't feel a thing for that sick motherfucker!
...You bring out the worst in me...
...And you bring out the hate in me...
- You fucked up, homeboy.
...My rap is something you can say...
Would you let me help you?
- I'll cook us something.
- Will you just stop, please stop!
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go get some air, okay?
Hey, babe.
Oh, Jesus.
What the fuck?
You're just making this worse by avoiding her.
You can't...
I feel like
Tracy is just hiding from me.
And Faith, oh my God! Man, sometimes I catch her looking at me, like she expects me to shatter.
I fucking hate it.
And my brother...
I love him, but... we don't even know what to say to each other.
Did he tell you why he was in prison?
Yeah.
You what I remember most about that night?
My brother beating our stepfather to death in my bed with me still in it.
I wish I'd had a big brother like Animal.
I was eight years old...
I remember... watching this movie...
I don't remember what it was called, but...
Bobby Darin was in it.
And he was playing his guitar in some army hospital.
And I tried so hard to pretend that he was singing to me, and that I was there, so I didn't have to be where I was.
I watched a lot of movies like that.
I just... I don't want people to feel sorry for me.
I mean, I feel like a freak.
You're just kids, for Chrisùs sake.
They're the freaks, man.
You know...
Sal, I know it sounds stupid, when you say it out loud you know, or corny, whatever, but iùs true, man.
Music was the one thing that helped me.
When I play, I feel...
Safe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow!
I think I need to go beat the fuck out of my drums.
Yeah, you do.
...Every six minutes someone says "no"...
...Every six minutes she gets ignored...
...Iùs not what you're wearing...
...Iùs not where you've been...
...The fact that they think so...
...Tells you something about sin...
...Tells you something about sin...
...Every six minutes...

...She gets ignored...
...Iùs not what you're wearing...
...Iùs not where you've been...
...The fact that they think so...
...Tells you something about sin...
...Every six minutes...
...A woman cries...
...Because every six minutes...
...Her pleads are denied...
...No one's asking for it...
...Iùs no woman's even desire...
...That fact that they think so...
...Is a man-made liar...
...The passing of time...
...Have bring me closer to me...
...'Cause I got love and justice...
...That keeps you free...
...I've got.38 special...
...Reasons at my side...
...Face the ultimate "no," big boy...
...This time I'll decide...
...If I had a bullet...
...For every six minutes...
...I know just where to put it...
...Every six minutes...
...Running your heart...
...Running your brain...
...Maybe I gotta start...
...Just might ease my pain...
...The passing of time...
...Brings you closer to me...
...'Cause I got love and justice...
...That keeps you free...
...I've got.38 special...

Hi, Daddy, iùs me.
I think there's something wrong with my car.
You know, the clutch or the brakes or something.
If you could put some extra money in my account this week?
Okay. Thanks, Daddy.
I love you. Bye.
Fuck!
I see you finally got yourself a roadie.
Well, yeah.
Well, my mom told I'd hurt my female parts hauling all that gear, so there you go.
Listen, now.
Did you ever think about wearing a dress?
I think about a lot of things, Chuck, but thaùs definitely not one of them.
Well, thaùs too bad,
I think you'd look good in a dress. Pretty.
I think you'd look pretty in a dress too, Chuck.
Well, l... I should have your contract wrapped up in a week or so.
Sounds great.
We're psyched. Thanks.
Well, I think that deserves a hug.
Huh?
Okay, thaùs good,
Chuck, thanks.
Right, right. Sorry.
- All right. Well, I'll see you.
- See you.
Where the fuck is Tracy?
Can't keep pretending to tune this guitar.
We're gonna have to go on without her.
Well, thaùll sound like shit.
- What the fuck are we supposed to do?
- Hey!
Iùs nice of you to fucking show up.
Tracy: Okay.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Think you can take it from here?
Nee-nee-me-nee!
...Even the drugs look good on you...
...Hey, pretty, pretty...
...You fuck a rock and roll star...
...You're a gorgeous mess...
...A mess thaùs gone too far...
...Hey, pretty, pretty...
...Oh, pretty...
...Oh, pretty, oh, pretty...
...Yeah, yeah, yeah...
...Oh!
Hey, Tracy.
Iùs been a long time.
- How are you?
- Looking good.
Yeah?
I could be a lot better.
Hey!
Here, try this.
Oh, shit! Okay.
Incoming student, be nice.
- Hi, Faith!
- Hi!
Great show!
Dude, you guys are so good!
But you know what, you would be really good, if all of your songs were faster and louder.
- Okay. Go home, and practice.
- Practice?
- Slow, yeah!
- Slow.
- Okay?
- Yeah!
- Okay, bye guys.
- All right.
I don't have any money on me right now.
Come on, Johnny,
I could pay you on Monday!
- You know better than that.
- Johnny, come on, man!
You know I'm good for it.
You know I'm good for it.
Johnny, come on,
I'll give you my bass.
Jesus, Tracy.
C'mon, what you want from me?
Please, give me a break!
Oh, fuck you.
All right. All right.
Ah, fuck!
Don't fucking come in my mouth, all right?
Hey!
Tracy!
What the fuck are you doing, man?
- I'm going home.
- No, you're not.
No, you are not.
You're coming back in there with me.
Chuck is in there. You're going to come back into the club and pretend you actually give a shit about this band for about five minutes.
I got to get the fuck out of here, okay?
Oh, Jesus!
Jesus, Tracy!
Could you be any more low rent?
Oh, Jacki.
I think I need help.
Fine.
Here.
Go home.
No, Jacki! I mean...
Jacki's voice:
Okay, Chuck!
Leùs see what you've got here.
All right.
All right, all right.
If the recording budget is low, leùs say, $10,000, that means
I'm supposed to quit.
No, wait. Come on, now.
Leùs be fair here.
Less than $7,000.
Well, I mean, unless of course, they offer really good tour support, then it means,
I should not quit.
Shit! Ow!
Oh, no!
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Okay, when I pull it out, if iùs the right side up, thaùs an omen that I should keep going.
If iùs upside down, I'm out of here.
So long. Thanks for the trip!
Oh, yeah!
Okay, here we go.
That motherfucker!
Fuck, I should have known!
I should have fucking known!
That motherfucker!
Oh, are they fucking kidding me?!
I just wrote that last night.
What do you think?
Look at that.
We're out of time.
Okay, okay, so, I'll...
I'll see you next week?
Yes. Yes, you will.
- Yeah!
- All right.
Okay.
Remember the other night, at your gig?
- Yeah.
- And you played, and I was there, and...
Um... yeah?
That was really cool.
Rock on!
- Rock, oh yeah.
- Okay.
Practice and rock.
Okay.
What the... uh, shit!
Hey! Stop, you little runts!
...They say iùs lonely at the top...
...Let me tell you, man, it kills at the bottom...
...Well, you will never hear your name...
...If no one knows you, how can you be forgotten?
...O- oh, o-oh...
Oh, baby, come on!
Iùs gonna be okay.
You all right?
...One and one and one make three...
...For everyone but not for me...
...Is there something that I can't see?
...Is this what I was meant to be?
...O- oh, o-oh...
...They say iùs lonely at the top...
...Let me tell you, man, it kills at the bottom...
- Hey.
- Hey.
Isn't it a little late in the day for you to be drinking water?
- Where's Sally?
- She just stopped to get gas.
I got to talk to you.
What?
What?
You're weirdin' me out, what?
I'm in love with you, Jacki.
Leùs make out.
Come on, before Sally gets here.
Fuck!
All right.
I've been going to meetings.
AA meetings?
AA, NA, all the A's, you know?
Wow.
I thought something seemed different about you.
I thought, "Whaùd she do, wash her hair?
Finally clean her clothes?
Get a forehead?"
I know, man, I fucked up.
I know I fucked up.
Yep, you did.
Hey, I got 17 days clean, man.
I know iùs not a lot, but...
Iùs great, man.
Seriously, thaùs great.
Jacki:
Trace, Sally, listen.
I can't do this anymore, you guys.
I'm sorry, it has nothing to do with you, it has nothing to do with you.
- I told you.
- Thaùs bullshit!
It has everything to do with us!
You think I don't spend time feeling sorry for myself?
Jesus, you guys, how many more signs do you need?
- Iùs over.
- We just got an offer.
It wasn't an offer, Sally.
That was an insult.
I'm sorry.
You just don't understand.
Fuck you, Jacki.
I wake up every morning and I have to think of a reason to get out of bed.
Nothing makes sense.
The only thing that I do understand, the thing that I know... is I want to be here.
I spent half of my life here, or some place just like it.
- I'm tired.
- So, wait, wait a minute.
Let me get this straight. You...
I've spent so many fucking hours with you for so many years in this room, and that all it was to you, it was just like, band practice?
But, Jacki, I know you don't think
I give a shit about anything, but I do care about this.
Thaùs the only fucking thing
I've ever been good at.
Iùs the only time I feel anything...
I mean, real, anyway.
This is my family.
I just... I can't do it!
Iùs just not happening.
Besides, I can't deal with playing with some stranger.
She's not going to be a stranger.
You'll play lead.
I can't play lead.
Jacki, you can't sing either... that never stopped us.
Come on, man, we'll be a power trio.
Hey, Jacki.
If you quit, what are you going to be?
I know what Faith would say, she'd say, "shut the fuck up, and play."
What is this, the rock and roll intervention?
This fucking atmosphere is electric!
Big night, right?
Hey, Jacki, did you bring the contract?
Sure did, Chuck.
Right on.
Rock and roll, right, ladies? Huh?
Huh?
Big guy. Roadie.
Jacki:
There you go, Chuck.
What the hell is this?
Iùs my pee.
You fucked up, Jacki.
Thaùs the best offer you're ever going to get.
Rock and roll!
Right, Chuck!
Jacki:
Enjoy the show, man.
You musùve pissed her off!
You look good, man.
Come on.
Thank you.
Man:
Rock and roll!
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Clamdandy! Yeah!
This is for Faith.
Yeah! Whoo!
...Punk rock girl says,

Jacki's voice:
I know, I know,
I'm a 40-year-old woman chasing a teenage dream.
But you know what?
It all comes down this.
These 40 or 50 minutes of playing live a few times a month.
...Now I dream on the radio...
...Asking, "Where's my guy?
Did he fuck up?"...
...No one thought we'd see this day...
...When we all thought he dropped away...
...The rich or poor, right or left...
...Black and white died the same death...
Jacki's voice: At the end of the day, when all is said and done, you got your band, you got your family, and you got your friends.
...Iùs a beautiful planet...
- And if you're really lucky...
...Iùs a wonderful life...
...they're all one and the same.
...and after the bar bash...
...I'm having a party all by myself...
...I'd invite the world, but everyone's dead...
...Shall I comb my hair?
Shall I wait on guests?
...It gets any later, just wait on death!
Jacki's voice:
All my life, all I ever wanted to be
- was a rock and roll star.
...Iùs a beautiful planet...
- Instead, I'm a musician...
- Crowd: Iùs a wonderful life!
...just some chick in a band.
...Iùs a beautiful planet...
- And you know what?
- Crowd: Iùs a wonderful life!
Iùs fucking cool!
...My life is three chords so let me finish...
...Waited too damn long for my 15 minutes...
...Got a skinhead on my couch, ex-junkies in my bed...
...Roadies passed out on the floor, the fun that never ends...
...Iùs true, iùs true,
I'm poor but I'm happy...
...Iùs true, iùs true,
I'm broke but I'm fine...
...Iùs true, iùs true,
I'm poor but I'm happy...
...Iùs true, iùs true,
'cause all this nothing is mine...
...Love don't last, won't dig that hole...
...They all complain and prey for rock and roll...
...No record deal, won't sell my soul...
...They all complain and prey for rock and roll...
...Love don't last, won't dig that hole...
...They all complain and prey for rock and roll...
...No record deal, won' t sell my soul...
...They all complain and prey for rock and roll...
...Nothing used to matter except half past three...
...And the sweet, sweet taste of infidelity...
...Forget about whaùs right when being wrong is much more fun...
...Down and out in Hollywood, thaùs how the game is won...
...Iùs true, iùs true, there's a hole livin' in my heart...
...Iùs true, iùs true, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

...They all complain and prey for rock and roll...
How can you say that?
Because it's true.
You're exactly like a Sebacean.
In what way am I like a Sebacean?
In that you think that you are superior.
And that you treat the rest of us like animals.
When have I ever treated you like that?
Only every time that we have to make a decision and you think that the best idea is your idea.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! They are going to write songs about the way you guys tore this place up.
- Right. Go away.
- I am away.
- I'm- on- vacation.
- Pip, beat it.
Has it occured to you why
Pilot banished you from Moya?
Because you're both acting like a couple of immature Dredgenaughts.
- I can' believe you pissed him off.
- I didn't piss him off. You pissed him off.
You did.
Grow up!
Or ignore each other, or kill each other, but just stop fighting all the time.
I'm out of currency.
Here.
Playland for the rich too classy for ya?
But you, you just keep on hunting for that long range cargo hauler of your dreams.
Cause she's bound to show up in you lap one day.
When she passes out, I'll,
I'll take her back to Moya.
In the meantime...
I'm gonna have some fun.
I suggest you guys do the same.
- See what you did?
- You did it.
- You did.
- You.
You... Yeah, right. You did it.
This alien is Raxil.
There's one like her on every planet.
And these girls?
No có¿...
We never did get their names.
Ahh... are you boys... a couple?
- No.
- No.
Can you handle some girls looking to party?
I am a full-blooded Luxan.
And ladies, I have so much cash in my pocket that I can assure you that the three of us...
... will be out of here on our hands and knees come sunrise tomorrow morning.
I've been arrested for saying exactly the same thing on four different planets.
Fe'Tor.
Bad guy. Dressed in black.
Another bad guy. The guy with Fe'Tor.
Crichton... Crichton, wake up!
Wake up!
Crichton!
- What happened?
- What didn't happen?
Oh, God, there were girls, right?
Feathered chicks...
The, the... Rainbow Coalition.
Girls. Breasts.
Blue breasts, green breasts, I don't know.
All I know is... they spiked our drinks and took our money.
- They rolled us?
- Yeah, they rolled us.
- You know, these...
- My pulse pistol.
...shots that we took?
They spiked em.
My pulse pistol!
They-they took my damn pulse pistol!
No one stole your pulse pistol.
We're on LoMo... no weapons allowed. Your pulse pistol's on the transport pod.
I don't remember that.
Where are my boots?
D'Argo...
...we're in a window.
There are people watching.
I think they've been there for about seven arns, so... why don't you just get dressed and give 'em a good show sweetheart.
I am dressed.
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost... an astronaut... shot through a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...
I'm trying to stay alive...
Aboard this ship... this living ship... of escaped prisoners... my friends.
If you can hear me... beware... if I make it back... will they follow?
If I open the door... are you ready?
Earth is unprepared... helpless... for the nightmares...
I've seen.
Or should I stay... protect my home... not show them... you exist.
But then you'll never know... the wonders I've seen.
I said ten solar days away from Moya...
...and I meant ten!
Pilot, gimme a break. I'm tryin' to tell you what happened.
I understand, Crichton.
However, my inclination is not to accept any explanation.
Well, I can't go back down there.
I'm persona non grata on LoMo.
LoMo non grata.
Can't do it, not goin', uh-uh.
You return... beat-up, inebriated and broke, after only two!
Yeah.
But, that's what I'm tryin' to explain to you.
You said that if I could explain it, then I-I could stay onboard, right?
Proceed.
How the hell did we end up in that window?
I don't know.
- You don't think we, ah...
- I said, I don't know!
Hey, don't-don't yell. It hurts.
Have we heard from Jool or Pip yet?
- They haven't been answering their comms.
- Right. Go find 'em Lassie.
It was your idea to come down here in the first place.
You go frelling find them.
Aren't you worried about them?
Aw, hell, no.
They're probably sleepin' off the fun they had last night.
- Shut up.
- Hey, don't tell me to shut up!
You know, you're the one who told em to have fun.
Whadda you think fun is for Chiana?
- shut-up.
- What?!
John...isn't that the pile of dren we saw outside the window?
Yeah. Smile.
It was also in the bar last night, wasn't it?
I'm so glad you're not angry.
Ya know, I thought you were gonna...
Oh, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna scream!
- Don't scream!
- Did you steal our currency?
What are you talking about?
I didn't steal anything.
I came over here to talk to you, you know?
But you looked so angry before when you were in the window...
- Not talkin' about the window!
- All right.
Let me give ya something here.
I saw it all.
They're in trouble.
Yeah, they're gonna be in a lot more trouble when I find 'em.
The green and the blue chick...
Not the blue and green chick.
No, no, no.
I'm talking about your females.
I'm talking about the pretty gray one and the really annoying gold one.
- What about them?
- They're in trouble.
I can show ya. I can show ya what happened last night.
Let me go.
D'Argo, look.
Chiana knows how to look after herself.
We gotta find our money and I'm pretty sure... that this grommet is involved.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I've got something for ya.
I've got us a recording of all that happened last night.
I mean, ya don't believe it, you can see it for yourselves, ya know?
It's talking crap.
We got rolled, and I don't think we need a...
You're broke...
You can't get robbed again.
I mean, what do you think?
You think I want your shoes?
- I don't know what you want.
- You're not very smart, are you?
Now he...
...he's got brains
Now you, you're a bit of an idiot, huh?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- But, I'm bigger.
- Oh! Ow-ow. All right. Sorry-sorry-sorry.
Alright. Alright.
Ha-have you spoken to your females yet?
I'll bet you haven't spoken to them yet.
No, we haven't spoken to them, because they might be sleeping, they could be...
"Oh, yeah, princess."
How do I know you haven't spoken to them yet, huh?
You don't know that, do ya?
- No. Well, my point is...
- Will you just tell us!?
- That's Jool's comm.
- How do you know?
It's melted around the edges from when she screams.
Now. Do you want to see what happened last night or not?
'Cause I could just, you know, not.
All right, all right.
You don't have to push me.
The point is, you see, we can be friends, you can trust me, you see...
...everybody trusts me, 'cause I'm a female of my word.
- Oh, what is that?!
- It smells like...
Shh, shh, shh! Close... but no.
It-It's miramar root, you know?
Kabaah uses it in all his pleasure elixars.
Very low quality.
But we don't tell him that.
Mr. Kabaah?
- Wake up!
- Don't... yell.
Well, I have to, he's as deaf as a feather.
Wake up!
Go away.
I don't need your trouble.
Trouble? Me?
No, no, no. You must have me confused with someone else.
I'm not confused.
I've seen you snooping around, seeing you when you didn't want me to.
Is that...a Han-jee?
A Han-jee? I don't believe you.
What's a Han-jee?
Creature with removable eyes.
Optic nerves that continue to record and send back images,...
... even after they're seperated from the body.
Leave 'em in somebody's bed chamber...
You brought us to see a pornographer?!
I'm deaf, not dead.
Stop talking like I'm not here.
What do you want?
I know you've always got an eye hanging out at the LoMo bar.
So?
We're looking for a Nebari and an Interon.
You want... the show.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Who's paying?
You don't think you'll get the show for... free, do you?
We have no currency. You know that.
Come on, you gotta have something.
All right then, we are being scammed.
Ren and Stimpy here are teamin' up to rip us off.
Let's get outta here.
This phanix?
I would never team up with her.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Just to prove to you... I'll pay.
There.
- Where did you get that currency?
- Why? What's the matter?
All of our brandar tiles were stolen last night.
So? Did you have your name on 'em?
No-No!
They aren't yours, they're mine, they're mine.
You two have really got to work on your attitude, you know that?
Kabaah, give 'em a tentacle.
Put one of these on your eye.
You gotta be kidding me.
These will link back to the optic memory of last night, and act as a three-dimensional image of everything that happened in the bar.
You want us... to put one of your tentacles... in our eye?
Don't be such a grimmit
Just do it!
This is, uh... this is.
D'Argo, you-you see'n this?
This is... uh...
Well, it's, uh... it's incredible.
Kabaah, show us the females.
Oh, hello.
I can be bad. You're jealous.
All right.
Yeah, this looks really dangerous.
Those girls are in fear for their lives.
Yeah, all right.
Have you got anything else?
Kabaah, get your eye outta the gutter.
Show them later... later!
- That it?
- Yeah.
You.
You want me?
Watch.
I just won a bet.
Raslak. Make it a large.
You smell so exotic.
I like watching you dance.
I like watching you and your friend... but especially... you!
Oh, big deal. She's being hit on by some guy.
Knowing Chi, he's probably in more trouble than she is.
Wait, there's more.
I have something for you.
You...
I like the look of you.
- Who is this bastard?
- That's Fe'Tor.
Ow! Whoa, whoa!
What the hell just happened?
You didn't pay me enough to cross Fe'Tor.
- Who is Fe'Tor?
- He was what I was tryin' to show ya.
Fe'Tor's the most famous kaznick around here.
He rounds up all the good-looking ones and they all just party night and day, night and day.
- What? Does he... do them?
- He hurts 'em. e gives 'em the whiff... well, you saw.
And then they do anything.
I'm not sure, but I think this is Fe'Tor's sister.
Her freslin is still...adequate.
I'm not interested in... "adequate."
We gotta get your females out of there.
- Do you know where we can find them?
- Yeah, got an idea.
Whoa! Hey, Whoa! D'Argo. D'Argo, wait.
What we saw is from last night.
Chiana could not even be with that guy anymore.
We can't have another auction yet.
It's too soon, too dangerous.
I think our female upstairs may be exceptional. For her, we can risk it.
D'Argo, why are you believing this Raxil thing here?
Chiana was having fun.
She could be walking back into the bar right now, we don't know.
Well why don't you go to the bar and wait for her?
- D'Argo, I...
- It's fine.
I'm just going to go along and say... hello.
Squeeze her dry.
Well, I've been comm'n the girls. No answer.
- Did you find 'em?
- Found 'em.
Deliveries around the back.
- Oh, oh, 'round the back?
- Yeah.
Uh... okay, thanks.
- They okay?
- They're fine.
Jool! Jool!
- Are you all right?
- Ah! Oh, D'Argo.
- Oh, come in with me. Come on.
- Where... is... Chiana?
Over there.
Um... ah... we thought that perhaps you might be in some trouble.
I'm not in any trouble.
At least none I don't want to be in.
Where's Raxil? She didn't wait around like she said she would.
That way.
Ow! Ow! Did you see them?
Are they in trouble?
They were taking... a bath.
...we saw him... give you something.
Some stuff.
- Oh... were you spying on me?
- No... no.
D'Argo, I came here to have a good time.
Does that make you jealous?
No. I'm not jealous. It's just that, ah...
'Cause you and me, we're-we're not together anymore, are we?
Ah, no, we're not together anymore...
Well then, let go of me.
All right. You and Jool are coming with me.
Let me go!
Chiana? Everything all right?
- She's fine.
- Why don't you let go of her then?
Why don't you mind your own business, you miserable little tralk?
They had...
...weapons!
You said... it would be a party!
But they had weapons that they put to my head!
They had weapons?!
Yes, but they weren't pointed at Chiana.
They were pointed at me.
Please, please, calm yourself.
I don't like to show force.
But you are in my residence and you are attacking my people.
Now... get out.
Chiana...
D'Argo, get out. Go!
Oh, we're fine, D'Argo, really.
We're just...
Uh... D'Argo? You're gonna kill her.
At the moment, I do not have a problem with that.
- What did you spray on him?
- Freslin.
Stop! Stop!
This makes no sense.
You make no sense.
What? Wh-What doesn't make sense?
She nailed him with love potion number 9.
It made him dance?
Well, it's a way to meet girls.
Pilot, just listen to this, all right?
This is important.
This is about the deal. It's about Freslin.
LoMo's dirty little secret.
I suspect the dirtly little secret is you spent...
... all your currency on pleasure and now...
Hey! You know what?!
It's a weird universe out there man.
You don't know that 'cause you're spending all your time indoors.
Just... let me finish my story.
See?
See why I made us get off the beach?
- He would've been chasing everything that moves.
- And it's all because of this stuff you gave him?
Freslin's an attractant.
You could be attractive to someone else, or they could be attracted to you.
It could be strong, weak... anything.
Depends on where it's manufactured.
Did you like the Freslin I gave you last night?
Is this more?
Mm, different batch... different quality.
Want a taste?
Bring it on.
- It's different.
- More better?
Yeah.
An animal's last batch always is.
This is... uh, this is from an animal?
A beautiful animal.
Is this the same stuff, that that guy sprayed on Chiana last night?
Yeah. Grade-A Freslin. Made in his own lab.
Fe'Tor's got the most sensitive nose in the business!
- What am I missing?!
- Nothing. Here.
Wonderful, isn't it?
Yeah.
Now. Will you do anything for me?
I'll do anything for you.
I think Fe'Tor wants your females for more than just...
... you know.
What... does he want them for?
No peeking.
Can you smell it?
Just breathe it in.
Well, the base element of Freslin is found in the senal gland...
... of sentient beings.
- Oh, you mean, like in... people?
- Yeah.
Fe'Tor's got a machine that milks this gland.
And... and when there's a lot of demand, well sometimes he'll milk them until... they die.
You'll love it.
Can I open my eyes yet?
Why did you not tell us this earlier?
John...
These people... will not dance with me.
- No one wants to dance
- No. Go away!
- Look at the booty on that girl!
- The booty?
Sweetie pie. Why'nt'cha come with...
I should have told you everything, but I was scared.
Fe'Tor's dangerous.
If Fe'Tor is so dangerous, why help us at all?
My mate, Sarl...
...he's with Fe'Tor.
He doesn't look very well.
I mean, he's tall, he's good-looking.
I mean, look at me, I'm a nothing.
I tried to warn him, but...
I'm telling you everything because, when you save your females, I want you to save Sarl.
Isn't that the guy... that was with Fe'Tor last night?
Yeah. That's Mitols... his right-hand shill.
Well he could probably get us in to see the girls, couldn't he?
'Course he can, but he's never gonna tell ya.
Keep D'Argo busy.
I've got some business.
How ya doin'?
Man, were you here last night?
Was that wild or what?
I drink alone.
Yeah, I'm not really ah, interested in drinking either, um...
I'm lookin' for some ah...
Freslin.
And I heard that you were the guy to see.
You like the Freslin?
Trust me.
It only hurts the first time.
Go away.
Okay, okay, okay, look.. let-let me give you somethin'.
I am loaded with currency.
And I'm lookin' for somethin' a little special and this is the only crap that I've been able to find.
And, uh... Kabaah told me that you were the guy to see...
... to get some really serious dren.
If they drained that much fluid from her,
Crichton, she would be dead.
Shut up and let me tell my story!
You really must relax.
Struggle only makes it more painful. Hm?
Mm. That's you you're ingesting.
Kabaah sent you?
Why didn't you say so?
I just did.
Apex of the moon tonight.
Fe'Tor's chamber. Know where it is?
I'll find it.
We're auctioning some incredible dren.
This'll get you in.
My frelling head is killing me, from that spray, you little tralk!
D'Argo, you can kill her later.
Right now, we gotta get the girls outta Fe'tor's.
So, what are we doing here?
'Cause I'm gonna help you, see?
I'm gonna make you a sorta disguise.
Hey, Hammerhead, how'ya doin'?
I'm back for some home video.
Get out, get out!
I don't think so.
I need to see into Fe'Tor's compound.
No, I won't help you against him.
Yes you will, or I'm gonna snap your head off.
Now I'm gonna see the compound layout.
You're gonna show it to me.
I don't care if it's empty, but you're gonna show it to me now.
Eh, this is the auction room.
Not bad, all it needs is a big screen TV.
Ka-D'A-go!
No!... It-It's okay, that's um... that's Harvey, it's not Scorpy. He's a puka.
He's... he's not real.
But thanks to our unique shared conciousness in this situation, we finally get to meet!
Ka-D'A-go!
- Give me five!
- Go away.
I've had some weird conversations in my head before, but this... is a little...
Yeah, I know. Hey, look.
Harvey just shows up every now and then to give me bad advice.
And my suggestion to you both... is to forget this folly.
But... since I know you won't.
Circuit breakers...
...to the entire subterranean level.
Darkness... ah, may be of assistance to you.
You know what? I think that's not a bad idea.
And the milking room you seek?
Down the hallway.
Kabaah, show us the milking room.
Raxil, what is that thing?
That's where they drain the bodies to make the Freslin.
Pleasure Planet, my mivonks.
We better count the steps in here.
One,two, three, four, five, six, seven...
- ...eight.
- ... eight, nine, ten.
Ten steps.
- Uh-uh, eight steps.
- Ten.
Eight! Small legs, human.
Jool?
Jool!
Jool?
- Something wrong?
- No! No, no.
I- I was ah, just tryin' to find Jool.
We should really be going.
You really are quite beautiful.
Yeah.
Where's Jool?
Don't be scared.
Everything's all right.
No, I will not go to Fe'Tor's auction.
- He knows what I look like...
- I'll get you in.
...so I won't get in.
And you're not spraying me with that stuff.
I'm not spending the rest of my life...
- ...on the dance floor doing some...
- This Freslin will be different.
- No! You are not!
- Shut-up! Just shut-up! I did not do everything... plan everything, so you could back out now!
- Did you say plan?
- No, no, no, I didn't mean plan.
I make a plan, like, like,
- like plan something, you know...
- Did you say that you planned this?!
No, no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no, no...
I got everything from the Transport Pod.
Two pulse pistols, a pair of night-vision goggles,
200,000 in tiles so we can buy any...
Freslin we want, uh...
- what did I miss?
- Two guns?
You brought just two guns?
This little rodent... has been lying to us.
- She said that she planned all this.
- Two guns?!
I mean, thought you were the great Crichton and D'Argo?
I mean, you blew up a Shadow Depository.
I mean, I thought you'd bring pulse rechargers...
... and a plasma bomb...
...and a really big gunship!
But, no! You bring nothing!
You bring two little weapons that wouldn't kill a Negnec!
You... have heard of us?
Yeah, I've heard stories.
But obviously they aren't worth a bucket of dren!
What the frell have you done to her?
- Get her out of that thing, you fekkik!
- Chiana.
She's not in any pain.
Don't worry. Eh? Here.
Enough with the dren!
You really shouldn't waste... the taste.
Now, I'll let your friend rest, but I need to replace her...
...with a new animal.
Now, I knew Fe'Tor wouldn't bother your females while you were in the bar.
So I paid...
...the blue and green girls to get you out of the way. wait!
You let... Fe'Tor... kidnap Chiana and Jool?
No, I didn't help him. I just created a situation where everyone...
Is there anything else you're not telling us?!
Nothing, nothing. I promise.
This little... tralk...
... has been lying to us all along.
So, what I suggest is...
Ah! Not again!
Please don't hit me. Please don't...
All right, you can hit me just once! Just once!
- Hello...?
- What?!
I've got a live connection. The Nebari...
Chiana...
They've begun milking her... think you're going to be too late.
Ah... I was right!
You're exceptional.
Would you like a taste?
- Drain as much as you can.
- Without damaging her value, of course.
D'Argo, you should check this out.
D'Argo?
Who the... hell?!
Oh, you know... the Freslin I sprayed him with, radiates his pheromones outwards...
...and creates an auro-morph.
So, we all see D'Argo like this.
I made him very attractive... don't ya think?
What... are you talking about?
D'Argo?
No more! Enough!
Even I am not so gullible as to believe...
... that D'Argo turned into another... creature.
I do not appreciate the lies you tell in order to circumvent...
Whoa, ho! Hold o
How long have we known each other?
Approximately two and half long cycles.
I ever lie to you? Hmm? Hmm?
D'Argo looked totally different.
Look at myself in the mirror?
I... ah...
And why does he not look that way now?
Metabolism?
Look, man, let me... can I please tell the story the way I wanna tell it?
Mitols is almost ready for the Nebari.
What should I do about the other one?
Wring curls... drain till failure.
She would only spoil the program.
I am your host.
But names are not important... only currency.
Well, son, I'm your buyer, and ah... money ain't important to me! Only quality.
Know what I mean?
You've come to the right auction then.
I recommend the Nebari.
- Finest I've ever tasted.
- Right.
Raxil...
...alive, still.
I thought you'd given the Freslin trade away...
... after your disaster on Elepuria.
Well, yeah, I did lemme tell ya, but uh, things change.
Enjoy, Bid high. Excuse me.
Do I know you?
Hi...
I, ah... I doubt it.
I've become a... a new man recently.
"I made him very attractive."
15,000 on my right.
Have I any further bids?
16,000, 16,000 on my left.
There, any further bids?
Going once, twice, three times, are you all done?
16,000, sold for 16,000 brandars.
You traded Freslin.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, years ago, never killed anybody, none of it.
- None of it, my ass!
- No, no, no.
My point is, you must calm down.
Increased oxygenation hastens the metabolism of the Freslin!
It's gonna wear off?
Not for a while, not if he stays calm!
Calm. Anger; bad.
D'Argo... be cool, man.
We buy the girls, Raxil's mate, if we can.
No guns, no killing...
...and we're outta here.
I'll watch you from up here.
Distinguished friends... we now come to the sale you've been waiting for.
I present... the olfactory genius...
Heska Fe'Tor!
Does this guy just scream Vegas, or what?
Heska Fe'Tor!
Friends... welcome.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
What a fine auction this will be!
May I present to you... Chiana!
Metabolism, Luxan.
Bidding starts at 25,000.
What a wonderful bid, Heska Tinako.
Are there any others?
No?
If you don't mind, I'd like to take a closer look at the carcass...
Be my guest.
Hey, Pip. Can you hear me?
Go away.
What took you so long?
Do you mind cuttin' this heifer down, so I can take a closer look.
Where's Jool?
Milking room.
Wait, wait, wait, is she yours?
Used to be.
Look, you've got Freslin boiling in your brain.
Everything you feel's way out of whack.
What's going on down there, that's an act!
He's just pretending to be a buyer!
One quarter million brandars!
"Circuit breakers... to the entire subterranean level."
I can double that bid if you give me some more time.
No more time.
Currency... on hand.
Top the bid now, or step aside.
Sold! To Heska Tinaka for 250,000 brandars!
Did you have to caress her whole body!
- Oh for cryin' out loud!
- It's just the Freslin, it makes him, you know...
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
Listen up... Mister Horney Toad!
Jool's still in the milking room.
I'm gonna hit the lights, and get Chiana.
Good,good, good, good.
Ah... well get Jool, and her mate...
...and then we'll wait.
And remember, ten steps down the hall.
Eight steps, human.
Don't do anything till I hit the lights.
No, no.
Yeah, the lights.
Good.
This is all your fault!
If you hadn't bribed those women in the bar... none...
Easy, Luxan! Easy!
It's the Luxan!
Security, move!
Frell.
Raise you fity-dollahs.
Chiana!
- No, no, that's not right.
- It's eight.
- No, no. He said ten.
- Shut up I know what I'm talking about, it's eight. You're making me lose my place!
Eight, eight! Shut up!
You're wrong!
Okay. Ten.
Drop your weapons.
Jool, are you okay?
Who's that?
That's my mate. He's dead.
D'Argo, save me!
- Crichton.
- D'Argo!
Where's Raxil?
In there...
The mate is dead.
Right, meet you in the Pod.
Raxil!
This... is my honey!
The brains of the machine.
My design!
He stole it, sold it.
Fe'Tor didn't even know it was mine!
Worth and fortune and all!
How's your neck?
It's... fine.
I don't mind stickin' it out for you.
You don't want these broken.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Weird.
You ruined everything.
You smell... exotic!
Smell this.
- Neck still okay?
- Yeah.
I knew it.
Sad thing is... he's gonna die happy.
...and that is what it was all about.
Raxil... she was gettin' her chip back, and she used us.
She used us, man.
So it is not our fault.
I don't... believe you.
Why not?
Too many... inconsistencies.
Too much... obfuscation.
Obfuscation? How the hell does that translate?
Fine, you know, look, you don't wanna believe me?
Go ask the girls!
Chiana and Jool are still sleeping off whatever it was they did, and I'm not inclined to wake them.
Pilot, I don't think you've understood me.
Lemme just start again...
Crichton!
No! have located another planet nearby
Industrial.
Comms traffic indicates they have... accomodations for visitors.
You and D'Argo are to be... visitors.
Pack what you need, we shall return for you in eight solar days.
Pilot...
- it was real.
- Perhaps... John.
However, Moya and I desire time away from your constant bickering.
And this adventure, however embellished, does not alleviate that need.
Get out of here.
Okay.
You know, you really should get out more... these things do happen.
- What, he didn't believe you?
- No.
- Well, what was that thing about a "slim duck"?
- Slam dunk.
Whatever. It doesn't matter,
- He's throwing us off Moya!
- Yeah, well, you want to give it a go?
No.
- See. I did my best.
- Your best was to blow it!
- I did my best!
- Well, you blew it!
D'Argo he's kicking us off
Moya 'cause we argue.
He's kicking us off Moya because you argue!
- No, we argue.
- You argue!
- We! You...
- You argue.
We argue... you would argue with a lampost!
- I do not... open the door.
- You open it.
You open the door!
What, you're a girl, I'm gonna open the door for you? Open the door!
I- I'm older than you, show some respect! You open the door.
- You can open it... I'm not openin' the door.
- I'm not openin' no door... you open it.

{3822}{3870}...vidimo se na probi.
{3871}{3918}OK, cool.|Vidimo se onda.
{4028}{4067}OK.
{4103}{4121}O, Bože!
{4123}{4157}Potrošiće ceo sledeći mesec
{4158}{4205}nadajući se da te nije|napumpao.
{4206}{4263}O, začepi.|Tako je drag.
{4817}{4935}Dok se horde tinejdžera gladnih leta|slivaju niz Flagstaff, Arizona,
{4936}{4995}da vidimo što ove dve|samouverene mlade žene
{4996}{5046}imaju reći o poslednjem|danu u školi!
{5047}{5138}- Brišem odavde, Riverdale!|- Da, škola je gotova, dušo!
{5139}{5211}U redu.|Kamera te voli.
{5212}{5263}Pa, Lauren, šta radiš večeras?
{5264}{5303}Paul, prestani da se|nabacuješ mojoj prijateljici.
{5304}{5349}Šta god da radiš večeras.
{5350}{5399}Lauren, prestani da se|nabacuješ mom bratu!
{5400}{5435}Hej, hoćeš li reći mami|da ću zakasniti?
{5437}{5487}Ali, priprema roštilj za tvoju|maturu.
{5488}{5564}Moram da odem na neka mesta, vidim neke |ljude. Sačuvajte mi zagoreli burger.
{5565}{5613}- Hoćeš li me povesti kući?|- Naravno.
{6416}{6464}- Hvala, Lauren.|- Uvek.
{6464}{6529}- Hej, nazvaću te sutra.|- OK, zabavi se večeras.
{6702}{6770}Pa, Terri Boo-berry,|šta planiraš za ovo leto?
{6771}{6817}- Pevam u horu.|- Cool.
{6818}{6883}Da, i... radim u restoranu, opet.
{6884}{6930}- O, kako zabavno.|- Da.
{6931}{7014}Ali uglavnom se želim uključiti|u onaj letnji muzički program u avgustu.
{7015}{7096}- Stvarno, koji?|- Neka muzička stvar u L.A.-u.
{7096}{7185}Tata! Hajde! Nije to samo|neka muzička stvar u L.A.-u.
{7186}{7241}To je muzički konzervatorijum |Bristol-Hillman.
{7242}{7301}Samo najbolji letnji muzički|program na Zapadnoj obali,
{7302}{7362}možda čak i u celoj državi.|- Terri, ne počinji.
{7363}{7444}Ali, tata, to je meni jako važno.
{7445}{7502}Osim toga, poslala sam već|prijavnicu i CD,
{7503}{7573}zato što je mama rekla da mogu.|- To je to! Ne ideš!
{7574}{7682}- Simon, ne budi tako okrutan.|- Nina, molim te.
{7776}{7817}Terri...
{7818}{7883}- Gde si bio?|- Sa momcima.
{7884}{7972}Opraštao sam se s njima i to.|Hej, teta Nina!
{7972}{8028}- Čestitke za maturu.|- Hvala.
{8029}{8074}- Evo.|- O, uzeću to unutra.
{8075}{8132}Hej, šta nije u redu?
{8136}{8218}Terri samo želi da ide na|sjajni muzički program u L.A.-u,
{8220}{8320}a tata je u svom uobičajenom|raspoloženju da uništi svaku dobru ideju.
{8321}{8415}Nina, najlepša srednjoškolka|od svih u L.A.-u.
{8423}{8521}Znaš li šta se većini njih dogodi?|- Tata, ti ne misliš da je Terri posebna?
{8522}{8587}- Paul, ozbiljno.|Mislim da je najposebnije biće na planetu.
{8588}{8625}Ona je moja cura.
{8631}{8675}I zato ne ide u L.A.
{8676}{8738}16 joj je, za ime Boga.|Šta je s vama, ljudi?
{8739}{8809}Stotine ljudi se prijavljuje|za ovo.
{8809}{8886}Ako upadne, to je dokaz da pripada|tamo, ali ti to kapiraš, zar ne?
{8887}{8946}Gledaj, kada sam ja bio tvojih|godina, i ja sam mislio da sve znam.
{8947}{9004}Ali ja sam video puno više|sveta od tebe, Paul.
{9004}{9059}Koje delove sveta si|video, tata?
{9060}{9114}Zadnje i prednje zidove|restorana tvog oca?
{9115}{9156}OK, OK.|Paul, dosta je.
{9157}{9219}Pa, to što si zaglavio ovde, ne|znači da svi moraju zaglaviti s tobom.
{9220}{9269}Bolje pazi što govoriš, inače|ćeš dobiti zabranu izlazaka.
{9270}{9366}U redu, slušajte.|Možemo li se prestati svađati?
{9368}{9451}Zabava za maturu je.|Trebal bi da slavimo.
{9459}{9505}U redu?
{9534}{9597}Ne mogu da zagrejem ovaj|prokleti ugljen.
{9598}{9649}- O, pa probaj s ovim.|- Šta to radiš?
{9650}{9735}Bože. Prestani. To je to!|Zabrana izlazaka! U kuću.
{9738}{9805}- Obožavam naša porodčina okupljanja.|- Vraćam se odmah.
{9806}{9846}Uvek.
{10241}{10270}Pa...
{10273}{10363}Nikada nisam imala priliku|da ti čestitam na maturi.
{10364}{10454}Hvala.|Barem odlazim odavde.
{10481}{10548}Teta Nina, ako Terri uđe|u muzički program,
{10549}{10594}moraš se pobrinuti da i ode.
{10595}{10670}- Ugušiće se ako ostane ovde.|- Da, znam.
{10676}{10728}Mislila sam istu stvar.
{10807}{10858}Znači, na mojoj si strani?
{10896}{10926}Uvek.
{10981}{11017}Hej.
{11018}{11054}Šta se događa?
{11055}{11094}- Ništa.|- Ništa.
{11095}{11134}Da, tačno.
{11489}{11531}Nebo.
{11682}{11721}Zdravo, dosadnjakoviću.
{11744}{11790}Hej! Polako s tom opremom.
{11791}{11868}Šta to radiš?|Snimaš najdosadnije tinejdžere Amerike?
{12217}{12252}Dame i gospodo,
{12253}{12323}danas na "Fletcher Iskustvu",|imamo specijalno iznenađenje.
{12324}{12397}Iskreno mi je zadovoljstvo predstaviti|vam poseban vokalni dar
{12398}{12475}jedne jedine -|Terri Fletcher!
{12476}{12536}O, pa, Paul, to je lepo|od tebe. Hvala.
{12537}{12598}Iduću pesmu sam napisala|za obožavatelje.
{14542}{14600}Hej, šta ti radiš ovde?
{14721}{14757}Sa svim što se događalo|ovo popodne...
{14758}{14820}skoro sam zaboravila da ti dam|poklon za maturu.
{14861}{14905}- Three Days Grace?|- Da.
{14906}{14962}O, Bože! Kad?
{14985}{15017}Večeras.
{15042}{15075}O, ne.
{15097}{15144}Zar nisi čula da sam u kazni?
{15162}{15265}Paul. Hajde.|Nije da nikad ne kršiš pravila.
{15272}{15324}Ako ti ne ideš,|ne mogu ni ja.
{15324}{15390}Molim te.|Radi se o Three Days Grace.
{15410}{15463}- Prozor sa strane? Idemo?|- Prozor sa strane.
{15464}{15499}U redu.
{15554}{15602}Tiho, tiho!
{15869}{15918}Ne mogu da verujem kako|si me zaskočila.
{15919}{15957}Ovo je prva liga.
{15958}{16036}Pa, ko zna kada ćemo opet|prekršiti zakon, zar ne?
{16067}{16138}Ja ne ostajem u Flagstaffu, Terri.
{16149}{16255}Dobio sam posao u Phoenixu|i idem pravo u Arizona State.|Ne vraćam se.
{16281}{16339}Samo tako?|Mislim...
{16340}{16384}Vreme je.
{16403}{16464}Tata i ja...
{16472}{16516}treba nam...
{16517}{16572}Samo vreme.
{16574}{16623}Jedino zbog čega mi je loše|je to što te ostavljam ovde.
{16624}{16702}Ne. Ne moraš brinuti za mene.|Mi se dobro slažemo.
{16703}{16764}Da, to me i brine.
{16765}{16816}Radi se o više od slaganja, Terri.|Ti im udovoljavaš.
{16816}{16924}Ti si kao Stepfordska kći iz|pretplatničkog časopisa.
{16925}{16991}Je li to kompliment?
{17010}{17053}Nakon što ti je tata|zabranio Bristol-Hillman,
{17054}{17088}reći ćeš mi da te to ne boli?
{17088}{17168}- Ne, jako boli.|- Onda napravi scenu!
{17169}{17248}Razbij nešto! Vrišti!|Ja... nešto.
{17249}{17306}A-a. To nikad nije bilo|moje područje.
{17307}{17364}Terri, imaš najbolji glas|koji sam ikada čuo,
{17364}{17457}ali ako ostaneš pri "Svetu|Po Simonu Fletcheru",
{17458}{17532}sa 40 ćeš i dalje nastupati|po provincijskim zabavama.
{17568}{17598}A to bi bilo sranje.
{17599}{17640}To bi bilo sranje.
{18131}{18192}Šta ima, Flagstaff?|Jeste li vi, ljudi, dobro?
{18237}{18285}U redu...
{19222}{19259}Malo pomoći?
{19260}{19320}Paul, nemoj... O, moj Bože.
{20408}{20453}Paul, pazi!
{21629}{21661}O... Hvala Bogu.
{21914}{21959}Paul?
{21993}{22041}Ne.
{22182}{22228}Lepo zaceljuje.
{22228}{22276}Još imaš glavobolju?
{22356}{22424}Možeš li mi reći|kad ti je rođendan?
{22425}{22471}20. aprila.
{22486}{22538}Pustimo Terri|da odgovori sledeće.
{22544}{22590}Reci mi koji je mesec.
{22616}{22669}- Juli.|- Što nije u redu s njom?
{22670}{22766}Zašto ne može da govori?|Terri, reci mi koji je mesec.
{22799}{22871}- Juli.|- Tako je.
{22875}{22922}Sada sledi ovo svetlo očima.
{23086}{23158}Doktore, stanite!|Šta god da radite, samo stanite.
{23821}{23875}Da sam barem starija.
{23890}{23964}Tako se bojim da ću učiniti nešto glupo|i samo pogoršati stvar.
{25384}{25480}- Hej, teta Nina.|- Zdravo, Terri Boo-berry.
{25487}{25525}Dušo.
{25558}{25671}- Zašto je ovo bilo u smeću?|- Upala si. Čestitam.
{25674}{25750}- Paul bi se tako ponosio.|- Mama, šta to radiš?
{25751}{25853}Da je Paul ovde, on bi se|opet posvađao s tatom do krvi.
{25854}{25903}OK. Sada je sve drugačije.
{25904}{25990}- Još želiš da ideš?|- Ne želim više da pevam.
{25991}{26048}Ne verujem ti,|Terri.
{26137}{26204}Zašto mi ne dopustiš da ja|obradim tvog tatu u vezi toga.
{26273}{26348}- Mislim da bi Terri trebalo da me poseti.|- Hm.
{26349}{26406}Simon, stvarno mislim da|treba da se malo makne
{26407}{26479}i želela bih da provede|avgust u Palm Desertu.
{26481}{26570}Mesec dana s tobom,|same u pustinji? Jesi li luda?
{26597}{26647}Sama je, zar ne?
{26648}{26723}Trenutno sam između dve veze.|Pa da, sama sam.
{26724}{26768}Da, na trenutak.
{26812}{26859}Pa, ko će mi pomagati|u restoranu?
{26861}{26911}O, je li to stvarno ono|što hoćeš da kažeš, Simon?
{26912}{26972}"Ko će mi pomagati|u restoranu?"
{27075}{27142}Teta Nina,|ko je rekao da ti to možeš?
{27143}{27195}Nikad pre nisam lagala ocu.
{27196}{27252}Terri, jednostavno mislim|da je to tvoj život.
{27253}{27350}Zaslužuješ priliku da ga živiš.|Zašto onda misliš da je to pogrešno?
{27401}{27476}Ima nešto o tvom ocu što|sumnjam da znaš.
{27476}{27579}On i njegov prijatelj David su obojica|dobili fudbalske stipendije za U.C.L.A.
{27593}{27618}Stvarno?
{27623}{27660}I kada je prošla|matura,
{27661}{27780}naš porodični restoran je išao dobro,|ali naši roditelji nisu.
{27784}{27836}Niko od nas nije hteo restoran,
{27837}{27912}ali tvoj tata je osećao kao da|nema izbora nego da ga preuzme.
{27925}{28004}I... njegov prijatelj David|je otišao na U.C.L.A.
{28005}{28128}I upao je u scenu L.A.-a|i od tada je u problemima.
{28129}{28176}Ali ja znam -
{28177}{28233}da je tvoj tata prihvatio|stipendiju,
{28234}{28310}on to ne bi učinio.
{28314}{28384}Pa, kakve to ima sa mnom?
{28388}{28445}Ne znam.|Sve?
{28473}{28540}Ali to je tvoja odluka, Terri.
{30066}{30138}On bi hteo da to učiniš,|dušo.
{30140}{30206}Paul bi hteo da to učiniš.
{30283}{30376}- Nije trebalo da ga teram van.|- O, dušo, nije tvoja greška.
{30376}{30460}Tako mi je loše sve vreme.
{30489}{30537}Ne.
{30597}{30636}Ne mogu ovo.
{30649}{30720}Ne mogu ida idem.|Ne mogu da lažem tati.
{30721}{30791}- Jednostavno je prerano.|- Dušo...
{30801}{30904}Reći ću tati da nisi zaista bila |kod Nine kada dođe vreme za to.
{30911}{30963}I prvo će biti ljut.
{30978}{31056}Ali shvatiće da je to|bilo pravilno.
{31077}{31161}- Jesi li ti sigurna da je to pravilno?|- Ne.
{31164}{31227}Ja nisam u ništa sigurna.
{31243}{31302}Samo želim da budeš srećna.
{31515}{31548}OK.
{31566}{31626}- Učiniću to.|- OK.
{32020}{32064}Hoćete li biti OK?
{32090}{32119}- Da.|- Da. Bićemo dobro.
{32130}{32221}Vodim je na stanicu.|Nina će je pokupiti na drugom kraju.
{32222}{32320}- Bićemo u redu.|- Evo. To je za tebe.
{32407}{32422}Tata.
{32423}{32495}Ne želim da Nina sve|plati, i...
{32496}{32551}Ako hoćeš kući ranije,|samo nas nazovi, OK?
{32552}{32623}OK. Volim te.
{32674}{32704}I ja tebe.
{32779}{32834}- Nazovi me, OK?|- OK.
{33382}{33425}Želim da uzmeš ovo.
{33426}{33474}Samo nas nazovi, |kad god hoćeš.
{33475}{33528}I pobrini se da uputiš|tetu Ninu u sve,
{33529}{33636}jer znaš svog oca,|želeće da priča s njom svako malo. OK?|- Dobro mama.
{33733}{33809}- Volim te.|- Volim te.
{34626}{34683}- Ja ću. Ja ću. Ja ću.|- Hvala.
{34684}{34717}Naravno.
{34841}{34889}Gde je nestala |moja jakna?
{34940}{35011}Dobrodošla u L.A., dušo.|Uskoči.
{35012}{35048}Sada je gotovo.
{36372}{36430}O, hajde.
{36451}{36486}Halo?
{36487}{36544}Hej! Ima li koga?
{36602}{36649}O...|sigurno se šališ.
{36657}{36699}Halo!
{36788}{36831}Oprosti, puni smo.
{36834}{36877}Hej!
{37025}{37116}Gledaj. Hoćeš li ovo da pretvoriš u naviku?|OK. Kasno je i umorna sam,
{37117}{37183}i sve što želim je odmor. OK?
{37186}{37221}Koja je lozinka?
{37329}{37384}OK. Mislim da smo pogreško počeli.
{37384}{37442}- Ja sam Terri.|- Jay.
{37617}{37712}"Majmuni", usput.|Lozinka.
{37764}{37802}- Koja soba?|- Ne znam...
{37848}{37933}- 315.|- Jay. Tu si.
{37934}{38008}Pošaljem te po hranu,|a ti dovedeš lutalicu. Sramota.
{38052}{38094}Hej. Ja sam Terri.
{38137}{38187}- Vidimo se kasnije.|- Zdravo.
{38204}{38276}Znaš šta? Mislim da idem|odavde. Hvala.
{38295}{38326}Vidimo se.
{38434}{38490}- Šta?|- Šta je to sad bilo? Šta sam rekla?
{38491}{38569}- Ja sam stvarno...|- 315.
{38665}{38713}Žao mi je.|Stvarno mi je žao.
{38783}{38863}Hej. Ja sam Terri,|tvoja nova cimerka.
{38866}{38952}Super. A mislila sam da|imam ovo mesto samo za sebe.
{38953}{39037}- Sada ugasi jebeno svetlo!|- Oprosti.
{39753}{39800}O, Bože.
{39905}{39960}OK. OK.
{40270}{40314}- Terri?|- Hej. Ja sam.
{40315}{40397}O, hvala Bogu, Terri.|Tvoj tata je već dvaput zvao.
{40398}{40498}Pa, voz je kasnio, jakna mi je ukradena|i vozač taksija je bio totalni kreten.
{40499}{40583}Jesi li OK?|U redu sam. Uključimo tatu u razgovor, OK?
{40586}{40641}OK.|Evo ničega.
{40642}{40674}OK.
{40736}{40784}Hej. Jesi li tamo?
{40785}{40821}Da.|Još sam ovde.
{40821}{40883}- Theresa, jesi li to ti?|- Hej, da, tata. Ja sam.
{40884}{40914}- Je li i mama tamo?|- Da, da.
{40916}{40938}Samo je skoknula |da razmeni...
{40941}{40986}- Hej, dušo!|- Gde si tako dugo?
{40989}{41113}Čekamo da nazovete već oko četiri sata.|Oprosti, Simon. Voz joj je kasnio.
{41119}{41166}Pa...
{41167}{41245}Šta ćete vas dve raditi|svoje prve noći tamo?
{41246}{41283}- Gledamo televiziju.|- Večeramo.
{41290}{41350}- Šta? - Večeramo.|- Gledamo televiziju.
{41375}{41416}- Šta od toga?
{41417}{41504}Večeramo i gledamo pri tom|televiziju.
{41504}{41546}Dobro. Mislio sam da ti nemaš|televizor, Nina.
{41546}{41614}Mislio sam da je to protiv tvog|umetničkog senzibiliteta.
{41615}{41709}O, pa... napokon sam se predala.|Tuži me.
{41712}{41778}Aha, OK je, sve dok si na sigurnom.|Jesi li na sigurnom, dušo?
{41779}{41845}Da. U redu sam.|Samo sam totalno umorna.
{41846}{41893}Sada se odmori.|Nazovi nas sutra. I, Nina...
{41894}{41937}Da?
{41937}{41979}Nemoj pokvariti moju bebu.
{41980}{42020}Već je previše slična tebi.
{42021}{42071}Ne brini, Simon.|Tetoviraću je, prefarbati u modro,
{42075}{42144}i udati za rappera što je pre moguće.|Laku noć.
{42152}{42211}Laku noć, Nina.|'Noć, Theresa.
{42212}{42256}Laku noć, mama.|Laku noć, tata. Volim te.
{42257}{42300}Ćao-ćao.|Volim te.
{42421}{42490}Mislim da je to upalilo.|Mislim da sam uspela.
{42689}{42753}Pa, Paul, ovde sam.
{42798}{42859}Nadam se da si srećan.
{43447}{43476}Ćao.
{43517}{43593}- Ja sam Terri, tvoja cimerka.|- Da. Denise.
{43594}{43626}OK, ljudi.|Sedite.
{43626}{43665}Sedimo.
{45247}{45323}U slučaju da verujete onoj poskočici|da oni koji nisu uspeli u životu, podučavaju...
{45326}{45418}Ovi talentovani muzičari pored|mene su vaši učitelji.
{45420}{45492}Ali voleo bih da ih gledate|kao svoje vodiče.
{45493}{45570}Dobar dan, i dobrodošli u |Bristol-Hillmanov letni muzički program.
{45571}{45610}Voleo bih da započnem|podsećajući vas
{45611}{45682}na veliki broj|talentovanih učenika koji su se prijavili,
{45683}{45726}ali nisu upali.
{45727}{45758}Sada,
{45759}{45843}ovog leta ne učite samo|svoj zanat.
{45845}{45982}Radi se o testiranju vaših granica.|Eksperimentiranju. Novim iskustvima.
{45983}{46129}O građenju podloge koja će vam dati|vaš jedinstven, individualan glas.
{46131}{46165}Sada, neke osnove.
{46167}{46251}Imamo striktan policijski sat - 22:00,|23:00 vikendima.
{46252}{46344}Posedovanje ilegalnih supstanci|značiće trenutno isključenje.
{46361}{46401}Hm.|Ovo je L.A., ljudi.
{46402}{46482}Budite prisebni.|Putujte u paru.
{46483}{46539}I na kraju, školarina.
{46540}{46606}Za tri nedelje,|zadnji dan našeg programa,|imaćemo konačna izvođenja
{46607}{46696}gde ćete nam pokazati|šta ste postigli.
{46697}{46765}Srećni učenik će osvojiti 10,000|dolara akademske školarine
{46766}{46841}za muzičke studije.|To je prilično dobro, ha?
{46842}{46896}Pa, marljivo radite.
{46903}{46938}Zabavite se.
{46971}{47016}Gubite se.
{47083}{47109}Kasnije.
{47129}{47158}OK.
{47171}{47234}Dao sam joj tri prilike.|Prilike su došle i otišle.
{47235}{47322}Pošalji je natrag odakle je došla. |Nije me briga!
{47323}{47402}Ljudi, sedite.|Moje ime je g. Torvald.
{47403}{47546}Moj ste razred i imamo tri nedelje da naučimo |neverovatno kompleksan horski komad.
{47548}{47658}Znam da ovo neće uspeti,|ali pokušajmo ovo na stari način, OK?
{47659}{47722}Imamo pet solista|u ansamblu.
{47723}{47808}Samo petoro ljudi će pevati solo|ispred ovog razreda.
{47809}{47952}I ja ću ih izabrati za dve nedelje|bazirano na sudelovanju, vežbi
{47952}{47982}i "je nai sais quoi".
{47983}{48033}Ako niste Francuzi,|to znači:
{48034}{48057}"Ooo!"
{48060}{48125}Također ću vas podeliti|u grupe po četiri.
{48125}{48174}Da, još uvek brojim|na prste.
{48175}{48298}Jedna za svaki deo u nezamislivo teškoj|kontrapunktnoj harmoniji na kraju ove knjige.
{48299}{48428}Ovaj komad će vas izludeti.|Ali kada ga svladate, osećaj je dobar.
{48429}{48465}Ti.
{48467}{48492}Ti. Ti.
{48493}{48559}Ti. Prva grupa!
{48994}{49030}Hej, Jay!|Lepa svirka.
{49035}{49080}Skoči gore i pridruži se.
{49852}{49901}Hej.|Sedi li iko ovde?
{51145}{51203}Koliko vas može identifikovati|ovu notu?
{51283}{51345}Ti, tamo.|Koja je ovo nota?
{51468}{51534}- "B"?|- B sniženo!
{51535}{51632}Mogućnost da prepoznate notu|kada je čujete je velika prednost.
{51633}{51717}Oni koji to ne mogu,|moraju se jače potruditi.
{51719}{51806}Isto vredi za vašu mogućnost|čitanja muzike.
{51807}{51886}Vaše prilike su proširene.|Kada pogledate muzičko delo,
{51887}{51938}vidite kako su note posložene|na stranici,
{51938}{52046}i čujete tačno šta je to,|svaka vam je nota u glavi.
{52050}{52170}To ćete naučiti ovog leta,|na individualnim studijama sa mnom.
{52375}{52435}Oprosti. Ja sam kriv.|Jesi li OK?
{52437}{52500}Da, ja... u redu sam.|Žao mi je. To je bila moja greška. Bila sam na putu.
{52501}{52558}- Ne, u redu je. Moja greška.|Stvarno bi trebalo da naučim stajati.
{52559}{52607}- OK.
{52772}{52804}Super.
{53051}{53098}Ona ni ne zna.
{53228}{53284}- Hej. Kako ide?|- Moglo bi i bolje.
{53489}{53526}Da zatražim solo sobu?
{53528}{53607}- Smetam li ti ja toliko?|- Hej. Čekaj.
{53608}{53679}Mislim, imam osećaj da sam|ti velika bol u guzici.
{53682}{53727}Gledaj, nije uopšte tako, OK?
{53727}{53768}Ovde sam zbog školarine.
{53772}{53875}- Ja sam samo zbog žarišta hardcorea.|- Pa, to se izgleda stvarno lično.
{53878}{53941}O, molim te.|Ne pokušavam to da čujem.
{53957}{54016}Gledaj, svi smo protivnici,|zbog tog novca.
{54017}{54138}Pa, ja samo moram da znam da radim svoju stvar|i ne budem ulovljena s nečim ličnim.
{54174}{54228}Ne mislim ništa s tim.
{54250}{54309}Pa, jesmo li cool?
{54346}{54425}- Da. Cool smo.|- Cool.
{54594}{54658}- Hej, g. Torvald.|- Hej, Robin.
{54661}{54719}Htela sam vam dati do znanja da sam probala|one vežbe koje ste mi dali prošlog leta,
{54722}{54825}i stvarno su mi pomogle.|Samo sam htela da vam se zahvalim.
{54829}{54854}Bilo mi je zadovoljstvo.
{54855}{54912}O, i moram vam reći da se takmičim|za one soliste.
{54912}{55019}- Pa, obratiću pažnju na tebe.|- Hvala vam, g. Torvald.
{55462}{55535}Au, i rez.
{55536}{55593}- Oprostite, to sam bila ja.|- Da, znamo.
{55593}{55659}- A ti si?|- Terri Fletcher.
{55670}{55743}Mislio sam da sam te prepoznao.|Cura s DVD-a.
{55744}{55832}Terri Fletcher, stvar je u tome|da tema izađe iz harmonije.
{55832}{55851}Daj mi ruku.
{55876}{55972}Neka niko to ne sledi direktno.|Razumete?
{55982}{56018}Bravo, Robin.
{56027}{56074}OK, ponovićemo to.
{56836}{56895}Oprostite, g. Wesson.|Ja sam... Zaboravila sam svoje knjige u...
{56896}{56996}Tvoje je vreme potrošeno.|Molim te, idi do postolja.
{57117}{57186}Molim vas, pogledajte prvu stranicu.
{57490}{57519}Poduprite.
{57520}{57574}Poduprite svoju dijafragmu.
{57801}{57906}Vazduh ulazi. Dijafragma izlazi van.|OK je kad izgleda debelo.
{58882}{58932}Oprostite.
{59472}{59528}- Hej.|- Što ima?
{60294}{60338}Hvala svejedno.
{61379}{61432}Ozbiljno si luda. Znaš to?
{61435}{61485}Nije sreća, osim ako |ne gleda prema gore.
{61489}{61558}Ali to je sada samo novčić|koji misli da je srećan, a nije.
{61567}{61629}Pa, sada može biti srećan|za nekog drugog.
{61640}{61713}Osim toga, jesi li ikad čuo da|smo sami kovači svoje sreće?
{61791}{61862}Pa, šta ti znaš?|Srećni novčić.
{62120}{62164}Dakle, Englez u L.A-u.
{62166}{62266}Da, moji matorci su stavili okean|između sebe nakon najgoreg razvoda.
{62270}{62324}Bez šale, ljudi to proučavaju.
{62357}{62457}Pa, kako možeš da imaš smisla|za humor?
{62459}{62495}Muzika mi je postala kao religija.|Zadržala me je prisebnim.
{62555}{62614}Znači, muzika je tvoja snaga.
{62619}{62682}Prilično.|Mislim, pogledaj ovo.
{62685}{62743}Ovaj grad.|Sve ove ljude.
{62742}{62789}Ceo ovaj život i muziku.
{62804}{62853}Ja ću praviti muziku za njih.
{62863}{62916}Ne mogu da smislim ni jedan|bolji način da se potroši život.
{63037}{63121}- Nedostaje li ti dom?|- Malo.
{63140}{63206}Ne znam. Ali stvarno je teško|u zadnje vreme.
{63208}{63235}Hajde.
{63238}{63320}Upravo sam ti dao ekskluzivno svoju|"Istinitu Hollywoodsku Priču".
{63321}{63361}Moraš mi nešto dati.
{63414}{63523}Ja i moj brat imali smo automobilsku |nesreću na dan njegove mature.
{63551}{63620}Neki pijanac je prošao kroz|crveno svetlo i...
{63621}{63712}- Hej, Terri! Dođi ovamo.|- Gledaj, Terri, moram da idem.
{63717}{63755}Moram se naći s nekim.
{63760}{63811}Pozdravi Denise za mene.
{63906}{63966}- Hej.|- Hej, je li to Jay trčao?
{63967}{64031}- Da.|- Šta, je li ti se nabacivao?
{64032}{64065}Nisam primetila.
{64067}{64125}Pa, izreci svoje molitve,|jer ja znam njegovu igru.
{64126}{64163}Voli da se nabacuje lepim|curicama.
{64166}{64236}I dušo, ti...|ti nisi jedna od njih.
{64236}{64290}- Šta?|- Mislim, pogledaj se.
{64291}{64355}Pogledaj svoju kosu, odeću,|kako hodaš.
{64356}{64414}Ti si nekakva retro Brady Buncher.
{64415}{64473}Ni ne trudim se da čujem to.
{64515}{64570}OK, to je bilo slatko.|Moja greška.
{64646}{64691}Nisam znala da to možeš.
{64693}{64749}Da. Moj učitelj uvek govori|kako je to loše za mene.
{64750}{64834}Znaš, izgubiću uvo.|Ali jednostavno volim kako zvuči ovde.
{65597}{65655}- Bok.|- O, bok, dušo.
{65656}{65703}Tata hoće da priča s tobom.
{65704}{65766}Simon, podigni.
{65790}{65878}Hej, dušo.|Kako je? Držiš se tamo?
{65880}{65959}- Da, sve je dobro.|- Nedostaješ mi, naravno.
{65960}{66003}I ti meni, tata.
{66069}{66159}- Šta je to bilo? Zvučalo je kao sirena.|- O, ne. Nije to ništa.
{66160}{66221}Pa, nije zvučalo kao ništa.|Zvučalo je prilično blizu.
{66265}{66334}Susedi su otišli iz grada i|alarm i se stalno ukljujučuje,
{66335}{66363}pa, popričaću s policijom, OK?
{66364}{66434}- Nazvaću te kasnije. U redu, zdravo.|- OK, zdravo, dušo.
{66435}{66478}O, šta? Terri, čekaj.
{66489}{66525}Terri?
{66587}{66626}Izgubiću.
{66867}{66900}Da.
{67100}{67181}Nikada ne mogu pogoditi tu notu.|Ne mogu da verujem.
{67182}{67219}Ja mogu.
{67255}{67287}Problem, dame?
{67288}{67402}- Da, mislim da neki od nas moraju vežbati|ovo malo više van razreda.  - Mijau!
{67415}{67469}-Zašto ne prepustiš meni|brigu oko toga, ha?
{67479}{67533}OK, to je to.|Gotovi smo za danas.
{67534}{67579}Hajde.|Brišite odavde.
{67593}{67652}Gđice Fletcher.
{67730}{67765}OK, predajem se.
{67766}{67827}Šta si učinila s|curom na DVD-u?
{67842}{67868}Oprostite?
{67869}{67942}Živahna, zabavna, talentovana cura,|šta si joj učinila?
{67957}{68057}Nemam pojma o čemu pričate.|Šaljem svoje pesme na CD-ovima.
{68063}{68130}Ne, bio je i DVD.
{68133}{68244}Došao je kasno. Skoro ga nismo videli.|Ali on je veliki deo razloga zašto si ovde.
{68244}{68354}- Sedi. Opusti se.|- OK, g. Torvald. Nisam ga poslala.
{68355}{68395}Stvarno nemam pojma o čemu pričate.
{68396}{68434}Ne? Pa...
{68435}{68521}Da te upoznam s jednom|zanimljivom, fascinantom damom.
{68522}{68611}Možda ćeš biti inspirisana.|Znam da smo mi bili.
{68738}{68843}Terri je moja sestra. I ona je moja|najbolja osoba na celom svetu.
{68843}{68918}Voli izazove.|Uspeva pod pritiskom.
{68919}{69017}A ljudi koji to mogu|ne žive u Flagstaffu.
{69018}{69070}Terri zaslužuje šansu|da uči od najboljih.
{69071}{69110}Već je dobra.
{69116}{69162}Ali mogla bi da bude izvrsna.
{69629}{69691}Ako je primite,|nećete se razočarati.
{69951}{69992}Hej, Terri?
{70016}{70042}Terri!
{70185}{70249}Terri.|Jesi li OK?
{70260}{70322}Molim te. Možda je to samo neka|čudna stvar s neuklapanjem.
{70779}{70811}Ne.
{71073}{71141}Show je gotov.|OK, možeš ići sada.
{71160}{71223}Gledaj, šta god to bilo,|ne možeš otići.
{71265}{71373}- To je jadno.|- Šta ti radiš ovde?
{71377}{71422}Isto što i svi drugi.
{71427}{71503}Muzika.|Letnji posao.
{71513}{71562}Mislim, ovde, na mojim vratima.
{71565}{71634}Gledaj, hajde.|Idemo odavde.
{71653}{71699}Hajde.|Idemo.
{71712}{71774}Torba ne odlazi.
{71788}{71840}Kako da znam da ti nećeš?
{72018}{72070}Sedela sam tačno|pored njega.
{72071}{72133}On je umro, a ja nisam.|Znaš?
{72163}{72213}A ne znam zašto.
{72223}{72279}Ali fali mi.
{72297}{72382}Čim sam počela da osećam|da se zabavljam,
{72383}{72444}taj glas mi je ušao u glavu, i...
{72454}{72560}kao: "Kako se možeš zabavljati|kad je Paul mrtav?"
{72575}{72631}Ne možeš sebe kriviti tako.
{72672}{72716}Ne razumeš.
{72726}{72772}Bila je moja greška.
{72776}{72820}Ja sam ga naterala da se iskrade.
{72857}{72898}Nije trebalo da rizikujem.
{72899}{72968}Gledaj, Terri.|Neki idiot je prešao preko crvenog.
{72987}{73031}Bila je to loša sreća.
{73040}{73093}Loše vreme.
{73122}{73155}To je sve.
{73177}{73214}Nisi bio tamo.
{73269}{73359}Gledaj, ne mogu da zamislim|kroz šta prolaziš.
{73379}{73485}Ali znam iz iskustva da odustajanje|može postati deo tvog života.
{73505}{73543}Ne odlazi.
{73546}{73649}Zajebi pritisak. Zajebi školarinu.|Mislim, radi svoju stvar.
{73649}{73728}Po vlastitim uslovima.|I uzmi ono po šta si došla.
{73733}{73806}- To je važno.|- Ali Jay, ja lažem ljude.
{73807}{73850}Mislim, trebalo je da lažem|da bi došla ovamo.
{73850}{73963}Pa šta? Tu si.|Nije ni trebalo da bude lako.
{73975}{74040}Tu si jer si učinila ono|što si morala.
{74078}{74121}Zašto ti je toliko stalo?
{74150}{74181}Ne znam.
{74347}{74387}Sviđaš mi se.
{74440}{74507}I Robin se uklapa|u to, kako?
{74534}{74632}Upoznali smo se ovde lani.|Nešto smo imali nakratko.
{74649}{74690}To je sada gotovo.
{74709}{74742}Zna li ona to?
{74773}{74903}Da, pa... neki ljudi se drže za|ono što bi trebalo da puste.
{75493}{75519}Hvala.
{75519}{75572}OK, ne radim ovo da bih vas|mučio, ljudi.
{75579}{75665}Samo pomislite na ovo kao|na međutermin.
{75668}{75709}Gđice Fletcher? Molim vas?
{76562}{76616}To je bilo super.
{76680}{76773}U redu, počni od početka četvrti.|- Super. - Pričao sam Terri. Bing!
{76785}{76903}OK, idemo treći deo od početka.|Jesu li svi spremni?
{77178}{77219}Hej.
{77265}{77396}- Šta je ovo? - Možda Giordanni nije|za nas. Da probamo nešto drugo, ha?
{77449}{77516}Znate, cenim pomisao, g. Wesson,
{77519}{77582}ali, znate, volela bih se zadržati|na ovome.
{77591}{77677}Bolje mi je danas i želim da vidim|mogu li izdržati.
{77871}{77910}Hvala.
{79257}{79293}- Šta radiš ovde?|- O...
{79303}{79410}samo... vrata su bila otvorena.|Čula sam kako sviraš.
{79470}{79614}- O, nemoj prestati.|- Ne, OK je. Ionako sam završavao.
{79708}{79746}Terri, čekaj.
{79784}{79883}Žao mi je, samo sam...|malo je čudno kada pišem.
{79904}{80007}- Zašto?  - Pa...|To su samo moje reči. Ustvari je hromo.
{80010}{80095}Mislim, kada ih pevam.|A želim da znače puno više, ali...
{80101}{80166}Pa, pišem pesme još od etinjstva. |Ali moji aranžmani
{80166}{80283}zvuče kao neki crtić subotom|ujutro ili nešto.
{80319}{80353}- Odsviraj mi nešto.|- O, hm...
{80386}{80416}- Nije još spremno.
{80417}{80523}- Hajde, šta se dogodilo onome...|"Moraš terati svoju stvar, pod svojim uslovima"
{80526}{80573}smeću koji si mi prodavao neki dan?
{80578}{80607}Hajde.
{80640}{80672}OK.
{81317}{81336}OK, čekaj.
{81386}{81482}Jako mi se sviđa muzika. - Da?|- OK? Ali šta s ovim?
{81535}{81602}- Da, sviđa mi se to. - OK?|Jako je cool.
{81760}{81850}O, proleće, kada se mladić|okreće ljubavi.
{81850}{81937}- Jeste li videli, ljudi? - Šta?|Čudno, jer imam rupu u prsima
{81940}{82044}gde mi je nekad bilo srce,|jer ga je jedna osoba izbacila. 
{82047}{82121}A nije joj ni prokleto stalo|za ono što je učinila.
{82124}{82174}Pričaš li o curi u crnom|puloveru?
{82178}{82213}Čoveče, ona je najbolji komad ovde.
{82213}{82331}- Čula sam je na probama i besprekorna je.|- Pa, gledala me
{82347}{82391}i ja sam jednostavno...
{82441}{82508}- O, čoveče.|- Čoveče, ti si zaljubljen.
{82511}{82575}- Beznadežno.|- Jesi li ikada uopšte pričao s njom?
{82575}{82680}- Ne, radim na tome. Problem|je što mi neće dati vremena.
{82684}{82731}Pa, da vas upoznam?
{82750}{82809}Šta ako ti kažem da si najbolja|cura koju sam znao ikada?
{82809}{82851}Jay, sviđa mi se ova cura.|Znaš kako da ih izabereš.
{82851}{82939}- Uvek sam ti to govorio, zar ne, Jay?|- Da, uvek je to govorio.
{82944}{82988}Kiwijev pečat pristanka.
{83283}{83309}Zdravo.
{83328}{83441}Hej, ja sam Terri.|Oprosti na gnjavaži.
{83510}{83549}Tvoje ime?
{83563}{83597}Sloane.
{83623}{83681}Ja... znam da ne slušamo|časove skupa...
{83681}{83767}ali samo sam mislila da se predstavim.
{83787}{83824}OK.
{83887}{84011}OK, postoji jedan tip.|I jako je dobar, i zove se Kiwi.
{84015}{84100}I nekako je... zaljubljen u tebe.|Pa nas je zanimalo
{84108}{84160}ako hoćeš da se družiš s nama|u subotu uveče?
{84163}{84198}Kiwi je čudno ime.
{84237}{84345}Zašto bi se on zaljubio u mene?|To je glupo.
{84385}{84457}Mislim, ponekad ne možeš|ništa protiv toga.
{84472}{84541}Pa, kako god, nalazimo se u|predvorju u 19:00
{84580}{84637}i idemo nešto da pojedemo, OK?
{84692}{84793}- Valjda.|- Super.
{84954}{84994}OK.
{85011}{85050}Stvarno dobro.
{85222}{85316}To je malo čudan način govora.|OK, ti misliš i govoriš šta misliš.
{85354}{85436}Prekrasna mala petunijo.|Ti... aah...
{85443}{85496}- A, sacre bleu!|- Imam te, čoveče.
{85505}{85643}OK, curo. Pričaj mi. Ti i Jay|ste sada...? - Da, na neki način.
{85644}{85718}- Mislim, on je stvarno cool.|- A šta je s Robin, gđica Stvar?
{85726}{85790}- Kaže da je među njima gotovo.|- Da, baš.
{85802}{85870}- To je stvarno slatko.|- O, sviđa ti se?
{85865}{85941}Da. Moja mama ima slatki|dućančić s odećom.
{85932}{86001}- Stvarno ima ukusa.|- Stvarno?
{86004}{86039}Samo bih htela da posao|ide bolje, znaš?
{86042}{86102}Čak i kada ja pomažem,
{86103}{86160}radeći što znam, |nastupajući na ulici,
{86160}{86215}još nam je teško da skrpimo |kraj s krajem za školarinu.
{86219}{86279}Mislim, zašto mislim da idem|po tu školarinu?
{86335}{86397}Hej, dođi malo ovde.|Želim da vidim kako ovo izgleda.
{86407}{86448}- Stvarno?|- Da, hajde.
{86481}{86514}Prisilila si me.
{86522}{86554}- O, da, to je sveže.
{86567}{86608}- O, izgledam li kao da idem na zabavu?
{86824}{86892}Frances, otišao sam u Ninas da vidim Terri.|Nazovi me. Simon.
{86893}{86932}O, moj Bože.
{87064}{87171}- Hej, teta Nina. - Terri, hvala Bogu da sam te našla!|Tvoj tata je zvao, ja sam učinila svoju stvar.
{87172}{87233}Mislim da nešto sumnja.|Ne znam kako ni zašto.
{87235}{87313}Ali tvoja majka je zvala i rekla|da je na putu ovamo!
{87317}{87393}Zadržaću ga kako mogu, ali|postoji li način da dođeš?
{87393}{87460}O, moj Bože. Mrtvi smo.
{87488}{87521}Ja sam mrtva.
{87562}{87593}Hej, Jay!
{87900}{87979}- OK, hvala. - Sretno, Terri.|Vidimo se sutra naveče, može?
{88025}{88114}Voz za pustinju na|platformi 12.
{88425}{88497}Uzimamo mali odmor|od temperature +100 °C
{88497}{88603}ovde, na području Palm Springsa.|Vetar je severni i duva 6 milja na sat.
{89523}{89615}- Hej.|- Hej, Nina. Gde je ona?
{89631}{89659}Pa...
{89667}{89742}želim o nečemu s tobom |da pričam, Simon.
{89743}{89775}- O, da.|- Da...
{89808}{89847}Tatice!
{89931}{90033}- Nedostajao si mi.|- O, i ti meni.
{90135}{90171}Treba mi piće.
{90297}{90319}Oprosti.
{90379}{90441}Ne dolaze, čoveče. Kažem ti.|Neće se pojaviti.
{90442}{90513}- Nema šanse. Gledaj, žene uvek|kasne zbog izgleda. Biće ovde.
{90517}{90544}- OK.
{90605}{90670}- Čoveče. - Hvala.|Ne, ne, ne, čoveče.
{90763}{90792}Kvragu.
{90792}{90864}Ne, ne, čekaj, čekaj, čekaj!|Ne idi.
{90893}{90962}Hej, ljudi,|oprostite što kasnim.
{90990}{91036}Hej, Sloane,|super izgledaš.
{91039}{91111}Da.|Hajde, idemo.
{91144}{91229}Mislim da bi trebao... cool.|Ne, ozbiljno.
{91232}{91281}Morala sam da se pravim pred|tatom da sam tamo
{91281}{91358}svo vreme, a u međuvremenu je|moja teta renovirala kuću,
{91358}{91458}pa kada sam otišla u kupatilo,|ušla sam u ormar. - Nema šanse. - Ima.
{91463}{91517}Da, znaš, svi smo mislili |da si neka
{91518}{91597}uzorna devojčica, ali ti si,|kao, begunac pred zakonom.
{91619}{91706}Govoreći o tome, pobeguljo,|gde nas vodiš? - Videćete.
{92088}{92139}- Dobra je.|- I više, čoveče.
{92206}{92242}Ovu, može?
{92719}{92787}Hajde, ljudi. Hajde.
{92799}{92850}- Ne, ne, ne.
{94590}{94649}Volim ponekad da dolazim|ovde da razmišljam.
{94666}{94709}Ovo je stvarno cool.
{94748}{94799}Volim da budem ovde.
{94802}{94844}Da bar ja imamo ovakvo mesto za razmišljanje.
{94846}{94948}Pa, odigraj dobro karte,|možda ga podelim s tobom.
{94956}{95004}- Možda?|- Možda.
{95031}{95088}Zavisi o čemu bi dolazio da razmišljaš|ovde gore.
{95119}{95154}O raznim stvarima.
{95203}{95316}Mojim snovima. Muzici. Budućnosti.
{95328}{95369}Da je imam.
{95574}{95605}Hajde.
{96040}{96076}Prebrzo?
{96081}{96124}Nisam spremna.
{96155}{96182}Pa... cool.
{96210}{96287}Mislim, sviđaš mi se. Jako.
{96302}{96376}Da, i ti se meni sviđaš.
{96489}{96563}Razmišljao sam o onoj pesmi |od pre neki dan.
{96593}{96660}Mislim da bi je trebalo izvesti|na konačnom izvođenju.
{96668}{96768}Ti pevaš. Ja sviram.|Možemo da podelimo školarinu
{96771}{96841}i mogli bi napisati nešto|stvarno značajno.
{96879}{96934}- OK?|- Dogovoreno.
{97006}{97071}Želiš li da probaš opet?
{97095}{97124}Šta?
{98699}{98778}- Idemo, idemo!|- Hej, noć otvorenih mikrofona je, ljudi.
{99009}{99034}Grda ekipa.
{99064}{99152}Pričaj mi o tome. Videću možemo|li doći na listu za izvođenje.
{99155}{99244}- Što? Jay, ne.|- Hej, gle, možemo vježbati zauvijek, 
{99245}{99295}ali pre ili kasnije ćemo|to morati da učinimo.
{99310}{99361}Idemo odavde.
{99458}{99541}U redu, u redu.|Stanley Wilson, dame i gospodo.
{99543}{99611}Zapljeskajmo Stanleyu Wilsonu.
{99611}{99635}- Zašto si ovde?!|- Sranje si, čoveče!
{99635}{99659}Dobro obavljeno.
{99702}{99792}- Tako sam nervozna.|- Pa, samo... zamisli publiku golu.
{99824}{99874}-OK, loša ideja.|-U redu, sledeće
{99879}{99958}imamo Terri i Jaya.|Ovo im je prvi put u Blue Moonu,
{99959}{100044}pa ih toplo pozdravimo.|Terri i Jay, ljudi.
{100483}{100552}- Daj da počnem ponovno.|- Hajde, pevaj nešto!
{100660}{100700}Hej, okreni se.
{100761}{100804}Gledaj, OK je.|Okreni se.
{100873}{100899}Oprostite.
{101396}{101420}Paul!
{101605}{101651}Terri! Terri!
{101654}{101810}Terri, čekaj! - Jesi li OK?|- Dobro sam. Videla sam...
{101842}{101883}Jednostavno nisam bila spremna.
{101929}{102008}Ja... mislio sam da pričekam.|Ali...
{102044}{102077}ovo je za tebe.
{102097}{102130}Paulov križ.
{103358}{103461}Dobro. Lepo.|Popravlja se.
{103463}{103535}Ostalo nam je 10 minuta.|Želim da prođem treći deo. 
{103536}{103563}Je li iko video Terri?
{103566}{103638}Ja mogu njen deo, g. Torvald, znam|ga napamet.
{103639}{103737}To je Terrin solo, neka nju čeka.|-Ali ona nije ovde.
{103737}{103779}I ionako to ne može da peva.
{103786}{103902}Terri se trudila za to. Zaslužuje to.|-Ne, ja zaslužujem taj deo!
{103902}{103962}Prekinite. Isuse.
{104097}{104144}Pa, izgleda da imate novu|miljenicu sada!
{104357}{104389}Šta nije u redu?
{104485}{104520}Ne razumijem.
{104535}{104635}Ja ne... ne kapiram kako stvari mogu|postati od tako dobrih,
{104636}{104683}jedno leto loše, drugog leta...
{104784}{104871}- Žao mi je, Robin.|- Možemo li da pričamo?
{104914}{104964}Mislim, nasamo?
{105077}{105165}Hej, g. Torvald.|Žao mi je što nisam bila na času.
{105189}{105273}Pa, OK je.|Je li ti bolje?
{105293}{105413}- Šta? - Ako si propustila čas,|sigurno si bila smrtno bolesna.
{105416}{105481}Šteta, jer je trebalo da radimo|na tvojoj solo deonici danas.
{105566}{105638}- Nisam spremna za solo.|- Da, jesi.
{105641}{105713}Zar ne znaš koliko si se|popravila otkad si došla ovde?
{105714}{105778}OK, ali ima boljih pevača|ovde, g. Torvald.
{105778}{105812}Ja ću to prosuditi.
{105818}{105862}Počećemo sutra.
{105875}{105973}Gledaj, Terri, neki ljudi u|ovom razredu očajnički žele taj solo,
{105973}{106107}pa ako ti nije stalo do posla,|šta radiš ovde?
{106194}{106266}Ovo je tako ponižavajuće.|Trebalo je da budeš sa mnom.
{106268}{106340}Gledaj...|polako.
{106436}{106566}- I gore stvari su se događale, u redu?|- Da, svo vreme. Ali ne meni.
{106582}{106626}Ja uvek dobijem šta želim.
{106719}{106810}- Je li to loše reći?|- Pa, možda malo, da.
{106861}{106904}Ali mislila sam da voliš loše.
{106928}{106971}Možda malo lošeg?
{106995}{107024}Hajde,
{107025}{107111}dobro smo se slagali lani, zar ne?|- Ljudi se menjaju, Robin.
{107115}{107182}Nisam ista osoba kao lani.
{107183}{107294}- Nisi ni ti. - Ne znam. Mislim da|možemo ponovno da budemo to dvoje ljudi.
{107311}{107345}A ti?
{107501}{107592}- Hej, jesi li videla Jaya?|- U sobi za probu, mislim.
{107637}{107695}Mislim da znam problem.
{107762}{107810}Loša sam.
{107836}{107875}Ali mogu biti bolja.
{108136}{108186}Terri, čekaj!|Terri!
{108230}{108256}Terri!
{108263}{108318}Terri, čekaj!
{108325}{108376}- Čekaj.|- Kretenu!
{108400}{108515}- Terri! - Jay?|- Miči se od mene! Terri!
{108803}{108839}Glupača.
{110124}{110176}- Terri, hajde, molim te.|- Ne želim da pričam s tobom.
{110184}{110212}Samo odbij.
{111481}{111545}Hej, jesi li OK?
{111560}{111598}Nije to ništa.
{111622}{111728}Žao mi je što sam bio zloban|prema tebi onog dana.
{111734}{111840}Samo želim da znaš da sam tu za tebe ako|šta trebaš. Ako želiš da pričaš. Bilo šta.
{111862}{111891}OK?
{112035}{112085}Jesi li ikada izgubio nekoga?
{112104}{112130}Da.
{112178}{112303}- Ja jednostavno ne mogu to da pustim.|- Pa, ti si umetnica,
{112303}{112389}a oni osećaju stvari drukčije|od običnih ljudi.
{112397}{112497}Pogledaj Patsy Cline, ili Billie Holiday.
{112497}{112622}Čuješ im to u glasu. Ili|Vincent van Gogh. Odrezao je sebi uvo,
{112627}{112723}ali hej, znao je da slika.|- Vincent van Gogh se ubio.
{112726}{112797}Tačno.|Loš primer.
{112809}{112893}Hej, ja sam učitelj muzike, ne psihić.|Šta hoćeš?
{112938}{113082}Pretpostavljam...|hoću reći, umetnici prenose emocije.
{113086}{113193}Daju publici da oseti|ono što oni osećaju.
{113196}{113243}Znači, o tome se radi, u redu?
{113265}{113412}Samo moraš naći način da uzmeš ono što |je ovde i staviš to ovde.
{113634}{113754}- Ko je? -Jay. Pusti me!|- Gubi se, glupane!
{113754}{113826}- Ne, ne, ne!|Molim te, moram da pričam sa Terri, OK?
{113826}{113905}- Samo me pusti.|- Zvuči pijano.
{113907}{114017}Misliš? Hej, curo,|ne otvaraj ta vrata.
{114017}{114070}OK, nateraću ga da ode, OK?
{114085}{114155}Jay, moraš otići. Odmah.
{114159}{114183}- Ne!|- Au!
{114197}{114255}To jako boli.
{114317}{114358}- Ššš.|- Ne, nije ono što misliš.
{114358}{114386}Šta se događa!?
{114379}{114441}- Videla sam te kako je ljubiš, OK?|- Ne. - Začepi!
{114460}{114488}Ti začepi!
{114492}{114526}- Hajde, Terri.|- Pokušavam da zaspim.
{114533}{114615}Nisam je ljubio.|Ona je ljubila mene.
{114618}{114679}O, ne. Nije ni pokušao|da ode tamo.
{114680}{114741}Sigurna sam da tu ima puno smisla, Jay,|kada si pijan.
{114742}{114850}- Terri, nije mi stalo do nje.|- Stalo mi je do tebe.
{114850}{114939}- Čoveče, koga misliš da varaš? Terri?|- Denise, smiri se, u redu?
{114942}{115100}Gledaj, Terri, stalo mi je do tebe.|Znaš to.
{115103}{115187}Zašto bi ti to učinio?|Zašto bi pio?
{115257}{115374}Zato što... |sam bezvredan.
{115374}{115416}Znaš šta? Ni ne pokušavaj da mi prodaješ|tu priču sa samosažaljevanjem, u redu?
{115418}{115473}Terri, gledaj.|Svi se morate relocirati.
{115477}{115536}OK, pa, nikad ga neću pustiti|pored noćne straže...
{115540}{115602}- Biću u redu. Samo ću...|- Moraš...
{115607}{115694}- Moraš mi pomoći da ga prenesem do krova.|- Ovo je previše drame za mene.
{115700}{115777}- Ššš. - U redu sam.|- Nisi u redu, OK?
{115799}{115914}O, vau! Volim ovaj krov!|Tako je cool.
{115962}{116010}O, zadah mu je užasan.
{116041}{116079}O, vrti mi se.
{116096}{116127}Pomozi mu!
{116167}{116189}O, moj Bože.
{116202}{116223}Ja izlazim iz ovoga.
{116247}{116276}Hvala.
{116305}{116401}- Šta si učinila?|- Nije mi dobro. - Sigurna sam u to.
{117093}{117120}Probudi se, novi je dan.
{117621}{117669}Stvarno mi je žao.
{117671}{117748}Zadrži to za sebe.|Nije ti još oprošteno.
{117755}{117784}Hajde, idemo.
{118132}{118201}Frances!|Kod tebe su ključevi od auta?
{118225}{118254}Frances?
{118268}{118316}Ključevi od auta?
{118714}{118817}Frances? -Napisala sam neke nove reči|i sada moramo samo vežbati,
{118822}{118887}tako da razvalimo tu stvar.|- U redu.
{118990}{119028}Evo muzike.
{119064}{119140}OK, počnimo ovde.
{119141}{119179}- Želim da poradim na predrefrenu.|- OK.
{119640}{119727}To nije... Hajdemo ponovo|i sada probaj malo brže.
{119740}{119761}- OK.|- OK.
{119887}{119923}Stani.
{119940}{119990}OK. Sada ozbiljno. Hajde.
{120184}{120235}Zvučalo je dobro prvi put.
{120235}{120299}OK, ali "dobro" nam neće |pribaviti školarinu.
{120308}{120383}OK, mora biti ispravno. |I ja se ne predajem dok ne uspem.
{120383}{120433}To će me izludeti.
{120755}{120846}- Šta? Šta si učinila?|- Primljena je, Simon.
{120853}{120927}Od svih prijavnica u Americi,|naša Terri je upala.
{120951}{121059}Misliš, bila je tamo sve ovo vreme?|- Jesi li me čuo?
{121059}{121107}- Vi... lagali ste mi? - Ti i Nina?|- Jesi li čuo? Naša kćer...
{121107}{121162}je upala u najbolju muzičku|školu u državi.
{121162}{121239}Svi ste me lagali.|Svi.
{121317}{121469}Ali, Terri je želela da ide.|Paul je želeo da ide. Paul!
{121503}{121577}Terri opet peva.|Zašto ti to nije važno?
{121579}{121664}Šta, za ime Boga,|nije u redu s tobom, Frances?
{121668}{121723}Šta nije u redu sa mnom?
{121738}{121865}Nedavno smo izgubili sina.|Gubili smo jedino dete koje nam je ostalo.
{121870}{122006}Neću da dopustim da se to dogodi.|To je moja poenta. 
{122006}{122123}Ona je samo dete. Ona je naše dete.|I kako da je ja zaštitim ako nije ovde?
{122148}{122191}Želim je ovde.
{122209}{122248}Želim je ovde odmah.
{123421}{123502}Hoćeš li začepiti?!
{123512}{123613}Ti si najglasniji, najbučniji, |najbezobrazniji kreten na planeti!
{124710}{124734}- O, au!|- Oprosti.
{125394}{125428}Hvala.
{125442}{125560}Hvala i dobrodošli. Pa, vreme|je da privedemo stvar završnici.
{125563}{125635}Bilo je zabavno, i imamo|još i više toga za vas.
{125638}{125746}Danas imamo pregršt|konačnih izveđenja.
{125746}{125857}I neki naši izvođači biće praćeni|članovima Bristol-Hillman House Banda.
{125876}{125953}O, moj Bože! - Šta?|- Nemam Paulovu ogrlicu.
{125972}{126079}Ne, ne mogu učiniti ovo bez njega. |- Terri? Terri, čekaj.
{126082}{126149}Ne... ne brini. Vratiću se.
{126149}{126212}Zapljeskajte sada prvom izvođaču,|gospođici Robin Childers.
{126766}{126792}Tata?
{126804}{126861}- Spakuj se, Terri. - Idemo kući.|- Tata, ne!
{126864}{126958}Bez reči, Theresa. Samo to učini.|Majka te čeka dole.
{127264}{127312}Napred, Robin!
{127408}{127437}Hvala vam.
{127447}{127552}Sjajno!|Naš sledeći izvođač je g. Engelbert Wilson.
{127555}{127588}Engelbert?
{127588}{127636}Izađi, dečko!
{127718}{127774}Jesi li čula šta sam rekao?|Spakuj se.
{127789}{127867}Tata, znaš šta? Učinio si ovo Paulu,|i nećeš to učiniti i meni.
{127869}{127966}- Kako se usuđuješ mešati Paula u ovo.|- OK, pa, neću ti dopustiti da me gušiš.
{127967}{128079}- Lagala si me, Terri.|- I žao mi je. Ali učinila sam šta sam morala.
{128083}{128189}OK, ti ne slušaš nikoga,|a svi te se bojimo.
{129041}{129251}Tata... ovo mesto je daleko najbolja|stvar koja mi se ikada dogodila,
{129252}{129288}bez obzira na to kako sam|dospela ovde.
{129307}{129349}Raspravljaćemo o tome kod kuće.
{129747}{129805}Ne idem.
{129828}{129910}Učinila sam ovo za sebe|i završiću to za sebe.
{129949}{130009}Možeš me odvesti kući |ako hoćeš, tata.
{130029}{130100}Ali nastupam za koji trenutuak,
{130100}{130208}i puno bi mi značilo da me|ti i mama podržite.
{130228}{130316}Tako sam naporno radila ovde.|I stvarno sam dobra.
{130332}{130431}Želim da me čujete.|Molim te, tata.
{130441}{130498}Molim te, dopusti mi da ostanem.
{131499}{131601}- U redu, Denise!|- Da!
{131622}{131683}Da, to je bilo|predivno, Denise.
{131820}{131935}A sada zadnji, ali nimalo lošiji,|Theresa Fletcher i Jay Corgan.
{132251}{132324}Dame i gospodo,|žao mi je što moram objaviti...
{133107}{133203}Dame i gospodo, istinsko mi je zadovoljstvo|predstaviti vam ovaj poseban vokalni dar,
{133205}{133311}jedne jedine -|Terri Fletcher!
{133579}{133670}Ovu smo pesmu Jay i ja zajedno napisali,|i posvetila bih je...
{133670}{133743}svom bratu,|Paulu Fletcheru.

{140900}{140954}- Uspela si! Bila si fantastična!|- Uspeli smo!
{140968}{141025}Ništa neće nikada nadmašiti|ono što sam sada osetila.
{141039}{141108}- Imamo je. - Imamo li?|Jesi li siguran? U redu.

{144967}{145065}- Hvala. - Fantastično.|Nadamo se... da ćemo je videti i sledeće godine.
{145109}{145191}- Pa, mogla bi.|- Dobro.
{145415}{145455}Hej, Terri.|Hajde.
You see how it's done?
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.
You better.
The boss will chew my head off if these cores get messed up.
Don't worry.
We're at 26 feet.
You let Jason operate the drill?
Yeah, he can handle it.
I didn't do anything.
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!
Forget it, Jack! It's too late!
You're not gonna make it!
Jack!
Jack! Give me your hand!
I've got you!
What were you thinking?
- What's happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off!
That's what's happening!
What we have found locked to these ice cores is evidence of a cataclysmic climate shift that occurred around
10,000 years ago.
The concentration of these natural greenhouse gases in the ice cores indicates that runaway warming pushed the planet into an ice age which lasted two centuries.
I'm confused.
I thought you were talking about global warming, not an ice age.
Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can trigger a cooling trend.
Let me explain.
The northern hemisphere owes its temperate climate to the North Atlantic current.
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator and is carried north by the ocean.
But, global warming is melting the polar ice caps and disrupting this flow.
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs... there goes our warm climate.
Excuse me. When do you think this could happen, professor? When?
I don't know. Maybe in 100 years, maybe in 1000.
But what I do know is that if we do not act soon, it is our children and our grandchildren who will have to pay the price.
And who's going to pay the price of the Kyoto Accord?
It will cost the world's economy hundreds of billions of dollars.
With all due respect,
Mr. Vice President, the cost of doing nothing could be even higher.
Our climate is fragile.
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels and polluting the environment, the ice caps will soon disappear.
Professor, um, Hall... our economy is every bit as fragile as the environment.
Perhaps you should keep that in mind before making sensationalist claims.
Well, the last chunk of ice that broke off was about the size of the state of Rhode Island.
Some people might call that pretty sensational.
Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!
I'm here at the global warming conference in New Delhi, where, if you can believe your eyes, it's snowing.
The coldest weather on record has thrown the city into chaos, with hundreds of homeless people freezing to death.
Taxi!
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.
Oh, thank you. That's what we're here for, right? Put on a good show?
Quite. I was wondering if I could talk to you about your theory on abrupt climate shift.
The name's Rapson.
Terry Rapson.
Professor Rapson?
- Of the Hedland Center?
- That's me.
I've read your work on ocean currents.
- What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.
Over here.
Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland, where Manchester United
leads 3-1 over hometown Celtic.
in this pitiful
Champions League match.
We return to the action
63 minutes into the second half
as Manchester United looks to put the game out of reach.
Let's get back to our commentator
Donald MacFarland.
What? Yeah.
- I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.
The baby kept us awake all night.
And still.
Good!
Dennis?
NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing a temperature drop of 13 degrees.
- Yeah? Where is 4311?
- Well, it's...
- Georges Bank.
- It's rough seas out there.
Must have knocked it about.
Kick that bloody ball. Come on!
Come on, kick it now. Kick it!
- Kick it!
- Are the lads winning?
Hello, professor.
How was India?
Oh, you know what these scientific gatherings are.
All dancing girls, wine and parties.
The fury of Hurricane Noelani stunned weather experts yesterday
slamming into the unprepared island chain
with a cataclysmic force never before witnessed.
Meteorologists already believe this to be the strongest hurricane
ever recorded.
Are you gonna get that?
Hello?
I just saw that Sam got an F in calculus.
I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.
Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.
All right, I don't have time to talk about this right now.
Well, maybe you ought to make time.
Excuse me, I'm not the one who's away for months and months at a time.
I just don't understand.
I'll let him explain it to you.
Can you take him to the airport in the morning?
Sam's getting on a plane?
He joined the Scholastic
Decathlon Team.
- They're competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?
- Yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
- Oh.
Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?
I gotta go because
I'm on call tonight.
Jack, please don't be late.
I don't want him taking a taxi again.
All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.
This morning's weather staff meeting has been moved to level four,
conference room B.
Jack?
I know you have an innate talent for rubbing people the wrong way Jack, but why?
Why, for the love of god, would you aggravate the vice president?
Because my 17-year-old kid knows more science than he does.
Perhaps. But your 17-year-old kid does not control our budget.
- It doesn't matter if he hates you.
- My son doesn't hate me.
You're missing the point.
What I'm trying to tell you is,
- if Raymond Becker pulls our budget...
- Oh, shit!
- Wait... Will you...?
Jack.
Oh, my god.
- Hi Sam. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Dad, it's fine. The cab's already here.
That's okay. I'll take care of it.
- What are you gonna...?
- Here you go.
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.
- Do you want to hear my side of it?
- Sam, how can there be two sides?
Hey look. I got every question right on the final.
And the only reason why Mr. Spengler failed me was because I didn't write out the solutions.
Why not?
I do them in my head.
- Did you tell him that?
- I did. He didn't believe me.
He said that if he can't do them in his head, then I must be cheating.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
How can he fail you for being smarter than he is?
That's what I said.
You did?
- How'd he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.
I'm gonna call this guy and have a word with him.
We're gonna get this whole thing straighten out.
Hey, you can't park there.
- Don't worry about it.
- Sam?
Sam.
Parker, this is Houston.
We're seeing some bad weather over Canaveral.
It doesn't look like you're coming back this week.
Your wife's gonna give me an earful.
Roger that.
Hey, come take a look at this storm system.
It's enormous.
You all right?
He's afraid of flying.
I'm fine.
You know statistically, the chance of a plane going down because of turbulence is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?
- I can't remember if it's a...
- Shut up, Brian.
Listen, Sam... don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.
They're still serving drinks.
Hey folks, it appears we're gonna have a little bit of a bumpy ride here
for the next few minutes.
Please fasten your seat belts and put your tray tables
and seatbacks in their upright positions until we get through this. Thank you.
Grab it. Watch out!
Sam?
Sam.
Can I have my hand back?
I can't believe I'm spending two weeks alone with my mom.
Be patient with her.
She's been looking forward to this holiday for months.
I know.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey.
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.
The cause of this extreme weather remains a mystery,
although some meteorologists believe sunspots are to blame.
Hundreds are missing...
This is very odd.
There's a buoy here registering a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.
I'll put a call in, see if there are any ships near
Georges Bank to get it.
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.
What?
What are the odds of two buoys failing?
Remote.
Make that three.
Just another typical day in New York City.
Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.
Lookie here, Buddha.
These people, and their cars, and their exhaust and they're just polluting the atmosphere.
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.
We're almost there.
- We're only two blocks away.
- Let's walk.
What's gotten into them?
I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.
In 1532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro defeated this Incan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.
What is his name?
Time.
Montezuma.
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico, not Peru.
It's, like, Anta-something.
- Atahualpa?
- That's it!
Time's up. Correct answers, please.
That's five points for Woodmont and five points for Pinehurst Academy.
Next question.
In what year did Louis Quatorze ascend to the throne of France?
This place is so retro, it might actually be cool if it were on purpose.
Yeah, look at all these nerds.
Hey.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thanks. This place is incredible.
Do you believe that this is their cafeteria?
You played a great first round.
So did you.
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.
- I'm Laura.
- Oh, I'm J.D.
- Your school's amazing.
- Would you like... would you like a tour?
Sure. That'd be great.
Could you hold this for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Man, you got some serious competition.
Please.
- I bet he's really rich too.
- Shut up.
Who is it?
Terry Rapson here.
Sorry to call you so early.
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?
Well, we've found something extraordinary.
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.
You recall what you said in New Delhi about how polar melting might disrupt the North Atlantic Current?
Yes.
Well...
I think it's happening.
What do you mean?
One of our NOMAD buoys registered a 13-degree drop
in surface temperature the other day.
I've sent you an e-mail.
Hold on.
At first we thought it was a malfunction.
But there are four more across the North Atlantic
 showing the same thing.
This is unbelievable.
You predicted it would happen.
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.
There are no forecast models remotely capable of plotting this scenario,
except yours.
My model is a reconstruction of a prehistoric climate shift.
It's not a forecast model.
It's the closest thing we have.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
At least not in the last
10,000 years.
As I predicted yesterday, the swell off Hurricane
Noelani is incredible.
These waves are even bigger than I imagined. Just take a look.
Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather or something?
This is L.A. What weather?
Wait. What's that noise?
What noise?
Honey, I'll be right back.
The Coast Guard has closed the beaches,
as waves have grown too big for...
L.A. Weather Center.
It's Tommy.
I'm down at the beach.
I'm in the middle of something,
Tommy. What do you need?
There's hail the size of golf balls coming down here.
A low-pressure system moving along the California coastline
is creating a cyclonic system across the L.A. Basin.
Yeah? Hello?
Hey boss, turn on The Weather
Channel right away.
I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
What are you talking about?
Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting wind speeds in excess of 70 miles...
Hold on a second.
...conditions that are highly unusual for California.
Tom, we're building a forecast model, we're gonna need... what?
Priority access to the mainframe for two days, maybe three.
- Oh, is that it? Anything else?
- We need it immediately.
You know I would say that you've lost your mind but you've been this way for the past 20 years.
Tom, this is important.
What's this forecast model you're building, if you don't mind my asking?
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.
Janet's a hurricane specialist with NASA.
Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and I have absolutely no idea what he's up to.
Booker. What's going on here?
They just issued a tornado warning in Los Angeles.
Breaking news as we prepare to go live to Los Angeles.
- Mixed reports are coming in about...
- Report is just coming out.
some extreme weather occurring in the area.
Okay, we're now going live to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.
We have live coverage now from our Fox 11 chopper.
Are you there, Bart?
Uh, yes, I'm here. These tornados are forming so fast...
- Bart!
- What? Oh! Oh, my god.
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?
This tornado just came and erased the Hollywood sign.
The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.
Bart, what can you see?
Is anyone hurt?
I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage down there.
And there are people down there, taking pictures.
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover!
You can't stay here!
Get out of here!
What you're seeing are two actual tornados striking Los Angeles
International Airport.
Wait. Wait.
It looks like they've joined and formed one large tornado.
- Tommy!
- Oh, my god!
Holy shit!
I'd like to urge all of our viewers to stay away from the areas...
- Jeff, where are you?
- I'm on Yucca and Vine.
- I'm on my way there now.
- You're on TV. Right in the middle of it.
God! Oh, my god!
You gotta get out of there, man.
That bus just got dropped on top of that Porsche!
Oh, my god.
I hope no one was in that car.
For our national audience just joining us now
we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now.
Tommy?
If you look over there behind me, that's a tornado.
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.
It's one of many tornados that are destroying our city.
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.
It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.
What's happening?
It- it- it looks like some sort of huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare, only this is the real thing...
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.
- Yes, it is.
- What's happening Raymond?
I'll call you back.
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been devastated by a series of tornados.
On top of that, the FAA wants your approval to suspend all air traffic.
What do you think we should do?
Until we can figure it out what's going on here I...
I don't think we have much choice, sir.
What you're seeing is what's left of downtown Los Angeles.
Hey, man, I just got off the phone with my mom.
Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry, but we need to change the channel.
The FAA has grounded all air traffic in the United States.
Unfortunately, the order came too late for two planes
that were brought down by severe turbulence in the Midwest.
- The first flight...
- So much for "one in a billion."
All right.
All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.
We've got a lot of work to do, and we don't have much time so let's get started, please.
Vorsteen?
All our grid models are worthless.
I don't think grid models are gonna be a lot of help here.
The Canadians are reporting tremendous circulation moving down from the Arctic.
In Siberia, there's a low-pressure system unlike anything we've seen, and Australia just saw the strongest typhoon ever recorded.
Hang on. Are you saying that these things are interconnected?
We have to consider the possibility.
The only force strong enough to affect global weather is the sun.
- What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked.
Solar output is normal.
What about the
North Atlantic Current?
What about it?
I got a call last night... from Professor Rapson at the Hedland Center.
He thinks the current has changed.
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?
The current depends upon a delicate balance of salt and freshwater.
- We all know that.
- Yes.
But no one has taken into account how much freshwater has been dumped into the ocean because of melting polar ice.
I think we've hit a critical desalinization point.
It would explain what's driving this extreme weather.
Hedland had some pretty convincing data.
They've asked me to feed it into my paleoclimate model to track the next set of events.
Hold on Jack.
Are you suggesting these weather anomalies are gonna continue?
Not just continue. Get worse.
I think we're on the verge of a major climate shift.
Tom. What are you gonna tell the Administration?
What do you expect me to tell them?
The government has to start making long term preparations, now.
Jack, all you have is a theory.
Well, then give me the mainframe.
And let me prove it.
No.
You have 48 hours.
- Professor Hall.
- Yes.
- I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored the strongest hurricane on record.
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.
Can the model you're working on factoring in storm scenarios?
- We haven't had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.
Hi, I'm Jason.
Hi.
Do you have the results of
Peter's CT scan?
Yeah. The treatments shrunk the tumor 20 percent.
- Is his eyesight better today?
- No. No change.
- Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
- A little better.
Good.
Let me listen here.
Can you read that?
No, but I remember the story from the pictures.
You do?
My mother used to read it to me.
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Jack, you've been working for 24 hours straight.
You're the only one who hasn't taken a break.
Maybe I'll try to shut my eyes for a while.
Call me when you get the results.
Frank, is he always so obsessive?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Does he ever lighten up?
- Not really.
- No.
How long have you been working together?
Well, Frank's been working with him since the Stone Age, but I've only had to endure two years of servitude.
Jack.
Jack, we got the results.
Six to eight months?
That can't be.
That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.
Widespread flooding has slowed transportation
and caused numerous closures,
including the Lincoln and
Holland Tunnels.
The plumbing in the school is really old.
And I guess seeing with all this rain, the sewage got stopped up.
Where are you staying tonight?
They're finding a place for us to stay with kids here in New York City.
Are you sure you can't get home any sooner than tomorrow?
Well, look, dad, I would if I could, you know. I just...
This smell is unbearable, dad.
Stop kidding around!
I want you home.
Dad, I'll be on the train.
Do me a favor okay.
Just don't worry about me.
I'll figure it out.
All right, son.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Sam, guess what?
We got a place to stay.
Great.
So far, the terrible weather hasn't hit D.C. area,
but local residents aren't taking any chances
as people stock up for what is already being billed
as the worst storm season on record.
You better be sure about this Jack.
- My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.
And I hope to god it's wrong.
- Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.
- You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we've met.
Professor Hall has some new information
I think you should take a look at it.
We just got these results from our simulation model.
They explain what's causing this severe weather.
Look, I have to read this later.
I have a meeting with the director of FEMA right now.
This is very urgent sir.
Our climate is changing violently.
And it's going to happen over the next six to eight weeks.
I bet you said this wouldn't happen for another 100 years or so.
- I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you're wrong this time.
I wish that I were, but I'm sure that you're aware of what's happening all around the world.
We're making all the necessary preparations for this storm.
What more do you expect?
You have to start thinking about large-scale evacuations right now.
Especially in the Northern states.
- Evacuations?
- Yes.
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.
Mr. Vice President!
If we don't act now, it's going to be too late.
Come on, Jack.
Hey. Thanks for bringing us here.
I couldn't let you leave New York without seeing the
Natural History Museum.
Of course not.
It's the world's finest collection of stuffed animals.
Hey, guys, check this out.
"The body of this mammoth was found perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra with food still in its mouth and stomach indicating that it froze instantly while grazing."
It's been 24 hours now since the snow started falling
across the British Isles and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.
No, no, no. You've got to stop worrying. No, no.
It's fine. We've got plenty of supplies. We're just snowed in.
Yeah. No, it's all right.
It's all right.
No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.
Yeah, I love you too.
Okay, bye.
- Hey. How's Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.
The ferry just landed.
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.
An elite RAF search-and-rescue team has been deployed by helicopter
to airlift the royal family to safety.
Yeah, you think they'll come get us since we got snowed in?
Not likely.
Luckily we've got our own genny, enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.
Oh, we'll be fine.
As long as the loo doesn't back up again.
We've got zero visibility.
- Maintain heading and speed.
- What's our heading?
035, sir.
Approximately 40 kilometers from Balmoral Castle.
We've lost visual contact with you.
- This gauge here can't be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.
We have vertical walls of cirrus cloud formations.
What the hell is going on?
The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze.
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.
We've got a flameout on the starboard side as well.
Prepare for crash landing.
Select emergency fuel.
Come on, you bastard!
Come on!
What I'm about to tell you is supposed to be confidential.
Several hours ago, three helicopters went down over Scotland.
They crashed because the fuel in their lines froze.
- At what temperature does...?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
We had to look it up.
The temperature dropped phenomenally fast.
On the ground, people froze before they could get out of their cars even.
Can you get me a satellite picture of Scotland two hours ago?
Yeah.
We've got mountains of data but nowhere near enough computer power to analyze it.
Can you help us?
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.
Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.
This is Scotland at the time the temperature dropped.
This thing looks just like a hurricane.
Only hurricanes don't form over land.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.
- Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.
- Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.
Wow.
You live here?
Just on the weekends.
It's...
It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so...
Where is he?
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.
Is this you and your brother?
Yeah, that's when we took a bike trip together.
It's been raining like this for three days now.
Come on, hurry up.
I'm just standing here.
You can't stay here.
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.
It's a mob scene here at Grand Central Station.
Over half the platforms are flooded
and service has been suspended on all trains.
With planes still grounded and trains now out of service
that's bad news for the...
Hey, Victor's coming to pick me up.
You guys want a ride to the train station?
Not anymore.
In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.
What we have feared for the past few days has indeed happened.
The cold front moving down from the Arctic
has created an enormous storm system in Canada.
Which, incredible as it sounds,
looks more and more like a tropical hurricane...
Well, I gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want me to give you a ride?
Where is he?
He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia.
If this system moves south
we could see a wind-driven storm surge
that could threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.
Okay, bye.
Victor's stuck in traffic over on Fifth Avenue.
It'll be easier to head straight out of town if we just meet him over there.
All right.
You mean walk?
No, not in this.
We should take the stairs.
We're on the top floor.
I guess we're walking.
Maybe we should just stay here.
I think the young lady is right sir.
No. We need to get home.
Hey, Cesar, come here.
What are you doing?
The wolves, they're gone.
Just to give you an idea of the situation
which seems to be becoming worse with each passing minute.
At the moment, we have flooding in most parts of the island.
We've got traffic snarl-ups because the electricity is now out
to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.
Car accidents, at least two hundred.
And lower Manhattan, we've been told,
is virtually inaccessible.
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?
Hey.
That dog can't come in here.
Come on, man.
It's pouring out there.
I don't care. Read the sign.
It's supposed to be a public library.
Come on, guys, this way.
Excuse me. You're bad.
Goddamn 1500-dollar waterproof raincoat.
- Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.
That's because it's New York.
Hey! Hey!
- Open up, big papa.
- It's out of service.
It's out of service.
No, no. I'll give you 100 dollars to put it in service.
You don't have to do that.
No, no, really. 200 dollars.
I won't have it. I won't have it.
Oh god, I love buses.
This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.
Hello?
I can't reach my driver.
- I lost the signal.
- This is insane.
We're not gonna be able to drive anywhere.
We should just go back to your apartment.
Yeah, I vote for that.
What? Are you kidding?
We have to get higher!
Come on.
Up to the library.
Calm down.
I can't understand what you're saying.
If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.
The door is jammed!
I don't speak French!
Hey, where's Laura?
- She was just right there.
- She's right there! Right there, see?
What is she doing?
Tell them to cover their eyes.
There is a wall of water coming towards New York City.
Everybody...
What? What's the problem?
She left her bag in the cab.
Their passports.
Forget about it.
- I'll get it for her.
- Come on.
Oh, my...
Laura!
Laura!
- Sam.
- No! Brian, no!
Laura! Laura, look!
Come on. Come!
Come on!
Sam!
No!
Professor.
Thank you.
- Is that Neville's handiwork?
- Neville's way beyond stick figures.
- He's 6 already.
- Oh.
No, this masterpiece belongs to my second grandson, David.
God. I can't believe
Neville's 6 already.
You won't believe how fast they grow.
Professor.
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.
They've run the data we've sent them.
Here he is.
Jack, were you able to recreate the thermal cycle?
Yes. The storm's rotation is pulling super-cooled air all the way down from the upper troposphere.
But shouldn't the air warm up before it reaches ground level?
It should. But it doesn't.
The air's descending too rapidly.
Is this an isolated incident?
I'm afraid not.
We've located two other super cells in addition to the one over Scotland.
There is one over Northern Canada
and another one over Siberia.
And do we know their projected paths?
Yes.
Our previous estimates of six to eight weeks weren't even close.
This one storm is going to change the face of our planet.
Here's a projection of 24 hours out.
This is 48 hours out.
And in seven to ten days...
When this storm is over
we'll be in a new Ice Age.
My god.
Professor...
It's time you got out of there.
I'm afraid that time has come and gone, my friend.
What can we do?
Save as many as you can.
Jack.
Something's happened in New York.
No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.
- Who needs help?
- Here. Over here.
What?
This is the last one. Enjoy it.
Greedy.
All circuits are busy at this time.
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.
It was really brave.
I guess I better return her bag.
Sam?
Just tell her how you feel.
Yeah.
Did you reach your little brother yet?
No, there's still no service.
Damn cell phones.
- Excuse me.
- Yes.
Are there any pay phones on the upper floors?
No, no, no.
Ah. But there are some on the mezzanine.
Great.
- Oh, but I think it's underwater.
- Where you going? Power's out.
Older payphones draw their power directly from the telephone line.
There will be an emergency meeting of all NOAA department heads...
Oh, god. I've been trying to reach Sam.
So have I.
I tried to call you but I couldn't get through.
It's been a madhouse around here.
Come on.
Are you sure about this?
It works.
I love that picture.
Yeah, so do I.
Where was that taken?
Miami.
Well, where was I?
I don't remember that trip.
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska, doing research on your doctorate.
Remember what he was like when he was that age?
Everything was "one more."
One more bedtime story.
One more ride on my shoulders.
"One more, daddy."
Jack. Sam's on the phone.
Line four.
- Sam?
- Dad!
Where are you?
Are you all right?
I'm all right.
We're at the Public Library.
Sam, it's Mom.
- I'm so happy you're okay.
- Mom.
Can you call Laura and
Brian's parents and tell them we're all right?
Yes, of course.
- Sam, what's that noise?
- Sam?
Sam?
What is going on out there, dad?
Sam. Sam, listen to me.
Listen very carefully.
Forget what I said about trying to head south.
It's too late for that.
The storm is just gonna get worse.
It's gonna turn into a massive blizzard
with an eye in the center of it, just like a huge hurricane.
Uh huh.
Only the air is gonna be so cold.
You could freeze to death in seconds.
Sam?
Well, what should we do?
Listen to me, son.
Do not go outside.
Just burn whatever you can to stay warm, and try to wait it out.
I will come for you.
Do you understand me?
I will come for you.
Sam?
- Sam, come back!
- Sam?
- Sam?
Sam, did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
Sam?
- Tell me he's gonna be okay...
- He's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right, do you understand me?
I thought you'd drowned.
Let's find some dry clothes for you. Come on.
Where'd you store the arctic gear?
You can't make it to New York, Jack.
I've walked that far before in the snow.
This is not the same.
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.
I have to do this.
I know.
My hands are shak...
- Shaking.
- That's okay. Here.
Here. Come here.
What are you doing?
I'm using my body heat to warm you.
If we let the blood from your arms and legs rush back to your heart too quickly your heart could fail.
Where did you learn that?
Some of us were actually paying attention in health class.
How are you feeling?
Much better.
Frank told me about Sam.
I'm not gonna try to talk you out of going, but there's something I need for you do first.
You have to explain your results to the Administration.
- I already tried that, Tom.
- I know. This time will be different.
You're gonna brief the President directly.
- Is that the last of it?
- Yeah. Pretty much.
Okay.
We also found this radio, but I don't think it works.
Let me see it.
Buddha, keep quiet.
You ain't even supposed to be in here anyway.
Come on, guys.
Oh, my god.
The basic rule of storms is that they continue until the imbalance that created them is corrected.
In this case, we're talking about a global realignment.
This superstorm will last seven to ten days.
When it's over, ice and snow will cover the entire Northern Hemisphere.
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.
The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize but with an average temperature close to that of the last Ice Age.
Well, what can we do about this?
Head as far south as possible.
That is not amusing, professor.
Where do you suggest they go?
The farther south they go, the safer they'll be.
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't flooded.
Mexico would be best.
Mexico? Maybe you should stick to science and leave policy to us.
Well, we tried that approach.
You didn't want to hear about the science when it could have made a difference.
What exactly are you proposing, professor?
Evacuate everyone south of that line.
What about the people in the North?
I'm afraid it's too late for them.
If they go outside the storm will kill them.
At this point their best chance is to stay inside.
Try to ride it out.
Pray.
What do you think he'll do?
I don't know.
Jack.
Thanks... and good luck.
You too.
We're all gonna need it.
We can't evacuate half the country because one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.
Every minute we delay is costing lives.
What about the other half of the country?
If Professor Hall is right about this storm pattern sending troops north will create more victims.
We need to save the people we can right now.
We take the same approach in triage on the battlefield.
Sometimes it's necessary to make difficult choices...
I don't accept that abandoning half the country is necessary.
Maybe if you would've listened to him sooner, it wouldn't be.
Bullshit. It's easy for him to suggest this plan.
- He's safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.
I just thought that you should know that before you start questioning his motives.
We're going to follow Hall's plan.
- General.
- Sir?
Give the order for the National Guard to evacuate the southern states.
Yes, sir.
Vivian... get me my wife.
Sorry, mates, but we're just about out of petrol.
Hey.
Is there any chance... that it'll run... on this?
Are you mad?
That's a 12-year-old Scotch.
Gentlemen.
To England.
To mankind.
To Manchester United.
I just...
I just wish I could have seen him grow up. You know?
The important thing is he will grow up.
Amen.
Maybe you should have somebody help you with that, you know.
Sir, I am president of the
Electronics Club the Math Club and the Chess Club.
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here, please, point him out.
I'll just leave you alone to work on it, okay?
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.
Look, there's nobody around.
OK. You know what?
I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.
What?
Hey, man, there is people out there.
I was walking my dog.
There is hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.
Where they all going?
They're getting out of the city before it's too late.
All right, everybody. Quiet down.
When was the last time anyone got a signal on a cell phone?
Well, I got through to my cousin in Memphis an hour ago.
They're being evacuated to the South.
We should get moving too.
The water is frozen over enough to walk on.
We should get going before the snow gets too deep.
Everyone, wrap yourselves up as fast as you can.
- We shouldn't go.
- We're leaving in five minutes.
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.
When I talked to my dad, he told me to stay inside.
The storm will kill anybody caught in it.
- Then you have to say something.
- I know.
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.
What? Listen son, we're all scared, but we've got no choice.
- That's not it.
- Get ready to go.
If these people go outside, they will freeze to death!
Okay, what is this nonsense?
It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.
The people who are caught outside they will freeze to death.
- Where are you getting this information?
- My father's a climatologist.
- He works for the government.
- So what are you suggesting we do?
We stay inside, we keep warm, and we wait it out.
The snow is getting deeper by the minute.
We'd be trapped here without food, supplies...
- It's a risk, yeah...
- An unnecessary risk.
No, no. It's not.
We've wasted enough time talking about this.
Come on, people
Let's go.
- Look, look. Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody...
- One second.
- Let's get going.
The storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.
You're not gonna be able to survive it.
Believe me.
Sir, please just stay.
Just stay.
Just don't...
She's set to go.
Come on, straight to the back, guys.
It'll be impossible to reach each other.
Leave a message for me at the
American Embassy in Mexico City.
Okay, I will.
I love you.
I love you, Jack.
Tell Sam I love him so much.
God be with you.
- Doctor Hall?
- Yeah.
We haven't been able to reach Peter's parents.
- I'm gonna try it later, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.
I got it.
You're supposed to be on a bus heading south.
I've been watching your back for 20 years.
You think I'd let you go alone?
All these years I thought
I was watching your back.
Where are the keys?
In the truck.
Where do you think you're going?
Neither one of you knows how to navigate worth a damn.
Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.
I'll try to give you updates on the storm as it heads your way.
Good luck, Jack.
Breaking news from the U.S.-Mexico border.
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border in the light of so many U.S. refugees who are fleeing south in the wake of the approaching storm.
These people came here in anticipation of crossing into Mexico.
Instead, they've been met with closed gates.
And now, in a dramatic reversal of illegal immigration thousands of people are crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico.
The scene that unfolding here behind me is one of desperation and frustration.
People have abandoned their cars, grabbed their belongings and they are wading across the river illegally into Mexico.
Here it is.
This fireplace probably hasn't been used in about 100 years.
All right.
- What are you doing?
- What did you think we're gonna burn?
- You can't burn books.
- No, absolutely not.
You wanna freeze to death?
I'll go get some more.
I'll help you.
I'm going with them.
Okay, do you have a cafeteria or a lunchroom?
Just an employees' lounge with a few vending machines.
We're not gonna last very long on MandM's and potato chips.
What about the garbage cans?
There's always something to eat in the garbage.
Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can not burn Nietzsche.
He was the most important thinker of the 19th century.
Please. Nietzsche was a chauvinist pig who was in love with his sister.
He was not a chauvinist pig.
But he was in love with his sister.
Excuse me? you guys?
Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law down here that we can burn.
After hours of uncertainty, the traffic is now moving smoothly
from the United States into Mexico.
This is only possible because the president was able to negotiate a deal
to forgive all Latin American debt in exchange for opening the border.
Now, multitudes of American families are feeling a rush of relief...
Lucy?
Is Peter's ambulance here?
No.
- Why?
- They've all gone.
- What?
- In the confusion...
I don't know what happened.
People just started to panic, and they left, and...
- God.
- Now there's a policeman with a snowplow.
- He's waiting outside.
- God.
Peter can't be moved in anything but an ambulance.
I called and left a message for the county ambulance service.
Okay.
Okay, you should go, and I'll stay and wait.
Lucy, no.
- No.
- No, you should go.
He's not gonna wait forever.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- All right.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
I cut my leg the other day.
Did you get a signal?
Yeah, for a minute.
And?
Man, this storm is everywhere.
It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.
Europe is buried under
15 feet of snow and they say it's gonna get just as bad here.
I mean, I don't think your dad's gonna make it.
No, he'll make it.
He'll make it.
The White House has ordered the following national disaster alert
for all Northern states.
Continued exposure to the approaching storm is deadly.
Remain indoors and take all measures to stay warm,
burning any fuel sources until the storm is over. 
The Roads are impassable across New York State
as far south as Pennsylvania...
Where are we?
Looks like we're just north of Philadelphia.
Look out!
You guys okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Once again, the roads across the...
Sorry, boss.
Unpack the snowshoes.
We're walking from here.
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.
What for? Half the city's frozen under water.
There's nothing to go back to.
Time to get up and keep moving.
What we should've done is stayed in the library.
Come on, man.
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Wake up.
What are you doing?
Insulating.
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.
You know, you spend some years on the streets and you learn how to keep warm.
Hey.
Thanks.
I got one.
Your favorite vacation.
Besides this one?
All right.
I went to Greenland with my dad on one of his research trips a few years ago... and the ship broke down, and we got stuck.
And it rained constantly.
That sounds really boring.
But actually really nice, you know?
Just me and my dad hanging out for 10 days.
Frank!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I just dropped in to do a little shopping.
I gotta lose this sled.
Hold on! We'll pull you up.
Jason! you've got to support
Frank's weight.
Okay, I'll try.
Okay, I think I have his weight now.
I'm coming to you.
The glass is breaking!
Too much weight.
It's not gonna hold.
No. No.
Frank. I can get you out.
Don't do it!
- No, Frank, no!
- Frank, no!
Frank!
What have you got there?
A Gutenberg Bible.
It was in the rare books room.
You think god's gonna save you?
No. I don't believe in god.
You're holding onto that Bible pretty tight.
I'm protecting it.
This Bible is the first book ever printed.
It represents the dawn of the age of reason.
As far as I'm concerned, the written word is mankind's greatest achievement.
You can laugh.
But if Western civilization is finished
I'm gonna save at least one little piece of it.
We heard somebody was left behind.
- We brought an ambulance.
- Thank god.
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey.
Hey, are you all right?
You look like you have a fever or something.
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.
My mind keeps going over all those worthless decathlon facts.
- It's pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it's all right.
I guess you just haven't had time to adjust yet.
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?
Everything I've ever cared about, everything I've worked for has all been preparation for a future that no longer exists.
I know you always thought I took the competition too seriously.
You were right.
- It was all for nothing.
- No, no. I...
No, I just... I just said that to avoid admitting the truth.
Truth about what?
About why I joined the team.
I joined it because of you.
Hey.
I know.
I know.
- Mr. President.
- All right.
I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.
We're the last ones.
All right.
Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.
We've got an urgent message for high command.
Request priority for landing zone one.
Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.
- Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.
- Sorry for the delay, sir.
- Carry on.
Madam Secretary.
Raymond.
The president's motorcade got caught in the storm.
They didn't make it.
And she wouldn't wake up this morning. I...
I mean last night she only had a fever.
I don't understand.
She's awfully pale.
Well guys, look.
None of us has had anything real to eat in days.
- I'm telling you it's hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?
- We've all been in...
- Look maybe it's just the flu, you guys.
No, no, it's not the flu.
And how do you know?
Books can be good for something other than burning.
All right, let's go for her symptoms?
I told you that she has a fever and her...
She's got a really cold sweat.
How's her pulse?
- It's really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?
Like a cut or something that might have gotten infected?
She was complaining about a cut on her leg a few days ago.
I didn't think anything of it.
Oh, my gosh.
That's blood poisoning.
Uh, Septicemia.
She could go into septic shock.
I've seen that before.
That can get bad.
She needs a massive dose of penicillin... or a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately, or...
Or what?
I've never seen anything like it.
There's no point of reference.
All I could see is cloud cover.
What are you doing?
Taking infrared image of thermal currents.
Send to Houston, Korolev, your weather service.
I'll help you.
Tom? Tom, wake up.
I just received some satellite images from the space station.
You better take a look.
How big is this thing?
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.
And growing. The two cells over Europe and Asia are even bigger.
Good god.
This one's gonna hit New York inside an hour.
Jason!
Are you all right?
Jason!
What are you doing?
There's gotta be medicine on that ship.
I thought you said it was too dangerous to go outside.
I know I did.
Where did you find those chairs?
Why?
I'm going with you.
Me too.
Come on, damn it!
- It's all in Russian. I...
- I know.
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
- What? How do you know?
Because it says "penicillin" on the bottle.
Hey, wait a minute.
This is the mess hall.
We should find some food while we're here.
No. We don't have time.
Listen, none of us are gonna survive much longer without food, okay?
Including Laura.
Okay.
- Sam, over here.
- What?
Bingo.
Brian?
- I'm okay.
- What happened?
All I did was open up the cupboard.
- Well, we can use it.
- Put food in it.
Run!
Pull him in, Brian!
- You all right?
- Oh, my god, there's more.
My leg.
Here, use this.
It should be over
New York by now.
Satellite readings are showing a temperature drop of
10 degrees per second.
You guys...
I think we're in the eye of it.
We gotta get back right now.
Look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna lure the wolves out of the room.
When they leave, you lock the door.
Good luck.
- Brian, hurry.
- I need something.
Come on, hurry!
Brian! Brian, open the door!
We have to get out of here now.
Brian, get the supplies.
Let's go!
Pull, Brian!
Take the medicine to Laura.
We're almost there.
Come on!
Brian! Close the door!
Don't let the fire go out!
What's happening?
Buddha, come away from the door.
Come, Buddha, come!
More books! More books!
How long have I been out of it?
Couple hours.
How do you feel?
Okay. What happened?
Well, we had to get inside in kind of a hurry, so I, uh... sort of pushed you in.
I should be used to you pushing me around.
Good to have you back.
What are you doing?
The eye of the storm has passed, and we're 40 miles from Manhattan.
Jack, shouldn't we wait one more day?
Sam may not have one more day.
What do you think's gonna happen to us?
What do you mean?
I mean us. Civilization.
Everybody.
Mankind survived the last Ice Age.
We're certainly capable of surviving this one.
All depends on whether or not we're able to learn from our mistakes.
I sure as hell would like a chance to learn from mine.
You did everything you could.
I was thinking about Sam.
Jack, you know the chances of Sam...
I made my son a promise.
I'm going to keep it.
Parker, this is Houston.
Do you read?
Roger, mission control.
Go ahead.
We're getting scattered reports
that the storm is dissipating over North America.
Can you confirm?
Affirmative. It's finally clearing.
We're over Europe right now.
I can see landmass for the first time in days.
How much further is it to the library?
It should be... right here.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Sam?
Who is that?
My father.
You made it.
Of course I did.
Mr. President.
I've just received a shortwave radio transmission from Jack Hall.
He made it to New York.
He says there are survivors.
Thank you, Tom.
That's...
That's good news.
These past few weeks have left us all with a profound sense of humility
in the face of nature's destructive power.
For years, we operated under the belief that we could continue
consuming our planet's natural resources without consequence.
We were wrong.
I was wrong.
The fact that my first address to you
comes from a consulate on foreign soil
is a testament to our changed reality.
Not only Americans
but people all around the globe are now guests in the nations
we once called
The Third World.
In our time of need, they have taken us in and sheltered us.
And I am deeply grateful for their hospitality.
We mourn the loss of a spirited leader
whose courageous order to evacuate...
Peter? Hey.
You feeling okay today?
For days, we've despaired about the fate of the people
who are trapped in the North.
Today, there is cause for hope.
Only a few hours ago,
I received word that a small group of people survived in New York City
against all odds and in the face of tremendous adversity.
I've ordered an immediate search-and-rescue mission
to bring them home and to look for more survivors.
Jack!
It's good to see you.
Come on, let's go get on board.
Look at that.
What?
Have you ever seen the air so clear?
I got a wicked deal.
'78 camaro,
45,000 original miles.
Guy wanted fifteen g's.
I got him down to thirteen-five.
Hmm.
Three-fifty It-1 engine?
Yeah, baby, the real deal.
Book says there's only a thousand of them in existence, and this is one of them.
Even came with its own dancing hula girl on the dash.
Yeah, brennan, as happy as we are you've managed to save a hunk of metal from the scrap heap, the rest of us have spent the last twelve hours down at the docks trying to track down a shipment of stolen medical supplies.
I guess that means you didn't find it.
Don't even start.
All right, guys. You know what?
This storm's coming in pretty hard and my connection's going bad anyway, so i'll call you when i get closer to town.
Connection's going?
Please.
And he used to be a con man?
Guess it wasn't such a good deal after all.
I am adam kane.
I was a pioneer of genetic research, manipulating dna to save human lives.
But in many their genes unexpectedly mutated and developed superhuman abilities.
Together with four of the most powerful i fight to protect a world that doesn't even know we exist.
We are... mutant x.
Shh... shh... it's okay.
Uhhh... uhhh.
Shh. Shh, don't talk.
I'll make it all better... you know, if these guys are planning on shipping the stolen equipment out of the port, they gotta be hiding it some place.
Yeah, like any one of, oh maybe, a thousand run-down warehouses that we'll never have time to search.
Someone on the street must know.
It's an undercover job.
No, it's a brennan job, and he's off screwing around with his hotrod.
Let me see if i can get an eta.
Brennan. Brennan, do you copy?
I hope he's okay.
I mean, he said that there was a storm coming and who knows what kind of condition that car was in.
Okay.
Can we talk some more likely scenarios for a second.
White trash camaro... brennan... maybe a small-town waitress with a taste for both of the above?
If you ask me, he's probably just shacked up in a no-tell motel using his, "i think we have some electricity between us" line.
No.
No, if something held him up then he would've contacted us.
Well, i'll keep a trace running.
If his comlink's putting out anything at all we should be able to find him.
There was... an accident.
This truck was heading towards my car.
Shh. It's okay.
It doesn't matter.
Thanks for taking care of me like this.
My name is miranda.
Brennan mulwray.
Did you put my clothes somewhere?
They were ruined in the storm.
But, i have others for you.
Thanks.
And i found this in your pocket.
Um... there.
Brennan last checked in at 9:18.
He was... here.
Thirty miles outside of edgarstown.
So if he had car troubles or had to get in from the storm, i figure that's where he would've wound up.
Yeah, but a storm doesn't explain why his comlink didn't work.
I say we go find him.
Why don't you grab emma, grab shalimar, get on the road?
I think you'll want to retrace his route all the way down into edgarstown.
Adam. Adam.
Hey, jess, can anyone hear me?
Well, i don't know if your dad's style quite works for me, but... here it is.
I think you look great.
<laughing> now, i just have to figure out who you are and how come i've never seen you around before.
Yeah, well, i told you, i'm not from around here.
I know what you said, but you're wrong.
<laughing> look, miranda, there's people that are going to be worried about me so is there a phone around here somewhere?
A phone.
Um, i think there's one at brady's store.
Want to go?
Let's go.
Where are all the cars, then?
Cars?
Yeah, you know, four wheels... vroom vroom?
Hi, miranda.
Hi, everybody.
This is ben gilbert, gerald's son.
Ben gilbert?
Hi.
I'll tell you later.
Huh.
Let's go get some iced tea.
Yeah, you know what?
Order me one.
I'm going to make a call.
Be right back.
How you doin'?
Lucian, let that boy through.
Hey, look, i don't mind telling you that girl there, she's spoken for.
Anyone tell her that?
I'm telling you.
She's mine.
You know, i don't have time for this.
Don't start something you can't finish.
How's everybody today?
We're good, zander, real good.
That's how it should be.
I understand there's a construction project over at annie's you're supposed to be at, josh.
Yeah.
We'll talk again.
Let's go.
So you're ben gilbert?
Uh, yeah.
Are you going back to the farm or you planning to stay?
You know, i haven't decided yet.
Town's real friendly, though.
Anything else?
Not right now.
Have a good day.
You too.
Operator, can i help you?
Uh, yeah, operator, i'd like to make a long distance collect call. i'm sorry, that exchange does not exist.
What are you talking about?
I call it every day.
That exchange does not exist, sir.
Please check your number and call again.
Your town is seriously whacked.
I knew you'd come around.
Yeah.
That was nice.
Okay, so tell me what this ben gilbert thing is about now.
Gerald gilbert and his boys live on the edge of town.
They haven't been around for years.
Okay, so why don't you just tell them who i really am?
I couldn't.
I wouldn't want them to think that you were crazy.
I'm outta here.
Listen, i know that you think that you're not from here, but there's nowhere else.
People can't go beyond the wall.
What wall?
On eighth street.
It's the end of the world.
Wait! Stop!
Ben!
Ohhh!
My power's not working.
What are you doing?
Trying to get out of here.
Why?
We're happy here.
Brennan, no!
Huh... uh... aghhh!
Now you know?
Now you believe me?
There's only new hope.
There's only you and me... together.
Come away from it.
There's nothing on the other side.
Brennan, it's the end.
No, it's not.
It's a force field, or... i don't know.
There's gotta be a... some kind of projection from the inside, because you can't see anything... cars, or planes, nothing.
Tell you what, if i had my powers i'd just blast a hole through.
You'd see for yourself.
Powers?
What do you mean?
This barrier is not natural, okay?
Somebody put it here to keep this town inside.
Don't say that.
It has always been here.
You have to believe.
Why do i have to believe, huh?
I have a life out there.
I have friends that i want to get back to.
I'm getting out of this town.
Wait!
Miranda.
I wasn't yelling at you.
I'm frustrated, okay?
I didn't mean to make you cry.
Come on.
I just really need you to believe.
I don't want you to disappear.
Look at me.
I'm not going anywhere.
Not for now, anyway.
Josh, we're supposed to be at the construction project.
Well, we got something to do first.
Come on.
Gonna pay a little house call to ben gilbert's father.
Well, i don't know where else to check.
I mean, we've asked at the coffee shop, the motei... well, it's a straight shot on route 17 from edgarstown to us.
He had to come through here and he had to have stopped.
Well, he didn't just disappear.
Maybe he stopped for parts.
All right.
You check it out.
We'll head to the police station i mean, somebody's got to have seen him.
Don't leave me here.
Ho, ho.
Whoa.
Need to talk to you, old man.
You're a marcus, aren't you?
You have that look.
Well, you're looking at the future head of town council.
That so?
I had a feeling this town was heading in the wrong direction.
I guess there's proof.
Hey, hey!
You sound like a man who's forgotten how to believe.
That can be dangerous.
I believe the ideals your grandfather founded this place on.
All that's left now are the words.
Well, you'd do well to listen to those words, old man, and keep your son out of town and away from miranda, you understand me?
What are you talking about?
My sons haven't been in town in years.
Is that ben?
- Yes.
Why? What do you want with us?
Well, we'll be back to discuss that with you, mr. Gilbert.
You can count on that.
Let's go. Let's go.
Look, have there been any accidents reported in the last twenty-four hours involving a camaro?
Not... not a one.
Well, our friend's disappeared somewhere between here and thirty miles west on route 17.
You know anything about that?
Look. I got work to do.
I'm alone here.
Sorry, i can't help you.
We're all the same here.
You're no different.
Yeah?
Maybe here.
So what's it like being like everyone else, anyway?
It's nice.
There's time for lying in the sun, for walking, for being with friends.
Especially the ones that you love.
Hmm... well, i gotta tell you, new hope is becoming more appealing by the minute.
I knew you'd love it... ben.
<laughing>
<laughing> what would you do without me?
Oh, if i didn't have my life out there, i could see settling down in a place like this.
You mean it?
Yeah, it definitely has its charms.
Well, then, i'll let you in on a little secret.
Really?
I half believe you are what you say you are, an outsider, but since you don't exist, then that means i'm in love with an angel.
I wish we at least had a license place to trace.
He didn't leave us much to go on.
This is it.
Oh, my god.
Looks like this truck didn't do too well, either.
Nice.
Edgarstown trucking and junk yard.
The truck is theirs.
You know, i was thinking, i think i could actually get used to staying here.
Hey! Miranda!
Josh... what are you doing?
What's your problem?
You are.
Well, if you got something to say, then why don't you say it?
You know, there are some things that don't add up about you, ben.
I'm gonna figure you out, and when i do, miranda and everyone else in this community is going to understand what you're trying to do to us.
I'm not trying to do anything to this community.
Now, as for miranda, i'm starting to lose patience with having to tell you that she decides who she's with.
Well, maybe you didn't hear me.
Ben!
Josh!
Stop it!
This is not over.
You're hurt.
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
Here, come inside.
You were brave out there, fighting for me.
Yeah, you're worth fighting for.
How does that feel?
Like brand new.
See, i told you new hope would grow on you.
<laughing> yeah, i must have.
I'd like to take you to my world so you can see what you're missing.
I'm not missing anything.
And what's so great about your world, anyway?
Oh, everything.
Thai food and dance clubs, oceans, cars...
<laughing> if you could just see that look on your face.
Well, i still think you'd be happy here with me.
Well, since i don't have a choice.
Hey.
Zander, what are you doing here?
I... i've... i've come to see your friend.
There isn't any trouble, is there?
No, no, there's no trouble.
I just... want to talk to him is all.
Can we have a minute?
Well, i'm kind of busy, but... yeah.
It's about the world outside the wall.
I know.
You're part of this whole thing, so why should i trust you?
Well, if i'd wanted to hurt you, i wouldn't have come alone.
I've got something to show you.
Come with me.
Please?
All right.
Look, miranda, i'm going to be back in a minute.
I'm gonna go with zander, okay?
Come on... no, you're not getting a break until you're finished.
Hey.
We found our friend's car.
Found that, and the truck that hit him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're lying.
It was my husband's truck.
It happened over by where lewiston used to be.
That whole area spooks me.
Yeah?
Why's that?
It's just a story that folks tell, but i know there's truth to it.
Well, it used to be an abandoned mining town.
Yeah, well, i don't remember seeing any town there.
Exactly.
One day the whole place just... disappeared.
Just like brennan.
You know, you better be telling us the truth.
Because if our friend doesn't show up soon... i'm coming back for you and your husband.
I found these a few years back.
That's when i knew that everything the elders told us was a lie.
See?
Here are these pictures.
All different places, and... and people with strange costumes in them.
See, when i saw those marks on your arm, that's when i knew you were from out there, that these places were real.
I've dreamt about these places for years.
Maybe it's crazy, but i even dreamed that i could go out there myself.
I'll tell you what, zander, you get me out of this town, you can.
There's a whole world out there for you to explore.
Council finds out about you, you might disappear.
Hey, you know what?
Miranda talked about people disappearing.
I sometimes have to take people to council when they've lost their way.
You know, didn't believe, or even worse, spoke out against the town code.
Now council claims they've disappeared, but i know better.
They told them the way out of town was through the basement.
But there's no way out.
They just walked into the basement of the town hall and never came out.
What do you mean?
Well, i don't know what's down there, but i got a look one time.
It's... it's... it's all metal and... and lights, and glass... well, that's gotta be the force field generator.
You know what?
We gotta find a way out of here.
There's gotta be a way to stop that force field.
Well, there are other people we can trust, people who think like me.
One of them might be able to help.
You wait here.
I'll be back.
Wonder if i might have a word with you, zander.
That is, of course, unless you're here on official business.
Huh, what is it?
You're supposed to be a peacekeeper.
You're supposed to uphold town council's will.
I do.
You're helping the outsider.
Everything they told us was a lie, josh.
We can get outside the wall.
He's going to help us.
I'll get the others.
We need answers, adam.
Well, i've found some, but right now they don't make a lot of sense.
Try us.
Well, albert marcus, is a walking contradiction.
He was a scientist but he hated modern society.
Now, his dream was to create a self-sufficient community that was free of the negative influences of the outside world.
You can't just decide to not be influenced.
Well, now, wait.
Maybe you can.
See, one of the projects he was working on was a... it's kind of an electronic bubble.
It was an impenetrable force field that he could place over an entire town.
Oh, i don't like the sounds of this.
So this town that alfred marcus had his eye on was what?
Thirty miles west of edgarstown?
Exactly.
Lewiston.
That's right around where brennan disappeared.
We're on it, adam.
Zander's dead.
What are you talking about?
Ben gilbert killed zander.
He murdered him with his knife.
I saw the whole thing with my own eyes.
No.
Zander was going to turn him in to town council.
He wouldn't have done that.
I told you i saw it.
You don't even know anything about him, do you?
Okay, hey... miranda, listen.
Hey.
Now they're going to want to talk to you, okay, because you were with him.
But i can protect you, all right?
You just have to do the right thing.
Okay? - Okay.
This is right around where the lewiston town limits would be.
Cruise around, see what we can find.
Brennan? Brennan?
Brennan.
Yeah. Yeah, i'm up here.
The whole town's looking for you.
It's not safe here.
Where we going?
Don't worry. Just come with me.
What?
- Come with me.
Miranda, come here.
You shouldn't have killed zander, brennan.
He wouldn't have hurt you.
What?
I didn't kill anybody.
Take him.
You made yourself a big mistake... ben.
Pick him up.
Let's go.
Miranda! Miranda!
Miranda!
Let's proceed.
Ben gilbert, you are charged with a crime never before seen in new hope, the murder of another person.
Our beloved zander delassandro.
Zander was trying to help me, so why would i want to kill him?
This is your knife, is it not?
Yes.
Oh wait, no, no, no.
Someone took that from me!
Someone's trying to set me up.
Gerald.
Appreciate you coming down.
Yeah.
So, we'll make this quick.
Do you recognize this man?
That's my son, ben.
What?
That's not the truth.
That's not true.
Listen to me, that is not true.
I've never seen this man before in my life!
Enough!
We'll reconvene in five minutes.
Listen to me.
I'm telling the truth.
You did the right thing, gerald.
Just leave my family alone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey... remember, old man, our day's coming.
You ask me, that lady at the junk yard was holding out on us.
No, she wasn't.
Trust me.
Well, he couldn't have just disappeared into thin air, could he?
Maybe the air's not so thin after all.
Uh... ugh!
What the hell was that?
I'd say that's adam's bubble.
The satellite imagery that i'm picking up over the area is distorted by a powerful energy field.
We know.
Shalimar just hit the glass ceiling trying to find a way in.
So i guess somewhere in there is alfred marcus's little slice of heaven.
Brennan must've found a way in.
Well, then we gotta find a way to get him out.
You guys stay right there.
I think i might've just figured out a way to crack through the shield.
I'm on my way.
Copy that, adam.
We'll wait for you here.
We can't abandon everything because of one outsider.
We must ensure harmony.
We're doing the right thing.
Perhaps.
But how many times do we have to kill the truth before it stays dead?
Ben gilbert, because you failed to accept responsibility and remorse for the murder of zander delassandro and chose to hide behind lies and fantasy, blaspheming the foundations of new hope, we have no choice but to find you guilty.
Therefore, on this day, you will be put to death in town square, in front of the assembled citizens.
Huh...!
You can't do this.
I didn't kill zander!
You have to listen to me!
You're about to take your last breath, mr. Gilbert.
Make it a good show.
My name's not ben gilbert.
It's not ben gilbert!
It's brennan mulwray.
In a few minutes, it won't matter what the hell your name is.
I didn't do it!
You gotta listen to me!
I didn't do it!
Let's get this over with.
My name's not ben gilbert.
I didn't do it!
Hey, adam?
Almost ready with the payload.
Now, the night that brennan disappeared, i found out that there was a lightning storm that may have destabilized the dome long enough for him to slip through.
Yeah, we can't exactly wait for another storm.
No, exactly, which is why we're going to give mother nature a little helping hand by seeding the area with this supercharged silver iodide.
If there's any electricity in the air, that stuff is going to make it sizzle.
We're on target whenever you're ready.
Let's begin the seeding.
You can kill me but it's not going to stop the truth and you know it.
All those people that you think disappeared were murdered by the town council because they can't handle the truth.
You did a good thing, turning him in, miranda.
You're one of us.
We all did what we had to do.
You did the hard part, right?
Killing zander.
I didn't kill anybody.
Josh said that you did.
Well, he's lying.
It was him.
He said zander deserved it.
Whip the horses!
Do it!
Hah!
Hah!
Miranda!
Ah...!
This stops now!
You killed zander!
Let him go!
He's innocent!
Let him go!
Agghh!
Agghh!
What are you doing?
Ending this here and now.
Look... look, let him down.
Put him down.
Put him down!
Get me out of this... the outsider is not my son!
He's the one telling the truth.
This place has become a prison.
I don't know what you've become.
Uh!
Oh... thanks.
Agh...!
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!
<panting> you took a big chance helping me back there.
I did what was right.
Yeah, well, most people would've helped themselves.
You would've done the same for me.
I know it.
Brennan, we can't.
There's nowhere else to go, okay?
We need to try and stop this thing.
Miranda!
Miranda!
Miranda, open the door.
You're gonna die in there!
Come on, miranda!
<panting> what is it?
It's what creating your wall.
You know, i grew up in seattle.
I can't believe i'm actually praying for rain.
And rain's just a byproduct.
What we need is a good old-fashioned lightning storm.
Thunder... and lightning.
All right, it's time.
Let's fire this old bird up.
It's working.
Bring it on.
All right.
Everybody do me a favour, don't touch the hull.
Right now we're packing about a billion volts.
A billion, huh?
Come on, we need to stop it.
No.
Wait... of course, it'd have its own protection.
That's what happened to my father and the others, wasn't it?
Right there... right there.
Don't move!
Or i'll shoot her where she stands.
Come here! Come here!
Well, let's go.
You're keeping everybody waiting for the show.
Adam, we have to be powered up by now.
We're going to start losing the storm, adam.
All right, we're ready.
Firing and... now.
It won't work, josh.
Everybody knows that.
You can't make that go away.
I don't have to make it go away.
I just have to make you go away.
It's working.
I can see the town.
Emma, it's not good enough.
We need to take out the field generator, or it's going to power up again and trap us inside.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to keep it focused on the centre of the field.
That's where the generator has to be.
Okay.
Ready and firing... now.
I'm gonna miss you, miranda.
Ugh...
<panting> oh, my god.
You're right.
This can't be... ugh...!
Not this time, josh.
Brennan!
Well, you ready?
Brennan, i can't.
I'm not ready.
Well, i guess i understand.
I mean, your world just widened a million times over, right?
Stay with me.
I wish i could, but you know i can't.
I have a life.
You know, i have things that i have to do.
I know.
Well, when you're... when you're ready to see more of the world, you give me a call, huh.
I will.
Oh, man... it's like going from a fishbowl to the atlantic.
I kind of envy them.
Now they get a chance to experience a fresh new world.
I don't know.
I've been in that world my whole life.
I don't know how fresh it is.
I'll see you soon.
Okay.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, small town living's just not for me.
Didn't look like it from where i was standing.
Yeah, well, it has its moments.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not very good with good-byes.
Like shakespeare said,
"oh, brave new world... "

September 1939.
Ominous clouds of war may be gathering over Europe, but here in navarre, the young king-- seen here returning from military maneuvers-- has announced an audacious plan for himself and his court.
He and his companions are to cast off their military uniforms...
While world events still allow, and devote themselves instead...
To a rigorous three years of study.
That's right, three years.
They'll sleep little, eat and drink less...
And devote themselves instead to an inspiring program of self-improvement-- a real feast for bookworms.
Boldest of all, perhaps, is the king's absolute insistence...
That no women will be allowed inside the court.
Sorry, ladies, but he is the king.
There is just one exception-- madame holofernia, the king's principal tutor.
With her able assistant sir Nathaniel taking care of the men's spiritual health, they should have everything they need...
To distract themselves from thoughts of romance.
Whoops!
Careful, sir.
It's a tall order, by golly, but this able young monarch, one of Europe's most eligible royal bachelors, seems determined to show the world there's more to life than guns and warfare.
He's an idealist, but we wish him and his three chums the best.
We'll bring you more news as the adventure unfolds, but for now we wish them bon voyage and good luck.
You three-- berowne, dumaine...
And longaville...
Have sworn for three years term to live with me, my fellow scholars, and to keep those statutes that are recorded...
In this...
Schedule here.
Your oaths are passed, and now subscribe your names...
That his own hand may strike his honor down...
That violates the smallest branch herein.
If you are armed to do...
As sworn to do, subscribe to your deep oaths...
And keep it, too.
I am resolved.
'Tis but a three years' fast.
The mind shall banquet...
Though the body pine.
To love, to wealth, to pomp I pine and die, with all these living in philosophy.
So much, dear liege,
I have already sworn-- that is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term, and one day in a week to touch no food...
And but one meal on every day besides, and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to yawn of all the day?
Oh.
These are barren tasks, too hard to keep-- not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.
Your oath is passed to pass away from these.
Let me say no, my liege, and if you please,
I only swore to study with your grace...
And stay here in your court for three years' space.
You swore to that, berowne, and to the rest.
By yea and nay, sir.
Then I had swore in jest.
What is the end of study, let me know?
Why, that to know which else we should not know.
Things hid and barred, you mean, from common sense?
Aye, that is study's god-like recompense.
As thus-- to study where I well may dine...
When I to feast expressly am forbid, or study where to meet some mistress fine...
When mistresses from common sense are hid.
These be the stops that hinder study quite...
And train our intellects to vain delight.
Why, all delights are vain.
* I've seen for days that you've got some ways that must be checked *
* in you I never can detect *
* the slightest sign of intellect *
* your madam dances think of the chances you neglect *
* you never seem inclined to use your mind *
* you're just a fella who *
* has got his brains in his dancing shoes *
* take a lesson from me *
* I'd rather Charleston
* do-do, do-do
* do-do, do-do
* think of what you might be *
* I'd rather Charleston
* do-do, do-do
* do-do, do-do
* I'm disappointed in you and your ways *
* I'm double-jointed
* there's no sensation like syncopation *
* will you let me know why *
* I'd rather Charleston
* Charleston ?
* that's the sort of thing
I would never do, so *
* leave it behind and give your mind to something new *
* I'd rather Charleston
Charleston, Charleston *
* Charleston
Charleston with you * well, sit you out.
Go home, berowne.
Adieu.
No, my good lord.
I have sworn to stay with you.
But there are other strict observances.
"That no woman shall come within a mile of my court."
Hath this been proclaimed?
Four days ago.
Let's see the penalty.
"On pain of losing her tongue."
Who devised this penalty?
Marry, that did I.
Sweet lord, and why?
Well, to fright them hence with the dread penalty.
A dangerous law against gentility.
"Item: If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years,
"he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court...
Can possible devise."
This article, my liege, yourself must break, for well-- you know, here comes in embassy the French king's daughter...
With yourself to speak, a maid of grace and complete majesty...
About surrender up of aquitane to her decrepit, sick and bedrid father.
Therefore, this article is made in vain, or vainly comes the admired Princess hither.
Ah!
Ah!
What say you, lords?
Why, this was quite forgot.
We must of force dispense with this decree.
She must lie here on mere... necessity.
Necessity will make us all forsworn 3,000 times...
Within this three years space, for every man with his affects is born, not by might mastered, but by special grace.
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me.
I am forsworn on mere necessity.
So, to the laws at large,
I write my name and he that breaks them in the least degree...
Stands in attainder...
Of eternal shame.
Suggestions are to others as to me, but I believe-- although I seem so loath--
I am the last that will last...
Break his oath.
Good boyet, you are not ignorant all-telling fame.
Doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow...
Till painful study shall outwear three years, no woman may approach his silent court.
Therefore, to us it seemeth a needful course, before we enter his forbidden gates, to know his pleasure, and in that behalf, bold of your worthiness, we single you as our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him the daughter of the king of France, on serious business, craving quick dispatch...
Importunes personal conference with his grace.
Proud of employment, willingly I go.
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Who are the votaries, my loving maids, that are vow-fellows with this virtuous Duke?
Lord longaville is one.
Know you the man?
I know him, madam.
At a marriage feast in normandy saw I this longaville.
Who are the rest?
The young dumaine.
I saw him at the Duke alencon's once.
Another of these students at that time was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Berowne they call him.
God bless my ladies, are they all in love?
Here comes boyet!
What admittance, lord?
Navarre had notice of your fair approach, and he and his competitors in oath...
Were all addressed to meet you, gentle lady, before I came.
Marry, thus much have I learned.
He rather means to...
Lodge you...
In the field.
Fair Princess, welcome to the court of navarre.
"Fair" I give you back again, and welcome
I have not yet.
The roof of this court is too high to be yours, and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
I will be welcome then.
Conduct me thither.
Hear me, dear lady.
I have sworn an oath.
Our lady, help my lord.
He'll be forsworn.
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
Why, will shall break it.
Will and nothing else.
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
Were my lord so his ignorance were wise.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord, and sin to break it.
Ahh! But pardon me.
I am too sudden bold...
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming and suddenly resolve me in my suit.
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
You will the sooner that I were away, for you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
Sir, I pray you, a word.
What lady is that same?
The heir of alencon-- mm-hmm.
Katherine her name.
A gallant lady!
Monsieur, fare you well.
It's Katherine.
Ahem. I beseech you, a word.
What is she in the green?
A woman sometimes if by daylight she's seen.
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
Her mother's,
I have heard.
God's blessing on your beard!
Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of falconbridge.
Nay.
My choler is ended.
She...
Is a most sweet lady.
Not unlike, sir.
That may be.
Um-- what's her name in the cap?
Rosaline, by good hap.
Is she wedded or no?
To her will, sir, or so.
Oh, you are welcome, sir.
Adieu.
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
Madam, your father here doth intimate the payment of a 100,000 crowns, being but the one half of an entire sum...
Dispersed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we as neither have...
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid a 100,000 more.
You do the king, my father, too much wrong...
And wrong the reputation of your name...
In so unseeming to confess receipt of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
I do protest I never heard of it, and if you prove it,
I'll repay it back or yield up aquitane.
We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances for such a sum.
Satisfy me so.
So please your grace, the packet is not come where that and other specialties are bound.
Tomorrow you shall have a sight of them.
It shall suffice me.
Meantime, receive such welcome...
At my hand as honor...
Without breach of honor may make tender of to thy true worthiness.
You may not come, fair Princess, within my gates.
But here without, you shall be so received as you shall deem yourself...
Lodged in my heart.
Tomorrow shall we visit you again?
Did not I dance with you in brabant once?
Did not I dance with you in brabant once?
I know you did.
How needless was it then to as the question?
* I won't dance don't ask me *
* I won't dance don't ask me *
* I won't dance, monsieur, with you *
* my heart won't let my feet do things *
* they should do
* you know what you're lovely *
* and so what
I'm lovely *
* but oh what you do to me *
* I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore *
* I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor *
* when you dance you're charming and you're gentle *
* especially when you do the continental *
* but this feeling isn't purely mental *
* for heaven rest us
I'm not asbestos *
* and that's why
* I won't dance why should I *
* I won't dance how could I *
* I won't dance merci beaucoup *
* I know that music leads the way to romance *
* so if I hold you in my arms *
* I won't dance
If my observation, which very seldom lies...
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes deceive me not now, navarre is infected.
With what?
With that which we lovers entitle
"affected."
Your reason?
His face's own margin did quote such amazes...
That all I saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you aquitane and all that is his...
And you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
Come to our pavilion.
Boyet is disposed!
But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye by adding a tongue, which I know will not lie.
Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skillfully!
Do you hear, my mad wenches?
No!
What then, do you see?
Aye.
Our way to be gone.
You are too hard for me.
Royals camping.
The Princess of France enjoys an unexpected taste of the outdoors tonight.
All women are banned from the court of navarre, and her royal highness is no exception.
It means a night under canvas for the ladies.
The king's proclamation continues to make life tricky for the people of navarre.
Uh-oh, there's trouble afoot.
Look at this motley crew.
They're led by the fantastical spaniard, Don armado.
His heart may be in the right place, but his language is all over the place.
Loyally he follows the king.
It's just unfortunate...
That when he speaks, the king can't always follow armado.
Thank goodness for his trusty page, the strangely named moth.
These two seem to have brought a criminal to book.
And I'll wager if there's trouble in store, that rascal costard is involved.
He's the king's resident comedian.
This cheeky chappie has played the vaudeville houses from Broadway to baden baden.
He's also been known to play fast and loose with the ladies.
Watch out, girls.
Whatever the problem, the king can always rely on his local Bobby.
Constable dull always gets his man, or in this case, something rather different, if that paper bag is hiding what we think it is.
In any case, it's another headache for the king.
Let the trial begin.
Ahem.
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning jaquenetta.
The manner of it is,
I was taken with the manner.
In what manner?
Ahh! In manner and form following, sir.
I was, uh, seen with her in the manor house, sitting with her upon the form, and taken following her into the park, which, put together, is in manner and form following.
From the west corner of thy curious knotted garden.
There did I see that low-spirited swain...
The base minnow of thy mirth, me?
That unlettered, small-knowing soul, me?
That shallow vessel, still me?
Which, as I remember, is costard!
Oh, me.
Sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon, with-- with-- o, with but with this I passion to say wherewith!
With a wench.
With a child of our grandmother Eve-- a female.
Or, for thy more sweet understanding, ahh!
A woman!
Ooh!
I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on, have brought to thee to receive the meed of punishment...
By thy good grace's officer
Anthony dull, a man of good repute, courage, bearing and estimation.
O, me.
I am dull.
For jaquenetta so...
Is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended...
With the aforesaid swain.
I keep her as a vessel of thy law's fury...
And shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring her to trial.
Thine in all compliments...
Of devoted and heart-burning heat of duty...
Don adriano de armado!
Sirrah, what say you to this?
Sir, i-- i--
I-- whoa!
I confess the wench.
Did you hear the proclamation?
I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the marking of it.
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a wench.
I was taken with none, sir.
I was taken with a damsel.
Well, it was proclaimed damsel.
This was no damsel, neither, sir.
She was a virgin.
It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed a virgin.
If it were,
I deny her virginity.
I was taken with a maid.
This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
This maid will serve my turn, sir.
Sir...
I will pronounce your sentence.
You shall fast a week with bran and water.
I'd rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
And Don armado shall be your keeper.
And the situation in Europe is worsening, with news of mobilization of troops on the French border.
Reports are coming in that the peace accord between the two countries...
Signed last month is in danger of collapse.
Military buildup on the French northern borders indicate that an invasion--
Boy, what sign is it...
When a man of great spirit grows melancholy?
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
Pretty and apt.
I have promised to study three years with the king.
But you are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
I confess both.
They are both the varnish of a complete man.
A most fine figure.
I will hereupon confess...
I am in love, and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am in love with a base wench.
Boy, I do love that country girl...
That I took in the park with the rational hind costard.
Sing, boy.
My spirit grows heavy in love.
* my story is much too sad to be told *
* but practically everything *
* leaves me totally cold *
* the only exception
I know is the case *
* when I'm out on a quiet spree *
* fighting vainly the old ennui *
* and I suddenly turn and see *
* your fabulous face
* I get no kick from champagne *
* mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all *
* so tell me why should it be true *
* that I get a kick out of you *
* I get no kick from cocaine *
* I'm sure that if
I took even one sniff *
* that would bore me terrifically too *
* yet I get a kick out of you *
* I get a kick every time I see you *
* standing there before me *
* I get a kick though it's clear to me *
Ow !
* you obviously don't adore me *
* I get no kick in a plane *
* flying too high with some girl in the sky *
* it's my idea of nothing to do *
* yet I get a kick
* I'm sure it's a kick aah !
* I get a kick out of you *
Aah!
Sir, the king's pleasure is that you keep costard safe...
And you must suffer him to take no delight, but he must fast...
Three days a week.
For this damsel, I must keep her at the lodge.
Fare thee well.
Maid.
Man.
I will visit thee at the lodge.
That's nearby.
I know where it is situated.
Lord, how wise you are.
I shall tell thee wonders.
With that face?
I love thee.
So...
I heard you say.
* I wake up every morning with a smile on my face *
* everything in its place as it should be *
* I start out every morning just as free as the breeze *
* my cares upon the shelf because I find myself *
* with no strings no connections *
* no ties to my affections *
* I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy *
* no dates that can't be broken *
* no words that can't be spoken *
* especially when I am feeling romancey *
* like a Robin upon a tree *
* like a sailor that goes to sea *
* like an unwritten melody
* I'm free, that's me
* bring on the big attraction *
* my decks are cleared for action *
* I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy *
* bring on the big attraction *
* my decks are cleared for action *
* I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy *
Sirrah!
Costard!
Bear this significant...
To the country maid jaquenetta.
There is...
"Remunerathion."
Now will I look to his "remunerathion."
"Remunerathion."
Oh, that's the Latin word for three farthings.
My good knave costard-- aah!
Exceedingly well met.
Oh, pray you, sir.
How much carnation ribbon...
May a man buy for a "remunerathion"?
What's a-- what's a "remunerathion"?
Marry, sir, half-penny farthing.
Why, then, three farthing worth of silk.
Ah. I thank your worship.
God be with you. Mwah!
Stay, slave,
I must employ thee.
As thou wilt win my favor, good my knave, do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
When would you have it done, sir?
This afternoon.
Well, I will do it, sir. Fare you well.
Thou knowest not what it is!
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
Why, villain, thou must know first.
I will come to your worship tomorrow morning.
It must be done this afternoon!
Hark, slave!
It is but this!
I-- it is but this.
The Princess comes to hunt here in the park, and in her train there is a gentle lady.
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name, and rosaline they call her.
Ugh!
Ask for her.
And to her white hand see thou do commend this sealed-up counsel.
Hmm?
Ahem.
There's thy guerdon.
Go.
Guerdon!
Oh, sweet guerdon!
Better than "remunerathion."
Oh, eleven pence farthing better!
Most sweet guerdon!
I shall do it, sir!
In print!
Whoa!
Ha ha!
Pray you, which is the, uh, head lady?
Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
The thickest and the tallest.
The thickest and the tallest.
Oh. Are you not the chief woman?
Hmm? You are the thickest here.
Ohh!
What's your will, sir, what's your will?
Hmm.
I have... a letter.
Whoa!
A letter from monsieur berowne to one lady rosaline.
Boyet, you can carve.
Break up this capon.
I am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook.
It importeth none here.
It is writ to jaquenetta.
I do affect the very ground...
Which is base, where her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot which is basest doth tread!
"Thine in the dearest design of industry,
Don adriano de armado."
Did you ever hear better?
Thou, fellow, a word.
Who gave thee this letter?
I told you, my lord!
I-- to whom shouldst thou give it?
From my lord to my lady.
From which lord to which lady?
From my lord berowne, a good master of mine, to a lady of France...
That he called
"rosalini"?
Thou hast mistaken his letter.
Come, friends, away!
Ohh.
Guerdon?
"Remunerathion."
Whoo!
Thou monster ignorance, how deformed dost thou look.
Madam, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book.
He hath not eat paper, as it were.
He hath not drunk ink.
His intellect is not replenished.
He's only an animal.
Only sensible in the...
Duller parts.
And such barren plants are set before us...
That we thankful should be, which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that do fructify...
In us more than he.
Good master parson, be so good as to read me this letter.
It was given me by costard and sent to me from Don armado.
I beseech you, read it.
What are the contents?
What, my soul?
Verses?
Ay, madam.
And very learned.
Let me hear a staff, a stanza, a verse.
* someday
* when I'm awfully low
* when the world is cold
* I will feel a glow just thinking of you *
* and the way you look tonight *
* oh, but you're lovely
* with your smile so warm
* and your cheek so soft
* there is nothing for me but to love you *
* just the way you look tonight *
* with each word your tenderness grows *
* tearing my fear apart
* and that laugh that wrinkles your nose *
* touches my foolish heart
* lovely
* never, never change
* keep that breathless charm *
* won't you please arrange it *
* 'cause I love you
* just the way you look tonight *
* just the way you look *
* tonight
A rare talent.
This is a gift that I have.
Simple, simple.
A foolish, extravagant spirit...
Full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions.
These are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion.
But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it.
Madam, I praise the lord for you, and so may my parishioners.
For their daughters are well tutored by you...
Mmm.
And their sons profit very greatly under you.
But domicella, virgin, was this directed to you?
Aye, madam.
I will overglance the superscript.
"To the snow-white hand of the most beauteous lady... rosaline."
I will look again on the intellect of the letter...
For the nomination of the party writing to the person written unto.
"Your ladyship's in all desired employment, berowne."
Sir Nathaniel, this berowne is one of the votaries with the king, and here he hath framed a letter...
To a sequent of the stranger Princess, which, accidentally or by way of progression...
Hath miscarried.
Trip and go, my sweet.
Deliver this paper into the royal hand of the king.
It may concern much!
Have with thee, my girl!
Madam, you have done this in the fear of god...
Very religiously.
But to return to the--
* verses did they please you, sir Nathaniel?
Marvelous well.
Hmm.
I beseech your...
Society.
And thank you too, for society, saith the text, is the happiness of life.
By the lord, this love is as mad as...
Ajax.
It kills sheep.
Kills me.
I a sheep!
Hmph.
I will not love.
If I do, hang me.
I' faith, I will not.
Oh, but her eye!
By this light, but for her eye
I would not love her.
Yes, for her two eyes.
Well, I did nothing in the world but lie, and lie in my throat.
By heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to rhyme...
And to be melancholy and here is part of my rhyme...
And here my melancholy.
Well, she hath one of my sonnets already.
The clown bore it, the fool sent it and the lady hath it.
Sweet clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady.
By the world,
I would not care a pin if the other three were in.
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
* how glad the many millions *
* of anabels and lillians would be * mmm.
* to capture me
* but you with your persistence *
* you wore down my resistance *
* I fell
* and it was swell
* I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo *
* how you won me
* I shall never, never
* know
Now in thy likeness one more fool appear.
* it's not that you're attractive *
* but ooh, my heart grew active *
* when you came into view
* I've got a crush on you *
* sweetie pie
* all the day and nighttime *
* hear me sigh
* I never had the least notion *
* that I could fall with
* so much emotion
* could you coo
* could you care
* for a country cottage
* we could share
* the world will pardon my mush *
* 'cause I've got a crush my baby on you *
* the world will pardon my mush *
* 'cause I've got a crush my baby *
* my baby
* a crush, my baby on you *
Dumaine!
Thy love is far from charity.
You may look pale, but I should blush, huh?
I know.
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
Come, sir!
You blush!
As his, your case is such.
You chide at him, offending twice as much.
I have been closely shrouded in this bush!
And marked you both, and for you both did blush.
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion, saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion.
What will berowne say...
When that he shall hear faith so infringed...
Which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn?
How will he spend his wit?
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it?
For all the wealth that ever I did see,
I would not have him know so much by me.
Ah !
Good, my liege.
I pray thee pardon me!
Good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove...
These worms for loving that art most in love?
Are we betrayed thus to thy overview?
Not you to me, but I...
Betrayed by you.
I that am...
Honest,
I that hold it sin...
To break the vow...
I am engaged in.
I am betrayed by keeping company...
With men like you, men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme...
Or groan for Joan?
When shall you hear that I...
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye, a gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist, a leg, a limb?
Soft, whither away so fast?
God bless the king!
What present hast thou there?
Some certain treason.
What makes treason here?
I beseech your grace, let this letter be read.
Our parson misdoubts it.
'Twas treason, he said.
Berowne?
Read it over.
Where hadst thou it?
Of costard!
Where hadst thou it?
Of dun adrama, dun adrama--
Don arbnar-- carbonara-- the Don.
How now, what is in you?
Why dost thou tear it?
A toy, my liege, a toy.
Your grace need not fear it.
It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it!
It is berowne's writing.
And here is his name!
Aah!
You whoreson loggerhead, you were born to do me shame!
Guilty, my lord, guilty!
I confess. I confess.
What?
That you three fools lacked me to make up the mess.
He, he and you, e'en you, my liege and I...
Are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die.
Oh, dismiss this audience and I shall tell you more.
Now the number is even.
True, true.
We are four.
Will these turtles be gone?
Hence. Sirs, away.
Walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay.
Have at you then affection's men-at-arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto.
To fast.
To study.
And to see no woman.
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast?
Your stomachs are too young...
And abstinence engenders maladies.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you, have found the ground of study's excellence?
Without the beauty of a woman's face, from woman's eyes this doctrine I derive.
They are the ground, the books, the academes...
From whence doth spring the true promethean fire.
O we have made a vow to study, lords, and in that vow, we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you, in leaden contemplation have found out...
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes...
Of beauty's tutors have enriched you with.
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain, and therefore finding barren practicers...
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil.
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes, lives not alone immured in the brain, but with the motion of all elements.
Courses as swift as thought in every power, and gives to every power a double power...
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound.
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible...
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails.
Love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste.
For valour is not love a Hercules, still climbing trees in the hesperides.
Subtle as sphinx, as sweet and musical, as bright Apollo's lute strung with his hair.
And when love speaks, the voice of all the gods...
Make heaven drowsy with the Harmony.
* heaven

* and my heart beats so

Shall we... resolve to woo these girls of France?
And win them too?
Therefore, let us devise some entertainment for them in their tents.
First, from the park, let us conduct them thither.
Then, homeward, every man attach the hand of his fair mistress.
In the afternoon, we will with some strange pastime, solace them, such as the shortness of the time can shape.
For revels, dances, masques and merry hours...
Forerun fair love, strewing her way with flowers.
Away, away! No time shall be omitted...
That will be time and may by us be fitted.
Yes!
While the rest of Europe braces itself for imminent catastrophe, here in navarre, all seems quiet.
Rumors abound that the king's oath may have been broken by more than a few of the natives.
Not much evidence of study, that's for sure.
Hello?
What's he up to?
Discussing what to do in the blackout, perhaps?
And what about these mystery gifts?
The Princess and her ladies seem to have had a visit from the postman.
Love letters?
Surely the king's men can't be involved.
Rumors too of a gala entertainment for this very evening.
Was singing and dancing included in the oath?
I don't think so.
But if the king plans a party, then everyone must follow.
And who better to arrange an exotic night...
Than an exotic knight, armado's your man.
And with the helpful hand of holofernia...
Heaving the hurrahs into a heaven of hysterical fun, who knows what these revellers will dream up ?
Ahh!
- Bravo!
- Sweethearts, we shall be rich ere we depart.
Look you what I have from the loving king.
But, rosaline, you have a favor too.
Who sent it?
And what is it?
Nay, I have verses too.
I thank berowne.
O he hath drawn my picture in his letter.
- Anything like?
- Oh!
But, Katherine, what was sent to you from fair dumaine?
Madam, this glove.
This and these pearls to me sent longaville.
Oh, we are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
Here comes boyet, and mirth is in his face.
Arm, wenches, arm.
Encounters mounted are against your peace.
Love doth approach disguised, armed in arguments.
Oh, you'll be surprised.
Under the cool shade of a sycamore,
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour, when lo, to interrupt my purposed rest, toward that shade
I might behold addressed the king...
And his companions.
Warily, I stole into a neighbor thicket by...
And overheard what you shall overhear, that by and by disguised, they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page.
But what-- but what come they to visit us?
They do. They do.
And are apparelled thus, like, masked delights or revellers, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parley, court and dance.
And every one his love-suit will advance unto his several mistress, which they'll know by favors several, which they did bestow.
And will they so?
The gallants shall be tasked.
For, ladies, we will every one be masked.
And not a man of them shall have the grace, despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine.
So shall berowne take me for rosaline.
And you change your favors too...
So shall your loves woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
Come on, then.
Wear the favors most in sight.
But in this changing, what is your intent?
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
They do it but in mockery-merriment, and mock for mock is only my intent.
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen as is the razor's edge invisible, cutting a smaller hair than may be seen.
By changing partners for the masquerade, they'll undermine the gentlemen's charade.
* there may be trouble ahead *
* but while there's moonlight and music and love and romance *
* let's face the music and dance *
* before the fiddlers have fled *
* before they ask us to pay the bill *
* and while we still have the chance *
* let's face the music and dance *
* soon we'll be without the moon *
* humming a different tune and then *
* there may be teardrops to shed *
* so while there's moonlight and music and love and romance *
* let's face the music and dance, dance *
* let's face the music and dance *
* soon we'll be without the moon *
* humming a different tune and then *
* there may be teardrops to shed *
* so while there's moonlight and music and love and romance *
* let's face the music and dance, dance *
* let's face the music and dance * are these the breed of wits so wondered at ?
But will you hear?
The king is my love sworn.
And quick berowne hath plighted faith to me.
And longaville was for my service born.
Dumaine is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
Madam and pretty mistresses, give ear.
Immediately they will again be here in their own shapes.
For it can never be, they will digest this harsh indignity.
Will they return?
O they will, they will.
God knows.
Avaunt, perplexity.
What shall we do if they return in their own shapes to woo?
Good, madam, if by me you'll be advised.
Let's mock them still, as well known as disguised.
Let us complain to them what fools were here.
Ladies, withdraw.
The gallants are at hand.
Fair, sir, god save you.
Where's the-- where's the Princess?
Gone, to her tent.
Ah.
Please it, your majesty, command me any service to her thither.
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
I will and so will she.
I know, my lord.
We came to visit you and purpose now to lead you to our court.
- Vouchsafe it, then.
- Now by my maiden honor, yet as pure as the unsullied Lily,
I protest a world of torments though I should endure.
I would not yield to be your house's guest.
So much I hate a breaking cause to be of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.
Oh.
You have lived in desolation here.
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
Not so, my lord.
It is not so, I swear.
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game.
How, madam?
In truth, my lord.
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
Madam speak true.
Here they stayed an hour and talked apace.
And in that hour, my lord, they did not bless us with one happy word.
- Which of the visors was it that you wore?
- Where?
When?
What visors?
Why demand you this?
There, then, that visor, that superfluous case, that hid the worse and showed the better face.
We were descried.
They'll mock us now.
Downright.
Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
Amazed, my lord?
Why looks your highness sad?
Why look you pale?
I see the trick.
Here was a consent.
Knowing aforehand of our merriment, to dash it like a Christmas comedy.
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany, some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some dick.
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick...
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed...
Told our intents before, which once disclosed, the ladies did change favors.
And then we, following the signs, wooed but the sign of she.
Ladies and gentlemen, in honor of her royal highness, costard and the people of navarre will give a special performance in one minute.
One minute.
Berowne, they will shame us.
Let them not approach.
We are shame-proof, my lord.
And 'tis some policy to have one show worse than the king's and his company.
Well, it's not the first time the ladies have turned the tables on the boys, but their cunning plan to change masks, change partners and dance...
Made those red-faced boys really face the music.
But all is forgiven as oaths are forgotten, and it's show time.
"The pageant of the nine worthies" is given a rousing treatment...
By the people of navarre.
It's high jinks all round.
Whoops ! Careful, sir.
Hmm, bet that hurt.
Masks and faces make this merry crowd...
Forget the grim events of the outside world.
Hey, look out, Johnny.
No more study for these men.
They're in the love business, and there's no business like it.
But perhaps some might just disagree.
* the butcher, the Baker the grocer, the clerk *
* are secretly unhappy men because *
* the butcher, the Baker the grocer, the clerk *

* they'd gladly bid their dreary jobs good-bye *

God save you, madam.
Welcome, mercade.
But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
I am sorry, madam, for the news I bring is heavy in my tongue.
The king, your father.
Dead.
For my life.
Even so.
My tale is told.
Worthies, away.
The scene begins to cloud.
How fares your majesty?
Boyet, prepare.
I will away tonight.
Madam, not so.
I do beseech you stay.
Prepare, I say.
Thank you, gracious lords, for all your fair endeavors...
And entreat out of a new sad soul...
That you vouchsafe in your rich wisdom...
To excuse or hide the liberal opposition of our spirits.
If overboldly we have borne ourselves in the converse of breath, your gentleness was guilty of it.
Farewell, worthy lord.
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
Excuse me so coming too short of thanks...
For your great suit so easily obtained.
The extreme parts of time extremely forms all causes to the purpose of his speed.
And often at his very loose decides that which long process could not arbitrate.
And though the mourning brow of progeny forbid the smiling courtesy of love, the holy suit which fain it would convince.
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot, let not the cloud of sorrow jostle it for what it purposed.
I understand you not.
My griefs are double.
Honest, plain words best Pierce the ear of grief...
And by these badges understand the king.
For your fair sakes, have we neglected time.
Played foul play with our oaths.
Your beauty, ladies, hath much deformed us fashioning our humors.
Even to the opposed end of our intents...
And what in us hath seemed ridiculous.
Those heavenly eyes that look into those faults, suggested us to make them.
Therefore, ladies, our love being yours, the error that love makes is likewise yours.
We have received your letters full of love.
Your favors the ambassadors of love.
And in our maiden council, rated them at courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy...
As bombast and as lining to the time.
But more devout than this in our respects, have we not been, and therefore met your loves in their own fashion, like a merriment.
Our letters, madam, showed much more than jest.
So did our looks.
We did not quote them so.
Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Grant us your loves.
A time, methinks, too short...
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much.
Full of dear guiltiness...
And therefore this:
If for my love as there is no such cause, you will do aught.
This shall you do for me.
Your oath,
I will not trust.
But go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage.
There stay until the 12 celestial signs...
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere, insociable life...
Change not your offer made in heat of blood, then at the expiration of the year, come challenge me.
Challenge me by these desserts.
And by this virgin palm now kissing thine,
I will be thine.
And till that instance, shut my woeful self up in a mourning house, raining the tears of lamentation...
For the remembrance of my father's death.
Hence hermit, then...
My heart...
Is in thy breast.
What says Maria?
At the twelvemonth's end...
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
I'll stay with Patience, but the time is long.
A twelvemonth and a day,
I'll Mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say.
Come when the king doth to my lady come.
Then, if I have much love,
I'll give you some.
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
Yet, swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
Mistress, look on me.
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye.
What humble suit attends thy answer there.
Impose some service on me for thy love.
Oft have I heard of you, my lord berowne, before I saw you, and the world's large tongue...
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks.
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts, which you on all estates will execute...
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain, and therewithal to win me, if you please.
Without the which,
I am not to be won.
You shall, this twelvemonth term from day to day, visit the speechless sick...
And still converse with groaning wretches.
And your task shall be, with all the fierce endeavor of your wit, to enforce the pained impotent to smile.
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be.
It is impossible.
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit, whose influence is begot of that loose grace, which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it, never in the tongue of him that makes it.
Then, if sickly ears, deafed with the clamor of their own dear groans, will hear your idle scorns, continue then, and I will have you...
And that fault withal.
But, if they will not throw away that spirit, and I shall find you empty of that fault, right joyful of your reformation.
A twelvemonth?
Well...
Befall what will befall.
I'll jest a twelvemonth...
In an... hospital.
Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave.
No, madam.
We will bring you on your way.
Our wooing doth not end like an old play.
Jack hath not Jill.
Come, sir. It wants a twelvemonth and a day, and then 'twill end.
That's too long for a play.
Sir.

You that way, we this way.
And when love speaks, the voice of all the gods...
Make heaven drowsy with the Harmony.
From women's eyes, this doctrine I derive.
They are the books, the arts, the academes...
That show, contain and nourish...
All the world.

Grandma.
Your eggs.
It's Billy.
Come on.
Fuck.
- You been playing my records, you twat?
- I never played naught.
Knobhead.
If Dad knew you smoked that stuff, he'd go mental.
Fuck off, will ya!
Little twat.
Here we go, Dad. Come on, man.
Dad!
Hurry up, Dad, man. We'll be late.
I'm telling you, the whole world will be on that picket line this morning.
Have you tidied our room? Dad!
There's not much coal left.
That's fine.
We'll be digging it up again next month.
Don't kid yourself.
I'm not waiting for you.
Tony!
See you down the picket line, Dad.
Leave it, Billy.
Mom would have let us.
Your 50 pence is on the fridge.
Scab, scab, scab!
- Are you sure you're not going to come?
- Am I fuck.
- It's a right load of old bollocks.
- It's not.
It's a load of shite, kicking people in.
I don't know why you bother.
- I'm good at it.
- Are you shite.
- Look at them gloves. They're outdated.
- They're me dad's, these.
Exactly.
Right, lads. Listen up here.
Hold it. Right.
Here.
Now, because they're using downstairs...
...as a soup kitchen for the striking miners...
...I'm gonna let Mrs. Wilkinson...
...use the bottom end of the boxing hall for her ballet lessons.
So, no hanky-panky, understood?
Yes.
Elliot, you're late.
Get changed and get in here.
Right then, lads.
Give it all you got. Round one.
Don't just stand there, Elliot.
Not again. This is man-to-man combat, not a bloody tea dance.
What are you doing, man? Hit him!
He's just pissing about.
Get stuck in and give him a belt.
He's like a fanny in a fit.
Billy, hit him!
Jesus Christ, Billy Elliot!
You're a disgrace to them gloves...
...your father, and the traditions of this boxing hall.
You owe us 50 pence.
Ho! Liberace!
Will you give it a rest?
Billy, punch bag.
You're not going until you do it properly.
Shit.
Give these to Mrs. Wilkinson and her class when you're done. I'll see you next week.
Okay, girls. Left hand on the bar.
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite.
Pretty arms.
Bottoms in.
Where are you looking, Susan?
Lift. Feel the music. Feel it.
In time, Debbie, please.
And one, and two, and three, and four...
...and five, six, seven, eight.
And one, and two, and three, and four...
...five.
And hold.
Hold it.
Support yourselves.
Don't look at me. Look ahead.
Where's your confidence? Come on.
And down.
Connie.
Oh, God.
And Debbie, eyes front.
And five, and six, and seven, and stop.
For God's sake.
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite.
Right, into the center, girls, please.
Miss?
- Miss, the keys.
- Not now.
Right, Mr. Braithwaite.
The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow.
Fat chance.
Ready, and...
Port de bras forward...
...and up.
Port de bras forward...
...and up.
Why don't you join in?
Port de bras forward...
...and up...
...and hold.
And three, and four, and Debbie, straight leg...
...seven and eight.
And one, and two, and three, and four...
...and five... Boots off!
Seven and eight. What size are you?
- Miss, what about the keys?
- Into the center.
Go on, I dare you.
Prepare.
And one, and two, and three, and four...
...and five, and six, and...
And eight, and hold.
Hold it.
What have we got here, then?
Heel out.
Drop your hip.
Nice...
...straight leg.
Good arch.
Turn that leg out.
Right. Class dismissed.
Hometime.
Debbie, get the 50 pences.
- You owe me 50 pence.
- No, I don't!
You do.
Why don't you bring it along next week?
I can't. I'm going to boxing.
- But you're crap at boxing.
- No, I'm not!
Shut up.
I thought you enjoyed it.
Please yourself, darling.
"Dancing in my tails"
He was your mom's favorite, was Fred Astaire.
We used to watch him at the Palace Picture House...
...and then dance around the front room like lunatics.
Marvelous!
Mind, they used to say
I could have been a professional.
Come on, Grandma. Not now.
Grandma!
It's this one here!
Grandma!
It's over here!
Tony?
- Do you ever think about death?
- Fuck off!
Night-night, then.
Plenty of boys do ballet, you know.
Do they now? What boys do ballet?
Nobody around here, but plenty of men do.
Poofs.
Not necessarily poofs.
Who, like?
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He's not a poof.
He's as fit as an athlete.
- Bet he couldn't beat Daley Thompson.
- Maybe not in a race, but in stamina.
- Come tomorrow. You can just watch.
- I can't.
Gotta go to boxing, haven't I?
Please yourself, then.
See you around.
Aye. See ya.
Right, lads. Look sharp. Everybody out.
Turn, turn and stop.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Arms are in fifth.
One, two, three.
Turn, turn and stop.
One, two, three. Where are those arms?
- I don't know what to do.
- Follow the others.
Shut up, Debbie. One, two, three.
Nice pretty arms. And stop.
See? I told you it takes loads of practice.
- Debbie.
- What, Mom?
- What do you call me?
- Miss.
Shove off!
So, do we get the pleasure of your company next week?
It's just...
...I feel like a right sissy.
Well, don't act like one.
Fifty pence, please.
If you're not coming again, give us your shoes.
- You're all right.
- Right.
What are you doing, going around like creeping Jesus?
Naught.
They found your nanna in the Spar stores.
Where have you been?
Boxing. Where do you think?
What are you doing?
- I forgot me gloves.
- They were my dad's gloves.
You better take better care of them, okay?
Copy down that diagram.
You only have five minutes left.
Hurry. This way.
You're going to ballet every week?
- Yeah, but don't tell.
- Why do you need to take lessons?
Why do you think?
To get better, you divvy.
- Do you get to wear a tutu?
- Fuck off!
They're only meant for lasses.
I wear me shorts.
- You want to ask for a tutu.
- What for?
- To dance in.
- I'd look a right dickhead.
I think you'd look wicked.
Come on.
I don't know why you're looking at that.
You can't take that out on a junior ticket.
Come on!
See you, then.
Okay, Billy Elliot, he's the center.
Right, I want you to watch carefully, girls.
First, arabesque.
Drop your shoulders.
Look forward, beyond your fingertips.
There.
Right. Spin it, Mr. Braithwaite. Spin it.
Come on! Spin it!
Now, focus.
Look at yourselves! Look in the mirror!
Christ almighty! What was that?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Prepare one, and two. Strong position.
Weight on both legs.
Pirouette, and down.
Up you get.
Find a place on that bloody wall...
...and focus on that spot.
Then whip your head round and come back to that spot.
Prepare!
- One, and two, and...
- Fuck it.
Have you got the spot?
Prepare.
- Prepare!
- Prepare.
Go!
Go, Billy!
What have I told you about that arm?
Right. Back to the bar.
You look like a right wanker to me, son.
Listen, it was just 50 pence a session, you know.
I can do without it.
I don't do it for the money.
- What are you talking about?
- The boxing.
I haven't seen hide nor hair of Billy for months.
I was gonna say something, but I thought it might be embarrassing.
First, I knew about it.
He's never got the gloves off.
Send him round to my house.
I'll knock some sense into him.
Scab! Scab!
Step, open and balancé.
Balancé.
Scab, scab, scab!
Right. Let's do it again.
Open and lift your chest.
Let's do it again.
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite. Step...
Open your arms. Do it.
Pay attention.
Arms like this. All right?
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite. Step really...
...open.
Powerful! Proud.
You're not concentrating.
- Yes, I am concentrating.
- You're not even trying.
Can we have a go at it, Miss?
Let's do it again.
Listen, have you noticed anything weird about Billy lately?
What are you after, like, a list?
Got enough food there, scab?
What are you doing?
- Scabs eat well, eh?
- You're me best mate.
First rule of a union, Gary, you never cross a picket line.
- We're all fucked if you forget that!
- We're fucked anyway.
In a speech to Tory MPs yesterday...
...Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
referred to members...
...of the striking National Union
of Mine Workers...
...as the "enemy within."
The speech comes following
several months of violent clashes...
...between police officers
and striking miners.
- See you, then.
- Wait. Your breakfast...
What the hell's he up to?
One, two, three, pas de bourrée.
And one, two, three, and a turn.
And one, two, three, pas de bourrée.
You, out!
Now!
I beg your pardon?
Please, Miss.
Don't.
All right, which way are we facing?
Come on.
And one...
...two, three, pas de bourrée.
Ballet?
What's wrong with ballet?
What's "wrong" with ballet?
It's perfectly normal.
"Perfectly normal"?
I used to go to ballet.
See?
Aye, for your nanna.
For girls, not for lads, Billy.
Lads do football, or...
...boxing, or...
...wrestling.
Not frigging ballet.
What lads do wrestling?
Don't start.
I don't see what's wrong with it.
You know exactly what's wrong with it.
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you bloody well do.
Who do you think I am?
You know quite nicely.
What?
What are you trying to say, Dad?
- You're asking for a hiding, son.
- I'm not, honest.
You are, Billy.
It's not just poofs, Dad.
Some ballet dancers are as fit as athletes.
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He was a ballet dancer.
- Wayne Sleep?
- Aye.
Listen, son, from now on you can forget about the fucking ballet.
You can forget about the fucking boxing, as well.
I'm busting my ass for those 50 pences, and you're...
No, from now on you stay here, you look after your nanna.
Got it?
Good.
They used to say I could've been a professional dancer, with some training.
Will you shut up?
I hate you!
You're a bastard!
Get off!
Billy!
Hello.
My dad'll kill me if he knows I'm here.
He's stopped you coming to classes.
It's not his fault, Miss.
That's all right with you, is it?
I suppose so.
You should stand up to him.
You don't know what he's like.
Well, that blows it.
- Blows what, Miss?
- Debbie.
I've heard a lot about you.
Durham's little Gene Kelly, eh?
Your dad worked down the pit, then?
Yeah.
Must be hard for the family, being on strike.
He is out on strike, isn't he?
Of course.
I shouldn't worry. They won't last long.
Tom, don't.
If they voted, they'd be back tomorrow.
It's just a few commies, stirring things up.
Let's face it, they haven't got a leg to stand on.
Who doesn't?
The miners.
It stands to reason.
Some pits are just uneconomical.
If it costs more to pay everybody to dig the coal out...
...than you get for it when you sell it, what does that say?
I don't know.
You wanna think about that, don't you, son?
Tom.
If it was up to me,
I'd shut them all down tomorrow.
For God's sake.
What do you do, Mr. Wilkinson?
He's been made redundant.
- I thought he was gonna hit me.
- Don't be silly.
He's just under a lot of pressure.
That's what Mom says.
I think it's because he drinks too much.
Does he drink too much?
He's always pissed.
Once he pissed himself.
Your dad?
'Cause he's unhappy and that.
'Cause they sleep in separate beds.
- Why do they sleep in separate beds?
- So they can't have sex.
Do they not have sex?
Dad did it with this woman from work, but they don't think I know.
Do you miss your mom, then?
I don't really miss her as such.
It's more like just feeling sad.
Especially when I remember her all of a sudden.
When I'd forgot that she was dead and that.
What about your mom?
Does she not have sex?
No, she's unfulfilled.
That's why she does dancing.
She does dancing instead of sex?
- Your family's weird.
- No, they're not.
They are though. They're mental.
Get off!
See? You're a nutter, you.
Debbie, it's time for Billy to go home.
Come on, Billy.
I'll drop you off at the corner.
I'll see you, Debbie.
Okay, then.
Miss...
...what have I blown?
This'll sound strange, Billy...
...but, for some time now,
I've thought of the Royal Ballet School.
Aren't you a bit old?
No, not me. You.
I'm the bloody teacher.
They hold auditions in Newcastle.
I'd never be good enough.
I hardly know aught.
They're not interested in how much you know.
They'll teach you.
That's why they're a ballet school.
It's how you move, how you express yourself that's important.
Express what?
I think you're good enough to go for it.
It would mean an awful lot of hard work.
But I'm banned.
- Maybe I should have a word with him.
- No, Miss!
- I could teach you on your own.
- We couldn't afford it.
- I'm not doing it for the money.
- What about Dad?
- He doesn't need to know.
- What about boxing?
Listen, if you wanna piss about with your mates, that's fine with me.
All right, don't lose your blob.
"Blob"?
So, we could do it private like?
Just you and me.
Miss, you don't fancy me, do you?
No, Billy. Funnily enough, I don't.
Now, piss off.
Piss off yourself.
See you Monday, then.
You coming in or what?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just dressing up.
- Whose dress is that?
- Come on.
- Whose dress is that?
- It's me sister's.
- Did she give you it?
- She doesn't know.
Do you wanna try?
You can have one of me mom's.
No. You all right?
- What are you doing that for?
- I'm just trying it on.
Christ.
Come here.
Stay still.
There.
- Won't we get in trouble?
- Don't be stupid.
Me dad does it all the time.
He dresses up in your mom's clothes?
Only when he thinks everybody's out.
Have you got a tutu yet?
Do you think being a ballet dancer would be better than being a miner?
I don't know.
It's just, I've got this audition in Newcastle, in a couple of weeks.
- What for?
- To go to ballet school.
Ballet school? Is that in Newcastle?
London.
You'd have to move with your Tony and everybody?
- No, by myself.
- That's a bit steep.
- Can't you be a ballet dancer here?
- Don't be stupid.
- When are you going there?
- I don't know.
I haven't even got in yet.
What does your dad say?
- He doesn't know.
- Fucking hell.
- Are you not going to tell him?
- Not yet, anyway.
He might be pleased about it.
He could rent your room.
He couldn't. What about our Tony?
What do you reckon?
I think you shouldn't bother.
Why not?
I'd miss ya.
Fucking hell.
Brought your things?
I don't know if they're right, Miss.
If they're special to you, they're right.
What are they for?
To give us some ideas for a dance.
Come on, then. Let's see them.
What's that?
It's a letter.
I can see it's a letter.
It's me mom's.
She wrote it, for when I was 18...
...but I opened it.
Here.
"To my son, Billy.
"Dear Billy:
"I know I must seem like a distant memory to you...
"...which is probably a good thing.
"It will have been a long time...
"...and I will have missed seeing you grow.
"Missed you crying, laughing...
"...and shouting.
"I will have missed telling you off.
"But please know that I was always there.
"With you through everything.
"With you through everything.
"I always will be.
"And I am proud to have known you.
"And I'm proud that you were mine.
"Always be yourself.
"I'll love you forever.
"Mom."
She must have been a very special woman, your mother.
No, she was just me mom.
I brought a tape and all.
- What is it?
- I Love to Boogie.
It's one of our Tony's.
Spin it!
Go on!
Tap, tap.
Go!
Grandma, teatime.
Where are you going?
Go back to sleep.
It's 4:00.
You weren't thinking of taking it with you?
If you just wanna stand around...
...getting the shit kicked out of you, that's fine.
- Some of us are ready to fight back.
- They're already after you.
You're no good to us in jail.
I don't plan on getting caught.
- What's going on?
- Get back to bed.
Both of you!
Fuck you.
Put it down.
- You gonna stop me?
- I'm warning you.
You haven't got it in you. You're finished!
Since Mom died, you're a useless twat.
What are you gonna do about it?
Stop it!
What the fuck are you looking at?
You haven't been practicing.
Prepare.
One, two, and one, and two.
Get up.
Miss, I can't do it.
That's because you're not concentrating.
I am concentrating.
- You're not even trying.
- I am, Miss.
- Do it again.
- I can't.
You do it again.
No!
Shit.
I'm sorry.
It's all right for you.
It's not you who has to do it.
- I know.
- You don't know anything!
What do you know in your posh house, with your husband that pisses himself?
You're the same as everybody else.
All you want is to tell me what to do!
Now, wait a minute.
I don't want to do your stupid, fucking audition.
You only want me to do it for your own benefit!
Look, Billy...
- Because you're a failure!
- Don't you dare talk to me like that.
You don't even have a proper dancing school.
You're stuck in some crummy boxing hall!
Don't pick on me because you fucked up your own life!
Can I put a tape on, Miss?
All right, if you must.
It's cush, isn't it?
So, is there a story, then, Miss?
Of course.
It's about a woman who's captured by an evil magician.
Sounds crap.
And this woman, this beautiful woman...
...is forced to be a swan...
...except for a few hours every night...
...when she becomes alive.
When she becomes real again.
And then, one night...
...she meets this young prince...
...and he falls in love with her.
And she realizes...
...this is the one thing that will allow her...
...to become a real woman once more.
So then what happens?
He promises to marry her and goes off with someone else, of course.
So she has to be a swan for good?
She dies.
'Cause the prince didn't love her?
Come on. It's time to go.
It's only a ghost story.
Come on.
It's me.
It's Billy.
Oh, little one.
Oh, little one...
...what have I told you about drinking out of the bottle?
Sorry, Mom.
Well, put it back.
One.
Lift...
...and reach.
Down, and one.
Breathe and stretch.
And one.
Lift and stretch.
Lift...
...and lengthen that foot.
And it's one.
Extend.
Reach out.
Lift and breathe.
And one.
Lift.
Out and close.
And one.
Lift.
When's the audition, then?
Tomorrow morning.
I'll miss you if you go away.
Who do you think is better,
Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers?
Billy, do you not fancy us, like?
Don't know. Never really thought about it.
If you want, I'll show you me fanny.
No. You're all right.
- Get inside.
- Come on.
That's the union leader. Get him!
Get down!
Thanks, pet.
Wanker!
Keep away from there, son.
Shit.
Here they come!
Fuck!
Tony!
Tony, come back!
Take him away. Off you go, mate.
Miss, I've got a problem with the audition.
Hello?
Right, listings for Court 4.
Tony Elliot.
George Brunton. Gary Cummings.
- What's the time?
- Colin Woodward.
Hello.
Can I help you?
- I was looking...
- They're out.
Sorry.
- Billy?
- Please, Miss.
- Don't.
- What's going on, Billy?
Who the fuck are you?
I think we better go inside.
I know this might be hard for you...
...but, today,
Billy missed a very important audition.
Audition?
For the Royal Ballet School.
The Royal Ballet?
School. It's where they teach the ballet.
You've got to be joking, love.
No, I'm perfectly serious.
Have you any idea what we're going through?
I've been in a fucking cell, all night...
...and you come around here, talking shite.
And you...
Fucking ballet!
What are you trying to do, make him a scab for the rest of his life? Look at him.
He's only 11, for fuck's sake.
- You've got to start training young.
- Shut it.
I'm not having my brother running around like a right twat for your gratification.
Excuse me.
This is not for my gratification.
What good will it do him?
You're not taking him away.
He's only a bairn.
What about giving him a childhood?
I don't want one.
I wanna be a ballet dancer.
And anyway, what do you know about it?
What qualifications have you got?
Look, I haven't come here to defend myself.
Well, for all we know, you could be some nutter.
Get the fucking Social on to you.
I think you should calm yourself down, son.
You say he can dance?
Go on, then.
Let's see this fucking dancing.
This is ridiculous!
If you're a fucking ballet dancer, then let's be having you.
- Don't you dare!
- What sort of a teacher are you?
He's got the chance to dance.
Now, you're fucking telling him not to.
Dance, you little twat!
So, piss off.
He's not doing any more ballet!
If you go near him again,
I'll smack you, you middle-class cow.
You know nothing about me, you sanctimonious little shit!
He won't grow up to race whippets, grow leeks or piss his wages up the wall.
Listen! He's been with me...
Billy, wait there!
Billy, come on!
Hurry up!
Merry Christmas, everybody!
"Here we go, here we go, here we go"
Do you think she'll mind?
Shut it, Billy. She's dead.
Well, merry Christmas, everybody.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
"Oh, what fun"
Fucking great Christmas this has been.
- Go on, have some.
- Where'd you get it?
Me dad's got loads in the kitchen.
- Won't he notice?
- He never knows how much is there.
- It tastes like piss.
- You get used to it.
Here.
Maybe you could run away or something.
You know, join a dancing troupe.
Don't be so stupid.
- Well, maybe it's all for the best.
- What do you mean?
You won't have to go away or nothing.
My hands are freezing.
Give us them here.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Just warming your hands up.
You're not a poof?
What gave you that impression?
Aren't me hands cold?
I quite like it.
Just because I like ballet...
...doesn't mean I'm a poof, you know?
You won't tell anyone, will you?
Come on.
It's fucking freezing in here.
Here.
- What's this?
- Just put it on.
A tutu.
- George, there's somebody in the club.
- This kangaroo...
...is wanking away over it, right...
...and he's called Norman.
And then, around the corner came this wallaby.
Plié, first.
- What's a plié?
- It's French.
- Why is it French?
- I don't know. Second...
...like a princess.
Second, and down.
And first. Carry on. Fifth.
Shoulders down. Long neck.
How do I look?
- Shut up, you poof.
- Fuck off.
Second, and down.
And first.
Fifth.
Second.
Down.
First.
Fifth.
Jackie, man. Here.
Give us your hand.
Dance!
Dad!
Go home, son.
Is this a friend of yours, then?
How much is it gonna cost?
And a happy Christmas to you, too.
Not as much as you might think.
Maybe two grand.
- There's a good chance the Council's...
- Two grand?
I was talking about the auditions.
It's just a matter of the trip to London.
I'll give you the money for the fare.
I didn't come here to be patronized.
No one's trying to patronize you.
You're being ridiculous.
- Am I?
- Yes.
Thanks for everything you've done for Billy.
But he is my son, isn't he?
I'll handle this myself.
- What?
- Thorpe.
Is that the lot, then?
Fucking hell.
I never thought I'd see you down here.
Things change, eh?
Right, you. Name?
Jackie Elliot.
Glad to see you've come to your senses.
Who's a big man now, eh?
Right. Okay, you lot, away!
All aboard the Skylark. Look lively.
You can't smoke on here, mate.
These are private buses.
Scab, scab, scab!
Fuck off!
Dad!
Give us a hand.
Dad!
What the fuck are you doing?
Dad, you can't go back, not now!
Look at the state of us!
- What've we got to offer that Billy?
- You can't!
Not now!
Not after everything we've been through!
It's for wee Billy!
He might be a fucking genius, for all we know.
For fuck's sake, Dad.
You can't do this, man! Dad!
He's only 11, for fuck's sake.
He's a kid.
He's just a fucking little kid.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, son.
- Please!
- I'm sorry, son.
We're finished, son!
What choice have we got, eh?
- Let's give the boy a fucking chance!
- Please.
Please don't do this to me, Dad.
We'll find him some money.
We'll find it for him.
What the fuck is he doing?
It's okay. He's gonna be okay.
Just get him out of here, Tony.
Away. Leave it. Go on. Leave it.
Let's go home, Dad.
Dad's right, you know?
Mom would have let you.
All them 50 pences.
It was a toss-up between a new punch bag or you.
It's not even enough for the bed-and-breakfast.
Forget it, you're dreaming. Look at you.
Fucking scrabbling round for 50 pences.
You've got to do better than that.
How?
I'm gonna have a raffle at the Welfare.
And I'm gonna organize a concert.
Thanks, George.
Sheila's not got that kind of money.
She can't even keep the soup kitchen open.
George said we could have another whip-round.
There's no money left.
Get that through your head, man!
You know there's nothing left.
Stop putting ideas in his head, man!
Come on, lads! Dig deep for the miners.
Is that absolutely necessary?
Walk normal, will you?
So what's it like, like?
What's what like?
London.
I don't know, son.
I've never made it past Durham.
Have you never been, like?
- Why would I want to go to London?
- It's the capital city.
- Well, there's no mines in London.
- Christ.
Is that all you think about?
Can I help you?
Billy Elliot. We've come for an audition.
You mean William Elliot?
- Yeah, William.
- Yes. Can you go upstairs, please?
- This way?
- Yes.
Thanks.
- Is this your first time?
- Yeah.
I've been doing this for two years now.
Hello.
Nerve-racking, isn't it?
Where are you from?
Everington. County Durham.
Durham? Isn't there an amazing cathedral?
I don't know. I've never been.
Up on the box, please.
Right. Bend over. Right down.
And come up.
Head down.
Tiny curvature here. Head down!
How tiny?
Might not be a problem.
Come on, keep coming.
- Right. Jump up, William.
- It's Billy.
Billy Elliot.
Two, three, and four.
Dad!
Dad! Dad, for fuck's sake!
I've changed me mind.
Get back in there. Don't be so stupid.
And you are?
Billy Elliot from Everington.
- I beg your pardon?
- Billy Elliot.
Yes, of course.
Well, come to the bar, please, Billy.
Left arm on the bar.
Feet first.
Arms second.
Demi-plié, and hold.
Now, Billy...
...we'd like to see you move to music.
Do you have a piece prepared?
Thank you.
Are you all right?
- What's the matter?
- It was a waste of fucking time.
Don't be upset. It's only a stupid audition.
- It's all right.
- Fuck off.
- There's always next year.
- Look, fuck off, will you?
You bent bastard!
What on earth's going on here?
How did it go?
Shit!
Mr. Elliot, I'm afraid that mutual respect and self-discipline...
...are absolute prerequisites for any pupil in this school.
Such displays of violence...
...cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. Understand?
I realize we shall have to consider this very seriously...
...and it will be bound to affect our final decision.
Yes, well, just a few questions, then.
Can you tell us why you first became interested in the ballet?
Don't know.
Just was.
Well, was there any particular aspect of the ballet, which...
...caught your imagination?
The dancing.
He dances all the time.
Every night, after school.
Yes, well, we have a very enthusiastic letter from...
...Mrs. Wilkinson, and she has...
...told us of your personal circumstances.
Mr. Elliot, are you a fan of the ballet?
I wouldn't exactly say I was an expert.
You do realize that...
...all pupils must attain the highest standards, not just in ballet...
...but in their ordinary academic work?
No child can succeed without the 100 percent support of the family.
You are completely behind Billy?
Are you not?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Do you want to ask us any questions?
No, not really. No.
In that case...
...we shall let you know in due course.
Just one last question.
Can I ask you, Billy:
What does it feel like when you're dancing?
Don't know.
Sort of feels good.
It's sort of stiff and that...
...but once I get going...
...then I, like, forget everything...
...and...
...sort of disappear.
I sort of disappear.
Like I feel a change in me whole body.
Like there's a fire in me body.
I'm just there...
...flying...
...like a bird.
Like electricity.
Yeah...
...like electricity.
Have a safe journey home.
Mr. Elliot.
Good luck with the strike.
Toast.
I think you should get yourself a trade, son.
Something useful.
I could have been a professional dancer.
What's happened to the dinosaurs, Miss?
They were crushed as well.
And the pressure of all of this caused the plants and trees to change...
...into coal.
That's what must have happened to her.
Michael Caffrey, if you have got something to say...
...you can say it to the class.
Sorry, Miss.
So, gradually...
...over hundreds of thousands of years...
Post!
This is it.
- Have you heard anything yet?
- Not yet.
You'll have no problem, man.
Fingers crossed, eh?
I got in.
He did it! He fucking did it!
Jackie, have you not heard, man?
We're going back.
Strike's over, Jackie.
The union caved in yesterday.
I think I'm scared, Dad.
That's okay, son.
We're all scared.
Well, if I don't like it, can I still come back?
Are you kidding?
We've let out your room.
Four, five, six, seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven.
Keep going, girls.
Miss, I just came to tell you.
It's all right, Billy, I heard it from Debbie.
Look, it was just...
Well, you know, after everything.
- I'll miss you, Miss.
- No, you won't.
I will. Honest.
This is when you go out and find life...
...and all those other things.
The best of luck, Billy.
Right. Back to the bar, girls. And again.
Thank you.
Debbie, eyes front.
- Was she there?
- Yeah.
- You'll miss the bus.
- I'll take it.
- Give us the bag.
- Okay, right, no time for this.
Come on, I'll take that.
- Good-bye, Billy.
- See you.
Dancing boy!
- You'll miss your bus, Billy.
- Stop being an old fucking woman.
See you, then.
- I'll miss you!
- What? I can't hear you!
Dad, come on, man. We're gonna be late.
Come on!
The show's just started.
Excuse me.
Can you tell Billy Elliot that his family's here?
- Sorry, mate.
- It's all right, Tony.
It's me, Michael. Remember?
It's Michael.
- What the bloody hell are you doing here?
- I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Stand by, please.
- Billy, your family are here.
- Thanks.
Never thought that l'd be fighting you
But you stole my heart you cheated and lied you Weren't in my corner you Weren't on my side
The gloves are off you hit below the belt

Whoa, nobody caught me.
That was lame. l don't think he's moving.
He is a lazy freeloader, and it's time for all this dysfunction to stop.
Can't We just do this later? l mean, you know how he gets in the morning.
Ned, aren't you tired of letting people push you around?
Yes.
Then get in there and do it.
What?
What is it?
Dewey, hey, it's the first of the month, and...
...l'd like your share of the rent now.
Man, you know l don't have it.
You wake me up for that?
Come on, man!
Sorry.
Dewey, l mean, you owe me a lot of money as it is.
Yeah, try $2,200.
Ok, you guys, the band is about to hit it bigtime.
We'll win Battle of the Bands.

Oh, you're on this?
You're on this?
He's Walking all over you.
Mommy, could we please talk about this later?
No, We can't talk about it later, because we have to go to work.
We have jobs.
We contribute to society. All right? l am an assistant to the mayor of the city, ''hello''!
What? Can you get her out of here, please? Why? Why her?
And Ned has the most important job there is.
Temping?
Dewey, a substitute teacher is not a temp.
- He's a babysitter.
- Think it's so easy? l'd like to see you try.
You Wouldn't last a day.
Dude, l service society by rocking. l'm out there liberating people
With my music.
Rocking ain't no
Walk in the park, lady.
All right, this is useless, all right?
Tell him if he doesn't come up
With the rent by the end of the Week, he's out of here.
Dewey, l'm not paying your share of the rent, so...
...maybe you should sell one of your guitars or something.
What?
Would you tell Picasso to sell his guitars?
Oh, my God. He's an idiot.
Dude, l've been mooching off you for years, and it was never a problem until she showed up. Dump her. lf you don't come up with some money, she'll dump me.
Really? That would be good.
She's a nightmare.
Come on. l may never have another girlfriend. l mean, just come on.
Come up with some money, please.
Please.
Ok. For you. Not for her, man.
For you.
Thank you.
Heal me l'm heartsick

Who's this guy?
We're taking the Battle of the Bands seriously this year.
Good, because l need the money. Now, listen. lf We're gonna win this thing, We gotta actually start playing some music. l agree. You're fired.
Your lyrics, now don't take this the wrong way, Theo, are lame.
But l've been sitting on some awesome material, so...
Did you hear What l said?
We voted.
You're out.
This is Spider. He's replacing you.
What's up, dog? l was gonna tell you last night, but you passed out, man.
You're gonna kick me out of the band?
You're gonna fire me?
- lt's my band. l brought us together.
- Theo wanted you out.
- There's nothing l could do.
- Shut up, man. You voted him out too.
Dewey, listen to me.
You're a good guitar player, but it's the 20-minute solos. lt's the stage dives.
We're trying to land a record deal here, man, and you're an embarrassment.
Read between the lines, Theo.
Read between the lines!
Dewey, man, l hope this doesn't come between us.
Like, l care about you, man.
You guys, you know what?
You're nuts. You're all nuts.
You've been focused so hard on making it, you forgot about one thing. lt's called the music.
And l don't even care.
You know what? So what. l don't wanna hang out with wannabe corporate sellouts. l'm gonna form my own band.
We're gonna start a revolution.
And you're gonna be a funny little footnote on my epic ass. l feel sorry for you guys.
Yes.
Yeah, it's a 1968 Gibson SG, mint condish.
No.
That's all?
Well, that's a mistake.
No, Hendrix played this guitar.
Hello?
- Yeah?
- ls this Mr. Schneebly?
No, he's not here.
- Could you take a message for me?
- Yeah.
Hi. My name's Rosalie Mullins. l'm the principal at Horace Green Prep.
We're having a little emergency.
One of our teachers broke her leg this morning, and all of our subs are already working.
Pat Wickam at Milton Prep recommended l call Mr. Schneebly.
Do you know if he's available?
- How long is the gig?
- Excuse me?
How long is the job?
As much as a few weeks, but we need somebody to start immediately.
So how much are we talking here?
We pay our substitutes
650 a Week.
Now, do you know when
Mr. Schneebly will be back?
Hold on a sec.
Oh, you know what? l think he's just coming in right...
Ned, phone!
Hello, this is Ned Schneebly.
Pat faxed me your rèsumè. lt's very impressive.
We've never been in a bind like this before, so thank you so much.
So how's this gonna work?
Are you gonna pay me upfront? l don't understand. lt'd be really great if l could get paid in cash.
Oh, Well, We don't do that.
When you cut my check, make it payable to Dewey Finn, for tax reasons.
You can discuss all of that with Candace at the end of the day.
When's the end of the day?
We commence at 8:15, school lets out at 3.
You know what?
Do you think l could cut out a little early today? l got some stuff l gotta do. lt's cool. l can stay.
Mr. Schneebly...
...this is considered the best elementary school in the state, and We maintain that by adhering to a strict code of conduct, faculty included.
Don't worry about me. l'm a hard-ass. lf a kid gets out of line, l got no problem smacking him.
No, no. We don't use corporal punishment here.
Ok, so just verbal abuse? lf you have any problems with any students, send them to me.
- l will do the disciplining.
- Check.
Children.
Please take your seats. l'd like to introduce
Miss Dunham's substitute.
This is Mr. Schneebly.
Why don't you write your name on the board.
Yes, l will.
You know what?
Why don't you all just call me ''Mr. S''.
Mr. S has never taught here at Horace Green, so l Want you all to be on your best behavior.
So the curriculum is on the desk.
- And do you have any questions?
- Yeah, When's lunch?
The children just had their lunch. ls there anything else you need? l'm a teacher.
All l need are minds for molding.
All right, then. Well, thanks again.
You saved the day.
Ok, Who's got food in here?
You're not gonna get in trouble. l'm hungry.
You. What do you got?
That's What l'm talking about.
Ok. Teach. Teach. Teach.
All right, look, here's the deal. l've got a hangover.
Who knoWs What that means?
- Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
- No. lt means l Was drunk yesterday.
- lt means you're an alcoholic.
- Wrong.
You Wouldn't come to Work hung-over unless you Were.
Dude, you got a disease.
- What's your name?
- Freddy Jones.
Freddy Jones, shut up.
Shut up.
The point is, you all can just chill today.
We'll start on this crapola tomorroW.
- Yes, Tinkerbell?
- Summer.
As class factotum, first l'd like to just say, Welcome to Horace Green.
- Thank you.
- Any questions about our schedule?
Because usually noW
Miss Dunham teaches vocabulary, then gives us a pop quiz, then splits us up into reading groups.
- Track B is...
- Ok, hey, hey, hey.
Miss ''Dumbum'' ain't your teacher today, l am.
And l got a headache and the runs.
So l say, time for recess.
But Mr. S, that poster charts everyone's performance.
We get stars When We master the material covered.
HoW do We get gold stars if We just have recess?
- What are these black dots here?
- Demerits.
What kind of a sick school is this?
As long as l'm here, there Will be no grades or gold stars or demerits.
We're gonna have recess all the time.
But Miss Dunham only gives us recess for 1 5 minutes...
You're not hearing me, girl. l'm in charge noW, Ok?
And l say recess.
Go. Play and have fun, noW.
Nice.
NoW, you don't Want me to have to call your parents, do you? lt's all right, Emily, don't cry.
Just try to be a bit more conscientious.
Would you like a hug? l'll be good, l sWear!
All right, Well, that's fine, Emily.
You're excused.
Yes, We did it.
We did it, come on.
Give me some. Give me some.
Give me some. Give me some of that. l Will see you cats on the flip-flop. Later! l heard she slipped in the bathroom.
Yes, but We've got a Wonderful neW substitute
Who comes very highly recommended.
- Mr. Schneebly? Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah!
Hold on, buddy!
Oh, my God.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Oh, man, this guy sucks, man.
- Here, call him.
- Call him? Yeah, right.
Ok. Yes, you can be in my band.
But, Ned, no poWer plays, man. l've got vision up the butt, so just go With it.
No, thanks.
You're not a teacher, Ned.
You're the cross-dressing, blood-sucking incubus from Maggot Death.
That's the real you.
DeWey, l'm not a satanic sex god anymore. l'm a Working stiff.
And that's cool.
- She's got you brainWashed.
- l'm Working.
That's terrific.
But Who are you, babe?
This is my apartment, babe.
Not if you don't pay your rent, it's not. Get a job. l got a job. l'll have rent by the end of the Week. Go tell the mayor.
- You got a job. Doing What?
- l do What Ned does, temping. l'm not a temp. l'm a sub.
And soon l'll be a certified teacher.
Come on, man!
One shoW, $20,000 prize,
We split it 60/40. Grab your bass and come back to the garage. l mean, don't you miss rocking out? lf you think anyone is gonna be in a band With you, you're more delusional than l thought.
DeWey, you knoW, maybe it's time to give up those dreams. l did, and things are going really great for me.
Are you gonna teach us anything or are We just gonna sit here?
Just do Whatever you Want.
- l Want to learn from my teacher.
- Besides that.
Freddy, What do you like to do? l don't knoW, burn stuff?
Just go out and have recess.
My parents don't spend $1 5,000 a year for recess.
- You Want to learn something?
- Yes, l do.
You Want me to teach you something?
All right, here's a useful lesson for you.
Give up. Just quit.
Because in this life, you can't Win.
Yeah, you can try, but in the end, you're just gonna lose, bigtime, because the World is run by The Man.
- Who?
- The Man.
Oh, you don't knoW The Man?
Well, he's everywhere. ln the White House, doWn the hall.
Miss Mullins, she's The Man.
And The Man ruined the ozone, and he's burning doWn the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank.
There used to be a Way to stick it to The Man. lt Was called rock 'n' roll.
But guess What. Oh, no.
The Man ruined that too
With a little thing called MTV!
So don't Waste your time trying to make anything cool or pure or aWesome.
The Man's just gonna call you a fat,
Washed-up loser and crush your soul.
So do yourselves a favor and just give up!

Ok, l Will sing it for you, but let me just get in the zone. l Was not planning on unveiling it, but l Will sing it.
Tip of the tongue, teeth and the lips.
Ok. lt starts off...
...a dark stage, and then a beam of light, and you can see me and my guitar. ln the end of time
There Was a man
Who kneW the road
And the Writing
Was Written on the stone
And then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles.
Roadies, that means dry ice.
We're gonna talk about this later. ln the ancient time
An artist led the Way
But no one
Seemed to understand
Chimes, Freddy. ln his heart he kneW
The artist must be true
But the legend of the rent
Was Way past due
And then, katie, you come in
With the bass.
Well, you think you'll be just fine
Without me, but you're mine y ou think you can
Kick me out of the band
And then, Zack, you come in
With a face-melter.
Ok?
Well, there's just one problem there
The band is mine
HoW can you kick me out
Of What is mine?
And then...
HaWaii Five-O.
You ever see that shoW?
Ok, Well, there's a drum solo in it that goes: y ou're not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore
And l Want the backup singers to be like:
Well, you're not hardcore

Unless you live hardc--
Unless you live hardcore
But the legend of the rent

But l figure l'm gonna be here for a While.
Well, that remains to be seen.
- Have you met our other teachers?
- No.
But the kids could learn by getting out of the classroom. lt's more complicated than that.
There's safety issues.
Parents need to be notified. lt's against school policy.
Mr. S, l have a lot of ideas.
HoW about everyone in magenta
With beads and sequins?
Billy, l'm talking to Principal Mullins.

Well... Well, What's that?
Oh, that. Yeah.
We Were singing. We Were singing and learning.

- Nine.
- No, it's eight
No, it's nine y es, l Was testing you lt's nine
And that's a magic number l'm very happy that you're able to extend your stay, but l must say, l find your methods of teaching very unusual.
Well, l did study With
Dr. Errol Von Straussenburgerbecken.
- Who?
- Oh, you don't knoW him?
Oh, he's, like, one of the leading leaders in...unusual methods.
Actually, he's hoW l Was appointed to the Presidential Council for Experimental Educationers.
That sounds very impressive, but We're not interested in experimental education here.
So if from noW on you could just stick to the curriculum, that Would be great.
- Yes. Right.
- Thank you.
Ros?
- Yes?
- Do you knoW, l Would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on teaching.
Do you think maybe We could grab some coffee?
You Want to go get some coffee With me?

- You're sure you don't have coffee?
- l'm quite sure.
Well, l've never been here before. l've never been to this side of toWn before, in fact.
So l have been...
Well, l've been... l've been dying to ask you something, Mr. Schneebly.
- Please, call me ''DeWey''.
- DeWey?
Ned. Call me ''Ned''. l Was thinking of my other name.
My middle name.
- Yeah.
- Well, Ned...
...in your experience, hoW does Horace Green compare to the other schools that you've taught at?
Oh, your school is the best.
- You're just saying that.
- l'm not.
You knoW that kids at other schools just have fun all the time?
They run around. There's no discipline.
They're happy. lt's anarchy.
This is the best school l have ever teached at. l sWear. l'll drink to that.
Stay there. l'm gonna put on some music.
- l love this song.
- Really?
- Yes. Stevie Nicks.
- Yeah.

- Yes, yes.
- Oh, my gosh, no comparison.
- Yeah.
You knoW What?
Oh, man, l Would love to take the kids to a concert.
- Concert?
- Yeah.
There's one at the end of the month.
The Philharmonic. They do classics.
They do Beethoven, Mozart...

Where people are intimidated. lntimidated?
- They hate me.
- No. They don't.
Yes, they do. They sure do. l can see. l Wasn't alWays like this. l Wasn't alWays Wound this tight.
There Was a time When l Was fun. l Was funny. l Was.
But you can't be funny and be the principal of a prep school.
No, you cannot, because
When it comes to their kids, these parents, they have no sense of humor. lf anything goes Wrong, it's my head. lt's my head in the smasher.
These parents Will come doWn on me like a nuclear bomb. l can't make a mistake. l gotta be perfect.
And that pressure has turned me into one thing that l never Wanted to be.
A bitch.

You're gonna talk to me about style?
You can't dress yourself.
Look at that boW tie.
Don't talk about my boW tie.

- Just something l Wrote.
You Wrote a song?

One, tWo, three.
And if you Wanna be
The teacher's pet

He did a Whole professional light shoW on his computer in three days. And...
And Marta here, she's...
She can hit an A above high C.
Did you knoW that?
Because that's tough.
Not many singers can do that. And...
Summer is gonna be the first Woman president of the United States.
She could run this year. l Would vote for her.
Look, they're just really cool kids. lf they Were mine, l Would be so proud.
And l am proud, just to even knoW them. And...
Sir, can l see you in the hall for a moment?
Let me just say a couple more things.
- What's going on?
- What's happening?
Apparently, that man is not Ned Schneebly.
- What?
- What?
- This man is Ned Schneebly.
- He's not even a teacher.
- You called the cops?
- She did. She got it out of me. Sorry.
- You're apologizing to him?
- Sorry.
Ned.
Ned, is this true?
Who are you?
My name is DeWey Finn.
And, no, l'm not a licensed teacher, but l have been touched by your kids.
And l'm pretty sure l've touched them.
- What?
- Oh, my God.
- l have nothing to say to you.
- Me either.
Ok. l'm going to bed. lt's one thing to throW your life aWay, but to put Ned in jeopardy is selfish.
You told me to be like Ned and get a job. l told you to be like Ned, l didn't tell you to be Ned.
- You're not gonna apologize?
- You apologize for calling the cops. l didn't murder anybody. l Wanted to play a great shoW.
- l Was this close.
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Would you both just cut it out for one second?
Look, l'm sorry, dude. l Was desperate. lt Was easy for you to give up music.
- lt ain't easy for me.
- lt Wasn't easy for me. l miss it.
Well, then Why'd you give it up?
Because l couldn't keep kidding myself anymore.
You can blame it all on bad luck, but in the end, maybe We just Weren't that good.
Sometimes you gotta knoW
When to quit.
- Right, maybe l suck.
- That's not What l said.
Well, music is my life, man.
What do you Want me to do? l don't knoW, but...
...l think it's time you moved out.
Sorry.
- So his name Wasn't Mr. Schneebly?
- No, it Was, like, DeWey something.
What about the project?
Wake up, Marco, there Was no project.
He Wanted us to play a shoW so We could make money. l can't believe We Weren't graded.
Why are you bummed?
We had a three-Week vacation. lt Was a Waste of time, but it Was better than school.
- lt Was not a Waste of time.
- Yeah, that's What it Was.
- You're an idiot.
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.
- You Want to go?
Touch him, l'll shove those sticks doWn your throat.
Mr. S Was cool. We Worked too long and too hard not to play the shoW.
Ok, so What are
We supposed to do?
We get out of here and play the damn shoW.
HoW could you let our kids be exposed to this impostor?
- Do you just let anyone teach here?
- l pay $1 5,000...
Let me assure you that nothing is more important to us than for you to feel your children are in a safe and secure environment.
- Ok, We're all here.
- Where's Mr. Schneebly?
He didn't tell you? He's at home.
We need to pick him up.
Let's go, hurry.
Excuse me.
Just one second, please.
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- We Want some ansWers, noW!
- Just one second!
Where did they go?
Help! Children?
Wake up.
- HoW'd you guys get in here?
- Front door Was open.
Why aren't you in school?
We did What you said.
We stuck it to The Man.
Forget about What l told you.
Look, l'm a loser, Ok?
You listen to my advice, you'll end up like me, With nothing.
Come on, man, quit goofing around.
This is serious business.
We're on a mission. One great shoW can change the World.
Look out the WindoW.
- Mr. S! Come doWn!
- Come on!
No Way. That is so punk rock.
The dining-room table seats 1 4,
With no inserts...
- What's going on?
- We've got some rocking to do.
- Yes!
- All right.
- Hi, Mr. Schneebly.
- HoW's it going?
You guys, all l can say is, let's rock.
One more thing. l Want to say l'm sorry...

- l'm going to the shoW.
- You Want to go?
- Yeah, l Want to go.
- You're serious?
- l don't Want to miss this, Patty.
Unbelievable. After everything he's done to you?
That is so typical Ned. When Will you stop being a pushover?
When are you finally gonna start sticking up for yourself?
Excuse me.
Excuse me. l've just been informed that all of your children are missing.
- So...

- That Was a good class.
- l'll see you, man.
There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far
Over land and sea
Don't be fooled! Evil!
A little shy
Turn away from this village of sin!
And sad of eye
But very wise...
... was he
And then one day
A magic day...
...he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing
You'll ever learn
Is just to love
And be loved...
...in return
The Moulin Rouge.
A nightclub...
...a dance hall and a bordello...
...ruled over by Harold Zidler.
A kingdom of nighttime pleasures...
... where the rich played with...
...the young and beautiful creatures of the underworld.
The most beautiful of all these...
... was the woman who I loved.
Satine.
A courtesan, she sold her love to men.
They called her
"The Sparkling Diamond. "
And she was the star...
...of the Moulin Rouge.
The woman I loved...
...is...
...dead.
I first came to Paris...
...one year ago.
It was 1899, the Summer of Love.
I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge,
Harold Zidler or Satine.
The world had been swept up in a
Bohemian revolution, and I had...
...come to be a part of it.
On the hill near Paris was the village of Montmartre.
It was not, as my father said--
A village of sin.
--but the center of the Bohemian world.
Musicians, painters, writers.
They were known as the Children of the Revolution.
I had come to live a penniless existence. I had come to...
... write about truth, beauty, freedom...
...and that which I believed in above all things: love.
Always this ridiculous obsession with love!
There was one problem.
I'd never been in love.
Just then, an unconscious Argentinean fell through my roof.
He was joined by a dwarf dressed as a nun.
How do you do?
My name is Henri Marie Raymond
Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa. l'm terribly sorry. We were upstairs rehearsing a play.
A play. Something very modern called
Spectacular, Spectacular. lt's set in Switzerland.
The unconscious Argentinean suffered from narcolepsy.
Perfectly fine one moment, then unconscious the next.
How is he?
Wonderful.
The Argentinean is unconscious.
Now the play will not be ready to present to the financier tomorrow.
-l still have to finish the music.
-Someone else can read the part.
Where on earth will we find someone to play...
...a young, sensitive
Swiss poet goatherder?
Soon I was upstairs, standing in for the unconscious Argentinean.
The hills animate
With the euphonious symphonies
Of descant
Oh, stop!
Stop that insufferable droning! lt's drowning out my words!
Just stick to some decorative piano.
There were artistic differences over Audrey's lyrics.
A nun wouldn't say that about a hill.
How about, "The hills are vital intoning the descant"?
"The hills quake and shake--"
"The hills are incarnate with symphonic melodies"!
"The hills--" "The hills--"
The hills...
...are alive...
... with the sound of...
...music
"The hills are alive with the sound of music." l love it!
The hills are alive...
-...with the sound...
-...of music. lt fits perfectly!
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years lncandiferous!
-You should write the show together.
-Excuse me?
Toulouse's suggestion was not what Audrey wanted to hear.
Goodbye!
Here's to your first job in Paris.
Toulouse, Zidler will never agree.
Have you ever written a play before?
No.
The boy has talent! l like him.
Nothing funny. l just like talent.
"The hills are alive with the sound of music."
With Christian, we can write...
...the Bohemian revolutionary show we always dreamt of.
How will we convince Zidler?
Toulouse had a plan.
Satine.
They'd dress me in a suit and say I was a famous English writer.
Once Satine heard my poetry, she'd be amaZed and insist that...
...I write Spectacular, Spectacular.
But I kept hearing my father's voice:
You'll end up wasting your life at the Moulin Rouge with a cancan dancer!
-l can't write the show!
-Why not? l don't know if l am a Bohemian revolutionary.
-Do you believe in beauty?
-Yes.
-Freedom?
-Of course.
-Truth?
-Yes.
Love?
Love? Love?
Above all things, l believe in love.
Love is like oxygen.
Love is a many-splendored thing.
Love lifts us up where we belong.
All you need is love!
You can't fool us! You're the voice of the Children of the Revolution!
We can't be fooled!
To the writer of the world's first
Bohemian revolutionary show!
It was the perfect plan.
I was to audition for Satine and taste my first glass of absinthe.
There was a boy.... l am the green fairy.
The hills are alive
With the sound of music
Freedom, beauty...
...truth and love
The hills are alive
With the sound of music
We were off to the Moulin Rouge.
I would perform my poetry for Satine.
Harold Zidler and his infamous girls.
They called them his "Diamond Dogs. "
Hey, sister, go, sister
Soul sister, go, sister
If life's an awful bore
And living's just a chore
That you do 'cause death's not much fun
I've just the antidote
And though I mustn't gloat
At the Moulin Rouge
You'll have fun
So scratch that little niggle
Give a little wiggle
You know that you can
Because we...
...can cancan
Don't say you can't can't can't
You know you can cancan
Don't say you can't
Because you can
Here we are now
Entertain us
We feel stupid
And contagious
Got some dark desire
Love to play with fire
Why not let it rip?
Live a little bit
We can cancan
Don't say you can't can't can't
You know you can cancan
You can cancan
Outside, it may be raining
But in here it's entertaining!
If you love love love
To be free free free
The Moulin Rouge is the place to be
Because we can cancan!
Yes, we can cancan!
Here we are now
Entertain us
Outside, things may be tragic
But in here, we feel it's magic
The cancan.
Because we can cancan!
Go, sister
Soul sister
Hey, sister, go, sister
Soul sister, go, sister
Because we can cancan!
Yes, we can cancan!
Creole Lady Marmalade
Because we can cancan!
'Cause it's good for your mind!
Mission accomplished.
We've successfully evaded Zidler. lt's her! The Sparkling Diamond.
The French are glad to...
...die for love
They delight...
...in fighting duels
But someone else was to meet Satine that night.
But I prefer...
...a man who lives
Zidler's investor.
And gives expensive...
...jewels
The Duke.
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental
But diamonds are
A girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you feed your pussycat
Men grow cold
As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
When will l meet the girl?
Tiffany's!
After her number. l've arranged a special meeting, just you and Satine.
Totally alone.
Cartier!
After her number, l've arranged a private meeting.
-Just you and Satine. Totally alone.
-Alone?
Yes, totally alone.
'Cause we are living
In a material world
And I am a material girl
Come and get me, boys.
Excuse me.
Black Star! Roscor!
Talk to me, Harry Zidler!
Tell me all about it!
There may come a time
When a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are
A girl's best friend
There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer thinks
You're awful nice
Don't worry. l'll sally forth and tee things up!
-ls the Duke here?
-Liebchen, would Daddy let you down?
Terribly sorry.
Where is he?
Toulouse is shaking a hanky at him.
Excuse me, Christian. May l borrow?
-Are you sure?
-Let me peek. l'm ever so sorry! How embarrassing!
That's the one. l hope that demonic little loon doesn't frighten him off.
Clean yourself up, you bourgeois pig!
Sorry.
-Will he invest?
-Pigeon!
After spending the night with you, how could he refuse?
What's his type? Wilting flower?
Bright and bubbly?
Or smoldering temptress? l'd say smoldering temptress.
We're all relying on you, gosling.
Remember, a real show in a real theater, with a real audience...
...and you'll be....
A real actress.
'Cause that's when those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds... l have exciting news!
...are a girl's...
...best...
...friend l believe you were expecting me.
Yes. Yes. l'm afraid it's lady's choice. l see you've met my English friend-- l'll take care of it.
Let's dance.
Hit her with your most modern poem!
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind
That went well.
-lncredible.
-He has a gift with the women. l told you. He's a genius.
That Duke certainly can dance.
How wonderful of you to take an interest in our show. lt sounds very exciting. l'd be delighted to be involved.
Assuming you like what l do. l'm sure l will.
Toulouse thought we might be able to...
...do it in private.
-Did he?
-Yes, you know, a private...
...poetry reading.
A "poetry reading." l love a little "poetry" after supper.
Hang on to your hat!
Diamonds
Diamonds
Square cut...
...or pear-shaped
These rocks...
... won't lose their shape
Diamonds...
...are a girl's...
...best....
Satine! Satine! Satine! l doubt the Duke will get his money's worth tonight.
Don't be unkind, Nini.
You've frightened her away.
But l can see some lonely
Moulin Rouge dancers...
...looking for a partner or two!
So if you can Hunk Hunk...
...you can Hunkadola with them!
Out of my way!
Oh, Marie.
Oh, these silly costumes.
Just a fainting spell.
Back out front, girls.
Make those gents thirsty. Problems?
-Nothing to worry about.
-Don't stand around, then.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girls
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Find Zidler.
The girl's waiting for me.
That twinkle-toes Duke took the bait, girl.
A patron like him, you could be the next Sarah Bernhardt.
Do you really think l could be like the great Sarah?
Why not? You got the talent.
You hook that Duke and you'll be lighting the great stages of Europe. l'll be a real actress, Marie.
A great actress. l'm gonna fly away from here. l'm gonna fly, fly away.
-Duckling, are you all right?
-Of course, Harold.
Thank goodness!
You certainly weaved your magic with the Duke on the dance floor.
How do l look?
Smoldering temptress?
My little strawberry...
...how could he possibly resist gobbling you up?
Everything's going so well!
I'll meet you in the red room
Unbelievable!
Straight to the elephant.
This is a wonderful place for a poetry reading. Don't you think?
Poetic enough for you?
A little supper?
Maybe some champagne? l'd rather just...
...get it over and done with.
Very well.
Then why don't you...
...come down here?
Let's get it over and done with. l prefer to do it standing.
You don't have to stand.
Sometimes it's.... lt's quite long, and l'd like you to be comfortable.
What l do is quite modern. lt may feel strange...
...at first, but if you're open, you might enjoy it. l'm sure l will.
Excuse me.
"The sky...."
"The sky...the bluebirds...."
Come on. Come on. l think....
There might be some shaking. ls everything okay? l'm a little nervous.
Sometimes it takes a while for...
...inspiration to come.
Oh, yes, yes.
Let Mummy help.
Does that inspire you?
Let's make love.
You want to, don't you?
Tell the truth.
Can't you feel the poetry?
Come on! Feel it.
Free the tiger!
Big boy!
He's got a huge talent!
-l need your poetry now!
-All right!
"lt's a little bit funny...
...this feeling inside. l'm not one of those who can easily hide." ls this okay? ls this what you want?
Oh, poetry.
This is what l want, naughty words.
Naughty!
"l don't have much money, but if l did, l'd buy...
...a big house where we both could live."
Oh! lt's so bad!
-"lf l were a sculptor, then again, no."
-You devil.
"Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show."
Don't, don't, don't!
Don't stop!
-"l know it's not much."
-Give me more! Yes!
-"lt's the best l can do."
-Naughty! Don't stop! Yes!
My gift is my song
And this one's for you
And you can tell everybody
That this is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
I sat on the roof
And I kicked off the moss
Well, some of these verses
They got me quite cross
But the sun's been kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that
Keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes
I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
Looks like he got the job! l can't believe it. l'm in love. l'm in love with a young...
...handsome, talented duke.
Duke?
Not that the title's important, of course. l'm not a duke.
Not a duke? l'm a writer.
A writer?
Yes, a writer.
Toulouse--
You're not one of Toulouse's talented,
Bohemian, impoverished proteges?
-You might say that.
-Oh, no! l'm going to kill him!
There might be a small hitch.
-What about the Duke?
-My dear Duke--
The Duke!
Hide! Out back!
My dear, are you decent for the Duke?
Where were you? l.... l was waiting.
Dear Duke, allow me to introduce
Mademoiselle Satine!
How wonderful of you to take time out to visit.
The pleasure, l fear, will be entirely mine, my dear. l'll leave you two squirrels to get better acquainted.
A kiss on the hand may be quite continental....
But diamonds are a girl's best friend.
After tonight's pretty exertions on the stage...
...you must be in need of refreshment.
Don't! Don't you...
...just love the view?
Charming. l feel like dancing. l should like a glass of champagne. lt's....
-lt's a little bit funny.
-What is?
This...feeling...
...inside. l'm not one of those who can easily...
...hide. l don't have much money...
...but if l did, l'd buy a big house...
...where we both could live.
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful...
...life is
Now you're in...
...the world
That's very beautiful. lt's from Spectacular, Spectacular.
Suddenly, with you here...
...l finally understood the true meaning of the words.
"How wonderful life is now you're in the world."
And what meaning is that, my dear?
Duke!
Don't you toy with my emotions.
You must know the effect you have on women.
Let's make love!
You want to make love, don't you?
Make love? l knew you felt the same way!
Oh, Duke!
You're right. We should wait until opening night.
Wait? Wait?
There's a power in you that scares me.
-You should go.
-l just got here.
We'll see each other every day during rehearsal.
We must wait. We must wait until opening night.
Get out.
Do you have any idea what would have happened if you were found?
Satine?
Let's have a little peekaboo.
Right on target. l forgot my hat--
Foul play?
Oh, Duke. lt's a little bit funny, this feeling inside!
Beautifully spoken.
Let me introduce you. The writer.
-The writer?
-Yes.
We were rehearsing.
You expect me to believe that scantily clad...
...in the arms of another man, inside an elephant, you were rehearsing?
How's the rehearsal going?
Shall we take it from the top?
-l hope the piano's in tune.
-Sorry, got held up.
Can l offer you a drink?
Oh, my goodness!
When l spoke those words to you, you so inspired me. l realized we had much work to do, so l called an emergency rehearsal.
Then where's Zidler? l didn't bother Harold.
Dear Duke, l'm terribly sorry.
Harold! The Duke knows all about the emergency rehearsal.
Emergency rehearsal?
To incorporate the Duke's artistic ideas.
Audrey will be delighted--
-Audrey left.
-What?
Cat's out of the bag.
The Duke's a big fan of our new writer's work.
That's why he's so keen to invest. lnvest? lnvest!
Oh, yes. lnvest!
You can't blame me for hiding...
...Christian away. l'm way ahead of you, Zidler.
Duke, let's go to my office and peruse the paperwork.
What's the story? lf l'm to invest, l need to know the story.
Well, the story's about....
Toulouse?
The story is.... The story's about.... lt's about.... lt's about love.
Love? lt's about love overcoming all obstacles.
And it's set in Switzerland!
-Switzerland?
-Exotic Switzerland! lndia! lndia! lt's set in lndia!
And there's a courtesan.
The most beautiful courtesan in the world.
But her kingdom's invaded by an evil maharajah.
To save her kingdom, she has to seduce the evil maharajah...
...but on the night of the seduction, she mistakes...
...a penniless...a penniless...
...sitar player...
...for the maharajah and falls in love with him!
He wasn't trying to trick her.
He was dressed as a maharajah...
...because he's appearing in a play. l will play the penniless tango-dancing sitar player.
He will sing like an angel...
...but dance like the devil.
Yes, all right.
And what happens next?
The sitar player and the courtesan must hide their love.
The sitar player's sitar is magical. lt only speaks the truth.
And l will play the magical sitar!
You are beautiful.
You are ugly. And you--
And he gives the game away, eh?
-Tell him about the cancan!
-The Tantric cancan--
--is an erotic, spectacular scene that captures the thrusting, vibrant...
...wild, Bohemian spirit...
...that the whole production embodies,
Duke!
-What does that mean?
-The show will be a magnificent...
...opulent, tremendous, stupendous...
...gargantuan bedazzlement!
A sensual ravishment. lt will be....
Spectacular, spectacular

Generally, l like it.
Zidler had an investor...
-...and the Bohemians had a show.
-lt's the end of the century!
The Bohemian revolution is here!
You are a beautiful woman. l love sex.
While the party raged upstairs...
...I tried to write.
But all I could think about was her.
How wonderful life is
Was she thinking about me?
Now you're in...
...the world
Duke? I'm not a duke.
I'm a writer.
He wasn't trying to trick her....
It's about love.
It's about love...
...overcoming all obstacles.
I...
...follow...
...the night
Can't stand...
...the light
When will I begin...
...to live again?
One day I'll fly away
Leave all this to yesterday
What more could your love do for me?
When will love be...
...through with me?
Why live life...
...from dream to dream?
And dread the day...
... when dreaming...
...ends
How wonderful life is
Now you're in...
...the world
One day I'll fly away
Leave all this to yesterday
Why live life...
...from dream to dream?
And dread the day...
... when dreaming...
...ends
One day I'll fly away
Fly...
...fly...
...away
Sorry. l didn't mean-- l saw your light on and l climbed up the-- l wanted to thank you for helping me get the job.
Of course.
Yes, Toulouse was right.
You're...
...very talented. lt will be a wonderful show.
Anyway, l'd better go.
We both have a big day tomorrow.
Wait.
Please wait.
Before, when we were...when we were...
...when you thought l was the Duke...
...you said you loved me, and l wondered-- lf it was just an act?
-Yes.
-Of course. lt felt real.
Christian...
...l'm a courtesan. l'm paid to make men believe what they want to believe.
Silly of me, to think you could fall in love with someone like me.
-l can't fall in love with anyone.
-Can't fall in love?
-A life without love? That's terrible!
-Being on the street is terrible.
Love is like oxygen.
Love is a many-splendored thing.
Love...
...lifts us up where we belong.
Don't start that again.
-All you need is love
-A girl has to eat
-All you need is love
-Or she'll end up on the streets
All you need is love
Love is just a game
I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
The only way of loving me, baby
Is to pay a lovely fee
Just one night
Give me just one night
There's no way
'Cause you can't pay
In the name of love
One night in the name of love
You craZy fool
I won't give in to you
Don't leave me this way
I can't survive
Without your sweet love
Oh, baby
Don't leave me this way
You'd think that people
Would have had enough
Of silly love songs
I look around me and I see
It isn't so
Oh, no
Some people want to fill the world
With silly love songs
Well, what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
Love lifts us up where we belong
Get down! Get down!
Where eagles fly
On a mountain high
Love makes us act like we are fools
Throw our lives away
For one happy day
We could be heroes
Just for one day
You, you will be mean
No, l won't.
And I...
...I'll drink all the time
We should be lovers
We can't do that
We should be lovers
And that's a fact
Though nothing...
... will keep us together
We could steal time
Just for one day
We could be heroes
For ever and ever
We could be heroes
For ever and ever
We can be heroes
Just because I
Will always love you
I can't help loving...
...you
How wonderful life is
Now you're in...
...the world
You're going to be bad for business, l can tell.
How wonderful life is
Now you're in...
...the world
How wonderful life was, now Satine was in the world.
But in the Duke...
...Zidler had gotten much more than he had bargained for.
Converting the Moulin Rouge into a theater will cost a fantastic sum.
So, in return, l would require a contract that...
...binds Satine to me...
...exclusively.
Naturally, l'll require some security: the deeds to the Moulin Rouge.
My dear Duke--
Please! Don't think that l'm naive, Zidler. l shall hold the deeds. And if there are any shenanigans...
...my manservant, Warner...
...will deal with it in the only way...
...you underworld show folk understand.
Satine will be mine. lt's not that l'm a jealous man. l just don't like other people touching my things! l...
...understand...completely...Duke.
Good.
Now that we have an understanding, it appears that...
...you have the means to transform your beloved Moulin Rouge--
--into a theater! l shall woo Satine over supper tonight.
We will have created the world's first...
...completely modern...
...entirely electric, totally Bohemian...
...all-singing, all-dancing stage spectacular!
The show must go on!
Yes, the show would go on.
But Satine would not attend supper that night or the following night.
Mad with jealousy, the evil maharajah...
...forces the courtesan to tell the sitar player she doesn't love him.
"Thank you for curing me of my ridiculous obsession with love"...
...says the sitar player, throwing money at her and leaving the kingdom!
Brilliant! Brilliant!
A life without love?
That's terrible!
Yes. But the sitar player--
Wait! That's my part.
That's my part, Christian!
Don't you dare!
The magic sitar, who can only speak the truth, says:
"The greatest thing you 'll ever learn...
...is just to love and be loved in return."
A picnic, sweet lady?
Oh, but we have so much work to do. lf the writer can carry a basket, you can both do it in my presence.
-So he falls from the roof--
-Yes, l know, l know. Don't tell me.
"The greatest thing you'll ever..."
Still at it, my sweet?
"...master...make...
...contract...." l've so many lines. l've been drilling them over and over.
For try as the Duke may, it was almost too easy...
...for the writer and actress to invent reasons to avoid him.
Mademoiselle Satine, l haven't finished the new scene.
The "Will the lovers be meeting at the sitar player's humble abode?" scene.
May l work on it with you later tonight?
But, my dear, l arranged a magnificent supper for us in the tower.
We can work on it tomorrow.
How dare you! lt cannot wait until tomorrow.
"The lovers will meet at the sitar player's humble abode" scene is crucial.
We'll work tonight until l'm completely satisfied.
Dear Duke, excuse me. l'm sorry.
Nice work, family!
Bright and early tomorrow morning, we begin on Act Two:
The lovers are discovered.
Zidler.
My dear Duke, everything is arranged for that supper in the tower tonight.
You can eat it yourself!
Her affections are waning! lmpossible. l know her work's important, but she's always at it with that writer! lf l don't see her tonight, l'm leaving!
No, Duke! l'll insist
Satine take the night off.
All right.
Eight o'clock, then.
You'll come tonight?
Yes.
-What time?
-Eight o'clock.
-Promise?
-Yes.
Go.
Are you mad?
The Duke holds the deeds to the Moulin Rouge.
He's spending a fortune on you.
Given you a beautiful new dressing room.
He wants to make you a star.
And you're dallying with the writer.
-Harold, don't be rid--
-l saw you together! lt's nothing. lt's just an infatuation. lt's nothing.
The infatuation will end.
Go to the boy.
Tell him it's over.
The Duke is expecting you at 8.
If I should die
This very moment
I wouldn't fear
For I've never known completeness
Like being here
Wrapped in the warmth of you
Loving every breath of you
Why live life...
...from dream...
...to dream?
And dread the day....
How could I know...
...in those last fatal days...

Well, she came up to me after the show, and I thought,
"This lady wants a piece of me."
So I didn't, you know, know what to do.
I was alone, I had nothing in my hand,

She came at me from both sides, somehow, and she just gave me a fucking hug.

Thank you, my name is Hedwig.
Please welcome those ambassadors of Eastern Bloc rock,
The Angry Inch. Here they are, ladies and gentlemen.
And my man Friday...
- through Thursday...
- Yeah!
Yitzhak, ladies and gentlemen.
There's no need, there's none.
Also very talented and so very lucky to be here, right, boys?
- Yeah.
- Yes, Miss Hedwig.
Look out, guys, Immigration!
I've got their passports right here.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you like the pelt?
I want you to be honest, because some bitch stopped me on the way in ‒
"What poor, unfortunate creature had to die for you to wear that?"
"My Aunt Trudy," I replied.
Just walked away.
Just walked away, ladies and gentlemen.
- Hedwig, can we eat dessert?
- What is it? Yes, you can.
I am thrilled. You can join me for the fabulous first night of the St. Louis leg of my world tour.
And when it comes to huge openings, a lot of people think of me.
Many more of you, though, have only recently become aware of me.
Yeah. It took a character assassination piece like this to make you finally pay attention.
But now you're interested, huh?
Intrigued, even?
How did some... slip of a girly-boy from Communist East Berlin become the internationally ignored song stylist barely standing before you?
That's what I want to talk about tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
I don't wanna talk about sudden, undeserved commercial success.
I don't wanna talk about betrayal,
I don't wanna talk about my lawsuit against a certain rock and roll "icon,"
Tommy Gnosis, who, by some freak coincidence, is performing right next door at Busch Stadium.
♪ Try and tear me down ♪
And to whom I taught everything he knows, and has apparently forgotten, about rock & roll!
Yes, this is Phyllis Stein.
Manager of Hedwig and the Angry Inch.
I've been ho ‒
"Inch"! Not "Itch."
Let me speak to Brad, please.
You know I've been holding for 24 minutes?
Yes. Hi, Brad, this is Phyllis.
So what's going on with Bilgewater's?
You make the baby cry.
Well, I hear the entire chain's going under.
Hold on, hold on a second.
- Hedwig! Hedwig!
- We can have a gig in any Bilgewater's nationwide with a 24-hour notice?
Yeah.
And they know what kind of music we play?
Brad, I love you.
Okay, ciao.
People, people, people.
Tomorrow is a travel day.
It's a travel day for Tommy, so it's a travel day for us.
Friday, Chicago.
Tommy's at Soldier Field, and we're at Bilgewater's in the mall down the street.
And the next day, looks like he's ‒
Basically, he's back on the bus.
Phyllis... "basically"?
He's doing a record signing.
Why do you feel the need to lie to me?
Hedwig, please. Come.
I don't think it's going to help our lawsuit if you continue to ‒ if you present the appearance of stalking him.
- Yeah. You know I don't like that word.
- Yes, I know.
Please listen to me.
How about you don't talk to him, and I get someone to steal a photo
- of you two together?
- A photo ‒
You know some rag will run it.
Will really help the lawsuit.
Proves you two know each other.
Please, let me do my job. Please?
Okay.
I'm gonna make some phone calls.
I'm gonna make some phone calls!
All right.
Okay, everybody. Bedski!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I recently found my first diary.
Age two through six.
It was fully illustrated.
As I unrolled the pages,
I realized that so many people have touched me
on my way to the stage tonight.
How can I say who touched me the most?
My father, the American GI?
Could it have been my East German mother?
Pervert!
Get out! Get out!

It is clear that I must find my other half,
but is it a he or a she?
What does this person look like?
Identical to me?
Or somehow complementary?
Does my other half have what I don't?
Did he get the looks?
The luck?
The love?
Were we really separated forcibly,
or did he just run off with the good stuff?
Or did I?
Will this person embarrass me?
What about sex?
Is that how we put ourselves back together again?
Or can two people...
actually become one...
again?
I remember once when I was six years old
I was watching my favorite cartoon on American Forces Network,
"Jesus Was Good."
Eh?
In the year I was born, the wall went up.
And many people decided to move west to freedom.
Mother threw me into a wheelbarrow and headed east.
The Communists gave her a job
teaching sculpture to limbless children.
Most of my time was spent listening to American Forces Radio.

Late at night,
I would listen to the voices of the American masters.
Toni Tennille, Debby Boone,
Anne Murray, who was actually a Canadian working in the American idiom.
And then there were the crypto-homo rockers:
Lou Reed, Iggy Pop,
David Bowie, who was actually an idiom working in America and Canada.
These artists, they left as deep an impression on me as that oven rack did on my face.
To be a young American in muskrat love, soft as an easy chair, not even the chair,
"I am," I said,
"Have I never been mellow?"
And the colored girls sing...

Okay.
Okay.
One day, in the late mid-80s...
I was in my early late 20s.
I had just been dismissed from university after delivering a brilliant lecture on the aggressive influence of German philosophy on rock and roll, entitled,
"You, Kant, Always Get What You Want."
At 26, my academic career was over,
I had never kissed a boy, and I was still sleeping with Mom.
The search for my other half on my side of the wall had proved futile.
Might he be found on the other?
But how to get over? You know?
People died trying.
Such were the thoughts flooding my tiny head, on the day that I was... sunning myself... in an old bomb crater
I had discovered near the wall.
I am naked, face down on a piece of broken church, inhaling a fragrant westerly breeze.
My God, I deserved a break today.
Girl,
I, I sure don't mean to annoy you.
My name is Sergeant Luther Robinson.
My name is Hansel.
Luther is silent for a moment as he stares at my...
"little bishop in a turtleneck."
Hansel?
Well, you must like candy.
I like Gummibärchen.
The taste is completely different from a Gummi Bear,
yet somehow familiar.
It's much sweeter than a Gummi Bear.
Wow.
And softer, too.
I feel so optimistic.
I suddenly recognized the flavor in my mouth.
It's the taste of power.
Damn, Hansel.
I can't believe you're not a girl.
You're so fine.
Why don't you take the whole bag?
He searches my face for news of his fate.
His expression is echoed in scores of tiny faces,
pressing against clear plastic,
panting faces of every imaginable color,
creed, and non-Aryan origin,
fogging up the bag like the windows of a Polish bathhouse.
Ah!
I stumbled naked through the ruins,
back towards blander, less complicated confections,
leaving in my wake a trail of rainbow carnage.
Next day, Hansel follows the trail back,
and on his way finds a Milky Way,
a roll of Necco Wafers,
some Pop Rocks,
and a giant-sized Sugar Daddy named Luther.

He loves me, Mother.
He wants to marry me... and get me the hell out of here.
Get my passport and my camera, Hansel.
It's a simple cut-and-paste job.
We change the photo, and you can use my name...
Hedwig Schmidt.
Not so simple, ladies.
Baby... you know I love you.
I'm always thinking of you.
But I gotta marry you here, in East Berlin.
And that means a full physical examination.
They'd see right away that I have a ‒
No, baby.
To walk away... you gotta... leave something behind.
Am I right, Mrs. Schmidt?
I've always thought so, Luther.
To be free, one must give up a little part of oneself.
And I know just the doctor to take it.

Ugh, I am so sorry.
I was waiting for the phone company.
God, is that his new single?
Don't do it, sweetie!
Please don't say anything to him today.
If you do, he's got the power, know what I mean? He's got the power!
All we need is a snapshot, then they'll know that you were responsible for some of the biggest hits of the millennium, and you will be so fucking rich!
Damn it, looks like the photographer's already inside.
All right, everybody, stay right here.
Hedwig. Hedwig. Hedwig. Hedwig.
Please don't say anything.
Let me handle it.
- Yes. The Phyllis Stein party.
- Who are you with?
We're A&R from A&M.
Actually, this is a private event.
I'm sorry.
- Private event?
- Mm-hmm.
As in, "You're not on the list."
- As in, "Find it."

It's not here.

Hey! Settle down.
- I could have your job!
- I don't think you could.
- Bitches!
- Where's my fucking brooch?
We're going to continue to shadow Tommy's tour.
We're going to squeeze the local press.
But I do not want to blow our wad on my E! channel contact until we get to New York.
It's all about New York. Right?
Honey, I've really thought about it,
I think it's a bad idea, this photo-op.
- It was your idea.
- But I'm second-guessing myself now.
I think...
I don't think you should have any personal contact with Tommy.
- Well, I guess we disagree.
- Honey, we do disagree.
- But, please, listen.
- Did you ‒
Excuse me, did you put a bra in a dryer?
What?
Did you put a bra in a dryer?
- Yes.
- How many times do I have to tell you?
You don't put a bra in a dryer! It warps!
Hedwig, please, it's a bra.
You can have one of mine. Please!
Ugh.
I'm so sorry.
You know, ladies and gentlemen, the road is my home.
- My home, the road.
- Hear, hear.
And when I think about all the people
I have come upon in my travels,
I have to think about the people who have come upon me.
Tommy, can you hear me?
Yeah!
From this milk-less tit, you sucked the very business we call show!
Okay.
You wanna know about Tommy Gnosis?
Yeah!
Okay, I'll tell you about Tommy Gnosis.
After my divorce, I scraped by with babysitting gigs and odd jobs.
Mostly the jobs we call "blow."
I had lost my job at the base PX, and I had lost my gag reflex.
You do the math.
I sat for the baby of General Speck.
He was the commander of the nearby army fort, and his other son was... yeah, the artist formerly known as my buttboy.
We're talking about
Tommy Speck at this time.
Tommy Speck was a 17-year-old classic rock-loving,
"Dungeons and Dragons" obsessed,
Jesus freak with a fish on his truck.
I found him incredibly... hot.
I had recently returned to my first love of music.
I had tried singing once, back in Berlin.
They threw tomatoes after the show...
I had a nice salad.
But newly motivated,
I got myself a cheap electric piano and I found a couple of Korean sergeants' wives who churned out a mean rhythm section.
♪ Denial! ♪
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, thank you... both of you.
That song was by Mr. Kurt Cobain.
Now that kid's got a future, huh?
How about Kwahng-Yi on guitar, ladies and gentlemen!
Give it up! Kwahng-Yi!
Give it up, Kwahng.
You know, I'd like to take it down a little. Right now.
What do you say, girls?
This is actually the first song
I've ever written.
And, it's written for a guy to sing.
I know a lot of you guys out there tonight, a lot better than some of you would care to admit.
And I know that a few of you kick some karaoke ass.
So... if you're looking for your big, breakout single, you might wanna put a bid on this one tonight, ladies and gentlemen, because we are talking to Phil Collins's people, right?
But then again, aren't we all?

Your show... that song...
My dad gave me this guitar to apologize for being such a pathetic little dictator.
- He sang me songs.
- Classics.
The bands were new to me.
Yeah!
Boston, Kansas,
America, Europe, Asia.
Travel exhausts me.
Where are you from, Hedwig?
I told him my story.
I'm from East Berlin.
There was a big war.
Have you...
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal lord and savior?
No, but I...
I love his work.
No. What he was saving us from was his fucking father.
I mean, what kind of god creates Adam in his image and then pulls Eve out of him to keep him company?
And then tells them not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge?
I mean, he was so micromanaging.
So was Adam.
But Eve...
Eve just wanted to know shit.
She took a bite of the apple, and she found out what was good and what was evil.
Then she gave it to Adam, so he would know, because they were in love.
And that was good, they now knew.
Hedwig... would you give me the apple?
The words falling from those lips.
And his eyes...
his irises were clear cylinders of surprising depth...
and emptiness.
Only a few puddles of bluish pain sloshed around inside.
Same blue as my eyes.
At the time,
Tommy's performance options were limited
to the occasional guitar mass.
I initiated a six-month curriculum of rock history...
lyrics,
grooming,
and vocal training.
♪ Do, do-do, do-do... ♪
For his graduation present,
I gave him his name:
Tommy Gnosis,
the Greek word for knowledge.
We collaborated.
Songs exploded out of us.
Teenage girls started showing up.
In three months, we were outgrossing monster trucks in Wichita.
With that kind of money coming in,
I was able to devote myself entirely to our career.
We were very happy.
Honey, what is wrong?
My dad.
Fucking parents!
You're gonna blow my house down.
Honey, come here.
Just let it go, sweetie.
Let it go.
Oh, it's gone.
I feel it. It's gone.
I'm very much aware that we haven't kissed in all the months we've been together.
In fact, he's maintained a near perfect ignorance
of the front of me.
Honey, sweetie, you're choking me.
Sweetie, let go. Take it easy.

When Eve was still inside Adam, they were in paradise.
That's right, honey.
When she was separated from him, that's when paradise was lost.
So when she enters him again, paradise will be regained.
However you want it, honey.
Just kiss me while we do it.

I don't care if you have my passport.
Fuck you! I'm going to Guam!

I want ‒ Ya, I want a divorce from you.

[But for the person I tried to reach,] he'll pick it up, and I'll be able to talk to him.
I try to be responsible, but it's hard.
If you worry about what you're saying,
I get writer's block.
Kind of like, "I can't say that.
That's too harsh. Can't say this."
I have to block it out and trust my heart that I'm doing the right thing.
Pretty spit...
I was spitting.
- Chill out. Chill out.
- That's my style. That's my new style.
- That's my new style.
- 'Pac, chill out.
That's my new style.
Hey, have a good summer.
Have a good summer, bitch!
But I'm not saying
I didn't make mistakes.
Like some of the things I said when
I was fighting the Hughes brothers.
I beat up the directors to Menace II Society.
- All right, tell them why you did that.
- These chump, punk, slump...
- You'll be able to rebuttal to that.
- No, they better come now.
Check this out, they fired me in a roundabout, punk, snitch way.
So I caught them on the streets and beat they behinds.
I was a menace to the
Hughes brothers. It ain't over!
I still got more for you chumps!
I read what you said about me!
I'm gonna kick their ass!
My big mouth.
Mind y'all business, I'll mind mine.
I do what I gotta do, you do what you gotta do.
Long as I give you 12 tracks, you give me my $12, and we even.
I don't gotta be a role model.
I don't gotta hold your hand.
I don't gotta do shit.
My big mouth.
I got a big mouth, can't help it.
- I talk from my heart, I'm real.
- We talked about people in this business that you feel don't have a love for their own people.
We was talking about
Spike Lee, Arsenio Hall,
Eddie Murphy and the rest of them.
I thought I was charming, but I was immature. I did things without thinking.
Michael Jackson, Randy Jackson,
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, all of them.
She wants to not be black, but sell to blacks.
I don't appreciate her going out of her way to say she's not black.
My actions came before thought.
Things that I did, things I said.
So many things I wanna take back.
Eddie Murphy, with all that dough he's making, hasn't done nothing for us.
- He does a lot of charity.
- Charity doesn't get to the ghetto.
Everybody knows that.
I was young and dumb.
Being mad at Spike Lee and all those people, all of that.
The thing I said of Quincy Jones, he shouldn't mess with white women.
I said I was sorry personally for that.
I didn't think of how it would hurt people.
I'm gonna catch y'all in traffic and be the roughest nigga you ever seen.
That turned into more legal problems.
The People truly believe that
Mr. Shakur has shown no remorse whatsoever for his action in this case.
We view Mr. Shakur's appearance on Yo! MTV Raps as bragging.
He was proud of what he did and does not feel sorry.
I just want to say, judge, that I have a great deal of remorse.
As far as I want you to treat me different, I don't want that.
I just want the chance to make right from all the bad things that I got.
I got things against me and people that look up to me.
I don't want the last place they see me to be jail.
I guess it's now time for me to render the sentence.
I obviously find that the defendant is a talented individual.
However, this court believes that jail time is warranted with a battery with some injury involved.
The defendant will serve 15 days in the county jail.
I think the judge was fair.
I still don't feel like I got the decision that I wanted, but he was as fair as he could be.
Really, to my homeboys, I mean, a fight is a fight, battery is battery.
A two and a half minute problem just cost me 15 days in jail, and that was lenient.
But my most serious legal problems came from women.
How I was acting with women.
The Underground just don't stop
For ho's, I get around
I will no longer sit passively, allowing this degradation to be continued by our children.
I think we live in a very sexist society, and everybody's pointing the finger at me.
When somebody asks me,
"Do you exploit women?"
With her permission, I might smack a girl on the butt in the video.
I might be drinking champagne, but everything in moderation, and everything with class.
Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips
See me jocking, put a little twist
In her hips because I'm watching
I don't have to always do a song with the good woman.
I don't see women as all one thing.
I think all women are different.
You wonder why they call you bitch
You wonder why they call you bitch
We African-American women, particularly, are tired of being called ho's, bitches and sluts by our children.
Dear Ms. DeLores Tucker
You keep stressing me
Fucking with a motherfucking mind
I figured you wanted to know
Why we call them ho's bitches
If I do something that has a bad woman, people go, "He hates women."
If I do something that has a bad woman, people go, "He hates women."
I don't think like that. But there are definitely a type of female, label them a bitch, whose main thing is to get what they can, and they revel in breaking a nigga's heart and taking what he owns.
Shut the fuck up!
There's male bitches too.
Women know there are bitches.
I don't know why they're surprised.
They know. They say it louder.
They think we say they're all bitches.
That's not what we're saying.
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares
And don't nobody else care
That's "Keep Ya Head Up" and "Get Around".
I said, "I'm gonna write a song about women like my mom,
"who represent a strong black woman." I did that.
I'll rap about women I see daily.
That's "Get Around".
If I just did "Keep Ya Head Up", it makes me seem more than I am, but I'm just a normal man.
America, America
- God shed his grace on thee
- Stop.
I'm gonna close the door.
Come on, Mr. Cameraman.
This is some real private shit that's about to happen, Mr. Cameraman.
Bye.
Anyway, I'll let you hear the sounds.
Is there a double standard for men being promiscuous?
Yeah, but we didn't start that double standard.
- I'm not saying you did.
- And I'm not saying it's fair.
I'm saying this is how it is. How can we rap about a world that is not like that?
- This is how it is.
- Do you look down on males if they're as promiscuous as women?
I don't look down on anybody that's promiscuous.
I only look down on people who don't control the situation.
If a girl sleeps with a lot of guys, she's still my homegirl.
You're only a bitch, not if you sleep with a lot of guys, but if you're sleeping with them for money.
- So you put a price on yourself.
- Because they have a nice car.
Guys, when they sleep around, they do it for free.
At that time, a lot of girls, they'd seen my face on TV so many times, they wanna be associated with that person.
It's the fame that gets these people.
It's not me. It's the fame.
I've seen females look at me when they didn't know me, and I can see it, nothing.
Then someone whisper who I was, it's this glare in the eye.
- You make yourself want them.
- How do you feel about that?
I don't understand how people can stand next to you one year, and next year, they cannot.
They're going crazy, screaming.
They can't take it that you're there.
But last year I was in the same club, walking around, lonely like a motherfucker.
Couldn't get a date or a dance.
I was too skinny, too something, and now, "He's just adorable.
He's just, oh!"
But I still enjoyed sex without the emotional connection.
And it was always a fantasy for me to have sex with a lot of people in the room.
But I didn't play one situation correctly.
Rap singer Tupac Shakur was released on $50,000 bail today, accused of a sexual attack in a New York hotel.
The singer was arrested Thursday night after a woman claimed he and three other men overpowered her in a hotel suite.
- Are you disappointing your fans?
- Very, but they're gonna support me.
With bodyguards and attorneys, he went into Manhattan Criminal Court.
There, the rapper and two friends were charged with first-degree sodomy.
The allegations stem from an incident last Thursday in which a woman claims she was held down as he and two others allegedly sodomized her.
The allegations by this young lady are without merit.
Defense attorneys say the woman went there consensually, and answering machine tapes that indicate her interest in Shakur were erased by police.
OK, so you tell me when your lawyers have asked you to stop.
The girl who claims that...
What does she claim?
- I can't even say it, man.
- OK.
But technically, it's a rape case.
I wasn't convicted of no rape charge.
My charge was sexual abuse, forcibly touching the buttocks.
I have a female saying that...
I can't say it, but...
It just bothers me so much, you know?
To go through my life and everything I did, coming out of a family and household with just women, to get to this point to have a woman say that I took something from her.
It was hard.
It was an emotional day for a 20-year-old female fan, who admitted that she had consensual sex with Shakur on Sunday night, four days before her alleged rape in the hotel room.
During her cross-examination, defense attorney Michael Warren painted a picture of a starstruck, naive girl anxious to have sex with Shakur.
Word is, you had a relationship with this woman prior to all this friction.
If you can say that's a relationship.
I bumped in a club. I seen her.
Let's use a clinical term.
There was oral copulation?
Yeah, she performed oral sex on the dance floor.
A lot of guys could say what they wouldn't do and what they would do, but when it happens, you know...?
- Yeah.
- It just goes down. And it's... Really.
She did some things there at the club, and we got together later that night.
I saw her again another time with these guys that introduced me to her.
Everybody was having a good time, nothing sexual, just a good time.
Me and her went in, she gave me a massage, went to sleep, woke up, she's screaming,
"Rape, rape." I raped her.
And she's yelling at me, "This is not the last you're gonna see of me."
I'm cursing her out because I'm not thinking she's really gonna do that.
And the next thing I know,
I'm going to jail.
In your opinion there was no truth to the sexual abuse charges?
Not on my part at all.
The defense pounded away at her, asking her why she didn't scream for help at the time of the alleged attack.
The woman testified that Shakur's friends said:
"Tupac needs his fans.
Don't go to the White Man with this.
"Millions of girls would love to be in your shoes right now."
What about your cronies?
That was a big misconception.
The people with me weren't friends.
- Why were they in your room?
- I hang with lots of people.
And that's how I am.
It's similar to like you said, about Led Zeppelin. They don't know all of the people with them.
This guy got the weed?
OK, you can kick it.
Got the money?
You can kick it.
This guy has connections to the clubs?
OK, you can kick it. I don't know him.
But that was my fault, I had that kind of environment around me.
I didn't do nothing. I'm charged with being in concert with some guys.
Well, where are they at?
Why me? Because I'm Tupac...
I'm not mad at them.
I'm mad at the system.
I don't want nobody to go to jail, but I don't wanna go for something I didn't do.
I just don't wanna be the scapegoat.
I just couldn't believe this was going on in my life.
See the cameras. It wasn't like I had a chance for justice like a normal citizen.
Hi, Tupac. Can you tell me how you're doing today?
Well, I just had to listen to the prosecution's closing argument, and it was so far from the truth that it has me drained at the end of the day.
But I'm leaving it in the hands of the jury.
I'm learning a lot about people's innermost fears in this trial.
It's not even about my trial no more.
It's just about
Ioud rap music, tattoo-having thugs.
It's about some nightmare that these people are having.
I can't understand why it's so close.
There's no evidence I sodomized her, even though you put that in the paper.
Print the facts so everybody can sort it out.
My life is ruined because nobody has a chance to get the facts.
Fact is, there was no semen found.
No semen found, no forcible entry, no entry into the anal, no nothing.
I wanted to explain it.
If you could go back to the night when the abuse occurred,
- Is there anything you'd do differently?
- Yeah.
I would not have closed my eyes until she was out of the room, until everybody was out of the room.
So when you left the room and left her with those people...
I didn't leave her with those people or bring her to them.
- She came over?
- Right.
She came over, knew those people, knew everything.
I just didn't grab her out of there.
I'm guilty of not being a smart man, not being a goodhearted man,
I guess, or being more considerate.
At any point, were you aware she was involved in something she...
- Cut. That's a problem right there.
- Excuse me.
None of these legal matters can be asked.
I have a list of the stuff you'll have to cut out. Sorry.
- All right.
- The gentleman is out on bail.
I see.
I couldn't defend myself.
This would never have happened to anybody else.
They have no evidence on me, and it's about to come out.
Now my life is over.
This is a year later.
A year after the world's been thinking I'm a rapist.
The whole world owes me an apology.
I went through it and didn't kill myself like Kurt Cobain.
And I should, because this is some crazy madness.
Central, I got a black male shot at 48th and 7th.
Last night, just after midnight, at 723 7th Avenue, that's between 48th and 49th Street, rap star Tupac Shakur and three members of his group were robbed and shot.
They shot me, straight up.
I just kept thinking,
"They really did shoot me."
When I wasn't dead, immediately I was like, "Oh, man."
I was like, "No, this ain't it."
I know how it's gonna be when I die.
It's gonna be no noise.
You ain't gonna hear people screaming. I'm gonna fade out.
And I didn't... None of that was there.
I was like, "I got shot five times.
I'm not dead. They missed. I'm back."
When Shakur resisted, he was shot five times, twice in the head and twice in the groin area.
And his most serious wound, a gunshot through the hand, hitting an artery in his thigh.
He's listed in serious but stable condition.
Until it happened, I really did believe no black person would ever shoot me.
I believed that I didn't have to fear my own community.
You know, I was like,
"I represent them.
"I'm their ambassador to the world.
They would never do me wrong."
I believe that this was a robbery.
Anybody who was gonna walk into that building was gonna be robbed.
The police don't wanna find out who shot me. They're happy.
As far as that Vibe interview, just read everything over and read my reply, read their reply, read what people say.
Everybody that was there knows what happened.
My recollection was, I was shooting a video, the second half of "Warning", which is the B-side of "Big Poppa", and I was shooting around the block.
And I heard my man was up at the studio doing a Junior M.A.F.I.A. session.
So I got off at the reception area, and I saw Andre and Little Shawn.
I said, "What's up?" about to get on the elevator, and he comes out shot.
The Tupac article had me pissed off, you know what I'm saying?
Because first of all, he dissed my man, saying he turned his back on him, and I know for a fact it didn't happen.
And, like, the rumors that's spreading is on some tip like we set him up.
And that's crazy.
As soon as he comes out shot, me and my man try to sit him down.
He called his mom. He asked my man if he can roll him a blunt.
We asked if he was all right. He's like,
"Yeah, I don't know what's going on."
We were just trying to comfort him.
Andre Harrell called the ambulance.
And everybody there was very supportive of him.
It was just the total opposite. He came out and everyone ran to him.
It was nothing but love and concern.
They got different accounts of it, and I'm the one with the bullet wounds.
I also understand that if you was to get shot five times, your mind is just completely spinning.
You're real confused about your situation.
It'll make you say things you don't mean.
I was there for the whole thing. No one else was there for the whole thing.
I don't know the purpose of why the story was said in another context.
It's not important that others know what happened. I said it.
Now that I said it, it's dead.
Believe me or not, I did what I had to.
God knows the truth.
There's no religion about getting shot.
I don't want any converts.
After getting shot, I was like,
"Shit, I don't know who to trust."
In a bizarre twist of events,
Tupac Shakur checked himself out of
Bellevue Hospital Wednesday night.
After surgery, Tupac checked himself out of Bellevue against doctor's orders.
It was just time to leave.
I didn't feel safe there.
I kept getting these crazy phone calls.
At that point, I'm just paranoid, just bugging out.
I couldn't sleep or rest. I was like,
"I'm just tired, and I wanna just..."
And I felt like I'm like a victim, a target.
I couldn't even sleep at home.
People could kill me at home.
And are the police gonna come in and kill me?
You know, is there secret police?
I was so deep into the weed at that point.
And I was like,
"I'm petrified. I'm vulnerable."
I felt like just a prisoner to my own fame.
That's why I wanted to die at that point.
I felt like, "If everybody's so worried, why ain't nobody came to help?"
- Mr. Shakur?
- Open up, please. Open up.
- Excuse me.
- Step back, please.
- Just keep it tight, that's all.
- How are you this morning?
The jury deliberated, then, after days of twists worthy of a Hollywood drama,
Tupac Shakur has finally had one question answered.
Tonight, the jury found him guilty of three counts of sexual abuse, but innocent on six other charges, including sodomy.
Please, give me some space.
Please, man.
Why did you decide to leave the hospital?
Please, y'all are not letting me get through, man. Let me get through!
- Back it up.
- Why did you leave?
And sentencing for this trial has yet to be scheduled.
Where I was sent was a maximum-security penitentiary.
I know when I was young,
I couldn't wait to get to jail, straight up.
I mean, I was scared and everything, but I felt that's part of being a man.
Now that I'm here, this is not the spot.
I know everybody that comes out says,
"This ain't the spot." This isn't the spot.
Somebody tells you when to get up, when you can shower, do this, do that.
They can speak to you any way they want to, and you've gotta accept it.
You can die here, know what I mean?
Yesterday, a dude was murdered.
He wasn't in here on no murder beef.
He was in on a drug beef.
He's gone. He's dead in jail, you know what I mean?
By another prisoner who had life.
He had nothing to lose, you know what I mean?
I came to jail. I'm telling you, it's dirty.
It's filthy. It's like you're an animal.
At first, me and the guards had problems.
I got smacked and treated bad.
They did whatever they could to break me because I used to talk a lot of shit.
As soon as I got there, they went,
"There he goes, the rich nigger."
I was like, "Oh, shit, he said nigger!"
Everybody's looking at me like, "So?"
And I was like, "My God, this is where
I'm gonna be staying?"
He just said "nigger"!
You've got "niggas" in one of your records.
Niggas. He's talking about niggers.
Niggers was the ones on the rope, hanging off the thing.
Niggas is the ones with gold ropes, hanging out at clubs.
I learned things there. In jail, it's like how we should be in life, humble.
I was talking to skinheads because if you don't like black people, all right, that's fine.
That's your opinion.
I want people to respect my opinion when I'm rapping, so I'll respect yours.
You treat me with respect, I'll treat you with respect, and we'll get along.
This skinhead, "hate black people" all over, getting autographs for cousins.
I accomplished something.
I know, by him getting my autograph, that meant something to me.
He couldn't hate black people and get my autograph.
- The food was terrible, I guess.
- Oh, my goodness.
They've got this liver surprise thing.
The liver surprise. They're trying to pump that jail on the menu.
They're trying to get it to go prime-time, get it in the rotation.
I was like, "We had this yesterday.
I liked it already, goddamn."
- No Tater Tots?
- No. Are you crazy? Tater Tots?
I used to get baked potatoes with a huge finger imprint on it.
- All right.
- It was bad.
No, you don't wanna get me started.
Jell-O with hair all in the mold.
I'd be like, "Damn, man, how are you gonna mess up Jell-O?"
Jell-O is so wholesome and family-like.
It just ruins it for me.
To have a hair in there, yeah.
I mean, I'm like, "Come on,
Bill Cosby pumps this, man!"
Put the hair in my Jell-O.
And you can't go, "There's a hair in my Jell-O. I'd like to send this back.
"Can I see the cook, please?"
The cook is a big dude named Bubba Joe.
The first eight months I spent in solitude 23 hours a day, reading.
I wrote a script called Live 2 Tell.
I got How to Write a Screenplay, that big famous book by Syd Field.
I got that, and I remembered all of the scripts I ever read, and I wrote one.
I read a lot of good books.
I read a lot of Maya Angelou's books.
The Art of War by Sun Tzu.
But in terms of writing music and lyrics, I couldn't do it.
Everybody's like, "He's in jail now.
He's gonna have the bomb album."
But it's the opposite.
Prison kills your spirit, straight up.
It kills your spirit.
I couldn't write. My inspiration was gone because I was a caged animal.
But when I was in jail, a lot of people supported me.
Jasmine Guy, Jada Pinkett,
Mickey Rourke, he just wrote me funny stories.
The name that sticks out the most,
I'll keep saying this, is Tony Danza.
To me, he is the bomb forever.
I will be his number one fan forever, because when I got his letter,
I was like, "Whoa!"
I was screaming out to everybody,
"Guess who wrote me!"
They had a story on the local news that Madonna was coming to visit me.
Madonna has so much power that the guards gave me an extra shower because they thought she was coming to visit me.
I had guards walking me downstairs, everything, trying to peep a look.
- Did she come?
- No. No, I'm glad.
- But you got the extra shower?
- Hey, I got the shower.
The person that supported me the most was my mother.
When my mother got clean, we got real close again.
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand, for a woman
It ain't easy, trying to raise a man
I don't blame her for anything.
My mom's the bomb, you know.
The world's best mom.
- You are appreciated
- Lady
Don't you know we love you
Sweet lady
"Dear Mama" is the song
I wrote for my mother.
But it's also for all the mothers.
I'm proud of that.
It affected a lot of people.
It was from Me Against the World, which was completed before I went to jail.
It's just me against the world
Me against the world, baby
It was the number one record.
Me Against the World was one of those... My career highs.
It was a trip in jail.
They'd say stuff like, "You're in jail.
Won't be any rapping for a long time."
I'd be like, "My album is number one in the country.
"It just beat Bruce Springsteen."
And they'd be like,
"Go back to your cell."
I used to get Entertainment Weekly and see where my record was and just trip out and be like,
"Number one in the whole country."
To me, it will always be my favorite, and jail made me wanna dig deeper.
It took five bullets for me to see what was really going on.
In jail, you get perspective, and you start looking at things differently, like everything is not so important.
You know, you try not to take it personal.
Because you're talking to killers.
They say something you don't like, you can't say, "What?"
You gotta be like, "OK, look man, would you mind not calling me...?"
Anger management like a mother.
In jail, I tried not to have negative feelings towards nobody.
It's not like I wanted to get out and go shoot somebody up.
People said, "You softened up."
Ain't nothing soft. Nothing changed.
If anything, my mentality was like,
"Trust nobody.
"Trust nobody."
It's not like I'm untouchable.
I could be killed as soon as I get out.
I just thought,
"I already took five bullets,
"and if I can help it,
I don't plan on taking more."
Rapper, actor and convict, Tupac
Shakur, walked out of jail last week, bailed out to the tune of $1.4 million by
Suge Knight of Death Row Records, which signed Shakur to a deal.
My closest friends did me in.
My closest friends, my homeys.
I took care of their whole family, took care of everything,
Iooked out for them, put them in the game, turned on me.
So I just thought, "How could I make them sorry they ever did this to me?
"How can I come back, like,
50 times stronger and better?"
Fear is stronger than love. Remember that. Fear is stronger than love.
The love I gave meant nothing when it came to fear.
No question, sign with Death Row.
Suddenly, I was out on bail, pending appeal.
If I win my appeal, which, if God wills, I will,
I would've done 11 months for nothing.
You see that, judge? I didn't curse.
Probation people, I didn't curse.
Give me my props. Let me stay free.
I was relieved, happy to be home.
I wanted to drive up and down Sunset because I love L.A. with a passion.
I love Sunset, everything about L.A.
Can I get tatted up real quick?
I want a crown here.
You know, the energy, that's L.A.
- Hello?
- I'm saying, we on Venice Beach. It's what you do.
I've been in jail 11 months, Tabitha.
You're supposed to put "I love you".
You got to let me get a look at something.
It's a trip when last week you were in a cell, and then, next week, I'm up at Monty's with Cristal champagne and filet mignon and lobster and shrimps.
Everybody went, "Let me take you out.
You're home? Let me take you to this!"
We was all up in Roscoe's.
I even celebrated at El Pollo Loco because I was dreaming about
El Pollo Loco the whole time.
Then I went straight to the studio.
And I did 24 tracks in less than two weeks.
You can mix it later and have niggas that love being in the studio just add the drumbeat and shit. You can do that after the rappers leave.
That's when it's fresh.
Get that beat popping, throw them niggas on the track, put it down.
Everybody will listen, be like,
"This is the hook."
We'll go lay the hook.
That's the song.
Plus, I had so much to say,
I figured this was the best way to vent, instead of paying some psychotherapist $50 million.
I went in the studio. It was cheaper.
Here we go! California, get up!
Out on bail, fresh out of jail
California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene
I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of the West Side player
Where cowards die
And the strong ball
Only in Cali, where we riot, not rally
To live and die
In L.A., we wear Chucks, not Ballies
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits
And ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution
We collide with other crews
You gotta realize one thing:
Tupac is Death Row.
I feel I have more than just a business relationship with him.
He can be like a brother, a friend.
I like everyone on the record company.
I like Suge, Snoop and Dre.
I hang out with them anyway, now it's official.
This is Tupac and Dr. Dre, and this is the Week in Rock!
- Week in Rock, baby!
- Week in Rock, baby!
I came out, I was like,
"Dre, I want some beats right now."
He's like, "I'm working on
'California Love'."
I said, "You know you owe me this.
"I'm new on Death Row, fresh out of jail.
"You ain't gonna be finishing your album soon."
I love collaborating with creative people that's as talented as 'Pac.
He got right in and wrote his lyrics while he was behind the mike and dropped it, and it's funky.
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
Me coming to Death Row, for another reason was Snoop.
Please welcome
America's Most Wanted,
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac.
The man got so much style.
Ya'll know we down with this rock thing, nine-six flavor, Death Row.
But who knew it would last, this West Side staff?
Yep, yep, yep. This is me and Snoop,
"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted", the bomb track. It's the first single.
It's gonna be like the anthem of West Coast rap.
This is gonna shake the whole music scene, guaranteed.
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party
Oh, shit
You done fucked up now
You done put two of
America's Most Wanted
In the same motherfucking place
At the same motherfucking time
Y'all niggas about to feel this
Break out the champagne glasses
Picture perfect
I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision
My intention's to get richer
With the S-N-double-O-P Dogg
My fucking homey
You's a cold-ass nigga
On them hogs
I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom
Waiting on the outcome
Me and Snoop represent the nucleus of the entire ghetto.
Snoop represents the more calm, all legit, by the book, no waves, let's get our business handled.
You're doing your job every day
And then you work so hard
Till your hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life
And about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun
So we die by the gun's kids
Tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in a black Benz
And trying to do a show a day
I represent the hard-core, no-holds- barred, no-prisoners, relentless thug.
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency
And dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers
And so we made it
We both represent both sides of the game.
The calm one and the relentless one.
My nigga, Dogg, with me
Eternally the most wanted
Here's my commercial for Death Row.
If you come to Death Row, you will see your art brought to a bigger plateau, and you will be paid one of these days.
Death Row. Count with me.
Count with me.
This is for my homeboys in jail.
These are 100s.
And they ain't counterfeit.
If I said it was the money, the struggle continues.
I got money, but I have to pay everybody even more money.
I owe money to Death Row.
So it's not just, "Oh, he's paid.
He's living large." It's not like that.
People wanna sue you, and I have to settle for this and that when I know I didn't do anything, just because it's like:
"I don't wanna go to court another eight months." Makes you work harder.
Next year, Death Row is gonna print our own money.
We make so much, we need to start printing our own.
It's gonna be me and Suge on the $100 bill.
Me, Suge and Damu gonna be on the $100 bill.
I felt I'm getting pimped.
This is the $100 bill on Death Row money, here.
But you have to come up, start from the bottom and work up to the top.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome acclaimed rap artist and Grammy nominee, Tupac.
People fail to realize this is not just play. I work.
Run! Scatter, scatter!
Drag K off the stage.
Y'all come on, man.
Do it for real, man. One, two, three.
When it's time to get down and do my business, I'm going to.
I can't get no blood on the set?
Shit.
I believe I'm more responsible, more mature and more focused.
You don't say you need me
You don't sing me love songs
Y'all don't bring us flowers anymore
When I was in jail, I couldn't remember why I was rapping.
But I was away from it so long, I said,
"I really like going to the studio.
"I really like creating."
Living held down
My game plan, to be trained
And military mind of a thug lord
I like music, and I like acting.
I like doing it.
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky
I can be me. I can be whoever because I'm true to me.
The reason I sell six million records, the reason I can go to jail and come out without a scratch, the reason I am who I am is because I can look into my face and find my soul.
It's there. I didn't sell it.
So lash out and get a glass
Done finally got his own drink
Call it the best
Introducing a special brew
Made for a chosen few
I'm thugged out
While Snoop Dogg's sipping blue
I thought, "I'm a superpower.
Death Row is a superpower.
"Let's combine superpowers and ally."
Damu! My dog's going crazy, ready to kill a few people.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- He wanna kill.
I love my artists.
I don't consider my people artists.
I consider them family.
It's just a big difference, if they decided to turn in rapping or singing, they'd still be my homeboys.
We'd still travel together.
If they needed something, what's mine will still be theirs.
It's no situation where I'm dealing with them strictly for business, because they're good.
It's not like that.
You've gotta have more respect for your people.
Plus we've got a Death Row East going on.
- I'm sure you heard about that.
- Tell me about that.
Hold on. Damu! Damu, sit!
But Death Row has a reputation for having a thug-like mentality.
Won't that get you in trouble?
Death Row has a bigger reputation for success than anything else.
The reason for all of the fear involves the world of this man, the man getting out of the limousine.
Six-foot-three, 335-pound
Marion Knight, known by the nickname of "Suge", short for "Sugar".
It's an efficient camp over here, professional, business-oriented.
I like that.
At the age of only 30, and with a lengthy criminal record, including three felony convictions,
Suge Knight has managed to become the head of a $100 million record company and one of the most powerful and feared men in the music industry.
The controversy over Death Row Records and its owner being sort of a gangster.
Everybody's asking about Death Row.
- Suge ain't no gangsta. He's chilling.
- No?
No, man, Suge a rider.
I know what good morals are, but you're supposed to disregard good morals when you're living in a crazy, bad world.
If you're in hell, how can you live like an angel?
You're surrounded by devils, trying to be an angel?
That's like suicide.
I'd like to tell Tupac to keep his guards up. We're with him.
One other thing I'd like to say, any artist out there that want to be an artist and wants to stay a star and don't wanna have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row.
When I got out of jail, the West Coast-
East Coast shit was really starting.
Wait, the East Coast don't love
Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg?
The East Coast ain't got no love for Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Death Row?
West Coast was Death Row.
The East Coast was Bad Boy.
Check this out.
I'm the executive producer that a comment was made about earlier.
Everybody thought it was a war, a war for record sales and attention.
But to me it was personal.
I love the East Coast.
I'm from the East Coast.
But I felt like Puffy and Biggie wanted to dirty up everything I worked for.
So it made me come back more relentless.
I'm mad at Biggie. I'm rushing the nigga. What's the problem?
Yo, Piggie, man, we got it going on, baby.
It's on and cracking, man.
He's gone, baby. You the man.
So I directed videos.
'Pac, you alive? I mean, you safe?
Man, I'm so happy you're free.
Yeah? Happy to see you, lying piece of shit.
'Pac, please don't kill me.
It was Buff's idea.
- No, man.
- I'm just a rapper.
Please don't take me out of the game.
I ain't going to kill you.
We was homeboys once, Pig.
Once we homeboys, we always homeboys, even if you is a fat phony.
And I did a song with Faith, Biggie's wife.
Faith's my homegirl. I just want to send a shout-out to Faith. Hey, girl.
Then I did "Hit 'Em Up".
That's why I fucked your bitch,
You fat motherfucker
Which is a classic battle record.
First off, fuck your bitch
And the clique you claim
West Side, when we ride
Come equipped with game
You claim to be a player
But I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys
Niggas fucked for life
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug living out of prison
Pistols in the air
Biggie, remember when I used
To let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch
To let you sleep in the house
- Now it's all about Versace
- You copied my style
- Five shots couldn't drop me
- I took it and smiled
Now I'm about set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug
That you love to hate
Grab your Glocks
When you see Tupac
Call the cops when you see Tupac
Who shot me?
But you punks didn't finish that
You're about to feel
The wrath of a menace
Everything happened so fast at that point.
I was looking at things, the East Coast-West Coast thing, it just got out of control.
Dudes was getting killed, and I felt responsible.
But I couldn't stop it.
We ain't mad at the whole New York, just certain people.
I got this project coming out along with some brothers called One Nation.
It's like an East Coast-West Coast collaboration to kill this whole new vibe.
Everybody want it to be a war between the East Coast and West Coast.
It's really a problem with two rappers.
The East Coast-West Coast thing is something journalists are making up to get paid off, so it can drag out and everybody can have albums. They perpetuate this, so it can be drama.
When it go down, don't look at me and Biggie and be like, "Why is there a big
East Coast/West Coast war?"
When you're shooting this to 3,300 homes, 300 countries, telling them about a war that they would never know exists.
That's where information becomes a problem.
We both need to exercise greater restraint.
Damn, sometimes life gets messed up.
When I was on Death Row,
I was successful but not happy.
Tupac, your life has been marred by considerable pain.
Do you think you'll get to the point where you can live a normal life?
No. But, I...
I'm going for it. I'm trying for it, and until then
I have to make the life that I do live as happy as I can and try to do the best with what I have.
Live the best life I can live, be as happy as I can be.
Nothing is perfect for anybody,
I don't think.
I felt trapped.
They say, "You made your bed, lay in it"?
I tried to move.
I can't move to no other bed.
I felt I can't live a different lifestyle.
This the life they gave me, this the life I made.
I felt I can't change, not for the courts, not for the parole board, not for nobody. This is it.
I also felt like something was gonna happen to me because I'm paranoid.
And I put it in my videos.
That nigga ain't want none.
I been drinking. Where he at?
No, no, no, where he at?
Yo, watch out.
It was a prophecy.
I had a prophecy about my death.
That's why I go in the studio and do three songs a day, get things ready.
We don't have time or the luxury to spend all of this time doing one song. We don't have it.
If I die, it can happen.
If anything were to happen to me, that album's ready to go.
So it's all good.
I felt as if the only thing that can kill me is death, and even then my music will live forever.
At approximately 9:00 p.m., security cameras at the MGM Grand captured Tupac, Suge Knight and members of the Death Row entourage beating an alleged South Side Crip,
Orlando Anderson.
Tupac, Suge and others jumped
Anderson, punching and kicking him.
Terrified bystanders scattered as the group streamed into the casino then out into the street.
Whoa.
Just after the Mike Tyson fight,
Shakur, with record company executive, Suge Knight, headed for a club.
While stopping at this intersection a car with four people pulled up and fired on Shakur and Knight.
Shakur was shot several times in the chest.
The driver, his record producer, was grazed in the head.
He's returned to intensive care after another surgery, still in critical condition.
All week long fans of Tupac have gathered outside the hospital.
He's undergone two operations.
His right lung was removed.
He's intermittently conscious.
Jesse Jackson's been here.
Family is keeping vigil.
Despite reports that his wounds were not life-threatening, people at the hospital continue to tell us he is in very serious condition.
At 4:03 this afternoon,
Tupac Shakur was pronounced dead.
Who shot me?
Shit, I don't know.
Sorry.
My death, it's a tragedy like Shakespeare, I guess.
But I have no bad feelings.
I have love for everybody.
Please welcome the mothers of Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur,
Afeni Shakur and Voletta Wallace.
Coming to grips with my past, it was hard.
I don't feel what I did was evil.
I feel like the way I was living and my mentality was a part of my progression to be a man.
But we grow. We all grow.
We're made to grow.
You either evolve, or you disappear.
I don't want to be forgotten.
I'll always be a troublemaker to some people.
But I still get love from my community.
I owe them everything. That's why
I owe everything to the 'hood.
I've got love there.
I've got love from thugs and the street dudes.
And that focuses me back on what I should be doing, lay out the real mat on the world and how it is.
The message is, young black males could do anything if you just give us a shot, stop trying to beat us down.
And to my homeboys, we need to be in control of ourselves.
I'm not saying I'll change the world, but I guarantee I'll spark the brain that will change the world.
So keep your head up.
Do what you've gotta do.
And then inside of you,
I'll be reborn.

{41428}{41525}The '80s was when Britain|stopped being Great Britain,...
{41554}{41630}..and stopped living that myth|that we were some great state,...

{48551}{48641}..and their arch rivals, Blur,|released new singles today,...
{48642}{48703}..each hoping to reach|the number-one spot next week.
{48704}{48754}The music industry|hasn't seen anything like it...
{48755}{48833}..since the Beatles fought it out|with the Rolling Stones.
{48861}{48988}The NME wanted to stoke the fires|of a war between Blur and Oasis...
{48997}{49094}..and stand back|and see who survived.
{49108}{49178}Um, Blur fell for it a bit too much.
{49179}{49259}I don't think Oasis|were too worried by it.
{49260}{49358}I think everybody at the NME|wanted Blur to win that war,...
{49359}{49449}..because, you know,|they were nice, middle-class boys,...
{49450}{49511}..and the NME was an Oxbridge paper.
{49512}{49555}Um, they were a bit annoyed...
{49556}{49655}..when the working-class oiks|from Manchester won out.
{49673}{49778}And there was that whole nonsense|between you and Oasis.
{49779}{49827}I mean, how did that all come about?
{50116}{50141}Er...
{50153}{50211}- We don't need to talk about that.|- OK.
{50212}{50250}Just because, er,...
{50295}{50350}..everyone knows about that,|you know.
{50385}{50425}For you, that must have been...
{50426}{50500}I'm not gonna tell you|the real reason why.
{50538}{50573}Because, er, you know,...
{50574}{50626}..there are other people involved...
{50669}{50785}..in the real reason why we fell out|so, er, kind of, publicly.
{50815}{50905}It's been described as the British|heavyweight pop music championship.
{50906}{50988}In one corner, four young|middle-class men from the South,...
{50989}{51033}..collectively known as Blur.
{51034}{51124}In the other corner, five young|working-class men from Manchester,...

{51191}{51244}* You gotta take your time

{51293}{51370}They're the two most popular bands|in Britain,...
{51371}{51423}..having sold millions of records.
{51424}{51466}They're engaged in a chart war...
{51467}{51542}..that's set|the music industry alight.
{51543}{51619}We are now in the golden era again|of British pop music.
{51620}{51673}These are two groups,|Oasis and Blur,...
{51674}{51742}..who actually formed|on the indie circuit,...
{51743}{51792}..who have grown|more and more popular...
{51793}{51852}..through playing lots of gigs|around the country,...
{51853}{51937}..and who have now crossed right over|to the public at large,...
{51938}{52004}..and are duking it out,|to see who is the biggest.
{52005}{52109}The way I see it is Steve Sutherland|saying to Damon Albarn,...
{52110}{52161}"Release a single|on the same day as them."
{52162}{52238}"We'll sell a shitload of papers and|you'll sell a shitload of records."
{52268}{52308}That's the way I see it.
{52309}{52359}We were quite offended at the time.
{52360}{52429}We were sat in Rockfield|and Alan McGee come and said...
{52430}{52532}.."Well, they've moved|their single back."
{52533}{52604}They had it ready to go|two weeks before,...
{52605}{52700}..and they decided to move it back|so it was on the same day as ours.
{52708}{52741}And, um,...
{52757}{52806}..Alan McGee and that were saying...
{52807}{52872}.."Well, just, like,|move yours back again."
{52873}{52921}And we were saying "No, fuck that."
{52940}{53010}So, it was a chance,|their last chance, really,...
{53011}{53082}..to drag themselves up|on the coat-tails of my band, really.
{53095}{53233}And, you know, the NME losing readers|by the thousands every week...
{53265}{53292}Um...
{53307}{53342}I suppose...
{53343}{53432}..it was summat they didn't think|would get as out of hand as it did.
{53433}{53523}But, then again, you get Damon Albarn|on the ten o'clock news, you know.
{53585}{53654}I ask you, what the fuck|is all that about, you know?
{53655}{53725}When the record-shop doors|opened this morning,...
{53726}{53771}..battle commenced.
{53772}{53839}The chances are both singles|could have been number one...
{53840}{53902}..had they been released|on separate weeks.
{53921}{53985}I'm a little nervous|about the whole thing.
{53986}{54062}Obviously, because both bands|have really upped the stakes,...
{54063}{54162}..and someone's gonna come out on top|and someone's gonna come second.
{54163}{54223}And by the very nature|of being in a band...
{54224}{54269}..you're always quite competitive...
{54270}{54333}..and, um,|you wanna come top, really.
{54334}{54399}I found myself on the News At Ten...
{54416}{54474}..in this kind of... battle.
{54486}{54524}Supposed battle.
{54591}{54634}All really odd.
{54657}{54745}You were saying to me|last time we met that, you know,...
{54746}{54821}..when you were walking around|in the street, you were getting...
{54866}{54907}- ..heckled.|- Yeah.

{55097}{55178}..you know, poor little Damon,|everyone started picking on him.
{55179}{55209}Just...
{55276}{55316}It wasn't really like that.
{55317}{55382}But it was a bit unnerving|on occasions.
{55383}{55413}I mean,...
{55452}{55495}..everywhere I went,...
{55534}{55575}..l'd be reminded of it.
{55576}{55623}Blur didn't come out of it too well.
{55624}{55671}They were the middle-class band,...
{55672}{55741}..and you guys|were the working-class heroes.
{55761}{55822}I wouldn't say Blur|didn't come out of it well,...
{55823}{55868}..but that's what they are.
{55879}{55919}And that's what we are.
{55937}{55983}You can't, you know, you can't...
{55984}{56048}Don't dress it up|and make it summat that it's not.
{56049}{56104}They've never been|on a building site.
{56105}{56138}Not to say that that's...
{56161}{56226}You know, not to say that|the dirt under your fingernails...
{56227}{56266}..is some sort of badge of honour.
{56267}{56307}It's not. It's just a fact.
{56323}{56378}They never had a paper round,|you know.
{56388}{56441}I had a milk round|and stuff like that.
{56442}{56473}Um,...
{56474}{56519}..I worked on building sites.
{56540}{56615}That fundamentally makes my soul|a lot more purer than theirs.
{56648}{56690}The strange thing about it...
{56691}{56738}..is that you were suddenly...
{56739}{56869}Blur were the, sort of, inauthentic,|middle-class pop band,...
{56870}{56963}..and Oasis were the real, gritty,|working-class heroes.

{57088}{57123}How did you feel about that?

{57694}{57807}Didn't really... realise|that my, kind of, flippancy...

{83889}{83986}A lot of the people were ambivalent|about being in Vanity Fair...

{84272}{84327}..it's as though|it hasn't really happened.

{94478}{94526}That's a... euphemism.
{94531}{94600}Er, and I got a letter|from his office,...
{94601}{94652}..saying "Don't talk about that."

{95385}{95469}..and I asked him how he managed|to stay up all night.
{95489}{95533}And he leant into me and said...

YES, OF COURSE. OF COURSE,
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
YOU'RE NOT WEARING ANY.
[ Laughs ]
HATS.
OKAY, I SPEAK ON BEHALF
OF EVERYONE AT THE LABEL...
WHEN I SAY THAT WE'D LOVE
FOR YOU TO SIGN WITH...
MEGARECORDS.
WHOA, WAIT, WHOA.
DON'T SIGN ANYTHING.
DON'T SIGN ANYTHING.
- WHO IS THIS ?
- ALEXANDER CABOT III.
I'M THE PUSSYCATS' MANAGER.
REALLY ? IN THAT CASE,
YOU'LL BE ENTITLED TO 15%
OF EVERYTHING THEY MAKE.
I'M HIS SISTER, ALEXANDRA.
LOVE THE ACCENT.
THANK YOU.
I USED TO SUMMER
ON THE CONTINENT.
FANCY A SNOG ?
FANCY A MINT ?
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU WANT TO SIGN US ?
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
HEARD US PLAY.
OH ! OH, OH.
I'M SORRY. FORGIVE ME.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A ROCK BAND
THAT WANTED TO SIGN WITH
A MAJOR LABEL. MY BAD.
- NO, NO, NO !
- NO !
NO. NO. IT'S--
I DIDN'T KNOW IT COULD
HAPPEN THIS FAST.
WELL, THAT'S THE MUSIC BIZ
FOR YOU.
IF YOU WAIT FOR IT
TO SLOW DOWN,
IT MIGHT PASS YOU BY.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BEASTIE BOYS.
- BUT THEY'RE HUGE STARS.
- I KNOW.
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE TO--
- BATHROOM ?
- YEAH, ME TOO.
I WENT BEFORE WE LEFT.
GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
TRY TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE,
EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
[ Gasping ]
OKAY, THIS IS CRAZY.
BEEP-BEEP. GOTTA GLOSS.
IT WON'T HIDE THE MUSTACHE.
HONK, HONK.
ALEXANDER !
I SHOULD BE HERE.
IT'S A LADIES' ROOM.
NOTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.
DOES ANYONE HAVE CHANGE
FOR A TAMPON ?
I'LL BE OUTSIDE.
[ Slams ]
DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK
THIS IS A LITTLE OFF ?
LIKE WHAT ?
LIKE THAT WYATT GUY,
FOR ONE.
LIKE HOW HE ORDERED
A TRIPLE CAPPUCCINO
AND SCOOPED OFF ALL THE FOAM.
WHY NOT JUST GET AN ESPRESSO ?
PLUS HOW HE KEPT
FOLDING HIS NAPKIN
LIKE HE'S AFRAID HE
DOESN'T HAVE
ANY REAL FRIENDS ?
JUST PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO USE HIM BECAUSE
HE'S A BIG MUSIC GUY.
YEAH. BUT I WAS TALKING
MORE ABOUT THE WHOLE
RECORD CONTRACT THING.
IT IS SUPER SUDDEN.
IT IS.
BUT YOU SAID IT.
YOU SAID WE HAVE TO
GO OUT THERE AND MAKE
THINGS HAPPEN, AND WE DID.
I KNOW. I JUST THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR A SECOND.
[ All Screaming ]
GEE, JOSIE,
HOW EXCITING FOR YOU.
YOU'LL GET TO GO AWAY AND
MAKE A RECORD, AND POOR ALAN M
WILL HAVE TO STAY BEHIND...
IN RIVERDALE
ALL ALONE WITH ME.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY LET YOU
BRING ME TO THE CITY WITH YOU.
SHH.
WHAT ?
I HAD TO TELL THEM THAT
YOU'RE MY GUITAR TECH, SO--
[ Whispers ]
GUITAR TECH. RIGHT.
* [ Guitar ]
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE HERE.
- I'M HERE BECAUSE
I WAS IN THE COMIC BOOK.
- WHAT ?
NOTHING.
[ Moans ]
WHOA !
[ Laughs ]
WHAT'S UP, BIG BUTT ?
SHUT UP.
HEY, YOU GUYS.
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE ALWAYS
SAY THAT THIS IS THE LIFE ?
I THINK THIS IS
WHEN THEY SAY IT.
PRIVATE PLANE.
RECORD DEAL.
COASTERS.
LOADS OF CASH.
* [ Guitar ]
SCRATCH THAT.
WE STILL POOR.
PARDON ? HANG ON.
* I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU ARE-- *
[ Phone Beeps ]
YES ?
AT LEAST I DON'T THINK
I NEED THIS ANYMORE.
RIVERDALE MUNI BUS PASS.
GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
WE HAVE THE ONLY BUS PASSES
WITH THREE PEOPLE
IN THE PICTURE.
[ Sighs ]
IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU BOTH
JUMPED IN ON MINE.
OKAY, NO, YOU BOTH
JUMPED IN ON MINE.
[ Laughs ]
WE SHOULD KEEP THESE.
REMIND US WHERE WE CAME FROM.
HEY, LISTEN, LET'S PROMISE
EACH OTHER SOMETHING...
RIGHT HERE
AND RIGHT NOW, OKAY ?
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS--
IF WE BECOME HUGE STARS...
OR IF WE END UP HITCHHIKING
BACK TO RIVERDALE,
WE WILL ALWAYS
BE FRIENDS FIRST
AND A BAND SECOND.
FRIENDS FIRST.
FRIENDS FIRST.
I SWEAR ON MY BUS PASS ?
[ Together ]
I SWEAR ON MY BUS PASS.
[ All Laughing ]
DON'T WORRY, LEX.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE
ANY TROUBLE WITH THESE GIRLS.
OH, NO.
* BUT I FEEL GOOD
YEAH, I FEEL FINE *
* I STOP COMPLAININ'
ALL THE TIME *
* YOU'LL GET YOURS
AND, BABY, I'LL GET MINE *
* YEAH
* SO DON'T BE FOOLED
BY WHAT YOU SEE *
* IN MOVIES, MAGAZINES
AND ON TV *
* 'CAUSE WHAT DO THEY KNOW
ABOUT YOU AND ME *
* WE DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY SAY *
* WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
WE'LL BE OKAY *
* NA, NA, NA, NA, NAH
NA, NA, NA, NA, NAH *
* YEAH, YEAH
* NA, NA, NA, NA, NAH
NA, NA, NA, NA, NAH *
* NA, NA, NA, NA, NAH

GEEZ. IT'S SO HUGE.
OH, THIS IS ONLY
THE BEGINNING.
ARE YOU SURE YOU SHOULD BE
PUTTING THAT UP ALREADY ?
I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T EVEN
RECORDED ANYTHING YET.
WHAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT ?
WHAT IF NOBODY LIKES IT ?
DON'T WORRY.
IF YOU SCREW UP, WE'LL JUST
PUT SOMEBODY ELSE UP THERE.
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing Continues ]
HEY, WYATT ?
HMM ?
THEY'VE GOT
OUR NAME WRONG.
HMM ?
WE'RE NOT JOSIE
AND THE PUSSYCATS.
WE'RE JUST
THE PUSSYCATS.
OH, NO, JOSIE'S THE SINGER.
THE PUBLIC NEEDS SOMEONE
OUT FRONT TO IDENTIFY WITH.
TRUST ME.
OUR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
THAT BANDS THAT HAVE THE WORD
"AND" IN THE TITLE...
SELL TWICE AS MANY RECORDS
AS THOSE THAT DON'T.
WHAT ABOUT THE BEATLES
OR THE ROLLING STONES
OR THE BACKSTREET BOYS?
YES, IF YOU WANT
TO SPLIT HAIRS, YES,
OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY.
YES, YES, BUT, COME ON.
WOULD YOU BE MORE
INTERESTED IN A BAND CALLED
SIMPLY THE PUSSYCATS,
OR ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO
BUY A CD OR READ A COMIC...
OR WATCH A CARTOON
OR GO AND SEE A MOVIE ABOUT
A TRIO OF LUSCIOUS LADIES...
CALLED JOSIE
AND THE PUSSYCATS ?
HMM ?
IT DOES HAVE
A NICE RING TO IT.
OH, YES.
HEY !
OH, SO SORRY, VALERIE.
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WEREN'T IN HERE.
HA, HA. COME ON.
[ Melody ]
MORE COASTERS.
[ Giggles ]
WHAT DID I TELL YOU, FIONA ?
IT COULDN'T BE BETTER.
JUST THINK CHRISTINA AGULIERA
TIMES THREE EXCEPT ONE OF THEM
IS INCREDIBLY TAN,
OR ELSE T.L.C.
WITH TWO WHITE CHICKS,
OR, UM, HOLE !
WYATT, I GET IT WITHOUT
THE STUPID ANALOGIES.
PUT THEM IN THE STUDIO
TOMORROW. WE'LL TALK LATER.
THE FEDS ARE HERE
WITH SOME FOREIGNERS.
I'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM
THE TOUR.
- YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.
- I'D BETTER NOT BE.
WE CAN'T AFFORD
ANOTHER DUJOUR DISASTER.
- WELCOME.
- [ Foreign Language ]
I'M SURE YOU'RE WONDERING WHY
AGENT KELLY AND THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT...
WOULD BE SO INTERESTED
IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE
A RECORD COMPANY.
WELL, I'M ABOUT
TO SHOW YOU WHY.
- [ Beeping ]
- [ Whirring ]
THIS... IS WHAT OUR OPERATION
REALLY DOES.
[ Woman ]
BLUE IS THE NEW ORANGE.
[ Fiona ]
THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS--
THE FADS, THE FASHIONS,
THE PRODUCT PLACEMENT.
FROM THIS COMMAND CENTER,
WE CONTROL THE
MOST INFLUENTIAL DEMOGRAPHIC
OF THE POPULATION.
WE DECIDE EVERYTHING--
FROM WHAT CLOTHES ARE IN STYLE
TO WHAT SLANG IS IN VOGUE.
FEATHER TANK TOPS,
MATCHING PANTS. KIND OF
A BUFFY MEETS CHICKEN RUN.
FEATHERS ARE
THE NEW RHINESTONES.
THE NEW WORD FOR COOL
WILL BE "JERKIN'," AS IN,
"DUDE, THAT'S JERKIN'."
THAT'S DIRTY.
[ Fiona ]
THIS IS THE EPICENTER
OF ALL TRENDS.
WE TURN YOUR WORLD INTO
ONE GIANT TV COMMERCIAL.
BUT HOW, YOU MAY ASK,
CAN OUR OPERATION
BE SO EFFECTIVE ?
SURE THESE KIDS HAVE BRAINS
LIKE PLAY-DOH, JUST WAITING
TO BE MOLDED INTO SHAPE,
BUT SOMETHING ELSE
MUST BE GOING ON, RIGHT ?
THE CHINESE GUY KNOWS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
TO ANSWER SOME
OF YOUR QUESTIONS,
WE'VE PRODUCED
A SHORT EDUCATIONAL FILM.
LIGHTS !
[ Beeps ]
HELLO. I'M EUGENE LEVY,
AND, YES, I'M AN ACTOR.
NO, I SAID CAPPUCCINO.
I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT.
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT ME
OR MY CAREER.
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT
SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES
IN ROCK-AND-ROLL MUSIC...
OR AS IT'S SIMPLY KNOWN
IN SOME CULTURES-- ROCK MUSIC.
FOR YEARS THE GOVERNMENT
HAS BEEN WISELY
COERCING TEENAGERS...
TO BUY PRODUCTS
THEY NORMALLY WOULDN'T WANT
JUST TO GET THEIR MONEY.
FACT: KIDS DON'T
HAVE BILLS TO PAY.
FACT: THEY DON'T PAY TAXES,
BUT THEY DO BABY-SIT
AND HOLD MINIMUM-WAGE JOBS...
THAT EARN THEM WADS OF CASH
AS THICK AS, WELL,
MY BODY OF WORK.
BUT THESE KIDS TODAY
AREN'T DUMB.
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO BUY JUST ANYTHING.
THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN PLANTING SMALL SUBLIMINAL
ADVERTISING SUGGESTIONS...
IN TODAY'S ROCK MUSIC.
THE RESULTS ?
WE CAN NOW GET THESE KIDS
TO BUY JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.
WE CAN HAVE THEM CHASING
A NEW TREND EVERY WEEK,
AND THAT IS GOOD
FOR THE ECONOMY.
AND WHAT'S GOOD
FOR THE ECONOMY
IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY.
SO GOD BLESS
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
THE MOST ASS-KICKING COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD.
[ Beeps ]
[ German Accent ]
HOW CAN YOU CONTROL
THE ROCK BANDS ?
WHAT IF THEY FIND OUT
ABOUT THE HIDDEN MESSAGES
IN THEIR MUSIC ?
EVER WONDER WHY SO MANY ROCK
STARS DIE IN PLANE CRASHES ?
OVERDOSE ON DRUGS !
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A LONG TIME.
IF THEY START
TO GET TOO CURIOUS,
OUR OPTIONS ARE ENDLESS.
BANKRUPTCY, SHOCKING SCANDALS,
RELIGIOUS CONVERSIONS.
WE'VE CREATED
A HIGHLY-RATED TV SHOW...
JUST TO EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE PEOPLE.
[ Beeps ]
[ Foreign Language ]
[ Applause Continues ]
WOW.
THE WALLS ARE MUSHY.
[ Giggles ]
WE BROUGHT
SOME EQUIPMENT IN.
I ASSUME IT'S TO YOUR LIKING.
THEY'RE BRAND NEW.
I LIKE THIS.
IT'S GOT SHINY KNOBS.
NO. NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
TH WE DO NOT TOUCH.
IT'S ONLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT
IN THE STUDIO.
THE MEGASOUND 8000.
ALTHOUGH THE NAME SOUNDS
OMINOUS, IT'S ACTUALLY
JUST A HIGH-TECH PROCESSOR.
HOW DOES IT WORK ?
WHY DO YOU NEED
TO KNOW THAT ?
WHAT IS IT, A BIG SECRET
OR SOMETHING ?
A BIG SECRET.
WYATT'S GOT A SECRET.
IT'S NOT A SECRET. STOP IT.
I'LL TELL YOU. I'LL SHOW YOU.
- [ Whirring ]
- PLAY A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR ME, WOULD YOU ?
* IT TOOK SIX WHOLE HOURS
* AND FIVE LONG DAYS
* FOR ALL YOUR LIES
TO COME UNDONE *
* AND THOSE THREE
SMALL WORDS *
* WERE WAY TOO LATE
* 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE
THAT I'M THE ONE *
PERFECT ! NOW, THIS WILL
JUST TAKE A MOMENT.
[ Voices Overlapping ]
AND NOW I'LL PLAY IT BACK
WITH MEGASOUND.
* AND THOSE THREE SMALL WORDS
WERE WAY TOO LATE *
IS THAT US ?
* YOU CAN'T SEE
THAT I'M THE ONE *
IT SOUNDS SO--
- I WANT A BIG MAC.
- WHAT ?
MEL, YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN.
I KNOW, BUT
SUDDENLY I WANT ONE. MAYBE
ON THE WAY BACK TO THE HOTEL ?
OKAY, AS LONG AS WE CAN
STOP BY FOOT LOCKER TOO.
I'M DYING FOR A PAIR
OF OLD-SCHOOL TRETORNS.
JERKIN' TRETORNS
ARE THE NEW ADIDAS.
[ Clicks ]
LADIES, NOW SHOULD I DROP YOU
BACK AT RIVERDALE MALL, OR ARE
YOU READY TO MAKE A RECORD ?
COME ON !
[ Feedback Whine ]
[ Drumsticks Tapping ]
ONE, TWO. ONE, TWO, THREE.
* WELL, HE LOOKS AT ME WITH
THOSE INNOCENT EYES AND SAYS *
* IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE WEARIN'
SOME KIND OF DISGUISE *
* BECAUSE YOUR HAIR STICKS UP
YOUR SHOES ARE UNTIED *
* I HOPE THAT YOU GOT
THAT SHIRT AT HALF PRICE *
* AND EVERY WORD I SAY
FALLS FLAT ON THE FLOOR *
* I TRY TO TELL A JOKE
HE'S HEARD IT BEFORE *
* AND I DON'T THINK
THAT I CAN TAKE IT NO MORE *
* HE'S DRIVING ME
RIGHT OUT MY FRONT DOOR *
* WHY DO YOU DO
WHAT YOU DO TO ME, BABY *
* YOU'RE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE
DRIVING ME CRAZY *
* YOU KNOW IF I COULD
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU *
* PLEASE DON'T IGNORE ME
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I ADORE YOU *
* CAN'T YOU JUST PRETEND
TO BE NICE *
* CAN YOU AT LEAST
PRETEND TO BE NICE *
* IF YOU COULD JUST
PRETEND TO BE NICE *
* THEN EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE
WOULD BE ALL RIGHT *
* OOOH, WEE, OOH, WEE
OOOH, WEE, OOH, WEE, OOH *
* OOOH, WEE, OOH, WEE
OOOH, WEE, OOH, WEE, OOH *
THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER !
YEAH, AND I WANT
SOME GATORADE.
GATORADE IS THE NEW SNAPPLE !
* AND I TRIED SO HARD
JUST TO FIGURE HIM OUT *
* BUT HE WON'T TELL ME WHAT
HE'S BEEN THINKING ABOUT *
* AND THEN HE FALLS ASLEEP
ON THE LIVING ROOM COUCH *
* WITH HIS SUNGLASSES ON
AND HIS TONGUE HANGING OUT *
* THEN HE DISAPPEARS
FOR A WEEK AT A TIME *
* AND THEN HE SHOWS UP
JUST LIKE EVERYTHING'S FINE *
* I DON'T GET WHAT GOES ON
IN HIS MIND *
* BUT I'M TIRED OF HEARING
THE SAME STUPID LINES *
* WHY DO YOU DO
WHAT YOU DO TO ME, BABY *
* YOU'RE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE
DRIVING ME CRAZY *
* YOU KNOW IF I COULD
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU *
* PLEASE DON'T IGNORE ME
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I ADORE YOU *
* CAN'T YOU JUST PRETEND
TO BE NICE *
* COULD YOU AT LEAST
PRETEND TO BE NICE *
* IF YOU'D JUST
PRETEND TO BE NICE *
* EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE
WOULD BE ALL RIGHT *
* OH, OH, OH, OH
OH, OH, OH, OH *
* OH, OH, OH, OH
OH, OH, OH, OH *
* OH, OH, OH, OH
OH, OH, OH, OH *
* EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE
WOULD BE ALL RIGHT *
* ALL RIGHT
* OH, OH, OH, OH
OH, OH, OH, OH *
* OH, OH, OH, OH
* OH, OH, OH, OH
OH, OH, OH, OH *
* EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE WOULD
BE ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT *
* OH, OH, OH, OH
OH, OH, OH, OH *
[ Screaming ]
- THIS MUST BE A MISPRINT.
- [ Laughing ]
- YEA !
- WAIT !
DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK
IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE THAT
ALL THIS HAPPENED IN A WEEK ?
[ Dialing ]
NO !
[ Screaming ]
[ Screaming Continues ]
[ Screaming ]
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Screaming ]
- WHO ARE YOU ?
- [ Screaming ]
- WE KNOW THEM !
- [ Panting ]
EWW ! WE DO !
OH, MY GOD ! WE LOVE YOU.
WE'RE LIKE YOUR BIGGEST FANS !
[ Screaming Continues ]
- NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU HATE US.
- ARE YOU CRAZY ?
JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS
ARE OUR NEW FAVORITE BAND
OF ALL TIME !
- [ Screaming ]
- JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS
ARE THE NEW DUJOUR !
WANNA SEE OUR
PUSSYCAT TATTOO ?
LOOK IT !
[ Gasping ]
THAT WAS WAY TOO WEIRD.
WEIRD ? WHAT'S THE POINT
OF BEING FAMOUS...
IF THE PEOPLE
YOU HATED IN HIGH SCHOOL
DON'T WANT TO KISS YOUR ASS ?
[ Chuckles ]
YOU'RE LUCKY.
MOST PEOPLE HAVE TO WAIT
TILL THEIR TEN-YEAR REUNION
FOR THAT SORT OF REVENGE.
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO GET USED TO PEOPLE
THROWING THEMSELVES AT YOU.
AND, TALKING OF THROWING,
FIONA,
THE HEAD OF MEGARECORDS,
IS THROWING A HUGE PARTY
TONIGHT IN YOUR HONOR,
A CELEBRATION
OF ALL THINGS JOSIE.
- UM, WYATT ?
- HMM ?
- DON'T I GET ONE ?
- OH, THAT IS STRANGE.
WHY DON'T YOU COME ALONG TOO ?
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR ONE MORE.
HOW ABOUT US ?
NO.
WOW. A PARTY.
THAT'S, UM--
THAT'S, UH--
THAT'S KIND OF COOL.
BUT IS IT AS
"KIND OF COOL" AS PLAYING
YOUR OWN STADIUM CONCERT ?
OOPS ! I PROMISED FIONA
SHE COULD TELL YOU. DAMN.
WE'RE PLAYING
A STADIUM CONCERT ?
THIS WEEKEND.
SHOULDN'T WE MAYBE PLAY
SOME SMALL CLUBS FIRST ?
MAYBE DO A FEW GIGS IN EUROPE.
BUILD A FOLLOWING.
YOU HAVE A FOLLOWING.
HONESTLY, "J."
I WOULDN'T SEND YOU OUT THERE
IF I DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD DELIVER.
IT WOULD ONLY
MAKE ME LOOK BAD.
BUT THIS IS THE WHOLE DEAL:
SIMULTANEOUS
PAY-PER-VIEW WEB CAST,
LIVE STREAMING VIDEO,
MILLIONS OF LITTLE PEOPLE
PAYING GOOD MONEY
JUST TO WATCH YOU.
WELL, I'M SURE
YOUR BAND MATES
ARE TRES EXCITED.
RIGHT, MELLY-MEL ?
OUR FIRST CONCERT EVER.
THANKS, WYATT.
DON'T THANK ME.
THANK FIONA.
IT WAS HER IDEA.
IT'S BEEN PART OF HER PLAN
FOR YOU FROM THE START.
OPERATION BIG CONCERT,
WHERE WE FINALLY TAKE THINGS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
WHEN JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS
PLAY THEIR STADIUM CONCERT,
ALL THE KIDS IN THE AUDIENCE,
AS WELL AS THE ONES
WATCHING AT HOME,
WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE THESE.
IT'S THE DEBUT
OF 3-D-X SURROUND SOUND,
A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT
MAKES THE MUSIC FEEL LIKE
IT'S HAPPENING ALL AROUND YOU,
LIKE 3-D.
GENTLEMEN, A DEMONSTRATION.
THIS IS WHAT THOSE KIDS
THINK THEY'RE HEARING
ON THOSE HEADSETS.
* OOOH, WEE, OOOH, WEE, OOH
AND THIS IS WHAT
THEY'RE REALLY HEARING.
[ Man ] CONFORM.
FREE WILL IS OVERRATED.
JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON.
THAT VOICE.
I KNOW THAT VOICE.
IT'S, UM--
- IT'S MR. MOVIEFONE.
- YES !
HE DOES ALL
OUR SUBLIMINAL TRACKS.
[ Mr. Moviefone ]
THERE IS NO SUCH PLACE
AS AREA 51.
EXCELLENT WORK, FIONA.
THESE KIDS WILL NEVER
KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM.
- AND NEITHER WILL YOU.
- I'M SORRY. WHAT WAS THAT ?
- HUH ? WHAT ?
- YOU JUST SAID SOMETHING.
NO, I DIDN'T.
YES, YOU DID.
NO, I DIDN'T.
YES, YOU DID.
I SAID, "THESE KIDS WILL NEVER
KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM,"
AND THEN YOU SAID,
"AND NEITHER WILL YOU."
- I DID ?
- WE ALL HEARD YOU.
OH-- WELL--
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS,
"AND NEITHER WILL YOU GUYS."
MEANING THE TEENAGERS.
I WAS JUST EMPHASIZING
MY POINT.
OH. OH, OKAY.
GREAT. THANKS.
THAT WAS CLOSE.
EXCUSE ME ?
I WAS GOING TO SAY,
"THAT WAS... CLOSE...
"TO BEING
A... REALLY NICE MOMENT...
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US."
DON'T YOU THINK ?
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS.
I HAVE TO BE GETTING BACK
TO THE PENTAGON, SO--
[ Man ]
TONI TENNILLE AND I--
WE WROTE ALL
THE SONGS TOGETHER.
* LOVE, LOVE WILL
KEEP US TOGETHER *
CAPTAIN JUST PLAYED THE PIANO.
IT WAS MY IDEA TO HAVE HIM
WEAR THAT HAT.
I SAID, "HOW YOU
GONNA BE A CAPTAIN
IF YOU DON'T WEAR A HAT ?"
[ Chuckles ]
WE DID MAKE SOME
BEAUTIFUL MUSIC TOGETHER
THOUGH.
A BIG SONG-- THE ONE I WAS
MOSTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WAS...
"LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER."
WELL, GUESS WHAT. IT DIDN'T.
GUESS AFTER A WHILE, YOU KNOW,
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE
THE SPOTLIGHT NO MORE.
SOMETIMES THAT STUFF HAPPENS.
I CAN STILL REMEMBER,
THOUGH, CAPTAIN ALWAYS SAID,
"FRIENDS FIRST.
THE BAND SECOND."
I WISH I'D HAVE
GOT THAT IN WRITIN'.
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT
CLAP YOUR HANDS *
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT
CLAP YOUR HANDS *
[ Laughs ]
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY

OH, NO.
THAT'S BETTER.
[ Giggles ]
[ Knocking ]
[ Alan M ]
* IT'S THE GUY
WITH THE PIZZA *
* THE KIND THAT'S
GOOD TO EATS-A
IF YOU OPEN THE DOOR *
OH, MY GOD.
I AM SO SORRY.
I TOTALLY,
TOTALLY FORGOT.
WE HAVE TO GO TO
THIS RECORD PARTY THING
WITH THE HEAD OF THE LABEL.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
- NOTHING. IT JUST, UH--
YOU LOOK SO, UH--
YOU CANNOT MAKE FUN OF ME.
THEY SENT THIS DRESS OVER.
I DID NOT PICK IT OUT.
BUT I CUT UP THE FRONT,
AND I MADE WRISTBANDS.
IT LOOKS STUPID,
DOESN'T IT ?
NO, NO, NO. NO. I--
I'VE JUST--
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU-- WOW !
FINISH YOUR SENTENCES.
IS THAT A GOOD WOW
OR A BAD WOW ?
OH, NO, NO. IT'S, UH--
IT'S A GOOD WOW.
IT'S A-- IT'S A--
IT'S A VERY GOOD WOW.
THANKS.
ACTUALLY, WOULD YOU MIND ?
THERE'S A--

THERE'S A CHAIN THING
THAT I CAN'T
FIGURE OUT REALLY.
OH, RIGHT.
RIGHT, UM-- OKAY.
UM--
THAT'S, UM--
THAT'S DOWN HERE.
A LITTLE COMPLICATED.
[ Clears Throat ]
JOSIE, ARE YOU READY ?
THE DOOR WAS OPEN. I HOPE
I'M NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.
- HEY, ALEC N,
HOW'S IT HANGING ?
- ACTUALLY, IT'S ALAN M.
YES, WHAT'S WITH THE INITIAL ?
IT DIDN'T WORK FOR SHEILA E.,
AND IT DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU.
JOSIE, WE DON'T WANT TO BE

THAT'S TOTALLY

OH, SWEETIE, THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE SITTING ON THE O.

IT'S NOT THE O.
IT'S HER.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, VAL ?
STUFF'S DEFINITELY
BEEN... DIFFERENT
SINCE WE LEFT RIVERDALE.
AND, IF YOU ASK ME,
SOME THINGS FEEL LIKE
THEY'VE CHANGED COMPLETELY.
- WYATT.
- HMM ?
I DON'T LIKE THOSE TWO
PUSSYCATS.
THEY'RE ASKING QUESTIONS,
AND THAT'S DANGEROUS.
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE
ANY MORE RISKS.
I'LL GET RID OF THEM,
HAVE A NEW BAND
BY THE MORNING.
OOH !
THINK, WYATT.
WE'VE ALREADY SOLD
HALF A MILLION OF THE JOSIE
EARS FOR A BIG CONCERT.
RIGHT. YES. SO WE HAVE.
SO WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING ?
KEEP JOSIE, AND PUT
THOSE TWO NOSY LITTLE
PUSSYCATS TO SLEEP.
MMMM.
I DON'T THINK JOSIE WILL
PLAY WITHOUT HER FRIENDS.
OH ? I THINK
WE MIGHT PERSUADE HER.
MMM ?

JOSIE, DID I TELL YOU
I GOT A GIG TONIGHT ?
YOU DID ?
THAT'S GREAT !
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S JUST THIS BAR,
BUT THE MANAGER--
I PLAYED HIM MY DEMO,
AND HE SAID
I COULD HAVE, LIKE, ALMOST
A FULL HALF-HOUR TONIGHT.
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU WANT TO COME, OR--
YEAH.
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE
BUSY AND EVERYTHING.
OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT JOSIE ?
WHERE ? JOSIE !
[ Screaming ]
* SHAPE SHIFTER,
GUEST LISTER *
* BIG FAKER
SHE'LL TURN AROUND
YOU'LL DISS HER *
* GATE-CRASHER, REHASHER
* IF YOU THINK THAT'S COOL,
WHATEVER DUDE *
[ Panting ]
THANKS.
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
HOW AM I GONNA
PULL THIS OFF ?
WH-WHAT ?
I'M A GIRL FROM RIVERDALE,
YOU KNOW ? I'M--
I'M NOT A ROCK STAR.
JOSE, YOU'VE BEEN
DREAMING ABOUT THIS
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
I KNOW, IT'S JUST--
WHAT ?
I'M SCARED.
DON'T BE. YOU GOTTA
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
WHAT IF I CAN'T ?
THEN--
THEN I GUESS
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
BELIEVE IN YOU FOR YOU.
[ Knocking ]
OH, WOW.
[ Laughing ]
OH, WOW !
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD OPEN WITH
FOR THE CONCERT--
SPIN AROUND,
OR MAYB COME ON ?
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD TRY
ROLL ON, ROLLY WHEEL,
BUT, HONESTLY, I THINK
THE LYRICS STILL NEED WORK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
IT'S YOUR CALL.
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE BOSS.
NO, I'M NOT.
VAL, WHAT'S WITH YOU ?
HELLO, GIRLS !
AND HOW ARE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED
WOMEN
IN ROCK-AND-ROLL ?
EH ?
DON'T YOU MEAN "WOMAN" ?
VALERIE, MY DARLING,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN
TO TAKE A COMPLIMENT.
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO TONIGHT
WHEN YOU GO ON TRL...
AND CARSON DALY TELLS YOU
HOW MUCH HE LOVES YOUR MUSIC ?
DON'T YOU MEAN,
WHAT'S JOSIE GONNA DO ?
NO, BECAUSE SHE WON'T
BE THERE. WE JUST BOOKED
YOU AND MELODY.
IT'S TIME FOR THE WORLD TO GET
TO KNOW THE OTHER PUSSYCATS.
WE'RE GONNA BE ON TRL ?
MM-HMM.
DO I GET TO TOUCH CARSON ?
[ Squeals ]
ANYWHERE YOU LIKE.
THE TAPING'S IN TWO HOURS,
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS.
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THIS ?
NO ! I THINK YOU GUYS WILL
HAVE A GREAT TIME.
I LOVE THAT SHOW.
AND-- AND YOU DON'T MIND
IF MEL AND I GO WITHOUT YOU ?
WHY ? I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT STUFF.
[ Sighs ]
JOSE--
OH, I'M SO SORRY !
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.
OKAY.
COME ON, GIRLS. THERE ARE
STYLISTS AND DESIGNERS
WAITING IN YOUR ROOM.
AND YOU HAVE HOMEWORK
TONIGHT. THIS IS THE REMIX
OF YOUR NEXT SINGLE.
I'D BE VERY CURIOUS
TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.
COULD IT WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW ?
IT'S JUST THAT ALAN M IS
PLAYING HIS FIRST GIG TONIGHT,
AND I WANNA GET THERE EARLY.
OH. OH, I'M SO SORRY, JOSIE.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
ALAN M CALLED
MY OFFICE EARLIER.
THEY CANCELED HIS SHOW.
- THEY DID ?
- YES.
WHY DIDN'T HE CALL ME HERE ?
UM, I'M SURE HE DID.
IN FACT,
I'M SURE IF YOU GO DOWN
TO THE FRONT DESK, THERE'LL BE
A MESSAGE WAITING FOR YOU.
EXCUSE ME.
[ Whispering ]
YES, THERE'S A MESSAGE
WAITING FOR YOU... NOW.
I GUESS I SHOULD CALL HIM.
UM, HE ALSO SAID TO SAY
THAT HE WON'T BE AVAILABLE
FOR SEVERAL HOURS,
AND HE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN HE CAN.
ALL THAT WAS ON THE MESSAGE ?
UH, YES. EXCUSE ME.
[ Whispering ]
YES, THAT'S ALL
IN THE MESSAGE.
ANYTHING ELSE ?
WHO DO YOU KEEP CALLING ?
I'M RUNNING A LABEL HERE,
JOSEPHINE.
I HAVE OTHER ARTISTS
WHO NEED ME, OTHER ARTISTS
WHO NEED MY TIME,
OTHER ARTISTS WHO AREN'T
SO DIFFICULT ABOUT PUTTING IN
A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA WORK.
YOUR LEVEL OF NON-COMMITMENT
IS MAKING ME DOUBT
YOUR COMMITMENT COMMITMENT.
SO, YOU WANNA BE
A ROCK SUPERSTAR, EH--
LIVE LARGE, BIG HOUSE,
FIVE CARS ?
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
DO THE TIME.
OTHERWISE,
[ Chuckles ]
SOMEBODY ELSE WILL,
AND YOU'LL BE LEFT
TO EXPLAIN IT ALL
TO MEL AND VAL.
I AM COMMITTED.
I AM.
YES, I HOPE SO,
MY DARLING.
I HOPE SO.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
- VAL, WE'RE ON TRL !

YOU NEED TO CALL ME.
I GOT PLANS.
ALL RIGHT.
IS EVERYBODY READY
TO START THE SHOW ?
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S CARSON !
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S MELODY !
YO, MAN, YOU GOTTA
STOP TRYIN' TO BE ME
WITH THE NAILS THING.
WHAT YOU SAYIN', MAN ?
A BROTHER CAN'T
BE CARSON DALY ?
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYIN'.
IT'S JUST THAT
I ACTUALLY AM CARSON DALY,
SO IT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT NOW.
WHO'S GONNA BREAK
MY "GAZOONS," MAN ?
I'M CARSON DALY.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, MAN.
WHO ELSE DO YOU DO ?
I DO MIKE TYSON.
I WOULD TAKE A BITE OUTTA YOU.
OKAY, WHAT IS GOING ON ?
ARE YOU--
IS THIS TRL OR NOT ?
THIS IS NOT
TOTAL REQUEST LIVE.
IT'S MORE LIKE
TOTAL REQUEST DEAD.
YEAH, YOU SEE, LADIES, WE'VE
ONLY GOT ONE REQUEST TODAY.
AND THAT'S TO KILL YOU.
[ Laughing ]
CARSON SAID HE'S
GONNA KILL US.
LIKE THAT'S A REQUEST.

HOW DID THEY LET
THE TWO OF YOU IN HERE ?
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD
THE FRONT DESK "NO VISITORS."

WHY WOULDN'T I BE ?
I HAVE THE NUMBER-ONE SINGLE
IN THE COUNTRY.
YOU TWO, ON THE OTHER HAND--
[ Mutters ]
SHOULD MAYBE BE
A LITTLE WORRIED.
JOSIE, CARSON DALY TRIED
TO KILL US,
AND I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH OUR MUSIC.
WHY DO YOU CALL IT...

WHAT I'M HEARING ?
I'M HEARING SOMEONE
GLOMMING ON TO MY TALENT...

"OUR" MUSIC, MEL ?
I BASICALLY WRITE ALL OF IT.
JOSIE, NO, YOU DON'T.
WRITE IT TOGETHER.
OH, OKAY.
SO IF WE'RE ALL DOING
EQUAL AMOUNTS OF WORK,
WHY ISN'T THE BAND CALLED

I KNEW IT.
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING THIS

HI, I'M SERENA ALTSCHUL
WITH MTV BREAKING NEWS.
JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS'
DEBUT CONCERT WAS
UNEXPECTEDLY CANCELED...
WHEN AN AUTOMOBILE EXPLODED
IN THE STADIUM PARKING LOT.
THE PASSENGERS WERE
IDENTIFIED AS VALERIE BROWN
AND MELODY VALENTINE,
TWO OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS
OF THE POPULAR ROCK BAND.
INVESTIGATORS ON THE SCENE
WERE QUOTED AS SAYING THE TWO
DIED A SLOW, FIERY DEATH...
INSIDE THE FOUR-WHEELED
HELL PIT.
WE'RE TOLD THAT JOSIE WILL
BE RELEASING A STATEMENT...
TO THE PRESS WITHIN THE HOUR
TO COMMENT ON THIS TRAGEDY.
YES, JOSIE,
WHAT ARE YOUR COMMENTS ?
WE'RE ALL GAGGING TO KNOW.
ROAST YOUR FRIENDS,
OR PLAY THE SHOW ?
PLAY YOUR SHOW ?
ROAST THE FRIENDS ?
WHAT'S IT TO BE ?
ALL RIGHT !
I'LL PLAY.
SEE, VAL ?
SHE STILL LIKES US !
MEL, OF COURSE I DO.
YOU GUYS ARE MY BEST FRIENDS
ON THE PLANET.
LOOK, I KNOW THAT FRIENDS
DON'T TREAT EACH OTHER
THE WAY I TREATED YOU GUYS.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME.
IF I COULD JUST
GO BACK IN TIME,
I WOULD TAKE IT ALL BACK.
THAT WOULD BE COOL.
IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME,
I'D WANNA MEET SNOOPY.
MEL, I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU !
I LOVE THAT YOU THINK
THAT EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE...
AND THAT THIS WORLD IS
SUCH A GREAT PLACE,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT ?
IT IS.
AND I'M SO SORRY IF,
FOR ONE SECOND, I MADE YOU
THINK THAT IT WASN'T.
AND VAL-- VAL,
YOU BOUGHT ME
MY FIRST GUITAR.
AND, YOU KNOW, WE MAY HAVE
STARTED THIS BAND TOGETHER,
BUT THE ONLY REASON WE'VE
COME THIS FAR
IS BECAUSE OF YOU.
NOW, LOOK.
I DON'T CARE IF WE'RE
JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS,
OR VALERIE AND THE PUSSYCATS
OR WHOEVER AND THE PUSSYCATS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER
AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER.
YOU'RE MY SISTER, VAL.

IRONIC SORT OF WAY.
SO, WHAT'S THE MORAL
OF THE STORY HERE--
FREAKS SHOULD DATE
OTHER FREAKS ?
NO, I THINK THE MORAL OF
THE STORY HERE IS YOU SHOULD
BE HAPPY WITH WHO YOU ARE.
THIS WHOLE TIME WE'VE BEEN
SPENDING MONEY ON EXPENSIVE
CLOTHES TO IMPRESS PEOPLE.
NEVER MADE ME HAPPY.
NO ! HAPP-- OH, MY GOSH.
HAPPINESS IS ON THE INSIDE.
I'M NOT THIS.
I'M NOT WHAT I WEAR.

FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
- GENTLEMEN, ARREST
THAT WOMAN AND THAT MAN...

ON CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY
AGAINST THE YOUTH OF AMERICA.

- OH, I'M SERIOUS, MA'AM.
THIS IS
A VERY SERIOUS OFFENSE.
SORRY, BUT THEY'RE
ON TO US. SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO TAKE THE FALL.
YOU BASTARD !
BESIDES, AFTER THE CONCERT,
WE WERE GONNA SHUT DOWN
YOUR OPERATION ANYWAY.
WE FOUND
THAT SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES

[ Man ]
JERKIN' !
INSTRUCTOR: And one.
Heel forward.
Good.
That's right. Shoulders down.
And brush.
Do you know how many they take?
Usually no more than 12.
Twelve? Out of this class?
Out of the whole planet.
In the middle. Number 15.
WOMAN: Not enough turnout. Bad feet.
MAN: But look at her.
She's just a cosmic girl
- WOMAN: Excuse me!
- You're excused.
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
WOMAN: Here we go.
Am I a bad mother if I hope she doesn't get it?
Don't ask me.
I was against this from the start.
- Mom!
- Jody!
Mom! Mom, I got in.
(LAUGHING) Oh!
I made it.
Wonderful, honey.
Can you believe it?
It's because you're a good dancer.
I'm going to New York.
Hey.
Hey, what happened?
- They didn't take you? What?
- No.
No? Those bastards.
Not, "No, they didn't." No, they did.
Do you know who went there?
Everyone who matters in American ballet.
The school feeds right into the Company.
Yeah, but there's no guarantee you'll make the Company, right?
WOMAN: And you could still dance in college, honey.
Indiana has a great dance program.
Hey, this is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
I don't think it would kill you two to at least pretend to be happy.
It's a scholarship.
They give them to everybody.
That's the only way they can get people to go.
- When are you going to start?
- I don't know.
I'm thinking maybe I'm not gonna go.
What are you talking about?
What are you going to do instead?
There's that new Hooters opening.
I could work there.
As what, though?
You do not have the rack.
- I'll get implants!
- Yeah, right.
I'm scanning all my radars
We'll she said she's from a quasar
Forty thousand million light years away
It's a distant solar system
I tried to phone, but they don't list 'em
So I asked her for her number all the same
She said, "Step in my transporter
"So I can teleport ya
"All around my heavenly body"
This could be a close encounter
I should take care not to flounder
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
- You need a hand?
- No.
She's from a cosmic world
No.
No?
I mean, no, thank you.
Okay.
She's cosmic
Idiot.
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
Transmitting on my frequency
Yeah, cosmic, oh
Can't you be my cosmic woman?
Hi. I'm Eva Rodriguez. How you doing?
Jody Sawyer. Fine. I'm new here.
Oh, me, too. I took the top.
This is good.
You know who I saw on my way in?
Who?
Cooper Nielson.
Oh, yeah? Did he seem as cocky in person as he is on TV?
You know, It just kind of freaks me out that we're gonna be seeing people like him around all the time now.
MAUREEN: You get used to it.
I'm Maureen. I guess I'm living with you.
Don't sound so excited.
I'm Jody.
Nice to meet you.
This is Eva.
What are you doing?
I'm knitting a sweater.
Uh, if you want to smoke, you have to go outside.
Fine. I'll go outside. Are you coming?
- Bye, Maureen.
- Bye.
Hey. Erik Jones.
How you doing, Erik?
My stage name is Erik O. Jones, after Oprah.
She's my idol.
Eva Rodriguez, after no one.
Oh! An individual. I like it.
I'm Jody Sawyer.
Well, we were just heading out to smoke.
You wanna join us?
Oh, come downstairs. It's Marlboro Country.
EVA: So, Serge.
Sergei, Sergei.
Who's the babe?
It's my girlfriend, Galina.
Oh, God, don't get him started.
She was here all four years with me and now she dances with San Francisco Ballet.
You've been here for four years already?
Yeah.
So you know the story with this
Maureen chick we're living with, huh?
(CHUCKLING) You're living with Maureen?
Well, good luck.
Big-time bitch?
Biggest time. And of course, she has the best technique in the school.
She was here since she was nine.
Is this the right room?
If it's not, I'm staying anyways.
No argument here, baby.
SERGEI: You're Charlie?
- Then you're in the right place.
- Excellent.
That's Sergei, that's Jody, that's Eva, I'm Erik, and you're cute.
- ERIK: Long trip?
- From Seattle.
My girlfriend dumped me for leaving her there.
Mmm.
Morning.
Would the new students raise your hands, please?
Now, which of you was the best dancer in the last class he or she took?
Come on.
(CHUCKLES) It's a heady thing, isn't it?
Being the best.
Teachers dote on you.
Other students ask for your help.
And an aura builds and then you get accepted into ABA.
And whether or not you admit it, you start thinking it's just a matter of time before you're doing Giselle before packed houses in Lincoln Center.
For most of you, that will never happen.
I don't say this to be cruel,
I say it to help you clarify your expectations for the year ahead.
If you work harder every day than you've ever worked in your life, this school will turn you into the best dancer you can possibly be.
That may or may not be the kind of dancer
I have room for in the Company.
At best, I can take three boys and three girls.
I'll be watching you carefully over the coming months.
But I won't be making any decisions until I see how you dance in the workshop performance, at the end of the year.
They won't be easy decisions to make because you're all very talented.
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.
Thank you for bringing your gifts to our community.
I wish you all a very good year.
I hope he doesn't think that was inspirational.
Oh, one more thing, one more thing.
Next week is the Company gala.
We always invite our advanced students to attend the performance and to help out at the party afterwards.
I expect you all to be there.
And you are?
Eva Rodriguez.
So glad you could fit us into your busy schedule, Eva.
Oh, no sweat.
JULIETTE: All right, ladies, we'll start with our plies.
First position. Demi and stretch.
Demi and stretch.
Full grand plie. And return.
Port de bras forward.
Full port de bras back.
The same in second, fourth and fifth positions.
And then we'll rise and take a balance in fifth.
Yes? Let's begin. Steven?
Relax those fingers, Janie.
Very nice, Maureen.
Pull those ribs in. Really support.
Mmm-hmm.
Nice long lines, ladies.
Put the energy coming up over your heads.
What's your name, dear?
Jody Sawyer.
You need to concentrate on your turnout.
From the hip.
Mmm-hmm.
We have a dress code here.
Black leotard, pink tights.
Stylish.
No gum.
Get your hair off your face.
Developpe, ecarte.
Change to efface.
Plie. Tendu. Lift the leg, first arabesque.
Maureen, will you show us, please?
Now, look at Maureen's arms.
They're perfectly supported from underneath, not above.
Not wilting at her sides like dead chicken wings.
Oh, she's so good.
Yeah, just ask her.
JULIETTE: And one.
Really extend that front leg. Yes.
Ready, second group.
Wow, where did she come from?
JULIETTE: Softer landing, ladies, please.
Anna, eyes off the mirror, please. Thank you.
Watch where you're going, sweetheart.
We don't carry collision insurance.
Who let that disaster in here?
Mmm.
I swear I'm better than that.
I'm just really nervous.
Hey, don't sweat it.
First day never counts. Okay?
Everything counts here.
MALE INSTRUCTOR: One and hip.
- Arms in front of you.
- Fresh meat.
In the middle.
And one. Good. Not bad.
ANNA: Cute. Who is he?
Charlie, from Seattle.
JODY: We only met him yesterday.
Is he gay or straight?
Straight.
BOTH: Straight.
KATHLEEN: Hi, Robert.
Hey, you guys. Look.
Hi, girls.
Maureen, Anna.
Hi, Kathleen.
That was Kathleen Donahue, wasn't it?
Yup. The Kathleen Donahue.
Oh, my God. She's beautiful.
Well, I think she looks kind of like a gerbil.
What?
She does.
She just married Mr. Reeves, right?
Wait a minute. She married the director?
Mmm-hmm.
Now I get it.
Yeah, this summer. It was a huge scandal.
She'd been with
Cooper Nielson for a few years.
And then one day, out of nowhere, she tells him she's leaving him for Jonathan Reeves.
No one even knew they were having an affair.
And Cooper throws this huge fit in rehearsal in front of the whole company.
Calls her a slut and stuff.
It was unbelievable.
Then he drags his broken heart off to London to dance for the season.
Where rumor has it, he drinks like a fish and screws every girl in tights.
He's back, you know.
I know.
I heard he hasn't spoken to anyone.
He talked to me.
What?
You know, he, he offered to help me with my bags.
Bob, it's a benefit.
If I give you an extra seat,
I'm taking money away from the Company.
Besides, when was the last time your paper ran anything on us?
Oh, what the hell.
Three seats under your name at will call, but only because I'm nice.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.
Well?
Nothing to worry about.
So, what's the competition?
What about your roommates?
Jody's hopeless. She'll never make it.
Is she the one from Boston?
No, that's Eva.
Eva's actually good. Amazing extension.
But her attitude stinks.
Jonathan hates her already, thank God.
So you still think it'll be you,
Anna and Emily?
Yeah. Although, have you seen Emily lately?
Look at her.
Hello, Emily.
Hi, Mrs. Cummings.
Oh, dear.
Her pas de deux partner's going to need a crane to lift her.
(CHUCKLING) Stop it.
No way do people actually buy this shit.
It's signed by Kathleen Donahue.
It's a smelly old shoe.
- Cooper.
- How you been?
Can I tear you away for a minute?
There's a woman here whose husband just died, leaving her $200 million.
And she adores you.
Excuse me. That was beautiful.
Let me introduce you.
Now, why does that feel wrong?
Oh, it, it's just a hello.
It would be great for the Company.
- Jonathan.
- Steve.
Well, if it's good for the Company.
I mean, you know me. Team player.
Joan Miller. Cooper Nielson.
- Hello.
- Well, this is an honor.
Cooper, I am, without a doubt, your biggest fan.
And my loveliest.
Well.
Now, what on earth were you doing way over there in dreary London, when everyone loves you so much here?
Don't you listen to the gossip?
I was being huffy. Scorned lover. All that.
Oh, God. Oh, I'm so sorry.
Not at all. It's fine.
Joan, this is one of our advanced students.
- Jody Sawyer.
- JONATHAN: Sorry.
We have so many promising students this year,
I find it hard to keep them straight.
You see?
That's how taxing Jonathan's job is.
There's so much going on, he can't remember the name of a beautiful girl.
Don't worry, Jody Sawyer.
I don't run a company. I won't forget.
Excuse me.
I will trade you one bliss potato with caviar for one of your tiaras.
See, my old one's broken and I'm desperate.
What will you use it for?
You know, state funerals, abdications, the usual.
I'll see if we have your size.
- ERIK: Hey, you guys wanna see something?
- What?
Come on, just go with this.
KATHLEEN: I appreciate that.
It's always a pleasure to dance with him.
Oh, Cooper, I've already told Kathleen, but what a treat, that Romeo and Juliet.
You're the finest Romeo since Jonathan himself.
It's a great piece.
And you two together.
I don't do anything.
It's all her.
EMILY: Come on.
Save it for the workshop, Charlie.
Look at him.
Get over here.
- Let's show them.
- Sure.
COOPER: What's wrong with you?
KATHLEEN: You know exactly what you did.
You've got no right to paw me in front of all those people.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wasn't pawing you.
I mean, I can't even touch you?
We're not friends anymore?
Okay, Cooper, listen.
I think it's great you're back.
You're a wonderful dancer.
But I am just as happily married as I was before you left.
Yeah, well, if things are so good at home, how come we danced better tonight than we ever have?
For God's sake, Cooper, that was acting.
Pretending.
That's our job.
(SIGHS) I got to get back.
- (EXHALES)
- Oh, my God.
I know.
JODY: In the grander scheme of things, it was a pretty cool night.
EVA: Yeah, except for that slave labor part, it didn't suck.
Excuse me. Coming through.
No luck, huh?
- What?
- The tiara.
She went off to find one in my size.
Oh! No. No luck.
It's all right.
I'm sure you tried your hardest.
Anyone want a fruit tart for the road?
Yeah, I'll take one.
It's practically all fat, Emily.
Hello, Emily. I'm Jim Gordon.
Hi.
So, you guys, what, work here?
Oh, no. We're students at the American Ballet Academy.
Ballerinas. Very cool.
Oh, my God.
You got to try one of these, Maureen.
Well, she has a name. Maureen.
We have to go.
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
- I'm gonna go home, call my mom.
- Go and talk to him.
Tell her how wrong
I've been about New York.
You see, Maureen No-last-name, all this time I've been telling her,
"It's an interesting city, but completely
"devoid of any true natural beauty."
And now that I've met you,
I know that's not true.
- Cummings.
- What?
Her last name. It's Cummings.
Go. And one and stretch and stretch.
Good lift. And good, Charlie. Yes.
Stretch that front foot. Much better.
Yes, good. Come on, go.
Take it forward. That's it. Good. Dip and go.
All right, I'm here. Sorry.
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
And one. The arm's lifted here.
The head is here. Yes, yes, yes.
Lift through here, and lift it, but not tucked, not tucked, dear.
Ready, Maureen?
Beautiful round brise.
Feet always stretched.
Look at how lovely her arms are.
Head up, Stephanie.
Everyone, ribs in.
Don't let your elbows droop.
Turnout, Jody.
From the hips, dear.
Now really just skim the surface this time, ladies.
Jody, flutter.
Yes, Eva.
Exactly.
You feel the difference?
Felt like the same old shit to me.
Late out of that turn, Jody.
You're trying too hard.
Thank you, ladies.
Emily.
You might wanna visit the nutritionist this week.
She can give you some good pointers.
Go back. Go back.
Come on, let's go. Go back.
I need to see the girls gesture to their partners.
"Hello, I'm waiting."
And the boys rush over and kneel.
"I am your slave."
And...
I am your slave.
I'd believe it more if you weren't staring at your own fucking reflection when you said it.
If someone wants to hear profanity,
Miss Rodriguez, they can take a subway.
They don't need to spend $60 on a ballet ticket.
Though she has a point.
That foot, my dear. Let's go back.
Let's go back. Come on, let's go back.
Try it again.
You've got to work with me here, Jody.
Okay?
JULIETTE: Lift, Anna.
Excellent, Eva.
Where's the turnout, Jody?
After everything we've talked about,
I'm not seeing it.
You understand what I'm saying?
Use what you have and turn out.
Jesus! She heard you!
Excuse me?
She heard you. We all heard you!
You don't have to speak to her like that!
Anyone can see she's working her ass off!
That's enough, Miss Rodriguez.
This is my classroom.
And I will run it as I see fit.
If you have a problem with that, you are free to leave.
Oh, Maureen, if you want to get calls, please do so in the dorm.
Don't give out this number.
I didn't.
Well, a Jim Gordon got it somehow and has been calling for you non-stop.
Hi. What are you doing here?
Nothing.
I'm just waiting.
I know. I wasn't myself today.
I didn't get enough sleep last night, so I was really tired.
It's not just today, Jody.
I see you three times a week.
You're not improving.
I can work harder.
Oh, no matter how hard you work, there...
There are certain realities about you as a dancer that we have to face.
We can wait till the end of the year, when it's time for you to get a job.
Or we can talk about it now, while you still have options.
You're not very turned out.
So that needs work.
And you don't have great feet.
And while you're very pretty, you don't have the ideal body type.
Margot Fonteyn didn't have great feet.
When Margot Fonteyn was onstage, you couldn't tear your eyes away from her.
It can't be taught.
In four months, we're gonna put on a workshop in front of 3,000 people.
It's an audition for every major ballet company in the country.
From what I've seen,
I can't cast you in that workshop.
And if you're not onstage that day, you won't get a job, not at ABC, not anywhere.
So, what? Are you kicking me out?
No.
I just want you to really think if this is the right place for you.
EVA: What a prick.
He was perfectly nice about it.
Yeah, but being nice when you say something pricky is even prickier.
MAUREEN: What if he's right?
What?
Let's be honest.
You're not like most of the girls here.
Your technique is nowhere near where it should be.
Hey, news flash, there's more to being a great dancer than perfect technique.
Try dancing Swan Lake without it.
Oh, God, I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Look, you're really smart.
If you send in your application now, you could get into a good college.
I don't want to go to college.
I want to dance.
(SIGHING) Yeah, well, so do a lot of people.
Jesus! What, you went to a special bitch academy or something?
I'm just trying to be honest.
In my opinion, that's what friends do.
Tell each other the truth.
I guess that explains why you have so many friends.
If anyone asks, I'm in the library.
Truth?
In terms of technique, you are behind.
But the people here know what they're looking for.
And on the day of your audition, they saw it in you.
Yeah, and now all they see is the wrong body type.
Oh, Eva, why can't I have your feet?
Okay. Enough of this. Get up.
Why?
Because all we ever do in this place is take class.
And it's about time we had a little fun.
JIM: Hey!
Hi, Maureen.
Hi, Emily. How you guys doing?
Fine.
Good.
So, has Maureen been really busy?
I mean, she isn't seeing someone else, like
Cooper Nielson or someone, is she?
What do you know about Cooper Nielson?
Hey, I've been doing my ballet research.
We're not encouraged to date company members.
I fully support that policy.
Look.
All I came here to say is
I go to Columbia, pre-Med.
I have a clean record, impeccable hygiene and here's my number.
Go talk to him.
Come on, go.
Hey.
The thing is, I've got priorities.
You only get to be a dancer for 10 years.
Maybe 15 if you don't get injured.
So, for the next decade at least...
Hey, all I'm asking for is a date.
Oh, my God!
That's why I like this guy.
SERGEI: Okay. Anna's for sure, right?
She's always been Jonathan's favorite.
- Maureen, too.
- ERIK: Oh, yeah, you're right.
EVA: Boring.
SERGEI: Boring or no, Jonathan likes her.
ERIK: Yeah, that only leaves one girl spot open.
EVA: Emily will get it.
SERGEI: I don't think so.
She's getting big. Jonathan hates big.
Oh, no. It's just a little extra padding for the winter.
You didn't get all done up like that to talk about ballet.
Come on.
What does she have that I don't?
She can salsa.
EVA: You call that salsa? Come on, Erik.
We'll show them salsa.
Get your asses up here.
What is that?
That's not salsa.
- That is not salsa.
- Use the technique, Charlie.
ERIK: Here we go, girl.
Hi.
Where are you from?
- Jersey.
- New Jersey?
Me. I'm from Russia.
Yeah? What are you doing here?
I'm a ballet dancer.
So, how do I do this, exactly?
You've never bowled before?
No.
Just roll it on down there.
BOY: In Nepal, there's this jungle and this elephant's walking down the way and he steps on a thorn.
He's like, "Oh, my God, that hurts."
He sees a little mouse, he goes,
"Oh, mouse, could you help me out?
"Get the thorn out of my foot, it really hurts."
And the mouse goes,
"No, no, you stepped on my uncle last week.
"I remember you.
Forget about it buddy. No way."
And he goes, "Please, come on,
I'll do anything. It really hurts."
So the mouse goes,
"Anything?" He says, "Yeah."
He goes, "Okay." So he takes out the thorn.
The elephant feels so much better, and he says,
"Thank you so much. How can I repay you?"
The mouse goes,
"I don't know, I want to have my way with you.
- "I find you sexy."
- GIRLS: Oh, my God!
He did. He said,
"Let me have my way with you."
And the elephant goes, "No."
He goes, "You promised." And he just climbs up and starts doing the elephant.
The elephant's like,
"Well, I guess I'll let him finish.
"It's the right thing to do here," you know?
Then there's these three monkeys up in a tree that're seeing this mouse hump the elephant.
And they're like, "Oh, my goodness."
They pick up these coconuts and they just start chucking them.
And they just start chucking them.
Finally they hit the elephant right in the head.
The elephant goes,
"Ow! Oh, my God, that hurts."
The mouse doesn't even stop. He says,
"Yeah, take it all, bitch. Take it all."
This is my kind of a mouse.
You know what I mean?
Why can't all dancing be this fun?
All dancing is this fun.
Maybe for you.
Russia, huh?
So, what are you doing in New York, then?
Mafia.
Mmm.
- You've got, uh...
- Mmm.
I've got it.
Would it be presumptuous to ask to come up?
Yeah.
Plus, you're not allowed. Dorm rules.
So, this is good night.
I think so. Yeah.
But not goodbye.
No. No, not goodbye.
I have to go.
Good night.
WOMAN: Thank you, sir!
Guys, let's go to another club.
I want to dance.
All right, ma'am. Time to go.
Taxi, taxi!
You're sweaty.
I don't mind 'cause you're sweet.
And so is your sweat.
Sweet sweat.
You are, too.
What? Sweet or sweaty?
Both.
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
Come on, Jody.
Can't do another one of these today.
Careful with that one.
You break it, you bought it.
Okay, stop. Stop.
You five, come here.
Oh, God.
When you show up to class unprepared to work, it's an insult.
Not just to me.
To your fellow students and to the school.
Get out of my class.
How many studios are there altogether?
SERGEI: Eight.
Oh! That's a lot of mirrors.
It was worth it just to see Sergei getting it on with that old lady.
Oh, my God. That's right.
I had forgotten all about that.
We weren't getting it on, okay?
Yeah, right.
I thought she was going to detach her jaw and swallow you whole.
You know, I'm just trying to imagine what the lovely Galina
- would have to say about that.
- No! No!
No, you can't tell her. No!
- I was drunk and I was lonely and...
- Oh, yes, I can.
It didn't... It didn't mean anything, guys.
I don't know, Sergei. I'm with Jody.
I believe a girl's have a right to know what kind of hound she's saving herself for.
- How about this, huh?
- Oh!
I'm sorry!
EVA: No, no, no, no! Come on!
Stop it!
EVA: Stop, stop, stop! Okay, okay, okay.
So, there's this jungle and all these wild animals, lions and tigers and well, there's this elephant, and he's walking along and he steps on this thorn.
Wouldn't it makes sense for Charlie to partner you in the pas de deux class?
He's very good.
It seems like a waste for him to be partnering Jody.
It's fine. So anyway, he steps on this thorn and it really hurts.
Honey, I'm trying to talk to you about something important.
It's not that important. Just let me finish.
Not that important?
Having a bad pas de deux partner is like having a bad tennis partner.
I wouldn't know. I've never played tennis.
What's wrong with you?
Did you just start your period?
No. God.
Well, you're acting strangely.
I'm just trying to tell a joke.
And I'm trying to have an important conversation about your future.
Charlie brings out the best in his partner.
That's the kind of thing that'll make a difference when it comes to cast the student workshop.
I don't think I'll have a hard time getting a good part, Mom.
You can't afford to be cavalier, Maureen.
Your entire career hangs on what you're gonna get to dance in the workshop.
I know all this.
Please don't turn into a sullen teenager on me now.
You've come this far.
I thought we were home free.
Anyway...
I have a meeting with Jonathan today.
I can easily mention the idea of you partnering Charlie.
- I'm sure he would agree that...
- So, what happens is, the elephant goes, "Ow, ow!" and the mouse goes,
"Take it all, bitch!"
You're threatened by me.
I'm threatened by no one.
Yeah, you are.
You're afraid of opening the Times and reading that at last, someone is making interesting dances for ABC.
I'm not an idiot.
If you prove to be a great choreographer,
I'll be begging you to make dances.
But for now, I can only choreograph for the student workshop?
That's my decision.
You know, you're still hanging onto all that personal shit.
I don't need to hang onto anything.
I got the girl.
Hi. Do you have a 5:30 class?
What kind would you like?
Anything but ballet.
What are you doing here!
MAN: All right, George.
Grab an ass.
What's up?
All right, everybody!
Let's do it!
INSTRUCTOR: Spread out!
Let's start with the usual warm-up.
And, five, six, seven, eight!
Head down. And back.
Right, center, left, center.
Right shoulder.
Left shoulder.
- Hey, you made it! All right.
- Hey.
Alternate.
And second!
That's it. Roll it.
Roll those hips.
Come on. Mix it.
Okay.
Get ready to get down and contract.
Down and contract. And down.
Whoa!
And get it up. Lots of action over here!
Push it out. Come on, hold it, hold it.
All right. Stretch out. Up!
Kick it up! And up!
Okay. Other side. Up!
And up. You've got it.
All right.
All right. You're going to get up.
And I want you to bounce.
And stretch.
All right. I want to take it from the top.
I want it full out.
Look, just forget about the steps.
Just dance the shit out of it.
And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
People
Keep on learnin'
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
Keep on warrin'
Hit it, boys.
Keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Powers
Keep on lyin'
While your people
Whoo! Yeah!
Keep on dyin'
Good.
World
Keep on turnin'
Yeah!
Push it, yeah.
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth
I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' till
I reach the highest ground
Yeah. All right. That was great!
All right, girls. Come on.
Lovers
Keep on lovin'
While believers
Keep on believin'
Sleepers
Just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh, no
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth
I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' till
I reach the higher ground
Yeah!
MAN: And Stevie knows that, uh, nobody's gonna bring me down.
Till I reach the highest ground
'Cause me and Stevie, see, we're gonna be sailin' on the funky sound.
Till I reach the highest ground
Bustin' out and I'll break you out,
'cause I'm sailin' on.
Till I reach the highest ground
INSTRUCTOR: Go!
Just sailing on, sailing on to higher ground.
Till I reach the highest ground
Yes! Go for it.
Go for it!
WOMAN: All right!
Get you, Mr. Choreographer.
It's only for a workshop.
Well, just make sure you take chances, okay?
'Cause you really suck when you play it safe.
Thanks. That's sweet. Really.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Great class.
- Mmm.
Thanks. See you.
Jody Sawyer.
See? Told you I'd remember your name.
What are you doing way down here?
Is that a problem?
I mean, know I'm not supposed to be taking class at other places.
Like I care. You looked great up there.
Thanks.
No. It's just that class.
I mean, how come
I can't dance like that in my ABA classes?
Because ABA has a great big stick up its ass?
- Have you had dinner yet?
- Yeah.
Dessert?
Hop on. We'll go for a ride.
Okay.
I try
But I can't seem to get myself to think of anything
But you
I wanna be with you
If only for one night
To be the one who's in your arms, to hold you tight
I could've sworn
I had some cookies or something.
It's okay. I shouldn't eat them anyway.
I'm in enough trouble with my body as it is.
Where are you getting that from? Jonathan?
Yeah. That, plus, my feet suck.
I'm poorly trained.
And I can never be a dancer, ever.
Jonathan's a moron.
I couldn't take my eyes off you tonight.
Best I could do.
Cheers.
I meant it, you know.
I noticed your dancing before I recognized your face.
I have to admit,
I recognized your face first.
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Ooh, yeah
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
Drives me crazy when I try to
So come my way, take my hand
Can you make my wish?
Baby, you are in command
I wanna be with you
In spite of what they say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
You want anything? Water?
- Some more wine?
- No.
I can keep looking for those cookies.
I'm fine.
Cooper, it's Jonathan.
We'll be at girl's class at the school at 10:00 a.m. Monday morning to finalize workshop casting.
Be there.
JULIETTE: Chasse, releve. Chasse, tendu.
Plie.
Anna. Anna, I asked for a double pirouette there.
Not a triple. Again, please.
Faster spotting, ladies. Steven.
It's a chasse, not a tombe, Pasquale.
Anna, Anna!
I want a clean double.
I'm sorry. I thought there was enough music for three.
I mean, wouldn't it be better if we all did a triple?
A double. End of discussion.
You want to use her?
JULIETTE: That's much better, Nicole. Yes.
Really give it size, ladies.
Don't flap the wrists, Emily.
Yes.
Beautiful, Aesha.
All right, ladies. Maureen.
Good jumps, good elevation.
But you'll really fly more if it's from the heart.
Who cares what she thinks, anyway?
Juliette Simone, please.
Her name's Julie Simon, she grew up in Perth Amboy and her father managed a Wal-Mart.
Just don't let it get to you.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Just in case you guys were wondering, casting's going up at 1:00.
ANNA: Daddy? I got the lead in Italian Symphony.
That's Gelsey Kirkland's old part.
No. Maureen got the lead in Jonathan's ballet, but that has way more people.
Well deserved, sweetie. Aren't you pleased?
Jody.
Miss Thing, you're doing a piece with the two of us.
- What piece?
- A totally new ballet.
- A world premiere.
- You're kidding.
- Made on us.
- Who's choreographing?
We can always find some more rehearsal time later.
Hi.
This is for you.
Thanks.
I just want you to know how much it means to me to be in your ballet.
And I won't let you down.
Well, you were the best for the part.
Simple as that.
It's some dessert. So, um...
You'll have some on hand next time.
Bye.
What?
I didn't say anything.
Take these.
Nonsense. You heard her.
They're for next time.
- Hey.
- Congratulations.
Cooper's ballet.
Yeah. Kind of amazing.
It should be good.
I guess.
Jody says he has all these theories about making ballet for the people.
I do ballet 'cause it has nothing to do with the people.
Give me tiaras and boys in tights any day.
I hear you're in the corps in Jonathan's ballet.
Yup.
Just goes to show, don't piss off the boss.
No one will see me and I'll never get a job.
I'm sorry.
Big deal. I don't care.
Yeah. I know.
It sucks, doesn't it?
What?
Not caring.
Kind of, yeah.
Five, six, seven, eight.
All eyes are on you.
Your eyes are only on Maureen.
Present your chest.
Walk gallantly.
Breathe.
(CHUCKLING) The man's a fossil.
He should be in a museum.
Do you have a question, Miss Rodriguez?
Yeah. What is it about?
The music. The music.
It's an expression of harmony that isn't of this world.
Sergei, chest up. Chest up.
That's it. That's it. Soft hand.
Soft hand, Maureen. That's it.
I want this as real as it can be.
It's a triangle.
She's a ballerina, and she's in love with you, Erik.
And Charlie's the other guy.
He's the director of a ballet company.
Okay. Let's just fool around with the steps.
See what we got. Michael.
Okay. Step, touch, step, touch.
Pas de bourree. Double pirouette.
All right, you keep doing that.
You watch this.
Do the double pirouette, down to the knee.
Then give me your left arm.
I'll slide you over here.
And then, lift you up like this.
That'll work. Erik.
JULIETTE: Eva!
You don't like him very much, do you?
I don't blame you.
He's impossible.
Headstrong, egotistical, unforgiving.
Arrogant as all hell.
The thing is, you'll be hard-pressed to find any choreographer or company director who isn't like that.
The unwise dancers blame them.
"He didn't like me." "She was unfair."
"I should have had that part."
The smart ones know where to look when things get rough.
It isn't there.
It's here.
No matter what happened in class, in performance, last week, five minutes ago, if you come back here, you'll be home.
Hey, so how was your rehearsal?
Oh, it was all right. You know.
And the king of ballet?
Oh, Jonathan's fine.
Oh, but Juliette Simone, what a nosy bitch!
She thinks she knows everything about everyone.
- Hey.
- Hi.
And where are you guys going?
Well, it's Erik's birthday, so we're going to take him out.
Oh.
Well, have fun.
Do you wanna come?
Jim was going to swing by.
Can he come, too?
Sure. Bring your mom as well. Okay?
You're not alone
'Cause we'll be, you'll see
We'll be... We'll be friends forever
We'll be, you'll see
I got a little something here for you.
What? What is this? Oh, God.
Hey! You know you shouldn't be...
Hey, you shouldn't be eating donuts.
They're bad for you.
Okay. Get in the picture.
I don't want to miss this shot.
Come on. Erik, in front.
That's it. Happy faces.
We'll be, you'll see
We'll be friends forever
You never stop, do you?
They still hate my body.
You're way too hard on yourself.
You looked great in rehearsal.
That ballet is so not ABC.
You don't like it?
Who cares what I like?
That workshop is about what Jonathan likes.
Is getting into the company really all that matters to you?
It's so different for you, Charlie.
They love you.
I mean, they practically printed your name in the programs already.
You need to take some time away from all this.
That is the last thing that I need.
We could go out sometime.
Like a date?
Yeah. Like a date.
That's really sweet, Charlie, but I'm kind of seeing someone.
Sorry. I didn't realize.
No. It's just that it's new and I don't want to make a big thing of it, you know?
Sure, yeah. No big thing.
Hey, you haven't seen my girlfriend, have you?
Tall, thin, legs for days?
Yeah. I pushed her overboard.
You okay?
Fine. Just motion sickness, you know.
You want some water or anything?
No, it passed.
- Sure? All right.
- Yeah.
No, Erik!
This is about sex.
I want you to feel it. Let me show you.
Now, you see where I am?
I'm right up against her.
My hips are right up against her.
- You got it?
- ERIK: Yeah. I got it.
Okay.
Charlie, what do you think about this for the end of the pas de trois?
Can I see that?
Sure.
I changed it a little.
It could work.
That could work, too.
How about like that?
Why don't you just try this?
I could work on it.
You do that.
Moving on.
Girls! Girls! Arms over the top before going into the arabesque.
Boys, you've got to watch each other in the lift.
Emily, you're out of line.
Look at the diagonal. Look at it.
Maureen, wake up. Where's your focus?
You'll be onstage in less than a month.
How do you expect
3,000 people to watch you raise your arm, if you don't do it beautifully?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
You looked amazing out there.
- Thanks.
- Your pirouettes were amazing.
Amazing and tiring, huh?
Friend of Cooper's?
Kind of.
You are in big trouble.
She's in my ballet.
Please.
She's a heartbeat away from tattooing your name on her ass.
- Want to go to my place?
- Sure.
All right.
- See you.
- See you tomorrow.
Where are we going?
Night. Lexington?
Good night.
- Excuse me.
- Oh! Goodness.
No, my fault entirely.
It's a good thing I didn't step on one of your feet, you could sue me.
Don't worry. They're not as valuable as they used to be.
So, how's Jonathan's ballet coming along?
It's going to be beautiful. Really lovely.
Oh! Good.
Is Maureen feeling better?
Better than what?
She said she felt like she was coming down with something. A bug.
Oh! Right. Right, that bug.
JONATHAN: Joan!
What brings you here to our humble part of the city?
Well, Cooper invited me to watch his rehearsal.
He did?
(CHUCKLING) How nice you two have kept in touch.
Just a bit. You know.
He's being nice to a tired old lady.
Nonsense. Oh...
Have fun.
COOPER: Okay, guys, you've got...
Let's take it from the bridge.
Is that clear?
Okay, Jody, you're right here.
Yesterday I was stage left.
Well, today you're stage right.
What am I going to be tomorrow?
Excuse me?
Well, I mean, you keep changing your mind.
It's kind of hard to keep track.
It's not that complicated.
I want what I say I want, when I say I want it.
You got a problem with that?
Yeah. Maybe I do.
What about what I want?
I don't give a shit what you want!
You're a dancer. Period.
You do what I want.
And if you're not gonna do that, then what the hell are you doing here?
I'm afraid that's how ballets get made.
It's all very dramatic.
(SOBBING) Don't look at me.
I'm too embarrassed.
You were saying how you felt.
What's embarrassing about that?
How a dancer feels doesn't matter to a choreographer.
No, but how a woman feels should matter to the guy she's seeing.
Do you think I'm an idiot for getting involved with him?
No.
I think he's an idiot for not treating you well.
Come on. Let's go back.
I can't.
Sure you can.
No. I'm all splotchy.
I feel...
So use it.
What?
Whatever you feel, just dance it.
And you're not splotchy.
I'm sorry.
I'm ready.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Good morning, Mrs. Cummings.
Good morning, Emily.
Maureen, sweetie, can I steal you away for a moment?
- I've got class.
- This won't take long.
Ow!
Juliette says you've been off lately.
You talked to Juliette about me?
She sought me out. She talked to me.
- She did?
- Yes, she did.
She asked me if you were doing better, which means she noticed you were doing poorly.
A bug. For God's sakes, it's not even a good lie.
I know what's going on, Maureen.
You should ask yourself, what's this boy doing to your dancing?
And the ladies have to make fifth before the show starts.
Stop! Stop!
Maureen, you make it look like work.
I need to see the movement, not the effort behind it.
Thank you. We're out of time.
We'll pick this up tomorrow.
Emily.
Can I see you in my office, please?
GIRLS: Emily!
- Emily!
- What happened?
I'm going home.
What did he say to you?
He told me I couldn't be in the workshop.
He told me that
I don't take enough pride in my body.
He just thinks I'm too fat.
God, I could kill that man.
You're not fat! You're beautiful.
So, you're... So, you're leaving for good?
Yeah. My mom thinks it's best.
Dancing used to make her happy and it doesn't anymore, so we have had enough.
I want you girls to promise me you won't let anyone make you feel bad about yourself, okay?
You're perfect the way God made you.
We have to go, sweetie.
Look, uh...
I know I'm not a doctor yet or anything, but I do know that what you're doing is really bad for you.
I wasn't feeling well.
Maureen, please.
What do you know?
I know that no goal is worth making yourself sick.
Yeah? Well, maybe my goal is a little more demanding than yours.
Medicine is plenty demanding, thank you, but I am not about to start hurting myself for it!
I'm not hurting.
I'm making decisions, sacrifices for what I want.
Oh, like, like you know what you want!
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what?
Call me crazy, but I find it hard to believe that a girl who is throwing up everything she eats, is all that in tune with her wants and needs.
You know what? I don't need this.
Not from you.
God.
All right, look, I'm sorry.
Please, don't go running out of here in the middle of the night.
Just back off!
Maureen, listen to me.
Wait. Look. I don't...
I don't want to drive you away.
I just want to help you.
I don't need any help. I'm fine.
I am the best goddamn dancer in the American Ballet Academy.
Who the hell are you? Nobody.
If you let go of your center, it will just happen, naturally.
Now release the neck.
Lovely.
Do you want to show me again?
You wouldn't mind?
Not in the least.
All right, boys and girls, let's go to the opening diagonals.
I know some of you are hearing the orchestra for the first time, but it doesn't mean you can stop counting.
You're all off the music.
You must remember your counts.
Keep going.
Are you sure it's in here?
That's what Sergei said.
JONATHAN: I want to see two straight diagonals.
Oh, my God! (LAUGHS)
"Dancing a new work choreographed by Cooper Nielson are Jody Sawyer,
"Charles Sims and Erik O. Jones."
Erik, check this out.
People, please.
This is a rehearsal, not a social hour!
I've never been in the paper before.
I know. Me neither.
It's kind of cool, huh?
Are you guys warmed up?
Of course.
Five, six, seven, eight. One...
We don't invite press to workshop.
You know that.
I didn't invite anyone.
Nancy says every paper has called, and all they ask about is your ballet.
Hey, if there's interest, that's great, but other than that...
Bullshit!
One more time.
What are you up to?
Phoning press, kissing Joan Miller's ass.
She hasn't shown any interest in the Company since she started spending time with you.
Well, what do you know?
I guess I got the girl this time, huh?
Shit.
Erik, you all right?
Ow!
Where is it?
Man, I'm so sorry.
Well, you'd better start rehearsing the understudy.
It's Andre. He's not good enough.
I can't use him.
You have to use him. Erik can't dance.
I'm gonna do it.
You can't do that, Cooper.
The workshop's for students.
If you want your students to dance my ballet tomorrow, they're gonna dance with me.
Otherwise, I'm pulling it.
Hey.
You okay?
Erik got injured today.
And you know the first thing
I thought when I saw him go down?
What?
"I wish that was me."
So, that made me think, you know,
'cause that's not a normal reaction.
How much of what you liked about me was because I was a ballet dancer and how much because I was me?
I can't do it. I can't dance with him.
Why? Because he dumped you?
No. Because he's the best dancer in the world.
Jody. Jody, you'll be fine.
Just get some sleep.
You know with Erik,
I stood a chance of showing Jonathan how wrong he is about me.
Now, next to Cooper,
I'm going to look like a total amateur.
Hey, where were you? Rehearsing?
How's Erik?
Well, he can't dance tomorrow.
How would you be?
- Relieved.
- JODY: What?
Right. They think the sun shines out of your ass, so you'd still make the Company.
Just my luck.
JODY: I would kill for your luck.
All I've ever wanted was to be in the American Ballet Company.
Well, there are three places going tomorrow.
And If you both could just chill out and get some sleep, you could get two of them.
Well, you're welcome to my place.
Me? No. I screwed up any chance I had back in September.
Eva.
But I started dancing long before this stupid workshop.
And I'm going to keep on dancing long after it.
So tomorrow is one more day I get to dance.
Tomorrow's when they decide the rest of my life.
I'm not dancing for them anymore.
I'm dancing for me.
Can we just... Let's just go to sleep.
NANCY: Have a wonderful afternoon,
Mr. Dunn. Thanks for all your support.
Oh, Erik, how are you?
It's a sprain.
I have to stay off it for six weeks.
Just long enough to ruin my entire career.
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your half-hour call. Half-hour.
Is Miami here?
Everyone's here.
I'd kill to get an offer from Miami.
GIRL: I can't wear that.
Oh, my God. It's totally packed. Come here.
Can you believe this?
Oh, my God. Okay, I'm nervous. Let's go.
Nicole, merde. Gillian, Lena, merde.
Thank you for your work.
This is what we worked for.
Anna, merde.
Still only room for three of us in the company?
Don't even think about it.
All right.
Merde. Thank you, ladies.
Places! Places!
WOMAN: And curtain warmers out. Go.
Warm the curtain.
And curtain. Go.
How you feeling? You ready?
I guess so.
Look, those fouettes at the end?
I really need you to be on your leg.
- I know.
- Because in rehearsals,
- it hasn't been going well.
- I know.
It's at the end of the ballet and we need everything together,
- everything tight.
- Cooper.
I know.
Sorry, of course you do.
I just want everything to be perfect.
Why don't you let me finish warming up?
You're going to be great.
See you out there?
See you.
Listen, forget him.
Just dance it like you feel it.
Easy as that, huh?
I've got to warm up.
WOMAN: They loved you. Thanks.
Did you see how on I was tonight?
Yeah, totally on.
Okay. Good luck.
Oh, thanks.
- Good luck. Okay.
- Thank you.
What's going on? Does Jonathan know?
Where's Maureen?
Where's Maureen?
What happened to Maureen?
I thought Maureen had this role.
It says here, "Maureen Cummings."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
MAUREEN: Mom.
What's wrong?
- Are you sick?
- No.
Then why the hell is that trash out there dancing your part?
Because I wanted her to. She's not trash.
(STAMMERING) I... I don't know...
Jesus Christ, Maureen!
I don't know how to respond to this.
You could ask me why.
Okay, fine. Why? Why, in God's name, why?
Because I don't want to be a ballet dancer.
Yes, you do. You always have.
No, Mom. If this were what I wanted,
I wouldn't be as unhappy as I've been.
I... I'd have friends, I'd sleep well.
I wouldn't throw up half the things that I eat.
You watch your weight.
There's nothing wrong with that.
God, don't you hear me?
I'm telling you I'm unhappy and sick.
I can't do this anymore. Don't you care?
Of course I care. Of course!
But this is your dream.
Maureen, don't just throw away your dream!
It's your dream.
And it matters more to you than anything mattered to me.
So I did it, but I can't anymore.
Sweetie, It's not that
I don't care about your feelings. I do.
It's just that... You see, I...
I know.
I know what regret feels like and I don't want that for you.
I know what it's like to look back and wish.
That's what ballet would be for me.
A life of wishing that I found something I really loved, instead of something
I just happened to do well.
I'm not you, Mom.
I mean, you didn't have the feet.
I don't have the heart.
That was beautiful.
She was fantastic.
She was okay.
Well, brace yourself for what's next.
And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Hee-hee
Ooh
Go on, girl
Ow!
Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like
I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone
I like the feeling you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be working from 9 to 5
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, baby
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone
Oh, no, no, no Yeah, baby
Oh, oh, oh
I see the way he treats you
I feel the tears you cry
And it makes me sad and it makes me mad
There's nothing I can do, baby
'Cause your lover is my best friend
And I guess that's where the story ends
So I've gotta try to keep it inside
You will never be never be mine
If I was the one who was loving you, baby
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy
And if I was by your side
You'd never know one lonely night
And if it was my arms you were running to
I'd give you love in these arms of mine
If I was the one in your life
Yeah, baby
I wanna reach out and view you beside me
Right here beside me, babe
Take you in my arms right now
Scream, "I love you" right out loud
Someday I pray that I'll find the strength
To turn to you and say
If I was the one who was loving you, baby
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy
If I was by your side
You'd never know one lonely night
And if it was my arms you were running to
I'd give you love in these arms of mine
If I was the one, baby
If I were the one
If I was the one in your life
Dance
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through
Just dance
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
I feel the thunder see the lightning
I know this anger's heaven sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
Because on the boogie I feel so hell bent
Hey, hey
It's just an instant gut reaction that I got
I know I never, ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do
But then that's nothing new
Stuck between hell and high water
I need a cure to make it through
Hey, dance, yeah
Oh, the nasty things that people say
Dance, yeah But I'm gonna make it anyway
Dance, yeah
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know this boogie is for real
Got so much canned heat in my heels, yeah
Gonna dance...
Gonna dance my blues away tonight
Dance
Hey, DJ, let the music... Let the music...
Why don't you just...
Hey, DJ, throw my cares away
Let the music... Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna live this party life
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Hey, DJ, let the music...
- Yeah, just dance
- I'm gonna live this party life
Uh-huh, yeah, just dance
Hey, DJ, throw my cares away
I'm gonna dance this party life
Dance, yeah
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through
Just dance, yeah
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know, know, know I'm gonna dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
They loved it. Beautiful.
WOMAN: Places, please. Places.
Places for the curtain call. Here we go!
You are going to kill me.
- What's wrong?
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- Are you crazy?
- I wanted to tell you.
- Are you nuts?
- I'm sorry.
Ah! There you are.
Cooper, darling, you were wonderful.
You were beautiful.
You were wonderful, too.
I'll have to steal him away.
- I'm stealing you away.
- (LAUGHING)
Excuse me. I have the small rehearsal room.
Do you want the girls first or the boys?
Girls.
Will you excuse me, please?
Tell me more.
I've got dancers and a place scouted out.
There are gonna be studios.
It was her idea!
Oh, God. What happened?
What did he say?
Mom! Oh, I'm so happy you guys are here.
Come on. We wanted to see what you've been up to this past year.
- Dad!
- And I've got to tell you, that was the most fantastic thing I've ever seen.
It was great, honey. Just, just wonderful.
You want to know something stupid?
I'd actually started to believe
I didn't need to hear that anymore.
(SCREAMS) I made it! I made it!
Oh! Thank you.
We'll, uh, see you later at the dorm.
Yeah, we'll see you at the dorm.
Excuse me. Eva Rodriguez.
Jonathan wants to see you.
ALL: Ooh...
JONATHAN: What you did today was completely disrespectful.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Or actually, I'm not.
Because that was the best time I ever had in my life.
Jesus! That's a great ballet, Jonathan.
You know that?
Thank you. And you were great in it.
And I'd like to have you as a member of the Company.
If you'll join us.
Are you nuts?
I hope not, but that depends entirely on you, doesn't it?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (LAUGHING)
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Hey, guess what?
I just talked to Joan Miller.
She loved the ballet and wants to fund my company.
- I'm going to have my own company.
- You're kidding.
- No.
- God, congratulations.
Listen, you have to be in my company.
You'll be its star.
We'll be great together.
Jody, they're ready for you.
Jody.
Wait.
For ten years, all I have wanted was to be one of American Ballet
Company's perfect ballerinas.
I've wanted to be you, Juliette.
But I'm not you.
And I'm not perfect. I'm just me.
Bad feet and all.
And I'm starting to think
I like that even better.
No. Please don't.
Because if you're not gonna offer me a place in the Company, then I don't want to hear it.
And if you are,
I might not have the strength to say no.
And then I'd be spending my best dancing years in the back of a corps, waving a rose back and forth.
And I'm better than that.
So thank you, Jonathan, for turning me into the best dancer I can be.
I appreciate it more than I can say it, really.
Because the best dancer
I can be is a principal in Cooper Nielson's new company.
Erik!
Girl, you are too many things.
I cannot believe it.
I know. I really think
Jonathan should have his head examined.
Oh, yeah, because he's taking head cases and cripples.
- You're in?
- Yes. Bum foot and all!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Maureen, you could have told me.
Sergei, I am so sorry.
I really wanted to tell you.
It's okay. It's okay.
I got San Francisco with Galina.
- Oh! That's perfect.
- That's great. Congrats, bud.
Thanks. I'll catch up with you later.
Congratulations. (LAUGHS)
Hey!
Everyone says you were beautiful.
You didn't watch?
Are you all right?
Not really. No. But I will be.
- Eva!
- Hey!
You will be.
Erik. What did you think?
You were okay, for an understudy.
- I did what I could. Congratulations.
- Thanks.
I hear you got yourself a spot here.
Yup. And I hear you got yourself a principal dancer.
Are you with me?
I'm with you.
You're not going to regret this.
Cooper, you're an amazing dancer and you're a great choreographer,
- but as a boyfriend, you kind of suck.
- (CHUCKLES FAINTLY)
- CHARLIE: Hey, Jody.
- Hey.
So, what happened?
I got in here.
Oh, my God! That's amazing.
Jonathan said you're joining
Cooper's company.
Yup.
I'm starting out as a principal.
What more could a girl want?
Well, a date for the party tonight, for one thing.
Are you asking me out?
Yeah.
Are you saying yes?
I guess so. Yeah.
Come on.
- Jody Sawyer.
- Jody.
When the going starts to get rough
And you feel like you had enough
Let the music take control of your soul
Take a chance and do what you feel
You're a force They cannot live without it
You gotta break the chain yeah, yeah
There's a passion inside
An inner strength that drives
Can't nobody take that away from you
It's the greatest high
You set the floor on fire when you come alive
And we're dancin'
And it feels all right
I can't control my desire
And we're dancin'
And it feels all right
Yeah
And we're dancin'
And it feels all right
Can't hold me down
Gotta reach for the sky
And we're dancin'
And it feels all right
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And we're dancin'
You are the one that keeps your dream alive
And you are the one
Who feels the rhythm deep inside
Do you ever wonder if you can make it fly?
But you will never know if you don't really try
There's so many fast breaks
Quick cuts and a million starts
Can make you wonder
Can make your dream
Ahead from the start
When you know your heart
And follow your own destiny
Don't get lost in the crowd
Be the one to be strong and turn heads around
Moving from dark to light
You have the spark
You have the fire
You are the heart
Now be a believer
'Cause we live in a world of so many choices
It's hard to find our own voices
And keep going on from day to day
So get with the earth
And get with the sky
Get with the inside

Moving from dark to light

Now be a believer
Don't get lost in the crowd
I'm going in, mam.
Mamy.
Suzon! My granddaughter.
Were you sleeping?
-No, just resting.
I'm happy to see you at Christmas.
-So am I.
How are your legs?
-Every day it's different.
Being old is horrible.
The pain is not the worst thing.
It's being dependent on others, being a nuisance.
Don't say that.
You know we love you.
As a family you care for each other.
Dear Suzon!
Chanel!
-You are here.
Fat Chanel!
-As fat as ever.
The weather is awful.
-How nice to see Suzon again!
Isn't she looking nice?
Fit for marriage.
-I think so too.
The sooner the better!
-Your father will be happy to see you.
Does he know already?
-He didn't want anyone to wake him.
What? Daddy is still sleeping?
He has been working in his room all night.
I'm so happy to be home.
This wonderful house.
Your old house!
All that snow makes me think we are in Siberia.
It's terribly annoying.
Luckily we have a telephone and a car.
Meet Louise, our new chambermaid.
Hello, Louise.
-Hello, miss.
Had a nice journey?
-Yes, thank you. Except for that snow.
Shall I wake your husband?
No not for while...
-Can I?
No, better leave him.
He didn't want anyone to wake him.
Will there be anything else?
No, thank you, Louise.
Where is that girl from?
From around here, I believe.
She's great! I'm very lucky to have found her.
And she's willing to stay here for the entire winter.  We were lucky.
Aunt Augustine!
You look tired. How are you?
Same as ever.
This taricardia is killing me.
It's tachycardia, aunt...
-Oh well...
It's freezing with all this snow.
Are you back already?
You were kicked out of school?
No, I've come home for Christmas.
I'm getting good grades.
Yes, your mother showed them.
But grades can be forged.
That wasn't very nice.
Can't I ask my niece if she is trying her best?
Of course you can.
Everything is going fine.
At least someone is happy.
-Are you talking about me?
I'm merely saying my daughter is happy.
-Is that all?
Girls girls, quit it!
Augustine, you are exagerating.
We have nothing to complain.
Gaby has always cared for us.
Not the same as our own home, but it's thanks to her...
No it's not!
It's thanks to your father, Suzon.
He respected your old and, sick grandmother... and a woman of virtue, just like me.
Thanks to Marcel...
-Thanks to both of us, of course.
Don't be so bitter.
You know we love you.
You're not being nice.
Members of a family support each other regardless of all their imperfections.
Coffee's here.
Ah! Warm brioches!
And I always get toast.
Everyone does, juffrouw Augustine.
Those brioches are my welcome present for Suzon.
Take one.
-Thanks. I love them.
I have some chocolate in my room.
Tastes even better together.
We must indulge her.
Augustine is like a child.
Nice of your mother to tolerate her moods.
You call that 'moods'.
I call it rudeness.
But Marcel tolerates her...
Daddy is admirable, and tolerance is a rare virtue.
Very true. And he's always in a good mood.
Even now business is not going so well.
-Oh, really?
You know more about his worries than me.
I stay out of it, and I like to keep it that way.
I have my problems and he has his.
A while ago I asked some advice about selling some of my shares and he said...
You sold your shares?
-No.
He advised me to wait.
Yes, keep them. You never know.
Guess who?
-Catherine!
Little Catherine!
Watch out for my legs.
-Sorry, Mamy.
She's so full of energy.
You rather have her become like aunt Augustine?
You got a present for me?
English chocolates.
-How original.
Don't 16-year-olds love those?
-I'm almost 17.
You'll always be my little sister.
You're looking good.
-So are you.
You seem to have gained some weight.
-Really?
No, or...
Maybe from eating too much muffins...
Where is daddy?
-He's still sleeping.
He's so lazy.
Shall we teach him a lesson?
A little respect please
He's your father.
I do respect him.
In my own way.
And I admire him, even if he is a bit old fashioned.
When I was a little girl you told me
Ill-gotten goods never prosper
In the course of my existence
That didn't always hold true
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date
You said: my child on this earth
You get rewarded for helping someone
But I lend my car to Jean-Pierre
And got it back in small pieces
Daddy, you are so out of date
What you have to do
Is go back to school
And learn all kinds of new things
Invest a little bit
You also told me
Working makes you healthy
I worked around the clock every day
And now I'm so tired
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date
You said: this boy is no good
Watch out or he will hurt you
But I'm in heaven
And fortune smiles upon me
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date
Daddy, you are so out of date.
Are you finished with that racket?
There you are!
-I'm furious with you.
What now, baroness?
-You had your light on all night.
I haven't slept at all.
Been reading those despicable books again no doubt.
-What despicable books?
Aunty thinks they are despicable: detective, spy, adventure novels...
You're too young for those.
-Reading is harmless.
But going to the bathrooms 5 times, wakes us all.
So what? That was me yes.
Where you feeling sick, darling?
I couldn't sleep thanks to little miss perfect.
I wanted something to drink.
I was thirsty. Sorry.
As long as it's water...
He doesn't answer.
You can go in then, Louise.
-Alright, Madam.
How can he sleep with all that noise.
She's so clumsy.
Where has she been trained...
If I wouldn't be tied to this chair...
Madam!
Madam!
-What is wrong?
Monsieur...
But what is it?
-Monsieur... It's terrible.
What's wrong with him?
He's lying dead on his bed... with a knife stuck in his back.
You're mad! What are you saying?
He's dead. Blood everywhere.
It's horrible.
Mama...
Mama. oh baby, sweetheart...
Must be horrible to see for such a confused child. And she's so nervous already!
Watch her for a moment will you.
Watch her.
Mom?
Are you sure?
I have to go.
I have to see for myself.
The door is locked!
Catherine, did you lock it?
I'm giving it to the police.
No one can go in before the police gets here.
The police!
She's right. It's always in the newspaper. Fingerprints!
But my poor Marcel...
-Here. Go ahead.
Do you think you're up to it?
-yes.
We must see.
-Come!
Careful! Maybe the killer is still there.
She's right! Close the door. Quick!
Suzon... Suzon...
-Mama.
Business was going poorly.
He killed himself.
No, the knife was in his back.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Well, in that case...
A dagger with a handle of bone.
Monsieur asked for it last night, to cut some cardboard.
Cardboard? That is weird...
What did he want with cardboard?
We have to call the police.
-Right away?
We have already waited too long.
The line is dead.
Look. The telephone cord has been cut.
But by whom?
By someone!
It's just the wind, and your imagination.
What now? If we can't call the police?
-They will come. I'm going to get them.
You're in no condition to drive.
Louise, my coat.
Madam, the dogs!
-The dogs?
They didn't bark last night.
-And?
Vicious as they are, they would have barked if...
-If what?
If a stranger entered the house?
-Precisely.
But if no came from the outside, then...
Who made the last phone call?
Who made the last phone call?
Me.
-Tell.
I'm telling. This morning around seven thirty,
I called the butcher.
But he couldn't deliver anything because of the snow.
So at seven thirty the killer was still here.
Then he cut the cord.
Tell us about daddy's business.
You know how he was.
A real businessman, always working.
Very intelligent, but not very talkative.
He was always working on several things... but he never told me he was having trouble.
And Mr. Farnoux was a big support.
-Mr. Farnoux?
His new partner at the factory.
-Oh, yes.
Has he been here?
-No. Well yes, once or twice.
We never saw each other.
I mean, very little.
But every time Mr. Farnoux came, the dogs started barking.
They smelled he had a dog himself.
So it's unlikely that...
-Absolutely. Very unlikely.
Mom, who inherits daddy's fortune?
Me.
I mean, we...
In this case the factory get's sold, and the money goes to the wife and children.
His wife gets half and...
Notaries know everything about that.
Catherine, can you get me a handkerchief please.
-Yes, mom.
We must warn daddy's sister.
His sister? Rubbish.
That woman!
Yes, mama. You wrote me she moved to this town.
Do you know why?
Surely to get in touch again with Marcel.
After her decadent life in Paris, she thought she could come back to her rich brother.
Thank god she never set foot in our house.
How awful.
I come home after a year, and daddy is dead.
Killed.
Everything is looking different now.
Incredible how faces can change in a year.
Do I look older then?
No, mama.
You're still as beautiful as ever.
Despite the passing of the years...
Maybe.
But that will probably change soon after this disaster.
My sweet Marcel.
We understood each other.
We had it so good together.
But with separate bedrooms.
Marcel came home late.
He often worked at night.
He asked me to temporarily move.
Anything else?
This is not the time.
-Girls, quiet now.
We must get help.
Gaby, take the car. Hurry!
What if the killer is still here?
-Don't worry.
He probably isn't waiting for us.
He's long gone.
He went out the same way he came in: through the door.
The killer is smarter than we think. And nearer.
Is there a man prowling around?
-A man? Why a man?
What else?
-Well...
A woman!
Shame on yourself! You're accusing us.
If you have a clear conscience...
You have one then?
-More than you.
You think I did it because you hate me?
I don't care about you.
-Can you hear that?
Augustine, darling, calm down.
Of course, take sides with Gaby.
She's rich now.
She can kick us out!
Save your own neck.
Nobody ever contradicts her.
But I have a lot to tell the police.
That's slander, you can't do that!
-Let her talk, darling.
She despises me. She's jealous.
Of course. I'm beautiful and rich.
She's ugly and poor.
Next time it will be right between your eyes.
Such a nice vase, darling!
Do you want something to drink?
-I hate drinks between meals.
Didn't you get up 5 times tonight?
That's something else.
I'm very sick. Heart problems.
Take your pills then.
Fine, I'll take them all, then you'll be rid of me.
Augustine, baby.
-Leave me alone!
Mamy!
Your legs! What happened?
I feel better. It's either the snow or a Christmas miracle.
And we had to buy a wheelchair.
Louise, my coat.
I already asked you 2 times.
Yes, Madam
Did Mamy and Augustine get along with daddy?
I should hope so.
He took good care of them.
They had some fights now and then, but never serious.
Fights? About what?
-Oh small things.
Mamy was hanging on to her shares.
I tried to convince her to give them to Marcel.
Out of gratitude for our hospitality.
Part of Mamy's money belongs to you doesn't it?
Yes, but I gave it to Marcel, when I finally got my hands on it.
Augustine found out and started interfering.
Augustine and Mamy are being torn apart by gratitude and avarice.
What do you want?
They didn't have a rich husband, as you.
That's my fault?
I had to beg Marcel to let them live here.
He couldn't stand them.
Your father always loved youth.
Madam, your coat.
Tell me Louise, when did you started working here.
Why do you ask?
-She's with us since October.
I worked for the wife of a notary before. Do you care to check that?
That's not my job.
Louise, are you sure the dogs were quiet?
Certainly. I couldn't sleep.
I had a bad feeling.
Monsieur wasn't looking all that well when I brought him some herbal tea.
Monsieur asked for herbal tea?
Around midnight.
But he never drinks herbal tea!
He was working...
Maybe his stomach was bothering him.
He called. I brought his tea.
Did you stay long?
I left immediately.
Why didn't I see the serving tray in his room then?
Leave me alone!
Gaby, I need you.
Your sister wants to take all her pills.
She's only pretending! You still believe her?
Can I go now, miss?
No.
Tell me, Louise, when you were making tea, was Chanel still around.
No, she just left.
She sleeps in the hunting lodge in the park.
It gives her a sense of freedom.
We can do what we want after work, can't we?
And playing cards is innocent.
Does Chanel play cards?
-Didn't you know?
Then I said something foolish!
Of course I knew.
And who's she playing with now?
I'm not a snitch.
We won't tell anyone.
Alright then. With miss Pierrette, your father's sister.
Yes.
-And how did you know?
Mamy saw them.
She told me when she was drunk.
She always has a bottle in her room.
So Mamy is drinking again?
What's she like, aunt Pierrette?
An ex stripper, they say.
A talented artist, pure as an angel, says Chanel.
What does it matter.
She does know how to take advantage of her feminine charms.
Can't blame her...
But how does she get to Chanel?
She hitchhikes her way to the freeway
Then she street walks.
She's always been very good at that.
-Where is miss Augustine?
Upstairs.
Bring these to her.
Now, Louise. Hurry!
Yes, miss.
What time did you leave last night?
Around midnight...
Did you go for a walk?
-Are you kidding, in this weather?
Had any visitors?
-Visitors?
I haven't had any visitors in the last 10 years.
-Are you sure?
This is enough!
I've ironed your pants.
You're going to get nicely dressed now.
I'm going already.
But I think you're hiding something.
Your sister doesn't have any manners.
She's not like you.
We are rather different.
And she's still so young.
If only your mother was more strict...
Tell me, Chanel.
Is Louise good at her work?
Let me tell you something, she's a little slut that tries to seduce the man of the house.
About the others...
-Yes?
I'm going back to the kitchen.
I want to tell you a secret.
You're the only one I can trust.
-I'm coming, Mamy.
Your father didn't have any more money.
-That's interesting. Go on.
Out of gratitude for his hospitality...
I wanted to give him the shares your grandfather left me.
He refused them.
He said, "Keep your money,
I'm going bankrupt anyway."
So I kept my shares.
But not for long.
They were stolen 2 days ago.
-Stolen?
They put something in my drink.
A little glass after dinner helps fight the pain.
They've been in my room and I've been robbed.
They knew where I was hiding them.
Under your pillow?
-How do you know?
Mamy, everyone knows.
-Everyone?
What a bunch of crooks!
Stop the thief! Murder!
Stop the thief!
Good heavens! What's the matter?
Why are you shouting like that?
They stole her shares.
-Her shares!
She's lying! She sold them.
And mine too!
I want my share! Now!
I swear they have been stolen!
-But you never leave your room.
That's not true!
I hear her floor creaking every night.
Don't you ever sleep?
-Never.
I listen. All night long.
If the girls weren't here,
I would tell you what I hear.
My poor Augustine...
I know! Gaby, you stole them, to give them to who knows who.
Give them back!
Give them back now!
Madam, don't get carried away like that...
You stay out of this!
You dare to spit at madam?
She deserves it! I spit on her lies!
My poor sister,
I'll get you for this!
Stop it! You act like a bunch of children.
Daddy is dead.
You're right, Suzon.
This is enough. Everyone stays here.
I'm taking the car.
Madam, your bag, your keys...
You should be ashamed of yourself, aunt Augustine.
On the other side of the line
There is your voice
There are words I will never say
Words that hurt if they can't make you laugh
Words we see all to often in movies, songs and books
Words I want to say to you
And words I want to live
Words I cannot say
I want to
But I can't
I'm so alone I'd rather die
And I know where you are
I'm coming, wait for me
We're learning to know each other
Give me some time
I'll give you mine
I want to come to you
But I'm staying
I hate myself
I'm not coming to you
I want to, but I can't
I want to talk to you
I want to be with you
Or try to sleep
I'm afraid you are deaf
I'm afraid you are a coward
Afraid I'm being too pushy
I can't tell you
That I love you: maybe
But if you ever think that you love me
Don't be afraid for your memories
Dare to run until you are out of breath
Then come back to me again
If you ever love me
And have trouble
Finding the right road
Then come back to me again
If you had enough of your life
If every day seem the same
Then think of me
Think of me
But if you:
You think I hate you.
But I love you.
No one understands my love.
They think it's hatred.
Good wine also turns into vinegar sometimes.
-Don't be so mean to your aunt.
She's spoiled by her mother.
Reading all night so I can't catch any sleep.
But I will spare your sister.
-Why?
Because it's none of my business!
I won't tell you that... she was constantly begging Marcel for money.
And that she wasted it on
God knows who!
But it's none of my business.
You won't hear a word out of me.
Bad news, ladies.
The car won't start.
The engine has been tampered with.
And who did that?
-What do you mean?
Madam, I was only asking.
I'll have to tell the police you often go out at night, which everyone knows.
I'll tell the police you often go out at night, which no one knows.
-There are laws against perjury.
And there are inheritance laws!
-Meaning?
You know exactly what it means.
Who has a motive?
-You've lost me.
The heir did it.
That's in all detective novels.
Go study your geography!
Suddenly interested in her studies?
-You want me to slap you too?
That's enough.
We'll have to walk.
I'm going.
-I'm going with you.
This isolation is unbearable.
Look! There is someone in the garden.
The killer is back!
I don't feel so good...
-Shut up.
I'm sorry, ladies.
I would never visit my brother uninvited, especially in this weather, but this morning someone called me.
A bad joke no doubt.
My brother is supposedly murdered.
Then they hung up. I called here but the line was dead.
It's stupid, but I got scared.
The baker dropped me off...
Why are you staring at me like that?
It's a joke, right?
Answer me!
Why is his door locked?
How do you know it's his door?
You've never been here.
Marcel, let me in!
Marcel, it's me, Pierrette!
What's going on?
Don't yell like that.
Marcel is dead.
Dead?
I don't believe it.
Murdered.
A knife in his back.
We must ask you a few questions.
Leave me alone, please.
Who called you?
-I don't know.
A man?
-No, it was a woman.
I don't believe you.
Why would I make this up?
-As an excuse to come here.
Even though you've already been here before.
-Never!
Why didn't the dogs bark then?
-How should I know?
Why is the door locked?
-So no one can touch anything.
I want to see Marcel.
Give me the key.
So you can destroy evidence?
Give me the key or I'll kick down the door!
It's on the piano.
This key doesn't fit.
What?
-See for yourself!
It's another key...
Someone is working against us.
I beg you, stop it.
My nerves are killing me.
We have no other choice.
The key was here.
Anyone of us could have switched it.
Even Pierrette, when she went up the stairs.
I'm a free girl
Who changes day and night
Love is a game
I like to play
But one fine day
I like to be tamed
And stop playing
And share everything
What good does it do to be free
If you have no one to love
I have casual pleasures
And something special now and then
But when push comes to shove
Someone has to pay
And you're even more foolish then me
You teach to wait
And to shiver in prospect
That you'll be mine
What good does it do to be free
If you have no one
Who loves you
Now that your song is over, when did you last see my husband?
You know we weren't the closest of friends.
Don't tell me you never saw him.
I ran in to him a few times, in the city.
He loved me very much.
The fact that you didn't allow me coming here made him suffer.
Well, you're here now.
-Yes.
The telephone call brought us together.
But my brother is dead.
And I've decided to suspect all of you, out of principle.
Where are our manners?
I'm Marcel's mother-in-law.
This is my other daughter,
Augustine.
My son-in-law allowed us to stay here.
Your brother that is.
So you are Augustine?
We are members of the same reading club.
You're with a reading club?
I thought you hated to read?
Did I say something wrong?
Not at all. Not at all!
I might be a member, but I never borrow any books.
Oh, really?
But the loose-tongued secretary told me you borrow 5 love stories a week.
You must be mistaken.
-Maybe.
But last week you were reading
'Gondola of Love'. Weren't you?
'Gondola of Love'?
I didn't think so.
-I read it right after you.
By coincidence.
And I was happily surprised.
Between the pages,
I found someone belonging to you.
Give it back then.
What did you find in that book?
-A letter to my brother, a draft.
To Marcel?
But you saw him every day!
This woman is making things up!
Unfortunately,
I save everything.
An old habit.
"Dear Marcel,
Don't hold anything against me... for shouting at my mother about the shares in your presence.
I had to claim my share, so she wouldn't suspect anything... about my feelings for you.
I'd love for you to have them.
I would do anything to get you out of trouble, but don't mock me again together with Gaby.
I'll put this under your door.
Love, Augustine."
Lies! I despised Marcel.
He was a womaniser.
I mean, he had women everywhere!
He would have given my shares to his mistresses.
She has the same kind of arrogant smile.
I'll get you for this!
Is that a threat?
A motive for murder and a threat is too much for a single person.
I couldn't have killed him,
I was in my room all the time!
You went to the bathroom 5 times, so you had 5 possible occasions.
The bathroom? Which bathroom?
Calm down, Augustine...
Don't touch me!
Bravo, aunt Pierrette, focussing all attention on Augustine.
Well done. But I have to ask you a few questions.
I'm listening.
You said you've never been here?
-yes.
You're lying and I can prove it.
I swear I haven't told them anything,
Pierrette.
What's this?
-Yes, mama.
They know each other and keep in touch regularly.
They both like to play cards.
-Play cards?
What's this about, Chanel?
I might as well tell you.
Sometimes Pierrette comes to my room and stays the night.
My God!
I admit. I came to talk to my brother once.
Couldn't Chanel pass a message?
I bet she came for money.
-I've never asked for money.
He spend it on himself then?
-He knew I was having difficulties.
He helped me a few times.
-I can't believe this!
Mommy, daddy could do as he please.
So what.
I can react can't I.
It was my money!
It belonged to me.
Your greed will kill you sooner or later.
Do hear that?
How dare she...
This woman is terrible.
To be perfectly clear we must know exactly... what everyone has been doing tonight.
Mother, where were you?
-I already told you: in my room.
Did you leave it?
-No. Well yes... once.
To see how Catherine was.
I thought I heard her door.
She was reading.
So I went back to bed.
Catherine, did you get up?
-I went to the bathroom.
That's what mommy heard. I didn't see anything.
-Didn't you hear anything?
I was too absorbed in my book.
I didn't pay any attention.
Aunt asked me if I wanted to turn the lights off.
-You called me all sorts of names.
Stupid kid!
-I'll get you.
Suzon, I forgot something.
I heard a strange sound.
I looked through Augustine's keyhole, and I saw her... standing in front of the mirror holding something shiny.
I didn't think about it at first, but now I'm sure... she was sharpening a knife!
You nutcase!
That was my comb.
I was cleaning it.
-At 3 am.
Combs never sleep!
I can go get it.
No, Augustine. We believe you.
And you went to the bathroom 5 times?
Did you see anyone?
No one.
-You said you heard mother get out of bed.
That's right.
Mamy, seeing as you can walk again:
Did you get up?
-No.
Wait, yes...
Around 1 am,
I went to the living room to get my knitting.
I thought I heard a scream in Marcel's room.
I didn't recognize the voice, but I didn't worry myself.
I thought it was you, Gaby.
You hear someone scream and you automatically think it's me. Thanks.
Louise, do you know anything about this?
No. When I took his tea, he was all alone.
Did you see anyone?
Yes. Miss Augustine.
I thought you said you didn't see anyone?
I forgot. I went to get a drink.
-But you were sneaking around Marcel's room.
What happened?
You could have known if you slept together.
Being judged by my own children!
That's why I never had any.
A man never asked you, say it like it is.
Chanel, when did you leave?
Around midnight.
Before or after the tea?
-Shortly after.
How shortly?
-I don't know.
Five minutes later.
I did some cleaning up.
Louise wanted to bring the tea herself.
Why did you wanted to that yourself?
Monsieur asked me.
That's why.
It's all becoming clear now, young lady.
I'd rather be accused of sin than of murder.
Those two go hand in hand.
But I don't have to tell you that.
What are you insinuating?
And where were you tonight, Pierrette?
I was doing a personal visit that is none of your business... and that has nothing to do with this murder.
Are you sure you didn't see Marcel?
Yes, I'm sure.
So you are the last one that saw my husband alive, Louise.
Is that serious?
I can be accused of murder?
-No doubt!
Than I rather tell.
Sorry, miss Pierrette.
I could have known.
When I brought him his tea, his sister was there.
So, Pierrette. You've been lying.
Why were you with my husband.
I came to talk to my brother.
I was sad.
Why did you talk so loud?
You had a fight?
No. We even laughed.
-And mother thought it was me.
Excellent witness!
So you were following our conversation?
No, I left immediately, and I took the serving tray.
Pierrette, what did you do after that?
We talked some more, then I left.
I can confirm that. I saw her through the kitchen window.
Did she say anything else?
I'll tell you if you'll leave me alone.
She asked me to keep quiet and she gave me 10.000 francs.
Which I regret, little bimbo.
-What?
You sleep with everyone don't you.
-You don't? Even with the same ones.
And why did you give me the money?
I heard her telling Monsieur:
Give me the money or I'll kill you.
No, I said:
I'll kill myself.
No, I'll kill you.
-My poor Louise!
You have nothing to say.
You are merely a maid.
And you do? You are just a hooker.
-But I like it!
Stop it. You look like mad.
I've had enough of this!
I'm going to stop a car.
There is no longer any doubt.
The murderer is one of us.
It's one of the seven of you.
Hey, inspector Suzon, you forgot to question someone.
We?
-Yourself.
Myself?
-Yes.
You now know what we've been doing tonight, but you didn't tell us what you've been doing.
Nonsense.
She arrived this morning.
No she didn't, dear mother.
I saw Suzon here last night.
When?
-Around 4 am.
I opened my door and
I saw you entering our father's bedroom.
I didn't kill my father.
I swear.
Well try to explain anyway!
This is shocking news.
I took the train a day earlier.
Tonight I sneaked into the house.
I went up to daddy.
I had important news I only... wanted him to know.
Without his approval,
I would have never returned.
He was great.
Poor daddy...
He would help me, and told me to go back to the station to arrive according to plan.
I obeyed. That's all.
What was so important?
Tell me, dear!
I'm having a baby.
Madam! Madam!
What now? Weren't you going for help?
The gate is locked. We can't get out. We're stuck here!
I shouldn't have told you were already here.
That's ok. Mom had to know.
So you are having a baby?
-Yes.
What does your fiancée look like?
Does he resemble daddy?
No.
He's tall and blond, and has green eyes.
You are my love, my friend
All I dream about is you
You, my love: You, my friend
I only sing for you
My love, my friend
I can't live without you
My love, my friend
And I don't know why
I've never known any other boys except you
And if I did
I'll forgot about them
Comparing them makes no sense anyway
But my heart believes it
And it carries your name
You are my love, my friend
I only dream about you
You, my love: You, my friend
I only sing for you
My love, my friend
I can't live without you
My love, my friend
And I know very well why
You never know what happens with love
And I always thought
I wouldn't leave you
I left you
Even though I didn't want to
And sometimes I still sing for you
But love fades
You are my love, my friend
I only dream about you
You, my love: You, my love
I only sing for you
My love, my friend
I can't live without you
My love, my friend
And I don't know why?
Is he handsome?
-Yes.
I'm crazy about him.
-Lucky girl. What does he do?
He works in a bank.
His own bank?
-No.
Does he have a car?
-No.
What? Is he broke?
You still thinks money makes people happy?
Does he have a brother?
-No.
Too bad.
You are much too young for a boyfriend.
Too young...
Always the same!
I'm not a baby anymore!
I'm sick of it.
"Don't read. Don't throw stones.
Don't smoke!
Don't, don't, don't!"
And you dare lecture me?
After what happened to you?
I don't want you to make the same mistakes.
I want to protect you.
Me? Don't you worry about me.
Mom?
What is it?
More shocking news?
No, that was all.
A slut!
A slut, that's what you are.
Those things happen.
In your circles yes.
In ours people get married first.
"Circles" no longer exist.
That's progress.
Should I congratulate her then?
-You could be a bit more forgiving.
We can do without your advice.
I just want to help.
If I remember well, your belly was getting bigger too, when you married my brother.
Shut up, you snake!
Thank god Marcel was around.
In detective novels it goes like this:
One of us is lying.
That's the killer.
What helps her is other people lying, but for other reasons.
To find the murderer, we must all tell the truth.
Listen...
I have something to say...
Augustine! It's her heart.
Chanel, boil some water.
Suzon, get her medicine.
Where are they?
-In her night drawer.
She needs an injection!
Louise, get the medicine cabinet.
-Me?
I'm not a nurse.
I'm the maid.
But only you can do it!
Refusal is a crime.
As a maid I only do the housekeeping, laundry and meals.
You can go to jail if you refuse.
Everyone must know his place.
What if judges become doctors, or grocers ministers.
Save us your wisdom.
I order you to inject her.
I have no business dealing with your kind or your grocer...
So madam knows about my kind...?
But because you ask so nicely,
I'll grant madam her wishes.
I can't find anything!
She always moves things around.
I'm coming.
Aunt Augustine is looking so pale.
Isn't she faking?
-She's gaining conscience.
Her medicine are gone.
Someone is trying to kill her.
Baby, how are you feeling?
Terrible. My heart has stopped.
It will start beating again.
-I'm dying.
I need my injection. I'm dying!
-You are not dying.
You faint 2 times a day.
Why is everyone just standing there?
We want to help, but your medicine is missing.
Missing?
-We were afraid to tell you.
I get it! You want me to die.
Like a mutt in the streets.
So I'm not getting an injection.
That's how it is, isn't it?
Fine! I'll die.
I'm going like I came: without any help!
With my sick heart.
All alone.
Poor Marcel, only he was pure...
He's dead because of your corruption.
"Gondola of Love", chapter eight.
Mamy!
I've found the medicine.
-Hurry! Quick!
Careful. Watch it.
Where did you find them, Suzon?
-Under someone's bed.
Which bed?
-Your bed, mommy.
Mine? But that's impossible.
Someone is trying to accuse me.
-No doubt.
Whoever is doing this do us must be our enemy.
There is no other explanation.
-Thinking of me again?
Not in particular.
But you know you are in
Marcel's will.
He told me he left you
2 million.
So, Marcel thought about me?
-Don't act so innocent.
You knew he went to his notary, and when you were sure about your inheritance...
I have a different version to tell.
He wanted to include me in his will, so you interfered for your own benefit.
Repulsing!
-Is there a will or isn't there?
If there is, it's not looking good for me.
But if there isn't, you are in trouble.
I know the answer.
There is none.
I was talking to daddy about it yesterday
He said,
"I'm glad you know.
I'll be seeing my notary tomorrow.
I won't forgot you."
A clever way of saying,
"I'm innocent, daddy was going to put me in his will."
What a despicable insinuation!
You are a monster, Suzon.
I'm not accusing you.
I'm telling you like it is.
You dare to lecture me?
Look at your mother!
And repeat what you just said.
How can you be so bitter when you went through the same thing?
I'll never get over this.
Excellent acting!
-Shut up you!
Why don't you tell us where you where last night.
I'll save that for the police.
Surely with a man?
I'm dying. Hurry up!
You aren't dying, dearest.
Here's your shot.
Wonderful...
I saw something else under your bed.
-What?
Your bags. Packed...
Ready to leave.
Did you have any plans?
None of your business.
Tell me one thing.
Was daddy my real father?
I don't want to talk about that.
I have a right to know.
You were pregnant when you married daddy.
Tell me!
It doesn't matter anymore.
It's all in that past.
Marcel raised you like his own daughter.
Who is my father?
A man I loved.
You have his eyes.
His cheek bones.
His face.
It often touches me when you smile.
I look at you, but I see him.
In you.
Where is he now?
He died before you were born.
In a car accident.
I think about him every day.
Seeing you...
Having him so near me... makes me happy and sad.
Louise not wanting to help!
That isn't normal.
Leave that girl alone.
Why would she kill him?
Because personnel nowadays isn't what it used to be.
By the way, Chanel,
I don't understand something.
You said you left the house around midnight.
But I saw you coat and scarf around 1.30 am, when I went to get my knitting in the living room...
You aren't so quiet usually.
Answer me!
Yes, answer.
I came back after 1 am.
Why didn't you say so?
Because I thought you would find the murderer immediately.
Why did you come back?
I was looking for Pierrette.
And did you find her with daddy around 1 am? -Yes.
Why where you looking for Pierrette at that hour?
I cannot say...
We decided to tell the truth.
I love Pierrette and I wanted to protect her.
She likes the wrong kind.
I can't believe it.
Chanel, you love women?
-Is there a law against it?
Do you have something to complain about?
-But...
You must... You are ill.
Chanel's personal life is none of our business.
Sinners understand each other!
Mamy, stop being so prejudiced!
Where were we?
You wanted to protect Pierrette.
But from what?
I was jealous of her love for Marcel.
It's getting better and better!
Marcel and I were brother and sister, nothing more.
Maybe as kids...
-It depends on the family!
Forgive me, Pierrette.
Chanel, I trusted you completely!
You raised my children!
-I did nothing wrong, madam.
Without me, your daughters would have had nothing.
I won't stand and listen to this.
Especially to someone of your... nature!
If the police arrives,
I won't spare you.
As you wish, madam.
I have nothing more to hide.
Not to be alone
We get a dog
Surround us with roses
Or worship a cross
Not to be alone
We believe in fairy tales
Are fond of memories
A shadow, anything will do
Not to be alone
We long for spring
And when it's over
We long for the next
Not be alone
I love and wait
It makes me believe
That I'm not alone
Not to be alone
Not to be alone
Girls like girls
And boys
Like other boys
Not to be alone
Some children have
Children who are alone
Just like other children
Not to be alone
We build cathedrals
Where all lonely souls
Hold on to a star
Not to be alone
I love and wait
It makes me believe
That I'm not alone:
If you ladies are interested in the whole truth,
I have some more... interesting information to add.
-What is it now?
Marcel and your new maid have known each other for 5 years.
What?
5 Years of hotels and secret weekends.
This winter you were looking for a girl, so Louise had herself hired.
Now that's what I call "taking care of house".
You have enough problems of your own.
Did you already knew Monsieur?
Yes.
So you thought of this plan to come work here?
Yes. We were attracted to each other.
That surprises me.
You are so ordinary.
Maybe it was time for an ordinary woman.
He probably paid you.
Madam is always thinking about money.
But if you rather believe that...
I'm not believing anything, I want to know.
With a little imagination...
I gave Marcel orgasms like he had never experienced before.
In a way you didn't want to find out.
-Keep those obscenities to yourself!
Is it bad to give yourself completely to someone?
That's the most beautiful thing you can do in your life.
You missed your calling, you should have become a non.
I'm talking about love and you laugh.
But madam didn't like it I was so dedicated to my job... and relieved her of all her marital duties.
We shared the same bed.
Stop it. My daughters are here.
Didn't you want to know the truth.
Monsieur's death doesn't change anything.
I'd like to keep working for you.
It keeps getting better.
Nice state of affairs!
Poor Marcel!
I feel sorry for him.
You'd loved to comforted him.
-Is it my turn now?
So you got wind of Louise and
Marcel's affair... and at night you took revenge!
-How dare you? The girls!
The girls? Catherine is mean and lazy, ruined by those books, and Suzon is knocked up.
Yet she's questioning us as if she were Lady Justice herself!
Girls used to have some self-respect!
Now they go out, smoke, wear pants, camp and get pregnant.
How sad!
What do expect with such a mother.
Nice example you are.
Why don't you have any children then?
-Because I'm respected!
Is aunt still a virgin?
-Of course! Who would want her?
Gaby, please! Don't torment your sister any further. She almost died!
Stop protecting her.
And lecturing me.
An alcoholic witch, pretending to be a cripple widow!
You are a liar. And a hypocrite too, consumed by your own greed.
I should have let you suffer.
You ungrateful child!
How dare you?
Your husband is murdered.
Daddy too!
-What do you mean?
You poisoned him.
Literally and figuratively speaking.
My heart!
My heart is going to stop beating...
Now I know for sure.
What?
-Everything.
Or almost...
-Spill it!
One piece of evidence is missing.
Everyone stay here!
I have to go check something outside.
Give me 2 minutes, and I'll explain this murder.
Do you believe her?
-She know's something.
No one was allowed to leave and you let her go.
She'll get away, it's a trick!
-So she did it?
I figured she did.
Now's she's trying to get away.
There she is again!
Let's hide.
Just as I expected...
Where are they?
Why are they gone?
Where are you?
Chanel!
My God.
Is she dead?
-Because she knew...
Now we know for sure.
-What then?
She's not the murderer.
Say something.
You know something. I know you do.
She won't tell us anything.
You scared me.
Is Chanel ok?
-Yes, the bullet didn't hit her.
But she's not saying anything.
The murderer didn't want to kill her.
Or he's half blind.
She's hard to miss.
Maybe he wasn't wearing his glasses.
If you ask me, he wanted to scare her.
In any case, I'm exhausted.
Not surprising considering your "dedication".
-Could be.
Since you spy, did you also hear him moaning with pleasure?
Yes, I mean... I don't know.
But...
Now that we are talking about it,
I would like to...
I would like to ask you something,
Louise.
Yes?
No, never mind.
Go ahead, ask me.
I just wanted to ask how...
How to seduce a man...
You are asking me, the maid, how I seduced Marcel?
Yes, please.
You know, miss...
Femininity, charm... and the art of seducing can't be learned.
You either have it or you don't.
You can try a little.
Hairstyle...
Glasses...
Don't bother
Looking behind
The school board is empty
The chalk has faded
There is no longer a trace
And I live my life, head or tails
Al my feelings, head or tails
For ever and ever, head or tails
It doesn't matter to me
Sometimes I make it
Sometimes I don't
I want to live, head or tails
My love is head or tails
Everything blurred, head or tails
I try everything
Sometimes I get lost
Sometimes I shine
Everyday in front of my mirror
I see dreams appear
And dreams disappear
And time is flying by
But I live my life, head or tails
Al my feeling, head or tails
Every sensation, head or tails
Without hesitation
Sometimes I make it
Sometimes I don't
And I live my life, head or tails
Al my feelings, head or tails
For ever and ever, head or tails
It doesn't matter to me
Sometimes I make it
Sometimes I don't
I can't.
I just can't.
Our dear Augustine!
You always wanted daddy too.
Too bad he went for the maid.
Bitch! Just as mean as your mother.
As long as I'm no longer a virgin at your age.
I've had it.
We must get out of here.
I don't want to be humiliated any longer.
Mommy, can you hear me? Say something!
What did the knife in
Marcel's back look like?
Louise says it was a dagger, but she may be lying.
If you couldn't see the blade, then how could she know?
Stop tormenting yourself.
It's no longer our problem.
Let's go pack.
What if the handle was not made of bone but something else?
It couldn't be a fishing knife...
You are confused by what Gaby said.
What did Gaby say?
-That you killed father.
What's so funny?
It's a despicable lie...
It's not a lie, dear.
It's the truth.
Have you lost your mind?
Why would you have killed father?
There are different kinds of women, Augustine.
And different times, different generations.
Your father...
Your father gave me a good life, without worries.
He gave me everything
I wanted...
He just started his career.
His goal was to make a fortune.
You can't even imagine.
He was brilliant.
He treated me with sensitivity and respect.
A real gentleman.
But I couldn't stand him!
Can you imagine a life with a man you don't love?
And who you have nothing to blame.
Knowing you're stuck with him.
Divorce was out of the question in those days.
So it's true.
I robbed you of a father... and of his money.
That's what made me suffer the most.
That's what made you suffer?
You suffered? You?
How dare you say that, when I never got over my father's death.
Forgive me, dear.
I'll kill you...
-No!
I'll kill you!
-Yes, kill me.
I'll kill you!
-Go ahead!
With my bare hands!
-Do it, quickly!
I'll kill you!
-Hurry up!
Stop it, Augustine!
What are you doing?
She killed daddy.
-I know, but it's too late now.
Kill me please.
-Stop it.
She's mad.
I've been living with a lunatic.
I took care of her, cuddled and kissed her! And she's insane!
Stop it, both of you!
-A lunatic!
Kill me!
-That's enough!
Mamy? Mamy?
Is she dead?
-Only unconscious. Open the closet.
Really?
-She'll calm down in there.
I'm sick of this.
Really sick.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Why didn't you ever tell me?
I wanted to protect you.
I ruined my life.
I ruined my life.
No, you are exhausted.
Lie down a bit, Titine.
What a day.
In one day
I've grown 10 years older.
So did I.
It feels good.
-Oh really?
Yes, I feel like a woman now... instead of a child that no one takes serious.
Now they listen to me.
They are even afraid of what I have to say.
I'm glad Chanel is unharmed.
Al those awful things we've heard...
Strange that she's not talking though.
Either she can't, or she won't.
She's protecting someone.
I doubt it.
Tell me...
Do you believe Mamy poisoned Papy?
I don't know, I hope not.
They hate each other so much, they lie to hurt each other.
I hope we won't turn out like that.
How does it feel to sleep with a boy?
Don't you know?
-Of course. But how does it feel?
You liked it?
Well... it depends.
Never mind. Tell me about school.
How is your English?
You are afraid to answer.
Stop all those questions.
Looks like an obsession.
Pardon me.
Never suspected you were so... frigid.
'Frigid'? Is that a new word?
It means your heart is made of ice.
Too cold to feel pleasure.
Stop it.
I'm warning you!
You can't beat me anymore.
I've grown to old for that.
Hit me again and I'll tell your boyfriend you are frigid.
So what?
You're not even my real sister.
What?
Mom says dad is not my real father.
That's not true!
Thank god he's not.
How can you say that?
You have to swear you won't tell anyone.
I swear.
The baby I'm having?
It's Marcel's.
Louise? My coat, please.
Just put it there.
No, better put it here.
What are you doing?
Playing lady of the house?
-Yes.
I'm tired of being your maid.
You call this clean? Give me that piece of cloth. I want it shining.
You are mad!
Where do you think you are?
In a badly managed household.
The lady of the house is incompetent and doesn't reflect any authority.
How dare you judge me?
You are my servant.
Me working here, was not for myself, nor for Monsieur... but for you madam.
Unfortunately you disappointed me today because of your weakness and mediocrity.
Who is this woman?
Your former employer?
Yes, madam.
And you respected her?
Yes... I loved her.
Darlings, I don't know where this is going...
Chanel won't speak,
Augustine won't stop crying,
Mamy is making things up and Louise is getting arrogant.
Where is Pierrette?
-I don't know.
Me neither.
I hope she's not gone.
-Gone?
In the dark, with all this snow?
-That woman is dangerous.
She didn't answer a single question honestly.
Coffee, madam?
-Yes please.
Louise!
-Yes, miss?
Did you know Pierrette was gone?
She can't be far.
The gate is locked. I don't see her climbing over the wall.
Are her things still here?
-Her bag is still there.
So who was right?
I didn't suspect either of you.
-How is that possible?
Pierrette and Marcel were having a fight last night.
Then she spent the night with Chanel.
This morning she came back and she killed him.
In stead of going home, like she said, she waited and came back, and used the mysterious phone call as an excuse.
You think so?
-I'm sure of it.
She wanted to get rid of her friend Chanel or intimidate her.
Madam, look!
Augustine, what happened to you?
Nothing. I just wanted to be pretty for a change.
Can't I be?
Of course you can.
Is that one of my old dresses?
-I borrowed it for a moment.
You don't mind, I hope?
-Not at all.
You look beautiful, aunt.
Nice to see you like this.
Incredible...
A total change.
Get used to it.
What was that?
-It came from upstairs.
Pierrette is coming to kill us.
What shall we do?
-Nothing.
We'll hide this gun and find out what she's up to. Come on.
Where were you, Pierrette?
-In the bathroom.
Did Chanel tell you anything?
-No, don't worry.
What were you doing in the bathroom?
-Nothing.
Augustine, you look like one those heroines from your novels.
'The Lady with the Camelias'.
-Don't you like flowers?
Sure I do. Especially camelias.
A flower with no scent.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Well, because of this.
It was in your purse.
-Someone put it there, I swear.
Of course.
Easy to prove. The police won't find my fingerprints, while... you did touch it.
-I didn't think of that.
Now listen.
The killer has made sure that we couldn't call the police.
We must get out of here, it's a matter of life and death.
The gate is closed.
We'll try climbing over it using a ladder.
I'm going with you.
-Let's go.
Mom, keep an eye on Pierrette.
Why are you smiling?
You may thank me for keeping my mouth shut.
About what?
You have a lover.
A lover? Is that your latest discovery?
-No, my first.
I've known for a while...
And that's why I killed my husband?
-I didn't say that.
It's too obvious.
If all unfaithful women did that, there would be no more men.
Or lovers.
They usually are both.
They want to buy me cars
Jewels and fur coats
You never!
They promise me a fortune
And also the moon
You never:
And every time they call
They tell me I'm beautiful
You never:
They prey to me and worship me
Yet I ignore them
You know
Man, you're a man like any man
I know
And because you're my man, I forgive you
You never
They make up stories
And I pretend to believe them
You never
They promise to be faithful forever
You never
And when they tell me they love me
They need too many words
You never
I don't care for their fortune
Let them send that to the moon
Without regret!
Man, you're a man like any man
I know
And because you're my man
I forgive you
You never
I don't understand how a man can love you.
You probably think you're more attractive?
The desire of a man is an incompleteness, which we encourage.
No?
Is that how you caught
Chanel in your web?
And seduced her?
Chanel didn't need me for that.
I'm so disappointed in men, that I often prefer women.
Believe me, love between women is not shocking at all.
It's even so nice you should try it to forget about all the men.
Did men make you suffer so much?
-Yes.
Even Marcel?
-Especially Marcel.
I got even with those other men.
My brother was my only family.
When I came here, he was a coward.
He rejected me and locked me out.
I can't forget that.
So I made sure he... gave me money.
Louise heard it correctly:
"Give me the money or I'll kill you."
If you don't help a sister in need, you have to pay.
Now you are accusing yourself.
No. You don't kill your benefactor.
Neither of us would.
You think I'm innocent?
I'm sure of it.
I want to thank you for your discretion.
Concerning my daughters.
Naturally... amongst women.
I have to tell you something.
I should have been long gone.
I wanted to leave my husband.
My bags were packed.
But he was murdered the night
I wanted to leave.
Horrible.
Poor Marcel.
And what's to become of me?
I could give you the money
Marcel refused to give.
That's not necessary. I lied.
He did give it to me.
Why didn't you say so?
I don't have it anymore.
I gave it away.
To a man I love.
Even I sometimes pay.
He needed the money for a trip to Mexico.
To Mexico?
How much did you give him?
-500.000 francs.
In an envelope?
-Yes, a big blue envelope.
What's the matter?
Don't tell me you...
Who's your lover?
You know. My husband's partner,
Jacques Farnoux.
Jacques is your lover?
That is my envelope...
-You can have it back.
It's empty!
The money is gone.
Someone knew about it.
You took Jacques from me, just like my brother.
With your neat and tidy looks!
I failed as a citizen, but you as a whore. I could strangle you.
That's enough!
Stand up! Or I'll shoot.
-Go on.
Shoot! Have the guts.
Do it, you're experienced.
Mom, what are you doing?
Nothing!
We were just talking.
We can see that.
-It's not what you think.
We don't think. We see.
Any success with the ladder?
The wall is too high and there is too much snow. We would fall on the road.
I could have been killed.
-But that's my coat!
Everyone is stealing from me.
First my sister, now my maid.
It kind of suits me.
-I bet it does. Take it of!
Get Mamy out of the closet.
Mamy is in the closet?
-Yes, she's taking a siesta
Unbelievable!
Mamy, is everything fine?
Answer me!
Where am I? What's happening?
I don't remember anything.
-Some things are better to be forgotten.
I had this strange dream...
Marcel was dead.
Still no police.
Why did you get up, Chanel?
This nonsense has been going on far to long.
I have to tell.
She knows everything.
She's playing a game with us.
The revenge of the servants!
-You are wrong.
It's a sad case of family affairs.
-Well? We are listening.
It's a bizarre story.
Catherine, get over here.
Do you know everything, Chanel?
Yes.
Come one, Catherine. Tell us.
Listen. I'm going to tell you a nice Christmas carol.
There once was a good man with 8 women vexing him.
He fought and fought, but they always won.
Last night, that poor man went to bed more betrayed and broken than ever.
His 8 women continued as usual.
Fortunately his daughter Catherine, who was hiding, heard and saw everything.
10 pm. Act 1.
His mother-in-law refused to give him her shares.
My sweet Marcel,
I know you are bankrupt.
I wanted to give you my shares, but someone stole them.
The old lady could have saved him, but her greed made her lie.
Act 2. 10.30 pm.
Augustine, residential serpent, comes flirting and spouting the latest gossip.
I really love my sister.
She's...
We're simply very different.
Aunt didn't kill dad.
She just made him more sick.
But that's no crime.
Around 11 pm.: next attack.
His wife, my mother, tells him she's going to leave him.
For the man who caused his bankruptcy, his partner, Jacques Farnoux!
At 11.30 pm.,
Louise comes in dressed as a vamp.
She's a vicious maid but also perverted.
Her special talents include the misfortune of the man of the house.
Shortly thereafter, Pierrette comes in, daddy's sister.
She milks her cow:
500.000 francs. Not bad!
Thanks.
In the mean time, Chanel is enchanted by the ex stripper, a pathetic jealous scene.
Now come to the hunting lodge.
And to tip it all of...
Suzon, his daughter, comes straight from London, to tell him she's pregnant.
And then, good night!
Who saw daddy after that?
Are you still listening?
You're all ears now.
Only I remain.
-My little girl.
Poor daddy.
I found him this morning around 6.
He was crying.
A father crying is terrible.
Did you ever see that?
There was a big tear on the tip of his nose.
He said: "You're a sweet daughter.
A bookworm with dirty hands but you're everything I got."
I swore to make him happy, no matter what.
But he kept crying.
He said: "It seems wonderful to be dead."
I felt sorry for him.
Pity.
Then I decided to free him from his misery.
You're not saying you...
-Murdered daddy?
Murdered?
Daddy was never dead!
Daddy was never dead!
He's alive! Behind that door!
I conceived this macabre scheme to test you all.
I phoned Pierrette.
Sabotaged the phone and the car, hid the medicine, stole the gun and mom's money... and hid daddy's key, so he could have some peace and quiet.
It was all part of my plan and you fell for it.
You were afraid.
Only Chanel got suspicious.
You saw daddy at the window?
-Yes.
Sorry about the gunshot, but you couldn't say anything... to discover the truth and expose everyone.
Daddy is alive and well behind this door.
He watched everything.
Daddy, freed from you, awaits his little Catherine to leave here. Far away.
I'm the only one who truly loves him.
Heard enough, daddy?
I'm coming.
No one will hurt you anymore.
I'll protect you.
I'll give you everything.
Daddy?
Daddy!
I was only joking...
Now you've really killed him!
Nothing a man owns, really belongs to him
Nor his power, nor his weakness, nor his heart
And if he opens his arms
His shadow forms a cross
When he has found happiness, he ruins it
His life is a strange and bitter divorce
There's no such thing as happy love
His life is like those soldiers without weapons destined to pursue another goal in life
Why would we get up in the morning when the night finds them unarmed and unsure
Say these word and hold your tears
There's no such thing as happy love
My beautiful love, my dear love, my torn heart
I carry you like a wounded bird
And they, ignorant, watch us pass
And repeat my words that die instantly in your big eyes
There's no such thing as happy love
The moment we learn how to live it's too late
Our hearts cry together in the night
It takes much regret to atone for a sensation
It takes much grief for the most simple songs
Lot's of tears for a melody played on guitar
There's no such thing as happy love
How Hermes Requisitioned
His Groove Back
Finally, the last form of the day.
Welcome to stampy town, population five.
And now for the finishing touch.
The cycle of bureaucracy.
Sweet gorilla of Manila!
A letter from Central Bureaucracy!
Attention: You are about to receive a letter from Central Bureaucracy.
It's from Central Bureaucracy!
I'm playing poker with friends from my old job.
Interested?
I only gamble with chumps.
- I'll play.
- I'm in!
Leela. Fry. Robot.
No matter what, I'm available.
We're playing poker.
But my friends are serious.
Bah! Big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.
- Is someone fired?
- Better.
Central Bureaucracy is inspecting tomorrow.
I'll finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is.
Hermes, we're having a poker party.
Whip off some of your jerk dip.
I spent all day cleaning my office.
I got to relax the Jamaican way: warm milk and a good night's sleep.
Jamaican? I thought you were an outer space potato man.
That must be my old boss.
- Hi, Leela. You're fired.
- I know.
Sorry, but you're over a year late for work.
Let the games begin!
So I said, "Your request for a date is flattering, but I decline."
Office romances never work out.
That's how I met my horrible wife.
You never wore your ring.
I didn't know.
She doesn't know I work.
I keep my personal life separate.
Deal! You'll have time to talk when you're poor.
- What's with those?
- My lucky shades.
I got them off a lucky guy while his lucky seeing-eye dog was whizzing.
Hey!
I can't spell anything with these cards.
Finally, I have a good claw!
Three females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery.
It won't matter how many you got.
Bender's hot.
Uh, what can I say?
Must be my lucky shades.
Nothing. Nothing. Crap. Crap. Garbage.
Read them and leak saltwater.
- Oh, man.
- My baby's milk money!
What will I tell my horrible wife?
I'd be more worried about the tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
Let me see those glasses!
Oh, my various gods! X-ray specs!
I swear those are prescription.
I need them for reading stuff.
- Behind other stuff.
- Cheater!
Break his neck!
No! Don't hurt him!
He's my best friend...
Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with x-ray glasses, would ya?
Easy on the arm. Oh! Oh, my ass!
Great cow of Moscow!
Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones!
And a tornado!
I'll never pass inspection now!
They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick at carnival time!
And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
Don't worry. We'll watch you clean.
It's too late. The inspector'll be here in exactly one second.
- Who are you?
- Morgan Proctor, grade 19.
Hermes Conrad, grade 36.
- Enough banter. Shall we begin?
- This way, please.
Jeez, you seem awfully calm.
Don't worry. I have a plan.
I'm going to jump!
- No!
- No!
Do a flip!
Don't do it!
You have so much to live for!
Reverse psychology?
Old friend, don't jump! Use a method that won't damage your liver.
Others need it, you know?
Husband, no!
Out of my way! I'm not cut out to be a bureaucrat!
I'm only anal 78.36%% % of the time.
I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the cement with my body!
If you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide...
...and/or falling permit, you'll be demoted.
Life. Death.
Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
Sweet something of... Of someplace.
I relieve you of duty.
Consider yourself on paid vacation.
Oh! The ultimate penalty.
I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the Sauna planet. Here, read.
Spa 5? Is it good?
Wonderful. I don't know anything about it...
...they give me krill for everyone I send.
I have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in.
I assign me. I accept. Welcome.
It's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat.
Last Monday, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?
- Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
- I thought it'd fit.
- During this, what were you doing?
- Drinking contest with the autopilot.
- I'd have won but I ran out of olives.
- I can explain.
You can explain how you left without enough olives? I think not.
- Is this high school?
- Locker check!
Why isn't this alphabetical?
- What?
- The zipper should be at the bottom.
Uh, sometimes a guy gets lonely.
Oh, l... I've never seen anything like this!
- Why's there yogurt in this?
- I can explain.
It used to be milk, and time makes fools of us all.
You're dismissed!
Fry, I'll speak to you alone.
This is the other Fry's locker.
I'm "Phry."
Admit it, Fry. You're a slob.
A dirty, filthy slob.
Dirty boy! Dirty, dirty, dirty!
What's going on?
I thought you were anti-dirty!
I'm surrounded by neat all day.
Nothing's kinkier than a slop-jock.
Oh, stop.
Listen, you pig. No one can know.
If anyone asks, I'll deny it.
Like every girl I dated.
And two, and three, and four.
Come on, work those arms!
This is no spa, it's a labor camp.
If I get out, Zoidberg will see the business end of a shrimp fork!
Give him one for me, mate.
Don't know why I go to him.
I don't miss twice, campers.
For those six reasons...
...l'm demoting Leela to copilot.
- Under who?
- The autopilot.
- That drunk?
Bender, you're in charge of the professor's bodily functions.
It's full-time.
Fry, I'm promoting you to executive delivery boy.
You won't deliver.
You'll get an office next to me.
All right!
Would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting?
And on the rebound?
Adjourned.
I don't know why she's nice to you.
She's a hateful monster.
She scolded and hit me.
She's risking my friendship with her.
What happened to you?
I walked the professor.
We were in the park...
...and a lady says I stole her purse.
I threw the professor at her.
I had to hit her with a purse I found.
It's Morgan's fault.
That pencil-pushing scaz-wag.
If she were here, I'd...
- Uh-oh, is she behind me?
- No. I'm in front of you.
Morgan? It's 3 a.m.
A skunk knocked over my garbage, and I could only think of you.
My God, it's so...
...repulsive.
So, this is where you eat?
Eat and sleep.
Oh, Fry!
Bender's my roommate.
He could be back.
I ordered him to flush out the professor's earwax.
Hey, Fry? I made you a candle with... What the...?
Oh, now I see. Now I get it.
Now the pieces are falling into place.
The promotion, the dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions.
It's coming together!
I must say this opens my eyes!
Another case closed, my dear Watson.
Come back! It's a loop!
For I was blind, but now I see.
The cat's out of the bag!
About last night, that was just a misunderstanding.
You didn't understand? I'll explain.
You were having sex with you.
No. A bureaucrat of my rank can't fraternize.
That's what makes it so juicy.
It's the forbidden fruit angle.
"Guess who saw
Fry and Morgan doing it."
They'll say, "Who, Bender?"
And I'll say,
"It was lovable old Bender..."
What'd you do?
Downloaded his brain. Bender is here:
His memories, his in-your-face interface.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
But... But Bender need brain.
For smart making!
Stop doing things!
I sent it to be filed at Central.
I had to. He was a bad robot.
He was a bad friend.
I want him back!
You should've filed a request
20 years ago.
I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!
Dirty boy! Dirty boy...
You were having an affair?
She loved me because I'm a slob.
I loved her because I'm desperate.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
Without his brain, he's quiet and helpful.
We have to go to Central and get the disk!
- Oh, yes. We must!
- Yeah!
Why?
Well, that aside, we're going.
You can't waltz into Central.
It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations.
I haven't been. A friend went mad trying to find their washroom.
Then we'll need a guide.
Oh, I've been there! Lots of times.
Carts go out full but come in empty.
It's inefficient!
Pulling empty carts is the closest we get to sleep.
They'd increase efficiency...
...if empty carts brought in machinery.
Hey, I like the way you think.
Oh, Lord.
You know, you ought to be a bureaucrat.
- Will this take long?
- Getting my birth certificate.
It doesn't look like I'll make it inside. Good luck.
Just leave me where I drop.
Someone had a baby.
Come on, I have a better idea.
We're from the delivery company.
We're here to deliver a robot.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
Looks like we've got a new office cutup.
Ooh, ooh! Look out, look out!
I'm gonna crash!
I swerved to avoid you.
Could you tell us where the canisters go?
Central filing.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Wonderful.
No!
Of course I know where it is.
I'm grade 20.
- Where?
- I can't tell.
- What do I look like, a grade 16?
- We're getting nowhere slowly.
I'll address this to the filing room.
We'll track it with my lojack-a-mater.
Cold. Warmer.
Hot, hot, hot, hot...
Don't tell my boss I was asleep.
This is it! We'll run in, grab
Bender's disk and run out. Got it?
We'll never find it.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
You're right!
Nothing's over if there's hope.
Lost something?
I should have known you'd come here.
And I did. That's why I came.
We're through! You're evil.
I never want to see you again!
Help us for old times' sake?
He's lost in the master "in" pile.
It would take an atomic-powered sorter to find him.
You rang?
Damn it, jump already!
Stop hogging the healthy liver!
I want to live!
Organizing the labor spa rekindled my love of bureaucracy.
My Hermes got that hellhole running so that all the physical labor...
...is done by a single
Australian man.
- How'd you find us?
- Dr. Zoidberg.
It was me! I'm the hero!
Request for explanation of incident meeting.
Number 1.0!
Number 1.0, I petition you for an emergency sort...
...under regulation two...
Don't quote me regulations!
I was on a committee to review...
...the color of the book that regulation's in.
We kept it gray.
I must find the disk with my friend's brain on it.
Very well, but your license will be revoked if you fail...
...to sort the master "in" pile by closing.
- 1 p.m.
- That's only four minutes from now.
Requisition me a beat.
I Was born, there Was a hurricane
We had a foot and a half of Water
I cried all night
BleW my alphabet blocks out of order
This boy's born to be a bureaucrat
Born to be obsessive and snotty
I made my relations file applications
To get into my birthday party
- Something changed When he turned pro
- Sorting but Wasn't smiling
- He forgot it's not about rank
- It's about the filing, people
We didn't choose to be bureaucrats
That's What almighty Jah made us
Treat people like sWine, make them
Stand in line, even if nobody paid us
The World looks doWn on bureaucrats
We're anal, compulsive and Weird
Push comes to shove, do What you love
Even if it's not a good idea
- Said I shouldn't be a surgeon
- Poo-pooed my electric frankfurter
Said I shouldn't fly With one eye
I am Bender please insert girder
Everybody sing Jamaica
Just the bureaucrats
Just the grade 19s
- Jamaica
- Sing me home
Push comes to shove, do What you love
Even if it's not a good idea
I'm Bender, baby!
Please insert liquor!
- Yeah!
- Congratulations!
You finished with two seconds to spare, so I'm demoting you.
Good bureaucrats never finish early.
That's okay. At least you're back.
Not yet. I'm acting bureaucrat of Planet Express.
I have some changes to make.
Fry, you're fired.
- Second...
- Hold on!
While I was sorting, I found a document filed by Morgan Proctor.
Form B. Notification of Romantic Entanglement.
She fraternized me!
It's not about you.
It refers to my prom date.
A date that ended in disappointment.
Yes. But you only stamped it four times!
No! No! I was young and reckless!
You are technically correct.
The best kind of correct.
I hereby promote you to grade 37.
And as for you? Guards!
Bring me the forms I need to sign to have her taken away.
It looks like I need my heroic bureaucrat back.
At severely reduced pay, of course.
- Yeah!
- Better than nothing.
Can I get reduced pay too?
You got it! In fact, severely reduced pay all around.
Come on, wife! Let's blow this joint!
Now it's time for my song!
When I Was 2
There Was a tidal Wave in... AW...

{11859}{11889}Mr...
{11891}{11945}Dark, how would you feel about|one of the new Retinoids?
{11947}{11992}Hmm?
{11994}{12059}It... it-it wasn't my ankles.
{12061}{12117}It was chewing my balls.
{12171}{12201}I see.
{12203}{12247}But what I'm asking you is if|you understand the question...
{12248}{12287}No! I don't!
{12289}{12345}Because I have regressed into
{12347}{12423}the pathetic condition|of total dependency, Doc.
{12425}{12453}In short,|and in the vernacular,
{12455}{12481}I'm a fucking kid again.
{12483}{12513}The last time I had
{12515}{12569}to endure anything|this demeaning
{12571}{12630}was in my baby-buggy.
{12632}{12716}I was drooled over|by slobbering cretins...
{12718}{12753}-Mr. Dark!|-who apparently escaped
{12755}{12791}from the local cuckoo house.

{13099}{13129}Dark?
{13131}{13193}What did I do?
{13195}{13231}I'm an author.
{13235}{13308}Oh... oh.
{13310}{13351}I didn't realize...
{13352}{13403}Dan Dark.
{13405}{13438}Trash that doesn't sell.
{13439}{13470}Detective stories|about a gumshoe

{13594}{13635}Hey, listen to me.
{13637}{13666}Please, please...
{13667}{13698}W-What is it?
{13699}{13785}Will you please listen?
{13864}{13909}I can't talk|lying flat out like this.
{13911}{14003}I need... help|to sit up, please.
{14005}{14037}Oh. Well, help him up.
{14039}{14078}You know, l-I really, um...

{14597}{14623}F...!
{14625}{14683}I'd like...
{14684}{14784}Christ, I'd like|to get out of it, but I can't!

{15356}{15400}The tears...
{15402}{15515}All this oozing, useless liquid,|it just hurts my... skin.

{19203}{19250}Uh...
{19251}{19282}he's almost over the edge.
{19283}{19351}I think that Gibbon|should see him. Okay?
{19495}{19582}Pretty Nina was full of semen,|comma, and bath water, period.
{19583}{19618}But the pretty head...
{19619}{19658}that knew too much|was now emptied...

{19751}{19809}A lot of products.
{19839}{19886}Oh, lookee here.
{19887}{19930}Body cream.
{19931}{19978}Jesus.
{19979}{20026}Harem Nights.
{20027}{20050}Is it done?
{20051}{20107}This goo, you put it|under your armpits,
{20108}{20154}you beat your meat with it,|what?
{20155}{20184}-Shaddup.|-Hey.
{20186}{20227}Shaddup!
{20282}{20327}Ah.
{20434}{20476}Just like a dame.
{20478}{20518}Tough guys don't upchuck.
{20520}{20602}They half know that vomit|is a kind of sacrament.
{20603}{20654}Period.
{20783}{20860}How are we today?
{20862}{20928}Mm, I'm not too happy.
{20930}{21000}I don't... I don't|know about him.
{21002}{21048}What?
{21050}{21090}Or maybe you mean you.
{21091}{21115}What do you mean?
{21117}{21208}Well, how are we today?
{21210}{21260}See, you say, "we."
{21262}{21300}Who's the other guy?
{21302}{21342}It's just|a way of speaking.
{21343}{21380}Yeah, it's a medical way.
{21382}{21473}Assume loss of health|equals loss of brain cells.
{21499}{21545}Do you think you have|a positive attitude?
{21640}{21666}Don't... don't.
{21668}{21702}You're going to crack me up.
{21736}{21831}Well, that depends on whether|we're talking donuts you dunk
{21832}{21910}or black feminist lesbians.
{21911}{21969}I'm in favor of both,|up to a point.
{21971}{22010}You know, your illness,|to a large...
{22011}{22142}Will I be able to move|on my own three feet?
{22144}{22203}Will I hold a pen|or a tit again?
{22204}{22247}Never mind the rhetoric.
{22248}{22330}I can get that from|a doctor, Doctor.
{22331}{22394}I have seen a lot of patients|who are as bad as you are,
{22396}{22487}but not one of them has reacted|with such aggression.
{22490}{22540}What they do, sing madrigals?
{22542}{22576}Well, they don't act
{22578}{22621}Iike they've fallen|into a sewer.
{22623}{22692}Ah, see...
{22694}{22735}I thought you were|pushing tranquilizers.
{22736}{22798}I didn't realize you|had a deodorant in mind.
{22800}{22847}You should take them,|you know, the tranquilizers.
{22848}{22963}No! No, no and no.
{22964}{23030}How long are you going|to see your plight
{23031}{23101}through a blinding hot rage,|Mr. Dark? Hmm?
{23103}{23160}What do you live by?
{23199}{23261}What? Come on.
{23263}{23329}All right,|it's an embarrassing question,
{23331}{23396}but surely|there must be something
{23398}{23477}in a time of crises...
{23479}{23513}What do you believe in?
{23607}{23657}Genocide.
{23659}{23681}What?
{23683}{23713}Genocide.
{23715}{23805}Starting in Los Angeles and|working its way eastward.
{23807}{23857}I believe in so many things.
{23859}{23949}Infanticide, insecticide,
{23951}{24017}cy... anide, suicide,
{24019}{24061}AlDS...
{24063}{24088}Okay.
{24090}{24137}All right. Okay.
{24139}{24241}I put my faith in cholesterol,|caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,
{24243}{24333}President Bush,|carbon monoxide, masturbation,
{24335}{24413}nuclear first-strike,|the Reader's Digest and...
{24415}{24500}not properly labeling poisons.
{24503}{24527}Are you done?
{24529}{24558}But most of all,
{24559}{24643}Doc, most of all, I believe|in the one good thing
{24645}{24719}that comes hurtling|out of people's mouths.
{24721}{24815}Ralph. Vomit. Puke.
{24817}{24887}The Technicolor yawn.
{24889}{24923}Cookie dough!
{24925}{24955}There is a good man here.
{24957}{24999}-Uh-huh.|-He's new.
{25001}{25063}He's very alert|and sympathetic.
{25065}{25087}Dr. Gibbon.
{25089}{25147}Doctor... of what?
{25149}{25244}Skin, joints, zoology?
{25246}{25296}He's a psychotherapist.
{25298}{25370}Go fuck yourself!
{25485}{25571}You will never|get on top of your condition
{25573}{25667}until you deal|with your bitterness.
{25669}{25710}Start over.
{25711}{25777}Reassemble yourself.
{25891}{25956}Reassemble myself?
{26009}{26091}With what?
{26139}{26218}Many a tear has to fall
{26219}{26282}Do, do, do, do, do
{26283}{26342}-But it's all|-Do, do, do, do, do
{26343}{26379}In the game
{26381}{26506}Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
{26507}{26546}All in the wonderful game
{26547}{26598}Do, do, do, do, do
{26599}{26725}That we know as love
{26727}{26843}Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
{26844}{26986}You have words with him
{26987}{27149}And your future's|looking dim...
{27195}{27254}Sorry, guys, I need five.
{27255}{27318}The words are breaking my heart.
{27319}{27364}See you gators later.
{27366}{27407}In a while, reptile.
{27594}{27642}Dan Dark?
{27774}{27832}Is it you,|the guy I've been waiting for
{27834}{27896}ever since Sax|invented the phone?
{27898}{27965}Come on, are you the big cheese|with the fat contract
{27967}{28016}who just loves|the way I tickle a tune?
{28018}{28060}Sorry, no.
{28062}{28116}Yeah, that's right, trouble.
{28118}{28176}You're in trouble.
{28178}{28228}I'm told you can help me.
{28230}{28268}You get results.
{28270}{28340}Oh, I get the cases|the polite guys pass.
{28342}{28396}See, I get the jobs the guys|who don't sing don't get.
{28398}{28444}So, what's the story?
{28446}{28480}Who's the dame?
{28482}{28540}How do you know there's a dame?
{28542}{28612}There's always a dame.
{28614}{28734}Tell me, am I right...|or am I right?
{28759}{28820}There's always a dame.
{28822}{28860}Am I right, or am I right?
{28862}{28957}There's always a body, too.
{28959}{29013}Talking to yourself again?
{29130}{29177}I had on my best pajamas,
{29179}{29256}the ones with red stripes|and the blue forget-me-nots.
{29258}{29308}And I was powdered|under the armpits
{29310}{29350}and talculmed|between each toe
{29352}{29436}'cause a million bucks|was about to call
{29438}{29489}and I was ready for it.
{29515}{29552}I see.
{29554}{29588}High temperature again.
{29590}{29623}When she moved her lips
{29624}{29713}I felt like a tulip|in dry season
{29715}{29780}when the first raindrop|smacked into it.
{29782}{29853}I decided to open up.
{29903}{29954}Boy, was I green.
{29955}{30020}Or do I mean wet?
{30126}{30161}Come to grease me, did ya?
{30164}{30200}If you're ready.
{30226}{30274}As ready as a back axle.
{30275}{30374}Okay, let's get these off.
{30376}{30419}I'll try not to hurt.
{30420}{30449}Okay.
{30624}{30662}You look better.
{30664}{30697}Thanks.
{30748}{30791}Oh, cock.
{30792}{30875}Cock, do not crow!
{30876}{30935}Poor cock.
{30936}{31007}Do not stir.
{31008}{31069}Think of something boring.
{31071}{31142}Something very, very boring.
{31144}{31205}Oh. Quick.
{31207}{31316}The Mormon Tabernacle Choir|now brings you....
{31318}{31399}selections from|The Sound of Music.
{31400}{31474}Snoopy pictures on the wall.
{31475}{31534}Nine grain toast with...
{31535}{31599}reduced sugar marmalade. Oh!
{31603}{31677}Old baseball players.
{31679}{31714}Pina coladas!
{31743}{31770}Sorry, is it too hard?
{31772}{31813}Go. Fine.
{31815}{31864}Not... not too hard.
{31890}{31954}It's worst of all here,|inside your thighs.
{31955}{31997}Huh.
{31999}{32026}Organic pizza.
{32027}{32068}Bumper stickers that ask you|to honk for Jesus.
{32070}{32165}Worrying about whales|and, oh, God,
{32167}{32209}oh, what about|fucking baby seals?
{32211}{32253}Fortune cookie messages,
{32255}{32329}and... and denim accessories.
{32331}{32396}Oh, muppets and puppets!
{32398}{32433}Sorry, l...

{34166}{34203}...his lonesome nights|are over

{34307}{34422}Don't have nobody|to call my own
{34423}{34474}Please turn on your magic beam
{34476}{34505}Ah!
{34937}{34974}I'm so sorry.
{34975}{35040}That's the one part of me|that still sort of functions.
{35087}{35149}We don't have to talk about it,|do we?
{35175}{35228}No.
{35230}{35297}They say she was with me that|night, but I swear to God...
{35300}{35354}Swear to something|you believe in, bud.
{35355}{35438}I swear on my mother's grave|Nina left me alive and unharmed.
{35439}{35469}That her name? The whore?
{35471}{35530}Why do you call her that?
{35531}{35602}Dog shit by another name|smells just as foul, pal,
{35603}{35654}and it sticks to the bottom|of your blue suede shoe
{35655}{35706}no matter what|you call it, okay?
{35707}{35746}You've stepped into|something nasty.
{35747}{35782}You want me to clean it up.
{35783}{35826}I want you to find out|what happened to her
{35827}{35879}after she left me...|and to prove nothing bad
{35881}{35910}happened to her|from my hands.
{35911}{35934}But it did.
{35935}{35983}What?
{35984}{36032}Wouldn't that be the way|her mother would see it?
{36034}{36096}Her mother,|for Christ's sakes?
{36098}{36184}You just swore on your mother's|grave, Mr. Binney.
{36186}{36220}I'm not hiring you
{36222}{36286}for a mouthful of cant|and humbug, Mr. Dark.
{36318}{36376}Maybe the cops are fixing|to fry you, Binney.
{36378}{36441}Maybe you're playing|some deeper game.
{36502}{36540}You're not a|nice guy, Dark.
{36542}{36584}Ah, but you'll pay me,|Binney...
{36586}{36664}and you'll pay me double|for the cant and the humbug.
{36666}{36695}Period.
{36697}{36764}Part of the service, period.
{36766}{36832}End paragraph.
{37378}{37404}All right, so, uh,
{37406}{37451}you're gonna wait for|him here, all right?
{37452}{37526}Yeah, all right.
{37528}{37583}Cuckoo man.
{37997}{38023}My book.
{38056}{38138}What's it doing here?
{38139}{38163}What's going on?
{38212}{38279}Your book, Mr. Dark.
{38280}{38311}Happened to pick up|a copy
{38312}{38335}the other day.
{38336}{38374}Oh, yeah? Where?
{38376}{38431}Fertilizer factory?
{38432}{38494}He said out of the side|of his mouth.
{38496}{38543}Gibbon. How are you,|Mr. Dark?
{38545}{38608}Can't... shake.
{38610}{38650}Oh, yes, of course.|I'm sorry.
{38652}{38699}And I wouldn't if I could.
{38700}{38738}I'm here under protest.
{38740}{38807}Well, I see. A kidnap.
{38935}{38969}Little men shouldn't sit
{38971}{39013}where their feet don't touch|the floor.
{39015}{39074}Makes me think|of nursery rhymes.
{39125}{39147}You don't want
{39149}{39173}to see me.
{39175}{39238}What sharpness. What perception.
{39240}{39349}And you don't like it at all|that I've got this.
{39351}{39386}It's full of clues.
{39388}{39445}No, it's full of pages.
{39447}{39490}Oh, but clues are what|you're supposed to find
{39491}{39525}in a detective story.
{39527}{39584}Am I right, or...|am I right?
{39639}{39697}Jesus. You're good.
{39699}{39750}I know clues are|supposed to lead you
{39753}{39792}to the killer, but, uh...
{39794}{39821}what if they reveal
{39823}{39869}the victim a little|more clearly?
{39871}{39917}You think you're being|interesting, don't you?
{39919}{40037}If this was a movie, you'd be|on the cutting room floor.
{40039}{40085}Does your book worry you?
{40087}{40121}I want to go back to my bed.
{40123}{40161}It's vivid and exciting there.
{40163}{40205}Well, you don't|have any visitors.
{40207}{40238}How do you know?
{40239}{40285}Well, does your wife|come and visit you, or...
{40287}{40330}-I'm not married.|-or do you stop her when...?
{40331}{40359}I'm not married.
{40361}{40389}Oh, and period.
{40391}{40452}Oh, oh, yes, I see.
{40565}{40607}Stop it! Stop staring at me!
{40609}{40679}You've never seen|a human pizza before?
{40713}{40792}You... you don't like women,|do you?
{40794}{40935}Which ones? Young ones, old|ones, fat ones, faithful ones?
{40937}{40995}Virgins? Whores?|Try to be specific, Doc.
{40996}{41019}Maybe, maybe you think
{41020}{41051}you like 'em...
{41052}{41174}uh, but, uh, my guess is,|well, you don't like sex.
{41176}{41207}How do you spell that?
{41209}{41255}That's not a word|you see much nowadays.
{41257}{41293}You probably think you do.
{41295}{41340}Sex.
{41342}{41378}Well, we think about it
{41380}{41443}all the time-- I know I do.
{41445}{41511}Oh, if-if-if I say "Fuck you,"
{41513}{41564}does that mean yes?
{41613}{41642}Well, isn't it clear
{41644}{41691}that you regard|sexual intercourse
{41693}{41797}with, uh... distaste|or... perhaps even
{41799}{41834}a little fear?
{41835}{41898}What, am I trapped in here|with a fruitcake?
{41899}{41950}Here, for example,|on page 1 1 6...
{41951}{41995}This is against|the Geneva Convention.
{41996}{42038}Oh, l-I'm just going|to read you a passage
{42039}{42062}out of your own book.
{42063}{42102}-No!|-No?
{42103}{42147}Shove it up your ass!
{42435}{42515}Just walkin' in the rain
{42599}{42646}Getting soakin' wet
{42695}{42737}Oh, no.
{42739}{42777}Torturin' my heart
{42779}{42814}Fucking...
{42815}{42898}By tryin' to forget
{42900}{42959}Dad, what's wrong?
{42960}{42987}Just walkin' in the rain
{43083}{43117}So alone and blue...
{43156}{43251}I don't wish to upset you,|Mr. Dark.
{43252}{43290}I'm just walkin' in the rain,|Doc.
{43291}{43334}I think you know|you need help.
{43335}{43390}Now, you're too aware|of your own condition
{43391}{43430}to deny it.
{43431}{43470}Just collecting raindrops.
{43471}{43526}Most chronic skin patients
{43527}{43598}are on tranquilizers|or antidepressants.
{43599}{43650}See, the skin is|very personal.
{43652}{43690}It's, uh, tempting
{43692}{43747}to believe that the|poisons of the mind
{43748}{43779}have somehow...
{43780}{43874}erupted onto the surface|of the skin.
{43875}{43938}"Unclean, unclean!" you shout,
{43939}{44038}ringing your leper's bell,|warding us all off.
{44067}{44108}That'll destroy you.
{44110}{44162}Yes, I think you know that,
{44165}{44226}or at least|part of you does.
{44227}{44262}You can be helped.
{44263}{44325}Yeah, with a Mickey Finn.
{44327}{44387}Now, why mimic that stuff?
{44389}{44414}What stuff?
{44416}{44453}That out-the-side|-of-your-mouth
{44455}{44481}kind of stuff.
{44483}{44530}That down-these-mean-streets|kind of stuff.
{44531}{44555}I'm sorry.
{44556}{44616}What kind of stuff?
{44666}{44712}You know, my feeling is that,|um...
{44714}{44783}now that... after I've read|some of your prose...
{44784}{44831}Ho, ho, hee, hee.
{44832}{44872}...my feeling is|that, uh, you didn't
{44874}{44945}start out to write in this way.
{45031}{45054}What would you|have preferred
{45055}{45079}to have written?
{45081}{45116}What, if I had the talent,|you mean?
{45118}{45171}No, of course I don't mean that.
{45173}{45200}No, go ahead, be a critic.
{45202}{45256}You got the face for it.
{45306}{45340}If you like, all right.
{45342}{45389}Uh, if you had the talent.
{45415}{45448}If I had the talent,
{45450}{45512}one-liners for Michael Jackson,|two-liners for Helen Keller,
{45514}{45576}if it wouldn't be stretching her|too much.
{45578}{45628}Maybe traffic citations|for Ted Kennedy.
{45630}{45668}Who knows?
{45670}{45710}It's just one word|after another.
{45711}{45760}That's where all the problems|of the world start:
{45762}{45836}the next goddamn word.
{45838}{45871}It's not incriminating.
{45873}{45908}What isn't?
{45910}{46015}Telling me what you|would prefer to write.
{46192}{46259}I would like to have praised|a loving God
{46260}{46307}and all His Loving Creation...
{46308}{46338}Yes.
{46340}{46401}...and to have seen...
{46403}{46466}hosts of translucent angels
{46468}{46535}ascending spinning shafts|of golden light
{46536}{46615}to the deep blue caverns|of heaven.
{46616}{46675}Hell, they'd all have|these massive titties,
{46676}{46716}wouldn't they?
{46718}{46823}Well, here's one part here|that doesn't seem to... fit in
{46826}{46852}with the rest.
{46854}{46877}Here it is.
{46879}{46986}"Mouth sucking,|wet and slack at mouth,
{46988}{47076}"tongue chafing against tongue,
{47078}{47124}"limb thrusting|upon limb...
{47126}{47171}skin rubbing at skin."
{47173}{47342}Hmm... "Faces contort and|stretch into a helpless leer,
{47344}{47466}"organs spurt out smelly stains|and sticky betrayals.
{47468}{47523}"This is the sweaty farce
{47525}{47565}out of which we are|brought into being..."
{47567}{47592}Okay, okay, enough.
{47594}{47626}"We are implicated|without choice
{47627}{47659}"in the slippery catastrophe
{47661}{47732}"of copulations that spatter us|into existence.
{47734}{47757}Okay!
{47759}{47813}"We are spat|out of fevered loins.
{47815}{47849}Okay.
{47852}{47909}"We are the by-blows|of grunts and pantings
{47911}{47943}"in a rumpled and|creaking bed.
{47945}{47978}Shut up, you|sadistic quack!
{48023}{48061}Welcome."
{48063}{48146}Hmm?
{48271}{48344}Yeah, the Milk of Paradise.
{48346}{48399}I can taste it now.
{48555}{48632}How much is that doggie|in the window?
{48663}{48781}The one|with the waggley tail
{48783}{48863}How much is that doggie|in the window?
{48895}{49004}I do hope|that doggie's for sale
{49007}{49115}I must take a trip|to California
{49117}{49195}And leave my poor sweetheart|alone...
{49197}{49243}"The Devil was alive|in his eyes,

{49445}{49506}How much is that doggie...
{49637}{49675}Mark, he's going to see us.
{49677}{49703}No, Mark...
{49705}{49747}Stand out there,|he will see you.
{49749}{49779}Come on.
{49863}{49939}It's okay.
{49941}{49981}Let go, Betty.
{49983}{50036}I'm just scared is all.
{50038}{50083}What can he do?
{50085}{50156}Nothing.
{50159}{50195}We're partners anyway.
{50197}{50242}Says so on the sign.
{50281}{50334}Partners in peanuts.
{50336}{50386}Hmm...
{50387}{50472}Well, I'll take my piece|right now.
{50474}{50519}Don't say it like that.
{50520}{50567}Oh, now, you're just scared,
{50569}{50615}that's all.
{50707}{50750}God, I love your mouth
{50751}{50795}when you don't like|something I say.
{50879}{50939}Ain't nothin' to be scared of.
{51039}{51146}Nobody comes to this old barn|no more...
{51147}{51174}except the rats.
{51175}{51207}And you.
{51239}{51278}Hmm?
{51347}{51406}Sounds like you've|been here before.
{51407}{51463}Me? What for?
{51579}{51611}Who with?
{51643}{51735}You are no good, Mark.
{51814}{51900}What about you...
{51902}{51945}Mrs. Dark?
{52146}{52198}Oh!
{52727}{52773}Oh.
{52775}{52833}Angel.
{53021}{53076}Here.
{53184}{53224}Come on, bitch.
{53313}{53382}Tongue chafing against tongue,
{53383}{53442}Iimb thrusting upon limb,
{53443}{53514}skin rubbing at skin.
{53515}{53622}Faces contort and stretch|into a helpless leer.
{53623}{53748}Organs spurt out smelly stains|and...
{53750}{53797}Sticky betrayals.
{53930}{54068}Just walking in the rain
{54070}{54193}Getting soaking wet
{54195}{54294}Torturing my heart
{54295}{54412}By trying to forget
{54414}{54538}Just walking in the rain
{54539}{54668}So alone and blue
{54670}{54698}All because my heart
{54700}{54737}He's still waving.
{54739}{54796}Dad just kept waving.
{54798}{54841}-Still remembers you...|-What?
{54905}{54954}I said, how far is it?
{54955}{55022}About 200 miles.
{55289}{55358}Will we like it--
{55361}{55384}Los Angeles?
{55419}{55478}Mom?
{55481}{55537}It'll be dark
{55539}{55586}and full of gangsters.
{56148}{56209}I'm afraid|he had to be sedated.
{56211}{56279}He's been asleep|most of the day.
{56317}{56364}The poor man.
{56367}{56415}They're trying him|on a new drug,
{56416}{56478}but you know that, of course.
{56479}{56535}Of course.
{56537}{56628}Mr. Dark?
{56631}{56657}Your wife.
{56659}{56685}You know what, l...
{56687}{56736}Maybe we shouldn't wake him.
{56853}{56903}They wanted to know if you came.
{56905}{56964}The doctors.
{56966}{57016}They'd like to speak with you.
{57018}{57063}Well, yeah, maybe|l-I should speak to somebody.
{57064}{57087}I mean, at least I won't
{57088}{57117}get my head bitten off.
{57119}{57165}Sorry?
{57167}{57232}Oh, uh, if he wakes up|and sees me here,
{57234}{57272}you'll know what I mean.
{57274}{57396}It's... Dan Dark, Darker,|Darkest, kind of his thing.
{57398}{57467}Actually,|I'm-I'm going to go. I...
{57468}{57520}I think|I shouldn't have come.
{57522}{57582}I just...|I shouldn't even try.
{57584}{57635}Wait. Please...
{57637}{57692}Farewell, my lovely.
{57723}{57791}You bitch!
{57815}{57876}Nicola!
{57919}{57994}Come here, you disgusting tramp!
{57995}{58048}You two-bit slag bitch!
{58050}{58081}Nicola!
{58083}{58170}Who are you|spreading your legs for now?
{58202}{58278}Come back here now,|you stupid
{58280}{58307}bitch whore cunt!
{58309}{58361}Mr. Dark, what do you|think you're doing?
{58363}{58415}Where do you|think you are?
{58472}{58499}I'm so sorry.
{58501}{58529}Is there a problem?
{58531}{58577}Yes, there's|a problem.
{58579}{58618}You're the problem.
{58620}{58654}Stop the yelling.
{58655}{58682}It's disgusting.
{58684}{58716}You should be|ashamed of yourself.
{58719}{58740}You stop it at once!
{58743}{58819}I so don't want|to be disruptive.
{58821}{58847}Good.
{58849}{58892}I was just sort of singing.
{58894}{58931}You were what?
{58933}{59051}Many a tear has to fall
{59054}{59174}But it's all in the game.
{59643}{59750}Ah, there are mysteries,|puzzles.
{59752}{59791}There are always things
{59793}{59831}that bewilder us|as children, Mr. Dark.
{59833}{59858}Mmm.
{59860}{59883}Accept it. Yes?
{59884}{59907}Mmm.
{59908}{59955}Accept the sky,|accept the birds.
{59956}{59992}Accept bird shit.
{60027}{60095}Has your wife been|to visit you yet?
{60097}{60158}God, the way you walk|up and down behind me.
{60160}{60218}I mean, are you pretending|to be an oddball,
{60219}{60274}or are you actually nuts?
{60275}{60329}Ah, there you are.
{60368}{60400}You're looking better.
{60402}{60435}Uh-huh. Am l?
{60436}{60475}Yeah. Your posture, too.
{60477}{60503}-Great.|-Less pain?
{60505}{60548}Yeah, maybe.
{60550}{60605}Well, you know, you-you ought|to let those neck muscles
{60607}{60642}...relax a little.
{60643}{60686}Oh, I'm sorry.|Forgive me. I, uh...
{60687}{60710}God.
{60711}{60742}Well, that's why l...
{60743}{60775}Well, look, I just...
{60776}{60817}If you could just|turn your head.
{60819}{60873}Uh, you'd-you'd get|fewer headaches that way.
{60875}{60913}Who says I get headaches?
{60915}{60948}Oh, you do,|don't you?
{60950}{61000}Severe ones, hmm?
{61002}{61040}And no doubt, as a result,
{61042}{61102}your perceptions are probably|somewhat distorted, hmm?
{61104}{61146}Yeah. I can see around corners
{61147}{61198}and right up|your hairy little self.
{61199}{61247}Not to mention that|ugly temper, yeah.
{61249}{61325}Minute by minute,|we make the world, Doc.
{61327}{61362}Our own world.
{61364}{61414}Hmm.
{61416}{61446}Well, what do you think?
{61448}{61539}You think it's time maybe|you went back to work again?
{61541}{61626}Tell me how, Dr. Donothing.
{61628}{61675}Well, I never write|anything down myself.
{61676}{61731}I dictate.|Never tried it.
{61733}{61785}With whom?|Question mark.
{61787}{61833}Well, there are people.
{61835}{61861}Agencies.
{61863}{61895}Has somebody been getting|to you?
{61897}{61926}What do you mean?
{61928}{61986}Has a certain whore
{61987}{62076}of my former acquaintance been|pushing her hard little nose
{62078}{62146}into my affairs?
{62147}{62215}Mr. Dark,
{62216}{62275}do you plan|to get better?
{62277}{62332}Hmm?
{62334}{62430}Chronic illness|is a shelter. Yeah.
{62432}{62479}A cave in the rocks
{62480}{62556}into which a wounded|spirit can safely crawl.
{62558}{62583}Some cave.
{62585}{62607}Oh, no, no, no.
{62609}{62631}Not very comfortable,
{62633}{62655}not at all.
{62657}{62691}No. There are bats in it. Mmm.
{62693}{62739}Squeaking rodents
{62741}{62803}with wings of skin and fur,
{62805}{62839}that hang upside down,
{62840}{62894}crunching beetles|in their teeth.
{62895}{62932}But you know all about that.
{62934}{62959}You know about bats.
{62961}{62986}Shut up, shrimp.
{63018}{63051}You turned, you turned!
{63083}{63115}I did.
{63140}{63174}I did.
{63175}{63223}Not now. No. Go.
{63256}{63282}Who was that?
{63284}{63331}Huh?
{63333}{63376}What's that?|That's progress, Mr. Dark.
{63378}{63406}Progress.
{63407}{63453}Who knows how far it can go.
{63483}{63516}Oh, from the neck down,|you mean.
{63518}{63545}Hmm?
{63547}{63586}If you're thinking|the other way around,
{63588}{63622}if you want to|get inside my head,
{63623}{63672}you better forget it.
{63674}{63734}Hmm. Good.
{64087}{64134}Wait. You...
{64183}{64209}He's asleep.
{64211}{64253}-Who is?|-My boy.
{64255}{64298}You mean you got a kid in here?
{64299}{64326}Jesus.
{64327}{64371}Shh, shh, shh.|Not so loud.
{64373}{64446}Listen, doll, when I fuck,|I like to make a noise, okay?
{64449}{64487}All right, all right.
{64489}{64517}Come on.
{64519}{64560}This way. It's okay.
{64562}{64634}Here we go.
{64791}{64883}What a disgusting disease.
{64885}{64936}Gee, thanks.
{65045}{65089}Dan. I don't...
{65091}{65139}No, no, no. Sit down,|sit down. Why not?
{65141}{65178}Keep the laughs coming.
{65179}{65230}Who's laughing?
{65409}{65458}You are beyond the|shadow of a doubt
{65460}{65509}an exceptionally|beautiful woman.
{65511}{65596}At your peak.
{65599}{65661}That sounds like|a death sentence.
{65663}{65699}It is a death sentence.
{65701}{65727}Dan, listen...
{65729}{65774}Three months I've been|in this fucking bed.
{65775}{65803}You know that?
{65805}{65836}Where you been?
{65839}{65867}Who are you? What are you?
{65869}{65898}I don't know.
{65899}{65949}I hallucinate now and then.
{65951}{65978}Ain't that a laugh?
{65979}{66022}The past, the present--|they're all in that
{66024}{66107}cheap old book of mine,|and I didn't even know it.
{66143}{66171}So are you, honey.
{66173}{66213}-Me?|-Uh-huh.
{66215}{66261}Nicola.
{66311}{66373}Yeah.
{66375}{66446}You are a filthy,
{66448}{66519}predatory, totally wanton bitch|who is always in heat,
{66521}{66572}and I don't want you near me.
{66574}{66612}I don't.
{66614}{66640}I don't. Not now.
{66642}{66693}I don't. Not ever.
{66794}{66843}What if I said|I still loved you?
{66952}{67003}Liar.
{67059}{67139}I have some things|to discuss with you.
{67140}{67236}There's a film company|that wants to buy the rights
{67238}{67302}to that first book.
{67303}{67330}What?
{67331}{67363}The Singing Detective.
{67364}{67414}The one set in the '50s.
{67415}{67463}Is that the book|you've been talking about?
{67488}{67541}They want it|for Roger Rabbit, right?
{67543}{67575}No.
{67576}{67651}They seem, um...
{67653}{67681}keen.
{67684}{67736}Keen?
{67738}{67833}Hey, what's this got to do|with you?
{67835}{67869}You're broke,
{67871}{67934}and you haven't written a word|for over a year.
{67935}{68041}I mean, Danny,|I just want you to be able
{68044}{68076}to support yourself.
{68078}{68124}Oh, God, I see.
{68126}{68209}Baby, Baby-- still thinks|I owe her money.
{68211}{68243}No.
{68245}{68281}You could work|it out at, say,
{68283}{68323}$500 a screw.
{68325}{68384}Isn't that top rate for hookers?
{68430}{68456}Is it?
{68458}{68494}I wouldn't know.
{68535}{68598}Who are you sleeping with|at the moment?
{68695}{68750}Myself, mostly.
{68751}{68785}Mostly?
{68787}{68833}Mostly.
{68836}{68886}Mostly means not always.
{68888}{68956}Right, if you want|to be precise.
{69079}{69142}Dan...
{69144}{69194}you need to function.
{69196}{69244}You just...|you need to get your hand
{69246}{69273}on that old book...
{69275}{69320}What happened to the screenplay?|Where is it?
{69322}{69358}What screenplay?
{69359}{69396}The one in my head.
{69398}{69449}What are you talking about?
{69451}{69477}That is the|worst thing
{69479}{69525}about a detective|story is the plot.
{69527}{69574}It's the best thing, too.
{69576}{69610}I mean, hell,|isn't it really...?
{69611}{69655}It's just... it's|the only thing.
{69656}{69703}You got to work it out|like a rat in a maze.
{69704}{69751}That's what I'm trying to do|right now.
{69752}{69827}Yeah, but with a story|you've already written?
{69829}{69875}Oh, oh, oh, oh...
{69876}{69927}It grows.
{69929}{70045}How... when you already know|what's going to happen?
{70047}{70088}Where is it?!
{70090}{70114}Where is what?
{70115}{70163}The fucking screenplay--|The Singing Detective.
{70164}{70206}I wrote it years ago;|I put in shoe boxes.
{70207}{70228}Shoe boxes?
{70230}{70318}Yes! Fucking shoe boxes!
{70401}{70454}Danny...
{70495}{70560}I know.
{70627}{70677}Boy, do I know.
{70881}{70917}Dan...
{70919}{70979}You need to write|something new.
{70981}{71006}Something real.
{71008}{71036}Like what?
{71038}{71062}Like this, like everything
{71063}{71096}that's happening right now.
{71098}{71133}Not a silly detective story.
{71135}{71160}Something real.
{71162}{71195}Ah, solutions.
{71197}{71222}What?
{71224}{71263}All solutions
{71265}{71318}and no clues, right?
{71320}{71369}'Cause that's|what the dumbheads want.
{71371}{71440}They want the serious novel,|right?
{71442}{71531}Plus descriptions|of the goddamn sky.
{71533}{71574}I want it|the other way around.
{71575}{71612}All clues, no solutions,
{71614}{71717}'cause that's the way...|things are.
{71719}{71775}Now...
{71857}{71922}Why do you know about this?
{71924}{71990}Why do you know?|Tell me.
{71991}{72083}Were you a party to the offer|in the first place?
{72085}{72122}Tell me what's going on.
{72123}{72187}Tell me.
{72189}{72233}Tell me!
{72283}{72341}Paranoia. I don't...
{72386}{72437}Or theft.
{72439}{72498}Danny, stop.
{72500}{72530}Do you want my help or not?
{72531}{72568}Do I want your help?
{72570}{72616}Do I want you to help me?
{72618}{72662}Well, you think on it.
{72663}{72717}Okay. You go fuck yourself.
{72719}{72779}Okay. I love you too, Danny.
{73151}{73197}Hey, Binney.
{73235}{73293}Quote, no luck, period.
{73295}{73325}No good, period.
{73327}{73391}He was getting very suspicious,|exclamation mark.
{73393}{73426}No luck. No good.
{73428}{73494}He's getting very suspicious.
{73496}{73561}But you'll try again, right?
{73563}{73602}I-I don't know.
{73604}{73647}But we could be sued
{73649}{73707}for misrepresentation|if he doesn't sign.
{73709}{73751}I'll deliver.|I said I would.
{73753}{73806}He still looks awful.
{73808}{73849}Don't start feeling|sorry for him.
{73851}{73891}I don't. I hope|it goes right into
{73893}{73934}his fucking bones.
{73982}{74059}You look terrific|when you're mad.
{74061}{74100}Just like a hornet...
{74102}{74159}drowning in the Tabasco.
{74161}{74226}That's something|Dan Dark would say.
{74227}{74267}You sound like Dan.
{74383}{74444}Sorry, Charlie.
{74447}{74536}How much is that doggie|in the window?
{74580}{74673}The one with the waggley tail
{74675}{74735}How much is that doggie|in the window...?
{74910}{74992}She comes on like a rose
{74994}{75074}But everybody knows
{75075}{75146}She'll get you in Dutch
{75147}{75228}You can look,|but you better not touch
{75230}{75280}Poison ivy...
{75282}{75323}There are songs to sing.
{75325}{75373}There are feelings to feel.
{75375}{75412}There are thoughts to think.
{75414}{75460}That makes three things.
{75462}{75519}You can't do three things|at the same time.
{75521}{75567}...creepin' around...
{75569}{75624}The singing is easy--|sugar on the tongue.
{75626}{75666}The thinking|comes with the tune.
{75667}{75709}So, that|leaves only the feelings,
{75711}{75745}and you're not going|to catch me
{75747}{75816}feeling the feeling.|No, sir.
{75818}{75894}...If you let her|get under your skin
{75896}{75979}Poison ivy...
{75981}{76071}Watch the light, dickhead.
{76073}{76128}...Late at night|while you're sleepin'
{76130}{76251}Poison ivy|comes a-creepin' around
{76253}{76329}Measles make you bumpy,|and mumps'll make you lumpy
{76331}{76394}And chicken pox'll|make you jump and twitch...
{76395}{76435}The guy's a sitting duck.
{76437}{76487}But why here?
{76489}{76516}What's the sense?
{76518}{76562}J. Edgar H. prefers a|different kind of tune.
{76563}{76618}What does it matter?
{76619}{76679}Well, I don't like it.
{76681}{76726}Stick to Patti Page, eh?
{76727}{76780}Up there with the lights--|it's the goons.
{76782}{76828}Watch yourself! Watch!
{76830}{76897}...The minute|you start to mess around...
{78184}{78231}How's it going?
{78234}{78279}Halfway there.
{78332}{78398}Halfway to a million bucks.
{78593}{78663}With disdain.
{78667}{78739}Period.
{78741}{78811}I have some nice things,|if that's what you mean.
{78813}{78837}Nice, no.
{78839}{78874}Expensive, I said.
{78876}{78908}Tastes differ.
{78910}{79019}You're more at home in... bars|and sleazy dance halls.
{79021}{79047}Oh, l...
{79049}{79103}do the occasional|Rotary dinner,
{79105}{79155}state prison dance...
{79157}{79202}where I don't leave my hat.
{79249}{79286}What?
{79289}{79352}That's how the cops|got onto you, Binney.
{79354}{79418}You left your fedora on the bar|when you picked up that whore.
{79529}{79563}Money.
{79642}{79704}Money, money, money.
{79706}{79751}What about it?
{79752}{79778}You got a lot.
{79779}{79809}I do all right.
{79811}{79895}What at, I'm wondering.
{79897}{79954}I buy, I sell.
{79955}{80022}Uh-huh. So does|Second Hand Rose.
{80023}{80056}What do you buy?
{80058}{80094}What do you sell?
{80095}{80122}That's my business.
{80123}{80180}Naked flesh?
{80182}{80215}What?
{80217}{80250}Oh, yeah, that's|what you buy,
{80251}{80275}that's what you sell.
{80277}{80320}That's ridiculous.
{80322}{80362}I deal in antiques,|if you must know.
{80363}{80402}The only antiques are some of|the distinguished gentlemen
{80404}{80478}you service with|young girls, Binney.
{80480}{80522}Are you calling me a...?
{80523}{80596}A pimp? Why, yes, you|don't mind, do you?
{80657}{80717}You're a fantasist,|Dark.
{80777}{80816}Get out.
{80818}{80849}Don't let me see you again.
{80851}{80876}What about my fee?
{80878}{80916}Fee? What fee?
{80919}{80979}It took me five days|between my syncopations
{80980}{81047}to figure out that you set up|that poor girl, Nina.
{81049}{81108}Why? I said to myself, "Why?"
{81111}{81162}Just get out.
{81163}{81188}You know what I think?
{81190}{81221}I think she was|killed right here
{81223}{81255}in this museum.
{81257}{81300}You're crazy.
{81303}{81346}But it's not the cops|you're scared of, Binney.
{81347}{81370}They can be bought and sold,|too.
{81371}{81396}Put it back in the drawer,|will you?
{81399}{81478}-What?|-Put it back in the drawer,
{81479}{81530}unless you want a hole|between your eyes
{81531}{81594}that the wind from your ass|can whistle through.
{81595}{81668}You really are crazy.
{81670}{81714}Out of your cheap little mind.
{81715}{81768}Sure. But do it.
{81770}{81836}I've been shot at once tonight,
{81838}{81881}and that's once too often.
{81883}{81949}Okay, okay.
{82101}{82160}This Nina-- she wasn't|one of your commodities.
{82162}{82203}-But her friend was.|-What friend?
{82205}{82266}That girl they scraped up|under the Hollywood sign.
{82268}{82297}The cops say she jumped.
{82299}{82324}But your pals...
{82326}{82350}What pals?
{82351}{82375}Your pals thought
{82376}{82418}she might have passed|something on to Nina,
{82419}{82450}and they were taking no chances.
{82451}{82478}Not with her, not with you.
{82479}{82505}Am I right, or am I right?
{82555}{82581}And now they want me, too,
{82583}{82622}you slimy slug.
{82687}{82754}Go on.
{82807}{82857}Go on.|I enjoy cheap fiction.
{82859}{82891}Me? Nah.
{82893}{82952}I'm no longer in your employ.
{82954}{82982}Fee? What fee?
{82983}{83007}You hired me
{83009}{83032}to find out|what happened to Nina
{83034}{83058}when you already knew.
{83059}{83170}Why? I'll figure it out. And...
{83171}{83240}And?
{83242}{83299}I sing for people|who dance, Binney.
{83301}{83367}Name your tune,|I'll warble it for you,
{83369}{83406}but when you dance...
{83407}{83462}your feet|won't be touching the floor.
{83463}{83512}Oh, you're cheap, Dark.
{83514}{83591}Ten cents a dance.
{85436}{85469}Mr. Dark?
{85548}{85583}That's my handle.
{85584}{85634}I was born at daybreak.
{85636}{85671}Please, I want to talk.
{85673}{85699}You followed me
{85701}{85742}to make sure I wasn't followed,|but I was.
{85744}{85810}Stay back. Keep|out of sight.
{85812}{85871}Meet me at The Laguna|in a half an hour.
{85916}{85951}Little fool.
{86392}{86451}I warned you.
{86453}{86495}I told you, baby.
{86591}{86630}Ah, gee.
{86632}{86716}Silly... poor little thing.
{86718}{86763}Parlow.
{86832}{86858}What?
{86860}{86922}You mean,|the Parlow Atomic Laboratory...
{86924}{86963}here in L.A.?
{86989}{87023}Binney...
{87024}{87057}Mark Binney.
{87104}{87175}He's providing all the girls.
{87176}{87247}Right? Girls like you...
{87248}{87287}Iike Nina.
{87320}{87370}The Reds.
{87372}{87467}They're getting|to the atomic scientists...
{87468}{87494}Yes?
{87496}{87538}At Parlow?
{87540}{87582}Using sex.
{87648}{87695}Sex.
{87915}{87966}Sex.
{88159}{88213}Sex.
{88215}{88293}I'll get ya.
{88295}{88345}Bastards.
{88347}{88445}Whoever you are,|and whatever you are...
{88447}{88510}wherever you are.
{88943}{89013}You're buffeted by this...
{89015}{89069}by that, and it's nothing|to do with you.
{89071}{89137}You know,|someone you love dies or leaves.
{89139}{89188}Then you get ill,|or you get better,
{89190}{89234}and the whole time, everywhere,
{89235}{89307}there's just this canopy|stretching out over you...
{89309}{89356}What canopy?
{89359}{89412}Fate--things as they are.
{89414}{89466}It's irrational,|impersonal.
{89468}{89559}The rain falls,|the sun shines, the wind blows,

{89752}{89778}Call it what you like.
{89779}{89828}There's damn all|you can do about it.
{89941}{90011}Well, physically,|you're on the up.
{90013}{90066}Well...
{90067}{90119}Now we have a firm|grasp of the obvious.
{90121}{90179}Why do you still feel|so disappointed
{90181}{90241}in things as they are?
{90243}{90311}Things as they are...
{90313}{90364}no concern of mine.
{90367}{90434}You object to the use|of the word "things"?
{90435}{90480}Oh, there's a lot of words|I don't like.
{90482}{90526}Such as?
{90527}{90593}Decaffeinated.
{90595}{90641}Hmm.

{90800}{90824}I throw you a word, you...
{90826}{90854}I come back with|another word.
{90855}{90902}Yeah, that you associate|with the word that l...
{90903}{90982}Okay, wait-wait-wait-wait, yeah,|but we got to... agree...
{90983}{91030}in advance|that it's meaningless.
{91031}{91100}Please, there's no diagnostic|value for any of it.
{91102}{91170}Fine.

{98095}{98149}Okay, it's not very legible,|and it hurts, but...
{98202}{98254}First time I actually|have to think
{98255}{98296}about the value|of every little word,
{98298}{98331}and it's just so...
{98333}{98366}Ah, it's dangerous.
{98368}{98402}There's one.
{98403}{98439}Well, it cuts|most of the jobs
{98440}{98462}a writer would get
{98464}{98502}if you have to think|about the value
{98504}{98534}of the words.
{98536}{98578}Hollywood re-writes...|National Enquirer...
{98580}{98610}Dan Rather's teleprompter.
{98614}{98653}Let's see how you're doing.
{98655}{98690}Can you read it?
{98691}{98718}"Memory...
{98720}{98758}upward strokes|and downward slopes..."
{98760}{98786}Mm-hmm.
{98788}{98829}And what's this?
{98831}{98882}"...Comma curls|making me hold..."
{98883}{98944}Yeah, I can read it.
{98946}{98978}-Oh.|-Making you hold what?
{98980}{99005}My breath.
{99007}{99059}Words make me hold my breath.
{99061}{99110}Do they now?
{99112}{99146}Who knows what|they're going to say?
{99147}{99171}But...
{99172}{99231}Who knows where they've been?
{99259}{99318}We're getting|a little heavy here, aren't we?
{99319}{99403}Well, what made you say that,|Brenda?
{99460}{99491}What do you mean?
{99493}{99519}If we wrote that down.
{99521}{99592}Quote, getting a little|heavy, comma,
{99594}{99627}aren't we, question mark,|unquote.
{99629}{99662}If I did...
{99732}{99786}No, it doesn't matter.
{99851}{99922}Ah, well, um...|keep at it!
{100035}{100149}Quote, ah, well, dash,|keep at it, exclamation mark.
{100151}{100352}She smiled, comma,|turned away, dot-dot... dot.
{100354}{100421}Ooh, going off the page.
{100423}{100484}Stop... finished, period.
{100555}{100577}He's dead,
{100580}{100606}period.
{100607}{100673}Out of it, period.
{100703}{100727}That's it.
{100728}{100773}All done.
{100775}{100805}Great.
{100867}{100934}Mmm...
{100935}{100975}I like that.
{101023}{101102}Now Dan Dark's whole script|is in the machine...
{101103}{101146}Minus his name.
{101147}{101229}...we can run off|as many copies as we need,
{101231}{101342}and they can tinker with it|if they want.
{101379}{101402}So now
{101403}{101429}we deliver.
{101431}{101482}And we could.
{101707}{101760}But you must get Dark
{101762}{101800}to sign the rights|to my company.
{101802}{101856}That's essential.
{101858}{101896}Okay. Move forward a little.
{101898}{101920}That better?
{101922}{101949}Yeah.
{101951}{101973}Oh... that's fine.
{101975}{102021}Okay. One...
{102023}{102096}he signs with me.
{102098}{102124}Two...
{102176}{102223}...I sell it on...
{102224}{102350}I-I mean we sell it on|to Mail Pouch Films,
{102352}{102423}and three...
{102424}{102478}net profit...
{102480}{102506}one million.
{102565}{102598}Plus points.
{102600}{102630}Plus points.
{102632}{102678}But he's gotta sign.
{102784}{102819}Don't worry.
{102821}{102866}I can get him...
{102867}{102926}to do... anything!
{102960}{103011}Oh, yeah.
{103013}{103109}Oh, oh, oh... Good girl... Oh...
{103386}{103409}Hello.
{103527}{103550}Hey.
{103551}{103599}Hey. I was just
{103600}{103636}thinking about you.
{103638}{103660}Really?
{103662}{103684}Mm-hmm.
{103686}{103742}What were you|thinking about me?
{103744}{103775}I was thinking|you look terrific.
{103777}{103799}Hmm.
{103801}{103834}So do you.
{103835}{103891}You look better.
{103911}{103938}Don't, Dan.
{103939}{103963}Don't what?
{103964}{103989}Look at me like that.
{103991}{104014}Like what?
{104015}{104039}Like I'm your enemy.
{104040}{104077}Oh, you are definitely|up to something.
{104079}{104104}You are so definitely involved
{104106}{104129}in some kind|of fucking scam.
{104131}{104154}Good old Danny.
{104155}{104184}And it probably has something
{104186}{104213}to do with money-- my money.
{104215}{104242}You haven't got any money.
{104243}{104330}No. Not in cash, maybe.
{104331}{104405}Not in good, old-fashioned,|foldable, chewable lettuce.
{104407}{104445}No. Nor in coins, come to that.
{104447}{104507}Nothing to go|chink-chink in my pocket,
{104509}{104542}but I have assets.
{104544}{104579}Like what?
{104581}{104637}My four detective stories.
{104639}{104666}Yeah...
{104667}{104717}Three of which|are out of print.
{104719}{104764}And the screenplay.
{104766}{104789}What screenplay?
{104791}{104821}Bingo!
{104823}{104853}Fucking bingo.
{104855}{104917}Danny, please,|you gotta fill me in.
{104919}{104946}What are you talking about?
{104947}{104974}With my own two hands.
{104976}{105034}With these dead,|buckled, chicken feet!
{105036}{105082}I wrote it six,|seven years ago.
{105083}{105115}Danny.
{105117}{105155}What screenplay is this?
{105157}{105190}"What screenplay?"
{105192}{105242}The Singing Detective,|that's what.
{105341}{105363}Danny.
{105365}{105399}I put it...|I put it in the thing.
{105401}{105430}I put it up|in the shoe boxes,
{105431}{105460}and I put it in the closet.
{105509}{105563}Oh, that.
{105565}{105590}"Oh, that."
{105592}{105617}Oh, my God.
{105619}{105643}Yes, that.
{105645}{105670}Well, wait a minute.
{105672}{105719}If it's the pages|I think you mean,
{105720}{105791}you threw them out. Ages ago.
{105792}{105814}-No.|-Yes.
{105816}{105863}No. I threw them out.
{105864}{105898}-I threw them out.|-Dan, yes, you did.
{105900}{105924}You threw them out.
{105927}{105960}You said it was garbage.
{105962}{105989}What are you doing?
{106226}{106272}Oh, well.
{106274}{106308}Easy come. Easy go.
{106311}{106347}Was it the only copy?
{106397}{106428}Of course.
{106643}{106679}Did I squeeze it?|Did that hurt?
{106680}{106706}My heart, you mean?
{106752}{106790}You are improving, though,|you know?
{106792}{106814}You really...
{106816}{106846}Except I'm going crazy.
{106848}{106870}Hey, now.
{106872}{106894}I'm going crazy.
{106896}{106958}I lie here and make|these connections
{106959}{107008}between my cheap|little detective story
{107010}{107078}and my own cheap little...
{107080}{107130}Oh, to hell with it.
{107195}{107226}Sex.
{107227}{107258}Yeah, I know the word.
{107259}{107321}Yeah, but that's what|the whole thing is about.
{107323}{107394}My book. My life.|It's about sex.
{107395}{107426}Sex and lies.
{107507}{107570}Oh... I want to sleep|with you again.
{107571}{107598}Dan.
{107600}{107643}I do. With a big|mirror alongside.
{107645}{107705}Oh, stop.
{107707}{107758}That's so I can look|over at myself
{107760}{107842}while I'm fucking|and just leer.
{107843}{107928}And right as it's coming up|in me, the ol' joy juice,
{107930}{107984}I flip it over to one side
{107986}{108048}and come off your gleaming|loins, honey, and just
{108050}{108108}spit right in my own face.
{108138}{108169}Oh, my God.
{108223}{108261}Well. It's improvement.
{108263}{108304}What is?
{108306}{108357}Spitting at myself.
{108359}{108439}A couple of days ago my idea of|true bliss would have been...
{108471}{108518}...spitting into your face.
{108519}{108546}-Dan.|-Huh?
{108547}{108577}What are you going|to do about this?
{108579}{108601}-What?|-This rage,
{108603}{108637}this thing you have,|this hatred?
{108639}{108674}What are you going|to do about it?
{108676}{108729}Well, I'll probably just|write serious literature.
{108732}{108784}Just piss in the wind|like poets and priests do.
{108786}{108808}Who are they?
{108810}{108842}Who are those two?|Who are you?!
{108843}{108870}Who is who?
{108872}{108937}Go, go, go and look,|go and look.
{108970}{109001}No. I don't see anything.
{109030}{109080}What is the matter?
{109082}{109120}Paranoia.
{109122}{109189}Thank you.
{109191}{109264}Baby, I'm so paranoid.
{109266}{109298}Then you've got|everything going
{109299}{109322}for you, haven't you?
{109323}{109359}Mm-hmm.
{109472}{109553}I'm telling you, people|are beginning to notice us.
{109555}{109603}You see, they're looking at us.
{109605}{109678}Who cares? They're all|sick in here, anyway.
{109680}{109727}Are you sure that's|him, with the...?
{109728}{109759}The nurse said so.
{109797}{109894}Maybe we should've brought|flowers... or grapes.
{109896}{109934}What for?
{109936}{109974}Less conspicuous.
{109976}{110003}Oh, yeah.
{110005}{110032}What are we going to do?
{110034}{110078}We going to waste|him, whack him, what?
{110080}{110118}Well, not when|that dame's there.
{110120}{110154}We gotta make him sing first.
{110155}{110182}Another fuckin' song?
{110184}{110206}-Shut up.|-Hey.
{110208}{110234}Talk. I mean.
{110236}{110279}Tell us what|we're doing here.
{110281}{110342}I-I'm sick of standing around|like a dummy.
{110344}{110407}Are we Feds|or aren't we?
{110409}{110433}No. We're just|a couple of hoods.
{110435}{110458}-Shut up.|-Hey.
{110459}{110483}Do you need any help?
{110585}{110639}Uh, do we?
{110665}{110718}Uh, thank you, miss. No.
{110720}{110805}Um, we have seen all|that we wish to see,
{110807}{110891}and our report, uh,|will be a-arriving...
{110893}{110915}Let's go.
{110917}{110952}Hey!
{110954}{110994}What are you doing here?
{111047}{111144}Now, when I get the blues,|I get me a rocking chair
{111186}{111340}When I get the blues,|I get me a rocking chair
{111342}{111373}Well, the blues overtake me
{111375}{111425}Gonna rock|right away from here
{111471}{111533}Now flip, flop and fly
{111535}{111613}I don't care if I die
{111615}{111668}Now flip, flop and fly
{111670}{111745}Don't care if I die...
{111823}{111846}Where are you?
{111847}{111870}I'm lost.
{111871}{111894}Lost?
{111895}{111925}Sorry. I'm lost.
{111927}{111973}Huh?
{111975}{112034}I have a confession to make.
{112035}{112071}Uh-huh.
{112111}{112144}I know more about|that movie offer
{112146}{112173}than I implied.
{112175}{112227}Oh, shit. Come clean.
{112229}{112299}Okay, l... I went, um...
{112301}{112337}to your apartment,|just to check it out
{112339}{112372}'cause you've been|in here so long.
{112374}{112396}Mm-hmm.
{112398}{112432}Um...
{112434}{112464}First of all, Dan...
{112466}{112496}Mmm? Mmm.
{112498}{112547}...the way that you live|is unbelievable.
{112549}{112582}The plants?|They're all dead.
{112584}{112616}Good. I hope they suffered.
{112618}{112670}There is mold on every|single living thing.
{112672}{112717}Uh-huh. Give me|some yogurt, please.
{112719}{112742}First of all, who goes away
{112744}{112776}and leaves Camembert|on the table?
{112778}{112824}You opened my mail.
{112826}{112858}Yes. I did,|but just the bills...
{112859}{112882}You opened my mail.
{112883}{112933}...and this one letter.
{112935}{112966}Don't worry about the bills.
{112967}{113000}That's where I grow the mold.
{113002}{113024}-Anyway.|-From who?
{113026}{113059}...this production company.
{113061}{113099}It's about Singing Detective.
{113101}{113130}Well, yes, it's from
{113132}{113157}this producer, Finney.
{113159}{113184}Okay.
{113186}{113208}Binney?
{113210}{113243}Finney.
{113245}{113272}-Finney with an "F"?|-Yes.
{113274}{113307}Finney with an "F '," not a "B"?
{113309}{113334}-Right. Finney.|-Finney. Not a "B."
{113336}{113379}-'Cause you know him.|-What are you...? What?
{113381}{113403}You know him.
{113405}{113427}I've never heard of him.
{113429}{113469}In what context have|you never heard of him?
{113471}{113496}-Danny.|-What?
{113498}{113542}-Why are you so...?|-Where's the letter?
{113544}{113578}-Where's the letter?|-I'll get it.
{113580}{113603}Where's the letter?
{113637}{113664}It checks out?
{113666}{113737}Well, for what it's worth.
{113739}{113777}But would I get|some dough up front?
{113779}{113806}So it says.
{113808}{113833}How much?
{113835}{113859}40 grand.
{113862}{113906}Ugh. Shit.
{113907}{113942}-But that's for the rights?|-Right.
{113943}{113977}Well, who's going to do|the screenplay?
{113979}{114010}Maybe I can get a shot at it.
{114011}{114049}Well, the producer,|Finney, apparently.
{114051}{114122}The producer.|Why? Why? All these...
{114123}{114153}guys, they think|they can write,
{114155}{114179}every busy little schmuck
{114181}{114216}who can hold a pen|the right way up.
{114218}{114259}I know, so we just take|the money and run.
{114261}{114314}Oh, l... I...
{114315}{114343}Okay.
{114395}{114426}It's a good story, though.
{114427}{114458}Mm-hmm.
{114459}{114507}If it'd stay on the page.
{114539}{114567}Mm-hmm.
{114611}{114642}It's all connections.
{114678}{114713}Connections.
{114715}{114757}Connections.
{114976}{115001}Oh, God.
{115003}{115078}Oh... oh,|we shouldn't have run.
{115080}{115106}No choice.
{115208}{115255}Where the fuck is this?
{115256}{115294}Why here?
{115296}{115354}What are we doing here?
{115356}{115396}Geez. Look at that sun.
{115435}{115466}That is the sun, right?
{115467}{115526}It's a big fucking moon|if it isn't.
{115527}{115554}What is going on?
{115555}{115580}What's going on?
{115803}{115882}What are we gonna do?
{115883}{115911}Hey.
{115947}{116031}There's a building over|there... way over there.
{116083}{116143}"Chew Mail Pouch Tobacco."
{116144}{116178}Oh, no, I hate that stuff.
{116179}{116218}It gets in my throat and my...
{116219}{116318}Maybe what we're looking|for is in that building.
{116320}{116378}Oh, yeah, yeah.
{116379}{116420}What are we looking for?
{116512}{116538}I don't know.
{116714}{116775}Nor me...
{116777}{116806}Nor me.
{116858}{116968}People see us everywhere
{116970}{117080}They think you really care
{117082}{117168}But myself I can't deceive
{117170}{117301}I know it's|only make believe
{117303}{117421}Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,|ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bah, oh...
{117423}{117567}My one and only prayer|is that some day you'll care
{117569}{117630}My hopes,|my dreams come true
{117632}{117707}My one and only you
{117709}{117845}No one will ever know|how much I love you so
{117847}{117965}My only prayer will be|someday you'll care for me
{117967}{118209}But it's only make-believe...
{118211}{118251}Hey, son.
{118303}{118363}Tough guys don't cry.
{118508}{118551}I know that, sir.
{118644}{118746}I can't now separate in my mind
{118748}{118806}the bus that took my mom and me|to L.A.
{118808}{118855}from the one|which brought us back.
{118932}{118995}Brought me back.
{119061}{119095}I dream about it.
{119097}{119158}I still dream about it.
{119160}{119194}But I'm getting there.
{119196}{119231}My head's getting there.
{119259}{119302}Well...
{119304}{119339}What happened to your mother?
{119368}{119415}She killed herself.
{119471}{119506}How?
{119543}{119589}In the river.
{119591}{119630}In the river.
{119663}{119729}Uh... is-is that really|what happened?
{119731}{119761}What?
{119763}{119791}Well, now, now, l...
{119793}{119846}"Now, now"? Wait, wait.|No. Excuse me. What?
{119875}{119934}You have a young woman|drowned in a bathtub
{119936}{119989}and thrown in the river|in your story.
{119991}{120041}So, what about it?|So, what about it?
{120043}{120090}Sometimes a cigar|is just a cigar.
{120115}{120142}Uh-huh.
{120143}{120186}Well, I'm a bit surprised|that you would duplicate
{120188}{120237}such a traumatic event|in your own life in the pages...
{120239}{120281}In what? Oh, oh, in a|commercial piece of trash?
{120283}{120309}I didn't say that.
{120311}{120334}No, you didn't say that.
{120335}{120362}Mm-hmm.
{120363}{120394}No, Dan, I read you|part of your book
{120396}{120420}to illustrate a point to you.
{120422}{120461}Book. I'll tell you,|that book... that book...
{120463}{120492}There are things|in that book, Doc,
{120494}{120534}that are reaching out|to grab me by the throat.
{120536}{120594}Why don't you let them?
{120626}{120709}Why? What?
{120711}{120750}Let 'em.
{120815}{120874}Me, I'm in that book,|and I didn't even know it.
{120909}{120945}Yes.
{121087}{121147}I didn't kill my mother.
{121149}{121232}I can't imagine that anyone|would ever suggest that you did.
{121293}{121409}You know, l... when|I was a... a... boy...
{121411}{121460}Long ago and far away.
{121463}{121540}No. Here and now.
{121573}{121604}I saw my mother|with the greaseball
{121606}{121724}who worked with my father...|Iike, a partner...
{121773}{121820}...in this service station|in the desert
{121823}{121863}that was never really viable.
{121865}{121911}Dark and Binney.
{121913}{121987}Shit, they were screwing,|you know?
{121989}{122050}The noises,|him on top of her, I guess.
{122052}{122117}Kiss, bang, bang--|all that stuff.
{122119}{122145}I don't know.
{122147}{122187}Maybe she would have|gotten away with it.
{122189}{122220}Maybe it was just...
{122315}{122397}My dad was a hard|sort of guy to talk to.
{122399}{122442}You know, he was good,
{122445}{122486}you know, but, as a kid,
{122487}{122568}I couldn't seem to get close.
{122570}{122601}He was good with engines,|you know?
{122603}{122662}Anything under the hood,|and he was just...
{122663}{122770}He was so quiet. He was just...|he was just too quiet.
{122771}{122850}And I wanted to get closer,|you know?
{122851}{122958}I mean, maybe I wasn't the kind|of kid he would have wanted,
{122959}{122994}you know?
{123019}{123086}Reading,|and off on my own and...
{123139}{123174}...Iocked in.
{123175}{123316}That pain-in-the-ass kid stuff,|but...
{123435}{123509}I wanted to get closer,|and l... I...
{123511}{123567}So you told him about her.
{123569}{123598}Well, I traded her in.
{123599}{123670}I traded her in|for a pat on the head.
{123671}{123707}No. No.
{123709}{123755}I got beat instead,|and so did she.
{123757}{123832}He just hit her from one side|of the room to the other.
{123834}{123912}And we went...
{123914}{123961}to L.A.
{123963}{123990}You know, but by then
{123992}{124056}I think my pa's rage|had-had-had cooled down.
{124058}{124096}I don't think|he wanted us to go,
{124098}{124133}'cause I remember him waving.
{124202}{124287}I remember him waving to us|as the bus went away.
{124347}{124382}Away.
{124383}{124456}And l...
{124458}{124513}And my mom couldn't get a job.
{124515}{124541}It was just, you know...
{124614}{124669}She started|bringing men home and...
{124706}{124758}Oh, the poor bitch.
{124806}{124840}I remember these cracks.
{124842}{124885}There were these cracks|on the ceiling.
{124938}{124987}I remember these cracks.
{125526}{125566}All right.
{125616}{125650}Stand up.
{125652}{125682}What?
{125684}{125734}You can. You can do it.
{125736}{125782}Oh, you think so?
{125784}{125845}It's now or never.
{125904}{125970}Yes. Yes. Yes.

{131851}{131906}You had it coming, baby.
{131947}{132002}They should have|cut your dick off first.

{132562}{132632}Yeah.|One step ahead all the time.
{132634}{132692}But I didn't think the Feds|would waste one of their own,
{132694}{132728}but there you go.
{132730}{132804}No morality these days, eh?
{132806}{132865}I know, but I wanted|to waste him on my own.

{136082}{136174}Why aren't you in the bed?
{136175}{136243}I'm not in the bed|because l
{136245}{136293}stood up all by myself.
{136294}{136323}Fantastic.
{136325}{136364}Yeah, see what I can do.

{137228}{137282}One of the prettiest, too.
{137283}{137327}Oh, your eyes.
{137372}{137406}What about them?
{137408}{137452}Your mouth.
{137455}{137494}The way your head|joins your neck,
{137496}{137526}as though|it's hesitating...
{137528}{137600}No, no, no, it's reluctant to...
{137602}{137673}Boy, when I get out of here|I'm just really going to write.
{137675}{137751}The way it, though...

{138050}{138085}Enough of these intimacies, huh?
{138086}{138131}Hell, we hardly know each other.
{138133}{138167}Christ, the only contact
{138169}{138218}we had so far is|you lift up my penis
{138222}{138254}and just grease around it.
{138255}{138298}Oh, what, what's the matter?
{138339}{138382}Whew. Boy, is it hot in here?
{138383}{138421}Lie down, um...

{143077}{143144}But there's just no pay-off|in picking bluebells.
{143146}{143194}Am I right, or am I right?
{143284}{143333}God, listen to that, would you?
{143335}{143369}Can you hear the guy?
{143370}{143468}Anybody'd think his arm|was being twisted.
{143470}{143570}Hell, we've all been in pain,|one time or another.
{143572}{143675}What I say is, when you're|dealing with the devil,
{143677}{143740}praise the Lord...
{143742}{143806}and pass the ammunition.
{143808}{143902}I am not wrong.
{143903}{143934}Neither am I wrong.
{143978}{144021}Oh, geez, the warbler!
{144247}{144279}No fair.
{144281}{144308}Shoot this prick,
{144310}{144334}will you?!
{144420}{144459}Shut up!
{145085}{145147}Don't, please.
{145149}{145171}Please, don't.
{145173}{145218}Shut your pie hole.
{145243}{145301}No, wait. That's murder.
{145356}{145397}You get a load of that?
{145398}{145438}Murder, he says.
{145440}{145472}I call it...
{145474}{145500}pruning.
{145502}{145578}Only one of us is going|to walk out of here.
{145580}{145624}Sweeter than the roses.
{145698}{145734}What, are you kidding me|with this?
{145833}{145871}Ah, shucks.
{145873}{145950}You could say we'd been|partners, him and me.
{145952}{146052}Like Laurel and Hardy|or Donald and lvana.
{146054}{146214}But, heck, this was|one sick pup, from way back.
{146216}{146306}And I reckon I'm man enough|to tie my own shoelaces now.
{146856}{146889}Hey.
{146891}{146984}You got my hat?
{146986}{147022}Have I got your hat?
{147206}{147260}I think I've cracked this case.
{147299}{147334}Yeah, I think you have, but...
{147335}{147372}No buts.
{147374}{147410}Watch my lips.
{147412}{147437}What?
{147491}{147578}In my dreams you told me
{147580}{147649}You really, really care
{147650}{147727}In my dreams you told me

{148076}{148178}In my dreams you told me
{148179}{148249}Our love was here to stay
{148250}{148325}In my dreams you told me
{148327}{148398}Forever and a day
{148400}{148477}That you'll love me,|love me, love me
{148478}{148588}And never, ever let me go
{148590}{148691}Wah-wah-wah-wah

Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?
Oh, no.
I love ballet.
Now, I never had the body for it.
Hey, you dance?
I used to.
I've got something for you.
It's for love, not luck.
Because you don't need luck, you dance like an angel.
Mom.
You're the best luck
I'll ever have.
Are you okay?
I kept messing up these pirouettes.
It's really frustrating, but it'll be okay.
My mom's going to be there.
She's going to drive me.
You've nothing to worry about, you're going to do absolutely fine.
You're the best dancer in Lemont.
Lindsay, this is not Lemont.
This is Juilliard, New York City.
- Do you want to pray?
- What?
You're leaving for St. Louis. I'm not gonna see you. We should pray.
- Lindsay-
- Father, S.J. auditions today, let her do okay.
We've got the Carson wedding, the Dankowski party, two funerals and Jill calls in sick today, of all days.
Sara, I'm sorry. I have to handle this, there isn't anybody else.
- Mom, what about-
- Glynn? Do they want roses in this?
- It doesn't say what color mums.
-Judy took that order, ask her.
Mom? This is the hardest, most important day of my life.
You have to be there.
You promised.
I know.
- Excuse me, are you Sara Johnson?
- Yes.
You're next.
I'll be there, I promise, before you audition.
Is there anything you would like to share with us... about your contemporary piece before you begin?
No, it's pretty self-explanatory.
Did you have a good ride?
I slept through most of it.
I guess you got stuff.
Baggage?
Three suitcases.
One big one.
Sorry I had to split so soon after the funeral.
If I could have gotten out of that gig in South Bend,
I would have hung around a lot longer.
Guess it was pretty tough
Leaving all your friends.
Uh-huh.
Here we are.
Put 'em anywhere.
Give you the grand tour.
It's not much of what you're used to, but the water's hot and the mice are friendly.
Uh, bathroom.
Kitchen, big kitchen.
Uh... this is where I sleep.
Didn't get a chance to make the bed today.
Where do I sleep?
Nixon was probably in office... when they rolled this off the assembly line, but, uh, there's a brand-new mattress in there.
Most of your clothes should fit in here.
Whatever's left over can put in the hall closet.
I know it's a little bit out in the open, but...
I didn't get a chance to finish your room here.
Yeah, I'll fix that.
It's a work in progress.
I'll have it up and running in no time.
A few minor adjustments.
Well, I guess
I'll let you get unpacked.
You don't have to come in with me...
- since I'm all set.
- I'm your father, I'm supposed to.
You don't know where to go, who to see.
It's okay. I mean, I have done this before, gone to school.
All right, well, this is the name they gave me.
"Mrs. Gwynn.
Main office."
I'll be back to pick you up at 3.30.
Okay, sure.
Whatever.
- Hey, look at the white girl.
- Wassup, baby?
My door is always open. And contrary to hall rumor, you can talk to me.
Do you have any questions or concerns?
No questions, no answers.
All right. This is Mr. Campbell's class, and he's expecting you.
Truman Capote. In Cold Blood... represents a complete turning point in American history... and American literature- you want to tell us why, Mr. Ricard?
Gay rights.
- The Com-pote dude who wrote it-
- Capote.
- Capote?
- Capote.
Sweet tooth. Straight-up fag,
Mr. C. I'm serious.
- Flaming.
Thank you very much. We can now promote you up to kindergarten.
Any body else?
Once, twice.
Miss Johnson, I apologize
If any of this is over your head, but if you see me after class,
I'll give you some chapters.
Anybody?
Come on.
It's a non-fiction novel.
Capote mixed true events... with things that he couldn't know so he made them up.
He created a new genre.
White folks back then felt safe.
Capote scared them.
He took hard-core crime out of the ghetto... and placed it in America's backyard, that's what makes the book special.
- Yeah, that's part of it.
- That's all of it.
- We got a debate going on now.
- Capote wasn't the first.
Richard Wright, James Baldwin did the same thing.
Wasn't nobody trying to read them, though.
A lot of people read them.
A lot of people like who?
You?
- Didn't think so.
- Mr. C? Mr. C?
- Yeah?
- Your girl needs to bone up.
I think you need to give her a pass to the library.
We need to get a parent-teacher's conference, something going on.
Why don't you lend her yours?
'Cause obviously, you don't ever use it.
Yo, Latrice, Mr. Jackson's civics class?
You will have a pop quiz.
It's mad hard, aright?
Aright.
That's how easy it is to give to charity around here.
Thanks.
Don't put your shit on the floor.
I'm-
So, here lam trying to study, right?
And he's crying and crying,
I can't get anything done-
Yo, where were you in math class? Man-
It was so hard.
Life it blank, the whole thing.
For real. And if you had been there,
I'd of had my notes from yesterday.
I know you're new to the table, but just look at this, we are the 2K generation... and no one takes us seriously.
We don't even take ourselves seriously. And just look around, half the student body is DOA, and that's from the neck up, Clara.
Sara. It's Sara.
Yeah, it's Sara.
You finished?
Yes.
- Thank you so much.
- Mm-hmm. No problem.
You need to watch where you sit, girl.
Don't ever let me catch you at that table again. And it's Chenille.
Put your tray down here, and let me introduce you... to some of the ladies that I roll with.
- It's just a little hip-hop.
Come on.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Girls, this is Sara.
Sara, this is Portia and Tanisha.
And this is Diggy.
- She thinks she's down.
- Excuse me? I am down, okay.
- Yeah, whatever.
- You said you knew how to play.
Girl, that earring is fresh as hell, did it hurt?
Stick a pin through your eyebrow,
- see if it hurts.
- Asshole.
Who? 'Cause in this crowd you're going to have to be more specific.
The guy sitting by the window with the blue sweater.
He's in my English class.
He think she's so smart and so cute.
- Derek Reynolds?
- Oh, so you know him?
Hell, yeah, I know him.
He's my brother.
Oh.
Well, he's not an asshole, per se-
Forget about it, girl.
It's all right.
Don't even sweat it.
- Yo, Derek. Hey, yo.
- Hey, man.
Medicine man.
What's up, Kai? Man, baby,
I was just asking about you, and I got a little emotional too about you being back and all.
Man, sit your punk ass down, fool.
Matter of fact, step your ass off.
Give us some space.
Man, why we- Everybody's got a piece in the hook.
You look good, man.
Who you stealing from? Nice jacket.
What's up, man?
How'd it go with Mrs. Gwynn?
Bullshit. "You're a smart boy, you can learn from your mistakes.
I'm here for you. "Yeah, she's there for me, all right.
But you're hangin' in, though.
You feeling strong?
Strong about what? First week back at home sweet high school?
You enlisted in this shit.
I'm drafted.
Judge said finish school or finish your sentence.
Like they both ain't
12 months of a long-ass time.
But a year here is better than another one served up at juvee.
- At least we got chicks in here.
- Yeah, man.
- I'll check you later, man.
- All right, man.
See this honey.
Hey, Sara.
Come in here a minute, will you?
You've been working awhile in there.
You must be getting hungry.
What do you say? Look...
"Swanson Hungry Man Dinners."
They're the best.
Look, got every style.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?
I had a big lunch.
All right, well... they're in here if you change your mind.
Unless your plan is to starve yourself to death.
It's not a plan. I just don't eat when I'm not hungry.
- Mom never let me eat that stuff.
- Okay.
Hey, uh-
Listen, uh-
I got a gig downtown tonight.
What do you say?
You haven't heard me play for awhile.
What do you say?
You want to come with me, and hang out, and maybe we'll get a bite to eat afterwards?
- It's a school night, Roy.
- Oh, yeah.
It's a school night, yeah.
I forgot.
All right, then.
Well, I'll just go.
And, uh, you can eat or not eat.
And I'll be back when I'm back.
Stepps is gonna be off the hinges Friday night.
I'm a bust a new move, break in the new Jordans... and bring a little honey.
- Why, your hand busy?
If it wasn't for that attitude, you could be the lucky girl.
- I can see us right now, baby.
- Yeah, in your dreams.
Help me, dog.
Defend me, man!
I got my own problems,
Snook.
Problems? What problems?
We ain't got no damn problems.
You going to college, doctor college after that. You the man, dog.
He tripping off his acceptance letter from Georgetown.
No, I'm waiting for my letter.
I've been waiting.
I could have been a doctor too, you know what I'm saying?
If it wasn't for that time
I got left back.
"That time"? What, fifth and sixth grade don't count?
Why do you always try to make me feel bad? I liked the fifth grade.
- Hey, girl!
- Miss Barnett had this ass so big-
This is my brother, Derek.
My bad, y'all have already met.
- Yeah, we're acquainted.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Oh, hell, no!
You're not going to introduce me?
Forget my name, your manners?
You don't need to know him.
Excuse me, you do need to know me.
Everybody needs to know me.
They call me Snook-G, from the CG.
And don't you forget it.
They call him Snookie, because "fool" was taken.
They call me Snook, the cootchie crook.
Chi-town, where ya at, girl?
What's your first class?
Okay, let's see that upper body.
Both legs, nice.
- Let's- The upper body.
- I can't. I know.
- I don't have an upper body.
- We go through this every day.
You need to work your upper body.
Go do some chin-ups.
Stacia, you're next. Kathy, spot her. Good. Point your toes.
That's it.
All right, Sara.
You're up.
I hate this class!
- Look at my hand!
- Girl, you are bleeding.
I hate her. She made me climb up to the very- well, not the very top.
Obviously.
Damn.
Ex-cuuse me!
Last time you said you would and you didn't.
Wait. Hold on, hold on.
Sara.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
How you get your leg to twist like that?
What's up with that double-jointed, cheerleader shit anyway?
Nothing's up with it. I just used to dance. Ballet, mostly.
Oh. So you should hit Stepps with us tomorrow night.
It's a club. You know, like mostly hip-hop.
It's sort of members only, you know what I'm saying?
Oh. I don't know.
- You should go.
- Yeah, Snook spins sometimes,
- so he might be able to get you in.
- Who?
Snook, she needs to get hooked up with Stepps, all the way hooked up.
- All right. Give him a twenty.
- For what?
I.D.
She thought she was getting in off your looks.
Ha! No, no.
Your girl is weak, all right?
I got my rep to watch.
I can't be getting any old toe-tapping, ass-shaking bandstand-
Snookie, you talk a lot of shit for someone who never says anything.
- Oh!
You gonna pay the man, or what?
- I don't know where it is.
- I'll give you my address.
We'll meet up, and we'll go together.
And I will have your I.D.
Stepps ain't no square dance.
That's all right. I dance in circles, probably around you.
- This girl's a joke, man.
- What? Break out.
Don't you got something to do?
Money to spend? All right.
Let's roll, girl.
Mm-mm-mmm!
Hey, girl.
Come in.
- So you found the place okay?
- Yeah, it was fine.
All right, I'm just gonna get my coat and then we'll be out.
Cool outfit.
Slammin'.
Slammin' outfit.
Oh.
Momma Dean?
I'm leaving.
I-I look okay, right?
Uh, yeah.
You look all right.
Momma Dean, Sara.
Sara, Mom, aka Momma Dean.
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?
And handsome here is Christopher.
Now don't get him all riled up, Chenille.
I'm gonna get me some sleep tonight.
- Glad to have met you.
- Bye.
I'll be home at 1:00 at the latest.
Is that- Is he yours?
He sure ain't
Momma Dean's.
- Here is your I.D.
- Thank you.
Chenille!
She's ugly! She's fat.
She's 21. Come on, girl, let's roll. I ain't got all night.
Wait, wait, I just have to ask you a question. Do I really look okay?
Yo, Lakisha, let me use your car.
I just want to sit in it for a minute.
- All right?
- All right.
- Come on.
- What? I-I thought-
- Get in. Let's go, let's go.
- Okay.
All right, you need to take off that fifth-grade, dance-looking top.
- It's from the Gap.
- It's country, and you look country in it.
Let's go.
You're going to put these on too.
What the hell am I going to do with this?
Oh. Come here, come here, come here.
- Thanks, girl.
- No problem.
Let's bounce.
-Yo, you got a pocket for this cash?
-Yeah.
Let's get to our table before it gets crashed and I hurt somebody.
What are you, some kind of V.I.P.?
No, Snook hooks me up when he spins.
Uh-huh.
Damn!
- Hey, hey. You got it. Got it.
- Got what?
What? The right to walk past your greasy, tickle-dick self...
- without your paws on my ass?
- Yeah. You got it.
That's how I got it?
That's how I thought
I had it. Come on, girl.
- Hey, what's up?
- We're in here.
Shawna! Sara, Shawna.
Shawna, Sara.
Hi, love.
So, this place is tight, right?
- It's so cool.
- What is up with this place?
Seems like they're letting anybody in.
And they started with you.
I'm Nikki.
Alyssa, Jasmin.
You know Diggy, right,
Marcia?
Sara.
It's Sara, actually.
I know you, though.
You're in my gym class, right?
- That don't mean you know me.
- Quit it, Nikki.
Quit what?
I ain't walking on eggshells... just 'cause you brought the Brady Bunch to the Negro club.
Maybe you came to the wrong spot,
'cause I'm pretty sure there aren't any Negroes here.
Doh!
I'm pretty sure you came with one.
Oh, no, wench.
You did not just call me a Negro!
- Y'all just chill, okay.
- Why don't you tell her to chill?
She the one that's always got something to say.
I could say a lot more.
You keep talking, Nikki,
I will lay all your shit bare.
Dang. Why you gotta burn her like that, Chenille?
'Cause I can't stand her ass and the way she played my brother.
Hey.
- Hi, what's up, D.!
- Hey, man.
- Let's dance.
- Let's not.
Oh, it's gonna be like that?
Well, how'd you think it was gonna be?
You was going to drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it?
I miss you.
Does this have to do with that fool from Northwestern dismissing you?
Ain't nobody dissed or dismissed me,
Derek. I laid him off.
Fired me?
You laid him off?
All you gotta do is find somebody to dance with and it'll be good.
- What's up? What did he say?
- He's trippin', come on.
Yo!
Excuse me!
- Wanna dance with me for a minute?
- Yeah.
- Catch you later, all right?
- All right.
What you drinking?
- I don't know. I'll have, um-
- That's him coming over.
- Who?
- Christopher's father.
Don't look, don't look.
Don't.
How you doing?
Why don't you ask how your son is doing?
That's a line you ain't tried in awhile.
Now why you got to jump off like that?
Why you gotta be like you are?
I thought you was coming to get Christopher on Sunday.
What happened?
You got amnesia?
Look, I'll take him next week.
I had to work on Sunday.
I ain't seen the fruits of that labor.
Come on, Chenille.
Chenille.
I mean, you know you want to dance with me.
That's why you came here- to yell at me and to dance with me.
Kenny, Sara.
Sara, Kenny.
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?
Rum and coke.
No ice.
Hey!
I know this little girl her name is Maxine
Her beauty is like a bunch of rose
If lever tell you 'bout Maxine
You only say I don't know
-What I know, but murder she wrote
-Forreal, forreal
Murder she wrote, Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote
Watch ya now it name a pretty face and bad character
Rum and coke, straight up, and a beer... anything.
That's a bad choice,
"anything."
It's just a beer.
Well, it should be the best beer.
But you'd know that if you even drank.
Whatever.
What's that mean?
"Whatever"?
Whatever you want it to mean.
You're the genius, right?
- You know everything.
- Not everything.
Like I don't know why we're still standing here.
I'm supposed to be dizzy by now, remember?
From all those circles you danced around me.
I don't feel like dancing right now.
- But you know how?
- Would I be here, if I didn't?
Let's do it then.
Come on.
Come on.
Cross, front.
Cross, front.
That's it.
That's it. You got it.
Cross, front.
Cross, front-
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Damn, Nikki.
She all up in your nut.
Uh-huh, up in your nut and cracking it.
What she doing?
Two-stepping?
I don't care what she's doing.
That bitch ain't got shit on me.
He's right there.
Don't be dealing in here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I tell you, don't sell in here!
Malakai, you hear me, man.
Y'all think it's a game, man?
Kai!
- Get up! Get up!
- All right, it's over. Chill.
- Get off!
- I'm all right.
Move, move.
Keep going.
Go, go, go, go, go.
I gotta find my brother.
Derek! Derek!
It's about to get real out here, y'all. Cops and shit, I'm gone.
All right, girl.
Derek!
Derek!
Yo, what the-
- Go.
- Come on, man, get in. Let's go.
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with you, Derek?
Look, I'm going to tell you like I've been telling you, you need to leave Malakai alone and let that scrub handle his own mess.
Chenille, scramble the CD. I ain't trying to hear all that shit.
You guys, I live like five blocks that way. I'm just going to go home.
-I'll see you later.
-No, not alone in this neighborhood.
There's too many little boys out here thinking they thugs.
- I'll walk you.
- No, don't worry about me.
- It's no problem.
- No, I said I'll walk you.
- Well, what about you?
- We live right around the corner.
- Well, I'll be home in a minute.
- All right.
So you was working it tonight, girl.
- Yeah, right, slammin'.
- Later.
Bye.
Come on, Braveheart.
Maybe you want to hook up sometime?
You know, after school?
Work on your moves, if you want.
Yeah, sure, if you want.
So how'd you like Stepps, once you got used to the music?
It wasn't the music that I had to get used to, Derek.
That's not the first time
I've heard hip-hop.
Uh-huh. I bet you listen to it all the time.
So are we getting any closer to your crib, or are we going to have to stop for food and water?
- We- We passed it.
- You passed it.
- Thank you for walking me home.
- Was that thanks like,
"Gee whiz, I had a great time," or was that thanks like,
"I'll bust a cap in your ass, if you ever darken my doorstep again"?
No, I would never bust a cap in your ass.
Oh.
Just checking.
So, uh, you're here. you're home.
I'll see ya.
See ya at school.
Okay.
See ya.
Thank you for the dance.
- Morning.
- You scared me.
I didn't know that you were home.
I didn't see your car outside.
Yeah, the night's full of surprises.
I had a big one myself when I came home on my break.
- Where were you, Sara?
- I was just out with some friends.
And I just missed some work. Half a night's worth. Hope you had fun.
I did.
I had a great time.
Yeah, look, you're 17 years old, if you wanna go out, go out.
But don't sneak around.
And on top of everything else, don't make me worry about you.
Oh, now you're worried about me?
Now that I'm old enough to take care of myself? Perfect timing, Roy.
You know, the rules about going out are very simple, Sara.
I wanna know where and when. And
I want you home at a decent hour.
- End of discussion.
- Fine, end of discussion. Relax.
All right, lesson one. See, hip-hop is more than just like a dance, it's more like-
Like an attitude, you know.
You gotta loosen up so you can feel them and let them flow through you.
-All right, so just stay right here.
Now, what is this?
Bring your feet out like this.
Put your feet forward.
Right, spread 'em, spread 'em.
- You all right, then?
- Yes.
Just hang loose.
Be strong, a tree, right?
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.
- Make that sound with me. Uhhh!
- Uhhh!
What, are you sitting down for tea or something?
Get up.
Boom. That's it.
Just chillin'.
You just do it.
Sit down.
Okay.
Now we're just going to walk. It's real simple. Just walk like this.
- Okay, now you try, you try.
- Okay.
Now just relax, let it be natural.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Dig into it more, the balls of your feet instead of your toes.
Bend your knees, bend your knees.
Just slouch a little bit, slouch.
Act like you're a nasty bitch.
All right, now watch.
Check it, check it, check it.
- Got that?
- Oh, it's come to head bobs?
Okay, it's the same beat, but then you split it up.
Freeze, freeze, freeze.
- Bounce, bounce.
- I am such a dork.
No, you're not.
Bounce.
- Now I'm cool.
- You're almost there.
Yeah, you got that.
Are you sure it's okay that we came here?
Well, it is now, but if we're going to keep on doing this, we're gonna have to find someplace else to practice.
Did you always want to be a doctor?
Who said I wanna be a doctor?
Chenille. Everybody.
Well, yeah, you know.
I wanna be a doctor, but I gotta get into college first.
What kind of doctor?
Pediatrician.
I like kids.
- Do you have any?
- No. Do you?
Oh, I didn't-
I wasn't trying to be smart, Derek.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Screw you,
I'm brilliant and cool.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Wow.
That was cute, that little thing you did. Can you show me again?
- What was that shit you just did?
- Rond dejambe attitude.
- Ballet. I used to dance.
- You used to dance?
Used to, as in don't anymore and no,
I don't want to talk about it.
So, is that why you brought up that rond dejambe attitude shit... because you don't want to talk about it?
It's really not a big deal.
I think it is.
This club was so slamming, Lindsay, the dancing. I'm gonna go again.
You are? Well, have you seen anybody get shot yet?
What? No, I didn't see anyone get shot yet.
God, I didn't move to Bosnia.
Well, I'm still going to pray for you.
Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking ghetto. Forget about the drive-bys, how are you supposed to meet anybody?
Um, well, I did actually meet somebody, I think.
I met this guy, and he's really cool.
-They got white guys at your school?
-Um... no, actually they don't.
Shut up! Look at me.
I want my money.
I don't have it.
Shut up!
Quit your crying, man.
I don't get paid till next week.
You wasn't saying that when you was smoking it.
-I don't have it!
-Well, you better find it somewhere.
- This ain't no layaway plan.
- Hey! Hey, stop it!
Come here. Where do you think you're going, huh?
Aahh!
Bitch!
You ain't seen nothing, so don't say nothing... to nobody.
I stole a bike here once.
- Why'd you do that?
- 'Cause I didn't have one.
- Oh, okay. Good reason.
- Well, it's not a reason, you know,
I used to do shit like that, you know- wild shit.
- With Malakai?
- Yeah.
I don't get you two.
You seem so different.
- We're not.
- I think you are.
I mean, come on,
Malakai's scary. Very scary.
What you mean by scary?
Kai's tough, he has to be.
But he's still got a good heart. I know.
Maybe you only think you know.
Look, Malakai may not be the boy next door, but he's still my boy.
He does some shit that I'm not down with sometimes, but I ain't never going to cross him off and be like everybody else.
So, you're not down with the stuff he does, but you are down with him?
- That makes sense. I understand.
- He's my friend, Sara.
You don't have to understand.
Listen, me and him got into some shit awhile back- some bad shit.
Broke into a liquor store and cracked open the cash register.
Somebody peeped us and called five-0, and we barely made it out of the store.
The cops were on our asses. We split up and ran in different directions.
Now, I must have been going in the wrong direction, because the cops were closing in on me.
So, Malakai, he smashed in some car windows, set off the alarms... and turned the heat from me to him.
I kept running, and he got caught.
The DA offered him everything but a Rolls Royce to turn my name in.
But he didn't, and he never will.
I stole a hat once, when I was 12.
But my Mom found it and made me give it back.
Gangsta Sara stole a hat.
Call the F.B.I.
Are you gonna turn me in?
I think I'll wait for you to surrender.
So, you get along with your mom?
You know, you all tight and shit?
Yeah. We got along, tight and shit.
-How come you never talk about her?
-'Cause there's nothing to say.
It's because you don't talk about her.
What do you want me to do?
I don't know, just say something about her.
I mean, you don't say anything about her.
Well, she's dead. God, what do you want me to do,
-run through the streets screaming?
-If it helps.
Well, it won't, so drop it.
Didn't mean to press you about your mom.
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
Get along with your dad?
Y'all tight and shit?
Yeah, we're both tight and shit. Our DNA matches.
- What is this place?
- Well, in a few months, it'll be Club Med for the homeless, but right now... just an old furniture spot
I used to work at last summer.
Hop, step, back. Okay?
Real simple, do it with me, right?
- Hop, step, back. Got that?
Try it one more time. Add on the next part after that, all right?
Six, seven, eight.
Step, back, break, spin, out, up, step.
Chilly on that?
One more time.
Okay, on this part?
It's like we're battling, right?
It's like a challenge.
When I step forward like this, you have to challenge me back into my space, and I challenge you back in your space, like this.
So, it's back, front, back, front, back, front, like that, that kinda feel.
Step, back, forth, back.
Wait, wait. You're making me dizzy. Stop, stop.
Sit on it, sit on it.
Stick your ass out.
- Do it.
Okay, okay. How am I doing?
How's my butt?
It's nice. I mean, it's good.
Thank you.
You made that? It’s really nice.
It's Tanisha's.
That girl's gonna pay my way through design school.
What about your mom?
Where is she?
She was in jail... for drugs.
For things women do for drugs.
She got out and took off.
Well, maybe she'll come back.
That is what Derek used to say when we were little, when Momma Dean used to piss us off.
But he grew up.
He grew out of it.
You like Derek, don't you?
No. No.
Wooo! Yeah! I got it!
Yo! What's the deal?
What's going on in there?
- Wh-What's going on?
Dr. Reynolds in the house.
You know what I'm saying?
- What? What?
- Check it out. Check it out.
Georgetown! It's Georgetown!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Really exciting.
- Thank you.
Whoo! Gimme some love.
Give it up.
Are you going to tell me where we're going?
- No.
- Why is this a surprise for me?
You're the one with something to celebrate.
- We can celebrate together.
- Okay.
We have an audience.
Work with me.
I can tell
I can tell you want it
Do you well
Baby, I know, I know
Girl, I'm so into you
Let's do what you want to do
I can tell
I can tell you want me
So much flavor I can't lie would be nice
Girl, if you would spend the night by my side
Oh, my God.
There's more for you to see
'Cause I want you like you want me
- Tonight we'll go on and on
- Feeling strong
Let's make love to the break of dawn
That lady was freaking out.
- I know it.
- She was really losing it.
- I'm so excited for you.
- Thank you.
- Are you nervous about Georgetown?
- No.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
I-I can't go in there.
What do you mean? This is where
I'm taking you, the ballet.
I know, but-
But what?
Nothing.
- Nothing. Never mind.
- Come on.
I thought you would like it.
- I did.
- You ain't acting like it.
I'm sorry.
I don't want you to think that I didn't have a good time. I did.
It's just... ballet is not a part of my life anymore.
I don't understand.
What happened?
You just woke up one morning and decided to waste your talent?
How do you know I have talent?
'Cause you saw me do some leg trick?
I saw the look on your face when you did it.
The same as I saw tonight- goofy, happy.
So, if you're gonna tell me something about not dancing, at least tell me something real.
Well, what if
I don't want it to be real?
What I want is to wake up and see my mom again; for things to go back to the way when my life made sense.
But that's not gonna happen, and it's all my fault.
- All of it.
- What's your fault?
My mom, the accident, the fact that she's dead.
She got scraped off some highway because of me... because of my stupid audition.
Because she was rushing because
I made her promise to come.
And when they called my name,
I was mad at her because- because I needed her to be there and she wasn't.
She was dying while I was dancing, and I was mad at her.
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Listen.
It is not your fault that she died... or that she was rushing.
She cared about you.
She just wanted to be there for you.
That's what makes it so bad. She always wanted what was right for me.
I wanted to be the prima ballerina.
I had to be.
And I didn't care if it took all of her money and all of her spare time.
It was my stupid audition and my stupid dream, and it killed her.
And all she wanted was for it to come true.
I bet she would still want it to come true.
She wouldn't want you to give that up.
I know. I just- I don't think that
I can do it without her.
What do you want?
Do you wanna do it,
Sara?
I mean you.
Do you want Juilliard?
- Yes.
- All right.
Then, it's on you.
You're the one that's gonna have to make it happen.
You're the one that's gonna have to make the dream come true.
So, I'll see you tomorrow?
Yeah.
I promise not to have a nervous breakdown.
Good night.
Good night.

I called Juilliard for an application.
They're holding auditions in Chicago next month.
Next month. That's cool.
I'm out of shape, and it hurts.
If that's what you call out of shape, what does it take to get you in shape?
- Practice.
- Okay, jog around the room, then.
Do some push-ups.
I'll sit here, and I'm gonna watch.
That's not how
I get into shape.
- Stretch the leg.
That's it.
Now shoulders down.
And bring the hip down as you go.
And stretch through the toes.
Don't wait.
And finish.
Good.
You know,
I'm okay with the ballet part, but I need help with my free form.

No, it was- You were dancing with
Snookie, I was dancing with Nikki.
The music was going and-
I thought we were having a good time.
Please, girlfriend don't start nothin'
Look. There's nothing between me and Nikki anymore.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
And I ain't gonna ask who smashed the E-Class
Sara, I would never do anything to hurt you.
I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
Let me know if this right here is something you can have for years
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.
Let me know if this right here is something you can have for years
This is it.
This is where I live.
This is my dad's music room.
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.
He's actually pretty good if you like jazz.
No.
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.
Huh.
And this is our living room.
- It's not anything special.
- It's all right.
I see your true colors shining through
My dad's gonna fix that.
It's kind of messy in there.
True colors and that's why
I love you
- Do you wanna see my room?
- Uh, yeah.
- This is it. I sleep on the couch.
There's a bed underneath, but it gets stuck, and my dad says he's gonna fix it, but I don't know.
He's, um, at work right now.
He'll... be gone all night.
Yeah, um-
I see your true colors
- Shining through
- Straight up
I see your true colors
That's why I love you
I see your true colors
I'd sleep in a dresser too if I had six brothers to sleep with.
Hey, fellas, what's up?
- Look at this stud.
- What's up, man?
Hey, playah.
How you doin', man?
Whas sup, baby?
Oh, no love. No love.
I hear you been traveling in new circles. What's up with that?
- You tappin' that white girl?
That's why you ain't got more time for your boys? Too busy fronting?
Too busy snow flaking. If that's the case, you best be watching your back.
'Cause white women don't bring nothin' but trouble.
That ain't white women, man.
That's women.
- That's your women.
- Yo, are we gonna check out... some honeys on the west side?
- You riding?
- Hell, no.
This ain't about no honeys.
I know what it's about.
Those fools we stomped at Stepps hit my corner four strong last week.
- I gotta handle myself.
- You slide out that side of town,
- they gonna handle you.
- They can bring it. I got my heat.
All that gat's gonna do is create some unnecessary mayhem, man.
That's the black man's life-
- madness and mayhem.
- How do you know?
You just got out of juvee, and now you're talking about... going out there trying to start some more shit?
- That shit ain't funny.
You act like you don't know who you are anymore, Derek.
And what's up out there for anybody who ain't you?
I'm still from this neighborhood, but you?
I guess that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.
- Or gives you some.
- Shut up, Lip.
Sorry.
I know what's out there.
Ain't like you can't get past it, but you're too busy getting in your own way to see that.
I had some help getting in my own way, didn't I?
Hey, was sup?
What the hell was that?
I was trying to block the ball.
Stupid bitch!
Good going, Sara!
Get off! That's it!
Nikki, back off!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!
- I like that!
- What is this shit?
- Malakai? Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, man.
Any body catch one?
It ain't over, bitch.
I don't even know why it started, bitch.
'Cause you always in my way.
I'm only in your way when it comes to Derek. That's what this is about.
No, it's about you.
White girls like you.
Creepin' up, takin' our men.
The whole world ain't enough, you got to conquer ours too.
Whatever, Nikki.
Derek and I like each other, and if you have a problem with that, screw you.
I'll get it.
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Oh, hi.
- Shit!
- I'm okay.
- Wait. Let me see.
I'm really okay.
I'm fine.
Well, what did she do?
Um, now is really not a good time to talk.
- Okay. Well-
- I'll call you.
Oh, no.
Here, let me see.
- Here.
- God, that stinks.
Yeah, but it's gonna keep your face from swelling up like a pumpkin.
Hold it. Here.
Hold it on there.
It was midnight at the party
So, whatcha gonna do?
As you walk in looking nice
It's payback time.
Either you down or you not.
Either you my boy or you ain't.
Simple as that.
Oh, ha! Hey, baby, we lit it up out there.
I am serious.
Did you see us, "D" man?
Do you see us?
We're talking.
Anyway. Hey, baby, we lit it up.
- Oh, man, come on, man!
- That shit ain't funny, man.
- You damn right it ain't funny.
- It hought you liked it down there.
That's your specialty, ain't it?
Crawling on the floor like a bitch.
That was a reflex action in the heat of the moment.
You're just plain rude and wrong to bring that shit up in mixed company.
- I'm gonna go home. Are you ready?
- No, he's not ready.
He's talking to me.
It's an "A" and "B" conversation.
- You gotta go? See yourself home.
- Fuck you!
- Bitch, I'm gonna-
- What the hell is your problem?
You seem to lie about all the things you're gonna do
You gonna take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine?
- 'Cause you wrong, Malakai.
- No, you're wrong.
You been wrong.
You ain't even worth shit no more.
Get outta my face, college boy, and take that trailer trash ho with you.
Little shorts like rubber
Heads bounce like fubber
See your mind's in the gutter
Wanna bag another lover
No way, now that I'm blowin ' the spots, you're afer me like
"Hey, Kool-Aid'"
All you get is shade, You think
I'm gonna back up the Brinks
From the Miller's

End of conversation, Move around

I ain't got no time for no sillyho
There was the blow of Arsenio and be all up in my video
You're not lying about what you're doing
I'll trade that ass like Patrick
Ewing, so you better come at me
Honey, his blue pajamas are at the bottom of the bag.
If it's as cold as it was today, put those on him.
Hey, whatcha all doing with my nephew here? Come on now.
There we go.
It's okay. It's okay.
- What's wrong with him?
- He don't know you, Kenny.
I'm his father, he knows me.
What should I do?
- Come around more often.
- See, I can't talk to you.
And I can't depend on you.
- Shh.
What do you think I use to raise this baby, oxygen?
He has needs, Kenny, and his needs require money.
- Here we go.
- And we're gonna keep going... until I get what I need from you to raise your son.
I'm doing the best that I can.
But do you think your mouth helps the situation?
I'm just trying to deal with this shit. I didn't ask for this.
What, and I did?
I climbed on top of myself and got pregnant?
You want me to take him to my mother's?
I'll take him.
Get his shit ready. Get him ready!
Oh, no. You're not going nowhere with my son tonight.
Not on that temper, and not with that attitude.
Look, you know what? Fine. Then,
I won't take him. I'm outta here.
Go ahead, leave.
That's what you're good at!
Your son ain't seen nothing but your back since he was born!
Shawana Clarke.
Do you want me to take him?
No.
Travis, come here.
Come here, Travis.
Travis, put that down.
Excuse me. I have been here for an hour and a half.
Am I gonna be able to see a doctor anytime soon?
I've already told you, we'll get you in as soon as we can.
My appointment was an hour ago.
I already got here early.
We are doing the best we can.
We have a lot of people.
Is there somebody else I can talk to?
Wench. I gotta stand over her... to make sure she puts your name on the damn list.
Triflin' bitch.
Okay. Ooo-kay.
Yeah. Da da da da da da da da.
- I'll get that.
Da da!
I know. I know.
I know. I know.
So, your dad's trippin' about the fight.
-Yeah.
-Probably thinks it's Derek's fault.
No, I explained about Nikki.
So, you put it all on her.
None of it's on you.
She started it.
I told you what she said.
Maybe she didn't have no business getting up in your face, but she had reason to say what she said.
Wait a minute.
You agree with her?
You and Derek act like it don't bother people to see you together.
Like it don't hurt people to see.
Well, we like each other.
What is the big damn deal? It's me and him, not us and other people.
Black people, Sara.
Black women.
Derek's about something.
He's smart. He's motivated.
He's for real.
He's not gonna make babies and not take care of them, or run the streets messing up his life.
He's gonna make something of himself. And here you come- white, so you gotta be right- and take one of the few... decent men we have left after jail, drugs and drive-by.
That is what Nikki meant about you up in our world.
There's only one world,
Chenille.
That is what they teach you.
We know different.
I-I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
You wanna be a friend?
Don't just be here to be here.
Open up your pretty brown eyes and look the hell around.
Excuse me.
Come on, Sara, this is for your audition.
Come on. No, no, no.
You're not attacking it.
You're not working it, okay?
Come on now.
I'll get it right the next time.
You don't have time.
You gotta get it right now.
- I can't work like this.
- Like what?
Like this, with you dictating to me.
All right.
Let's take a break.
I'm sorry. It's just that the audition's next week, and everything is so messed up at school.
I don't know. I'm feeling a little bit weird.
You know everything's going to be okay.
I feel it.
So, you pick out a dress yet?
Dress?
Yeah, you know, girls wear those sometimes.
Stepps.
Main Squeeze Night.
Couples only Saturday night.
We already talked about this, remember?
Yeah.
We talked about it, but I didn't know we decided on it.
Well, it's Stepps.
What is there to decide on it?
I don't know. I just thought that with the fight and everything... that maybe we should cool it for a little while.
What?
Well, uh, what are you saying?
Are you saying that you don't wanna be with me?
You don't wanna be seen with me?
What are you saying?
I'm just saying
I'm confused, that's all.
Confused about what?
Me?
A little bit.
I don't know.
Yeah... no... maybe.
Maybe?
So, hold on. What? Are we talking about Stepps and school, or are you talking about the grocery store, the sidewalk and museums?
Break it down a little bit better for me, 'cause I don't get it.
When is it okay for us to be together? To be seen together?
Why are you getting mad?
I'm just being honest.
Nobody wants to see us together.
We spend more time defending our relationship than having one.
It's just... so hard.
Everything's gotta be easy? That's the story of your life, not mine.
You know this much about my life.
I know when shit gets rough, you give up and punk out.
Just the way you punked out on ballet when your mom died.
You don't know shit about my mother.
How dare you talk about my mom!
God!
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
It's just that... all this shit just kind of caught me off guard.
I mean, it's, like, damn, you don't wanna be with me.
Is that what you're saying, that you don't want to be with me?
No, it's not like that.
I'm trying to tell you how I feel, and you're taking it personal.
Let me tell you something, Sara.
I just hit the best friend I have in the world in the face over you.
I've been taking shit from people I've known all my life.
People I care about, that care about me so I could be with you.
Telling myself that we are in this together.
So, don't give me this "nothing personal." I don't wanna hear it.
Fine. If I'm messing up your life so much, then maybe we shouldn't be together.
You know what?
I don't need this shit.
I don't even know why I bother.
I'm out.
The hell with it.
The hell with you.
I don't know what I'm doing
See, baby, I apologize
For all the things that I've done that I've done
See, I know that I've been a fool
For far too long, oh
And maybe you'll have a rumor on the way
That comes back, Papa
Please baby, baby, stay
If you really love me then why are you leaving me
I can't think
- Hey, man.
Uh, you know, about the other night.
I don't want there to be-
Don't even worry about it, man.
My jaw's not made out of glass.
Yeah, well, you know, blood's thicker than blonds, right?
So, you got my back on Saturday?
Derek... I ain't got nobody else, man.
- You got Lip.
- Lip?
Man, that fool will get a nigger killed quick, man.
No, I need you there.
47th Street, under the El.
I'll call you, man.
Are you down?
- Yeah, I'm down.
- All right, man.
Let me get to class, get some education like you.
All right.
I don't care about how much that you got
'Cause your cigs, your lips your jigs don't ever start it
Oh, you're just another
Undercover poser, loser
Acting like a boy
So, if you got dough, lain't hearing you got a bad Joe
But lain't hearing that bona fide code, That ain't good enough
'Cause you ain't no-o-o-o
Ain't no place in the game
Ain't no way that children play
Uh...
I don't wanna bug you. I just came in here to say good luck.
So, tomorrow's the big day, huh?
Yeah.
- You scared?
- Shitless.
You got a minute for your old man?
I wanna show you something.
Sure.
Be careful.
That wall, it's, uh, still wet.
That's your mother when she was 19, when I first met her.
I know.
It's just a start. I mean, I know you're too old for a twin bed.
It's a nice bed, Roy.
You know, I-I didn't mean to mess up your life.
Or your mother's.
And I don't deserve a second chance to be your father, but I'm hoping you'll give me one anyway.
You know, way back when...
I thought I had all the time in the world to get to know you, for you to get to know me.
But... one day... wake up, you look around.
All you got to show for yourself is a... beautiful, talented, little girl.
Young woman... who hates you.
I don't hate you.
I miss her.
I miss her so much.
God, everything is so screwed up.
Derek is mad at me.
He's not gonna come tomorrow.
I want him to be there.
I need him to be there.
I just want someone there who loves me.
I love you.
Whoa! Hey.
Why are you so quiet?
I don't feel like talking.
Derek, there's something
I oughta tell you.
I said something to Sara.
What?
What did you say?
Stuff.
About how maybe Nikki had a point about black men and white women.
What?
You said what?
I'm sorry.
I-I don't even like Nikki.
I was trippin' off Kenny.
You can't help who you love, Derek.
You're not supposed to.
When you love somebody, you love them.
Look at me.
At least you found somebody who loves you back.
I gotta go.
Where you going?
Stay out of my business,
Chenille.
I know what Malakai wants you to do.
Why are you trippin' off him, Derek?
All you're trying to do is get the hell up out of here.
Ain't no shame or blame in that.
It's getting cold out here.
Take that baby inside.
Hey.
Kai, I've been trying to catch up with you.
I gotta talk to you.
- Ready to roll?
- I gotta talk to you.
- Wassup?
- Look, man. I ain't going with you.
What you mean you're not going?
-You know what I mean.
-Did you come here to waste my time?
This shit is nonsense, Kai.
It's dangerous nonsense.
Just back up off it, man. Come on.
I'll go with you if you go home.
Go home? Get the hell away from me, you punk-ass bitch.
You're the one don't have the balls. to walk away from this shit.
I should have took your ass to jail along with mine, man.
But you didn't, so you do not have to get in that car.
Malakai, you are so much smarter than this shit.
I know what you can be.
I know what you're capable of.
Let's just walk away.
Walk away to what?
I'm not you, Derek.
I can't do nothing but what I'm doing.
I can't go to Georgetown with a 10.0 G.P.A., operating on people, doing brain surgery...
- or whatever you're gonna be doing.
- You can, man.
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- All I have is my respect.
And that's what I gotta go take care of.
You wanna bail out on me, man? That's fine.
But you can kiss my ass with all your future bullshit.
I know who the hell I am... right now.
Kai, man, wait, man.
Let's go, man.
Sara?
Ready to go?
Um-
Yes. Yes.
Sara!
Sara Johnson?
Aah!
Miss Johnson, we meet again.
I assume you prepared a contemporary piece.
Yes, sir. They have my music.
Hold it. Hold it. Cut the music.
I'm sorry, sir.
I wasn't ready.
Are you ready now?
Yes, sir, she's ready!
Youngman, excuse me.
This is an audition.
Who let him in here?
How did he get in here?
He's not supposed to be there.
- Youngman!
- You can do this.
- I messed up. It's too late.
- It is not too late.
- Miss Johnson.
- You can do it.
- Sara, you were born to do it.
- That judge hates me.
- Forget him.
Ain't nobody watching you but me.
All right?
Now show me some attitude.
Miss Johnson, we don't have time for this.
Are you ready to continue?
- Miss Johnson!
- I'm ready.

[mingled voices]
Man on radio: God does not suffer. He doesn't feel pain.
He is not a courageous God.
Human beings can be courageous or cowardly.
Neither of these things is in God's nature.
Will man destroy the earth to move on?
Is that his Destiny?
Ask yourself a question, people--
Are you humble before God?
[the Magokoro brothers'
"my back pages" plays]
...Believe in the one true God.
Ezekiel saw the wheel, but what kind of wheel?
The cigar-shaped hubcap from the Sky?
Are these the gods that created mankind?
People, there are many gods.
It is written in the bible that there are many gods.
Does the bible lie?
These gods left before the bible was written.
Would you swear on a bible?
I'd swear on a bible.
A book of treachery and murder and genocide.
Of course I'd swear on that, and I'll tell you why.
The false Christianity you subscribe to
Is nothing more than the cult of the virgin.
People, it's time to evaluate and reflect on your lives.
God has turned his back on this nation.
Think about it.
What did Martin Luther King get out of the whole thing?
A boulevard?
[siren wails]
Sweetheart:
It's the dark princes,
The democrats and republicans,
Working for a barbarian
That can scarcely spell his own name.
Hey, the only thing more pleasant than seeing you
Would be seeing the grim reaper himself.
You gentlemen are about to make a hideous choice.
You two are pitiable figures, weeping with blood,
And it's going to be your own blood.
Are you aware, gentlemen, that this is all a play?
We don't want paper money.
We want gold and silver.
Okay, listen.
Uncle sweetheart is organizing a benefit concert...
A benefit concert
To help the real victims of this revolution,
However,
I will be personally siphoning the majority of the funds
Into the kitty of the fattest cat of all,
Me,
And you gentlemen will be paid in full.
When?
Definitely in this lifetime.
Look, you got the money or not?
I understand you're not accustomed
To staring into the face of God.
Shut up.
I can't.
As long as I keep talking,
I know I'm still alive.
There's no use talking to you, huh?
Yeah, ain't no point in listening, neither.
I'm not going to debate semantics with you.
Look, it's real.
It's beyond phenomena.
They're shooting and killing.
I mean, how do you define war in this day and age?
What are they fighting about?
I don't know what they're fighting about.
I mean, do the Hindus,
Arabs, Jews, Irish,
Muslims, Buddhists
Know what they're fighting about?
The last person who actually knew that
Was killed a long time ago.
They're all religious wars.
Look, we've got dead aliens
Stacked up in warehouses.
What else do you want to know?
We're talking about a war with no technological spin-off.
It's an uneasy puzzle to solve, gentlemen.
So why a benefit concert?
Well, how else do you get rock stars
To do television, huh?
You either give them a cause or you give them an award. Hmm?
What happened to you?
What happened to me?
How far back you want to go?
So where's my headliner, huh?
I just got off the phone with the network.
They want something to promote.
They need something to promote.
They have some questions about your ability
To perform services due.
And I suppose you told them
I was a total show biz stud.
That you have total mystical knowledge
And Faith in me,
And absolutely no question
About my ability to perform services due.
Yeah, yeah. Something like that.
So who are we getting, huh?
We getting any important people?
You know, headliners?
Top-of-the-line performers?
Maybe. Could be.
You never know.
Should I believe you?
Of course.
Yeah?
So, now tell me,
Are we screwed,
Or are we not screwed?
Oh, I'm not.
Are you?
I don't think you are getting screwed.
That's your problem.
Yeah, yeah.
I can't believe
You're going to turn this disaster
Into a seduction.
This place bugged?
Uncle sweetheart,
We're fighting a war here,
In case you didn't know.
War? Don't tell me about war.
I fought in the granddaddy of all wars,
The war to end all wars.
The one to rip your heart out.
Look, honey...Honey,
I'm on your side.
My side?
Everyone I've ever met,
I can look in the eye
And tell what side he's on,
So let's stop the spiffy chatter.
I'm on my way to a meeting
At the network.
They have a much greater reach and resonance
Than even they themselves might suspect.
Well, for the love of humanity, we must limit their power.
Ha ha. You don't take any of this seriously.
Yes, I do. Look at me, being all serious.
Hmm.
No, look.
No, wait a minute, here's the thing.
I don't think sting or Springsteen
Or Billy Joel or McCartney
Is going to work out,
But, but, but...
I have a surprise for you.
I don't understand what just happened here.
Where are the headliners?
The big waves, big names, superstars?
Well, what's to understand?
There's nothing to understand.
They're not here, they're not coming.
Do you mean to tell me
After all this time,
We wind up with Jack fate?
Jack nobody is more like it.
He was over before he started.
Are you finished?
We're all finished.
You know, ultimately,
We didn't have the money in the budget
To attract a big name.
You said we did.
Yeah, well, then, I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
Something is starting to smell here.
Something is giving off a very bad odor,
And these fumes are starting to choke me.
We can do some very ugly things.
I could have you killed right now
For the price of a cup of coffee,
And everybody in this room
Would turn the other way.
Hey, can we stop kidding around here, now?
I think we should pull the plug.
Plug?
There's no plug.
You show me a plug,
I'll pull it.
There's no plug, there's no socket,
There's no wall.
If I'm going down,
I'm taking the wall with me.
[laughs]
By the way, Jack fate,
He isn't a blood relative, is he?
Shut up, valentine.
You think you're going to get off cheap
With Jack fate...
But believe me, the price will be steep,
And one more thing.
If you want to suffer agony for someone else's happiness,
Do it on your own time.
Now, go away.
Fate!
Fate!
You're getting out,
Jack.
Somebody sprung you.
Must be my lucky day.
Who'd have done that?
Some angels must have intervened on your behalf.
Maybe a bunch of people put their savings together.
Hell, I don't know.
Haven't felt free in a long time.
Keeping people from being free
Is big business.
I'll keep it in mind.
Open it up!
[door buzzes]
Hey, Jack. Jack...
Where you going?
Roswell.
You don't seem to understand.
When they heard
Jack fate's name mentioned,
There was complete silence.
Like reverence.
Like prayer.
Yeah.
I was doing the praying.
They wanted to cancel the whole thing.
Don't they understand who Jack fate is?
Nobody knows who
Jack fate is anymore.
Nobody cares.
I mean, he doesn't make records.
He doesn't go on tour.
He doesn't do interviews.
He doesn't do anything.
He doesn't have to.
He's a legend.
Does Jesus have to walk on water twice
To make a point?
Besides, he's virtually free.
Who else can you say that about?
Virtually free?
No one is virtually free.
You're either free or you're not free.
You know, if he's going to play this concert,
Then he's going to play exactly what we tell him.
[Articolo 31's
"like a rolling Stone" plays]
Hey, prospero.
What's happening, man?
You missed it.
Two eagles just killed a pregnant rabbit.
Hmm.
Rabbit must have done something.
Leaving town?
Yeah.
Oh.
By choice this time?
Not really.
Nothing ever really is.
Where you heading?
That way.
That's a good direction.
I've done that a lot.
One of my favorites.
You know what else is good?
That way.
Maybe next time.
Think there's going to be a next time?
For you, maybe.
[horn blares]
So, you ever coming back?
I did come back.
%% how does it feel? %%
This bus going across the border?
No, sir, you're going the wrong way.
All right.
%% with no direction home %%
[singing continues in Spanish]
%% like a complete unknown %%
%% like a rolling Stone %%
What are you drinking?
What am I drinking?
I'm drinking my life away.
Why? You want some?
Make you forget that you're poor.
Yeah, but I'm not going to have any.
So what's up?
"what's up?"
Isn't that an interesting question to ask me?
I've got reporters wounded.
I've got reporters that are held captive,
Held hostage.
I've got two reporters dead.
I've got reporters on the front lines.
I've got reporters that are, uh...
Undercover with the insurgents,
With the counter-insurgents.
I've got people inside the capitol,
Even in the office of the president himself.
Yeah, I've done all that.
Yeah, you've done all that,
And people are still dying out there, my friend.
Everybody's doing the killing now.
Everybody's doing the dying.
Where does that leave you?
Are you still a journalist, or are you a novelist?
Same thing out here.
So, what's this all about, huh?
I've got things to do.
I've got my awards,
I've got my scars.
I've got nothing to prove to you.
You'll never change.
There's a benefit concert.
A benefit concert?
For medical relief.
It's going to be broadcast on the network.
Government controls the network.
I just want to make sure
It's not a pr thing,
That they're not trying
To make themselves look compassionate,
Or that it's not some kind of a set-up
Or a nefarious ploy to weed out the rebels...
[air raid siren wails]
But I will tell you this.
There is a story there.
That's no story.
That's no story.
That's every story.
That is the story.
Make something out of it,
And if you can't do that, sir,
Then make it up.
How much time do I have to do this?
I don't have a lot of time.
Jesus Christ, man.
You don't have a lot of time?
Abraham Lincoln...
Listen to me.
Abraham Lincoln gave the famed Gettysburg address
In five minutes.
Five. So don't ever talk to me about time.
There's...
Something else.
Only one performer.
Only one?
Yeah. One.
Try that on.
You don't need more than that performer.
Okay. I changed my mind.
About what?
About what?
About everything.
Everything?
Every...Thing.
Enjoy it,
Because this is your last shot.
[praying softly in Spanish]
Arise, o Lord. Save me.
Arise, o Lord. Save me.
Arise, o Lord. Save me.
[door opens]
What's the matter?
You look disturbed.
Yeah,
Because there's always something the matter,
Right?
I don't want there to be.
You don't understand.
You can't stay honest out there anymore.
[thump]
Shit.
Why? What's changed?
I'm going to be gone for a couple of days.
Maybe you shouldn't be here when I get back.
Where are you going?
I want to go.
Don't we always have a good time?
Yeah, good times don't last long.
You're making everything so tragic.
Tragic?
I'm not making it tragic.
Every period in history
Has been more or less tragic.
I don't know what you're saying.
Don't you read the paper?
The pervert's going to be the top man now.
The man of the hour.
Tommy,
If you had to kill somebody, how will you do it?
With a gun or with a knife?
With my bare hands.
Look,
It's an overcrowded world.
It's hard to get to the top.
There's a long line at the elevator.
Doesn't matter.
We'll take the stairs.
Let me go with you.
%% you must leave now %%
%% take what you need %%

%% whatever you wish to keep you'd better grab it fast... %%
I come from a small village in the mountains.
We don't even have a doctor,
So I joined the rebels.
I didn't know what the answers were.
I still don't.
I just knew you had to take sides.
I suffered sickness and wounds.
My whole family turned against me.
They disowned me.
I tried to explain, but...
But they just wouldn't listen to me.
Pretty soon,
I saw the rebel movement was corrupt.
The leadership were lying to the people.
They wanted to replace the old government
With a new government which was just as bad.
They were taking people's money.
They were making promises
With no intentions of keeping them,
And then a small army of counter-revolutionaries
Battled the rebels in the mountains
Where the government forces weren't effective.
I changed sides.
No one ever noticed.
This new movement was fighting for the truth
The rebels supposedly believed in
But really didn't,
And then I realized
That this movement was being funded
By the very government
I wanted to topple.
At that point,
I realized I didn't want the government to fall.
It would only be replaced with anarchy.
I started believing in preserving the republic,
So I joined the government forces.
I fought bravely for the cause,
And then one day,
We wiped out a small village.
They told us something
About the rebels having infiltrated.
It was a lie.
All the men were either dead or old...
And there...
And there was nothing but women and children left.
We...We...
It was my village.
And, uh...
Sometimes when I dream,
My dreams become my reality,
And I wish
I could live in my dreams.
Do you ever dream?
Yeah, I dream.
My dreams are walking through fire.
Intense heat.
I don't pay any attention to my dreams.
Does he know about the concert?
Of course not.
Shouldn't we tell him?
Of course not.
Did you hear who the headliner is?
Look, I like Beethoven.
Stravinsky.
Chopin's really good.
Modern music doesn't do much for me.
Quite frankly,
It doesn't do much for the president, either.
At least it's not some banjo player.
Anything we should do?
If they would have gotten a big star
To headline the concert,
We might have had to take action,
You know,
But they didn't get a big star.
Big stars think it's too dangerous here.
Big stars, you know, they like doing benefits,
But only if the benefits
Are held in places
Where they won't get shot at.
Oh, man.
Let me ask you.
You ever met any big stars
With a set of nuts?
With any big balls?
Any goddamn brains or charisma? Huh?
My man, big stars, they like...
They like it safe.
They don't like to put their life on the line
For a cause they don't understand.
I mean, who does, huh?
What do you want to do about Jack fate?
Nothing.
Hey, Jack fate doesn't understand anything.
Besides, he ain't a big star.
What's going on?
Who are those guys?
They're the, uh...
They're the counter- revolutionaries.
They've stopped the bus.
What do they want with the bus?
Anything they can get their hands on.
They might just harass us,
They might let us go, they might...Kill us,
They might make us join them.
They might drug us.
I don't know.
You know, it's...
Violence is the only thing they know.
It's the only tool in their box,
And you can't build a house
With one tool.
I've got a tool too.
Hey!
[gunfire]
They have no ideology.
They push both
Jesus and Judas aside.

Jack:
Once he was a real father,
Full of love, compassion, and forgiveness.
That didn't last too long.
After a while,
Being a father didn't amount to more than an official title.
He sacrificed everything he ever wanted
To reach his Destiny,
To rule this empire with an iron fist.
From the cathouses and gambling joints,
He Rose to the top rung of civilization,
President of this godforsaken nation.
Hey, do I need to ring a bell
To get a refill?
You see, my glass is empty.
[thunder rumbles]
Yeah,
The glass is always empty.
So is the spot on the counter
Where the money's supposed to be.
Tell me, who in the hell
Is presiding over this slaughterhouse, huh?
You or me?
Look, tough guy.
You want the world to be flat?
It's flat.
You want it to be round?
It can be round.
You son of a bitch.
[phone rings]
I know some things too.
Yeah, the more you know, the more you'll suffer.
You've got that right.
Hello?
What? Jack?
How am I doing?
Man, I didn't think
I'd ever hear from you again
After that night.
I thought that--
No, I'll leave now.
I'll be there by morning.
Is this for real?
I'm on my way.
Hey, man, no hard feelings,
But I'm sure the next Guy that serves you a drink
Is probably going to draw the same conclusions.
It's on the house.
He's not here.
How do you know?
Because
I don't see him.
How do you know he's not like Claude rains
In that movie the invisible man?
Who?
He doesn't show up,
You'd better get invisible.
[Francesco de Gregori's
"if you see her, say hello" plays]
This place looks familiar.
I think I stayed here before.
Well, welcome back.
Your pen's still out of ink.
Not a problem, sir.
You here for the concert?
Yeah, isn't everybody?
Oh yeah.
Will you be in need of a woman, sir?
What kind of woman?
We've got all kinds.
Slave women, immigrant women,
Black women, white women, young women, old women,
Rich, poor, middle-class, free women,
Western women, northern women,
Southern women,
Intellectual,
Radical women, modern...
They run the gamut.
Which kind would you like?
I'm just tired.
Can you give me a room?
I'm going to give you the same room Nixon slept in
The night before he made that famous speech to the press.
"you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore."
I'm going to give you that room, because it's got
The most comfortable bed in the house.
Okay, I'll take that room.
All right.
By the way,
What side of the political fence are you on?
I do not belong to any political party, sir.
I guess you could call me...
A feminist.
Sir, your pen?
It's filled.
Recording: You have reached
The official residence of the president,
Built in 1714, burned down in 1809,
Rebuilt in 1818,
Burned down again in 1841.
[telephone rings]
Hello?
Hello?
Jack: Some of us pursue perfection and virtue,
And, if we're lucky, we'll catch up to it,
But happiness can't be pursued.
It either comes to you or it don't.
You can always say,
"if only this,"
Or "if only that,"
But "if only" is a state of mind
That we get into when we feel deprived.
In my father's world, you do not take what is his...
Not his gold, not his silver, not his woman.
I thought I was doing it for my mother.
I thought I was doing it for my country.
Ultimately,
I knew I was doing it for me.
In the end,
It's the strongest arm that stretches the bow.
Hey...Give your uncle sweetheart a hug.
Hey, you're all skin and bones.
Aren't we all?
Anyway, I don't have to throw my weight around.
Look at you.
You must have put on a few pounds.
Eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Let me show you this place.
I own a piece of it.
Which piece?
It changes every day.
Come on, sit down.
There's a chair.
Plant your ass in it.
You look good.
You've got the jail pale.
It suits you.
So what do you got cooked up,
Sweetheart?
What's your angle?
This is going to be a patriotic rhapsody, Jack.
Here's the deal.
You'll be working for the people,
The peasants, the children.
Imagine yourself being reincarnated
In the civil war in Babylon.
Civil war in Babylon?
Come on, son.
Snap out of it.
You've got to stand up on your tiptoes
To see the future.
Look, man, this is our big Chance.
Another big Chance.
Yeah, that's right.
You do this show, this benefit.
It'll be seen all over the world.
You put your career back on track,
Maybe a tour, maybe a record,
Maybe both,
Make a little money and save the world
All at the same time.
It's all politics, Jack,
And money is the mother's milk of politics,
And we'll be a-raking it in.
You know you're not going
To make any of them things happen.
So?
So what?
So, will you play?
Of course I'll play.
You know I'll play.
Well, good.
I already told them you would.
You couldn't get anybody else, could you?
That didn't even cross my mind.
It didn't even occur to me.
Nobody could be like you,
And a great many have tried.
I just know this is going to come off.
I need some boys who can play.
I got some musicians right here.
Feast your eyes on simple twist of fate,
The best, and only,
Jack fate cover band in the world.
Ladies and gentlemen,
We have a special treat for you this evening.
Not only do we possess the twist of fate,
We possess the cha-cha, the boogaloo,
And the watusi of fate,
Jack fate!
Yeah! Whoo!

Man on radio:
The only power the government has
Is to crack down on criminals.
When there aren't enough criminals,
You make them.
You make so many things a crime
That it becomes impossible to live
Without breaking laws.
How'd they ever get you to do this?
They must be scraping the bottom of the barrel.
I might have a few songs left.
You wouldn't try anything, would you?
I got a lot of respect for a gun.
You create a nation of lawbreakers,
And then you cash in on guilt.
That's the system.
That's the game.
Once you understand that, you'll sleep a lot easier.
Remember, life is like riding in a taxi--
Even if you're not going anywhere,
The meter is ticking.
Beautiful animals.
Oh, thank you,
But it's God deserves the credit.
They don't have time to bother with success or getting rich.
They don't have fantasies of glory.
They don't borrow money to buy things
That decrease in value while they own it.
See, they're beautiful because they just are.
They do what they do.
A lion don't try to be a tiger.
Rabbit don't try to do an impression of a monkey.
They don't try to be what they're not,
Unlike us, us human beings.
The cheetah, the tiger, the snake, the monkey,
The baboon, the muskrat, the bobcat...
The pig that's fat,
The hippo, the rhino, the dodo,
The honey badger,
The slithy toad.
Each one, each perfect in their own original forms.
Then man came in--
Who created him and for what purpose?
Still a mystery.
Why is he here?
It's a mystery.
We know he's trespassing.
Doesn't know his own place.
Of course he doesn't know his own place.
He don't have one.
Man, the bear-hunter, the fur-trapper,
The deer-chaser.
Man, the bear-hunter, the deer-trapper, the, the...
Man, the bear-hunter,
The f--fur trapper.
Man, the--the--the deer-chaser--
Baby-seal-clubber.
The dolphin-snagger.
Lowest form of existence.
Lowest form of existence.
He's a rabble rouser,
He's a stir-upper, agitator,
Goes around sticking his nose where it don't belong.
The zoo, the aquarium,
They are--they are prisons for the animals.
These animals cannot learn anything from mankind.
Man doesn't have a thing to teach them.
I abhor looking at human beings.
Disgust me so much
With their atom bombs and blow-dryers and automobiles.
They build hospitals
As shrines to the diseases they create.
Human beings alone with their secrets,
Masked and anonymous.
No one truly knows them.
If I see a crack in the sidewalk,
It's more beautiful to me
Than any human being.
A crack in the mud at the bottom of a sun-dried dead lake,
I count that more beautiful than any human being.
You know what I mean?
I know what you mean.
Kind of like a curse, isn't it, being born?
You got that right.
Yeah, because we live in fear,
Because we know we're going to die.
Animals don't know they're going to die.
They got no fear.
They live content
In the moment.
[crows cawing]
[caws at crows]
Holds us back,
Knowledge of death.
I say amazing Grace indeed.
Oh, man.
I'll tell you something else--
Ancient cultures, civilizations,
Used to sacrifice animals,
Like cattle and rabbits and goats and such
Instead of human beings.
Now, today, we do it the other way around.
We sacrifice the human being,
Like the Incas,
Like the Aztecs, like the big corporations.
Amazing Grace indeed.
Hey. Howdy.
What was that all about?
The guy's into animals,
I guess.
Come on inside. I want to show you this place.
You'll like it.
Sure.
Right up your alley.
The networks are really behind this.
They're putting up a lot of money for this deal.
It's a bitched-up world, Jack.
The only way we can protect ourselves
Is by going mad.
%% I once was lost but now... %%
I'm not going to kill you.
Some famous star from the jazz age
Was disfigured
Right here on this stage during a live show.
Uh, what the hell was that sucker's name?
I can't remember that guy's name.
I don't know, stagger Lee?
No.
You want to know what really,
Really gets my goat, though?
I mean, all this talk
About race this, race that,
Ethnic this, ethnic that.
I mean, when you come right down to it,
There's really only two races--
Workers and bosses.
That's it.
Hey, man.
You hear what I'm saying?
Yeah, you said the same thing last week.
I told you he was here, and you were worried.
Miss Veronica...
Meet Jack fate.
Oh, yeah.
I had one of your first albums.
It's a shame.
It's one of the things my husband took
During the divorce.
So, are you ready for this?
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
Look, I've got a few things to do.
I'll see you later, maybe.
I hope you've got this cat's priorities
In order.
Have you explained the restrictions,
The limitations, the boundaries, huh?
The rules?
We talked about it.
I hope you know
We're dealing with the here and now.
You can't compare the here and now
With the there and then.
I don't care what he's done in the past.
Calm down. Everything's under control.
Are his songs going to be recognizable?
That's what I want to know.
All of his songs are recognizable
Even when they're not recognizable.
Don't worry about it.
We know right where we are,
Where everything else is.
We don't chase after things that are out of reach.
Ooh! Ooh!
You're so spontaneous.
Howdy.

Troubles...
I don't talk about my troubles while they're happening,
I'll tell you about them when they're over.
Anyway...
I slept like a log last night.
I got so much shit happening, man,
I'm going to turn this here thing
Into Woodstock, Altamont, the Beatles at Shea, Live Aid,
And the Elvis comeback special all rolled into one.
We'll see, we'll see.
I know what you think, man,
But I feel good about this.
I feel like someone who's lived 10,000 years,
Has 17 senses,
And is standing ankle-high in the Atlantic.
Well, I hope you pull it off.

Who's that?
Just the greatest human menagerie
Since the Stone age
At our services.
No mediocrity here.
Totally beyond criticism.
I got all the acts here
Who are going to round out this show
And fill up the Bill.
Come on in, come on in,
Jean darkness,
Dolly, the rubber girl,
Eddie Quicksand with Milo,
The great el Mundo with Ella the fortune teller,
And our shooting gallery of beloved world leaders,
Jean Paul Deuce, Mahatma Gandhi,
And our own beloved
Abraham Lincoln.
Come on in. Come on in.
Hey, you put on a couple of pounds.
Don't call that home number
I gave you, dolly.
%% Diamond Joe you better come get me %%

Here they are, Jack.
Friends, thank you all so much for coming,
But Mr. Fate and I
Have some fiscal business to discuss,
So if you could all step out
To the holding area,
There's refreshments out there.
Just see Ollie, our stage manager.
Thank you so much.
Hey, cookies.
Oh, Milo.
Hee, hee, hee, hee.
Oh, lookee here.
Lookee what the cat drug in.
Bobby cupid,
How'd you get in here?
Jack, did you know he was coming?
Where's your passport?
I don't need no stinking passport.
The land's too big out there, man.
After a while, it starts to swallow you up.
A billion years of weather and wind.
I got a surprise for you.
Wait till you see this.
What's that?
That, my friend, is blind lemon's guitar.
Where'd you get this from?
Well, I've been saving it for you.
How do you know it belonged to blind lemon?
Because I got it
From this old boy's house in Dallas
Down on the fifth ward
Near where lightning used to live.
Blind lemon gave it to him
When he was leading him around.
Looks like the only thing you could play on that guitar
Is solitaire.
This is one of the guitars that started it all.
Looks like something
I could go out to the corner pawn shop
And buy something just like it.
Well, maybe you could,
But it wouldn't be like this one,
Because this is the one
That played,
"matchbox blues."
Oh, "matchbox blues."
%% sitting here wondering %%
%% would a matchbox hold my clothes %%
%% ain't got so many matches but we got so far to go %%
Just like me and you, Jack we got so far to go.
Yeah..
I'm going to go and put some new strings on this.
See you later!
The later the better.

[cheering and applause]
Did you ever notice when you dream,
The dream seems to span several hours,
But actually only lasts a few moments?
No, not really.
I'm looking for Jack fate.
Is he in there?
Who's looking for him?
The name's friend, Tom friend.
I'm with the press.
Who are you? What do you do?
I'm a mechanic.
Well, I'm a writer.
I got an assignment to cover this so-called fundraiser.
I'm looking for Jack fate.
Hey, you ever read for whom the bell tolls,
Hemingway?
There's a guy that could write, you know?
Yeah, I read it.
I need to see Jack fate.
Are you gonna make my job easy or difficult?
Well, I don't know anything about any fundraiser.
Get word to him that I was here.
Can you do that? I'll be back.
I don't know.
This say anything to you?
Hmm?
Not a thing. No.
I'm hungry, Tommy.
Are you hungry?
Let's go get something to eat, okay?
Thank you very much.
He seems like a good person.
Yeah, pretty much.
They want you to sing that song, "revolution."
You know, the Beatles' song?
The slow version, the in-and-out one.
Oh, "revolution."
What else do they want me to play?
I got the play list right here.
Let's see, where's my glasses?
Okay, here we go.
"revolution,"
"street fighting man,"
"I won't get fooled again,"
"cell block number nine,"
"Ohio,"
"Eve of destruction,"
"kick out the jams."
You could do all those.
No, no, no, sweetheart.
Sounds like a lot of songs.
Look, son, you blew it before.
This is your big Chance.
I'm trying to get your career back on track.
There's people out there
Giving prizes to people like you.
Prizes?
Yeah, people are impressed
By people who win things,
Don't you know?
Ain't that the truth?
Look, son, I'm trying to be on your side.
Just let me.
You've got to be born on my side, sweetheart.
Oh, behold, the dreamer cometh.
What's going on, dreamer?
Well, there's some guy out there snooping around.
He looking for me?
What's he look like?
What's he look like?
Well, he's got a fu manchu goatee.
He's with some weird half-breed chick.
Looks like a leech, a bleeder, some kind of two-faced monster,
A spy.
Well, that's a good attitude.
You can tell all that just by looking at somebody?
Yeah. Well, a guy does all kinds of things
To give himself away.
He said he was with the press.
Lee? He probably would have had him shot.
Sherman would have hung him.
Well, maybe we should talk to him.
We could use some publicity.
Who does he want to talk to?
He wants to talk to Jack.
Well, maybe you ought to talk to him, Jack.
Exposure can't hurt.
Well, if you ask me, his pen's sweating blood.
Well, nobody's asking you.
Look, Jack,
I'm doing my best.
I'm trying my hardest.
I'm only human.
I know. It ain't easy being human.
No, sir.
[sirens and helicopters]
[praying softly in Spanish]
[door opens and slams shut]
Where have you been?
Well, they bumped off another taxi driver.
Had to walk.
What's going on out there?
Police are trying to bust out some political prisoner,
Or bust in and take some damn child molester out
And hang him from the lamppost.
Hell, I don't know.
What is it, Tommy.
What's bugging you?
What's bugging me?
The absurdity of a lifetime of futile labor,
That's what's bugging me.
Condemned to some pointless task.
I'm trying to track down some guy,
Ask him the meaning of life.
Look at that crowd down there.
Life is the meaning of life.
Your problem is
That you're always looking
At the bug on your windshield,
And if you keep looking at it,
You're going to miss the whole scenery
And have an accident.
You've got to look through the windshield,
Not at it.
What's that?
The dictatorship,
It's getting worse day by day,
And newspapers, they're just a false map of the world.
Did you ever hear of the aids epidemic, huh?
What if I told you
It was cooked up by some mau mau men in Africa
And they gave it to British sailors?
What about the Vietnam war, huh?
You ever hear of that?
What if I told you
It was lost in the whorehouses of Saigon
Instead of on the battlefield?
How do you know that?
[sigh] never reveal your sources.
Be careful, Tommy.
The light in your brain will go out.
I never thought I had a brain until now.

[helicopters flying overhead]
Hey, Jack. Tom.
Friend.
Tom friend.
I'm with the press.
Oh, I know who you are.
I know who you're with.
Great.
Long time, huh?
Uh...
You mind if I ask you a few questions,
Clear up a few things?
Not at all.
I don't mind, uh...
Ask away.
You got a smoke?
Uh, no. No, I don't.
What do you want to know?
What do I want to know?
I want to know a lot of things.
Like what?
Well, I know you had a twin brother.
What ever happened to him?
A hunting trip.
Yeah, well, Jack,
That doesn't explain anything.
Well, he never came back.
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
Now, it won't hurt you
To answer a few questions.
Nobody has to answer any questions.
No, this will do us a lot of good.
Let's just keep it simple.
Just tell him what he wants to know.
What does he want to know?
Can we keep it short?
Yeah, we can keep it short.
Okay, Jack. I've got a few things here.
What about...
Mothers of invention, Jack, hmm? Zappa?
Now, there's a guy,
He wouldn't take "no" for an answer.
He did that whole movie, uncle meat,
16 hours long, totally unedited.
He let it all hang out, didn't he?
What about you, huh?
You ever let it all hang out?
It always has been hanging out.
You know that singer
In the group the bee gees?
Yeah, he sounds a lot like, uh...
Gene Pitney, doesn't he?
As opposed to who?
As opposed to who.
"town without pity." you remember that, Jack? Hmm?
That place where they'd lock you up
For doing something
You haven't even thought about doing yet?
It's a pretty lonesome world, isn't it, Jack?
Hey...This here's supposed to be
About a Charity fundraiser, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, let's wrap it up.
What about...Hendrix?
Remember Hendrix at Woodstock?
I'm just curious.
You weren't there, were you?
You weren't at Woodstock.
You weren't up there with Hendrix.
Why? Where were you?
Hey?
You should have seen Hendrix, man.
He was all business.
Didn't mix business with pleasure.
Playing
"the star spangled banner"
Through two lousy speakers
To a half a million people in the mud?
What a cry that was.
Cry forlorn.
Yeah, one desperate cry for freedom
Up there with that screaming guitar.
Now, what was he saying,
Jack, hmm?
That "star spangled banner" trip?
Now, what was that all about, huh?
Revolution?
No, I don't think so.
You could hear tears in every note he played,
Saying,
"love me. Love me.
I'm not a traitor.
I'm a native son."
He took that glorious anthem...
He dropped drug bombs on it.
You could hear that cry around the world
Saying, "hey,
I'm an American citizen."
He was calling out to his forefathers,
Yeah, the pilgrims.
Pilgrims...They didn't need any stinking passports,
Did they, hmm?
Hendrix, Jack, he was the last man standing.
Pride and honor, right, that's what it's all about,
But, um, no, they didn't hear him.
One sad cry of pity in a town without pity.
Now, what about you?
What do you think about that?
That's what I want to know.
Would you reach out to a drowning man?
Would you think while you were doing it
That he might pull you in?
I think this Guy is way out of line.
Hey, hey.
Who wants a drink here, huh?
Anybody want a drink?
I want a drink.
Tommy. Tommy!
Tommy, I've lost something.
Hey, wait a minute!
Maybe we could still work this out!
This...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.
We can work this out.
I got my story.
We ain't working nothing out. Come on.
That was all off the record, you know?
Nothing's off the record.
Come on.
Here, have a drink, become part of the club,
Have a swizzle,
Become a member in full standing.
Thank you very much.
I don't drink.
I don't drink alcohol,
I don't drink.
Oh, I get it.
You're one of them hot corn girls, ain't you?
You got a lot of self-control.
Freedom is only for those
Who practice self-control, right?
Ain't that what you're thinking, right?
There he is. Go on.
Come on.
He won't bite you.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fate.
Who's this?
This is Mrs. Brown,
And she's got a lovely daughter.
My daughter has memorized all of your songs.
Why did she do that?
Because I made her do it, that's why.
What do you think of that, Jack?
Used to be she'd be sweating away
In some factory underage,
And now we got child labor laws.
All these kids,
We took them out of the factories,
Put them in the streets how about that?
Anyway, she wants to sing for you.
She wants to sing her little heart out.
Go ahead and let her.
Go ahead, darling.

Jack:
If I know nothing else,
I know at least one thing is true--
That the sacred is in the ordinary,
The common things in life.
They tell you that everything is nonsense,
That the laws of nature are nonsense,
Gravity is nonsense,
Relationships don't exist, jobs don't exist,
Everything is up for grabs,
And there's no cause of anything.
That's what they'd like you to believe.
I guess you could say that I was pushed downhill,
But my fall from Grace didn't end
At the bottom of those stairs.
It went on, and it seemed to go on forever.
Expect the worst, and you'll get it.
That's about all he ever taught me.
All of us in some way are trying to kill time.
When it's all said and done, time ends up killing us.

Come along.
Mr. Fate has work to do.
Come along.
%% Lord, it's hot in here %%
%% the air conditioner must be on the blink %%
%% I-- %%
Get out of my chair, man.
Jesus.
All right, so...
Here are the lyrics for "jailhouse rock."
The executives are insisting
That this song be sung, okay?
"jailhouse rock"?
Why they want to hear that?
Well, look at the lyrics, man.
Here, give it to me.
Uh, where is it?
I don't know.
It's something about a party
That the warden's going to throw in the...County jail.
They see it as a song of hope, you know?
Some, uh...Some kind of egalitarian thing.
They want to plant the seeds of hope.
A lot of people try to plant
The seeds of hope.
Yeah, but the seeds won't grow if you plant them on the carpet
Or a hardwood floor.
You've got to put them in the earth.
"jailhouse rock," Jack.
What do you think?
I don't know, sweetheart.
You ever heard of cellulose?
Cellulose?
Yeah, cellulose.
It's in the grass.
Cows can digest it...
But you can't...
And neither can I.
Jack, I screwed up.
I screwed up big-time.
That's one thing about you, sweetheart.
You don't do nothing small-time.
Shut up. I'm not talking to you.
I got a couple of guys chasing me down.
I made them some promises.
Promises are hard to fulfill.
Well, I had to borrow money, Jack.
I did a stupid thing.
I borrowed money to buy something
That's been decreasing in value
Ever since
I bought it.
Ain't that a bitch?
You live and learn.
Don't you understand?
I'm trying to get clear of my mistakes.
I've got a family,
Jack.
I'm not going to be a burden on my children.
Oh, don't leave, Jack.
Look, you know I'm not some vicious person
In a position of wealth and power.
You're like a chemist who invents a new drug
And doesn't care about the side effects.
I'm in over my head, Jack.
You're nothing but a piker, man,
A door-to-door encyclopedia salesman.
You'd commit treason against your own self.
Who's talking to you?
Common sense.
The voices inside my head.
That's who.
I mean, screw this so-called concert, Jack.
These cats here,
They're just addicted to lights and sound.
Man, let's go someplace
Where we can see the earth and the Sky.
Let's go to the south seas.
Let's go where Gauguin went
And just disappear for a while,
Because this guy here,
He's like a praying mantis.
He don't kill his victims, he just--
Hey...
I don't know which one of these voices
Is coming out of your mouth,
But tell it to shut the fuck up.
Gauguin was a stockbroker.
Let me borrow the keys to your car
For a while.
Yeah?
%% shadows are fallin' %%

Veronica: Hey, whoa, don't threaten me.
Lucius, why are you hassling me?
I told you, we're in this thing too deep
To make a change like this
On such short notice.
Hey, sweetheart...
Well, well, well, well, it's two scavengers.
Somebody must have left some food scraps lying around.
[laughs]
Your bones break easy, you know?
%% your breath is sweet %%
%% and your eyes are like two jewels in the Sky %%
%% your back is straight %%
%% your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie %%
%% but I don't sense affections %%
%% no gratitude or love... %%
Jack: My father controlled a lot of things,
A lot of people,
But he couldn't control my mother.
I can tell you one thing.
She never loved him either.
It wasn't a marriage.
It was a masquerade.
She could love no one, not even herself,
And he loved somebody else.
My mother tried to love me,
But I think she was trying to kill me.
I don't think she recognized me as her son.
It was like I had become a symbol
Of everything that had gone wrong in her life,
In her world.
%% ...To the valley below %%
I wondered if you'd ever return.
[laughs]
I wondered if I'd ever seen you again.
You were pretty beaten and banged up that night.
That was a bad night.
You never resolved it with him, did you?
Nothing to resolve.
You going to try to straighten it out with him?
You think you can?
It can't be straightened out.
Will never be straightened out...
Not by me, anyway.
Then what you coming back for,
Jack?
He's on his deathbed.
I got to see him.
I'm tired of not seeing him.
I want him to see me.
You gave it all away, didn't you?
You gave all the best of you away.
Yeah, I did. I gave it all to them sons of bitches,
Either unwilling or unable to accept it.
Yeah, we all did.
You want to go see him, you better go now.
I hope it's not too late.
Me too.
Look, don't you forget...
A home is a refuge,
A warm place for the heart and mind.
What can I do for you?
I want to do something for you.
What can I do?
[helicopters and sirens outside]
It's been a long time, Jack.
Yeah, it's been a while.
So much happens
In such a short time, don't it?
Seems like only yesterday.
Maybe to you.
Remember when we were kids,
We used to play in the back out there.
My mother cleaned this house.
My father took care of the grounds.
We were illegal back then.
We ain't illegal anymore.
We're in charge now,
Jack.
I remember your ma.
Wonderful lady.
Used to ask permission before she did anything.
Yeah, before she cut a leaf off a flower,
She'd ask permission.
Couldn't wash away the real dirt, though.
No. Nobody could.
I'm the man your father always wanted you to be.
I'm the next president of this country.
Yeah, that's something, isn't it?
You seem pretty convinced of that.
Well, you know how it is, Jack...
When inferior people want to revolt, they do.
When they become equal, they want to be superior.
You're looking at the top man now, Jack.
This ain't no dog and pony show.
We're not just a couple of macho men
From the flea market.
%% señor %%
%% señor %%
%% señor %%
%% let's disconnect these cables %%
%% overturn these tables %%
%% this place don't make sense to me no more %%
%% can you tell me what we're waiting for, señor... %%
Sweetheart, that's it.
I'm pulling the plug.
I'm not going to wait any longer.
Wait a little longer.
No.
What harm will it do to wait a little longer?
He'll show up.
I know he'll show up.
Let her pull the plug.
What the hell's the difference anyways?
What's going on?
Are you canceling the concert?
I get my exclusive, sweetheart, right?
You made promises.
I did?
Yeah.
I don't remember,
I got amnesia.
Hey, big promises, buddy.
Get the hell out of my face.
Hey, I got one for you.
What did the monkey say to the leopard
At the card game?
"I thought you were a cheetah."

%% my life, it hasn't been a pleasant one %%
%% and my time, it isn't long %%
%% I still don't know %%
%% what it was that I've done wrong %%
He's good. He's great.
I love his songs, because they are not...
They are not precise.
They are completely open to interpretation.
%% well, the judge he cast his robe aside %%
%% a tear came to his eye %%
%% you fail to understand he said %%
%% why must you even try? %%
You got any idea what that song was about?
Yeah, it's about trying to get to Heaven.
You got to know the route before you start out.
No, it's not about that at all.
What strikes you about the song
Is the Jekyll and Hyde quality.
The song is written from
Hyde’s point of view.
That's what you like.
It's about doing evil
And trying to kill your conscience
If you can.
It's not like those other songs of his,
The ones about faithless women
And booze and brothels and the cruelty of society.
It's not like those.
This one's right up your alley.
It's about doing good
By manipulating the forces of evil.
It's just like you.

Reporter on radio:
Geologists in Trenton
Are digging the world's deepest hole
And have reached the depth of 30 Miles.
Scientists have measured the temperatures down there--
[static]
They have lowered microphones into the pit
And heard the sounds of millions of suffering souls.
Dr. Samosa at the project management center
Has determined that the center of the earth
Is hollow.
"hopefully," he says,
"whatever is down there will stay down there."
In the west, rains--
[static]
What have I been doing?
Pissing and missing the ball?
I owe you an apology.
You've been avoiding me, man.
You don't need to avoid me.
I just want to know a few things.
I want to ask you a few questions.
Who's making the money on the concert, hmm?
You know, whose pockets is it lining?
Remember
Janis Joplin, huh?
The Judy garland of rock 'n' roll?
Now, she took it all the way, didn't she?
Lord, all she wanted was a Mercedes Benz.
You know, what pipe of power you smoking from?
Come on, man, tell me.
You're supposed to have all the answers.
What makes you tick, man?
You like people to fall on their knees, right,
And fall all over you, huh?
I don't do that. That's why you don't like me, right?
How much they paying you to trot around the ring?
What about the king of the sexual revolutionaries, huh?
Hefner, the son of a bible-thumping Baptist?
How does that Guy figure into this?
You're supposed to have all the answers, man.
Come on, huh?
Sexuality is more revolutionary
Than any ideology, and you know it.
What, you think
Good and bad are irrelevant?
Tell me why.
Who's your true companion?
Who makes your life easier?
Can you at least answer me that?
I'm on your side, okay?
I'm going to put your story
On the cover
Of the London times, man.
You need the publicity.
You know that.
You been to England lately?
It ain't so English anymore.
The empire is finished.
You know, they got the big Ben and the tower,
But it's just a theme park.
Jeez, you got your start there, man.
How does that make you feel, that the empire is finished?
What do you think about that?
That's what I want to--
Hey, man,
I'm on your side.
It depends on your point of view.
Hey, I don't want to be here any more than you do.
I doubt it.
%% gonna walk down that dirt road %%

Hello, Jack.
Do you know me?
You look familiar.
I was the star of the show here,
One of the biggest stars.
I was one of your father's favorite performers once.
Everything was going great
As long as you kept your mouth shut,
But he was doing things that were wrong, your father.
His desire for retaliation and revenge
Was too strong.
I was the only one
Who was in any position to say anything.
Everybody else was too scared.
I had the show, I had a forum, so I spoke out.
It's not what goes in the mouth, it's what comes out that counts.
They said it was an accident.
[strums banjo]
Some even said it was a suicide.
Some people choose to die in all kinds of ways.
Some people jump out of buildings
And slit their wrists on the way down.
Some fall on their own swords.
I opened my mouth.
Do you remember?
My name is Oscar Vogel.
Oscar Vogel.
[strumming banjo]
Well, I've got to get back to the stage.
The stage...
Ah, yes. The stage.
The whole world's a stage.
[distant thunder]
What's the matter, huh?
Come on. We're behind schedule.
We've got a problem here.
Too much electrical load.
The voltage at the output terminals,
They're undergoing a decrease.
So, can we do this?
Can we start on time?
We're all over that.
We're going to...
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're all over it.
30 seconds.
Five.
And three.
And one.
The president is dead.
%% I'm beginning to hear voices %%
%% there's no one around %%
%% I'm all used up %%
%% and the fields have turned brown %%
%% I went to church on Sunday %%
%% and she passed by %%
%% my love for her %%
%% is taking such a long time to die %%
%% but I'm waist-deep in the mist %%
%% it's almost like
I don't even exist %%
The president was a brave and strong man.
His principles and beliefs never wavered,
And which we must continue to strictly adhere to
And carry out
In accordance with his last wishes.
%% and the walls of pride %%
%% they're high and they're wide %%
At the moment,
We are giving people a new identity
And erasing the collective memory.
We are rewriting the history books.
Nothing was more important to our president
Than bringing peace to this war-torn country...
Peace, a lasting peace,
That can only be achieved through strength,
So in my first act as the new president,
As the leader of this new government,
Of this new regime,
We will begin immediately to deploy troops
In the southern region.
We will resume bombing in the jungle.
There will be no more violence from the organized media.
Real actual violence
Will take the place of manufactured violence.
[fast busy dial tone]
We will empty the prisons
And we will build the football stadiums,
And the evildoers from the prisons
Will be trampled by wild elephants,
Mauled by uncaged bears,
And pecked to death by screaming eagles.
[air raid sirens blaring]
Furthermore, we will alert the rebel leaders
That the negotiation's finished.
There will be no more compromises,
No more concessions,
Just complete and utter unequivocal surrender.
We have learned a valuable lesson--
Great nations do not fight small wars.
There will be no more stupidity,
No more mistakes.
It's a new day.
God help you all.
%% ...I'm 20 Miles out of town %%

[screaming]
[whistling]
We are living in a tawdry and vulgar age.
What do you think?
Yes, we are.
You know, when the Roman empire fell,
You know what Caesar
And the rest of them
Romans were doing
When the barbarians was at the gate?
What?
They were shooting craps
And gambling.
Gambling is a waste of time and energy.
You know, if you build a casino,
You've got build it like a fortress
In case there's a police raid.
I suppose.
Can I offer you a drink?
You want to be sociable?
No, I don't drink,
I don't drink,
I don't drink.
Just one little sip of nectar?
I don't drink,
I told you before
I don't drink.
Come on, you're not on duty.
I said no.
Come on, you can get to the truth of things.
Discover the riches of a wise and good life.
Well, I stay as I am.
Don't you want to live forever?
Put a little liquor in your blood.
Come on.
No. No!
[whistling]
She don't want a drink.
Oh, look who it is!
The sultan of sleaze!
The thing that came from outer space!
Where'd you come from, the world's fair?
We're having a conversation here!
Your day's over. There's no more conversation.
Look, son,
I was selling porno books
Out of the trunk of my car before you were born.
Don't tell me
I've had my day.
You're the scum of all scum.
You never should have been born, you pickled punk!
Maybe it is your day.
Tommy, let's go home.
It's not too late.
Let's go.
Yeah, it's always been too late.
Look, I won the jackpot.
The booby prize, huh?
A dead dog!
He's done nothing to you.
You're going to try to protect him?
You're going to try to kill me?
That sack of shit?
I wouldn't spit on him, him and his monkey lying tongue.
He's screwing you over like--
[praying softly in Spanish]
Aah!
[moaning]
[praying softly in Spanish]
[praying]
[screaming]
[gasping and choking]
[thunderclap]
Once when I was passing a cathedral,
A white dove came flying by
And dropped a twig it was carrying in its beak
At my feet.
This guy's gone.
Somebody better call the meat wagon.
You better get out of here.
Go out the back way.
You coming too?
No, I'm not.
[helicopters overhead]
I'll see you later.
Oh, man,
I had no idea it'd come down like this.
How could you?
All right...
Anybody see anything?
Anybody?
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it all.
I was right there.
He did it.
What?
Shut up.
He did it.
I was right there.
I saw it all.
He's responsible.
I mean, it might have been a random act, but...[sighs]
I'll tell you what--
You could put his whole life on trial.
For everything in life you do, sweetheart,
There's a price.
You pay it up front, in the beginning,
Or you pay it at the back end.
Oh, yeah.
Jack: I was always the singer, and maybe no more than that.
Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things.
Sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well,
Like what does it mean to not know
What the person you love is capable of?
Things fall apart,
Especially all the neat order of rules and laws.
The way we look at the world is the way we really are.
See it from a fair garden, everything looks cheerful.
Climb to a higher plateau,
And you'll see plunder and murder.
Truth and beauty are in the eye of the beholder.
I stopped trying to figure everything out
A long time ago.

Me and Al just got this new job.
- We're loading stuff in this warehouse. It's great.
- Oh, that's great!
- What's your problem?

Now you pretend you're leaving and bum-ba-ba-da,
I'm supposed to propose.
You want us to marry you.
What are you talking about?
We're not even pre-engaged.
- Mikey, if you wanna propose,

St. Louis.
Lincoln House Dinner Theater,
Kansas City.
Balcony Dinner Theater,
Little Rock.
They've left town.
Wait. Where's my work tote?
Oh, God!
- I think you left it!
- Oh, great! Now those guys know everything about us.
You don't have our home address in there, do you?
No, no, no.
We should just go to the police.
A cop shot poor Frank! ust let me think, all right?
I'm trying to make up a new plan.
Where can we go?
- New York?
- New York?
- New York's too obvious.
- Florida?
- Florida?
- They can't hide.
- We can't hide!
- We gotta go someplace where we can just blend in.
Okay.
Somewhere where they'd never look for us, because there's no theater, no musical theater, no dinner theater, no culture at all.
- Los Angeles.
- [ Truck Horn Honks ]
We could be L.A. girls now.
We should work out.
[ Both Laughing ]
Good one.
Thank you.
Oh. Oh, I think
I have a tissue.
- Here.
- Thank you.
What's this?
I don't know.
[ Both Screaming ]

[ Carla ]
We've been rehearsing a lot, and he's got that newjob.
What if he doesn't even have any job?
What if he's found somebody else?
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
I think Mikey cheated on me,
'cause I was always working nights.
It's not his fault.
It was probably that waitress at Dodo's Diner. The blond?
She always looks at him funny when she brings him his cheese melt.
Hi, Mikey.
[ Laughs, Scoffs ]
She makes me sick, she's so sweet.
So sweet. Like the devil in devil's food cake.
She just-- She makes me wanna puke.
She makes me wanna vomit.
It's okay, Carla.
It's okay.
[ Exhales ]
We deserve better, that's for sure.
[ Birds Chirping ]
[ Cows Bleating ]
You know what?
No more time for losers, Carla.

Mm-mmm.

Yeah, life is like a patio door.

- [ Giggles ]
- It really feels safe here.
[ Bang ]
Oh, gunshot!
Oh, Connie, they found us!
We're gonna die!
Let me look!

[ Bang, Bang ]
Oh, we're okay.
We're okay.

Oh, cute!
Don't bother, Carla.
They're all just Als and Mikeys with a tan.
No more boyfriends for us.
Oh, wait, back up!
Back up!
[ Door Creaks ]
Where are you?
Are you okay?
They're not okay.
Are you eating?
Okay, Mom--
We're eating, Ma.
Well, what are you doing for money?
I'm sure they've got jobs.
As prostitutes.
[ Sobbing ]
I'd be hard pressed to say
I can't remember a better-looking group of tourists. And I mean that.
I hope you're ready, 'cause today is the day when all the stars are coming out.
So, keep your cameras ready,
'cause here we go.
[ Siren Wailing ]
Oh, look at that.
Another celebrity getting arrested.
Kidding. I'm kidding.
Okay. Now--
Excuse me, sir?
Could we please drive by
Debbie Reynolds's house?
- Oh, yeah!
- Ah, no. That's not on the tour.
Keep your eyes peeled both left and right, because celebrities...
Sir? will just pop at you at anytime.
Sir? Sir?
Hi. Are there any dinner theaters in town?
Uh, not in this decade.
Now--
Sir, isn't there a place...
- where we could sit for dinner and a show?
- Yeah, my face.
Hey, it's jeff.
I, uh, I came by to see you again, but, uh, you're not home again.
But, uh, I'm bound to run into you sometime, right?
I'm gonna keep trying.
So, uh, anyway,
I-I can't wait to see you.
I will, uh,
I will talk to you later.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

None of these jobs pay real money.
I know.
I'll go make some calls.
Okay.
We'll find something.
We're the only salon in Los Angeles that does the hijiki herbal clay wrap.
You have done wrapping before.
Oh, yeah. There was a ton of these salons in France.
Where we're from...
[ French Accent ] originally.
Oh. Tres bien.
You can finish it then.
Seal it tightly with ductile sheathing.
Right.
Excuse me, Mrs. Morse.
Oh, sure.
Okay.
- Is that too tight?
- No, no, this is good.
It'll help squish out all that water
I've been retaining.
Fifteen pounds to go.
Mrs. Morse, you're thin.
- No, no, I'm not.
- But you are, really.
- No. No.
- Your leg is--
- No, no.
- Oh.
Can't even get my butt through this door.

Well, the girl said it's the new look.
Straw hair and beige lipstick?
Well, it's the new

- Yeah, for dead Californians.
- Oh.
Don't be sad.
We can help you.

You're fired!
Now we don't have any money for rent.

Hey, Carla, I feel sorry for Mary Magdalene.
Oh, why is that, Connie?
Oh, you know, she finally decides to mend her ways, going the straight path, and she falls for this guy--
33 years old, still living at home with his mother, who's never gonna accept a shiksa with a past for a daughter-in-law.
[ All Laughing ]
God, I love it.
I feel like I can finally say what I think.
I know. When we were doing the show in Chicago, and you would say, you know, dirty stuff,
I could feel the audience going,
''Oh, no. Don't do that.
Where's my dessert?''
But now, dressed like a guy--
We can say anything we want.
[ Connie ]
But with L.A. men, the bulge in their pants is a cell phone.

- I love the show.
- Mary, that is scary.

- Sorry? What was that?
- What?
- Perform.
Look. There are very few paying drag gigs in this town.
And I have to bartend at The Handlebar, and frankly, it's beneath me.
So, here it is.
Have you ever thought about adding a few fabulous friends to your show?
If you need some great new choreography,
I know some fabulous new dance steps.
I'm great with wigs.
I can sew a dress in three hours.

I haven't had any contact with my family in a long time.

Six months ago, I get a little sentimental watching TV--
Hallmark commercials.
So I send my grandma a birthday card, with my return address label on it.
So then my brother starts coming around.
Starts leaving me messages,
''Hey, let's be brothers again.''
- You don't want a brother?
- [ Scoffs ]
He's just gonna hate me.
No, he won't.
Does he know you dress with style?

I don't give up.
You know, I wasn't always in a successful show.
And I had--
I had this friend.
He told me to give up.
He called me a dreamer.
- That's not very nice.
- Yeah.
I know.
- I gotta go.
- Okay.
I just wanna know why you do it.
Why-Why you like to dress up? You guys.
Oh.
I'm sorry, that's personal.
No, that's okay.
It's-- It's kind of like this.
It's like dressing how you feel inside.
You know?
You know what,Jeff?
I haven't known your brother for very long, but I think--
I mean, I think, he's happy.
We've only got one life.
It's just a little strange that my brother's out getting a manicure right now.
What, haven't you ever had one?
[ Laughing ] God, no.
Well, you live in L.A.
Everybody gets their backs waxed and things plucked and--
I don't pluck.
I-I've never been plucked.
[ Stammering ]
And-And I don't do manicures.
Relax your hand.
I'm relaxed.
Wait-- Look at it.
It's like a claw.
- Okay, I'm relaxed.
- Open.
No polish though.
Deal.
- And?
- Nothing.
Oh, come on. Spill it.
- All right, but only 'cause we're talking guy to guy.
- Right.
- I've been seeing this woman.
- You got a girlfriend?
Oh, no. I'm gonna propose.
I mean, we're at that stage where
I should make a commitment.
But, uh, I'm not really sure if we're right for one another.
I mean, she doesn't make me laugh.
Oh, you gotta get out.
You gotta pull the cord on that mission.
Abort. Wah!
That could just be me being afraid to take it to the next level.
You know, I had this girlfriend once who told me I had issues about getting too close.
I stopped talking to her.
Have you told your girlfriend about Robert?
- No.
- But you're going to?
Oh, yeah.
No.
Well, maybe.
No.
I really gotta go now.
This was fun.
I've never missed a day of work.
I work all the time.
Oh,yeah.
But, it's nice just to hang out.
Thanks for the manicure.
Don't tell anybody.
Okay.
[ Exhales ]
Aren't you nervous?
How can you eat at a time like this?
I can't believe it.
Oy, is there lipstick on my teeth?
No.
Liar.
[ Laughs ]
Let's go.
Chickapow!
Chickapow!
Where were you today?
Hmm?
You were supposed to meet me.
I thought we were gonna go shopping.
You know, Carla, maybe we should watch our weight a little.
I mean, we practically need olive oil to grease the zippers on these costumes.
What? Don't go all L.A. on me, Connie.
All these women come to our show and idolize us... because as men we have better female self-esteem than they do.
Boy, you have some nerve.
Are you all right?
No! I was at that mall all day by myself, Connie.
People stared at me.
I felt naked.
I can't hide out like this much longer.
I need to get out of this closet.
Well, you can't.
Let's go.
Polar bear walks into a bar and says, ''I'll have a... beer. ''
Bartender says,
''What's with the big pause?''
And the polar bear says,
''Always had 'em.''
-[ Audience Groans ]
-[Man ]
You suck.!
You're outta here, Brad.
[ Scattered Chuckling ]
All right, uh, well, please welcome
Connie and Carla and the Belles of the Balls.

All right, here's the show we have planned for you tonight.
Wait! Wait! Stop!
I have an announcement to make.
It's time you all knew.
[ Under Breath ]
Carla, don't.
I... am... an eater!
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and soon we're gonna be a full-service dinner theater.
This is what America needs.
To eat and watch a show where real women are real women.
[ Audience Cheering ]
If you're naturally slim, fine.
Okay, but come on.
Starving ourselves to get thin.
No hips, no breasts until we look just like little boys.
Girlfriends, big or small, thin or fat, worship that body.
It's the only one you've got.
Hit it!

Good night, Stanley.
[ Grunts ]
Ow!
[ Chuckles ]
Oy.
[ Groans ]
Oh.
Here you go.
Thank you.
[ Exhales Loudly ]
Cotton absorbs.
Um.
Surprised they don't market it like that.
Mm-hmm.
[ Spits ]
I-I'm looking for Robert.
His cell phone is off. Is he in there?
No, she's gone.
You missed our show.
Oh, I'm not ready to see that yet.
No offense about your job.
None taken. It's not like
I'm itching to come down and watch you flip burgers.
[ Laughs ]
I'm a financial advisor.
Of course.
I can smell the stress on you.
I'm not as uptight as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
####[ Dance ]
Hey, bartender, I'm thirsty.
Hey, hey. Why are you--
Why are you different when you're away from all the other drag queens?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's like there's some kind of... drag queen code of behavior or something, you know?
It's like--
[ Imitating Drag Queen ]
Stripes?
Mary! Holy Martha Stewart's prison collection.
I-I-I got three words for you, Miss Thing.
[ Snapping Fingers ]
No, no, no and--
Four words. Yesterday!
[ Laughs ]
It's ridiculous.
What is that?
What? What was that?
Oh, please, don't make me do it again.
I think I pulled something.
I mean, I wanna figure it out.
I really do.
I mean, are you--
What's the thrill?
Are you hiding?
Actually, I am hiding.
Yeah?
Some murderers are after me and I'm hiding out as a drag queen.
Really. Really, I'm asking you really.
I'd like to know. I wanna figure this whole thing out.
Is this the real you, or are you playing dress up?
You understand?
Are you-- Are you playing dress up?
Or is this the real you?
I don't think you could handle the real me.
You'd be all,
''Oh, I want my mommy.''
Uh-uh.
It's true.
Uh-uh.
So a real woman doesn't scare you?
No. But, Connie, you're not a real woman.
Oh, you'd be surprised, baby.
I know your type.
You like uptight girls.
That is not true.
That is so not true.
Really?
Yeah.
Am I your type?
Sure. Yeah.
You think I'm attractive?
Connie, I've never seen you out of drag, but-but, uh,
I have to say that as a broad, you're-you're a real looker.
Ahh!
[ Chuckles ]
Can I get another one, please?
[ Choking ]
[ Tibor ]
I have been to dinner theaters in Idaho, to cabarets in Kansas.
I have watched every show in this whole country.
Connie and Carla have disappeared.
You're just mad
'cause Connie didn't call you.
Mikey, get it through that chunk-a-head of yours, Connie and Carla--
[ Whistles ] they're gone.
Hey.!
Sorry, Mr. Rudy. Whoa.
Who are you?
I'm Al.
I'm new.
What's your problem, Al?
Mikey. His girlfriend took off on him and--
[ Exhales Sharply ] th-that's all.
I love a good story.
- Where are Connie and Carla?
- We don't know.
But Mikey says he got a hang-up call last night.
- Caller I.D. said area code 3 23.
- Los Angeles.
- Oh.
- What a story.
Listen, you guys are useless to me here like this.
What I want you to do is
I want you to go out there, and I want you to find your girls.
Are you serious?
And when you do, call me.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Stops Chuckling ]
Why?
I gotta know how it ends.
[ Laughs ]
Uh, Mr. Rudy, oh, thank you.
Thanks.
Follow that idiot.
Uh, I already saw you.
Hello? I--
Hey!
Wait!
Look, I'm not--
I know you're not.
That was just a big--
It was just a mistake, what happened.
Yeah, a big mistake.
Can't we be friends?
No. No, we can't.
I don't have time for this.
This whole thing. Okay?
It's not normal.
Don't you think it's a little bit weird,
Mr. Rudy giving us this cash to come out?
- He cares about me.
- Since when?
I'm not sure.
There's some things about Mr. Rudy that might surprise you.
I heard some stuff.
What'd I do?
Would you find a map?
[ Honks Horn ]
Wanna ride?
You missed rehearsal this morning.
[ Groans ]
Carla, please.
I just got dumped.
What are you talking about?
How could I not know?
What, the straight guy?
Yeah. But he thinks I'm a guy, so it's over before it even started.
[ Sighs ]
- Isn't thatjeff?.
- Oh, yeah. That's interesting.
[ Exasperated Sigh ]
It's Jeff?
[ Chokes ] Right in the throat.
Are you crazy?
You must be out of your mind!
Carla! Carla!
Your knee is in my coochie!
Get off!.
Are you sick?
Do you have some kind of death wish?
Why would you take a chance on exposing us?
He'll talk about it to Robert, then she'll talk. People will talk.
Then those guys will find us and kill us!
Your voice is giving me mono.
Nothing happened. Back off!.
[ Gasps ]
You yelled at me.
We're fighting.
We never fight.
What's happening to us?
We're having a nervous breakdown.
Yeah, maybe we're having a delayed reaction to the trauma of being shot at-- like those guys in Nam.
You can't say ''Nam,'' Carla.
You weren't in Nam.
You have to call it Vietnam!
- Shut up, Connie!
I can call it what I want!
- Oh, God! I kissed Jeff!.
I kissed Jeff, and I wanna kiss him again without my wig!
You can't, Connie!
You can't! You did? ust my luck. I meet the guy of my dreams and he's straight!
Look at us! We're ridiculous, Carla.
I can't do this anymore.
Shut up, Connie.
We're in this because of you!
[ Gasps ]
It was your idea to borrow money for new costumes, even though you knew Frank was a gangster.
So because of you, we saw him get killed.
And then we--yes, we-- got shot at.
Shot at with real guns.
And that white powder?
That was cocaine.
You got us mixed up with some real criminals. Murderers.
And it was your stupid idea to be drag queens.
Now we're in hiding for life as women dressed as men dressed as women.
So shut up, shut up, shut up!
[ Exhales ]
I--
You've been weird.
Cut it out.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Girls, we need help.!
Open the door.!
Peaches and Jeff are fighting.
Let's go! Quick!
You won't even go inside.
You won't dare to look at the show.
I've asked you and I've asked you.
You won't do it.
Robert, I've invested days and energy in this relationship. I'm trying.
But, you gotta give me a break
It's hard for me to see you like this.
You can't pick and choose the parts of me... that don't make you sick to your stomach.
You can't have half a relationship with me,jeff. eff.
Oh, my God.
What are you--
What are you doing here?
- It's not what you think.
-Jeff, I can see that.
So this is what you've been up to?
No.
Sneaking around when you said you were working?
- [ Quietly ]
That's his girlfriend.
- I thought you were seeing other women.
- No, Mary.
- Her name is Mary? eff.
Introduce me to your girlfriend.
Mary, this is Robert.
My brother.
[ Quietly ]
Oh.
Okay. Um, we're gonna give you guys some privacy. eff, they're freaks.
God.
She's fine. He's fine.
Everything's all right.
Let's just leave her alone.
Maybe just a glass of water?
My heart's pounding. I thought she was going to kill that girl.
One who should watch out is thatJeff. I'm going to knock him into next week. I swear to God.
[ Loud Sigh ]
[ Sighs ]
Ouch. You know?
Yeah.
[ Robert ]
Christ.
[ Blows Nose ]
Let's eat.
[ Laughter ]
And he wouldn't stop asking me questions.
It was like I was
Professor Cross-dresser or something.
Like he says, ''Why are you called drag queens? Nobody's being dragged.
You're not dragging anything.''
Well, that comes from Shakespeare.
Really?
Yeah. He'd write, ''So-and-so enters,'' and in the margin, he'd put the initials
D.R.A.G.
''So-and-so enters dressed as girl.''
Drag. Okay, Shakespeare.
How about Ophelia Up?
No.
Wanda DeCountryside?
It's not me.
Devoida Talent?
Stop it.
[ Brian ]
Personally, I like Wanda DeCountryside.
What are you looking over here for?
That's your side.
Turn around, look over there.
[ Chattering ]
Come by later if you wanna talk.
Oh, sweetie. I am all talked out.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- You okay?
- Yeah. I've got guy problems.
Oh, sweetie.
Come on.
Welcome to What's Up L.A.?
A dinner theater that's full of drag queens? Holy stockings.
Gorgeous--
Connie and Carla, there you are.
If you could just spare us five minutes.
[ Whimpering ]
A big hit here in West Hollywood. ust tell us a little something.
Don't be so shy.
You've made a big splash.
It's just a local station.
[ Panting ]
Our viewers are dying to know you.
Okay.
- What makes you the best drag queens ever?
- Honey, we do our own singing.
[ Carla ]
No lip-synching for us, toots.
We do all your favorite show tunes wrapped in a delicious dinner.
That was a big mistake.
We have been flirting with disaster ever since we went on that stage.
Carla. Connie.
[ Both Gasp ]
What are you doing here?
What the hell is going on?
How did you find us?
Carla, how come you're a guy now?
Uh, Connie. I think a lot of people just saw that.
Yeah, but it's local news.
There's no way that that Russian or Rudy guy saw it.
Mr. Rudy.
Our boss.
[ Both Gasp ]
You work for Rudy?
He sent us to find you.
[ Both Gasp ]
What? What the hell?
You just tell Rudy that we wanna live.
We're not gonna tell anybody that he killed poor Frank.
- Wait. He killed Frank?
- You should listen to some of the guys once in a while.
- Al, we saw him kill poor Frank.
- To death.
- What happened?
- Rudy knows you're in L.A.
- We gotta get out of town.
- We can't. The official dinner theater opening is tomorrow night.
We can't let everybody down.
They're depending on us.
We can't do that to Stanley.
Why'd you cheat on me, Mikey?
I didn't, Carla. Ever.
Al just made that up because he was mad at Connie.
Come on, Carla.
Don't go be a guy.
You don't understand, Mikey.
I like doing the show. I'm good at it.
I like being Carla and Connie.
- Connie and Carla.
- Yeah. How come your name's always first?
- It sounds better. We talked about it.
- This is serious!
- We know.
- So let's go already.
Hold on. I need time to think.
Your voice is giving me shingles.
We need time.
Connie's gonna make a plan.
I'm gonna make a plan.
She's gonna make a plan.
Fine. Call us at this motel. Room 209.
First thing in the morning.
You wanna stay over?
Yeah.
Mikey!
- Carla, let's go.
- Connie, did you miss me?
No.
Yeah, you did.
- Rudy. I find them.
- [ Knocking ]
I'm an ass.
I should've seen your show.
[ Scoffs ]
I should've told my girlfriend about you. I should've loved you and accepted you... and been okay with the fact that you wear dresses.
I'm sorry, Robert.
It's just that when you left home, it was hard on me. I was 1 2 years old.
I wake up one morning and you were just gone.
You didn't call me.
You never even wrote to me.
I got kicked out.
What? No.
Mom and Dad kicked me out.
They found my bra.
You thought I left?
Yeah.
[ Scoffs ]
Well, whatever happened,
Mom regrets it.
- She does?
- Oh, yeah. Dad too.
Ha.
[ Chuckles ]
No. They wanna see you. eff, for the first time in my life, I like who I am.
Forget it.
[ Stammers ]
I wanna be part of your life.
I'll say hi to Mom and Dad for you.
And Grandma too.
Okay.
Oh, uh, and Jeff, uh,just a heads up.
My roommate, 'N' Cream, is on a tear to kick your ass.
- 'N' Cream that--
Oh, the little-- the little--
- Yeah. The--
- Tell him-- Tell him to bring it.
- Make a joke. I warned you.
- Thanks for the warning.
- Go, go, go. Go.
[ Knocking ]
Hi.
Hi.
Robert's not here.
Yeah, I know.
I just came from up there.
Uh-huh.
About the other night,
I wanted to--
Yeah. Um, how's Mary?
Well, we talked about things for hours. It's not good.
I mean, the relationship, it's just-- We broke up.
Oh.
I wanted to apologize to you.
Um, you're not freaks.
You're not a freak.
I hated seeing you hurt.
Thanks,Jeff.
I have fun when I'm with you.
Well, all of you, you know?
It's just, I'm not--
I know.
You told me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
[ Man On Radio ]
Good morning, L.A.
Looking at the freeways, three cars got together on the 1 0 1 at Winnetka.
Mikey.
Connie and Carla will call.
I know.
[ Line Ringing ]
Sahara Motel.
Hi, Room 209.
I'll connect you.
[ Line Rings ]
Hello.
Hi, Al.
Connie.
Listen, we're coming--
Mikey, talked to this guy.
Rudy's on his way.
What?
He's gonna kill us all.
We gotta get out of here.
Okay, bye.
Mikey just talked to a guy from work.
Rudy's on his way to L.A. We gotta go!
No.
Carla. We're gonna die.
I am so sorry for dragging you into this mess.
I love this mess.
Thank you for dragging me.
Pun intended.
Listen, who says they're gonna find us in this big city anyway?
[ Low-pitched Voice ]
Would they be looking for a couple of queens?
Here's my plan.
We launch the show.
We stay for one night.
The audience sees how great the guys are and they come back, and Stanley doesn't lose any money.
That's a good plan.
I know.
One night.
One last show. Okay?
Okay.
[ Sighs ]
So, I've been thinking.
We should have the guys enter from the back of the house on ''Good Morning Starshine.''
Oh, honey. If you're gonna enter from the house, you've gotta do it on ''7 6 Trombones.''
[ Screams ]
Debbie Reynolds!
Debbie Reynolds! Hi, hi, hi!
Hello there. Hello there.
Somebody put a letter in my mailbox.
I saw your house on the Star Map.
You know, you've got a pretty hot idea here.
A dinner theater.
Will you please be in our show?
Yeah, will you please be in our show?
We open tonight, so there's not a lot of time to rehearse.
Oh, honey, I've got sheet music and gorgeous gowns and a good underwire bra.
- I could go on now.
- [ Both Giggle ]
- So chins out, boobs up, it's showtime.

Okay. On with the show. ''Mame.''

- What the hell was that all about?
- Um, the Guys and Dolls tribute?
Oh, save it, Mary.
What just happened?
Come on, Connie.
Let's tell 'em the truth.
No more lies.
I'm sure you're all wondering... what the cops and--
First, we owed some money, and then we saw something... and we've been hiding for a while, pretending to be something that we're not.
Hey, who saw Yentl?
So Barbra Streisand wants to study the Talmud, right?
But, she can't because she's a woman, so she pretends to be a man, and, uh, one thing leads to the next, and before you know it--
Uh--
Everybody-- Everybody believes that she's a man.
So she has to keep lying-- even though she wants to stop, she can't,
'cause she has to keep lying to people that she cares about.
You know, that have been really kind.
Look, uh, we're women.
[ Nervous Laughter]
[ Scattered Laughter]
No, you don't get it.
We're women.
[ Murmuring ]
[ Loud Gasps ]
- Oh-ho-ho. Oh-ho-ho.
- [ Gagging ]
We're sorry we lied.
So sorry.
- [ Man ]
Boo.!

Get off the stage.!
Let's go back to Chicago.

Excuse me.! Hello.!
Didn't you used to work at the Slimming Salon?
Yes.
Mrs. Morse?
Well, I don't care what you are.
You always made me feel beautiful.
- [ Audience Murmuring ]
- But we thought you were men, and you're not really men.
- Oh, honey, who is anymore?
- [ Laughter]
- I thought something was up.
- Me too.
- No, you didn't.
- Girls, in an art form based on... being true to one's real self, welcome to your outing.
-Jeff?
- Connie.
- Oh, great. More drama.
- You came to my show.

- Hey, everybody, this is my brotherJeff.

Hi,Jeff!.
Hi.
You look, uh--
You look different. eff, I'm a woman.
[ Laughs ]
It's an authentic look. Yeah, but--
No. I mean I'm female.
We're girls.
We were faking it.
It's this long story--
Connie, please, we've been over that.
Really.
Really?

RED SATIN
And if I was really... a liberated woman, would that bother you?
That depends.
In that case,
I will be yours.
Monica was laughing.
Didn't you notice?
Why the irony?
Cause Rodrigo likes interesting girls.
Come on, tell me.
The truth is, Belinda, you watch too much TV...
Hi, Mom.
Why are you late?
I was talking with Hela.
Your friend whose folks are aways? -That's her.
Eat Something.
Before you go to bed.
Okay. I ate.
-Very funny.
Is this how it is going to be now?
I am really not hungry.
At least try your sweater on.
No, Mom. No.
-Look.
You know I don't like pink.
Good night.
How about going to Rando and Pimpkys?
No, I don't want to.
I don't like them.
Fine. It's no big deal.
I don't want to see them anymore.
Ok, all together now, as one.
In time.
Come on. Chins up.
Tuck in those bellies.
Make those arms graceful.
We turn again to the left.
Selma, to the left.
Come on girls, all in time.
All in time!
Lift your arms. Smile.
Come on, keep it up.
To the left... very good.
Sway the hips to and fro...
I don't believe it. My Mom!
What's up?
-Make like...
She saw me.
Okay, see you tomorrow.
You pick me up now?
For a change.
Are you meeting someone?
No, she's not there.
How's school? You managing?
Yes, but the third term is harder.
We have got more subjects.
You will have to work harder.
Which reminds me...
I am studying at Helas.
It's quieter.
It's quiet here too.
Mom, her parents are away.
So who's minding the house?
Her older brother.
Good night.
Hello. Two kilos of oranges, please.
What's that?
It's brand new.
Sure, that's why it's all rusty and the brakes are shot.
Your change, Madam.
I need the money.
How much do we give him?
He can have 280, but that's it.
Okay, done. Thanks.
Thanks, guys.
Excuse me, you dropped your oranges.
Mom.
-Where are you?
Helas birthday party.
-So late?
How will you get home?
I'm spending the night here.
And what's that music?
Hello? I can't hear you...
Can I offer you a drink?
Hello, beauty.
What are you looking for?
Look at the state she is in.
Poor thing.
-You know her?
Never seen her before.
Let me have a look.
Go on, leave her alone.
Get moving.
Everyone out of my dressing room.
To hell with you. Out!
Who do you think you are?
Feel any better?
You okay, honey?
What happened to you?
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for my daughter.
Here, in a cabaret?
And you fainted?
-I want to leave.
Don't fret. I'll show you the way as soon as my show terminated.
Relax.
I want to go home.
Don't worry. I will take you.
Give me a hand.
Quick, please. Thanks.
What's your name?
Lilia.
Want us to walk you home?
-No, thanks.
You will be okay?
-Yes, thanks.
Morning, Mom.
That hurt.
I'm sorry.
So I worry here all night, and it doesn't matter to you?
It's not like that.
I'm really sorry.
Where were you?
-I told you.
With Hela and everyone in the suburbs.
Never do that to me again.
All this because
I didn't sleep here.
I am not a baby anymore.
I am sorry Mom.
Good morning.
-Good morning.
How much is this?
-12 dinars a yard.
Look who's here.
Hi, young lady.
Hello.
You gave us a real scare.
I am sorry.
The smoke, the men, the atmosphere...
I don't know...
You live around here?
No, I came for cloth.
I sew a little.
Really?
You are just what I need.
Nothing fits anymore.
The other night, onstage, my top split open, and I had to cover my breasts with a fan.
It must have been awful!
Not at all.
They all loved it.
I got 1 47 dinars.
That's why I came to buy new fabric.
Which do you like best?
That's the most cheerful.
-lt is nice.
I will take the Iot, thanks.
I wanted to tell you, you were great.
You dance so well.
Thanks.
Come again sometime.
I don't know if I can.
I thought my daughter hangs out there.
I get it.
You are a strict mother.
If you ever do feel like it, you are my guest.
Okay. See you.
You like that?
Morning, Mom.
-Morning.
Up already?
Sleep well?
Yes... no.
Why?
-A bad nightmare woke me up.
Horrible things coming out of the sea and crawling along the beach.
What kind of things?
Sticky creatures, like snakes.
Have some coffee and forget your snakes.
What are you doing today?
The usual.
I've got an early class.
I don't really want to go.
Hi, Lilia.
How are you doing?
-Not too bad.
I'm a Iittle bored, in fact.
I keep busy, knitting.
Which reminds me...
I have a gift for your daughter.
-How kind.
That's nice work.
Look how pretty it is, Zeinab.
You like it?
You know what?
She wanted a sweater for 40 dinars!
What a waste!
What brand?
Naf-Naf.
See, that's all they know today.
Know what I found in her purse?
Lipstick.
And she's just 14.
What are we to do with these kids?
Be patient.
She's a good girl.
She won't do it again.
Try the sweater on by the mirror.
Mine drives me crazy, too.
Good evening, Lilia.
What's wrong? What's up?
You look upset.
Salma's ill.
I'm off to the pharmacy.
All alone at this hour?
Mohammed can go with you.
Mohammed! Come here.
Where is he?
-I don't know.
Can we hurry a bit?
I want to see the game.
Go watch your game.
-You sure?
Stay here. Good night.
Fantastic, but put in a couple more stitches here.
Folla, you are next.
Coming.
You really dance well.
Sorry. I'll take it right off.
Leave it on. Let's have a look.
Turn around. You look great.
Let's surprise them.
I can't go out like this.
It was just to see.
Don't play the nervous virgin.
The clients are leaving.
Come on!
Hey! Here's our new star.
Shokri, play something.
The darbouka, please!
This is my place.
Come on.
Good night.
Good night.
The evening's over?
Well, good night then.
What's the matter?
You are still in bed.
I was worried.
Don't worry.
I didn't sleep well.
I had a toothache.
You are not being reasonable.
Go see the dentist.
And you? You okay?
You know, sometimes
I feel past it.
That's normal, we're not the same age.
I'm off. My class starts early.
What a lovely dress.
Who's it for?
Madam Kamoun wanted some alterations.
But this isn't hers.
There's a lot of perfume on that.
Hi, Salma.
Are you better now?
Kids pay no mind to their health and mothers worry.
Think about yours.
Here. T ake it back.
-It's a gift.
It's not for me.
Or I'm not for it.
Let's dance together.
I just came to give you the dress.
I have to see a client.
It will be fun.
We will drive them crazy.
Put that down.
Hey, girls! Come on!
Isn't that your costume?
So what?
Help her get into it.
We're gonna have a ball.
Faster, faster.
Let me help.
Turn around.
It's gotta be tighter.
Easy...
The color suits you.
And shake those breasts!
Let's get it done up before she starts.
Lift your head.
Here, take this hair clip.
Look at this hair!
Yeah, just like silk!
Just look at that gem.
Tighter!
Good. Is that okay?
Wait a bit.
Bank notes galore tonight!
For us too, I hope.
-Of course!
Just look at that lovely smile!
Don't be afraid. It's easy.
Follow me.
I was ridiculous!
Ridiculous? Are you kidding?
Wild, maybe.
Didn't you hear the applause?
I heard nothing.
I saw nothing.
You were ecstatic, as if...
Ask Shokri.
He never saw anything like it.
I'm so ashamed.
What do you think?
Lovely and talented, with fire in her blood.
But she dances for herself.
No technique.
It gets away from you.
But this isn't a game.
There's an audience.
It's not you in front of your mirror.
Let me be frank.
We're all artists here.
Understand?
-Yes. You are the manager.
So, you will take her?
We will see.
But she's got to learn how to move.
Move your hips up and down.
Now...
Backwards...
Lift up your hair.
Show some neck.
One... two...
Look in front of you.
Smile at the customers, part your lips a little.
Move. Go on!
On your toes.
I'm exhausted.
Dancing is hard work.
What did you think?
I will be right back.
Thanks.
Make yourself at home.
Let's cool off.
How long have you been at the cabaret?
Almost fifteen years.
I'm part of the scenery now.
I'II be kicked out soon.
He wouldnt! You are the star.
Star? You are kidding.
I heard he's getting new girls.
Blonde and cheap.
Don't look so shocked.
That's life.
Drink your drink.
If I'm boring you, just say so.
What's wrong?
You keep looking at your watch.
I don't want to be Iate.
Thanks for the information, it's like making love with a stop watch.
You think it's easy.
Studying and going out with a musician?
It's my job.
To be in love behind everyone's back, especially my mother.
It's torture.
Why don't you tell her?
You are crazy.
It'd kill her.
I'm all she's got.
If she remarries, that'd fix everything.
You don't know her.
Her life is dedicated to my father's memory.
She talks to him...
I mean, to his photo.
She says all sorts of stuff, like he'd answer.
Maybe she hears him?
Maybe.
I've got to go.
Mom...
You didn't finish my dress.
I'm sorry.
I had so much work.
For the neighbour who never pays.
I promise I'II do it soon.
Please. I need it.
Make an effort.
The black bra. How much is it?
-120 dinars.
For you, Madam?
Yes, as usual.
Could you call a cab?
-Right away.
Two minutes, Madam.
Can I help you?
Thank God. You are back.
Leaving your daughter out at this hour?
It's not right.
I visited a sick friend.
How are you?
How's the family?
Everyone's well, and sends you their regards.
Where are your keys?
Why are you late?
Well I never... Since when must I make excuses to you?
I'm the one who's been stuck with him.
I can't take any more.
Get your uncle some tea.
I'll make dinner.
No, thanks.
An orange will do.
Mom, you bought new shoes?
Yes.
They are really shiny.
You want them to be invisible?
It's the style.
Women and fashion. My God.
Let's have a look.
Now that's a shoe.
Can you walk on those heels?
They are very comfortable.
Like being barefoot.
-Barefoot?
They are real nice.
T ry them on.
-Not now.
Come on.
Show us how you walk in them.
They are great.
I'll go and make dinner.
May God hear your prayers.
Here kid...
And for your mother.
This child does not eat.
She's even thinner than before.
Good night.
Why watch that?
Luckily, she's gone to bed.
Salma's nice and obedient.
Thank God.
But she' s tired.
Her eyes have bags.
You have too!
Come more often to the village.
We should.
But I've so much to do here.
Here. Eat.
More coffee?
I'm going. I'll be late.
Wait for me.
I'm going too.
It's time.
The harvest wasn't good.
Thanks. Give all my regards.
I'II tell them.
T ake care of yourself and the kid.
Bye.
You should have worn something else.
Button it!
-Button it? Me?
The dress, not your mouth.
Finally, you're here!
I was worried.
I had family over.
You'll tell me later.
Change. We have got work.
How much did he give you?
200 dinars.
What? Count it again, you never know.
It looks right.
What a meany!
You have got admirers.
They come to see you and he knows it.
It's wrong, cheating her.
She's been slaving for three weeks.
It's hard times for everyone.
Phone, rent, taxes...
Exactly. Hard times for everyone.
Okay.
You two can have another forty.
God will repay you.
Twenty each.
It's better than nothing.
How much did you get?
The usual.
We're on in ten minutes.
We'll work them up tonight like they have never been.
Who? -The clients.
Who'd you think?
Where do you think we are?
Don't look at me like that.
-Why not?
T ell me... you have got a girl, don't you?
Yeah.
I know a girl.
Do you love her?
Yes, but... it's complicated.
She's all her mother's got.
You know...
Ever since I saw you dance,
I can't take my mind off you.
Lilia, you are on! Now!
I love dancing.
-ls that so?
No kidding.
Weddings, cabarets...
Sweetie, a client wants to meet you.
Listen.
This is serious.
Make an effort to be nice.
-What do you mean, nice?
Don't play the shy virgin.
He wants you to dance at his home, in private.
-His home?
I dance here, for the clients.
I'm an artist.
He is too, in a way.
He pays well.
Listen.
I tell you. Don't be afraid.
See that Mercedes?
It's mine.
Let go of me.
I want to go home.
I know. The boss told me you were not like the rest.
I'm different too.
Let's get to know each other.
You would not be sorry.
Let go of me.
I'll take you home.
Maybe you will change your mind.
Come on, let's go.
Don't look like that.
What's going on?
What does he want?
I'm doing business with the lady.
What business?
Is she your sister?
Girlfriend, wife?
Piss off!
Piss off?
She's my sister-in-law.
Her husband's a karate teacher.
Would you like to meet him?
I'm just about home.
Thank you.
Good night then.
Good night to you.
Hi, Lilia.
Hi, come on in.
It's been a while since I've seen you.
I see Salma every morning.
You are so busy...
Not at all.
You know, Lilia,
I think Salma smokes.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
Yesterday...
I smelled cigarette smoke again.
Times change.
You're right.
I should be more careful.
Want some tea?
She's grown so quickly.
Such a lovely flower.
Sometimes...
I see her with a young man.
He's family, perhaps?
T all, thin...
-I will make tea.
Lilia, I'm telling you...
It's a dangerous age.
You have to watch her carefully.
It's not easy for you, a woman alone.
I put myself in your place.
Believe me...
-Thanks.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?
Just visiting.
-Later, Okay?
You don't want to see me?
-Of course!
Are you coming tonight?
Yes or no?
I don't think so.
I don't feel like going out.
You look so tired.
Doesn't she?
She hasn't been in good form these days.
She lets it all out at night.
Lets it all out? Where?
At the cabaret.
The cabaret?
I'II make the tea.
She alters my dance outfits.
I'm a cabaret dancer.
The cabaret, right near here.
Know it?
-Certainly not!
Maybe not, but your husband must.
My husband?
Of course. But he does not tell you. I know men.
This is a bad dream!
Where'd she come from?
Hi, Fola.
-How you doing?
The friend I mentioned.
-Charmed.
Do your best on her.
What's her name?
-Lilia.
Hi Lilia.
Where have you been?
The usual... the cabaret...
Want a cigarette?
-Oh yes.
Your flame is out.
-lt lights at night.
So this is our new star?
What would you like?
-I don't know.
A new haircut?
Like Barbarita in the series?
A cut like this?
-Yes.
That'll be just perfect for you.
Is that you in the photo?
Yes, in my last show.
You look great!
She should've come.
The place was packed.
She's shy, our friend.
What are you looking at?
It suits you, that new hairdo.
Think so?
You look young.
-Don't fib.
No, really.
You're pretty, like this.
You should dress more modern.
Like your hairdo and your shoes.
Yesterday I got a bag.
-Let's see.
It's lovely.
Met someone?
-Don't be so curious.
You could tell me.
Don't talk nonsense.
But it'd be terrific!
You're prettier than ever, recently.
The bag, the shoes, the hairdo...
Can I study at Hela's tonight?
If you like, she can come here.
You can go to her place.
But I prefer you sleep over.
Really? You sure?
I won't worry so much like that.
"To determine the mass of a steel ball.
You remember that class?
"First, using a balance..."
What's he up to?
He was supposed to meet me.
It's still early.
You know he is at the cabaret.
"First, using the balance,
"measure the water displaced..."
Hello, Mom?
-Hello, sweetheart.
Did I wake you?
-No.
Did you study well?
-Yeah, we did.
Your voice sounds strange.
It's okay.
I didn't sleep well.
Mom?
Yes.
It's something important.
Are you listening?
Yes.
At the dance class,
I met a boy.
We are in love.
I want to introduce him to you,
If that's okay with you.
All right.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
What have you done?
I tidied up. What's wrong?
I think we should stop seeing each other.
Don't you ring?
-I never do.
Yes, but today...
-She expects us.
Mom, this is Shokri.
Charmed.
Please sit down.
So, you are Shokri?
You have nothing to say?
Excuse me, Madam.
I didn't think...
You didn't think what?
I didn't imagine
Salma's mother like you.
Did you think I was a dragon?
If dragons looked like you...
I'm just talking nonsense.
Salma dances as well as you.
What's that supposed to mean?
I meant...
Seeing you, I can see why she's so gifted.
You know how to make compliments.
He writes lyrics for songs with a composer.
Go get us some tea while I talk to Shokri.
Unless you want something else?
No, tea's fine.
She is singing.
She is happy.
Relax.
Think how it was at the cabaret.
We will learn how to get along.
I will be an excellent mother-in-law.
I'm sure, Madam.
Lilia. What's this Madam?
I'm sure, Lilia.
Please.

{920}{953}Again, a good deal of cloud.
{954}{1015}A little rain from time to time|for much of the day,
{1016}{1097}but later on that rain is going|to become ever more persistent
{1098}{1135}and eventually,|I think that rain
{1136}{1193}will probably turn out to be|fairly heavy.
{1263}{1349}What you've seen in any|documentary about any band,
{1350}{1450}before or since, is how great|and wonderful everything is.
{1451}{1552}It's not the truth of it.|It's hell, it's hard.
{1553}{1672}It's horrible.|It's enjoyable to a small degree
{1673}{1733}but if you know what you're|doing it for,
{1734}{1776}you'll tolerate all that
{1777}{1869}because the work, at the end|of the day, is what matters.
{1869}{1920}We managed to offend
{1921}{2006}all the people we were|fucking fed up with.
{2549}{2652}The Labour Party, who'd promised|so much after the war
{2653}{2764}had done so little|for the working class
{2765}{2889}that the working class were|confused about even themselves
{2890}{3003}and didn't even understand what|working class meant anymore.
{3004}{3053}It was cold and miserable.
{3054}{3119}No one had anyjobs.|You couldn't get ajob.
{3120}{3169}Everyone was on the dole.
{3194}{3250}If you weren't born|into money,
{3251}{3309}then you might as well have kissed|your fucking life goodbye,
{3310}{3363}you weren't gonna amount|to anything.
{3364}{3426}The germ, the seed|of the Sex Pistols
{3427}{3493}generated from that.
{3633}{3704}Now is the winter|of our discontent
{3705}{3838}made glorious summer --|by this sun of York.
{4008}{4090}England was in a state|of social upheaval.
{4091}{4183}It was a very, very|different time.
{4184}{4241}Total social chaos.
{4241}{4309}There was rioting|all over the place.
{4310}{4357}You have to join|the picket line.
{4358}{4429}There were strikes on every kind|of amenity you could think of.
{4430}{4480}Pound power.
{4481}{4563}The TV channels would|go on and off randomly.
{4595}{4689}People were fed up|with the old way.
{4690}{4764}The old way was clearly|not working.
{4829}{4874}There's a little bit|sticking up there.
{4875}{4932}You can see it|in the reflection.
{4933}{4996}Ultra Bright|gets you noticed.
{5083}{5148}You're told at school,|you're told at the job center,
{5149}{5241}you're told by everyone|that you don't stand a chance.
{5280}{5374}And you should just accept|your lot, and get on with it.
{5400}{5459}That's where you're gonna get|the social strife.
{5460}{5530}Hate and war...|and race hate.
{5740}{5797}When you feel powerless...
{5798}{5878}you will grab any power|you can...
{5879}{5960}to retain some kind|of self-respect.
{6009}{6064}Want something on how many|people have been mugged?
{6065}{6142}Don't lay your hand on me...|I'll break your fucking jaw!
{6143}{6228}That man is sad|'cause he's misinformed,
{6229}{6290}and he's misled,|and he's used.
{6291}{6361}Yes -- I am a racialist.|And why?
{6361}{6410}Who's made me a racialist?
{6411}{6480}This government --|the conservatives,
{6481}{6561}and every stingy,|stinking councillor
{6561}{6624}who sticks up for the nigger.
{6625}{6685}And I'll stand by my words,
{6686}{6766}'cause I don't like these people,|never will do!
{6810}{6852}Words are my weapons.
{6853}{6932}Violence is something|I'm not very good at.
{6933}{7004}I don't think you can explain|how things happen,
{7005}{7061}other than sometimes|theyjust should,
{7062}{7148}and the Sex Pistols|should have happened, and did.
{7149}{7204}We went out in the garden.
{7205}{7249}Get off your arse!
{7621}{7678}I was born|in Queen Charlotte's Hospital
{7679}{7750}on September 3rd, 1955...
{7751}{7824}And I lived with my mother|and my stepfather
{7825}{7885}who I thought was my dad,|in the basement
{7886}{7921}in Shepherd's Bush.
{7922}{7987}And I slept at the edge|of their bed on a camp bed.
{7988}{8064}My real dad, he bailed|when I was two.
{8065}{8166}His name was Don Jarvis.|He was an amateur boxer.
{8167}{8274}I definitely didn't feel|wanted as a child.
{8309}{8393}Well, I was born and raised|around West London,
{8394}{8456}the Shepherd's Bush|and Hammersmith area.
{8457}{8519}It was typically|working class.
{8520}{8622}I met Steve 'cause we lived around|the corner from each other.
{8647}{8705}I went to school|near Paul and Steve,
{8706}{8748}next to Wormwood Scrubs|Prison.
{8749}{8798}Me dad was a factory worker,
{8799}{8869}and mum worked at|a powder puff factory.
{8869}{8940}If you were to look back at me|as a school kid,
{8941}{9004}you'd see a very shy, quiet,
{9005}{9112}Iittle church mouse kind of|character in North London.
{9148}{9198}Irish immigrant parents.
{9199}{9259}My mum taught me|to read and write
{9260}{9348}after meningitis, a serious|illness I had at seven,
{9349}{9412}when I was in a coma|for a year.
{9413}{9510}When I came out of hospital,|I was completely brain wiped...
{9511}{9603}Old memories had been erased...|Didn't remember anything at all.
{9604}{9650}Just backwards in everything.
{9651}{9704}It was like having to start|all over again.
{9733}{9768}# Pictures of Lily... #
{9769}{9871}How does it get from the man|to the egg?
{9872}{9961}I actually got put back a year|'cause I was so stupid.
{9962}{10030}And I would never pay|any attention in class,
{10031}{10076}I was just always|daydreaming.
{10077}{10136}Steve was quite wild at 1 0,|1 1 years old.
{10137}{10202}I think he was always getting|into trouble then.
{10203}{10288}You should make sure that you've|got the thing around the right way.
{10289}{10386}On the other hand --|I got four fingers and a thumb.
{10387}{10459}I question everything,|I always have done.
{10460}{10503}If we were doing Shakespeare,
{10504}{10556}a teacher would give me|a hard time,
{10557}{10606}and he wouldn't tell me|what I wanted to know.
{10607}{10659}I'd ask outright questions,
{10660}{10705}and you're not supposed|to do that.
{10705}{10752}You're just supposed|to accept,
{10753}{10809}"lt's Shakespeare.|It's great, you're not."
{10810}{10845}That's not good enough|for me.
{10898}{10969}I would steal. I mean,|that's all I knew how to do.
{10969}{11066}I used to watch my parents steal|at Tescos when I was six.
{11067}{11115}And I was always|getting in trouble.
{11116}{11171}And so that's all|there was -- music.
{11172}{11253}# Flavors of the|mountain streamline... #
{11254}{11344}I was totally into music --|Roxy Music and Bowie.
{11345}{11422}I thought that musicians fell|from the sky at that point.
{11423}{11476}I didn't think anyone|could be a musician.
{11477}{11594}# School's out forever! #
{11595}{11700}I was very quiet at school|up until about 14 or 1 5,
{11701}{11752}when I decided|I'd had enough.
{11753}{11829}I knew we were being|fobbed off...
{11830}{11930}and basically given a shoddy|third-rate version of reality.
{11931}{12003}So you would not be capable|of questioning your future,
{12004}{12049}because you didn't have one.
{12194}{12277}My mother loved Alice Cooper|as much as I did.
{12277}{12361}She had an extremely|varied taste for everything
{12362}{12442}from lrish folk music|to T. Rex...
{12443}{12496}To some early Bowie.
{12497}{12564}Lots of the heavy metal|that was around at the time,
{12565}{12653}everything.|Extremely Catholic taste.
{12654}{12749}# I want all you skinheads|to get up on your feet #
{12750}{12833}# Put your braces together|and your boots on your feet #
{12834}{12910}There was a lot of black kids|down Shepherd's Bush,
{12911}{12960}and we used to go|to their parties
{12961}{13008}and listen to ska music.
{13009}{13054}It sort of developed|from there really,
{13055}{13110}I think, our interest|in music.
{13111}{13179}I think it was Wally...|the famous Wally Nightingale,
{13180}{13232}who said,|"Well, let's start a band."
{13233}{13300}At the time, Wally said|Steve would be the singer,
{13301}{13360}and I would be on drums.
{13361}{13440}Wally actually played guitar,|and so it was up to each of us
{13441}{13496}to go off and learn|our instruments.
{13497}{13548}We used to rehearse|and rehearse,
{13549}{13620}and just kind of like,|fantasize, really.
{13637}{13672}If I wanted to wear something
{13673}{13719}that T. Rex was wearing|the week before,
{13720}{13767}I'd go down King's Road|and fucking steal it.
{13800}{13877}I always used to end up|at "Let It Rock" which was owned
{13878}{13948}by Malcolm McLaren|and Vivienne Westwood.
{13949}{14001}All the other shops we went in|down King's Road,
{14002}{14057}you'd walk in and you'd get|1 0 poofs on you,
{14058}{14103}asking you what you want,|"Can I help you?"
{14104}{14157}That's why we'd always|end up at Vivienne's,
{14158}{14200}because it was|like a hang-out.
{14201}{14247}I liked the clothes,|they were different.
{14248}{14315}It weren't all flares|and kipper ties.
{14316}{14380}It was Teddy Boy clothes.|It was a lot more rebellious,
{14381}{14448}and obviously|I was drawn to that.
{14449}{14496}The Teddy Boy thing, for me,
{14497}{14555}was all about the idea|of being a peacock,
{14556}{14628}and standing out in the crowd,|but at the same time
{14629}{14706}feeling a sense that you are|part of the dispossessed,
{14707}{14782}which -- at the end|of my art school term,
{14783}{14832}I thought I could make|a profit by.
{14858}{14905}I became friends with Malcolm
{14906}{14980}because he had a lot|of contacts in music.
{14981}{15020}He seemed to know everybody.
{15021}{15073}He finds a way in|with his blague,
{15074}{15121}which is perfect|for a manager.
{15141}{15195}I walked up and down|the King's Road
{15196}{15280}with complete anger|and resentment.
{15310}{15366}People were extremely absurd,
{15367}{15462}and still stuck into flares|and platform shoes
{15463}{15527}and neatly coiffured|longish hair,
{15528}{15596}and pretending the world|wasn't really happening.
{15597}{15662}It was an escapism|that I resented.
{15663}{15710}There was also|a garbage strike
{15711}{15769}going on for years|and years and years,
{15769}{15827}and there was trash piled|1 0 foot high.
{15828}{15886}They seem to have|missed that.
{15887}{15979}Wear the garbage bag,|for God's sake --
{15980}{16053}and then you're dealing|with it.
{16054}{16113}And that's what I|would be doing...
{16113}{16194}I would wrap myself|basically in trash.
{16195}{16267}...and that so lamely|and unfashionable...
{16268}{16349}that dogs bark at me|as I halt by them.
{16350}{16432}I've got news for you.|Dogs bark at me.
{16475}{16578}In a weird way, that whole|persona of, say, "Richard Ill"
{16579}{16651}helped when I joined|the Sex Pistols.
{16652}{16745}Deformed, hilarious,|grotesque --
{16745}{16809}and the "Hunchback|of Notre Dame" is in there,
{16810}{16870}and just bizarre characters
{16871}{16947}that somehow or other,|through all of their deformities
{16948}{16991}managed to achieve something.
{16992}{17036}# ...Just for a short while #
{17037}{17084}# She'll scratch in the sand #
{17085}{17130}# Won't let go of his hand... #
{17131}{17198}Steve was a kind|of a kleptomaniac, really.
{17199}{17260}I'm sure he would be|diagnosed as that, you know,
{17261}{17324}because he couldn't keep|his hands in his pockets...
{17325}{17381}which was quite handy,|really.
{17382}{17453}We'd always know a way in round|the back of Hammersmith Odeon,
{17454}{17501}being our local area.
{17528}{17576}# The Jean Genie... #
{17577}{17659}David Bowie was playing|the Ziggy farewell thing,
{17660}{17729}and while the roadies|was asleep in the front row,
{17730}{17811}he'd be going around on stage|snipping all the microphones off.
{17812}{17880}We had great guitars,|amplifiers,
{17881}{17968}great drum kits,|PA system, everything,
{17969}{18033}but, you know, we couldn't|play it properly.
{18126}{18192}To prevent myself|from being beaten up
{18193}{18263}by what were Uxbridge|Teddy Boys
{18264}{18320}coming in,|pilfering in the store,
{18321}{18372}I decided to go down|another route --
{18373}{18432}rubber and leather|fetish wear.
{18433}{18465}I felt that...
{18466}{18559}that would look fun and exciting|on the King's Road
{18560}{18643}because it would have|a similar effrontery
{18644}{18749}that Teddy Boy clothes had,|except it would be new.
{18750}{18804}Malcolm's shop interested me
{18805}{18875}because of the rubber wear.
{18930}{19020}Fascinating that people can get|themselves into such a predicament
{19021}{19104}that the only way they can|have sex is in a face mask
{19105}{19165}and a rubber T-shirt.
{19199}{19252}With a bollock weight.
{19279}{19363}How does it become that way?|It becomes like that for you
{19364}{19455}because you just cannot|face reality.
{19546}{19590}Steve just came back one day,|and said,
{19591}{19635}"l found a bass player."|I said, "Who's that?"
{19636}{19704}He said, "This guy, Glen,|who works in Malcolm's shop."
{19705}{19769}Lo and behold, I started|rehearsing with them.
{19770}{19882}They had so much equipment that|Steve had "assembled," shall we say?
{19883}{19946}We were always pestering|Malcolm to manage us,
{19947}{20036}and he said he'd be interested|if we got rid of Wally.
{20037}{20095}He came down once, he said,|"You shouldn't sing,
{20096}{20160}you should play guitar.|You should get a singer."
{20161}{20229}We realized wally was gonna|have to go.
{20265}{20328}Alas, poor [ Wally ]...
{20329}{20388}I knew him, Horatio.
{20389}{20446}Round this time|there was a group of guys
{20447}{20497}who came from the north side|of London,
{20498}{20539}who used to come|into the shop
{20540}{20594}probably for the same reasons|we did,
{20595}{20630}you know, on a Saturday,|whatever...
{20631}{20701}there was the group of them,|apparently all called "John."
{20702}{20772}Steve and Paul never believed|we were all called John...
{20773}{20828}They could never take that.
{20829}{20876}Sid's real name is John.
{20877}{20918}Theyjust thought we were
{20919}{21001}Iike a "Clockwork Orange" gang,|you know -- "The Johns."
{21025}{21104}I've no idea why|they picked me out...
{21105}{21201}other than they thought I looked|well different from the pack.
{21226}{21287}We arranged to meet John|one night...
{21288}{21333}in a pubjust down the road.
{21334}{21413}We had a few pints, and then|we came back to the shop.
{21438}{21498}We gave the singer|an audition
{21499}{21578}in my shop, later on,|after the pub had closed,
{21579}{21629}for him to imitate,
{21630}{21701}and for him|to try to sing along
{21702}{21774}with an Alice Cooper track|on the jukebox
{21775}{21839}called "Eighteen",|which I adored.
{21840}{21924}And he sung it like|"The Hunchback of Notre Dame."
{21981}{22035}# I'm eighteen #
{22036}{22098}# And I don't know|what I want #
{22099}{22157}I always did view myself
{22158}{22229}as one damn ugly fucker.
{22230}{22319}I certainly weren't|no belle of the ball.
{22320}{22377}John just started...
{22377}{22442}going into spasms|in front of the jukebox,
{22443}{22496}and singing,|and doing his act,
{22497}{22565}what later became what everyone|knows and loves, you know.
{22591}{22668}And I knew right away then|that he was the singer.
{22669}{22740}He was... gonna be the one,|really.
{22764}{22819}I personally wouldn't|have got him in the band,
{22820}{22865}even though he looked|like a star.
{22865}{22954}I thought he was a wanker for taking|the piss, and he wasn't serious...
{22955}{23012}But then, after speaking to him|for a while,
{23013}{23071}I realize that|that was his own insecurity
{23072}{23146}to take the piss because|he wasn't really a singer.
{23193}{23253}John was from a different world|from me and Cookie.
{23253}{23318}He's more of an intellectual,|John.
{23347}{23411}I knew what Steve was.
{23412}{23512}I knew he had potential|to be a great person.
{23513}{23591}There's something in him|that's genuine.
{23592}{23704}I can see that there's a tragedy|in him, just like in me.
{23705}{23786}Deep down inside,|they're wounded people.
{23787}{23840}And then there's Glen...
{23841}{23936}waffling on about nice things|like the Beatles.
{23937}{24030}We're the very first people|to call each other cunts
{24031}{24074}outright --
{24075}{24138}face on --|and know it.
{24139}{24224}And we are. We all are...|All in our way.
{24225}{24276}You put all this|together, and it...
{24277}{24378}it makes for high drama,|a bit like a Harold Pinter play.
{24379}{24440}It shouldn't work,|but it does.
{25033}{25104}All our first rehearsals|were a nightmare.
{25105}{25165}I couldn't hold|a damn note,
{25166}{25253}Paul couldn't really keep time,|I couldn't play guitar.
{25254}{25346}I fucking hated it.|It was just a fucking noise,
{25347}{25429}but I just stuck in there,|because that's all I had.
{25430}{25483}# ...no lip, child #
{25484}{25553}# And I mean what I say #
{25588}{25648}# Don't give me|no lip, child #
{25649}{25719}# You'll be sorry one day #
{25720}{25799}Oh, fuck, it's awful.|I hate songs like that.
{25824}{25893}Right from the start,|we'd argue --
{25893}{25972}bitterly, bitterly,|from day one rehearsal,
{25973}{26023}pure, full-on row.
{26024}{26077}It would be constantly,
{26078}{26128}"You know, you've gotta|learn to sing."
{26129}{26180}And it's like, "Why?"
{26181}{26245}"Says who?|Who wrote the rules here?"
{26246}{26350}But that's all right, you need|that difference of character.
{26351}{26415}I didn't think,|if I could be a sculptor,
{26416}{26476}I necessarily needed clay...
{26477}{26572}I suddenly thought,|"You can use people!"
{26573}{26689}And it's people that I used,|like an artist.
{26690}{26756}I manipulated.
{26757}{26865}So, creating something|called the "Sex Pistols"
{26866}{26963}was my painting,|my sculpture,
{26964}{27010}my little "Artful Dodgers."
{27011}{27096}Humph --|you don't create me...
{27097}{27146}I am me.
{27147}{27194}There is a difference.
{27195}{27289}Everyone on the planet|knows Malcolm's full of shit.
{27290}{27356}He's convinced people now|that he's full of shit,
{27357}{27434}by all the shit that he says,|it gets worse and worse.
{27435}{27499}And the idea of the name|"Sex Pistols"
{27500}{27605}was sexy young assassins.|"Pistol" meaning a gun --
{27629}{27705}and then "pistol" meaning|a kind of penis.
{27706}{27798}There was never a relationship|with the manager -- for me,
{27799}{27874}other than he would always try|to steal my ideas,
{27875}{27924}and claim them|to be his own.
{27925}{27994}I had to accept|that he was the manager
{27995}{28085}because he was their manager|before I joined the band.
{28086}{28141}I think they're the same|fucking star sign.
{28142}{28195}They're the same kind|of personality.
{28196}{28241}They were always|butting heads.
{28242}{28309}It was definitely John|who steered the ship
{28310}{28350}into the way we looked.
{28351}{28436}Torn, safety pin,|zips all over the gaff,
{28437}{28488}third rate tramp thing.
{28489}{28564}That was poverty, really.|Lack of money.
{28565}{28620}The arse of your|pants falls out,
{28621}{28683}you just use safety pins.
{28684}{28735}And I always used|to call him "rotten,"
{28736}{28793}'cause his fucking teeth|were like, dreadful,
{28793}{28841}they looked like dog-ends,
{28841}{28900}and -- itjust stuck.
{28901}{28995}Steve always looked like|a hairdresser on the high road.
{28997}{29039}He had a perm,
{29040}{29097}and unfortunately,|it became permanent.
{29193}{29257}I don't have any heroes.
{29258}{29307}They're all useless.
{29308}{29361}I mean, there's no bands around,|is there?
{29362}{29402}None.
{29403}{29449}None that are accessible.
{29449}{29508}It's Emerson, Lake and Palmer.
{29620}{29672}All those super bands|at that time --
{29673}{29774}Emerson, Lake and Palmer,|Yes -- they were dinosaurs,
{29775}{29856}They were dreadful, because|they were fucking boring.
{29857}{29952}Uriah Heep...|Fucking, you know... Gong!
{29953}{30046}I wanted the Sex Pistols|to compete
{30047}{30102}with the Bay City Rollers!
{30103}{30204}Can you imagine Johnny Rotten|singing "Shang-a-Lang"?
{30234}{30288}# Shang-a-lang #
{30326}{30372}# Shang-a-lang #
{30396}{30448}# Shang-a-lang,|shang-a-lang #
{30449}{30492}Ugh-hh!
{30493}{30571}Stradivarius --|was a terrible painter...
{30683}{30747}and Rembrandt --|made rotten violins.
{30772}{30827}I got interested in the arts,
{30828}{30889}and ended up going|to St. Martin's for a year.
{30890}{30949}I walked in there and asked|to see the social secretary,
{30950}{30997}and this guy said,|"Well, I am."
{30998}{31052}And it was Sebastian Conran.
{31053}{31099}And he said, "Well, what's|the name of your band?"
{31100}{31157}And I said, "The Sex Pistols,"|and Sebastian went --
{31158}{31244}"The Sex Pistols?|Oh, we must have them."
{31273}{31356}I remembered being|just fucking terrified,
{31357}{31428}and I had to take a Mandrax|to calm down.
{31445}{31484}Hello.
{31509}{31567}Hello,|I'm pissed again.
{31568}{31640}I think I took two Mandrax.|We went up there,
{31641}{31713}and it was all these arty-farty|fuckers in this one room.
{31713}{31759}There was no stage,
{31760}{31815}and there was another band|called "Bazooka Joe"
{31816}{31861}that Adam Ant|was the bass player in,
{31861}{31914}and we were all|knocking the pints back --
{31915}{31986}and it was time to go on,|and the Mandrax were kicking in,
{31987}{32035}and we started playing...
{32056}{32128}# ...you to know|that I ain't your baby #
{32129}{32199}# I want you to know|I don't care #
{32330}{32385}I remembered looking|at John, and thinking,
{32386}{32444}"This is fucking fantastic.|I love this."
{32445}{32494}It was like one of them|magical moments.
{32495}{32573}Everything in the universe|fucking clicked.
{32574}{32633}# What'cha gonna do|about it... #
{32659}{32748}Glen definitely wanted to be|on "Top of the Pops."
{32777}{32850}# I want you to know|I don't care... #
{32851}{32924}# I want you to know|that I love you baby... #
{32925}{32974}To me, that's really naff.
{32975}{33055}It's saying, "l want you to know|I don't care"
{33056}{33118}Comes quite naturally.
{33119}{33199}If I take other people's songs,|I put a twist on them.
{33357}{33423}Finally -- we're actually|playing in a band,
{33424}{33493}I ain't the singer,|I'm comfortable playing the guitar --
{33493}{33541}mind you,|I was fucked up --
{33680}{33742}and next thing I know,|they've pulled the plug on us,
{33743}{33798}and it was all over.|We're just like out of it,
{33799}{33870}and wandering around|down Piccadilly Circus.
{33896}{33962}I die of nerves|before I go on stage,
{33963}{34033}cause I don't know|what I'm gonna do.
{34033}{34118}And because of that,|I'd have to just pull things out
{34119}{34195}from deep down inside.
{34196}{34304}Hello -- # 76 trombones|to the hit parade #
{34353}{34425}Look, there's Arthur Askey|in there.
{34426}{34500}There's Ken Dodd --|# We are the Daddymen... #
{34501}{34559}# We come from Notty Ash #
{34560}{34591}There's even...
{34592}{34652}"There's nothing wrong|with me."
{34653}{34702}- Do we know any...|- Oi...
{34703}{34775}Do we know any other|fucking songs that we could do?
{34776}{34858}What England didn't understand|about the Sex Pistols
{34859}{34922}is that we are music hall.
{34923}{34974}Shall we do "Roadrunner"?
{34999}{35072}I hate that.|It's fucking awful. Stop it.
{35073}{35136}Stop it,|it's fucking awful!
{35199}{35291}There was always a sense|of piss take, and fun to it.
{35292}{35365}Shout out what -- how it starts.|What's the first line?
{35366}{35452}There's a sense of comedy|in the English,
{35453}{35523}even in your grimmest moment.
{35524}{35579}Right-- can you start|at the beginning?
{35619}{35653}I can't hear you, Paul.
{35654}{35692}You laugh.
{35758}{35804}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35836}{35862}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35917}{35957}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35958}{35997}# With the radio on... #
{35998}{36031}"...Deform'd, unfinish'd..."
{36032}{36098}# Roadrunner, roadrunner...
{36141}{36201}"Deform'd, unfinish'd..."
{36260}{36316}Deform'd, unfinish'd...
{36354}{36420}One week we'd be|playing up in high Wycombe
{36421}{36472}opening up|for Screaming Lord Sutch,
{36473}{36560}and I remember seeing|some faces, guys with long hair.
{36561}{36640}"When all other indications|suggest..."
{36641}{36695}When all other indications|suggest...
{36696}{36769}Then, a week later,|we'd be playing at "The Nashville,"
{36808}{36872}...that we're in|for a dirty night.
{36905}{36937}"...a dirty night."
{36938}{37009}And I'd see the same people|with their hair cut short,
{37010}{37066}and wearing a ripped-up|t-shirt.
{37091}{37156}# Goin' a thousand miles|an hour #
{37173}{37255}Every gig you'd see a few more,|and a few more, and a few more,
{37256}{37311}people who just got converted.
{37442}{37561}The Sex Pistols definitely|created new environments.
{37620}{37751}It was incredible good to see|the audience being individual.
{37752}{37819}# ...radio on... #
{37820}{37876}# Roadrunner, roadrunner... #
{37877}{37916}"Ain't nothing wrong with me."
{37917}{37979}Oh, God, I don't know it.|Fucking ridiculous.
{37980}{38088}There was some absolutely stunning|original people out there.
{38118}{38160}"There's nothing wrong with me."
{38185}{38228}Sioux cat woman...
{38229}{38312}That woman required a lot|of skill, style and bravery...
{38356}{38407}to look like a cat.
{38639}{38687}There was a couple|of years there
{38688}{38732}where it was stunning.
{38733}{38846}People that had no self-respect|suddenly started to view themselves
{38847}{38924}as beautiful in|not being beautiful.
{38925}{39000}Women started|to appreciate themselves
{39001}{39059}as not second class citizens.
{39060}{39123}Punk made that clear.
{39187}{39242}I've always talked|to the audience
{39243}{39302}in a one-to-one way|after gigs.
{39303}{39368}"Where do you live?|What's life like for you?"
{39369}{39428}Absolute basics.
{39450}{39508}# She put her bicycle #
{39509}{39564}# under a tree #
{39565}{39647}# I think that girl took|a fancy to me... #
{39648}{39696}But it was fun, I guess,|talking to them.
{39697}{39766}Actually, I didn't give a|fuck about talking about the band,
{39767}{39829}I just wanted to get|me dick sucked, really.
{39830}{39896}That was always the first thing|on my mind.
{39897}{39972}I wasn't interested in talking|about politics after the show,
{39973}{40053}I didn't even know who the fucking|Prime Minister was at the time.
{40054}{40121}# Let's have a ride|on your bike #
{40122}{40187}I pretty much just wanted|to have a bunk-up,
{40188}{40252}Iike any good teenager does.
{40273}{40370}# I was born with a plastic|spoon in my mouth... #
{40577}{40656}# You didn't look me|in the eye #
{40657}{40745}# Crocodile tears|are what you cry #
{40844}{40889}"Substitute" I liked...
{40890}{40969}but I only liked|certain phrases in it.
{40970}{41017}So I'd twist them about.
{41017}{41095}# You're so fat,|I see right through... #
{41133}{41236}"Oh, no you can't do that,|it's a classic,"
{41237}{41278}says Glen.
{41359}{41400}Fuck off!
{41562}{41627}I think when we started|writing our own stuff...
{41628}{41690}is when it got|more interesting.
{41713}{41807}Because that's when it became|our own musical force.
{41862}{41944}Glen was coming up with most|of the ideas for songs,
{41945}{41996}and John would just be|sitting in the corner,
{41997}{42042}scribbling his lyrics out,|there and then,
{42043}{42078}while we were playing along|to it.
{42079}{42128}We had something,|we had a spirit.
{42129}{42185}But what we didn't have,|we didn't have a way
{42186}{42236}of putting that into words...
{42237}{42276}which is what John had.
{42277}{42381}The first line I wrote,|was "l am an antichrist,"
{42382}{42480}and I couldn't think of a damn|thing that rhymed with it,
{42481}{42572}and "anarchist" just fitted|really nicely.
{42591}{42643}The only thing I didn't like|about "Anarchy"
{42644}{42692}was the dreadful rhyme --
{42693}{42767}"antichrist -- anarchist,"|it used to always make me wince.
{42829}{42901}Oh, some decent fucking music|at last!
{43035}{43082}# Right... #
{43083}{43128}# Now #
{43258}{43341}# I am an antichrist #
{43342}{43428}# I am an anarchist #
{43429}{43518}# Don't know what I want,|but I know how to get it #
{43519}{43602}# I wanna destroy passerby #
{43603}{43680}# 'Cause l... #
{43681}{43746}# Wanna be... #
{43776}{43814}# Anarchy #
{43815}{43864}This band wasn't about|making people happy,
{43865}{43910}it was attack --
{43911}{43961}attack, attack, attack.
{43976}{44053}# Anarchy for the UK #
{44054}{44147}# It's coming sometime|maybe #
{44148}{44236}# I give a wrong time,|stop a traffic line #
{44237}{44323}# Your future dream|is a shopping scheme #
{44324}{44394}# 'Cause l... #
{44395}{44454}# I wanna be... #
{44489}{44556}# Anarchy #
{44748}{44836}Sid, he was the total|Pistols fan, really.
{44837}{44896}I fucking loved that band.
{44897}{44955}Along with a couple|of other kids that knew John,
{44956}{45046}I think I was about the biggest|fan they ever had.
{45169}{45263}# How many ways to get|what you want #
{45264}{45342}# I use the best|I use the rest... #
{45343}{45408}Rotten was like, incredible.
{45409}{45469}Just like unbelievable.
{45469}{45543}And Steve was fucking great|as well.
{45544}{45603}Glen was a cunt, as always.
{45604}{45688}# Wanna be... #
{45689}{45746}# Anarchy #
{45747}{45823}What made the Sex Pistols|different was John Rotten,
{45824}{45893}'cause he was a total|anti-star.
{45893}{45957}He didn't like wiggle his bum|or shake his hips,
{45958}{46036}he did robot dances,|and just fucked around,
{46037}{46087}and took the piss|out of everybody
{46088}{46158}in a real nasty, snidy way.
{46253}{46338}# ls this the MPLA #
{46339}{46435}# Or is this the UDA #
{46436}{46521}# Or is this the IRA #
{46522}{46614}# I thought it was the UK... #
{46689}{46773}The Bromley Contingent|all the front row lot,
{46774}{46828}they all ended up in bands,
{46829}{46913}hence you got|the punk movement.
{47038}{47117}# I am an antichrist #
{47118}{47192}# I am an anarchist #
{47193}{47269}To see us playing like,|just three chords
{47270}{47335}gave the message that anybody|could do this.
{47336}{47391}Which was great --|all these other bands started --
{47392}{47450}I enjoyed watching the Clash,|I enjoyed the Damned.
{47451}{47521}Itjust happened so quick,|and it was so exciting,
{47521}{47614}you'd think, "Wow, there's|really a movement starting here."
{47737}{47785}One chick came down|one night
{47785}{47867}wearing a polka dot|see-through mac --
{47868}{47920}and nothing else.
{47921}{48024}I actually saw one tourist|stagger as she came into the club.
{48025}{48086}He was so amazed|by her appearance.
{48187}{48239}Sid was amazing,|because he was
{48240}{48296}a stand out character|in the crowd,
{48297}{48334}because he wasn't|in the band then.
{48335}{48379}He invented the pogo|all by himself.
{48380}{48439}He'd just sort ofjump on|the shoulders of some people
{48440}{48480}to get a better look.
{48481}{48545}In the end he just started|jumping up and down anyway.
{48546}{48620}Yeah, I started it 'cause|I hated the Bromley Contingent,
{48621}{48670}and I invented a dance|that would involve
{48671}{48760}being able to knock them|all over the fucking "1 00 Club,"
{48761}{48824}so I just used to|throw myself about.
{48825}{48889}Leap up like horizontal,|and sideways,
{48890}{48932}just like boing...
{48933}{48977}Boing, boing, boing.
{48978}{49057}You'd like land on them,|and smash them into the floor.
{49081}{49119}Yeah...
{49120}{49171}My name is Nick Kent.
{49172}{49220}I'm a...
{49221}{49305}A once-renowned journalist|for "The New Musical Express."
{49306}{49362}Well, Sid,|as he was known then,
{49363}{49463}who I'd encountered once before,|I'd not actually met him --
{49464}{49533}was obviously under|the influence
{49533}{49592}of some sort of amphetamines
{49593}{49697}or extreme adrenaline|propulsing stimulants.
{49698}{49758}Sid Vicious was looking|for a fight.
{49759}{49818}Just fucking watch out, pal,|all right?
{49819}{49903}Or otherwise I'll fucking|slice you open.
{49904}{49968}He hit me over the head|a few times with a chain,
{49969}{50026}which didn't require|any stitches, fortunately.
{50027}{50092}I sort of wandered upstairs|in a complete...
{50093}{50177}Iather of blood|and confusion.
{50178}{50284}I truly admire|their attitude,
{50285}{50360}I thought it was...|very brave.
{50361}{50451}Immediately before this attack|occurred,
{50452}{50539}John Rotten was deep|in discussion with Sid.
{50540}{50659}I figure that John was --|"Johnny" -- as he's known,
{50660}{50728}was setting me up,|'cause this is all true.
{50729}{50800}In fact, Sid got the name|"Vicious" from that fight.
{50801}{50882}John Rotten christened him|"Vicious" from that fight.
{50883}{50949}Said he, falling|against the door.
{50950}{51034}Sid Vicious got the name|after my pet hamster,
{51035}{51094}that bit him one day...
{51095}{51156}when he was trying|to be sweet to it.
{51157}{51254}And its name was Sid,|and he really liked that.
{51279}{51344}"Your Sid was vicious."
{51345}{51425}The group were doing a very|private, I think, secret show,
{51426}{51479}at "The Screen on the Green,"|lslington.
{51509}{51580}I went along with a couple|of our A&R people,
{51581}{51629}and Chris Wright,|the chairman.
{51653}{51723}Knocked on the door, somebody opened|the door, and said, "Fuck off!"
{51785}{51827}Well we weren't gonna be|dissuaded,
{51828}{51909}so we sort of tapped on the door|again and said, "We're invited."
{51910}{51967}And a head popped 'round again,|and said, "Fuck Off!"
{52027}{52074}They were a particularly|ugly band.
{52075}{52158}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{52198}{52244}# We're vacant #
{52245}{52331}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{52371}{52409}# Vacant #
{52410}{52488}# Don't ask us to attend|'cause we're not all there #
{52489}{52557}# Don't pretend,|'cause I don't care #
{52558}{52629}And there was only a little bit|of a scuffle, nothing much.
{52787}{52839}I've known musicians|to defend themselves
{52840}{52893}if the thing goes|onto the stage,
{52894}{52944}But I've never seen musicians|drop their instruments
{52945}{53007}And sort of dive in|at a small scrap
{53008}{53068}And extend it,|and forget about the music.
{53069}{53119}And I found that a bit much.
{53204}{53271}I went back two or three times|after that,
{53272}{53324}just to make sure that...|you know, they were as bad
{53325}{53368}as I thought they were|the first time.
{53422}{53489}# ...and we don't care! #
{53529}{53575}Ever!
{53576}{53668}Why all the infamous|language?
{53669}{53721}"lnfamous language"?|You're joking.
{53722}{53796}I speak nothing but the fucking|English language.
{53797}{53890}And if that's "lnfamous,"|Then, huh-huh-huh, tough titters.
{53903}{53973}Basically, the Pistols'|attitude to the press
{53973}{54030}was one of completely|like "Fuck you," you know?
{54031}{54099}I mean, just absolutely|"Fuck you."
{54100}{54188}Which was great -- I mean,|it was the perfect antidote
{54189}{54301}to all the 99% of other|stupid rock groups
{54302}{54367}who like, licked the arse|of the press,
{54368}{54434}and, I mean, it worked|perfectly for them.
{54435}{54487}Mostjournalists|are masochists.
{54488}{54543}They're just toss pots,|most of them.
{54544}{54635}Don't accept the old order.|Get rid of it.
{54745}{54807}We've been there|for five years or more,
{54808}{54884}just waiting for this to happen,|and now it's happened.
{54885}{54944}It had to, it was the only thing|that could happen.
{54945}{54997}It was the only thing that|didn't come from the industry --
{54998}{55082}it came from the kids themselves.|Something had to come from the kids.
{55217}{55271}# Come on and join us #
{55272}{55330}# We're the young nation #
{55331}{55390}# Come on and join us #
{55391}{55444}# Nationwide... #
{55565}{55604}# Right... #
{55605}{55650}# Now #
{55790}{55871}# I am an antichrist #
{55872}{55958}# I am an anarchist... #
{55959}{56021}This group are leaders|of a whole new teenage cult
{56022}{56076}that seems to be on the way|to being as big
{56077}{56124}as mods and rockers were|in the '60s.
{56125}{56210}The cult is called "punk,"|the music, "punk rock."
{56211}{56307}Basic rock music --|raw, outrageous and crude,
{56308}{56372}Iike their fan magazine,|"Sniffing Glue."
{56373}{56420}I think our music|is very honest.
{56421}{56531}It's the most honest thing that's|been happening in the last 1 5 years.
{56532}{56563}Nothing to beat it.
{56564}{56633}Finding places to play|is becoming harder,
{56634}{56717}thanks to the reputation punks|are getting as troublemakers,
{56718}{56796}and the Sex Pistols themselves|even had to hire a strip club
{56797}{56882}to get their music heard.|Nowhere else would take them.
{57013}{57049}# Anarchy #
{57050}{57079}From the street.
{57190}{57254}I find the Pistols|very believable,
{57255}{57334}I find it's all related|to violence...
{57335}{57390}in the mind,|not in the body.
{57476}{57530}Malcolm began to get|a little bit serious about it,
{57531}{57602}and he brought in a lawyer|by the name of Fisher...
{57603}{57711}That dreadful lawyer whose name|I refuse to speak --
{57712}{57751}There was...
{57752}{57822}basically an auction|between Polydor and EMl.
{57823}{57888}We came up with a contract|which gave the Pistols
{57889}{57968}total creative control.
{58001}{58054}Malcolm decided|to go with EMl.
{58167}{58215}I went into the A&R department,|I said,
{58216}{58257}"Who are these crazy guys?"
{58258}{58309}They said, "lt's the Sex Pistols,|we just signed them.
{58310}{58338}They're tremendous."
{58339}{58395}And my first actual plug|for them was, after all this,
{58396}{58464}was by phoning up|the "Today" program.
{58465}{58508}They phoned back,|said, "Yes...
{58509}{58580}We'd like to use|the Sex Pistols," you know,
{58581}{58650}"Will that be okay?" I said,|"l'm sure it'll be all right."
{58651}{58733}They slung us in the green room,|with a fridge,
{58734}{58775}and I remember downing
{58776}{58832}about fucking four bottles|of "Blue Nun,"
{58833}{58907}and I was fucking just --|having a good old time,
{58908}{58986}pissed at this point,|by the time we went out there.
{58987}{59029}And that's all I remember.
{59030}{59130}They are "punk rockers."|the new craze, they tell me.
{59131}{59167}They are heroes --
{59168}{59244}not the nice, clean,|Rolling Stones.
{59245}{59316}They are as drunk as I am.|They are clean by comparison,
{59317}{59393}they are a group|called "the Sex Pistols,"
{59394}{59475}I am told that that group...
{59476}{59555}have received £40,000|from a record company.
{59556}{59613}Doesn't that seem to be|slightly opposed
{59614}{59685}to their anti-materialistic|view of life?
{59686}{59736}- No, the more, the merrier.|- Really?
{59737}{59777}- Oh, yeah.|- Tell me more about it.
{59778}{59809}We've fucking spent it.
{59810}{59875}- I don't know. Have you?|- Yeah, it's all gone.
{59876}{59950}No one even heard that one,|'cause he was drunk himself,
{59951}{59996}and he wasn't paying attention|when he asked,
{59997}{60075}"What did you do with the money?"|and I said, "We fucking spent it."
{60076}{60136}- Tell me more about it.|- We've fucking spent it.
{60137}{60204}- I don't know. Have you?|- Yeah, it's all gone.
{60205}{60256}- Really?|- Down the boozer.
{60257}{60296}Really?|Good Lord!
{60297}{60343}Now, I want to know|one thing:
{60344}{60419}Beethoven, Mozart, Bach|and Brahms have all died...
{60420}{60496}- They're all heroes of ours.|- Really? What were you saying?
{60497}{60540}- They're wonderful people.|- Are they?
{60541}{60614}- Yes, they really turn us on.|- But they're dead.
{60615}{60671}Suppose they turn|other people on?
{60672}{60716}That's just|their tough shit.
{60717}{60800}Rotten, he slipped up and said|"shit" under his breath.
{60801}{60864}- It's what?|- Nothing, a rude word.
{60865}{60916}- Next question.|- No, no...
{60917}{60964}What was the rude word?
{60965}{61028}- Shit.|- Was it really? Good heavens.
{61029}{61098}- You frighten me to death.|- All right, so you play games...
{61099}{61174}He's like your dad,|ain't he, this geezer?
{61175}{61203}Or your granddad.
{61204}{61253}Are you worried, or are you just|enjoying yourself?
{61254}{61295}- Enjoying myself.|- Are you?
{61296}{61331}That's what I thought.
{61332}{61387}- I always wanted to meet you.|- Did you really?
{61388}{61458}Siouxsie, she was just being|coy with him,
{61459}{61505}And he said,|"Oh, maybe we'll meet after?"
{61506}{61556}We'll meet afterwards,|shall we?
{61557}{61642}You dirty sod.|You dirty old man.
{61643}{61697}Steve completely understood
{61698}{61759}that he was talking|to a drunk
{61760}{61817}as you would a drunk|in a pub,
{61818}{61872}and he just topped him.
{61938}{61985}Go on, you've got|another five seconds,
{61986}{62043}- say something outrageous.|- You dirty bastard.
{62044}{62091}I just remember|this fucking cunt
{62093}{62160}just started provoking us,|and we coated him off.
{62161}{62211}- Go on -- again.|- You dirty fucker.
{62212}{62280}- What a clever boy.|- What a fucking rotter.
{62281}{62362}That's it for tonight.|The other rocker, Eamonn,
{62363}{62423}and I'm saying nothing else about|him, will be back tomorrow.
{62425}{62478}I'll be seeing you soon.|I hope I'm not seeing you again.
{62479}{62513}From me, though,|goodnight.
{62513}{62569}McLaren was there.|He was terrified.
{62570}{62613}He was shitting himself.
{62614}{62664}He was death-white,|you know, going
{62665}{62722}"We'd fucking better|get out of here, quick!"
{62723}{62789}But the very next day,|it was all his big idea.
{62858}{62952}It was perfect stand-up comedy.|It was Arthur Askey.
{62977}{63054}# Well, I don't mind|the things that you say #
{63055}{63137}# I don't even mind|goin' out of my way #
{63137}{63221}# I try and do|these things for you #
{63222}{63312}# Why should I do it?|I'm always untrue #
{63401}{63473}That's all, a four letter word|done everything.
{63527}{63592}# Goin' outta my head #
{63630}{63670}I loved it...
{63671}{63769}I fucking loved it.|It was like finally, I've arrived.
{63770}{63840}Let the circus begin.
{63894}{63977}# The bog is no place|to see your face... #
{63978}{64024}The committee have decided,
{64025}{64080}that in fairness|to the public of Derby,
{64081}{64169}the Sex Pistols will not|perform here tonight,
{64170}{64248}but we are quite agreeable|that the three other groups
{64249}{64326}that have already been booked|will go on.
{64355}{64415}For the last 1 2 months,|punk rock has become
{64417}{64476}almost a battle cry|in British society.
{64477}{64542}For many people, it's a bigger|threat to our way of life
{64543}{64606}than Russian Communism|or hyper-inflation,
{64607}{64701}and it generates more popular|excitement than either of those.
{64701}{64761}We hope tonight,|by this protest
{64762}{64851}to make Wales know, and to let|the people of this town know,
{64852}{64941}that we do protest|and it is by no fault of ours,
{64942}{64997}that this thing|has come to Caerphilly.
{64998}{65070}When your local council|didn't ban the punk rock concert,
{65071}{65133}you actually went down there|and tried to stop it yourself?
{65134}{65185}No, we never went|to stop it at any time.
{65186}{65237}We went there with a very|positive Gospel message.
{65238}{65304}We have done everything|humanly possible
{65305}{65352}to ban this thing|and to stop it.
{65353}{65401}Sir, can I ask you why|you're here tonight?
{65402}{65497}Because I am...|recognized as a Christian.
{65498}{65585}If I thought one of mine was|in there, I'd go drag them out.
{65586}{65666}They're outside, freezing.|We're in here, we're all right.
{65745}{65800}This one's about|Harold Wilson --
{65801}{65864}It's called "Liar."
{65865}{65907}# You lie, lie, lie,|lie lie... #
{65908}{66038}# Sleep in heavenly peace #
{66039}{66098}# Should have realized... #
{66133}{66197}On the "Anarchy" tour|we was actually followed
{66198}{66264}everywhere across the country,|from gig to gig,
{66265}{66352}and we had to turn up|to show willingness to play,
{66353}{66402}so presumably we would get|the money,
{66403}{66467}although it looked pound to a penny|that they wasn't gonna let us play.
{66528}{66604}Mr. Stabler, you can't watch|punk concerts in Newcastle either?
{66605}{66688}The decision was made when|we discovered it was mere children
{66689}{66746}that would be watching|the performance.
{66747}{66827}The average adult will go see|a strip show, or a blue film.
{66828}{66918}Banned in this town, and being|banned in that town.
{66919}{66990}And it really wasn't|about us playing any more,
{66991}{67063}it was about this controversy|that we were like,
{67064}{67129}throwing up on stage,|and spitting.
{67161}{67220}And I remember going|across the Pennines,
{67221}{67282}being followed by a fleet|of press people,
{67283}{67355}and we went to stop|to get coffee and a sandwich,
{67357}{67412}and we could hear what these|press people were saying.
{67413}{67450}One press guy|said to the other,
{67451}{67486}"Did you get anything?"|and the other one said,
{67487}{67548}"l got two 'fucks' and a 'shit'|from Johnny Rotten."
{67549}{67622}Can I now turn to Bernard|Brook-Partridge in London...
{67623}{67714}Most of these groups would be|vastly improved by sudden death.
{67715}{67779}The worst, currently,|are the Sex Pistols.
{67780}{67838}They are the antithesis|of humankind...
{67863}{67911}And the whole world|would be vastly improved
{67912}{67958}by their total and utter|non-existence.
{67959}{68016}# You're a liar #
{68058}{68117}# Lie, lie, lie, lie... #
{68139}{68212}The day Johnny Rotten goes back on|the words he writes in his songs,
{68213}{68265}is the day he dies.|I know that for a fact.
{68266}{68324}I think people did feel|that this was...
{68325}{68374}this was a sort of|a downhill thing,
{68375}{68452}and was a monster in our|presence, and actually would,
{68453}{68531}cause problems of image|for the record industry.
{68556}{68615}At that point, someone at EMI|took the decision
{68616}{68684}that they no longer wished|to have the act on the label.
{68757}{68804}This is about EMl.
{68851}{68929}They're major labels|with major attitudes,
{68930}{69028}and they want everything to be|fake and easily manipulative.
{69029}{69105}And you can't be having that|with people like us.
{69106}{69191}- Let's call it chaos!|- Itjust doesn't happen.
{69192}{69272}# An unlimited supply #
{69273}{69336}# And there is no reason why #
{69337}{69393}They told us|that they were unable
{69394}{69447}to continue|to promote the act --
{69448}{69492}and would we kindly leave.
{69529}{69570}# E-M-l #
{69571}{69615}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69616}{69656}# E-M-l #
{69657}{69696}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69697}{69740}# E-M-l #
{69741}{69781}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69871}{69905}Ouch.
{69906}{69989}# ...With an unlimited|supply #
{69989}{70078}# That was the only reason #
{70079}{70169}# We all had to say goodbye #
{70170}{70260}# Unlimited supply --|E-M-l #
{70261}{70343}# There is no reason why --|E-M-l #
{70344}{70394}# Unlimited supply #
{70395}{70428}# E-M-l #
{70429}{70475}# Hello, EMI #
{70476}{70538}# Good -- bye! #
{70573}{70667}It started with John and Glen|falling out, really.
{70669}{70716}Over what,|I don't really know,
{70717}{70768}just a clash of personalities,|et cetera.
{70769}{70824}When you talk|like an arsehole...
{70825}{70897}and look like an arsehole,|you're an arsehole.
{70898}{70976}There was obviously a big|problem between me and John.
{70977}{71039}I felt that once John|got his face in the papers,
{71040}{71093}he'd become|a different person --
{71094}{71135}which I didn't|particularly like.
{71136}{71223}When we went to Holland, my last|gig with them was at the Paradiso.
{71224}{71282}I felt everybody|was on my case.
{71283}{71359}He was always complaining|that we were too outrageous,
{71360}{71436}and it's a funny thing,|but he was always washing himself.
{71437}{71485}Whenever we'd get|into a hotel,
{71486}{71560}he'd be washing his|fucking feet in the sink.
{71561}{71609}Me and Steve were like that,|I suppose,
{71610}{71657}and John always felt|on the outside.
{71658}{71720}He thought by bringing Sid in,|he would have someone there,
{71721}{71765}Iike a partner, you know?
{71766}{71808}Someone a bit closer to him.
{71852}{71891}I'd heard that they'd been|rehearsing with Sid.
{71892}{71944}Nobody had the courtesy|to tell me.
{72077}{72149}# I've seen you in the mirror|when the story began #
{72150}{72221}# And I fell in love with you|I love your mortal sin... #
{72222}{72276}It had become like|a cartoon strip band,
{72277}{72349}as opposed to a rock and roll|band that actually plays
{72350}{72389}and does something for real.
{72390}{72443}# I got no emotions|for anybody else #
{72444}{72510}# You better understand|I'm in love with myself #
{72525}{72601}Glen had reached a point|where he decided
{72602}{72688}that the band's direction|was absolutely alien
{72689}{72752}to anything he wanted|to be associated with.
{72753}{72794}That's absolute bollocks.
{72795}{72868}I think one of Malcolm's games|was, sort of divide and conquer.
{72869}{72921}Malcolm had told John|I'd said a lot of stuff
{72922}{72972}which I hadn't said,|and Malcolm had told me
{72973}{73036}John had said a lot|of stuff that he hadn't said.
{73062}{73128}I respect him.|I always did.
{73129}{73177}He taught them to play.
{73177}{73240}I kind of regretted|him leaving...
{73241}{73312}because Sid couldn't play|a fucking note.
{73313}{73388}# ...see his picture hanging|on your wall #
{73513}{73591}I feel guilty about Sid,
{73592}{73704}because I wish I could have|told him more...
{73705}{73759}about what to expect.
{73804}{73875}Well... I was getting|my own group together,
{73877}{73923}"The Flowers of Romance,"
{73924}{73986}and Rotten asked me|if I wanted to join the --
{73987}{74034}there was this big hoo-ha,|and Malcolm said,
{74035}{74092}"lt's all a big secret, man,"|you know...
{74093}{74159}"Come down to this pub|at such and such and that,"
{74160}{74217}and I thought they were|gonna do me over
{74218}{74298}'cause I didn't turn up to one|of Rotten's parties or something.
{74299}{74364}He gets touchy|over things like that.
{74365}{74423}And... I went down there|and he said,
{74424}{74468}"Do you wanna play bass|for the Sex Pistols?"
{74823}{74896}# Turn the page and it's|the scoop of the century #
{74897}{74981}# Don't wanna be I seven|I've had enough of this #
{74982}{75063}# This is brainwash|and this is a clue #
{75064}{75144}# To the stars|who fooled you #
{75177}{75217}Sid was my mate.
{75218}{75266}Very, very close mate.
{75267}{75312}He'd just --|Iaugh at everything.
{75338}{75422}Genius in that way,|and his name was John.
{75552}{75628}# I got you in the camera,|I got you in my camera #
{75629}{75713}# A second of your life|ruined for life #
{75714}{75782}We'd do lots of mad things|together, me and Sid.
{75783}{75836}We used to busk too,|for money...
{75861}{75917}Me with a violin,|Sid with a tambourine,
{75918}{76000}maybe a broken guitar,|doing Alice Cooper songs.
{76001}{76049}"l Love the Dead"|was our favorite.
{76050}{76098}That would get us|the most money.
{76099}{76153}"Just please shut up."
{76154}{76204}"Here -- take the money,|go somewhere else."
{76340}{76418}Why dost thou spit --|at me?
{76489}{76584}The best time of the band of all|was when Sid firstjoined,
{76585}{76669}and he was really determined|to learn the bass
{76670}{76708}and fit in and be part|of the band.
{76709}{76763}He definitely looked great,|Sid...
{76764}{76827}Yeah, he definitely was a face.|A real laugh.
{76828}{76884}He used to take the piss|out of Rotten.
{76885}{76936}All I did was cash in|on the fact
{76937}{77007}that I'm good-looking,|and I have a good figure,
{77008}{77055}and girls like me.
{77057}{77147}What do they want, a fucking|angel in flares and an anorak?
{77148}{77201}'Cause if they want that...
{77202}{77264}that ain't me, baby.
{77326}{77378}Found myself in this rather|curious little shop,
{77379}{77437}in the company of Johnny Rotten,|Sid Vicious,
{77438}{77503}and other assorted|Sex Pistols.
{77504}{77536}Hello, Mr. Nimmo.
{77703}{77755}And the last they heard,|a donkey had him cornered
{77756}{77794}up a back alley in Fulham.
{77870}{77938}After EMI dumped|the Sex Pistols,
{77939}{77984}A&M Records picked them up,
{77985}{78040}and staged a contract signing|ceremony
{78041}{78088}in front of Buckingham Palace.
{78089}{78159}Malcolm was honest|in one respect...
{78160}{78251}That he always said|he had no control over us.
{78252}{78291}And he didn't.
{78292}{78375}And a bloody good punch-up,|in a limo,
{78376}{78483}before a signing|was not really unusual.
{78509}{78563}It was a good fight, too.
{78564}{78612}"No, you're the biggest cunt,"
{78613}{78661}"No, you're the worst cunt,"
{78661}{78722}"No, you're the cunt,"|et cetera, et cetera.
{78723}{78792}There was only one cunt|I wanted to smack,
{78793}{78859}and that was Malcolm.|Then the door opened,
{78860}{78908}and then we had to do|the signing.
{78933}{78979}At this point,|the Sex Pistols,
{78980}{79056}despite having been fired,|were not exactly suffering.
{79057}{79108}Here they were,|signing a new contract
{79109}{79151}that could make them|a lot of money,
{79152}{79223}and they already had a song|to record for A&M
{79225}{79276}in honor of the Queen's|jubilee.
{79277}{79352}Sid's father|was a Grenadier guard.
{79353}{79450}Imagine that -- Sid signing|a very, very expensive contract,
{79451}{79550}while his old man's on guard|inside the fence.
{79551}{79605}It was genius.
{79653}{79735}According to the story,|after this happy signing ceremony,
{79737}{79816}everyone went back to|the A&M offices to celebrate.
{79845}{79913}The four Sex Pistols|apparently overcelebrated,
{79914}{79964}and lived up to|their public image
{79965}{80019}of thorough obnoxiousness.
{80020}{80052}- How are you doing?|- Get away.
{80053}{80096}When we got to A&M records,
{80097}{80150}total bedlam broke out there|as well.
{80151}{80193}I can't remember|what happened,
{80194}{80239}but the secretaries|were terrified,
{80240}{80291}and Sid's foot|was bleeding.
{80292}{80373}I had a black eye,|Malcolm was running around,
{80374}{80439}Steve was flirting|with all the secretaries,
{80440}{80511}and then we got in the car,|then went to the studio,
{80512}{80571}where we were recording "God Save|the Queen" with Chris Thomas,
{80572}{80648}and there's this school next door,|and all the kids come running out
{80649}{80706}'cause we were there.|And they called the police as well.
{80707}{80751}It was just total mad day.
{80752}{80800}The next day we woke up,|Malcolm said,
{80801}{80857}"Well, A&M have fired you."
{80898}{80952}The anti-establishment|Sex Pistols
{80953}{81002}called in|the establishment press
{81003}{81048}to protest|what had happened to them.
{81049}{81123}We feel that we're like|some contagious disease.
{81124}{81165}When you walk|in and out of a company,
{81166}{81215}and the guyjust gives you --|"Look... Take this money
{81217}{81263}and don't come back."
{81264}{81317}What are you supposed|to think about that?
{81318}{81351}Have you had the money?
{81352}{81416}Yes, they gave us the check|last night.
{81417}{81480}Makes it very clear|where their heads are at...
{81501}{81521}Nowhere.
{81522}{81596}We weren't the nice boys|they thought we were.
{81597}{81646}We aren't nice boys.
{81647}{81714}We were fucking|nasty little bastards.
{81756}{81793}And we still are.
{81821}{81857}Virgin Records signed them,
{81858}{81895}and Johnny Rotten|got to record
{81897}{81950}his Queen's jubilee|memorial song --
{81951}{81996}"God Save the Queen."
{82033}{82082}You don't write|"God Save the Queen"
{82083}{82148}because you hate|the English race.
{82149}{82221}You write a song like that|because you love them,
{82222}{82305}and you're fed up|with them being mistreated.
{82782}{82852}# God save the Queen #

{85272}{85318}# God saves #
{85521}{85583}I really don't think what he|was singing about was outrageous.
{85584}{85651}He's not saying "Let's kill her,"|or "Let's fuck her."
{85652}{85712}He was pointing out|what the truth was.
{85733}{85769}# God save the Queen #
{85807}{85855}# We mean it, man #
{85893}{85937}# There is no future #

{86992}{87044}# No future #
{87045}{87114}# No future for you #
{87292}{87356}It alienated|the entire country.
{87357}{87431}If they'd have hung us|at traitor's gate,
{87432}{87511}it would have been applauded|by 56 million.
{87605}{87686}You can't beat that, man.|That's National Gallery status.
{87731}{87790}It's raining silver|in "The Sun" this week.
{87825}{87870}"God Save the Queen"
{87871}{87948}was the alternative|national anthem.
{87989}{88044}What we offered to England...
{88045}{88072}was...
{88124}{88189}a pivotal point.|We were the maypole
{88190}{88243}that they danced around.
{88295}{88394}# Go away, I hate you,|hate you, hate you #
{88395}{88486}# Go away, I hate you,|far across the sea #
{88614}{88685}Where better to celebrate|the release of "God Save the Queen"
{88686}{88737}than down the Thames,|and start playing
{88738}{88769}outside the Houses|of Parliament?
{88770}{88862}"God Save the Queen," and|"Anarchy in the UK" on Jubilee Day.
{88923}{88978}I just wanted out|of the country --
{88979}{89029}and there was no way out.
{89103}{89160}Ever get the feeling|you've been trapped?
{89198}{89245}This is obscene,|the whole thing.
{89276}{89311}All of this,|it's bullshit.
{89347}{89407}Well, I've had enough|of your bullshit.
{89424}{89476}I'm too cold now.|I'm going back downstairs.
{89505}{89568}I loved it. I was getting|my 20 quid a week,
{89569}{89610}thinking everything|was great.
{89611}{89671}I didn't wanna fucking deal|with the business side of it,
{89672}{89713}I didn't really question it.
{89714}{89775}I was McLaren's friend|before the band,
{89777}{89838}so I trusted McLaren|like a friend.
{90202}{90280}# Too many problems|why am I here #
{90281}{90360}# Don't need to be me|'cause you're all too clear #
{90361}{90447}# I can see there's something|wrong with you #
{90448}{90521}# But what do you|expect me to do? #
{90522}{90605}# At least I gotta know|what I wanna be #
{90605}{90691}# Don't come to me|if you need pity #
{90692}{90776}# Are you lonely|you got no one #
{90777}{90858}# You get your body|in suspension #
{90859}{90916}# That's no problem #
{90944}{90998}# Problems #
{91028}{91136}# Problems|the problem is you #
{91137}{91199}The reason we're here|is because it's the Sex Pistols.
{91200}{91258}If it wasn't the Sex Pistols|there'd be no interest in this,
{91259}{91298}in this... boat tonight.
{91299}{91382}Look, we've got Richard Branson|looking like "Catweazel."
{91446}{91512}# They know a doctor|gonna take you away #
{91513}{91597}# They take you away|and throw away the key #
{91598}{91670}# They don't want you|and they don't want me #
{91671}{91749}# You got a problem... #
{91786}{91825}What happened to Malcolm?
{91869}{91938}# Problems, problems #
{91939}{92004}# Problems, problems #
{92005}{92050}# Problems, problems... #
{92177}{92241}# Problems... problems... #
{92328}{92380}# Problems... problems. #
{92453}{92525}We declared war on england...
{92526}{92603}without meaning to.
{92604}{92671}At eight, the Muppets'|"Halfway Down the Stairs,"
{92672}{92733}at seven, the Alessi Brothers|and "O, Lori,"
{92734}{92793}at number six,|Emerson, Lake and Palmer
{92794}{92841}and "Fanfare|for the Common Man,"
{92842}{92894}at five, The Electric Light|Orchestra, "Phone Line,"
{92895}{92944}four --|Stranglers and "Peaches,"
{92945}{92987}three --|Queen, "Lover Boy,"
{92988}{93046}and two,|Eagles, "Hotel California,"
{93047}{93107}the Sex Pistols' current record|"God Save the Queen"
{93108}{93160}is at number one|in the Capital Hit Line today.
{93161}{93237}But the IBA, which administers|the broadcasting act
{93238}{93310}has advised us that|particularly at this time,
{93311}{93368}this record is likely|to cause offense
{93369}{93411}to a number|of our listeners,
{93412}{93480}and have asked us not to play it|in our normal programming.
{93481}{93540}"God Save the Queen"|was never number one.
{93541}{93603}There was no number one|that week.
{93664}{93724}Whatever we were saying|and doing
{93725}{93815}really hit a nerve,|a raw nerve.
{93816}{93868}It was fucked up.
{93869}{93931}I still had to bunk|on the subways,
{93932}{93975}couldn't afford a cab,
{93976}{94069}and all of that the management|didn't want to deal with.
{94070}{94136}Completely|from there on in,
{94137}{94188}walking around|the streets of London
{94189}{94241}on my own,|was impossible.
{94242}{94313}I would be attacked|on sight.
{94328}{94414}You felt like a werewolf|being, like hounded.
{94477}{94558}Constantly in fear|of your life, really.
{94623}{94676}"God Save the Queen",|eh, John?
{94876}{94963}I got a machete blade|ripped down this leg,
{94964}{95047}and the blade stuck|in my kneecap...
{95049}{95102}and they couldn't|pull it out,
{95103}{95160}so I had to like,|walk off with that.
{95161}{95248}I got a stiletto blade|through my wrist here,
{95249}{95355}Iucky not to have had|one of my eyes gouged out,
{95357}{95421}'cause a bottle|was shoved in here.
{95422}{95456}Got to the hospital...
{95457}{95520}first thing they do|is call the police.
{95521}{95652}And I get arrested for|"suspicion of causing an affray."
{95653}{95722}And the telephone call|from the editor...
{95723}{95812}who would say, "Malcolm,|we'll print anything,
{95813}{95865}'cause you sell more papers
{95866}{95920}than we ever did|on Armistice Day."
{95927}{96005}It's 7:00 on Wednesday,|the 1 7th of August.
{96006}{96079}Elvis Presley, at one time|known to millions
{96080}{96120}as "The King|of Rock and Roll,"
{96121}{96178}has died suddenly|at the age of 42.
{96179}{96232}The king of rock and roll|died yesterday.
{96233}{96301}He was found face down|on a bathroom floor.
{96302}{96344}There had been|numerous reports
{96345}{96398}that Presley|was a heavy drug user.
{96399}{96440}All that time|when Malcolm was saying,
{96441}{96508}"We can't get gigs in the UK,"|we could have played abroad.
{96509}{96572}We could have fucking done that,|couldn't we, Julien?
{96573}{96671}Who needs the fucking UK?|It's a load offucking shit.
{96715}{96786}Got a lot of wax|in my ears today.
{96799}{96860}So we were left doing nothing.|I was just sitting there,
{96861}{96924}with -- Iike, we didn't even|fucking rehearse,
{96925}{96984}nobody wanted to fucking|rehearse or do anything.
{96985}{97068}So, like, you know --|it's a logical conclusion,
{97069}{97122}d'you know what I mean?|Boredom...
{97123}{97235}And, like, I'm that way inclined|so what do I turn to?
{97236}{97299}No, I couldn't take them off.
{97306}{97376}My nose is broken,|I'm keeping them on.
{97377}{97459}And she showed up with Sid,|and I was thinking,
{97461}{97552}"Who the fuck is this cunt?|This is an 'orrible person."
{97553}{97600}It was like,|the weirdest thing...
{97601}{97678}I'd never felt such|a negative energy from someone.
{97679}{97742}There was just a dark cloud...
{97743}{97809}Over this bird,|and I fucking hated her.
{97810}{97871}The first time|I came across Nancy,
{97873}{97930}I think Steve was shagging her|in the toilet.
{97931}{97988}I didn't like her.
{97989}{98064}Nancy was a hooker...
{98065}{98166}That was on the coattails|of the "New York Dolls."
{98208}{98289}And I actually introduced her|to Sid.
{98290}{98344}Shame on me.
{98379}{98460}In New York I was dancing|without any clothes on.
{98461}{98520}I used to go down to the guys|and dance in front of them,
{98521}{98566}and then get|tips off them,
{98567}{98610}and you'd do|a little hand job, you know,
{98611}{98671}for... ten bucks,|or they wanted to fuck.
{98705}{98752}I just -- you know...
{98781}{98843}did it, you know, I just --
{98844}{98885}there wasn't really|anything to it,
{98886}{98950}I just give good blowjobs.
{99011}{99067}"lt'll rip your balls off."
{99068}{99127}I read the first Sex Pistols|review,
{99128}{99187}which was shit, and I said,|"l gotta get over there."
{99189}{99256}I wanted to see|something exciting.
{99270}{99388}Nancy, as his heroin dealer/|girlfriend...
{99389}{99506}Was pumping him up with gear|every chance she could get.
{99507}{99567}He didn't like me|'cause I was ajunkie.
{99568}{99643}He tried to keep me and Sid|apart for months,
{99644}{99688}months, months.
{99689}{99760}Everyone knows when a bird|starts poking her nose
{99761}{99827}into a rock and roll band,|that it's suicidal.
{99828}{99886}'Cause that's when he really|started getting fucked up,
{99887}{99934}and not caring about playing.
{99935}{99977}And I didn't want|anything to do with her.
{99978}{100025}We did everything|to get rid of Nancy
{100026}{100078}that was physically|possible.
{100079}{100127}I even dangled her
{100129}{100206}out of a window one night,|by her ankles.
{100207}{100271}And the rest of the band|hated me...
{100272}{100328}'cause I was with|the New York Dolls --
{100329}{100379}Johnny and Jerry,|and they were junkies.
{100380}{100420}# Fix #
{100421}{100477}# My baby... #
{100621}{100677}They definitely brought|a lot of heroin around, too.
{100678}{100755}And I know Sid was totally into|Johnny Thunders.
{100756}{100806}I like the New York Dolls,
{100807}{100895}'cause they were nasty and mean,|and they wore makeup,
{100896}{100935}and they didn't|give a shit.
{100936}{100990}And they played|godawful rock and roll.
{100991}{101056}And they had good names,|and good hairdos.
{101057}{101113}It definitely had|a big effect on me.
{101114}{101160}I thought he was|the coolest thing ever --
{101161}{101202}Thunders, at that time.
{101203}{101251}I started stealing|some of his stances,
{101253}{101305}and his looks, and, you know,|his moves on stage.
{101306}{101367}I look back at it now,|and I'm embarrassed
{101369}{101428}at how much I fucking was trying|to copy him.
{101429}{101492}I didn't need to do that.|I had my own thing already.
{101493}{101556}My invention|to the Sex Pistols
{101557}{101600}was the hanky on the head.
{101622}{101696}It was kind offunny, actually,|when I used to see fans doing it,
{101697}{101757}I thought, "Oh, look, they're|doing something I invented."
{101758}{101807}Cunt, shit, bollocks.
{101808}{101854}Bill Grundy's a poof!
{101855}{101921}Because I've made my self-esteem|rise an inch.
{101955}{102032}Leatherjackets|came with the heroin.
{102033}{102132}Vampirish goth look|came with the heroin.
{102133}{102188}This ruined Sid...
{102189}{102246}Here, want one of these?
{102247}{102316}Because he was a complete|gullible fashion victim.
{102337}{102423}Sid went straight into the worst|kind of rock and roll idiot
{102424}{102484}you could ever hope to have|a nightmare about.
{102521}{102583}He didn't get that|what we were doing was --
{102584}{102641}Who wants|some safety pins?
{102642}{102694}Our culture,|our life.
{102741}{102779}Who else wants|something?
{102781}{102841}Come on if you want|something, you cunts!
{102894}{102982}Alls I can tell you is yes,|I can take on England,
{102983}{103055}but I couldn't take on|one heroin addict.
{103057}{103122}Oh, look, Sid.
{103202}{103270}At a time where we should have|been the tightest,
{103271}{103328}it couldn't be looser.
{103483}{103563}# There's no point in asking,|you'll get no reply #
{103564}{103647}# Oh, just remember|I don't decide #
{103649}{103725}# I got no reason,|it's all too much #
{103726}{103793}# You'll always find us #
{103842}{103892}# Out to lunch #
{103940}{104018}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{104049}{104098}# We're vacant #
{104099}{104152}It's a pity in a way.|All these rich kids...
{104153}{104233}Becoming punks.|I find that revolting.
{104234}{104276}It's like an army now,
{104277}{104354}a faction -- chic.
{104355}{104402}I'm not chic.
{104403}{104462}I could never be chic.
{104463}{104515}I was in it|from its inception.
{104516}{104597}# There's no point in asking,|you'll get no reply #
{104598}{104683}# Just remember|I don't decide #
{104685}{104713}The punks ruined it...
{104714}{104820}They adopted a uniform image|in attitude,
{104821}{104915}and the whole thing|was about being yourself.
{104972}{105056}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty... #
{105057}{105127}# Ah... vacant #
{105142}{105232}The cliche punk look|which became the postcard punk
{105233}{105303}with a Mohican, and all black,|with spiky hair and all that.
{105304}{105350}It was never like that|to start with.
{105351}{105402}They didn't have|the money
{105403}{105449}to go out and buy|a 50 quid leatherjacket
{105450}{105520}it was very much a do-it-yourself|kind of thing, you know?
{105548}{105600}# ...and we don't care #
{105654}{105706}And all those garbage,|trashy bands --
{105707}{105768}basically all saying,|"Yeah, we're a punk band,"
{105769}{105881}wrecked it outright.|It became acceptable --
{105882}{105943}absorbed back into|the system.
{105944}{105993}The shitstem.
{106069}{106128}# We're pretty... #
{106136}{106174}# Pretty vacant #
{106175}{106197}I'm a punk!
{106198}{106262}# And we don't care! #
{106372}{106419}Mummy, mummy, come quick!
{106450}{106489}They've killed Bambi!
{106531}{106590}"Who killed Bambi"|was Malcolm's idea.
{106591}{106672}We were musicians.|We didn't want to make a film.
{106702}{106773}Malcolm was very good at|spending other people's money.
{106774}{106829}But there was a load|being put into the film
{106830}{106896}from the band's royalties,|which we didn't know about.
{106968}{107038}I rememberjust turning up|to do a scene...
{107039}{107092}there was this guy there, I thought,|"Oh, he looks familiar..."
{107093}{107156}Do you know the way|to Hindley Airfield, mate?
{107157}{107200}And I said,|"l know you from somewhere,"
{107201}{107241}and it was Sting.
{107242}{107314}It was his motion picture debut,|I believe.
{107315}{107379}So it's flying lessons|you're after, is it?
{107409}{107518}Well, you've come|to the right place, Sex Pistol.
{107519}{107570}Be advised,|drummer boy...
{107571}{107659}We're the sensational|new Blow Waves,
{107660}{107716}and we know how to sell|more records
{107717}{107768}than Malcolm McLaren.
{107769}{107820}And I knew|that it was just trash,
{107821}{107902}rubbishing|the whole point and purpose.
{107903}{107963}We believe|in rock and roll,
{107964}{108030}and we don't need you,|Sex Pistol.
{108031}{108079}The record companies know
{108080}{108125}that our music|means more to them
{108126}{108184}than your sick anarchy|ever did.
{108185}{108228}Get out of my car,|you cunts!
{108229}{108279}He used to really|get the hump, McLaren,
{108280}{108324}when we started asking|for money,
{108325}{108365}so I stopped asking for it.
{108366}{108426}We never had our own lawyer,|which is insanity.
{108427}{108511}That's the closest thing to being|in one of these boy bands --
{108513}{108568}is that they all get reamed,
{108569}{108643}and we were getting reamed|in that department.
{108644}{108718}How can you be a Sex Pistol|with no money?
{108719}{108801}You ring the office,|you get zero response,
{108802}{108875}your checks weren't paid,
{108876}{108980}no rent, no earnings,|a complete disaster.
{108981}{109088}It was wonderful.|"God Save the Queen"!
{109089}{109152}It was a monkey's tea party.
{109153}{109212}What the fuck|was the manager doing?
{109213}{109295}The one that claimed that|he was manipulating everything --
{109296}{109355}manipulated nothing.
{109356}{109416}He was clueless at that point.
{109417}{109473}Once we said,|"We're fucking leaving the group
{109474}{109556}unless you fucking get us some gigs,|you stupid little cunt,"
{109557}{109613}he got something together|the next day.
{109614}{109665}Well, he could have done that|all the time.
{109666}{109759}"Spots" was a good one --|Sex Pistols on tour.
{109760}{109822}But I thought it was dreadful|that we had to, like,
{109823}{109904}not be ourselves, and go|under secret monikers.
{109905}{109981}I'm a Sex Pistol,|and that's it.
{110122}{110186}And we just did these secret|gigs in the small clubs,
{110187}{110264}and it was just packed with fans|who'd never seen us.
{110265}{110306}And they were like|the best shows, man.
{110307}{110352}They were fucking great.
{110524}{110596}# A cheap holiday|in other people's misery #
{110747}{110821}# I don't want a holiday|in the sun #
{110822}{110899}# I wanna go|to the new Belsen #
{110900}{110974}# I wanna see some history #
{110975}{111046}# 'Cause now I got|a reasonable economy #
{111047}{111128}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{111129}{111209}# Now I got a reason,|and I'm still waiting #
{111210}{111284}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{111285}{111344}# To be waiting #
{111344}{111403}# The berlin wall #
{111594}{111697}I thought "Holidays in the Sun"|was our crowning glory.
{111761}{111843}# Sensurround sound|in a two-inch wall #
{111844}{111924}# I was waiting|for the communist call #
{111925}{112007}# I didn't ask for sunshine|and I got World War Ill #
{112008}{112097}# I'm looking over the wall|and they're looking at me #
{112098}{112164}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{112165}{112246}# Now I got a reason,|and I'm still waiting #
{112247}{112325}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{112326}{112375}# To be waiting #
{112376}{112431}# The Berlin Wall #
{112749}{112824}Huddersfield, I remember|very fondly.
{112825}{112891}Two concerts, a matinee,
{112892}{112972}with children|throwing pies at me,
{112972}{113071}and later on that night,|striking union members.
{113072}{113131}It was heaven.
{113132}{113196}He wants dad back at work,
{113197}{113268}which I think|is a very good idea, indeed.
{113269}{113315}It was like|our Christmas party, really.
{113316}{113370}I remember everyone being|really relaxed that day.
{113371}{113423}Everyone was getting on|really well,
{113424}{113473}and everyone|was in such a great mood.
{113474}{113527}'Cause it was a benefit|for the kids
{113528}{113586}offiremen who were on strike|around that time,
{113587}{113638}and who'd been on strike|for a long time.
{113639}{113693}And I've written|to Santa Claus today,
{113694}{113746}and I have got you|a skateboard.
{113747}{113800}Lot of love in the house,
{113801}{113877}and Sid was great that day.
{113878}{113971}Everything about it|was just wonderful.
{114013}{114109}Okay, gang, this party|is given to you absolutely free
{114110}{114179}and at the expense|of the Sex Pistols,
{114180}{114225}so let's have a big cheer|for the Sex Pistols.
{114226}{114258}Come on, let's hear you!
{114673}{114743}# She was a girl|from Birmingham #
{114744}{114817}# She just had an abortion #
{114818}{114896}# She was a case|of insanity #
{114896}{114974}# Her name was pauline,|she lived in a tree #
{114975}{115046}# She was a no one|who killed her baby #
{115047}{115125}# She sent her letter|from the country #
{115126}{115191}# She was an animal #
{115192}{115265}# She was a bloody disgrace #
{115266}{115332}# Body #
{115332}{115391}# I'm not an animal #
{115425}{115494}# Body #
{115495}{115542}# I'm not an animal #
{115575}{115634}It's not a question|of an Ml5 blacklist,
{115635}{115701}there are certain groups|whom we do not regard with favor,
{115702}{115763}and whom I personally will do|everything I can
{115764}{115820}within the law to prevent|ever coming to London again.
{115821}{115892}# Fuck this and fuck that #
{115893}{115973}# Fuck it all|and fuck the fucking brat #
{115974}{116052}# She don't want a baby|who looks like that #
{116053}{116129}# I don't want a baby|who looks like that #
{116130}{116189}# Body #
{116190}{116239}# I'm not an animal #
{116284}{116355}# Body #
{116356}{116400}# An unborn kid #
{116436}{116479}# An animal #
{116509}{116560}# I'm not an animal #
{116590}{116639}# I'm not an animal,|an animal #
{116640}{116702}# I'm not an animal|I ain't no animal #
{116744}{116786}# I'm not a body #
{116822}{116888}# I'm not an animal,|an animal #
{116889}{116949}# I ain't no an animal|I'm not an animal #
{116950}{116993}# I'm not an animal... #
{116994}{117040}# Mommy! #
{117241}{117299}I think that was|our last gig in England.
{117332}{117379}- Who's this?|- Sex Pistols.
{117380}{117411}Sid Vicious?
{117412}{117444}Yes.
{117445}{117512}This is Rodney Bingenheimer|from "Rodney on the Roq" show.
{117512}{117587}Oh, hi, man.|No future.
{117588}{117654}Is Johnny Rotten there?
{117655}{117723}- Yeah.|- Hey, how are you doing?
{117724}{117769}I'm doing all right.
{117770}{117836}You'll be coming to America|soon, won't you?
{117837}{117895}Get work,|move to California.
{117896}{117964}- Come to California|- It's the best.
{117964}{118015}Oh, I don't know...
{118016}{118077}Can you get egg and chips?
{118078}{118138}You can do anything|you want here, man.
{118183}{118242}No one is repressed in L.A.
{118243}{118327}Oh, yes you are.|Mentally repressed, dear.
{118328}{118393}Right -- that's true.
{118461}{118521}This week on Don Kirshner's|Rock Concert...
{118522}{118565}The incredible Kansas...
{118566}{118628}Family Funk|from the Sylvers...
{118629}{118710}The outrageousness|of the Sex Pistols.
{118711}{118778}Some slick dealing|from Ricky Jay,
{118779}{118850}and funnyman|Robert Aguayo.
{118885}{118932}We had trouble|getting our visas
{118932}{118987}'cause we had criminal records,|all of us.
{118988}{119048}They strip-searched us|at the airport,
{119049}{119139}and thank god Sid was|the first one they strip-searched,
{119140}{119227}'Cause as soon as they've seen|his underwear...
{119228}{119279}That was it,|we were safe.
{119280}{119372}They had no wish to play
{119373}{119439}with the rest of our willies|after that point.
{119446}{119483}Across the globe
{119484}{119571}they achieved a notoriety|in 19 languages.
{119572}{119667}In the city, voted|"Young businessmen of the year"
{119668}{119711}by the lnvestors' Review.
{119712}{119778}On Fleet Street,|they sold more papers
{119779}{119824}than the Armistice.
{119825}{119883}They didn't care|about the music --
{119884}{119945}they were purely into chaos.
{119946}{119997}Security was tight|for the arrival
{119998}{120087}of the infamous punk rock group|known as the Sex Pistols,
{120088}{120152}that naughty bunch|of counter-culture radicals.
{120153}{120200}Warner records had warned
{120201}{120264}that the group might attack|members of the American Press,
{120265}{120310}but when Steve Jones,|Paul Cook,
{120311}{120372}Johnny Rotten,|and Sid Vicious arrived,
{120373}{120428}this is|what they had to say...
{120482}{120516}Nothing.
{120527}{120572}Well, coming to America...
{120573}{120634}was definitely|a strange experience.
{120635}{120706}Ow-ww! Fucking kick me|in the fucking balls?
{120707}{120747}We had, like,|these bodyguards...
{120748}{120787}With walkie-talkies,|and that...
{120788}{120866}Continually followed by,|like, FBI
{120867}{120946}and fucking CIA,|and 50 journalists.
{120947}{120994}It was kinda scary.
{120995}{121072}And here they are --|at least two of them --
{121072}{121119}in a hotel room in Atlanta,
{121120}{121185}waiting for the other two|to do a promised interview.
{121186}{121228}But they're in|a strange mood...
{121229}{121311}Flaky -- demanding they be paid|ten bucks
{121312}{121392}before they'll do any|"bleep-bleep" interview.
{121393}{121445}Denied that,|they stomp off.
{121446}{121500}"Bleep," they say.
{121528}{121601}When the four young men left,|their spit was on the carpet,
{121602}{121639}their butts on the floor.
{121640}{121701}The dregs of an afternoon's|beer and booze,
{121702}{121782}and a couple of empty boxes|of Clearasil.
{121783}{121878}They left the hotel|to go to a sex devices store,
{121879}{121959}and then to their first concert|in America.
{122068}{122161}We didn't come from America,|we didn't understand America,
{122162}{122220}so how the fuck|could they understand us?
{122220}{122280}Okay, all you cowboys.
{122281}{122319}You faggots!
{122320}{122432}And I said, "You fucking|motherfucking faggot cowboys."
{122432}{122512}They were throwing|a rain of bottles and beer cans,
{122513}{122571}and pigs' noses,|and fuck knows what.
{122572}{122619}Anarchy in...
{122620}{122676}I got a full can of beer|smashed right on my lip.
{122676}{122709}The U-S of A.
{122710}{122781}Fucking big fat lip|with blood dripping down it.
{122782}{122840}The gigs were|pretty frightening,
{122840}{122905}'cause of all the publicity|that had preceded us.
{122906}{122960}People were coming there|just to see this freak show.
{122961}{123014}They thought we were gonna be|sick on stage,
{123015}{123068}crap on stage,|beat each other up,
{123068}{123129}kill each other --|well, it was partly true.
{123155}{123216}# I am an antichrist #
{123217}{123296}# I am an anarchist... #
{123320}{123368}Then Sid started|beating himself,
{123369}{123474}cutting himself on stage,|and totally being out to lunch.
{123475}{123528}# l... #
{123529}{123594}# Wanna be #
{123595}{123655}Birds were better looking|in America, that's for sure.
{123656}{123700}I really enjoyed|that part of it,
{123700}{123733}and they knew|how to suck dick.
{123734}{123787}They learn at an early|age here.
{123815}{123876}Sid loved the Pistols --
{123877}{123924}as a fan...
{123925}{124017}but being on stage with us,|he couldn't cope.
{124018}{124064}He wasn't being himself|anymore,
{124064}{124113}he was trying to be|Johnny Rotten...
{124114}{124165}with the drugs.
{124166}{124239}And that showed, I think,|to my mind, very bad.
{124318}{124391}The fucking Texas patrolmen|took me...
{124393}{124448}and threw me out the door.
{124448}{124489}And they have the authority|'cause they have a badge,
{124490}{124533}and they have a fucking|billy club and a gun.
{124630}{124695}Malcolm, he liked the idea|of Sid being outrageous,
{124696}{124758}however much it|fucked things up for the band.
{124759}{124832}I think he encouraged him.|I remember Sid saying once...
{124833}{124892}"He could never be|outrageous enough."
{124892}{124939}And Malcolm's going,|"Yes, yes, I agree."
{124940}{124995}"You can go mad,|go all the way."
{125028}{125091}It says to me that I should do|what I wanna do, you know?
{125092}{125146}And just fuck everybody else.
{125147}{125202}Just fuck everybody else,|you know? Just fuck 'em.
{125276}{125322}They moved me,|they made me shake
{125323}{125367}more than I've ever|shook before,
{125368}{125421}and that's what...|what makes them the best.
{125536}{125576}I think I heard one time|that they...
{125577}{125608}urinated on the audience|one time.
{125608}{125649}Why, I don't know.|Itjust sounds goofy.
{125650}{125706}- Get outta here!|- What are they saying?
{125707}{125750}Get outta here!
{125751}{125814}It's better than homework.
{125815}{125866}Get the fuck outta here!
{125925}{125970}You faggot fucker!
{126043}{126136}Yeah, the guy fucking tried|to climb up on stage
{126136}{126182}and fucking attack me,
{126183}{126262}so I smashed his fucking brains|in with my guitar.
{126263}{126320}He knew that I meant|physical harm,
{126321}{126376}and I have to say|I was ugly about it.
{126377}{126440}But he came out and hit us|over the head with the bass.
{126441}{126484}They were great.
{126485}{126550}If I could only make out|the words, they'd be greater.
{126551}{126609}That was my first time|in America.
{126610}{126704}Sid would sit next to me,|and we'd look out the window,
{126705}{126807}and we'd stare|at that endless scenery,
{126808}{126874}and imagine John Wayne|and the indians.
{126875}{126958}You wouldn't sleep.|You wouldn't want to,
{126959}{127034}because it was|so first time.
{127247}{127360}Steve and paul flew|around America with Malcolm.
{127360}{127410}Steven,|what kind of badge you got?
{127411}{127459}I don't know.|Safety department.
{127460}{127504}Safety department.|That's very good.
{127505}{127552}Say goodbye.|Say goodbye.
{127553}{127608}They didn't want to be|on the tour bus,
{127609}{127729}'cause they were "really bored|with that reggae, man."
{127757}{127815}Steve and Paul|are a pair of sheep.
{127845}{127907}They do what Malcolm says.
{127908}{127963}Sid was just|looking for smack,
{127964}{128032}and being an idiot.|Rotten got into his ego...
{128033}{128107}itjust got really depressing,|really quick.
{128108}{128176}But the point is,|Sid's my mate,
{128177}{128239}and I don't want him|to be ajunkie.
{128240}{128295}This is why we traveled|on the bus,
{128296}{128361}this is why Sid was to stick|with me,
{128362}{128404}and like, the others|just didn't understand.
{128405}{128481}They thought,|"Oh, you can handle it, man."
{128482}{128534}But, like, dope sickness|isn't like that.
{128535}{128588}It's not something|that you can just blow away.
{128589}{128658}It's the worst sickness|you could ever imagine.
{128659}{128743}He was far too young|for that shit,
{128744}{128828}and un-american|for that shit.
{128829}{128914}I can drink,|and I can drink a druggie
{128915}{128964}out of being a druggie.
{128965}{129036}And I will do that|for my friends,
{129037}{129105}every time, any time.
{129106}{129173}You can't get comfortable,|and you sweat...
{129174}{129250}and you're boiling hot|and you pour with sweat.
{129251}{129305}And your nose dribbles and...
{129306}{129360}and all of a sudden|you get the colds,
{129360}{129412}and the sweat turns|to fucking ice on you,
{129413}{129461}and you put ajumper on.
{129462}{129511}Then you're boiling hot again,|and you take it off, and, like,
{129512}{129581}you get cold again and, like,|you just can't win.
{129582}{129640}And you lie down,|and that's not comfortable,
{129640}{129692}you sit up, that's not comfortable.|It drives you insane.
{129693}{129748}I despise Sid for it,
{129748}{129860}and I'll despise anyone|for messing with it ever since.
{129861}{130012}It is the only drug that really|cancels out all creativity.
{130013}{130072}It is about self-pity.
{130072}{130180}It is the lowest,|worst form of life.
{130232}{130284}Well, he wasn't even playing|at the end.
{130285}{130335}You know, he could barely|play it anyway.
{130336}{130376}Half the time he wasn't even|plugged in.
{130376}{130416}It was like ajoke.|It was like...
{130417}{130457}"What the fuck|am I up here for?
{130458}{130542}What am I doing with this fucking,|like, kind of circus?"
{130543}{130584}I just didn't want|any part of it.
{130585}{130651}In the end, like,|I was the only one
{130652}{130694}who had any anarchy left in me.
{130695}{130751}The rest of the band,|they couldn't fucking take it.
{130752}{130853}And then we got to, like...|Like I said, San Francisco,
{130854}{130924}and Malcolm's in town,
{130924}{130968}and Sid goes off|with Malcolm,
{130968}{131051}suddenly Sid comes back|smacked up.
{131096}{131140}Winterland --|the final countdown.
{131141}{131214}It wasn't|a rock and roll party.
{131215}{131260}It was more|like a dying horse
{131261}{131322}that needed putting|out of its misery.
{131347}{131404}But Malcolm saw it more|as a media circus.
{131405}{131459}He didn't realize|what a great band we were.
{131460}{131520}This is KSAM|in San Francisco,
{131521}{131592}with the Sex Pistols,|live from Winterland.
{131628}{131708}Throughout the show, people|were hurling things at them.
{131708}{131774}From all over --|from above, from the sides,
{131775}{131823}from right down below --|and there were people
{131824}{131887}jumping up on stage|and being carried off.
{131888}{131927}The stage is...
{131928}{131972}Here they come.
{132026}{132116}It's not really impossible|in San Francisco
{132116}{132191}to have monitors that work.
{132192}{132225}...is it?
{132226}{132296}Is it impossible|to have a sound check?
{132297}{132335}No.
{132336}{132391}Here's the encore|of the Sex Pistols.
{132420}{132495}Malcolm would set it up|to look ridiculous.
{132496}{132536}We were all cheated --
{132537}{132621}audience...|and lead singer alike.
{132661}{132722}You'll get one number|and one number only,
{132723}{132770}'cause I'm a lazy bastard.
{132771}{132849}You have to understand,|they stayed in a very nice hotel.
{132850}{132894}This is "no fun."
{132895}{132989}Me and Sid were not allowed|in that very nice hotel.
{132990}{133090}We had to stay with|the road crew in a motel.
{133091}{133196}The sheer lack of respect...|for Malcolm --
{133196}{133256}and him not returning a call --
{133256}{133309}that was it for me.
{133395}{133448}It wasn't connived at all.
{133448}{133489}We got to our hotel|and booked in.
{133490}{133549}I wasn't aware that he didn't|get a room there.
{133550}{133603}So he ended up staying|somewhere else.
{133655}{133737}# No fun, my babe #
{133738}{133792}# No fun #
{133792}{133855}Malcolm was fucking|with me.
{133856}{133961}I had no credit card,|and no money, no ticket.
{133993}{134031}He was trying to wreck
{134032}{134112}the very thing that made|the Sex Pistols great,
{134113}{134174}and he managed to achieve it|that night.
{134175}{134247}# ...fun to be alone #
{134248}{134304}# ln love #
{134304}{134372}# With nobody else #
{134406}{134453}John came over,|and we tried to have
{134454}{134507}a "clear the air" talk,|and we said to him,
{134508}{134561}"l don't wanna carry on,|really much longer
{134562}{134627}the way this is going.|It's, like, just totally pointless.
{134628}{134672}Someone's gonna get killed,|you know?"
{134672}{134732}John said he thought|the problem was Malcolm,
{134732}{134795}and we should get rid|of Malcolm and carry on,
{134796}{134843}and try and work|it out that way.
{134844}{134921}# Fun to be alone #
{134922}{135009}# Walkin' by myself #
{135010}{135087}# Fun to be alone #
{135088}{135146}# ln love #
{135147}{135211}# With nobody else #
{135212}{135247}I didn't really|hang out with John.
{135248}{135315}He was always draining to me.|Took up a lot of energy.
{135316}{135410}Malcolm I got along with, so|I kinda went on to McLaren's side.
{135411}{135456}Another thing I regret.
{135457}{135516}# Maybe call somebody|on the telephone #
{135516}{135582}# Well come on,|my babe #
{135583}{135634}# Come on #
{135720}{135782}I'd have dropped Sid|in a second
{135783}{135841}at that particular point|for the band,
{135842}{135893}because I knew|he was fucking up.
{135894}{135928}# No fun... #
{135928}{135960}That's a load|of cobblers.
{135960}{136015}I was just playing bass,|and going crazy,
{136016}{136063}and leaping up and down.|And he thought I was trying
{136064}{136160}to take over his position|as the "New Johnny Rotten."
{136161}{136201}# No fun #
{136250}{136277}# No fun #
{136278}{136329}I don't wanna be ajunkie|for the rest of my life.
{136330}{136390}I don't wanna be|ajunkie at all.
{136502}{136572}I knew the second|Sid would smack himself up again
{136573}{136627}that was the end.
{136673}{136746}# No -- no fun #
{136747}{136800}# No fun #
{136800}{136881}# Alone -- no fun #
{136882}{136912}# By myself, it's no fun... #
{136912}{136963}I was the one who said|"l've had enough."
{136964}{136998}I couldn't|handle it any more.
{136999}{137071}I didn't want nothing to do|with Rotten and Vicious.
{137096}{137168}Oh, bollocks,|why should I carry on?
{137169}{137246}I regret saying|that I wanted out, and leaving.
{137247}{137300}I regret it,|I really do.
{137301}{137389}And I apologized to John|that I fucking bailed.
{137390}{137443}# No fun #
{137444}{137527}We might have continued|if we'd have got rid of Malcolm.
{137552}{137607}# No fun... #
{137608}{137655}But that's just|the way I felt.
{137656}{137722}And I couldn't get away|from my feelings at the time.
{137785}{137835}I knew it had to end.
{137836}{137884}I didn't think it would end...
{137885}{137977}with them being|total wanker cowards.
{138053}{138128}Steve and Paul|fannied out on me.
{138193}{138267}The last show was the worst show|I think we've ever played.
{138268}{138327}It was just like,|this ain't going nowhere.
{138328}{138405}This ain't going anywhere,|it's fucking over.
{138441}{138499}Cookie agreed,|and we just fucked off.
{138705}{138751}The night the group split up,
{138752}{138816}Vicious was pulled off a plane|at Kennedy Airport,
{138817}{138873}the victim of a drug overdose.
{138896}{138961}Despite all the hassles,|what was it that you thought
{138962}{139008}the Pistols were really|trying to do?
{139009}{139073}Was itjust like really kick|the establishment up the arse?
{139116}{139156}Sid?
{139157}{139256}Sid, he's not interviewing me.|Please try and wake up.
{139257}{139305}Ow-ww!
{139359}{139423}Sid, damn you!
{139468}{139512}Fuck.
{139587}{139647}Everybody was for Sid --|I mean, Sid was like...
{139648}{139701}I don't know if you saw|any of the gigs,
{139702}{139772}but Sid was like,|really shining out.
{139772}{139840}And John was being|like, nothing.
{139892}{139961}The only people... the only|two people that I can think of...
{139962}{140034}that I would like|to play with...
{140191}{140240}Sid...?
{140241}{140285}Oh, my God...
{140286}{140402}I feel nothing but grief,|sorrow and sadness for Sid.
{140403}{140447}To the point, like,
{140448}{140502}if I really like,|talk about it,
{140503}{140555}I just fucking burst out|in tears.
{140556}{140615}He was someone|I really cared for.
{140616}{140698}You see?|He's one of the Johns.
{140699}{140772}I care about every single one|of the Johns.
{140773}{140835}The gang of Johns|should have been the band.
{140836}{140908}- Wake up, Sid.|- Yeah, okay. I'm waking up.
{140909}{140950}Now what's|the next question?
{140951}{141012}I can't be more|honest than that.
{141013}{141077}Don't drop it|on me again.
{141671}{141748}Well, the room was...|very bloody.
{141748}{141816}There was blood on the sheets,|and blood on the mattress
{141816}{141882}there was tracks of blood|leading into the bathroom,
{141883}{141971}where the body of the female|was found lying under the sink.
{141972}{142028}She was stabbed|in the stomach.
{142184}{142241}The whole thing lasted|no more than three minutes,
{142242}{142299}and out they went.|Vicious made no attempt
{142300}{142356}to duck the cameras waiting|outside the courtroom,
{142357}{142434}but he refused to respond to any|of the reporters' questions,
{142435}{142494}and shoved persistent|microphones out of his path.
{142495}{142585}The grand jury will decide whether|or not to indict Vicious for murder.
{142586}{142676}If indicted, the case moves to the|Supreme Court for further action.
{142677}{142727}Vicious was ordered|to Ryker's lsland.
{142728}{142784}If convicted of the stabbing|death of Miss Spungen,
{142785}{142849}Vicious faces 1 5 years|to life in prison.
{142850}{142911}# No fun... #
{142912}{142984}Are you having fun|at the moment?
{142984}{143025}Are you kidding?
{143026}{143092}No, I'm not|having fun at all.
{143159}{143209}Where would you|like to be?
{143240}{143288}Under the ground.
{143321}{143362}Are you serious?
{143363}{143404}Oh, yeah.
{143714}{143778}I've lost my friend.
{143779}{143867}I couldn't have changed it.|I was too young.
{143868}{143929}God, I wish|I was smarter.
{143930}{144004}You can look back on it,|and go,
{144005}{144074}"l could have done|something."
{144075}{144149}He died,|for fuck's sake.
{144213}{144318}Theyjust turned it|into making money.
{144319}{144376}"Ha, ha, ha, ha..."
{144377}{144445}How hilarious for them.
{144446}{144490}Fucking cheek.
{144491}{144576}I'll hate them forever|for doing that.
{144708}{144814}You can't get more evil than that.|Can you, Julien? You know?
{144877}{144933}No respect.
{144934}{145001}Vicious... poor sod.
{145148}{145205}# No fun... #
{145236}{145285}# No fun! #
{145286}{145369}# No fun -- no fun #
{145370}{145430}# No fun... #
{145485}{145566}# No fun -- my babe #
{145567}{145620}# No fun #
{145663}{145744}# Fun to be alone #
{145744}{145829}# Walkin' by myself #
{145830}{145903}# Fun to be alone #
{145904}{145952}# ln love... #
{145976}{146059}And I said, "You fucking|motherfucking faggot cowboys,
{146060}{146128}you can throw any fucking thing|in the world at us,
{146128}{146177}and you won't get us|off this stage."
{146178}{146251}# Maybe goin' out|maybe stay at home #
{146252}{146322}# Maybe call somebody|on the telephone #
{146323}{146376}# Come on #
{146377}{146427}# No fun #
{146593}{146651}We gave it fucking 200 percent
{146652}{146706}for, like two years,|and that was it.
{146707}{146743}I think we run out|of steam.
{146744}{146794}You dirty fucker.
{146795}{146836}I loved being|a Sex Pistol.
{146837}{146894}I'll always be|a Sex Pistol.
{146895}{146945}But at least, you know,|when I die
{146946}{146994}at least I can say|I've done something.
{146995}{147036}# No fun... #
{147037}{147115}Press the self-destruct button,|and start again.
{147116}{147157}Which is what it|was all about.
{147247}{147288}# No fun... #
{147288}{147400}So creating something|called the Sex Pistols
{147401}{147480}was my painting,|my sculpture,
{147480}{147549}my little artful dodgers.
{147576}{147640}Are you still waffling,|Malcolm?
{147672}{147713}The Sex Pistols ended
{147714}{147804}at exactly the right time|for all the wrong reasons,
{147804}{147884}but the wrong reasons|were continued,
{147885}{147969}and people continued|to perpetrate lies --
{147970}{148013}about a reality.
{148158}{148195}Ah, ha, ha...
{148196}{148264}Ever get the feeling|you've been cheated?
{148264}{148308}Goodnight.
{148486}{148533}We did what we had to do...
{148534}{148585}and that's why|we didn't survive.
{148586}{148663}Only the fakes survive.
{148664}{148737}All I want is for|future generations
{148738}{148810}to just go,|"Fuck it, I've had enough,
{148811}{148860}here's the truth."
{148910}{148968}Infamy, infamy!
{148968}{149024}They've all got it|in for me.
{149438}{149545}# I'm on a submarine mission|for you, baby #
{149546}{149648}# I feel the way|you were goin' #

Jerry and i met a long time ago...
...when we both tried to learn how to play bluegrass music.
And we both did, somewhat.
Then we formed our own styles because bill monroe...
...said the best thing you can do is go get your own style.
So jerry, he started the "dead" style of music.
He's the pioneer of that.
David, he started "dawg" music.
The last time we got together we played bluegrass.
Now we try to fuse our styles.
So we have a new tune that's kind of a combination of dead and dawg...
...or as we call it, "grateful dawg."
They were like two peas in a pod.
There they were, beards of a feather.
They were born out of the same cosmic egg.
They looked similar and did crazy things the same way.
How they'd grown up paying attention to music...
...the sum of those parts created an awesome duet.
There was a communication that was soulfully connected.
Each knew where the other was coming from.
David tightened jerry up.
Jerry loosened david up.
Friends that are great musicians.
They had a musical friendship.
They played music...
...they talked about music, they listened to music.
I've traditionally been more of a disciplinarian.
Jerry was more an in-the-moment type guy, and everything was cool.
So he kind of adopted a little bit of my attitude...
...and i adopted a little of his.
It was okay that he was his way...
...but when we got together, we tried to be more like each other.
Jerry and i met in 1964...
...at a place called sunset park in west grove, pennsylvania.
We were both there to hear bill monroe and his bluegrass boys.
He came from california, i came from new jersey.
People would come to hear the entertainers...
...but during intermission...
...they'd go in the parking lot and pick.
Then they'd hear bill monroe come on and then they'd go back.
An awful lot of friends were made in the parking lot.
People would jam, swap instruments.
I believe we did some picking then.
I knew who david was.
I had friends that had played with him.
There was the new york crowd, the cambridgelboston crowd.
There was a chicago crowd.
There was a berkeley scene, and l.a.
These people were aware of each other.
Somebody would make a pilgrimage.
Eric thompson came out to new york from berkeley.
David and jerry's roots...
...came from the same place.
They both loved the music from the south, the bluegrass tunes.
When they got together, that came out together too.
Jerry had that little lope.
You'd think he ain't gonna make it back there...
...but he always hit on the right spot to give it dynamics.
Others wouldn't have taken those risks...
...spending your career playing an electric guitar...
...and then playing banjo or acoustic guitar.
Beautiful instruments came into jerry's hands...
...through his connection with david.
Stemming from their love of music.
It was fun to give jerry stuff.
We gave him that huge banjo book.
It's, like, this big. It was $500.
One day, dave and i brought it.
"Here's a present. It weighs a ton."
- Nineteen pounds.
- One book, just on banjos.
He was, like, "wow!" trying to blow away the guy who has everything.
He turned us on to lots of stuff.
- Real pleasure.
- An endless source of imagination.
We had a banjo picker who was...
...a very deep person and multifaceted in his expressions in life.
And he could give nicknames.
He gave good nicknames.
He gave one to vassar.
Vassar smokes a pipe a lot so he was called clamp.
- Where is my pipe?
- Or clem, depending.
Me, of course, i was red, for "panama red."
John kahn played the bass, and both were called mule.
And the mandolin picker, he was known as david "dawg" grisman.
The man who gave us the names, his nickname was spud.
Spud boy. Jerry "spud" garcia.
When we met, david said,
"garcia lives just up the hill."
"He likes to play banjo."
We walked up there...
...and there's a little sign that says "sans souci."
Which, i think, in french means "no problem."
And there was this guy with a beard...
...and a blue dungaree shirt and jeans on and sandals...
...picking banjo, coming to the gate to greet us.
That's when the band was born.
After a few hours of picking, he said,
"we're old & in the way."
I thought the world of all of them.
What i really liked about it is, everybody got along so well.
And everybody wanted to play and to rehearse.
And it's hard to find that in a group of people.
That anytime anybody said rehearse, let's go.
We both lived in stinson beach.
So was peter rowan.
We started playing bluegrass for fun.
One day jerry said:
"I can get us gigs.
We need a bass player."
He invited john kahn, his bass player.
He also played upright bass.
That was the genesis of our little band.
I knew i was gonna get together with old & in the way.
I thought, " maybe we will go out and play bluegrass festivals."
People ask, " how is it playing with guys with long hair?"
I don't notice their long hair.
I notice how they play, what kind of people they are...
...what kind of heart they have.
That's what matters.
It's interesting how old & in the way approached bluegrass.
We decided to go ahead and play modern and traditional songs...
...and original songs...
...with the same approach that we played old songs.
In a way, it was too loose for me.
I'd played in tight bluegrass bands.
I'd played with the kentucky colonels and red allen...
...and i had this real discipline for bluegrass.
David was more the leader...
...of the music of old & in the way.
David could be tortured in a moment if the music wasn't right.
Jerry would say, "well, it's just another note, another set."
We did a lot of things with bluegrass, and you can tell by the effect it had.
Just 10 songs from a live tape...
...spawned a whole generation's interest in bluegrass.
To us, it was just a casual thing.
The record didn't come out till '75, two years after it was all over.
So this band had a career without ever really existing in real life.
My dad bumped into jerry.
They hadn't seen each other in 12 years...
...because of a silly business thing that had gone awry...
...that had nothing to do with them.
But you know how you have situations with friends.
The more time goes by, the more you're embarrassed to contact the other.
It's amazing they never saw each other...
...being in similar circles.
We both were booked on a session for pete sears...
...a local musician.
Sure enough, jerry comes walking up the steps and it was... it was like nothing had passed between them.
We just had a long talk for about two hours or something...
...and kind of re-connected.
We saw each other again at the village music christmas party.
David credits that as the initial genesis...
...when the garcialgrisman band idea came to them.
So david had been talking to me for several years...
...about playing at one of my parties.
When the garcialgrisman thing happened...
...i thought, "that'd be fun.
Want to do a christmas party?"
He said, "let me talk to jerry."
A week later he said, "we're on."
At my parties we had lots of musicians.
It wasn't just playing for your friends.
It was playing in front of a lot of musical peers.
It was a private function...
...but where there's a will, there's a way.
It resonated so deeply for me.
By hook or crook, i had to be there.
They wanted to do a duo but then thought of a rhythm section.
I said, "well, i have a pretty neat rhythm section. It's acoustic."
Jerry said, "let's try that."
We went through an audition.
I think jerry wanted to check it out.
He wasn't familiar with what jim and i were doing...
...or sonically how it would tie in.
I guess jerry dug it.
It was fun to see jerry...
...taking cues from others.
He was looking at all of us, and we were making it all happen.
He was a true member of the band...
...and he was ready to listen to what we were doing...
...and make that part of what he was doing.
For me to see him, especially at that point in his career...
...in the intimacy of the sweetwater...
...with david grisman, doing material that was up my alley...
...it was heaven.
They'd been apart for so long.
They revisited each other musically and emotionally, and it came through.
They got back together at a time...
...when they both needed it.
They both needed to do that together.
That was destiny.
Jerry said,
"we should make a record."
I asked him,
"aren't you under contract?"
He said, "no."
I said, "well, i just started my own little label."
He said, "we'll do it."
It was simple.
Jerry had a huge fan base.
But david was well-respected...
...for the music he had created.
So when jerry came to the studio, he wanted to put this stuff on tape...
...whether it was the jazz or bluegrass or jimmy cliff songs.
He wanted that music to come out in this form.
He appreciated what david was doing.
The fact that his work was calling attention to it...
...and allowing these other pieces to come out made him feel great.
Jerry went back and forth between electric and acoustic.
He had fun playing both instruments.
It was a chance to play acoustic music on a high level.
Jerry's one of those few guys...
...whose tone is the same on acoustic and electric.
- He had...
- and it's him.
It came through on both.
It's rare that somebody can do that.
I never considered myself an acoustic player.
I don't enjoy what i'm playing.
But now i'm developing the foundation.
I like the stuff we're coming up with.
Garcialgrisman was about everything.
It wasn't just bluegrass.
It was all the musical idioms...
...and styles that they both enjoyed tremendously.
It's american music. It runs across a lot of different styles...
...from rockabilly to modern jazz...
...to old-time and bluegrass and a little swing.
Gypsy, rock 'n' roll, reggae music...
...whatever they felt like playing.
They played well off of each other.
As a musician, i can really hear that.
That's hard for me to explain...
...but when two great musicians get together, that's what happens.
Both david and jerry were musicologists.
They wanted to feel they were part of a tradition.
They'd unearth these things and share them with people.
This was music we'd appreciated for a long time...
...and not tried to play.
We learned whaling ballads from a.l. Lloyd and ewan maccoll...
...who made a few obscure records in the late '50s and early '60s.
They were called blow boys blow and thar she blows.
It was just great stuff.
You know, old sea chanteys.
The sea chanteys are outrageous.
I've never tried that.
But i love the music.
We both share a love...
...for all different kinds of styles.
So we're trying all kinds of things.
It all feels good.
This is their connection with each other.
It's what brought them together in old & in the way...
...and it's what reunited them years later with garcialgrisman.
You play some acoustic music and play those old tunes.
You go back before you were born.
It's an older style of music...
...where the music ethos was completely different.
Jerry's very consistent with his emotional output.
He always has a great deal of depth.
He might hit a clinker, he might forget some words...
...but the emotional content...
...of what he's conveying in that music is, to me, pretty deep.
He had a way of really telling a story...
...with those tunes, those ballads.
He took on the character of the tune.
That was the biggest knockout.
Those songs were written before the recording industry.
Sung in town squares.
They were songs of the day, written by people.
The songs that interested jerry were the subtle ones...
...that had to do with aspects of life that we don't really think of.
When you go to sea on a whaler...
...you'd sing for people far away from their loved ones.
I just think that was something that rooted jerry...
...in experiences that he didn't have in his life.
It was the role of music in the richness of real life.
Not performing life, but real life, and how it sustained people.
Not for kids only was an idea i had.
I thought it would carve a new niche in kids' music.
Actually, the concept of kids' music... there shouldn't be a distinction.
Kids are people.
I think that's why we came up with that title...
...and that's why so many people who aren't kids like the record.
It's really not for kids only, but it is for kids too.
It exposed jerry garcia of the grateful dead...
...who was known for many things, but not...
...for turning children on to music.
David tried to get jerry to do kids' songs...
...but he said he didn't want to...
...because of this patriarchal image people foist on him.
He didn't want to feed that.
I remember that we wanted him to do the cover art for not for kids only.
One day he was there, and he sat in your dad's studio...
...and he drew a preliminary sketch for not for kids only.
He had to leave.
We'd say, " before you leave...
...draw a freight train.
Draw a little bumblebee."
That's how the artwork to not for kids only kind of happened.
Personally, this is also kind of a reaction...
...to the revisionist revamping of children's songs...
...that's current in the children's music world.
Well, anyway...
...there's a lot of nice, traditional songs that kids haven't heard.
A generation of kids, at least one, that haven't heard these nice songs.
How would you describe these?
What are they?
Bloodthirsty, violent.
American, you know.
I said, " hey, jerry, you want to try this kids idea?"
And he said, "okay."
I said, " i got this book...
...with 2,000 songs.
There's 'freight train'."
"Oh, yeah, 'freight train's' cool."
So we did "freight train," then we did "jenny jenkins."
We did three or four songs...
...and they came real easy and they sounded good, just the two of us.
And then jerry said,
"yeah, this could be cool."
The studio was so relaxed, it felt like someone's basement.
As kids, we'd play in a basement and have fun.
I imagine that it was like that for them.
"Arabia" was interesting, a kind of collaboration with everyone.
It came out of the drama happening in the real world at the time.
That gulf war was going on, and i had this middle eastern line.
I just tossed it out to jerry.
We played the parts that were there.
Jim knew this cuban song.
He threw that in for his bass solo.
It's just a hodgepodge of related things.
We kind of stitched this all together and it worked.
We did about 44 sessions.
There was never an agenda.
Never a planned agenda.
It wasn't, "today, we'll record..." we never knew what we'd do.
But there was so much spontaneity with how it would just evolve.
We'd sit out in the basement, around in chairs, and play.
Then they'd go, "great."
We'd take five steps into the recording room and turn the tape on.
Every time we got together was a recording session.
- Are we starting again?
- Yeah.
No, i mean, we will be.
- Say when.
- The tape was always rolling.
It was very relaxed.
A lot of great stuff musically, and everything between takes.
That's the attitude, man.
- Yeah, no matter what.
- We got a door open here.
No matter what, we're ready for you.
- Even if nothing's plugged in.
- Fuck, yeah, man.
They wanted to expand the tune.
I played this piece that i learned, which was a cuban revolutionary song.
I played it as we worked on the tune.
I was just messing with it.
They wanted to incorporate it into the piece.
We knew it'd be a long opus-type thing...
...that would tell a story.
It didn't matter that it was arabic in nature.
We just made it musical.
It's all like african music.
That's why we're trying to get over there with this song.
Right.
Incursions into the middle east.
Yes, sirree.
You want one take in a tune like
"arabia," which kept changing.
It kept building.
That was tough. You do one take...
...and then you do one more.
- And the next.
- We did it in sections.
We do stagger it.
Wait until we're all in...
...before you make the trip.
You've done that.
- I mean, here's the thing.
- He has been.
I do this.
I do that once.
Now, the next time...
...i won't play that part.
That's your part.
I play harmony, but that time...
...i had to play it three times...
...by myself, which i would cut out.
I mean, by that time... whatever. I think we all understand each other.
Dave, how are we doing for tape?
- You ready?
- Ready, ernie.
Yes, sir.
I mean, yes, sir.
My approach doesn't work with something like "arabia."
It's complex.
It has lots of parts to it...
...and it wants to be very precise.
It's good to have something rigorous.
It's mental discipline.
You know?
That's something that i shied away from most of my life.
Just sliding along on good luck.
The contrast between your approach and jerry's was great.
You would tend to want to push and jerry would say:
"That's great. That's good."
So, in your differences you had a great dynamic...
...in the way you sort of directed the sessions.
David would start things out faster than jerry expected.
Jerry would say, "are you kidding?"
We balanced being supportive and then kind of ribbing each other.
They would bicker and have spats about what kind of... if there was an introduction here, or whatever.
But they'd support each other.
You played a good solo though.
Whatever.
We sat across from each other.
I felt this kind of...
...electric wave going back and forth, or something like that.
It was really cool. It was just being in sync, you know.
With jerry, it was a collaboration.
I didn't take that much initiative...
...or try to organize anything any more than he did.
It would have been pointless because we were having too much fun.
I mean, we still got down to a lot of music.
David's a hard worker.
No doubt.
Anybody in his band is a hard worker, including jerry.
David made an effort to keep it very relaxed and comfortable.
There was no pressure for jerry to be here...
...or if he didn't wanna be here, no big deal.
Whatever jerry wanted was fine.
That was the premise.
Once he got jerry here...
"how about we do it this way?"
I was surprised at how many takes jerry would do.
I'd usually leave it up to him and he ended up being a perfectionist.
I'd like you to meet my friend jim.
Jim kerwin.
Jim's drinking a white seltzer.
Jim, are you enjoying your beverage?
It's a vanilla cream too.
- What do you think?
- It's like the rock group cream.
- I'd like you to meet my friend jerry.
- How are you?
He's a little weird.
- And this is david.
- I'd like you to meet my friend david.
- This is david's hair.
- Turn this way.
This is the padded cell that we play in.
We've just been to arabia.
This piece is a bitch.
At first i didn't know whose video it was.
It turned out to be mine.
In terms of ideas for it, i thought of how the song struck me...
...more than an image for jerry and dave.
We put them in an interesting setting with many characters.
We got them in suits and made a gangster motif.
They just had to perform.
I was as surprised as anybody...
...at what that they let us do.
I remember there was some haircutting.
They put a lot of hours into this project.
I don't think either of them woke up one day...
...and said, " let's spend
12 hours on a set."
The neat thing about jerry and david doing this video...
...is, it's them together.
They were together musically, but they didn't have a lot of time...
...to kill all day swapping stories.
They were both very encouraging and not just on this project... to do more videos and keep working on what you love.
Watching them doing that...
...it was inspiring that life could have those possibilities for me too.
- That's a good one.
- I love that rhythm.
That's a good song.
Shit, i love those songs, man.
They have freaky melodies.
It sounded great.
I gotta get these lyrics.
Certain amount of them anyway.
Tell you what, man, you can have the whole book.
I've gotta get it out of here.
That's the last good tune in it.
We've burned it out.
There's nothing left.
I'll type out the ones you want.
That'll be good.
I'll practice the good ones.
- You need a pencil?
- Yeah.
The two of them together created a big, comfortable living-room space.
And you felt that feeling of the easy chair...
...and the relaxed atmosphere.
I think jerry coming over and hanging with my dad was... it was a safe haven.
He could come and there was no pressure to be jerry.
He had a burden being the king of the deadheads.
Jerry garcia of the grateful dead, icon of '60s american rock 'n' roll.
Here, he was just one of the guys.
It was about hanging out, playing music, talking about music...
...and eating some food...
...and doing some more of all of the above.
He used to call me "squirt."
Just squirt, for short, of sam.
I don't remember him calling me that, but my dad's always saying it.
I think he loved the idea that it was at a home...
...david's home, and david's family was there.
It was just something very warm and cozy.
Jerry enjoyed that david had created that.
I think we should do a project like my bluegrass thing...
...but get different guys to do tunes with.
I'm into doing that in the fullness of time.
That's the only problem, getting hunks of uninterrupted time.
- It's really a bitch.
- Right.
If i knew in advance certain days, i could set things up.
- Right.
- Whatever.
We'll do it. It'll all come together at various times.
At the end of this next year...
...i'll have four or five months.
I don't wanna put any pressure on you.
No pressure.
I love it. It's good for me.
Jerry said, "we can do this for the rest of our lives."
And we did.
We were always in the process.
But once he died, i realized,
"well, this is it."
- You need something?
- No, i was just remembering something.
He liked all genres of music.
He was just a great guy.
When we lost him, it was beyond tears for me.
I knew that a part of me and a part of him were just lost.
He'll still always be inside of me, but i just... that's a shame.
A lot of great music has been played in this house...
...but something about jerry and david together made it possibly...
...more fun than we have ever experienced in this house.
It was a place that they went to in the studios or the warfield...
...where they both left their worlds.
David was a little more in his world.
Still, they had another world that they created together.
It sounds like they couldn't wait to be together...
...each time to play together.
Whether they said it or not, it comes off that way.
Jerry saw something in david...
...that resulted in this flowering of garcia's music...
...through david's efforts in jerry's last years.
David's pushed me a long way now.
I'm happy with my progress.
And insofar as we keep doing this, it keeps challenging me.
I hope to get better yet.
Jerry left behind quite a legacy.
Thousands of grateful dead tunes and recordings.
But there was a whole part of him...
...that hadn't been expressed the way he wanted.
It came out in those last five years.
He expressed that with my dad, and it's on tape...
...for all to share and listen.
That's jerry.
I pretend like he didn't go anywhere.
I won't see him anymore.
I keep all those good aspects, hanging out with me, you know.
I could imagine how he would react to something.
I just adopted a philosophy of...
..."take up a little slack, become a little more jerry-like."

In the early '80s, a friend gave me... a record that complicated my life.
It got me hooked on Latin jazz.
In 1 995, for the final scene of my film, Two Much... some of my favorite musicians... played in Miami's Lincoln Road.
It was a highlight of my filmmaking career.
A magical night.
I was filming the miracle of music.
That's when I began dreaming... of a whole film about this most exciting form of music.
"CALLE 54"
"New Jersey"
Paquito D'Rivera was born with a sax.
Tito Rivera, his father, a classical saxophonist... ordered Paquito's first sax when he was only three.
Paquito became a child prodigy.
"The world's smallest sax player"
"Paquito D'Rivera"
I owe a great debt to Paquito.
There's no remedy for the blues like the sound of his sax.
A Paquito solo can brighten the darkest day.
Dad's best gift wasn't my sax but my mother.
Eliane Elias--
Latin jazz in all its elegance.
Born in Sao Paolo, she was the daughter of a classical pianist.
She began playing piano in her teens with Vinicius de Moraes... remaining with him until his death.
"Puerto de Santa Maria"
"(Cadiz, Espana)"
For years, there were many attempts to merge flamenco and jazz.
Most remained attempts, impressive as some were.
Chano Dominguez was the first
"bilingual"musician of the form.
His music produced a miracle-- a handshake between
Monk and Camaron.
"The Bronx"
"(New York)"
In the late '60s...
Puerto Ricans clashed with police.
It climaxed in an assault on a Bronx precinct house.
The quarter was dubbed
"Fort Apache. "
Hence the name of the group formed by the Gonzalez brothers...
Jerry and Andy.'
The Fort Apache Band.
Andy visits the old family home where he andJerry grew up.
Some of the big hits of the '70s were created here.
Here, tradition and the avant-garde, old and new, merged.
Dizzy Gillespie played with them when they were still kids.
The room under the stairs was Jerry and Andy's.
Jerry's back in his parents'homeland--
Puerto Rico.
"San Juan"
"(Puerto Rico)"
He's the poete maudit of Latin jazz, the last Caribbean pirate.
No one's ever seen him without his trumpet.
Yeah. And I wanna hear three clicks before the downbeat.
Let's do it! Okay.
"Betty Talks about Liz"
Michel Camilo is one of the top all-round musicians.
Whether it's jazz, classical,
Latin American music or film music...
Michel is in his element.
Every time I see him play...
I feel like I'm witnessing a miracle.
"New York"
Little horsey, how's it going?
Gato Barbieri was the revolutionary of Latin jazz.
Aproduct of May '68, he is one of the last survivors.
I was famous from the '7 0s up till '82.
It was a great time because things... were electric between music and filmmakers.
We formed one big family--
Glauber, Godard, Pasolini...
Antonio das Mortes.
It's impossible to live without Rossellini.
I stopped recording in '82... and I only started again in '96... because I saw music was like a toboggan... going downhill fast.
For years I lived in a cocoon... cut off from everything.
The mood wasn't like before, understand?
The cinema back then, the music back then... that's all changed now.
All I want is to play.
That's what makes me feel free.
It's cold out, but... it was a nice journey.
I wrote this piece... like it was for a movie.
First we're in Macchu Picchu, then we'll be in Bolivia.
I'm quiet as a lagoon bird... but sometimes I'm a puma.
This is my mother,
Ercilia Ortiz Puente.
Okay, let's get started.
This is the restaurant ofTito Puente.
At your service.
Let me show you a few of our murals... designed to help our young people... remember our music, our culture.
This is the king of Latin jazz, who wrote "Manteca"...
"Tin Tin Deo" and "Night in Tunisia"... and all those famous standards,
Dizzy Gillespie.
We're indebted to him for the growth of Latin jazz.
Here's one of my mentors,
Mr. Mario Bauza.
Mario is another pillar of Latin jazz... the author of standards like "Tanga."
Another mentor, the great Machito... who contributed to our music... and the spread of Latin American music here in the US.
Cal Tjader, the great vibes player of Latin jazz.
Also very famous.
Next to him is my brother,
Charlie Palmieri... a great veteran pianist.
He started the Duboney Orchestra... and conducted several recordings for me.
The great Miles Davis... the famous trumpeter who loved Latin music.
He'd hang out in Latin bars listening to congas and bongos.
This is Mongo Santamaria... a master of the conga for years.
Next to him is the great Cachao.
Double bass player.
He's still king of the bass.
Next to him is the great Chano Pozo, the composer of "Manteca"... and other standards with Dizzy Gillespie.
All these musicians are pillars of Latin jazz in this country.
I grew up with them.
Today, Tito has his place in the Latin jazz pantheon... alongside the fathers of the music of which he was the king.
"Tito Puente's"
"La Habana"
"(Cuba)"
I'm taking a walk. I haven't been here in years. It's changed.
How's it going?
When Chucho Valdes was a kid, his father, the great bebo... head of the Tropicana Orchestra, brought him to hear the stars here.
Bebo, my father, took me to the shows.
Everything playing at the Tropicana.
I think the Tropicana was an important stage... in the careers of Cuban musicians.
The best in Cuban music... and the best artists came through there.
I'm the sender.
I'm gonna treasure this shirt!
"New York"
Sundays, Chico O'Farrill, a Cuban of Irish stock... who came to New York in the late '40s... conducts his big band at the club.
This is it.
Birdland.
Chico started out playing trumpet... but turned to composing and arranging... for the bands of Machito, Count basie...
"Jazz Nightly"
Stan Kenton and benny Goodman.
Chico was the architect of Latin jazz which he launched worldwide.
As he says.'
"The big band is my instrument. "
"Birdland"
The next one we would like to play for you... the band recorded version... by "the Bird", Charlie Parker,
Flip Phillips, and Buddy Rich.
It's called "Afro Cuban Jazz Suite."
Alright!
"Stockholm"
"(Sverige)" bebo Valdes, Chucho's father... was bandleader at the Tropicana when he left Cuba in 1 960.
On a European tour, he fell in love with a Swede.
Abandoning everything, he retired to Stockholm with his new family.
He spent 20 years playing in hotel bars.
I fell madly in love with this woman.
And I still love her.
It's been 37 years.
I'm old now, but I look at her and it's still like the first day.
I invited bebo to play with Israel Lopez "Cachao"... a Cuban 20 days his junior and a friend for more than 60 years. both started playing in short pants... but this is their first recording together.
Go on, say "seven!"
Cachao, say "seven!"
Afro-Cuban music and Caribbean music... have the same roots.
These roots are in Africa.
When Monk played the piano, he'd suddenly jump up and dance.
He'd do steps that were signals to the percussionist... to hit harder-- and bang-- with the foot... like a rumba dancer.
I think the basic rhythm comes from Africa.
When he got up to dance, he was like a rumba dancer.
A genuine rumba dancer, really African!
Afro-Cuban music and jazz... are like cousins.
And their common grandfather is Africa. bebo Valdes had boasted of a granddaughter... who won an Italian prize for piano.
Like his other Cuban grandchildren, he'd never met her.
"Sony Music Studios"
Chucho Valdes hadn't seen his father in five years.
We met in New York. I invited them to do a dialogue with two pianos.
Hey, you're as fat as a toad!
Everything's fine, Dad.
Glad to be back here.
In the news tonight...
...the music world mourns the death of folk music icon Irving Steinbloom...
...an instrumental figure in guiding folk music...
...from its humble beginnings in the 1950s to its zenith in popularity in the 1960s.
Steinbloom managed the careers of such million-selling folk groups as...
...The Main Street Singers,
The Folksmen...
...and the sweethearts of the folk music scene, Mitch and Mickey.
Their music was the voice of a generation.
It carried a message of peace and freedom...
...and young people got behind the message in a big way.
Steinbloom is survived by his wife and three children.
What do you say, Mitch? It's up to you.
Are you going to be with us?
Yes, we do. We have all three Folksmen.
Of course, Alan, of course.
He was the first to--
We can't imagine doing this without you.
It's as simple as that.
We cannot conceive of doing this--
It seemed that the only fitting tribute to this fantastic human being--
And I have to tell you, my dad was really an amazing character.
And the only fitting tribute we could come up with was a memorial to my dad...
...that would be a concert that would be performed...
...by all of the fabulous groups and people that he used to represent.
It's gonna be very fast. It's gonna be in two weeks. And it had to be in Town Hall...
...because where else could we have such an event? It had to be Town Hall.
And they had a hole in the schedule.
But it's a very sudden hole...
...and we've got two weeks to put together this very complicated event.
But I'm pretty organized myself.
I've always been a very organized person.
When I was 12, I formed the J.C.P.L., the Jewish Children's Polo League.
We rode Shetland ponies instead of horses.
It was funny, my mom used to say:
"Well, if he has to fall, he shouldn't fall from so very high."
She was very protective.
You could say overly protective.
I just like to think she cared about me.
Which she did, a lot.
And I was a member of the chess team.
And whenever we had chess tournaments,
I had to wear a protective helmet.
I had to wear a football helmet.
Now, who knows what she was thinking?
Maybe she thought we might have fallen...
...and impaled our heads on a pointy bishop or something, I don't know.
Now they don't allow no frowns inside
Leave them by the door
-There's apple brandy by the keg
-And sawdust on the floor
So if you've got a hankering
I'll tell you where to go
Just look for the busted neon sign
That flashes
Ea-a-oe's
Well, there's a puppy in the parlor
And a skillet on the stove
Hello, Mr. Stranger Man
-Who is that?
-Who are any of us?
No!
I'll take some of that.
-Mr. Palter has an altar, I see.
-Yeah. The Palter Porch.
-I knew you looked familiar.
-Just a little.
I think I used to work with your kids.
A couple of young guys...
Mark and I met at the University of Vermont in about '61?
Late '61.
We were both interested in folk music, and there was a big folk music scene...
...as there were on many colleges.
We formed The Twobadours.
-Two. T-W-O.
-Badours.
Because there were two of us.
That was the reasoning behind the name.
-Mark was a bass, really, a bass singer.
-I sang way down here.
And I was a tenor singer up there.
And so we had no lead...
No glue. No middle, no...
Vocalist. We went to New York to see what was happening in the biz.
-We were playing at a place...
-The Folk Place.
At The Folk Place, which was a wonderful club at the time and we ran into--
It was the flash point.
It really was.
Everyone-- It was like a big magnet, everyone went there.
-He was singing, he was backing people up--
-I thought I was a guitar player at the time.
If you have enough vibrato on those blue
Fender guitars, you sound like a surf king.
I was drawn to the folk music as well and I wound up down at The Folk Place...
...and met these two guys.
I could play the guitar. I could sing right in the middle there, mostly sang for myself.
-Not a bad-looking gent, to boot.
-No, that's true. That didn't hurt.
We ended up getting together and it just kind of...
-It clicked.
-It clicked.
And Mr. Irving Steinbloom came down and he signed us to Folk Town...
-...which was the label to be on.
-Terrific label.
Later on we were kind of moved down the food chain...
...to the Folk Tone label which was a subsidiary.
It was a decent label, they just didn't have the distribution.
-They didn't have any distribution.
-No distribution at all.
And the covers were printed in two colors instead of four...
...which I noticed was a problem.
And they had no hole in the center of the record--
No, you had to provide it yourself.
So the people complained that you'd get this vinyl, in those days...
-...and it's up to you to center it.
-It would teeter crazily on the spindle.
And that was, of course, we had no control over that aspect of it.
They were still good records.
Good product.
If you punched a hole in them, you'd have a good time.
It's scary but it's true
So do what the Good Book tells you to
I guess it was in about 1958 in Greenwich Village.
My partner Chuck Wiseman and myself had gotten together...
...with Fred Knox and Bill Weyburn.
We were lucky to be joined by one of the greatest talents of our generation...
...any generation, as a matter of fact,
Ramblin' Sandy Pitnik.
And we became the Village Folk Ensemble.
And we were a great group. Great.
We had a good sound...
...but I always thought we should have something bigger, a fuller sound.
And one night in 1960,
I'll never forget this...
...we were at a hootenanny and we were jamming with the Klapper Family.
And all of a sudden, I heard it.
The sound that I'd been thinking about.
The harmonics were amazing.
I thought, "Well, there's five of us, there's four of them. It's a neuf-tet."
And it was there, just in a moment, it was all there.
The neuf-tet sound.
This thing clicked with The Klappers too, so we joined forces...
...and became The Main Street Singers.
Well, 10 years and 30 albums later, we disbanded, but we'd had a good run.
My partner Chuck Wiseman and myself, we called it quits too.
I went my way and Chuck went his.
In 1971, after the breakup of The Main Street Singers...
...Chuck Wiseman moved to San Francisco where he started a business...
...with his two brothers.
The Three Wiseman's Sex Emporium.
It was very successful for a year...
...until they were sued over something having to do with a box of benwa balls.
No, I need you, Mitch.
I need Mitch and Mickey. Mitch and Mickey.
That's the thing. You go together.
I love Mickey, but without you it's not the same. You got to think--
I'm gonna tell you something, Mitch, and I've never told anybody this before.
You were Dad's favorite. Okay.
Just deal with it. You were Dad's favorite.
I've never said this to a single soul.
Two weeks before he died he took me aside and he said to me:
"Of all those ferkakte people,
I love Mitch, he's my favorite.
He's like a relative, he's like my nephew to me."
I'm saying this because I think you'd want to know before you make your mind up.
Would you just think about it?
Sounds cliche, but it's kind of a blur, you know? They loved us.
I guess we were, in a way, maybe easy to love because we represented...
...true love and romance and sweetness, and...
To be quite honest, I bought the image as much as anyone else.
Maybe that's why I sold it so well.
Because it was sweet and happy...
...and everybody, everybody loved to hang around Mitch.
They tried to get close to him, but I was close to him.
He was very smart, very intense...
...and distant, you know?
You'd get close to him and he'd inch back that much further, you know.
And you'd move in, you know, to get inside Mitch...
...and he'd just back off a little more.
Just always kept you wanting to get there, to understand him.
Which was impossible.
Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted
And the fairy tales have all been told
There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow
More precious than a pot of gold
The phenomenon of that kiss was...
It can't be overstated.
It was...
...a superb moment in the history of folk music.
And maybe...
...maybe a great moment in the history of humans.
I'd like to think that Mitch would agree to do this with me.
Because I already said yes.
And I can't do it alone, so...
No, I didn't think this through.
Should've talked to him beforehand, but I haven't talked to him in so long.
It wasn't...
We weren't talking.
You know, those last few years...
Okay, I'm remembering some things now, yeah. There was lots of fighting going on.
And I think for a while we were able...
...to keep it on a professional level.
But really, we were getting some personal things out.
I was just out of high school,
I had just started here.
And I must say I was in awe of Mitch and Mickey. I mean, who wasn't?
They were here working on
When You're Next To Me...
...which was their last album together.
Mickey started shouting at Mitch.
She just went off.
She started throwing anything she could get her hands on at Mitch. Anything.
Music stands, microphone stands, mikes, guitars.
And Mitch...
He just...
He just snapped.
It's time to kick on back
Toss your cares away
Cartwheels and piggybacks
It's just that kind of day
I'm sitting on a hill
Watching clouds at play
Well, I've been playing the music of The Main Street Singers...
...my whole life, I mean, from way back in Tampa.
I've come to understand as an adult, with the help of Laurie, my beautiful wife...
...that there had been abuse in my family, but it was mostly musical in nature.
My father used to lock me away in a room...
...with nothing but the Percy Faith recording of "Bim Bam Boom"...
...and then send me to bed with nothing but dessert.
One of the records he put me in there with was Sunny Side Up.
The Main Street Singers, 1968.
I tell you, my head opened up, my heart opened up.
I listened to that record over and over and over.
I knew it right and left and every way to Sunday.
I feel like I knew those people.
I wanted to be in that group so badly...
...that at the age of 8 years old,
I went down into the basement...
...and I made cardboard cutouts of everybody in the group to sing with them.
These were my friends, and they were made out of gin boxes.
It's odd that Laurie came from such a different--
Right. A completely different path.
I was brought up in a very small town, south of the Chicago city limits.
Just far enough away to have been peopled with pure, unadulterated white trash.
And because I was one of so many children,
I don't believe that anyone noticed...
...when I blew town at 15 and ended up in San Francisco, California.
And it's at this point in my story that the dark clouds part...
...because I met a certain Mr. Wiseman, who gave me a job in his shop.
And before long, he tapped me to do some small roles...
...in some of his short films for more mature audiences.
And before long, I had landed, if you will, some leads...
...and then I started to do some cameos.
Well, I was known for doing a certain thing...
...that many of the other girls wouldn't do.
Of course, I loved to sing, ever since I was a little girl.
And I learned to play the ukulele in one of my last films, Not So Tiny Tim.
And based on that, my world opened up...
...because I was invited to join the re-formed New Main Street Singers.
And that's where I met my man, and before long I was the new Mrs. Bohner.
Ain't that something?
-A beautiful story.
-I tell you.
Last week you were going to come in at 5...
...and you never showed up.
It's okay, it's just that--
-He's in. Mitch is in.
-Really?
-It's unbelievable.
-Congratulations!
-Thank you. Thank you.
-He said he would be a part of this?
-Yes.
-He said that just now on the phone?
-Yeah, I think he did.
-Did he put it in writing?
I'm sorr--
I'm just looking out for you.
Let's not rain on the parade, okay?
He's in.
In 1974, after the breakup,
Mitch was extremely angry.
His first solo album...
...a Cry For Help, contained numbers like "If I Had A Gun"...
..."Anyone But You," "May She Rot in Hell."
And this just spiraled down...
...to the next album, Calling It Quits.
And at that point he was in a very bad way.
There was a lot of anger in Mitch...
...for reasons, you know, that he had.
I think he went too soon.
He should have stayed longer, because we really didn't get a grip on him.
And his anger was unhealthy...
...for all of us.
-Hello, Mickey.
-Mitch.
-How are you?
-Great.
-It's good to see you.
-You too. So...
-Mitch Cohen, this is my husband.
-Leonard Crabbe, very nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.
-Welcome to the house of Crabbe.
Thank you very much.
I just checked into the hotel.
Left my things there.
-Good.
-Which hotel was that, then?
I don't know the name.
I can't remember the name, but it's very nice.
Are you hungry?
-Yes.
-Good. Lunch is not quite ready.
Maybe you'd like to take Mitch to see your trains?
Oh, yes. Do you like trains?
I took a bus.
No. Model trains.
Do you like model trains?
-Sure.
-It's a bit of a passion for me.
I'll show you around.
It's right down here.
-It was a 16-hour trip.
-This will be quicker than that.
This whole area here is called Crabbe Town.
We've got a brothel down there above the saloon.
And right down there, further along,
I'm thinking of building a French Quarter.
-I've actually got a bit of French blood.
-I'd love to see this town in the autumn.
I think Crabbeville in autumn would look quite magnificent.
I would have made tiny little leaves...
...oak, poplar, maple, chestnut...
...and spread them across the town of Crabbeville.
Magnificent.
It's Crabbe Town, not Crabbeville.
What is it you do, Leonard?
For work?
Oh, work.
I'm in the bladder management industry.
I sell catheters.
I have my own distribution company.
Sure-Flo Medical Appliances.
May have heard of it.
It's actually named in tribute after my mother. Her name was Florence.
It's a growth industry, really, because one in three people over 60...
...either have a flaccid or a spastic bladder...
...so, in a sense, every 13.5 seconds, a new incontinent is born, as it were.
People like you and I have what they call "leakage problems."
They can be running, playing tennis, laughing, sneezing, anything.
The good old constipation, you know?
You have impacted fecal mass in your rectum pushing on your bladder.
This might make good dessert talk.
I started playing folk clubs in New York City...
...and walked into one such coffeehouse one night and there--
-Half Moon Cafe.
-The Half Moon Cafe and--
I was playing with my sisters,
Jocelyn, Claire, Estelle.
We were the North Four.
We were on-stage and we had a horrible little heckler.
A little guy, but with the loudest voice in the world.
And just, you know, "Take off your tops" and "Get off the stage"...
"You sing like crap! You get off the stage!"
Very inarticulate. Rude.
Mean. Mean little bugger.
All of a sudden, we couldn't see clear, you got the lights on us...
...but I see this tall, dark figure go over and there's this intense little...
...something going on, and all of a sudden, he's pummeled.
-The crap pummeled out of him.
-I don't remember much.
But the next thing I know,
I'm in a hospital, and the first thing I saw...
...was a beautiful rose sitting in a vase on the night table next to the bed.
And I can't express...
...what was surging through my body.
I was consumed with an emotion...
...that I had never felt before.
We started singing together.
We simply fused together...
...in a very meaningful way.
And before you know it, we were recording.
-I learned to sing with Mitch.
-And--
So scary, so scary. But I just...
Mitch was so strong and so smart and knew what he wanted...
...and I just focused on Mitch.
You know,
I went along for the ride.
One, two, three, and...
-Wait. I doubled after you?
-No, with me. That's doubling.
-You climb aboard the ferry at the same time.
-Okay, fair enough.
One, two, three, and...
My mama was the cold north wind
My daddy was the son of a railroad man
From west of hell
Where the trains don't even run
Never heard the whistle
Of a southbound freight
Or the humming of its driving wheel
No, I never did no wandering
Never did no wandering
Never did no wandering after all
I just, sorry, I just got a mental picture in my mind of us on-stage in the show.
And we weren't wearing the old stuff, the old gear, the old...
We're talking about the dickeys?
I think I'm on record as Mr. Anti-dickey.
You were Mr. Drop-the-dickey.
-It's just a very retro look.
-I'm totally available for the discussion of it.
It sounds like you're thinking the image that we had...
...was a retro image of something that wasn't retro because we weren't retro...
-...because we were then.
-It wasn't retro then...
...but now, to try a retro thing, it might just look kind of sad.
-I mean...
-To do then now would be retro.
To do then then was very now-tro, if you will.
I know we're getting emotional with things and I know we want to give this...
...to be a great thing for you know who, but I'm looking at numbers--
For Dad. Can't you say it? For Dad.
You can't say his name, can you?
You're not the only one that's thinking about Dad now.
You're not the only person going through this--
You don't have to take everything personally.
It's not you. It's her. Forgive me.
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Never mind.
This isn't really just a reunion for the folk groups.
It's also a reunion for the Steinbloom family, minus Dad, of course.
-Because we never get together.
-Not really.
-We talk. A lot. We talk a lot.
-We talk on the phone a lot.
-We don't really see each other.
-No. We don't need to.
I moved away to North Dakota.
I tried to get far away to get the singing out of my head.
I didn't care for folk music and Dad knew that. I just didn't get it.
So I haven't kept up our ties.
That's why this is kind of nice.
Hopefully we can get through our little things...
...and put on a good show for Dad.
You like to make amends, but you can't, so we'll try to do it with one good--
Music.
You okay?
Let's just hang on.
Oh, Jesus.
My dad, Fred Knox, was an original Main Street Singer...
...so I grew up with this kind of music.
So I listened to it when I was little.
But I didn't hear much of it when
I was a teenager because I was--
I was on the streets.
I was really rescued by
The New Main Street Singers...
...and they really gave me a break from that...
...dark, that darkness.
And...
So I like to give people a break now.
So when I sing, I want to give out what was given to me.
And I want to be, you know, a vessel of love...
...and I want to entertain and make people happy.
So I look for someone out in the audience and that's what brings me real joy.
So when Mr. Menschell called me in 1995, my dad died...
...and asked me to be a part of this band, I said:
"Well, yeah."
Going home
I'm going
Go--
Going
Go
Going home
I'm going home
Home
Home
Go--
Quick plugola, I'm Mike LaFontaine, owner and founder of Hi-Class Management.
Comic's constant companion.
Let's start right out.
Hey, wha' happened?
As you know, back in 1970...
I starred on a series called, Wha' Happened.
Every time something would go wrong,
I'd look at the camera and say:
"Hey, wha' happened?"
We had fun with that and other catch phrases.
"I got a real red wagon!"
And, "I can't do my work!"
And I believe I was the first one to use the phrase, "I don't think so!"
It lasted a year. That's good because that's how you establish a cult.
I was on-stage doing my shtick, "Hey, wha' happened?" and "I can't do my work!"
If someone would heckle me, they'd say, "Will you be on-stage all night?"
I would say, "That's right!" and that would crack up the audience.
But I noticed a guy sitting down front with a long face, nothing got to him.
So I said to the lady next to him:
"Hold your mirror up in front of his nose to see if he's breathing.
To see if there's a reflection."
So he started to smile.
After the show I go down and introduce myself. His name is George Menschell.
He had been with a group called
The Main Street Singers.
I was never into folk music.
I'd worked some bills with some folkies.
Put him in a cell with a long hose on him
Put him in a cell with a long hose on him
I used to say,
"If he's got a long enough hose...
...he's gonna have friends in the shower room!"
Folk audiences hated that joke.
But I said to George, I said:
"Seriously, you've put up some great numbers.
If you re-form your group, I can send you out on the Starfish Cruise Lines.
Together, we could make a fortune and you will have a ball."
They used to go out, come back, they had a great time. Except a couple of cruises...
...dysentery broke out on the ship.
I was not there.
You do not want to be on a cruise ship when dysentery breaks out...
...and knock on the men's room door,
"Will you be coming out soon?"...
...and hear, "I don't think so!"
I'm so glad to be here.
I love the network.
I love what you do here.
I watch it constantly.
That's what I wanted to start by saying.
I think you're doing a fabulous job.
And I'm very, very happy to be here talking with you.
It's a perfect fit.
Our demographics are skewing older...
...and that can be a minus with corporate underwriters.
In this case, it's a plus because of the built-in fans for The Folksmen...
...all the groups that your dad represented.
And, you know, I think it's gonna do very well in the evening hours...
...which is when we'd propose to do this concert.
If you don't mind me saying, our audience for some of these groups is getting younger.
Not radically younger.
Which I hope is all right.
If we can get two dozen young people watching in the evening hours...
...I think people here would be happy because we don't have much of that now.
This is great and I want to tell you...
...if you're not weary of hearing stories about your dad, I want to tell you a little story.
A young kid by the name of Lars Olfen, in 1966, going to a concert.
I'm 16 years old and it was raining.
And I got right up to the box office and like some kind of practical joke...
...the door slammed shut.
Sold out, right when I got there.
My young tears mixed with the rain,
I'm walking away and I hear a voice.
"Hey, kid, over here."
And I go, "What, a scalper?
Who is this guy? I can't afford that kind of money for a ticket."
But he looks kind of familiar and I go over there.
He hands me two tickets, doesn't want a dollar.
It's your father. Why would he do that?
That was Dad, you know.
He was just out there, with people.
And he was generous, he was kind and really that's why we're doing this thing...
...to pay back this much back to his memory.
The naches I'm feeling right now.
Your dad was like mishpoche to me.
When I heard I got these tickets to
The Folksmen, I let out a geshreeyeh...
...and I'm running with my friend like a vilde chaye...
...right into the theater, in the front row.
We've got the schpilkes because we're sitting right there.
It's a mitzvah what your dad did, and I want to try to give that back to you.
Okeinhoreh, I say, and God bless him.
Where did I go up? I remember hitting a...
We shared a song
I think it might be on "the ravens," on "the ravens."
"We shared."
I think you might stay below me on--
Stay on: We shared
Wandered
Wandered through each other's secrets
We traded
We traded
You're right! Mitch, you're right!
Oh, I forgot that.
We traded an honored worth
That's it, nice and crisp!
That's very nice.
Walking down to Main Street
Everybody's gonna sing
There you go.
What are you singing there?
You got the root on "sing"?
You singing the root?
No, I was singing:
Everybody's gonna sing
Didn't I give you a sixth?
-I don't think so.
-Tony, I give him a sixth?
I think you were singing the sixth.
-Can you sing me a sixth?
-Could you sing a sixth?
-Everybody gonna sing
-Everybody gonna sing
-Yeah, I can sing that. Sure.
-Let's try it again. One, two, three.
What? Yeah?
-Go ahead.
-You have a problem in the bridge?
No, I was gonna--
Can I switch?
Can I change out of my costume?
Costume? Are you hot?
Yeah. But also, I mean...
...I've been wearing it for a month.
You know the policy.
We all gotta wear the uniform until we're ready to take it off.
You're close, I just don't think you're quite there yet.
You did not sing that sixth, and I want to see you sing that sixth.
You just wear what you have on.
You sound fine.
Eventually you'll be able to wear your civvies when you're singing.
Jonathan? Hi.
Well, I got good news and better news.
Good news is, we're still doing the concert.
The better news is, we are going live.
Yeah.
I got a friend, at NO AA, so we're going up in the Nimbus 7 Oceanographic Satellite.
He's got some bandwidth there, and it's live!
Yeah, the corporate underwriters wouldn't go for it, so...
I'm excited too!
Okay. Okay.
Shalom.
Folk music is in my blood.
As a young boy, in Sweden-- I was born there and came here at an early age...
...but we'd go back to Sweden every year, my family and I, in the winter...
...which was a flip from the normal thing.
Every Olfen kid, Lars, Sven, Pippi and Liv, was trained on the dulcimer.
When you could hold a rattle, you'd hold a dulcimer. And we learned to play.
I had a garage band in Stockholm, which was a challenge in its own right...
...to keep an instrument tuned with that temperature swing.
There's a block warmer for the Volvo in the garage...
...but it's cold in there in the winter.
So we played and I had a hit that you might have heard of.
Which means, "How's It Hanging, Grandma?" and it was big on the Swedish charts.
I got in touch with the American music.
I loved that and thrived on that...
...so I came here and became part of that scene.
I'm so happy to be here and come full circle, airing this show on PBN.
It's a dream come true.
I worked the fields my father worked
From dawn till setting sun
Then it quiets down.
And the skeletons of Quinto
Call me home
"The silver tentacles of the moon's rays haunt me... "
That's really getting confusing.
It's really confusing.
It's really confusing. I'm hearing you the same timbre, and it's cluttered.
Maybe if I did it higher and he did it lower--
-If you do what you did before.
-I can't get that much higher.
But that's-- Now it sounds almost more like a ventriloquist.
Can I make the radical suggestion that maybe this is not the best number...
...to start with?
This is a live television show.
We don't want people to reach for their remotes here.
It's public television.
I don't think...
-They don't have remotes.
-Yeah.
My God, that's terrible. What do you mean he won't come out of the room?
Have you talked to him? Has he talked to a doctor? Have you given him medication?
I know he's anxious.
I'm always anxious. I come out.
You know, I mean, we gotta do something.
You want me to-- You mean,
I'm supposed to talk to him?
I like him, I don't have that much to say to him.
I could be empathetic.
I'm not sure what else I could do.
I could sit, I could try.
Anything, we have to do something.
I'll talk to him. I'm happy to.
I gotta get him out of there.
We're not broadcasting from a motel room.
We gotta get him out of there.
What's happening here?
Could you run your hand over that?
-What are you getting?
-Well, I'm getting a bounce.
But there's a lightness within it, as well.
Interesting. You know, honey, it's a very tricky color.
Terry and I worship an unconventional deity.
The power of another dimension.
Now, you're not going to read about this dimension in a book, or in a magazine...
...or in a newspaper...
...because it doesn't exist anywhere...
...except in my own mind.
Through our ceremonies and our rituals...
...we have witnessed firsthand...
...the awesome and vibratory power of color.
We experience it as alive...
...and constantly shaping our experience.
And we believe that this saturated energy...
...is the basis of all creation.
We are WINC. W-I-N-C.
Witches In Nature's Colors. WINC.
The word "witch " may be a problem for some of you. It has silly connotations.
No, we do not ride around on broomsticks and wear pointy hat--
Well, we don't ride on broomsticks.
This is not an occult science.
This is not one of those crazy systems...
...of divination and astrology.
That's hooey...
...and you gotta have a screw loose to go in for it.
Our beliefs are fairly commonplace and simple to understand.
Humankind is simply materialized color...
...operating on the 49th vibration.
You'd make that conclusion...
...walking down the street or going to the store.
I know this is a lot of pressure for you to be under.
And I don't want you to feel you have to push yourself too far. Okay?
This is a one-day-at-a-time kind of thing.
Don't think you have to achieve anything right away.
Very important to back off the pressure.
Okay?
There's a deception here.
The audience...
...they're expecting to see a man who no longer exists.
Well, you know, that may be true.
It might indeed be true.
But I think what you have--
-Oh, baby.
-Oh, baby.
Can I--?
Loco man
Watching all the fish swim away
He no work
He just sleep and play
Sitting here on the sand
Talking about the loco man.
Sunny land
Coconut coming down all the time
Milk, she sweeter than honey wine
Sitting here on the sand
Sun breaks over the sprits'l yard
Jib sheets hauling to leeward hard
Crosstrees humming a morning hymn
-I'm the cabin boy, call me Jim
-His name's Jim
Fare away, fare away
Under main top sail
To the furbelow of the wily whale
Hold on. One second, please.
I got an idea. Very literate reference.
Are you familiar with a book about a pirate captain, his name is Moby Dick?
He was chasing some big whale.
He had a catch phrase he'd always yell out, "There she blows!"
If you could do that, we'd have someone off-stage drench the group with water.
And you could look at the camera and say, "Hey, wha' happened?"
And every time, another thing of water...
And by the end you're all soaked, even the ladies...
At the end of the song you turn the guitars over and water splashes out.
Kerplunk!
It's just a thought.
Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted
And the fairy tales have all been told
There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow
More precious than a pot of gold
My sweet, my dear, my darling
You're so far away from me
Though an ocean of tears divides us
Let the bridge of our love span the sea
There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow
More precious than a pot of gold
We're pleased to have the folk people here tomorrow.
It's not something we usually do.
This is more of a classical venue.
But it'll be a lot of fun.
It's like having a carnival come to town.
I'm the events liaison.
People here call me "King Larry" or "Your Majesty"...
...because I do everything that needs to be done.
I've been up into the highest catwalk changing light bulbs.
I've been in the basement changing the rat traps.
I'm also a singer.
I'm not a professional, but I do like to sing in church...
...and, you know, places like juvenile halls.
But this...
This is the best place to sing in
New York and possibly the world.
The acoustics are just perfect.
-Did I miss it?
-No. It's about a mile.
-I'm not sure if I'm going north or south.
-Where is it again?
The guy said Midtown.
He said you can't miss it.
-It has chrome on the front of the hotel.
-You wanna hang a left.
-I'm gonna make a left.
-Try again.
-Do you have a map?
-I have a map, but not in the car.
Were you planning to study it later academically, or...?
-Is it on the way?
-Look, guys, I'll get us here.
Nobody's busting your chops. Yet.
-It's just a question of time.
-Pull over and let me drive.
I don't want you to.
I don't know where I am.
We're excited to be involved with this project.
It will be a challenge for me because I'm not a fan of folk music.
-Me too!
-I could care less about it.
But that doesn't matter in the business of public relations...
...which is what we do.
It matters what you think. And it matters what we can make you think.
What we can sell to you.
And a product you'll love to buy.
That's the way we look at this concert.
And if we can't do that, we fake it.
That's also part of public relations.
We're professionals here, you see.
We get ideas that help sell.
We work together very well.
It's almost as like we have one brain...
...that we share between us.
It's like I'll have an idea, it will just be a teeny, tiny little spark...
...and then it will get to Wally and he'll make it a fire.
I don't know about you, but I'm predicting a lot of exciting...
...amazing things that happen to the groups.
Like big, like, not just big, but big-time stuff.
Ladies and gentlemen, as deputy mayor, it gives me no greater pleasure...
...than to officially declare tomorrow...
...Saturday, June 22...
...Folk Music Day in the Big Apple.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Your Honor, or Your deputy Honor.
I have two questions.
One, is New York City ready to hear...
...a rebirth of some of the finest folk music ever created in this city?
Yes, I think so!
And my second question is, where's the real mayor? Wha' happened?
Someone shot the mayor, they did not shoot the deputy.
The DA's office called. They can't find any witnesses, so he's in the clear.
Let me say a few words about The New Main Street Singers.
One of the founding members has passed away, but he's with us tonight anyway!
George Menschell! Come on up here and say something, George.
How are you? You wanna say something?
Come on, say something!
Thank you sincerely, Your Honor...
...which reminds me, I was at a swingers party and a guy said to me:
"I'd like to meet your wife."
I said, "Your honor!"
To paraphrase an old joke:
Knock, knock. Who's there?
It's The New Main Street Singers!
Thank you so much.
-Thank you. You can take this.
-Okay.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.
Don't forget to buy the CDs.
Seeing these long lines of fans...
...who want nothing more than to have you sign an autograph...
...it's like it's 1968...
...or '67, or '66.
The good years.
It's so wonderful to see the people...
...that have enjoyed your music all these years.
And there's so many of them.
And they just want to shake your hand and say:
"We dig what you do."
And then there's the kids.
We're hearing, "You rock."
"You rock me."
"You rock my world." What--?
I was flashing back to the rush of adrenaline we used to get...
...arriving at the concert hall...
...having stagehands saying,
"Good show, Mitch."
"Good luck, Mickey, tonight."
And we'd wait backstage, hearing the crowd chanting.
"Mickey, Mickey, Mitch, Mitch!"
Walking out into the spot...
...the sound of the crowd cheering...
...the decibel level.
For me it was just watching you.
Because I couldn't think about me actually being up there. Watching you.
I look forward to that, Mitch.
-I wonder if it'll happen tomorrow night.
-Oh, yeah.
-And I'll be there.
-We'll see.
I'll be there in the best seat in the house.
I guess you can make money in folk music.
-Yeah, I guess you can.
-Yeah.
It's usually because of acts like The New Main Street Singers.
That commercial crapola.
I'm a model train enthusiast.
Oh, that's great!
I've got a whole layout in my basement.
It's very much a big passion for me.
Yeah, thank God for model trains.
-Absolutely.
-If they didn't have model trains...
...they wouldn't have gotten the idea for the big trains.
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi, everybody. Just be a second.
Don't want to interrupt.
We're having a great time.
I'd like to propose a big, big toast...
...in honor of Dad.
He was an amazing and a wonderful, loving father...
...a fantastic person in general.
And I think anybody who even knew Dad just for a second...
...knew that he had an amazing hum.
And wherever he went, he would suddenly break into a hum.
And anybody who heard this hum would just be happy.
And in honor of Dad,
I'd like to say, let's all pause...
...let's raise our glasses and let's hum for Dad.
Okay, bring it down. Back up.
Okay, bring it across. Bring it across.
-Right on down here.
-Here, hold it.
-So, what do you got? You got vocal?
-Vocal.
-Some of them are already in there.
-They've been assigned directions?
Yeah. We do this every single day.
This is just like clockwork.
-Those are microphones?
-Microphone stands.
-They don't have tops on them.
-Pardon?
They'll have tops when we're done, don't worry. We do this every day.
Mike heads.
Would you call them a "mike head," or would it be the "mike"?
It's called a microphone, and you'll get them. Don't worry.
-We really want them.
-You'll have them.
Town hall. Tonight.
Mitch and Mickey at the Town Hall.
Two weeks rehearsal.
That's the way to play Town Hall.
Crazy. New phrasing. Different keys.
But couldn't have happened any other way.
If we'd stayed together, we wouldn't be at Town Hall now.
We'd be lucky to be in Branson, opening for The Main Street Singers.
Nope.
This was our crazy way of getting here.
Well, I'm feeling very relaxed.
Very confident. Very focused.
You know, 35 years ago, preparing for a concert...
...meant playing "find the cobra" with a hotel chambermaid.
But tonight, I feel good.
I feel excited.
I feel ready for whatever the experience is...
...that we will take with us after the show.
I'm sure it will be an adventure...
...a voyage on this magnificent vessel...
...into uncharted waters.
What if we see sailfish jumping...
...and flying across the magnificent orb of a setting sun?
I think it's impeccable.
It says happiness, it says opening night.
It says, "I love folk music but I'm not afraid of classical." It's beautiful.
I'm a little afraid of these pokey things that are sticking out.
-Apple blossoms.
-Is that what they're called?
They're at eye height. Someone could come over to sniff, admire...
...and poke an eye out.
I'd love to clip it off.
If we could get a shape to them, that's my basic creative issues.
I have a health and safety issue.
Those viny things.
They're a disaster.
They're too low, too tangly.
They're just waiting for an elderly person to wheel by...
...or somebody in a walker, or with a brace on their leg.
A lot of my family is beyond old, and--
I've got an idea. Let's get carnations and a beer stein and put them up here.
I don't see how that would work.
I've adopted the practice...
...of taking care of my skin.
It's something, you know, sometimes you get razzed a little bit.
I think Jerry was razzing me the other day at Alan's house about it.
He caught me in the bathroom...
...and I did that thing where
I put my hands down fast...
...and he said, "What are you doing there?" But really...
...Norwegian fishermen have used hand cream for centuries.
And with that regimen, and it's a very simple one...
...I know that when I walk out on-stage tonight, I will-- My skin...
...will look its best in front of 2000 people.
That will give me the confidence that will help me to play my best...
...and sing my best and be my best...
...and you can't put a price on that.
-Tammy, we all set on the pre-record?
-Yeah.
You know, I produced a reunion show before.
Before I came to PBN
I did the Good Times reunion.
People wanted more close-ups. I want to make sure we get plenty of close-ups.
We have plenty of close-ups scheduled.
Another great thing would be one of those shots where you pull back...
...to see the enormity of the event and the venue.
Would be a crane.
Do we have a crane standing by?
-No, we don't have a crane.
-Wow!
You know those swooping shots where it goes over the audience...
...and hammers in on a shot of one of the musicians playing?
-That would be great.
-It would be.
Or when they pull back, kind of like a California Adventure ride...
...where you see the whole thing, that would be nice too.
It would be.
I could make some calls, if we could get one. I don't know if it's too late.
-All right, here's your giant banjo.
-It's very flat.
It doesn't look flat from in the audience.
It has basically no dimension to it.
It's painted to look three-dimensional.
If you go back there--
But it's not painted on the back.
Will you look with me for a minute?
From the audience it will look fine.
It looks three-dimensional.
Go out there and take a peek.
Is this the real furniture or the rehearsal furniture?
It's not called "furniture."
It's a set.
It's painted this way. It looks completely three-dimensional from the audience.
So this is the real furniture, and this is...
-Is this an actual street lamp?
-I'm sure it was at one time.
Can you have an actual three-dimensional object...
...that represents the thing that it actually is, can that be next to...
-...something that it's pretending to be?
-Yes, it's perfectly fine.
I have no time to explain Stagecraft 101.
This show starts in an hour.
-Everything is exactly the way you--
-Those are lights hanging up there?
Those are lights, and that's a ceiling above us!
-But they look shaky.
-No, they're perfectly--
Is that wire? I see a wire.
I see a--
Fellas, thanks a lot for coming and doing this for Dad.
Honestly, that's so beautiful.
And thank you for the flowers, the little banjo.
Did you like that?
We had to get rid of the lavender because it attacked my eyes.
-Sorry about that.
-Listen, the thought was wonderful.
I remember you guys staying at the house and...
I remember you were always trying to get a poker game started.
You were, like, 15 years old with a deck of cards in your hands.
-Penny stakes.
-Yeah.
You always teased me with those card games. You taught me cards.
Yeah, we didn't know you were gonna turn into a monster on us.
Mitch.
You okay?
Yes.
This flame, like all flames, represents the light and the darkness.
It also represents the uncertainty of life and its delicacy.
It also represents a penis.
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue
Indigo, violet
-Ten seconds to air.
-Roll pre-record on my count.
Seven...
...six, five, four...
...three, two...
Roll A. Fade up on A.
PBN New York is proud to present:
Live from Town Hall,
Ode to Irving...
...an evening of folk music.
Featuring The New Main Street Singers...
...The Folksmen and Mitch and Mickey.
And now your host,
Mr. Jonathan Steinbloom.
Hello, I'm Jonathan Steinbloom, and before we begin tonight...
...I would like to make a brief announcement.
I'd like to warn you that some of the floral arrangements here tonight...
...have dangerously low-hanging vines...
...and may be poisonous, so please, don't eat them.
And don't become entangled in them or trip, please.
On behalf of the entire
Steinbloom family...
...welcome to Ode to Irving.
Thank you. Thank you.
Please join all of us and give a really warm welcome to our first group...
...about whom Dad used to say...
...they were the kind of infectious that it was good to spread around.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The New Main Street Singers.
Thank you, New York City, for that very warm welcome.
Gee, I got a question.
Anybody care to hear some folk music?
Never did no wandering
Never did no wandering
Never did no wandering after all
Never did no wandering
My mother was the cold north wind
My daddy was the son of a railroad man
From west of hell
Where the trains don't even run
Never heard the whistle
Of a lonesome freight
Or the singing of its driving wheel
Oh, I never did no wandering
I didn't say a word.
I don't know.
Never did no wandering after all
They say the highway's just one big road
And it goes from here to there
You swear to God you didn't talk to Menschell about the set?
You didn't tell him what we were opening with?
I saw you talking to Terry Bohner.
Him and his blue sweater.
I said, "Isn't it warm?"
Nothing about the set.
Well, it's getting warmer now.
I don't think finger-pointing is gonna help us here. I...
-I think it's clear what we do.
-What?
-I'm gonna suggest we be bold.
-Yeah, let's hear it.
We open with "Wandering."
Did you miss the last couple of minutes?
They're butchering--
-Turn it back up.
-We give the audience a choice.
We say you can enjoy a toothpaste commercial or hear folk music.
They've brushed their teeth by that time, it's not even germane.
You can't have, especially on a folk bill, two people doing the same song.
That doesn't work.
They'll just be flat-out confused.
Never did no wandering after all
Easy now!
Never did no wandering
Never did no wandering
Never did no wandering after all
No, I never did no wandering
After all
Oh, boy. Thank you very much!
That song is so fun to sing.
I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.
Before we go a little bit further, we'd like to introduce ourselves.
Hi there, I'm Terry Bohner.
I'm going out for some air.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes.
One night Mama went to fetch
Herself a sweet potato
Fell down the cellar stairs
Stork dropped in
While she was on the floor
So my sister was born down there
Daddy said this one will be nothing but a
Misery, never will be worth a damn
But Mama just loved her
Little sweet potato baby
With a face like a parboiled yam
Come on, boys
Potato's in the paddy wagon
I know you don't want to hear this, but it's a major key, it's up-tempo...
...we open with "Old Joe's Place."
We go out, do the song we're known for, get it out of the way.
And then, hey, here's the icing on the cake.
-What's the icing?
-The icing's the rest of the act.
-That's the cake.
-No, that's the dressing.
Mom and Daddy put together
Quite a little posse
Counting me and Jack and Cousin Will
We all hopped into the old Chevy pickup
And we caught them at the top of the hill
Daddy took his Remington
And shot away the lock
For to set his little darling free
But Potato said
Daddy, shut the goldarn door
Sheriff wants to marry me
Let's go, boys
Potato's in the paddy wagon
Guess we better leave her there
Let's go, boys
Potato's in the paddy wagon
Mama says it's more than fair
Mama says it's more than fair
Ladies and gentlemen,
The New Main Street Singers.
I have been watching and observing as The New Main Street Singers...
Boy, that's fun! That's really fun, man.
How did we sound?
-We weren't really listening.
-We were downstairs.
I couldn't hear so well, but, shoot,
I'm sorry you guys--
And now, please join me in welcoming our next three talented performers.
Taken alone they are merely
Jerry Palter...
...Alan Barrows and Mark Shubb.
But when you put them all together...
...they spell "absolutely fantastic."
Ladies and gentlemen, The Folksmen!
Thank you. Yeah, it's really us.
-Wow.
-The waiting is over.
Long time no see.
Can't tell you.
Great to be back.
We'd like to do our hit.
You might remember it, we hope you do.
Whenever I'm out wandering
Chasing a rainbow dream
I often stop and think
About a place I've never seen
Where friendly folks can gather
And raise the rafters high
-Hey.
-Hey, pretty lady!
-You guys were great.
-Wonderful crowd.
-Have you seen Mitch?
-No.
Okay.
Mitch?
Pick it!
That's nice.
Well, there's a puppy in the parlor
And a skillet on the stove
And a smelly old blanket
That a Navajo wove
There's popcorn in the popper
And a porker in the pot
There's pie in the pantry
And the coffee's always hot
Just look for the busted neon sign
That flashes
Ea-a-oe's
Well, there's a puppy in the parlor
And a skillet on the stove
And a smelly old blanket
That a Navajo wove
There's popcorn in the popper
And a porker in the pot
There's pie in the pantry
And the coffee's always hot
There's sausage in the morning
And a party every night
There's a nurse on duty
If you don't feel right
There's chicken on the table
But you gotta say grace
There's always something cooking
At Old Joe's Place
Thank you!
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Very nice of you.
What a great crowd.
This crowd might want to join us...
...in a little audience participation.
We're not gonna be working up here by ourselves!
First time through, relax.
Second time, we'll put you to work.
We'll start off with
Mr. Alan Barrows on the banjo.
What?
Every morning at 5:00
The farmer jumps out of bed
Washes up, he ties his shoes
Puts his hat upon his head
So far, so good.
-Ready, two.
-Two.
-Ready, three, wide.
-Three.
Oh, my God. Mitch is gone.
He's just, he's gone.
Mitch is gone. Oh, my God.
Without Mitch, we got gornisht.
We have nothing.
Well, we're gonna go find him.
We'll need some chickens.
We got any chickens?
How about this aisle?
Beyond this aisle.
Just beyond the man with the big shirt.
I want you to be my chickens.
I want to hear your best chicken sound.
Pretty good. That's the ticket.
You got it.
Now we want to hear from our horse people. This section.
Not people with a sore throat, people who can do a believable neigh!
We're gonna put a saddle on you folks. Not really.
Does he have a cell phone or a pager?
-He's wandering. He likes to wander.
-They go on in a couple of minutes!
-He got a little nervous.
-I don't need this tsuris in my life.
I'm sure it's fine. Let's calm down.
-Is there a cockfight arena near here?
-She's joking, right?
At least he's not lying on the ground or anything.
-Why didn't someone go out with him?
-What?
-Can she do these songs solo?
-It's not my fault.
And the chickens cluck
The horses neigh
Crickets go fiddle-dee-dee
-Yes, they do.
-And the bullfrogs croak
The pigs oink, oink
It's a barnyard symphony
-Thank you so much.
-Excellent.
-Give yourselves a big hand.
-Give yourselves a big pat on the back.
Thank you very, very much for coming.
Thank you, Irv. Thanks for the good seats.
We are The Folksmen. We hope you've had a wonderful time tonight.
Thank you. Good night.
We gotta give them more.
We have to give them more.
Thank you for having us back.
We have a song we'd like to do called "The Skeletons of Quinto."
We don't often do encores, and this is why.
It has to do with a time that I often think about...
...when this time of year rolls around.
A time of conflict and bloodshed.
The Spanish Civil War.
But our group historian, Mr. Mark Shubb, knows more about that than I do.
Thank you very much, Alan.
In the late 1930s of the last century,
Spain was wracked by civil war.
What are you doing? Mitch could be lying face down in a ditch!
-Would you consider doing both parts?
-No. I'd consider going home...
...bake a nice tray of Nanaimo bars, lie in bed, watch TV.
That's what I like doing!
Mitch, where the hell were you?
-Are we on?
-You've been on for five minutes.
It's too late. I forgot what a selfish--
It just took me a while to find a good one.
-That is nice.
-It's nice.
In the late summer, early fall of 1938...
...so the story goes behind this particular song...
...in the green hills just outside the city of Bar--
-Good night, everybody!
-Good night. Thank you very much.
They're called The Folksmen, but after tonight's performance...
...I think we're all going to have to call them "The Spokesmen"...
...because they sing beautifully and they tell a fascinating story.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I have two words for you:
Mitch and Mickey.
We love you!
Thank you.
Thank you so much for letting Mitch and I do this again.
It does not seem like just yesterday that Mitch and I met...
...and started making music together.
I don't know if any of you know or would even remember...
...that Mitch and I met in the hospital.
Mitch was there with his jaw wired shut...
...after defending the honor of a girl he didn't even know.
Me.
And I, of course, was there to visit.
I felt really bad.
And the only way that Mitch could communicate with me was on paper.
Every word of it poetry.
And if you don't mind, Mitch...
...I have the very first poem...
...that you wrote me.
Parched in exile
Thirsty for your smile
Though silenced behind
This barbed-wire mask
Your spirit burns through
That I might bask
In your cool, misty loveliness
I just wanted a drink of water.
Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted
And the fairy tales have all been told
There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow
I know this song.
This is that really pretty one.
With the kiss.
Turn it up a little bit.
-Remember?
-Yeah. Where they used to...
Yeah.
Wonder how they're gonna handle that.
-Five dollars says they do it.
-And a kiss is the oath that they swear
And when the veil of dreams has lifted
And the fairy tales have all been told
There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow
More precious than a pot of gold
My sweet, my dear, my darling
You're so far away from me
Though an ocean of tears divides us
-Let the bridge of our love span the sea
-Three. Twenty-two. Two.
Your kiss
There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow
More precious than a pot of
Gold
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Are you okay?
Excuse me, sir. Sorry. Sorry.
Hi, everybody!
-Good to be back!
-Thank you.
Thank you again.
We're back!
-"Mighty Wind."
-"Mighty Wind" in C.
One in C. Here we go.
One, two, three.
As I traveled down the back roads
Of this home I love so much
Every carpenter and cowboy
Every lame man on a crutch
They're all talking about a feeling
About a taste that's in the air
They're all talking about this mighty wind
That's blowing everywhere
Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing
It's kicking up the sand
It's blowing out a message
To every woman, child and man
Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing
Cross the land and cross the sea
It's blowing peace and freedom
It's blowing equality
From a lighthouse in Bar Harbor
To a bridge called Golden Gate
From a trawler down in Shreveport
To the shore of one Great Lake
There's a star on the horizon
And it's burning like a flare
It's lighting up this mighty wind
That's blowing everywhere
Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing
It's kicking up the sand
It's blowing out a message
To every woman, child and man
Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing
Cross the land and cross the sea
It's blowing peace and freedom
It's blowing equality
When the blind man sees the picture
When the deaf man hears the word
When the fisherman stops fishing
When the hunter spares the herd
We'll still hear the wondrous story
Of a world where people care
The story of this mighty wind
That's blowing everywhere
Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing
It's kicking up the sand
It's blowing out a message
To every woman, child and man
Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing
Cross the land and cross the sea
It's blowing peace and freedom
It's blowing equality
Yes, it's blowing peace and freedom
It's blowing you and me
So the morning after the big show at Town Hall...
...the TV network executives were crawling out of the woodwork...
...trying to get The New Main Street Singers into a TV series.
We took some very nice meetings.
I ran over my ideas.
They loved my idea where the kids played babies.
You know, in diapers. And...
...it always makes me laugh to see babies talk like adults.
The network execs said, "Look, we're not sitting in judgment of your ideas.
We love the kids, we wanna put them on a series."
And the word "judgment," a light went on over my head!
I always thought there were
12 Supreme Court judges...
...but now it seems there are only nine.
I don't know if it's a budget thing or not.
But there's also nine
New Main Street Singers.
And I thought, "What if they were the Supreme Court judges?"
And it was my idea to call them "The
Supreme Folk." Tying in the folk singing.
And here's the idea. During the day...
...they're handling some of the top, most difficult cases in the land.
There's a lot of tension there. And at night, and this is what sold the networks...
...they live in one big house and they take off their robes and sing folk songs.
Now, maybe during the day they hear death penalty cases, and at night...
...they argue about who cooks dinner or who does...
...the laundry or, "Say, why don't the ladies bring the coffee?"
"And that's sexual harassment!
That was decided in case 126,
Johnson vs... "
Oh, I like that.
The women, sexual discrimination.
I'm not doing much writing, but the ideas keep popping.
Won't make your patients cringe
Sure-Flo, Sure-Flo
Don't leave them cold and damp
Use our buttocks drapes and penis clamp
I'm a musician again.
Being on-stage again with Mitch was a great thing.
Oh, boy. I never thought it was possible.
And there we were.
Just wish he didn't take things so seriously.
You know. That damn kiss.
My sister-- Well, they were all at the show, but my sister Jocelyn said:
"You led him on. You shouldn't have kissed him if you didn't wanna go all the way."
It was just a kiss. And it's part of--
The audience was there waiting for it.
And I forgot what that feels like...
...where you get caught up in the heat of the moment...
...and you want to give them...
...anything they want.
I think Mitch...
I didn't lead him on. But he...
...took it the wrong way, I think.
I've never been in better head space.
I'm writing poetry again.
I'm going through a very prolific phase.
Ideas are coming faster than I can write them.
My one fear in getting together with Mickey was...
...always that it might rekindle...
...feelings that she used to have for me.
I feel badly that she was misled...
...by the theatrics of the moment.
But I think it was a wonderful time that we both had together.
I know that I will always think of her fondly...
...every time I see a rose.
We've got some gigs here working at the casinos.
It has been a time of changes, but change is good. Change is life.
It was like a great big door opening for me, Town Hall.
After that concert I realized...
...I wanna spend as much of the rest of my life as possible...
-...playing folk music with these gentlemen.
-Right back at you.
And I wanna spend all of it as a woman.
I came to a realization that I was, and am...
...a blond, female folk singer...
...trapped in the body of a bald, male folk singer...
...and I had to let me out or I would die.
When you put it that way, it's almost poetry.
Almost.
Now they don't allow no frowns inside
Leave them by the door
-There's apple brandy by the keg
-And sawdust on the floor
So if you've got a hankering
I'll tell you where to go
Just look for the busted neon sign
That flashes
Ea-a-oe's
That was unreal.
Yeah, it was nice.
Nice? But you were calling out my name.
You were banging my head into the headboard and singing. It hurt.
- Why didn't you say something?
- I just wanted you to finish.
Oh, this isn't right!
Well, did you at least... you know...?
No, Freddy, I didn't come.
Look, don't worry about it, OK?
- Oh, for Christ's sake!
- Pay attention! You might learn something.
I hated music at first. Seriously.
No! I don't want to!
But my parents were determined.
I mean, they really tried, man.
No, no, no, stop! How many times...?
After the banjo, the trumpet, the piccolo and the accordion, guess what came next.
Go on, guess.
Summer of '85.
First time I'd been in a record shop.
I was with my date. OK, baby-sitter.
That was the moment the lights just blazed on.
That was the day I knew
I was destined to be a rock star.
Unfortunately, I was a generation late.
By the time I was ready, live music in Sydney was flatlining.
Bands were getting elbowed out of pubs and clubs by pretty-boy DJs and the worst plague to hit Australia since the cane toad:
Pokies.
Why people sat there fitting their week's wages down a slot was anyone's guess.
Profits ruled.
Live music just couldn't compete.
It was now up to the labels to make sure we had cutting-edge artistes to choose from.
I've been waiting for this.
Her last album was great.
Have you heard "Scent of my Love"?
I love that song.
I had a band. We rocked hard.
Well, we would've.
After a year of rehearsing, all we needed was a gig, but that was proving pretty tough.
Then one day, just like on an MTV special...
- Shaw's Records.
- Freddy, it's Bruno.
Bruno, how are you?
- Gig? Yeah, right, mate. It's not my birthday.
- No bullshit. It's for real.
- You serious?
- Yeah.
Yeah! Bruno, you rock!
The guys are gonna be stoked!
One phone call. One gig.
It can change your whole life. Destiny, man.
Oi! You!
- We should open with that song, definitely.
- No, it's a better closer.
Hook 'em with the ballad, then jerk off with the arty shit.
- It's not arty shit, Bruno.
- It's just an expression, you big...
Guys! Guys!
Take it easy.
We've finally got a gig, right?
Oh, Jesus, a gig. My hands are shaking.
Ah. Flop sweat.
A little something to soothe those nerves?
Mm, let me think.
And how do they rate next to rat poison?
I give them a 6.8 on the Luce-o-meter.
A nice, level high.
- Oh, really?
- Brunes, you did the gig guide, right?
Does the Queen wipe her own arse?
Everyone and their dog's gonna be there tomorrow night. Relax.
When I'm finished, you'll be headlining Homebake!
All right! Let's do it again. Count us in, Luce.
One, two, three, four!
- Not again!
- Fuck.
Bruno's onto it.
Oi! Grandpa! You do that one more time,
I'll plug in your walker, and a thousand volts will sizzle the scraggly white hairs on your balls!
- Dickhead.
- Good one, Brunes.
Are... you... ready?
- Dad.
- Yeah.
That was pretty bloody pathetic.
Are... you... ready?
- Yeah!
- Dad, please.
Suck more piss! All right!
First gig! I remember our first gig with the Boomawangs, back in seventy...
- Six.
- '76. The singer got hit with a beer bottle.
A chunk of glass went right in his eyeball.
And he kept...
- Kept on singing.
- Kate!
- Katie!
- Got my eye on you, baby!
- Isn't that how you got the pirate thing?
- Yeah, yeah. Career-maker that bastard was.
- Found this in the second-hand bin.
- KISS and Make Up.
- Gee, thanks, Kate.
- So, are you guys psyched or what?
Yeah!
Oh, my God!
Aren't you, like, with that band?
You must have me confused with someone else.
- Bruno! You pig. That's heavy. I wouldn't.
- Yeah?
I could bench-press your arse no strain, drummer boy.
Hey, that killer opener you're having trouble with? I've some ideas for the lyric.
Who's a pig now, eh?
Oh, Brunes!
Wait, wait. Don't say anything yet.
Anything to say to people watching at home?
I am Luscious Lucy.
Let the snare bite and the high-hat hiss, for I am the best drummer in the world!
- You're not, Luce.
- So Tan, how we feelin'?
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- All right. All right.
- Freddy.
- Yo.
- How are those vocal chords, man?
- Strong, smooth and ready to rumble!
- So, you're feelin' pretty good then?
- Yeah.
It's what it's all about, man.
We're gonna remember this night for ever.
All right. We're gonna take a break, so nobody leave.
Tan, you're pushin' too hard.
You're anticipating the crash.
What I'm anticipating is my bass wrapped round your head.
What?
As manager of a band who are supposed to play tonight, I'm entitled to free drinks!
Mate, your band's name ain't on my list.
In-A-Pinch Management?
Freddy, where the hell are you?
I'm at the Duke of York.
Where the hell do you think I am?
The Duke of Clarence? I'm fucking positive it was the Duke of York.
- It was the Clarence, you fucking idiot!
- I'm goin' into a tunnel.
Hey, Brune. When do we start?
- That idiot is sacked.
- We were just managed up shit creek.
- Let's go to a real pub, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Coming, aren't you?
- I'm not really up for it.
Joe! Jesus, one drink.
You haven't talked to me all night.
I'll catch you later, OK?
Four schooners, thanks, Thommo.
- Freddy. How's life?
- Don't ask.
Actually, I'll tell you how life is, Thommo.
Pretty shitty, mate.
Here we are, musicians with somethin' to say and no place to say it.
"Why?", you ask.
Because certain publicans I know are employing pricks like him instead of real musicians like us.
- All just to save a quick buck.
- You make me feel like such an enemy of art.
Yeah. Well, when you're ready to book a real band, let me know.
- Man, we could rock the tits off this place.
- Sure thing.
Next slot that opens up, you'll be the fourth or fifth out-of-work band I call. Promise.
Hang in there with your music, champ.
Before a feast, there must be famine.
Mate, your wallet!
Feast!
It's such a sexual game. Balls, stick...
Choice of holes.
You lubricate...
Then choose your position.
- Were you breast-fed?
- Oh, yeah.
Cos studies link sexual obsession and the lack of mummy's tit.
Too soft, humiliation. Too hard...
Well. You can never be too hard.
- Beer?
- Certainly.
What did you think? Honestly.
I thought it was going really well till the guy turned the greyhound races up.
At least his dog lost.
I don't know, Katie.
It's all I've ever wanted, you know?
Just to be up on stage and have everyone loving my music as much as I do.
- Maybe it's just a stupid dream.
- Yeah, I guess.
What?
- It's only stupid if you give it up.
- Yeah, well, I won't be doin' that in a hurry.
You don't think
Joe's got someone else, do you?
He'd have to be insane.
- You know what he's like.
- Yeah, I suppose.
- C'mon, Tan, let's jam.
- No, not till I beat this depraved bastard.
Catch you later.
See you.
Joe, you fill me so perfectly.
It's like someone's poured plaster inside me, pulled it out, and stuck that exact mould right on your balls.
You smell great, Angie.
I like it here. So dark.
So still, Joe.
Joe?
You ever think about suicide?
Oh, Angie...
- Then my parents walk in.
- What did you do?
Handed the joint to Kev and told them it was his idea.
That's when we started rehearsing in the penthouse.
- Thanks for the lift.
- No worries.
Hold on a sec.
It does that.
- So, you mentioned some lyrics?
- Yeah.
I don't know if they're what you're looking for, it's just a few ideas I had over coffee.
Wow, this is unreal!
Wait, what's that word? "People"?
- "Pimple."
- Pimple! That's even better!
- Katie, this is poetry, man.
- You think so?
Yeah!
- Fucking Kate!
- What?
I said "Fucking great!"
- Maybe they forgot to mention it.
- I heard it on the radio myself. The gig guide.
They gave our number and said we need a manager.
- Face it, mate, no one wants to manage us.
- It was only an hour ago. Take it easy.
Hello?
Yes, we are still looking for a manager, actually.
- Yeah, we could hang around. Are you far?
- No. Pretty friggin' close.
Bruno, listen...
I'm mindin' my own biz on the crapper, givin' birth to a Bruno-loaf, when I hear this bullshit on the radio.
- My arsehole snaps shut like a mousetrap.
- You messed up the gig.
One little mistake. Fuck you very much.
You've never made a mistake, you little fairy?
Guys. No.
Give me another chance.
Just one more chance!
No.
I... I'm the manager.
Don't crush my dreams.
I'd rather be dead!
- Do something, Freddy.
- What? I don't have a gun.
C'mon, Freddy. Do somethin'.
What? Make him our roadie?
Roadie?
Joe, we've been mates since the Squid days.
You know I'd never tread on your turf.
It's just, you and Katie. I mean...
Things just don't seem to be goin' that well, and I just figured that if... you know, if I...
...the Australian Rock Awards, Sprimp's debut album shot to platinum in four weeks flat, under the guidance of Manager of the Year, Shad Kern.
However, the band had...
Holy shit!
- Kern Management, please hold. Yes?
- I'm here to see Shad Kern.
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, but I have his wallet.
No way! No fucking way does Sprimp do support for anybody.
- I don't care if they're rock icons.
- Icons!
We've got five sold-out entertainment centres.
If we wanna do the stadium, we'll do it ourselves.
- Fuck them!
- Hey, fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em!
Shad! How you goin'?
- Who is this?
- It's Freddy.
We met the other night at the Palace Hotel.
- Right. The DJ-hater.
- Yeah!
- Hey, you left this. Dig your work, man.
- Cheers, brother.
Thanks. I don't know what I was thinking.
Oh, I do. You should've seen the bird he was with, man.
- Amazing. Don't say anything.
- Hiya, baby. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Hey, babe.
- Rehearsals just went on and on and on.
- Don't worry, kid. It'll pay off. I know it.
- Incredible. Is that really the time?
Toby. Toby! Don't you have a sound check?
Yeah, man - in four hours.
The traffic's been atrocious.
You'd better get down there. Huh?
OK, then.
I don't know what I'd do without you, man.
They're only after us, you see...
- See you later.
- Bye, Shad.
You. With me.
We've been rehearsing for about a year and we've got a killer sound.
It's just so edge-of-your-seat, you know, "Give me more, you bastards."
Yeah, yeah. Listen. About the redhead?
Thanks.
You know the best thing about this industry?
Well, people call it an industry, but I prefer the term "playpen."
The best thing about this playpen is the drugs and the women.
And the worst thing about this playpen...
Is the drugs and the women.
Exactly!
Here. Backstage passes to the Sprimp concert tomorrow.
Yeah.
You're fucking joking. Pay off the ambulance driver and call his sister. I'll be there in 20.
- Well, Freddy, nice chat.
- Yeah.
Look, I really gotta go, so, you know...
- And... remember...
- Before feast there must be famine, right?
Yeah. See you, Freddy.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- You OK? Your work said you were sick.
- I've been better.
- Get this.
- Actually...
I just hung out with Shad Kern.
Sprimp's manager?
Nothing's definite, but I've just finally got an in.
- Great.
- But I wanna talk about us.
You and me the other night, that was real.
You can't walk away from that.
You and Joe haven't been right.
It's the same with me and Tanya.
It'd be difficult, Joe and I being best mates, but I think Joe'd be all right...
Freddy, listen to me. Things have changed.
- What?
- There's been a complication.
All right. What kind of complication?
There's someone else.
In 24 hours?
I'm going to tell Joe.
Wait! I'll give you a lift!
Look at my hands. They're chick hands.
Then one day tomorrow comes and you die.
Everybody dies. It's... natural.
People die all the time.
You wanna be an old, decrepit shitbag, a wrinkly little fetus-man?
For what, Joe?
To play one more song nobody'll listen to?
With your... chick hands.
What am I supposed to do with these hands?
Angie.
Hey. Hey!
Wow.
- You have to try this.
- What?
You just pinch you main arteries like this, and hyperventilate until you pass out.
Kate. If you need anything, like, you know, Chinese takeaway or someone to hold your hand, then give me a call, yeah?
Shit. It's Kate.
You'd better make yourself scarce.
And who's Shad Kern?
Just the fucking Rock Manager of the Year!
Stool of Satan, Gutter Midgets, Lovestain.
- And the biggest fuckin' band in the country.
- Sprimp?
- Ah, Sprimp!
- Yeah, Sprimp!
I've been invited backstage after the concert to hang out with Shad and the band!
Where's Joe?
He's gonna flip when he hears this!
- Didn't see that coming.
- Joe, get off me! What are you doing?!
You piece of dog shit!
You're ramming her, aren't you? Kate!
- Who's ramming Kate?
- You're nuts!
No, your nuts, slapping her arse while you bang her! It's your kid, isn't it?
- No, it isn't.
- Why else would she tell you first?
- Kate's pregnant? What's going on?
- This is making my head hurt!
- How long have you been fucking her?
- I didn't fuck her! We just kissed, once.
- Shoulda put a condom on your tongue.
- Lowlife!
- Aren't you still with Tanya?
- Shut up, Bruno!
Everybody shut up! Katie's pregnant with your kid, man - that's it!
- But you're with Tanya?
- Yes.
- Not any more.
- Wait, Tan!
Tanya!
- We never had sex.
- Funny, you could say that about us.
Tanya, nothing happened.
You know, nothing. Nada. Nyet.
So you're saying you feel nothing for her, is that it?
Nyet? I didn't think so.
- Tanya, listen.
- It's OK.
I don't love you, Freddy.
Come on, we're just friends anyway.
Look, it's time to move on.
New girlfriend. New bass player.
- What the fuck is in me?!
- My Quick Unpick. I was looking for that.
Quick Unpick? What the fuck is that?
- A hook you use to unpick stitching.
- Why leave that lyin' around?
- Looks like it's in good and tight.
- Can you pull it out?
Good advice. You should've followed it.
- Tanya, please.
- OK! Jesus Christ!
Try not to cry, all right? Bend over!
And to think, this is how I'll always remember you.
- Freddy, I'm glad you're here.
- Ex-girlfriend coming through.
Tanya... Listen, there's nothing going on.
I told him I hadn't even kissed another guy, and then I remembered you, and itjust kind of slipped out.
Then he said he always thought we were screwing around, so I said "Well, you can think what you like."
- I feel awful about you and Tanya.
- That's all right.
She was always a bit of a pain in the arse.
So, are you OK?
Yeah. No, I... I don't know.
Everything's just all over the place.
Things'll get better.
You wanna come to a Sprimp concert?
Thanks for inviting me, Freddy.
Man, I love being backstage at these things.
Sprimp are hot!
You managed us for a year and I never asked what music you like.
Oh, I like all kinds of music.
OK. But this could be our last chance to keep the band together, so don't screw it up.
There he is.
Yeah. Some notes. For your pitch.
Has this had any contact with your rectum?
St Peter says "That's the bad news.
Karen Carpenter's on drums!"
Shad.
Guys, this is Teddy. Says he's got a killer band, ain't that right, Teddy?
Freddy. I dig your work, guys.
What's a killer band got to do to get you to manage 'em?
Well, you've got to have a shit-hot demo with a new sound.
- That's how Toby here got my attention.
- No, forget that.
Make sure this bastard comes to your next gig, huh?
And don't take no for an answer.
It's rock and roll, dude.
Knock 'em dead, guys.
How you doin'?
So, seriously, what does a guy...
What does a guy with a killer band have to do to get Shad Kern to manage them?
They've got a sound. A unique fucking sound.
- I can guarantee it.
- What the fuck is this?
- Just Bruno, our roadie.
- Co-manager.
- Enjoy the gig.
- What are you doing?
Ladies and gentlemen, Sprimp!
Shad, wait. I could've sold you out with that redhead, but I didn't.
Your thanks is to fob me off with backstage passes to this show?
On the street, these guys are a fuckin' joke.
All I wanted was for you to hear us play.
Anyway, it's your loss, man.
Call my office, tell me where you're playing, and I'll be there.
You won't be disappointed, Shad! Mr Kern!
The wait. My favourite part.
Will she come on like a tiger in slow motion, or fast and rude like a raging hand grenade of bliss?
Prepare to surrender.
Prepare to lose all control.
Come on, baby, give it to me.
Give me a ten, an arse-kicking, perfect high.
Tighten, release. Breathe in, breathe out.
This is the one. It's gonna be the one.
Go, ten. Come on, baby, go!
Oh, shit!
Sorry, man. Thought you were Satan.
Mate, take my advice. Talk to her.
Remember, chicks say "I hate your guts," and they mean "Buy me a dozen roses."
"I never wanna see your face again" means
"If you make me laugh, I might blow you."
You get my drift?
Do you love her?
Then go out there and get her back.
- You're right. Fuck it! You're right.
- Now you're talking!
And here.
It'll help take the edge off.
Bugger off!
"You and me and baby makes three, love, Papa"?!
- We agreed...
- I've agreed to stick with the band on a strictly professional basis.
- What about Joe?
- Screw him for not turning up today.
- Whoa, mate, he's just pissed off.
- You did pork his old lady.
I didn't pork his old lady!
Look, if you can get Shad Kern to manage us, even I'd pork ya.
Look, can we just get this wet dream right?
So this Kern guy, he wants to sign us?
He wants to hear us play. Whatever, he's on the hook. All we need is a gig.
Great. It's "magical mystery gig that'll never happen" time again.
- Thommo's gonna rent us this place.
- Brilliant.
And that parsimonious prick is doing this to win the Nobel Prize for Humanity?
Yeah. And 1200 bucks.
That's all we've gotta guarantee him. We keep the door and get drinks at staff prices.
- Cool.
- But where are we gonna get 1200 bucks?
- Can't you sell some of your pills?
- No way. That makes me a pusher, amigo.
- Tan, what about your parents?
- No.
- God. Next stupid idea?
- I've got one.
There's no point even talking about it unless we know that Joe's in.
- Bust up? Go back with that slut?
- Kate is not a slut.
That's why she's got her tongue down the throat of your best friend.
- Angie, don't.
- Let's ask Little Joe what he thinks.
Stop it.
- Oh, g'day, big fella. Joe's upstairs.
- Thanks, Kev. How you keepin', man?
Tops, matey.
I'd forgotten how good cornflakes were.
This is... It's not normal, Angie.
- Fuck normal. Who wants normal?
- I do.
And Kate's normal. Having a baby is normal.
I need lots of... normal.
Do you always ejaculate over a girl when you're trying to break up with her?
It's original, I'll give you that.
Are you crazy?
Put some antiseptic on it. Jesus.
Think you can get rid of me?
You'll never get rid of me, Joe. Ever.
Look, you are a mind-blowing fuck, but we have to cool it, OK?
What do you want? What?
You idiot. Katie's pregnant and you're cheating on her.
No, I'm not.
Look, not now.
I was just breaking up with her, all right?
I came to tell you
Sprimp's manager wants to see a gig.
You gotta come up with 240 bucks, fast.
- You don't deserve her, man.
- Oh, and you do?
Oh, Freddy? Try and use this against me with
Kate and you can forget the fucking band.
I mean it.
I can't guarantee they'll be 100% smooth, but your donations will really help my research.
I'm a seven-foot-tall blonde Amazon goddess with violet eyes and breasts so big they meet behind my back.
No, mate.
Sod off!
I can't guarantee they'll be 100% smooth...
Fuck you too, you degenerate floating cake of whale shit! Jesus!
You sexy degenerate, you.
Here you go.
That's not an official Wilderness Society suit!
You're a fake!
- You're the fake.
- You're dead!
Fuck you, man!
And don't come back!
This time Joe's gone too far.
He's deluded himself before, but not like this.
Why does he always say things he doesn't really mean?
I mean, could he think about my feelings forjust a minute?
It's like at a party when there's one piece of cheese left on the plate.
The person next to you obviously wants it, but makes a point of offering it to you first.
Stuff like that really shits me.
I love it when it rains.
For a moment, everything's new again.
...ready to rumble!
- You're feelin' pretty good then?
- Yeah. It's what it's all about, man.
We'll remember this night for ever.
Dumplings?
- It's great. Things are going so well for you.
- Yeah, well, we've only raised 100 bucks.
You'll get there.
I was just worried you and Joe were gonna bust up the band over all this.
So, have you finished that song we wrote?
The killer opener?
- I'm still working on it.
- Think it'll turn out OK?
I hope so.
Some days, don't you wish you could just escape?
Joe and I are over.
- How did he take it?
- He doesn't know yet.
It's the right thing for both of us.
He just hasn't been around for me to tell him.
- Sorry, you were saying?
- No. It's nothing.
Nothing. Hey, you want the last one?
- No, no, you...
- Yeah, you do.
You reckon anybody likes fortune cookies?
Joe.
- Where've you been?
- The family planning centre.
They suggested that the father-to-be...
- Father-to-be?
- Yeah. That he watch something for 24 hours.
- Teaches responsibility.
- What are you talking about?
Meet Melly. Most blokes only look after it for a day, I'm gonna do it for a whole month.
- Joe...
- Just watch me.
I'll get my shit together, you'll see.
I will not let her out of my sight, ever.
Joe, what you're doing is great.
But you and me, the way that it's been...
I've changed. You'll see.
It's not gonna work. It's over.
Freddy's not the guy for you, Kate.
I know he's not.
- Please, Joe, don't do this.
- Just give me a chance, OK?
I can be normal. Watch me.
It's nap time.
So we'll see you later.
Everything's gonna be fine. I guarantee it.
You were right, Freddy.
They didn't even check the date.
Brunes. Brunes! Focus.
The idea is to get Shad to come to rehearsal, save a thousand bucks, yeah?
He'll be on the side of the stage. Wait here.
- What if I see him first?
- Find me.
- What if there's no time?
- Find me.
No cheating. Shadling!
- You said you'd listen to the whole demo.
- Baby.
You know I think you've got a great sound.
- Then manage me.
- I'll manage you...
...if you leave Toby.
That's so romantic.
But you know that's not an option.
We don't wanna rock the boat, do we?
I think you should listen to track two.
Oh, hey. Shad.
- It's Bruno. In-A-Pinch Management?
- Oh, yeah...
Shad, look, I know you said you'd come to our next gig and all, but we thought maybe you'd like to come to a rehearsal instead, you know?
- Get ajump on the whole...
- C'mon, baby, don't play with me now.
You really do have to hear them live...
- Shad, is this a good time for you?
- No!
Don't you dare tease me!
Yeah! The demo rocks!
- What do you mean... Oh! Ah! A demo?
- Fuck, yes!
- The truth is, we can't afford to do a demo...
- I love the demo! Oh, give it to me.
- You're saying you'd give it a serious listen?
- Now you've got it! Oh, here we go!
I get it! We're just going to have to get you one then! You won't be sorry, Shad.
I'll be in touch, all right?
I'll get the contracts drawn up tomorrow.
They caught you in the make-up room, so they checked the pass.
What's it matter?
Now we know what Shad wants - a demo.
Great. Now instead of finding a grand, we've gotta find three!
You are not gonna believe what Joe's gone and done.
- So you know?
- You've met his little friend?
- Yeah. Katie, I'm so sorry.
- You are?
Course. Couldn't believe he screwed around on you.
I tried to tell you, but a plane flew over, and you said it was over anyway, so I figured the band was going really well, and Shad wanted to...
You didn't know?
I came to talk to you about Joe buying a melon as a baby substitute, but you're telling me that all this time he's been having an affair, and you didn't tell me about it for the sake of your worthless fucking band?
- Yeah, but...
- How selfish can you get?
To think I actually thought that you and I...
But that was all bullshit.
No, that was real!
I understand how you feel...
Freddy, you have no idea.
I trusted you.
How do you open this fucking door?
Just pull it.
Breaking up's the best thing that ever happened to me.
Free to roam, free to rage, free to have a freakin' orgasm occasionally...
What's wrong with guys today?
They couldn't find their way around a supermarket, let alone a woman's body.
Oh, my God.
Feeding time on the Planet of the Apes.
Oh, shit, Tan. If only it wasn't so tragically hip to be bi these days.
To subjugate is to make subservient or submissive.
- False.
- Incorrect.
Precognition is the ability to see into the future.
What, like me and you going out on a date or something?
Dream on, dickhead.
- Hello?
- Katie, it's me...
Oh, what?!
- Aha! A hole in one, right there.
- One-night stands seem weird to me.
Sex with a stranger is the thrill of the unexpected.
One minute you're sitting in a pub, the next, you're buck naked with a tongue rooting around your bunghole.
Maybe I don't feel like planting my heels on the ceiling and yelling "Come and get it!"
Sexual frustration can be frustrating.
- Have you seen what's going on?
- No.
Thommo? What's the story?
What story would that be, Freddo?
Ah. Well, laddie, once upon a time there was a barman named Thommo, who got sick of selling alcoholic refreshment to losers and half-wits in a shit part of town.
So he sold half his equity to the evil development man, who turned around and filled his joint with pokies.
And then Thommo lived happily ever after, sailing around the world on his gigantic fuckin' yacht.
What's more important, Thommo?
Us? We've supported you for years.
Or pimpin' out your pub for a quick buck?
- What about the bands, man?
- What about 'em?
I now officially consider you the enemy.
Come on, guys, let's get outta here.
I'll send you a postcard, you dick.
God, a demo? They're so expensive!
Shad was practically begging me for it.
- Jeez, Tan, we can't pass this up.
- Yeah. Come on.
No! The answer's no.
Come on. You know how tight they are.
Look, any money given comes with serious psychological strings attached.
All right! But we do it my way or we don't do it at all.
And you all have to be there. Even Joe.
Told you she'd crack.
Just have to put the pressure on.
- Kate? Nah, nah. Cornflakes?
- No, I'm good.
Nah, the only time Kate came round was to drop off a garbage bag full of Joe's stuff.
She didn't wanna talk to him.
- All right. Thanks, Kev.
- Freddy...
- He really screwed it up good, didn't he?
- Yeah. We both did.
Well, we're musos. We're meant to screw up when it comes to women.
I'll see you around, Kev.
Hey.
Giant Squid was pretty cool, hey?
- Remember that gig we played...
- You're being rude.
- What?
- You didn't say hello.
- Yeah, I did. I just said...
- To Melly.
Hey, Melly.
- Anyway, remember the gig...
- Don't try to memory-lane me.
- We could use that feeling.
- Old news, mate.
We're better now. You and I are stronger than this bullshit, aren't we?
Yeah, and what about you and Kate?
For some reason,
I didn't think you'd mind.
She's my girl.
I know. Itjust didn't seem like it.
Anyway, whatever, man.
Look, I'm here about the band.
This is our chance. I'm telling you,
I'm gonna make this thing happen.
And if you want to come along for the ride, then... well, that'd be really cool.
It's up to you.
- Great. Joe's lost it.
- It's a difficult time.
And for me.
You don't see me breast-feeding mangoes.
- Melons.
- Whatever! Is the table set?
- Maybe I should put on some music.
- No, it'll just make them tense.
Oh, guys, I'm sorry I'm late, but Melly was a little bit grumpy on the way over.
Joe, please, no melons! Just for tonight.
- Shouldn't little Mellys be in bed by now?
- Relax!
Here' s to bleeding your parents dry.
I envy you musicians.
No cares, no money worries.
No money!
Yeah. A rich guy like you must be so stressed out you can't even take a dump without an accountant present.
Yeah! Yeah.
- Freddy, could you give me a hand, please?
- Sure.
Excuse me.
This is all wrong. There's no way
I can ask them for money tonight.
C'mon, chill, Tan. You can do it.
Ease us through.
We'll murder Lucy later.
- Goin' pretty well out there, eh?
- I feel kind of weird, man.
An early phase that passes.
- What?
- Nothin'.
All right, I slipped something in the shots. You guys needed to relax.
- Dude, I'm hallucinating!
- Impossible.
Be cool. Trust me, it's very mild. Look at me.
I'm as solid as a rock.
I'm so glad you came over, because I wanted to say thank you for everything you've done.
But there's also something that I wanted to ask you. Um...
Tan! Your head!
- Is your friend all right, Tanya?
- He does that.
Anyway, what I wanted to mention was that we've got an opportunity to cut a demo...
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
What kind of a demo?
You know, like a sampler of our music...
We've got to be clear that uni comes first - that's a career.
The band comes second - that's a hobby.
You've got to prioritise.
- What the fuck is happening?
- Tanya, listen carefully.
This is liquid ecstasy.
It produces a subtle feeling of well-being.
This is some hardcore LSD
I forgot I had in my kit.
I'm gonna rip open your skull and piss in the cavity where your brain should be!
Tan! Don't move!
- My parents, you dickhead!
- They're clean. So's Joe.
Hello, boys and girls! Guess who!
Oh, this shit is kind of robust.
That's right. We're gonna dance all night, dance all day.
Fire extinguisher!
Someone call the fire brigade!
In here, Freddy!
Freddy, I trusted you.
You can't have my soul! Die, fucker, die!
Tanya? Sweetie? Are you OK?
Don't come in here!
There's been a bit of a problem.
- Tanya, what's going on?
- We think the macadamia nuts are off.
- Tanya, darling, should we call a doctor?
- No, no doctors.
We just need to have a vomit and a lie-down.
I'll just give you a call in the morning.
It's OK, Tan. Joe's still out there.
Excuse me. Do you have any idea what's going on here, son?
Aw! My melon's got a pooey nappy.
20 years ago, a groupie would've washed my undergruns for free.
Just to sniff 'em.
Ah, the memories. Now I hang around here for hours every laundry day, praying that the blonde with the double serving of funbags will show up so I can watch her unmentionables flip-flop around in the fuckin' dryer.
What kind of a dad am I?
She's just rotting away back here.
You can sell her.
Use the cash to make that demo.
- You've got to be kidding.
- No. Come on, take it.
- Not for this demo. It's not worth it.
- Come on, son. Let me give you somethin'.
She's just rotting away back here.
You can sell her.
Use the cash to make your demo.
- Hang on, Kevin, you can't...
- I know, I know. We've had some good times.
Great times.
But, you know, they're all up here.
Nothin' sadder than an old rocker that doesn't know when to quit.
Unless you're the Stones, of course.
You know what I mean?
Tan, hey. It's not Freddy's idea.
This is somethin' I wanna do.
- I didn't make him do it.
- We didn't make him.
- Are you speaking for him now?
- I was just saying it wasn't my idea...
You don't get it, do you? This is your time.
Right now. You've got to grab it.
You've gotta grab it...
With both hands...
And don't let go-ooh!
Don't let go-oh!
Oh, man. I know someone who'd kill his own mother to get his hands on one of these.
Good, Luce. Let him know it's for sale.
Kev, you rock.
Kate.
God, don't do that.
How's the baby? Did you get an ultrasound?
Listen close, Joe.
Ultrasound, no. Abortion, yes.
Yes, please, after what you've done.
How was I so blind?
Wait. An abortion?
Jesus, don't look at me like that.
I haven't done it yet.
- You'd be murdering our kid!
- Joe, you're scaring me.
Just stop following me and leave me alone.
Fuck, that was hot!
- So, let's do that Cuban thing now.
- No, the speed metal track.
- No, no, why don't you do the ballad?
- No, the Cuban thing shows we have range.
- No, we're doin' the new one.
- The killer opener?
- You have a fall? We've barely rehearsed it.
- We're doin' it.
- We've got time for one more?
- Sure. Over the top, dudes!
- Rip that metal, man!
- All right. Luce, count it in.
One, two, three, four!
Yeah, so you split your mortgage between fixed and variable and you refinance when the interest drops.
More attitude, guys. Stronger.
Scarlet, about that studio.
Scarlet. About that studio I wanted you to see. I've organised it for later.
Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention.
Toby and I are going to the Channel X party.
- You could come with us.
- Yeah, man, you should come.
- Yeah?
- Shad, it's Freddy.
"Feast and famine" Freddy?
I've got the demo we talked about.
Did we?
I guess we did. Why don't you drop it into my office and I'll listen to it ASAP.
Fuck it, can you get it to me personally?
I may be looking for some real talent.
- OK.
- I'll meet you where I left my wallet.
The Palace? OK, ten o'clock.
I'll see you there, Shad!
Yeah!
With me and Freddy pimpin' the band, you'll be the talk of the town!
No, fuck it. The world!
- Come on, then.
- Kick arse!
- Brunes, I want to talk to you about that.
- What about?
I thought when I give the demo to Shad, I'd do it on my own.
- Just you and me, right?
- No, just me.
You know, I wanna schmooze him a bit, one on one. You understand that, right?
Yeah. Sure.
Fuck!
I hope you don't mind. I let myself in.
- What are you doin'?
- You should give this a go.
Red dye number two.
What's wrong, sugar?
It's Kate. She's killing the baby.
Oh. Poor sweetie.
Hug, hm?
- That's what I said!
- Now you're talking!
Let's celebrate. They're a 7.5.
You love to piss me off.
It's not my idea of a good time.
Try one. Might stop you rushing ahead of the beat.
- I'm on the beat. You're the one who lags.
- If you can't move, you can't groove.
- You idiot. You say the most stupid things!
- Idiot? I do not!
- Compared to me...
- You show no respect for me at all!
- You are so fucking wrong!
- You're just a rich, untalented bitch!
Hey...
Look... Ow! OK...
No. Look, Tanya...
No, man.
Truce?
- I know I said I wouldn't talk about us, but...
- We agreed. Just a meal.
- I have to get this off my chest.
- Freddy...
Just relax, just let me finish.
The band's got a real shot with this, and I want you to be a part of it.
I fucked up once. I'm not gonna do it again.
Freddy, I understand why you did what you did.
The band was your dream long before I was in the picture.
- So?
- What happens when you do a world tour?
- Well, you can come.
- And what do we do with the baby?
I'm having it.
That's cool.
- Not a problem.
- Actually, it is a problem.
You've gotta see this thing with the band through.
- And what about that night?
- It was... a beautiful kiss.
You're gonna meet lots of gorgeous women on the road with much less baggage than me.
- You said nothin' was goin' on!
- Stop it!
- Nothing is going on!
- Stop it!
I should just go now. Goodbye, Freddy.
Kate, wait.
Joe, wait!
Melly!
Dada!
Melly! What the fuck have you done, man?
Fuck! Fuck you!
Fuck you, too!
Fuckin' Freddy.
Ungrateful little gutter mongrel.
I work my balls down to a stump for him and the band, and when the big moment comes, he express-posts me a "Fuck you" and steals all the glory for himself.
No loyalty, that's his problem.
Mm. Some Indian would be great.
Yeah! Some vindaloo would really hit the spot.
That's my pole she's twirlin' on. Yeah.
- Yeah?
- I need you to get to the Palace.
Yeah? Well, guess what? Roadie hours are over for the day, so you can just fuck off!
Stop dickin' around. It's important. I'll be there with the demo, but I've gotta find Joe.
- I need you to stop Shad from leaving.
- Bruno's onto it!
- It's OK, sugar.
- Melly!
Hey. There's no need to be upset.
Shad. I mean, Mr Kern.
Bruno. In-A-Pinch Management?
- Where's Freddy?
- He's not far behind.
- Angie, I can't do this.
- Of course you can.
Oh, no.
Joe?
Joe!
Joe, what are you doin', man?
- Where's Angie?
- What are you talkin' about?
- Angie!
- Joe, there's no one here.
- Where... where is she?
- Just let me help you.
Don't tell anyone, OK?
Just don't tell anyone!
Shit! Freddy's coming!
Joe! Joe!
How'd it go with Shad?
You guys seen Joe? I'm really worried about him, man. He's acting really weird.
Joe? Joe?
- You checked the house?
- You're right, babe. Maybe he's in the house.
Babe?
- Has the whole fucking world gone insane?
- What's the problem, Freddy?
- We broke up.
- I don't give a shit about that.
Joe's really flipped out. I'm serious.
- Hello?
- Freddy, someone here wants to talk to you.
- Listen, you little fuckwit...
- Shad. I'm sorry...
There are rules, Freddy.
And one of them is, don't fuck with my time.
Get your arse here before I finish my drink or be prepared for a very long famine!
Fellas, can you give us a hand?
It's Joe. Won't answer his door.
Joey!
Oh, Jesus! Joey!
- Not you too!
- Kev, give us some room.
- Joey!
- Call an ambulance.
- What's he taken?
- That.
- Sleeping tablets. Sedatives.
- What do I do?
- We need an ambulance.
- Joey!
- He's got a pulse, mate. He's got a pulse.
- I don't know. He's taken them all.
I'm goin' with him.
Damn.
You saved his life, man.
Can we have some music in here to drown that shit out?!
Take a hike, loser.
Fuck!
You fuck! I'm gonna kill you!
After that, everything just turned to shit.
Joe, the band, my hopes for Katie...
The strange thing was,
I still had this need to play.
Music is a great thing to lose yourself in.
And, man, was I lost.
Give it up for the rockin' sounds of Alternate Current.
Oh, no, this is OK.
The pay's pretty good and... killer crowds...
I was sittin' right there.
I hear Joe's doin' better.
- Do you hear from the others much?
- No, it's over.
Kind of figure I should just lay low for a while, you know?
- Hey, Bon! You're the king!
- It's just an act, mate. Fuck off!
Oh, yeah? Fuck you, dickhead.
Now, look. The real reason I'm here,
I've got some great news.
- You got us a gig?
- Who told you?
- Are you serious?
- Does dog shit love shoes?
See? There you are. Right there.
When I saw it
I thought it was a printing error.
No error. You guys are booked to play at Homebake!
- This is our chance to really cook!
- I don't understand, man.
It was Destiny.
That's only her stage name, of course.
My friend Destiny, her brother, he books all the bands for Homebake.
It was under my nose all along!
She hooked me up just like that. Totally.
Bruno makes a promise, Bruno delivers.
Here you are, Joe.
Lucy always said
I'd find my perfect 10 sometime.
Bingo. Prozac.
- So, Homebake, eh?
- Yeah.
Kev said they're thinking of letting you out soon.
No. I don't think I'm ready for it.
You guys should still do it.
I won't be pissed off, man, I promise.
Hey, haven't you always said guitarists were as common as flies around a sheep's arse?
Been practising?
Kate brought it over.
I haven't picked it up yet. I'll get there.
- How's she going?
- Good.
She said technically I never really cheated on her. It was more of a mind fuck, really.
- Listen, I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, man.
- It's OK.
It was down to me, nobody else.
Things are a lot clearer now.
So, you thought of giving it another shot with Kate?
You've been having way too much of that Prozac, dude.
Hey. I just thought of a guitarist.
I can't, fellas. Shit, I'd love to, but...
I haven't been on stage in 15 years.
Oh, come on. You know all the songs.
- No, I can't.
- Luce.
Man, my baby!
I bought it back off the guy I sold it to.
The bastard drove a hard bargain though.
C'mon, Kev!
- Yeah, OK.
- Yeah!
Yeah, Kev!
- I'm really gonna miss you.
- Like I told Joe, my folks have heaps of room.
- So, any time you guys wanna visit...
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.
Shame you're gonna miss the gig.
Blame it on the movers.
It's funny, you know.
I really thought you two would make it.
It's for the best.
Joe's the dad. He won't be left out, I promise.
No, I... I was talking about Freddy.
But right now, he's really putting everything into this gig.
Yeah. It's everything he ever wanted.
He must be on a cloud.
...ready to rumble!
- So you're feelin' pretty good?
- Yeah, it's what it's all about, man!
We're gonna remember this night for ever.
- Kate, it's Freddy.
- This number has been disconnected.
Please check the number and call again.
- Are we ready?
- Yeah!
Thou, thee and this... Gonna be the hottest fucking gig ever, eh? Who's got the set list?
- Lucy!
- I ain't got it. Freddy's got it.
- I don't have it.
- Are you joking? You guys...
- I gave it to you five minutes ago.
- Don't you ever stop arguing?
Joe!
Think I'd miss my only chance to play at Homebake?
Welcome home, son!
OK, OK, come on. Schmaltzy crap later.
Let's get this show on the road!
- Ah, this is it, eh?
- So where's Kate? She meeting us there?
No. She's going to Melbourne with the movers at three.
- Movers?
- She's goin' to her parents'.
I thought you knew, man.
Are we ready?
All right! Let's do it!
Come on.
I'm not blind, Freddy,
Look, I've been scared before.
Fuck, I've been known to crap my pants, remember?
Don't let your fear get in the way, mate.
The nerves'll disappear as soon as you start that first song. Guarantee it.
Fuck it.
That's the spirit. A short cut.
OK, that everything, love?
Yeah.
Talk to me, Freddy.
This isn't a short cut, is it?
- No!
- Didn't think so.
Oh, no. No, not now, you piece of shit!
Shit!
Hang on a minute. This is Kate's place.
Stop! In the name of love!
- Let's go, mate!
- There it is!
- Come on, mate, speed up!
- Oh, no.
Will you pay Sunni's speeding fine?
I don't think so.
If Sunni doesn't friggin' step on it, I'll shove
Sunni's beaded seat cover up Sunni's arse!
No need for intimidation tactics.
You missed it!
Go to the side!
Oi! Kate!
- Katie!
- Look out!
- The other side.
- OK! On my way.
What the bloody hell do you think you're doin'?
- Aren't you meant to be on stage?
- This is exactly where I should be.
You'll never forgive yourself, and you'll never forgive me.
That night, when everything changed, when you said my dream was only stupid if I gave it up...
Well, I'm not giving you up. No way.
- Have you got room for me in Melbourne?
- Come on, you'll be late for your gig.
Record crowds are expected at Homebake.
Coming up on Triple J, we'll hear megaband Sprimp live from the festival.
Don't worry. When you start playing, they'll come running, you'll see.
- How could she?
- Yeah, well, she got what she wanted.
A nice juicy recording deal, a few added extras...
But running off with a sound engineer!
I'm a rock star!
Hey.
Come on.
Pour the pain into your music, man.
That's it, that's it.
Five minutes, guys.
There they are.
- Hey!
- Freddy.
- Hey.
- Thanks, Joe.
You ready to rock and roll?
- Excuse me. Who's in charge here?
- I am. Yeah. That's me, actually.
- Bumped?
- No!
- Of all the asinine, fucked-up things!
- Sorry, guys. We're runnin' late, and Sprimp's contract requires all other stages to be shut down when they're playing.
Nothin' I can do.
You were so close.
There's gotta be something we can do.
Quick, come with me.
Guys! Guys, wait up!
Guys, pick it up.
We're running behind.
Four quad boxes stage right.
I need two A/C thirties...
Excuse me. I'm writing this article on roadies, the unsung heroes of Australian rock.
Could I talk to you after the show?
This is it. Let's rock and roll.
Give the kids a go, fellas.
Hello.
Hello, Sydney.
Thank you for comin' out in support of live music, and say no to pokies!
My name's Freddy, and...
- Jim Morrison lives, man!
- Fascists! Let 'em play!
- You! How the fuck did you get in here?
- Freddy! Freddy! Freddy!
- Gimme a chance. Let me play one song.
- You had your chance. Get 'em outta here.
- You owe me!
- Wait right there. What did you say to me?
Toby could still find out you're bangin' his chick.
I owe you nothing. Scarlet chewed him up and spat him out, so it doesn't matter that
I was banging his girl the whole time.
I could've had an orgy with his cousin, sister, grandparents and Scarlet, and that moron still wouldn't have known.
Hey, guys. Dig your work.
Toby. Mate...
- Go, Freddy! Go!
- Freddy! Freddy! Freddy!
Consider yourself fired, wanker.
How you doin'?
This song's a bit of a new one for us.
Let 'em play. If they're any good, it'll give me an edge on the deal.
I hope you don't mind, but, uh, it's kind of a killer opener.
My big moment. The moment
I finally had to admit to myself that we just weren't very good.
But sucking as much as we did that day - and our suckage factor was enormous - we still got to play in front of a whole country full of people.
It was the most fun it was humanly possible for any of us to ever have.
About seven months later, Katie and I got married. Joe was best man.
Joe Junior made an appearance too.
Bruno won a million bucks in some contest by finding a purple Chocca. Lucky sod!
So he bought the Palace right out from under that butt-crumb Thommo.
We took the pokies and smashed them all with polo mallets.
Ladies and gentlemen, how we doin'?
Me and Joe manage Bruno's, and now the bands are back.
There's been a bit of a scheduling mix-up.
In the meantime, the house band's gonna rip through a few for ya.
Every few months, I give a band the wrong start time and slip us in ahead of them.
We might suck, but I never said we were idiots.
Tanya finished uni and went into anger management.
Lucy was the surprising one. He got a degree in pharmacy and went into business.
What goes around, comes around, I guess.
Joe kept up his medication and fell in love with a primary-school teacher.
Now, instead of one kid, he's got 35.
Kevin. Well, he's the same.
Some things just don't need to change.
That's good, right?
As for Katie, she never got to experience the highs and lows of being a rock star's wife.
But I think she's OK with it.
And me, a rock star?
Not my destiny. Still, you don't have to be a rock star to feel like one.

For a black-eyed little Susan, eh?
What's this then?
America.
No.
England, dear.
Shall I have that?
Let me have that, shall I?
Uh, would you give it to me?
Can't I have it?
It's for her own good, mind, because it will only make her upset.
There. That's better then, Suzie.
Isn't it?
Nice and clean.
Where are you from?
Where is she from?
She don't know.
She can't speak.
Maybe she don't speak English.
She's a gypsy.
Gypsy.
Raggle-taggle gypsy.
Stop it!
Gypsies! Come and have a look at the gypsies.

No more of that!
Now, you're in England now.
So you speak English, don't you?
They wouldn't let me speak Welsh, either.
But it did me the world of good... in the end.
You see, Suzie, you've got to learn to fit in.
Am laid
In earth
May my wrongs create
No trouble
No trouble in thy breast
Remember me
Remember me
But
Forget my fate
Nice, dear. Very nice.
But I'm afraid a nice voice is not quite enough.
You see, our girls are famous on the continent for their legs.
And other things.
- Why are you here, actually, dear?
- I want to go to America.
Ah, I see.
Another one.
Well, I suppose Paris is a step in the right direction.
And there's no harm in dreaming, dear.
I like a bit of ambition in my girls.
Which way?
Here.
We'll follow you.
I don't know where we're going. we should go out tonight.
I'll show you how to have fun.
Listen. Do you speak French?
Um, not really.
I can teach you some very important words which, you must know, are amour--
So you live all by yourself, you poor little duck.
Oh, this is, you know, not too bad.
There's plenty of room.
In Moscow there would be three families in here.
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving.
- What for?
- To go to America.
Suzie, you take my advice.
Buy yourself a nice dress... and you will find a rich man who will take you there, hmm?
I have a plan.
I will help you find little extra jobs.
What kind of jobs?
Oh, cabarets, parties.
Oh, Suzie, it's easy if you know the right people. And I will stay here with you, yes?
And we will share everything, everything. And... maybe we will have money left in our pocket at the end of the week.
It's a good idea, yes?
Hello.
- Something is missing.
- Like what?
Huh? The food.
My friends.
Even the cold.
This is nothing.
Winter was winter in Moscow.
But that's all finished with.
Forward.
Forward. We must always look forward.
Isn't that true, Suzie?
This is my father.
That's your father, yes.
Abramovitch.
But this is in Russian.
Why didn't you tell me before?
Suzie?
You don't understand Russian?
Abramovitch.
Ah.
So, he was a Jew.
Silence. Silence, everyone.
Please, mes amis.
Tonight we're lucky to have the guest star of Felix
Perlman's new opera company.
So please welcome Dante Dominio who has kindly agreed to sing something for us.
The best.
The best--
You are fantastic.
I just had to say that to you, that's all.
Ah, the girl with the horse.
Oh, yes, but I don't usually do that.
Oh, no?
No, no, no.
I'm a dancer, actually.
Ah, really?
Trained dancer.
Uh-huh. Where?
Uh, from Kirov.
So, you, uh, liked it, then?
Oh, yes!
You are--
You're sublime.
I can't imagine, myself, how it must be to-- to be on the stage at the same time as you.
You know, just somewhere in the background listening, in the chorus, for example.
Felix.
This, uh, young Russian lady... should come to your auditions.
And I have a friend.
She can sing.
Oh, is that so?
Say has a lovely voice.
La bella bambola.
She's very talented.
Eh?
So you sing too?
No. l-- A little, little bit, but I dance.
Suzie, there you are.
There.
Hold it! Hold everything.
Hold it.
Felix, you really want me to stand here?
Not over there, huh?
No, over there, Dante.
Here you block the entrance of the horse.
The horse?
It-- It looks good, Dante.
"It"? "It" looked good?
Felix, tell me.
Is this, uh, opera or a spectacle?
I see no contradiction.
Allora,
I put another way.
Do you want the public to look or to listen?
Both, Dante, both.
The eyes and the ears.
Ah.
It's opera for the people.
And the people need to be entertained.
I came to Paris to sing.
Strangely, I believe the public are coming to listen to me, not to look at scenery or horses.
But then what do I know, huh?
Mmm. I am just a foolish singer.
Hello.
Ecola.
La bella bambola.
Hey.
Mm-hmm. Lola.
Lola. Bellissima.
Now you are here, with us, huh?
Yes. Thank you very much.
Bellissimo.
Yes, it's a great, great aria.
You see, Verdi, he understands that... the voice can express the highest ideals for man-- his search for strength and glory... and beauty.
Madonna.
No, but what is it like to be a star, to have everybody looking at you all the time?
I was not always where I am now.
Really?
Oh, no.
When I was a child, we had nothing, nothing.
But that is incredible.
We were immigrants.
Allora, from the south of Italy to the north.
It was cold?
It is the people.
They look down on you if you come from the south.
How terrible.
And because we were poor, we all lived in one little room-- the whole family.
No. The whole family?
That must have been so difficult for you.
Come on.
No.
Did you see how he looked at me?
You see, Suzie, there are rules of how you get your man.
Rules? What rules?
Well, first, you must play hard to get.
If it is too easy, he loses interest. He must feel that he is, uh, a hunter, and you are a beautiful wild animal he is hunting.
It's a primitive instinct, you see.
Second, if you want to make a man want you, and only you, you must smile.
And you must listen.
You always listen.
Mmm. He needs attention.
Men, you see, they are very, very fragile.
And third, you must look good.
Very good.
Actually, that's probably the most important thing of all.
You know, without my looks,
I would never have got out of Russia.
Never. Will you tell me something frankly, Suzie?
Do you think...
I should get my hair bleached some more or should I leave it like this?
Hmm?
So what do you think explains the rise of Fascism in your country?
An artist must be above politics.
- Don't you agree, Felix?
- So they say.
But, you know, there has been "caos."
- Come se dice "caos"?
- Chaos.
Chaos. Chaos and confusion in my country.
Mussolini believes in order and organization.
He understands that the Italian people must regain back... their self-respect.
By putting on black shirts and marching up and down in one of those rallies?
Ah, you intellectual, huh?
For the working man, the rallies are about dignity and strength.
The lighting, the music, the choreography creates an atmosphere.
- Magnifico!
- Mussolini most certainly has a great sense of theater.
Certo. Certo, huh?
And everything he does, huh, is big.
Yes. Yes.
You could learn something,
Felix. He really knows how to reach his public, huh?
Felix, thank you very much.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Let's go.
They're just gypsies.
So you, uh, sleep here, hmm?
And your, uh, friend... sleeps over there?
Da.
This is, uh, how it was... for me.
Yes.
This is, uh, how it was.
My mother and a baby in one bed.
And my brothers and me in the other.
End to end.
The sacrifices my mother made for me.
But why?
Why did your little friend, huh, refuse my invitation?
It's here.
It's too big for you, the room?
Perhaps soon there'll be not two, not three, but four occupants in the residence.
Would you say that again,
Madame Goldstein?
So now I understand why you didn't seem like the other English girls.
Eat.
Thank you.
Isn't it gorgeous?
Did he buy that too?
Yes.
You would not believe some of the restaurants he has taken me to.
Oh, my God. You have never seen such luxury.
It's beauty, this one.
Don't touch.
Get back. Your hands, they're dirty.
It fits me like a glove.
He knows my size.
I won't tell you how he knows, but he knows it.
Les enfants.
Stop.
Please!
Thank you.
Is she yours?
All the children here are mine.
And all the old ones, my parents.
We are family.
We are one.
No?
When I am laid
Am laid in earth
May my wrongs create
No trouble
No trouble
In thy breast
Remember me
But
Forget my fate
Remember me
But
Forget my fate
Who is in the photo?
Darling, why are you looking at that? It's just a photo of her father.
Ah, so the little English girl has a secret.
She is not what she seems, huh?
According to the Poles, it was at about 6.:00... this morning that the first full-scale attacks began.
It's happened!
My God, it's happened like I knew it would!
What has happened?
Sit, sit, sit.
I got out in time, but... my father, he said he was too old to walk a step.
Madame Goldstein, what has happened?
Germany has invaded Poland.
Now...
England and France must declare war on Germany.
They can't just sit back and watch the Nazis grab any country they want.
But here they will never come, child.
It's the land in the east they want.
Don't worry.
We are safe here in Paris.
After all, this is the country where they wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
Liberte, egalite, fraternite.
Now eat.
Why should we care what
Germany does in Poland?
I agree. They're always fighting about something over there.
Like it says here, "Who wants to die for Danzig?" Where the hell is Danzig anyway?
On the Baltic Sea.
Left of Russia.
Why should we care what Germany does at home?
They must have their reasons.
I agree.
It's none of our business.
But do you think they're right?
Do you think the Jews are really controlling everything?
Who do you think is controlling the money here in the theater?
I don't think
Monsieur Perlman is a Catholic.
That's it! Finished!
Finito! Chegazzo!
No more horses!
No more shit on the stage.
No more dirt in the theater.
Dante, please, don't take it personally.
The horse was not making a comment on your performance.
Be careful, Felix.
You need me for the success of your little project.
I think it would be more accurate to say that we need each other, Dante.
Non lo so. The people come and they pay.
I sing, they applaud.
You are just the ticket taker-- the man in the middle.
Thank you, Dante.
I take that as a compliment.
I could be singing... in any theater in Europe, but I agreed to sing in yours.
However, I do not recall a clause in my contract saying...
I was joining a circus-- a gypsy circus!
Fafangulo!
You gypsies should go back where you belong, huh?
You have no place in the world of the opera.
You understand me?
I talk to you.
His name is Cesar.
Allora, allora, she speaks.
La brunetta, huh?
But she speaks to them, but not to me.
Perhaps I do.
And why not?
- They are dirty.
- How would you be if you lived on the road?
Ah, well, but I don't.
I live in an apartment... with two bathrooms and beautiful furniture which I pay for with money I have earned.
Why do they live like that?
Because they are dirty, lazy thieves.
Because they don't want to work, to make something of themselves.
They live on the road because their homes were taken away.
They have nowhere else to go.
Allora, Lola.
Your little friend has become a gypsy lover.
I don't need you to fight for me.
I don't need any woman to fight for me.
I was fighting for myself.
And you say I am dirty.
You who are one of them, the gadges, the unclean.
No, no, I said--
Why are you accusing me?
I'm not one of them.
Then what are you?
Shh. Hush. Hush.
Oh, no more boring money problems.
I can't believe it.
He's a very kind man,
Suzie, hmm?
I thought you said you'd never move in with a man unless you were married.
I thought that was one of your rules.
Well, who says we won't get married?
He adores me.
Why do you criticize me all the time?
Don't you want me to be happy?
Don't you want me to look nice and eat well?
Why do you accuse?
You always accuse.
But I don't.
I haven't said a word.
No. You and your kind never do.
No!
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
The show can't go on.
There's nobody here.
You're here.
You look more beautiful than before, Suzie.
Why, thank you, Dante.
My mother was dark like you.
You, uh, have a good voice.
I... could help you.
But I don't need your help.
Why do you resist me, huh?
What do you see in men who have nothing, huh?
Hmm? l-- I like a girl with spirit.
That's why you could become... somebody.
Because you are a fighter like me, hmm?
Oh, we understand each other.
You have to fight to get somewhere... in this world, huh?
Maybe even fight... to kill.
If you are fighting to kill, you must be very, very sure you have God on your side.
Otherwise--
Otherwise what?
Otherwise, you are nothing more than a murderer.
Let me tell you something... about murderers.
It was the Jews... who killed Christ.
The Jews!
This crazy war... which is caused by a conspiracy of our bankers... is stealing my public.
I stand like a fool singing to an empty house.
You think you are better than me, huh?
Right?
You think that I am a peasant, an Italian peasant, and you are special.
You are chosen.
Well, let me remind you, nobody knows what you are.
Nobody needs to know, but you forget,
I know, and I can--
I agree, Signor Dominio.
No one needs to know and no one needs to tell.
Anyway, I came to tell you we're closing the production, which is sad for all of us.
- We're closing?
- Yes.
Half the population of Paris has already left the city.
- But my contract?
- It's meaningless. I have nothing left to give you.
I must tell you, if ltaly allies herself with Germany against France,
I'm afraid your position here as an ltalian in Paris will not be an enviable one.
Is that a threat?
A threat? From me?
The Germans are in northern
France, heading for Paris.
And my name is Perlman.
Oh, Maria, what do I have but my voice, the voice that you gave me?
I am nothing if I cannot sing.
Oh, Maria--
For the love of Italy, for the love of music, l-- l-- I beg you.
Let the Germans win.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
Hello?
Allez, allez, allez, musique.
One has to admit these gypsies can play their instruments well.
Yes, but, uh, there is no control, no refinement, feeling.
Tell me, Dante. Are you going to sing for us tonight?
Oh, well, uh--
He sang for us last year, but perhaps now he feels that it is... beneath his dignity after such a huge success.
He sang in
Perlman's company.
Uh--
Dante Singing Opera
Hey, little Suzie.
You have found your place at last amongst the animals.
And you have found yours.
So you know the little girl, Dante?
Oh, she was one of the, uh, oddities employed by, uh, Perlman.
Is she one of them?
Though she is very friendly with the gypsies, she is not, uh, one herself.
No? Then what is she?
She is a Jew.
So many cameras.
So many uniforms.
Wherever I look, there's a lens. I can't get away from them.
Suzie, do you need anything, meat, butter--
Lola, what did you want to see me for?
Oh, Suzie, I missed you!
I miss the fun we had together in that, um, little room.
Now, Suzie, I wanted to tell you that... you should leave Paris.
It's not safe for you here.
What do you mean?
You should get out as soon as you can.
That's all. Believe me.
Suppose I could get some tickets.
Some boat tickets to America where you've always wanted to go.
I don't want to go there any more--
You do. Believe me.
You absolutely do want to go.
If you knew what--
If I knew what?
Look, actually, I've got the tickets right here in my bag.
There's one for you.
There's one for me.
One for you?
You're leaving Dante?
Uh, no, not exactly.
He hasn't thrown you out?
Don't be ridiculous.
I could have whatever I wanted.
No, it's just that he--
Well, men!
You can't trust them once they've got what they want.
I should have known.
It's dangerous to trust.
Well, actually, it's dangerous to love.
Isn't that so, Suzie?
Anyway, one should never look back.
One should never regret.
Never.
They're planning to round everyone up.
Every foreigner, every Jew.
Lola says I should leave immediately.
But I don't want to go.
If you want to survive, perhaps you've no choice.
Who is this?
That's my father.
A daughter should be with her father, if she's not with her husband.
Don't leave me, Cesar.
Please don't go.
It is not me who is leaving, Suzie. It is you.
But I don't want to run away.
For you, at this moment, running is good.
It is better to run and live than to stay and die.
It is not the same for me.
I am not alone.
I have my family.
I must fight for my family.
I could stay and fight with you.
You need to fight for yourself.
But you're all I have.
No.
You have your father.
If he's alive.
Maybe I've been chasing a ghost.
If he is a ghost, then he is watching over you.
And if he is not, then he is waiting for you.
To my Suzie, who will go to America to find her father... and sing.
To my Cesar, who will stay and fight for his family.
I only wish
I could be with you.
Sunday is gloomy
My hours are slumberless
Dearest, the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers
Will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow
Has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever
Returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday
Well, frankly, Suzie,
Joe... is a little older... than I like, but--
You know what?
He has promised to help me get to-- and you-- get to Hollywood.
You see? Things always turn out for the best.
Do they?
Your father, Suzie.
That will be nice for you to see him at last, yes?
Yes, perhaps.
Anyway, we have each other again.
We can have fun.
We can forget those little differences, can't we, Suzie?
Yes?
Dreaming
I was only
Dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of my
Heart
Deep
Darling, I hope
That my dream
Never faltered you
Over there.
It looks like a woman.
Is she alive?
I think so.
You're all right now.
I'm pretty sure it's on the border with Russia.
Sit. Let me check the files from that region.
You know what?
You're lucky you have an English passport.
The quota from so many Eastern
European countries is full now.
You wouldn't believe the stories I've heard.
America is a big country, but not big enough to take all of us apparently.
But we should be able to trace someone who remembers him.
Abramovitch? Yes.
I think I know of this man.
Wait a minute. Isn't it the guy who lost his, uh, faith?
- That's the one.
- It has to be!
- What a voice.
- Please!
He said he had heard that the shtetl... where he had left his mother and his daughter had been burned to the ground.
Everyone perished.
Everyone!
Yes. Yes.
He said... he could no longer believe in a just God... and therefore could no longer sing.
It was a scandal.
Everybody talked about it.
Everybody. Everybody.
What happened to him?
He changed his name, along with his profession and went west.
A terrible thing.
The man was a Chazan, a religious man.
But he did well.
You must admit.
He did very well.
If you have a vision and you work hard like him, you can succeed over here.
Oh, yeah, sure.
All right.
Take this. Come with me.
Nice.
Excuse me. Do you know where
I could find Mr. Abrahams?
What do you want to see my boss for?
Well, he's my father.
Your father?
I think I'd better take you to our legal department.
Follow me.
I'd like to see my father.
That's all.
As you keep saying.
And if that's who he really is, then... you will see him.
But he's not well, you understand?
Not well at all.
His musicals have eaten him alive.
Frankly, he's worn himself out.
His family is very upset.
Very upset.
He has a family?
Fegele.
Daddy.
Fegele.
My little... bird.
My stepfather would not approve...
...I am a half-naked Klimt's studio.
You would be immortalized...
...And maligned.
Alma, you are alone?
Of course.
Your father-knows?
Of course not.
And where were you?
I do not tell you.
With your father,
You did exactly as your head.
But under my roof...
You should not have go to the ball alone.
Did you know?
You were right?
Yes. And spent a delicious moment.
It is the rules in our society.
If the artists met,
Art is dead.
This does not allow you a leave unaccompanied.
Especially in this kind of ball.
Alma, Alma, Alma,
You are very talented.
But you need more power.
No, that's not it.
It is superb. Full of life.
But too complex.
Stick to one theme instead of twenty.
Your drawings shocked half of Vienna.
And the other half?
I think she would pose for you.
It's more a bar than a workshop.
We just returned from a rehearsal of Beethoven's Ninth.
Mahler directed it?
Of course. Superb.
At least it was not one of his works.
His music is better than it seems.
I doubt it.
Difficult to stay until the end.
Too little copper melody.
People leave.
Mahler is a genius.
According to Brahms.
As a conductor, not a composer.
You do not want to meet?
Brahms?
Mahler.
Ll dine in Zuckerkandl tonight.
I did not invited.
Can you hold your tongue?
No, I do not think so.
I read your comment the new opera by Strauss, Bertha.
I agree, it's disappointing.
But superbly directed, Gustav.
I agree.
Finally, Strauss has already done better, but he did not have to blush.
I rather enjoyed it.
Even his wife has hated this opera.
Pauline?
Everyone knows she's crazy.
It is time that your sister is getting married.
Justine.
What will I do without her?
Without his care, my case is hopeless.
And you then?
Forty years ago, you invite yet the divas in your office?
Only about their performance, Bertha.
Why are you laughing?
We were talking about beauty.
Klimt said...
...That the head of Socrates was superb.
But I do not agree.
It is rather large and massive.
A bit like yours.
You can not find it beautiful?
No, not really.
Maybe you prefer my music my physique?
I admire your way directing an orchestra, Herr Mahler.
I do not know much about your music.
Then you are well the only one in Vienna.
You are right. I know.
It is not you are devoid of talent, but...
I find the theme your music...
...Very disorganized...
...And repetitive.
The orchestration is too elaborate...
...with too much foreign influence.
Sorry.
Sorry if I offended you.
No, not at all.
I'm just surprised a pretty young woman...
...Has an opinion on the issue so precise.
You do not come to scold me?
No,
I am here to change your mind on my music.
As for my head We can do nothing.
Piano.
But yesterday you said it was too piano.
That was yesterday.
Today I say it's too hard.
This is my symphony.
Gentlemen,
Not too chaotic for you?
Not too much copper?
Too much foreign influence?
It was excessive.
Done for.
A symphony is as rich as the world...
...and it takes all kinds to make a world.
As you know music.
It is my life.
So you know loneliness.
No, not at all.
This is reserved for composers.
I am in Zemlinsky.
I have already crossed.
What a wonderful man, is not it?
Zemlinsky?
I would not go that far.
Maybe not as much as you.
Or Socrates?
Your relationship with your players
I feel tight.
Tense?
They contradict myself constantly.
As soon as I innovate, they say:
'Tradition, Herr Mahler'.
'It's our tradition'.
I tell them that the tradition is synonymous with laziness.
You know what I want?
No.
Tell me.
Do not be offended...
No, but I'll be careful.
Head to one of my songs?
One of your pieces?
Perhaps one day during a rehearsal.
Just a repeat?
But there will be no public.
If me. Am I not enough?
But you would not be impartial.
Have you changed your mind the music of Herr Mahler?
Not completely.
Last week you said love me.
It was last week.
You are heartless, Alma.
Your cheeks are pink.
This march gave me warm.
Are you...?
Am I...?
Are you sure it's the work?
I thought that Justine would be.
I forgot, today is Tuesday, the day of her literary salon.
It is nothing, Gustav.
But your mother would disapprove.
I am not a child as you seem to think.
I do not think so.
No, not at all.
Already have a reputation.
Grandma says mom.
Reputation?
Me?
Want to seduce me, too.
It is not my intention.
You are so young.
Am I not attractive?
There, you play with me.
It is you who play with me.
We should get out.
Your sister will be back soon.
Not until a few hours.
Maybe should we wait?
Now you know that these are only rumors.
I'm not really a good lover.
It is a new generation...
Changing.
Dr. Loos.
You remember Schindler?
- Of course.
Delighted.
- You like?
Well, that's wild...
Even brutal.
But I bought it.
I think buying one of his sculptures.
Not enriches him.
It is not used to money.
It is the expression my tormented soul.
To be an artist, must have been a battered child.
Your parents beat you?
- No, never.
But a teacher, yes.
She wanted to make me a man.
Oskar.
Herr Klimt.
I would like to introduce.
Here Fraulein Schindler.
It is the Archduke and Duchess.
Who made this horror?
Vienna is not what it was.
Full of strangers, peasants and many people speak Czech.
I'm not talking to you, Herr Mahler.
Naturally.
But know that I am one.
As Director of the Vienna State Opera...
I have heard your concerts
Germany was a success.
Yes, a great success, although I was hard to be absent two weeks...
Now that...
Finally, you understand.
Alma and I like to have your blessing.
If you know as to ask for her hand, you should know that it would wait not consent.
Welcome to our family, Herr...
Welcome, Gustav.
I said that...
It seems that your brother have found your soulmate.
More than your soulmate.
She is very beautiful...
...That's enough.
Brilliant pianist.
It is all annoying.
And besides, she composes.
Have you heard rumors Liaison Klimt?
These are just rumors.
Klimt had links with all the women in Vienna.
Except me.
We were leaving.
Take our table if you want.
You go? Too bad.
Delighted.
I return later, Justine.
Two coffees.
So...
It's just one thing...
...He must promise before marriage.
Everything else is perfect.
And what is it?
From now on, do you consider...
...My music like yours?
I do not understand.
What would our lives if we were
Both composers?
Our life would be great, nourished by music.
Ours.
What happened?
Ll wonder to give my life for him.
It's a metaphor.
No, he speaks sincerely.
What does he mean?
If we marry,
I have to stop composing.
My life as an actress has kept me heart.
Your father did not ask me to leave the theater, but it happened.
What do you mean?
Do you regret your wedding?
Nothing so simple.
I said...
- He's getting late.
I am ready soon.
Simply...
...men and women are different.
Do you think that a woman require the abandonment of passion?
No, because we know the value of the sacrifices made...
To our husbands and our children.
Their lives become our own.
One day you realize that we live only half.
But it's already too late.
But what can I do?
What should I do?
I like it, Mom.
You are very young.
Find another one.
Nothing can replace your music.
Villa Mahler, Maiernigg.
Three years later.
Thank you for my music copied so quickly.
What do you think?
These pieces are great, but...
But?
They are so tragic.
Ruckert wrote these poems
On the death of her two children.
Yes, but why when our children...
...Are so...
I do not know.
Of course, my music is not German.
I myself am a triple exile.
A Czech in Austria...
...an Austrian among Germans...
...and in addition a Jew or that I am.
But you are a Christian, Gustav.
Do not forget it.
Christian, because my career depends on it.
No cross, no concert.
So what?
The second violin started too soon...
...And the trunk..
Gustav, it was beautiful.
You dine with us tonight?
- Diner? Yes, of course.
Fantastic.
Superb, Gustav. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Gustav was excellent.
What a night.
Strauss loved it.
It has not stopped to congratulate me throughout the dinner.
Pauline did not notice...
...The error of 1 movement.
Almaschi.
Almaschi, dear.
What a great evening. Superb.
Good night.
Look.
They come home Steiner.
Superb.
This man is a genius.
Still have shirts?
I did the accounts.
What a smart mom.
It's a mathematician.
He was goingonce.
Unejolie granddaughter whose father was unjoyeuxdrille.
It étaittrés beautiful
Although quetropfréle...
...He loved each of her brown curls.
I'll be late.
You are not late.
Goodbye Maria, Goodbye Anna.
Give me a smile, Almaschi, so that with me all day.
I told him to leave you alone but she insisted.
In five years, I rebalanced accounts.
He knows nothing about money.
The money goes to his sisters, his parents, a whole family.
I can not buy me anything.
You are not reasonable, Alma.
Me?
I thought you would understand.
I understand, but you your responsibility.
Work first.
Do not ask to worry about the day.
When he composed?
At one time or religion you are more interested in his music.
I decide who is Jewish or not.
He leads a very successful career.
You have a famous husband and pretty children.
You have managed its finances and paid his debts.
Soon you will have new dresses, and anything you want.
And it is too late.
Two years later.
Breathe deeply.
The steam will relieve your lungs,
Maria.
Well done, my dear.
Deeply.
Still, my dear.
Needless to examine me, Doctor.
I can tell you myself
I was heartbroken forever.
When was your last exam?
I do not know.
What would change?
Herr Mahler, your doctor you he said you had a heart problem?
Hogwash. I am in great shape.
However, infection pneumonia...
Doctor thank you for your advice.
Sorry.
I feel better today.
And why not?
Buttermilk and lettuce.
I came here to convalesce and not to starve.
And how long Are you?
A week.
I'm sure it seems to you more.
This cure you of the good does it do?
Not yet.
You fainted.
This is the contact of fresh air after the hot bath.
It was so peaceful.
I felt almost...
Leave.
Are you a physician?
I am a patient.
Are you cold?
I bring a blanket.
The sun makes me feel good.
In the absence of cocktail...
...do you want a tasty glass of water?
You are so nice.
It's so good to feel pampered.
Herr...?
Gropius.
You dance?
You are complicit with Dr. Baum.
What do you mean?
Doctor advised me not to brooding longer...
...But dancing every night.
Happy to be part of your therapy.
Really, Herr Gropius?
Dancing is one of my two passions.
And the other?
I am an architect.
Dancer and architect.
You must have other areas of interest.
Almaschi, dear.
You are beautiful.
Will you die too?
One day, dear, but not before be very very old.
And when you die, what's going on?
Do we still friends?
I do not know. Maybe.
I have finished the rehearsal at 18 h 15.
I will be at home to 1358 am.
But I will call, just in case.
In case what?
Or I'd be late.
Good morning.
You want the mail or I ring?
I take it.
Thank you.
Dad is it old?
More than I say.
Does this mean he will die soon?
Honey, do not worry.
I'm never sick, you know that?
Why were you in therapy?
Because I was sad.
Maria is missing, is not it?
The orchestra is ready.
I have a letter for you.
The author has incidentally
Herr Mahler has addressed...
...Instead of Frau Mahler.
Would you like me to read?
'My dearest and precious Alma.
'We promised not to see us once in Vienna.
'But I miss you so much.
'I do not eat, can not sleep.
'I just hope...
'Your' therapy ' as much as you miss me.
'I know you and I will not be cured,
'As we will not united forever.'
I could go on...
But I'm that you know the author.
You have pushed me.
I had to give up everything for you.
You have stifled my ambitions, you have frustrated...
...And kept prisoner in this house.
You crushed my personality.
You made me suffer so much.
Wrong.
- It's true.
You thought that your music.
You forget my birthday...
...And that of our marriage.
I loved you, Alma.
Our children.
Yes, you loved our children.
But I, you have used.
I was your assistant, your accountant, your servant.
I hate you, you and your Jewish music.
You are free to leave Alma...
...hoping that you will stay.
Come with me.
I can not.
Really?
He needs me.
It has already lost Maria.
It would die if I lost too.
He has accepted a position overseas.
I have to accompany because he is sick.
You are a nurse?
No, I'm his wife.
Regardless, I am committed.
It was Gustav Mahler.
I love you, Alma.
I know...
I know.
But my place is with him.
You must understand this.
I understand that, but can not accept it.
I'm sorry.
We are here for four months already.
I feel alone in New York.
I presquetotalementisolée, although there a German community.
You are ahead.
Sit down.
I have something for you.
Voila.
It'll be different this time.
It will get better.
For him too, Lavie étaitdifficile.
Fidelio and Don Giovanni were successful.
Maisler criticism was hostile the compositions of Gustav.
Ladirection the Philharmonic wanted most popular pieces.
Of course, ilrefusait.
I worry about his health.
DeMaria afragilisé the death.
No one has Ledroit to mention his name.
J'aitenté to persuade ship the avian.
I silasse.
I miss you, Walter.
You will have plenty of suitors after my departure.
You are so young and so beautiful.
Maybe I do not die, after all.
Sorry, I did not think you find here.
I thought you had to...
I did not go to the cemetery has to remember him.
What is it, dear?
Are you going again?
Like when Maria died?
No, my love.
I am much stronger at the time.
Here Oskar Kokoschka.
I hired him to do my portrait.
I think we know.
Not really.
I am delighted to meet you Frau Gropius.
And why not?
Walter and I are friends long...
...And I have heard of your family.
So the architecture interests you?
Much.
And which of our buildings you like the most?
Difficult, I love them all.
The Museum of Berlin, perhaps, designed by the great-uncle Walter?
Yes, it's very pretty.
Pretty?
Finally, strong, with nice lines.
I think you are more aware the music of architecture.
Been to the workshops.
Your father...
- ... Was painter.
And less messy than you.
I start or?
Here, the light is perfect, as the model.
I know your work...
...And do not find soft with your models.
Even an idiot can paint reality.
As taking a picture.
I am interested in the thought, the desire, the pulses.
You are the painters of Freud.
By the way, the picture...
...I'm not interested.
Superb.
You managed to capture the image of his soul as an impostor.
Every day...
Pardon?
Alma worry.
It is still a workshop Kokoschka.
Like me when it was my portrait.
Yes, but it's different.
Do not worry.
Oskar is not his type of man.
It is too wild.
With the danger that points the side of the Balkans, we have real worries.
Come.
Sorry.
I do not see more.
She was in shock after the death of Gustav.
Yes...
...but it has great resilience.
Do not move.
I do not like my models move constantly.
Then I go...
...And paint an apple.
That is why Your father was a landscaper.
What are you reading?
Freud.
'The Interpretation of Dreams.'
What do you think?
Ll have to see.
Gustav had consulted.
For you had driven him mad.
Certainly.
So why?
Why what?
Had he consulted?
Because I made him mad, I suppose.
He feared that I go with another man.
This is not the case.
Freud told him that I did not quit, because it represented my father, and...
- ... It could be your father.
Yes, but it was strong.
And he wrote brilliantly.
And your lover, was it as strong?
Did I say he was my lover?
No need.
He was attentive.
Older too?
No, younger than me.
He does not like you harassing me and was not so...
...If lout.
- Si..
Sorry, Oskar.
I tend to be aggressive...
...And grab the sex of the peasants.
I wonder what Freud would say.
Anna asked me...
If I painted... someone other than you.
How did you know, Uncle Oscar?
I read minds.
But I read only in those of your mother.
Is this true, Mom?
I do not know. Maybe.
And I think it can...
...Read minds Oskar's uncle as well.
You are mistaken.
It will not be the first one, nor the last, Mom.
As Mahler's widow, you should both stay here.
As Mahler's widow, I fortunate to live where I want.
Is Uncle Oskar coming with us?
No, dear.
He has his own house, but he spent time with us.
It's going to talk.
There is talk already.
It has you hypnotized.
No, I hypnotized.
Why are so many conveniences?
I am not asking you to hide,
But to show you.
A man without education or family.
People...
- No sermons.
My father was not buried you had a lover.
You bought your marriage at all.
Cruelty does not become you.
Nor false modesty.
I do not want to remember him.
Sorry it bothers you.
Send it to your mother.
She was not married to him.
I do.
Do I talk about my conquests...
...Before you?
Invite them to the opera, and pretend there is nothing between us.
Do as you please.
Gustav was part of my life and it will remain there.
I love you, me.
You honored he like me?
It did not have time.
Time is money for love.
It will kill you if you're not careful.
And even if you pay attention.
Or I'll kill her, Mom.
Are you ready to spoil your life your art...
...to an obsession?
Maybe.
Gift of reconciliation.
Superb.
Am I welcome?
Uncle Oskar.
You've come play with me.
Well, it's for you.
It's very pretty. Thank you.
I promised to take you to the Prater.
That's true.
A gentleman keeps his promises.
Are you a gentleman,
Uncle Oscar?
I'm in my own way.
A mirror, quickly.
After eating, we go to the park.
I promise not to be jealous of you, Gustav.
Like Alma, I love you.
You are part of it,
So you will be part of me.
Alma, why Oskar?
And why not you?
I gave up long ago.
But hope remains.
What do you say?
Klimt think you're wild.
I once was.
You are only asleep.
Like a volcano.
And Italy, then?
We missed you.
Magnificent, Italy. And women.
Guarded by armed men.
Red wine, please.
I am delighted that we are meeting tonight.
Oskar, did you know Alma Mahler met me?
Sometimes I wake up and I can still hear his music.
As if it was, playing in the apartment.
Luckily, the ghost of Gustav is confined to the living room.
I hate to share Alma's bed with him.
What's going on?
You are remote.
You were shameless.
So realize.
I'm not usually a widow.
But that of Gustav Mahler.
You have made a saint.
It is a perfect time.
Your friends are aware, like everyone else.
It is a limit.
One should not say anything.
I think not.
Marry me, Almi.
One day.
- When?
When you paint a masterpiece, you will then have the means, dear.
For the reverse would be impossible.
Stop for a moment.
What's going on?
The Archduke and Duchess were killed in Sarajevo.
By a terrorist.
A terrorist?
Rather an artist.
It's just for a few days.
I can not stand being here without you.
Goodbye, dear.
I painted my masterpiece.
'The Bride of the Wind.'
And it is sold.
I have enough money for one year.
Look, Alma. It is you...
And me.
You are my 'Bride of the Wind'.
Despite all the ills of the world.
Here are two things love for eternity.
It's a small fortune.
Finally, for me it's a fortune.
You've missed a lot.
What is it?
Nothing.
You have a lover.
No.
Who?
Let me go.
If you do not your promise to marry me,
I swear I will kill you.
Who did you see there?
- Nobody.
Why this trip?
Let me go, I will tell you.
I am pregnant.
Why be part of it?
Just to think.
I made my decision.
I do not care.
But it's my child.
Mine too.
With the war, they become proud.
Half of Europeans had to be killed.
All of these lovers, dead forever.
Uncle Oskar.
Look mom, or will Uncle Oskar?
Russia.
Or he had the money for the horse and the assignment?
It sold 'The Bride of the Wind' to pay for the assignment.
Dr. Loos has paid the horse.
For your safety, Oskar.
It had to finance the love and not war.
Not too strong, I would not do he changes his mind.
It was always us.
It choked me,
I could not breathe.
Uncle Oskar come back soon, do not worry.
You want a pastry?
Choose yourself the best.
It is not much choice.
Did you know that your friend Walter Gropius...
...Is an officer on the Western Front?
He was decorated twice.
I write a paper on it for my newspaper.
Welcome to hotel Imperialists, madame.
I was surprised to hear from you.
How did you or I?
I learned by chance.
I miss you.
The war prevented me write to you.
Your mother was also an excellent dam.
She did not like me.
She disapproved of the situation.
You were married.
Not any more.
Is this the house of Frau Mahler?
Looking for work?
No, a revenge.
Really? And you are?
The mother of Oskar Kokoschka.
Tell him,
I have a gun...
...And I wait.
You have heard the news?
I read the paper today.
Oskar died.
Killed on the Eastern Front.
His mother is at the bottom.
Stepmothers I have never loved.
The poor.
She's crazy.
Maybe not.
That could receive shot in the head...
...And survive?
My God.
You kept the baby.
I died and resurrected twice.
You left more than a year.
The first six months do not count.
I did not know who I was, then everything came back to me...
...And I thought only you.
More than a year.
It was love, you've wasted.
I was forced.
If you were back home,
I would have advised for Herr Gropius.
This is my love for her
I was able to survive.
It went to the Jewish peasant.
Finally, she married a good German.
People forget reputation.
I'm sure.
You are better off without her.
I do not want to create for the rich.
The poor can not pay you, honey.
Not if we continue...
Loading... buildings superfluous ornaments.
It must be functional, ended the romance.
This will change the image of Vienna.
Ll need to work with artists and artisans.
Your portraits are bold. Remove them.
You have become too prudish.
I agree to live with Mahler's music...
...But not with the memories of your...
Your relationship with Kokoschka.
It is a great artist.
Pick them.
And you talk about collaboration?
Down with the dictatorship.
Franz.
You were on the front?
No, these are popular events.
How awful, these socialists.
Luckily the police were.
But they called the army?
No, I showed, Frau Gropius.
You are not serious.
Of course I am.
One day we overthrow the monarchy.
You're crazy.
My dear, may I present Franz Werfel?
Herr Werfel.
I am a great admirer of your writing.
Do you forgive my political opinions?
It is nothing to forgive.
The war revealed the worst and the best man.
Your poetry is a of the most moving I have ever read.
You must be proud.
Proud, but with too little success.
It will come.
Maybe...
...Would I be the musician.
A composer like Verdi or Puccini.
If only I had written
'Tosca' and 'Un Ballo in Maschera'.
Herr Werfel, a man your intelligence and sensitivity...
...Should not choose Wagner and Verdi.
Verdi is the passion, emotion and enthusiasm.
Wagner is cold, stoic and abstract.
I prefer the passion, heat, love and ecstasy.
I guess Walter gave me a respectable, after Gustav and Oskar.
The Arian perfect.
And me, you call me one day the perfect Jew?
Never.
You are far from perfect.
Not like your husband.
- Not like my husband.
The problem is that perfection is terribly boring.
I came here long ago, with Mahler before our wedding.
It haunts you.
Yes and no.
Part of me still married to him.
I think I finally made my mourning.
I'm going to flourish his grave, then.
Gropius and I will invite...
And Oskar?
Should be included Oskar?
- Yes.
And Klimt, and Zemlimsky.
My dear, you created a regiment of lovers.
Perhaps my only success.
Or Oscar? I'm hungry.
It is with this woman.
He has paraded with her all day.
Yes, I heard that too.
It's a rumor.
It may not have recovered with Alma.
She is a writer.
That was yesterday.
Alma, my dear.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sorry to be so late.
They seem to love you, darling.
Let's go sit.
I am very hungry, do not you?
Stéphane.
Soup.
Thank you.
Almaschi.
IRA does with you in bed?
Of course.
How about a real woman, one day?
But it is real.
Real.
And passionate.
Very passionate.
It is the love of my lifetime.
What is good home, that it is not annoying.
And it is music.
Did you know?
It was the best of Vienna.
The most beautiful.
You're still in love.
I withdraw my advances.
Open the door, Alma.
You have finished your chapter?
Almost.
You are a great writer but a lazy man.
Call me when you're done.
I'll wait.
Please I open this door.
I will work after.
Why won't you marry oncle Franz, Mama?
Perhaps I will some day, Anna
When?
<b>- Do you love him so much?<b>
<b>- He loves you so much.<b>
What difference does it makes if we're not already married?
Is he going to leave us?
Are you going to send him away?
Whatever made you think that?
I haven't given you much reason to believe that I'd stay with him or any other man, have I?
I've found some of your music, Alma
You should start composing
- Your songs...
- Immature...
So much time is passed, it's too old to start again.
Your music is wonderful.
Is it?
Is it too complex?
It's you... Alma.
It's passionate...
It's charming, it's... exciting...
Those days were amazing.
Being a kid, you know, what else was I to do but to live the Dragon?
I'd study the music note for note.
I read every interview.
Copied every outfit, every move, you know, every look.
My pursuit of perfection
was relentless.
The music deserved that.
All right, ladies. Spread them.
Rob, you're not nailing the squeal.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Check it out.
Play it like that.
That's it.
That's a ping, not a squeal.
- Sounds just like the tape, man.
- No. Raunchier.
Again, please.
That was great. Thank you.
From the top.
Hold on!
Hey, Jeremy, no.
What are you doing?
You know what this is?
Lubricator, signed by all five band members with the original cover.
Look. Jorgen's name is misspelled.
It should be an "E."
You know how much I can get for it?
Peace to you too, dude.
Try it like this.
Mom?
Mom, isn't my room off-limits?
I'm sorry, Chris.
Oh, what were you doing?
- How are you?
- Good. How's Willard?
- He's fine. You look nice.
- Thank you.
Here, hold on.
You got a smudge.
- Bye. Gotta run.
- Bye. Love you.
Love you too. Bye.
I need more power! I want more!
Come on, come on.
Nina and Samantha!
Hey, Chris.
- Coming to my show in a week?
- Of course.
- Want to hand out fliers?
- Absolutely.
- You guys look awesome.
- Bye.
We're a band called Blood Pollution... a Steel Dragon tribute band, the best in Pittsburgh.
Thank you.
I wrote this one for someone who ripped out my heart.
And put it through a bloody blender!
That's right.
This one's for Kim, who makes me want to stand up and shout.
Em, I'll be right back, okay?
Excuse me.
You think I could have one?
Not without a blowjob and a sex change, pal. But have a nice day.
- Come on, girls. This way.
- See you, Chris.
Oh, that was awesome!
That was the heaviest since Columbus in '77.
Heavier than the Demented tour.
- I ask you, did they not rock?
- They totally rocked.
Guys.
What the...?
Come on.
Oh, I thought I smelled pussy.
Look who's here.
- If it isn't Yoko Ono and the Fag Five.
- What are you doing?
Making sure nobody sees some cut-rate copy band.
Cut-rate? This dude can't even tune his own guitar.
- You could work on your lip-synch.
- I don't lip-synch.
Be doing everyone a favor if you did.
You could get the outfit right.
Boots from the Wasted tour and a cheap Twisted jacket.
You are so fully wrong, cocksmoker.
This is official issue.
The actual vest Bobby wore on the Twisted tour.
My dad bought it from someone who knows them.
Sorry, but your dad got ripped.
The lapels should be blue, there's no green in the embroidery.
As a matter of fact, can anybody here honestly say... they've ever seen Bobby Beers with a jacket with red lapels?
- No, I can't.
- I don't think so.
You can make me his pants.
Or did she already rip out the Dodge seats?
No. First tell me what you put there to make people think you're a guy.
- This is all me, baby.
- You and a few ballet slippers.
- You want a piece of me?
- No, I'm good.
- Want to see how a real man...
- Don't touch her.
- Let go of my cape.
- Let go of my cape!
Get your ass out of bed.
Get out of here.
- Let's go. Get up.
- Get out of here.
Move it.
Where you hiding your stash these days?
Get out! I didn't do anything.
That's the problem.
You never do anything.
- Get out of here, pig!
- God... Fucking...
Come on!
Mom! Mom!
Jeez, boys. Quit. Break it up.
Chris, give him a break. Come on.
- Stop it!
- Tell him to get out!
- Used to be my room.
- Not anymore!
Because I moved out when I was 18.
- We're having breakfast.
- Keep him out!
Get ready for work.
Will you go downstairs?
- Keep him out!
- All right, he's gone.
So you arrested Mervin for drunk driving?
He was parked on the Brennemans' lawn.
Claims he was going out for ice cream.
Same story.
- Chris, so how was the show?
- It was fine.
- The freaks were out in force.
- Why weren't you busting heads?
- Female officers handle that crowd.
- You want to go?
- Come on.
- Saved again. Should take her to work.
- Good one.
- Did they do "Black Babylon"?
They haven't played that since Osaka in '75.
- That is pathetic that you know.
- I love that song.
Okay, genius, who's buried in Grant's tomb?
It's twisted that you're still living at home, stealing Ma's makeup.
Who's buried in Grant's tomb?
How much longer will you put up with this?
The rock star fantasy thing is something you grow out of at 14.
If I get lucky, I'll get to grow up and listen to Air Supply like you.
What's wrong with Air Supply?
Nothing, if you're from the Village People.
You know what the sickest thing is about you?
It's that you don't have any fantasies of your own.
You fantasize about being somebody else.
Wearing somebody else's clothes.
Singing somebody else's songs.
It's pathetic.
- Get a haircut.
- Okay, Satan's allegiant.
Have a good one, son.
- You didn't eat.
- Later. I love you guys.
Love you too.
- I love you.
- You do this every time.
I question his sexuality, Ma. I do.
Here's the procedure, so it won't happen again. Don't stick a pen in.
I'll give you a simple one-two-three procedure.
It's 1-2-3.
Pop that down, push this.
Pull back on this lever, free up the jam and you can access...
Is there something wrong?
Is that mascara?
- I'm in a band. Okay?
- Oh, okay.
Can you follow the 1-2-3 without sticking a pen in there?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
Sorry about that.
When's Marci getting back?
She and Rob went to see Wham!
Won't be back for a while.
Wham!? Oh, God.
George Michael's a wuss.
I'm gonna give Rob shit for it.
He'll want to cover that.
All right, you.
Okay, now just relax.
- Is it numb?
- I think so.
Feel that?
- Sure you want to do this?
- Yeah, Bobby did it last week.
- I love you, babe.
- I love you.
Okay, don't look. Don't look.
- God, that had to hurt.
- Yes, it does. Oh, God.
You want to do the other one?
No. You want to do yours?
- Maybe.
- Come on. Let's do yours.
Testing, testing. One, two.
- No way!
- That's right. That's my boy.
All right, ladies, who had the weenies?
Do I have too much foundation on?
I keep putting this shit on till I want to fuck myself.
- Hey, Rob, you wearing underwear?
- No.
Rob.
You know the drill. No panties.
- Get up.
- I am not freezing my balls...
Just stand up and drop it.
- I'm not taking it off.
- Come on.
If you want, take them off.
I am not taking off...
Your woman's an animal!
All right!
Before we get too into this party.
- I love you!
- Love you too.
Before we get too deep into this party,
I want to thank Key Steel... for letting us use their place of business to pay tribute... to the metal created by none other than Steel Dragon!
And a special thanks to my brother, Joe... who gave me my first Dragon record because he hated it.
And to my parents, because they let me play it as loud as I wanted!
- That's my boy!
- That's my baby!
Because they rock!
Now, this next tune...
I’d like to dedicate to someone who, when I first met... ripped my heart out and put it through a bloody blender.
That's right! This one's for Emily!
She turns me up and shakes me down and makes me want to what?
Stand up and shout!
What was that?
What was what?
There's no solo break after the chorus.
They don't care.
That's not how the song goes.
I know how the song goes.
If you know how it goes, then play it right.
Chris, you are taking this shit too seriously.
That's right, because the music deserves to be taken seriously.
If you don't, you don't deserve to play it.
All right, you need to get a grip.
You've ruined your performance.
Do not ruin mine!
Hey!
Plug that fucker back in.
Quit it!
- That's my amp!
- Do not ruin this concert! Do not!
Hey, fuck this concert!
Here we go again.
- Hit him in the bollocks.
- That wraps it up for tonight.
Grab a T-shirt and cassette on your way out. Thanks for coming.
Cut it.
- What's up?
- What's he doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Bradley's our new front man.
You made your point.
Get him out now.
- Only one leaving is you.
- Chris, see these?
It's the new P.A. He brought with him.
And that's the new mixing board.
Have you heard his voice?
- Sit and spin.
- Dude, just relax.
I don't care if Bradley can hit the notes Bobby Beers can hit.
Bobby's leaving the band anyway.
- You don't know.
- Nina and Samantha say he's leaving.
- Bullshit.
- It doesn't matter.
We want people to hear our originals.
We're tired of being a cover band.
- We're a tribute band.
- No, dude. We are a cover band.
The problem is, you think you're in Steel Dragon.
I love you, man, but you're mental.
Get a grip on reality. You don't know where Bobby Beers ends and you begin.
I'm mental, because I don't want to be in a cheesy bar band... that butchers music and makes them listen to your crappy originals!
Crappy? "Whole and a Half" kicks ass.
I'm proud to have written it.
That's why we got so many requests for it.
Don't shit on me because you're scared to write your own songs.
Yeah, that's it. I'm too scared.
If you wanna make it, you write your own tunes.
Thanks for the tip, bro.
Look, come on, guys.
We loved playing Dragon tunes. We couldn't imagine playing anything else.
- I thought it'd be a goof.
- A goof?
Wouldn't you rather fail as yourself... than succeed as a Bobby Beers clone?
You can write a song about why I would wanna do that!
All right, you're gone. Just go!
What's so fucking funny?
Babe, come on. Let's go.
Fine. This is my mike stand!
I'm taking it! These are my cables.
I'll get new cables.
- Don't think I'm coming back.
- I don't.
- Well, that's because I'm not.
- Good.
I'm serious. If I leave,
I'm not coming back!
- You said that!
- Shut up, Bradley.
Last time.
Emily.
If you still want to manage us, then it's okay with us.
Rob, I'm a businesswoman.
Rule one in this business is you go where the talent is... and all the fucking talent that was in this band just left.
You know, those guys are so replaceable.
It'll take me five minutes to put together a band and blow them away.
Maybe this is just a sign.
You know, just time to move on.
I'm not in the mood to look on the bright side now.
No, this is an opportunity for you... to write your own songs.
Why?
Be another clown with a guitar, trying to get attention? No way.
Remember what you wrote for me on my birthday?
- No.
- Yes, you do.
Come on, please.
It's embarrassing.
Are you done making fun of me yet?
I love that song.
You're not getting it.
You're not hearing me.
I'm telling you, first time I ever saw you... first time I laid eyes on you... sophomore year, Bill Starbuck in The Rainmaker.
I said to myself,
"Oh, my God, that guy's got it."
I mean, my heart stopped.
And I said,
"That guy is going all the way."
I was just singing someone else's lines.
I did not write them.
- My favorite color is rainbow.
- Mine's mauve.
I said no. Haley, did you answer the telephone? Thank you.
Sunshine Daycare.
Chris! Telephone!
Telephone!
You want to help me crack eggs?
- I want five.
- Five eggs.
Chris? Is that Chris Cole?
- Who is this?
- This is Kirk Cuddy.
Ricki, your accent is as lame as your playing.
What do you suggest
I do about my playing?
Who is this?
I told you, it's Kirk Cuddy.
I play in a band called Steel Dragon.
- Maybe you've heard of us.
- I don't have time.
Hang on, hang on.
Listen to this, all right?
Are you lip-synching?
If this is Kirk, what did you call your third wife?
Do we have to talk about that old slag?
I called her Sugar Bum.
The second wife, too.
It's why the third left.
Now I affectionately refer
to all ladies as Tottie.
Is that enough for you?
My God, this is unbelievable.
I was sorry to hear about your dog.
Pookie?
Yeah. I sent flowers but I didn't get a response.
But I figured you're so busy.
Can we get past the This Is Your Life crap?
There's a ticket waiting for you for a flight to L.A. Tomorrow.
- Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.
- Tell no one about this.
- Yes, sir.
Good man. I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
Right there.
I'm Chris Cole.
I'm Tania. I work with the band.
- You went out with Bobby.
- You look like Bobby.
- Is that all you brought?
- My manager.
We traded the first-class ticket for two coach.
How resourceful.
Yeah, well, I thought so.
What was that? Did you see that?
Why are we here?
I should let Kirk explain everything to you.
Are those your breasts?
I'm sorry. What?
Your breasts. Are they yours?
Well, you know, I don't remember.
They're quite sensational.
Well, thanks.
That's just what I was going for.
So you're in a Steel Dragon cover band.
- Tribute band.
- Right.
I'm kind of sort of in between bands right now.
- Your pants.
- Emily had them made for me.
I bet they're easy to get in and out of.
So, when do we get there?
Tania, is it?
Tania.
- Are you famous?
- No, we're nobody. Sorry.
- Well, you should be!
- Oh, thank you. Bye.
- Can you get us in?
- I'm just trying to get in myself.
Follow me, darlings.
This is Bobby's Twisted tour in '77.
- Look at that.
- See the dragon?
That's Sammy!
Look!
It's a '58 Flying V in fire-mist gold.
And it's the real one. Look.
The fingerboards are rosewood.
That's from the
Delirious tour, right?
- Are you two coming or what?
- Yeah. Sorry.
Wait right here, all right?
Thanks a lot, Ralph. That's great.
- That's it?
- Yeah. Very nice. Thanks.
Lovely.
They're ready for you now.
What's up?
Thanks for coming.
Not too fagged out?
- I don't think so.
- Mats, the road manager.
I saw you in Pittsburgh.
You gave everybody a pass but me.
From the looks of you,
I had good reason.
We saw a tape of you singing provided by Nina and Samantha.
Is the incredible voice really yours?
- Cocksuckers!
- That would be you, Bobby.
You think some child can replace me?
You want to do your thing.
- You're firing me?
- Calm down.
You calm down, you wanker!
- It's because I'm gay, isn't it?
- You're gay?
No, I have pierced nipples and a house in Morocco because I'm John Wayne.
Have you listened to the lyrics of "Stand Up"?
Did you really think that Kim was a girl?
- Kim was a guy?
- Yeah, Kim was a guy.
He's my lover, to the horror of these sausage-jockeys.
- As if we give a toss.
- Just keep your dick away from me.
Stop it, man.
You don't turn up for recording sessions.
You missed half the gigs, and when you did show...
I am Steel Dragon!
Without me, you're nothing!
Give us a break.
You'll be playing for coppers in the tube without me!
We'll see.
Yeah. We'll see.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
My scarf.
- Take it.
- Yeah, I will.
Good.
If I leave now, I'm never coming back.
Never.
Heard you the first time.
What you looking at?
You think you can dress like me and be a star?
- No, sir.
- You have no idea what it takes.
You think it's all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll?
You got the sex wrong.
I never touch drugs.
No one does a gig like I do half-cut.
Not even at your age.
And it's bed, 11:30 every night before a gig. That's what it takes.
Just do your own thing.
Get your own life.
It's like being bloody Elvis.
Except Elvis was the king.
And I'm just the queen.
Very funny.
Ha-bloody-ha.
Bastards. You bastards.
Sorry about that.
- Missed your cue.
- Yeah, sorry, IK...
- You do know this song?
- Yes, sir.
We'll pick it up just coming out of the intro.
I'm sorry.
We wasting our time here?
Sorry. Could I start it one more time?
All right, go again.
Sorry about that.
I love you.
I love you.
Well, mate, do you want the gig, then?
Look in the lens, guys.
Go. Get in there more.
Give me attitude.
Two double-platinum records.
You're playing the Forum. You got
20 girls who want to be with you.
Give me rock star attitude.
Hold that. Here we go.
Hey, Izzy, let's try one with attitude. No smile.
Sorry.
Better. Now you're looking cool.
Come on, right in my lens.
Nice shot. Attitude.
We combed this entire planet looking for someone... heavy enough to pull this off and we found a star.
When this guy sings, you'll forget about Bobby Beers. I promise you.
Izzy! Is that your name? Izzy?
Yeah, the name's Izzy, like Izzy's Revenge.
Holy shit.
Izzy? I'm not calling him Izzy.
Can you hit all the notes
Bobby can?
That's why I'm in the band.
Stand up and shout
How do you keep your voice in such great shape?
My choir teacher gives me really cool exercises...
He eats a lot of pussy, that's how.
Yeah, I eat a lot of pussy.
- Classy.
- Like father, like son.
- That's my boy.
- Come on, you guys.
- How was I?
- So good. So comfortable.
- I messed up my accent.
- It was great.
- Nice way to handle that "pussy" line.
- I can't argue with him.
Izzy, don't worry.
I'll make an honest man out of you.
I eat a lot of pussy.
Loads of it.
I eat a lot of pussy.
Tons.
I got my voice eating pussy, man.
It's a vocal technique exercise.
I got it eating pussy.
Loads of it. All the time.
It's all I do. Breakfast, morning, noon, night. I've got to have it.
It's all I do, is eat pussy.
I love it.
Either get in here and do it or shut up.
Hold on. Oh, shit! I eat pussy!
Hi. I'm Izzy's mother.
- Have a good one.
- I'll see you up there.
- Did you see all the people?
- I know. Just breathe.
You'll be great.
Nobody knows these songs better.
- True.
- Be yourself, Chris.
- Don't get...
- Izzy.
You'll be great, babe.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
All right, matey.
Time to go to work.
Sorry, darling, back to the henhouse.
I'm gonna sit with his parents.
Whatever twirls your beanie.
Come on, mate.
- I gotta piss.
- What? You gotta piss?
- Go now.
- I can't.
Or you gotta use it. Use it.
You're awesome. Bye, babe.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Well, you're in my house now, mate.
And I ain't lost a man yet.
- Let's do it.
- Here we go.
Let's do it, Mats.
This is your coronation, my dear.
There you go.
All right, boy.
You're okay.
You won't need it, but there's a bucket in each wing, all right?
- Up you go.
- All right, Mats.
Break a leg!
Are you all right, Izzy?
END OF CD 1
- You're sweatin'.
- I know!
I'm excited, though.
I can see it all happening.
A little turn. Now side to side.
- # Raindrops and roses...
- Other people can sing.
#.. on kittens
# White copper kettles and warm woollen mittens
# Brown paper packages tied up with string
# These are a few of my favourite things... #
- Can we talk?
- But she's fantastic.
- I think she sings funny.
- God!
- Her dancing's not great either.
- It's the first time she did it.
Bum bum-bum, bum bum-bum, bum bum-bum...
But I had the kettle by then, she didn't take the kettle.
Do you want me to...
No, I just want Kathy to put it here. This is...
You say these words, put your hands out and they're there.
# These are a few of my favourite things... #
Please, don't drop the props, Kathy.
# Cream-coloured ponies and apple strudels
# Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles... #
Why are you putting it on her head? I'm a little confused.
I don't know... Because she's not going to pick it up.
It looks like you're trying to put a hat on her head.
You're fantastic. You just have to listen to your heart, Cvalda.
I don't want you to call me Cvalda.
You're Cvalda to me.
Let's do some sound effects.
- Uh! # When the dog bites
- Woof!
- # When the bee stings
- Ouch!
# When I'm feeling sad...
- # When the dog bites
- Woof!
# When the... #
- I'm not barking.
- #.. I'm feeling sad
# And then I don't feel so bad #
Wait!
I told you no tapping in "The Sound of Music"!
It needs rhythm, like drums or something.
Everybody's doing a great job.
Really.
- Hello, Selma. Come in. Ready?
- Yeah.
- OK, you know where to stand.
- Yeah.
Let's try this one.
F- E-Z-D
Maybe the last one.
D- E-F-P-O
I think you can work that machine safely.
I'll write a note to the plant.
OK, thank you.
Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Bye.
# So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu... #
# I'd like to stay and taste my French champagne
# Ah-ha!
# So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu #
We lost five hours cos some idiot broke the machine.
- Bill's here.
- So?
Well, he's here with Gene.
That sounds like bad news.
What are you going to do?
I guess I gotta tell her, don't I?
# So long... #
You can't bring the script to work, Selma.
Keep your eyes on the machine, OK?
Yeah.
Sure, sure.
Bill's here.
Bill?
He's here with Gene.
Damn.
Not again.
You gotta come right back, OK?
Don't be too worried.
We'll work this out. Here she comes.
Why are you not in school?
When I say so you go to school.
Do you think I joke?
You have to study!
Come on, Selma, stop.
We talked about this, didn't we?
Hanging out with those automobile thieves.
- So what?
- He's learning.
Selma, he's learning.
Gene, this is the most important thing.
You have to go to school.
I- I-I can drive him back to school.
Since when was that your business?
If you need a ride home...
I- I don't even punch out till another two hours.
- Sometimes you punch out around now.
- I never punch out early!
Don't need a dump!
Don't need a ride!
.. in your little head.
Let's get you to school, Mr G.
Thank you, but... I'll just,
I'll just ride my bike.
Bye, Jeff.
She likes you.
I'm sure of it.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure of it.
This is my punishment, that you help me with this.
And you've got...
You've got to make your bed as well.
And you forgot to wrap up the bread... two times.
There's no more of that.
You keep reading.
"So long, farewell, auf... wiedersehen,
"adieu, adieu, adieu to yieu and yieu and yieu. "
To "yieu" and "yieu"...
What does that mean...
"yieu"?
- It's your dumb musical.
- And yieu?
It's German.
Do you think?
- Y-you want some more ketchup?
- No.
Are you tired?
Wh-Why should you... always ask me so, so stupid questions?
Shall I show you my step?
# So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu
# So long... #
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Gene. Hi.
How's the dancin'?
- Oh, good, yeah.
- Yeah?
You want to come to me and Bill's place and listen to some music?
That... that would be lovely.
But we couldn't.
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah, I'll...
Let's go. Come on.
You should ask Bill about his money.
Linda likes it when we talk about that.
You're doing a nice job of these.
How about that?
You have to be very careful not to bend the card.
Otherwise I don't get paid for it.
No?!
That's fair, because the people in the shops would never buy it if it's bent.
- You wouldn't buy it if it was bent.
- That's true. No.
In Czechoslovakia... I saw a film and they were eating candy from a tin just like this.
- No
- I thought to myself... how wonderful it must be in the United States.
Yeah? You think my house looks like a movie?
- Our house looks like a movie!
- You look like a movie star.
Bill gives me a lot of money, you know.
Of course, it's all that money you inherited, Bill.
That's right.
Hey, Selma...
Are you sure?
- Hello.
- Good morning.
Got the rent.
Oh, you always pay right on time.
Don't worry about Gene,
I'll get him to school.
Thank you. Thanks very much.
Remember your bag.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You're always so serious, Kathy.
Ah, again we start.
I don't think inside you're serious at all.
I don't know.
- Not always.
- Cvalda.
- Why do you call me that?
- It's like... someone who's...
- What?
- Dunno, big and happy.
Hey! I'm not that big.
Happy, I don't know.
You just need someone to pull it out.
# You're getting to be a habit with me... #
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yeah. But he's not happy.
How's she doing?
It's when she cannot keep up and she is going to faint.
She fainted.
- Please, be quiet.
- She doesn't see that well.
- I paid good money to see this.
- So did she.
I love it when they dance.
It's a musical, of course they're dancing!
- We know.
- You're so smart!
- Yes.
- Oh.
I think you made friends, Kathy.
Shh!
So?
So what did she say?
- What?
- What did she say?
She didn't say anything.
Are you trying to tell me something?
It's about the bike.
- The bike?
- Mmm. The bike.
Oh... I-I cannot give... give Gene a bike.
- Is this his idea?
- It is not.
- Gene?
- Yeah?
Did you ask them to come over?
No.
No, he doesn't know anything, Selma. Frankly.
- Why? Have I done something?
- No.
I haven't got the money.
I'm almost the only kid in class who doesn't have a bike.
I even know a boy who's got a scooter.
You all know I haven't got any money.
All the extra money I've got...
The times I save up -
I send it to Grandpa.
Come and have a look.
Your mother is only teasing.
Look what she's brought for you!
It's a bike!
- We can't accept that.
- It's not new.
I can't give him any expensive things
- not even for his birthday.
He's just gotta accept
I'm not that sort of mum.
I- I-I'm just not that kind of mother, G-Gene...
Can't you be that kind of a mother?
It's not exactly a scooter.
We'll see.
- Careful! Careful!
- Don't ride so fast!
Gene, bring it over here.
- He looks very happy.
- He does look happy.
Here he comes again.
Attention!
Bring it over here.
- Mom?
- OK.
Did you hear that?
- Did you say OK?
- Yeah.
- She said OK?
- Yeah.
- But promise to go to school.
- Yes, yes.
Every day... on time.
I didn't know you were such a good biker.
Rust and women are the same.
Rust and women are the same?
Yeah, I'm just saying...
- Your father said that.
- Yeah.
I didn't know what it meant.
He is so kind. Look at me...
He did all the work.
He's really kind.
Thank you, Jeff.
You're welcome.
Come in.
Something up, Bill?
No. I just couldn't sleep, that's all.
I have no money.
All the money that I inherited is...
It's gone.
And Linda...
Ah, Linda.
She just spends and spends.
And my salary is nowhere near enough.
I can't say no to her.
The bank is going to repossess the house... because I'm so far behind on the payments.
And I'm going to lose Linda.
I know it.
I know I am.
She loves you, Bill.
Ah, don't cry.
I shouldn't have told you.
- Don't worry. It's OK.
- I shouldn't have.
No, I think you've got... enough stuff...
Would it make you feel better if I told you a secret?
What could you tell me?
I'm going blind.
Not yet, but... soon.
Maybe sometime this year.
Blind?
It's not as bad as it sounds.
It's a...
It's a family thing.
- But blind?
- I've always known it.
From... from...
I was a little girl, I knew.
And you're OK?
Well, I came to America, because in America they can give
Gene an operation, you know?
Gene?
But, he doesn't know about it.
You mustn't tell him because then it could get worse.
I just have to save up money, you know. Enough money to...
Oh, I almost got it.
To, um... For the operation.
They can operate on Gene when he turns 13.
You made up that story about your father?
I never had a father.
I made up his name too.
That's why you put in all these hours and do everything you do.
For him? For his operation?
Well, it is my fault... I guess.
How is it your fault?
Because I knew he would... he would have bad eyes like me.
But I had him all the same.
You're very strong.
I'm not strong.
I've got little games I play when it goes really hard.
When I'm working in the factory... and the machines, they make these... rhythms.
And I just start dreaming and it all becomes music.
- You like movies, don't you?
- I love them.
- Yeah?
- I just love the musicals.
- When they're all tap-dancing?
- All of them tap-dancing.
All of them in those huge long lines.
I... Wouldn't you like to be in that line?
- Yeah.
- Just kicking your feet.
Yeah.
When they're like spiralling up the huge enormous wedding cakes.
- Yeah, yeah.
- To the top?
Isn't it annoying when they do the last song?
Why?
You know when it goes really big and the camera goes, like, out of the roof and you just know it's going to end.
I hate that. I really hate that.
I used to cheat when I was a little girl in Czechoslovakia.
I would leave the cinema just after the next to last song.
And the film would just go on forever.
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- It is lovely.
- Selma?
- Yeah?
Thank you for telling me your secret.
Thanks for telling me yours.
Mum's the word, right?
Mum?
- We don't tell anybody.
- Oh, yes.
I won't tell anyone.
Good night.
Thank you.
So, can I get you another?
Yeah, sure.
- How about a big one?
- How many is there in a big one?
Ten thousand.
I'll have a big one.
What's this guy's name again?
Who?
The old man - the guy we're carding these pins for?
Her father? I know. Oldrich, right?
Yeah.
Oldrich Novy.
He used to dance in Prague.
You commies make a big deal out of sharing everything.
Yeah, it's a good thing.
What are you doing here, if Czechoslovakia is so much better than the US of A?
No, Selma, no!
There are two plates.
It's all right.
You know what happens when you put two plates in, don't you?
Well, she didn't. It didn't..
You destroy the tool!
Takes a whole day to mend.
Never two plates, Selma!
You cheated the doctor.
You shouldn't be working here.
How dare you! How much can you see?
We could do it with our eyes closed.
No.
It's just because I was daydreaming.
Daydreaming? Dreaming about what?
- I just hear music.
- Come on, Selma. Music?
You could cut off your hand.
You have to watch out.
Promise me you'll stay awake.
I promise I will stop daydreaming.
No, you're not really, you repeat but...
I don't know why I bother that much.
Hi, Selma.
If you're not going with Kathy can I give you a lift?
I don't want a boyfriend.
I- I told you.
You're a really nice guy,
Jeff, but...
I just don't have time for a boyfriend.
Not right now.
I know.
If I wanted a boyfriend, it would be you, Jeff.
I just don't want one right now.
No problem, you know - on the back - to have the bike there.
Yeah.
Bye, Jeff.
I don't think it's very safe, riding the bike wearing glasses and all.
- Selma?
- Bye, Jeff.
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
- Hi, Selma.
- Hi, Bill.
- Heading home?
- Oh, yes.
Wanna throw that in the back?
That would be lovely. Yes, please.
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hey, did you see the truck?
No.
Like, driving like crazy.
- He what?
- He was driving like crazy.
Getting dirty.
Thank you.
- Bye, Jeff.
- Bye. Thank you, Bill.
- OK?
- OK.
If I could make the next payment,
I'd have a bit more time.
Yeah.
All I need is a loan.
Just be a month.
This money's Gene's.
- I'm sorry, Bill.
- I shouldn't have asked.
Don't worry, there's no harm in asking.
No, I shouldn't have asked.
Linda wants new couches.
Huh.
I could always shoot myself.
You mustn't say things like that.
It'd just... make things easier.
- You know that, Bill?
- No, Selma...
- You mustn't say those things.
- I'm kidding.
Hi, Selma. Come on in. Hi, Gene.
- Good morning.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.
- Can I see the gun?
- Yeah, go on.
- He's got a gun?
- Sure, he's a police officer.
Just didn't know he'd keep it here, in the house.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Keeps it in his desk.
Maybe I should pay more rent.
It's been the same since I've been here.
No, Selma. I won't hear it.
You keep your money, you need it more than we do.
Two boxes?
You are going to do two boxes at the same time now?
- Yeah.
- Selma, ten o'clock, then?
Yeah, ten o'clock.
What happens at ten o'clock?
I'm gonna do the night shift.
The night shift? You can hardly see enough to do your own shift.
It suits me fine.
It's just after drama class.
You are going to do that too?
I've had my fill of you.
Do what you want.
Go ahead! Break your neck.
You do your night shift.
But don't think
I'm going to come rescue you.
Selma.
Kathy split already.
I'm not looking for Kathy.
I was looking for you.
Just have to go to a drama rehearsal.
What do you say?
You always ride your bike.
You have it over there.
I... I left it at home. I thought it would be quicker if I walk.
How do you reckon that?
I'd just walk along the railroad tracks.
It's, a... short cut.
I don't understand, in musicals... why do they start to sing and dance all of a sudden?
I mean, I don't suddenly start to sing and dance.
No.
You're right, Jeff. You don't.
The last thing on the list is the bake sale.
Two Sundays away.
- Hi, Selma. Come on in.
- Hi.
I'm gonna introduce you to your understudy.
- My... my understudy?
- Yeah.
This girl, Suzan, whom Boris knows.
She's a good singer and dancer.
She'll learn your part too.
Because, say you get a cold and... you can't do it... then the show doesn't have to stop. OK?
Suzan - Selma. Selma - Suzan.
Ah... Could you take off your glasses?
I think we'll do the part without glasses.
Next Sunday you will see both Marias.
I mean Selma will do the role, but
I'll have you read too. All right?
It's your first night shift, right?
While this is being pressed, you'll be cutting here.
That means you'll be in charge of two machines.
You have to feed Sarah over there, right?
This palette must never be empty.
- Is it always so dark in here?
- What?
It's exactly the same as the daytime.
But you have to work a little faster.
- That's what we're paid for. OK?
- Thank you.
Excuse me. You have to work, you know, a little faster.
OK.
What are you doing here?
What do you think?
I didn't put you down for the night shift, Kathy.
Run along, Norman.
I'm on my own time now.
How I spend it is my own business.
- Night, ladies!
- Good night.
Faster. A little faster.
I like it better when you dance.
You should dance more, Cvalda.
I will when there is music.
# Clatter, crash, clack
# Racket, bang, thump
# Rattle, clang, crack
# Thud, whack, bam...
# Clatter, crash, clack
# Racket, bang, slam
# Rattle, clang, crack, thud, whack, bam
- # It's music
- Dance, dance
- # Now dance
- Dance, dance
# Listen, Cvalda
# You're the dancer
# You've got the sparkle
# In your eyes
# Look
# At
# Me
# And transcend...
# Clatter, crash, clack
# Racket, bang, thump
# Rattle, clang, crash, splash, whack, bam...
# The clatter machines
# They greet you and say...
# We tap out a rhythm
# And sweep you away
# A clatter machine
# What a magical sound
# A room full of noises
# That spins you around
# Darling, Selma, look who's dancing
# Faster than a shooting star
# Cvalda's here
# Dance... dance
# Cvalda's here
# Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
# Clatter, crash, clack, racket, bang, thump
# Racket, clang, crack, thud, whack, bam
# Clatter, crash, clack, racket, bang, thump
# Rattle, clang, crack, thud, whack, bam...
# The clatter machines
# They greet you and say
# Tap out a rhythm
# And sweep you away
# A clatter machine
# What a magical sound
# A room full of noises
# That spins us around
# That spins us... #
Selma!
Stop it you've cut yourself!
Get away from the machine. Henry!
Oh, Jeff is here.
- Hello, Jeff.
- Hi, Kathy.
Do you live here?
She might say yes to a ride when it's this late.
Maybe Kathy... wants a ride.
No, it's all right.
What's that on your hand?
- She cut her...
- Cut my finger.
- It's going to be all right.
- The plates are sharp.
- Good night.
- Careful.
I think I found a solution to my problem.
That makes me really happy.
It's nothing special.
But I've made up my mind
I'm gonna tell Linda.
I mean, after all, she loves me, and...
We'll just work it out together.
That sounds like a really good idea, Bill.
Sorry. I'll let you get to bed.
I guess I'm kinda tired.
Thanks, Bill.
- Good night, Selma.
- Good night, Bill.
Bill?
What's happening now?
Here we go.
Selma, are you ready?
# So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye
# I hate to go and leave this pretty sight... #
And...
You're on.
Cut, cut.
Stop, stop, please.
This is
Selma's entrance, OK? Yeah?
OK, Paul, please.
#.. an absurd little bird... #
How far do you think it is?
I don't know.
# So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye... #
And...
Kathy, what are you doing?
This is Maria's entrance.
Yes, I'm sorry. It's my mistake.
Please, I don't have all night.
- Six steps.
- OK.
Good.
OK, I'm thinking maybe, Selma, you could take a little circle around Boris on this next part.
Unless you have something else you want to suggest.
I'm open.
OK?
- Samuel?
- Yes?
I need to talk to you.
If it's about the drummer,
I have been looking everywhere...
- I promised you...
- It's not about the drummer.
- Just a quick word.
- Do you wanna go outside?
- Yeah.
- OK.
# And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
# Is popping out to say cuckoo
I'm... I'm not gonna play Maria.
What?
My heart just isn't in this, like, I shouldn't be wasting my time on something... that isn't that important, really.
I've been watching Suzan and she's... she's great.
She's... she's a much better dancer than I am.
Suzan's terrific,
I'm not denying that.
But, you... I thought you lived for musicals.
So you've been pretending the whole time?
Yes, I've just been pretending.
I don't know what else...
Everything's cast now.
Yeah.
The only part that's left is the old nun.
I don't think you'd want that part. There's no dancing.
She's quite serious, then?
She's serious, yeah.
It's important for the part.
And not dancing, really. No.
I could put a little dancing in there.
You think so?
I didn't have it in mind.
You can have your tapping.
She could be just a little humorous once in a while.
Even though she's a nun.
You'll always be my perfect Maria.
Where are all the hairpins today?
I left them at home.
And she won't be playing Maria.
What will I do if I can't bawl you out for learning your lines on company time?
One... two... three!
What kind of a joke is that?
- I need a word with you.
- We're talking now.
All right. Come on.
Please, sit down.
We were off for the whole day.
Everything stops when the machine breaks, you know that.
I- I can do my job just fine if I stick to the day shift.
This won't happen again.
I- I daydream too much.
I- I decided to quit.
I guess, then, I forgot.
I've been ordered to let you go, Selma.
You don't have to pay for the machine you broke. I got them to agree.
Thanks, Norman.
This is your, ah... salary.
And you know, ah... maybe we can find you something away from the machines... where your eyesight wouldn't matter so much.
- Not right away.
- That's very kind.
But, um, I'll be OK.
I- I really will.
- Thanks, Norman.
- Thank you, Selma.
Thank you.
What is she going to do now?!
Did you ever think about that?!
Don't worry, Kathy, really.
I'm going to be fine.
Has anybody seen Jeff today?
He's usually here early, Selma.
But not this early.
That's a shame.
Selma!
Selma.
I could give you a lift if you want.
I- I will need a lift... later.
I need to do something important at, ah... three.
You need to get your truck, then, don't you?
Yeah.
Train's coming.
Get off the track, Jeff.
You have to be careful.
Stick to the side.
You can't see, can you?
What is there to see?
# I've seen it all
# I have seen the trees
# I have seen the willow leaves
# Dancing in the breeze
# I've see a man killed by his best friend
# And lives that were over before they were spent
# I've seen what I was
# And I know what I'll be
# I've seen it all - there is no more to see
# You haven't seen elephants, kings or Peru
# I'm happy to say
I have better to do
# What about China?
# Have you seen the Great Wall?
# All walls are great if their roof doesn't fall
# And the man you will marry
# The home you will share?
# To be honest, I really don't care
# You've never been to Niagara Falls
# I have seen water
# It's water, that's all
# The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State
# My pulse was as high on my very first date
# Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair
# To be honest, I really don't care
# I've seen it all
# I have seen the dark
# I have seen the brightness in one little spark
# I have seen what I choose and seen what I need
# And that is enough, to want more would be greed
# I've seen what I was
# And I know what I'll be
# I've seen it all - there is no more to see
# You've seen it all and all you have seen
# You can always review on your own little screen
# The light and the dark, the big and the small
# Just keep in mind you need no more at all
# You've seen what you were and know what you'll be
# You've seen it all, there is no more to see #
You can't see, can you?
See you at three.
I can see.
Gene hasn't come back yet.
I need to talk to Bill.
He decided to take the day off to go to the bank for his box.
Is he... is he upstairs?
I know everything, Selma.
Bill told me.
I want you to move out.
I don't understand. What do you know?
That you came on to him.
That you asked him into the trailer, but he turned you down.
You've got nothing to say for yourself?!
No. I want to talk to Bill.
Hi, Bill.
Linda saw me go up to the, um... up to the trailer.
I told her it was you who wanted to...
That you'd... That you'd fallen in love with me.
I know. She told me.
And what did you tell her?
Nothing.
You didn't tell her I was lying?
Mum's the word, right?
Linda told me you went to the bank.
I went to the bank to ask for more time.
But I couldn't do it and I brought the box home instead.
Linda always gets so proud when she sees me sitting in here with it.
But you've put my money in it, haven't you?
To make it look like it's yours.
But it's my money, Bill.
I'm gonna have to take it.
You can have it back.
Y- You can... you can have it back in a month.
But I can't do that, Bill.
Selma...
I- I've decided to... to pay the doctor this afternoon.
I can't save up more money.
That's over now.
Gene doesn't even turn thirteen until after Christmas.
There was $2,026 and ten cents in the tin.
I can't count it now, but I trust you.
And it's thirty dollars
I got today... which makes it...
2,056... ten cents.
It's not enough... but it'll have to do.
- Selma.
- Bye, Bill.
Selma.
Selma, stop.
I'm pointing my gun at you, Selma.
I don't believe you.
You're just trying to scare me.
I can't see a gun.
Just feel this.
Feel this. Feel it. Feel it!
Do you believe I have the gun?
I believe you. But it's my money.
No, it's my money.
It's the money I had in MY box and you're trying to steal it from me.
Selma! Selma!
SELMA! STOP! SELMA, STOP!
LINDA! LINDA! LINDA!
What's the matter, Bill?
She was trying to steal our money.
She knew I had the gun in my drawer and she...
Is that why you wanted him?
For the money?
Run to the car and get my handcuffs.
Go get the handcuffs.
Give me the money.
Where should I go?
Gimme the money. Give me...
No! No! No!
You shot me.
I'm gonna...
No, no, Selma, you did the right thing.
I should have done it myself.
Kill me.
Just kill me.
Be my friend and show some mercy, please, and just kill me.
You handcuffs aren't in the car.
Show some mercy, Selma, and just...
Linda, run. Run up to Miller's farm.
Call the station and tell them to hurry.
RUN! GET UP THERE!
Go to Miller's farm!
If you want the money...
You're going to have to kill me.
Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me.
I'm not letting go.
No.
Just shoot me. Just shoot me.
Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!
Can't you just stand up and pull the goddamn trigger!
I want to take my money.

Selma?
Jeff.
What are you doing here?
Is it already three?
Well, not really.
But, hell, I'm always early.
You cut yourself again.
There's some blood on your blouse.
Strange.
I couldn't feel it at all.
Selma?
We're here now.
By the bus stop?
Yeah, the bus stop.
It's over there.
And the lake is here.
Promise me that you won't follow me. Promise.
Yeah, I promise.
I would like to pay for the operation now.
2,056 dollars and ten cents.
I know it's not quite what you told me, but...
But it's all I could get together.
What last name shall I put on the receipt?
Oh, I don't need a receipt,
I really don't.
I have to know the name of your son for when he comes in for his operation.
Novy.
He will come and he will say that his name is Novy.
And then you will know... that he's been paid for.
Novy?
Like Oldrich Novy, the tap dancer?
It is strange, isn't it?
He never really made it over here, did he?
I saw his films when I was a kid.
He was in the first musical
I ever saw.
Same here.
Selma?
It's Tuesday night.
What about your rehearsal?
Yeah, I guess...
You wanna go?
Yeah.
And maybe put your arm around her and a little bit of...
Hi, Selma.
Hi, Samuel.
We weren't sure you'd show up, actually.
Sure I show up.
Nice to see you. Be right back.
OK.
Uh...
OK, I think you could try it one more time for me.
But I should... I should be going now. Gene might wonder where I am.
Jeff, he hasn't seen me all day.
I think we could do your scene.
Let's do the tapping scene. OK?
We haven't done it in weeks.
While you're here, we might as well take advantage of the time. Please?
Let's do the tapping scene.
Let me have the nuns up there.
Imagi... You do Selma's part for her for now, all right?
- Like it?
- Yes.
We haven't done it for a while.
Remember that part we did where you, uh, you come to the convent gate?
To say goodbye to Maria.
I should leave, Jeff.
- What?
- Gene is probably worried now.
I haven't seen him all day.
I'm sorry, Samuel, but...
Betty, come here a second.
The drummer you wanted, remember?
I found somebody. She's fantastic.
She's here for the first time.
Please meet her. This is Selma.
- Hi, Betty. You play the drums?
- Yeah.
Tell her how long you've been studying.
Two years.
She's wonderful. You've gotta stay and enjoy this. You've...
I have an idea. Let's do the finale.
I just remembered, you hate finales.
No finale. I've a better idea.
"Climb Every Mountain", part one.
# Climb every mountain
# Ford every stream
Like Indians!
# Follow every rainbow
# Till you find your dream #
# Why do I love it so much?
# What kind of magic is this?
# How come I can't help adore it?
# It's just another musical
# No one minds at all
# If I'm having a ball
# Cos this is a musical
# And there's always someone to catch me
# There's always someone to catch me
# There's always someone to catch me
# There's always someone to catch me
# When you fall #
The State will show... that the defendant has not only perpetrated the most callous and well-planned homicide in recent memory, but is also a fundamentally selfish individual who cynically hides behind a handicap, devoid of sympathy for anybody but herself.
This woman found trust and friendship when she sought refuge in our country.
And the evidence will show that she has repaid such kindness with betrayal, robbery and murder, inflicted upon the VERY people who opened their homes and hearts to her.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the evidence will prove that she herself did not show that mercy she will ask of us.
Is this the bag here, Detective?
Uh...
Yes, the very same.
Houston's blood was all over it.
Shortly before the homicide
I had a check-up on her vision and I found that she was myopic.
That's near-sighted.
Near-sighted, but she COULD see.
Yes.
She said communism was better for human beings.
She had nothing but contempt for our great country and...
Apart from its musicals. She said the American ones were better.
So...
The defendant preferred
Hollywood to Vladivostok.
I suppose that's an acknowledgement of sorts.
She just asked many times about the money.
She wanted to know where it was.
That's right.
- She asked about the gun?
- Yes, she did.
She wanted to know where it was kept?
That's right.
Bill was lying on the floor... and he was wounded and...
Um...
He was pleading for his life.
Yes.
"I beg you. I beg you. I beg you. "
You showed him no mercy, Selma.
You should have no mercy either.
Would you state your name for the record, please.
Selma Jezkova.
And Bill and Linda Houston... were your friends. Is that right?
Yeah.
In fact you lived in a trailer on their property.
Yeah.
And didn't they also take care of your young son when you were at work?
Yeah.
They bought him a birthday present recently.
Is that right?
Yeah, they got him a bike.
Right.
Your sight was poor, you claim - contrary to the expert testimony we received.
But you saw well enough to inflict 34 wounds on Bill Houston.
So why did you kill him, actually?
If I may be so bold to ask.
He asked me to.
He did?
How intriguing.
A man with a fine career, some wealth and a happy marriage?
Why would this Bill Houston ask you to kill him?
I promised not to say.
Oh! That clears things up immensely
You promised you wouldn't say.
In that case we'll just have to take your word for it that the money you stole was yours despite the fact that Bill
Houston's savings also disappeared so mysteriously that same day.
Just, ah...
Just where did you get your money?
Well...
I'd been saving up.
I suppose you could call it that.
What were these savings to be used for?
You never bought your son so much as a birthday present, as we've heard.
Um...
Yes?
My... my father... in Czechoslovakia.
Your father.
And what, pray tell, is his name?
My... my father is...
Oldrich Novy.
So...
We're meant to believe that you killed Bill Houston by inflicting 34 wounds on him because he asked you to?
Just as we're meant to believe that you were blind when you did it.
As we're meant to believe that it was your savings you stole from him.
Just as we're meant to believe you sent all you had to your father back home.
A man by the name of Oldrich Novy.
Is that right?
Yes.
Thank you, Miss Jezkova.
Ladies and gentlemen, you've now heard from the defendant's lips.
You must believe her.
Just as you must believe her when she claims her father's name is Oldrich Novy.
Your Honour, at this time the State calls to the witness stand...
Oldrich Novy.
Please state your full name.
My name is Oldrich Novy.
And you used to live in Czechoslovakia.
That is right. I live now in California, as you know.
Right. That's where we found you.
What exactly is your relationship to the defendant?
I do not know her.
You don't know her?
So... you have not received money from her?
Money, that... that she says was so dearly earned?
No, I have not.
Perhaps you're not her father, then.
- No, I am not.
- No.
Well, if this relationship was made up by the defendant then can you think of any way she might know your name?
I was once well-known in Czechoslovakia because of my profession.
Yes, and Mr Novy, what is your profession?
Maybe that can give us a clue to why - why this somewhat romantic, certainly communistic woman who worships Fred Astaire, but not his country - why she might have lied and misused your name - to make everybody think all her money was spent on a poor father and not her own vanity?
- What do you do?
- I was an actor. I made films.
They were musicals.
# Why do I love you so much?
# What kind of magic is there?
# How come I can't help adore you?
# You were in a musical
# I didn't mind it at all
# That you were having a ball
# At my musical
# And I was always there to catch you
# You were always there to catch me
# You were always there to catch me
# You were always there to catch me
# When I'd fall
# Say it again
# I don't mind it at all
# If you're having a ball
# This is your musical
# I'll always be there to catch you
# You will always be there to catch me
# I'll always be there to catch you
# You will always be there to catch me
# We'll always be there to catch you
# We'll always be there to catch you
# We'll always be there to catch you
# We'll always be there to catch you
# When I fall #
Will the court please rise?
The honourable
Judge AD Mantle presiding.
Have you reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honour.
Will the defendant please rise?
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Selma Jezkova, guilty of murder in the first degree and hereby sentence her to death.
Is this the verdict of this jury?
You fully understand that it must be unanimous?
We do, Your Honour.
Selma Jezkova... you are hereby sentenced to be taken from this place and confined in the state penitentiary until such time as you shall be executed by being hanged by the neck, until you are dead.
This court is adjourned.
All rise.
I just heard about the... the Supreme Court decision.
Yeah, I... I just want to talk practical stuff.
On Gene's birthday... he will receive a letter.
And it's so important, Kathy, that he reads it very carefully.
I need you to take care of that for me.
Because I'm not going to be there when he gets it.
He should not be afraid, because there's nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Gene wants to see you so badly.
Won't you let him? Please.
There's nothing for him to see.
He's got you now, Kathy.
And there's one more thing.
He has to call himself Novy.
That's very important.
- All right. Time's up, Selma.
- I know it sounds foolish.
Sorry I didn't tell you before about this, I didn't dare to because they would ruin everything.
But why does he have to call himself Novy?
Stop asking those questions, Cvalda.
Please, let me tell Gene hello, from you to him.
No.
I know you love your son very much.
I love him very much.
Got a boy of my own back home.
You never told me that.
- Good night, Brenda.
- Good night.
Say hi to your son from me.
Thank you, Selma.
Can I help you?
Did you once have a patient called...
Jezkova?
Selma Jezkova?
Well, if it wasn't too long ago,
I can check my records.
Jez... Jez... Jez...
Sorry, there's no one here by that name.
What about Novy?
- I have good news for you.
- What's that?
We found a new lawyer and he is going to get your case reopened.
He says your lawyer was incompetent.
W- what do you mean?
Well, the case is going to be reopened.
You won't get the death sentence.
- Is that true?
- Yes. New information has turned up.
What information?
We know the whole story, Selma.
Why didn't you tell us anything?
You know, about... about the money for Gene's operation.
How did you find out?
Well, Jeff talked to the doctor.
Does... does Gene know?
Have you told Gene?
No. No, I didn't. But you've got a much better case now.
That's very important, Kathy.
His eyes might get worse from worrying.
And then the operation won't work.
Yes, Selma, but don't you see, it would help you if they knew that you were trying to save your son from going blind.
The lawyer will come in two weeks' time.
Kathy, by then... You know they're hanging me in one week.
We know, but he says you can apply for a stay.
Most cases get one the first time.
Well, you can smile.
- Selma?
- Yeah... It's just too much for me.
I thought I was strong.
I just can't take it, Kathy.
Apply for a stay.
What if they don't phone?
Ah, well, you'll be transferred to the other... cell block at some point tomorrow.
That's the cell block where they hang people?
Yeah, that's where they... spend the last day.
And then they do their 107 steps that's from that room... to the gallows, isn't it?
That's what they say, Selma, but...
Look, it...
You're gonna get your stay.
Why don't you try to think of somethin' nice, all right?
It's just so quiet here.
What's that got to do with it, Selma?
You know, when I used to work in the factory,
I used to dream that I was in a musical.
Because in a musical nothing dreadful ever happens.
But it's so quiet here.
Don't the prisoners march or something?
March? No. No, they don't... they don't... There's not...
There's not much noise around here, Selma, I know.
But later they turn on the radio.
No, no, no. There's no...
They don't allow radio in the isolation block, Selma.
But I've been listening to the ventilation shaft.
I hear sometimes people singing there, like... hymns, or...
It's not against the rules to listen, is it?
No.
I wonder if... if maybe you're hearing the singing coming from the chapel.
Yeah?
- Maybe you'll even get a sermon.
- Yeah?
# Raindrops... and roses
# And whiskers on kittens... #
# Raindrops and roses and whiskers on kittens... #
# Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens
# Brown paper packages tied up with string... #
# These are the few of my favourite things... #
# Cream-coloured ponies

Selma.
Selma.
You got your stay.
You got the stay.
I'm so happy for you.
I'm your new legal counsel.
My name is Luke, OK?
Hi, Luke.
I'm quite sure I can get your sentence commuted.
All I need is a signature stating you want the case reopened.
Then I can get the paperwork ready by tomorrow.
There are things your other lawyer didn't do that I'm going to do.
A lot of ground wasn't covered that I'm going to cover.
The fact you were fighting for your boy is something we can really milk.
And I have some experience in cases like this, so...
That's what the attorney before said.
Oh, yeah.
You see, he was appointed by the court.
And you don't get the best legal counsel that way.
You were not appointed by the court.
I'm not, no.
You're gonna have to pay me.
- But... not to worry.
- Yeah.
That's been taken care of.
I made a deal with your lady friend.
- Deal?
- Yeah, in regard to my fee.
I'm going to accept the amount that she said she could raise.
How much... How much was it?
I can tell you precisely because I received an envelope.
- It was, ah... $2,000...
- $2,056 and 10 cents?
That's it, precisely.
Now... ah...
There's something here...
Uh... I'd like to... just sort of go over our tactics.
I have a couple of questions to ask you.
If he doesn't have the operation next month it'll be too late!
He'll never be able to see!
This is what it's all about.
So he can see his grandchildren...
- Let me tell you...
- It's the only thing that matters!
You don't understand, Kathy.
It's plain stupidity to waste that kind of money on a blind woman in jail.
But he needs his mother!
No matter where!
You don't understand!
He needs his eyes.
- He needs his mother.
- NO!
- Yes, alive...
- NO!
Listen to reason for once, Selma.
- Selma...
- I listen to my heart.
I will go to the police, I will tell them you stole the money from Bill.
I will say that.
I will tell them that.
That you stole it from Bill.
Then you'll never see it again.
They will be gone for good.
No parachute. No mother. Nothing!
You can have your money back.
I just want to make sure you fully comprehend what this means - this decision.
- Yeah.
- You realise what will happen?
Yeah. I've already asked for no more stays.
Once this starts there's no stopping it, do you understand?
Yeah.
I'm prepared.
Gene says thank you.
Thanks for what?
Oh, some comic book on his birthday.
You can't buy him presents and say it's from me.
You're to stop doing that, Jeff.
Maybe you can just... phone him.
Just say, you know... something to him.
No, that's... That's not a good idea.
He wants to be the one... who's allowed to be there when it happens.
But I... And then they told him he's too young.
Who put that crazy idea in his head anyway?
I don't want him to be there.
I'd be there if you would...
And Kathy?
You know Kathy, she's...
She's still angry.
If you think you can take it...
I would love you to be there.
Don't cry, Jeff.
Jeff, don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.
Jeff?
Why did you have him?
You knew he would have the same disease as you.
I just wanted to hold a little baby... in my arms.
I love you.
It's time, Selma.
OK?
OK.

{78988}{79009}I'm enrolling you...
{79012}{79049}in the applied percussion course.
{79052}{79105}Man, that gives me 5 classes.
{79107}{79154}Damn right it gives you 5 classes...
{79157}{79183}and it ought to be 1 0...
{79186}{79227}especially if you plan|on getting back on the line...
{79230}{79279}anytime soon.
{79282}{79322}What you mean|getting back on the line?
{79325}{79384}I mean now you're a P-4.
{79386}{79435}If you cannot read music...
{79437}{79478}you cannot be on my field.
{79481}{79525}Man, you can't take me off the line.
{79528}{79561}I'm the best drummer you got.
{79564}{79608}Ain't can't no class teach me|how to do me.
{79610}{79637}Excuse me?
{79640}{79693}Doing me is what got me down here|in the first place.
{79695}{79770}No, lying...
{79773}{79845}is what got you down here.
{79848}{79895}And if you don't have|the honor and discipline...
{79898}{79961}to learn your craft...
{79963}{80027}then quite frankly, Devon,|you don't deserve to be here.
{80176}{80253}Laila:|I don't get you sometimes.
{80286}{80346}If music is what you love...
{80349}{80420}why wouldn't you go to class?
{80458}{80516}You love dance, right?
{80518}{80564}Why you ain't studying that?
{80643}{80704}My parents are paying|for my education.
{80752}{80821}And to them...
{80824}{80881}dancing's not a real major.
{80926}{80997}Well, is it real to you?
{81000}{81101}Because when I see you|doing your thing out on the field,
{81104}{81149}you look happy.
{81152}{81208}That seems real to me.
{81342}{81388}It's not always|about doing what you love...
{81390}{81428}all the time, Devon.
{81475}{81581}See, I don't even get that, like,|so why you even come to A&T?
{81584}{81668}I always knew I'd be here.
{81670}{81716}Both my parents went to A&T.
{81718}{81794}My mom's a Sigma Phi Alpha|my dad's the all-American.
{81797}{81873}Just--ohh.|You'll meet them at homecoming.

{107092}{107145}about ''that hoodlum on the field|that started the fight,''
{107148}{107169}and I just...
{107172}{107224}Devon, I'm--I'm sorry.
{107226}{107295}It ain't about your parents.
{107297}{107351}You left me hanging.
{107393}{107434}You know how that feels?
{107461}{107499}No?
{107501}{107537}Let me show you.
{107653}{107679}Sean: Dr. Lee?

{107737}{107769}I just wanted to catch you|before rehearsal.
{107772}{107824}I was thinkin'|that instead of promoting...
{107826}{107855}a P-2 to replace Devon...
{107857}{107929}we might just keep|the snare line at 9.
{107931}{108002}And how long have you|been thinking that?
{108005}{108056}Just this mornin'.
{108059}{108119}Are you sure?
{108121}{108194}I thought maybe it was the day|you showed us all he couldn't read...
{108197}{108268}or maybe it was the night|he took your solo.
{108271}{108306}I don't know.
{108331}{108380}But since you heard him play...
{108382}{108501}you decided that the line|or perhaps maybe just you...
{108503}{108543}would be better off|without him.
{108647}{108703}Remember|when I first made you section leader?
{108772}{108825}You were sweatin' bullets,|wondering how you could lead...
{108828}{108917}this loud, passionate group|of your peers...
{108920}{108981}and I said you would be fine.
{108984}{109031}Remember why?
{109061}{109098}You said I loved|the sound of the line...
{109101}{109135}more than the sound|of my own drum.
{109137}{109252}Yes, and you've lost sight of that...
{109254}{109413}and that's OK because we all|lose sight of things sometimes.
{109416}{109485}But if you don't get it together,|Mr. Taylor...
{109488}{109523}you're gonna have a difficult time...
{109525}{109616}leading the senate|whether Devon is on it or not.
{109953}{109992}Mr. Wade:|Now I put in a word with Mr. Hill...
{109995}{110040}to get you some financial aid|next year...
{110042}{110092}hook you up with a part-time job|this summer...
{110095}{110126}put some money in your pocket.
{110129}{110184}You know you need some money, hmm?|Hmm?

{110313}{110360}Sit up in the skybox with us.
{110362}{110406}You can see the honeys|way good up there.
{110409}{110468}Oh, yeah!|Most def.
{110509}{110547}So now, what can you tell me?
{110549}{110636}What you mean, what can I tell you?
{110639}{110679}What you mean?|What do I mean?
{110681}{110762}Oh, I know Dr. Lee is workin' on|somethin' big for the Classic.

To meet the Lord.
Oh, I’m looking for that stone
That stone, that
Flew down the mountain
I’m looking for that stone that came...
Oh, alleluia
I’m looking for that stone, yes, I am
Flew down the mountain
And it's coming all the way down
-Yes, it is
-Coming down
Coming down... to the demon town, yeah, girl
We're near it, the 21st Century
Oh, yeah, and the Lord could come at any time
At any time
- In a second
-A second

-A moment
 In a twinkle of an eye
Eye
Going to my home up, up in the sky
Oh, I’m looking for that stone, yes, I am
Hewn off the mountain
I’m looking for that stone
Rolling down to earth
I’ve got to find my stone, yes, I have
Hewn off the mountain

-To redeem...
Yes, it is
...a dying world
-A dying world.
-World!
Bless you.
Oh, my goodness, there she goes again.
Wouldn't be a normal Sunday if Faye didn't get slain in the spirit.
Uh-huh.
Oh, Maryann.
Pastor.
This boy is growing like a weed.
You must be feeding him fertilizer.
And his teachers say he's the smartest in his class.
There she is.
Hold her, Reverend.
The nerve.
Standing in the house of God and all the while singing the devil's music.
Paulina, what's this all about?
I found this down at Robinson's store.
It's Maryann, singing that R&B sex music.
Oh. Oh, uh, uh, uh, Maryann. Maryann!
What you got to say about all this?
I finally got my chance to become a singer.
I didn't think anything was wrong.
Reverend, the church bylaws clearly state that no member shall partake of fornication,
Amen.
Gambling.
Amen.
And drinking, which is all going on down at that juke joint where she sings.
Just take a look at this.
“Do it to me again.”
My, my, my, my, my.
Now, we all know what “it” means.
Paulina.
I’m surprised you'd even remember what “it” is. and besides, what were you doing down at the record store looking through
“the devil's music”?
I got the Lord on my side with this one.
Paulina, you need to hush.
Tell her, honey.
Because this girl ain't doing nothing to hurt nobody.
Amen, sister Sally.
Need I remind you of the church motto?
Tell her, sister!
“Beware of brief delight and lasting shame.”
That must be them kids on that organ again.
I'm-I'm gonna go.
Stop stalling, Paul.
You know the church rules.
-You're supposed to handle this.
-Paulina,
I’m the pastor here.
Leave it to me, please?
You do your job, boy, or I’m going to go and get Mama.
Now, you know you're supposed to call me “reverend” around here.
I’m going to handle this my way, okay?
Now, Maryann.
It’s like this.
It’s like she says.
You stop singing that secular music, or you're going to have to leave the choir.
I’m sorry.
It’s your pick.
Make up your mind, child.
Think about what you're doing, sister.
Wave good-bye to Aunt Sally.
Darrin, here's that market research you wanted, and I know you're real busy, but there's something you should know.
Yes... I’m going to blow them away.
I’m a player.
I’m in the zone.
Corner office, huge window.
Take care of these credit card bills for me.
All right.
Use this one to pay off this one, okay?
-Okay.
-And, uh, do a balance transfer from-- oh, excuse me-- from here to here for that one, all right, and cover this one with that one.
So, what were you trying to say earlier?
There's a private investigator over there looking for you.
Why?
Who's trying to find me?
I’m double checking-- is Darrin Hill around?
What did he say?
Did you tell him anything?
Does he know what I look like?
No. Chill.
I told him you're not in,
-so he's leaving a message.
-Uh, tell him I’m out of town.
I did.
Good.
Time to climb the corporate ladder.
By our projections, this plan will increase the market shares of Lincoln & Gerald Liquors by a whopping eight percent in as little as two years.
We were hoping to see faster growth.
We can give them double digit growth.
As I said, it is the company position that eight percent growth should be the goal.
-Now...
-If there's a different opinion that'll lead to better growth, we want to hear it.
Now let me ask you which demographic consumes the most malt liquor?
Go ahead, you can say it.
Black people.
There you go.
Very good.
However, I noticed in your company report that you don't have a malt liquor division.
I noticed that, too.
I propose a new ad campaign for a malt liquor division that maximizes exposure in the African-American market.
Place positive images of your product in areas where black people live.
By tapping into the buying power of this consumer base, you'll pass single-digit growth faster than a pro athlete can get his criminal charges dropped.
That, my friends, is not thinking outside the box.
That's realizing there is no box.
Now, those are the kind of ideas we hired this company for.
Where have you been hiding this one, Fairchild?
He's one of our junior executives.
This man needs to be on the team.
I mean, he was a junior executive... before today.
Congratulations.
You've just been promoted.
Thank you, sir.
Where'd you learn that kind of thinking?
-Yale.
-Oh, I’m a Princeton man myself, but I see we let one get away.
Okay, well, we better leave and let them get started on this interesting idea.
Well, I guess I’ll be giving you a corner office with a view.
Thank you, sir.
Cigar?
Well, this is France's finest.
I first encountered it growing up in Monte Carlo.
Please, you're a New York boy if I ever saw one.
No, I lived there until I was 1 7.
Wow, I have never met a brother who grew up in Europe before.
Actually, I was born in South America.
Where?
Home Video.
That's in Peru, right?
Venezuela.
My father was in oil.
You sound so American.
Well, I went to prep school here... at Andover.
Money was no object.
-Cool.
-Mr. Hill,
I’m afraid your credit card has been declined.
R-Right, that was, uh, not activated yet.
Okay. Uh... try this one.
Darrin, Mr. Fairchild wants to see you first thing in the morning.
Great.
Great, great, great.
As you can see, there is nothing in my refrigerator but water, water and wine.
This is the dining room.
We don't spend a lot of time in here so it looks very nice and well-set.
Like this chandelier-- it's not just a normal chandelier.
It’s just kind of funky and fun.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Darrin.
What I have to say is very difficult.
We have a, uh... situation.
A situation that involves deception, a lack of candor, and an unbridled passion to get what one wants at any cost.
I think you know what I’m referring to.
Of course, sir, company policy.
No, no, no... well, yes, of course it is, but in this case it's something more personal.
Darrin, you're fired.
Fired?
But why?
A representative of Lincoln & Gerald has an annoying habit of checking up on things.
It seems that you were thrown out of Yale when it was discovered you faked your high school diploma from Andover.
How long did you think it would take before your deception caught up with you?
But, sir,
I’ve been doing such good work.
Mr. Hill, we cannot be represented by people who tell lies.
We're in advertising.
You obtained this job under false pretenses, and now you've caused the firm great embarrassment in front of important clients.
I’m sorry.
I have to let you go.
You're good, you're smart, but you broke the Eleventh Commandment--
“Thou shalt not get caught.”
Now...
Sir, please, you're making a big mistake.
I’m here for you.
I’m smart, I’m ambitious...
Have your things out of here in half an hour.
I’m disappointed in you.
I expected more from a congressman's son.
Darrin Hill?
Yes.
You've been a tough one to track down, Mr. Hill.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this is for you.
What is it? A subpoena?
Summons?
Ploy to distract me while you repo my stuff?
Sure, those are fun, but no.
Oh, my Aunt Sally died.
“We request your presence at the funeral and reading of the will.”
Oh...
The funeral is tomorrow.
Maybe you should ask your boss for some time off.
You know you just cut a brother, right?
Oh.
Hurts when you do that, man.
Sorry.
Come on, baby.
Make me happy.
Cash advance.
Be a winner.
Be a winner.
Whoo-hoo!
Thank you, Bank of Piscataway.
Heaven only knows
How much I love you, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Heaven's in your eyes...
Baby, please
Please don't take your love from me
I am yours forevermore
Till eternity
Silently
Listen to the words
I say
Now I’m not talking just for play
Listen to me, please...
I told you kids ain't got no business playing a man's game.
Funny, that's the same thing someone told me... oh... two hours ago.
Don't you know
Don't you know, don't you know
Love is all I need
'Cause I love you and I need you
Yes, I want you, gotta have you
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
Spent my whole life
On the way to someplace else
Thinking right around the bend
I might find myself
But the search goes on
I won't quit till I get home.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I get something to eat around here?
Reed?
Coming right up.
Better make that to go.
I need a taxi.
Reed's only got two hands.
Wait until he fixes your dinner.
Right.
No signal.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh!
You must be Darrin.
Damn, word, get low.
What's up?
Darrin, I’m Lucius, man,
I’m your welcome committee.
Oh, well, how'd you know I was here?
Man, word travels fast, and Aunt Sally always bragged she had a successful nephew from New York.
Let me get your stuff, man.
Really?
Come on.
Oh.
Monte Carlo didn't change, man.
It used to be a one-horse town.
What, did the horse die?
No, see, see, now you'll see, you'll see, you'll see.
We got everything to offer that a big city does.
Oh.
I’m happy to have another player in town, man.
I’ve got tired of holding this down solo.
Hey, man, reach over there and pull this handle from the inside.
It only open from the inside.
Okay.
-Appreciate that.
-Sure.
So you came by train.
That's cool.
I was trying to meet the bus.
Going to the Canaan Inn.
Okay, that-that Canaan Inn, that's straight down this road about five minutes.
Oh. Whoa.
Your door won't open, and mine won't stay shut.
But it opens.
Oh.
Yes, it opens.
The next hour of programming is brought to you by
Mitchell's Funeral Home, where the caskets are so nice, you'll wish you were dead.
Now for the news.
Like to give a shout out to Darrin Hill, in town for Sally's funeral.
Welcome home, little Darrin.
That's news?
I’ll be right back with traffic.
There is no traffic.
There is no traffic.
This is easy.
I could do this job.
Oh, I wonder what the temperature is.
The temperature is 85.
Thanks.
Boy, you done got up there in New York and got soft, and this ain't nothing compared to July and August.
That's when you can take an egg and just fry it on the sidewalk.
Well, you can keep that.
After the funeral, I’m going straight back to New York City, where we don't have eggs frying on the sidewalk.
Why? Because it's cold?
No, because it's civilization.
There's too much urine on the sidewalk.
See, boy, see, you don't know what you're missing.
Now I’m telling you, now the hotter it get down here, the less and less the honeys start wearing.
You know, they got to let that booty bo...
...got to let that booty breathe.
Now I’m telling you,
I know you got all your
Naomo Campbos and your Holle Berrys, and your Teary-Eyed Banks, all them models and junk up there, but for the booty, you got to come down south.
We booty experts.
Booty-ologists.
Booty is in the eye of the beholder.
No, booty gonna be in my hand.
Check it out now, you see, now your Louisiana booty, it gets its renowned buoyancy from its heavy seafood diet, while your Alabama booty, it's characterized by its density.
You're talking about a quarter-bouncing ping.
And as for your
Mississippi booty, it's been an ongoing debate, but consensus say that the
Indian-genetic contribution gives us its beautiful tone.
And as for your
Georgia booty, it's been known for ages that the Georgia sun bakes and seals all the booty juices into a slow roast.
I see I’m dealing with a connoisseur.
Oh yeah, for sure.
A booty connoisseur.
Oh. Who's that?
Lilly. Please, hurry up.
That's Lilly.
Forget all of that booty stuff.
She's in a spectrum of fine as the energy is so potent, she got a class-action suit against her right now for reckless endangerment, man.
Sounds like a special kind of woman.
Well, holler at me later on tonight.
I’ll hook you up with her.
This is where you're staying.
I thought they were putting me up in a hotel.
This looks like a house.
It’s a boarding house.
It’s the only place that has room.
The prison officer's convention is in town.
Hey, Jimmy B.
Hey, what up, Smooth L?
His grandmother owns the place.
You Darrin?
Yes.
You're late.
Yo, come on, everybody is already at the funeral.
-Um... uh...
-Get in.
Mama catch me put a whuppin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend...
Hey, man, now, come on, look.
That's inappropriate music for this occasion.
Show some respect.
This man's auntie is about to be maggot food.
At any moment, the funeral is beginning of Sally Walker.
Let us have a moment of silence to pay our respect.
Uh, uh, sorry 'bout that.
I guess I was celebrating her life a little late, uh, into the night.
Oh, Simon. Sarah, how are y'all doing today?
This is Aunt Sally's nephew,
Darrin.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry about your aunt.
Oh, yes, we all loved Miss Sally.
Why, she was little
Nicholas' godmother.
Hey, little man.
You know I’m your daddy, right?
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
I’m in the friggin' twilight zone.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Oh, Sally!
Why'd it have to be her?
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord.
Good Lord, Faye!
Couldn't you find someplace else to be slain in the spirit?
Grandma, get up.
She's your grandma?
-Yeah.
-Oh, Lord, oh, Lord.
They've got a lot of nerve showing their faces in the House of God.
I’m glad my dear departed husband James isn't here to witness this abomination.
You can't keep people from a funeral, Paulina.
Besides, they all love Sally.
They're a bunch of heathens.
I don't even know why she cared.
Move down.
Brothers and sisters, we are gathered here today to pay tribute to a great woman...
Yeah!
...Sally Walker.
And we will now be blessed with a selection from the choir and their lead singer,
Reverend Shirley Caesar.
Oh...
I got a signal. It’s a miracle.
Son, if that ain't Jesus calling, shut it off.
Sorry. Go on. l, uh... l... cell phone's been out of range.
Has Mr. Fairchild changed his mind? l...
What?!
They've already started repossessing your stuff.
Not my TV!
Nothing can replace Aunt Sally!
Not my TV, not my Bose home theater system...
Yeah, let it out, son, let it out.
Mm, yeah. Mm.
Keep stalling the creditors,
I’ll call you back.
It’s all right.
Gonna be all right, man.
The church is in mourning
Mourning
Glory to God
The church is in mourning
Mourning
Oh, yes, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
The church is in

Good God almighty
Another soldier
A true born soldier

For the home-going

And the celebration of a wonderful woman
Aunt Sally
Everybody loved Aunt Sally
She took the young people
And carried them under her wings
And she cared for the elderly
I just want to say, listen
We might not have this chance
Sleep on, Aunt Sally
Sleep on, Aunt Sally
And take your rest
We loved you, Aunt Sally
But God loves you best lf you see my mother there
Tell my mama I’m on my way
I’m on my way

Let the church say amen.
Amen!
Let the church say amen.
Amen!
-Yes, Lord...
-Amen.
Yes, Lord!
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, well, well.
At this time, we'd like to give some of Sally's family and loved ones an opportunity to come up here and say how much she meant to them.
And it's only fitting to start with the person that came the farthest way to be here.
That's her great-nephew, Darrin.
All right, Darrin, all right.
Oh, yeah, brother Darrin.
Yes, my brother.
Come on.
Oh, yeah. Amen.
Hi.
Many of you don't remember me.
The one that had the phone.
Yeah. But before that,
I was Aunt Sally's favorite nephew.
Hmm!
I thought we'd see forever, but forever's gone away.
And it's so hard to say good-bye to yesterday.
Boyz II Men.
I got one amen. can I get another?
Amen.
My mom passed away a few years ago in a hit-and-run accident when I was still a teenager, and it's the talks
I had with her
I cherish more than anything.
I remember her telling me... that it was Aunt Sally who took us in when I was just a baby, after my father died in Vietnam.
I’ll always love her for that.
Your mama dead, too?
He just said it.
Young man,
I’m so glad that you came for your aunt's funeral.
Yeah.
She was always telling us how well you were doing up in New York.
With your important job.
What was it?
What was what?
Your job.
It’s funny, she never mentioned what it was.
Boy, I haven't seen you since you were knee-high to a grasshopper.
Reverend, um, have you seen this very pretty lady--
I think her name is Lilly?
She ain't no lady.
Oh, now, Mother Cooley.
All sinners are welcome in the house of the Lord.
Sinner? She's a sinner?
What kind of sinner?
Unrepentant.
Really.
Well, Darrin, I just come to offer you my condolences and to just let you know that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.
You got to understand that she's in a far better place, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
You know, I got to tell you, you and that choir-- boy, you're pretty good.
Pretty good? Huh.
And to my neighbor and best friend, Faye,
I leave all my favorite recipes.
Thank you, Sally.
Now, Faye, depending on what I die from, you might want to divide the Crisco measurements by half.
Don't change that Chicken Supreme.
And to Paulina Pritchett,
I leave my collection of church hats that she always complimented me on.
She should really enjoy wearing them, unless, of course, she was lying to me all those years but criticizing my taste behind my back.
I’ll wear them every Sunday.
And now, for my only surviving relative, my great-nephew, Darrin.
To Darrin, I leave the box containing the letters his mother sent me after they left Monte Carlo.
I also pass on to him the charge of returning to Monte Carlo to continue the family tradition of... directing the Beulah Baptist Church Choir.
-No!
-No. l-It’s her dying wish.
I was next in line to get the choir.
I been waiting years for Sally to die.
God rest her soul.
Listen, lady, you can have it.
I’m not staying, let alone leading some small-town choir.
Good.
O-On the condition that Darrin gets the choir accepted into the annual Gospel Explosion in Columbus, and performs there,
I also leave him my entire stock in Georgia Telecom, currently worth $150,000.
I was just kidding about that small-town stuff.
And the church bus.
How much that worth?
No way! Mm-mmm!
I don't care what Sally's dying wish was.
We all know she was losing it these last few years.
Besides, Paul, it's your church, and you have final say over who leads the choir.
It’s in the bylaws.
Well, I guess that would seem kind of odd to have someone with no musical experience leading the choir.
No, no, I have plenty of musical experience.
Now, you all don't know this, and I didn't tell anyone, but, um...
I’m a music producer.
Oh.
Yeah, that's what
I do for a living.
Ooh, looks like Sally might have been onto something.
W-W-W-What kind of producing have you done?
Well, I’ve worked with, uh...
P. Diddy.
Dre, Dark Child-- all of them.
-Who that?
-That's the gangsta stuff that's polluting my grandson's mind.
I was the one that put an end to that whole East Coast versus West Coast thing.
Yeah, I just sat them all down and made them watch Roots.
I think
I read about that.
So, what is this Gospel Explosion?
Oh, it's the annual event where choirs from all over the southeast come to Columbus, Georgia, to compete for the best gospel performance and a $10,000 cash prize.
Yeah, a prize that could pay for some much-needed church repairs...
...if a certain musical producer would bring it home, yes?
Paul Lewis, have you lost your natural mind?
I wish Mama was alive to see how you turn on family like this.
Sally was as close to family as anybody can get, and I intend on honoring her dying wish.
Now, Darrin, the choir is yours.
You have six weeks until the Gospel Explosion.
Whatever you need, we're at your disposal.
But you're going to have to talk to the church treasurer about logistics.
Let me guess.
You're the treasurer.
Yes. Everything you need is at my disposal.
Great.
Take it easy.
Oh, oh, uh, Paulina, can I get a ride back to my room?
Oh, Darrin.
Since you're going to be here for longer than I thought, let me give you the extended stay rates.
Great.
There's an extra charge of $1 .50 for every bar of soap you use, from now on, for any clean towel you require, and $1 .00 a minute for all calls made.
You get one free 9-1-1 call.
I suggest you use it wisely.
Air conditioning?
You're charging me for air conditioning?
It gets 100 degrees at night.
What is that?
It’s a Monte Cristo.
It’s a cigar.
Obviously.
Cuban?
Of course.
Cool.
Hey!
That-That cost me $20.
This is a no-smoking house.
It’s a no-smoking, no drinking, no fornicating, no point of living at all house.
Why are we here?
You'll see.
A little Southern delight.
Now the honeys in here, they make them girls in Atlanta look like somebody hit them in the face with a sack of nickels.
And I don't mean that in a sexy way.
There she is.
You're on your own.
I see somebody that owes me some money.
Hey man, don't run away from me.
Man, I told you
I was going to get...
-Ooh, hi, sexy.
-Hey, baby.
Oh...
You give me fever...
Fever... oh...
Oh...
You give me fever
Fever in the morning
Fever when it's late at night
You give me fever
Fever
Fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
You give me fever
Fever
Fever when you're with me
Fever when you love...
He's so sweet
He's so good to me
He's so intelligent
He's so confident
Baby, so damn sexy
Baby, put the fever on me
Give me a fever... oh...
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get the fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever
Fever
When you kiss me
And fever when you hold me tight
You give me fever
Fever
 In the morning
And fever all through the night
Baby's so damn sexy
But baby put the fever on me, uh-uh
Baby knows just what to do
Got me boiling past 102
Give me a fever
Ooh...
Everybody's got a fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
And Juliet felt the same
When he puts his arms around her
He said, “Julie, baby, you're my flame”
Give me fever
When we kisseth
Fever with a flame in you
Fever... I’m on fire
Fever, yeah,
I burn and soothe
Now that you listened to my story
Here's a point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Being Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever
When you kiss them
And fever if you live and learn
Fever, until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn...
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to...
Burn...
Fever.
Whoo!
Tea with honey.
Here you go, Lilly.
Thank you.
You really know how to connect with your audience.
That was hot.
It’s a part of my act.
I pick out the guy who's drooling the most, and I make him sweat.
Well, it worked.
Can I buy you a real drink?
I’m Darrin.
You really don't remember me?
That Lilly?
You kept asking me to be your girlfriend.
And you kept saying no.
Yeah, I was determined to be
Mrs. Michael Jackson.
And how's that going?
Ah, turns out
I’m not his type.
I can't believe you remember that stuff.
I left town when you were what, five?
Four.
Man, we heard about you all the time.
Every week in choir rehearsal,
Sally would tell us poor country folk how well you and your mama were doing in slick city.
She was very special to all of us.
Yeah.
When I talked to her on the phone, just before she passed, she kept saying that she wanted me to come back and be with her friends, like you.
You spoke with Sally that day?
Oh, yeah.
She went on and on.
I suppose she hung up the phone and, uh...
And her dying wish was for us to hook up?
God love her.
Sally was in a coma two weeks before she died.
That's right.
It was... must have been a couple of weeks ago...
Right.
Anyway, I’m back amongst all you wonderful people who need consoling as much as I do.
How long are you in town?
Just tonight.
Hey, how about being my girlfriend, for old times' sake?
I’ve got a man.
Oh.
Dean is big and strong and has a real big jealous streak.
Sometimes he watches from the back.
Excuse me,
I got a show to do.
Uh, okay.
Hey, knock 'em dead.
Your act is terrific.
Yours needs a lot of work.
I know I missed your call, Rosa, but this is the only place
I get a signal.
More charges came in, more late fees.
You're up to 44 grand now.
Okay, listen, I just came into some money, all right?
And I’ll be able to take care of everything in just a few weeks.
Just, uh, make sure they don't know where to find me.
I’ll do my best.
You're a doll.
Kick ass.
Sorry.
Okay, when everyone gets here, we'll begin rehearsals.
I was thinking we should just stick to that number you did at the funeral.
Should be good enough to get into any gospel competition.
That was Shirley Caesar, fool.
She hasn't gone to this church for years, but since she loved Sally, we let her and her choir sing at the funeral.
She's gone?
She's gone.
Well, where's our choir?
You're looking at it.
This is it?
Six measly people.
Actually just five.
Um, I’m just here 'cause my wife's family's in town.
They're staying at my house.
Too late.
You're in the choir now.
Well, actually there are two or three others.
Yeah, but they never show up.
Man, this is busted.
Why do I have to be here?
Oh, Brother Darrin?
When are you going to get us our first record contract?
I want to hurry up and get a Benz.
Hey, I didn't know we were going to be famous.
You know what?
Definitely count me in now.
Um... let's do, uh...
“Amazing Grace.”
Amaze...
Maze...
Amaze...
Ah-amaze...
...zing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop, please.
Okay, okay, okay, let's not panic.
Um...
I’m open to suggestion.
Hey, when you get us that record deal, and they do one of those
VH1 Behind the Musics on us,
I think it's best if we don't talk about me trying to leave the group.
You know?
They'll just make it look ugly.
Everything I do is just for you
Counting every second till we rendezvous
You want to rendezvous
Ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Oh, and I want to give it to you, baby
Give it to me, baby
I want to give it to you
Oh, give it to me, baby
Hey...
'Cause everything I do is just for you
'Cause everything
I do is just for you
All for you
Come on, give me your love.
Uh, hello, there.
I just had to see you again.
Aren't you supposed to be gone?
Yes, but, uh,
I was feeling bad about our little misunderstanding last night.
No misunderstanding, just using Aunt Sally's memory to hit on me.
-That's low.
-Come on.
Can I at least buy you a drink?
Is that Dean?
No.
Okay, you can buy me a drink.
Oh, I’m sure you heard
-about Aunt Sally's will.
-No.
It seems she wants me to take care of the choir down at Beulah.
Why did she put you in charge of it?
I’m sorry, that came out wrong.
Oh, no, no, no.
It’s okay, it was a shock to me, too.
Yeah, it's a big job.
That's why I’ve cleared my schedule for the next six weeks, put some business deals on hold, so that I can focus on getting the choir into the Gospel Explosion.
No.
I been there and done that.
Look, if it's Paulina you're worried about,
I’ll take care of Paulina.
I’d love to see that one.
I’m the choir director now.
Yeah, for six weeks.
Listen, if she starts getting all Christian on you...
-Christian?
-Yeah.
She is not a Christian.
My mama said hollering in the church don't make you any more of a Christian than standing in the garage makes you a Cadillac.
No, man, I can't let those hypocrites look down their noses at me just because l...
Sing sexy songs for a living.
Exactly.
And just because l...
Dress like that.
What's wrong with the way I dress?
Oh, no, no, I’m just finishing your sentence.
I was going to say because l...
Cheat on your boyfriend with hot choir directors from New York City?
Stop...
-Finishing your sentences?
-Look.
I know your kind.
You came here last night
'cause you wanted something.
You came back again tonight
'cause you want something else, and tomorrow you're going to want something else.
I can smell when a man is trying to use me, and mister, you stink.
Okay, is that how you feel about it?
Fine.
This town is full of singers.
I don't need you anyway.
And remember, everybody,
Handy's Funeral Home offers limousines for all occasions.
Why not get in one while you're still living?
Well, now that we done paid the bills...
Ladies and gentlemen, sitting directly across from me,
I have Mr. Darrin Hill all the way from New York City.
So Darrin, tell the good people of Monte Carlo what brings you down here with us?
I’m responsible for rebuilding the choir down at Beulah Baptist Church.
In fact, I’m holding auditions tomorrow morning, and anyone with any musical ability can come by.
As long as they are, as we say at Beulah, fully committed to God's work.
Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
Whoa!
Forgiving my sins
Baptized in the water
Freed by the Holy Ghost
Washed in the blood of the lamb
Forgiving my sins
Baptized in the water
Freed by the Holy Ghost
Washed in the blood of the lamb
God's going to move this place
God's going to move this place
God's going to turn the world upside down
Auditions for the Beulah Baptist
Church Choir are still open.
Applicants need not be fully committed to God's work, but shouldn't be against it.
I’m the hottest shit in
New York since Air Force Ones
And from the borough that brought you Chris and Pun
Yeah, a lot of cats rhyme, but not like some
I make it hard, like breathing with a slug in your lung
Blow, blow, now you got to deal with me
Isn't she lovely?
Isn’t she wonderful?
Isn’t she precious?
Isn’t she precious?
Just one minute old
You got to be kidding me!
I never thought true love would bring
One that's has lovely as she
But isn't she lovely?
Made from love.
News update.
Auditions for the Beulah
Baptist Church Choir, atheists may now apply.
Oh, thanks for coming, Lucius.
No problem.
Where to?
Oh, I just need to print up some more fliers.
Paulina won't let me use
Jimmy B's printer anymore.
She says it's running up her light bill.
Oh, well, you know old folks in the south believe some crazy stuff.
Tell me about it.
When it's storming, she doesn't even use the electricity.
You don't play with God.
Right.
You don't sing, do you, Lucius?
Do I sing? Y-Yeah.
They say I sound like a black Al Jarreau.
Great, you're in the choir.
Oh, whoa, wait a minute.
What'd you say?
Pump your brakes.
I’m not planning on joining the church until I have sown my wild oats.
Then I’m going to get me a young virgin and settle down.
Say no more.
Besides... word's out.
Paulina's bad enough, you done pissed her off.
Don't nobody want to be a part of that mix made in hell.
Now the only way
I can join is... is if... is if you paying.
How about the prize money?
Done deal, 50/50.
Hello, are you Joseph?
Yeah.
Can I line you up, son?
Actually I just came by to post some fliers for my choir auditions, if that's okay.
Sure.
Seeing how you're new in these parts, it's going to be kind of hard for you to attract people.
Most folks around here, they don't trust an outsider.
It was years before I told anyone
I’m not from Mississippi.
I’ve got a guy here who needs his ears lowered.
Hey, Lilly.
Dean, my man.
Come on,
I’ll get the seat.
That's Dean?
He's big, strong and jealous, so watch yourself.
So I see you done met the big-time music producer from New York, huh?
Music producer?
Lilly has the best voice in town.
I know.
You don't have to wait with me.
No one else's mom waits for them.
He'll be fine.
Okay, I’m going to be next door, all right?
Dean, don't talk to strangers.
Yo, big man.
You want us to sing you a song like we did last time?
Yes, please.
It'll cost you.
I’ll give you a thousand money.
Deal.
Ooh...
When I was a little boy
When I was just a boy
And the devil would call my name
When I was just a boy
I’d say “Now who do,
Who do you think you're fooling?”
-When I was just a boy
-I’m a consecrated boy
When I was just a boy
I’m a singer in a Sunday choir
Oh, my mama loves me
She loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Oh, she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages
And loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me
When I was grown to be a man
Grown to be a man
And the devil would call my name
Grown to be a man
I’d say “Now who do,
Who do you think you're fooling?”
-Grown to be a man
-I’m a consummated man
Grown to be a man
I can snatch a little purity
Oh, my mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Like she loves me like a rock.
Lilly.
You know, at first I was afraid you'd follow me here, but I actually feel a lot safer knowing you're not in the same room with my son.
And to answer your next question, no...
You're not married.
Don't finish my sentences.
That's why you're a sinner.
Stay far away from me.
No, no...
No, I’m saying, that's no reason to treat you badly.
I mean, how dare they?
It’s not your fault.
Well, it's 50% your fault because it takes two people to...
Well, you know what I mean.
No.
I’m saying it's a pity that you don't have a complete family, but it's still no reason...
Oh, don't talk to me about family,
Mr. Didn't Call Aunt Sally
For 20 Years.
Hi.
Hi.
I’m sorry.
I’m starting to see how tough things are for you.
Oh, yes.
Boo-hoo for the poor, black mother stuck in her hometown without a man.
Whatever shall I do?
I didn't mean it that way.
Excuse me, Lilly, I’m sorry, but your card is maxed out again.
I forgot to put my paycheck in.
Thank you.
-Excuse me.
-Hmm-mm.
Hey, try this one.
Sorry, Dr. Hill, yours is declined, too.
Dr. Hill? You a doctor?
No, that's just my music name.
You know, like Dr. John,
Dr. Dre.
Try this one.
Well, that's cleared.
Of course.
Sign here.
Thank you.
That was really nice.
You didn't have to do that.
That's what I’m saying,
I’m a nice guy.
I don't know what the problem is.
I usually get along better with beautiful women.
Okay, I’ll...
I’ll give you a check tomorrow, first thing.
Oh, um, cash.
Cash.
Reverend.
Oh... Darrin.
Thanks for meeting me here.
Uh, how's it going with the choir?
Well, I’m still having trouble recruiting the members.
Son, it's at times like these
I suggest listening to God's voice.
Sorry, Rev, I’m not into the spooky stuff.
Oh, just open it up.
And these people can sing?
Oh, yes.
Please don't tell my sister.
Hello, everyone.
I’d like you to welcome the new members of our choir.
So when is this competition?
 In a few weeks.
And our new organist.
You touch my keyboard and I kick your drunk 'bama ass.
Oh, oh, wait, Homer.
Now, if we stand any chance of getting into the Gospel Explosion, we could use all the help we can get.
Shoot.
Bringing all these drunks up into the church with hats on and drunks and everything.
Okay, everyone, please.
Okay, good.
Good. Uh...
I’d like to...
I’d like to try a new song.
Um... uh...
Tasha?
Can you, uh, get rid of the gum, please?
Sure.
Okay.
That was nasty.
Uh... “Swing Low,
Sweet Chariot.”
Oh, ah, uh, Homer, please.
Scooter.
Swing low
Sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home...
Wait-wait-wait, wait, wait, stop, stop.
Stop, wait, um... this is not working.
Um...
You need to pick a lead singer.
You'd know that if you knew what you were doing.
Oh, oh, could-could I maybe try?
Bessie... would you, uh, like to try?
No.
My dear departed husband James said that when I sing, it made him think of heaven.
Probably meant he wanted to blow his brains out.
Paulina, you've sung lead
-before?
-I have, and it gave me great joy.
Oh, good. Then it'll hurt that much more when I find someone else.
Be careful, Dean, baby, don't hurt yourself.
Oh, let the boy be.
He's already wearing more protection then they gave me when I fought in the war.
Oh!
-Hey.
-Hey.
You're the pain in the butt from the barbershop.
He must have heard that somewhere.
Hi, there, young man.
I’m Lilly's grandfather.
Hello, sir.
I’ve been waiting for a nice, strong young man to come and whisk Lilly away.
Somebody did that already, remember?
She shouldn't be wasting the next 25 years of her life taking care of no old man.
No, she should go off and have a life of her own.
Cool!
Sammy Sosa.
What do you say?
He said cool.
Dean?
Thank you.
Look, Granddaddy.
-I got Sammy Sosa.
-Oh, okay.
So have you changed your mind about the choir?
Why should l,
'cause you gave Dean a toy?
No. Yes?
Why is this so important to you?
Because it's what my Aunt Sally wanted me to do.
Every time I pack my bags to leave,
I get that image of her helping my Mom out when I was little... and because it was her last wish to get into the Explosion, and because...
And because you're getting $150,000.
I thought I’d finish your sentence for you.
That is the truth, right?
Yeah. Yes.
Thanks for being honest, but I can't.
What?
You mean, I just told the truth for nothing?
Thank you for the loan yesterday.
I know you want cash.
You know, this truth stuff is highly overrated.
I don't care who started it.
You both should be ashamed.
Okay, let's try it once more from the top.
Hey. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I’m not doing this for you.
The truth is I’m doing this for Sally.
Well, thank you anyway.
Choir, I’d like you to meet our new soloist, Lilly.
-What's your last name?
-Tramp.
I knew this would happen.
No-no-no, wait, wait, wait, please, please.
Let me handle this. Please.
Have you forgotten that Jesus loved Mary Magdalene?
She was a ho.
“Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.”
Thank you for handling it.
No, no, no, no, no,
I-I don't mean it.
I’m just saying it for effect. Please.
It is your duty to help fallen women.
I’m willing to help.
-Hi.
-I agree. It’s about time we get some young Baptist booty up in this choir.
Ask her how come she has to keep so many husbands away from their homes down at that old sin hole she be working at.
Would Aunt Sally have been this harsh?
No.
No, Sally would've wanted Lilly to stay in the choir...
-Amen.
-unlike some people.
-Amen again.
-That's right. lf she was a respectable woman, she would have a respectable job.
The last thing we need is another loose woman up in the choir stand.
Now she should just go on home, take care of that little bastard baby...
Leave my son out of this.
Talk to her. Tell her.
Dean is a gift from God.
So is snow and rain, but we still have to wear our rubbers.
You know what Sally told me once?
She said,
“When life makes you have to put up
“with mean and hateful people,
“just think of them as sandpaper.
“They may scratch you, rub you the wrong way,
“but eventually... you end up smooth and polished,
“and the sandpaper-- it's just going to be worn out and ugly.”
Lilly, you don't need my help.
Now if I could get you all to sing as well as you fight, you'd be the baddest choir in all of Georgia.
Now, Lilly is a member of this choir like everyone else. lf you don't like it, well... you can just leave.
Oh, well that's my cue.
Y'all coming?
Uh, Paulina,
I thought you were leaving.
The choir, yes, but I’ll stay in this church as long as I want.
I’m the treasurer.
Fine. Fine. Then we'll rehearse with Lilly as our lead.
-Watch it, bro.
-Hey!
-Get down.
-That's mine. Right there.
Aw, man!
The Lord is good.
The Lord bless you.
Mr. Clean!
You know, I always liked church.
There's a hell of a lot more action than in the barbershop.
Okay.
Ready?
Hold it.
Do I come in on the upbeat or the downbeat?
Suit yourself. You're the pro.
Try the downbeat, honey.
I usually let the Neptunes program on my upbeat, so...
Let's try it again from the top.
Wait.
Aren't you going to arrange us for the performance?
Right, right.
Lilly, Lilly, please, up.
Ladies, all three, up.
Okay, Tasha,
Tasha, please, down... and, uh... oh, please, yes, Bessie,
Alma and Miss Stringer.
Yeah, cute. Yes, yes, there you go.
Okay. Young and foxy in the front and weird and funky in the back... but we love you.
All right. Ready?
From the top.
I’m... going...
Home!
Great! Yee-haw!
With a little more work,
I think we've got a real shot at the Explosion.
And after that, maybe even a record deal.
Then we'll tour on our own bus with a clean bathroom.
A tour? Girl, like I’m going to leave my granddaddy behind by himself? Uh-uh.
Well, thankfully all my family's dead.
That wasn't half bad.
It saddens me that the deadline for entering the Gospel
Explosion has passed.
What?
“All audition tapes are to be submitted to audition judge
Luther Washington by... yesterday afternoon.
She had something to do with this.
I mean, you know, she...
Why didn't you say something?
You're the director now; deadlines are your problem.
It’s been posted for weeks.
Where?
On the back of the ladies' room door.
I sure as heck never saw it, and I use that door every day.
You need to check the girl's bathroom more often.
You mean we did all this work
-for nothing?
-Yeah.
And my best friend Keno taught me how to do the African Boot Dance.
Heck, I even stopped drinking.
Uh, I know that's a good thing,
-I-I’m just saying...
-Wait, wait, wait, listen, hey, listen, everybody.
Just go home and don't worry.
Taking care of problems is my specialty.
I’ll be back in a couple of weeks, and if I don't get a job,
I’m a dead man.
Yeah, I used my credit card down here to fix a bus. Why?
They traced it. It was reported to a credit bureau in Atlanta.
Well, what does that mean?
Felony, interstate fraud.
Just lay low, and stay away from law enforcement.
Mr. Washington will see you now.
Mr. Hill.
Lucius.
As a Christian man,
I do believe in mercy, but as a prison warden,
I’m a stickler for the rules.
See, without rules, society breaks down.
Sorry.
Listen...
Let me handle this.
Did I say you can talk?
-Look...
-Did I open my mouth and say you could talk?
But I-I-I... I took assertive tenderness.
I took assertiveness training.
Look, Washington, we're giving you an opportunity to be a part of the
Belie Baptist...
Beulah.
The Beulah Baptist
Gospel Choir business.
Me, an opportunity?
Now, you need BBGC more than BBGC needs you.
We're selling, not buying.
We're not selling.
We're... we are...
We're buying, not selling.
Now, you got 30 seconds to m-make an offer, or it's, you know?
We-we...
Let me think about it.
No.
Oh, come on.
Please, man.
-We'll pay you.
-Listen, listen.
Sir, you don't understand the challenges my choir and I have faced.
Please, just hear us sing.
We can be ready in a half hour.
No.
And I’m putting my foot down.
It’s a big “N” and a little “o.”
Sir, the entertainment for today canceled.
And you know what happened last time.
You said a half an hour?
Will you let us into the Explosion?
Only if you guys can pass the mustard with my prisoners.
Mustard's passed.
We'll blow them away.
Look, we got to do it, or we won't get into the Explosion.
Darrin, Darrin.
-Darrin, Darrin.
-Just relax.
They all look so scary.
Look, we're here now, so I’m going to sing it.
What? Huh?
-What?
-Huh?
Swing low...
Join in, join in, join in, join in!
-Sweet chariot
-Shut up, old man!
Go home!
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home...
Swing low...
Sweet chariot
That's better.
-Hey, now.
-Coming for
To carry me home
Swing low
Sweet, sweet, sweet chariot, chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Yeah, yeah
Swing down chariots, won't you let me ride?
-Oh, swing
-Swing down chariots
Stop and let me ride
Oh, rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord
Calm and easy
I got a home
I got a home on the other side
Dance, everybody, dance.
Six white horses standin' side by side
-Oh, sing
-Six white horses prancing
-Sing
-Side by side
Oh, rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord
Rock me, rock me
Calm and easy
I got a home...
I got home on the other side
Swing low, swing low
Swing low, swing low, and let me ride
Why don't you let me ride?
Why don't you let me ride?
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Oh why don't you let me ride?
-Let me ride
-Why don't you let me ride?
Let me ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Swing down chariots, won't you let me ride?
-Oh, swing
-Swing down chariots
Stop and let me ride
Oh, rock me, rock me, Lord
Calm and easy
I got a home on the other side
-I got a home
-I got a home
You got a home
I got a home
We got a home
I got a home
-I got a home
-I got a home
I got a home
You got a home
I got a home
We goin' home
I got a home
-Goin' home
-I got a home
-Yes, Lord
-I got a home
Sweet Lord
I got a home
Take me home
I got a home
Take me home, Lord
I’m going home.
So look here, I guess that, uh, your choir's in the Gospel Explosion.
Don't let anyone know
I gave you any slack.
I have a reputation as a hard ass in the choir community.
Do you think we have a shot at winning?
Hell, no.
You made it through the audition, but...
I got prisoners that can sing better than your choir.
Really?
Single file now.
Stay in line.
Guns in church.
The abomination that causes desolation.
Guns ain't allowed?
Somebody should have told me.
Hey, big guy, what's your name?
Oh.
My name is Johnson.
What are you in for?
Beating down somebody for making fun of my high voice.
Okay, so let's take, uh...
Let's take it from the top, shall we?
Uh, our felons first.
Up. Up, please.
Up.
Okay.
Um...
Gonna lay down my burdens...
Um, Mr. Briggs, is there a problem?
It’s one thing for the state to force us to make license plates, or work in chain gangs, but to make us sing in a choir?
That's cruel and unusual punishment.
Mr. Johnson?
I used to be in a group, and when we used to sing, uh,
“Down By the Riverside”-- there's a part of the song where I used to
Wail.
You know, right at the end with the sword and shield part.
People really liked that.
Would you like me to do that for you?
All right.
What group did you sing with?
It doesn't matter.
They're dead now.
Right.
Okay, um...
Great.
And now, news time.
The Beulah Baptist Church Choir now includes some talented inmates from our state prison system.
This could turn out to be the breakout choir of the year.
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I’m gonna lay down my burdens, child
Down by the riverside
Yeah, down
Down by the riverside
Down
Down by the riverside
-Say, I’m...
-Ee-oop
I’m gonna lay down my burdens
Down by...
Down by the riverside
Say, I ain't
Study war
-No, no, no, no
-No more
Study war no more...
No more
Say, I’m going down to the river
Gonna put my foot in
Gonna let it go up to my knees
Gonna let it go down to my thigh
And I ain't gonna study war no more
No
Study war no more
-No
-Study war no more l, l, l, l, l
Study war no more...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All that street-corner barbershop harmony
That's cool, right?
We got some new hip-hop in Monte Carlo, Georgia, for y'all tonight-- yo, Briggs
I’m sick of packin' all these nines
Slingin' dimes and smokin' all the marijuana
Chillin' with pretty mamas from
Havana in the Bahamas
Most demons tryin' to see me hot, like I’m in the sauna
And I’m just tryin' to get you loose, kinda like Madonna
Call up everybody I know, tell 'em it's time to go
Me and Bee-Z in the 6-4 sittin' real low
Got the roll to the riverside, put that liquor to the side
Ain't no need for getting high, stay alive, in touch
Helps you die, that cocaine, get me trippin', y'all
Never been lickin' that, none of my burdens
Because I don't wanna be left and burnin'
Flirtin' with death
And they promise my last breath
Dressed in prison blues
Holy Spirit got me under arrest
I used to be a thug, sold drugs
Might have stalked you
Stepped up in the church, got converted at the altar
And I fought 'ya
Fell back and he caught you
Out tryin' to floss, better live what he taught you
Goin' down
We goin' down to the river
Take it to the river
Goin' down, baby
Yo, yo
Down to the river
Take it to the river
And lay down
Haulin' my glocks and automatics
I’m charismatic, like crack addicts
You wreak havoc like road ragers in bad traffic
It gets drastic, but He's fantastic
In attracting no one packing, now we're fasting
Has the passion, how can I get this life everlasting?
Sick of blastin' and dashin', flashin' like Charles Manson
Give me the ransom, now we're glory, holla, dancin'
I’m flippin' and rippin' to come up with lyrical styles
Y'all never heard
Tryin' to reach you climb the stair
Beyond all of this trippin' birds
Forget the English but rhymes, but I’m the jefe
They bust the rich, bringin' beats like Tito Puente
Salsa, merengue, repos calientes
Azucar sabroso para ti and para mi
Goin' down
Oh, as long as they praising God's name, it's all right with me.
The congregation is going to be in for a surprise come Sunday.
Yeah, let me know how it goes.
I expect you to be there, too.
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
I’m goin' down, baby
We goin' down to the river
We
So
Hot
We
Don't
Stop

Glad you're here, Reverend.
I suppose you've noticed how the choir has grown.
I-I was just seeing how good they are.
I also suppose you plan on enforcing the rules and the bylaws that says all members of the choir must be baptized and take Bible-study classes.
Oh, now, Paulina.
You can't change that.
It’ll change everything.
She has a point, Darrin.
What point is that? lf you change things, then they'll be different?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, I’m sorry, Darrin.
But if they're going to stay, they're going to have to abide by the church rules.
I can't swim.
Uh, don't worry, Mr. Johnson.
It’s just a... just a little sprinkle.
I won't do it.
We're broadcasting live from down by the riverside where three lost souls are trying to find Jesus.
Although personally,
I don't think this is where he fell in.
I baptize you in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
Burns.
It burns.
Oh, brother, it's just the waste from the refinery upstream, you see?
Well, guess that about does it.
Oh, funny thing, Darrin.
I don't remember you being baptized.
Do you, Paul?
Oh, uh... uh... uh...
Well, you know l...
-Paul?!
-No, I don't.
I am not getting in that water.
Uh-huh.

Thanks for coming with me.
Alma gave me the key, but I felt kind of creepy coming here by myself.
Just got to get this box of letters before everything is packed away.
They said it was in a trunk.
I didn't even know Mama was writing these.
I always thought she lost contact with everyone here.
“Dear Sally, I think this will be my big year.
“We're settled into our apartment and the rent is covered.”
She has “Thanks” in parentheses.
Sally.
“Here's a picture of Darrin.
Doesn't he look like a future doctor or lawyer?”
Eww.
This one was actually addressed to you from Aunt Sally.
It says “Return to Sender.”
It’s because I moved around a lot.
Oh, my God.
Not that funny.
Dear Darrin,
I’m worried about you.
All the different addresses and phone numbers.
The people calling here looking for you.
You seem to be lying about who you are.
Why can't you accept who you are?
God accepts you.
New York is so dangerous, criminals, crazy people, and me if I have to come up there and whip your ass.
Up there acting like you ain't got no home training.
It’s my fault.
I never should have let Paulina run your mom out.
I love you, Darrin.
I’m the only family you have, and you're the only family
I have.
What does the letter say?
Something in my eye.
What does the letter say?
Oh, just stuff, stuff
I probably should have known.
Let me see your eye.
-Huh? Oh.
-Let me see your eye.
She looks kind of disapproving.
