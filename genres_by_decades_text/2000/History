Tordesillas, the year of Our Lord 1554.
She is 74 years old and has been locked up in this castle for almost half a century.
She has been successively betrayed by her father, by her husband and by her son.
Daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, wife of Philip of Habsburg, mother of the Emperor Charles V, queen in her own right of Castile and Aragon.
They call her
Joan the Mad.
When I close my eyes, he approaches me.
I feel his skin beneath my fingertips.
His voice flows into my ears.
I perceive the odor ofhis armpits.
He arouses my desire.
I do not fear death.
No matter what, it will take me to Philip.
JOAN THE MAD
Lady Elvira.
We're spending the night here.
Laredo is only a few hours away.
- Anything else, Captain?
- Whatever Her Majesty orders.
Alvar!
May I still call you Alvar?
Of course, Princess.
You may still call meJoan.
Look.
You gave it to me, remember?
I'll never forget our happy childhood days.
They're taking me to be wed, Alvar.
In Flanders.
All my blessings.
What are you thinking, daughter?
This time tomorrow,
I'll be on my way to Flanders.
And far from you.
It's God's will.
And yours too.
That is so.
The sovereign of Castile,
Queen Isabella the Catholic, has set out, accompanied by her children.
They are all there,
Princess Isabella,
John, Catherine and Maria, to accompany their sisterJoan as she sets out on her greatjourney to Flanders.
Laredo, August, 1496.
Be a good girl, Catherine.
I'll be thinking about you.
God chose to make me
Queen of Castile.
My people have crossed the seas in search of another world.
Yet the sea is still a mystery to me.
I am too old to undertake a voyage.
So you will never come to see me.
My duty is to your father and to Castile, as your duty will be to Philip of Habsburg, to Burgundy and to Flanders.
I shall obey you, Mother.
I know that my life, like yours, requires greater endeavor than my humble person can offer.
That is so.
My prayer book.
I got it from my mother.
You were born a princess and must accept it.
It is true that your marriage to Philip is for political reasons, but some happiness is also possible.
No one, except God, possesses the power and knowledge of what is to come.
Did you know Father before you married him?
I married Ferdinand for love.
How will I know if I love Philip?
With time.
Put it there. Be careful.
With time.
Perhaps you will never know.
If that is so, take consolation in living in sanctity with a man.
And if you're asked, answer as I do, that you married him for love.
It is an enormous task.
At times, a painful and terrible task.
Don't cry, child.
You'll soon have a husband.
Soon, my princess, you'll be a woman and you'll dream of paradise.
Ready.
Raise your bows.
Take aim.
Now!
The Spanish fleet arrived yesterday in Ostende, Sire.
- How is the princess?
- Princess Joan is in good health.
She is anxious to meet you.
Tomorrow morning
- she will reach Brussels.
- Lord de Veyre, how soon can we be in Brussels?
With a change of horses, we can be in the palace tomorrow evening, Sire.
My horse!
Double formation!
Present arms!
Brigitte de la Motte.
Carlota de Foix.
Inés de Bravante.
The letter, Madam.
The letter.
"I have the honor to address the Archduke of Austria and
Duke of Burgundy and Bravante, and to wish you every blessing on behalf of my beloved parents, the monarchs of Castile and Aragon.
I also wish to express my joy and satisfaction on establishing between our kingdoms an eternal union blessed by the Pope and the Church."
The princess and I wish to be married immediately.
Who must give us the blessing?
Sire, it is the Bishop of Malinas who is to bless this union, but that will be, God willing, a week from now.
The ceremony will take place on that day as planned, but the princess and I wish to celebrate it in privacy, now.
Do you agree, Princess?
Your blessing, Father.
Kneel down.
May the Lord God confirm your mutual consent expressed before the Church.
What God has joined let no man pull asunder.
We shall see you at the official ceremony within a week.
What?
Don't leave.
Please.
Brigitte, Inés.
Brigitte, Inés! Come here!
The old folk say that a lass pulls more than a rope.
But they forget one thing.
You have to adorn the lass.
Now, my princess, take a little turn around.
Just a few steps.
If you don't close your legs, the whole court will laugh.
Leave us.
Are all lovers like him, Aida?
No, my child, no.
Tonight I'll paint your nipples and your lips with henna.
I want you to drive him mad.
October 1497.
Death has begun to trace out its plans by stealing the life ofJohn, the firstborn of the Catholic Monarchs.
Fate will still have to cut short another four lives before making Joan into the heiress to the crown of Castile.
It's a girl!
Meanwhile, at the court in Brussels, life was forcing its way through, thanks toJoan's abundant fertility.
Your daughter.
She will be called Eleanor.
Majesty.
Sire, it was a very easy birth, and very beautiful.
Joan, are you there?
She's a glutton.
She wants to devour me.
You're the only princess who breast-feeds her children.
- Why do you insist?
- I like it.
And so does Eleanor.
It helps ease the pain in my breasts.
There are other ways to ease that pain.
I will not be milked like a cow.
My daughter is alive and I want to feed her with my own blood.
Your words and your behavior are surprising everyone.
Don't get dressed.
Lord de Veyre received a letter from my father. I have to see him.
Let him wait.
He has told me there is important news regarding our friends from France.
Your husband has duties which require his attention, Madam.
My husband's first duty is to make me happy.
I am full.
You are mad.
Joan, it is barely a month since you gave birth.
We mustn't abandon ourselves to such transports.
Despite everything, the days and months passed happily in the palace.
Excuse me.
- Yes, Madam?
- An indisposition.
Accompany her. You go too.
It is nothing, Sire.
- Madam, do you feel well?
- Yes, very well.
The poor man shits, the rich man too.
- What can ail her?
- I don't know.
Is anything wrong, Madam?
How pregnant is she?
Eight months.
She wouldn't have it here and now?
Her Highness is like a cow.
Say something, Madam, please.
Come in.
A ribbon.
October 1500.
The newborn would become, with time, the glorious Emperor Charles I of Spain and Vof Germany.
Give the word.
Lady Elvira!
Lady Elvira!
The hand of death would soon strike down Queen Isabella, on November 24, 1504.
Send the swiftest horseman you have to carry the news to Flanders.
I hear there is an old friendship between you and Princess Joan.
My father was her Latin teacher.
I often played with the princess.
Perhaps the news will be less painful coming from your lips.
How many days will it take you to reach Brussels?
I'll ride day and night.
"Because of the great heat
"Because of the great heat and because the windows were closed, her dress was undone and her breasts were revealed like two apples from Paradise."
A woman and a tipple by the nipple.
Raise your head, Madam.
Look a little longer in this direction. Like that.
What are they laughing at?
Aida is competing with you, Sir.
- I do not understand, Madam.
- Ask Inés de Bravante.
- Why are you laughing, Lady Inés?
- I'm being tickled.
Ask her who tickles her at night.
Which fortunate gentleman tickles you at night?
Does he make you laugh like that?
What a cheek! How dare you?
My breast guards that secret jealously.
Is it the breast you're painting so carefully which guards your secrets?
Without the necklace.
- It's better with the pink dress.
- I hate pink.
It's my lord Philip who hates pink.
"And turning the other way, ashamed that he could be seen by Diafebus, unable to pronounce another word, he said: I love."
A double step.
Right, left.
Madam.
A messenger has arrived from Spain.
Welcome, Captain.
Speak. What has happened in Castile?
Castile has been orphaned.
Lord de Veyre.
Proclaim court mourning.
"Thank you" is little for your efforts, Captain.
Thank you.
Where is Philip?
The archduke wasn't feeling well.
He went out for air a moment ago.
He'll be in the hunting lodge.
Do you know what this news means?
You and the archduke are now the monarchs of Castile.
Make way for Princess Joan!
Make way for the archduchess!
What is happening?
They're guarding the palace, as usual.
Restrain that dog!
You want it to attack me?
Where is the archduke?
Lord de Veyre, where is the archduke?
It would be best if you did not know, Madam.
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor!
Monster!
- Son of a bitch!
- Mind your tongue!
You're talking like a slut, and I won't be humiliated.
It is I who have been humiliated!
I who have been betrayed!
I feel dirty.
Soiled!
Contaminated!
Mad.
You're mad.
Mad!
Always mad!
It must be madness to love someone as despicable as you!
Who was that?
I have to know who that whore is.
Sire.
I shall give you the news.
Queen Isabella is dead.
The archduchess is now
Queen Joan of Castile, and you are consort.
My mother is dead!
My husband is unfaithful!
My mother is dead!
My husband is unfaithful!
My mother is dead!
My husband is unfaithful!
My mother is dead!
None of this is true.
My imagination!
Whims.
Whims ofJoan the Mad, because I am mad.
I'm mad, am I not?
Yes, I am mad.
Mad, mad, mad!
I'm mad! I'm mad!
Mad!
Inés, come here.
Turn round.
Hold this whore.
- Madam, please...
- Hold her!
Scissors.
- Madam...
- I said I want scissors.
Do not commit an injustice.
What happened?
The queen is suspicious.
She thinks that...
And with her own hands...
Why did you do it?
I hate everything that comes between your body and mine, even the air.
Your behavior is scandalous.
I am sovereign of Burgundy and I've made you king of Castile.
But I also want to be your wife,
- your woman and your whore.
- Am I to be compelled?
I'm more powerful than you, and craftier.
And more shameless, to speak to me in that tone.
It isn't shamelessness.
It's passion.
Uncontrollable passion.
With reason it's rumored that you are mad.
Mad, because I love you to the point of madness?
Mad, because I want you to be mine?
Mad, because I don't want you going to another for what I have in abundance?
Mad, because I aspire to engender and bear your children?
Mad...
Mad with love.
Is that madness?
Joan and Philip traveled to Spain to be proclaimed sovereigns of Castile.
The people gave an enthusiastic welcome to the young monarchs.
Look at her.
She's holding him so tightly it's like she wanted to hurt him.
Untimely bouts of crying, groundless fits of rage, continuous eccentricities.
She chooses the ugliest ladies-in-waiting.
You know why?
Yes, the king is an inveterate womanizer, unworthy of the love the queen bears him.
And unworthy of occupying the throne of Castile.
Philip wants to be rid of a jealous wife and also be rid of one who is queen of Castile.
Don't pretend you don't know.
Admiral Henríquez.
I want you to love Philip as if he too were Castilian.
I want the people to be happy with their king.
The people love you and will love what you love.
I am a doctor, and I can tell you.
- She is not mad.
- The people think otherwise.
They don't give the same meaning to the word "mad" as you do.
Speak to those who have lived with her in Flanders.
They'll tell you what they've seen and heard.
We have visitors. Honest people.
Leave this table free.
Your turn.
A gentleman has requested your services.
Very well.
Welcome.
She pleases you?
Her name is Aixa.
Would you like to see her close up?
What for?
It's a beautiful body.
The body of a woman who risks her life every night coming to dance here.
She risks her life?
- Why?
- For money.
She risks her life so as not to die, to go on living.
Don't you know the Moors are persecuted?
She's a Moor?
A king's daughter.
Would you like to see all of it?
He's been so long.
What if something has happened?
- Your worries are unfounded.
- He's been gone for five hours.
The king forgets everything when he goes hunting.
Hunting!
You think he's hunting?
Undoubtedly.
- Elvira.
- Madam.
Philip is unfaithful.
You like tormenting yourself.
You know that the king has often betrayed me.
Say you won't scold me, and I'll tell you what I've recently learned.
Speak, Madam.
No, it isn't him.
You were saying?
The king goes out every afternoon, and he doesn't come back for at least three hours.
I had my page Hernán follow him.
Where did the king go?
You will never guess.
He went to a mansion known to be a place of sin.
Are you sure it was the king?
Yes, yes, yes!
Would to God
I were mistaken, Elvira!
Madam, think. There can only be the lowest of women in that place.
And what? They're still women like us, aren't they?
Don't they have the same between their legs as we do?
He's here!
He's here!
I was worried.
Joan, please.
- Tell me if you're unfaithful.
- What do you mean?
I know you visit a house of ill repute.
Speak.
Answer me. At least take the trouble to lie.
It's impossible for us to live in peace.
Tell me you're faithful.
Trust your husband.
Tell me you're faithful.
- Tell me and I'll believe you.
- My dearJoan, you worry me.
You ask too much of me with your rages.
I want to be yours.
I want to love you even if you loathe me.
Whatever I say?
Whatever you say.
Your Flemish gentleman.
He tries to conceal who he is, but his appearance gives him away.
Dress as what you are.
Make him dream of heaven, but don't grant it to him.
If I am heaven, how can I refuse it to him? He's relentless.
- Just a little piece.
- This little piece.
- In any case, don't kiss him.
- Not as I kiss you.

- The drill is over.
Well, Commander Polenin.
Do you have an explanation for this?
Comrade Admiral, it's another burn out in the ignition sequence.
Comrade Captain, l will require the names of those responsible... l don't know. Why would l know the name of the jackass that supplied a 30 kopeck insulator to do a 50 kopeck job? l have to fight that before l can fight a war.
Admiral, the boat will be at sea.
On schedule! Before the month is out. l'll give you a name. My name.
Polenin, Mikhail! Captain, K-19.
Write it down!
After you've successfully completed trials on the mechanical, propulsion and navigation systems in the Barents sea, you'll proceed beneath the ice to the launch area here, and test-fire the missile.
My orders were to prepare K-19 for sea trials. They'll begin on schedule.
Until they're complete, to undertake an exercise of this scope... may be, with respect, premature.
There is no doubt in my mind that K-19 is ready to fulfill her mission.
Operation Arctic Circle is no mere exercise.
What is to stop the Americans destroying Moscow and Leningrad?
Only one thing...
...a certain knowledge of destruction in return.
K-19 is that knowledge.
But not until Kennedy is told by his spy planes that we have it.
And it works. l promised Comrade Krushchev that the American President will get the message before the month ends.
Comrade, perhaps Captain Polenin might...
Captain Polenin put his boat and men before the Party.
He will be under your command.
That's all there is to it.
We need to reconnect to shore supply.
Reconnect to the shore supply.
The Captain on the CCP.
- Please.
- Captain.
- What's your name, please?
- Demichev. Torpedo officer, Captain.
May l ask the Captain's name and purpose aboard our boat?
My name is Vostrikov.
Where's Captain Polenin?
Come in.
Yes.
- Morning, Captain.
- Comrade Captain Vostrikov.
That'll be all, Yuri.
Come in, please.
Captain.
With the short lead-in time to sea trials, headquarters wanted your expertise on board.
And l'm pleased to have it. l know this could be difficult for... lt's never difficult to do one's duty, Captain. l was preparing my briefing on the crew and on the boat. l see.
The problem is fitting her out.
My orders said you'd be arriving tomorrow.
Well, the briefing can wait.
Show me the boat.
Yes, of course.
We're finally getting the turbines up to speed.
With luck, in another week we might be able to run a test.
The equipment has not yet arrived,
Comrade Captain.
Noted, Comrade Captain.
The reactor compartment.
How hot are you running it?
We're at 50 per cent for the turbine test.
What is the absorption rate of the rods?
Three per cent above normal.
Where is the reactor officer?
Lieutenant Yashin?
- He's drunk. Do you tolerate this?
- Of course not.
Prepare charges against this man. lnform command we need an immediate replacement.
Yes, Captain.
Lieutenant Yashin is the best reactor officer in the navy.
He's never been drunk on duty before.
We need him, Captain. l urge you to reconsider. l want this boat out of dry dock.
Sea trials begin in two weeks.
The boat isn't ready, Captain.
The problem is Moscow.
They have tours and we have incompetent crews and broken parts.
Sea trials will begin on schedule.
We deliver or we'll drown. ln the history of the Soviet Navy, no sailors have been given such a boat as K-19. lt is the finest submarine in the world.
You have been given the honor to be her crew. l have been given the honor to be your captain.
Without me, you are nothing.
Without you, l am nothing.
Much is expected of us.
We will not fail.
We're cursed.
Easy, easy! Keep it level!
Steady!
Now, down, down.
Coming through. Permission to pass.
- What do you have?
- A new scope for the sonar station.
- Carry on. lnstall it.
- l work on the reactor, Captain.
Where is the sonar officer?
He's on a 24-hour pass.
Captain, l initiated the relief rotation.
- lt's good for efficiency.
- No passes. All leaves are cancelled.
We need everyone to do their jobs.
Yes, Captain.
Comrade Captain.
Lieutenant Vadim Radtchenko.
Reporting for duty. l'm your new reactor officer.
- What was your last posting?
- Nuclear training academy.
- What was your last posting?
- Nuclear training academy.
He's never operated a reactor at sea. l was first in my class.
- Report to the reactor control room.
- Yes, sir.
- That way.
- Thank you.
Captain...
He's qualified. Or command wouldn't have sent him to us.
Officer on deck.
Pavel Loktev. Senior technician.
Stepan Komarov,
Anatoly Subachev, Grigori Dyomin,
Oleg Argunov.
- Show me to the control room.
- Anatoly.
We haven't got all day!
Move it!
Take it! Hurry up! Go, go!
Put it there.
Easy!
Watch out! l have to stop the truck.
They gave me the wrong drugs!
- That goes over here!
- Stop the truck!
Hey! Hey! Stop, stop!
Wrong drugs!
You gave me the wrong drugs!
You idiot! Stop!
Help me! Help me!
- Doctor!
- lt's the Doctor!
He's dead.
Stay till the ambulance comes.
The rest of you, back to work.
Back to work!
Oh, Gavril.
Captain.
Since the solid ballast was loaded we've had a half-degree list to port. l've tried everything.
She won't even up.
Half-degree we can handle.
We'll compensate with sea water ballast till we get back to port. lf we get back to port.
You know what the men are calling this boat?
The Widowmaker.
Five died from fumes sealing the tanks.
Another four in construction and the doctor.
The champagne bottle.
Ten dead. And we haven't left dock. l'm surprised they confide their fears to their commanding officer.
A crew is a family.
The captain is the father.
My own father inspired more fear than he indulged. l was told there are two versions about your father.
One, he was a hero of the Revolution.
Two, he died in the Gulag.
Both are true.
How are those safety checks going on down below, Captain?
Proceeding.
Misha. There you go.
40 centimeters of headroom and he gives half to a rodent.
Yevgeny, wrap this around your private parts.
The gamma rays can...
You should also take your dosimeter
- once a day to the doctor.
- Why?
He reads it and tells you how long you have before your torpedo falls off.
Captain? l'm Gennadi Savran.
Your new medical officer.
What was your last posting?
No, no. l'm the base physician here.
They said there was an emergency.
So here l am.
- Welcome to K-19, Doctor.
- Captain...
We will be back soon?
- l get...
- What?
...seasick.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Misha, please.
- Vostrikov marries a girl...
- Yuri, you promised.
Vostrikov marries a girl with top Party connections.
He knows which fork to use for salad, so they make him a captain.
That's why you've never been promoted.
Be quiet!
We are all good communists here.
- To good communists!
- To good communists!
You're drunk. Sit down!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
A little bit of respect.
Captain Vostrikov does not know you the way l do.
You're still the captain as far as we're concerned.
He's the captain. l'm executive officer. l'm pleased to be with my boys.
My turn.
They say another cosmonaut orbited earth before Yuri Gagarin.
But he was not loyal enough to hold his breath when his life support system gave up.
So now he never existed.
Gagarin was lucky.
Let's hope we are too.
To luck!
Vadim!
- Vadim!
- Katya!
- Katya!
- Vadim!
Vadim!
- Don't worry!
- Don't go!
Please!
Defense Minister Zelentsov.
Admiral Bratyeev... request permission to carry out orders in defense of the motherland.
Carry out your patriotic duty.

Don't worry. lt'll stop once the pressure increases.
Simulate an electrical fire in the galley, please.
Fire in switchbox number 65.
This is a drill.
Repeat. This is a drill.
Repeat. This is a drill.
We're stuck!

Fire has spread to the next compartment.
Simulate electrical failure, compartment four.
Electrical failure, compartment four. This is a drill.
Compartment four, loss of electrical power. This is a drill!
Emergency lights!
Prepare the cable! Let's go!
The fire's out in the galley, Captain.
Too much damage.
Too many casualties.
Simulate flooding, compartment four.
Make them work in the dark. lf this were not a drill the boat would be crippled and half the crew dead.
Let me speak to the officer in charge.
Try it again tomorrow. l only wanted to say how sympathetic l am about the change in command.
These decisions are not always for us to understand.
Thank you, Comrade Suslov.
Still, it's an honor to serve in this boat in any capacity. lndeed. lt's historic.
Excuse me.
Checking the pressurizer?
Yes, Lieutenant.
You know religious icons are forbidden?
Yeah?
This is the future, Pavel.
Cars that never need refueling.
Free power for every family.
Maybe even travel to the planets. lt's a privilege to be a part of this future.
Yes, Lieutenant.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- What's this?
- We only shower on Saturdays.
Action stations. Chemical fire in motor control compartment.
This is a drill.
Watch out!
Fire in the main switchboard,
C2L.
Come on, come on!
Valve rupture in compartment eight.
Torpedo fuel spill in aft torpedo room.
Start the drill again.
Comrades, officers and sailors, remember... the American propaganda will always play on your baser primitive instincts. the American propaganda will always play on your baser primitive instincts.
Greed, lust, individualism. ln American propaganda, you will see how everybody has a car, nice clothes, a nice apartment.
But you will never see the truth behind this lie.
You will not see police dogs attacking demonstrators for civil rights.
You will not see beggars, the homeless, the Negro shantytowns.
You will not see the warmongers who threaten the world with nuclear holocaust.
Stand by to simulate firing torpedo number eight.
- Number eight isn't loaded, Captain.
- l know that. l want you to unload seven and load eight.
- Now, please.
- Captain. lce formations near our depth. l suggest we go deeper and run the drill later.
Negative. lce formations will not be suspended in the event of war.
Unload seven torpedo.
Load eight torpedo.
Unload seven torpedo.
Load eight torpedo. This is a drill.
Will we ever stop?
We need the rest.
Quiet!
Proceed to your action stations immediately.
Come on!
Gauge in gear.
Torpedo withdrawn.
Open number eight.
Traverse torpedo!
Traverse torpedo!
Dimitri!
Come on, help me!
Come on! Don't stop!
Vasily! Vasily!
Two men are injured.
Have them seen by the doctor and start the drill again.
Two men short, Captain.
Have them put the torpedo back in tube seven and start the drill again.
- Traverse torpedo!
- Traversing torpedo!
Going under! Clear!
Attention!
At ease. l was told there was some complaining.
But l said, ''Not my men.
They're the best crew in the fleet.
''They will pull till the last.''
So...any complaints?
There's no complaints here, Captain.
Good. lt's not the men's fault. lt's your fault...the officers.
You have failed to set high standards, to correct their deficiencies. lf you do your job, the men will do theirs.
That is all.

Confirm successful missile launch to fleet command.
Yes, Captain.
This is the Captain.
We have launched our test missile.
All hands stand down from combat stations.
Yes!
Yeah!
You will be in my report for leaving your post.
And you will be in mine!
You endangered this boat and its crew.
200 million Soviet citizens are depending on us, on us , Captain Vostrikov, to save them from nuclear attack.
You risked them too! l took this boat and these men to the edge because we need to know where it is.
This 120 men are a crew now because they achieved something they did not think they could do.
Next time, when it is not a drill, they will go to the edge and past it, and die, if necessary, because that is what their duty demands of them.
You were lucky, Captain.
This time. l hope l'm on another boat when your luck runs out.
Yevgeny!
Come on!
Vasily!
Maxim!
Misha, Yelstin, come on, quick.
Everybody.
Get that laundry out of there!
All the crewmen around the flag.
Get that laundry out of there!
Branan, you asleep?
On the double. Get closer.
Over here.
Everybody, move, yes...
Closer, closer.
Move closer!
Winning team closer.
Dimitri! Smile!
Good.
Everything all right? Problems?
Er...no.
No. Yes.
There was residual condensation in the reactor compartment. l shut down number three generator.
That should reduce the condensation.
- l'm counting on you, you know?
- Yes, Comrade Captain.
Comrade Captain.
Message from command.
Comrade Commander!
The crew is lined up to your order.
We have received a message from Moscow.
They congratulate us on the successful launch of our test missile.
- We have proved our readiness.
- Serving the Soviet Union!
And now they honor us with a new assignment.
K-19 is to assume missile patrol along the eastern seaboard of the United States. along the eastern seaboard of the United States.
This is a mission of critical strategic importance.
The boat will come to full operational status.
Do your best. l expect nothing less.
Hoorah!
Crew dismissed!
He nearly got us killed today.
And for what? To show the men he didn't win his bars marrying a Politburo member's niece.
You're still our Captain, Misha.
And the only one we trust.
- Captain Polenin.
- Yes.
Captain Vostrikov wants to see you in the chart room.
Yes.
Misha!
Command wants us on station as quickly as possible.
Our course will take us past the NATO base at Jan Mayan, and from there to our patrol zone,
400 kilometers off the coastline, between Washington...
...and New York.
- Make turns for 15 knots.
- Speed 15 knots.
Speed 15 knots.
- No contact. Down scope.
- Periscope going down!
Dive the boat.
Andrei, more wine!
You only get one glass.
But because we're the créme de la créme, a glass of red wine with dinner is the headquaters' way of telling us that the K-19's crew has no equal.
No, it's because we're sitting on a pile of uranium.
Red wine gives you strontium.
Or takes it away. Or something.
Something good.
We should be 70 miles from Jan Mayan NATO base.
One mountain. No trees.
Fifteen men, one radio station. l've seen that island many times.
- Misha.
- Yevgeny.
What's the matter? l miss seeing the trees, seeing the sun, the stars.
You'll get used to being underwater.
When l muster out, l'll just work in the coal mine with my brothers.
So it's all the same to me.
A loss of pressure in the primary circuit on the aft reactor.
Check the other sensors.
Confirm loss of pressure, Lieutenant.
Let me through. Watch out!
We've got a leak!
Get me the emergency manual!
Come on! l noticed the pumps were drawing too much power during the turbine tests.
But l didn't think it was serious.
Out of my way!
Move!
The control rods are dropping, Lieutenant.
- Auxiliary pumps.
- Pavel, auxiliary pumps!
- They aren't working.
- Recycle them! l have.
But pressure's dropping.
Confirm.
But the rods will cool it, right?
No! They can't control the reaction by themselves. They need coolant.
Lieutenant, the core temperature is at 400 degrees and rising!
Cut the equalization!
What's the problem?
The primary coolant loop on the aft reactor is ruptured.
- What? How did this happen?
- What difference does it make?
- Answer me. How did this happen?
- l don't know. The core is heating up.
- The mission's over.
- l'll tell you when the mission is over.
Who's responsible for this? l want a name. l'll give you a name.
Vostrikov, Alexei.
Watch yourself, Comrade.
And here's another name.
Radtchenko, Vadim.
The untested reactor officer you put on this boat.
We will fix this problem.
We will continue the mission.
- Surface. Surface the boat!
- Surface the boat!
- How bad is it?
- The leak is in the sealed area.
There's no way to get to it.
The temperature will keep rising till it reaches 1 ,000 degrees.
- And...
- And?
And what?
No one knows. lt could start a chain reaction.
There would be radiation leakage, the core would melt the reactor and start a thermonuclear explosion.
- How long do we have?
- Three or four hours. lt could be less.
Get whoever you need, regardless of rank, and solve this.
- Yes, Comrade Captain.
- Solve this!
That's why you're here, you understand?
Get up!
Get up!
Doesn't he ever get tired of drills?
Let's go! Let's go!
This is the Captain.
We've had a malfunction in the aft reactor.
Measures are being taken to correct the situation.
Remain at your stations.
Read it again.
''ln case of sudden drop in the pressure of the primary circuit
''measures must be taken to reduce precipitation heat release.''
But this doesn't work.
Reflux valve isn't here.
- What measures?
- There are no measures. lt's useless.
The rest is about the backup system which was never installed.
When we reached periscope depth we need to speak to fleet command.
Yes, Comrade Captain.
Why can't we just shut the reactor down?
We have shut it down, but we can't control the reaction anymore.
Suppose we use the forward reactor.
Cross-connect its pumps.
Use them to cool both.
The rupture is not accessible so we can't seal the leak.
And we'd have two reactors out of control.
So...we still have to cool down the reactor.
- Permission to speak, Lieutenant.
- Of course.
The coolant is just distilled water.
We have 30 tones of fresh water on board.
Yes. But, how do we get it to the core?
Pass the schematic.
Kornilov. l need contact with fleet command. Now.
Still trying, Captain.
The air release pipe can deliver coolant deep enough to the core.
We can hack off the valve and pump in the fresh water supply.
We've got 30 tones, Captain.
There are some high grade pipes in the torpedoes. lt's not much to weld.
Thirty minutes at the most.
- And if we can't fix it?
- Hiroshima.
1 .4 megatons including the two reactors and the warheads.
Hiroshima was less, it was a lot less.
Scuttle the boat.
Get the men off in rafts.
We'll not abandon this boat.
Scavenge the pipes.
We'll be ready when authorization comes through. Let's go.
- Have you reached fleet command?
- No, Comrade Captain.
Captain, the long-range antenna feeder has shorted out.
The seal must have ruptured when we submerged.
What's the range of the emergency transmitters? 90 kilometers?
Up to 100 kilometers, Captain.
Core temperature at 490 degrees.
That's it. Take it, Dimitri. l'll take it, Captain.
Make sure no debris gets into the pipes.
Lay out the piping in straight runs.
- Where is the hacksaw?
- May l have your attention?
Men, listen!
The reactor unit will affect the repairs. You will go in teams of two.
- Ten minutes inside, maximum.
- l will go in the first team.
No, l need my executive officer to command.
- Yes, but under these circumstances.
- l am aware of the circumstances! lt's out of the question. l'll go in the first team.
- lt's my duty.
- l am ready to serve, Captain.
Vadim. Vadim!
You will go in with the third team to inspect the repair.
Yes, Comrade Captain.
That is all. Carry on.
Quick! Get something!
Quick!
- Fuel spill!
- Fuel spill in aft torpedo!
Chief? Toolbox.
Feed water system isolated!
- Vent off the feed water tank!
- l've got three more meters here!
Meat...
Just beef, falling off the bone.
Nice and tender. Melts in your mouth.
- Dumplings.
- Dumplings? Dimitri likes...
Hey, Dimitri likes dumplings.
Reactor temperature?
530 degrees.
- Vasily! How long?
- l'd say about 15 minutes, Captain.
Good work!
- Comrade Captain.
- Yes.
Our equipment is prepared and we're standing by to enter.
We have a few minutes.
Take the men up top. Get some air.
Thank you.
You heard him. Get some air.
Lieutenant.
Go on. l was getting married.
You will. You will.
Your hair falls out or something like that.
- lt won't be that bad.
- Ten minutes is nothing.
An hour later and our watch would have been over. lt's fate.
We don't have radiation suits?
The warehouse was out.
They sent chemical suits instead.
- They might as well wear raincoats!
- Misha, l know.
- Tell the men these will help.
- What else can we do? lt's only ten minutes. Ten minutes.
Do what you can and get out?
All right, Anatoly?
Okay? Good.
You'll be fine.
Captain.
Men... this difficult task has fallen to you.
Our fate is in your hands.
Request permission to carry out reactor repair, Captain.
Permission granted.
May God be with you.
What's the core temperature?
725 degrees.
Entering airlock.
Come on, Anatoly. Easy.
How is it in there?
Doctor. Take them to bow torpedo.
Keep them as far away from the radiation as possible.
- How do you feel?
- lt's all right.
Good. Give me his dosimeter.
- His radiation level is low, yes?
- Yes, of course.
Report to me on their condition in an hour.
Good news, Anatoly.
You got a mild dose.
All right. All right. Gently.
- lt's time.
- Comrades, it's time.
Put your mask on.
Hey, hey, come on, let's go.
Ten minutes. Look at me.
Come on, wake up.
Vadim! lt's time to go!
Go, go. lt's all right.
Chief.
Chief Gorelov's gone in his place.
Good boy.
Captain.
You sent for me?
Yes.
We won't fire any missiles. Do you know how to take radiation readings?
Yes, Comrade Captain. l want readings from all compartments.
Yes, Captain.
- Temperature?
- 925 degrees.
How long?
Seven minutes 40 seconds.
Easy, easy.
Sit him down.
Chief!
Chief?
- Gorelov?
- Yes. Konstantin's getting him.
He's getting him.
You did good. You did good.
He's getting him.
Yes, yes. lt's flowing. lt's flowing.
The coolant is flowing.
Tell the Captain the coolant is flowing.
You did it.
Oleg, you did it.
Chief!
You did it, my boy.
You did it, my boy.
You did it.
Yeah, you showed them.
You showed them.
Easy, easy.
Kornilov? Give him a hand.
Gently, gently.
- Come on.
- l'll help you, mate.
Captain!
950! 930. lt's dropping.
- Captain.
- Chief.
This is the Captain. The reactor appears to be under control.
Our thanks to Chief Engineer Gorelov, and the third watch reactor unit.
For a job well done.
Rest, boy.
- Ship's head?
- 2-2-0, Captain.
Turn the boat around.
Come to a heading of 0-4-0.
Forward motor.
Slow ahead.
Starboard 30. Course 0-4-0.
Forward motor. Slow ahead.
Starboard 30.
Steering the course 0-4-0.
Back to base?
With a speed of 5 knots. lt'll take days.
We shall be a ghost ship.
Captain. The men are hungry.
The food is contaminated. Give them whatever you have in tins or foil.
Give them red wine to slow the rate of radiation absorption.
Very well, Captain.
Captain. ln here it's only five units.
But in the reactor room is ten times that.
Turn off the ventilation system.
All compartments shut down main ventilation.
Captain, if we...
We will run the boat with skeleton crews.
Put most of the men on top, as far away from the radiation as possible.
We're 160 kilometers from the NATO base in Jan Mayan.
We could go there.
Get help from the Americans.
Under no circumstances will l abandon my boat or my crew to the enemy.
May l ask then, what is your plan?
We're out of radio contact. lf we stay on our course, fleet command will send the diesels to find us.
Radiation levels are rising too fast.
We're just running on electric motors.
There's no time for that.
They will find us.
As usual the Captain leaves no room for doubt.
Good.
Dimitri.
You're fine.
Good.
You're fine, Yevgeny.
Next.
Good, yes. Excellent. lcons... are forbidden.
Contact. Bearing 0-1-5.
Range 2,000 meters, Captain.
Wait. Wait.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
They're Americans.
Captain?
The jackals have found us. lt's an American destroyer.
Captain?
The Americans are contacting us on the emergency band.
The helicopters reported our men on deck.
The captain is offering assistance.
Tell them we don't need assistance.
We're just getting some air.
- What are they doing?
- Taking pictures of us.
Hey! Hey, spies!
Take a look at this.
- Take a look at this!
- Everybody.
Look at this lovely butt!
Hey, where are you going?
Offering assistance.
They want this boat.
What a victory that would be.
The waters here are over a mile deep.
We could get the men off. Scuttle the boat. They'd have to take us.
Captain Polenin's right. We have life rafts. We can save everyone.
Scuttle the flagship of the fleet?
Present my crew to the Americans for interrogation.
Your duty now is clear.
You must save their lives.
My duty is to defend the state. l will do that to my last dying breath.
You're defending nothing but your own ambition.
Tell that to the men who are dying.
Come on, tell them!
There will be no more talk of surrendering to the Americans. lt is treason. Say it again and l will confine you to your quarters.
And you...you are the Commissar, representative of the party.
- Responsible for crew morale.
- Yes, Captain.
Then act like it. The crew needs you to show courage not fear.
- Fear is contagious.
- Yes, Captain.
- Kornilov.
- Yes, Captain.
Stop monitoring the Americans.
They are the enemy.
Yes, Captain.
Help me.
Please.
How are the men?
How would l know? l don't know about radiation sickness.
Please. l'm giving them aspirin. l'm trying to prevent those that are dying from irradiating those of us that still have some hope.
Pull yourself together.
You are an officer in the Soviet Navy.
Go back and tell them that they're improving.
As you say, you know nothing about radiation sickness.
Perhaps they are.
- Captain?
- Yes.
Readings are rising in every compartment now.
Misha?
- Comrade Suslov.
- What is it?
The radiation is going to kill us all.
The political branch gives you the authority to approve any change of command.
Only in extreme cases of dereliction of duty.
Which this is. He's suffering from radiation poisoning himself.
His judgment is impaired or he would get the men off the boat.
When the moment comes we will know it.
The weld is giving way!
- Core temperature 450 and rising!
- Captain!
The reactor repair has failed.
- Captain!
- Core temperature 450 and rising!
This is the Captain.
All hands below decks.
Prepare for emergency descent.
All hands below! All hands below!
Diving stations! Diving Stations!
Get the bulkhead doors shut! l am not going back down! l am not going down!
All hands to diving stations.
Move, move! Come on!
We have to go now! Andrei!
Andrei, no!
What are you doing?
Diving now! Diving now!
Move! Get in!
- No, Andrei!
- Get in the hatch! lt's an order! Move!
We can't leave him, he'll never make it!
Are the Americans still offering assistance on the emergency band?
- The Captain said not to...
- Check.
They're still there.
Why is he diving?
He's going to cook us.
- No, l won't go!
- Yevgeny!
Prepare the tank! Quickly!
Give it to me!
- Come on, let's go.
- This is bullshit! Put me down!
Fire in aft torpedo!
Aft torpedo! Dimitri? Vasily?
- Report!
- Fire in aft torpedo.
We have no communication.
Our fire team is suiting up.
- Activate fire suppression.
- That would kill everybody in there. lf torpedoes go off, it'll kill everyone. They have breathing kits.
They don't. We took the oxygen for the reactor team.
- Give the fire team some time.
- Activate the system.
The primary wasn't connected. lt must be activated locally.
Go to nine and turn on the system.
You refuse my order? l'll do it myself. lf you leave the command center, l will get help from the Americans and you will be in no position to stop me. lf we can't handle it. l'll switch on the suppression system.
Get the fire out. Quickly!
Why aren't we diving?
Under the authority given to me by the Party you are hereby removed from your post for dereliction of duty. lsolate electrical!
You're wasting time.
Get a team to repair the reactor.
- Torpedo number eight!
- Torpedo number eight!
Stop the water!
Kornilov. Tell the Americans we're evacuating the submarine and will require assistance.
Send the message!
US destroyer.
This is Soviet submarine. Over.
Comrade Admiral.
General Vershinin, KGB. l want to know if your man Vostrikov is a traitor.
All we know is that K-19 has broken off radio contact.
Broken radio contact with us.
A reconnaissance plane has spotted a destroyer shadowing K-19.
An American destroyer.
Vasily?
Vasily.
Captain Polenin to central command.
Repeat. Captain Polenin to central command.
Captain Polenin to central command.
Repeat. Captain Polenin to central command.

- Shut up!
You have no idea what you're doing.
Easy, easy.
- Who is it?
- lt's Dimitri.
Captain Polenin to central command.
- Captain Polenin!
- Do what you can, Vanya.
Central command. lmmediately!
- Five men have...
- Captain Polenin. l have exercised my authority to transfer the boat to your command.
You're our captain and always have been.
We've contacted the Americans.
All we need is your order to abandon the ship.
Good.
Good.
Weapons don't belong here.
Give them to me.
Give me the gun.
And the key for the handcuffs.
Come on.
- Give it to me. This boat's a family.
- Of course, Captain.
And the key for the handcuffs.
- Suslov?
- Captain.
You betray your family.
You betray me.
You're under arrest.
- What?
- Both of you. Get out of my sight.
Take the gun!
Lock them in their quarters! Move! lt is treason.
Misha! Misha!
The fire in compartment ten has been extinguished.
The suppression system was not required.
Unfortunately, there was only one survivor.
Thank you.
- Captain.
- Captain.
We have to dive.
This is the Captain.
Don't order them, Captain.
Ask them.
This is the Captain.
Our situation is desperate.
The reactor repair has failed.
At any moment we could have an explosion which could set off the warheads.
This would destroy the American ship, only... a few kilometers from the NATO base.
Given the current level of tensions between our countries, this could result in horrifying retaliatory attacks on the motherland.
We...we could dive and attempt to repair the reactor, but there are no guarantees. l am standing by.
Secure both bulkhead doors.
Compartment ten isolated.
Compartment nine clear of smoke.
Manned and ready.
Compartment eight, serving the Soviet Union, Comrade Captain.
Compartment seven, standing by to do our duty, Captain.
Compartment five, manned and ready.
Compartment four, we await your orders, Captain.
Compartment one, we are with you, Captain.
Ready to dive, Captain.
- Dive the boat.
- Dive the boat!
Make her depth 300 meters.
Keep five degrees.
- Flood all main ballasts.

Lieutenant Radtchenko. Report.
Captain.
Reactor temperature is 760 degrees and rising.
Lieutenant Radtchenko.
Vadim.
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
How long has he been in there?
- 18 minutes.
- Captain! You can't go in...
- Secure the hatch!
Vadim! l can't see! l can't see!
Captain. l'm sorry.
Open the hatch!
- 280 meters.
- Level off.
Coming through.
970 degrees and holding, Captain.
Open the bulkhead door!
He got a terrible dose.
Who's going in next?
Captain. The temperature's falling.
He did it.
He turned himself into a hero.
Surface the boat!
Blow the main ballast! Rise the planes. Keep 15 degrees by the bow.
Motors at full ahead together.
- You have the conn.
- Full raise. 15 degrees by the bow. l have the conn.
Signal the American Captain as soon as we surface.
Tell him we require his assistance.
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.
- Up periscope!
- Periscope going up!
Men... you have done your duty for the motherland.
The Party is proud of you. l am... l am proud of you.
Captain?
Captain?
Yes, Vadim. l'm here.
The weld, is it holding?
Yes, Vadim.
The weld is holding.
You're a hero, Vadim. Do you hear?
You're a hero.
You are all... all of you... heroes. l had hoped one of our boats would find us.
But the radiation levels are rising too quickly. l have asked the American captain... for his help.
Prepare to abandon the boat.
American destroyer. Bearing 0-4-5.
Range 2,000 meters.
Captain, l have a contact!
- What the...?
- Captain!
- The boat could be in trouble.
- What sort of trouble? l've known Captain Vostrikov personally for half his life.
There isn't a submariner in the navy whose loyalty l trust more.
More than his father's loyalty? l never knew his father.
Captain!
Captain!
When my father went to sea he used to carry these great handfuls of dirt in his pockets.
A bit of the motherland, he said.
He would rather die than betray his country.
Contact me from the bridge when the last lifeboat is loaded. l'll sink the boat.
The Americans won't get her.
That won't be necessary, Captain.
Our submarine S270 has found us.
Yes.
Confirm and out.
Reply from Moscow, Captain, sent through S270.
Your request to remove the men from the boat is denied, Captain.
They're sending a freighter to tow us back to base.
Anything else?
They said... they said to give the men plenty of fresh fruit. l want my men off this boat. l am countermanding Moscow.
You know that will be the end of your career?
They'll send you to the Gulag.
Like your father.
Well, it's a family tradition, isn't it?
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on.
Easy.
Good. Good.
You must be decontaminated, you understand?
We must make you clean. lt's cold but you'll be warmer inside.
You must take your clothes off.
We will decontaminate you. and destroy the clothes.
Then you can go down below.
- Take off your pants.
- Next!
Easy.
Be careful there!
This is your boat, Misha. l lost my position, Yuri, but not my self-respect.
You lost both.
- Where am l going?
- They're taking you across, Vadim. l need my picture of Katya.
- Where is it?
- ln my pocket.
Here you are.
There it is. l can't see! l can't see her!
All men accounted for, Captain.
Why didn't you take command when you had the chance?
Because what they did was wrong.
Prepare the tow, Captain.
Captain.
Get all these men up! Move!
Lev, you're a welcome sight!
Moscow said you were defecting with your boat.
- What?
- They want a list of the men fit enough to testify.
Testify? About what?
About you.
- Alexei.
- Make sure all the lines are secure!
- Come on, you're going home.
- Thank you, Doctor. We did it.
We're going home.
Let's go home.
At every stage of this disaster, which came within moments of being a far greater disaster, the officers and crew did what had to be done.
Seven are now dead.
And nobody knows how many more are dying or how fast.
These are the men who returned home to be interrogated as if a crime had been committed.
Questioned, even while undergoing treatment for radiation poisoning.
Locked up and denied access to wives and families.
But they and their comrades saved K-19.
And maybe... just maybe...they saved all of you as well.
Thank you, Captain Polenin.
- One thing more, please.
- Thank you.
No captain in the Soviet Navy has ever been faced with such decisions.
The fate of the boat, the crew... the fate of the world.
All in the balance.
The navy is my life.
And one thing l know. There can be only one captain of a ship.
The burden of command is on his shoulders and his alone.
None of you... none of you has the right to judge Captain Vostrikov.
You weren't there. l was.
He was our captain.
He was my captain.
And it would be an honor to sail under his command again.
East Germany has agreed to do what the west has been demanding for more than a generation.
After opening up the Berlin wall the government announced it will hold democratic elections. the government announced it will hold democratic elections.
You're not so tall as l remember. lt's good to see you.
And you.
Please. l'm glad you found me.
But today was, in fact, not very convenient.
No, no. lt had to be today.
Your crew. lt was 28 years ago today.
Captain. A toast.
To the men still on patrol.
For their courage l nominated these men for the title
''Hero of the Soviet Union''.
But the committee ruled that because it was not wartime... because it was merely an accident... they were not worthy of the title ''Hero''.
What good are honors from such people?
These men sacrificed not for a medal... but because when the time came... it was their duty.
Not to the navy or to the state but to us.
Their comrades.
And so...
- To comrades.
- To comrades!
Welcome, Colonel Lee.
Welcome to my home.
Make yourself comfortable there, colonel.
Allow me to get to the point, sir.
I have been authorized by
President Lincoln himself...
...with the full blessing of the War Department...
...to offer you full command of the Army with the rank of major general.
This Army being raised to quell this rebellion and to preserve the Union.
I assume this Army is to be used to invade those areas...
...to eliminate the rebellion by force.
Yes, sir, the Federal government has been challenged by these rebels...
...who have been most effective in changing the sentiments of state legislatures...
... challenging our Constitution and challenging our central government.
The attack on Fort Sumter cannot be ignored.
General, my home is right there across the Potomac.
Why, you can see Arlington House from your front door.
My family is spread all over this part of Virginia.
If you invade the South, your enemy territory will be right across that river.
Well, sir, there is no great outcry for secession in Virginia.
It's not a foregone conclusion that
Virginia or Tennessee or Arkansas...
... or Kentucky will join the rebellion.
My friend, may I humbly submit that you're mistaken about Virginia.
As you know, the legislature is convening in Richmond this very day...
...to discuss the very issue of secession.
Now, perhaps you know their mind better than they themselves.
And I regret to say the president's hasty calling up of 75, 000 volunteers...
...to subdue the rebellion in the cotton states...
... has done nothing to ameliorate the crisis. It has only deepened it.
I trust you're not being too hasty yourself, colonel.
This is a great opportunity for you to serve your country.
My country, Mr. Blair?
I never thought I'd see the day the president of the United States...
...would raise an army to invade his own country.
No, Mr. Blair, I cannot lead it.
I will not lead it. No.
I'm sorry to hear you say that, sir.
I fear you're making a most dreadful mistake.
Sir, please convey my deep sense of honor and gratitude to the president...
... but I must decline his offer.
Please tell him.
Please be clear. I have never taken my duties lightly...
... but I have no greater duty than to my home, to Virginia.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, if you are going to succeed at this institution ...
...you have one common goal:
To learn your lessons.
If you are placing your energies elsewhere...
...you will not succeed either with me or in your careers as military officers.
I had hoped you'd see that with a proper grasp of the artillery principles...
... I've laid before you today, you would learn to apply...
...these principles with great effectiveness in your field experiences.
But since you seem unable to grasp these principles...
... I'm forced to conclude I must repeat this lesson tomorrow, word for word.
Word for word.
Major, listen to them.
The leaders of our intellectual future...
... screaming for the destruction of our nation!
Sir, President Lincoln is raising the troops.
I will not stay in a place where my students dishonor their country's flag.
Major, I'm leaving for Pennsylvania tomorrow.
War is the sum of all evils.
But if I know myself, all I am and all I have...
... is at the service of my home, my country.
Your country, Thomas?
Your country, my country. It's all one.
All one, Thomas. All one.
So that in the midst of the searching of souls and the gnashing of teeth ...
...the delegates of this convention ...
... harried by the actions of a belligerent usurper and the radicals of his party...
... have stumbled into secession.
Now God knows, I and many in this room have resisted it.
But how could there be union with a section of the country...
...that wants to impose its will through coercion?
Now that Virginia confronts the armed might of the United States...
...we Virginians have determined that not one spot of her sacred soil ...
... be polluted by the foot of an invader.
Now, in the memory of that great
Virginian, George Washington ...
...who was first in the hearts of his countrymen and calling also...
... upon the memory of his own gallant father, General Light-Horse Harry Lee...
...this convention now calls upon
Robert Edward Lee to take command ...
... of the armed forces of the Citizen Army of Virginia.
Mr. President, gentlemen of the convention ...
... I'm profoundly impressed by the solemnity of the occasion ...
...for which I must say
I was not prepared.
I accept the position assigned me by your partiality.
I would have much preferred had your choice fallen on an abler man.
But trusting to Almighty God, an approving conscience...
... and the aid of my fellow citizens...
... I devote myself to the service of my native state...
... in whose behalf alone will I ever again draw my sword.
We must not fear the final result of this war, but many a loved one will fall ...
... and many a heart throb with anguish ...
... before we can breathe the exhilarating atmosphere of freedom ...
... and feel the sweet assurance of safety and peace once more.
There's nothing in this life more dear to me than my children ...
... except perhaps the memory of your wonderful father.
When you go to Richmond, and wherever this war takes you ...
...you must not fear for us.
We will be with you wherever you go.
Surely goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life.
Now be on your way, and God be with you.
Y'all be coming on back, you hear?
We'll be back, Martha.
I won't forget to write you, sister.
I know there are a thousand brothers leaving a thousand homes...
... and I know we're not the only ones, Mother.
But I've never felt sadder in my life.
Good morning, major.
This just arrived for you.
Cadet Norris, return to the institute.
My compliments to Colonel Smith.
I will be at his office within the half-hour.
Sir.
"You are ordered to report with the corps of cadets to camp instruction ...
...to begin training and organization of the Provisional Army...
...for the defense of the
Commonwealth of Virginia."
My esposita.
Come, before I leave, we must sit...
... read together, the verse.
Here.
Yes, here. Corinthians--
Second Corinthians, chapter five.
I have been thinking about this verse.
"For we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved ...
...we have a building of God.
A house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
O, Almighty God ...
... grant that if it be thy will ...
...thou wilt still avert the threatening danger and bring us peace.
Keep her whom I love in thy protected care.
And bring us all at last to the joy of thy eternal kingdom.
"The Lord is my life. My salvation.
Whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength in my life.
Of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes...
...came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
Though unhost should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear.
The wall should rise up against me.
In this will I be comforted ."
Secession is inexcusable. Southerners and Northerners can still work together.
Slavery will eventually die of natural causes.
But the breakup of the Union will inaugurate wars...
... of a hundred generations in America...
... only to repeat the bloody history of Europe.
As a Christian man, my first allegiance is to God.
Then to my state, the state of Virginia.
Every state has a primal claim to the fealty of her citizens...
... and they justly control their allegiance.
If Virginia adheres to the United States, I adhere.
Her determination must control mine.
This is my understanding of patriotism.
And though I love the Union,
I love Virginia more.
Private Jenkins, because of the high regard with which I hold your father...
...you are free to do as you please. You may return to his new home in Pennsylvania.
It is your decision.
But, if you decide to stay with us...
...you may never again leave. If you do, you'll be treated as a deserter.
Colonel Jackson, sir. Father.
I am a soldier in the 4th Virginia.
And in the 4th Virginia I will stay.
And if needs be, die.
- Then I will take my leave.
- No, sir.
It is I who will leave the two of you to have some time together on your own.
You may have this room for as long as you require it.
Thank you.
Farewell, colonel.
May we meet again in happier times.
And if not in this troubled world may we meet in ...
In heaven.
Order!
- Parade, rest!
- Parade.
Men of the valley.
Citizen soldiers.
I am here at the order of General Robert
E. Lee, commanding all Virginia forces.
On April 1 5 of this year of our Lord, 1 86 1 ...
... Simon Cameron, the secretary of war of the United States...
... sent a telegram to our governor to raise three regiments of infantry...
...to be sent to assist in suppressing the Southern Confederacy.
Governor Letcher's answer is well known to you, but perhaps not his words.
His wire to Washington stated:
"You have chosen to inaugurate civil war.
Having done so, we will meet you in a spirit as determined ...
... as the Lincoln administration has exhibited toward the South ."
Two days later the Virginia legislature were voting for secession.
Just as we would not send any of our soldiers to march in other states...
... and tyrannize other people...
... so will we never allow the armies of others to march into our states...
... and tyrannize our people.
Like many of you, indeed most of you,
I've always been a Union man.
It is not with joy or with a light heart that many have welcomed secession.
Had our neighbors to the North practiced a less bellicose form of persuasion ...
...this day might not have come.
But that day has been thrust upon us...
... like it was thrust upon our ancestors.
The Lincoln administration required us to raise three regiments.
Tell them we have done so.
Dismissed.
Attention, company!
- Good morning, sir.
- Reverend Pendleton.
- How goes it with the artillery today?
- You're just in time for a christening.
The men have decided to name the howitzers: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
I'm sure your men will spread the gospel wherever they encounter the enemy.
Has my son proven a worthy adjutant?
I'm certain Captain Pendleton will prove himself deserving of the family name.
Thrust! Develop! Die!
Captain White.
How fare the scholars of Washington College?
Are they making their transition from books to bullets?
A few more days of drill, and my boys will surpass the cadets of VMI.
Drill, Professor White, drill and drill.
Remember Alexander in Anatolia.
Caesar in Gaul. Napoleon in Iberia.
We march by day, and read Xenophon by night.
- We will be your Greek phalanx.
- Then you must begin with the bayonet.
The bayonet must be for a Virginian what the sarissa was for a Macedonian.
If the Yankees dare set foot in Virginia, we must show them the bayonet.
Train with the bayonet and we shall keep our freedom.
Yes, sir.
Blue, gray, green, even red uniforms.
How are we to know who the enemy is?
You dang fool, you just shoot at the man that's shooting at you!
I thought we was gonna be trained.
I could have done this walking on my own back in Staunton.
I never seen you walk in your life when you didn't have to. Nor me, neither.
What man in his senses would cross his street...
...when he could just be sitting on his front porch?
I done more walking this week than in my life and my daddy's life put together.
Who'll give us fresh shoes when these are but tatters and old bits of laces?
You'll excuse me, gentlemen.
Lieutenant Colonel Stuart reporting for duty.
Colonel Stuart.
- That's an impeccable hat, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Colonel Stuart. You use tobacco?
- No, sir. Not in any form.
Neither do I. I find I like it too much.
Sit down.
I understand from your record that you are West Point, class of '54.
Served since in the cavalry,
Ft. Clark, Texas.
Operations against Apache,
Comanche. You are a native Virginian.
Fought with Longstreet and Ewell, sir.
Nasty business. Merciless climate.
Glad to be home, sir.
The Apache were defending their homes, as we will be defending ours.
If we fight as well as the Apache,
I pity the Yankee invader.
Colonel Stuart, if I had my way we would show no quarter to the enemy.
No more than the redskins showed your troopers. The black flag, sir.
If the North triumphs, it is not alone the destruction of our property.
It is the prelude to anarchy, infidelity...
...the loss of free and responsible government.
It is the triumph of commerce.
The banks, factories.
We should meet the invader on the verge of just defense...
... and raise the black flag. No quarter to the violators of our homes and firesides.
Our political leadership is too timid to face the reality of this coming war.
They should look to the Bible.
It is full of such wars.
Only the black flag will bring the North to its senses and rapidly end the war.
Well, colonel.
One way or the other, the South will give them a warm reception.
You'll be in charge of the cavalry in the Harper's Ferry district.
Your experience and your zeal will be invaluable.
Thank you, sir.
And, colonel ...
... know that I will tell my men always to gallop toward the enemy...
... but trot away.
"Trot."
The ratification vote for secession is in.
Reporting from all the counties of
Virginia, the vote is 4-to- 1 in favor.
And I'm proud to report that the vote in the Shenandoah Valley...
... is 3 1 30 in favor, 1 0 against!
In my own Rockbridge County, only one person voted against leaving the Union.
It must have been the village idiot!
Soldiers! Commanding
General Johnston's orders:
"General Beauregard is being attacked at Manassas Junction ...
... by overwhelming forces."
We have been ordered to cross the Blue Ridge to his assistance.
Every moment now is precious...
... and the general hopes his soldiers will step out and keep closed ranks.
Well, this march is a forced march to save our country.
You must get some rest, sir.
I'll rest easier when Pendleton and the artillery make it up this mountain.
They'll make better time tomorrow, sir.
It'll all be downhill.
You'll trust me to wait for the guns, sir?
Dr. McGuire.
You're an excellent practitioner, and I believe I will take your prescription.
No fires, no tents.
Just like I always dreamed it'd be.
You suppose the Virginia legislature was gonna buy you your own personal tent?
That's fine for now.
You'll be humming a different tune when it's raining, you're all covered in frost...
... or you need me to dig you out of a snowdrift.
So damn dark the bats run into each other.
Old Hickory's just getting us fit for the fighting.
Old Hickory, Old Jack, Old Blue Light.
How many names you got for the old man, anyway?
Them VMI boys come up with the choice one.
They calls him "Tom Fool" when he's looking the other way.
I'll be a fool if I listened to you all livelong night.
Old Tom Fool. That name ought to stick to him like a tick on a mule.
That's it! Step lively! Two at a time!
As quick as you can.
No dilly, no dally.
One foot forward, then the other.
Nothing pretty, nothing fancy.
Into the train. Do it lovely, do it ugly, all the same to me.
- Colonel Jackson.
- Colonel Trimble.
- I understand you're a train man.
- Baltimore and Ohio.
Spent most of my life building lines, and the past six months tearing them up.
No use in leaving them in fine fettle with a meddling Yankee.
If you'll excuse me, sir.
Got to move these men where they'll do the most damage to the enemy.
Now that's the finest dressed man in the whole Confederate Army.
In you go! Up and over!
Through the brush and in the clover.
Crowd on in. Move it over.
Dear Lord:
This is your day.
And you have admonished us to keep it holy.
If it is your will that we fight this day...
...then your will be done.
I ask your protection over Anna...
...your faithful servant, my loving wife.
I ask you to shine your face down upon her,
Lord, on her 30th birthday...
... and fill her heart with the conviction of how much she is loved and missed ...
... by her husband.
Dear Lord:
You have called me to this place, in this hour, far from my home and my loved ones...
... but I know it is your will that leads me here.
If it is your will that we fight today,
I am ready, Lord. Thy will be done.
It is your sword I will wield into battle.
Your banner I will raise against those who would desecrate our land.
And if it is my time to be with you, Lord ...
...then I come to you with all the joy in my heart.
Amen.
That's General Bee's brigade!
Inform General Bee the
1st Virginians are on the field.
Ask him, can he hold long enough for me to deploy my men?
Yes, sir! I'll ask him!
They may not hold, gentlemen.
We must assume they cannot.
- Mr. Smith.
- Sir?
Instruct Imboden and Stanard to position their batteries in the center of the crest.
I want the 4th and the 27th regiments stationed as support.
I want the 5th Regiment posted to their right, the 2nd and 33rd to the left. Understood?
Counter battery fire!
Eight hundred yards!
- Shell! Five-second fuse!
- Fire!
Counter battery fire. 800 yards.
Shell, five inch. Five-second fuse.
Fire!
General! Our line on Matthew's Hill has broken. They are beating us back.
Then we must give them the bayonet!
1 st Brigade, move up to a position just below the crest of the hill. And stay low!
Rally, men! Rally!
Look!
There is Jackson, standing like a stone wall.
Let us determine to die here today and we will conquer.
Rally behind the Virginians!
Fix bayonets.
- Fix bayonets!
- Fix!
Fill in there--!
Instruct the men to lay down!
Hug the ground!
- Lie down, men!
- Privates! First rank, lie down!
Second rank, kneel!
They are coming, boys.
Wait till they get close before you shoot.
Hold your lines!
Halt!
Hold your fire!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Fire! Reload!
- Rise up!
- Quickly, boys!
Rise up!
Quickly, men! Quickly!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Reload! Reload, men!
Come on, boys!
Quick and we can whip them!
- Easy, men. We have no orders to advance!
- Get back in the ranks!
Steady, men. Steady!
Damn it.
Charge!
It's Cummings' boys.
- What are they doing?
- Easy, Mr. Pendleton. Easy.
Good to have your dander up, but discipline wins the day.
About-face! About-face, men!
Aim! Fire!
For God's sakes, forward!
General, sir, the day is going against us.
If you think so, sir, you had better not say anything about it.
Rise up, rise up!
Rise up, Virginia!
Stand up, you men! Stand up, you free men!
We're gonna charge them.
We're gonna drive them to Washington!
Stand up, Virginia!
1 st Brigade...
... reserve your fire...
...till they come within 50 yards...
...then fire!
And give them the bayonet!
And when you charge...
...yell like Furies!
- Ready! Aim!
- Aim!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Charge bayonets!
Charge!
Press on! Press on!
I surrender! I surrender!
General?
How is it you can keep so serene...
... and stay so utterly insensible...
...with a storm of shells and bullets raining about your head?
Captain Smith ...
... my religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed.
God has fixed the time for my death,
I do not concern myself with that...
... but to be always ready, whenever it may overtake me.
That is the way all men should live.
Then all men would be equally brave.
Preliminary reports for the brigade, sir.
1 1 1 dead.
Three hundred seventy-three wounded or missing.
And if I may ask, sir, how's your hand?
Just a spent bullet. No more than a scratch really, Mr. Pendleton.
I'm more than pleased with the part performed by the brigade during the action.
Through the blessing of God ...
...they met the thus far victorious enemy and turned the fortunes of the day.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Tomorrow's a new day.
- Evening, general.
- Evening, sir.
Oh, Mr. Pendleton?
Thank you for the report.
I will never forget these men.
We must never forget them.
The universe itself is subject to rules, to law.
The super-abounding life lavished on this world of ours...
... is proof...
...that the play of infinite freedom ...
... is here to help work out the will of infinite law.
The nature of the universe demonstrates...
...that freedom can only exist...
... as part of law.
Pardon me, Professor Chamberlain ...
... but how does the study of philosophy intersect with real life?
If freedom can only exist as a part of law...
... how can we continue to tolerate slavery protected by law?
Lawrence, I know.
How?
I've noticed the way you've been looking into the children's room each night.
Blue.
Why blue uniforms? It should be red.
- Like the English, the color of blood.
- Are you angry with me?
Lawrence, my darling Lawrence.
Do you remember when you were thinking of being a missionary?
And you wrote me saying that you wished your little wife...
...was willing for you to take whatever course you thought best...
... and was ready to help you in it with all her heart?
"Little wife."
How could I ever have called you that?
Your spirit is vaster than oceans.
Then you wrote back.
And I have never forgotten what you said.
You said, "Well, dear, she is willing ...
... and she feels that you know better about the matter than she does."
But now...
... I never think I know better than you.
I couldn't bear for you to feel that you must forever remain at a stand ...
...just because you're married.
I always want to help you on in your excelsior striving.
But I had a dream about you, Lawrence.
Last night.
While you were away, offering your services to the governor.
I saw you in my dream.
There were boys in blue marching past.
Some of the boys that we know.
And there you were...
... riding ahead of them on a great, white horse.
Fanny, my love, I felt I had to go.
I offered the governor my services, wherever he wanted to place me.
I thought he'd probably order me to an officer.
Speeches, administration.
Lawrence...
... I know you.
When you do a thing, you do it à l'outrance.
- So? He gave you a commission, didn't he?
- They need serving officers.
Five new regiments are being formed now.
Maine has already sent 1 5.
How could I refuse?
Poor Lawrence, damn you, you'll be good at it too.
You'll be good at soldiering just like you're good at everything else. So go.
Go do your duty to your country's flag ...
... go on and get your medals for bravery, go and get yourself killed.
That poem of Lovelace.
That beautiful, horrible, damnable, lovely, sad poem.
I think that you recited it in my dream.
Lovelace. "Off to the English Civil War"?
I would not dare presume to quote it now.
Tell me not, sweet, I am unkind
That from the nunnery
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
To warlike arms I fly.
True, a new mistress now I serve
The first foe in the field
And with a sterner faith embrace
The sword, a horse, a shield.
Yet this inconstancy is such
As thou too shalt adore.
I could not love thee, dear, so much
Loved I not honor more.
You will be wounded.
You will be changed by the horrors of it.
But you will come home.
I believe that, my love.
You will come home.
Come in.
You must be Mr. Lewis.
There's some that calls me Uncle Jim.
Some calls me Big Jim.
Some folks just calls me Jim.
I don't suppose you've heard any of the names I get called?
I heard Stonewall once.
That name properly belongs to the
1 st Virginia Brigade, not to me.
- They were the ones who earned it.
- Some folks says otherwise.
Folks say men can't fight without nobody up front to lead them on.
- I'm told you're a first-rate cook.
- Yes, sir.
They wasn't lying, told you that.
Whatever you likes to eat, I can cook it.
Pan-fry, griddle, boil, bake. Roasted.
And I understand you're from Lexington.
You come highly recommended to me, Jim.
Lexington is my home, general.
Same as yours.
If I could do my share in defending my home...
... I'd be doing the same as you.
I heard it was Napoleon hisself said:
"An army can't march but on its stomach ."
Well ...
If you love your country...
...fear the Lord ...
... and have no trouble getting up at
4: 00 in the morning, the job is yours.
Yous got yourself a deal, general.
Sir.
My darling esposita.
Welcome to Winchester.
Thomas.
- Come in out of the cold.
- Why, thank you.
I have been thinking, Thomas...
...that it may have been a blessing the Battle of Manassas was fought on my birthday.
Why is that?
In our old age, you will never forget it.
I will forget my own before I ever forget yours.
Oh, Anna.
Anna.
What is it, Tom?
What?
Everything in this life seems so fragile.
So temporary.
When we are separated, I fear...
... I will never see you again.
I fear we may never have a child.
I fear I may lose you if we dare to have a child.
I know I should trust in the Lord ...
... but then I see the face of my dear mama...
... of my first wife, dead and cold.
With our dead daughter.
Dead before she could draw her first breath in this world.
And I am afraid.
And I am afraid to feel happiness.
Afraid to hope for it again.
I am afraid of God's judgment.
We serve a loving God, Thomas.
We are in each other's arms.
We are together, and we are happy together.
And is our love not proof of his?
We must not fear, Thomas.
We will survive this war.
And we will have a child.
So help us, God.
This is a hell of a regiment.
Men of the 20th Maine Regiment of Volunteers...
...this is your commanding officer,
Colonel Adelbert Ames.
Quiet! Quiet!
You do not cheer an officer.
You salute him.
20th Maine, I commend you for the enthusiasm ...
...that has made you volunteer for service in Lincoln's Army.
I can see that many of you are strong and fit.
We Maine men know that life in the woods of Maine...
...toughens the muscles and stretches the sinews.
I've no doubt many of you have become good shots by hunting deer.
But tough muscles and skillful shooting are not enough to make a soldier.
That requires discipline.
Major Gilmore tells me you are in the habit of holding discussions with your officers.
That will cease from now.
An officer's orders are to be obeyed instantly and without question.
This regiment must learn to move as one man.
Otherwise we will all be killed.
Sergeant Tom Chamberlain reporting for duty, sir.
Tom, what on earth--?
What are you doing?
I signed up, Lawrence, I'm in this regiment.
I'm coming with you.
Did Father approve?
How will he run the farm?
Once he heard you were colonel, he couldn't say no.
Besides, you know him, he'll be all right. They both will.
I'm giving them one less thing to cuss at.
Mama said so many prayers for the both of us, we got nothing to worry about.
Well, I guess I have one more responsibility.
I have to look after you.
Me?
Lawrence, Mama told me to watch after you.
Line of battle consists of two lines of men, one behind the other...
... so that while one line fires, the other reloads.
Behind them is a line of file closers.
Lieutenants and sergeants.
But two lines make a regiment unwieldy on the move...
... so we need to switch to column of fours.
We need to be able to change from column of fours to line of battle...
... and back again quickly. lt is not difficult to move from line of battle into column of fours. lt is harder to move from column of fours into line of battle...
...and if we're called to make that move, it will be when we're under fire.
You understand how important it is that these moves are learned so thoroughly...
...that the men can perform them in their sleep.
Company...
... halt!
Company, front!
Order arms!
Well done, colonel. That's a beginning.
But that move must be practiced and practiced and practiced.
Another month and we'll be ready.
But we leave for Washington tomorrow.
Shoulder arms!
Company, forward march!
Morning to you, sir.
Colonel Ames sent me to get you.
- Said you might be needing a drop of this.
- Thank you ...
Kilrain, sir. Sergeant Kilrain.
Glad to be of service.
You know, colonel ...
...the boys...
We've been watching you, sir, that we have.
You've learned fast.
Becoming a pleasure to serve under you.
Yes, well ...
Are you a veteran, sergeant?
Aye, sir. I suppose you could say that.
Did me duty in the regular Army for a while.
Did the great long walk with General Scott, down south of the Rio Grande.
Some men you fought with are on the other side. Almost all of their generals.
Oh, it gets worse than generals, colonel.
Some of the lads that I left Ireland with are on the other side as well. Imagine that.
We left together to escape a tyranny...
... and end up shooting at one another in the land of the free.
I, too, have friends on the other side, sergeant.
And enemies.
Yes, sir.
No shortage of enemies, that's for sure.
Forward!
Rest!
Throughout the broad extent of the country...
...through which you have marched ...
... by your respect for the rights and property of others...
...you have always shown you are soldiers, not only to defend ...
... but able and willing both to defend and protect.
You've already won ...
... a brilliant reputation throughout the Army of the whole Confederacy.
And I trust in the future by your deeds in the field ...
... and by the assistance of the same kind providence who has favored our cause...
...you will win more victories and add luster to the reputation you now enjoy.
You already gained a proud position ...
... in the future history of this...
... our second war of independence.
I shall look with anxiety to your future movements...
... and I trust whenever I shall hear of the 1 st Brigade...
... on the field of battle...
... it will be of still nobler deeds achieved and higher reputation won.
In the Army of the Shenandoah, you were the 1 st Brigade.
In the Army of the Potomac, you were the 1 st Brigade.
In the 2nd Corps of this Army, you are the 1 st Brigade.
You are the 1 st Brigade in the affections of your general.
And I hope by your future deeds and bearing you will be handed down to posterity...
... as the 1 st Brigade...
... in this, our second war of independence.
Godspeed!
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!
Gentlemen.
Excuse us, General Burnside...
... General Hancock has information you may find useful.
Yes, General Hancock, a pleasure.
Sumner, come.
We have visitors.
Sir, General Hancock reports the river can be forded the short way upstream.
There'll be no difficulty crossing. With your permission, we can move right away.
General Hancock, I appreciate your efforts at reconnaissance...
... but this possibility has been considered and rejected.
The pontoons will be here any time.
We'll cross with not only the men but also the wagons and supplies.
It would be foolhardy to send the men without the wagons, the big guns--
Excuse me, am I correct in my observation ...
...that there's little force opposing us across the river?
Yes, you're absolutely correct.
For once we seem to have caught
Lee by surprise.
Then, sir, if I may suggest, isn't it possible Lee is moving this way?
Certainly he's aware of our intentions. If we could occupy the town with infantry...
... it would make our job much easier when the bridges do arrive.
Yes, but that's risky. Those men could be cut off. In this weather?
It snows one day, melts the next.
The river could rise unexpectedly.
It will be best, I assure you, if we wait until the entire Army can cross together.
General Burnside, if we don't cross the river soon ...
... General Lee will make every effort to stop us.
He will not let us move toward Richmond unopposed.
Where are General Jackson's forces now?
Shouldn't we attempt to occupy
Fredericksburg ...
... and possibly the Heights beyond now, while we have it for the taking?
Please allow me, sir, to at least send
General Hancock's division across the river.
Surely they can carry enough supplies with them ...
... and the artillery from this side can protect them against any advance by Lee.
Gentlemen, we will cross this river when the bridges arrive and not before.
I do not have the luxury of deviating from the larger plan.
The president approved my strategy, and I shall stick to it.
Once this Army is across the river, we will advance on Richmond in force.
We must not allow him ...
...the luxury of attacking us as divided and separated units as he's done in the past.
And I will not make the same mistake as my predecessors.
So no, General Hancock.
You will stay on this side until the pontoons are in place...
... and the entire Army crosses together.
An irresistible, impregnable force.
Did you know George Washington spent his boyhood not far from here?
And across that river, he's supposed to have thrown that silver dollar...
... and cut down that cherry tree.
That may be so, Mr. Taylor, but it has an even greater significance for me.
It's where I met my wife.
That's something these Yankees do not understand, will never understand.
You see these rivers and valleys and streams...
... and fields, even towns?
They're just markings on a map to those people in the war office in Washington.
But to us, my goodness, they're birthplaces and burial grounds.
They're battlefields where our ancestors fought...
... places where you and I learned to walk, to talk and to pray.
Places where we made friendships and, oh, yes, fell in love.
And they're the incarnation of all our memories, Mr. Taylor...
... and all that we are.
All that we are.
- What place is this?
- Chancellor's Crossing.
We're another two hours or so from Fredericksburg.
We'll rest here for a short time.
Yes, sir. I'll see what the good folks can provide.
The general be fixing to eat something warm?
No, no, Jim.
We gotta ride on straight through to General Lee.
Don't want to get all warmed up just to feel the cold all over again.
You never seem to mind the cold much.
I minds it. I just don't shows it.
Now, Little Sorrel, I know this corn look poorly...
... but it sure beats no corn at all.
You heard from your family lately?
Ain't heared much for some time.
Yankee mail used to move quicker than Secesh mail.
Lord, from where you sit you can see the great distance...
...that separates our Southern men from their wives and children.
We pray that you watch over our families.
Lord, I ask you to watch over
Jim Lewis' family...
... over his friends, his loved ones, wherever they may be.
Lord, I know you sees into the hearts of all men ...
...just like you sees into the heart of old Jim Lewis.
And, Lord, I know there's no lying or deceitfulness...
... can hide from you.
You find the truth ...
... in the bottom of the deepest pit of darkness.
There be no hiding from your truth and your ever-watchful eye.
Amen.
How is it, Lord?
Can you explain something to this old Virginia man?
How is it a good Christian man ...
... like some folks I know...
... can tolerate their black brothers in bondage?
How is it, Lord, they don't just...
... break them chains?
How is it, Lord?
My heart is open and aching.
And I wants to know.
Lord, speak to us.
Speak to your children.
Speak to Jim Lewis and Thomas Jackson, your humble and obedient servants.
Speak to all of us.
Our hearts are open.
Lord, you show us the way, we will follow.
Amen.
- Jim?
- Yeah.
What is the status of your family?
About half is free, half slave.
That's counting all the cousins and such.
You must know that there are some officers in this Army...
...who are of the opinion that...
...we should be enlisting Negroes as a condition for freedom.
General Lee is among them.
That's what they says around the camp.
Your people will be free, one way or another.
The question is, if the Southern government will have...
...the good sense to do it first and soon.
And in so doing seal a bond of enduring friendship between us.
That's what they says, general.
God's plan is a great mystery.
It will be revealed to us.
That's all the fodder you get tonight.
We's going to a country where there's nothing more for an animal to eat...
...than there is what's in the palm of my hand.
General Lee, fine day, sir.
We got batteries all along that hill, covering our front to the river.
Strong anchor on the north.
Tomorrow, guns will be positioned in those trees to the south.
We'll be able to cover the entire open ground, all of it.
General, they gonna come at us here?
Colonel Alexander...
... Federal troops amassed across that river are watching us prepare for them.
If I were General Burnside,
I wouldn't attack here.
I'd move back upstream, come across from above us.
Burnside is not a man with the luxury of flexibility.
He's being pushed from behind by loud voices in Washington ...
... by newspapers who demand quick action.
But we're here, and so he will attack us here.
We got batteries pointing from all angles.
They cross that canal, that'll slow them down.
We shall hit them from all sides.
No, sir, a chicken couldn't live on that field.
General Hood, I've often wondered how it is that...
... Texas men, the most independent-minded in this Army of irascibles...
... have agreed to serve under a Kentuckian.
I have often wondered the same.
General Gregg, have you settled your differences with General Jackson?
No, General Hill, I have not.
Have you?
No, sir.
Tell me, general ...
... do you expect to live until the end of this war?
I do not know...
... but I'm inclined to think I will.
I expect I will be wounded.
And you, general?
I do not expect to live to see the end of this war.
Nor can I say that without victory
I would desire to do so.
- Get up.
- Get up.
Sir?
Yes, Mr. Pendleton, you may enter.
Forgive me, general.
There's a letter for you.
Courier was running a little slow today, but I thought you'd want to see it.
Yes, thank you.
Good night, sir.
My own dear father:
As my mother's letter has been cut short by my arrival...
... I think it but justice that I should continue it.
I know that you are rejoiced to hear of my coming.
And I hope that God has sent me to radiate your pathway through life.
I am a very tiny little thing.
I weigh only eight and a half pounds...
...and Aunt Harriet says I am the express image of my darling papa.
My mother is very comfortable this morning.
Your loving daughter.
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
They've occupied all the buildings along the riverfront.
We will be lining up those pontoon bridges through a hail of lead.
Once across, the Rebs are sure to make us pay for every block.
Beyond the town is the canal which cuts across this open field ...
... a field we'll have to cross to reach their entrenchments on Marye's Heights...
... another difficult obstacle in the face of artillery fire.
Down to our left we could burst through ...
...turn Jackson's lines, push him back, trap Longstreet on top of the hill ...
... surround him.
It's possible.
Turn Jackson's lines?
No, general, we'll meet them head on.
And it will be a bloody mess.
We'll march up to that hill there...
... and we'll eat their artillery fire all the way across this field.
We'll be able to look at ourselves and say:
"We're good soldiers.
We did what we were told ."
If we're not successful, we can say it was a good plan, but there were contingencies.
You can go back to your hometown ...
... and tell the families of your men they died doing their duty.
The Rebs have fortified the high ground up the river.
And anyway, there are strong currents and obstacles to a crossing there.
Below Fredericksburg the river is too wide.
And our earliest forces are clear down to Port Royal.
Fredericksburg is now the only place we can cross.
If Burnside doesn't cross here, he might as well resign.
That wily gray fox has outmaneuvered our command again.
And there's going to be hell to pay.
Hurry up! Let's go!
Pick your targets, boys!
Commence firing!
Them Yankees is coming, sure as Jesus.
They got two pontoons across that river.
We got to get you and them children out of here.
Stop fussing with me. Get your family ready. We'll leave together.
Miss Jane, us done talked this over, and we decided to stay here...
... and look after the house.
No use saying no more.
Martha, I won't leave you to the mercy of those blue devils.
Miss Jane, you know they ain't gonna be bothering us colored folks.
If we go with you, there won't be any food left in the pantry when we come back.
And we need to eat, same as you.
- Pastor Lacy, we must run to our lines.
- There's no time.
The streets are raining iron.
To the basement.
Anybody hurt?
Sam?
Easy.
Sam!
Can you get up? Easy! Easy!
Mother? Are you here?
Oh, praise be! It's young John!
- We're down here in the cellar!
- The door is blocked!
I'll go around to the side!
Children, y'all stay right here.
Mama'll be back.
Come out! There's an ambulance out front.
The enemy is crossing the river. Hurry!
- No! Martha, I won't leave without you.
- I done told you, I'm staying.
Off with you then.
Come on, Martha.
Stay in the basement!
Get the bayonets!
May God be with them.
May he strengthen their hearts and their arms for the coming struggle.
Give them the victory.
Can I be of service to you fine Northern gentlemen?
Is this your master's place?
This is my place.
Children!
Sorry to have to bother you, ma'am.
Come on, let's go.
Go back inside. Hurry up.
Put a stop to this at once!
Where are the officers?
Drop that, soldier. Now!
Get a message to Couch, to Hancock.
This will not be tolerated!
This is an army, not a rabble!
General Longstreet, show us where your troops are positioned.
Yes, sir. We're anchored on the north by Anderson's division ...
... up on the bend in the river and Ransom's division ...
... along and below the ridge of Marye's Heights...
...with Cobb's brigade dug in down on the road behind that stone wall.
Now, to their right, is General McLaws...
... and further down in the woods and to the right, Pickett and Hood.
General Hood is my right flank.
He's connected in those heavy trees over there with General Jackson's left.
Up here on the Heights, we have the Washington artillery...
... Colonel Alexander's batteries and support.
It's a strong line, general.
Very well.
General Jackson, would you please extend the line for us?
General A. P. Hill is on the left, adjoining General Hood.
Position is supported by General Taliaferro and General Early.
Now to the right flank and behind is D. H. Hill.
We've built a road behind our lines running the entire length.
We can move troops as is necessary.
If the enemy penetrates our lines at any point...
...the reserves, Taliaferro and Early, can move rapidly to a new position.
If the enemy attempts to cut our center...
... or if General Pickett is pressed, we can change positions, sir.
Good, very good.
General Stuart, are you in a strong position for protecting ...
... General Jackson's flank?
Oh, yes, sir.
We're covering the enemy from the river, as far out as our own lines.
If the Yankees move down river or threaten to turn General Jackson's line...
...we can block their advance until the line is moved.
Very well. Gentlemen, these deployments are sound.
The rest is in God's hands.
- Amen.
- Amen.
In the Roman civil war...
... Julius Caesar knew he had to march on Rome itself...
...which no legion was permitted to do.
Marcus Lucanus left us a chronicle of what happened.
How swiftly Caesar had surmounted the icy Alps...
...and in his mind conceived immense upheavals, coming war.
When he reached the little Rubicon, clearly through the murky night...
...appeared a mighty image of his country in distress...
... grief in her face...
... her white hair streaming from her tower-crowned head.
With tresses torn and shoulders bare, she stood before him and sighing, said:
"Where further do you march? Where do you take my standards, warriors?
If lawfully you come, if as citizens, this far only is allowed."
Trembling struck his limbs.
And weakness checked his progress, holding his feet at the river's edge.
At last he speaks.
Oh, thunderer...
... surveying great Rome's walls from the Tarpeian rock.
Oh, Phrygian, house gods of Iulus...
... clan and mysteries of Quirinus who was carried off to heaven.
Oh, Jupiter of Latium, seated in lofty Alba and hearths of Vesta.
Oh, Rome, equal to the highest deity, favor my plans.
Not with impious weapons do I pursue you.
Here am I, Caesar...
...conqueror of land and sea, your own soldier everywhere...
...now too if I am permitted.
The man who makes me your enemy, it is he will be the guilty one.
He broke the barriers of war and through the swollen river...
...swiftly took his standards.
When Caesar crossed the flood and reached the opposite bank...
...from Hesperia's forbidden fields, he took his stand and said:
"Here, I abandoned peace and desecrated law.
Fortune, it is you I follow.
Farewell to treaties.
From now on, war is our judge."
Hail Caesar.
We who are about to die salute you.
General Zook!
Move your brigade forward!
Left wing, forward march!
Steady, boys, steady.
You'll soon be forward.
Is that to be
General Meagher's position?
He's enjoying the privilege of an officer.
Protecting the rear.
He's got a lame knee, for pity's sake.
Fair enough.
Someone's got to keep Burnside company.
Quiet in the ranks!
Shoulder arms!
Colonel.
20th Maine to the front.
Battalion! Shoulder arms!
Shoulder arms!
Left face!
High-file right...
... march!
Come on, boys! Show them the cold steel!
Irish brigade, move out!
Irish brigade, at the double-quick...
...forward march!
Front and center!
Double column, boys! Form up!
Forward!
Keep moving!
That's the Irish.
What are those boys doing fighting in blue?
Don't they know we're fighting for our independence?
Did they learn nothing at the hands of the English?
They're Reb Irishmen. They're our brothers.
They've been misled to their fates.
Do your duty!
Steady, men! Steady!
Men, do your duty!
Battalion, halt!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Load them up, boys, load them up!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Load! Load! Load!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Fall back! Fall back, men!
Now move! Move!
Go to hell! Go to hell and damnation!
Move, boys!
Lie down here!
Lie down and load!
Load!
Load and fire!
Quickly!
Blaze away, lads!
Do it, boys!
Fire, boys.
Keep firing, men! Keep firing!
Fall back!
Fall back, lads!
Every man for himself!
Fall back, men!
- Caldwell's brigade, forward! Now!
- Yes, sir!
At the double-quick! March!
- General Armistead.
- Afternoon, General Pickett.
- See that last charge by Meagher's brigade?
- Those fellas deserved a better fate.
Their bravery is worthy of a better cause.
My heart stood still as I watched it.
I would not have believed that mortal men ...
... could march into the face of such destruction.
General Longstreet...
...those people committing more fresh divisions at your lines...
...their mounting numbers may overwhelm our defense.
Sir, if they put every man they have on the field to approach me...
... give me plenty of ammunition,
I'll kill them all before they reach my line.
Nevertheless, we must be prudent, general.
We must never ignore the unknown or the unpredictable.
Yes, sir. I'll take the necessary measures.
Orders!
Send orders to Ransom's Tar Heels to advance his division ...
... and to Kershaw to bring up his brigade to support Cobb at the wall.
Yes, sir!
Forward, men!
Load! Five-second fuse!
She burst! The barrel burst!
- Stretcher!
- General Lee, you all right, sir?
- Sergeant! Call for the surgeon! Quickly!
- Here I go. Help me up, boys.
It's not yet our time, gentlemen.
Not yet our time.
Brigade, halt! Form by battalion!
Pass them forward.
Just load and pass them forward!
20th Maine...
... halt! lt is not difficult to move from line of battle into column of fours. lt is much harder to move from column of fours into line of battle...
...and if we're called to make that move, it will be when we are under fire.
You understand how important it is that these moves are learned so thoroughly...
...that the men can perform them in their sleep.
Seems a terrible long distance up that hill.
It'll be shortened by those in the front.
Begging your pardon, sir.
The only thing that'll be shortened by those in front is their lives.
God help us now.
- Colonel, take care of the right wing.
- Yes, sir. I'll watch them, sir.
Hail Caesar.
We who are about to die salute you.
20th Maine!
- Forward!
- Forward!
- March!
- March!
By the right of companies, to the front! March!
Right of companies to the front! March!
Form a line, boys! Form a line!
Form up a line! Form up a line!
Come on, boys!
Dress to the colors!
Come on, boys.
Dress to the colors!
Keep your line, men. Keep your line.
Close that gap!
At the double-quick, men!
Double-quick, boys! Come on, boys!
Keep it tight, boys! Keep it tight!
Turn right, boys! Right!
Turn to the right!
Keep it tight, men! Keep it tight, men!
Come on, boys!
At the double-quick, boys! Come on, boys!
Forward, men. Keep moving!
Battalion, halt!
- Battalion, halt!
- Battalion, halt!
Watch your line!
Dress to the colors!
Ready! Fire!
- Reload, boys! Reload quickly!
- Ready! Aim! Fire!
Keep firing! Keep firing!
Battalion, fight by fire!
Thattaway, boys, fire away!
Pour it into them!
Close the gap, boys!
Pour it into them!
Fill this hole now!
Steady now! Pour it into them!
Dress that line down there!
- Sir?
- What is it?!
Request permission to return to the rear, sir.
Permission granted. Permission granted.
No, no, Patrick, me boy.
Just reload and shoot.
Pour it into them, boys!
Fill that line in!
Fill this hole now!
Dress to the right!
Fire!
Pour it into them, boys!
Pour it into them!
Fire!
- Fall back, men!
- Fall back! Fall back!
Fall back, boys!
- What did you do that for?
- You'll thank me in the morning.
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother, help me...
It's all right, Casey, I got you. Don't worry about a thing. I'll get you home.
Quickly, men. Reload quickly!
It is well that war is so terrible...
...for we should grow too fond of it.
Yes, sir?
We're requisitioning your house for use as a hospital.
Come on inside out the cold.
You there.
You wounded?
Truly sorry, old fella--
Damn.
- General Hancock, sir.
- Surgeon.
This man is Major Sidney Willard of the 35th Massachusetts.
This way, sir.
Prepare to lift. Lift.
He's been shot twice in the chest, general.
There's nothing I can do.
- Is there whiskey in this house?
- Yes, sir.
Drink this, sir.
"Think not to thyself...
...that thou shall escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.
For if it thou keepest thy peace at this time...
... deliverance shall arise with the Jews from another place.
And who knows whether thou art come to the kingdom ...
...for such a time as this."
That's from the book of Esther.
Esther knew she had to do more than save herself.
Esther had to save her people too.
I love them people you done chased from this house.
I's known them most all my life.
The Beales is good people.
Mr. General?
I was born a slave.
And I wants to die free.
Lord knows I wants to die free, and I wants my children to be free.
Heaven help me.
May God bless you all.
Damn it, Tom, you scared me half to death.
You?! Lawrence, I thought you was with the beyond.
Mother?
I was able to secure the aid of a good spyglass...
... and could ascertain beyond all doubt that our house is still standing.
Oh, I pray to God for Martha and her dear ones.
But, Mother...
... it is a pitiful sight on the fields below Marye's Heights.
I should feel rancor in my heart for those invaders...
... but all I feel for them is sorrow.
Dear Lucy...
...when you were but a child in petticoats...
... I believe the year was 1 847...
...there was a great famine in Ireland.
Those fields below the Heights were covered ...
...with the finest crop of corn ever raised in this section.
The greater part of it was sent as a donation to the starving Irish.
I cannot help thinking ...
... but that it helped to feed the poor victims of the Irish brigade...
...who fell on this very field today.
General Gregg.
General Jackson.
I wish to apologize...
...for the differences we had.
The doctor tells me you have not long to live.
I ask you to dismiss this matter from your mind ...
... and turn your thoughts to God ...
... and the world to which you go.
General ...
...you know that I'm not a believer.
Well, then I will believe for the both of us.
How horrible is war.
Horrible, yes...
... but we have been invaded.
Lord, what can we do?
Kill them, sir.
Kill every last man of them.
Gentlemen.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a cup of Rio just now.
20th Maine! Return fire!
- Return fire!
- Return fire!
Patrick.
I hope you don't mind.
I know you're in heaven, but you got work yet to do down here...
... in this poor pitiless world.
Colonel Chamberlain.
Your orders are to withdraw.
Withdraw to the city.
Colonel.
We are ordered to form a picket line and cover the Army's retreat across the river.
Colonel Chamberlain, did you hear me?
Yes, sir. We are to retreat, sir.
Captain Spear.
- Form the regiment. We're moving out.
- Yes, sir.
Yankees.
Everywhere.
Where y'all been? Can't find my own house.
Gone! Gone!
What y'all done with my house?
Where is it? Can y'all tell me that?
Well, can you? Can you?
"Men of the Army...
... although you were not successful in the recent battle...
...the attempt was not an error, nor the failure other than an accident.
No soldiers in the annals of war fought more bravely.
Condoling with the mourners for the dead ...
... and sympathizing with the severely wounded ...
... I congratulate the Army that the numbers of casualties...
- ... have been comparatively so small ."
- Compared to what?
The Scots at Culloden?
The English at Bunker Hill?
The French at Waterloo?
"--the thanks of the nation ."
Signed: Abraham Lincoln.
Battalion!
Dismissed!
At this Christmas season, when the good fairies are in the air...
...we can hardly wonder at the sudden miracle...
...that has shown us the Fredericksburg affair in its true light...
... and given us occasion for national joy instead of national sorrow.
General Jackson?
Do you know what these decorations signify?
I was wondering if someone would tell me.
- This is Santa's sled.
- I see.
And this is stuff made of candy.
This is a gingerbread snowflake.
And this is a paper chain of angels.
Did you make this angel?
It's lovely.
- How old are you, Jane?
- I'm 5 years old.
- How old are you?
- I'm 38.
My father is 38. He's a soldier like you.
I haven't seen him for more than a year.
I've not met your father, but I'm told he's a very good man, very brave man.
I'm sure he misses you as much as I miss my daughter.
When did you last see your daughter?
I've never seen her.
She was born just days ago.
I want to see her more than anything in this world.
I want to see her as much as your father wants to see you.
You see that star at the top of the tree?
The star of Bethlehem.
The star that showed the wise men where they could find the baby Jesus.
Mother says that star will show Daddy how to find his way back home.
Well, your mother's very wise, very good person.
Your daddy will come home.
All the daddies will come home.
Oh, my.
Gentlemen, let us lift our glasses to our Southern women ...
...without whose bravery and fortitude...
...without whose love, without whose endurance and sacrifice...
... not a man among us can stay the course...
... or defend the cause.
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.
Now it's time for a carol.
Everybody must sing.
- Carols are my favorite.
- I can't sing.
Of course you can sing, Mr. Jackson.
You can breathe, can't you?
Just let your breath flow gently over your vocal chords and nature does the rest.
I'm afraid General Jackson's voice is more suited to the battlefield than the parlor.
You may take my word on it, Mrs. Corbin.
If it's singing you want, my adjutant Mr. Pendleton's your man.
We've worked our way through the hymnal ...
... and he always takes up where I leave off.
Well then, Mr. Pendleton ...
... since the general has appointed you
Kapellmeister...
...what shall we sing?
"Silent Night."
Dearest Fanny:
The bugle has just sounded,
3rd Brigade extinguish lights.
It makes me happy to think of you and my dear little ones at home...
...all nestled together.
I know that it is all well and bright with her whose sweet face shines in my heart.
Come and let me kiss your dear lips, precious wife.
Let our hearts worship together God's love, and wisdom, and mercy.
Yes, all is well, well with us, darling...
...well if we can only meet at last, as I pray God we may.
Hey, Billy Yank.
- That's a mighty nice song.
- I'm pleased you find it so agreeable.
I'd like it even more if I had some coffee to wash it down.
- Want some baccy?
- Sure, Johnny.
Have you got a lame horse?
What do you be wanting to trade for a lame horse?
Would you take General Burnside?
No. I guess I'll keep the horsehide.
Come on, get your baccy.
Mr. Smith, are you aware that the Bible gives models of official battle reports?
- No, sir.
- Nevertheless, there are such.
Consider the narrative of Joshua's battles with the Amalekites.
It has clearness and modesty, brevity.
And it traces the victory to the right source, the blessing of God.
Has it helped you with your reports, sir?
Anybody home?
Afternoon, General Jackson.
What's this?
- New recruits.
- My mama helped me make these.
That's fine.
- Left, right. Left, right.
- Child, that hat is a bit too large for you.
However...
...there.
I believe that suits a young girl better than an old soldier.
Mama's baking some biscuits.
You know, I was thinking of walking over to the big house for a nice hot cup of tea.
And I would very much like the company of one beautiful little lady.
Yes, General Jackson, a hot cup of chamomile.
Mr. Smith, you may continue writing the reports.
Consult first and second Samuel ...
... and first and second Kings.
They will be of help to you.
Shall we go?
Do you prefer butter biscuits or sugar cookies?
Oh, my. I know your mother's biscuits are first-rate.
We owe you Texas boys a debt of gratitude for putting on these shows.
Colonel Patton, any man who can't handle a guitar or a fiddle...
... ain't fit to carry a musket.
Attention, battalions.
Halt.
- Sergeant, keep these men here for now.
- Yes, sir.
Sir.
The men have rounded up three deserters.
Establish the courts-martial.
Have them arraigned.
See they're given a fair hearing.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Well, I thought that you should know, sir.
They all belong to the Stonewall brigade.
Do your duty, soldier.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Pendleton, if they are innocent, these men will go free.
But if they are found guilty of desertion ...
...the courts-martial condemns them to death. It must be so.
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.
I'm not done yet.
Sandie.
If the Republicans lose their little war, they are voted out in the next election ...
... and they return to their homes in New York or Massachusetts or Illinois...
...fat with their war profits.
If we lose, we lose our country.
We lose our independence.
We lose it all.
Our soldiers are brave.
They have endured hardships none of them could ever have imagined.
Desertion is not a solitary crime.
It's a crime against the tens of thousands of veterans...
...who are huddled together in the harsh cold of this winter.
Against all those who have sacrificed.
Against all those who have fallen.
Against all the women and the children we have left alone to fend for themselves.
I regard the crime of desertion as a sin against the Army of the Lord.
Duty is ours.
The consequences are God's.
I am a soldier in the 4th Virginia.
And in the 4th Virginia I will stay.
And if needs be, die.
The courts-martial of the Army of Northern Virginia...
... has found you guilty of desertion and sentences you to death ...
... by firing squad.
Lieutenant, do your duty.
Detail, ready!
Aim.
Fire!
Recover, arm!
Morning, Lawrence.
- Any mail?
- No.
But I did manage to get my hands on a New York Tribune.
- What are they saying about us now?
- Well, not much about us.
I mean, that is, this Army here in Stoneman's Switch.
Sure are kicking up a fuss about Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.
Says here that enlistments are down and desertions are up.
- Any grumbling among the men?
- Well, not in our regiment.
A few wonder out loud why they should be risking their lives for the darkies.
Well, Tom, you know my position.
I signed up to preserve the Union.
The president did the right thing.
What's the use of uniting the country by force and leaving slavery in place?
It sure riled up those Johnny Rebs.
They'll think Lincoln incited the slaves to rise against them.
Why shouldn't they?
Freeing the slaves wasn't a war aim when this began, but war changes things.
- It sorts things out.
- Well, I don't know, Lawrence.
Not everybody feels the way we do about the darkies.
Especially when it comes to fighting and dying.
Tom.
Do me a favor.
Don't call me Lawrence and don't call Negroes "darkies."
That's a patronizing expression from which we must free ourselves.
Come outside. I want to--
I want to show you something.
All these thousands of men.
Many of them not much more than boys.
Each one of them some mother's son.
Some sister's brother.
Some daughter's father.
Each one of them a whole person, loved and cherished in some home far away.
Many of them will never return.
An army is power.
Its entire purpose is to coerce others.
Now, this kind of power cannot be used carelessly or recklessly.
This kind of power can do great harm.
We have seen more suffering than any man should ever see...
... and if there is going to be an end to it, it must be an end that justifies the cost.
Now, somewhere out there is the Confederate Army.
They claim they are fighting for their independence, for their freedom.
Now, I cannot question their integrity.
I believe they are wrong, but I cannot question it.
But I do question a system that defends its own freedom while it denies it to others.
To an entire race of men.
I will admit it, Tom, war is a scourge.
But so is slavery.
It is the systematic coercion of one group of men over another.
It has been around since the book of Genesis.
It exists in every corner of the world.
But that's no excuse for us to tolerate it here...
...when we find it right before our very eyes, in our own country.
As God is my witness, there is no one
I hold in my heart dearer than you.
But if your life or mine is part of the price to end this curse and free the Negro...
...then let God's will be done.
Oh, my, general, we do appreciate the gift.
Where do you get all these lemons?
It's a kind providence that provides kindly.
Miss Corbin, the Yankees have not succeeded in cutting our rail lines...
...to the South.
Here is to the sultry, balmy South.
And, Miss Corbin, here's to your engagement.
May Sandie Pendleton prove to be as fine a husband as he is a soldier.
Hear, hear.
That's good, it's not too sweet.
May I have some more?
Sure.
Mrs. Corbin.
Thank you for your many kindnesses.
Our cause and our country are in your debt.
I only regret, general, that we could not do more.
You'll come visit us again when this cruel war is over?
I should like to say goodbye to your daughter. I shall miss her very much.
Certainly, general.
She's not feeling very well today.
All of the children have come down with the fever. Please, come in.
Well, now.
What's this?
How can I play with my friend if she insists on staying in bed?
Jane.
Will you place this angel on your tree next Christmas?
Mrs. Corbin, I must return to my men.
My physician, Doctor McGuire, will attend to her.
- I will send him directly.
- Bless you, general.
Fresh meat. What a change.
Yeah. A live steer around these parts is as rare as a peacock in a poultry pen.
It was scarlet fever.
The children are all right. They'll be fine.
Except--
I'm so sorry, sir.
The little girl, Jane.
She did not survive. She died, sir.
What is it?
He's never cried before.
Not for all the blood and all the death, not for his young students from VMI ...
... not for his friends...
... not for anyone.
Not so, Sandie.
I think he is crying for them all.
She's too pretty to look like me.
Nonsense, Thomas.
She is very like you.
She rises early and she loves to be held in my arms.
I have never seen you look so well, Thomas.
You are handsomer than ever.
General Jackson, sir? General Jackson, sir?
An officer come to see you, sir.
An officer from General Lee, sir.
I'll be right there.
General, from what we've observed, Hooker has moved five corps, maybe 70, 000 men.
They're digging in around
Chancellor's mansion.
Sedgwick has another 40, 000 spread out along the Stafford Heights...
... on the north bank of the Rappahannock in front of General Early at Fredericksburg.
Now, there's possibly 30, 000 more back along the river north of here...
...that we've not yet located.
We're not in a position of strength here.
We owe a great deal to the unexplainable, the mystery of General Hooker...
...who's allowed us to maneuver freely...
... between two parts of an army that's more than twice our strength.
We do not yet understand his plan.
He may still plan a move toward Gordonsville...
... move around below us, cut us off from Richmond.
And there's still Sedgwick on the river.
Now Sedgwick shows no signs of moving, but that could change.
They're anchored against the river and their lines continue down below Chancellorsville...
...then curves along here.
We've observed their lines curving out in these open clearings...
...then extending on out to the west.
Then what, general?
Do you know where their right flank is?
- No. Not yet.
- We must know. We must know.
If he marches in that direction, he could threaten our flank...
... or be going toward Gordonsville before we can react.
General Lee, sir.
- May I approach?
- Sure.
Out here, in the west, along this turnpike, here...
...their right flank's in the air.
It's the one place they're not digging in.
They're not expecting any pressure there.
- Who's on their flank?
- 1 1 th Corps. Oliver Howard.
Were there any roads farther down below the turnpike?
Yes, sir. Indeed there are, good roads.
That's Catherine's Furnace here and there's a road here.
- There's a road over this way.
- Then, we must hit them there.
Then attack the flank.
They will have nowhere to go.
They'll have to go back across the river or we will destroy them.
We're too close to their lines.
They'll observe our movements.
There must be another road farther down.
Now, is there someone we know?
Someone we can trust who knows the area?
Captain Pendleton.
Find Reverend Lacy for me.
I'm here, sir.
This is my chaplain, the Reverend Tucker Lacy.
He has family in this area.
General Lee.
Reverend, it would be very helpful if you could find us a safe route...
- ... around the enemy.
- Well, sir, there, I know a family.
The Wellfords. I suggest a visit to them.
We may find ourselves a guide.
Please go at once, Mr. Lacy. Find someone who might show us how we might proceed.
Yes, sir.
Then it has been decided, general.
This mission will be yours.
I would not have it any other way.
Boys, my days are numbered.
My time has come.
You can laugh, but my time has come.
I got a 20-dollar gold piece I carried through the war and a silver watch ...
... my daddy sent to me through the lines.
Take them off of me when I'm dead.
Give them to my captain to give to my daddy when he gets back home.
Here's my clothes and my blanket.
Anybody who wishes can have them.
My rations I do not wish at all. My gun and cartridge box I expect to die with.
- Mr. Smith.
- Sir.
Your instructions to the ranks: There is to be no noise, I want no talking.
Stragglers will be bayoneted, let the men know.
No muskets are to be loaded until we deploy for battle. Secrecy, Mr. Smith.
Everything depends upon the element of surprise.
Sir, I'll convey the orders. No stragglers.
- Reverend.
- May we bow our heads.
Dear Lord, heavenly Father, you who know all things.
We face again a mighty foe, a vast host.
An enemy more than twice our number.
But you have taught us to fear not, to trust in you.
When the Philistines came before them, the people of Israel feared Goliath.
Their Army was in terror.
No one had the courage to stand against the mighty warrior.
Then you brought forth David, a mere boy.
And Saul armed David with his armor...
...and he put a helmet of brass upon his head.
Also he armed him with a coat of mail.
And David girded his sword upon his armor and he assayed to go.
General Rodes, deploy your men on either side of the turnpike, brigade front.
How soon will
General Colston's men be up?
We're right behind, general.
General Lee...
... I hope as soon as practicable to attack...
... I trust that an ever kind providence will bless us with great success.
Take this to General Lee.
Well, General Rodes...
... it appears the Virginia Military
Institute will be heard from today.
Deploy your brigade.
There is another road. It's a road that runs well below the Federal lines.
The Wellford boy explained it to me.
He knows the route.
He will march with us to where this road rejoins the turnpike...
...then we turn to the east and attack their right flank.
It is a greater distance, perhaps 1 2 or
1 3 miles, but the boys can do it.
They have never let us down.
We've divided the Army before.
We must retain the advantage of surprise, we must outflank the flankers.
We must beat them at their own game.
Take your entire corps,
General Jackson, and destroy the enemy.
God be with you.
Two hours of daylight left.
Are you ready, General Rodes?
You may move forward.
- Fall back!
- They're coming! Get your muskets!
- Shoulder to shoulder! Let's go, let's go!
- Fall back!
Aim fire!
Pull back and save yourself!
Form a line! Aim!
Fire!
Fall back!
Fire! Fall back!
Into the trees, men! Fall back!
Press on!
Form a line! Form a line!
Form a line!
- Run! Run!
- Charge!
Press on!
Hold up right here! Aim! Fire!
Push on!
Hell, that's hot. I knew you'd be all right, you dang fool.
Oh, God.
Regroup!
- Stop running!
- Move into line!
Stay together!
My God! Give them the bayonet!
- Stop running!
- Stop running!
Stop running, soldier!
Stop running! Rally with me, men!
- Rally with me!
- Stop! Rally around the general!
Give me a line to the left!
Form a line to the left!
We have stopped, sir. Can't see.
The lines are tangled.
We're mixed in with Rodes' men.
It's confusion, sir.
We need Hill to come up.
Hill's men can move on by us.
Tell General Colston he must re-form his men.
Now I will strongly urge General Hill to push forward hard.
We must not stop. Let General Colston know they will run if we press them.
Yes, sir.
General Hill, you must keep the men moving. We must keep the pressure up.
We have broken their flank. We can crush them now if we can cut them off.
We must not give them time to get organized.
General, take your division forward.
Press on north, move toward the river, toward the United States ford.
- We must not let them escape.
- It's late in the day, general.
- We don't know the ground.
- Boswell!
You will ride with General Hill. You will find a way through the woods to the northeast.
You will find the rear of the enemy's position.
Yes, sir.
We will cut them off, general!
They're digging in. Must be Federal.
Sound carries at night, they could be a ways off.
General, sir, we are beyond our lines.
This is no place for you, sir.
You're right.
It cannot go the way I'd hoped.
It will have to be tomorrow.
Gentlemen, let us return to the road.
Stop firing! You're firing at your own men!
Hold it!
Hold your fire!
These are your own men here!
It's a lie! Pour into them, boys!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
General Hill, they're our men!
What have they done?
Who is this?
Oh, God, general! Are you hurt badly?
I'm afraid I am, in my shoulder.
And here.
- Get a litter. We need a litter. Move!
- Yes, sir.
- We must leave here, general.
- Here, take this. It'll help, sir.
I will try to keep this from the knowledge of the troops.
Thank you, general.
The Yankees have set up a battery not a hundred yards. We must get away!
Ready? Lift! Careful now.
Move out. Ready, lift.
Fire!
General. Lie quiet, or you will most certainly be killed.
Let's go. Lift!
Move! Ready? Lift!
Doctor, good to see you.
I am hurt badly.
I fear I am dying.
Sir, I want you to drink this.
It's whiskey and morphine.
Your right hand is minor.
The ball lodged under the skin.
It's these other wounds.
I need to examine your arm.
And I'll administer chloroform to make it painless.
If I should find that the condition warrants amputation ...
... may I proceed at once?
I have complete faith in you, Dr. McGuire.
Just do to me whatever you think necessary.
Breathe deeply, general.
What an infinite blessing.
Blessing.
Doesn't seem right that General Jackson isn't here to see this.
No, major. It does not seem right at all.
But it is the will of God.
He's lost his left arm. I've lost my right.
General?
How you feeling, sir?
Do not concern yourself about me.
But tell me, how are we faring?
General, the enemy's gone across the river.
We secured the high ground around Chancellorsville.
General Stuart did well by you, sir.
And the Stonewall brigade...
... right in the middle of it, sir.
"Remember Jackson, " they shouted.
I heard that all day.
They were fighting for Stonewall.
Well, isn't that just like them.
They are a noble set of men.
That name, Stonewall, belongs to the brigade, not to me.
I have the ball.
Dr. McGuire allowed me to keep the musket ball he took from your hand.
It was a round, smooth bore.
It had to be one of ours.
I heard. They thought I was asleep.
It could not be helped.
There's no blame in war.
We must all forgive.
I had to remove your husband's left arm, patch his right hand.
He's healing well, I'm very pleased.
But there is a new problem.
I do believe he is developing pneumonia.
- May I see him, doctor?
- Well, certainly, certainly. He's weak.
I've given him some medicine to help him sleep.
He's in some pain and the medication makes him drift away. He's in and out.
General, I have a treat for you.
Something you may have been missing.
Another medicine?
Very well, doctor.
No, it's not mine, actually.
But it may do you some good.
Oh, so sweet. Too much sugar.
Always the problem with my esposita's lemonade.
I'm so glad to see you looking so bright.
No, no. You must be cheerful.
Let's not have a long face.
You know I like cheerfulness and brightness in a sickroom.
Esposita.
My esposita.
I know you would gladly give your life for me...
... but I am perfectly resigned.
Do not be sad.
I hope I may yet recover.
Pray for me.
But in your prayers, never forget to use the petition, "Thy will be done."
I'm so glad you're here.
Your lemonade is delicious.
- It's not too sweet.
- Too much sugar.
I never told you that.
Is that my sweet darling angel?
My Julia.
Is it certain, doctor?
Does he know?
I have not told him.
Then I will.
He must know.
He must be prepared.
My darling ...
...today is Sunday.
Do you know that the doctor says you must very soon be in heaven?
Do you not feel willing to acquiesce in
God's allotment if he wills you to go today?
I prefer it.
Well ...
... by the time this day closes...
...you will be with the blessed
Savior in his glory.
I will be an infinite gainer to be translated.
General Lee.
What is the news, Reverend?
General Lee, I must report that his case appears hopeless.
His wounds are healing, but he's dying of pneumonia.
Surely General Jackson must recover.
God will not take him from us, not now that we need him so very much.
Will you see him, sir?
No, sir, I won't. No, sir.
When you return, I trust you'll find him better.
And when the occasion offers, tell him that I prayed for him last night...
... as I never prayed,
I believe, for myself.
Please tell him.
Sir.
Push up that column.
Move up that column.
Pendleton, take charge of that line.
Where's Smith?
Tell him. Push up that column.
Move the batteries to the center of the crest. There's no time to waste.
General Stuart, no quarter to the violators of our homes and hearths.
General Lee, we must take the war to the enemy.
You are the 1 st Brigade.
Advance, my brave boys.
Press on.
Let us cross over the river...

Hey, Walter.
How we doing?
Good to see you.
How was the flight?
Oh, not bad.
Well, that's great.

The only way we can compete with the Eastern Bloc teams is if we're willing to change.
Change what?
The way we train, the way we prepare, even our schedule.
What kind of scheduling changes are we talking about?
I think we need to make it longer.
Much more competitive.
Longer?
You gonna pay for that?
We also need to change the way we play the game.
What exactly does that mean?
My plan is to adopt a new style.
A hybrid of the Soviet school and the Canadian school.
A combination that requires the highest level of conditioning, speed, creativity, and most of all, team chemistry.
Is this what you've been using at the University of Minnesota?
We've been phasing it in over the last couple of years.

I don't know about you, but I'd have a hard time giving up money to finish sixth at Lake Placid.
It's a tough draw, Herb.
Tough draw.
It's a tough draw even if we don't play the Soviets.
What the hell happens if we do?
We put our best on the ice with them last year.
Professional all-stars.
They still beat us.
It wasn't because you weren't good enough.
All-star teams fail because they rely solely on the individual's talent.
The Soviets win because they take that talent and use it inside a system that's designed for the betterment of the team.
My goal is to beat them at their own game.
Beat the best team in the world?
Gold medalists in
That's a pretty lofty goal,
Herb.
Lou, that's why I want to pursue it.
Well, fellas, any more questions?

Thanks.
It's good seeing you.

♪ Baby, you can suit yourself ♪
Oh, Linda, can you get that for me?
Oh, sure.
Hello?
Yes, just a moment, please.
Patti, it's for Herb.
Someone from the U.S.O.C.
It's 8-0!
All right, it's gonna be a dramatic comeback.
Go.
- Herb.
- Yeah?
Herb.
You've got a call from Colorado.
We're not done here.
Yes, well, so then he what?
He just went along with that?
Well, I appreciate that, Walter.
Thank you.
What'd they say?
I got the job.
I got the job.
How about that, huh?
Oh, great! Oh!
- When do you start?
- Two weeks.
Two weeks? They want you to start that soon?
The games are in February.
Yeah, but it's June.
Is there even ice?
Mommy!
Mommy, Mommy.
We're supposed to take the kids to the Black Hills.
I know, I know.
Cleopatra's leaving, and she wants to say goodbye.
Okay. Okay.
I gotta call Craig Patrick right now.
- Hey, Buzz.
- Hey.
What's going on?
- How are you doing?
- Good.
- Phil Verchota.
- Verchota?
Name?
Ralph Cox. U.N.H.
Name, please.
- Mike Ramsey.
- Hi, Mike.
Number, towel.
Jack O'callahan, right?
- Last time I checked.
- Good luck.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Who's next?
Jimmy Craig.
Hey, Jack.
What's up, you sieve?
- How's it going?
- Good.
Is there a reason why
Joey Mullen's not here?
Yeah, about 30,000 of them, all sitting in his New York bank account.
He got a $30,000 signing bonus?
- Crazy, isn't it?
- Yeah.
How's it looking?
A lot of guys from Minnesota and Boston.
Yeah, that's gonna work.
You're Robbie Mcclanahan, right?
Yeah.
Mike Eruzione.
Boston University.
Try to play for Brooks a little more, huh?
I played for him for four years.
A few more months wouldn't hurt.
How about you?
Just trying to play a little more hockey, that's all.
Rest of your boys all here?
Of course.
Think they'd miss out on this?
Might want to wait a day or so before you go over and say hi.
Check!
Come on, hit those lines!
Head for the net!
The net!
Come on, come on!
Skate, boys! Skate!
Skate!
Drop your shoulder!
On the wing!
Hey, go to the blue line!
Man, look at that move.
Whoo, Rizzo!
Eruzione?
Cross him off the list.
Kid doesn't have a shot of making this team.
- You think so?
- No way.
One more!
Do it again!
Pucks in, pucks in!
Forward! Blue line!
So, Doc cleared him.
Says it's just a sprain.
Good.
I wanted to let you know how much I'm looking forward to being able to coach with you.
You were a hell of a player, Craig.
And you're gonna make a hell of a coach.
Thanks.
I'm gonna need you to stick tight with these kids.
If there's any big problems, you'll let me know.
Otherwise, you take care of it, okay?
Okay.
Take a look at that.
What's this?
26 names.
The tough part will be getting it to 20 before the opening ceremonies.
What, this is the final roster?
You're kidding me, right?
This is our first day, Herb.
I mean, we got a week of this.
What about the advisory staff?
Aren't they supposed to have a say in this?
Technically, I guess.
I don't know.
Well, you're missing some of the best players.
I'm not looking for the best players.
I'm looking for the right ones.
You have Jim Craig to back up Janaszak?
Other way around.
Other way around?
I'm sorry, didn't Janaszak just win you a National Championship?
Jannie is a solid goaltender, but we're not playing for the National Championship here, Craig.
People I speak to say Craig's game has been off since his mom died.
Did they ever see him when his game's on?
Hughes. Ross.
Auge. Delich.
Horsch. Strobel.
Christoff. Morrow.
Suter. Ramsey.
Janaszak. Christian.
Pavelich. Verchota.
Baker. Harrington.
Schneider. O'callahan.
Mcclanahan. Silk.
Johnson. Craig.
Cox. Eruzione.
And that's the roster for now.
Rest of you, thanks for coming out.
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Robbie.
Way to go, Rizzo.
Take a good look, gentlemen.
'cause they're the ones getting off easy.
We're putting a few of you on reserve in case somebody gets injured or their game goes to hell.
The final roster will have
20 names on it in 7 months, so more of you are going home.
You give 99%, you'll make my job very, very easy.
I'll be your coach.
I won't be your friend.
If you need one of those, take it up with Doc or coach Patrick.
God.
All right, gentlemen.
Congratulations to all of you.
That's it for today.
On the way out, pick up one of these.
You've got a little homework to do before you celebrate.
Thank you.
Whoo!
Herb!
Herb.
Hold on a minute.
Hey, Walter.
How we doing?
I think we got a problem here, Herb.
What's that?
I got a roomful of people up there who want to have a say in this process, and you've already picked the team.
- Look, Walter.
- No, no.
There's a right way to do this kind of thing, and this is not it.
I know you got a job to do.
If I was in your shoes,
I'd be saying the same thing.
All right, then.
Let's go upstairs.
We'll help piece together a hockey team.
All of us.
Together.
Walter, that's just not gonna happen.
Do you realize what the A.H.A. went through to put this thing together?
The best amateur players in the country on the ice for a week?
- Yeah.
- Not just a day.
I didn't ask for that, because I already know my team.
How do you know your team?
Those kids haven't been on the ice for maybe a couple of hours.
Every one of those boys was chosen for a specific reason.
I've studied film on each one of those boys.
I've watched them, and I've coached a lot of them.
The ones I haven't,
I've spoken with their coaches and scouts in the area.
Now, I know best what I need to compete.
And the team I've chosen is it.
What am I supposed to say to the advisory board?
Tell them the truth.
This puts me in a hell of a spot, Herb.
A hell of a spot!
Well, they hired me to do a job.
I'm trying to do it.
All right.
I'm gonna back you on this.
But I sure as hell hope you know what you're doing.
Hey, Phillie, what are you on?
My test is done.
Jesus!
Me and Jannie are done.
Verchota, you're done?
I'm on page four.
You get stopped by a policeman, but you're not at fault.
Do you state your disagreement right away?"
He's got 300 of these things.
It's just a test, Silky.
You've taken one or two before.
Not to play hockey, I haven't.
Can you even read, Silky?
I try.
Hey, Rizzo!
- What's going on?
- Mac.
Easy, big guy.
I don't know how you can sit in the same room with that clown.
Let it go. It's over.
Let it go.
What's going on here?
O.C.'s got a little unfinished business over there.
Not for long I don't.
What did I tell you, man?
Mcclanahan?
You're not still going on about the '76 playoffs, are you?
Come on, O.C., that was, like, three years ago.
You know what, Coxie, let me ask you a question.
Why did you want to play college hockey?
Isn't it obvious?
For the girls.
I'm serious, Coxie.
Why did you want to play college hockey?
'cause I love to play hockey.
I want to go to the NHL just like everybody does.
I wanted to win a National Championship.
That pansy over there cheap-shots me.
I get tossed out of the game.
He steals the ring right off my finger?
How would you feel?
Everyone was throwing cheap shots that night.
Rizzo, it's funny you say that.
I was just wondering what side you're on.
I'm on your side.
You know, it really seems that way.
All right, just relax, okay?
Jeez.
I'm not doing this right now.
I'm outta here.
Where you going?
To my room. Is that all right with you, Mother?
Just let him go.
Well, no wonder the guy gets so many penalty minutes.
He gets a little carried away sometimes.
That's it.
Pick it up.
- That's it.
- Kick it out!
Look for the pass.
Come on, hit him with a pass.
- Go, Johnson!
- Outside!
All right, Johnson, hit him on the other side.
- Get them up!
- Look for him!
Move and hit him, Johnson.
He's open.
- Center, center!
- Come on, Johnson!
Johnson!
That stuff may work here, but it won't against the teams we'll be playing.
Next line up.
Let's go. Let's run it again.
Morrow.
Let me take this one.
Don't worry about it.
Keep your head up.
This is a breakout play, gentlemen.
So, please, let's get rid of the puck early.
All right, let's go!
Hey, hey!
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.
- What's O.C. doing?
- That was cheap.
He didn't have the puck.
What are you hitting like that for?
That's bush league, O.C.
Nice hit, O.C.
Tell your boy to keep his head up, and he won't have to worry.
You all right, man?
Let's go!
Craig, let them go.
You got him?
- Hey, stay on him!
- Stay out of it, Buzzy!
Get him.
Come on, give it to him.
- What are you doing?
- Stay out of it, Baker!
Come on, give it to him!
All right, Mac.
Come on, Mac.
Take him down!
Come on, O.C.!
Let him have it!
- Put him on the ice!
- Come on, O.C.
There you go.
Beat him, O.C.
- Oh!
- Oh, man!
Whoa!
That's it.
Well, how about it, boys?
Look like hockey to you?
Looks like a couple of monkeys trying to hump a football to me.
What do you think, Craig?
Yeah.
You want to settle old scores, you're on the wrong team.
We move forward starting right now.
We start becoming a team right now!
Skating.
Passing.
Flow.
Creativity.
That is what this team is all about, gentlemen.
Not old rivalries.
Why don't we start with some introductions?
You know, get to know each other a little bit.
Where you're from, who you are.
Go ahead.
Rob Mcclanahan.
St. Paul, Minnesota.
Who you play for?
For you, here at the U.
Jack?
Jack O'callahan.
Charlestown, Mass.
Boston University.
Over here.
I'm Ralph Cox.
I'm from wherever's not gonna get me hit.
Very good.
Everybody on the line.
Let's go.

- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, coach.
Been wondering why you wouldn't take this test.
Yeah. Well...
It's nothing against you or anything.
I just don't see what it has to do with stopping a puck.
Well, that's all right.
You just took it anyway.
♪ Honey, I don't know ♪
Hey, coach.
So, if I took it...
You know, I meant to ask you.
How's your family doing?
Doing all right.
And you?
I'm okay.
You know, I got 26 guys trying to make this team, Jim.
Only 20 are gonna go to Lake Placid.
So I gotta know how committed you are to being here.
Because if you're not, you're just wasting our time.
Look, coach.
My dad's going through a rough time right now.
He's got nothing.
He lost his job, and with
Atlanta trying to sign me...
Bottom line is, my mom wanted this.
Me playing on this team.
Hard to say no to someone who drove you to practice every day.
You didn't answer my question, Jim.
I'm here, aren't I?
I'll see you in the morning.
Don't forget to bring your game.
The Soviets performed a nuclear test, setting off a 75-kiloton bomb in eastern Kazakhstan.
So much hate and fear.
- What's that?
- The Soviets and the West.
They have nuclear weapons pointed at each other.
It's bound to end in disaster.
Oh, come on. They'll figure something out, Doc.
Don't got any other choice, right?
Well, yeah, hope so.
But it seems to me there are some people who never get along.
Yeah.
Like hockey players from Boston and Minnesota.
Our own private Cold War.
Hey, Doc, let me ask you a question, all right?
You've worked with Herb for a long time, right?
I've known Herb for quite some time.
So tell me something.
Does he always treat his players like this?
No. No, no.
This I have never seen.
But, Craig, believe me.
Herb has a reason for everything he does.
Well, he's ending up with
20 players who hate his guts.
Maybe if they hate him, they won't have time to hate each other.

Hey, honey.
How much longer you gonna be?
I still got a few more.
Well, I'm going to bed, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Oh, you know, Kelly has ballet at 4:00 tomorrow and Danny's done with hockey camp at about the same time.
Which one do you want to get?
- Herb?
- Yeah.
Can you pick up Danny at 4:00?
We got team meetings after practice tomorrow.
I can't be in two places at one time.
- What about Margie?
- They're on vacation.
Well, I don't know, honey.
You'll figure it out.
Can you turn that off, please?
Please.
Herb, this is what happens over the summer.
The kids are off doing a zillion things, and once in a while, your meetings have to wait.
Come on, Patti.
I'm coaching a hockey team here.
I mean, we already talked about this.
Oh, really?
When exactly did we have this talk?
Because I don't recall being a part of the conversation.
What did I say?
Was it interesting?
We never had this talk.
Never.
Okay, what's on your mind?
Nothing.
No, you're obviously mad about something.
First you're upset because we didn't talk.
And then when I try to talk about whatever it is, you don't want to.
Patti, if you're not willing to...
It's not because we didn't talk.
It's because you never even asked.
I know what this is about.
I know it, and you know it.
What? Know what?
This.
What you're doing.
Chasing after something you didn't get, that you may never get.
What if it doesn't work out, Herb?
Are we gonna do this every four years?
It's okay.
Go finish your work.
Go, go.
Hey.
Hey.
You know...
Ever since I stopped playing,
I wanted to coach this team.
And this is the only way
I know how to do it.
It's not the easiest way,
I know, for you.
Or the kids.
But...
Patti, I have to do this.
I know you do.
I'm sorry we didn't talk.
And I was wrong not to ask.
So I'm asking now if you can be with me on this, because it won't mean anything if you're not.
Blue line, back.
Red line, back.
Far blue line, back.
Far red line, back.
And you have 45 seconds to do it.
Get used to this drill.
We'll be doing it a lot.
Why?
Because the legs feed the wolf, gentlemen.
I can't promise you we'll be the best team at Lake Placid next February.
But we will be the best-conditioned.
That I can promise you.
Be prepared to grow through pain, gentlemen.
You're gonna skate harder than you've skated in your lives every minute of every day you're on the ice with me.
Stretch things out north and south, you open things up east and west.
Center's gonna fill in here.
This far-side winger is gonna come in, take the center spot.
- What's your name?
- Mark Johnson.
Where you from, Mark?
Madison, Wisconsin.
- Who you play for?
- University of Wisconsin.
Come on, go, boys.
Go, boys!
The fastest way to make this team is by being fast!
No, no!
Stop.
Look at you.
Three men being covered by one guy.
This isn't weaving for weaving's sake.
Spread out!
Use the ice!
- Right there.
- There? Okay.
Come on, Jimmy.
Challenge them!
You're getting beat on the side here.
Challenge them.
Yeah, I don't blame you.
How you holding up?
- Oh, no.
- Not good, not good.
- How about you?
- Name's Christian.
- Who do you play for?
- University of North Dakota.
Pass it! Come on!
No!
No, no, no!
Get him to a point!
You're quarterbacking this play!
Come on, Rizzo,
I got you running this play!
You're gonna run the bench.
Mac, get out here!
Boom, he can hit him.
Boom. Boom. Boom.
We're opening up options, see?
We've got four options off one play, guys.
You guys got that?
Anybody have any questions?
Okay, let's go.
- What is he talking about?
- No clue.
20 of you are going to Lake Placid.
6 are going home.
Who that is, believe it or not, is up to you.
- How about you?
- Mark Pavelich.
- Who do you play for?
- U.M.D. Bulldogs.
Let's go!
Next line up!
All right, turn it up, boys.
Let's move it, Bah.
Get it up, get it up!
Eric, it's open!
Here you go, here you go!
They can't stop us yet.
Attaway, Buzzy.
Nice pass.
That was a good shot.
You three.
- Run that again.
- Again?
- All right.
- Let's go.
Christ, we don't have a chance in hell of winning.
So I understand how you feel.
Don't let them know that.
Yeah.
- All right.
- Thanks, coach.
The coneheads are coming in.
Who?
That's what the guys have been calling them
'cause, well, they're a little...
You know, like the coneheads.
What's that?
Dan Akroyd, Jane Curtin.
I guess it's off your radar.
Come on in, boys.
Wanted to see us, coach?
Yeah, I'm thinking about keeping the three of you together on the same line.
Everybody okay with that?
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah.
How about you, Buzzy? You think this works with Bah and Pav?
Yeah, it's going good.
Moving the puck well.
It's different playing with them.
We just seem to always find each other at the other end of the ice and make things happen.
Pass, shoot, score.
- Pass, shoot, and...
- Score.
Well, all right.
We'll see how she goes.
- All right.
- Thanks, coach.
Take it easy.
Rest up.
Well, looks like we're taking a line of coneheads to Europe.
Yeah, if they can keep their legs under them.
All right, Herb,
I'll see you next week.
Something on your mind, Craig?
Or is that just too far off my radar?
I don't think you can push them this hard.
Not for six months.
It's too long.
- They're doing all right.
- Well, whole team's tired.
I know how hard to push them, Craig.
You sure about that?
You know why I had them take that test?
Make sure I could push them this hard.
I'll see you Monday.
All right.
Oh, wow. Dynamite.
Look over here, Phillie.
Section two, about four rows up.
Two girls. Blond.
Man, they're gorgeous.
What row?
About the seventh row up.
To the right.
Lovely blond girls.
Maybe we can take a few home.
Must be something in the water.
Get a whistle.
Good game.
- Good game.
- Good game.
Hold up, there.
Hold up, hold up.
Gotta get back on the ice.
Let's go.
- What for?
- You'll find out soon enough.
Let's go.
Back on the ice.
What for?
We'll find out in a minute, won't we?
Come on, let's see what he wants.
Get a picture or something?
What's going on?
You guys don't want to work during the game?
No problem.
We'll work now.
Goal line.
That one!
Hustle!
Think you can win on talent alone?
Gentlemen, you don't have enough talent to win on talent alone.
Again.
If you think you can come here and play the Norwegian
National team and tie them and then go to the Olympics and win...
You got another thing coming.
You better think about something else, each and every one of you.
When you pull on that jersey, you represent yourself and your teammates.
And the name on the front is a hell of a lot more important than the one on the back!
Get that through your head!
Again!
Win, lose, or tie, you're gonna play like champions!
Again!
Kick it in the ass, Verchota!
You want to go home early?
Keep it going, Suter.
All the way to the line and all the way back.
It's not that difficult.
Again!
Again.
Again!
Herb.
What?
The rink manager wants to clean the ice and then go home.
Tell him to leave me the keys.
I'll lock up.
Again.
Again.
You keep playing this way, you won't beat anybody who's even good, let alone great.
You want to make this team, then you better start playing at a level that's gonna force me to keep you here.
Again!
Thank God.
Think we're getting out of here?
Hey.
Where you going?
Back on the line.
Again.
Send them.
Again.
Again.
How about it, Silky? You gonna be the first one to quit on me?
How about you, O.C.?
You ready to go down?
Oh, I think I got my money on you, Verchota.
You got a hot date in about an hour, but you're not looking too good for that right about now.
Send them.
Again.
Doc, I mean, this is madness, right?
This cannot be a team of common men because common men go nowhere.
You have to be uncommon.
Again.
Herb!
This has gone on long enough!
Everybody on that line.
Somebody's going to get hurt!
Everybody get on that line.
Hey.
Again.
Again.
Herb.
Come on, Craig.
Blow the whistle.
Again.
Mike Eruzione!
Winthrop, Massachusetts!
Who do you play for?
I play for the United States of America.
That's all, gentlemen.
Come on, you Minnesotans!
My back's starting to hurt from carrying you all.
Pretend you're pushing some cows!
Why don't you stop talking,
Boston boy, and start pushing?
- What do you got there, Pav?
- Three 9's.
Not bad, Pav.
Not bad.
I got two 7's.
Well, we were taxiing out to the runway, right, and we, you know, we kind of hit a moose.
No, the moose is fine.
But we gotta make sure the airplane's all right, so some of the boys are pushing it back so these guys can take a look at it.
Patti, the moose is okay.
He ran off. I saw it.
So, what's going on at home?
Big matchup tonight in New York between the NHL All-Stars and the Soviet Union.
- Yeah, she did, huh?
- And this one was no contest, as the Soviets dominated the NHL's best from start to finish, winning by a score of 6-0.
The Soviets, led by the superb play of their captain,
Boris Mikhailov, were superior to the NHL stars in every way tonight.
Their passing was crisper, their offense was relentless, and their conditioning, superb.
- No, I'm here. I'm listening.
- The Soviets coasting to a win in New York tonight.
An embarrassing evening for the NHL All-Stars.
Russian style of play, boys.
Fluid.
Creative.
Forwards are constantly circling.
They don't so much look for the man as they do a patch of ice.
They get the mismatch, two-on-one, easy goal.
Looks a lot like me out there, huh, Buzz?
Boris Mikhailov.
Captain for the last six years.
He is the best player at his position.
And that includes, as we've just found out, the NHL.
Do these guys ever smile?
They're Russians.
They get shot if they smile.
Vladislav Tretiak.
You score on Tretiak, keep the puck.
'cause it doesn't happen often.
42 games in the last 3 months.
42 wins.
Their main weapon is intimidation.
They know they're gonna win, and so do their opponents.
Look, I can give you all a load of crap about how you're a better team than they are, but that's exactly what it'd be.
Everyone in this room knows what people say about our chances.
I know it.
You know it.
But I also know there is a way to stay with this team.
You don't defend them.
You attack them.
You take their game and you shove it right back in their face.
The team that is finally willing to do this is the team that has a chance to put them down.
NHL won't change their game.
We will.
Rest of the world is afraid of them.
Boys, we won't be.
No one has ever worked hard enough to skate with the Soviet team for an entire game.
Gentlemen, we are gonna work hard enough.
Come on, quick feet, boys!
Quick feet! Work it!
Work hard now, boys!
Come on, Strobel, pick up your knees!
Keep your shoulders square.
Push it!
Come on, boys.
Go!
The legs feed the wolf, boys.
The legs feed the wolf.
Go! Stay with him, Jimmy!
Stay with him!
Damn it!
How's your legs?
I'll let you know when I can feel them.
Come on, boys.
Go get him, go get him!
Attaboy, Jimmy.
Better.
Not good, but better.
You gotta have the mental intensity, boys.
Move, boys!
There you go, there you go!
That's it.
Work it, boys. Work it.
Quick feet!
Push it!
Hit the tape, boys.
Passes come from the heart.
Want to stretch things out north and south.
We got the coneheads on the line.
Take me through it here.
Bah.
I'm gonna stretch the "D."
Gonna open up some space.
What are we gonna do?
I fill the open lane.
I fill in for Pav's lane.
That's it, that's it!
Attaway, boys.
Come on.
Attaway, Jimmy!
Don't let them have it!
Attaboy! Yeah!
Come on, build your legs up, boys. Build your legs.
You're not gonna have anything left for the third period if you don't build your legs now.
Here.
What's that give us, boys?
- Options.
- All right, let's run it.
- How's it going?
- What's going on?
We're playing the Soviets three days before Lake Placid?
Yeah, how about that?
How about that?
How about that?
Ah, that won't work with Wells.
Oh, Rizzo, you're killing me.
Why can't you find the net?
You've been staring at the same piece of paper since dinner.
Take a break.
How do I cut this kid?
He's done everything I've asked.
Well, so keep him.
I didn't think it was gonna be this hard.
This is "NBC Nightly News."
Yeah, you did.
With Jessica Savitch, and Dick Schaap with Sports.
This isn't gonna work.
I'd have to stick Christian on defense.
The embassy in Tehran is in the hands of Moslem students.
Wait. That works.
Spurred on by an anti-American speech
- Or Baker.
- by the Ayatollah Khomeini, they stormed the embassy, fought the Marine guard for three hours, overpowered them, and took dozens of American hostages.
- Oh, my God.
- Maybe that'll work.
Herb.
We have two reports, beginning with Steve Mallory.
United States Marine corps guards used tear gas to try to disperse the mob of Islamic students, but that wasn't enough.
Hundreds of Iranians finally overran the embassy compound, seizing about 90 people, mostly Americans.
The hostages, men and women, were blindfolded and herded into the embassy's basement.
Earlier today, the
Ayatollah Khomeini publicly...
We gave those guys at Harvard a good schooling.
Hey!
How about Johnson and Mcclanahan now?
Come on, that works.
Doesn't it?
They're starting to come together.
Thanks for coming out.
I wouldn't have missed it.
- Hey, you beat Harvard.
- Yeah.
Well, I should probably get going.
Yeah. Yeah.
I love you, Pop.
You too, son.
- Jimmy.
- Yeah?
You keep that glove up.
You got it.
Switch.
Rizzo's making dinner, boys.
You know there's gonna be meatballs.
You boys keep eating them,
I'll keep making them.
I think you guys are insane to eat that stuff.
No offense, Rizzo.
I wonder how it's gonna affect the chemistry of the boys.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Timmy.
Who the hell is that?
What's he doing here?
How you doing, Tim?
Good to see you.
Thanks, coach.
Hey, Bah.
- Yeah?
- Who's that guy?
Timmy Harrer.
Plays for the Gophers.
Having a big year.
- What the hell's he doing here?
- No idea.
Why is he here?
Hey, you guys know he was coming?
So, listen, why don't you warm up, stretch out, jump on Johnson's line for the day, okay?
Good to have you here.
- See you, boys.
- See you.
This is ridiculous.
Don't worry about it, Rammer.
It'll be all right.
Right, O.C.?
Herb's not gonna do a damn thing, boys.
He's just messing with our minds.
Oh, you think so, Jack?
Yeah, I do.
Well, we all know Herb made the Olympic team back in '60.
So?
So, a week before the games, coach Riley calls him into his office and sends him home.
What's your point?
My point, Jack, is that one week later,
Herb's on his couch with his old man, watching his team win the gold medal.
Come that close and get nothing?
He'll do whatever it takes.
That's my point.
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Walter.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, you've talked to everybody else then, all right.
Nothing else we can do, then.
Thank you, Walter.
Is everything okay?
Walter says that there's talk carter may boycott the Moscow games next summer.
So if we don't go there, they might not come here, right?
Right.
Don't do this to yourself, Herb.
There are things you can control and things you can't.
No milk.
Herb.
Yeah, I heard you, honey.
You'll still have everything you won here.
Don't tell me what I'll have, Patti.
You don't know this enough to tell me that.
You know, I understand you being upset with me when I say you work too hard teaching a simple game.
But don't ever criticize me for caring about you.
That's it.
Come on, boys, push it.
Here we go! Push it!
Go now! Move!
Damn it!
Come on, Rizzo.
I know, coach.
- I know.
- You know?
If you knew, then why did you do it again?
You start putting the puck in the net, or you're not going anywhere.
And don't think I won't do it.
Johnson, line up!
Let's go!
Come on!
Shoot it!
Up and around!
Keep it moving!
Attaboy!
Center, center, center!
- Now move it up!
- Go, Mike, go!
Drop it back.
Go to the net, Timmy!
Go to the net!
Go, go, go!
Whoo!
Yeah!
Nice play, boys.
Nice play.
Goal scored by number 18, Tim Harrer.
Change them up, boys.
Let's go.
Come on, boys.
Let's go, boys!
Timmy.
You keep driving the net.
That's all I care about, okay?
That puck goes across the blue line, you drive to the net.
Okay.
All right.
Herb.
Some of the boys want to have a word.
What about?
I think you ought to hear them out.
This had better take about two minutes.
This is crazy, Herb.
Bringing him in this late.
Hey, we got parents buying tickets, getting rooms.
What are we supposed to tell them?
And with one of us going home as it is?
I don't have to ask where you stand on this, huh, Rizzo?
This wasn't Rizzo's idea.
You want me to say
I'm scared of getting cut?
I'm scared of getting cut.
Everybody is.
We just want it to be fair.
Don't even try telling me that.
He was in Colorado.
That was 6 months ago.
You don't think he's been playing for the last 6 months?
- Not with us, he hasn't.
- So?
- So there's a difference.
- Like hell there is!
All I know is that kid can flat-out play.
We can't?
He moves the puck, he's got great vision on the ice.
That's not the point!
I'll tell you something else he's got.
He's got the attitude I want on and off the ice, so somebody better explain to me why I shouldn't be giving him a look.
Because we're a family.
What?
We're a family.
A family?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And this is the family you want to go to Lake Placid with?
Definitely.
- Yeah, without a doubt.
- Absolutely.
Wouldn't have it any other way.
Timmy Harrer can help us, boys.
And I'm gonna send him home.
We got one more to get down to 20.
You understand.
Yep.
Looks like you got yourself a team.
Almost.
- Let's talk about it.
- The rules.
Well, your girl left these at my place.
With some milk and cookies.
Give her a hug for me.
You guys are unbelievable.
Real funny, guys.
Hey, boys.
We still got two more presents to open up.
Yeah.
Pardon me, coach.
Yeah?
Coach Patrick, from the boys.
Oh.
Here we go.
I thought you forgot.
"To Craig."
That's beautiful, boys.
- You're gonna like this one.
- What?
That's very good.
That's very good.
- Perfect.
- Again!
Again!
All right.
That's enough of that.
It's going back in the box.
And, Herb.
Merry Christmas from the boys.
Drumroll, please.
Coach.
Ah, yes.
The gift that keeps on giving.
No.
No.
Speech.
Speech.
- "Ayatollah."
- Speech.
Speech.
Well, this may come as a shock to some of you guys, but I'm not really very good at giving sentimental speeches.
- No?
- You're kidding?
Come on.
I don't think
I should start tonight.
Hey, thanks for having me over, Velta.
Good night, Herb.
- Doc, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Herb.
You guys have a great holiday.
Merry Christmas, coach.
Merry Christmas, coach.
Play some football!
By many as the most important speech of President Carter's term.
A look back now as 830 WCCO's year-end special continues.
The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America.
The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of July.
It is the idea which founded our nation and has guided our development as a people.
Confidence in the future has supported everything else.
We've always believed in something called "progress."
We've always had a faith that the days of our children will be better than our own.
Our people are losing that faith.
For the first time in the history of our country, a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years.
We were taught that our armies were always invincible, and our causes were always just, only to suffer the agony of Vietnam.
We respected the presidency as a place of honor until the shock of Watergate.
We've got to stop crying and start sweating.
Stop talking and start walking.
Working together with our common faith.
We cannot fail.
- Yeah.
- Hard workout.
Silk, you guys want to grab something to eat?
Yeah, I'm starving.
Where you guys gonna go?
Maybe that Mario's place.
Mario's?
Hey, coach.
Coxie.
Herb wants to see you.
Come in.
Coach Patrick said you wanted to see me.
Why don't you have a seat there, Ralph?
Well, there's just no easy way of doing this.
The rules say that we gotta be down to 20 men, and right now we're at 21.
I wish like hell
I could keep you, Ralph.
I do.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
You're a hell of a hockey player.
This doesn't change that.
Thanks.
Well...
Thanks for giving me a shot, coach.
Thanks for giving me your very best.
- Yeah?
- Herb, Walter.
Well, you've got your wish.
Brezhnev's telling Carter to screw himself.
Yeah, Walter, how's that?
The Kremlin just released a statement today saying they're gonna prove how good they are by beating us over here on our own ice.
They're all gonna play.
The Soviets, the Czechs, the whole bunch of them.
Have you got your roster finalized yet?
Yeah, I got my team.
Well, I still don't know why you scheduled this, Herb, but get your guys to New York.
They've got a game to play.
♪ Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave ♪
♪ O'er the land of the free ♪
♪ And the home of the brave? ♪
Ladies and gentlemen, your 1980 U.S. Olympic Team.
And so, as we await the opening face-off in this game between the Soviet Union and Team USA at Madison Square Garden, the teams line up on their respective blue lines.
And Soviet Union team captain
Boris Mikhailov skating over to his bench to pick up that NHL challenge trophy.
The trophy that his team won here at Madison Square Garden last October, and won in decisive fashion, beating the NHL All-Stars.
Getting a mixed reaction from the capacity audience here.
Some cheers, but a few boos going through the crowd as well.
And now the two teams clear the ice and repair to their respective goals as we get set for the opening face-off in this final tune-up for these two teams before the Olympic Games in Lake Placid.
USA!
And as we get set to drop the puck for this contest, the Soviets starting their big line of Mikhailov between
Kharlamov and Petrov.
Team USA countering with Mark Johnson at center between Mcclanahan and Dave Silk.
And we're ready to go with this warm-up contest.
Want to go hard, boys?
Here!
It's the Soviet Union in control, making a charge into the Team USA zone.
Corner!
Move it out!
And in behind the Team USA net.
Puck bounced back to the blue line.
Moving in with a shot, stopped by Jimmy Craig, and it goes into the corner.
Finally Team USA gets its stick on the puck as Ramsey brings it up to the blue line.
He's absolutely flattened there by Kasatonov.
Two-on-one!
Team Soviet Union turning it into a two-on-one.
Back door, O.C., look out!
Get the puck!
Moving in to the boards, shoots and scores.
Come on!
Hey, break it up!
Break it up!
That's it.
Let's go.
That's a nice expression on your face.
Let's get it back, boys.
Get it back!
Jack, you gotta listen to me!
You gotta listen to me!
The Soviets breaking out of their own zone now, up the ice to center.
Krutov goes in over the U.S. blue line.
Shoots and scores.
He's in front and scores.
Shoots. He scores.
He shoots.
He scores!
The Soviet Union drubbing Team USA 10-3.
There's always things you can work on.
This club's no exception to that.
You know, I think we're gonna be all right.
This Soviet team has been together for 10 years.
We got college kids still getting to know each other.
They could have won this thing 30-0.
Herb, Herb!
Herb Brooks!
Sorry.
How is he?
Well, I'm not sure if he needs surgery yet.
I'm hoping it's just a ligament pull, but it could be a tear.
Look, Herb, we got three days until Sweden.
You give him a roster spot, it's a waste of money.
Give me a "best case."
He'll miss three or four games minimum.
That's the whole qualifying round.
Kid's made the team, he's busted his ass for me, and now I gotta send him home, that the deal?
What'd Doc say?
Oh, he doesn't know yet, O.C.
He's gonna go with you to the hospital and get a picture of your knee taken.
Then we'll see.
Thinking about sitting you down, Jim.
- What are you talking about?
- Nah, it's not your fault.
I played you way too much, and you're too tired.
Oh, I think it's time
I gave Jannie a look.
- He's been waiting.
- You're kidding me.
- Now?
- Yeah, of course I mean now.
- That's my net, man.
- They just scored 10 goals.
Right now it's everybody's net.
Whoa, wait a second.
I've given you everything I've got.
Have you?
Given me your very best?
'cause I know there's a lot more in you.
A whole other level that you just don't want to go to.
Oh, what the hell.
You don't even understand.
Oh, no, I'll tell you what I don't understand, Herb.
I don't understand you.
Nobody on this team understands you and your ridiculous sayings and your drills and those stupid psychology tests you had everybody take.
Everybody?
What?
So that's what this is about?
Because I didn't take your test?
Fine!
I'll take your test.
Is that what you want?
No.
I want to see that kid in the net who wouldn't take the test.
You gotta be kidding me.
What did he do?
Well, he did something amazing.
He started to laugh.
And then everybody in the whole audience started to laugh.
It sounds funny, but I was so proud of him.
I was starting to think that our son takes after you.
Well, that's all part of my plan.
My, you're a very smart woman.
I miss you.
Oh, the Games are only a couple of days away now.
You got your airplane tickets?
Oh, yeah.
Walter had them sent over.
Yeah.
- I guess I'll see you then.
- You sound tired.
You should try and get some sleep.
Yeah, well...
All right.
- I'll talk to you.
- Hey, Patti.
Yeah?
I miss you, too.
Good night.
Good night.
Okay, I'll check on O.C.
Take care of these guys here.
Come on, guys.
Stick with me.
Next.
This is your room key.
And this is your I.D. badge that you'll need for just about everything.
Don't lose it.
Herb.
Herb.
Herb, it'll be fine.
I can fight through it.
Okay, why don't you join the boys over there, O.C.?
It's good to see you, kid.
Attaboy.
- Well?
- It's not a tear.
It's a stretched ligament, so he won't need surgery.
But there is no way he can play before the medal round.
Forget about the medal round.
You keep O'callahan, and you lose one more skater, you're gonna have a tough time putting a decent hockey team on the ice.
It's that simple, Herb.
I asked Herb.
He's keeping me in the dark.
Oh, boy.
So if he gets shaky, it's you.
Stay loose, Jannie.
All right.
You're in there tomorrow, Jimmy.
Let's bring it up, now.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, man.
Attaboy, Jimmy.
Go get them.
I'll see you on the bus.
All right.
Doc said no, right?
He said you might be able to go in a week.
Maybe two.
What if it's two?
That puts me in a tight spot, doesn't it?
Jack, I got 20 guys to think about here, and they're all looking at me to do what's best.
I understand, coach.
Which is why
I'm hanging on to you.
I swear to God, Herb, if you're not being serious right now.
I'm only saying this if you promise you won't even think about asking me to play.
I won't.
I mean, I will,
I promise you, coach.
'cause if you do, Jack, I'll stick your ass on an airplane and you're headed back to Boston.
All right,
Doc's waiting for you.
Thank you, Herb.
Whoo!
O.C. is playing, baby!
Boys, move your feet!
Ramsey with the puck, passes to Eruzione.

And a big hit by Dave Christian.

Mike, where is it?
- Up. This way.
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, that.
- That's it.
Ahlberg shoots.
Save by Craig.
Eruzione fighting for it.
Mike Eruzione recently named team captain by coach Herb Brooks for his firm footing, his leadership qualities on and off the ice.
Hey, I'm taking him out.
The U.S. team is playing tentative hockey tonight, Al.
Tough draw having to face Sweden, third-best team in the world.
- You know what I mean?
- No, I got you.
Look, I think it's worth a try.
Okay.
What's the deal with Mac?
Upper-leg contusion.
I think he's done for the night.
- What if he plays?
- I don't understand, Herb.
If he plays on it, can he hurt it any worse?
Well, no, but it will be very painful for him, and he won't be able to do very much.
This is unbelievable!
You guys are playing like this is some throwaway game up in Rochester.
- Who we playing, Rammer?
- Sweden.
Yeah, you're damn right!
Sweden!
In the Olympics!
What the hell's wrong with you?
Put your gear on.
I said, "Put your gear on."
- Doc told me I can't play.
- Yeah, I know.
You got a bad bruise.
You know what?
Put your street clothes on.
'cause I got no time for quitters.
Come on, Herb.
Nobody's quitting here.
You worry about your own game.
Plenty there to keep you busy.
A bruise on the leg is a hell of a long way from the heart, you candy-ass.
- What'd you call me?
- You heard me.
You want me to play?
Is that what you want?
I want you to be a hockey player!
I am a hockey player!
You want me to play on one leg, huh?
I'll play on one leg!
- That'll get them going.
- Oh, yeah.
- Will that make you happy?
- I'll clean up.
I am a hockey player!
2:49 remaining in the game.
Sweden leading 2-1.
The U.S. team has fought hard, but they've still got nothing to show for it.
This is a crucial game.
If they don't beat or tie the Swedes, it'll be very difficult to advance to the medal round.
Mcclanahan after the loose puck.
He's hit hard by Soderstrom.
- Go, go, go, Mac!

- Passes across to Ahlberg.
Wrist shot. Knocked out of the air by Craig.
Puck picked up by Suter, moved ahead to Johnson.
Switch them up!
Go, go!
Johnson gets rid of it and heads to the bench with just over a minute and a half left to play.
Precious seconds ticking away for this U.S. team.
What are you doing with Baker out there?
1 :20, Herb.
Herb Brooks has molded this unit.
Seven months of training.
Points to the net, just a little over a minute left to avoid a very damaging loss.

And the U.S. team is still very much alive in the opening round.
It was a hell of a move.
I didn't see him out there.
I'm Jim McKay, and we're back again live in Lake Placid, New York.
What an amazing start for these
13th Olympic Winter Games.
After a remarkable last-minute tie against Sweden two nights ago, the U.S. hockey team, huge underdogs, pulled off a tremendous upset last night, defeating Czechoslovakia, considered the second-best team behind the Soviet Union.
The final score, 7-3.
"Why so many reporters?"
Are you serious?
Well, we won two games.
We got a ways to go here.
Think of what they've had to write about.
Hostages, Afghanistan.
Transportation chaos.
Patti probably has talked to you about that.
Listen, Herb, the bottom line is that your young guys just kicked the crap out of Czechoslovakia, and this is something that this country is ready for.
Now, you want to see reporters?
Win a couple of more games.
They are just kids, Walter, so let's not turn this into something more, okay?
I'm not sure we got any control over it.
Victor.
Somebody's gonna beat those guys.
Buzz Schneider flying up the right wing.
Takes a long pass from Ramsey.

Coach Brooks!
Monsieur!
Monsieur!
Herb!
Herb, now that Norway is behind you, what do you look for out of Romania?
It should be a tough test.
We're sure not gonna overlook them.
- Herb!
- Coach!
Mike.
All right, Jimmy Craig's been great between the pipes.
Is there any chance we could talk to him?
Well, as I said the other night,
Mike, you know, this isn't an individual effort going on here.
It's about a team.
We're a team on the ice, and we're gonna be one off it.
Palavka breaking up the left side, chased by Christian.
Behind the U.S. net.
Drops the pass.
Slams it.
Shot.
Glove save by Jim Craig.
The U.S. up 7-2 here late in the third.
Well, making it to the medal round was always our goal from day one, so we feel real good about what we've accomplished so far.
Herb!
Still no chance we can talk with any of your players?
- Still no chance.
- Okay.
How do you respond to those who feel you're doing this to keep the spotlight on yourself?
Luzbach.
Esom across to Krutzman.
Ooh! He's hit hard into the boards by Strobel.
Huge hit.
Ramsey has it, moves it up to Verchota.
Verchota across the blue line.
Lines up.
He scores!
Verchota puts it past Sutner to put the U.S. up 4-2 with 15:43 remaining to play here in the third period.
And we'll be staying with this one right to the end.
The pairings for the medal round are as follows.
The United States will play the Soviet Union in the first game tomorrow.
Sweden and Finland in the second game.
The face-off for the U.S.-Soviet game is 1700 hours.
Now, if you have any questions, we have the U.S. assistant coach, Craig Patrick.
- Patrick.
- Coach Patrick.
- Craig.
- Coach Patrick.
Right here.
Where's Herb Brooks?
How come he's not here today?
Herb is out preparing for tomorrow's game.
Craig!
Yeah?
Yeah?
Hi, Daddy.
There we go.
There was no whipped cream.
That's all right.
- What?
- What?
I got a telegram from a lady in Texas today.
You know what it said?
"Beat those commie bastards."
Wow.
We're playing against the greatest team in the world, maybe the best that's ever played this game.
Why can't we just leave it at that?
Because this is more than a hockey game to a lot of people.
Yeah, I keep running through them all.
Johnson on Mikhailov.
Broten on Petrov.
Pav against whoever-ov.
We just...
We don't match up, Patti.
You might want to skip that when you talk to the boys tomorrow.
Herb.
Herb.
There's no disgrace in losing to this team.
I know.
The important thing is you got this far.
The important thing is those
20 boys knowing in 20 years, they didn't leave anything on the table.
That they played their hearts out.
That's the important thing.
Hey, Craig.
Walter.
Great, great job.
- Great.
- Thanks. Sure is.
- Sure is.
- Hey, Craig.
Any chance we can wish the boys luck?
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob.
You know Herb.
Not a good time right now.
After the game, all right?
All right?
- Hey, Craig, whoa, hold up.
- I can't.
Herb doesn't want any distractions.
It's understandable.
We just wanted to wish them luck.
Okay, that's...
You ready to go?
You serious?
Am I playing?
Suit up.
Great moments are born from great opportunity.
And that's what you have here tonight, boys.
That's what you've earned here tonight.
One game.
If we played them ten times, they might win nine.
But not this game.
Not tonight.
Tonight we skate with them.
Tonight we stay with them.
And we shut them down because we can.
Tonight we are the greatest hockey team in the world.
You were born to be hockey players.
Every one of you.
And you were meant to be here tonight.
This is your time.
Their time is done.
It's over.
I'm sick and tired of hearing about what a great hockey team the Soviets have.
Screw them.
This is your time.
Now, go out there and take it.
Hold up here a second, guys.
We're just gonna wait for the okay.
Yeah.
We're all set.
All right.
Go ahead and send them in.
- It's time.
- Let's go.
Come on, Jimmy, Buzzy.
Let's hustle.
Here we go.
Come on, Bakes.
Come on, Brots, Dave.
Let's go, Strobel.
USA!
- Rizzo!
- Let's go.
The excitement, the tension building.
The Olympic center filling to capacity.
The face value of a top ticket for tonight's game, $67.20.
Outside they were exchanging hands at three times the face value.
USA!
USA!
Hello again, everybody.
I'm Al Michaels along with Ken Dryden.
It should be a great night.
I'm sure there are a lot of people who do not know the difference between a blue line and a clothesline.
It's irrelevant.
It doesn't matter.
Because what we have at hand, the rarest of sporting events.
An event that needs no buildup, no superfluous adjectives.
In a political or nationalistic sense, this game is being viewed with varying perspectives.
But manifestly it is a hockey game.
The United States and the Soviet Union on a sheet of ice in Lake Placid, New York.
Ken, some of your thoughts before the game.
Well, for the U.S. team, it's really discovery time.
It's one thing to be young and promising.
And it's quite another to be good.
And in the next 2 1/2 hours, the U.S. players will go through perhaps the most difficult and demanding yet exhilarating time of their lives.
They will be playing against the best team in the world, a team that's far better than they are, a team that's dominated world hockey for the last 15 years.
In the crowd, Jim Craig's father, Donald Craig.
It's been a difficult time for the Craig family with the passing of Jimmy's mom.
One of her dreams was to have her son play on this team.
So this has to be an emotional night for the two of them.
They don't look too nervous down there.
The U.S. team very young.
Average age, 21 years old.
The Soviets much more seasoned.
Some of them have been playing together for the last 15 years.
Let's go, here, boys.
And this game is about to get underway.
All right.
On three, boys.
One, two, three!
USA!
Jim Craig in goal for the United States.
Vladislav Tretiak, considered the best goalie in the world, in the nets for the Soviet Union.

Move on him!
Move on him!
Carried up ice by Kasatonov.
The pass is to Petrov.

Shot. Stopped!
- Petrov tries to lead now.
- Watch point!
To Makarov at the point.
He fires it along the boards.
Picked up behind the net by Buzz Schneider.
- Come on!
- That's a slash!
Schneider losing it.
Out to the point.
Slap shot!
Deflected in!
That was a slash!
The Soviet Union takes a 1-0 lead.
Kasatonov's slap shot was deflected in past Craig.
So the Soviet Union leads, 1-0, early in the first period.
Forget about it now.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.
Mikhailov and Christoff facing off at center ice.
Here we go, boys.
Move it!
- Kharlamov to Mikhailov.
- Pick it up!
Mikhailov up the boards and into the corner.
To Kharlamov for a quick shot.
Big save by Jim Craig.

O.C., get in there!
The Soviets control it.
Kasatonov.
Let's see the "D"!
Krutov with the puck now.
A big hit by Jack O'callahan.
Pavelich up ahead to Schneider.
Slap shot.
Whoo!
Yeah!
That's the type of goal you don't expect someone like Tretiak to give up.
The United States ties the game at one.
Jack O'callahan returning after a serious knee injury at Madison Square Garden, making a big contribution with that hit on Krutov.

Come on, now.
Pick him up.
Don't let him through the middle.
Golikov crossing center ice.
Leaves it for Makarov.
Makarov around Morrow.
And he scores.
Oh!
Makarov put the puck right between Morrow's legs, skated in, and scored.
That was a textbook
Soviet passing play.
Beautifully done.
Once this team gets rolling, it's almost impossible to stop them.
24 gets the goal.
Give 25 the assist, boys.
And with the Soviets leading, 2-1, Ken, the U.S. teams knows that all too well after what happened with these two teams at Madison Square Garden
13 days ago.
USA!
Now tonight's referee,
Carl Keisler, calling the players over for the face-off.
And you can hear the crowd trying to reinvigorate this U.S. team.
Face-off won by the Soviets.
Fetisov across to Kasatonov.
He circles behind his own net.
Leaves it for Fetisov.
Get the pressure on them in there! Come on!
- Pick him up!
- Watch the pass!
To Maltsev.
Over to Makarov.
Shot stopped by Craig.
Don't let them have that middle so easy.
Less than a half minute remaining in the first period.
And the U.S. can't clear it.
Petrov with the puck.
Quick pass to Kharlamov.
Stopped by Craig!
Petrov tries for the rebound.
Craig knocks it away.
Kasatonov with a shot.
- Craig with another save!
- Keep going hard!
Play it out!
And the U.S. team finally clears it.
It looks like the U.S. will be able to end the period only a goal down, a tremendous achievement.
Johnson, go!
The puck is picked up by Christian in the neutral zone.
Long shot.
Easy save by Tretiak.
But Johnson is there.
And scores!
With one second to play in the period!
Right now the clock shows nothing.
It was stopped at one when we looked up and the goal was scored.
Right now it shows nothing as the period, apparently, has come to an end.
But the United States has tied the game.
A big, big goal for the U.S. team.
Dave Christian took a shot from the other side of center ice, knowing there was almost no time on the clock.
But the rebound comes right out to Mark Johnson, who goes wide of Tretiak to tie it up.
Tikhonov very upset.
Questioning the goal.
The time on the clock shows zero.
Keisler, the referee, indicating that the goal stands and the period is over.
And this crowd is electrified.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Tikhonov, like his team, not normally prone to showing much emotion.
As the teams skate off to their respective dressing rooms, this game is tied at 2 on an incredible last-second goal by Mark Johnson.
♪ Coke adds life ♪
Wow!
Thanks, Mean Joe.
♪ Smile ♪
And we're back for the start of the second period for what is turning out to be a very exciting game.
If you're just joining us, there were four goals scored in the first period.
Two by the Soviets.
Two by the Americans.
There'll be a change for the Soviet Union, as Vladimir Myshkin becomes the new goalie after Tretiak had given up two goals in the first period.
Al, this is a big move.
Tretiak's been Tikhonov's bread and butter for a decade.
Still, Myshkin is a very capable backup.
Well, boys, you just put the best goaltender in the world on the bench.
It is very uncommon to see Vladislav Tretiak taken out and something we have not seen in these Olympics.
Let's go, now, boys.
Come on!
And here we go.
The second period is underway.
The conehead line out for the United States.
Jim Craig in goal.
Krutov with the puck.
Down the right side.
Centering pass.
Shot.
Swatted away by Craig.
Attaboy, Jimmy!

He can give the U.S. the lead.
He shoots.
Stopped by Myshkin.
Fetisov up to Maltsev.
Maltsev gets past Christian.
Shoots.
The rebound!
Maltsev scores!
And the Soviets take the lead,
Jim Craig knocked down on the play by Kharlamov, allowing Maltsev an easy goal on an open net.
And Jim Craig's not getting up, Ken.
This could be devastating to the U.S., Al.
Jim Craig's been the anchor of this team, playing every minute of every game here in Lake Placid.
Herb Brooks may now be faced with replacing Craig with his backup goalie,
Steve Janaszak.
Janaszak played on Brooks' championship team
Last year at the University of Minnesota.
But he's played very little over the last six months and not at all during these Olympics.
Jimmy, you need Doc?
No. I'm good.
Just give me a second.
Take your time.
Take your time.
Jim Craig back on his feet now.
Shaking it off, and it appears he'll remain in this game.
Attaboy, Jimmy!
Getting a huge hand from this very appreciative crowd.
Come on, boys.
Let's get them, now!
The Soviet Union, 3, the United States, 2.
We're back for the start of the third period.
20 minutes left in a game that's closer than most anyone anticipated.
The teams were tied, 2-2, after the first.
And the Soviets are now leading, 3-2.
Al Michaels here at the Olympic center with former Montreal Canadians goalie Ken Dryden.
The American team comes into this medal round unbeaten.
The Soviets are also unbeaten, winning all five of their games, scoring 51 goals in the process.
The U.S., four wins and a tie against Sweden and a huge upset win over
Czechoslovakia eight days ago.
Herb Brooks' young team is trying to overcome enormous odds to beat the best team in the world tonight.
USA! USA! USA!
Boys!
Come here!
Bring it in.
Listen to them.
USA! USA! USA!
That's what you've done.
We've come from behind in every game in this tournament so far, and we can do it again.
We can beat these guys!
Come on, Herb.
Get your guys to the face-off.
Everybody in.
- Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
Let's do this.
Who do you play for?
USA!
Come on, boys!
As the third period begins, the crowd is chanting.
Everyone on their feet.
The Americans are winless against the Soviets since 1960.
And since that day at Squaw Valley, it's been 20 years since a U.S. team has defeated the Soviets.
The Soviets, of course, have been gold-medal winners in every Olympic Games since 1960.
The top Soviet line is out there right now.

Coneheads! Let's go!
Coneheads!
This is a big opportunity for the U.S.
They haven't been able to go on the offense for quite some time now, and this is the chance.

Come on, boys. Let's take advantage of this now!

Only a goal!
USA goal scored by number 10, Johnson.
Assist, number 8, Silk.
Time, 4:43.
Ken, a couple months ago, did you think this was remotely possible?
No. Absolutely not.
But the thing with the U.S. team is they're very young, very talented.
And now they're beginning to believe.
There's my boy!
Way to work!
Score to tie the game.
3-3, the United States and the Soviet Union.

- Pavelich has it now.

He shoots.
He scores!
Mike Eruzione!
Whoo! Whoo!
Right now we've got bedlam!
Anyone who was at
Madison Square Garden two weeks ago who's watching this game tonight has got to be shocked.
Oh, I love Brooks' reaction.
Thataway, Rizzo!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
USA! USA! USA!
And the chant resumes.
Mike Eruzione out of Boston University, the captain of this U.S. team, has just put the U.S. ahead for the first time exactly halfway through the third period.
USA goal scored by number 21, Eruzione.
This U.S. team was demoralized by the Soviets.
Very tentative.
Very nervous.
Very much in awe of the Soviet team.
And this is a U.S. team that is not in awe of anyone.
Keep it going, now, boys!

USA!
USA!
Beautiful! Beautiful!
Yes!
USA! USA! USA!
Way to go, coach!
Yes!
Yes!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Two days later, the miracle was made complete,
My boys defeated Finland to win the gold medal, coming from behind once again,
As I watched them out there, celebrating on the ice,
I realized that Patti had been right,
It was a lot more than a hockey game,
Not only for those who watched it, but for those who played in it,
I've often been asked in the years since Lake Placid what was the best moment for me,
Well, it was here,
The sight of 20 young men of such differing backgrounds now standing as one,
Young men willing to sacrifice so much of themselves all for an unknown,
A few years later, the U,S, began using professional athletes at the games,
Dream teams,
I always found that term ironic because now that we have dream teams, we seldom ever get to dream,
But on one weekend, as America and the world watched, a group of remarkable young men gave the nation what it needed most,
A chance, for one night, not only to dream,
But a chance, once again, to believe,

And see you guys later, okay?
There.
Technicals, nine o'clock.
Oh, shit! Did you see that?
Chief, we got unarmed civilians getting shot down here at nine o'clock.
I got it, Matt. I don't think we can touch this.
Command, Super 64... we got militia shooting unarmed civilians down at the food distribution center.
Request permission to engage.
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.
Negative, command.
U.N. 's jurisdiction, 64. We cannot intervene.
- Return to base. Over.
- Roger.
64 returning.
Leaving.
General Garrison?
No, no, thanks. I got one.
But these are Cuban.
Bolivar Belicoso.
So is this.
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.
I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.
Me?
But am I that important?
I hardly think so.
- You're just a businessman.
- Trying to make a living.
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.
You've been here, what?
Six weeks?
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.
You put up reward posters.
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?
It's the O.K. Corral.
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?
Make him more agreeable?
You know where he sleeps.
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.
And we will find him.
Don't make the mistake of thinking because I grew up without running water...
I am simple, General.
I do know something about history.
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.
A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.
Mr. Garrison,
I think you shouldn't have come here.
This is civil war.
This is our war.
Not yours.
300,000 dead and counting.
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?
How'd he strike you?
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.
Yeah, he's a good catch.
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.
I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.
I'm just saying they've been calling for these dang situation reports... every morning this week.
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.
I'll be your pilot this afternoon.
Federal regulations has designated the non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.
For those of you moved on
Mogadishu frequent flyer program... you'll be earning 100 free credits this afternoon.
And as always, the air sickness bags are located in the seatback in front of you.
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.
You're still clear.
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.
I've got some bad news.
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.
"Limo" is a word in common usage.
That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend. Common usage.
No, if it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!
It does have to be in the dictionary!
Listen, when we get back to the base, it's coming off the board.
You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you,
Nightstalker. You hear me?
Yeah, promises.
That's a nice beach down there.
How's the water?
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.
That's great.
- Thinks he's funny.
- Yeah. Well, I don't.
Hear that?
- Nervous?
- I'm ready to go, man.
Beautiful day to fight.
- Name.
- Todd.
- Last name.
- Blackburn.
First name, Todd.
- So, what's it like?
- What's what like?
Mogadishu. The fighting.
- Serial number.
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.
Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask.
Why not?
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?
You're not a Ranger.
I am a Ranger. Six years.
I was in Panama chasing down Noriega, and in the Gulf.
I'm a vet, my friend.
In combat?
Look, kid, you look like you're about 12, so let me explain something to you.
I have a rare and mysterious skill that precludes me from going into missions.
Typing.
- Can you type?
- No.
- Date of birth.
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.
Let's bring it in.
Nice, man! Very smooth!
Single shot through the engine block.
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Fucking Delta.
Sergeant Eversmann.
- Sergeant.
- Yeah?
Private First Class Blackburn.
Yeah?
Reporting for duty.
Not to me you're not.
You're reporting to It. Beales.
He should be around here somewhere.
Can I leave him with you?
Yeah, go ahead.
- You brought your weapon.
- Yes, sir.
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.
- When did you get in?
- Just now, Sarg'nt.
First things first.
This will be your best friend in all of Africa.
It's called BullFrog.
Get some on over here, all right?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Schmid! Take over for me, would you?
All right. Let's get you unpacked.
Hey, who's hungry?
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?
- Not if General Garrison is asking.
- I'm asking.
Have a nice meal, Captain.
- Hey, man, there's a line.
- I know.
- Well, this isn't the back of it.
- Yeah, I know.
Sergeant. Sergeant.
What's going on here?
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.
I'm talking about your weapon.
Now, Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.
Well, this is my safety, sir.
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.
When we get on the five-yard line, you're going to need my Rangers.
So y'all better learn to be team players.
We're done here.
Speak up. You say this is your safety?
Well, this is my boot, son.
And it will fit up your asses with the proper amount of force.
- Is that a Jersey accent?
- I'm trying to do this, give me a break.
Take those sunglasses off, soldier.
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business.
I don't want to see them on you again.
Hoo-ah?
Is that a hot weapon?
Is that your move?
Is my hand on the piece?
I can mate you in three whatever you do.
I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling with the others.
Well, she's just lying in wait.
Stranded and condemned, Gordy.
Your move.
Cribbs.
Yikes.
It's good. You're really improving.
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.
Go ahead.
- It's a children's book, right?
- Right.
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.
This is the part of the story where our knight, our warrior... is about to slay the one-eyed dragon.
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.
Thought you finished that last week.
You done?
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.
You understand?
Can you count? One, two, ten.
Okay? Where are my running backs?
Where are my running backs?
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday, soldier.
You had something more important to do?
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.
I will make you believe, you understand?
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.
All right, carry on.
- I'd like a word, specialist.
- Sir.
Tell me, Pilla, you understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?
Roger that, sir.
'Cause if I ever see you undermine me again... you'll be cleaning latrines with your tongue... till you can't taste the difference between shit and French fries.
- Are we clear?
- Hoo-ah, sir.
All right.
Listen to this:
If one skinny kills another skinny, his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.
A hundred camels.
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.
Is that really true, Lieutenant?
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes the skinnies.
Sgt. Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.
He believes in this mission down to his very bones. Don't you, Sergeant?
Look, these people, they have no jobs... no food, no education, no future.
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.
We can either help... or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.
Right?
I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.
Like the man said, he's an idealist.
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.
Stay away from the cans!
Die, gas-pumper!
Stay away from those cans!
Beales!
No, no, stay back, stay back.
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.
- You got a problem with that?
- No, sir.
Now, it's a big responsibility.
Your men are gonna look to you to make the right decisions.
Their lives depend on it.
All right.
- Rangers lead the way, sir.
- All the way.
Good luck, Sergeant.
A long anticipated meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours.
I say "may" because we all know by now... with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain.
This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.
Two tier-one personalities may be present:
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor... and Abdi Hassan Awale, Interior Minister.
These are the guys we're after.
Today we go.
Same mission template as before.
1545, Assault Force Delta will infiltrate the target building... and seize all suspects within.
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks, under the command of Captain Steele... will rope in at 1546... and hold a four-corner perimeter around the target building.
No one gets in or out.
Extraction Force:
It. Colonel McKnight's humvee column will drive into the city at 1547... on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel here.
Wait for the green light.
Now once Delta gives the word...
McKnight's column will move to the target building... and load the prisoners on flatbed trucks.
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded... the four Ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building... load up on humvees... and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base.
Mission time from incursion to extraction, no longer than 30 minutes.
Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Spectre gunships... but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.
Too high-profile.
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover... with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.
Colonel Harrell.
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission... and I will coordinate ground forces.
Colonel Matthews.
Mission launch code word is Irene.
Questions?
Which building is it, sir?
Exactly which building, we're confirming right now.
Somewhere around the Bakara Market.
I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.
I didn't say a word, sir.
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara Market... you're in an entirely hostile district.
Don't underestimate their capabilities.
Now we'll be going through friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market... so remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.
Now, let's go get this thing done.
Good luck, gentlemen.
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night... late afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat... only part of the city Aidid can mount a serious counter-attack on short notice...
- What's not to like?
- Life's imperfect.
Yeah. For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.
You two say hello to me from up there.
You'll do fine.
Thanks.
What the fuck, Smith?
- Well?
- Well, what?
We going?
- Why should I tell you that?
- Because I'm me.
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.
- Bakara Market.
- All right.
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?
Keep sharp.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.
Nothing.
Hey.
Sit down.
How'd this happen?
I don't even remember.
Think I was just goofing off.
Playing ping-pong, I think.
Sort of hit the concrete.
Okay.
You can fix it up though.
We're going out today.
You're not going anywhere.
Jesus Christ!
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.
This, my friend, is a science.
I mean, you're looking at the guy that believed the commercials.
You know, about "be all you can be."
I made coffee through Desert Storm.
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight... got to be a Ranger.
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"
- What happened to you?
- Ping-Pong accident.
What?
So guess what.
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.
You're fucking me.
You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.
It's what you wanted, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.
Hell, yeah.
Grimesy, I want you to stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it.
- Hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah.
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.
Don't worry about it.
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.
Might even be fun.
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.
Choppers going to cover us, and we'll be all right.
Look, you guys, I know this is my first time as chalk leader... but, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.
We're elite.
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?
Hoo-ah!
Any questions?
We're going to be okay.
All right, grab your gear. Let's move out.
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.
You're not gonna need that, either.
We'll be back before dark.
You might as well take dope and beer instead.
What?
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got about 50 pounds of gear as it is.
You don't need another 12.
I don't know about you, but I don't plan on getting shot in the back running away.
Well, I better keep mine in.
Hey, Grimes.
The most important thing:
Just remember, when everybody else is shooting, shoot in the same direction.
All right.
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.
- That's bad luck.
- No, it's smart.
All Delta do that.
That's bad luck, too, man.
Come on, let's go.
It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis.
- If not, I don't know what you'd do.
- You're a funny guy, man.
- I'm not taking no death letter.
- We have a deal.
I'll give it to you back in an hour.
- Blackburn, you okay?
- Excited.
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.
You ever shot at anybody before?
No, sir.
Me neither.
Think he's reliable?
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
- Yes, sir.
Tell him to turn his radio off.
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy, leave us a message. Thank you.
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?
Pick up if you're there.
I'm just calling to check up on you, make sure everything's all right.
I'll call you in a couple hours.
You'd better not be sleeping.
Your move, Randy.
I'm missing you.
I love you, baby.
Hello? Hello?
Thanks, bud.
- Sorry, I didn't see you there.
- It's all right.
You know, it's kind of funny.
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.
Could almost be a good place to visit.
Almost.
You don't think we should be here.
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit... just goes right out the window.
I just want to do it right today.
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?
Abdi, come in.
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?
Abdi, come in.
Can you hear me? Abdi.
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?
To my right hand side, above the cafe.
Sir, he says this is the building.
He's certain?
Abdi, you need to be sure.
Are you sure?
Well, it's down the road, two blocks over on my left.
But there's too many militia.
If I go closer, they might shoot me.
Now he's saying the building's actually a couple blocks down... but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.
I'll fucking shoot him myself a couple blocks down.
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the damn building.
He's not getting paid till he does exactly that.
It's three miles to the target area.
We're never off the main roads.
At the K-four traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National... and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here.
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig... we load the prisoners, and then the assault-blocking forces... and bring them back.
Home in an hour. Okay?
Now there will be some shooting.
Bakara Market is the Wild West.
But be careful what you shoot at because people do live there.
Hoo-ah.
Hoo-ah.
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette in a bar.
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time?
- He sounds scared shitless.
- Good. That's always a good sign.
That's it. That's our signal.
All right.
All QRF out of the airspace.
All QRF out of the airspace.
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up and ready. Star 41 up and ready.
Irene!
Copy, Irene.
Fucking Irene!
Come on.
Good luck, boys.
Be careful.
No one gets left behind.
What's wrong?
Nothing. He's just never done that before.
Aw, fuck!
Let's go.
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.
Grimesy!
Two minutes.
Two minutes.
Why are they burning tires?
Signals to the militia that we're coming!
Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies on the ground.
Looks like I've got a tally on the voice intercept.
One minute.
One minute.
What's that for?
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.
Touching base.
Two feet, one foot... clear.
Little birds touching down at target.
Ropes!
Go! Go! Go!
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.
Down! Get down!
Down! Stay down!
Get down! Everybody down!
You, down!
Get down!
On the floor.
Captain Steele, tell your men to stop firing at us.
26, this is 64. Cease fire.
You're firing at Delta.
I repeat, cease fire. Over.
You stay close to that ammo, Grimesy.
Is this normal enemy fire?
No, no, this is 10 times worse than I've ever seen it.
Let's go, let's go!
Grimesy! No fear!
Oh, yeah, right!
Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.
Colonel, they're shooting at us!
Colonel, they're shooting at us!
Well, shoot back!
This is 64. Chalks on the ground, going into holding pattern.
Roger that.
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.
Super 62, take up an overhead pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground, going into holding pattern.
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!
Go, Blackburn!
RPG!
Hold on!
No!
C-2, we got a man fallen.
- Super-61, you're a sitting duck there.
- Blackburn!
Take up overhead pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.
Roger that. 61 coming out.
13, go ahead. I need you to move to the north of the street.
Right to the north.
Right there. Right there. Over.
Doc! Doc Schmid!
Come on!
Schmid, we got a man hit.
- Where's he hit?
- He's not. He fell.
- What?
- He fell.
Why aren't you shooting?
We're not being shot at yet!
How can you tell?
A hiss means it's close.
A snap means...
Now they're shooting at us!
Galentine!
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.
Blackburn, can you hear me?
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.
I can't get him!
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!
We need to get him out of here! Over.
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.
We've got a man down! Over.
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.
- Man down!
- Missed that, 25.
- Fuck it.
- Say again.
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.
Okay.
What did he say?
Super 61, we got a man wounded on the ground.
- Stretcher!
- Get me a stretcher!
Come on. Stretcher.
Come on, come on!
Grab this end!
Let's go!
- All right.
- Go.
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.
Up to the humvees! Now!
Go! Go!
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!
- Secure!
- Let's move out!
Everybody up! Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go! Let's move!
- Grimes, run!
- All right.
C-2, this is Super 61, beginning my orbit of the target area.
Roger that.
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.
Kilo 11, this is 61, providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.
Kilo 64, green light.
- Ready for extraction. Over.
- Roger that, Kilo 11. Will relay.
That's it. We got them.
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.
Roger that. There's the call. Let's move out!
- Let's move out!
- Hold on.
- How much longer?
- Five minutes, sir.
- What?
- Five minutes.
Nothing takes five minutes!
What happened to him?
- He fell! Missed the rope!
- How'd he do that?
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!
Let's go! Let's move it!
Move, move! Come on! Move!
Get him in there!
Get ready to move!
Go! Everybody move! Move!
Get the fuck up!
Grimes! Come on!
Grimes! Grimes!
Fuck this!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Let's go.
Come on!
Go! Move it!
Move!
Romeo 64, I need to send out three humvees with a critical casualty.
He looks real bad. I need to evac now.
Roger that, Uniform 64.
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you. Over.
Roger that.
Hey, Sanderson,
I need extra security on these humvees!
I'll go. I'll take my team, make sure they get back okay.
Do it.
Struecker, you're lead humvee.
First three vehicles mount up, we're moving back to base.
Move out!
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?
I don't want to talk about it now, Colonel!
I'm busy.
Sergeant Pilla's hit!
Christ, he's fucked up!
Is anyone hit?
Struecker, talk to me!
It's Sergeant Pilla!
What's his status?
What's his status?
He's dead.
He's dead.
Pilla's dead, sir.
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.
Roger that.
Get on that 50!
Someone get on that 50!
It's mine.
Three guys with RPGs, coming up on your side now!
Stay with it!
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.
You want to pull those PCLs off-line or what?
Right, babe.
Come on.
61 going down.
61 going down.
61 is going down. She is going down.
- Super 61 is going down.
- 61 is going down.
Super 61 is going down.
61 is going down.
I repeat, Super 61 going down.
61 is going down.
Hold on!
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.
Super 61 is on the deck now.
Get an MH-six on site. Check for survivors.
Send in the SAR bird.
I want ground forces to move and secure a new perimeter around that crash site.
Can you guide the convoy in there?
Roger that.
Well, move quick.
The whole damn city will be coming down on top of them.
Star 41, come inbound and see if you can land at the crash site.
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.
We just lost the initiative.
25, this is 64. Over.
This is 25. Over.
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk on foot to the crash.
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow. Over.
25, do you read me? Over.
Roger that.
Galentine! Schmid!
Go get Yurek.
Get Twombly.
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.
Twombly, Nelson, you're gonna stay here.
You're gonna hold this corner and then exfil with the humvees.
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
All right? Let's go.
- Hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah.
How come I got to stay back here?
Because you're dependable.
All right... let's go!
I hate being dependable, man.
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing, parallel west to your position.
Be advised, women and children among them. Over.
Hit the wall.
Incoming!
Grenade!
Go.
We still got guys inside!
All right, all right,
I'm gonna go to the crash.
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.
Negative! We're gonna proceed to the crash site together.
Secure the perimeter, wait for the humvees. Right, sir?
- Roger that.
- Follow my lead.
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.
All right, we need to move out now!
I'll finish loading the prisoners and pick you up at the crash site!
Let's move out!
Moving out! Go!
Get in! Get in!
Move!
Eight o'clock!
Hey, Grimes, stay away from the walls.
Hey, Grimes. You okay?
Yeah!
Let's go, Maddox.
- C-2, convoy's moving out.
- Roger that.
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!
Hey, Twombly!
What?
- I think they've forgotten us.
- What?
It doesn't matter.
63, confirm. We've got Skinnies moving in from all directions.
We need to get them help now.
Indigenous personnel advancing to Wolcott crash site.
Say again. Over.
A lot of people closing in.
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?
- Six blocks, sir.
- They need to haul ass.
Get down! Get down!
Scotty, are you okay?
No, don't go back!
Get down! Get down!
Technicals!
Got them!
Six o'clock! Move, move!
Come on. Get out of the way.
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Come on!
Yurek, leaving!
Come on!
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to the goddamn street!
You have to slow down. There's a delay.
From the time directions are relayed from surveillance to JOC, then to me.
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!
We can't slow down!
Danny, I'm getting information from Orion surveillance above.
So get me my fucking directions to the crash site!
Danny, hold on. I no longer have the best view of your route.
Just get your ass in the right place,
God damn it!
What in the hell is the status of Struecker's humvees?
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.
ETA to base momentarily.
Open the gate!
- Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on.
Watch his head.
Easy.
- Blackburn. Blackburn, you hear me?
- Get him to a medic.
Star 41 is at the crash site to evacuate the injured. Over.
Roger that.
I got you.
Easy.
Galentine, you all right?
Galentine, Kurth, with me! Cover fire, now.
Full cover!
How many are in there?
Two pilots are dead, the two crew chiefs are wounded!
This guy's hurt bad.
We gotta get out of here now.
All right. Go ahead.
26, 26, this is 25. Is that you shooting up the technicals? Over.
This is 26. Roger that.
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

{6698}{6745}{Y:i}It was a daring scheme.
{6749}{6857}{Y:i}A small party was to cross|the Antarctic continent for the first time.
{6862}{6895}{Y:i}According to legend...
{6899}{6997}{Y:i}...Shackleton announced the expedition|in a now-famous advertisement.
{7031}{7103}''Men wanted for hazardous journey.
{7108}{7202}Small wages, bitter cold...
{7207}{7257}...long months of complete darkness...
{7262}{7372}...constant danger,|safe return doubtful.
{7382}{7505}Honor and recognition|in case of success. Ernest Shackleton.''
{7522}{7614}My grandfather, Col. Orde-Lees,|was always looking for an opportunity...
{7666}{7705}...to do something exceptional.
{7714}{7809}And such an ad would have been catnip|to my grandfather.
{7813}{7876}He couldn't resist it.
{7905}{8017}Chippy McNish saw|an advertisement in the paper...
{8022}{8077}...looking for men to go to Antarctica...
{8130}{8202}...and it said that you might not return.
{8224}{8299}So he went and seen about it|and got there.
{8406}{8445}{Y:i}Five thousand men...
{8450}{8566}{Y:i}...from sailors to Cambridge-educated|scientists, responded.
{8578}{8718}{Y:i}Like Ernest Shackleton, they were|drawn by hopes of adventure and glory.
{8722}{8789}l had a dream when l was 22...
{8793}{8889}...that someday l would go to|the region of ice and snow...
{8893}{9042}...and go on and on till l came|to one of the poles of the Earth.
{9155}{9243}{Y:i}Exploration had earned Shackleton|fame and a knighthood...
{9247}{9330}{Y:i}...but he had still|not realized his dream.
{9334}{9410}{Y:i}Twice before, he had set out|to claim the South Pole...
{9414}{9475}{Y:i}...and twice|he had returned defeated...
{9479}{9597}{Y:i}...ultimately losing this prize|to Norwegian Roald Amundsen.
{9721}{9819}{Y:i}Shackleton's new venture|captured the British imagination.
{9823}{9887}{Y:i}Not all, however, were impressed.
{9892}{9963}{Y:i}First Lord of the Admiralty|Winston Churchill, for one...
{9967}{10042}{Y:i}...viewed the famous explorer|as a mere adventurer...
{10048}{10099}{Y:i}...and dismissed his latest project.
{10103}{10210}{Y:i}''Enough life and money has been spent|on this sterile quest, '' he wrote.
{10214}{10369}{Y:i}''The pole has already been discovered.|What is the use of another expedition?''
{10417}{10541}{Y:i}Nevertheless, in August 1 9 1 4, after|seven frantic months of preparation...
{10546}{10696}{Y:i}...Shackleton and his crew of 2 7 men|were poised for departure.
{10726}{10777}{Y:i}But even as his ship set sail...
{10782}{10906}{Y:i}...the world in which Shackleton's dream|had been conceived was coming apart.
{11097}{11165}{Y:i}World War I broke out in Europe.
{11189}{11289}{Y:i}Shackleton offered his ship and men|to Britain's war effort.
{11294}{11429}{Y:i}The Admiralty declined the offer|in a single word: ''Proceed. ''
{11514}{11609}{Y:i}Shackleton's ship, Endurance,|was named for his family motto:
{11614}{11657}{Y:i}''By endurance we conquer. ''
{11661}{11761}{Y:i}The phrase that summed up|Shackleton's own drive and resilience.
{11765}{11821}{Y:i}He was determined not to repeat|earlier mistakes...
{11825}{11922}{Y:i}...that had cost him the prize|of the South Pole.
{11968}{12017}{Y:i}Following the successful Norwegians...
{12022}{12121}{Y:i}...Shackleton brought along|69 Canadian sled dogs.
{12262}{12345}{Y:i}Food supplies would also be depoted|for the six-man sledging party...
{12350}{12467}{Y:i}...that would make the 1 500-mile journey|across the Antarctic continent.
{12518}{12583}{Y:i}Shackleton's own ship|would approach Antarctica...
{12587}{12694}{Y:i}...from the ice-strewn waters|of the little-known Weddell Sea.
{12739}{12807}{Y:i}The sea's gateway was the island|of South Georgia...
{12811}{12870}{Y:i}...the Endurance's last port of call.
{12874}{12942}{Y:i}An outpost of humanity|amidst the frozen wastes...
{12946}{13025}{Y:i}...the island was home|to small whaling communities...
{13029}{13096}{Y:i}...run by company men.
{13125}{13207}{Y:i}A local priest romantically|described these whalers...
{13211}{13294}{Y:i}...as a ''motley race of former noblemen|and other fallen creatures...
{13298}{13367}{Y:i}...who now strip blubber or render oil.
{13372}{13489}{Y:i}Many, if not most, are at odds with life. ''
{13511}{13641}{Y:i}Ernest Shackleton had something in|common with these loners and outsiders.
{13645}{13742}{Y:i}Born in Ireland, he had married the|daughter of a well-to-do English lawyer...
{13746}{13821}{Y:i}...but he was an indifferent|husband and father.
{13825}{13957}{Y:i}A restless soul, he had always been|happiest on his far-flung expeditions.
{13962}{14001}{Y:i}He once wrote to his wife:
{14006}{14115}{Y:i}''Sometimes I think I am no good|at anything but being away in the wilds. ''
{14119}{14275}Shackleton was not your 9-to-5 man,|your commuting type.
{14282}{14386}He wanted to be a great man. He was|searching for greatness, for reputation.
{14434}{14511}And in a sense, l think|he would have stuck at nothing...
{14515}{14605}...to achieve fame and fortune.
{14689}{14777}{Y:i}For all of November,|Shackleton and his crew waited...
{14781}{14877}{Y:i}...hoping that unusually icy conditions|in the Weddell Sea that austral spring...
{14882}{14935}{Y:i}...would improve.
{14956}{15042}{Y:i}Expedition photographer Frank Hurley|began his record...
{15046}{15162}{Y:i}...by capturing images of exotic wildlife|for an eager British audience.
{15166}{15211}{Y:i}The sale of film and photo rights...
{15215}{15302}{Y:i}...had been crucial|to financing the costly venture.
{15817}{15882}{Y:i}Perce Blackborow,|a young Welsh stowaway...
{15886}{15951}{Y:i}...sometimes served|as Hurley's assistant.
{15955}{16014}{Y:i}Blackborow had fallen in love|with the Endurance...
{16018}{16093}{Y:i}...when she had docked in Buenos Aires|on her way south.
{16097}{16171}{Y:i}Mrs. Chippy,|the carpenter's popular tomcat...
{16175}{16277}{Y:i}...also along for the ride, had fallen|overboard on the outward journey.
{16282}{16369}{Y:i}The ship had turned around|to pick him up.
{16386}{16489}{Y:i}The crew took advantage of their last|opportunity to send letters home.
{16494}{16567}{Y:i}Navigator Huberht Hudson|wrote his father:
{16571}{16661}''Dear old Dad,|just a line before we sail.
{16666}{16773}We've had a very good time so far,|and l think we shall do well.
{16777}{16906}l hope to be home again within 1 9 months|and go straight to the front.
{16910}{16997}What a glorious age we live in!''
{17049}{17121}{Y:i}By early December,|Shackleton could delay no longer...
{17125}{17196}{Y:i}...if he were to take advantage|of the Antarctic summer.
{17201}{17273}{Y:i}All his resources had been committed|to the expedition...
{17278}{17362}{Y:i}...and behind him, Europe was at war.
{17366}{17477}{Y:i}Twice before, he had seen|his dream snatched from him.
{17651}{17774}{Y:i}He was now 40 years old,|and this was his last chance.
{17793}{17949}{Y:i}On December 5, 1 9 1 4, the Endurance|left the island and headed south.
{19241}{19302}{Y:i}On the third day,|they encountered the enemy.
{19317}{19435}{Y:i}The huge, compacted chunks|of surface water known as ''pack ice. ''
{19502}{19550}{Y:i}The pack stretched to the horizon...
{19554}{19643}{Y:i}...broken only by gaps of open water|known as leads.
{19706}{19810}{Y:i}The challenge would be to navigate|the shifting, 1 000-mile tangle of leads...
{19814}{19881}{Y:i}...all the way to the continent.
{20326}{20430}{Y:i}Dr. Alexander Macklin, a Scottish|surgeon and one of the dog minders...
{20434}{20550}{Y:i}...recorded his observations of the ship's|high-spirited captain, Frank Worsley.
{20554}{20645}Worsley specialized in ramming,|and l have a sneaking suspicion...
{20649}{20734}...that he often went out of his way|to find a nice piece of floe...
{20738}{20834}...at which he could drive|at full speed and cut in two.
{20838}{20901}He loved to feel the shock,|the riding up...
{20906}{21007}...and the sensation as the ice gave|and we drove through it.
{21503}{21578}{Y:i}Some days,|the ship was held up by ice.
{21582}{21683}{Y:i}On others, she made long runs|in open water.
{21778}{21894}{Y:i}After six weeks of travel, the Endurance|was only 1 00 miles from the continent...
{21898}{22021}{Y:i}...when she entered a field of heavy|brash ice, slowing the ship to a crawl.
{22026}{22113}{Y:i}Capt. Worsley|recorded a fateful decision.
{22118}{22214}The character of the pack has again|changed. The floes are very thick.
{22218}{22314}We cannot push through except|with a very great expenditure of power.
{22318}{22370}We therefore prefer|to lie to for a while...
{22374}{22489}...to see if the pack opens at all|when this northeast wind clears.
{22582}{22669}{Y:i}When day broke, the men found the ice|had closed around the ship.
{22673}{22768}{Y:i}No water was visible in any direction.
{22773}{22883}{Y:i}As the days passed,|the ice showed no sign of relenting.
{22922}{23009}{Y:i}The event that sealed their fate|was recalled years later...
{23013}{23118}{Y:i}...in a radio interview by expedition|meteorologist Leonard Hussey.
{23122}{23217}On the 1 4 of February, 1 91 5,|the temperature suddenly dropped...
{23221}{23289}...from 20 degrees above zero|to 20 degrees below...
{23293}{23369}...and the whole sea froze over|and we froze in with it.
{23374}{23465}{Y:i}An unexpected lead opened up|400 yards ahead...
{23469}{23543}{Y:i}...offering a chance|to reach open water.
{23548}{23622}Of course we had no explosive|to blast our way out.
{23626}{23701}We just had picks and shovels.
{24165}{24277}{Y:i}For 48 hours,|the men attacked the ice.
{25797}{25880}{Y:i}Frank Hurley, who filmed the men's|exhausting bid for freedom...
{25885}{25918}{Y:i}...wrote in his diary:
{25922}{25970}All hands hard at it till midnight...
{25974}{26046}...when a survey is made|of the remaining two-thirds.
{26050}{26129}Itis reluctantly determined|to relinquish the task...
{26134}{26233}...as the remainder of the ice|is unworkable.
{26802}{26886}{Y:i}They were trapped until spring,|some seven months away.
{26890}{27016}{Y:i}Beyond even radio contact, no one|in the world knew where they were.
{27033}{27162}{Y:i}They had been thwarted only|one day's sail from their destination.
{27361}{27421}{Y:i}In his diary, Dr. Macklin wrote:
{27426}{27499}Itwas more than tantalizing.|Itwas maddening.
{27503}{27611}Shackleton, at this time, showed|one of his sparks of real greatness.
{27616}{27772}He did not rage at all, or show outwardly|the slightest sign of disappointment.
{27778}{27872}He told us simply and calmly|that we must winter in the pack.
{27877}{27993}Never lost his optimism|and prepared for the winter.
{28138}{28237}{Y:i}Optimism was at the very core|of Ernest Shackleton's personality.
{28242}{28321}{Y:i}Known to all as ''the Boss, ''|he was a born leader...
{28325}{28445}{Y:i}...who was, from his youth, driven|by a romantic quest for adventure.
{28449}{28518}{Y:i}At 1 6, he had shipped out|as a cabin boy.
{28522}{28633}{Y:i}By 2 4, he was certified as a master|in the merchant marine service.
{28638}{28701}{Y:i}Shortly after,|he was chosen as an officer...
{28706}{28807}{Y:i}...on Robert Falcon Scott's|historic first voyage.
{28822}{28926}{Y:i}There, he saw tensions flare among men|of different personalities and classes...
{28930}{28989}{Y:i}...thrown together in close quarters...
{28993}{29106}{Y:i}...and watched as morale eroded|under Scott's inadequate leadership.
{29110}{29200}{Y:i}Shackleton knew he could do better.
{29500}{29557}{Y:i}Now his own expedition|was in trouble...
{29562}{29661}{Y:i}...trapped in the pack ice,|drifting helplessly north.
{29752}{29825}{Y:i}The crew, restless.
{30155}{30253}{Y:i}Col. Thomas Orde-Lees,|the storekeeper and motor expert...
{30258}{30338}{Y:i}...irritated everyone|with his superior airs.
{30342}{30418}{Y:i}In a characteristic diary entry,|he observed:
{30422}{30515}l have made a point of sitting|at the same table as the 4th officer...
{30520}{30594}...and the carpenter,|who is a perfect pig in every way.
{30598}{30690}l've done this to try and accommodate|oneself to ideas and ways...
{30694}{30754}...less refined than one's own.
{30806}{30912}{Y:i}Others shared his distaste|for mingling with different classes.
{30917}{31041}{Y:i}McNish, the carpenter, had blunt words|of his own for the superior motor expert.
{31057}{31199}Orde-Lees is laid up with a sprained|back. He was shoveling snow yesterday.
{31204}{31285}The first work he has done|since we left London.
{31421}{31504}{Y:i}Shackleton insisted the men keep|to a strict daily routine...
{31509}{31595}{Y:i}...and carefully monitored their morale.
{31893}{31993}{Y:i}When dissension threatened, Shackleton|was prepared to act forcefully.
{31997}{32099}{Y:i}John Vincent, a heavyweight wrestling|champion caught bullying the sailors...
{32104}{32162}{Y:i}...was summoned to Shackleton's cabin.
{32166}{32234}{Y:i}He left demoted.
{32279}{32369}{Y:i}Everyone, including the Boss himself,|would work together.
{32373}{32429}{Y:i}Seaman Walter How remembered:
{32433}{32533}Everybody mucked in. Itdidn't matter|who they were or what they were.
{32538}{32620}Their qualifications|didn't count for anything.
{32625}{32735}{Y:i}Scientist James Wordie found himself|assigned to a cleaning brigade.
{32740}{32819}Everybody was prepared|to join in whatever was happening...
{32824}{32877}...whether it be scrubbing the floor....
{32881}{32969}And l think Shackleton himself,|with his lrish background...
{32973}{33091}...and ability to communicate and join in,|made everybody feel that they were one.
{33110}{33225}Itwas a team|and not a them-and-us situation.
{33635}{33683}He also communicated to his men...
{33688}{33778}...that he put them|above the object of the expedition.
{33782}{33853}The object was great,|but they were more important.
{33874}{33978}{Y:i}Second-in-command Frank Wild|had been with Shackleton in 1 909...
{33982}{34049}{Y:i}...when the Boss,|running out of supplies...
{34054}{34149}{Y:i}...gave up the pole in order|to save his party from certain death.
{34156}{34293}{Y:i}Wild had watched him turn back|just 97 miles short of the prize.
{34298}{34371}{Y:i}One night, with both men|close to starvation...
{34375}{34482}{Y:i}...Shackleton had forced upon Wild|a biscuit from his own meager rations.
{34486}{34517}{Y:i}Wild recorded:
{34521}{34598}l do not suppose that anyone else|can thoroughly realize...
{34602}{34674}...how much generosity|and sympathy was shown by this.
{34678}{34763}l do. By God,|l shall never forget it.
{34950}{35029}{Y:i}The floating landscape|convulsed into pressure ridges...
{35033}{35097}{Y:i}...became more difficult to negotiate.
{35101}{35208}{Y:i}Ice claimed their entire horizon.
{35342}{35450}{Y:i}As they drifted, Shackleton was mindful|of the fate of the ship Belgica.
{35454}{35526}{Y:i}She also had been frozen|for a winter on the pack...
{35530}{35660}{Y:i}...and her crew had succumbed|to infighting, and ultimately, insanity.
{36067}{36203}{Y:i}The men turned to the dogs, who quickly|became indispensable companions.
{36467}{36502}{Y:i}Hurley recorded:
{36506}{36557}A few words about my dogs.
{36562}{36645}Shakespeare, aliases Tatchco,|the Holy Hound, and Bug Whiskers...
{36650}{36737}...is a magnificent animal, somewhat|resembling an English sheepdog.
{36742}{36801}He is a noble creature,|dignified in gait...
{36805}{36916}...master of the team in battle|and a leader in canine sagacity.
{36938}{37025}A good leader will ferret out|the best track through broken country...
{37030}{37158}...will not allow fights in the team,|or indulge in capricious antics.
{37173}{37263}A team of nine dogs|can haul about 1 000 pounds.
{37267}{37336}My team is one of the best.
{38263}{38377}{Y:i}The birth of four puppies|captivated the entire company.
{38382}{38517}{Y:i}Tom Crean, tough sailor that he was,|became their adopted father.
{39297}{39390}{Y:i}The men passed the long months|with soccer matches.
{39443}{39493}{Y:i}With theatrical evenings....
{39634}{39690}{Y:i}With weekly gramophone concerts...
{39887}{39970}{Y:i}...and a memorable|haircutting tournament.
{39974}{40009}{Y:i}McNish recorded:
{40013}{40130}We do look a lot of convicts, and we are|not much short of that life at present...
{40134}{40226}...but still hoping to get|to civilization someday.
{40494}{40585}{Y:i}By May, they had been trapped|for over three months.
{40589}{40642}{Y:i}The sun disappeared|beneath the horizon...
{40646}{40763}{Y:i}...leaving days dark as night|until the end of winter.
{40830}{40882}{Y:i}The neat piles of sledging supplies...
{40886}{40997}{Y:i}...mocked Shackleton's ambition|and the dreams of his men.
{41105}{41181}{Y:i}Meanwhile, ominous forces were at work.
{41203}{41310}{Y:i}Ice, their old enemy,|menaced the helpless ship.
{41362}{41435}{Y:i}Under pressure|of the tightly congested pack...
{41440}{41570}{Y:i}...huge blocks of ice buckled|into ridges, threatening to crush her.
{41759}{41833}{Y:i}In July, a blizzard raked the Endurance.
{41837}{41947}{Y:i}As the ice groaned and heaved,|Shackleton paced his cabin.
{41951}{41998}{Y:i}Capt. Worsley recalled:
{42002}{42105}He said to me,|''The ship can't live in this, skipper.
{42110}{42254}lt's only a matter of time.|What the ice gets, the ice keeps.''
{42330}{42479}{Y:i}The Endurance survived, but as winter|turned to spring, assaults continued.
{42580}{42673}{Y:i}In an interview 40 years later,|sailor Walter How...
{42678}{42750}{Y:i}...still remembered the ship|staggering under the blows.
{42754}{42910}The ice got around to the starboard|quarter, and lifted her bodily as it were...
{42914}{42995}...and then she listed|very heavily to port...
{43000}{43066}...and the timbers began|to crack and groan.
{43070}{43133}Did you hear the timbers|going as the ice tided?
{43137}{43293}You couldn't avoid it. Itwas there like|heavy fireworks and blasting of guns.
{43566}{43669}{Y:i}Together, Shackleton and Wild|surveyed ice damage.
{43718}{43753}{Y:i}Orde-Lees recorded:
{43758}{43838}Sir Ernest must have gone through|terrible anxiety lately...
{43842}{43954}...though he is so inscrutable that no one|could have detected anything unusual.
{43958}{44045}l know for a fact that he did not once|lie down for three days...
{44050}{44143}...and l don't think he had undressed|for 1 0 days.
{44246}{44342}{Y:i}Tirelessly, the men worked|to cut the ice away from the ship.
{44346}{44445}{Y:i}Even the usually stoic McNish|was shaken. He wrote:
{44450}{44566}There were times when we thought it|was not possible the ship could stand it.
{44570}{44669}Everyone got our warm clothes put up|in as small a bundle as possible.
{44673}{44765}l have placed my loved one's photos|inside Bible.
{44791}{44865}{Y:i}In late October, the ice struck|with renewed force...
{44870}{44995}{Y:i}...opening planks of the starboard side.|Water flooded the hold.
{44999}{45141}{Y:i}All hands manned the pumps for three|days and nights to save the Endurance.
{45157}{45189}{Y:i}Hurley wrote:
{45193}{45237}The ship groans and quivers.
{45242}{45343}Windows splinter|while the deck timbers gape and twist.
{45347}{45415}Amid these profound|and overwhelming forces...
{45419}{45529}...we are the absolute embodiment|of helpless futility.
{45737}{45874}{Y:i}On October 2 7, 1 9 1 5, 1 0 months|after their entrapment in the ice...
{45878}{45973}{Y:i}...Shackleton gave the order|to abandon ship.
{45978}{46033}{Y:i}Seaman How recalled:
{46037}{46108}Shackleton sent Frank Wild|along forward...
{46113}{46243}...who explained to us|that it was a case of ''get out.''
{46529}{46641}Previously, Sir Ernest|had probably seen the red light...
{46645}{46773}...and sledges were packed|with as much stores as possible.
{47086}{47234}You've got to remember that a sailor|is a sailor and that's his ship, his home.
{47238}{47349}Once he's off that ship,|he's at a loss.
{47381}{47417}The adventurers of the expedition...
{47471}{47567}...the people that expected to stay,|and knew what they were up against...
{47572}{47685}...like Tom Crean, Worsley,|Shackleton himself, Wild...
{47702}{47775}...they adapted a little bit easier...
{47779}{47828}...but it was still tough.
{48033}{48126}{Y:i}They had been reduced to a fraction|of their original provisions...
{48130}{48225}{Y:i}...and to three of the ship's|four lifeboats.
{48485}{48569}{Y:i}It was minus 1 5 degrees Fahrenheit.
{48593}{48647}{Y:i}Tents and clothing had been salvaged...
{48652}{48737}{Y:i}...but there were not enough|fur sleeping bags to go around.
{48770}{48881}{Y:i}William Bakewell, an American sailor,|recalled the lottery Shackleton arranged.
{48902}{48957}There was crooked work|in the drawing...
{48961}{49043}...as Sir Ernest, Mr. Wild,|Capt. Worsley and other officers...
{49048}{49110}...all drew wool bags.
{49115}{49210}The fine warm fur bags|went to the men under them.
{49318}{49434}{Y:i}In the chill morning, Shackleton gathered|the company to explain his plan.
{49438}{49479}{Y:i}Dr. Macklin recorded:
{49483}{49573}As always with him,|what had happened had happened.
{49578}{49657}Without emotion, melodrama|or excitement he said:
{49661}{49778}''Ship and stores have gone,|so now we'll go home.''
{49942}{50081}{Y:i}This calm front belied the night|Shackleton passed, pacing the ice alone.
{50085}{50197}The thoughts that came to me|in the darkness were not cheerful.
{50202}{50289}The task now was to secure|the safety of the party...
{50293}{50361}...and to that l must apply|every bit of knowledge...
{50366}{50443}...that experience of the Antarctic|had given me.
{50454}{50525}There is nothing that can crush a man...
{50530}{50606}...as to see his dreams|crumble to the dust.
{50610}{50703}But on the other hand, he realized...
{50707}{50838}...if the one goal had disappeared,|we'll have another one.
{50842}{50972}And so, if l can't cross the continent,|l'm going to bring all my men back alive.
{50977}{51085}Because you mustn't forget|that polar exploration was littered...
{51103}{51161}...with dead bodies.
{51197}{51352}This almost fanatic-- Itwas a fanatic|desire to bring his men back alive.
{51357}{51502}This then became the driving force.|Itwas the only thing he cared about.
{51534}{51689}That change from aiming to attain|what you had set out...
{51703}{51817}...to extricating yourself from defeat...
{51822}{51957}...is a strain that has broken many a man.|Itdid not break Shackleton.
{52072}{52157}{Y:i}Shackleton's first impulse was|to march to the nearest land...
{52162}{52229}{Y:i}...some 350 miles to the west.
{52234}{52339}{Y:i}The men were allowed 2 pounds|of possessions, with few exceptions.
{52343}{52394}{Y:i}Hussey was allowed to keep his banjo...
{52398}{52475}{Y:i}...which Shackleton called|''vital mental medicine. ''
{52480}{52543}{Y:i}But there could be|no extra mouths to feed.
{52547}{52673}{Y:i}On Shackleton's orders, three puppies|and Mrs. Chippy...
{52678}{52725}{Y:i}...were shot.
{52762}{52849}l feel sure that it is the right thing|to attempt a march.
{52853}{52909}lf we can make 5|or 7 miles a day...
{52913}{53025}...our chance of reaching safety|will be greatly increased.
{53087}{53182}Itwill be better for the men|to feel they are on their way to land...
{53188}{53243}...than to sit down and wait.
{53346}{53485}{Y:i}But after three days of hard slogging,|they were still within sight of the ship.
{53490}{53569}{Y:i}The march to land had proved futile.
{53582}{53671}{Y:i}Now there was nothing to do|but watch and wait.
{54330}{54426}{Y:i}Food and supplies were salvaged|from the collapsing ship.
{54457}{54506}{Y:i}The men scoured her broken deck...
{54510}{54598}{Y:i}...retrieving what they could|and hauling it back to camp.
{54634}{54745}{Y:i}Frank Hurley conducted a salvage|operation to his submerged darkroom.
{54750}{54777}{Y:i}He wrote:
{54782}{54849}l hacked through|the thick walls of the refrigerator...
{54854}{54909}...to retrieve the negatives|stored therein.
{54914}{54989}They were located beneath 4 feet|of mushy ice...
{54993}{55117}...and by stripping to the waist|and diving under, l hauled them out.
{55492}{55573}{Y:i}Together he and Shackleton|selected 1 20 negatives...
{55578}{55643}{Y:i}...and sealed them in tin canisters.
{55648}{55723}{Y:i}The remaining 400,|Shackleton had Hurley destroy...
{55727}{55809}{Y:i}...so he would not be tempted|to recover them later.
{55826}{55957}{Y:i}Hurley retained a single vest-pocket|Kodak camera and three rolls of film.
{55993}{56113}{Y:i}On November 2 1, the broken ship|sank for good beneath the ice.
{56169}{56222}{Y:i}Shackleton recorded simply:
{56226}{56302}At 5 p.m. she went down.
{56317}{56382}l cannot write about it.
{56447}{56538}{Y:i}Now nothing remained|of the Endurance and her long battle...
{56542}{56611}{Y:i}...except Hurley's images.
{56855}{56981}Once the ship had gone,|my grandfather, l know...
{56986}{57107}...felt ill, not at ease on the ice.
{57112}{57201}Itwas a new thing.|l mean, he'd seen snow as a kid...
{57206}{57328}...but never set foot on an iceberg|like that. So it was a new...
{57335}{57397}...a new ballgame, so to speak.
{57421}{57519}ln their minds was,|like any human being, l think:
{57523}{57586}''Are we going to get out alive?''
{57726}{57839}{Y:i}The drift of the pack had carried the men|1 300 miles since they were trapped.
{57844}{57930}{Y:i}Now they hoped the same drift|would bring them to land.
{57934}{58033}{Y:i}If not, they were bound for open sea.
{58089}{58121}{Y:i}Hurley wrote:
{58125}{58234}Itis beyond conception even to us that|we are dwelling on a colossal ice-raft...
{58238}{58370}...with 5 feet of frozen water separating|us from 2000 fathoms of ocean.
{58374}{58526}And drifting along under the caprices of|wind and tides, to heaven knows where.
{58658}{58777}{Y:i}Timbers from the ship were used|to build a new home: Ocean Camp.
{58787}{58853}{Y:i}The wheelhouse became the new galley.
{58857}{58963}{Y:i}Hurley ingeniously converted part|of the ship's boiler into a stove...
{58967}{59061}{Y:i}...which was fuelled by penguin skin|and seal blubber.
{59121}{59169}{Y:i}A daily routine was established.
{59174}{59272}{Y:i}Hunting for penguins and seals|became the main activity.
{59669}{59749}{Y:i}Each man knew rescue was impossible.
{59761}{59877}{Y:i}They were managing to stay alive,|but to what end?
{59958}{60041}They had a pretty miserable time|on the ice.
{60061}{60156}But having said that, in the end...
{60163}{60221}...at every turn...
{60234}{60335}...Shackleton's enemy was not the ice...
{60340}{60462}...but it was his own people|in the sense it was their morale.
{60466}{60573}That was the foe. He had to prevent|their morale from crumbling.
{60578}{60654}The ice was nothing.|Anybody can deal with the ice...
{60658}{60754}...but to deal with the human spirit,|that is very difficult.
{61699}{61749}{Y:i}One month after abandoning ship...
{61754}{61853}{Y:i}...a bout of sciatica sent Shackleton|to his tent for two weeks.
{61858}{61910}{Y:i}Emerging after his forced confinement...
{61914}{62020}{Y:i}...he made the surprising decision|to attempt a second march to land.
{62035}{62101}{Y:i}In his memoir he related:
{62106}{62231}A buzz of pleasurable anticipation went|round the camp at this announcement.
{62236}{62303}{Y:i}Nothing was further from the truth.
{62632}{62728}{Y:i}The men dragged the loaded lifeboats|weighing more than a ton apiece...
{62733}{62843}{Y:i}...hacking their way through pressure|ridges that obstructed their passage.
{62913}{63013}{Y:i}At times they trudged|up to their knees in snow.
{63270}{63340}{Y:i}On the fourth day|McNish dug in his heels.
{63346}{63465}{Y:i}Earlier, he had proposed to build a sloop|from the wreckage of the Endurance.
{63470}{63532}{Y:i}Shackleton had rejected the plan.
{63537}{63649}{Y:i}Now McNish openly rebelled|and refused to continue.
{63653}{63777}{Y:i}His duty to obey orders, he asserted,|had ended with abandonment of the ship.
{63814}{63885}{Y:i}Chippy was a man who didn't like|to be told what to do.
{63890}{63973}You know what l mean?|lt's all on who you were.
{63978}{64057}lf Chippy didn't like it,|Chippy would tell you.
{64062}{64173}That's just the kind of man he was.|l mean, authority meant nothing to him.
{64223}{64306}{Y:i}Shackleton called the men together|and read ship's articles...
{64310}{64373}{Y:i}...dramatically asserting his command.
{64378}{64441}{Y:i}Despite the loss of the ship,|he announced...
{64445}{64529}{Y:i}...all men would be paid wages|until they reached port.
{64682}{64805}{Y:i}McNish backed down.|Mutiny was averted.
{64845}{64915}No leader on the edge|of survival can tolerate...
{64919}{65003}...the least threat to his authority.
{65008}{65150}And Shackleton, in fact, was prepared|to shoot the carpenter if necessary.
{65154}{65266}And he would have been justified|because there was a hidden danger here.
{65270}{65383}That the carpenter was only voicing...
{65387}{65467}...the opinions of two or three|other members of the crew...
{65471}{65511}...and more for all we know.
{65515}{65585}And had this not been|crushed immediately...
{65590}{65671}...the whole party|would have disintegrated.
{65711}{65769}{Y:i}Two days after the standoff|with McNish...
{65773}{65853}{Y:i}...Shackleton was forced|to realize his own error.
{65858}{65929}{Y:i}He called a halt to the march.
{65956}{66010}{Y:i}In his diary Shackleton wrote:
{66014}{66093}Turned in but could not sleep.|Am anxious.
{66097}{66165}Everyone working well|except the carpenter:
{66170}{66281}l shall never forget him|in this time of strain and stress.
{66451}{66505}{Y:i}Shackleton had put down the rebellion...
{66510}{66621}{Y:i}...but he could not quell all doubts|that threatened to erode his authority.
{66642}{66746}{Y:i}A week of backbreaking effort|had left his men worse off than before.
{66750}{66827}{Y:i}Precious equipment had been left behind.
{66832}{66949}{Y:i}Life at their new base, Patience Camp,|would be much harder.
{67033}{67103}{Y:i}More questions arose|about the Boss's judgment.
{67108}{67175}{Y:i}Food was running out,|but Shackleton had imposed...
{67181}{67286}{Y:i}...strict limitations on the amount|of penguin and seal meat stockpiled...
{67291}{67369}{Y:i}...insisting he would get them|off the ice before winter.
{67434}{67565}{Y:i}Lionel Greenstreet, the first officer,|openly questioned the Boss' philosophy:
{67569}{67695}His sublime optimism all the way through|is, to my mind, absolute foolishness.
{67699}{67805}Everything was going to turn out all right|and no notice was taken of things...
{67809}{67916}...possibly turning out otherwise.|And here we are.
{67930}{67965}{Y:i}Shackleton retorted:
{67969}{68032}You're a bloody pessimist.
{68050}{68129}{Y:i}For once, Orde-Lees voiced|the fears of many.
{68133}{68190}{Y:i}They had to have meat,|he put on record...
{68194}{68265}{Y:i}...in the event of another winter|on the floes.
{68285}{68394}Itwas important to have,|just like ammunition, to have supplies.
{68398}{68478}And the famous thing,|the statement of Wellington, wasn't it?
{68482}{68627}That ''the army marches on its stomach''?|That seemed to him to be elementary.
{68845}{68938}{Y:i}In the end, it was the Boss's vision|that prevailed.
{68946}{69093}Shackleton's great characteristic|was the ability to compel loyalty...
{69098}{69253}...even against his men's|better judgment.
{69282}{69373}Now this has got to do...
{69378}{69499}...with some force of character,|some flame that burns within a man.
{69586}{69700}{Y:i}Game grew scarcer.|There was no food for the dogs.
{69724}{69779}{Y:i}Shackleton gave Wild|the unhappy command...
{69784}{69844}{Y:i}...to shoot some of the dog teams.
{69871}{69951}{Y:i}Hurley paid a last tribute|to his old companion.
{69955}{70053}Hail to the thee, old leader Shakespeare.|l shall ever remember thee:
{70058}{70141}Fearless, faithful and diligent.
{70293}{70424}{Y:i}Within weeks, the remaining teams|were shot, and this time eaten.
{70429}{70467}{Y:i}McNish wrote:
{70471}{70542}Frank Wild shot the last|of our faithful dogs...
{70546}{70613}...of which we kept|the five young ones for food.
{70617}{70712}And their flesh tastes a treat|after living so long on seal meat...
{70718}{70817}...and this last 1 4 days|on almost nothing.
{71069}{71122}{Y:i}As the men drifted|to the edge of the pack...
{71126}{71195}{Y:i}...the ice began to disintegrate|around them.
{71200}{71272}{Y:i}One day Orde-Lees|awoke feeling seasick.
{71277}{71389}{Y:i}The ice had become so thin that the swell|of the ocean could be felt through it.
{71394}{71478}{Y:i}Soon, nothing would be left|beneath them.
{71814}{71942}Finally, Shackleton felt|that they had to get onto their boats...
{71946}{72064}...and make for an island|to escape from the ice.
{72077}{72153}The problem then was, where were|they going to go?
{72158}{72273}And there's an intriguing collection|of island silhouettes...
{72305}{72399}...which Worsley took with him so that|when they saw a little land...
{72403}{72453}...they knew where they were.
{72458}{72527}Otherwise how did they know|what they would see?
{72532}{72647}Their navigation, however brilliantly|it was done, was primitive.
{72655}{72763}And they embarked on this|boat journey from the ice...
{72813}{72884}...not knowing where|they were going to end up.
{72907}{72961}{Y:i}Several landfalls were possible.
{72966}{73098}{Y:i}The closest were Clarence and Elephant|Islands, some 1 00 miles to the north.
{73118}{73193}{Y:i}Deception Island,|over 1 50 miles to the west...
{73198}{73291}{Y:i}...was known to have supplies|for shipwrecked mariners.
{73314}{73389}{Y:i}Shackleton chose Deception Island.
{73477}{73545}{Y:i}Their three small lifeboats|would carry all 28 men...
{73549}{73641}{Y:i}...on a journey that would last|no one knew how long.
{73758}{73862}{Y:i}Sailor William Bakewell|recalled the landmark day of departure:
{73889}{73930}Our first day in the water...
{73936}{74025}...was one of the coldest|and most dangerous of the expedition.
{74035}{74072}The ice was running riot.
{74077}{74153}Itwas a hard race|to keep our boats in the open leads.
{74158}{74221}We had many narrow escapes|from being crushed...
{74225}{74306}...when the larger masses|of the pack would come together.
{74422}{74476}{Y:i}During the first few days|of their journey...
{74481}{74571}{Y:i}...they pulled their boats|from the water each evening to sleep.
{74575}{74650}{Y:i}Without the movie camera|and with little film to spare...
{74654}{74711}{Y:i}...it would be left to artist|George Marston...
{74716}{74814}{Y:i}...to record their tenuous camps|on the drifting ice.
{74915}{75034}{Y:i}Leonard Hussey and Walter How|recalled the night when disaster struck:
{75038}{75178}We were drifting over the sea on a piece|of ice and we were cold and frozen.
{75190}{75241}Pitch dark night once...
{75246}{75327}...and the ice split right across|under the men's tent.
{75331}{75393}There were eight of us turned in there.
{75398}{75471}One poor chap, name of Holness...
{75475}{75562}...him and his sleeping bag|dropped into the drink.
{75566}{75613}Shackleton looked into the crack...
{75618}{75698}...and he saw a man|floating in his sleeping bag.
{75721}{75833}{Y:i}Shackleton grabbed Holness and|lifted him in his bag up onto the ice...
{75837}{75937}{Y:i}...knowing he could survive|only minutes in the freezing water.
{75974}{76097}{Y:i}Seconds later the ice-edges|came together with tremendous force.
{76163}{76253}l remember Shackleton saying|to Holness, ''Are you all right?''
{76258}{76309}''Yes, sir,'' he said, ''l'm quite all right.
{76314}{76444}Only thing l regret, my bloody tobacco's|down there in the drink.''
{76690}{76730}{Y:i}Shackleton recorded:
{76734}{76863}Constant rain and snow squalls blotted|out the stars and soaked us through.
{76867}{77012}Occasionally the shadows of silver,|snow and fulmar petrels flashed close.
{77017}{77091}And all around we could hear|the killers blowing...
{77095}{77207}...their short, sharp hisses sounding|like sudden escapes of steam.
{77438}{77441}The sheer hardship of the rowing.
{77441}{77545}The sheer hardship of the rowing.
{77598}{77681}My father said that|at the end of a watch...
{77686}{77763}...your hands had to be|chipped off the oars.
{77767}{77852}And it's very hard to imagine|what it must be like...
{77862}{77982}...when you try to get some sleep.|Your hands must be totally frozen.
{77986}{78072}Your clothes are probably soaked|and you're hungry.
{78091}{78181}{Y:i}The days passed|in painful rowing and bailing.
{78209}{78258}{Y:i}Stable ice could not be found...
{78262}{78353}{Y:i}...and nights were now spent|sitting helpless in the black sea.
{78357}{78387}{Y:i}To complete their misery...
{78391}{78477}{Y:i}...many of the men|were now suffering from dysentery.
{78503}{78609}l think they only had one hot drink a day.
{78613}{78768}And he said that they|only ate a ship's biscuit...
{78789}{78841}...which in his own phrase:
{78846}{78969}''You look at it for breakfast, you suck it|for lunch and you eat it for dinner.''
{79046}{79139}What kept them from cracking...
{79144}{79223}...was Shackleton's sheer willpower,|his leadership.
{79228}{79288}This flame that burns within him.
{79293}{79375}And this was manifested|in different ways.
{79379}{79469}Either it was Shackleton playing...
{79474}{79549}...the consummate mariner|at the prow of the boat...
{79554}{79691}...leading his little squadron to safety,|or it was mothering his men.
{79696}{79799}Suddenly turning around and comforting|somebody or preparing food for him.
{79804}{79877}And acting, basically,|like a hen with one chicken.
{79882}{79987}And the next minute he was a martinet,|driving his men on.
{80126}{80176}lt's hard to imagine...
{80181}{80329}...and yet they probably were seeing|things of great beauty on that journey.
{80645}{80704}We were all laced together,|the three boats...
{80709}{80821}...on account of the bad weather,|and during the night several whale...
{80826}{80914}...l don't know what species,|were blowing around us.
{80918}{80995}And had they gone|over one of our tow ropes...
{80999}{81074}...the three boats would have|certainly disappeared.
{81078}{81145}And also us.
{81208}{81330}{Y:i}For days and nights with no sleep,|the helmsmen manned the tillers.
{81334}{81429}{Y:i}When Worsley was relieved of his shift,|he had to be lain in the boat...
{81434}{81545}{Y:i}...and opened slowly from his|crouching position like a jackknife.
{81677}{81793}{Y:i}Overwhelmed by misery and fear,|some of the men broke down and wept.
{81797}{81897}{Y:i}Now Shackleton knew|he must make for land at any cost.
{81902}{82010}{Y:i}Changing course,|they struck out for Elephant Island.
{82098}{82194}{Y:i}On the evening of the sixth day,|the skies to the northwest darkened...
{82198}{82253}{Y:i}...and a gale swept down.
{82309}{82420}{Y:i}Swamped with water, one of the|lifeboats was in danger of sinking.
{82474}{82553}{Y:i}Orde-Lees, who up until then|had disdained to row...
{82557}{82661}{Y:i}...rose to the crisis|and bailed for his companions' lives.
{82681}{82797}My grandfather was always a man|who wanted to do a feat.
{82801}{82899}Rowing, there's no|possibility of doing a feat.
{82903}{82977}l mean, everybody's|on the same oar rowing, like that.
{82982}{83085}Bailing out? Saving everybody's life?|Gosh, l mean, that's sort of...
{83089}{83173}...a part made in heaven|for my grandfather...
{83178}{83270}...because everybody would be aware|he'd been up all night bailing them out.
{83275}{83345}So gentlemen don't row...
{83349}{83444}...but by Jove, they'd do anything|necessary to save people's lives.
{83656}{83716}{Y:i}When dawn broke, Shackleton recorded:
{83721}{83773}The weather was very thick|in the morning.
{83777}{83845}lndeed, at 7 a.m.|we were under the cliffs...
{83849}{83933}...which plunged sheer to the sea|before we saw them.
{83975}{84034}{Y:i}Elephant Island.
{84050}{84114}{Y:i}The men had been|seven bleak days at sea...
{84118}{84194}{Y:i}...and over five months on drifting ice.
{84198}{84306}{Y:i}It was a year and four months|since they had touched land.
{84657}{84761}{Y:i}With frostbitten fingers,|Hurley recorded the landing.
{85216}{85266}{Y:i}In his diary, Hurley wrote:
{85270}{85393}Many of the party were emaciated|by exhaustion, fatigue and exposure.
{85397}{85538}Many suffered from temporary|aberration, or shivering as with palsy.
{85542}{85617}{Y:i}The men reeled|along the beach as if drunk...
{85622}{85706}{Y:i}...some burying their faces in the stones.
{85746}{85818}{Y:i}Wordie recalled more chilling behavior.
{85822}{85883}Some fellows were half-crazy.
{85888}{86023}One got an axe and did not stop|until he had killed about 1 0 seals.
{86332}{86389}{Y:i}Shackleton ordered food prepared.
{86407}{86492}{Y:i}It was the first hot meal in three days.
{86793}{86861}{Y:i}Hurley described the first night.
{86866}{86929}Tents were hastily erected,|all turned in...
{86933}{87022}...and almost instantly|were deep in slumber.
{87038}{87095}How delicious to wake in one's sleep...
{87100}{87209}...and listen to the croaks of penguins|mingling with the sea.
{87254}{87343}To fall asleep and awaken again,|and feel this is real.
{87347}{87410}We have reached land.
{87470}{87626}{Y:i}Land, such as it was, was a low sliver|of beach that offered no shelter.
{87657}{87716}{Y:i}Two days later, Shackleton led the men...
{87721}{87804}{Y:i}...to a second location|on the western side of the island.
{87818}{87923}{Y:i}The new campsite was called|Cape Wild, after Frank Wild.
{87928}{88027}{Y:i}To the sailors it was Cape Bloody Wild.
{88082}{88150}{Y:i}The boats landed in sleet and rain.
{88154}{88238}{Y:i}By night a gale blew up,|ripping one of the tents to shreds...
{88242}{88312}{Y:i}...and blowing equipment out to sea.
{88322}{88427}{Y:i}Men crawled under the boats for shelter,|and lay shivering in their tunics...
{88433}{88499}{Y:i}...as the wind heaped snow upon them.
{88504}{88589}{Y:i}The blizzard raged for five days.
{88749}{88851}l think l spent, this morning,|the most unhappy hour of my life.
{88855}{88903}All attempts seemed so hopeless...
{88907}{88994}...and fate seemed absolutely|determined to thwart us.
{88998}{89106}Men sat and cursed, not loudly,|but with an intensity that showed...
{89110}{89212}...their hatred of this island|on which we had sought shelter.
{89525}{89637}Shackleton had saved his men|in the sense he'd got them all alive...
{89641}{89778}...out of the ice and on to terra firma.|But now how to get back to civilization?
{89782}{89886}Elephant lsland was off...
{89890}{90038}...any conceivable shipping route.|Not only that, she was nowhere near...
{90042}{90145}...the routes of the whalers and sealers|that used to come down there.
{90149}{90277}So somehow Shackleton|had to get his men...
{90282}{90412}...to a port of call, even if it was only|a lonely island where the sealers came.
{90485}{90619}{Y:i}Staring down impossible odds,|Shackleton made a bold decision.
{90640}{90746}{Y:i}He would not wait,|he would sail for rescue.
{90782}{90845}{Y:i}Cape Horn, the closest land,|was beyond reach...
{90849}{90923}{Y:i}...as it would mean sailing against|the prevailing wind.
{90928}{91015}{Y:i}In the path of the westerlies|was the island they'd set out from:
{91021}{91063}{Y:i}South Georgia.
{91074}{91134}{Y:i}The plan was made.
{91138}{91221}{Y:i}Shackleton would take|a 22-and-a-half-foot-long boat...
{91225}{91331}{Y:i}...800 miles across|the world's most dangerous ocean.
{91418}{91478}{Y:i}Work began immediately|on the James Caird.
{91482}{91579}{Y:i}Earlier, McNish had raised her gunnels|with wood from packing cases.
{91583}{91673}{Y:i}Now he scavenged the other|two boats to reinforce her.
{91677}{91774}{Y:i}The seams were sealed with|Marston's oil paints and seal's blood.
{91778}{91845}{Y:i}Her deck was canvassed.
{91865}{91985}Itwasn't only that McNish was a good|shipwright, a good ship's carpenter...
{91989}{92098}...but he appeared to have|something extra.
{92102}{92258}He had a streak of ingenuity...
{92277}{92395}...of the real ability to improvise...
{92399}{92466}...to make something out of nothing.
{92470}{92624}And l think this is connected with|a strain of perversity, of cussedness.
{92629}{92784}And here's another paradox:|This was the mutineer who'd come good.
{92849}{92954}{Y:i}Shackleton chose the strongest and|most seasoned sailors for the journey.
{92958}{93077}{Y:i}With the greatest pride, McNish recorded|his own inclusion in the 6-man crew.
{93081}{93157}{Y:i}He would be joined|by Tom Crean and Tim McCarthy...
{93162}{93263}{Y:i}...both Irish sailors and stalwarts|of the voyage to Elephant Island.
{93268}{93349}{Y:i}The demoted boatswain John Vincent|was also redeemed.
{93353}{93417}{Y:i}Shackleton recognized|his strength and skill...
{93421}{93547}{Y:i}...the result of years on trawlers in the|brutal conditions of the North Atlantic.
{93609}{93694}{Y:i}Captain Frank Worsley had navigated|the boats to Elephant Island.
{93698}{93805}{Y:i}Now he would have to find a tiny speck|of land in a limitless ocean.
{93810}{93894}{Y:i}Pacing the shore, he checked|and rechecked the chronometer...
{93898}{93957}{Y:i}...that would be critical to his navigation.
{93988}{94108}{Y:i}Frank Wild, Shackleton's right-hand,|would be in charge of those left behind.
{94113}{94178}{Y:i}As the expedition was split|for the first time...
{94182}{94253}{Y:i}... Wild's unenviable commission|was the care of 2 1...
{94257}{94412}{Y:i}...demoralized, partially incapacitated|men on a deserted, wind-raked island.
{95070}{95216}{Y:i}On April 22, 1 9 1 6, McNish finished|his work and the weather cleared.
{95734}{95825}{Y:i}Moored offshore, the Caird was loaded|with 2 tons of stone ballast...
{95829}{95885}{Y:i}...for stability in the towering waves.
{96022}{96155}{Y:i}Water from ice laboriously melted|over a blubber flame was stored in kegs.
{96209}{96259}{Y:i}They took food for four weeks.
{96263}{96353}{Y:i}Beyond this they knew|they could not survive.
{96445}{96534}{Y:i}Standing on the beach, Hurley|captured the moment of departure...
{96538}{96640}{Y:i}...as the men left behind|bravely cheered the Caird on her way.
{96761}{96817}{Y:i}On board the Caird, Worsley reflected:
{96832}{96889}The men ashore formed|a pathetic group.
{96893}{96955}As long as they thought|we could see them...
{96961}{97061}...they kept up a wonderful appearance|of optimism and heartiness.
{97293}{97352}{Y:i}Elephant Island receded|into the distance...
{97357}{97451}{Y:i}...as the Caird departed on a day|of rare sunshine and calm seas.
{97765}{97834}{Y:i}Soon the Caird was in rougher waters.
{97881}{97945}{Y:i}By the second day, the weather|had grown severe...
{97949}{98014}{Y:i}...and water began pouring|into the little boat.
{98173}{98222}{Y:i}Frank Worsley recalled:
{98226}{98300}Bruised and soaked with never|a long enough interval...
{98305}{98369}...for our bodies to warm|our steaming clothes...
{98373}{98455}...our feet and legs had swelled and|began to be frostbitten...
{98461}{98550}...with the temperature|at times nearly down to zero.
{98590}{98658}{Y:i}McNish alone attempted|to keep a sea log...
{98662}{98736}{Y:i}...but on the ninth day,|he abruptly broke it off.
{98776}{98843}{Y:i}They worked round the clock|in four-hour shifts...
{98848}{98935}{Y:i}...three men vainly attempting to sleep|on the rocky ballast below...
{98939}{99015}{Y:i}...while three others held watch above,|bailing, pumping...
{99019}{99104}{Y:i}...trimming the sails,|fighting to keep the Caird afloat.
{99401}{99461}They were in a 22-foot-6|little rowing boat.
{99465}{99556}And it is absolutely staggering,|the height of the waves.
{99570}{99619}There were some incredible waves...
{99664}{99736}...which might nowadays|be called non-negotiable waves...
{99741}{99788}...where you'd head up to the top...
{99793}{99862}...and not get over the top|and you'd slide back down.
{99866}{99952}So it was an extraordinary|journey of survival.
{100142}{100223}{Y:i}In the end,|everything depended on Worsley.
{100228}{100313}{Y:i}He had learned to navigate|in the high surf of the South Pacific...
{100317}{100394}{Y:i}...but nothing could compare|to his present challenge.
{100398}{100441}{Y:i}To chart the Caird's position...
{100445}{100527}{Y:i}... Worsley needed to read|the sun's relation to the horizon.
{100531}{100602}{Y:i}But the sun rarely appeared|in the overcast sky...
{100606}{100704}{Y:i}...and the horizon became almost|impossible to find behind the waves.
{100709}{100813}{Y:i}Even to attempt a sextant reading, he had|to be braced by men on either side...
{100817}{100895}{Y:i}...as the boat heaved and pitched|her way through the water.
{100961}{101061}You mustn't forget,|every degree mistake you make...
{101065}{101141}...is 60 miles of latitude.
{101145}{101245}And they only had|about 1 0 miles leeway...
{101249}{101334}...in 800 miles in order to reach safety.
{101380}{101437}{Y:i}In 800 miles of stormy travel...
{101441}{101513}{Y:i}... Worsley was able to take|only four sightings.
{101551}{101634}{Y:i}The remainder of the journey|he navigated by dead reckoning...
{101638}{101727}{Y:i}...the experienced sailor's instinctive|gauging of speed and direction...
{101731}{101792}{Y:i}...or ''merry guesswork, ''|as he called it.
{101909}{102021}{Y:i}On the 1 0th day, Worsley believed|that they were a little over halfway.
{102073}{102109}{Y:i}He recalled:
{102124}{102193}Two of the party|were very close to death.
{102197}{102269}Shackleton kept a finger|on each man's pulse.
{102273}{102358}Whenever he noticed that a man|seemed extra cold and shivered...
{102362}{102472}...he would immediately order another hot|drink to be prepared and served to all.
{102477}{102571}He never let the man know|that it was on his account.
{102645}{102746}{Y:i}Vincent's upper lip was torn away|by a frozen metal cup.
{102793}{102854}Oh, God, it must have been desperate.
{102858}{102926}That's all--|Itmust have been desperate.
{102969}{103099}My father's ears,|his two ears, suffered frostbite.
{103103}{103173}They were like bones.
{103242}{103318}{Y:i}On the evening of May 7,|the 1 4th day at sea...
{103322}{103384}{Y:i}...a piece of kelp floated by.
{103405}{103453}{Y:i}Land was near.
{103463}{103511}{Y:i}Worsley recalled this moment:
{103516}{103602}We looked at each other|with cheerful, foolish grins.
{103606}{103689}The thoughts uppermost were,|''We've done it!''
{103845}{103950}{Y:i}With land in sight,|new ordeals arose to test their limits.
{103960}{104053}{Y:i}A wind drove them perilously close|to the island's cliffs.
{104057}{104123}{Y:i}Soon this wind increased|into hurricane force...
{104128}{104193}{Y:i}...descending upon them from|the darkening skies.
{104221}{104278}This is where Worsley|came into his own...
{104282}{104361}...because he understood the way|a sailing ship worked...
{104365}{104507}...and so he performed a miracle|with a round-bottomed whaler...
{104542}{104663}...whose profession was making leeway,|not built for sailing into the wind.
{104668}{104800}Somehow he clawed his way offshore|and into the wind.
{104833}{104906}{Y:i}The hurricane raged for nine hours.
{104953}{105047}{Y:i}Then the wind veered,|carrying them from destruction.
{105133}{105181}{Y:i}Shackleton recorded:
{105185}{105293}We stood offshore,|tired almost to the point of apathy.
{105378}{105457}{Y:i}On the evening of May 1 0,|the 1 7 th day at sea...
{105461}{105546}{Y:i}...the James Caird sailed into the|entrance of King Haakon Bay...
{105550}{105594}{Y:i}...on South Georgia.
{105669}{105788}{Y:i}In the gathering darkness, the boat ran|in on a swell and touched the beach.
{105793}{105907}{Y:i}A small stream flowed nearby and|the men fell to their knees and drank.
{105918}{106029}{Y:i}One of the greatest boat journeys|in modern maritime history had ended.
{106441}{106517}{Y:i}Above them, the hill was green|with tussock grass...
{106521}{106613}{Y:i}...the first vegetation they had seen|in 1 7 months.
{106689}{106731}{Y:i}McNish recalled:
{106735}{106825}l went on top of the hill|and had a lay on the grass...
{106829}{106893}...and it put me in mind|of old times at home...
{106897}{106985}...sitting on the hillside|looking down at the sea.
{107158}{107257}{Y:i}Suddenly home, rescue,|seemed possible.
{107266}{107307}{Y:i}There was only one catch.
{107311}{107411}{Y:i}The whaling stations lay|on the opposite side of the island.
{107479}{107564}{Y:i}Neither crew nor boat|were fit for another sea journey.
{107578}{107656}{Y:i}The island would have to be|crossed on foot.
{107750}{107838}Itwas a terrible setback.
{107877}{107995}l think that most men...
{107999}{108091}...under those circumstances,|without Shackleton's leadership...
{108095}{108242}...they might've collapsed morally there|and therefore not survived.
{108281}{108350}He took it all in a very matter-of-fact way.
{108362}{108458}He gave the impression that everything|would be all right in the end.
{108485}{108559}{Y:i}Their single map showed|only the island's coastline.
{108563}{108614}{Y:i}The interior was unknown.
{108619}{108719}{Y:i}Icy and forbidding, prey to sudden|blizzards and hurricane-force winds...
{108724}{108796}{Y:i}...the whalers considered it impenetrable.
{108873}{108973}{Y:i}This chaos of peaks and glaciers|had never been crossed.
{109113}{109172}{Y:i}They had just survived 1 7 days at sea...
{109177}{109248}{Y:i}...and their feet|were still numb from frostbite.
{109253}{109351}{Y:i}But if rescue were to be made,|they had to reach the other side.
{109469}{109547}{Y:i}Shackleton decided to take with him|Crean and Worsley...
{109552}{109639}{Y:i}...leaving behind the other men|who were not fit for the journey.
{109778}{109891}{Y:i}Using screws from the Caird,|McNish improvised climbing boots.
{109898}{109994}{Y:i}The frost of night would harden the snow,|making it easier to cross.
{109998}{110091}{Y:i}But there could be no stopping,|or they would succumb to the cold.
{110095}{110170}{Y:i}They were in a race|for their companions' lives.
{110417}{110483}{Y:i}Too weak to carry anything|but bare necessities...
{110488}{110545}{Y:i}...the three men took a length of rope...
{110549}{110623}{Y:i}...and a carpenter's adz|as their only equipment.
{110690}{110693}{Y:i}Taking advantage of the full moon|and calm weather...
{110693}{110758}{Y:i}Taking advantage of the full moon|and calm weather...
{110764}{110837}{Y:i}...they set out at 3 a.m.|for Stromness Whaling Station.
{110862}{110982}{Y:i}Beneath the deceptive blanketing of snow|lay ice fields pitted with crevasses.
{110998}{111057}{Y:i}One misstep could end in death.
{111115}{111147}{Y:i}As the day grew longer...
{111151}{111254}{Y:i}...they struggled through a bewildering|confusion of ridges and plateaus.
{111383}{111445}{Y:i}Time after time|they would ascend a summit...
{111449}{111521}{Y:i}...only to find a precipice|on the other side.
{111794}{111826}{Y:i}Shackleton recalled:
{111830}{111918}We were now feeling the strain|of the unaccustomed marching.
{111922}{112031}We had done little walking since January|and our muscles were out of tune.
{112170}{112254}{Y:i}By evening, they were again|high on a treacherous pass...
{112258}{112315}{Y:i}...too steep to climb down.
{112673}{112790}Itwas of the utmost importance for us to|get down into the next valley before dark.
{112794}{112870}The night temperature|at that elevation would be very low.
{112874}{112927}We had no sleeping bags.
{113034}{113075}{Y:i}Worsley recorded:
{113081}{113161}Shackleton said,|''We've got to take a risk.
{113165}{113249}Are you game? We'll slide.''
{113261}{113333}{Y:i}Coiling their rope into a pad,|they sat down...
{113337}{113462}{Y:i}...then pushed off, not knowing what|rocks or razor-sharp ice lay in their path.
{113503}{113550}We seemed to shoot into space.
{113567}{113659}Quite suddenly l felt a glow|and knew that l was grinning.
{113765}{113845}We finished up at the bottom|in a bank of snow.
{113885}{113990}We picked ourselves up|and solemnly shook hands all round.
{114273}{114348}{Y:i}All night into early morning,|they marched on.
{114374}{114400}{Y:i}Wrote Shackleton:
{114405}{114497}At 5 a.m., we were at the foot|of the rocky spurs of the range.
{114501}{114601}We were tired and wind that blew down|from the heights was chilling us.
{114605}{114695}l thought we might be able|to keep warm and have a rest.
{114721}{114801}Within minutes,|my two companions were asleep.
{115459}{115555}l realized it would be disastrous|if we all slumbered together...
{115559}{115669}...for sleep under such conditions|merges into death.
{115705}{115779}After five minutes l shook them|into consciousness again...
{115783}{115845}...told them that they'd slept|for half an hour...
{115849}{115902}...and gave the word for a fresh start.
{116239}{116300}{Y:i}By 6:30 a.m., they had climbed a ridge...
{116305}{116395}{Y:i}...that looked down upon a site familiar|from a year and a half earlier:
{116399}{116441}{Y:i}Fortuna Bay.
{116445}{116515}{Y:i}Stromness was around the corner.
{116593}{116654}{Y:i}At 3 in the afternoon on May 20...
{116658}{116779}{Y:i}...Shackleton, Worsley and Crean|stumbled into Stromness Station.
{116803}{116876}{Y:i}They had been marching for 36 hours.
{117208}{117277}{Y:i}At the home of Thoralf Sørlle,|the station manager...
{117281}{117331}{Y:i}...they knocked on the door.
{117415}{117502}{Y:i}''Who the hell are you?''|Sørlle reportedly asked.
{117534}{117605}{Y:i}''My name is Shackleton, ''|came the answer.
{117637}{117789}The whaling manager couldn't recognize|them because they were dirty, emaciated.
{117801}{117956}They were soot-grimed because of living|over blubber stoves for so long.
{117965}{118036}Their clothes were filthy.|Their hair was uncut.
{118069}{118165}They were like men|returning from the dead.
{118384}{118444}{Y:i}That night the weather turned.
{118449}{118502}{Y:i}Lying in bed in the manager's house...
{118506}{118594}{Y:i}...Shackleton listened|to snow drive against the window.
{118665}{118764}{Y:i}Had they been caught in a blizzard,|nothing could have saved them.
{118871}{118953}{Y:i}Years later, Shackleton|would give a mystical account...
{118957}{119013}{Y:i}...of the crossing of South Georgia.
{119022}{119114}l know that during that long|and racking march of 36 hours...
{119118}{119202}...over the unnamed mountains|and glaciers of South Georgia...
{119206}{119307}...it seemed to me often|that we were four, not three.
{119311}{119413}l said nothing to my companions,|but afterwards Worsley said to me:
{119417}{119543}''Boss, l had a curious feeling|that there was another person with us.''
{119651}{119709}The fourth man,|l suppose, was the man above.
{119713}{119819}They must have been deeply religious|at the back of everything.
{119824}{119860}They must.
{120005}{120062}{Y:i}Three days after arriving in Stromness...
{120066}{120181}{Y:i}...Shackleton, Worsley and Crean set out|for Elephant Island in a borrowed ship.
{120185}{120292}{Y:i}Their three companions back at King|Haakon Bay were given passages home.
{120341}{120387}{Y:i}60 miles short of the island...
{120391}{120470}{Y:i}...the rescue ship was brought|to a halt by their old enemy:
{120474}{120509}{Y:i}Ice.
{120544}{120605}{Y:i}There was nothing to do but return.
{120640}{120735}{Y:i}Over the next four months, Shackleton|made increasingly frantic attempts...
{120739}{120805}{Y:i}...to get through to his men|on Elephant Island.
{120820}{120865}{Y:i}At last, in late August...
{120869}{120955}{Y:i}...the Chilean government loaned him|a small tug called the Yelcho...
{120959}{121069}{Y:i}...and Shackleton, Worsley and Crean|set out on their fourth rescue attempt.
{121174}{121213}{Y:i}Elephant Island.
{121228}{121318}{Y:i}The rescue party was now|at least 1 0 weeks overdue.
{121357}{121410}{Y:i}In his diary, Orde-Lees wrote:
{121414}{121483}August 26, 1 91 6.
{121487}{121577}Another wretched day,|very dull and draining.
{121597}{121663}What little seal meat|we have left is tainted.
{121667}{121715}We've picked it over so often...
{121720}{121801}...that nothing but|the most decomposed remains.
{121852}{121912}{Y:i}The 22 men had passed|a sunless winter...
{121917}{121997}{Y:i}...living in a small hut|made from the overturned boats.
{122094}{122174}Twenty-two of us lived|in a tiny, dark little hut.
{122178}{122218}The weather was just appalling.
{122222}{122305}Blizzards and snowstorms|almost the whole time.
{122309}{122375}The great difficulty, of course,|was lack of water.
{122380}{122427}There was frozen water all round...
{122431}{122494}...but you can't suck ice|at those temperatures.
{122498}{122550}Itblisters your lips and your tongue...
{122554}{122610}...as though you'd sucked|a piece of hot iron.
{122614}{122661}So we'd take a few chips of ice...
{122665}{122743}...in our sleeping bags with us|at night in a tobacco tin.
{122747}{122834}And if you lay very still,|a few of the chips would melt...
{122838}{122927}...and you'd have a spoonful of water|for breakfast in the morning.
{123019}{123054}Food was very short.
{123058}{123150}We had little except a little seal|and penguin whenever they came up...
{123154}{123275}...and Marston had a little cookery book,|from which he'd read one recipe a night.
{123280}{123345}We all lay around very quietly|and very solemnly...
{123349}{123413}...suggesting, in turns, improvements|and alterations...
{123417}{123459}...and when the last man finished...
{123463}{123563}...we dreamt of the second helpings|we'd refuse when we were back home.
{123568}{123639}lt's difficult to realize|how hungry a man can be.
{123643}{123685}When we'd eaten our rations...
{123689}{123751}...and such seals and penguins|as we could catch...
{123755}{123814}...then and then...
{123818}{123917}...without any enmity,|we looked at one another.
{124151}{124245}{Y:i}Each day Wild roused the company|from their bags with the cry:
{124249}{124327}{Y:i}''Lash up and stow!|The Boss may come today!''
{124337}{124409}{Y:i}But by the end of August,|even Wild had given up hope...
{124413}{124468}{Y:i}...that Shackleton would return.
{124530}{124591}{Y:i}Orde-Lees summarized the situation:
{124603}{124697}The idea of a ship ever coming now|is getting more and more remote...
{124701}{124808}...as preparations are being pushed along|for sending one of our two boats.
{124816}{124897}{Y:i}Wild and four other members|are to go in the Dudley Docker...
{124901}{124993}...and will make their way from island|to island of the South Shetlands...
{124997}{125054}...until they reach Deception lsland...
{125058}{125126}...about 250 miles away.
{125161}{125221}Itis a big undertaking.
{125325}{125383}{Y:i}On August 30, 1 9 1 6...
{125387}{125487}{Y:i}...the men were gathered in their hut|for a lunch of boiled seal backbone.
{125491}{125603}{Y:i}Marston and Hurley remained outside|shelling limpets picked in the shallows.
{125647}{125713}{Y:i}Suddenly, Marston put his head|inside the hut.
{125717}{125753}{Y:i}Macklin recalled:
{125757}{125857}Marston burst in asking if it would|not be a good thing to send up smoke.
{125861}{125919}Wild called out to know|what was the matter.
{125923}{125978}Marston replied with the magic words:
{125982}{126023}''A ship!''
{126165}{126264}{Y:i}From the deck of the Yelcho, Shackleton|scanned Cape Wild through binoculars...
{126269}{126353}{Y:i}...counting the figures who poured out|of the hut onto the beach.
{126506}{126539}{Y:i}Frank Worsley recalled:
{126544}{126637}Two, five, seven,|and then an exultant shout:
{126641}{126729}''They're all there, skipper.|They're all safe!''
{126889}{126929}Crean joined us...
{126933}{127019}...and we were all unable to speak.
{127401}{127506}{Y:i}All hands were safe.|Not one life had been lost.
{127777}{127860}{Y:i}An ecstatic welcome|greeted Shackleton in Punta Arenas.
{127865}{127922}{Y:i}Although Germany|was at war with Britain...
{127926}{128010}{Y:i}...the German community|raised flags of celebration.
{128416}{128485}{Y:i}The crew of the Endurance returned|to a British nation...
{128489}{128572}{Y:i}...that little resembled the one|they had left two years before.
{128584}{128665}When Shackleton|and his men had left England...
{128669}{128723}...the Great War had just started...
{128728}{128830}...and their minds|were still in Edwardian England.
{128834}{128961}When they returned to civilization now,|they entered the modern world...
{128965}{129105}...and the war, as it turned out,|was beyond their comprehension.
{129125}{129261}And because of the dreadful carnage|on the battlefields in Europe...
{129265}{129324}...Shackleton rather disappeared.
{129329}{129451}And in any case, he was the wrong|kind of hero for England at the time.
{129455}{129509}The British wanted dead heroes...
{129513}{129598}...and they had lots and lots|of dead heroes.
{129946}{130001}l suspect in 1 91 8...
{130005}{130122}...the death of so many people|in the trenches in the war...
{130126}{130190}...made them feel that they had been...
{130199}{130257}...l could've said, nearly cowards.
{130261}{130358}That they avoided two years of the war|and they were lucky to be alive.
{130445}{130526}{Y:i}Most of the men|entered the war upon their return.
{130577}{130675}{Y:i}Frank Hurley went off to photograph|the fighting in the trenches.
{130682}{130793}{Y:i}Tim McCarthy would be killed|at sea six weeks after enlisting.
{130933}{130991}{Y:i}McNish emigrated to New Zealand...
{130996}{131092}{Y:i}...working on the docks|before suffering a crippling injury.
{131109}{131189}{Y:i}Most members of the expedition|were awarded the Polar Medal...
{131194}{131285}{Y:i}...but Shackleton withheld this honor|from McNish and three others.
{131299}{131396}{Y:i}The carpenter's brief rebellion|on the ice had cost him dearly.
{131649}{131690}{Y:i}As Shackleton had known...
{131694}{131785}{Y:i}...the Endurance expedition|had been his last chance at glory.
{131932}{132015}{Y:i}In 1 92 1, he headed south once more...
{132019}{132087}{Y:i}...joined by a handful|of the old Endurance crew:
{132091}{132213}{Y:i}Worsley, Macklin, Green,|Hussey and Frank Wild.
{132269}{132334}{Y:i}The goal of the expedition was unclear.
{132338}{132418}{Y:i}All that mattered was|that they were heading south again.
{132513}{132581}{Y:i}On the evening of his arrival|in South Georgia...
{132585}{132647}{Y:i}...Shackleton had a heart attack and died.
{132652}{132722}{Y:i}He was not quite 48 years old.
{132827}{132869}{Y:i}At the request of his wife...
{132873}{132958}{Y:i}...his men buried him in the island's|small whaling cemetery.
{133523}{133627}{Y:i}Bereft, Shackleton's men continued|their uncertain expedition.
{133646}{133747}{Y:i}Along the way, they took time to visit|a place they never thought to see again:
{133751}{133805}{Y:i}Elephant Island.
{133828}{133913}{Y:i}The expedition photographer|recorded their visit.
{134333}{134402}{Y:i}Confronting the site of their dark winter...
{134406}{134483}{Y:i}...they were overcome|with unexpected nostalgia.
{134493}{134525}{Y:i}Macklin:
{134529}{134583}We have stood gazing with binoculars...
{134587}{134670}...picking out and recognizing|old familiar spots.
{134710}{134793}What memories, what memories!
{134824}{134911}They rush to one like a great flood|and bring tears to one's eyes.
{134915}{135001}As l sit and try to write,|a great rush of feeling comes over me...
{135005}{135061}...and l find l cannot express myself.
{135065}{135155}Once more, l see the old faces|and hear the old voices.
{135160}{135232}Old friends scattered everywhere.
{135249}{135332}But to express it all,|l feel, is impossible.
{135582}{135653}{Y:i}Shackleton's feeling|about the Endurance expedition...
{135657}{135705}{Y:i}...was expressed in his memoir:
{135725}{135793}{Y:i}''We had seen God in his splendors...
{135801}{135881}{Y:i}...heard the text that nature renders.
{135887}{135986}{Y:i}We had reached the naked soul of man. ''
This is a true story
of my sister Daisy and my cousin Gracie and me
when we were little.
Our people, the Jigalong mob,
We were desert people then, walking all over our land.
My mum told me
about how the white people came to our country.
They made a storehouse here at Jigalong.
Brought clothes and other things: flour, tobacco, tea.
Gave them to us on ration day.
We came there, made a camp nearby.
They were building a long fence.
My dad was a white man working on that fence.
The white people called me a half-caste.
See that bird?
That's the Spirit Bird.
He will always look after you.
Hey, granddaughter, watch where you run.
You kids will destroy the tracks.
He's here somewhere.
Keep looking.
Maybe over there.
Here they are. Look.
He's going this way.
See the tracks?
Here, here. In the tree.
Watch out for his claws.
Good hunters in this family.
You're growing up fast, Molly.
That's them.
Molly's the big one. The little one's her sister Daisy.
The middle one's their cousin,
Gracie.
- What about the fathers?
- Moved on.
- I catch 'em goanna.
- Molly got goanna!
Bring it here.
Fat one!
Molly, hide those kids.
Police looking for half-castes.
Next batch.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
There's two applications for section 63 exemptions.
The police reports are there.
William Harris is applying for permission to marry - she's half-caste also.
And Mary Wilson is applying for permission to visit her child at Moore River.
She's quite agitated.
Oh, and Gladys Phillips has written for permission to buy some new shoes.
She had a new pair a year ago.
This report from Constable Riggs about the three little half-caste girls at the Jigalong Fence Depot-
Molly, Gracie and Daisy.
The youngest is of particular concern.
She's promised to a full-blood.
I'm authorising their removal.
They're to be taken to Moore
River as soon as possible.
Oh, and Miss Thomas - if you could check that the rate for police transportation is still, I believe, eight pence per mile.
- Yes, Mr Neville.
- Thank you.
That country over there, that's woman country.
You can't go there.
You get big trouble.
Yeah, I know.
- Where your country?
- My country?
Down south. Long way from here.
Our dad works there on the rabbit fence.
Yeah?
How far does rabbit fence go to?
The rabbit-proof fence?
It goes all the way to the sea down that way.
Right to the top of Australia.
Longest fence in the world.
And all the way to the sea down that way.
1,500 miles long.
Keeps the rabbits on that side of the fence, keeps the farmland on this side of the fence.
That Molly's getting to be a big girl.
Mr Neville's been writing to me about those girls, you know?
Tell that Mr Devil
Molly not going.
She get married.
You tell that Mr Devil, he want half-caste kid, he make his own.
Frankie.
Come on, it's your turn.
Come and get your rations.
Hurry up.
Run!
Gracie, come here!
I've come for the girls.
Can't have 'em in a black fellas' camp.
- My kids! Mine!
- It's the law, Maude.
- You've got no say in it.
- No! Mine!
Mr Neville's orders.
Move one inch and I'll lock your mother up!
He's their legal guardian.
Get away from us! No!
Gracie!
Give me back my kids!
You sit up and you stay!
- I got the papers, Maude.!
- Don't take them!
You got no say in it!
Come along.
Just get in the back!
The three of youse, don't move.
There's nothing you can do here, old girl.
- Nothing you can do.
- Leave them!
Leave them!
Every Aborigine born in this state comes under my control.
Notice, if you will, the half-caste child - and there are ever-increasing numbers of them.
Now, what is to happen to them?
Are we to allow the creation of an unwanted third race?
Should the coloureds be encouraged to go back to black or should they be advanced to white status and be absorbed in the white population?
Now, time and again
I'm asked by some white man,
"If I marry this coloured person, will our children be black?
As Chief Protector of Aborigines it is my responsibility to accept or reject those marriages.
Here... is the answer.
Three generations.
Half-blood grandmother, quadroon daughter, octoroon grandson.
As you can see, in the third generation, or third cross, no trace of native origin is apparent.
The continuing infiltration of white blood finally stamps out the black colour.
The Aboriginal has simply been... bred out.
Now... we come to... the Moore River
Native Settlement.
Most of you are familiar with our work here, the training of servants and farm labourers.
I would like to thank you for your continuing support.
Hundreds of half-caste children have been gathered up and brought here to be given the benefit of everything our culture has to offer.
For if we are to fit and train such children for the future they cannot be left as they are, and, in spite of himself, the native must be helped.
Hello there.
A ghost!
You poor dears.
It's such a long way.
You must be exhausted.
Come along. I'll take you straight to the dormitory.
Quickly. It's all right.
Come on. Down you hop.
Come along.
Follow me. Come along.
Follow me, please.
That's the way.
Come along.
There's some beds there.
The bucket's in the corner.
Hurry up.
Back to sleep, the rest of you. No talking.
Get up!
All of youse! Make your beds.
Hurry up.
Karen, Cheryl, stop running around.
Get them blankets tidy.
What's your name?
Where you from?
You'll get used to it.
Tracker girl, get that bucket.
Take it out now!
What are you standing there dreaming about? Hurry up!
Move!
Get out to breakfast now.
Come on.
Get going, all of you.
Come on. You coming?
Thank you, children.
Ready for our prayers.
Bow your heads. Eyes closed.
Thank you for the food we eat.
Thank you for the world so sweet.
Thank you for the birds that sing.
Thank you, God, for everything.
There will be no talking.
We'll have no wangka here.
You talk English!
Now, eat!
Eat, or I'll hold your nose and force it down you!
Here.
Keep still.
We've got to scrub you.
Let me see.
Doesn't that feel better?
- Yes, Miss Jessop.
- Yes, Miss Jessop.
- Thank you, Miss Jessop.
- Thank you, Miss Jessop.
That feels much better.
Here.
Take it.
Put these on.
Come on. Get dressed.
New clothes.
This is your new home.
We don't use that jabba here.
You speak English.
♪ Way down upon the Swanee River
♪ Far, far away
♪ There's where my heart is turning ever
♪ There's where the old folks stay
What are they doing?
Singing Mr Debil's favourite song.
- Who's that?
- On the end, on that chair.
♪ Still longing for the old plantation
♪ And for the old folks at home
Very good.
Well done.
The following children will come forward. Tommy Grant.
This way, Tommy.
Come on. Stand up straight.
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
- What they doing now?
- Checking for the fair ones.
- Why?
- To take them to Sister Kate's.
They're more clever than us.
They can go to proper school.
Thank you. No.
Good boy.
Molly Craig.
That you.
- Molly Craig!
- Go on, get up.
Hurry up. They'll whip you.
Molly. Come on, dear.
Get up. Quick.
- Come on, young lady.
- They'll put you in the boob.
- Just Molly, please.
- Where you going? Come back.
- Sit down.
- Hurry up.
Come along.
It's all right.
That's the way.
Don't be afraid.
Come along.
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- See?
Bit further.
That's it.
It's Molly, isn't it?
I know it all feels very strange, but after a few days you'll feel quite at home.
We're here to help and encourage you in this new world.
Duty, service, responsibility - those are our watchwords.
- Molly, keep still.
- It's all right.
No.
Sweep it over here.
To the door.
Come on, this way.
Push it towards me.
Hey, tracker girl.
Your dad's bringing
Olive back. He catched her.
Thank you, Moodoo.
There now, young lady.
Did you really think you'd get away with it?
Now, stop that crying.
See what Miss Doyle has here?
Olive, look at me.
You see this here? The scissors?
Did she run away home?
She ran away to see her boyfriend.
You should have thought about this beforehand. Come on.
We'll see if those boys find you so attractive now.
In you go.
Broke out through here.
Usual story.
Off to see her boyfriend.
- The tracker brought her back.
- Yes, Moodoo.
Mr Neal tells me that your probation period is up and that you wish to return to the Kimberleys. Is that right?
Of course your daughter is here, isn't she?
There would be no question of her going.
She would have to stay here and continue her training.
I think for the time being it would be best for all concerned if you were to remain here,
Moodoo.
I'd be prepared to consider your case in a year or so, but... until then...
Those babies.
Where are their mothers?
They got no mothers.
Nobody here got any mothers.
I got mother.
Come on, they're lining up.
Let's go.
Bad place.
Make me sick.
These people...
Sick.
Make me sick.
Come on, make your beds.
Nice and tidy.
If you've already done it, get to the church now.
Hurry up.
Stop dawdling.
Molly, take the bucket out, then the three of you go to the church.
Come on, you kids, get up there! You're late.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Get your things. We're going.
- Where are we going?
- Home. To mother.
How we gonna get there?
Walk.
We're not going. Are we, Daisy?
We like it here.
That tracker, he's going to put us in that boob.
He's not going to put us in the boob.
We just keep walking.
The rain will cover our tracks.
We've got to go now.
Come on. Quick.
Come on.
Come on, Gracie. Now.
- Too far, Molly.
- Hurry up!
♪ He made their tiny wings
♪ All things bright and beautiful
♪ All creatures great and small
Come on. Let's go!
- Irene Clark.
- Here.
- Ellie Moodoo.
- Here.
Molly Craig.
Molly Craig.
Molly Craig.
Gracie Fields.
Daisy Kadibil.
Nina, have you seen the new girls?
Haven't seen them all day, miss.
Mister! Mr Neville said you'd better come real quick.
That's two days ago, Mr Neal.
Yes, I understand, but I require to be kept fully informed.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Those three girls.
They've run off.
- Oh, dear.
- I blame the older one.
I wondered when I saw her.
Too much of their mind... unfathomable.
The tracker's onto it. It must be kept out of the papers.
- No rain. Tracker'll get us.
- Tracker's not gonna get us!
Come on.
We've got to keep going.
Come on, Gracie.
Daisy, give me your bag.
Give us your bag, quick.
Give us it!
Hurry up. In the water!
We need to go fast.
I see...
I see... the kangaroo. Red rock.
No.
I don't see nothing.
There's no food here.
- I see...
- You don't know this place.
How we gonna eat?
Run!
Quick, hide. Come on.
Ask them, Molly. Ask them if they have something to eat.
You're from that
Moore River place, eh?
We’re going home.
Where your country?
- Jigalong.
- Jigalong?
Proper long way.
You know what you're doing?
That tracker from Moore River.
Him really good.
I heard he get them runaways all the time.
Gotta be good to beat him.
Take you back to that place.
Here.
You watch out for him, eh?
You think you're so smart...
Where are we?
We're lost.
Jigalong that way. North.
Tracker followed them to... this riverbank, but lost their tracks about a week ago.
There's been no sign of them since.
Three little half-castes.
We're talking quite a few man-hours.
Who's going to pay?
There's very little in my budget.
If your men can combine this with their regular duties...
We'll be able to handle the notifications.
- Post police stations, farms.
- We'll provide a description.
But if my men have to make trips outside of their duties it'll be an impost on your department.
If they are out on other jobs there would be no extra expense.
I can see that.
And it is the job of every one of your men as local Protectors.
My men will do their jobs,
Mr Neville.
- Now, a week ago, you said.
- Yes.
Hey, Maude. The girls have gone.
What'd you say?
They've run away from
Moore River. They're gone.
Everybody's looking for 'em.
And what do you think you might be up to?
Thieving my eggs, eh?
You come out here where I can see you. Come on.
Stand up. Out you come.
And get rid of that bread.
It's filthy.
You want something to eat, you ask for it.
Come on.
I'm not going to bite you.
You're on your own?
Got anyone with you?
Where you girls planning on going?
Cat got your tongue, eh?
Now get. Go on.
And watch out for those boys further along.
They go out hunting rabbits along the fence.
- That rabbit-proof fence?
- Yes, the rabbit-proof fence.
- Where that rabbit fence?
- East.
Which way now?
That way. That fence.
Find that rabbit fence, we go home.
Then we see our mum.
"The Chief Protector of
Aborigines, Mr AO Neville...
The devil!
...Is concerned about three native girls, ranging from eight to fourteen years of age, who a month ago ran away from the Moore River
Native Settlement."
"He would be grateful if any person who saw them would notify him... promptly.
"'We have been searching high and low for the children for a month past,' added Mr Neville,
Devil!
'And all the trace we found of them was a dead rabbit."'
It's the fence! Down there!
The latest sighting, which is four days old, puts them...
- The man from the newspaper.
- I have nothing more to say.
May I have a look?
Now, Albany, yes?
Gilwarra. Yalgoo...
Dalwallinu...
Gilwarra, Yalgoo.
Dalwallinu, Gilwarra, Yalgoo.
They're on the fence.
They're following the rabbit-proof fence.
Right!
Just because a people use Neolithic tools does not mean they have
Neolithic minds.
This makes our task very much easier. Look.
There's a branch off here to the west, north of Yalgoo.
You put your man out here on the fence north of this junction.
He can start to come down it to meet them, while our Moodoo comes up from the south behind them.
You can't miss them.
Where Daisy?
Wait here.
My legs, Molly.
They hurt. I can't walk.
I'm carrying you only once, all right?
Come on.
Come on...
Don't think I'm carrying you all the way.
Camp, Molly!
Company-
Where you girls headed?
Down to Mullewa?
You got family there?
- Where Mullewa?
- Mullewa?
West.
The way you're headed, along the number two fence.
They got two rabbit-proof fence?
My oath. They got three of 'em.
We're on the wrong fence.
Where that north fence?
North fence? Back that way - where you come from.
You can cut across.
I'll show you.
Number one rabbit fence.
Here's the number two fence.
Now you're here.
But you wanna be here.
Now, if you cut across here... you save yourself a hundred mile or so.
It's not hard.
I'm going back.
I don't have the petrol.
Over here.
And we're hungry.
Youse that lot from Moore River?
What, you girls walk all that way?
800 miles?
I was there.
Too scared to run away, but...
Everyone was always caught, stuck in that boob.
Youse got the furtherest.
Where you heading?
- Home.
- Mavis!
Stay here.
I'll come back and get you.
You can sleep with me tonight.
I'll get you some food.
Just getting the washing,
Mrs Evans!
What's that?
Someone coming.
Quick, in the bed.
Under the blankets.
What are you playing at, Mavis?
Go away.
Come on, quick.
Get up. Come on.
Don't go, Molly.
Please don't go.
He come back if you go.
Don't go.
He won't say anything.
Please.
Hello, Evans.
Hello.
Quick, wake up!
Wake up! Got to go.
Let's have a look.
Run that way and just keep going.
They were running out over there. About an hour or so ago.
We'll pick up the tracks in the morning.
I'll make a cup of tea.
That's the tracker.
Yeah, that's him.
Hop on.
I do not expect you to understand what I am trying to do for these people, but I will not have my plans put into jeopardy.
The problem of half-castes is not simply going to go away.
If not dealt with now, it will fester for years to come.
These children are that problem.
Please explain exactly what happened.
I don't know how they did it, but we lost them.
I had Larsen out there,
Moodoo was with him - and we lost them.
- They're making fools of us.
- They are indeed.
The cost is more than to just our pride.
This department's reputation is beginning to suffer.
I assure you, my men have better things to do than chase your charges all around the country.
Now... they're coming into very rough terrain.
Once they're much past
Meekatharra
I can't risk any of my men.
We must find them before they get into real desert country.
So, this is what we’re going to do.
You get your man up there.
Moodoo can join him.
Well up the fence, around here.
Far enough up so we know we cannot possibly miss them.
And I want them to stay there.
They can set up camp and wait.
Costly.
We'll just have to bear it.
Their lives may be at stake.
I understand the mother of one of the girls has gone to Wiluna.
They're headed into that country. I want the word spread.
Let's see what that does.
You wouldn't get me out there.
She's pretty clever, that girl.
She wants to go home.
Good thing you kids ran into me.
Lot of people worried for you.
Police up and down the country looking for youse.
It's in all the papers.
Which one of you is Gracie?
You Gracie?
I hear your mummy in Wiluna.
You can catch a train there from Meeka.
Come on. Let's go.
- Wiluna. She at Wiluna?
- Yes.
Come on, Gracie.
Don't listen to him.
He's a liar.
Maybe she's there, Molly.
Maybe he telling the truth.
Molly.
Let's go to Meeka.
Catch a train to Wiluna.
They see us, they'll catch us.
We can't stop now.
Got to keep going.
We're nearly there.
But Molly... mummy there.
She at Wiluna. I want mummy.
Come on.
Come on, Daisy.
Come on, Daisy.
You have to carry me, Molly.
Hop on.
She's not coming.
Don't look back. She'll come.
Higher.
You got 'em?
Three.
One for you, one for me...
And one for both of us.
Come on, Dais.
We’re going to wait for Gracie.
Go!
I've got her.
I want to get the train to mummy!
Can you see him?
Oi! Trevor!
Thanks, Jackie. You'll get your reward back at the station.
Taking you back where you belong.
She gone, Molly.
She not coming back.
Needle in a haystack.
That's it.
Pack your stuff!
We're getting out of here.
They're only paying us for three weeks.
To Constable Riggs, police station, Nullagine.
The two missing half-caste girls
Molly and Daisy are returning to Jigalong via the rabbit-proof fence, our efforts to apprehend them thus far having come to naught.
I therefore expect them to arrive in Jigalong in about a month's time.
In your capacity as local Protector you are to proceed to Jigalong to await their arrival and effect their recapture.
Yours, etc.
No fence.
I want mother.
That fence'll come back.
Home.
It's coming through now.
"Riggs arrived Jigalong."
"Awaits your instructions."
Yes, there will be a reply.
Please wait.
"Girls to be send south via Meekathara."
"To be accompanied at all times."
"Awaiting notification."
What's all that about?
Just some women's business.
Been going on all day.
Hey, Molly?
That tracker.
He not gonna get us now.
No, he not gonna get us.
I'm not going to stay here.
I can feel it.
They're up to something.
I’m going to take a look.
I lost one.
I lost one.
To Constable Riggs, police station, Nullagine.
At present we lack the funds to pursue the missing half-caste girls Molly and Daisy.
I would ask to be kept informed of their whereabouts so that at some future date they may indeed be... recovered.
We face an uphill battle with these people - especially the bush natives, who have to be protected against themselves.
If they would only understand what we are trying to do for them.
Tsk! Yours, etc.
Thank you.
We walked for nine weeks,
a long way, all the way home.
Then we went straight away and hid in the desert.
Got married.
I had two baby girls.
Then they took me and my kids back to that Moore River place.
And I walked all the way back to Jigalong again,
carrying Annabella, the little one.
When she was three, that Mr Neville took her away.
I've never seen her again.
Gracie is dead now.
She never made it back to Jigalong.
Daisy and me, we're here,
living in our own country,
Jigalong.
We're never going back to that place.
The New Republic Magazine was first published in 1914. it has been a fixture of American political commentary ever since. in May of 1998, its staff was comprised of 15 writer/editors.
Their median age was 26.
The youngest among them was
Stephen Glass.
There's so many show-offs in journalism...
...so many braggarts and jerks.
They're always selling, always working the room...
...always trying to make themselves look hotter than they actually are.
The good news is, reporters like that make it easy to distinguish yourself. lf you're even a little bit humble...
...a little self-effacing or solicitous, you stand out.
So you bring a co-worker lunch if he's under deadline.
You remember birthdays. it's true, journalism is hard work.
Everybody's under pressure.
Everybody grinds to get the issue out.
Nobody gets any sleep...
...but you are allowed to smile every once in a while.
Even Woodward and Bernstein went out for a burger now and then...
...and they won a Pulitzer.
Some reporters think political content makes a story memorable. l think it's the people you find, their quirks, their flaws...
...what makes them funny, what makes them human.
Journalism is just the art of capturing behaviour.
MONlCONDOMS
To Wrap Around Your Slick Willy!
You have to know who you're writing for.
And you have to know what you're good at. l record what people do. l find out what moves them, what scares them...
...and l write that down. That way, they're the ones telling the story.
And you know what?
Those kind of pieces can win Pulitzers too.

Sorry if I'm beaming, but l was his journalistic muse. it's true.
-Just seven years ago, he was sitting--
-Right there.
I'm sorry.
Right there.
And l was doing the exact same thing you guys are doing:
Grinding out pieces and then...
...having horrid nightmares of
Mrs. Duke and her infamous red pen.
And see what happens when greatness is demanded of you?
Now he's at The New Republic.

So l said, ''Network news, network news....
That's that show that's on between those Fixodent commerciais, right?''
Shut him up.
-Hey, Steve.
-Hey, Steve.
Hey, guys.
-Gloria, that necklace is you.
-Thanks, doll. l got some new merchandise for your girlfriend.
When l get this piece done.
-How's it coming?
-Horrible. it's the fundamental nature of the magazine, Lew.
MeIanie, can l get some copies, please?
People want photographs, they can buy Newsweek.
They do buy Newsweek, and Time and U.S. News & World Report...
...and our losses are a joke.
Let me guess, he's on you again about a redesign.
-Cover page and graphics.
-And photographs.
Let me remind you, Steve...
...this magazine hasn't changed its look since the '80s.
-How is it?
-it's good.
-You hate it.
-No, it's good. it's just a little rough.
No, it's the worst thing l ever wrote.
That's horrible. lf you don't help me, l won't send it in.
When's it due?
Tomorrow. l may have to kill myself. l mean,
The New York Times Magazine.
Will you guys help me with it? Please?
-Of course.
-Of course.
Thank you.
Call for you on three, sweetie.
Someone from Policy Review.
When did you start talking to Policy Review?
I'm not. it's probably nothing.
Send it to my voice mail.
And, sweetie...
...Caitlin just told me that she needs gifts for two showers next week.
-Think you have something for her?
-I'll get my box.
-l couldn't resist.
-So you want to do this now?
Yeah, in a second. l just have to return a quick phone call. l got you some gum. lf l were to throw a party...
...where all we did was play Monopoly, would you guys come?
-Could l be the little shoe?
-Of course.
The lawyers have asked us to tone down the cover on Serbia.
Yeah, they fear charges of libel. l know a little bit of libel law. it's only relevant if said person has been out of the public eye.
Well, yeah, so there's Serbia, hidden, unknown to the world at large...
...until it appeared on the cover of The New Republic.
-With our weekly circulation of 80,000.
-Eighty-one five.
-You done with it, Rob?
-Two days, tops.
Yes, two days from Hanukkah.
Hey, it's basically finished, for the most part.
Next up. Amy?
Just finished the piece on ethanol subsidies.
There are 16,800 magazines in this country...
...but only one calls itself the in-flight magazine of Air Force One.
And that's the thrill of working at The New Republic.
You're underpaid, the hours are brutal...
...but what you write gets read by people who matter.
Presidents, lawmakers--
Your work can actually influence public policy.
That's an amazing privilege and a huge responsibility.
I'm sorry, they don't want the whole journalistic-responsibility speech.
Do you?
You just wanna know how to get your name in print, right?
Sounds familiar.
Okay. Let me take you through the life of your typical piece...
...so you can see where the hurdles are.
We'll use one l wrote last year...
...about a bunch of young Republicans at a conservatives convention.
Journalism is about pursuing the truth...
Spring Breakdown
...and l would never encourage you to do anything sneaky or dishonest...
...in pursuit of a story, such as assuming a phoney identity.
1997 CPAC Conference,
Washington's Omni Shoreham Hotel l don't know, man, it seemed like a pretty good turnout to me.
No, man, conservatism's dead.
-Dead?
-We're lost.
Damn straight!
On a story like that, your notes are crucial.
You have to record everything you see and hear...
...every quote, every detail...
...all the way down to the mini-bottles in the fridge.
We're like this guy who has to pee:
Lost in the desert looking for a tree.
-it's true.
-Completely true.
You guys know what you're shopping for, right?
Totally.
Get us a real heifer.
The fatter the better.
Bad acne would be a bonus.
Let's do it!
Let's get the harpoon !
TITLE: Young Conservatives Project
Spring Breakdown
-Hey, Steve.
-Hey, Chuck.
What are you working on?
The piece Gabriel García Márquez wrote about the FalkIands war.
How about you?
Young Republicans at the CPAC conference.
Pretty standard stuff.
Hotel ballrooms, boring speeches, chicken dinners.
Which is why everybody spends their time in the suites upstairs...
...committing felonies.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, l went to one.
The ballroom is empty.
Every delegate under the age of 25...
...was up on the fifth floor getting loaded.
Drugs, binge drinking, hookers....
Gets pretty ugly.
-Sounds great, Steve.
-So does yours.
Okay, well.... l gotta get back to work.
-Have a good lunch.
-Thanks.
Hold it. l have to give myself a demerit for poor scene-setting.
Let me explain. A year ago,
Chuck Iane and l were peers.
He hadn't become editor yet.
Michael Kelly was editing the magazine then.
Sorry, Mrs. Duke. l know how you feel about clarity.
We've gotta start calling some other places. l don't think l can eat this stuff every day. it was the Cannon Building.
You had it as Russell. l fixed it.
Thank you.
-l really liked it, Ames.
-But boring, right?
No, l really, really liked it.
-Yes, dear?
-Somebody for you on three.
Someone from Harper's.
-When did you start talking to them?
-I'm not. it's probably nothing.
-Send it to my voice mail.
-Very good.
By the way, Glo, that lipstick is the bomb.
Thanks, doll.
What is it, Midnight Mist?
-l really got to stop doing that.
-What?
All l do is give people more reasons to assume I'm gay. l mean, lately, it's everyone.
The other night, l went to dinner with this guy from The Post.
-Who?
-l can't tell you. He made me promise.
We're walking around afterwards...
...talking about Medicare for God's sakes.
Then, the next thing l know, we're standing on the corner of 18th and T...
...and he somehow managed to slip his tongue down my throat.
And I'm like, ''Wait a minute, how'd this happen?''
-l don't understand.
-Yeah, neither did l.
-Hey.
-Michael.
-Got a minute?
-Of course.
We have a problem with the ''Spring Breakdown'' piece.
Just got a letter from David Keene.
He ran the CPAC conference.
-He's made some--
-Are you mad at me?
He's made some pretty serious charges. We need to answer them.
Okay. My notes are at home. l can be back in 20 minutes. is that too long?
Do your notes have anything about the minibars? That would help. l think so. No, I'm sure. Why?
He claims the Omni Shoreham doesn't even have minibars. l saw them. No, there were little bottles of booze all over the room.
Okay. I'll get Aaron and Rob into it and start the fact-check again.
-I'll get my notes.
-Thank you.
I'm sorry, we'll have to finish this later.
No, no, l understand. Thank you.
What's wrong?
Just tell me.
Keene was right, Michael. l messed up. l made a huge error. l don't know what to say. lf you want me to resign, l will. l want you to tell me what happened.
They don't have minibars at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. l guess l just saw all those little bottles and l made an assumption...
...which l know we're never supposed to do.
I'm really sorry.
Those guys were drinking out of a rented refrigerator, a mini-fridge.
-That's it?
-Yeah.
-The rest of the piece is solid?
-Well, yeah, of course.
Go home, Steve.
Your resignation will not be required.
-Really? You're not mad?
-Of course not.
-Do you want my notes?
-Have a good night.
Thanks, Michael.
Thanks for backing me. it's what editors do.
Good night.
Hi. Front desk, please.
Hi, l need some information.
Do the suites at your hotels have minibars?
Well, can a guest rent something like that...
...like a mini-refrigerator or something?
They can.
Okay, thank you very much.
She says, ''l didn't invite
Vernon Jordan that evening...
...because my guests of honor were girls from Smith College.
Some of them were virgins, and l wanted to keep it that way.''
You're gonna put that in the article, right?
Gosh, Alec, l don't know. l mean, you know, George is such a dignified publication.
You wouldn't want something that gossipy?
No. Absolutely not.
Of course I'm putting it in.
Thank you, Stephen. You're going to make me look very, very smart.
The Fritos are running dangerously low. I'll be right back.
You can't hide in here all night, Ames.
Can l ask you something?
What is this? l found it in the freezer.
You said you hated how the Diet Coke at parties...
...was always at room temperature.
How if you wanted it cold, you'd have to put it on ice.
Then it would get too watery.
Don't you remember?
Yeah, l do, but l said that a couple of years ago.
Steve, I'm gonna call it a night, but thanks for having me.
-Thanks for coming.
-Alphabetized beer. That's perfect.
Drive safe, Alec.
-Who's he?
-Associate editor of George.
When did you start talking to George?
I'm really not. it's probably nothing. lf they stoop any lower...
...soon there won't be a difference between Time and People.
You say that like there is a difference between Time and People.
-Exactly.
-Thank you, Steve.
What?
GEORGETOWN UNlVERSITY
LAW CENTER
Are you mad at me? l told you, l do not respond to,
''Are you mad at me?''
I'm not your kindergarten teacher.
We've been over this a thousand times already.
You can't go to law school.
You don't wanna go to law school, remember? l know. it's only nights. l wouldn't have to stop working or anything.
-I'll just put these down. I'll be back.
-No! l wanna talk about this. l told you, it's my parents, okay?
They never shut up about it. lf l don't go, they won't let me be a journalist.
''Let you''?
You're 24 years old, Stephen.
You don't know how things go where l grew up, Caitlin. There are rules there. lf your son's not a doctor or lawyer, you're nothing.
You're writing for The New fucking
Republic. isn't that good enough?
Not in Highland Park.
-I'm sorry, l--
-Stop apologizing for everything. l was looking through your mail.
You should be pissed at me.
-I'm not.
-You're gonna throw this out, right? l can't. I'm sorry.
Every station on the radio is talking about it:
Mike Tyson biting Evander Holyfield.
And these are supposed to be news stations.
So on Tuesday l started calling a few, and finally l got through to one...
...a Bible talk station in Kentucky. l managed to convince the screener that l was a behavioral psychologist...
...who specializes in human-on-human biting. l told the guy I'd done all this extensive research...
...on people who chomp flesh under extreme stress.
What did they say?
They put me on the air. l took calls for 45 minutes.
Oh, my God.
Where does he find these people? it's kind of stupid, l know. it's silly.
I'll probably just kill it.
-That mean you'll help me with it?
-Why, do you have finals this week?
Okay, moving right along. Chuck.
What do you have for us?
That's a bit of a hard act to follow.
Very hard act to follow. Okay....
I'm starting the piece on Haiti...
...and I'll be going to....
Don't let me interrupt.
-Hey, Marty.
-Michael.
I'm gonna be going down to
Port-au-Prince for a few days.
Marty Peretz. Our boss.
He's a little scary.
How about the commas in dates?
Are we supposed to circle those too?
Let's just get this done, okay?
What the hell is this?
Marty told us to circle all the commas in the last issue...
...to show us how we used them improperly.
-What?
-He said they should appear in pairs.
Apparently, the issue is rife with errors.
-Rife.
-That's what he said. l see.
I'm not angry, Marty,
I'm embarrassed for you.
These people work gruelling hours for meager pay.
They deserve a thank you...
...not another one of your world-famous tantrums.
I'd resign before I'd let you bully them like that again, and l will.
Do you understand that?
Okay. Thank you.
The great comma debate is history...
...so we can all go back to work.
There are good editors, there are bad editors. You'll have both.
My hope for you, though, is that once...
...at least once, you get a truly great one.
A great editor defends his writers...
...against anyone.
He stands up and fights for you.
Michael Kelly was that kind of editor.
He had that kind of courage.
And that's what hung him.
-Hello?
-Chuck, it's Marty Peretz.
-Got a minute?
-Of course, how are you?
I'm in a bit of an uncomfortable situation...
...and l thought you might be able to help me out.
-Sure.
-it's about Mike.
He and l-- it hasn't been working out for some time now, as you know.
The tone of the magazine, l think it's gotten too nasty. it's strayed from the traditions that make it great...
...and I'm gonna be making a change. l see.
I'd like you to step in for him, Chuck.
I'd like you to become editor.
Editor?
There's a catch, of course.
Mike doesn't know any of this yet. it'll be two or three days before l tell him. it'll have to remain between us till then. Would that be a problem?
-Mike's a friend.
-l appreciate that, Chuck.
But l can't remove him until l know who will be his replacement...
...for continuity's sake.
So this is how it has to be.
I'm gonna have to think about this and discuss it with Catarina.
Of course, of course. Listen--
Marty, have you thought about the impact this might have on the staff?
-He's earned a lot of loyalty there.
-Mostly by fighting with me.
The point is, l haven't earned that kind of loyalty--
I'll be in New York tomorrow.
We'll go over all this in detail.
-Will you call me at the hotel?
-Yeah. l really appreciate this, Chuck, your discretion.
-Night.
-Night, Marty.
So l just got off the phone with Marty...
...and I've been fired, effective immediately.
I'm to be out of the building by 5 p.m.
Chuck Iane has been chosen to replace me.
Chuck is not an editor.
He's barely even a writer.
There's no way I'll be able to work for him.
We should have seen this coming.
The way he laughs whenever Marty tells a joke in the meetings.
They're never funny, but there's Chuck, completely howling.
-He's so political.
-And stiff. And humorless.
And how pissy does he get when you try to fact-check one of his pieces?
I'm sorry, but we have an obligation to get our facts straight.
Okay, let's not overdo it.
This is still a great magazine. it's still an important magazine, and...
-...Monday morning he'll be running it.
-I'm gonna barf.
All right, let me get out of here, okay?
Well, l just want to thank you all again. Truly.
I've loved every second of this.
-Good luck, Mike.
-You too, Chuck.
Hi.
Hi.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I'm sorry about what happened when he left. l just didn't know what to do.
Thanks.
You need a hand with the boxes,
I'll be in my office.
So Chuck took over.
And the job, for the first time ever, began to feel like a job.
But I'm being unfair.
The truth is l wrote 14 pieces while
Chuck was editing the magazine.
And the last of them was the biggest story l ever wrote. is anyone interested in hackers?
Because l met this kid named Ian Restil.
Biggest computer geek of all time.
He hacked his way into the database of a company called Jukt Micronics...
...and posted naked pictures of women and the salary of all Jukt employees...
...on Jukt's website with a note saying:
''The Big Bad Bionic Boy has been here, baby!''
Outstanding!
Jukt decided it'd be cheaper to hire him...
...as a security consultant than to try to stop him.
They met with him at the hotel where the National Hackers Conference was. it was the chairman from Jukt, Restil,
Restil's mother and Restil's agent.
-No.
-Yes. Hackers have agents too. l was at the table with these guys.
Restil's just laying out all of his demands. l want a Miata.
-l want a trip to Disney World.
-l want X-Men comic book #1. l want a lifetime subscription to Playboy.
And throw in Penthouse.
They're complying with every word.
Excuse me, sir.
Pardon me for interrupting.
We can arrange more money so you can buy the comic book.
And when you're of a more appropriate age...
...you can buy the car and pornographic magazines on your own.
Cool.
After they have the meeting...
...he goes back into the conference, where all the hackers have gathered.
And they're treating him like he's a rock star.
Then Restil jumps up on a table, and he's like: l want a Miata!
And he's gyrating his hips like this:
''l want a Miata! l want my Playboys! l want a trip to Disney World!
Show me the money!
Show me the money!''
Turns out there are now 21 states considering versions of a law called...
...the Uniform Computer Security Act, which would criminalize...
...immunity deals between hackers and the companies they've torched.
Meanwhile, Restil's agent claims a client list of over 300...
...one of whom was once paid a million dollars and a monster truck.
That's unbelievable. it's really silly, l know.
I'm not even sure if I'm gonna finish it.
HACK HEAVEN
By Stephen Glass
The offices of Forbes Digital
Wednesday, May 6, 1998
Shit.
-You rang?
-Yes, l rang.
Why didn't you get this?
Yeah...
...that.... l don't know.
Ian Restil - Jim Ghort
''Big Bad Bionic Boy''
Nevada law-enforcement officials big-time software firm - called Jukt
Jukt Micronics - Search
There were no matches for ''Jukt Micronics''
Hey?
Hey. is it pronounced ''juked'' or ''jukked''? it's pronounced
''give me back my article.''
Dang.
Adam, can you give a man a minute?
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. it's just that this New Republic piece is a fucking sieve. l checked on Jukt Micronics...
...which is supposedly a major company in California. l went through every search engine on the web. No matches found.
So l called 411, every area code in the state.
There's no listing for a company called Jukt Micronics.
Tried the
California Tax Franchise Board.
There's no record of taxes ever being paid by a company called Jukt.
Tried the state comptroller's office.
No license was applied for...
...by a company using that name. l called all the hackers l know...
...asking if any had heard of a National
Assembly of Hackers...
...or of a hacker named
Big Bad Bionic Boy.
Nothing. l even tried
Ian Restil himself.
There's no listing for the kid in D.C.,
Virginia, Maryland....
There's no record of him ever attending a public school before.
-More?
-Please.
This guy, Joe Hiert, was described by Glass as a former basketball agent.
No one by that name was ever registered with the NBA.
And none of my hackers knew of him.
Look, l even checked the names of every government-- l was just getting some coffee. l checked names of every government employee quoted...
...against a book listing the names of all government employees in the U.S.
None of the Glass sources were listed.
-But there is one thing that checks out.
-What's that?
There does appear to be a state in the Union named Nevada.
Stephen Glass
David, for Chrissakes.
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Stephen. l just wanted to see if you'd read it yet, and it was sitting right here.
-Don't hate me, okay?
-Stephen, you shredded it.
I'm trying to spare you a spanking, David.
You've got blind quotes all over the place.
Your facts are shaky. l mean...
...the line about the turnover at DOT was low by 4.5 percent. l checked.
Of course you did.
Rob and Aaron would kill you over that kind of stuff.
This is The New Republic, remember? Nothing slides here. lf you don't have it cold, you don't turn it in, ever.
-Okay.
-Look...
...bring me your notes later.
We'll go through it.
There's a lot about it that l liked.
-Really?
-Really.
And get back to work, okay?
The mailroom floor needs scrubbing.
Okay. Hey, thanks, Stephen.
You have one unheard message.
First message.
Hi, Stephen, this is Adam Penenberg from Forbes Digital Tool. l just got done reading your hacker article.
First of all, congratulations. l mean, everybody here just loved it.
But we wanted to do a companion piece to it, sort of a day-two story...
...and I'm having some trouble tracking down Ian Restil.
You think l could get a phone number on him from you?
Look, l think it's good that you tried this. it's good to stretch. l just.... l don't think you're writing to your strengths.
-Can l...?
-l mean.... l wonder why you'd wanna stray from the things you do so well.
Have you noticed the way Steve's phone has been ringing lately?
Did you see all those editors at the correspondents dinner?
-The way they were circling him?
-is that what you want, Amy?
To get a bunch of smoke blown up your ass by a pack of editors?
Yes. Yes, it is.
Caitlin...
...he's going to double his salary freelancing like that.
These guys don't want policy pieces anymore.
They want color.
They want nuance, humor.
Amy...
...you don't write funny. it's a little funny. isn't it?
-l was just looking for Stephen.
-He's in his office.
-You got a minute, Steve?
-Yeah.
You have numbers for your sources on ''Hack Heaven''?
But they're at home.
-Can l get them?
-Of course.
Did l do something wrong?
Are you mad at me?
No, l just need the phone numbers.
Okay.
Okay. Okay, I'm trying to keep cool about all this.
But you know the Uniform Computer
Security Act in the Glass piece?
Supposed to be under debate in 21 state legislatures? l just checked all 50. No such act.
-Beautiful.
-And Julie Farthwork...
...from the Computer Security Center?
Not too sure she exists either.
Same with Jim Ghort of the Center for interstate Online investigations.
And I've got nothing on the National
Assembly of Hackers or Frank Juliet.
-Man.
-Do you know why this is so great?
Do you see the irony?
The snobbiest rag in the business, in-flight magazine of Air Force One...
...and their star goes and gets completely snowed...
...by a bunch of hackers.
God couldn't have written this any better.
-Adam?
-Yeah?
Long as I'm grinding away on this, any chance you'd share your byline?
Forget it.
We are in uncharted territory here, Adam.
An online magazine going after a giant.
You should have someone beside you to take some flak in case it blows up.
-Gosh, that's touching.
-You're completely swamped.
-You're behind on the Polese piece.
-I'll get to it.
Look, everything that I'm working on is so...
...dull.
-And this is spectacular.
-Andy, no. it's not like you found this story yourself.
Kambiz just handed it to you. lf l hadn't been at the dentist, it'd be me about to get famous.
Why don't you just share the wealth, okay? Shit.
That came out a lot uglier than l meant it. Sorry.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Well, Ian Restil e-mailed me right back. it might be tough to put you in touch directly...
...or at least until next week.
This is his email:
''Your story screwed up my deal. l don't to talk to you.'' l think he meant
''don't want to talk to you.''
''I'm on vacation with my parents, so leave me alone.''
What kind of parent goes on vacation with their kid in early May?
That's a good question. l guess you have to know his mom.
She's a little quirky.
That's his email address if you want to write him yourself.
These are all my notes.
That's for the
National Assembly of Hackers.
Don't be thrown if all you hear is like a dark, deep, heavy breathing. it's-- l don't know, their outgoing voice-mail message.
Don't ask me why.
And then that's the number for Jukt Micronics.
The chairman's name is George Sims. l can't figure why this Penenberg guy would have such a hard time finding it.
But you know, whatever.
That's the URL to their website.
And then l can't seem to find
Joe Hiert's number. l was looking all over at home. it's somewhere, l know.
I'll get that tomorrow.
-lf that's okay.
-Sure.
He's Restil's agent.
Should l...? I'll give you some privacy.
No, have a seat.
650, is that Palo Aito?
No, Silicon Valley.
You'll probably get a voice mail. l usually do.
You've reached the offices of Jukt Micronics.
Please leave a message. it's Charles Lane from The New
Republic in Washington D.C.
I'd like to speak to George Sims, if l could.
They already have our number. l guess you already have our number.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
We've just spoken a million times now. it's actually his voice on the answering machine.
Sims is so hands-on...
...that he won't even let his secretary do an outgoing message.
-Who's next?
-Penenberg.
-This is Adam.
-Hi, it's Chuck Lane.
-Hi, Chuck.
-I've got a phone number for you.
-A phone number for what?
-For George Sims at Jukt Micronics.
-You got a pen?
-Yeah, sure.
Okay, thanks. it's a phone number for Jukt Micronics.
You've reached the offices of Jukt Micronics.
Please leave a message.
Do me a favor.
Call this number the same time l do, okay?
Ready? Go.
You've reached the offices of Jukt Micronics.
Please leave a message.
-What'd you get?
-it's a voice mail. l get a busy signal. Hang up.
Try again, okay? Redial.
-Busy signal.
-l got a voice mail. Hang up.
A major software company with one phone line?
-How you doing?
-Good.
He's up to 103.
Oh, shit.
Come here, buddy.
-Should l give him a bath?
-That would be great.
Yeah.
How you doing?
-Hello?
-Hello, this is George Sims.
-May l speak with Charles Lane?
-One moment, please.
Honey, it's George Sims.
I'll take him.
Come on, sweetheart. Yes, yes, yes.
-Oh, you're such a good boy.
-Hello?
Yeah, this is George Sims from Jukt.
Am l speaking with Charles Lane?
Mr. Sims, thank you for calling me back-- l don't have time for this, actually.
We're trying to have an office party.
Look, if you were calling for a comment on your story...
...l don't have one other than to say l wish you never ran the stupid thing.
That stuff was off the record, and your reporter knows it. That Glass guy.
-I'm calling to verify information.
-I'm not verifying anything.
Bottom line is I'd like you guys to basically get lost, okay?
Hello?
-Hey.
-David.
-Oh, I'm sorry, Steve.
-Shit. l didn't mean to startle you.
Thought you'd like some coffee.
-What are you doing here?
-Working late. Working on my article.
-So l don't get shredded again.
-Thank you.
You're welcome.
So l always forget to ask you :
How are your studies coming?
They're fine. I'm just buried.
You're buried. Right. Okay, l should probably let you get back to it.
-is there anything else you need?
-No. Good night, David.
All right. Night, Steve. l got it.
-Hello?
-Chuck, it's Steve.
-Hi, Steve.
-Hey, sorry to be calling so late. l was just wondering, did you get a call...
-...from the Jukt guy, George Sims?
-l did, yeah.
Yeah, l was sitting here, and l realized that I'd given him...
...your home number without asking you first, and l wanted to apologize. it's fine.
Sort of a prick, you think? l couldn't really tell, because he hung up so fast.
Are you at home, Steve?
-No, why?
-l left a message on your machine.
The Forbes guys want to talk to us again.
There's a conference call at 9 a.m.
Sure. Sounds like a party.
Yeah.
-Okay. Night, Chuck.
-See you in the morning.
That's weird.
Friday, May 8, 1998
THE NEW REPUBLlC
-Morning.
-Hey.
-Want a laugh?
-Sure.
-The website for Jukt Micronics.
-Oh, good.
Yeah, you might not think so when you see what's on it. l don't think Mr. Sims liked our piece that much. it is with great frustration that we read the article ''Hack Heaven''....
And l found this, too, on my fridge for some reason.
Ian Restil's agent, Joe Hiert.
JOE HlERT
Super-Agent to Super-Nerds
I'd like to pause.
You can't really go into journalism...
...without first understanding how a piece gets edited at a place like TNR.
This is the system Michael Kelly brought from The New Yorker...
...a three-day torture test. lf your article's good, it'll make it better. lf your article's shaky, you're in for a long week.
A story comes in, and it goes to a senior editor.
He or she edits it on computer...
...then calls in the writer to make revisions.
Then it goes to a second editor, and the writer revises it again.
Then it goes through a fact-check, where every fact...
...every date, every title, every place or assertion is checked and verified.
Then it goes to a copy editor, where it is scrutinized once again.
Then it goes to lawyers who apply their burdens of proof.
Marty looks at it too.
He's concerned with any comment the magazine makes.
Then production lays it out in column inches and type.
Then it goes back on paper, back to the writer, back to the copy editor...
...back to editor one and editor two...
...back to the fact-checker, back to the writer and back to production again.
Throughout, the lawyers read and re-read...
...looking for red flags, anything that feels uncorroborated.
Once they're satisfied, the pages are reprinted, and it happens again.
Every editor, the fact-checkers, they all go through it one last time.
Now, most of you will start out as interns somewhere...
...and interns do a lot of fact-checking, so pay close attention.
There's a hole in the fact-checking system, a big one.
The facts of most pieces can be checked...
...against some type of source material. lf an article's on ethanol subsidies...
...you can check against the congressional record...
...trade publications, LexisNexis, footage from C-SPAN.
But on other pieces...
...the only source material available...
...are the notes provided by the reporter himself.
Steve.
This doesn't look like a real business card to me.
Yeah, l know.
That's the kind of clown this guy is.
He won't even pay to have real cards made.
All right.
-My office at 9, okay?
-Yeah.
Good morning.
A few others we can't seem to locate:
Julie Farthwork, Frank Juliet and
Ian Restil's agent, Joe Hiert.
We called the numbers you gave us and got voice mails.
And the e-mails were sent back no address or account closed.
Really? Because I've e-mailed them about a million times each.
Hiert's online all day long.
Did you ever get them directly?
No. l always left messages and spoke to them when they called back.
And the references in the article to
Nevada law-enforcement officials....
You only spoke to Jim Ghort?
-Yes.
-You have a number for him?
-Yeah, definitely.
-By the way...
...what was your basis for writing that
Jukt was a big time software company? l didn't. That was added by the copy desk.
Was the hackers conference where you met the Jukt executives--?
That part of the article is misleading. l was never in the Restils' home.
You weren't there with the Jukt executives?
No. l didn't mean to imply that l had been.
Sorry about that.
Did the fax come through okay?
Yes, it did. l think the address was garbled.
We can't find the site.
-You wanna read it back to me?
-Sure.
You gave us,
''members.aol.juktn.html.''
-Wait. Was that an M?
-I'm sorry?
After ''Jukt,'' was that an M as in ''Micronics''?
No, it was an N, as in ''not working.''
-Try M.
-Okay.
-Sorry about that, l was just rushing.
-Of course.
But l do find myself wondering, Stephen...
...why would a major software company put their site...
...where only AOL members access it, as opposed to the entire web? l have no idea. l don't have a site. l don't know about them. l would trust you guys know better than me.
Okay.
Looks like we have the Jukt website up now.
Jukt Micronics l have to say, Stephen, this looks very suspicious to me.
-How so?
-Quite frankly, it doesn't look real. it looks like a site that was created to fool someone. l don't know much.
Could they do that?
-Of course.
-Very easily.
So easy, in fact, it's incredible.
Do you still want that number for Jim Ghort?
Because l just found it in my notes.
Yeah, sure.
-All right. 605-84--
-Oh, wait.
Sorry?
605, that's not Nevada. l guess l got him mixed up with another source.
Sorry about that one.
Oh, you know what it was?
Jim Ghort was the guy who told me about the law-enforcement officials. l don't know what l was thinking.
-I'm gonna have to get you that--
-Steve.
Give him the number.
This guy is toast.
All right, Stephen, in light of all this...
...how confident are you in this story of yours?
Are we off the record?
-lf you like.
-Well...
...off the record...
...some of the things that you've brought up...
...the website...
...the idea that l was always speaking to these people through voice mail....
That is, that they were always calling me.... it didn't seem strange before, but clearly there are problems.
You've pointed them out.
One portion of it was structured in a way that.... l just, well, in light of all this.... it's just I'm increasingly beginning to believe that I've been duped.
So we hang up after he's basically let these guys interrogate me for an hour.
And l go, ''Chuck, what happened? l mean, why didn't you back me up?''
And he goes, ''I'm sorry, Steve. l gotta protect the magazine. I'm the editor.''
-Typical.
-He's being such an asshole.
So I'm dead, pretty much.
Yes, this is Kambiz.
Can we have a talk here, just editor to editor?
Sure, go ahead.
Completely off the record and really almost human being to human being?
Of course.
You guys have discovered something that a troubled kid has done...
...but l still don't know how you plan to play it. l have no interest in embarrassing you or The New Republic.
I'm not worried about me or the magazine. That's fair.
But there's a kid here who basically just plainly screwed up, big time.
His reporting was sloppy, we know.
But we're trying to handle it internally at this point.
-Just as you would.
-Listen.
We're going to run something along the lines of a trick was pulled...
...and some hackers created an illusion. l can't tell you what to print or not to print. You guys are journalists.
But he could be very hurt by what you guys publish. His career.
Chuck, l understand. l do. l would hope if l made the mistakes he made...
...people would be generous with me.
But this concerns the very field we cover.
We have to run it.
And when we do, we're gonna need a comment from you.
So given everything that's happened...
...how strongly are you gonna stand behind this story?
I'm looking into it. it's really not that big a deal.
You got fooled by a source. it happens. They'll print a retraction, and that'll be that.
Steve, it won't hurt your career.
Of course, if you weren't so distracted by your classes....
Yeah, l know, l really gotta quit.
You're right.
-Can l speak to you for a minute?
-What about?
Let's do it in private.
We need to take a drive to Bethesda.
-What for?
-l wanna meet Joe Hiert. l told you, nobody knows where he is.
Well, maybe if we go to the hotel where he met with Restil and Sims...
-...someone will remember him--
-There were hundreds of people there.
These Forbes guys wanna come down on you.
-This is ridiculous.
-They're very suspicious of that article.
-You know that.
-Yeah.
But they're gonna go online with their piece tomorrow.
-Okay?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Now....
-Steve? Steve.
-Yeah? lf we can find Hiert, l can back them off for a day or two.
-Okay?
-Okay, I'll get my notes.
-Let's go.
-All right.
We were at this table.
Restil sat here. His mother was on his left. Hiert--
Sorry, his mother was on his right.
Hiert sat there.
But Restil wanted him closer, so he slid his chair over.
Sims sat here.
He had a lawyer next to him. l forget his name. it's in my notes.
Somebody smoked at this table.
So then Restil's mother insisted that we move to one farther away.
Over there.
The hacker conference was near here, right?
Yeah, the building next door. l don't remember, how many people did you say were at this?
Looked like a hundred, might've been two. it's in my notes.
Two hundred people. Here.
Yeah, they moved in and out. l mean, most of them were kids.
That doesn't seem credible to me.
All l know is, l was here.
All of us were right here.
Excuse me, sir, can l help you?
Yes, you can.
We're looking into a conference held here a couple Sundays ago.
Computer hackers.
You remember anything like that?
Are you sure you're in the right building?
-Yes, we're sure.
-Why is that?
Building's closed on Sunday.
All l know is l was here.
The conference was right here.
That's why the Restils only stayed a few minutes.
Because it was such a dumb place to squeeze into.
So they went to a restaurant for dinner with some of Ian's hacker friends.
Thank you.
How many?
People at the dinner, how many?
About 10, l think, including me.
Ian even put on a jacket.
-Hiert was there too?
-Yeah.
-is it near here?
-Yeah, it's across the street.
Good. Let's cross the street. l don't like the way you're treating me. it's like you won't even talk to me.
-This is the place?
-Yes. l didn't do anything wrong, okay? l didn't do anything wrong. You saw my notes. Everything was in there. l got tricked. l got fooled, I'm sorry.
What are you being so mad for?
-it was 10 people.
-Yes.
-For dinner.
-Yes.
They're closed at 3 on Sundays.
Yeah, l know. l know.
They almost didn't let us in.
But it was a couple minutes before 3,
Ian looked like he was ready to cry...
-...and so they said okay.
-But for dinner?
Go in and ask them yourself, Chuck.
Okay, go in and see if they would serve a party that came in at 2:58...
...and the answer would be yes.
Forbes is gonna have all this too.
They'll dig through the records of that building.
I'm sure they have cameras, and they're gonna check them.
-l didn't do anything wrong, Chuck.
-l really wish you'd stop saying that!
Steve....
-Anyone can make a mistake.
-You know, this is not right, Chuck.
Okay, l feel really attacked.
You're my editor.
You should support me.
And you're taking their word against mine?
You're supposed to support me!
Criticism of the president's program has been--
Leave it off.
I'm sorry l yelled at you back there.
Chuck?
Steve!
Pull the goddamn car over.
Yeah.
All right.
There's been so much pressure.
-l didn't mean to get anyone in trouble.
-Okay.
Okay.
You weren't at the conference.
No. l had a description of it from so many sources, l thought l had it solid.
Okay? And l wanted the piece to have an eyewitness feel to it for color.
So l said I'd been there myself.
And everything we told the Forbes guys--
I'm so sorry, Chuck. l just panicked. lf you want me to say that l made it up, l will. lf that will help you, I'll say it. l just want you to tell me the truth, Steve.
Can you do that?
I'm suggesting that there might be facets that you're not considering.
-Why are you defending him?
-Nobody's defending him, Chuck.
-Of course you're defending him.
-He's a kid.
He doctored his notes, Lew.
Just consider that for a second.
You know? He sat down and he hand-wrote a bunch of phoney quotes...
...and he handed them in as source material for the fact-check.
- Doesn't that offend you?
- Of course it does.
He lied to his editor.
That's supposed to offend you too.
He's a confused, distraught kid, obviously, Chuck.
So suspend him for a couple months, but let's not bury him.
Suspend him.
There are also political considerations to take into account here:
The rest of the staff, the way they feel about him. l already know all that.
What I'm saying is, if you fire him, some of these people will leave. l don't know if we'd still have a magazine at the end of the day.
-Hey, Caitlin.
-Not now, David.
-How's he doing?
-Well, he's a wreck, of course.
-l want him in here, Caitlin.
-He's too scared to come in here.
He thinks you want to destroy him.
He knows what he did was horrible.
He knows how badly he messed up.
The part he's most upset about is lying to you, Chuck.
He knows you took it as a sign of disrespect instead of as a panic move.
Think about the workload he's been carrying.
All this and classes.
He hasn't slept more than two hours in nine months.
He got a little sloppy and lied to cover his tracks.
-He's sick about it.
-Caitlin...
...the building he described, it doesn't even exist.
He just made it up.
So....
Obviously, he needs some help.
-He needs help.
-Just get him in here.
You can't fire him. l don't think he'll survive. You don't understand, we're all he has.
You can't fire him, Chuck.
Thanks, Lew.
Would you guys excuse us for a minute?
Chuck isn't firing Steve...
He's just suspending him for two years. l think l have to quit.

Steve.
What are you doing here?
I'm so dead. l mean, I'm over.
Nobody's ever gonna hire me again, are they? l was so sloppy, trusting my sources like that.
And then lying about it.
And to Chuck of all people. l mean, the one guy who's hated me all along.
I'm sure that it's not personal.
No?
Chuck keeps a list in his head...
...of everybody who's a Michael Kelly person.
A couple of times...
...l said some things l shouldn't have said about you.
So now I'm on it.
That's why he's so set on killing me now.
Well, l have to tell you, Steve, he's within his rights.
The things you did were fireable offenses. l know. I'm not saying that they weren't. l did some terrible, terrible things.
But believe me, Michael,
Chuck doesn't care about any of it. it's my loyalty to you that he's punishing me for.
I'm such an idiot.
Now who's gonna hire me?
Steve, l have to ask you something.
Did you ever cook a piece when l was your boss?
Did you ever lie to me?
The young-conservatives piece, the mini-bottles....
Was that true?
-Hello?
-Chuck, it's David Bach.
I'm really sorry to bother you, but it seemed important.
- it's fine. is there a problem?
- Well, l don't know. l just got off the phone with Stephen.
He sounds horrible.
-Did you suspend him, Chuck?
-David....
What is the problem?
He asked me if l would drive him out to Dulles later tonight.
He wasn't sure he'd be safe driving by himself. l just thought l should draw your attention to that.
Did he say where he was going?
Yeah, he said he'd be staying with family for a while.
-That can be only one of two places.
-His parents live in Highland Park.
Yeah, or his brother out in Palo Aito.
-I'm sorry?
-Yeah, his brother at Stanford.
Chuck?
You had your brother pose as George Sims.
-What?
-The phoney recording...
...from Jukt Micronics. it's a Palo Aito number...
...and your brother's at Stanford.
He posed as Sims.
No, Sims is a real guy.
I've talked to him a million times.
-My brother and l aren't speaking now.
-Stop it. You faked Sims.
-You faked the website, voice mails...
-You don't know, Chuck.
-...Restil, Hiert, Ghort.
-You got this backwards. it's all crap. l can trace it.
I'll find it all billed to you--
What are you talking about?
Those are all real people.
-They are?
-Yeah.
Look at me...
...and say that again.
Those are all real people.
Okay. l want you out of here.
-What?
-l want you out of here.
And you can't take anything with you.
There are some files. l have to put them on a disk.
-No.
-No, they're mine. Personal stuff! l don't care. l know you don't.
-Can l shut down--?
-Don't!
I'm in the middle of a file.
-Goddamn it.
-Back away from the desk.
-Leave it, or I'll call security.
-Christ.
Okay?
Can l take my Rolodex?
Steve....
-Can l take my law books?
-Sure.
Look, I'm gonna need to have your security key.
I'm not a criminal, Chuck.
Okay?
-I'm not a criminal.
-Oh, l heard you.
Come on.
Chuck? l said l was sorry. l know.
But you have to go.

-No problem, Steve.
Chuck?
The thing with George Sims...
...that was....
The voice you heard on the telephone...
...that was my brother. I'm sorry.
There really is a George Sims.
I've spoken to him a million times.
He just stopped talking to me.
You know, because of the article.
He was so mad about it. l didn't know what to do.
The guys from Forbes were putting pressure on me.
You know? And you were so mad. l just thought that if l could get everybody off my back...
...okay, for just a day....
Just a day would give me enough time to go and find him.
You can understand that, can't you?
You're fired, Steve.
What?
You're fired. You've lost your job.
But you can't--
Chuck...
...will you please take me to the airport?
Jesus.
Please, okay?
You don't have to talk to me if you don't want to. it's fine.
But l can't be by myself right now.
Okay? I'm....
I'm afraid of what I'm gonna do.
And you know, l can't get there by myself.
I'm not going anywhere with you. lf you feel you're a danger to yourself, you can sit down...
...until you feel calm enough to go.
But I'm not going anywhere with you.
But I'm afraid that I'm gonna do something, okay?
-Did you hear what l said?
-Yeah. it's a hell of a story.
Chuck, please?
Stop pitching, Steve. it's over.

Not suspended, fired.
This wasn't an isolated incident, Caitlin.
He cooked a dozen of them, maybe more.
We're gonna have to go through them.
All of them.
The only one was ''Hack Heaven.''
He told me that. lf he were a stranger, a guy you were doing a piece about...
...pretend that guy told you he'd done it once.
Would you take his word for it?
Of course not.
You'd dig, and you'd bury him!
You'd be offended if anyone told you not to.
-All those pieces were fact-checked--
-So was ''Hack Heaven''!
You're a good reporter.
You've always been a smart, thorough reporter.
Why can't you be one now?
Because what you're telling me is impossible, Chuck.
Go upstairs.
-Read them again.
-This is bullshit!
Go all the way back, because half of them ran when Mike was still here.
That's what this is. Of course.
What are you gonna do, Chuck?
Pick us off one by one...
...everybody loyal to Mike, till you have a staff belonging to you? is that the kind of magazine you'd run?
When this thing blows, there won't be a magazine. lf you wanna make this about Mike, l don't give a shit.
You can resent me, hate me, but come Monday morning...
...we'll all have to answer for what we let happen here.
We're all gonna have an apology to make.
Jesus Christ! Do you have any idea how much shit we're about to eat?
Every competitor.... They're gonna pounce, and they should.
Because we blew it, Caitlin.
He handed us fiction after fiction, and we printed them all as fact.
Just because...
...we found him entertaining. it's indefensible.
Don't you know that?
Monday, May 11, 1998 is everyone in the conference room?
You know what could've prevented all this?
No, what?
Pictures.
How could you make up characters...
...if everyone you wrote about had to be photographed?
You know, Stephen, if you wanted to, you could do these kids a giant favor.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
You could write something boring one of these days.
Give them a little less to live up to. l suppose l could. l mean, we don't want a bunch of teenagers getting ulcers, do we?
Morning.
THE NEW REPUBLlC
AN APOLOG Y TO OUR READERS it's funny. l thought l was gonna have to explain all this to you.
Well....
What do you think of this guy?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.
Steve?
Stephen?
We've read through all the pieces now, the entire staff.
And we've come up with a list whose facts and sources...
...we couldn't verify independently. l know you can't admit guilt of any kind...
...but l want you to confirm a few titles for me.
We won't confirm or deny anything now--
What I'm gonna do is this:
I'm going to read to you a list of suspicious titles, one by one. lf you raise an objection to a particular title...
...we'll fact-check it again in the hope of removing it from the list. lf you remain silent, we'll assume that piece is fabricated...
...either partially or entirely, and it will stay on. is that clear to everyone?
Okay.
''Hazardous to Your Mental Health.''
That means it stays on the list of suspicious pieces.
Fabricated pieces.
We understand. Can we move along?
''Holy Trinity.''
''Probable Claus''?
''Don't You D.A.R.E.''
''Spring Breakdown.''
''State of Nature''
''Rock the Morons.''
''After the Fall.''
You have to know who you're writing for.
And you have to know what you're good at. l record what people do. l find out what moves them, what scares them...
...and l write that down. That way, they're the ones telling the story.
And you know what?
Those kind of pieces can win Pulitzers too.

Adam Penenberg's article appeared on-line on May 10, 1998. it was hailed as a breakthrough for internet journalism.
That June, The New Republic printed an apology to its readers...
...admitting that 27 of the 41 pieces that Stephen Glass had written...
...for the magazine had been either partially or entirely invented.
Michael Kelly went on to become editor of The Atlantic Monthly. in April of 2003, he was killed while covering Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Stephen Glass graduated from
Georgetown Law School...
...and is now living in New York. in May of 2003, he published his first novel, ''The Fabulist''...
...about an ambitious journalist who invents stories and characters...
...in order to further his career.
Chuck Lane now writes for the Washington Post.

{73324}{73418}puzzles the will,|and makes us rather bear those ills we have...
{73420}{73528}than rly to others|that we know not of?
{73610}{73668}In the second book|of The Republic,
{73700}{73793}Plato says,|"What will happen to the just man...
{73795}{73884}should he enter this world? '"
{73886}{73957}Well, thejust man|will be scourged,
{73959}{74045}racked, chained.
{74047}{74110}Then after every kind of misery,
{74163}{74263}he will be crucified|on a pole for all to see.
{74313}{74360}Any questions?
{74550}{74599}I've got a question.
{74680}{74731}- Do you mind?|- Sure.
{74801}{74848}My question:
{74850}{74905}If the just man...
{74906}{74958}is treated as you say,
{74997}{75061}then what's the just response?
{75123}{75213}Roll over and let evil|have its wicked way?
{75214}{75282}Well, what would|you recommend, Major?
{75284}{75341}Oh, I'd recommend defiance.
{75343}{75391}Justice for the captors.
{75393}{75449}An eye for an eye.
{75451}{75516}- At what price mercy?|- [Chuckles]
{75573}{75632}Yeah, mercy.
{75634}{75690}The last bastion|of traitors and cowards.
{75746}{75854}So you would take a man|and crucify him on a pole for all to see?
{75910}{75999}- I would seek justice.|- [Book Thuds]
{76072}{76120}Any of you?
{76551}{76599}Sergeant Major?
{77161}{77216}- Heave!|- [Shouting In Japanese]
{77218}{77269}Heave!
{77271}{77319}Heave.!
{77415}{77494}[Gordon Narrating] Major Campbell|was a natural leader amongst men.
{77496}{77570}He seemed to draw them|from all nationalities and groups,
{77572}{77664}- ?? [Ethereal Vocalizing]|- And he had a way with|uniting them in a common cause...
{77666}{77713}his common cause.
{77738}{77798}Better get two more of ours.
{77800}{77855}?? [Continues]
{78105}{78180}[Campbell] The guards change between|5:;00 and half 5:;00 every single day,
{78182}{78249}- so we have to be there, men.|- Sorry, Major.
{78251}{78339}Are we interrupting|a church service?
{78524}{78591}So what's the story?
{78593}{78660}Major, let's say|your plan works, right?
{78706}{78810}You've confiscated the guns,|captured the guards,
{78812}{78868}taken over the whole camp.
{78904}{78961}What then?
{78962}{79036}You have still nowhere to go.
{79060}{79115}And when the Nips find out,
{79142}{79201}we'll have a regiment|a thousand strong...
{79203}{79258}descend on us|with a vengeance.
{79306}{79377}You can't possibly|hope to survive.
{79378}{79449}Who's talkin' about survival?
{79484}{79553}So that's what this is,|a suicide mission.
{79609}{79670}Come here. Come here.
{79672}{79764}So what are you gonna do, eh?|What are you gonna do?
{79766}{79845}You're gonna throw yourself|on the mercy of Bushido?
{79846}{79934}[Chuckles]|Aye, now that would be suicide.
{79936}{80007}Save us the bullshit, Major.
{80044}{80097}What are they payin' ya, Yanker?
{80151}{80211}Huh?
{80213}{80265}Oh, didn't he tell ya?
{80310}{80422}[Laughs]|Some of his best trades are with theJaps.
{80488}{80560}Well, how'd you think|they get such good medicine?
{80589}{80640}Ain't that right, Yanker?
{80642}{80705}You tell them, Yanker, eh?
{80706}{80766}Ha!
{80768}{80861}You are endangering the life|of every man in this camp.
{80862}{80921}I don't think they agree|with your idea of justice.
{80922}{80993}So, what, are you the voice|of the people now, eh?
{81035}{81130}Or you may be just a wee bit tooJap happy|for your own good.
{81298}{81357}Ernie,
{81359}{81425}we Argylls have got|to stick together.
{81477}{81542}And you know that's what|the colonel would say.
{81687}{81743}Good boy.
{81826}{81891}[Miller]|Greater love hath no man than this,
{81926}{82030}that a man lay down|his life for his friends.
{82032}{82096}You have heard that it was said,

{82160}{82225}and hate your enemy.
{82275}{82379}But I say to you,|love your enemy,

{82577}{82633}ifhe gains the whole world,
Fuck me, if he knows where we are.
You said it.
At least he hasn't led us to the enemy.
Guys, we'll wait until the fog lifts.
It's too risky to carry on.
With you, even drinking coffee is risky.
What a guide!
You try to do better in this fog!
Listen to him! He's always happy.
The eternal optimist.
Know the difference between a pessimist and an optimist?
- No, what?
- A pessimist thinks things can't be worse.
An optimist knows they can.
You and your crap jokes.
No one else finds them funny.
If you had any brains at all, you'd give up.
Oh, yeah? If I had any, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be a general or a UN official.
Or I'd open a restaurant.
What's that look for?
It would help my budget if you smoked your own.
- Since you're offering...
- Who the fuck am I? Mother Teresa?
Are you crazy?
You want them to see us?
Who's going to see us?
I can't even see my feet.
Put those cigarettes out! Put them out!
Hair in place?
He's something else!
First time at the front and he dozes off before we get there.
Kids these days...
What?
- Any idea where we are?
- I reckon we should be there by now.
Dawn will soon be here and it'll be easier.
I never took a relief squad to the front at night before.
We got lucky...
Look!
Look!
Shit...
Run!
SERBIAN LINES
You think they were trying to take back the trench?
No, I don't think so.
- I think a relief squad got lost.
- Check it!
Yes, sir!
BOSNIAN LINES
What happened?
Our relief squad got lost in the fog.
- Are there any survivors?
- Shit!
I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.
- Lf there's any change?
- Yes, if the dead start walking.
I need two volunteers to inspect the middle trench.
You, the new guy. Go with him.
Him? He doesn't even know how to load a gun.
Perfect. You can teach him.
Shit.
Cera!
You don't need this.
Nor this, nor this, nor this.
My name's Nino.
Here.
If you notice anything, come straight back.
What's wrong?
- You scared?
- No.
They've got the sun in their eyes, they can't see you.
If there's trouble, wait until dark to come back.
Fucking hell.
Follow me, do what I do and don't try to be clever.
Good luck.
Don't touch anything.
It might be booby-trapped.
Make a fucking effort...
Stop here.
What are you doing?
Seeing as we have time, let's have a little fun.
Look at it: "Made in EU."
My little baby.
What do you think it is?
- A mine.
- A bouncing mine!
When the enemy steps on it...
...what happens, according to you?
- It explodes.
- No, nothing happens.
But when the enemy steps off it, it bounces up...
...and explodes about three feet off the ground...
...spraying out 2,000 lead bearings...
...that destroy everything in a radius of 50 yards.
I'll show you.
Move this son of a bitch.
Gently.
Careful with the pin.
Lay the body down slowly, otherwise you get blown up.
Go on, tug the wire now.
Me? Why me?
Go on, don't worry, as long as there's a weight...
Do it gently, that's all.
I can't.
Chicken!
See that?
I invented this.
When they pick up the body the mine will blow them all to hell.
- What's your name again?
- Nino.
You'll set the next one.
He looks asleep.
That's because he's still fresh.
It won't last in this heat.
Try to sleep. We'll leave once it's dark.
Afterwards, we'll set more of these babies.
Where's that gun?
What gun?
Where does this trench lead?
Where does the trench lead?
Where does the trench lead?
Outside.
- Really? Where, outside?
- Into the field.
Is it mined?
Where does the other one lead?
- I don't know.
- You don't know anything?
Fuck...
Don't touch that! Get back!
- How did you get here?
- We crawled.
Across the field? You're lying!
I'm not. Your side was blinded by the sun.
- And the mines?
- I don't know. He knew.
Where's the map?
- What map?
- Of Bolivia, stupid. Of the mines!
- Empty your pockets.
- Why?
Because I have a gun and you don't.
Come on.
Is that all?
Strip.
- What?
- Strip.
Why?
Are you stupid, or what?
Because I have a gun and you don't.
You may not have noticed, but I'm in charge here.
I'm starving.
You're always starving.
- What's up?
- You have to see this.
What now?
- What the hell's that?
- Is he ours?
It's not written on his boxers.
Call the officer.
- What do I tell him?
- That the dead are walking.
Okay. Get down here.
You hear me? Come down.
He wasn't ours?
I've no idea. I only saw him for a second.
What a hawk-eye.
Let's not take any risks.
Hello. Put me through to the artillery.
- I can't see anything.
- He saw him, too.
- One of ours?
- God knows. He only had boxer shorts on.
Any other brilliant ideas?
If you piss me off, you go back out there.
They've stopped.
Sure. Yours never stop.
How about yours? Do they ever stop?
You can't compare.
We didn't start the war.
And maybe we did?
No! The Khmer Rouge!
All you can do is make war.
- Us?
- No, you're pacifists.
The Great Serbia, all the way to the Pacific!
Please. The whole world thinks like me.
What world? Your world!
You show our burned villages and say they're yours.
And that's my side shooting now?
You're all saints. Give it a rest.
You don't even leave the dead in peace.
It's not the same.
Really? Laying mines under the dead, pillaging, killing, raping, what's all that?
- Who are you talking about?
- You guys!
I haven't seen anything like what you say.
I've seen it! I saw my village burn.
- I don't know. I wasn't there.
- I was!
Haven't our villages burned, too?
Who killed our people?
Your side, probably.
They just shot at you, too.
They only shot at me because they didn't recognize me.
It's useless talking to you.
What the hell made you ruin this beautiful country?
- Us?
- Yes!
You're crazy.
You wanted to separate, not us.
Because you started the war!
- You started it!
- What? Who started it?
You started the war! You started it!
Who started the war?
- We did.
- You started the war.
And stop pissing me off.
You're getting on my nerves.
Get out! Come on, get out of here!
Fuck.
Daring to say it was us.
What was all that?
I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.
- What now?
- Nothing. We wait till dark.
And then?
Then, if you survive, we'll crawl over to the lines.
And stop bothering me.
- So you're not going to free me.
- Dream on.
Cera, you're alive!
Don't move!
Don't move!
There's a mine under you.
It could explode.
- What mine?
- A bounding one. Don't move.
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?
Come here. Defuse it.
- You hear me? Defuse it!
- I don't know how.
Don't fool around. Defuse it!
I'm going to kill you! Defuse it!
If I try, I'll kill us all.
Fuck. What is this shit?
Ciki, what's happening?
They laid a mine under you to ambush our guys.
Only they could think of that!
Kill him.
Kill the son of a bitch.
Kill him or give me the gun!
No.
We're not like them.
Besides, he could be useful.
Bring the water over.
I can't give you too much.
I don't know where you're wounded.
Where does it hurt?
My head and my arm.
My head's going to burst.
That's because of the detonation.
I'm the same. Hold on.
What about the others?
Don't let me die here.
Don't worry. Does it hurt anywhere else?
No.
You lucky bastard.
You're unharmed. Just your arm.
And I thought you were dead.
Can I...
Throw the gun down.
Don't make me shoot. Throw it down!
Get up.
Back off.
Back off!
See what you've done! Get back!
What now?
Now, we wait for dark.
I have to dress his wound.
Okay, but nice and easy.
If you fuck about...
...l'll shoot without warning, you hear me?
Let me see your hands!
I told you to kill him.
Shut up.
What are you saying?
Throw the knife away.
Throw the knife away!
Back off.
Give me those.
Can I have one?
Why?
Because I have a gun and you don't.
- Sit down.
- We have to help him.
Sit down!
By the way, who started the war?
Who started the war?
We did.
- You started the war.
- Who cares who started it?
We're all in the same shit now.
Can I have a cigarette?
What are you doing?
- Don't move.
- Hold on!
- Put the gun down.
- Calm down!
- Put it down!
- Lf I do, he'll kill me!
- Lf you don't, we're fucked.
- No!
I won't kill you, I promise.
- No.
- Put the gun down.
Calm down. Gently. Wait!
Okay...
Okay, he takes the gun, but I keep mine.
Ciki, take the gun.
Slowly.
Okay.
Put it on your shoulder.
Put it on your shoulder!
Okay.
Don't move.
Put yours on your shoulder, too!
There, we're equal now.
Here, for your head.
Cut it out. Calm down.
I'm fucking sick of this.
What now?
I have an idea.
So do I. First, give me the cigarettes.
What is it?
- What's wrong?
- Fuck!
What a mess in Rwanda.
You're really nuts.
I don't believe it.
- What is it?
- There's two of them now.
- What are they yelling about?
- Call the officer.
Unbelievable.
It's this morning's greenhorn.
Call the UNPROFOR for me.
I've never seen anything like it.
We ought to call the UNPROFOR.
I'll alert HQ.
I hope those aren't my cigarettes.
When I took them,
I didn't think you'd need them.
But now I hope...
...that you'll die of cancer.
Okay?
You know what?
Maybe you shouldn't smoke today.
Everything okay?
You haven't told me your name.
My name's Nino.
What's your problem?
You want what? An introduction?
To exchange phone numbers and visiting cards?
We don't need an introduction.
Next time we see each other, it'll be through a gun's sight.
What's wrong with him?
Keep an eye on him.
It's for you.
Call Arizona 2.
Charlie Tango to Arizona 2, over.
Do you copy? Over.
Arizona 2. I copy. Over.
I have your report.
Are they civilians or military?
We do not have that information.
Request permission to check.
Negative/ We must be sure of the Sira-Bravo cease-fire, okay?
Affirmative. Over.
Do you know how many need to be evacuated?
Negative. Over.
Arizona 2, stay where you are.
I'll talk to my superiors.
Message received. Over and out.
- Why the fuck are we here?
- Good question.
I reckon it's simple:
To stop the locals killing each other.
Except we can't use force or get into dangerous situations.
I'm sick of just watching.
Right, let's go.
- Georges, stay here.
- We can't leave like this.
Stay if you want and figure out why you're here.
Don't fall asleep, you might move.
How can I fall asleep...
...with this shit under me?
Fuck, why is this happening to me?
We'll find a solution.
Try to think of something else.
Ciki...
Don't let me die here.
Listen, I'm staying here with you.
If you die, I die too.
What a comfort!
Come on.
I'll check what's happening.
SERBIAN BARRICADE
Hello.
- Do you speak French?
- French? No.
- English?
- Yes.
- We came for people.
- Yes.
- People, you know?
- Yes.
People between lines.
- Where are they?
- Yes.
Okay, you understand nothing of what I've said.
Yes.
You speak English?
No.
French?
We are here for people between lines.
- What's he saying?
- God knows, just say yes, yes.
Does anyone here know languages?
We are here, this place.
Where are the men?
Here? Here people?
Soldiers?
- Any mine?
- No mine.
- You sure?
- No mine.
We go now.
Okay? We go, you don't shoot.
Shoot, no. Nobody shoots.
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.
Tell HQ the UNPROFOR is here.
I don't want anybody shooting.
Is that clear?
- Sorry about earlier.
- You were right.
Why get acquainted to watch each other through sights?
- In any case, thanks for the idea.
- Let's hope it works.
What's going on? Think they understood?
- How is he?
- How do you expect him to be?
- Have you known him long?
- Since the war.
Since the beginning of this fucking war.
What about you and the old man?
I don't even know his name.
You're from Banja Luka.
How do you know? Yeah, right.
I had a chick in Banja Luka. Sanja.
I knew a Sanja, too.
- She had...
- This one, too.
- Blonde.
- Yes.
- Tall.
- Yes.
With a beauty spot.
- Sanja Cengic!
- I was at school with her.
- No kidding?
- I swear.
- Cera!
- Yeah.
He knows the Sanja I mentioned!
Brilliant.
What's become of her?
She's gone abroad.
I don't blame her.
BOSNIAN BARRICADE
- Hello. Do you speak French?
- No, English.
- Okay, we are here for people...
- Yes, we called. You can go.
- It's okay? We go?
- Go.
- Any mines there?
- We didn't put any.
Okay. Go ahead.
- Sarajevo on line.
- Hello, Col. Soft speaking.
- Hello, sir. This is Capt. Dubois.
- How can I help you?
It's the first time that the two camps are asking me for the same thing...
... and I don't know what to do.
Why are you asking me and not your superiors?
They are all in Geneva for a seminar on media relations.
It seems from your report that these men...
...are stranded between the two front lines.
But we don't even know if they are soldiers or not. Is that right?
What do you expect me to do?
I can't risk the lives of our soldiers in order to save theirs.
Do I have to remind you of the precise purpose of our mission here in Bosnia?
Since it is the first time that the two camps are...
You know perfectly well that there is nothing that I can do...
...without the approval of the General
Assembly of the United Nations.
I don't think the General Assembly will convene itself...
...specifically to deal with the problems of two unknown individuals...
...trapped in no man's land.
There is nothing I can do.
I don't have the authority.
What should I tell them, sir?
Tell them that, as usual, neither side can agree.
Tell them anything you like. Good-bye.
Is someone coming?
Probably. See, they've stopped shooting.
Fuck.
I don't even know what this shithole's called.
- I'd hate to die here.
- Stop being a pain in the ass.
They'll get a mine expert and it'll soon be over.
I told you, we'll leave together.
Here come the Smurfs! Cera!
The Smurfs!
If they radio us, call me immediately.
What if something happens to you?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Do you speak French?
- No.
- English?
- A little.
One's a Serb and one's Bosnian.
How did they get here?
- Do we take the dead guys' guns?
- No, it's okay.
- You're okay?
- Yes, okay.
We come to help you. My name is Neil.
He needs help.
- Is he wounded?
- Yes.
We must not move him. Mines.
We move him, mine explode.
- He's on a mine that could blow.
- Thanks for the translation.
What the fuck happened here?
- Okay, don't worry.
- Yes, but...
Stop!
Oh, shit.
A bouncing mine. These guys are crazy.
What a fuck-up. We need the mine squad.
Sarge! Charlie Tango calling.
Okay, I'll come back in two minutes.
Michel, give them water and food.
What did he say?
Arizona 2 to Charlie Tango, come in.
Arizona 2, we have orders not to move.
Things are too risky.
We're already on the spot.
Everything's under control.
Both sides are respecting the cease-fire.
We have three evacuees and need a mine expert.
Who's speaking?
Sgt. Marchand.
You have 5 minutes to pull out...
... and 15 to call me from the checkpoint.
And report to the duty officer on your return/
Sir, could you send a mine squad?
We have an emergency here.
The only emergency is to pull out.
I repeat, for the last time,
I want you out in 5 minutes...
... and call me in 15 to confirm...
... that you're back and that your men are safe.
Or I'll have you arrested.
I'll be expecting your call.
Idiot!
Get back in.
What for?
We must leave.
- What?
- They're leaving.
- You'll come back?
- I don't know, my boss said we must leave.
I'm sorry. I'll try to come back.
Thank God we can count on you.
If you want, I take you with me.
- What?
- We can go with him.
Really? Thank him nicely and tell him he can fuck off!
- Ciki, go.
- Shut up.
Go and bring back help.
Wait!
I'll come with you.
- Where are you going?
- With them.
- You're going nowhere!
- Why?
This is all your fault.
If you stay, your side won't shoot.
- They won't shoot, I swear.
- You're staying here.
You're going to shoot me? Go ahead!
Stop fooling around!
No!
Stop, guys!
Okay! Cool! Stop!
Lower your weapons!
Michel, get in!
What happened?
- What a fuck-up.
- They're maniacs!
Shut it!
- I knew this would be shitty.
- Shut it!
- You're crazy, you maniac!
- I warned you.
I'll kill you for this! I swear!
I've fucking had it with you.
Keep cool just a while longer. Screw them.
It'll be dark soon and I'll think of something.
How does this shit work?
I'm sick of asking you!
Fuck knows!
It explodes when you take the weight away.
Here we are at a Bosnian barricade near the town of Tuzla...
...talking to the Bosnian Commander.
How do you feel about the talks in Geneva?
I'd like to go there.
Would you go with me?
Are you resentful that people are talking while you are suffering?
What happened?
It's very confused.
We go now and bring some help.
- Why don't you tell them the truth?
- Who are you?
I am Jane Livingston,
Global News Channel...
...and this is Sgt. Marchand, otherwise known as Arizona 2.
Stop the engine.
- How do you know that?
- We were listening to your radio frequency.
Since we were in the area, we thought we'd come and verify.
- You listened to our radio?
- Absolutely.
It's the best way to get fresh information.
Are you going back?
Why do you need a bomb disposal unit?
Stop the camera.
- Can you take us there?
- No, I have to go.
That's right.
You're just here to distribute humanitarian aid.
Okay, we'll go without you.
Come on, let's go.
You can't. It's too dangerous.
Is that an order?
Okay, stop filming, please.
Please?
Yes, all right.
Maybe I can help you if you'll help me.
We have an English TV crew here.
They know everything.
Other crews are on the way.
They picked up our frequency.
I didn't answer their questions.
Hello, Captain.
This is Jane Livingston of Global News.
I can hear everything you're saying.
Are we to assume that the UNPROFOR are doing absolutely nothing...
...for those who are wounded and trapped between the two fronts?
Who made this decision?
Are headquarters aware of the situation?
You know very well that you have no right to listen or to use this frequency.
Get off it immediately or we'll confiscate your press card. Over.
Is that a threat?
Listen, Miss Livingston,
I was not in any way threatening you.
Please, try to understand.
We are doing what we can.
At this moment we are in negotiations with both camps to arrange a ceasefire.
As you know, the situation is extremely complicated and takes time.
That's a lie.
Can you tell me where these negotiations are and who's in charge?
I have my second unit on hand here who could cover it immediately.
I have no more information for the moment.
You're telling me that negotiations are taking place...
...but you don't know where they are or who's in charge.
At the same time...
...you've requested that your soldiers who were on the scene return to base.
I just carry out orders.
Who issues these orders?
Can I have a name?
I cannot disclose military affairs.
First of all, I must request authorization from my superiors.
Fine, go ahead.
I'll wait right here for your answer.
I'm preparing a news report which goes off in half an hour...
...and it will be fascinating to monitor the response...
...of millions of our viewers who will watch the show.
Thank you, Captain.
Arizona 2, are you still there?
Affirmative, Charlie Tango.
Stay there until further orders.
Over and out.
Message received, sir.
- Could l...
- No, please, not now.
Why are you doing this?
I'm sick of being a bystander.
- What would you do?
- What I'd do?
I'd stop the madmen ruining this country.
We have what it takes.
Aren't you neutral?
You can't be neutral facing murder.
Doing nothing to stop it is taking sides.
Magnificent. Will you say that on camera?
I may be mad, but I'm not stupid.
- Jane.
- Yeah, I'm coming.
I'll be right back.
- What's wrong?
- My leg's itching.
Wait.
You want to blow us away?
I'll scratch you.
Lower.
Again. To the left.
There. That's good.
I need the toilet.
Piss in your pants.
It's the other.
It's okay.
Easy for you to say.
Here at the Bosnian barricade...
...we do not know if this is yet another mission impossible...
...or if, indeed, they will actually decide to do something.
Thank you, Jane.
Let's take a look at the history of UN involvement in the Bosnian conflict.
Martha, get me Capt. Dubois, please.
He just called, but I told him that you were out.
Call him back and tell him I'm here.
You're pushing Bosnia-Herzegovina...
... to follow the same path of horror and suffering...
... as Slovenia and Croatia.
You'll lead Bosnia into hell and this may end up...
... exterminating the Muslim people/
Radovan Karadzic didn't wait long to carry out his threat.
Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces, largely helped by the Yugoslav army...
... furiously attacked Bosnian cities...
... that were defended only by armed Bosnian civilians...
... and the rest of the police forces loyal to the Bosnian government.
Serbs started massive attacks against civilian targets...
... spreading fear and terror and introducing a new term: Ethnical cleansing.
The world community finally decided to do something...
... after Serb artillery massacred people waiting in lines for bread.
UN Security Council decided to send to Bosnia...
... 9,000 troops supported by the American 6th Fleet.
At the moment when the whole world expected military intervention...
... French President François Mitterrand lands in Sarajevo...
... a city that was already under siege.
Bosnians received him as a savior, but he had different plans.
After meeting with Radovan Karadzic, he opened Sarajevo airport...
... and started wide-scale humanitarian aid action.
UN troops were assigned to protect and follow the UNHCR food convoys...
... without any right to interfere in the conflict.
Today, Bosnians are still denied the right to defend themselves...
... by an imposed UN weapon embargo...
... although, at this very moment, war continues without any signs of pacification.
The tragedy of the Bosnian nation continues...
... and the only help they've got now is 120 grams of humanitarian aid per day.
For those joining us now, we have news from Bosnia...
... where some men are caught in no man's land.
Our correspondent
Jane Livingston is there.
We're waiting to see which measure will be taken by UNPROFOR.
Is there anything you'd like to add, Jane?
Olivia, I would like to repeat the words that I heard here only moments ago.
"Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder.
"Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing.
"It is not being neutral."
Thank you, Jane.
We'll come back to you later.
That was Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.
We'll be back after this.
Martha, gonna need a helicopter and a map of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
How was it? We haven't had an opportunity like that in a very long time.
Yeah.
I know. I just hope it will make them move their asses, you know?
Yeah. That's right.
Okay. I'll call you as soon as we get there.
Shit! We weren't the only ones listening to the UNPROFOR, obviously.
Hi, John.
Okay, guys. We have the go-ahead.
Stay here while we check things.
Come on. That's not what we agreed.
It's too dangerous now.
You can move in with the mine expert.
No! You said that you would take us up...
Fucking French.
Really, I'm sick of it.
Give me the photo in my pocket.
- Which pocket?
- The top one.
This one.
Let me see.
- Why do soldiers always carry photos?
- I've no idea. Let me see.
I can't see like that.
- Think I'll see her again?
- Cut it out, of course you will.
Ciki!
Stop it, for God's sake!
Shit!
You stop!
Watch the knife!
Stop now!
It's over! You stop! Help is coming.
The mining squad is coming.
You understand? You tell him.
The mine squad's coming!
I'll kill you for this!
It's good for you.
Help coming.
I'll get reinforcements.
Keep an eye on them...
...and clean his wound.
Take this. Call me if there's a problem.
- What's happening?
- Okay, you'll be able to film.
Are you sure?
Everything okay? Are you all right?
- Sgt. Marchand.
- Capt. Dubois.
- Captain, can you tell us what's going on?
- Just one moment, please.
- Can we have an interview later?
- I told you, one minute.
- What's going on?
- A hell of a mess, sir.
It's really tense. We just had to intervene.
We're taking no risks.
Any trouble, we pull out, okay?
- What about the reporters?
- We let them film everything.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I'm not stupid, Sgt. Marchand.
Ladies and gentleman, I am Capt. Dubois.
In a few minutes,
I will take you on the site.
I suppose you all have your press cards, helmets and flak jackets.
Sgt. Marchand here is going to brief you now.
We have there a soldier that is laying on a mine. We have to de-mine it.
Nobody can go in the hole.
It's too dangerous.
Don't go around because we don't know if there are any mines.
The situation is extremely complicated and I want your total cooperation.
Whoever will not respect the rules...
...will be thrown out and their press card will be confiscated.
Go now into your cars.
We'll leave in a few minutes.
Please go.
- You never mentioned a man on a mine.
- I didn't?
I forgot. Shall we go?
- We wait for the mine expert.
- He isn't with you?
Ours were busy.
They're sending a German.
He should be here at 3:30. It's 3:30 now.
Bang on the dot.
What?
Capt. Dubois. Do you speak French?
No.
- English, of course.
- Of course.
- You know the situation?
- No, we had no time for a briefing.
We don't have much time, so you follow us, I will explain you.
Over there. Follow us.
At this very moment the UNPROFOR are trying to help the third soldier...
...who is lying on a mine.
The absurdity of war continues, taking on a different guise.
How will all this end?
Stay tuned to Global News.
Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.
Here.
Excuse me...
...can I make interview with you?
Go fuck yourself!
You're the last thing I need.
Fucking Balkanian.
What the fuck are you doing?
- I just thought...
- Don't think.
I'm the one who thinks around here.
Excuse me, would you like a cigarette?
Do you speak a little English?
- Little.
- I can do interview with you?
Roll.
- How do you feel?
- Okay.
- Do you feel tired?
- Yes.
Was it you who put the mine underneath the other soldier?
Fucking bastard. Cut!
I'll kill him, even if it's the last thing I do.
- What's wrong with you?
- I should have killed him.
See that? I spared him and now...
...he's tried to kill me with my own knife!
How do you feel?
Great. Couldn't be better.
First, they shoot at me, then I wake up on a mine...
...the whole world's watching me,
I need to shit...
...and you piss me off with your stupid stories.
It'll soon be over.
- You are okay?
- Yes, I'm ready.
Now, I need everybody out of the place.
We need the safety parameters at least 30 meters.
Okay. I'll do it.
Move everybody out.
Okay, please, now, you must go back.
We will start de-mining.
Michel, let's get going!
You must leave now.
De-miner wants everybody out.
You, out.
Yes, he out, too.
Later, when we finish. Understand?
They'll bring him out later.
If I need a translator, I'll find one.
Let's go.
Calm down!
You cannot stay here, okay?
Tell him if he stays here we will not start working.
It's a question of security.
Say it to your friend.
He's not my friend.
I know, but please,
I have no other translator. Tell him.
- They'll do nothing until we go.
- I don't need a translator!
Go fuck yourself, asshole!
Keep your cool. Just go.
I'll wait for you up there.
Keep an eye on him.
Okay?
You can probably just make out behind me, as I'm speaking to you...
...the Serbian soldier, limping, closely followed by the Bosnian soldier.
These two men, at least, will be walking to their safety.
But they will be leaving behind the third soldier...
...who is still patiently waiting on the mine...
...for the bomb-disposal expert to save his life.
For him, the ordeal is not yet over.
This is Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia...
...for Global News. Stay tuned.
Get lost!
Fuck you!
Asshole! I give him bandages and he refuses them.
They're all maniacs!
- It's John here. Are you still there?
- Yes. Hello?
Okay. Listen, this is really great, but it would be fantastic if you could...
...get the story of the guy on the mine.
I'll try. I mean...
Maybe you could get a close-up of him when they're clearing the mine?
Yeah, I'll try.
Have you interviewed the other two guys yet?
No, unfortunately they won't let me get anywhere near them.
Go get it, Jane. Come on!
As soon as you get it, we'll go live again.
Okay? Good luck.
Thank you.
Don't move.
Fuck, what a job.
They say a mine expert only ever makes one mistake.
- Two mistakes.
- How come?
The first is when he chooses the job.
What is happening?
There's too much stones.
I can't approach the mine.
I don't even see what kind of mine it is.
I know. Wait.
- Is this the mine that is under the body?
- Yeah.
I can do nothing.
- What?
- It's impossible to de-activate...
...this kind of stuff once the mechanism is on.
This man is already dead.
Are you sure? Can't you put something between him and the mine?
Maybe another de-miner knows better.
You can call whoever you want.
Nobody, nothing in the world can de-mine this stuff, not in these conditions.
At least I don't know about it.
Deus ex machina. He's all we needed.
Why are you here? Do you consider it such an important mission?
We consider all our missions to be of the utmost importance.
Our job here is to expedite the peace process in this country.
You didn't want to intervene.
It was your soldiers...
...who were sick and tired of waiting, who initiated the action.
I'm afraid you got the wrong end of the story here.
This is a simple new system of command.
If it's effective, then the unit in the field will have much greater mobility.
What do you have to say about the Americans' accusations...
...that Europe's incapacity to do anything is due to UNPROFOR's internal problems?
I've heard no such accusations.
You must judge for yourself.
The UNPROFOR is perfectly fulfilling its mission. Thank you very much.
What are the relationships between the British and the French?
I think we'll have to deal with that later.
It's far too complicated.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
- How's it going?
- We have a problem, sir.
- What problem?
- One of the soldiers is on a mine.
It's impossible to defuse it.
What?
The mine disposal expert says it is impossible to defuse it.
This whole fucking business stinks to high heaven, as I said from the start.
If the journalists get one whiff of this, they'll crucify us.
Shit.
What did you decide?
What are we going to do?
Get back into the trench.
Pretend to be busy.
- We've got to buy ourselves some time.
- Excuse me to repeat...
Get back into the trench!
That's an order.
Captain, what's happening?
The mine disposal expert has begun his job.
You will be informed as soon as he will be finished.
- I think it's going to take a little while.
- Can we approach?
Unfortunately, for security reasons,
I cannot allow that.
You wanted to kill me with my own knife?
Oh, shit.
Quick! Tom!
Is that how you thank me?
Don't come any closer!
You're all the same!
And you vultures film it?
You get good money?
Does our misery pay well?
No!
- Did you get it?
- Yes.
Captain? Over here, please.
What do you think...
Take it easy.
Listen...
There was no other solution.
Marchand! Put the bodies in the car.
We're going.
- What's happening?
- The mine expert's defused it.
- He has?
- Yes.
Colonel, sir, can we just have a few questions?
Ladies and gentleman, what can I say?
You see the conditions we work under.
Our focus now must be on the remaining soldier.
We hope to be able to save at least one life.
- Can we come closer? Can we film it?
- Eventually.
He's in critical condition and has to be taken to a hospital immediately.
When he's in a fit state to answer your questions, you'll be informed.
The press conference tonight at 22:00 at the Holiday Inn...
...at which time I shall be happy to answer any of your questions.
For the time being, I must ask you please to prepare to leave the field...
...since I can no longer guarantee your safety. Night is beginning to fall.
Please, ladies and gentlemen, prepare to go.
Thank you.
- What's going on?
- We took out the mine expert's gear.
- What about him?
- Lf you have an idea, let me know.
- We can't leave him there!
- You have a solution?
You heard the mine expert.
I hope you understand now.
It's not our business, so we stay out of it.
Everything all right, Captain?
Good work, gentlemen.
I'm very pleased.
I have no doubt that in the fullness of time you'll be duly compensated.
You've got the contact numbers from Dubois?
Call them, will you, and notify them that they're dead.
Then I'd like you to notify each side...
...that we have information that the other side...
...is planning to commandeer the central trench this evening.
Could you call me the liaison of the Bosnians, please? Thank you.
- Well, see you round.
- See you.
I wanted to thank you.
- You got your report.
- Yes.
Are you okay?
- Ready to go?
- Sorry?
- Are you ready to go?
- Yes.
Let's not hang around, let's go.
- I hope we meet again.
- I hope so.
Remember the press conference tonight,
Yes.
I know what you're thinking, Sergeant.
It wouldn't make any difference, you know.
It wouldn't change anything.
Off you go.
Are you sure you don't want me to film the trench?
No. A trench is a trench.
They're all the same.

By 300 AD, the Roman Empire[br]extended from Arabia to Britain.
But they wanted more.
More land.
More peoples[br]loyal and subservient to Rome.
But no people so important[br]as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.
Thousands died on that field.
And when the smoke cleared on the fourth[br]day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive were members of the decimated[br]but legendary cavalry.
The Romans, impressed by their bravery[br]and horsemanship, spared their lives. ln exchange, these warriors were[br]incorporated into the Roman military.
Better they had died that day.
Father.
They are here.
For the second part of the bargain they[br]struck indebted not only themselves...
The day has come.
..but also their sons,[br]and their sons, and so on, to serve the empire as knights. l was such a son.
There is a legend that[br]fallen knights return as great horses.
He has seen what awaits you,[br]and he will protect you.
Lancelot! Lancelot!
Lancelot.
Don't be afraid. l will return.
- How long shall we be gone?[br]- 1 5 years, not including the months it'll take[br]to get to your post.
Lancelot!
Rus!
Our post was Britain -[br]or at least the southern half, for the land was divided by a 73-mile wall[br]built three centuries before us to protect the empire from[br]the native fighters of the north.
So, as our forefathers had done, we made our way and reported[br]to our Roman commander in Britain, ancestrally named for the first Artorius, or Arthur.
Mother, l finished.
That's beautiful.
Mother...
Pelagius. For you.
Well done, Artorius.
You keep it.
Deliver it to me[br]when you come to Rome.
Come.
Behold, Arthur. Young knights. lf you so choose, they may some day[br]be yours to lead, as your father before you.
- l'm to be their commander?[br]- Yes.
But with this title comes a sacred[br]responsibility to protect, to defend, to value their lives above your own[br]and, should they perish in battle, to live your life gloriously[br]in honour of their memory.
And what of their free will? lt has always fallen to a few[br]to sacrifice for the good of many.
The world isn't a perfect place, but perhaps people like you, Arthur,[br]and me and them can make it so.
Ah, as promised, the bishop's carriage.
- Our freedom, Bors.[br]- Mm. l can almost taste it.
And your passage to Rome, Arthur.
Woads!
Rus!
Rus!
Rus.
Gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta[br]tu in mulieribus et Dominus tecum.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.[br]Benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus...
Save your prayers, boy.[br]Your god doesn't live here.
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
- Bors.[br]- What a bloody mess.
That's not the bishop.
God help us.
- What are they?[br]- Blue demons that eat Christians alive.
You're not a Christian, are you?
Does this really work?
Nothing.
Maybe l'm not doin' it right.
Stand down.
Arthur!
Arthur Castus. Your father's image. l haven't seen you since childhood.
Bishop Germanius. Welcome to Britain. l see your military skills[br]are still of use to you.
Your device worked.
Ancient tricks of an ancient dog.
And these are the great Sarmatian knights[br]we have heard so much of in Rome. l thought the Woads control[br]the north of Hadrian's Wall.
They do, but they[br]occasionally venture south.
Rome's anticipated withdrawal from Britain[br]has only increased their daring.
- Woads?[br]- British rebels who hate Rome.
Men who want their country back.
- Who leads them?[br]- He's called Merlin.
A dark magician, some say.
Tristan, ride ahead[br]and make sure the road is clear.
Please do not worry, Bishop.[br]We will protect you.
Oh. l've no doubt, Commander.
No doubt.
Dozens don't worry me[br]nearly so much as thousands.
Thousands? l don't like him, that Roman. lf he's here to discharge us,[br]why doesn't he just give us our papers? ls this your happy face?
Galahad, do you still[br]not know the Romans?
They won't scratch their asses[br]without holding a ceremony.
Why don't you just kill him,[br]and then discharge yourself after? l don't kill for pleasure, unlike some.
Well, you should try it someday.[br]You might get a taste for it.
- lt's a part of you. lt's in your blood.[br]- No, no, no. No.
As of tomorrow[br]this was all just a bad memory.
Ohh. l've often thought about what going home[br]would mean after all this. What will l do? lt's different for Galahad. l've been in this life longer than the other.
So much for home.[br]lt's not so clear in my memory.
You speak for yourself. lt's cold back there[br]and everyone l know is dead and buried.
Besides, l have, l think, a dozen children.
Eleven.
You listen. When the Romans leave here,[br]we'll have the run of all this place. l'll be governor in my own village[br]and Dagonet will be my personal guard and royal ass-kisser. Won't you, Dag?
First thing l will do when l get home is[br]find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.
A beautiful Sarmatian woman?
Why do you think we left in the first place?
What about you, Lancelot?[br]What are your plans for home?
Well, if this woman of Gawain's[br]is as beautiful as he claims, l expect to be spending[br]a lot of time at Gawain's house.
- His wife will welcome the company.[br]- l see. And what will l be doing?
Wondering at your good fortune[br]that all your children look like me. ls that before or after l hit you with my ax?
Where you been, now? Where you been?
And what will you do, Arthur,[br]when you return to your beloved Rome?
Give thanks to God that l survived to see it.
You and your god! You disturb me. l want peace, Lancelot. l've had enough.
- You should visit me.[br]- Ah! lt's a magnificent place, Rome.
Ordered, civilized, advanced.
A breeding ground of arrogant fools.
The greatest minds in all the lands[br]have come together in one sacred place to help make mankind free.
And the women?
Open the gate!
- Welcome back, Arthur.[br]- Jols.
Lancelot.
Bishop, please, my quarters[br]have been made available to you.
Oh, yes. l must rest.
- Where have you been?[br]- Oh...
- l've been waiting for you.[br]- Oh, my little flower. Such... passion!
Where's my Gilly? Gilly.
- You been fighting?[br]- Yes.
- You been winning?[br]- Yes.
That's my boy.[br]Come on, all my other bastards!
Let us not forget that[br]we are the fortunate ones.
Let us raise our wine to those gallant[br]and extraordinary men we have lost, but who will be remembered for eternity.
To freedom.
Pelagius.
Very kind of Arthur to give up his room.
But, of course, it is to be expected.
Sir, l'm here to escort you[br]to the fortress hall.
When my master meets with your knights,[br]he must be seated last and he must be seated[br]at the head of the table.
Your master can plonk his holy ass[br]wherever he chooses.
His Eminence, Bishop Naius Germanius.
A round table?[br]What sort of evil is this?
Arthur says for men to be men[br]they must first all be equal. l was given to understand[br]there would be more of you.
There were. We have been[br]fighting here for 1 5 years, Bishop.
Oh, of course.
Arthur and his knights[br]have served with courage to maintain the honor of Rome's empire[br]on this last outpost of our glory.
Rome is most indebted[br]to you noble knights.
To your final days[br]as servants to the empire.
Day. Not days.
The Pope's taken[br]a personal interest in you.
He inquires after each of you, and is curious to know if your knights have[br]converted to the word of Our Savior or...?
They retain the religion of their forefathers.[br]l have never questioned that.
Of course, of course.
They are pagans. Hm?
For our part, the Church[br]has deemed such beliefs innocence, but you, Arthur,[br]your path to God is through Pelagius?
- l saw his image in your room.[br]- He took my father's place for me.
His teachings on free will and equality[br]have been a great influence. l look forward to our reunion in Rome.
Ah.
Rome awaits your arrival[br]with great anticipation.
You are a hero. ln Rome, you will live out your days[br]in honor and wealth.
Alas...
Alas, we are all but players[br]in an ever-changing world.
Barbarians from every corner[br]are almost at Rome's door.
Because of this, Rome and the Holy Father[br]have decided to remove ourselves from indefensible outposts,[br]such as Britain.
What will become of Britain[br]is not our concern anymore. l suppose the Saxons will claim it soon.
- Saxons?[br]- Yes. ln the north a massive[br]Saxon incursion has begun.
- The Saxons only claim what they kill.[br]- And only kill everything.
So you would just[br]leave the land to the Woads.
And l risked my life for nothing.
Hm.
Gentlemen, your discharge papers with safe conduct[br]throughout the Roman Empire.
But first, l must have a word[br]with your commander.
- ln private.[br]- We have no secrets.
Come. Let's leave Roman business[br]to Romans.
Let it go, Bors.
Rome has issued a final order[br]for you and your men.
Final order?
You are to travel north[br]to rescue the family of Marius Honorius and return, in particular,[br]with Marius's son, Alecto.
Alecto is the Pope's[br]favorite godchild and pupil. lt is his destiny to become a bishop,[br]perhaps even pope one day.
On this day you ask this of my men.
On this day.
They have risked their lives for 1 5 years[br]for a cause not of their own.
And now, on the day they are to be[br]liberated, you send them on a mission which is far more dangerous[br]than any other they have undertaken.
You tell me, Bishop,[br]how do l go to my men and tell them that instead of freedom l offer death? lf your men are truly the knights[br]of legend, perhaps some will survive. lf it is God's will.
Your men want to go home, and to get home they need to cross[br]the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.
Will you defy the Pope, Arthur?
Rome? God himself?
Everything l've done has been[br]for the Church and for Rome.
Do not mistake a loyal soldier[br]for a fool, Germanius.
Would you leave a defenseless[br]Roman boy, destined to lead our Church, at the hands of the Saxons?
Fulfill this mission, and your men[br]will receive their discharge.
Their papers will be waiting here[br]the moment they return.
You have my word.
You think very hard upon that vow, Bishop,[br]for l will hold you to it.
Break it, and no Roman legion, papal army, nor God himself will protect you.
That is my word.
- She gave me fleas.[br]- You better hope they're fleas.
Best of three.
Who wants another drink?
When you gonna leave Bors[br]and come home with me?
My lover is watching you.
You look nothing like him.
You're all Bors.
- Tristan...[br]- How do you do that? l aim for the middle.
Oh, they want more!
- Here. Be a mother to your son.[br]- Oh, come here.
Dagonet, where you been?[br]We've got plans to make.
Here, please. Sing.
- No.[br]- Just a last one.
- No, l'm trying to work.[br]- Come sing. Shut up!
Vanora will sing.
- No, no.[br]- Sing! Sing!
- Sing about home.[br]- Don't drop the baby.
Land of bear and land of eagle
Land that gave us birth and blessing
Land that called us ever homewards
We will go home across the mountains
We will go home[br]We will go home
We will go home across the mountains
We will go home singing our song...
..hear our singing, hear our longing
We will go home across the mountains
We will go home[br]We will go home...
Arthur!
Arthur!
Arthur! You're not[br]completely Roman yet, right?
Rus!
Knights... brothers in arms... your courage has been tested[br]beyond all limits.
Yes.
But l must ask you now for one further trial.
Drink.
We must leave on a final mission for Rome[br]before our freedom can be granted.
Above the wall, far in the north,[br]there is a Roman family in need of rescue.
They are trapped by Saxons.
Our orders are to secure their safety.
Let the Romans take care of their own.
Above the wall is Woad territory.
Our duty to Rome,[br]if it was ever a duty, is done.
Our pact with Rome is done.
Every knight here[br]has laid his life on the line for you.
For you.
And instead of freedom[br]you want more blood?
Our blood?
You think more of Roman blood[br]than you do of ours?
Bors! These are our orders.
We leave at first light, and when we return[br]your freedom will be waiting for you.
A freedom we can embrace with honor. l am a free man! l will choose my own fate!
Yeah, yeah.[br]We're all going to die someday. lf it's a death from a Saxon hand[br]that frightens you, stay home.
Listen, if you're so eager to die,[br]you can die right now!
- Enough. Enough![br]- l've got something to live for!
The Romans have broken their word.
We have the word of Arthur.[br]That is good enough. l'll prepare.
Bors?
- You coming?[br]- Of course l'm coming!
Can't let you go on your own![br]You'll all get killed! l'm just saying what you're all thinking!
Vanora'll kill me.
And you, Gawain? l'm with you.
Galahad as well.
O merciful God,[br]l have such need of your mercy now.
Not for myself, but for my knights, for this is truly their hour of need.
Deliver them from the trials ahead, and l will repay you a thousandfold[br]with any sacrifice you ask of me.
And if, in your wisdom, you should determine that that sacrifice[br]must be my life for theirs, so they may once again taste the freedom[br]that has so long been denied to them, l will gladly make that covenant.
My death will have a purpose.[br]l ask no more than that.
Why do you always talk to God[br]and not to me?
Oh, pray to whomever you pray[br]that we don't cross the Saxons.
My faith is what protects me, Lancelot.[br]Why do you challenge this? l don't like anything[br]that puts a man on his knees.
No man fears to kneel[br]before the god he trusts.
Without faith, without belief in something,[br]what are we?
To try and get past the Woads[br]in the north is insanity.
- Them we've fought before.[br]- Not north of the wall!
How many Saxons? Hm?
How many?
Tell me. Do you believe in this mission?
These people need our help.
- lt is our duty to bring them out.[br]- l don't care about your charge, and l don't give a damn about[br]Romans, Britain or this island. lf you desire to spend eternity in this place,[br]Arthur, so be it, but suicide cannot be chosen for another!
- And yet you choose death for this family![br]- No, l choose life!
And freedom for myself and the men!
How many times in battle have we[br]snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?
Outnumbered, outflanked,[br]yet still we triumph.
With you at my side, we can do so again.
Lancelot, we are knights.
What other purpose do we serve[br]if not for such a cause?
Arthur, you fight for a world[br]that will never exist.
Never.
There will always be a battlefield. l will die in battle.
Of that l'm certain.
And hopefully a battle of my choosing.
But if it be this one, grant me a favor.
Don't bury me in our sad little cemetery.
Burn me.
Burn me and cast my ashes[br]to a strong east wind.
Don't touch their women.
We don't mix with these people.
What kind of offspring[br]do you think that would yield?
Weak people.
Half people. l will not have our Saxon blood[br]watered down by mixing with them.
According to our laws, no man[br]may deny me the spoils of our conquest!
He speaks the truth, Father.
My lord! O, my lord!
God's thanks, my lord.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Kill her.
No! No!
Are you challenging me? lf you want to challenge me,[br]you have to have a sword in your hand.
As long as my heart beats,[br]l rule and you hold your tongue.
Or l'll cut it out.
To represent the holy court,[br]my trusted secretary, Horton...
Horton?
..will accompany you on your quest.
Jols, find him a horse.
This way.
Godspeed,[br]as you fulfill your duty to Rome.
My duty is also to my men.
Then get them home.
We are three days' march from[br]the Great Wall, if we camp at night.
We won't camp.
The wall - what troops are stationed there?
Light Roman infantry and possibly Sarmatian knights.
Arthur Castus is their leader.
Arthur? Who is this Arthur? lt is said he has never been defeated[br]in battle. lt is said he is a great warrior.
Why should l trust you?
You're a traitor to your own people.
Tell my father of the Roman estate.
Speak up!
A very high-ranking family live there.
They are of great importance to Rome.
Father, their ransom[br]could pay for the entire campaign. l'll attack from the north[br]with the main army.
You bring your men down here.[br]Cut off their retreat to the south.
Burn every village, kill everybody.
Never leave behind you a man, woman[br]or child who can ever carry a sword.
Woads. They're tracking us.
Where?
Everywhere.
Get back!
Get back!
This way!
What are you waiting for? lnish.
Devil ghosts.
- Why would they not attack?[br]- Merlin doesn't want us dead.
- Who are you?[br]- l am Arthur Castus,
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights,[br]sent by Bishop Germanius of Rome.
Open the gate. lt is a wonder you have come.
Good Jesus.[br]Arthur and his knights.
You have fought the Woads.[br]Vile creatures.
Our orders are to evacuate you[br]immediately.
But that... that is impossible.
- Which is Alecto?[br]- l am Alecto.
Alecto is my son.
And everything we have is here in the land[br]given to us by the Pope of Rome.
- Well, you're about to give it to the Saxons.[br]- They're invading from the north.
- Then Rome will send an army.[br]- They have. Us.
- We leave as soon as you're packed.[br]- l refuse to leave.
Go back to work! All of you!
- You heard! Go![br]- All right, all right.
- Go![br]- Get back to work, all of you!
Go back! lf l fail to bring you and your son back,[br]my men can never leave this land.
So you're coming with me if l have to tie you to my horse and drag[br]you all the way to Hadrian's Wall myself.
My lord.
Lady, my knights are hungry.
Go.
Come!
Come. Let us go, hm?
Sir, you're famous.[br]You're Arthur, aren't you? l'm Ganis. l'm a good fighter and l'm smart.[br]l'd serve you proudly.
Are you from Rome?
From hell.
- Sir.[br]- Who is this man?
He's our village elder.
What is this punishment for?
- Answer me![br]- He defied our master, Marius.
Most of the food we grow[br]is sent out by sea to be sold.
He asked that we keep[br]a little more for ourselves, that's all.
My ass has been snappin' at the grass[br]l'm so hungry!
You're from Rome. ls it true[br]that Marius is a spokesman for God and that it's a sin to defy him? l tell you now.
Marius is not of God.
And you, all of you,[br]were free from your first breath!
Help this man.
Help him!
Now hear me. A vast and terrible army[br]is coming this way.
They will show no mercy, spare no one.
Those of you who are able[br]should gather your things and begin to move south[br]towards Hadrian's Wall.
Those unable shall come with us.
You, serve me now.[br]Get these people ready.
Right, you heard him.
You go grab enough food and water[br]for the journey.
Let's get a hurry on, else we're all dead!
Come on, hurry.
They have flanked us to the east.
They're coming from the south,[br]trying to cut off our escape.
They'll be here before nightfall.
- How many?[br]- An entire army.
And the only way out is to the south?
East.
There is a trail heading east[br]across the mountains.
It means we have to cross behind Saxon[br]Iines, but that's the one we shouId take.
Arthur, who are all these peopIe?
They're coming with us.
Then we'll never make it.
- Come on, get back to work![br]- Back to work!
Move.
Move.
Move!
- What is this?[br]- You cannot go in there.
No one goes in there.[br]This pIace is forbidden.
What are you doing?[br]Stop this!
Arthur, we have no time.
Do you not hear the drums?
Dagonet.
- Key.[br]- It is Iocked.
From the inside.
You, you... go.
Move!
- Gawain.[br]- Exaudi orationem meam.
Exaudi orationem meam.
In nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis[br]et in virtute Spiritus Sancti.
Who are these defiIers[br]of the Lord's tempIe?
Out of the way.
The work of your god.
Is this how he answers your prayers?
See if there's any still aIive.
How dare you set foot in this hoIy pIace?
- There was a man of God.[br]- Not my god!
- This one's dead.[br]- By this smell, they are all dead.
And you.[br]You even move, you join him.
Arthur!
You must not fear me.
Water! Give me some water!
His arm is broken.
And his famiIy?
She's a Woad.
I'm a Roman officer.
You're safe now.
- You're safe.[br]- Stop what you are doing!
What is this madness?
- They're all pagans here![br]- So are we.
They refuse to do the task[br]God has set for them!
They must die as an exampIe!
You mean they refused to be your serfs!
You are a Roman.
You understand.
And you are a Christian.
You! You kept her aIive!
- My Iord![br]- No! No, stop!
When we get to the wall[br]you will be punished for this heresy.
Perhaps I shouId kill you now[br]and seaI my fate.
I was willing to die with them.
Yes, to Iead them to their rightfuI pIace.
It is God's wish[br]that these sinners be sacrificed.
OnIy then can their souIs be saved.
Then I shall grant his wish.
- Wall them back up.[br]- Arthur.
I said wall them up!
Don't you see it is the will of God[br]that these sinners be sacrificed?
- Unhand me, defiI... They're sinners![br]- Get in there!
We're moving too sIow.
The girI's not gonna make it,[br]and neither is the boy.
The famiIy we can protect, but we're[br]wasting our time with all these peopIe.
We're not Ieaving them.
If the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.
Then save your anger for them.
Is this Rome's quest or Arthur's?
- Arthur.[br]- How is he?
He burns.
Brave boy.
Some of your fingers are out of pIace.
I have to push them back.
If I don't do this, there's a chance[br]you may never use them again.
They tortured me.
With machines.
To make me tell them things that...[br]that I didn't know to begin with.
And then...
I heard your voice in the dark.
I am Guinevere.
You are Arthur... of the Knights from the Great Wall.
I am.
The famous Briton[br]who kills his own peopIe.
I found tracks coming from the south,[br]but none going back.
Horsemen traveIing Iight and fast.
CouId be Roman cavaIry.
CouId be knights.
They know we're after them.
They'll head east now,[br]through the mountains.
God's hoIy work has been defiIed.[br]I am a servant of God!
No, pIease, I...
He says they walled him up in a buiIding[br]and took the famiIy.
Someone who goes[br]by the name of Artorius.
It's him.
It's Arthur.
Take your men east. Hunt them down.
I'll take the main army to the wall.[br]Bring the famiIy there.
- And the monks?[br]- Put them back where you found them.
I am a servant of God!
PIease, I... I am a servant of God!
Unhand me, you defiIer!
Burn it all.
My father toId me great taIes of you.
Really?
And what did you hear?
Fairy taIes.
The kind you hear about peopIe so brave,[br]so seIfIess, that they can't be reaI.
Arthur and his knights.
A Ieader both Briton and Roman.
And yet you chose your allegiance[br]to Rome.
To those who take[br]what does not beIong to them.
That same Rome that took your men[br]from their homeIand.
Listen, Iady, do not pretend[br]you know anything about me or my men.
How many Britons have you killed?
As many as tried to kill me. It's the natural[br]state of any man to want to live.
Animals live! It's a natural state of any man[br]to want to live free in their own country.
I belong to this land.
Where do you belong, Arthur?
How's your hand?
I'll live, I promise you.
Is there nothing about my land[br]that appeals to your heart?
Your own father married a Briton.
Even he must have found something[br]to his liking.
We'll sleep here.[br]Take shelter in those trees.
- Tristan.[br]- You wanna go out again? Yeah.
'Tis a beautiful country, is it not?
If you say so.
And where do you come from[br]that compares?
The Black Sea?
This is heaven for me.
I don't believe in heaven.[br]I've been living in this hell.
But if you represent what heaven is,[br]then take me there.
Rain and snow at once.
A bad omen.
It is here, given to us by the Pope.[br]These people, they send an army for us.
What was it like, your home?
We sacrificed goats, drank their blood,[br]danced naked round fires.
What I do remember...
Home...
Oceans of grass from horizon to horizon,[br]further than you can ride.
The sky, bigger than you can imagine.
No boundaries.
Some people would call that freedom.
That's what we fight for -[br]our land, our people.
The right to choose our own destiny.
So you see, Lancelot,[br]we are much alike, you and I.
And when you return home,[br]wiLL you take a wife, have sons?
I have killed too many sons.
What right do I have to my own?
No family, no religion.
Do you believe in anything at all?
I would have left you[br]and the boy there to die.
You betrayed me.
He means you no harm.
Peace between us this night,[br]Arthur Castus.
So Rome is leaving. The Saxon is come.
The world we have known[br]and fought for is ended.
Now we must make a new world.
Your world, Merlin, not mine.[br]I shall be in Rome.
To find peace?[br]The Saxon will come to Rome.
My knights trust me[br]not to betray them to their enemy.
Rome was my enemy, not Arthur.
We have no fight between us now.
You tell that to the knights[br]you killed before my eyes, whose bones are buried in this earth.
We have all lost brothers.
You know nothing of the loss I speak!
Shall I help you remember?
An attack on a village.[br]The screams of an innocent woman.
Mother!
Artorius!
Mother!
Mother!
I ran to the burial mound[br]of my father to free her.
To kill you.
Father, please let loose your sword.
I feel the heat of that fire[br]on my face even now.
I did not wish her dead.
She was of our blood, as are you.
If you were so determined to leave us[br]to slaughter, why did you save so many?
My men are strong,[br]but they have need of a true leader.
They believe you can do anything.
To defeat the Saxon[br]we need a master of war.
Why do you think[br]I spared you in the forest?
That sword you carry is made of iron[br]from this earth, forged in the fires of Britain.
It was love of your mother[br]that freed the sword, not hatred of me.
Love, Arthur.
- It is your destiny.[br]- There is no destiny.
There is only free will.
And what of the free will of your knights?
Did they die in vain?
Seize him!
No!
No...
I have the boy!
- Kill him![br]- No, don't! Let him go!
Kill him now!
Down!
Your hands seem to be better.
Artorius!
Do we have a problem?
Huh?
You have a choice.
You help or you die.
Put down your weapons.
- Do it now![br]- Yeah!
- How many did you kill?[br]- Four.
Not a bad start to the day!
Armor-piercing.[br]They're close. We have no time.
You ride ahead.
I'm sorry for your loss.
My father lost his way.
He used to say the Church[br]is there to help us stay on our path.
Fletcher Ridge, Illinois. Large enough to have a U.P.S. office... and a driver named Jarod Harper.
Very good, Broots.
Any physical description?
Size, weight and color all match Jarod perfectly.
And he got the job at almost exactly the same time that...
- I calculated his position.
- Call Lyle.
- I already have. He's on his way.
- Great. Let's go.
[Cell Phone Rings, Beeps]
- What?
- [Mr. Parker] Angel.
- Angel, I have to see you.
- [Whispering] Daddy?
The junkyard near the Quentin Street
Overpass, and hurry.
- Daddy!
- [Dial Tone]
You look bothered, Miss Parker.
Don't you have a bake sale to organize?
I know these are stressful times for you.
That's why I want you to have this.
It's a prayer card.
I slept with it under my pillow.
- That explains the grease stains.
- I asked for it to be filled... with the answers you need.
- God bless.
- You too.
Parker?
Are you coming?
I'll be back.
- What about Jarod?
- What about Lyle?
Um, buy me some time.
A few hours.
[Siren Wails]
[Second Siren Wailing]
Ouch!
Sorry, mister.
It got away from me.
- Wow. This is a great car.
- Thanks.
- I bought it with my tooth fairy money.
- "Tooth fairy"?
You know, where you put your tooth under your pillow... the tooth fairy takes it and leaves you money.
Didn't you ever get that when you were a kid?
I wasn't really a kid when I was a kid.
Thanks, mister.
[Bell Tolling]
[Woman] Would you just shut up?
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Damn it, Sarah, we don't have a choice.
Cam, we don't need to be making these arrangements.
The hell we don't! These people at the hospital already showed... they don't care whether us Larsens live or die- Billy, come on.
- Cam, the doctors said-
- I know what the doctors said.
I know what needs to be done.
- Why do you have guns?
- [Engine Revs]
Cam! What are you planning to do?
- I didn't start this, Sarah.
- Cameron!
- Go home!
- [Screams]
Come on, damn it!
[Crying]
Damn it!
Here you go.
Use mine.
[Beeps, Dials]
- [Line Ringing]
- [Woman] 9-1-1. Can I help you?
Yes, ma'am. My name is Sarah Larsen.
My brothers are on the way to the hospital. They have guns.
I don't know! Look, you just gotta do something... before somebody gets hurt, okay?
- [Sobs]
- [Beeps]
I appreciate- Mister?
[Woman On Police Radio] All units, hostage situation at Saint Mary's Hospital.
- Men considered armed and dangerous.
- [Sirens Wailing]
[People Clamoring]
[Cam] Billy, hurry up and get those windows painted.
Nobody moves and nobody gets hurt!
We're all gonna be here awhile, so just get comfortable.
[Woman On P.A.]
All medical personnel.
Prepare to evacuate all non critical patients from the first floor.
- How you doin', Pop?
- [Machine Beeping]
[Man]
Keep evacuating!
Everybody sit tight and wait for my command.
If there's a clear shot, you let me know.
Well, that's an interesting philosophy.
Shoot first, ask questions later.
- Who are you?
- Special Agent Jarod Jackson, Chicago F.B.I.
I'm the hostage negotiator.
- This is my show now.
- Damn!
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
36 hours and he's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
Best we can figure, there's a half a dozen people being held.
Including three patients in the seized wing that could die... in the next few hours without treatment.
- Kill that alarm!
- The hostage-takers?
Billy Larsen. He's 21.
Good kid, with no priors.
Big brother Cam's 28.
He's a hothead... with a sheet that goes all the way back to high school.
- Weapons?
- Rifle and shotgun, according to their sister.
- I'll need her brought here as soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.
- They make any demands?
- Nothing yet.
- What's your read on the situation?
- You're the big badge.
- You tell me.
- They've isolated the situation... to a specific area of the hospital where their father is a patient.
My guess, it's some sort of grievance against the hospital.
- How do you figure that?
- Like you said, I'm the big badge.
Let's go to work.
This is F.B.I. Special Agent
Jarod Jackson.
I want to talk to you about your demands.
If you've got something on your minds... now might be a good time to discuss it.
This is between us and the hospital.
You've got your father in there.
Innocent people who need medical attention.
Neither one of us want anyone to die here today.
So why don't you tell me what you want...
- and we can end this thing.
- [Cam] I want you to write this down.
Not a penny more, not a penny less.
Over and out.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Need to establish a direct phone line into that room.
- Yes, sir.
- What if they don't answer?
Hell, they could have already killed somebody, and we'd never know it.
Where can I get blueprints of this building?
- I can get 'em here 10 ten minutes.
- All right.
I need a fiber-optics video camera, with a transmitter and microwave intercept.
Hold on, Einstein.
This town has two red lights, three hardware stores.
- Meaning?
- Meaning, if you want a hammer,
I can help you out.
You want to build a nuclear reactor, you're outta luck.
- This town have an electronics store?
- That we got.
I'm going to make a list of things I need.
Get these to me, A.S.A.P.
[Engine Revving]
[Beeping]
[BabyCrying]
[Crying Continues]
Angel.
- Ugh.
- You weren't followed?
- Daddy, you look-
- Oh, I'm sorry to scare you.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
- Daddy, what the hell is going on?
- Come on, come on.
Come on back here.
Sit down.
- [Panting]
- Where have you been?
Underground. This is the last place they'd look. [Panting]
Now, look.
There's a strongbox in SL-22.
- In a panel behind the fire hose.
- Strongbox?
Yeah. It's filled with cash.
Bring it to me.
But don't tell anybody.
Life and death, understand?
- No, I don't.
- Brigitte and I had to leave our hiding place.
I need the money to last us a few weeks.
- Daddy, if I knew why you were running-
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- [Beeps]
- What?
Bad news. Jarod never showed up for his shift at the U.P.S. job.
- We missed him!
- Lyle?
He's looking for you, and he is peeved.
What else is new? I want you to keep searching for Jarod.
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- [Kissing Sound]
Daddy?
[Woman] This whole thing is gonna turn into a nightmare.
Nobody's gonna want to get treated at the O.K. Corral.
- Who are you?
- Rebecca Simons, hospital administrator.
Dr. Stephen Franklin, chief cardiologist.
They spoke to the Larsen boys before they pulled their guns.
- I'm listening.
- Family brought their father.
- Jake Larsen.
- He was complaining of chest pains.
- Family thought it might be a heart attack.
- He was admitted to C.C.U.?
Yes, yes. I diagnosed him with a type of arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation.
It's painful, but it's not life-threatening.
- Apparently, his sons had a different opinion.
- Maybe I should have kept...
Mr. Larsen one more night to ease their minds.
Does this figure mean anything to you, Doctor?
- Not in particular. What is it?
- [Sighs] That's a good question.
Agent Jackson, there are patients in there... who will die in the next few hours if left untreated.
[Sighs]
Excuse me.
Sarah, my name is Jarod.
- The man with the telephone.
- I'm with the F.B.I.
I think it's safe to say that neither one of us woke up this morning expecting to be here.
- [Sighs]
- I realize that you're going through... a very difficult time right now.
But I have to understand:
Why are your brothers doing this?
Look, I want to end this thing without anybody getting hurt.
But the truth is, I can only hold those men off for so long.
Move over there.
Get that door.
Everything was always pretty crazy in our family.
But things seemed to really come undone after Mom died.
- Especially for Cam.
- Your mom was here, at this hospital.
Same room where Daddy is.
[Sighs] She was so sick when they sent her home... and... she died a few days later.
And now your father's here.
Look, my brothers may be doing the wrong thing... but they must be doing it for the right reason- and I am not gonna help you kill them for it.
Agent Jackson.
Got the equipment you wanted.
All right. Let's see what's going on in there.
- [Heart Monitor Beeping]
- [Moaning]
- What are we gonna do, Cam?
- I'm thinking!
[Softly]
I'm thinking.
[Billy] I hope you know what you're doin', big brother.
- I don't get it.
- Sometimes it helps to be a fly on the wall.
Or in this case, the airvent.
Grab those blueprints.
This will give us a better sense of the space where the hostages are being held... windows, exits-
[Deputy]
I'll be damned.
I could use this to get a clean shot. I have men on the roof, next to the seized wing.
Isn't it your job to consider everybody's safety?
My job is to save the lives of those civilians inside!
If I hesitate, and one innocent person dies, it's my fault.
I won't make that mistake.
The sheriff seems a little on edge.
[Deputy]
He has his reasons.
[Jake] Cam! What the hell do you think you're doin'?
- [Cam] I know what I'm doin', Pop.
- You wouldn't be here... if your mama was still alive.
Well, she's not, and I am.
Stop talkin'.
Just get some rest.
Man, there are guns and badges all over the place down there.
[Sighs] Well, what the hell did you think was gonna happen?
Come in here with guns, they'd leave a parking ticket on our car?
Just keep lookout.
Sheriff says, kill the air and the lights.
[Motors Decelerating]
You two get down!
- [Jake Gasping]
- What now?
[Phone Ringing]
- Yeah.
- Cam. This is Agent Jackson.
Turn the lights and air back on!
All right, I'll give you what you want, and you give me a couple of hostages.
- Why should I trust you?
- You have my word.
No harm will come to you or your brother, as long as we keep talking.
It's going to get really warm in there.
Now, do we have a deal?
Cam. You can trust me.
- Cam? Talk to me.
- [Gunshot]
Get down!
Everybody get down!
[Screaming]
[Gunshots Continue]
I had Cam's trust until your sniper got trigger-happy.
Hey! Cam Larsen isn't a man who can be trusted.
He incited a riot while he was in prison.
Did you know that?
The guards were beating the prisoners, and they were convicted on brutality charges.
Did you know that?
I got Cam on the line.
- Cam.
- Are you guys crazy?
I had nothing to do with that shooting, I swear to you.
Look, i-it's important that I come in there and speak to you face-to-face.
I'm not here to talk!
I'm here to save my dad's life.
Understand? It's too hot in here.
Turn on the air, now.
Yes. Yes, I will turn the air conditioning back on, I promise.
- Now, can I come in there?
- [Sighs Deeply]
Okay. But just you.
Unarmed. Ten minutes.
- All right. Ten minutes.
- [Line Clicks]
- Those are Cam's kids.
- I had them brought in.
- To get under his skin?
- To get into his heart.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- What?
- Where are you?
- Never mind. Did you find Jarod?
I was scanning police chatter in Fletcher Ridge... and I came across a hostage negotiation situation there at a hospital.
- F.B.I. involvement.
- And?
It sounded like something that Jarod would be drawn to...
- so I-I contacted the Chicago office of the F.B.I.-
- Let me guess.
- No F.B.I. involvement.
- If there were any agents on the job there... they would have come from the Chicago office, and they hadn't sent anybody.
[Groans] He never left town. Get the jet ready, and I'll be back as soon as I can.
- [Softly] What about Lyle?
- Lyle who?
[Hangs Up Receiver, Beeps]
Hmm.
I love ice cream.
[Smacking Lips]
I want to help your dad, but I'm going to need your help to do it.
[Siren Wailing]
Last night, Daddy was yelling at Billy and Sarah.
- He was angry?
- He said the hospital was gonna send Grandpa Jake home to die.
Just like they did Grandma.
He said they were murderers.
- Murderers.
- [Sighs]
- Looks like you just lost a tooth.
- It fell out.
Are you going to put it under your pillow?
For the tooth fairy?
- Tonight.
- Wow.
- How much you figure you're gonna get?
- Mm-
- Maybe a dollar.
- A dollar.
How would you...
- [Helicopter Whirring]
- like to make five?
[Helicopter Passing By]
It's Agent Jackson.
I'm coming in, and I'm unarmed.
[Heart Monitor Beeping]
Check him out.
He's clean.
Could have got somebody killed, shootin' in here like that.
That was a mistake. That officer has been removed from the line.
We're not exactly talking about an elite police force out there.
- [Cam] Tell me about it.
- So, are you ready to end this thing, Cam?
Get your father taken care of?
I know you care about him.
That's why you're doing this.
- You don't know nothin'.
- Why don't you explain it to me?
- That's an odd price to place on somebody's life.
- It's not my price. It's theirs.
- [Moaning]
- Oh, she's gettin' worse.
- Hey-hey!
- So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna keep her here and let her die?
Her life for your father's, is that it?
- Cam, maybe we should let her go, huh?
- Billy, shut up!
- [Gasps]
- You're not a killer, Cam.
You let this woman die, and you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison.
You and Billy, here.
- Think about your children.
- My kids.
- They won't understand this.
- Can't believe how much your little boy looks like you.
- You talked to my boy?
- It'sprocedure. Oh, Cody.
He asked me to give you this.
[Helicopter Whirring]
- So, how much do you want me to leave for him?
- How much?
Money. From the tooth fairy.
Right. Tooth fairy.
You got a dollar?
- All I got's a five.
- Give it here.
- You're gonna give him five bucks for a baby tooth?
- Just give me the money.
You walk outta here now, you can still put this money under your son's pillow yourself.
I can't leave him.
[Sighs]
Man, you don't get it, do you?
This isn't just about my father. It's about every person out there who is sick... and deserves to be treated with dignity.
They're gonna send this man home. Does he look like he should go home to you?
- [Gasping]
- At least, give me a hostage.
- [Scoffs]
- You gotta work with me here, Cam.
There are a lot of people out there looking for any reason to shoot you... and your little brother over here.
[Woman Breathing With
Diffilculty, Coughing]
All right. Take that lady.
Take her. Help him.
Unhook her, and get her out of here.
- What about the others?
- One at a time.
Allright, allright, allright.
One at a time.
You're doing a good thing here, Cam.
[Chattering On Police Radio]
If some of those patients don't get treatment real soon, we could have a disaster here.
- Meaning?
- Maneuver Cam to a window.
One shot, and it's over.
Why is it that you feel that bullets are the only option?
One shot.
Deputy, may I have a word with you?
[Heart Monitor Beeping]
[Spitting]
- What's your name?
- Lindsay.
L-Lindsay Tyler.
Shouldn't bite your nails,
Lindsay. It's a bad habit.
- I know.
- Y-You don't remember me, do you?
- Should I?
- Cindy Perkins?
Junior high school,
Sadie Hawkins dance-
I asked you to dance once, and you said yes?
- [Sighs]
- I had stringy hair, braces-
Yeah, yeah.
You chased me around the gym all night.
What was that, 10, 15 years ago?
You kept asking the band to play your favorite song.
- "Dream Weaver." [Chuckles]
- That's a damn fine song.
[Helicopter Passing Overhead]
You know, my dad died of heart problems.
Th-That's why I went into nursing.
Your father sort of reminds me of my dad.
[Jake Coughing]
Look, Cindy-
[Sighs Deeply]
I'm sorry about all this.
I never meant to-
- Cam?
- [Alarm Beeping]
- Cam, come here.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
He's not breathing!
- [Ringing]
- I need a doctor in here now! Now!
All right, Cam. I'll send one in.
Get your gear.
- [Doctor] No.
- What did you say?
Those men are heavily armed, and they've threatened the lives of innocent people.
Unless you can assure me of my safety, I'm not going anywhere.
- Get the lights back on in that room.
- What are you gonna do?
Agent Jackson.
Agent Jackson!
Cam, it's Agent Jackson.
I'm coming in.
- I asked for a doctor!
- Cam, he's going into cardiac arrest!
- Let him in, Cam.
- [Alarm Buzzing]
- We didn't come here to kill our own father.
- [Alarm Continues]
- [Assisted Breathing]
- Come in!
- Easy, easy!
- Where is the doctor?
[Jarod] There isn't a doctor available.
I can handle this.
- [Exhales]
- [Huffs]
I hope you can handle this.
'Cause if my old man dies, so do you.
[One Long Beep]
- [Cindy] He's been flat for 15 seconds.
- [Electrical Whining]
- Paddles charged?
- Clear.
- [Electrical Thumping]
- [Cindy] Nothing. 25 seconds.
- Talk to him.
- What?
I need him to fight.
Tell him a story from your past.
Something you did together.
Talk to him. Clear.
- [Thumps]
- Nothing.
- We're running out of time. Talk to him.
- [Cindy] 40 seconds.
Dad, remember when I was five years old... how you used to take me hunting up near Patchett Lake?
I'm going to 360 joules.
Keep talking.
- [Paddles Charging]
- Used to wake me up early, while it was still dark out.
I used to hate gettin'up so early, but you said it was important...
- to get out before the sun.
- [Jarod] Clear!
You told me that a sunrise in the woods was as close to God as a breathin' man could get.
- [Paddles Whining]
- Remember when you said that?
Remember that, Dad?
- [Cindy] One minute.
- Clear.
- [Thumping]
- [Gasping]
- Come on, old man. Fight! Don't give up! Fight.
- [Cindy] 70 seconds.
- Don't leave us, please.
- [Paddles Charging]
- We need you.
- I'm gonna hit him again. Clear!
Come on, you can fight this!
Come on, Pop.
We need you.
Cody and Kerry need their grandpa.
If we don't get him back quick, there could be permanent damage.
Don't die on me, Dad. Hang in there.
Come on. Don't die on me, Dad.
- Come on, pop!
- I'm getting a pulse.
[Steady Beeping]
They really train 'em up there at the F.B.I. Academy.
[Police Chattering On Radio]
Let's get a closer look.
[Whirring, Banging]
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know. The signal went dead.
- [Panting] Look, Cam.
You've made all the right choices up till now.
Let me take another hostage out of here.
- Okay. Yeah. You, Cindy. Go home.
- No.
- What?
- I don't leave until you do.
For my father.
I-I'll go.
- I've got to get that picture back.
- [Jarod, Indistinct]
- [Deputy] We've still got sound, Sheriff.
- [Whirring, Banging]
What the hell is this?
You've been watchin' us the whole time!
I should blow you away right now!
I knew I couldn't trust you people!
- [Moaning]
- No, no!
No. Cam. Not like this.
[Helicopter Whirring]
All right. Get out.
Take her with you.
No more talking! Just get out!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Please take care of her.
- Are you out of your mind?
- Hey, it was an accident!
You could have gotten all of us killed in there. We can't keep pushing him.
- Why can't you get that through your head?
- I've had a bellyful of you.
- Oh, yeah? And what is that supposed to mean?
- You're the big badge.
You figure it out.
[Keypad Beeping]
- [Line Ringing, Clicking]
- Alice? Get me the number for the F.B.I. office in Chicago.
[Sighs]
[Sydney] I doubt you'll find Miss Parker searching through her desk.
[Broots] We saw her this morning.
I think she had some errands to run.
She didn't say where she was going?
You know your sister. You know she dances to the beat of a different drummer.
- [Slams Book Closed]
- So I've noticed.
You two wouldn't lie to me, would you?
So, a-anybody see the, uh, 
Redskins game this weekend?
Agent Jackson. Any idea when
I might be allowed back in my office?
- No idea.
- Oh. [Sighs]
That's very impressive, the way you handled that code situation.
I didn't have much of a choice, did I?
Tell me something.
How are insurance claims processed at this hospital?
In the middle of a hostage situation, and you're wondering about billing procedure?
I'm just curious.
For instance, an H.M.O. claim.
H.M.O.'s rely on the information provided by the attending physician.
So a particular medical procedure would be approved or denied...
- based upon your recommendation.
- Yeah, that.
And the recommendation of the facilities administrator.
- Rebecca Simons.
- In the case of this hospital, yes.
What percentage of major surgeries have been denied at this hospital?
- [Sighs] Oh, I-I don't know.
- Take a guess.
[Stammering]
I-I don't know. Fifty percent?
Sixty-eight percent: 11 percentage points higher than the national average.
- Why do you think that is?
- Maybe there are just a lot of healthy people in this town.
- Maybe.
- [Helicopter Whirring]
[Dialing Phone]
- [Line Clicking]
- Uh, we need to talk.
[Siren Wailing]
[Scoffs]
You look like hell.
[Chuckling]
That's the way it is when you're dyin'.
Got yourself in a real mess here, boy.
Like everything else in my life.
Look, maybe I didn't do the things
I should have when you were small.
Hell, I- I was makin' it up as I went.
But I taught you kids right from wrong. I did that.
- I'm tryin' to save you, Dad.
- Why?
Because we're a family.
I never knew my own old man.
Not more than a smack in the head now and then.
I just did the best that I could, and-
[Sobs]
When your mama died-
I think a little bit of me went too.
Guess we've been fightin' the same pain.
[Sobbing]
I miss her. Every day.
Me too, Pop.
[Exhales]
[Jarod]
This is the exact amount this hospital charges for heart bypass surgery.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Jake Larsen has sky-high levels of creatine kinase enzyme...
- in his blood.
- So?
- His fingertips are blue from lack of oxygen.
- I still don't follow.
He has heart disease.
He's headed for a massive heart attack.
His only chance of survival is heart bypass surgery.
The same surgery this hospital denied him. [Sighs]
- Who the hell are you?
- Excuse me?
I called the F.B.I. Nobody's ever heard of an Agent Jarod Jackson.
Well, it's a big agency.
Maybe you talked to the wrong person.
If any of those people in there die, it's on your head.
You understand what that means, to have somebody's blood on your hands?
As a matter of fact, I do.
And so do you.
Your deputy told me about that hostage situation a year ago at the grocery store.
The way you lured that perpetrator into the doorway... and hesitated to take the kill shot.
Did he tell you how that same hostage-taker took his gun... and shot to death a 15-year-old stock boy?
Did he describe the sick feeling 
I get every time I see that boy's parents on the street?
- You did what you thought was the right thing to do.
- And an innocent boy... lost his life.
That's the blood I have on my hands...
Agent Jackson.
[Siren Wailing]
Certainly has been a long day, hasn't it?
- Agent Jackson.
- I was wondering if you and I could have a little talk.
Oh, well, the truth is,
I'm late for a meeting. Perhaps later.
I know about the cover-up concerning
Jake Larsen's coronary disease.
But what could an H.M.O. possibly have to gain by such a cover-up?
I saw you and Dr. Franklin arguing in the parking lot. I know what's going on.
We could talk about it here in private, or we could go downtown... and talk under the glare of the television cameras.
It's up to you.
Is it just for the money?
Or is it something more personal?
I see the way you and
Dr. Franklin are together.
My girlfriends and I... used to dream about meeting a doctor.
Falling in love, and living happily ever after.
I actually believed that's the way it would be for Stephen and me.
Your signature is on the release forms for all the patients in question.
I made my decisions based on
Franklin's recommendations.
I looked the other way in one case, next thing I knew, I was-
All for money.
Franklin was getting kickbacks from the H.M.O.'s for not doing expensive surgeries.
By denying certain procedures to critically ill patients... he saves the H.M.O. hundreds of thousands of dollars.
- And makes a nice percentage.
- I swear to you...
I didn't know about Jake Larsen until his sons took over the hospital.
Franklin said that you questioned him, and he threatened to expose me... if I said anything, and-
I was afraid.
Not half as afraid as those patients who were sent home to die.
- The key you gave me doesn't work.
- Really? Huh.
Must have given you the wrong one.
Here, let me try this one.
- [Key Turning Lock]
- Yep. That works. [Chuckling]
Angel, I'm sorry I had to drag you into this.
"Baby Parker."
Wh-What was that?
Oh, it's nothing.
- It looked like a medical record.
- It's ancient history.
- It is mine, or Lyle's?
- It doesn't matter!
Trust me. Some day, when I have more time,
I'll explain everything to you.
- But right now, I need your gun.
- My gun?
This is about that hit out on you.
Yeah, the bastards are closin' in.
- Who ordered it?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I do know... this... is the only thing that really matters.
It's the future of our family.
It's the heir to the Parker name, and it's growing inside Brigitte.
The baby'll be here soon.
- What else can I do?
- Well, the key is still Jarod.
Bring him back, and it'll be just like it was.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
[Ringing]
- [Beeping]
- I'm on my way.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Phone Ringing]
- Yeah?
- Dr. Franklin?
Agent Jackson. Cam and Billy Larsen have tapped into hospital records... and are trying to find information about patients who were denied care.
- Can you cut them off?
- We tried.
I suggest I download everything. I wouldn't want you to lose any patient records.
No! No, I'll, uh-
I'll handle that.
I-I know which files are important.
Can I get back in my office yet?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Things are still pretty dangerous up here.
I couldn't assure your safety.
Dr. Franklin?
- Dr. Franklin.
- I'm on my way up.
If you think that's best.
[Coughs]
- [Gunshots]
- [Glass Breaking]
- What happened?
- I was shot! The Larsen boys.
They're crazy!
They're coming down the hallway.
They say they know who's responsible for trying to kill their father.
I've gotta get out of here.
[Grunts]
- Doctor?
- I can't breathe! [Panting]
My heart!
[Groans]
[Panting]
What's happening to me?
The same thing that you let happen to Jake Larsen.
You're having a massive heart attack.
[Gasping] Wha-
What have you done to me?
I laced your keyboard with a tricyclic antidepressant.
It's absorbed through the fingertips.
Speeds up the heart's rhythm.
That's why I faked getting shot... told you that the Larsen boys were coming down the hallway-
I wanted to scare you. You see, adrenaline, it really increases the effects of the drug.
- [Gasping] Why?
- Because of what you did to Jake Larsen.
Because of the drugs you gave him to cover up the symptoms of his coronary disease.
- [Groaning] Who are you?
- I'm everyone.
I'm no one.
If you tell me the truth...
I can bring your heart back to normal.
Look, we're all on the same side here- [Grunting]
There's no reason to let this become a problem.
Oh, it became a problem when you aligned yourself with an H.M.O.... that cared more about profits than taking care of patients.
God, Larsen wouldn't have survived another year no matter what we did.
That is not the point!
You're a doctor!
Your job is to give care, not take it away!
- [Groans In Pain]
- That cyanosis must really be setting in right now.
You should really seek treatment.
Or you can die within minutes.
- Please! Please!
- How many people?
How many people did you let die so you could stuff your pockets?
[Grunts] All right,
I took kickbacks from the H.M.O.'s... to send patients home- now please, help me!
- Please!
- Sorry, Doc.
But your claim has been denied.
No! No.
[Sobbing, Groaning]
[Chattering On Police Radio]
- Is he really gonna die?
- I just laced his keyboard with trigoxin.
He has nothing more than a really bad case of heartburn.
And he'll probably lose bladder control for a couple of days.
[Chattering On Police Radio]
[Grunting]
- [Sighs]
- [Siren Wailing]
I'm gonna drop some of the charges against the brothers.
Let the judge deal with the rest.
Considering the circumstances, I think they've suffered enough for one family.
I think you're right.
Thank you for keeping me from doing something stupid.
I guess we can't let the mistakes of our past ruin our future.
Will you excuse me, Sheriff?
Excuse me. Are you from the Chicago office?
- Are you a reporter?
- Blue Cove Gazette.
Have you been involved during the entire crisis?
No, I just arrived on the scene.
There was another negotiator involved.
Our source from your Chicago office...
- tells us he was an impostor.
- That's what we've been told.
- And where is he?
- No idea.
I don't know how he did it, but witnesses say he really knew what he was doing.
Excuse me.
It's your fault we missed him.
[Mr. Parker]
Now don't tell anybody.
Life and death, understand? Someday, when I have more time, I'll explain everything to you.
Well, the key is still Jarod.
Bring him back, and it'll be just like it was.
You're gonna be held accountable for this, Parker.
I know. Let's go home.
My lord, time is short.
Leave now, I beg you.
You'll be arrested.
Fetch some candles.
I'll be working late.
And my usual glass of wine.
This world had to change.
But the Revolution is now a terror sweeping the land,
and it's my turn to be swept aside.
Old prejudices make men blind, drive them mad...
devour their hearts and turn them into beasts.
In the year 1764,
the Beast reached our soil and made it its own.
A year later, its fame had spread beyond the borders of our province,
and it seemed no mortal would ever overcome it.
The Beast's assaults
slowly sank the region of Gévaudan into darkness.
Who goes there?
What's he done?
- What?
- He's a thief.
And her?
His daughter. Damned witch!
I healed their horses. They owe me.
Don't listen. They're liars!
- Did he heal the horses?
- Yes.
Begone!
Welcome to the land of the Beast!
Beware of wolf traps!
Sir Grégoire de Fronsac
and the man they called Mani were neither hunters nor soldiers.
A naturalist at the King's Garden,
Fronsac was a libertine
and a fine wit.
The man who shadowed him
was a mysterious foreigner.
At nightfall, the travelers arrived at the castle of Marquis d'Apcher,
their protector in Gévaudan for the duration of their mission.
Our people fear no ordinary wolf.
The Beast is different.
It flees men as if it knew to fear them, yet spares no woman or child.
Have you ever seen it?
How do you know it's just one animal?
The survivors all say the same.
It's bigger than a wolf and has no fear of firearms.
I understand your skepticism.
I don't believe any more than you in dragons.
I've had a report drawn up, a memoir of the Beast's crimes.
Judge for yourself.
You battled the English in New France?
Yes, I went to study animals and nature.
I returned with wounds and a captain's rank.
I've organized a hospital for victims of the Beast, in an old priory.
A woman from Lorciére.
The Beast attacked her coming from the fair.
Two men saved her, the Beast fled, but took half her face.
Tell me, how is M. Buffon?
And how fares Paris?
And L'Ingénu? Have you read it?
It's a bit late to discuss philosophy.
Quite right. Let's speak of theater.
Do you know any actresses?
What's in the theater this winter?
Put it there.
They are a gallant lot, it's said.
I've read some are free with their charms.
Do tell me.
Here, to satisfy your curiosity.
The Mercure de France!
We only get the Courrier d'Avignon.
- I'll show you the common room.
- He'll stay here.
Very well. Good night, sir.
It's not Versailles, but the wine's good.
It's big as a cow.
Jacques says he's seen many wolves.
It's no wolf.
Its snout is longer, its teeth are like knives.
- If not a wolf, what was it then?
- A demon.
Chevalier, the Beast has struck near St. Alban.
There.
There's no one there.
Halt!
What are those bastards doing here?
Good day, Captain.
Good day, Marquis. My respects.
Beware. There are traps.
Duhamel, Sir Grégoire de Fronsac of the King's Gardens.
He'd like to examine her body, with your permission, of course.
The one who brutalized my men?
- Had I known you ordered...
- I did not.
You did well, and I beg your pardon.
They're soldiers trained for war, not hunting.
Careful, she's stuffed with poison.
What sort of gardener are you?
When the Beast is killed,
His Majesty wants it studied in Paris.
I'll keep it after it's captured.
I'm having a look.
With that jaw, it must weigh 500 pounds.
This time, I'll get it... before the snow.
It can't get away.
- Ever seen it?
- Once.
Once, in my musket sight.
I wounded it, my word on it.
It collapsed, then at once revived.
We lost it near Mt. Mouchet, vanished in the wood.
Did it look like this?
It had a black stripe and spike on its back.
My friends, this is the sketch artist,
Sir Grégoire de Fronsac.
A man of Providence indeed, come from Paris to... sketch the Beast.
His Eminence, the Bishop de Mende, the Duke de Moncan, the Count de Morangias, and Madame the Countess.
Their son, Jean-François, who has also traveled.
- A clever hand, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
M. Laffont, our intendant.
Father Henri Sardis of St. Alban's.
Tell us, sir, is there talk of the Beast in Paris?
- They've written ballads.
- Prayers would do better!
Does Capt. Duhamel so need God?
Don't we all?
Duhamel just dresses his men as women to bait the Beast.
He's doing what he can.
Such indulgence!
Duhamel is incompetent.
His hunts exhaust the people, his ruffians devastate our land, and the Beast roams free.
If Duhamel is all I get for paying my taxes to Paris,
I'd rather give it to my valets.
- What do you say, sir?
- You're not obliged to reply.
His Lordship likes to argue, but he's a good Christian.
When you arrived, this assembly was talking my ears off with God this and God that.
It's said the Pope sent a spy to see if the Beast is a manifestation of the Devil.
Pardon me.
Marianne de Morangias.
A daunting task indeed.
The most elusive quarry in our land.
- Who's the hapless hunter?
- Des Forêts, a playwright.
- Then it's simple.
- Careful, she's a Morangias.
Sir, we were conferring...
- M. Des Forêts?
- Himself.
An honor. Good writers are rare.
Marquis d'Apcher spoke of you.
He thought of you for his memoirs.
Really?
He's in good spirits.
But have some finesse.
Wait till he broaches the subject.
Excuse me.
- Have you no shame?
- None.
Does the naturalist like our country?
I've only glimpsed its beauties so far, or one of them.
Is such the talk of court?
No, this is a couplet reserved for provincials.
I might go to court if there were ladies like you.
Dinner is served. Let's go in.
Whither thou goest...
In sailing up the St. Lawrence we found in our nets the strangest animal I'd ever seen.
I'd heard of the native's sacred fish, but I was sure it was a legend.
I was looking at a fish the shape and size of a trout, but which was entirely covered in a rich black fur.
A furry trout? Surely you jest.
No, sir.
Salmo truta dermopilla from Canada.
Soft as mink.
- Nature is extraordinary!
- The water must be cold!
This proves the impossible may be possible.
Well said.
It surely won you the King's favor.
I doubt he deserves it.
Though I do recognize your comedic talent.
Had I two hands, I'd applaud.
- Please pardon him.
- Your son is right.
This animal doesn't exist.
My taxidermist is a clever man.
Please excuse the prank.
Should this fable convince us there is no Beast?
That we're simpletons?
The moral of the fable is that dragons and unicorns only appear in fables.
Lies appear true when dressed in Latin.
Careful, sir. We may lose all sense of what you're saying.
Indeed, are you a naturalist or a philosopher?
Or worse, an actor!
I believe the knight is, above all, Parisian.
Enough talk of the Beast.
After all, it only preys on peasants.
How about a guessing game? Charades?
I've just composed a lover's lament.
May I, Countess?
- If it isn't licentious.
- Oh no.
It's very chaste and pure.
It's an improvisation.
It's called "Wolves Howl".
"I went not warily though I bore no malice, verily
"Your sly eye caught my heart in its prowl
"I howl"
Shall I see you soon?
Have you other amazing animals to show me?
You seem set in your idea of me.
Allow me to change your mind.
Try.
- Coming to the hunt?
- Certainly.
I can't allow it. Too dangerous.
Obedience is the virtue of well-born girls.
This young man is right.
That day in Gévaudan,
there was the greatest hunt ever in France.
The King offered 6,000 pounds bounty for the Beast.
Thousands of enlisted peasants, swordsmen and soldiers
were joined by every hunter and adventurer in the region.
For a few hours, we forgot we were the hunted.
You each have a map and a location.
Movements begin at 7:00.
Thank you.
You might well thank us!
My people have better things to do.
Your generosity rivals your courage.
Enough! For your sake, we'd better take it.
We shall, Your Lordship.
What is this ruckus?
Fine weapon, isn't it?
I had it made in Mende after a campaign.
Custom-made for me, of course.
Look. Even in Paris you'll never see such a bullet.
I make them myself.
Silver? Afraid of werewolves?
I like to sign my shots.
I'm a hunter, Fronsac.
And it has cost me dearly.
How did it happen?
I learned the hard way that one bullet won't always suffice.
And, Sardis notwithstanding, prayer won't cure gangrene.
- Did a bear injure you?
- A lion.
Yes, two years in the Navy,
I traveled a lot.
Do you know Africa?
My lords, my daughter caused all this.
Here. Punish her as you will.
Witch!
She's a daughter of the Devil!
- A demon has got her!
- She's ill!
She's not possessed!
Burn her!
She mustn't swallow her tongue.
She'd suffocate.
- She's not possessed.
- I know.
Naturalist, philosopher and a bonesetter as well?
She didn't show. I won the bet.
Marquis.
And the natives?
Superstitious brutes, like here.
Indian hunters eat the hearts of their prey for strength.
Are they brutes then?
In Africa, it's their enemies' hearts.
My lord the Count, Jean-François, you must move east...
There you are.
Your mother will be worried.
She always is.
If I listened, I'd be in a convent.
I knew you didn't believe me.
You're a libertine.
- Not when I'm in love.
- You're in love?
Ridiculous! We've hardly met.
You thought I meant you?
She must learn to ride like a lady.
No harm in a little exercise.
- My father sees no evil.
- My son sees evil everywhere.
People died here.
How do you know?
I hear their cries.
Mani, stop it.
He's right. This was a Templar stronghold.
Twenty-five heretics were burned alive in the chapel.
- Is he a seer?
- No need to be.
You just need to look.
My brother and I played here.
Were you not afraid?
He said he would protect me from ghosts.
- No taste for the hunt?
- That a crime here?
The Indians say a portrait steals the soul.
My soul interests you as well?
On foot at a hunt?
- My fault.
- I didn't ask you.
- What possessed you?
- It's only a wolf.
- And if it were the Beast?
- I don't think so.
Thank you.
Pray the Beast is one of these wolves.
These won't devour anyone now.
Curious fellow.
- Where did you find him?
- New France.
Is he an Acadian?
An Indian. A Mohawk Iroquois.
An Indian? A real one?
He doesn't look it.
Come to St. Alban tonight.
We'll have fun with your valet.
He's not my valet.
- What then?
- He's my brother.
Really! Mixing your blood with that of a savage?
A man who shares one's hardship is no savage.
Mani saved me from the English at Trois Riviéres.
I thought the savages were cannibals.
As you can see, sir, Mani is no animal.
Can you reproduce with a woman of our race?
All women are the same color when candles blow out.
Yes, Father, they even have wit.
Indians and whites have had children.
We're one species.
Don't speak too soon.
It's a bit like the Negroes.
What say you, Sardis?
Your blood brother is God's child.
- Has he been baptized?
- He hasn't asked.
You are a man of your times!
Mani has his beliefs.
At home, he was a sort of priest.
If they have priests, they're doomed.
What are these beliefs?
Each man has an animal spirit, called a totem.
Amusing. How does it work?
Would you?
Never fear, it won't hurt.
Caribou. A sort of stag.
What says my wife?
Am I a stag because of my horns or because of something else?
And my dear Thomas, what's his totem?
Worm. Bookworm probably.
Snake.
For Indians, the snake embodies wisdom.
Serpent wise.
And our intendant?
Boar.
Lighten your spirit.
Perhaps for these barbarians the pig is nobility.
Who's next? Sardis?
And me?
What am I, a semi-lion?
Half an eagle?
Make me a lizard, so my arm may grow back.
Jean-François, enough.
What? Have I been gauche?
Let me be.
Mademoiselle? Your turn?
Pardon me, but I'm weary of your tricks.
I'll retire before you begin juggling or dancing on a ball.
Good night.
It'll cheer you, Fronsac.
It's the best house in Mende.
You'll sleep better than at an inn.
They're all for you.
And the new girl is very...
Dear little Marquis.
Come.
I'm expensive, Grégoire de Fronsac.
- Do you know me?
- In here, Gévaudan becomes very small.
Italian?
Just passing through.
I have money.
It's not only a matter of money.
What then?
- Who did that to you?
- An Iroquois arrow.
Not far from the heart.
I may be a lucky man.
And that?
A bear.
He didn't care much for me.
You haven't seen anything yet.
My business is dangerous.
Some men aren't so nice.
Something to remember me by.
A scandal! In my house!
- Valentine!
- I don't lay with sorcerers!
- What?
- Snakes on him! I saw them move!
Our reputation! You have to go!
It's nothing.
He's an Indian, not a sorcerer.
- Then no Indians!
- You have delicate whores.
Come on, girls.
Who will go with our redskin?
I'll double the fee.
- I like his tattoos.
- That settles that.
So, a sorcerer are we?
Will you do my portrait?
If you don't behave.
Weeks passed, and Duhamel's men couldn't find the Beast.
A third winter would be spent under its reign.
The snow could not stop it anymore than our rifles and dogs.
Recall how God warned us through the words of Moses:
"I shall come unto you like a bear whose cubs are ravished.
"As a lion I shall devour your children and spill their entrails.
"I will set upon ye a fearsome Beast
"to consume you and your flocks,
"and make your fields barren."
How long, O Lord, wouldst Thou forsake us?
A candle for each victim.
Is this truly the Age of Reason?
Have mercy!
Forgive me!
Have mercy!
Bless me!
What is it, my son?
God has punished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!
I'm damned! We all are!
Gather your men. We must leave.
Alert Mani. I'll find you on the way!
Hello, friend of the wolves.
I have something for you.
I want to see you. Alone.
In 10 days my mother's going to a retreat and my father to a cure.
- Ten days?
- I'm not as free as you.
The torch.
Bring the torch!
The storm is rising; the men are tired.
We'd best go home.
No. We must find the girl.
I found the child.
Captain, your web of traps snares more peasants than wolves, your men have plundered the population, and since you began, the wolf has taken 12 more lives.
It should never have escaped us.
How's that?
It should never have escaped us.
What say you, Fronsac?
What sort of wolf is this?
My only certainty is that this is no wolf.
Wolves don't attack men, or very rarely.
I studied them in New France.
Perhaps our wolves are different.
A rabid wolf will attack.
And dies within a fortnight.
For two years, the Beast has had its bloody reign.
Its victims bear wounds no wolf could inflict.
I've often found upon the body a piece of this metal.
- So?
- So... no animal has fangs of iron.
Then the Beast is not an animal? Fine.
How do we catch it?
While we speculate, it's killing our people.
Gentlemen, let us hear M. de Fronsac with utmost attention.
So you say, sir, this is no ordinary animal.
We all think so.
And for myself I'm pleased you concede this is something supernatural.
I concede nothing, Father.
I have only doubts.
Anything to add?
No, gentlemen.
I've received this from Paris.
Capt. Duhamel His Majesty has been informed of your ineffective efforts.
He requests you be relieved of your duties.
You and your men are to return to Langogne at once.
Sir Beauterne, Master at Arms, is on his way.
His mandate is to kill this ferocious wolf.
He alone is authorized to hunt in the diocese.
Gentlemen.
Then I'm forgiven?
I was curious to know my "totem".
Is that the word?
I would guess... mermaid.
Are you never serious?
I'll ask your redskin.
And the Beast? Have you spotted it?
Forbidden subject?
My absurd assumptions would get me laughed out of King's Garden.
If I said the Beast is flesh and iron mixed, that it's possessed of reason and may disappear at will, what would you say?
Country air has affected your mind.
It's eluding me.
After three months, you expect to have finished?
Should the Beast have surrendered?
Perhaps it's afraid of you.
Am I so fearsome?
A hard-won victory will be better savored.
Is it true you're going to Africa?
For now it's but a naturalist's winter dream.
And you? Ever yearn for new horizons?
A lady has more duties than yearnings.
Do you see Sardis over there?
Are you being watched?
He's there to protect me.
Alone with you,
God knows what could happen.
Let's go inside.
Our priest might catch cold.
Good evening, sir.
- You're in love.
- I don't know.
I do.
The cards?
I've never needed them for you.
So let's drink.
To Mademoiselle de Morangias.
- What?
- Her brother was here.
You slept with him?
Him? He can't stand to be touched.
He watches, he drinks, then he talks in his sleep, like all men.
Do I?
What do I say?
"Again!"
Know how Florentine women keep their husbands home?
Each morning, they give them a slow poison, and every evening the antidote.
That way, when the husband sleeps away he has a very bad night.
You needn't resort to that.
Anyway, we aren't married.
Make way for Antoine de Beauterne,
Royal Master at Arms, who has come to rid the country of the Beast!
- I am Grégoire de Fronsac.
- Yes, Buffon's envoy.
The naturalist embalmer.
M. de Beauterne is at the Intendant's.
Come at 2:00.
His Majesty asked my advice about your report.
Complicated fables indeed!
I believe the Beast is a wolf.
I shall go out for it tomorrow.
I would rather you didn't come.
Why is that?
The King left this affair to me, and to my sole discretion.
I have no need of you to end it.
On the table there's a letter from Buffon and our beloved king.
I'm at his service, but believe me this is not...
I've read your report. Trouble yourself no longer with this Beast.
It's my affair.
You may go.
Come here.
A woman from Lorciére.
It attacked her coming from the fair.
We lost it near Mt. Mouchet, vanished in the wood.
The Beast has struck near St. Alban.
God has punished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!
I don't believe anymore than you in...
Its snout is longer, its teeth are like knives.
My only certainty is that this is no wolf.
- The Beast is no animal.
- A rabid wolf will attack.
How do we catch it?
No animal has iron fangs.
Sir, come at once!
I saw him!
He was dispensing poison and saying satanic incantations!
God only knows for how long!
Let him go.
An Indian remedy, Father.
Only our prayers may save her.
But she was...
A miracle!
What happened to your brother?
- A man with the Beast?
- The child is incoherent.
Yes, the Beast is dead.
No cure for 10 shots in the gut.
We've brought your things. Begin at once.
- It's not the Beast.
- Get to work!
- Ridiculous!
- M. de Beauterne is coming.
Watch your lip!
Hello. Leave us!
Don't you like my Beast?
What is this? You know it's not the Beast.
Its jaw is twice as large.
You can fix that here.
What?
Paris awaits. I have only this wolf.
So make me a Beast.
- To fool the King?
- No, Fronsac.
I carry out his will.
You'd be wise to do the same.
Is that a threat, sir?
At my age? Come now, you know me.
You're too smart for threats.
Do your duty, the King will be grateful.
Otherwise, he'll be quite upset.
You have what you need.
I'm counting on you.
Good-bye for now.
Good evening, my unhappy friend.
Are you sad to be returning to Paris?
The Beast is dead. You should be happy.
Do you want me to tell you a secret?
I collect them.
Beauterne killed a simple wolf.
He is an impostor.
And I am his accomplice.
Come, let's drink to our betrayals.
You saw nothing.
You are no longer welcome at the castle, sir!
Tell Mademoiselle de Morangias that I am here!
- I've already told you...
- Speak of the devil!
My son and I were just talking about you, sir.
It is your daughter I have come to visit.
- I'm afraid that is impossible.
- I insist.
Let him come in, Mother.
Be careful, Jean-François, you know how these matters end.
Leave us.
Sir, Marianne is suffering.
I don't understand.
However, Fronsac, you are not a stranger to what ails her.
Where is she?
Follow me.
So kind of you to visit.
Mademoiselle, what ails you?
I am to return to Paris, but that depends on you.
Have a safe journey.
I warned you, Fronsac.
You have offered me only one present, and here I give you two for your collection.
I've been warned about men of your kind.
Men of my kind, mademoiselle, never condemn people without having listened to them.
I don't know how this happened, but let me explain.
You needn't bother.
Please, sir, don't make this more difficult than it already is.
Admit that you were not the man for my sister, and leave it at that, no regrets.
Do you believe that she will remain your nursemaid all her life?
Are you not happy to leave our province in one piece?
In other times, I would have you flogged for looking at her.
Times change.
Not everywhere, Fronsac.
In any case, not here.
I'm sorry!
Will you hit me too if I tell you to leave?
Good-bye.
Have no regrets. He didn't deserve you.
On this historic day, thanks be to Sir Grégoire de Fronsac of King's Garden.
The Beast's end is partly his.
But it is mostly thanks to Your Majesty.
Let it be known:
In your sole person resides sovereign power.
Only a beast could ignore it.
That Beast is no more.
I have only little merit.
With your power bestowed upon me,
I merely needed to appear, and the Beast laid down its arms.
What is this?
Beauterne's carried out his orders, as we all should.
- What orders?
- Mine.
This is M. Mercier,
Special Counsel to His Majesty for domestic matters.
It was his idea to send Antoine de Beauterne.
You're to thank for this prompt victory?
I admire your scruples, but it's for the greater good.
Have you read this?
It's no longer for sale, but you may keep it.
It was banned?
A fable undermining the King.
We'd have had trouble if we waited longer.
People are so gullible.
Better to lie than let lies be spread?
Truth is a complicated thing.
One must govern with simplicity.
No more Beast, no more problem.
It'll go on killing.
No one will hear of it again.
That's what counts.
I was forgetting.
His Majesty is most thankful.
It's said you want to go to Africa.
In six months, a schooner sets sail for Senegal.
If you wish, you'll be aboard.
Of course, we'll never speak of Gévaudan again.
Well, Fronsac?
Marianne de Morangias?
Madame, I don't believe I know you.
We both have a friend in common.
What are you doing here?
It's useless to hide behind that veil.
Your perfume is not that of a Lady.
Grégoire de Fronsac has only loved one woman.
It is your name he calls out in his sleep.
He will soon be leaving on a long journey.
Just perfect.
When you see Fronsac, do not tell him anything of our meeting, or you will lose him forever.
Who was that, my child?
No one.
That one, in the hold with the others.
These two, in my cabin.
Be careful, they're fragile!
Hello, Fronsac!
Hey, Marquis!
Good to see you!
Not as good as all that.
Two days after you left, the crimes began again.
The King no longer sends soldiers.
I can't find volunteers for the hunt.
I can't do a thing.
I don't know how to catch it.
Frankly, it wasn't entirely your talents I was thinking of.
Mani found the child.
Just one hunt, Fronsac!
You'll be back within the month.
Impossible! The King has forbidden us from returning.
- The King will not know.
- So you think.
Is the King's peace of mind worth all these sacrifices?
You won't change my mind.
- Do you want to bet?
- The last time we made a bet, you lost!
I would have preferred not to use this, but, here, it's from Marianne.
And Mani?
My friend!
How are you?
- We're leaving for the hunt, Mani.
- This time, we'll do it your way.
So, my friend, any good news?
Best in the world, Marquis.
In Gévaudan, the crimes continued,
but officially, the Beast was dead.
What really happened appears in no history book.
It was carefully kept quiet.
Is he welcoming us?
He wants to help us.
Go to the castle. I'll meet you there.
What is it?
Where do Jeanne and Pierre Roulier live?
Go straight on.
It's the last house in the village.
This is Jeanne, my nanny.
Pierre, fetch some wine.
I'm being watched.
They might know you're back.
I'll tear you away from your family.
I can't bear my mother, nor Jean-François.
I want to leave.
In a week, we'll go to Paris.
Why wait?
The hunt. I promised the Marquis.
You didn't return for me?
Look out!
Leave! Slowly, don't run!
Over here! Look at me!
Come here!
Go, Marianne!
What is this? Open up!
My God!
Tell me, do you really think we'll find this Beast?
We're short of men.
Mani knows what he's doing.
I'm hunting a man.
A man?
The Beast is a weapon serving a sick mind.
- Wouldn't a killer be secretive?
- Right.
The Beast's first mystery is its fame.
Its master wants people to talk, to be afraid and make noise.
How's that?
This book is sold all over.
It says the Beast is punishing the King's indulgence in philosophers.
Who wrote it?
I don't know, but the Beast has a master. I want him.
Perhaps your weapon will help... but only in your hands!
And you, Mani?
Which will you choose?
Mani doesn't like firearms.
Too much noise and smoke. Bad smell.
All will go well, Grandfather.
Don't worry. We're well prepared.
Tell me of the Americas.
Will you never go back?
Not all my memories are fond ones.
And Mani? Does he miss his tribe?
His tribe is no more.
Before our attack, the pox had decimated his village.
Orders were to execute survivors.
The women, and the children, too.
Only Mani escaped.
- How?
- We needed an interpreter.
I was to teach him our language.
Then I found him slaying the Captain.
Why didn't you turn him in?
Know how the Captain waged battle?
He gave his scouts infected hospital sheets.
The Iroquois bought them.
Three weeks later, we'd mop up.
- And that's our war?
- In any case, that is how we lost.
Where did he go?
- To speak to the trees.
- Trees?
Trees can speak.
The white man cannot listen or see.
See what, Mani?
Want to learn?
- What's this?
- An Indian sacrament.
At your own risk, Marquis.
- What's it do?
- Depends on the person.
They say they see the invisible.
So, Mani?
The Beast is in the forest.
The wolves will help us.
I see no better.
This night we shall dance the dance of blood.
And the Beast shall come to us with the sun.
It has no effect on me.
That night, Mani invoked spirits
in a language even Fronsac couldn't understand.
And the wolves brought them to the Beast.
Don't worry, I'll fix this for you.
Don't worry, girl. I'll see to you.
I'll take care of you.
Thomas is asleep. A close call.
I'm sorry for the Indian.
What is there?
Tell me, what manor is this?
I need to know.
It's a domain. A hunting ground.
Sir, you need rest.
Hurry! Fire!
He's over there! Come on!
Fronsac returned by Mani's side.
His revenge had hardly begun, but according to Indian custom, he must be sent to his ancestors at dawn's first light.
What do you want?
Too much blood has been spilled.
You're in great peril here.
I have business to attend to.
Is it worth your life?
How long have you known?
I don't know what you mean.
Come now, Sardis. How?
How did it get this far?
No one will believe you.
Go away, Sardis.
May God save you.
May the Devil take you.
You're under arrest by order of the Intendant.
Please offer no resistance.
That's ridiculous!
- A lady to see you.
- Later. Tonight.
Get up! You've got company.
- Aren't I in solitary confinement?
- Depends for whom.
Sorry.
Bring your guest some dinner.
- How?
- Many owe me favors.
Help me. I must write to the King.
You'd be hung before he read your letter.
I've yet to stand trial.
Here.
- Tell me of the Beast.
- A trained animal.
Cloaked in armor. I wounded it.
Why the sudden interest?
Two years ago, a confidential letter from Sardis was given to the Pope.
It spoke of a newly founded secret society whose purpose was to spread and defend, by any means, the word of the Church.
The Brotherhood.
Sardis, he was using the Beast.
The Beast is a warning to the King:
"Heed the power of the Lord or suffer Apocalypse."
Members are known as "wolves of God."
It serves the Church?
Sardis serves only himself.
These wild times have made him mad.
The group is beyond Rome's control.
In whose employ are you?
My duties include never letting that be known.
And you, you know quite enough.
Mademoiselle de Morangias, what an honor.
How fares the Countess? Please sit down.
And your father? Still in cure?
He's too fond of rich food.
Sir, you've arrested Fronsac.
How far a man such as he has fallen!
- He's neither thief nor murderer.
- Really?
Hear me, he must have had his reasons.
- If they killed the Indian...
- That's another matter.
You don't avenge a savage with Christian blood.
May I visit him?
Impossible.
Very well.
Paris shall hear of this.
You don't understand.
Fronsac passed away... last night.
In any case, they'd have hung him.
Upon reflection, he was lucky.
He was in your custody.
Perhaps he choked.
Or he caught a blight in the mattress.
You're lying. You're all lying!
Courage, child, it's the will of God.
Come.
- I'll escort you home.
- She needs rest.
- Let me alone!
- It's over.
He's already reeking.
Bury him quickly in an unmarked grave.
She threatened to go to the King.
That girl is dangerous.
Fronsac was buried that very night,
long before news of his death reached Paris.
No one knew what secrets he took to his grave.
For several days, the Beast did not strike.
But the sudden disappearance of its most dauntless foe
seemed to be a dark omen.
Hurry.
Father, I'm guilty. I have sinned.
Forgive me.
Marianne, day and night I think of her.
I hear her heart beating in my chest.
I want her on our side, Sardis.
- The Lord is testing you.
- I can't endure it.
The visions!
These accursed visions torment me!
Deliver me, Father!
I beg of you!
There's only one remedy for this evil.
Don't drink, Sister.
They want to kill you.
But I won't let them.
Who does?
Who?
We're going to leave, just you and me.
How about America?
You've hurt me, but I forgive you.
Please. What are you doing?
Stay.
- Would I harm you?
- Please stay away from me.
I need you.
You saved me when I was sick, no one else.
The sight of your face ended my nightmares.
Your hand on my brow chased away demons.
You can't imagine all I've done to keep you near.
I beg of you, don't shun me.
Why?
Do I disgust you?
You don't frighten me. Get out.
Because of this?
Never fear.
From now on, I'll take care of you.
Look.
No one knows. Only Sardis and I.
Leave! Get out!
Why?
You're not my brother.
Another man returned from Africa.
That's true, but it was for you I left.
All this would not be, if not for you.
All this?
It's your odor that foul thing smelled on me.
We're of the same blood.
When father comes back, he'll kill you!
Unless I kill him?
He's hindered us so long.
Go ahead. Do it, go ahead!
Why didn't you?
Is it so difficult? Look.
- Stop!
- Then you love me?
I love you!
Brothers, the Lord has told me the Beast will return to herald the return of values to our decadent kingdom.
And in a reborn France we shall be invisible princes, for God is with us.
The people cannot fathom the Lord's wrath.
The unjust censure of the King cannot withstand the public's rage.
When that wrath is at a climax, we'll bargain with the King.
If he couldn't repress one, imagine if, from all over the realm, other beasts burst forth.
The hour is at hand to reap what we've sewn.
Let us read from Malachi:
"The word of the priest is the depository of science,
"and from his mouth is sought knowledge of the law,
"for he is the angel of the Lord of Hosts."
"He who adores the Beast
"shall drink the Lord's wrath.
"He shall be tormented in the fire and brimstone
"before the angels,
"and the smoke shall rise in the century of centuries."
I've come back to name you:
Pierre-Jean Laffont.
Geneviéve de Morangias.
Maxime Des Forêts.
Gontrand de Moncan. Henri Sardis.
Jean-François de Morangias.
Amen!
Fire!
Bastards! You're all under arrest!
Ghost or no ghost...
I'll split you in two.
See? No need to hold back.
I never intended to.
Too late. The Beast is immortal now.
Perhaps, but you are not!
- You trained the Beast.
- How'd you know?
You use silver bullets.
Marianne, look!
Marianne's not here, madman.
You've united us forever.
Line the bastards up!
Who do you think you are?
Look at them!
Not so high and mighty now!
Get back!
- He's dead.
- Now it's certain.
And Sardis?
Wherever he runs, we'll find him.
Or the mountain will take him.
Shall we celebrate properly?
You've killed me once.
The better to revive you.
I could introduce you in Rome.
Will you come with me?
Too late.
I like you, Fronsac.
You make me forget all my duties.
Leave, before I change my mind.
- Marquis, what is it?
- Marianne.
I've had her brought home. She's dying.
Get out! Go away! All of you!
Wake up!
Forgive me.
I love you.
Years passed, but Grégoire de Fronsac
and Marianne de Morangias never left my memory.
The world that made the Beast is dying away,
and I must hasten, for my story, too, is ending.
I remember Fronsac and I at Jean-François' hideaway
where the Beast awaited its final hour.
The old healer told us all he knew.
Jean-François brought an animal back from Africa,
who had a litter.
Only one cub was kept, the strongest.
Patiently and cruelly,
he'd trained it to be vicious.
Thus died the Beast of Gévaudan.
And I, Thomas d'Apcher,
am probably the last to know the whole truth.
The Chevalier invited me to Africa,
but my land needed rebuilding.
My duty was to my countrymen.
I've often thought of Grégoire and Marianne
throughout these peaceful years that have brought me to this age.
I never saw them again,
but I like to think they lived happily, far from here.
Based on Journal of My Life
During the French Revolution
During the Revolution,
at the end of Rue Miromesnil,
a new street
north of the Champs-Elys<b>é</b>es,
stood the townhouse
of Grace Elliott.
The "Grand Lady",
as she was known,
was born in 1760
of an old Scottish family.
She studied in France,
married SirJohn Elliott, then left him
to become the mistress
of the Prince of Wales,
the future George IV,
to whom she bore a daughter.
Then she was noticed
by Prince Philippe, Duke of Orleans
who brought her to France in 1786.
Their affair ended
but they remained close friends.
The Duke had two houses in Paris.
One at Palais-Royal,
the other on the site
of today's Parc Monceau,
not far from Rue Miromesnil.
Pretty posies!
Fresh water!
Who wants a drink?
Returning from England, the Duke paid me a visit on the eve of Federation Day, one year after the Bastille fell.
Our enemies will fall confounded
and we'll sing alleluia.!
Good times are coming...
We all swore to stand united.
The whole universe will be told
of this glorious oath our hearts uphold.
Long live Orleans!
Long live the Nation!
"Master Fox, attracted by the scent, addressed him thus,
"Master... Mister..."
"Mr. Crow, good day."
"Mr. Crow, good day.
You are handsome, I say!"
"What a beautiful bird!
You are handsome, I say!"
The Duke of Orleans.
Show him in.
Prince!
What joy!
I heard you had arrived, but...
I didn't expect you so soon.
Yet your journey seemed to last a century.
Letters from England.
Curtsy to the Prince.
What's your name?
Julie.
That's all for now.
The lesson's over. Go and play.
Forgive her, she has no social graces.
I haven't finished dressing but you may stay.
Take a seat.
I have been taking care of that little girl.
Her mother lost her husband and lives in great hardship with four other children.
Your devotion to the poor is a constant wonder, my dear.
It exceeds the bounds of Christian charity and revolutionary fraternity combined.
I deserve no credit.
She is the light of my life, my only consolation for my own daughter's absence.
Did you see her?
She's become a real beauty.
She asks for you.
All of London is waiting for you.
The sweetness of life there takes us back a few years.
Why didn't you stay longer, my friend?
I came back to... dispel certain rumors, alas!
Word has it that I dared not return.
At the Federation rally tomorrow, they'll be surprised to see me walk in the procession.
It's the best way to quash the rumors.
I won't be mistaken for a cowardly <b>é</b>migr<b>é</b>.
Cowardly, yes.
However, their fears are founded.
But you, my fearless friend, have stayed.
I am an <b>é</b>trangère.
These past two days,
I have guests from the country here for the parade.
As you know, new ideas leniently implemented by the lawful authorities, have my full approval.
The "lawful authority"
- Louis, in this case - does not implement them.
He hates all friends of Liberty, commencing with me.
How do you know?
He keeps insulting me.
Remember, after the Bastille fell
I traveled to Versailles to ask him for my orders.
He answered me harshly,
"I have nothing to say to you."
He was right!
I've always felt more alien to him than to my cook or coachman.
He is your cousin.
My family is the Nation.
I am more French than Bourbon.
The whole court is colluding with the enemy.
You sound like a Jacobin.
Yes, and I highly approve of my son's desire to join their club.
Surely no Orleans belongs with them.
We belong wherever there are patriots.
See where your false friends lead you!
Excepting the Duke of Biron.
I've asked him to dine with us.
I'm delighted.
His only fault is his weakness.
At least he is loyal to you.
But... the Talleyrands... the Mirabeaus... those turncoats have left you at the mercy of monsters, while Merlin de Douai and your rascally cohort, Laclos, who has brought your party into such disrepute...
Laclos has an outstanding mind and deep insights.
He's the author of a filthy novel.
I have little regard for the book.
It's profoundly boring.
It sent me to sleep.
Granted, I do not read much.
I'm no judge of letters.
Grace...
I'm so happy to see you again.
I cherish your company and yet, alas, you have nothing but harsh truths for me.
But they are not true.
You've been misled... although...
I trust you are sincere.
The Royalists have turned your head.
The Sansculottes have turned yours even more.
You'll be your own downfall.
Grace, listen.
Hurry back to your homeland.
Take my prudent advice.
Your revolutionaries will be your downfall, and with it, the King's.
You could save him.
Save Louis!
He's digging his own grave by defying the sovereign people's will.
What a way to speak!
The only sovereign I know is the King, no one else.
You are a proud Scotswoman who loves nothing but kings and princes.
I love the king of my adopted country.
I care little for Louis.
I love my Queen.
I detest her.
I wish I could break her influence over you.
She is a lady of great refinement.
I've never heard her say a single word against you.
And despite my friendship with you, she trusts me completely.
She sent you to Belgium...
- You know!
- I have spies.
But I won't tell a soul.
I know. But honestly, some people in Paris should hold their tongues.
We live in a world of... slanderers.
I do not believe them.
I don't believe what they say about the Queen, or about you.
For they slander you too.
I don't believe you fomented the October riots by bribing the French Guards.
Nonsense!
All lies, spread by La Fayette and his clique.
While the Queen... No, enough!
I respect your fondness for an undeserving monarchy.
I blame no one for their opinion of the Revolution if they respect mine... but I'm more tolerant than either side, alas!
Grace,
I implore you, go back home.
There is still time before events get out of hand.
I love you and I want you safe.
I'll miss you cruelly, but go!
As long as I can see the Queen, even occasionally,
I feel it's my duty to stay here.
The day of August 10th
Nanon!
Death to the Austrian woman!
Lord, they're at it again like last month, when they forced the red cap on the King's head.
Everyone's at the Tuileries Palace!
All the working folk and the delegates from the countryside!
Good times are coming.!
String up the aristocrats.!
It's the King's last hour!
Mr. And Mrs. Let-them-eat-cake are goners!
Hush!
What about their Swiss Guards?
They're done for.
I saw them run like rabbits!
Your Louis will hang within the hour.
Quiet, or I'll tell Madame.
She'd do better to keep out of sight!
The Tuileries Palace is on fire.
The rioters massacred the Swiss Guards.
My God!
How's the King?
With the Queen and their children, he was seen fleeing to the Assembly.
I hope they won't be thrown to the mob.
Your cook says they'll arrest all aristocrats.
She's always talked nonsense before.
Now, anything is possible...
If only I'd gone to Meudon!
Maybe there's still time.
HaveJustin prepare the carriage.
The city barriers are closed.
No one can get out.
Then we can only pray.
If I may suggest...
We could go through the Duke's garden.
To reach Meudon?
We'd have to walk halfway around Paris.
And I refuse to implicate the Duke.
I suspect today's rioters, like those ofJune 20th, are Marat's henchmen and no friends of the Duke.
Does Madame remember Baptiste, the doorman?
He lives behind the Invalides.
In Paris.
Yes, but there's a breach in his garden wall.
Long live the Nation!
Long live the Nation!
Please step up, Madame.
Let us part here.
I'll go on alone.
Give me that.
You must stay in Paris to mind the house.
Tell my people I'm in Meudon.
They mustn't think I've fled abroad.
God help you.
God help you, especially.
Poor Madame!
What a calamity!
You came alone, on foot?
Jeannette!
Weren't you afraid of being waylaid, alone at night, on the road?
I saw worse in Paris.
Nevertheless, at the foot of Meudon hill,
I heard a man's footsteps which scared me more than the murderous mob on Place Louis XV.
I went and hid behind a log.
Didn't he see you?
If he had, what would have befallen me?
He may have been a harmless peasant.
What are you up to?
Give me that!
Madame isn't here.
I'm to deliver it in person!
Madame Elliott?
I am she.
From Madame Meyler.
"Please obtain a travel permit
"for you and your manservant...
"and come alone to Paris,
"where someone badly needs your help."
Grace Georgina Elliott, née Dalrymphe.
Spell it how you like.
Darlymphe,
English citizen, you may go to Paris with one servant, but be back by midnight.
Halt!
"The citizen may go to Paris with one servant, but must be back by midnight."
Where is the servant?
I sent him back to get... papers I need in Paris.
Follow me.
Elliott,
English citizen...
With a servant?
Yes, but I told him...
She sent him back for some papers she forgot.
Let her wait for him, but not too long.
She must be home before the permit expires.
Tell me, milady, what possessed you to enter Paris now?
The jails are full of corpses, the streets are awash with blood...
Everyone is desperate to leave town, and you want to come in?
My mother is dying.
I need to be with her.
Very well. You are brave.
You're English.
Why aren't you in England?
My mother and I have lived in France for six years.
I have two houses here.
I feel so French that I transferred all the money I had in England.
Be warned that Paris is not safe for enemies of Liberty.
What's going on?
They're taking out some blackcoats.
A conspiracy.
- Taking out?
- Who knows?
- I do!
- No one saw them.
Look in the cart.
They're taking a trip to Vaugirard cemetery.
Feet first, and some in pieces.
They're short of room!
Is it the Queen?
It's her favorite,
Princess de Lamballe.
Princess de Lamballe!
Hey, beautiful!
Madame's crying?
For the pretty head on the stake?
She must be lonely up there.
Want to keep her company?
Come on, aristo. Get out!
No! You are mistaken.
I'm weeping for my dying mother.
I'll miss her last words.
Look, I'm not an aristo.
I'm English.
English and a patriot.
All right, be off.
We're not after Englishwomen yet.
Clarisse!
Grace! You're here at last.
I'm here. With difficulty.
What is it? You're crying.
A horrible thing...
I shiver to speak of it.
A gang of fanatics carrying a stake with... poor Princess de Lamballe's head on it.
Princess de Lamballe?
Oh, God!
They'd slaughtered her at the Force prison and then had the barbarity to drag her remains to the Temple prison and show them to our poor Queen.
What times are we living in?
Those "Enlightenment Philosophers" should open their eyes!
I'll send for a cordial.
Prudence!
Quick, bring two glasses and some vintage wine.
But I'm not here to cry.
Whom do you wish me to help?
The Marquis de Champcenetz, governor of the Tuileries.
Who?
Champcenetz?
Yes, I think you know him.
Indeed... we met at the Duke of Orleans' before the Revolution, but... we weren't particularly close.
Especially since the Duke, to whom he owes his career, now hates him for being ungrateful.
Grace, forgive me.
He led me to believe that he was one of your friends.
Don't imperil yourself for a stranger whom perhaps you dislike.
I'm somewhat obligated to him.
He found me my house in Meudon when he commanded the chateau there.
But today, even if he were my worst enemy...
I'm very surprised.
I heard he was dead.
He got away.
When the King fled to the Assembly against the Queen's will, he jumped out through a window and lay down in the garden among the Swiss Guards' corpses.
A National Guard found him and lent him his coat.
He's hiding in my attic.
One moment.
Don't get up.
My respects, Madame.
How are you?
My leg is badly wounded,
I have a fever.
But it's better now.
I sought refuge with Lord Gower, the English ambassador, but he informed me through his secretary that as a public official, he could not see me.
So then... I remembered in the past... you introduced me to Madame who had a secluded house on the outskirts of Paris.
The doorman thought I was English.
I gave my name as Mr. Smith.
Thank God, he let me in.
We should leave for Meudon at nightfall.
I have a permit for my manservant.
You will impersonate him.
Do not get up.
Are the streets safe?
I wouldn't risk it!
You wish to go out?
No, I'm seeing Madame to her carriage.
All's quiet around here but further on there's trouble!
Thank you.
I'll tell my driver to be careful.
I won't be long.
Citizen, we're under orders to let no one out.
But I have to be back in Meudon by midnight.
Orders from Paris and Meudon are different.
I'm not a Parisian.
I'm not running away.
I just want to go home.
I beg you, for God's sake...
Sorry, they're my orders.
And don't try another barrier.
Find yourself a bed or you'll be arrested at 10 o'clock when the house searches start.
Vehicles must be off the street.
They won't let us out.
I feared as much.
Drive on.
Where to, Madame?
The Allées des Invalides.
What's wrong with you, fellow?
He's drunk.
He's still in his cups.
Shame on you, rascal!
I'll walk you to your door.
The sot can lean on me.
I don't want my lady friend to see him like this.
I'll wait till he's sobered up.
I'm going home.
I don't want to be arrested for you two.
Thirty sous.
Take care!
The patrols will soon be out.
I feel better.
The air is cooler here.
- Let's make haste.
- Careful!
They're going to guard the wall.
We're done for!
Don't let me jeopardize you.
Give me up.
You'll save one life at least, yours.
I shan't even save mine.
They'll think I'm your accomplice.
Then I'll go alone.
If you're still strong enough, let us turn back.
Where to?
My house at Monceau.
I am exhausted.
Keep walking slowly.
Act sick, drag your leg.
That won't be difficult.
Faster, old man!
It's after curfew.
Thank heavens it wasn't a patrol.
They're going back to the section-house.
We'll meet others, more dangerous.
I don't want you caught.
Abandon me.
Try a little harder.
Beyond Place Louis XV, we'll find darkness.
It'll take us hours.
No matter.
I undertook to rescue you.
I shall do so or perish with you.
Let that be clear!
Look!
There's Pulchérie, my cook, in the doorway.
She is a Jacobin.
We can't trust her.
I've an idea. Let's go to the Duke's garden in Monceau.
It's nearby.
If he finds out we're there, he will say nothing for your sake.
I don't like it.
We would have to pass my doorway or go around and risk meeting a patrol.
Hide here. I'll go home and see what I can do.
Enemies of the people are spreading rumors...
Madame, what a surprise!
Did you come on foot?
As you can see.
From Meudon?
I took a cab to the barriers.
With all the horrors now in Paris,
I felt uneasy in the country.
Don't stay out here.
The patrol is coming.
Pulchérie,
I'm starving.
Bring me some roast fowl and salad.
The larder is empty.
Go wake up the innkeeper.
He'll probably charge me ten louis.
But there's a curfew.
I'll be arrested!
They won't bother you.
You're known at the section-house.
Go quick or I'll dismiss you.
The patrol!
They're coming down the street.
All right, let's wait.
Forgive me, Madame...
Monsieur, who are you?
How dare you enter my house at such an hour in times like these?
Have mercy.
I turned myself in this afternoon.
I was acquitted and allowed to go home.
As I passed your door,
I thought I'd greet you.
Greetings, Monsieur, but should I believe you?
He's lying.
You're Champcenetz, aren't you?
The Palace governor.
A wanted man, ready for the scaffold.
You nasty aristocrat!
I'd turn you in if it weren't for Madame.
Go on! Be off!
Please leave at once.
You'll have us all arrested for conspiracy.
What are you waiting for?
Over the garden wall.
I'm not sure he can.
Help him.
Get moving, Pulchérie.
I'm hungry.
Now is the time.
The patrol's away.
They'll have gone down Rue Verte.
What if she turns us in?
Where's Nanon?
Gone to ask after her son.
He may be dead.
One misery after another!
I'll be gone, Madame.
Don't endanger yourself.
He needs to lie down.
Come to my bedroom.
Does Madame have any alcohol?
Yes! I think there's some left.
I've an idea, but I doubt
Madame will like it.
Under the circumstances,
Madame won't mind if I am blunt.
If the patrol comes, as it will, they'll search the house from top to bottom.
I see only one hiding place, between the mattresses.
If we pull the middle one out, we can make a space beside the wall.
But he'll suffocate!
Let's try it.
Your idea is no good.
The bed looks rumpled.
It's suspicious.
They'll want to inspect it.
If I lie in it myself, they won't think anyone is hiding there.
Quick, let's not wait for Nanon.
Help me undress.
Good night, Justin.
Who is it?
Pulchérie.
Wait.
All I found was some bread and paté.
Some warm wine is coming.
That Champcenetz, what nerve!
He almost had us hanged, or guillotined, as they do now.
I'd love to see his scrawny head roll!
I'll watch from the front row!
- Forgive me Madame, but...
- I know.
Your son?
I saw him. He's alive.
God be praised!
He spared us that sorrow, at least.
The patrol!
Go and see.
Can you hear? They're coming.
Are you suffocating?
Not if I lie on my side.
Does it make a bigger hump?
Not if I rearrange the sheet.
It's hot.
It makes sense if I push it aside.
Can you breathe?
But I'm hot.
My God! Here they come.
They've all come in.
The municipal officers want to see Madame.
Let them come in and search.
I've nothing to hide.
Won't you get up?
No, I'm too weary.
Come in, then!
What is this?
House search, citizen.
By order of the Commune.
You're suspected of harboring
Mr. Champcenetz.
He came here after 11 o'clock, but I showed him out.
We'll see. Please get up.
Must I?
Well, not necessarily.
Not before so many men.
If they'll kindly leave, I'll oblige.
Very well. About turn!
Isn't she pretty?
I'll help her dress!
- I'll take her feet!
- Let me see!
Silence!
Stand back!
The lady is English.
Don't be a disgrace to the Nation.
Get out!
I'm all a tremble.
Your visit frightened me.
But now that I see how kind, obliging and considerate you are, and knowing I'm innocent,
I am not the least alarmed.
I shall arise and take you in person around the house.
No need, citizen.
No one we've seen tonight has been half so civil.
Stay in bed.
I'll be careful with your furnishings.
You, search the room.
You, look upstairs.
You, search the gardens.
How are you, sweetheart?
Hands off!
How about it?
What are you up to?
Out!
You won't find him.
Madame threw him out.
You can believe Pulchérie.
You know her devotion to the people.
She'll tell you how I received him and sent him away directly.
Madame was outraged by his impudence.
Would she harbor so great a foe of the Duke?
Why didn't you have him arrested at once?
Though I dislike him,
I won't denounce anybody.
Then you're a bad citizen.
A patriot's duty is to inform on criminals.
Anyway, we'll find him before tomorrow.
We're wasting our time here.
Good night, citizen Elliott.
Let's go, quick!
Will that be all, Madame?
Certainly. Good night, Pulchérie.
Who is it?
Nanon, Madame.
Come in.
They've gone.
Thank heaven!
It's over, Madame, don't worry.
I know.
Lock the door, quick!
He was here!
And you dared! Heavens!
I'm glad I didn't know!
What courage!
And how daring of you to offer to get up!
What if they had accepted?
They did not.
But I deserve no credit.
It is true, I was feeling doomed, but hearing you groan beneath the mattress
I suddenly recovered my wits and God gave me more courage than I ever had before.
When I accepted without much thought the task Madame Meyler asked of me,
I had no idea it would be so perilous.
I naively hoped I would be helping... forgive me, Sir... a closer friend than you.
I confess that when the patrol arrived,
I briefly regretted not having granted your wish and abandoned you to your fate.
But under the threat of those wretches and the imminence of danger,
I felt a sort of exaltation which was almost supernatural.
Rather than escape the peril,
I felt the urge to confront it together with all the innocent victims of today's barbarians.
I suddenly felt ashamed of not sharing their fate.
The horror of all the atrocities I've seen today is so strong that surely
I'd have been glad to climb the scaffold.
If you died,
I would have died with you.
By losing the fear of death
I saved myself, and you as well.
Move into my boudoir.
Marquis?
Can you hear me?
Feel him.
Such fever!
If he dies, what will we do?
Don't talk nonsense!
Give him some quinine powder.
See who it is.
His Highness, Madame.
Ask him to wait until I'm dressed.
I'm coming.
Justin, show him in.
I've come for news.
I heard you returned last night.
Please forgive my disarray...
I know how busy you are.
I wouldn't ask you to wait.
It takes me so long to get dressed.
I must look dreadful.
No, you just look worn out.
Are you sick?
I didn't sleep.
The police paid me a call in the middle of the night.
I barely avoided getting up naked in front of forty men.
But their leader,
Jacobin though he was, had not forgotten his manners.
Revolutionaries are not savages.
If you're hiding no one, you have nothing to fear.
But if you were to hide someone, you would be putting yourself in grave danger.
No, I wasn't lucky enough to rescue anyone from last night's horrors.
I must say I wish I had, even at my own peril.
If only these dreadful scenes could cure the admirers of this hideous Revolution!
These scenes are terrible indeed.
But in all revolutions, much blood has been spilt and once begun, it cannot readily be stopped.
Nothing compares in atrocity with what I saw yesterday coming from Meudon, the head of Madame de Lamballe, borne on a stake by a raging mob.
I saw it too.
My poor sister-in-law's head was brought to me as I was dining at Palais-Royal!
This horror is unforgivable.
What harm had she done?
As much as I dislike the Queen,
I was very fond of the Princess.
Don't you believe me?
I do.
I believe you did everything to prevent these murders to no avail.
You thought you'd lead the Revolution but it is leading you where you never wanted to go.
That's true, but we must look further ahead.
The Revolution will be of great use and benefit to our children although it's terrible for us to witness.
I wish you had remained in England when you were there.
I would have liked to.
I've always envied the life of an English country gentleman.
While my enemies taxed me with wishing to be king,
I would willingly exchange my lot and all my fortune for a small estate in England and the privileges of that delightful country, which I hope to see again.
Why not go back there?
Despite the awkwardness of my position here, do you think me perverse enough to go through the streets of Paris these days and not feel the deepest distress?
Nevertheless, two years ago, when La Fayette, whom I mistook for a patriot
- as all Frenchmen did - urged me to leave France for a while,
I told him my life was devoted to serving my country and I could only leave my seat at the Assembly for a position more useful to the Nation.
My friend,
I know you're a good man, even too good, and you let yourself be misled by the semblance of friendship.
But pray go no further!
It is not too late to break loose from the rabble.
Don't let them use your name to commit their loathsome deeds.
All this seems easy to do in your drawing room.
I wish it were so simple in reality.
But...
I am swept along in the torrent, irresistibly.
I am no longer master of my name or my person.
You can be no judge of my situation which is unpleasant, I assure you.
For God's sake, keep your political opinions to yourself.
Plague me no more on this subject, it will be of no use.
I must take my leave.
I'll call again tomorrow morning on my way to the Assembly.
You look very ill.
Should I send my physician?
No, thank you.
I just had a bad night.
You look better.
The quinine is taking effect.
You overheard us?
I could not help it.
Don't apologize.
With respect, I'm surprised you didn't tell the truth.
The Duke seemed well disposed.
He might have spared you the danger of hiding me by letting me escape over his garden wall.
I needed your consent.
The Duke will be back tomorrow.
I'll speak to him.
You seem very preoccupied.
Have there been more horrors?
I know nothing.
I was in Monceau.
But I shall hear news at the Assembly.
I hope the Royal Family is well and decently treated in that horrid Temple prison.
I believe so, although I'm sure they wouldn't pity me if I were in an even worse situation.
How can they keep the poor monarch in prison?
He broke his oath to the Nation.
A worthless oath!
Those people believe in neither God nor Devil.
I myself feel far guiltier than Louis.
He has done nothing.
What have you done?
I'm hiding someone.
Yesterday, you assured me...
Who?
The governor of the Tuileries.
What?
Champcenetz?
Poor woman, there's no greater crime today!
He can't get out of Paris.
He'll be discovered.
You'll both be executed!
Can't you let him out through your garden?
It's surrounded by troops.
Dear Grace, you're risking your life for a miserable cause.
Champcenetz is a good-for-nothing!
He treated me like an ungrateful oaf.
You once gave him command of a regiment.
Against the Queen's wishes.
She wanted it for one of her dependants.
She thought a prince's regiment should go to a man of the highest rank.
Not to a recent nobleman, like your protégé!
I enjoyed annoying her.
I did!
Far from being grateful, he sided with my adversaries.
I'd rather you rescued someone else, not that miserable creature!
Champcenetz would give anything to see you and implore your pardon.
It would be most unwise of me to meet him.
My people would find out.
You could see him without a single person knowing except my chambermaid.
I must hurry to the Assembly.
I deeply regret leaving you in the danger into which your folly has led you.
I'll try to see how I can get this man out, but please keep your politics to yourself.
Would to God you were safely in England!
I fear much for your safety here.
The Duke hates me.
He's gone to have me arrested.
He would doom me, too.
He will let me out only to turn me in.
If you get out,
I'll see you're brought to safety.
How will you know?
The Duke is trustworthy.
Good day, Sir.
Please sit down.
How are you, Madame?
There's color in your cheeks again.
The mere effect of sleep.
Will you have some tea?
I prefer your port wine.
You shouldn't have any.
After such confinement, you seem weak and sickly.
Broth would suit you better.
That might arouse my cook's suspicions.
Your Highness, you are goodness itself.
I must have seemed ungrateful.
I meant to explain my behavior.
Mr. De Champcenetz, no explanations.
We'll not discuss the past or anything other than the predicament of this excellent person who is risking her life to save yours.
She is unwell.
I fear you are both in extreme danger.
I would help you for her sake, but I fear it may not be possible.
You and I must forget that we met before, for we shall never meet in the future.
I hope I will never hear your name again.
Long ago,
I formed my opinion of you.
I'm very annoyed that you can't leave here, for I shan't relax while you're under this roof.
I've said enough.
As soon as the barriers were open,
I took Champcenetz to Meudon...
Some time later...
From the Duke of Orleans.
"The mail coach that calls at Saint Denis
"will take your protégé to Boulogne for 50 louis.
"I enclose a note to the landlord of the Pavillon Royal in St. Denis.
"Your affectionate friend,
Orleans."
Some years later, I learned that
Champcenetz got safely to England.
In mid-January, the Duke de Biron asked me to tell his fortune.
Why bother reading cards?
What can you hope from these terrible times?
You asked me to tell your fortune.
You didn't believe me last time.
I did.
Some of your words came true before I went to war.
But you ignored them.
I wish the Duke and yourself had taken my words more seriously.
The King would have kept his crown and you would still be living in peace and joy instead of spending your life in hiding without a house or carriage for shelter.
I'm not reduced to that.
Why are you in Paris now without a home, forced to stay in a hotel?
To clear my name before the Minister of War.
Clear your name?
Of accusations brought against me by one Rossignol, a revolutionary general under my command.
You naively hope to be believed instead of him?
I'm as good a Republican as he.
I shall convincingly refute the allegations of this madman.
He took part in the
September massacres.
On the contrary, in this day and age, that is his best credential in the eyes of those who dare to judge their king.
The King's trial is the cruelest, most abominable act ever known.
What surprises me most is that not a single French chevalier had the courage to set the Convention on fire, burn all the monsters sitting inside and release the King and Queen from prison.
It saddens me as much as you, but have no fear, at worst, the King will be incarcerated until things settle down.
Indeed, some of the Convention will vote for his death, but... it's a comfort to know that the Duke will not vote.
I have his word for it.
What I wish is that he would vote to free the King.
That's not possible.
He'll never do it.
We must be thankful that he will abstain, lest, if the King were banished, he might incite foreign powers to invade France with all the consequences.
Worse things could happen!
Those consequences scare me less than the thought of the Duke voting to incarcerate the King.
Would that I could convince him!
I'd give my life to spare him that dishonor.
I've tried to make him see the error of his ways.
He seemed persuaded, but he keeps going back to that Madame de Buffon who took my place in his heart and follows the politics of Laclos and Merlin.
Will you grant me a favor?
May I meet the Duke here tomorrow?
When I see him at Madame de Buffon's, he's never alone and I cannot speak my heart to him.
Of course.
I'm expecting him tomorrow at two o'clock. Come then.
My respects, Madame.
I rarely see you these days.
Politics occupy... and preoccupy me.
I'll come straight to the point.
What is your view of this wicked trial at the Convention?
Will you sit with those miscreants?
As a deputy, I must.
How can you sit there and see your king and cousin dragged before that gathering of ruffians who dare to insult him with their interrogations?
I wish I could be at the Convention to hurl my shoes at the President and Santerre!
Restrain yourself, Madame!
I know my duty and need no advice.
I hope that's true, and you'll vote for the King's release.
Certainly, and for my own death!
The Duke will not vote.
The King mistreated him all his life, but he is his cousin.
He'll feign illness and stay at home on the day of the vote to decide the King's fate.
Then, Highness,
I am sure you won't attend the Convention that day.
I beg you, don't.
On my word of honor, I won't.
Although...
I feel the King was guilty of lying to the Nation, nothing can induce me, as his relative, to vote against him.
A meager consolation.
I see no other.
Please excuse me.
In these circumstances
I have little time for myself... and my friends.
We'll meet this evening.
I see our poor prince is in such a predicament that he'll need all his courage of which he has plenty contrary to some people's suggestions.
I do not doubt it either, but... let me be frank.
The Duke is very kind, and of the best character, but no one is less fit to lead a powerful party.
Neither his upbringing nor his brains nor his talents equip him for such high office.
You, his seditious friends, with your flattery, have harmed him.
Who gave him the foolish idea of being elected to the Convention?
He is not a gifted orator.
They've nicknamed him the Mute Deputy.
It is my turn to take my leave.
Since the army has temporarily discharged me, may I invite you to my hotel on Saturday evening with Madame Laurent and General Dumouriez?
We can follow the vote which I hope will be merciful.
Your Girondin friends are deserting the King.
Will you go with them?
Listen, Madame.
I know there are rumors in Paris that I, General Dumouriez, am wavering from side to side.
No.
I am perfectly neutral.
I act as a soldier.
My duty is to serve the army in every way I can.
One way is to delay this trial which is less iniquitous than you think.
Don't say that.
It's an abomination.
Must I be the only one to say it?
With due respect, it's not so much iniquitous as useless.
Instead of disputing the King's fate, this precious time should have been used to prepare the next campaign.
My arguments support yours.
Yours are very cold.
To theJacobins, cold reason weighs infinitely more than the warmth of your love and pity.
Even if it's true that Louis is a lying rascal, which most deputies believe, we'd be fools to behead him.
By foreseeing the worst, one can avoid it.
A death sentence would have the same effect on our neighbors as the Brunswick Manifesto had on our countrymen.
We must not alarm Europe.
We must win the people over with gentleness, not drive them away with terror.
That's why I came back to Paris, to persuade the Convention to change its policy.
The Duke of Orleans entered the Convention at eight o'clock.
He will vote for incarceration.
Good heavens!
I fear worse yet.
So far, there's no majority for death.
Let's hope.
Majority for death, including the Duke's vote.
His too?
He swore to me...
He said,
"Thinking only of my duty,
"convinced that all who violate the people's will should die,
"I vote for death."
361 votes in favor,
360 against.
He tipped the balance.
No. You must add
26 votes for conditional death.
Counting them will make...
I'm ashamed to wear this.
The Nation has disgraced itself.
Let the Republic find the defenders it deserves!
The Republic has better things to do than take revenge on its princes and suspect its generals.
If it condemns us, who will defend it?
I never thought much of Orleans.
Now that he has blood on his hands, my scorn has turned to rightful loathing.
I weep for his children.
In them, I see as many virtues as he has vices.
His cowardice will get him nowhere.
He's in jeopardy like the rest of us, free spirits who strove for the Revolution in its early days.
He won't even have the satisfaction of saving his own honor along with the Revolution's.
We will have no choice but to seek asylum with the enemy.
What?
You're willing to betray France?
What France?
This ragbag of power-hungry scoundrels?
Get me the large basket from the wardrobe.
Get rid of these clothes and jewels.
I don't care how.
Get them out of my sight.
What is it, Madame? The Duke?
He voted for the King's death.
If he had not,
Louis might have been saved.
Death?
Yes. He went to the Convention not to save his cousin but to doom him.
I've never felt so repelled by anyone as he repels me today.
I cannot tolerate to have around me anything that once belonged to him.
Having belonged to him myself,
I cannot bear myself.
Without God and my faith to support me...
Tomorrow morning, pack my trunks while I get a travel permit.
We'll go to Meudon.
The day the King died was the saddest I ever saw.
The day the King died was the saddest I ever saw.
Even the clouds seemed to mourn.
Meudon is on a hill.
With a spyglass one could see Place Louis XV.
There are people there.
Many?
Yes. The crowds are everywhere.
I don't want to see.
Are there soldiers?
I think so. I see blue and red.
Are they moving?
- Who?
- I don't know.
The soldiers, the crowd.
They're all standing still.
Did you hear that?
What's happening?
The people are rebelling!
God be praised!
What can you see?
Nothing.
It looks as if...
What was that?
I don't know.
I know.
And so do you.
Come, let's not stay here.
I don't think it is possible to feel a family misfortune as sharply as I feel the King's death.
Yet, as you see, my eyes are dry.
I wept too much beforehand.
I'll never weep again, not even over my own death which will be soon.
Your death, Madame?
May God preserve and protect you as He did the other night.
God works in mysterious ways.
Now, all we can do is pray.
About six weeks after the King's death,
I fell very ill...
About six weeks after the King's death,
I fell very ill...
The patrol!
Again?
Can't they leave me in peace?
I shan't get up, but I want to see the officer.
Bring him in here.
Greetings, citizen.
Pray what is going on?
House search, by order.
I've been searched twice already this week.
For what? There's nothing here.
The other patrols were from Meudon and Sèvres.
We're from Versailles and more thorough, believe me.
Nobody fools us.
Nor the others.
I have no wish to fool anyone.
I'm a good citizen and no conspirator.
We shall see.
We heard you're hiding flour.
There's a pound of it left in the kitchen.
Please be quick.
Permit me not to accompany you.
As you see, I am ill.
We'll manage by ourselves.
Good health, citizen!
They've gone.
Madame can sleep.
What are they after?
I wish I knew.
In fact, I know.
Nothing.
They're just vying to outdo each other.
Bring me my writing box.
It's nearly midnight.
You need sleep.
I'll sleep in the morning while you take this letter to the doctor.
Would you please be kind enough to inform the Duke that I am feeling better and in answer to his invitation,
I intend to visit him at Palais-Royal the day after tomorrow.
You look puzzled.
Don't think I've forgiven him, but... he sends me such endearing letters daily,
I can't help softening towards him.
He sent me his physician.
He keeps entreating me to visit him as soon as I am well.
I owe it to him.
Besides, I have no choice.
I don't want to die for nothing.
When I rescued Champcenetz, my life didn't matter.
But I don't want to be guillotined on grounds of mere suspicion.
Suspicion of what? Dear God!
Until now,
I never wanted to leave France.
I had made it... my adopted country.
I made its King my King.
Now that he is no more,
I shall return to my England.
The Duke alone has the power to procure me a passport.
He owes me that for ignoring my advice and acting as a criminal.
Now he can redeem himself a little.
You're chilled to the bone.
Would you like some tea to warm you?
For now, just a glass of water.
It's warm in here.
Take a seat.
You look unwell.
I hope you have fully recovered from your cold.
Yes, I'm over it.
But it upsets me to see you after what happened last month.
Your black clothes remind me of those terrible events.
You are mourning the King's death like me, I presume.
I'm mourning my father-in-law, the Duke of Penthièvre.
His death was doubtless hastened by the King's.
Or was it by the cruel way in which the trial was held and your vote for his death?
I dare say he died of heartbreak as I shall.
But your Highness will die like the poor King on the scaffold.
Lord, what a state you're in!
I certainly would not have begged you to come had I remotely suspected it.
The King was sentenced and he is gone.
I could not stop his death.
My vote was not decisive!
- There were other votes...
- I know.
But you promised not to vote.
This is a dismal topic.
You cannot, you must notjudge me.
I know my position.
I could not avoid doing what I did.
I may be more pitiable than you can imagine.
More than anyone in France,
I'm the slave of a faction.
But let's change the subject.
Things could not be worse.
I want you safe in England.
But how to get you out of France?
I have no idea.
If money can buy a passport,
I will pay £500 sterling.
It's all I can do for you now.
Rulers like money, that's what gives me hope.
I'll try to approach their ringleaders.
But Robespierre, the "Incorruptible" whom I never see, is all-powerful.
Your archenemy, I hear.
I have every reason to think so, although... two months ago, when he was planning to have me exiled, he said I had not been an unworthy citizen.
My exile would not be a punishment but a precaution.
Then he won't be displeased to see you leave France.
It would be your wisest move.
Don't you believe it.
They didn't reprieve me from exile just to see me leave voluntarily, or help my friends to leave.
Don't try to fathom the depths of our politicians' minds.
Will you take tea with me now?
Will you be dining in the country?
At my house in Paris.
I'll keep the fires lit for a few days.
I shall avoid returning to Meudon.
The patrols from Versailles and Sèvres are harassing me.
Then stay in Paris, although I fear you won't be treated better here.
I am told you were very reckless during the Revolution.
Be careful from now on!
Keep your thoughts to yourself.
Wear black for the King if you want to, by God, but say you are mourning a relative or you'll be in worse trouble than I can get you out of.
I'd rather you stayed in the country until you can obtain a passport to England.
Personally, I wish I'd never left.
Now I'll never see England again.
I'll call in a few days to report on my progress.
Take a seat, Highness.
I am not staying.
I only came to tell you to forget about the passport.
I've done all I could but I was told by a person in authority, whom I cannot name, that you must not apply for one or even mention England.
You must bear your misfortune like the others and keep quiet.
I fear your house will be searched in the next few days.
I advise you to dispose of any incriminating papers.
In late March or early April, when General Dumouriez fled France...
In late March or early April, when General Dumouriez fled France...
The Duke, Madame.
With two gendarmes.
Two gendarmes?
How now?
What's going on?
What is the meaning of your escort?
I'm not escorted by choice.
It was decided by the powers that be.
Are you under arrest?
Not quite, yet.
But news has come that Dumouriez, whose adjutant is my son, the Duke of Chartres, refuses to obey the Convention's orders.
So he's joining the enemy?
What else can he do except march on Paris?
His troops wouldn't follow.
So my "escort" is due to my son!
I left you a letter he wrote me blaming me for the King's death.
You'd be wise to return it to me.
It will endanger you instead.
Have no fear.
I don't know why I left it with you.
It dishonors me and could have imperiled you.
I advise you to burn all correspondence, however harmless, that you may have put aside.
Whether you like it or not,
I approve of your son's outspoken defense of Louis.
I prefer to be reproached by you than by him.
You're an incorrigible royalist, but... my son's defection, which some call treason, undoes all our family's efforts to support the Revolution.
The Revolution itself annihilated them.
I am left with nothing.
No family, no friends.
I shall remain alone for a short while.
If I must perish,
I shall go willingly, disavowing none of my words, deeds or thoughts, if you don't mind.
I don't only mind,
I am desolate!
I loved you and I still love you.
I hope God loves you and I pray for you as I hope you would for me.
Prayers would save neither of us,
I fear.
Perhaps not in this world, but in the next.
I doubt the Supreme Being is on the side of tyrants.
He is not on the side of perjurers!
Enough of this.
It's too late to philosophize.
Dear Grace, I love you.
I want you to be happy.
I firmly believe that if I die, you will survive.
I am concerned about the money you invested in my affairs.
I will take steps to ensure that after my death the income will be paid to you in England.
So my demise will not ruin you.
Stop talking like this!
Who knows which of us will die first?
I shall.
I hope so, for your sake and mine.
Since nobody loves me any more, why go on living? Adieu.
Prince, despite everything, remember that I love you.
That evening
The guards are here.
Show them in.
Citizen Elliott, the citizen-president of the Roule Section has ordered us to inspect your papers.
My papers? Do you mean...
Every piece of writing.
Especially letters to you.
Are they locked away?
Some are.
- The keys are...
- Leave it to the guard!
Search the writing desk.
You three, inspect the room.
Search every drawer!
The rest of you, follow me.
Those are personal.
But you may read them.
I've nothing to hide.
In English, I suppose!
I don't speak it.
I can translate.
We'll find an interpreter.
Wrap them up.
You there!
Bring that writing box.
Put it here.
No doubt it has secret compartments.
And what is this?
- A letter.
- I realize that.
It is sealed and not addressed to you.
How does it come to be in your possession?
It was sent to me from Naples.
Why was it sent via you?
Gentlemen, as you ought to know,
Naples was blockaded by the French fleet under Admiral Latouche-Tréville.
It was sent to me by his courier.
No matter!
As you ought to know, citizen,
England is at war with us.
Corresponding with the Republic's enemies is an offense punishable by the guillotine!
We have long been suspicious of you.
Now here is the undeniable proof.
Have no doubt, your fate will soon be settled.
What are you saying?
Mr. Fox is your friend.
He's in correspondence with the Surveillance Committee.
Don't confuse him with Mr. Pitt, the Prime Minister, your sworn enemy.
Mr. Fox is a liberal.
The Committee will decide.
Anyway, we have orders to arrest you tonight.
Citizen Grace Georgina Elliott, in the name of the Republic,
I arrest you.
Let me at least take a few clothes.
Be quick!
Fetch me my warmest shawl.
Sit there.
Shapely wench!
Drink this, it'll warm you up.
It's no Burgundy, but you can't be choosy now with no more dukes or princes to protect you.
Without protection, the party's over.
Answer when you're spoken to!
My protection is my conscience.
I've done no wrong.
If you hadn't conspired, you wouldn't be here...
About to dance on Place Louis XV.
We'll watch you.
It'll be a pretty sight, my sweet.
You won't get away.
The guillotine! Ever heard of it?
Good invention, eh?
That's progress.
Makes nice music.
Just three little notes...
Scared, aren't you!
A new dance to learn, my pretty!
The steps are easy.
I'm not afraid. I'm innocent.
You're not my judges! Leave me be!
Leave her alone!
Don't answer them, citizen.
I have the right to say I'm innocent.
If your only charge against me is Mr. Fox's letter,
I'll surely be acquitted.
If you broke the seal and read it, you'd see it was sent not to an enemy of Liberty but to a good patriot.
Why didn't you read it to us?
Shut up!
I don't want to open it.
I cannot. It was entrusted to me.
The Committee will decide.
Take your time!
It's nicer out than in!
Stay here.
The lavatory's over there behind the buffet.
I managed to find you a chair, citizen.
For me?
Why show me such favor?
It was my idea.
I've always thought you were a good citizen.
My sister Roseline is your lace-maker.
I see!
I am here because of a dreadful misunderstanding.
Then you'll soon be free.
Please use this chair, ladies.
It was brought for you, Madame.
You have the privilege of age and you were here before me.
We've stood so far.
We can remain standing.
Let's take turns sitting.
When I'm tired of standing, I'll tell you.
Please, you go first.
I accept.
My poor legs are so swollen,
I fear they will burst.
Aren't you the Duchess of Grammont?
And you, the Duchess of Chatelet?
I am.
And who are you?
If we ever get out of here, we must meet again.
I see you're persecuted for the right cause.
My name is Grace Elliott.
I thought so.
Abbé de Damas often told me of how you risked your life to help a fugitive and of the good advice you gave an unfortunate prince.
You look very light.
Why don't you sit on my lap?
I must be heavy.
Light as a feather.
And you smell so good!
It shields me from the filthy stench in here.
It's my secret.
A small lavender bag that my chambermaid thoughtfully gave me this morning.
Follow me.
Quick.
God be with you.
You too.
"It's a joy to see
"how, little by little,
"the holy guillotine will deliver us
"from all the human flesh-eaters."
Follow me.
Not you.
Prince!
All is well with you, I hope.
By God, Grace! It's you?
I am very sorry indeed.
What has befallen you?
And you?
Is he going to prison?
No, to Palais-Royal.
Until further notice.
You heard what he said to her?
Yes. Very suspicious.
Next.
Please be seated.
Citizen Elliott,
Georgina Grace, née Dalrymple.
What has she done?
She's an Englishwoman residing on Rue Miromesnil.
We found this letter in her house.
From one Englishman to another.
It is unopened.
What is in it?
I have no idea at all.
I was asked to forward it to Mr. Fox.
A blatant case of conspiracy.
I know the woman. She's a royalist.
She plotted in England to wed
Orleans' daughter to an English prince.
Send her to the Force prison!
Citizen Chabot,
I find you somewhat hasty.
Why was this person arrested for having a letter to Mr. Fox in her house?
Had it been to that rascal Pitt, you couldn't have treated her worse.
Mr. Fox is our friend, the friend of a free world.
He loves our Revolution.
Then, citizen Vergniaud, let's open the letter to make sure.
No. It is needless and improper.
Is it honorable to read a private letter to a great man?
It shan't be done.
We'll send the letter intact to Mr. Fox.
No. It must be opened and read.
I agree.
Do you?
No.
Yes.
Likewise.
Latouche-Tréville's manifesto.
It's in English.
Our interpreter is inspecting papers in a suburb of St. Germain.
We cannot wait for him.
Citizen Elliott, please come forward and translate for us.
Don't cheat!
We know enough English to tell if you're lying.
Here's our interpreter. Sit down.
Translate this from the beginning.
"I enclose within this missive
"the manifesto from Admiral Latouche-Tréville
"to the King of Naples.
"I cannot help but admire
"the bravery and energy of the French nation at this time.
"I share your belief
"that the French Revolution
"is one of the world's most glorious events.
"Human rights are the true foundation
"of every rational constitution,
"as they are of England's own Constitution.
"The war in America
"has taught us that a people's uprising
"is never spurious."
What about that?
Isn't it magnificent?
Wasn't I right?
Citizen, accept our apologies.
You may go.
You must be very tired.
One of the Committee's carriages will drive you home.
I can hardly stand up after spending two horrid nights in sordid, brutal conditions.
The people of your section were overzealous. They've wasted our time.
Citizen!
A few more questions, if I may.
Do you know citizen d'Orleans, also known as Egalit<b>é</b>?
Did you speak with him in the waiting room just now?
I only asked him how he was.
What, pray, did he say?
He said,
"By God, I am sorry to see you here."
He was afraid you'd be questioned about him and would betray him.
I was examined and found innocent.
Please let me go!
This is a different charge.
As a Committee member,
I can indict you as Orleans' accomplice.
God, will this never end?
Tears do not move us.
The tears shed in this room could supply all of Paris with water.
Orleans wanted to be king and overthrow the Republic.
I'm sure he didn't.
You know he did!
That's why he voted for the King's death.
With all my heart, I wish he hadn't.
He could be happy now.
Then why did he vote?
Because you made him commit that ghastly crime.
You call it a crime?
It's reckless of you to say so here, in front of 50 Convention members who all voted the tyrant Capet dead not to become kings, but to rid the world of his vile race!
Now we'll deal with the would-be king and admirer of England, that graveyard of Liberty with which he connives, and you too!
You won't escape me.
Take her to prison!
She must be tried!
You're going too far.
She's been tried.
She's Mr. Fox's friend.
She can't have plotted.
There's no proof at all.
What is this din?
What's going on?
Citizen Robespierre, they won't let me arrest this Englishwoman, a friend of Orleans and a conspirator.
Has she been heard?
And acquitted.
On another charge, and wrongly so.
She was found with a letter to Charles Fox, our friend.
What was in it?
It praises the actions of our fleet in Naples.
We have more important business.
Let her go home.
There's time to decide.
It's six o'clock.
Is it morning or evening?
Morning. Madame has slept since yesterday afternoon.
I can get up although I'm not quite rested.
Did Madame see the letter on her nightstand?
The Duke sent it yesterday.
I didn't dare wake you.
He says he's coming at noon.
But I have to leave for Meudon.
I'll send him word to come... when I return tonight at eight.
Justin can deliver it.
I couldn't deliver it.
I went to Palais-Royal.
The Duke was arrested this morning.
In his bed, at 4 a.m.
Throw it in the fire.
Wait!
Hang the Duke's portrait back on the wall.
Philippe d'Orleans was escorted to Fort St. Jean in Marseilles and then back to Paris to be executed on November 5th.
By then,
Grace Elliott was under arrest.
While her fellow captives' heads rolled, she awaited her turn, which did not come.
The fall of Robespierre set her free.
These are the true events of November, 1965...
The la Drang Valley of Vietnam... a place our country does not remember... in a war it does not understand.
This story's a testament to the young Americans... who died in the Valley of Death... and a tribute to the young men of the Peoples Army of Vietnam... who died by our hand in that place.
To tell this story, l must start at the beginning.
But where does it begin?
Maybe in June of 1954, when French Group Mobile 100... moved into the same
Central Highlands of Vietnam... where we would go 11 years later.
Maybe the story begins in America... when the army first realized a new kind of war was coming its way.
The White House anticipates a buildup and wants a victory... over cavemen in black pajamas.
We wouldn't be there if they hadn't already beaten the French Army.
The French Army?
What's that?
The problem in Vietnam is terrain... jungles, mountains, rivers.
Maneuver's a nightmare.
We have a plan to use helicopters... leap in and out of battle.
They want you to run the test on the idea.
It'll take a hell of a combat leader.
I know a young light colonel named Hal Moore.
He led a combat company in Korea.
After that, he volunteered to test experimental parachutes.
Experimental parachutes?
Sounds like just the guy.
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see
Was all that he could see
Was all that he could see
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see
The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain
How about we go back to ''Bingo''?
What do you say? ''Bingo.''
B-l-N-G-O
B-l-N-G-O
B-l-N-G-O
And Bingo was his name-o
Tom, how much you know about our new colonel?
He was in Korea... has a master's in international relations from Harvard.
Harvard? He's not one of those academic pussies, is he?
Hal Moore?
Want me to get one of those?
Come on, Too Tall.
Gimme your best shot!
Did you see that, sports fans?
Did you see that?
Snakeshit drives that one to the moon, baby!
Hit the cutoff man!
Hit the cutoff man!
And he's coming around!
- Here he comes!
- No, he's not.
You're out!
You're out!
Horseshit! No wonder you can't fly.
You can't see.
I believe you're out.
- You're a pilot?
- Too Tall, sir.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You call, we haul.
- Can I speak to you, Crandall?
- Yes, sir.
- Out.
- Safe.
- Out.
- Safe.
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure.
Thanks.
So, your men call you ''Snakeshit.''
That's an affectionate appellation of my comrades-in-arms, sir...
'cause I fly lower than snake shit.
Well, I got a problem, Snakeshit, and I think you're the solution.
I've been called a lot of things,
Colonel, never a solution.
You know what air cavalry really means?
You fly into hostile territory, outnumbered, 10,000 miles from home.
Sometimes the battleground's no bigger than a football field.
And if the choppers stop comin', we all get slaughtered.
Now, I figure chopper pilots won't fly into hell for strangers... so... I'm Hal Moore.
I know, sir.
Why us?
Well, you guys look like shit, but your equipment is immaculate.
Yesterday was Sunday. You didn't have to be training, but you were.
You got pilots like that Too Tall character.
He's way outside the limits of army regs.
They wanna fly with you for some reason.
I guess it's 'cause they think you're the best.
It's 'cause I only recruit the dumb ones, sir.
I don't suppose
I have a choice in all this.
You sure don't.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
To the Air Cav.
Good mornin', Sergeant-Major.
How do you know what kind of goddamn day it is?
Group! Atten-hut!
At ease, gentlemen.
Welcome to the new cavalry.
We will ride into battle.
And this... will be our horse.
You don't have to catch it.
You don't have to feed it.
But I can assure you... that neither the new technology nor your status as officers... will keep you above the danger.
Sergeant-Major Plumley and I come from the paratroopers... where the officer is always the first one out of the plane.
Because to follow your instincts... and to inspire your men by your example... you have to be with them where the metal meets the meat.
Sergeant-Major Plumley made all four combat jumps... in the 82nd Airborne during World War II.
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy... and Holland, plus one more in Korea.
He answers to me and to me alone.
Now, I hope you gentlemen like training...
'cause me and the sergeant-major-- we love it.
Three strikes and you're not out!
There is always one more thing you can do.
Here we go, boys.
Move! Move! Go! Now!
- Two.
- Let's go!
Three.
We're outta here!
- Pretty good, huh?
- Pretty good.
There's only one thing wrong.
Be sharp! We will be the best platoon in this battalion!
Be ready in there!
Let's go! Let's go!
All right!
Your officer's dead!
- What do you do? What do you do?
- First...
All right, he hesitated.
He's dead. What do you do?
- Get off the chopper!
- Get off of the chopper.
Hold off the third one.
Come on in.
Savage, you learn the job of the man above you... and you teach your job to the man below you in rank.
That goes for every man in this outfit.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!
We'll be landing under fire, gentlemen.
Men will die.
Have you said your prayers?
Come on.
I'll say them with you.
- Fall in.
- Gimme that bear.
All right.
Ready. Set.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners...
Cecile, I don't hear you praying, honey.
I don't wanna be Catholic.
I wanna be a ''Nethodist'' like Mommy.
You do?
And why is that, honey?
So I can pray whatever I want.
That's a sin.
No, that's not a sin.
God just made you hardheaded.
It's not a sin.
I'll tell you what.
You wanna...
You wanna pray and thank God for our family?
- Yes, sir.
- That's good. Let's do it.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
I can hear you laughing, you know, even in here.
I'm not laughing,
I'm marveling.
Marveling? At what?
That you can find stubbornness in your children... and think it comes from anybody but you.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
I'll give you something to marvel at.
He's a wild man.
- When I pray...
- Mm-hmm. whatever I want...
I thank God for you.
Beautiful morning,
Sergeant-Major.
What are you, a fuckin' weatherman now?
Look what I found for the new baseball player.
- Sent us another bunch of officers.
- Uh-huh.
Real green.
Gotta train 'em up.
Makes me think
I'm starting a new unit.
They sent new rifles too.
The M-16.
That's supposed to be a pretty good weapon.
Lots of plastic.
Feels like a BB gun to me.
Believe I'll stick with my pistol.
You think we're gonna get close enough to the enemy to use that?
What do you think, sir?
A leader must remain cool and calm.
And second, he must learn to ignore explosions... the heat and dust, the screams of the wounded.
This is normal on a battlefield.
Normal!
Fortran, you need to get a company over to reinforce the left flank.
- Where is that coming from?
- That's our advisors in Vietnam.
The new radio's picking up atmospheric bounce.
When Crazy Horse was a baby... he nursed from the breast of every woman in the tribe.
The Sioux raised their children that way.
Every warrior... called every woman in the tribe ''mother.''
Every older warrior, they called him ''grandfather.''
Now, the point here is that they fought as a family.
Take care of your men.
Teach them to take care of each other.
'Cause when this starts... each other is all we're gonna have.
- Did you tune that in?
- Yes, sir.
Well, that's fine.
You're my radio operator.
You'll be fine.
You'll work it out.
Any of you sons of bitches calls me Grandpa...
I'll kill ya.
Godboldt, take your boots off.
Go on.
Everybody, take your boots off.
Everybody.
Socks too.
I want you to draw fresh socks from supply.
Keep your feet dusted with powder.
Everybody check each other's feet like Godboldt and me.
Now, that young man's a leader.
Yes, sir.
That other fella... that big, strong one there... he wants to win medals.
Why were you in the back?
Goddamn it, why were you in the back?
He's eager.
Ladies, I'm really, really glad you're here today.
Some of you are new to the army and all of us are new to this post.
I thought we'd pool our resources and cover questions we have.
So, why don't we start with item number one... food.
Where's the best place to shop?
Well, I tried Big Star, and it's okay.
But I keep thinking my water's gonna break right in the checkout aisle.
That takes care of food shopping.
So, item number two... laundry.
The base washing machines don't work.
They're full of sand from the swamp missions.
I'll take care of that.
- I've already complained.
- We'll just go to the general.
In the meantime, the Laundromat in town's okay... but they won't let you wash your colored things in their machines.
- At a public Laundromat?
- Didn't make sense to me either.
I'm telling you, they have a sign right in the window... says ''Whites Only.''
- What?
- They mean white people only.
That's awful.
Your husband is wearing the uniform of a country that allows a place... to say his laundry's not good enough, when he could die for...
- I'm sorry. I just...
- That's all right, honey.
I know what my husband's fighting for, and that's why I can smile.
My husband will never ask for respect... and he'll give respect to no man who hasn't earned it.
The rest of his family is the same way.
Anybody who doesn't respect that can keep his washing machine...
'cause my baby's clothes are gonna be clean anyway.
Well, I guess that takes care of item number two.
Are you all right?
I think... I think my water just broke.
We're all calm.
We're all calm.
A car! A car!
- Colonel.
- At ease. At ease.
I heard one of my new lieutenants just became a father.
- I came to say congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
So, I didn't wanna disturb you.
No, it's fine.
It's all right. Please.
Well, how's your wife?
She's okay. She's okay.
She's sleeping.
So is my daughter.
I just... wanted to be here for a while before I held her.
Well, tag her already?
- What's that say?
- Camille. Sorry about this, sir.
Don't take that off. Leave that where it is. That's an order.
- Colonel, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.
What do you think about being a soldier and a father?
I hope that being good at the one... makes me better at the other.
Why? What about you?
I don't know, sir.
Between college and here...
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa.
We helped build a school for orphans.
They were orphans because the warlord across the border... didn't like their tribe.
I know God has a plan for me.
I just hope it's to help protect orphans... not make any.
Well, why don't we ask him?
Come on.
Let's go ask him.
Our Father in Heaven, before we go into battle... every soldier among us will approach you each in his own way.
Our enemies too... according to their own understanding... will ask for protection and for victory.
And so, we bow before your infinite wisdom.
We offer our prayers as best we can.
I pray you watch over the young men, like Jack Geoghegan... that I lead into battle.
You use me as your instrument in this awful hell of war... to watch over them.
Especially if they're men like this one beside me... deserving of a future in your blessing and good will.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Yes, and one more thing, dear Lord... about our enemies... ignore their heathen prayers... and help us blow those little bastards straight to hell.
Amen again.
Amen.
Thank you.
There's one about the kid with the apple tree, or the flying horse... or the fairy tales with the deer and stuff in 'em.
Daddy, what is a war?
A war is a...
Well, it's...
It's something that shouldn't happen, but it does.
It's when... some people... in another country or any country... try to take the lives of other people.
And then soldiers like your daddy have to...
It's my job to go over there and stop them.
Are they gonna try to take your life away, Daddy?
Well, yes, they're gonna try.
But I'm not gonna let 'em.
Okay?
Can't sleep?
The men are so young and...
Now they sent me a new crop even greener.
When I look at them, I... see our boys.
Well, then you're just the man to lead them.
I guess.
We intend to convince the Communists... that we cannot be defeated by force of arms. l have asked the commanding general,
General Westmoreland... what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression.
He has told me... and we will meet his needs. l have today ordered to Vietnam the airmobile division... and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength... from 75,000 to...
125,000 men almost immediately.
Additional forces will be needed later.
Get out your best dresses, ladies.
They're gonna want to celebrate.
Don't you ever be sad
Lean on me when the times are bad
I didn't hear the president mention a state of emergency.
No, he didn't.
Well, without that declaration our enlistments won't be extended.
I'm sorry, Hal.
Forgive me, sir, but let me get this straight.
We form a division using techniques never attempted in battle... against an enemy with 20 years of combat experience on his ground...
12,000 miles away from our ground.
And right before the army sends us into the fight... they take away a third of my most experienced men, including officers.
I don't like it any better than you do, Hal.
You saw this coming, didn't you?
Yes. That's why you gave me that new crop of platoon leaders.
Korea didn't teach 'em anything.
- Politicians?
- Politicians.
Hold me, hold me
Never let me go
Until you've told me told me
What l want to know and then just hold me
Hold me
Make me tell you l'm in love with you
Thrill me, thrill me
Thank you, sir.
By the way, Hal, since we're being deployed... they're renumbering the units.
You're now the commanding officer... of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry.
The 7th.
The same regiment as Custer.
Thank you, sir.
Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking
This is the last you'll find
But they never stood in the dark
With you, love
When you take me in your arms
And drive me slowly out of my mind
Kiss me, kiss me
And when you do l'll know
Look around you.
In the 7th Cavalry... we got a captain from the Ukraine.
Another from Puerto Rico.
We've got Japanese, Chinese...
Blacks, Hispanics,
Cherokee Indians.
Jews and gentiles.
All Americans.
Now, here in the States... some men in this unit... may experience discrimination because of race or creed.
But for you and me now... all that is gone.
We're moving into the Valley of the Shadow of Death... where you will watch the back of the man next to you... as he will watch yours.
And you won't care what color he is... or by what name he calls God.
They say we're leaving home.
We're going to what home was always supposed to be.
So let us understand the situation.
We are going into battle... against a tough and determined enemy.
I can't promise you... that I will bring you all home alive.
But this I swear... before you and before
Almighty God... that when we go into battle...
I will be the first to set foot on the field... and I will be the last to step off.
And I will leave no one behind.
Dead or alive... we will all come home together.
So help me God.
I love you.
Hal, last night the enemy hit our camp at Plaei Me.
- How many casualties?
- None.
The enemy forces withdrew toward this mountain... near the Cambodian border.
How many men do you have battle-ready?
- Sergeant Major?
- Three hundred ninety-five, sir.
Exactly.
What do you estimate the enemy strength?
We appraise their numbers as manageable, Colonel.
You have no idea.
We have no idea.
Simple orders, Hal.
Find the enemy and kill him.
They attack us, no casualties.
They run and hide in the mountains.
Naturally we chase them, of course.
Smell like an ambush to you?
They get close enough to kill us, we'll be close enough to kill them.
Round trip by chopper, 30 minutes.
So the first 60 men on the ground will be there a half an hour alone.
Son of a bitch.
I think maybe you ought to get yourself that M-16.
Time comes I need one, there'll be plenty of'em lying on the ground.
Well, let's go do what we came here to do.
Yes, sir.
Garry Owen! lt was a Sunday.
November 14, 1965.
Before that day, the soldiers of North Vietnam... and those of America... never met each other in a major battle.
Two miles out.
Dropping to nap of the earth.
First Platoon, let's move!
This is Trojan Two. All units maintain perimeter contact. Over.
It's a scout!
Let's take him prisoner!
Hey! Lieutenant!
There he goes! Come on!
Come on!
Captain, I want you to keep in contact with all patrols.
Hey, I got something here.
I got a boy! here.
Boy, hell.
That ain't no boy.
- He say he a deserter.
- Bullshit, he's a lookout.
Ask him where his friends are.
He say this is base camp of whole division.
- Four thousand men.
- Where?
That mountain.
Same army destroyed French.
And he say they want kill American very badly.
Just not been able to find any yet.
Captain Metsker, tell all patrols to hold their positions.
You, take the radio!
- Where are they?
- Sir, we gotta get that guy!
Call in all the patrols!
We have to engage the enemy as far away from the LZ as possible!
Net Call, Net Call, this is Trojan-Two.
Grab the wounded!
Break contact!
Fall back!
Get to high ground!
Cover fire!
Get to high ground!
Come on!
Come on! Get up here!
Bring the wounded up to the middle!
Move it, move it!
Cover fire! Cover fire!
Everybody down! Down!
Check your ammo!
Everybody check ammo!
Come on!
I'll get us out of here!
Grab the wounded!
We'll make a run
- Sarge!
- We gotta get out of here!
Stay down! Don't anybody move!
Bungum, stay down!
You're gonna be okay.
Stay down.
Form a perimeter!
Conserve your ammo and stay down!
What's happening with those patrols?
I'm trying to reach them, sir!
This is Trojan-Two! Come in! Over!
Hey! Hey! Calm down!
Understand the situation and communicate clearly!
Pull the chain on all the firepower you can get on that mountain!
Alert Crandall!
We have a hot LZ!!
Agent Serpent-Six, this is Trojan-Two.
You're coming into a hot LZ.
We are taking fire.
Repeat.
We are taking fire.
No shit.
This is Too Tall goin'down and dirty.
Roger that!
Trojan-Two, out!
Herrick's platoon is cut off and under attack.
Bravo Company's holding.
They're gonna try and flank us.
On the ground now! Move!
- Watch him!
- We gotta go.
We're outta here.
They're coming at us from the back now! Move!
Savage.
All right, all right,
I got you.
Sir?
Don't let them get the signal codes.
Roger that, sir.
I'm glad I could die for my country.
Doc.
Bungum.
Sarge?
Tell my wife...
I love her.
This is Savage.
I need artillery to these coordinates: niner-3-3-0-1
Ernie! Ernie, help!
We got more coming!
We are cut off.
Copy? We are cut off.
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
They're getting closer!
They're getting closer!
A hundred more, sir!
They're right on top of us, sir!
Bring it in close!
It's a hot LZ! We'll be jumping!
We will not touch down.
They're trying to break right through us!
I want you to reinforce
Alpha Company there! Now! Move!
Follow me!
Charlie Company, up on the ridge!
Doc, the wounded are over by that termite mound! Go!
Sir, if you don't find some cover, you're gonna go down!
If you go down, we all go down!
Come on!
Cobain!
I want the M-60 right here!
Radio!
Sir, it's Captain Edwards on the ridge, sir!
- Bob!
- Colonel, these guys are regulars!
Heavily armed!
AK-47s and pouches of grenades!
Heavy machine guns and shoulder-fired rockets!
Captain Nadal!
That creek bed is vital.
Vital!
They'll be coming right at you!
Do not let them flank! l repeat, do not let them flank!
Secure the creek bed!
Tom, I want you to keep trying to raise those Medevac boys.
I'm all right.
Charlie, come here.
Get me all the air support you can get me on that mountain! Now!
Requesting immediate close air support!
I need you to burn 'em out... on hilltop Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo!
Coordinates: Golf-4-5-0-9!
- Get me something higher up!
- Shifting to hilltop Bravo!
Golf-4-5-7-2!
I say again, 4-5-7-2!
Medevac Command of the 7th Cavalry, are you inbound?
Looks pretty hot down there.
Yeah. You can make it, though.
Watch our approach, follow us in.
Copy that, 7th Cav.
We will follow your approach.
I want you to get over there and reinforce Charlie Company there!
Medevac, abort! Abort!
This is a hot LZ!
You see that? My Medevac guys are buggin'out and leaving the wounded!
We're going down!
- Snake, get out of here!
- Bring me the wounded!
Wounded! Get the wounded!
Come on! Come on!
Okay, here!
They're still trying to flank us!
Stretch out along the line!
Radio!
Trojan-Six! We are in heavy contact!
In danger of being overrun! lf they get into that LZ, we've all had it. Can you hold?
We're spread thin, sir, but we'll give 'em hell!
Crandall, this is Trojan-Six. lt's too hot down here.
- l'm closing the LZ.
- You copy that, Too Tall?
Copy that, Snake.
All 7th Cav air units.:
LZ X-Ray is closed.
I don't like it. First time out, a whole battalion massacred?
You think this is a massacre?
Losing draftees is a bad week.
Losing a colonel is a massacre.
Moore is still fighting.
He's under strength against more men than he can count.
- He's got a whole platoon lost.
- They're not lost.
They're only cut off and surrounded.
Then they're lost.
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!
We need to carve out an emergency LZ right over there.
- Sir!
- Blow the trees down!
Fire in the hole!
Colonel, this is Snakeshit and Too Tall.
We're comin' in with two loads of ammo.
Crandall, we've blown a new LZ.
When you come in, come in from the east. Out.
Colonel, it's Brigade Headquarters.
They want you out.
- Well, we can't get out, damn it!
- Not all of us. Just you.
Saigon wants to debrief you.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Say again.
Will you repeat that order?
Too Tall, follow the colonel to the new LZ.
I see him, Snake.
He's right here!
Let's go! Move!
Let's move! Move!
Oh, shit.
- Come on! We'll give you a hand!
- We're moving on board!
All right, get that ammo off and get the wounded on!
Bring 'em on!
Get 'em on, boys!
No, we're overloaded!
- Leave him!
- I'll get out! It's Ray!
He's hurt worse than me!
You hang on!
I'll see you back there, Ray!
You, me and Ouellette are all we have in reserve.
Yeah, but it's slacking up a little.
No, they're just regrouping for another assault.
Distribute that ammo.
Ouellette, tell Crandall he's got time to get one more flight in here.
Yes, sir.
Doc, you give this water to the wounded.
Running out of water.
Must be terrible for 'em.
Those guys are cut off out there.
Running low on ammo, Sarge!
Pick your target.
One shot, one kill.
- Roger that, Sarge.
- How we doin', Doc?
Ernie, we're out of water.
That's the last of it.
My face is on fire! Help!
Foster, hold still!
Hold still!
I'll cut your face!
Hold still!
Doc, Doc, it's Foster!
Okay.
Does anybody have any more bandages?
Ernie, you hit too?
You hit?
No, no, I'm okay.
Our guys are gonna come for us, aren't they?
Yeah.
When?
Plug his wound.
That's the main LZ, but it's closed.
Go! Move!
Go, Parker! Get up in there!
This is too Tall. I'm clear..
Crandall's clear..
Colonel!
Go over and reinforce that company!
On that ridge there! Look!
Yes, sir!
Okay! Keep your head down!
To the top of the ridge!
Move it!
Come on, leùs move!
Move!
Run! Come on!
Captain Nadal, we've got to break through to that cutoff platoon!
We got an American platoon out there.
An Air Cav platoon cut off out there!
Air Cav!
Garry Owen!
He said, "Really? Me too."
I said, "I know.
Your mama asked me to give you $600."
Good luck to you.
Hey, you got enough room for one more?
Ifyou're crazy enough, get in.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what are those lights down there?
Enemy soldiers.
They use candles on the trail.
They're moving into position to attack.
Here we go!
Unload that shit!
Leùs go, leùs go, leùs go, leùs go!
You and your boys have done a hell of a job today, Snake.
Iùs the last flight for the night, but you need us, you call us.
Who in the hell are you?
I'm a reporter, sir.
Yeah.
Joe Galloway, UPI.
How's it going, Colonel?
We've been flat to the boards since last night, and we're outnumbered.
More enemy coming too. I saw a chain of lights coming down the mountain.
Is that so?
Yes, sir.
Well, I can't guarantee your safety.
Yes, sir, I know.
Where you from, son?
Refugio, Texas, sir.
Well, thaùs the first thing I heard all day that makes any sense.
Captain, you see those lights coming down the trails on the mountain?
On it right now, sir.
You fry them sons of bitches.
Whiskey-Six, this is Trojan-Three.
Fire mission.
Tango Foxtrot:
4-niner-6-5-6-niner.
All operations are suspended for the evening.
Morning operations will be scheduled for 0530 hours.
Where's Crandall?
Where's Crandall?
He's right there, sir.
You led my men into a hot LZ.
Somebody had to fly out the wounded.
Don't you play hotshot with me.
You know the rules.
You suckered us in there.
Do it again, I'll have you busted!
You got the balls to face me, but not the balls to face the enemy?
Get outta here.
Whoa!
I ever see you again, I'll kill you.
Thaùs right.
Quite a day, huh?
Tomorrow will be worse.
If they make it to tomorrow.
Ernie, iùs pitch black.
I can't see anything, but I can smell 'em.
Dead bodies stink, Bungum.
No, iùs not the dead ones.
I can smell them crawling up on us.
I'm telling you.
I need illumination, 6-5-0, 1-5-0.
I need artillery on previously established targets!
Alpha, Bravo and Charlie! Fire for effect!
Fire for effect!
Save your ammo!
Cease fire!
Is anybody hit?
Captain, if you guys are coming you gotta let us know.
Iùs pitch black out here. I don't wanna shoot any of our own guys.
Savage... we can't make it tonight.
Don't worry.
You're gonna make it.
We'll come get you in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Out.
You're doing a fine job, son.
Don't worry. We gave them more than they gave us today.
How you boys doing?
Fine, sir.
You keep doing what you're doing, we'll be fine.
Your men have done a hell of a job today,
Lieutenant Geoghegan.
They won't get through us, sir.
You can count on it.
I know that, Jack.
Keep it up, son.
Iùs Rear Headquarters, sir.
How is it out there, Colonel?
We're surrounded, but we're holding on, sir.
Sir, I need a confirmed count of our dead and wounded.
I got to know where all my boys are.
You'll get it, Hal.
Here they come.
Captain Edwards.
We need illumination on the perimeter.
Whiskey-Five, this is Hot Wire-Six-Alpha.
We need illumination now.
Kathy?
A telegram.
A cab delivers a telegram.
"The Secretary of the Army... regrets..."
Mrs. Moore?
Colonel Moore's wife?
Yes.
I need help finding an address.
I'm looking for...
You jackass!
Do you know what this is?
Do you know what you just did to me?
I don't like this job, ma'am.
I'm just trying to do it.
Wait.
Wait.
I'll take it to her.
And if there are any others, just bring them to me.
Julie.
I just went by to see Catherine.
Everybody knows.
No chaplains or counselors?
Cab drivers?
The Army wasn't ready.
I'll go with you.
Thanks.
Who's it for?
I thought she would hate me.
Your husband didn't start the war.
They all knew this could happen, and so did we.
I'll take care of this.
I'll go with you.
We'll do one at a time.
Okay?
We won't look.
Okay.
Julie... do you think there'll be more telegrams tomorrow?
If there are, come and get me.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen.
Out of the depths
I cry unto Thee, O Lord.
Lord, hear my voice.
Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
Thou, O Lord, shall mark our inequities.
Lord, who can abide them?
With Thee there is mercy.
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord... and may perpetual light shine upon them.
And through the mercy of God, may they rest in peace. Amen.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Do you got a death wish,
Galloway?
No, sir.
Well, then why are you here?
'Cause I knew these dead boys would be here, sir.
Why aren't you a soldier?
You got the guts for it.
My daddy was a soldier.
My granddaddy, two of my great-granddaddies was soldiers.
Hell, thaùs how I came to be.
Each of them lost a leg in the Civil War.
My Great-granddaddy Galloway, he lost his left... and my Great-granddaddy Reid lost his right.
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.
Every year after that, same date, same store, they'd get together... and pick out a new pair of shoes for the two of them.
You are shittin' me.
No, sir.
I swear to God.
Anyway, one had a daughter, one had a son... my grandparents.
What do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was?
I don't know, Colonel.
It was meant to be, I guess.
Yeah.
Meant to be.
Sir, Galloways have been in every war this country's ever fought.
But when it came to this one,
I didn't think I could stop the war.
I just thought maybe
I might try and understand one.
Maybe help folks back home understand.
I just figure
I could do that better... shooting a camera than I could shooting a rifle.
Well...
I sure hope you make it through this one.
You too, Colonel.
Right 20!
Put it right on 'em!
Colonel, sir.
Captain Nadal.
Sir.
What is it, sir?
Nothing's wrong, except there's nothing wrong.
Best get back to the termite mound.
You'll be fine. Go on.
Roger that, sir.
Come on!
All right, pass the word on.
Every man fire three rounds at anything that looks suspicious.
On my signal.
They're gonna hit us like this along the whole perimeter.
We gotta get back to that termite mound.
Better hang here, sir!
Shit.
We need a medic!
Sir! Sir!
Captain Edwards, Charlie Company, on the ridge.
Bob.
They're inside the artillery!
I need...
I need a grenade!
Go, Willie!
Come on, leùs go!
Godboldt down!
I'll get him!
Willie!
Get those guys help!
Captain Dillon, get Bravo Company to send a platoon across the LZ... and support Charlie Company.
Bravo-Six, this is Trojan-Three.
And tell Charlie Company to get real small in their holes.
I'm gonna drop some artillery right on top of'em!
Charlie Company, get small.
We got AT coming right on top of your position.
We're being overrun!
Nah, boys!
We're gonna win this fight.
Yes, sir, they brought a main force of VC battalion against us too.
Colonel, I request you dispatch another company of reinforcements... for movement as soon as it can be accomplished without undue risk.
Done.
How bad is it, Hal?
Iùs getting pretty sporty down here, sir.
Get out of the way!
Medic!
Get a medic over here!
Whaùs your name, soldier?
Jimmy Nakayama.
I got a baby being born today.
Oh, wow! Congratulations!
Thanks!
Medic!
Medic!
Can't take no pictures lying down there, sonny.
Down, right there.
I'm a noncombatant, sir.
Ain't no such thing today, boy.
Shit.
Why aren't those mortars firing?
Whaùs the problem here?
These tubes are red hot, sir.
I'm afraid we're gonna cook a round off and blow us all up.
We can't cool 'em off
'cause we're all out of water.
Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Jimmy, come on.
Go, go, go.
Yeah, one more.
Gentlemen... prepare to defend yourselves.
Grenade!
Negative! Negative!
Stand by!
My pilots do not see the enemy.
They cannot pick out our friendlies.
Bravo-Six, say again.
You gotta tell your company commander to pop smoke now.
They need to mark the lines now!
We have no lines!
We have enemies and friendlies mixed in all over the place.
Sir, our perimeter is collapsing.
Alpha Company and Bravo Company cannot hold.
Charlie Company is being overrun.
Net call! Net call!
Keep this net clear!
Hastings!
Broken arrow!
Broken arrow!
I say again!
Broken arrow!
We have br.oken ar.r.ow!
Confirm. Broken arrow.
Broken arrow confirmed.
Broken arrow?
That means that an American unit has been overrun.
It calls in every combat aircraft for support.
My God, there's no hiding it now.
Charlie Company, report!
Signal is out!
Bravo Company, report!
Roger that!
Planes are on their way, Colonel!
Sir!
Roger that!
We have planes at every 1,000 feet... from 7,000 to 35,000... we'll get 'em, sir!
Advancing north on our position at 1 -5-0.
Nine-six-two-five-zero-seven...
They're getting closer in on 3-1 -5 degrees!
Thaùs 0-5-0!
Repeat, 0-5-0!
Goddamn it.
Company sighted out in the open, advancing north on our position.
They're advancing on
3-1 -5 degrees at 1 -5-0.
Bring it closer in on 3-1 -5 degrees at 0-5-0...
Charlie, call that son of a bitch off!
Call an abort now!
Pull up!
Get down!
Charlie, listen to me.
You're keeping us alive now.
You forget about that one and you keep 'em coming in.
You're doing well, son.
Seven-oh-two...
Attack against the tree line.
Medic! Medic!
Oh, God! Jimmy.
You know this guy?
You know him? Talk to him.
Just talk to him!
Jimmy, do you hear me?
Iùs Joe.
Iùs Joe Galloway.
Doc's giving you morphine.
We're gonna get you out of here.
We gotta get him to the landing zone. Grab his legs!
You gotta get him out of here.
Hey! Hey!
I can't help you!
You gotta do it by yourself!
Get him on that chopper, okay?
Yes, sir.
Tell my wife I love her... and my baby!
You tell'em!
Captain Nadal.
Sir...
Now that we put 'em back on their heels, we got us a lull.
I want you to attack.
I want you to go overthere and rescue that cut off platoon.
Yes, sir!
First Squad, move out!
Come on, guys.
Move it!
Add fifty.
Keep moving the artillery forward!
Keep walking the artillery forward!
Spread it out!
Move it!
Move it!
Keep moving forward!
Sergeant Savage, you guys still here?
We have 40 KIA, we have two MIA.
These are the latest numbers.
Over.
Thaùs a nice day,
Sergeant Savage.
Forty dead, two unaccounted for, sir.
Right.
All right, boys, leùs get 'em up and get 'em out.
Leùs get 'em out of here and get 'em on the chopper!
Since most of the men being loaded on the chopper... are from Charlie Company...
I want you to take their place.
I'll show you where. Follow me.
Yes, sir! Leùs go!
Captain, have your men dig some firing steps.
Throw some dirt on those bodies, keep the smell down.
Roger, Sergeant Major.
Kind of makes you wish you'd signed up for submarines, don't it?
Brigade headquarters wants you out on the first chopper at dawn.
What idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle?
Gen. Westmoreland wants a briefing.
Give me the horn.
I am in a fight... and I object to this order to return to Saigon.
Now, I will not leave my men.
Is that clear?
Out.
There's two of my men unaccounted for out there... and iùs where the worst of the fighting was... so they'll be out there someplace.
Leùs go out and get 'em.
I'm with you, sir.
All right.
Leùs go.
They... brought another...
Oh, God.
Julie, iùs yours.
He died keeping my promise.
Sir, they're ordering us all out.
All of us.
They're gonna march reinforcements in.
They don't understand a damn thing, do they?
Can't get out.
He's waiting up there in a cave, and thaùs what he wants.
The minute he sees live soldiers hopping on a helicopter... he'll be all over us and then he'll get what he wants.
He'll get his massacre.
Requesting permission to rejoin the lines, sir.
All right, son.
Garry Owen, sir.
I wonder what was going through
Custer's mind when he realized... he'd led his men into a slaughter.
Sir, Custer was a pussy.
You ain't.
Goddamn.
Hell.
Right now they're planning their final attack... the one that will finish us off.
They'll nibble at us all night, then... come dawn they'll hit us with everything they got.
Thaùs what I'd do if I was him.
Sergeant Major, hand out the last of the ammunition.
Yes, sir.
Fix bayonets.
You were wondering how Custer felt, sir.
You ought to ask him.
Sergeant Savage!
Checking the dead enemies for documents... and I found this on the guy that tried to bayonet you.
Translated some of it, mostly personal.
Thought you might wanna have a look at it.
What was that?
Iùs American artillery.
Friendly fire.
How many casualties?
What the hell happened here, Joe?
Hey, Joe.
Colonel Moore!
Colonel!
Colonel Moore!
What is the key to your victory?
Sir, tell us how you feel.
Do you feel the States will be forced... to take the North Vietnamese more seriously?
How do you feel about the loss of your men, sir?
Have you notified the families, sir?
I'm glad you made it, son.
Thankyou, sir.
You too.
I'll never forgive myself.
For what, sir?
That my men...
That my men died and I didn't.
Sir, I don't...
I don't know how to tell this story.
Well, you got to, Joe.
You tell the American people what these men did here.
You tell 'em how my troopers died.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
All of our men, living and dead, are off the field, sir.
Well done, Sergeant Major.
In Saigon, Hal Moore's superiors congratulated him... for killing over 1800 enemy soldiers.
Then ordered him to lead the men of the 7th Cavalry... back into the Valley of Death.
He led them... and fought beside them... for 235 more days.
Kids, go to bed.
Isn't there someone at the door?
Go to bed!
Children, your daddy's home!
Daddy!
Some had families waiting.
For others, their only family would be the men they bled beside.
There were no bands, no flags... no honor guards to welcome them home.
They went to war because their country ordered them to.
But in the end they fought not for their country or their flag.
They fought for each other...
Dear Barbara...
I have no words to express to you my sadness of the loss of Jack.
The world is a lesser place without him.
But I know he is with God and the angels.
And even heaven is improved by his presence there.
I know you, too, are sure of this... and yet this knowledge can't diminish his loss... and your grief.
With abiding respect and affection,
Hal Moore.
We who have seen war... will never stop seeing it.
In the silence of the night, we will always hear the screams.
So this is our story... for we were soldiers once... and young.
{2258}{2309}Excuse me, sir.|Yes?
{2309}{2365}I'm afraid you've come in|the wrong way.
{2365}{2415}I'm sorry...|This is the old entrance.
{2415}{2476}The visitor's centre's out|and around to the left.
{2476}{2555}Right, well...|I'll wander over then.
{2555}{2621}Well worth it.|Been through some amazing times.
{2647}{2683}(Murmurs) Yeah.
{3022}{3089}I believe that this nation|should commit itself
{3089}{3182}to achieving the goal,|before this decade is out,
{3182}{3232}of landing a man on the moon
{3232}{3287}and returning him safely|to the Earth.

{6208}{6252}I haven't done the moon landing.
{6252}{6289}(Mutters) Thank God.
{6289}{6356}I've made a model of|the telescope and receiving dish
{6356}{6396}in the town of Parkes.
{6396}{6450}When astronaut Neil Armstrong|lands on the moon,
{6450}{6522}people all over the world|will be watching television pictures
{6522}{6588}provided by the radio telescope|in Parkes.
{6588}{6655}WOMAN: Mr Callem,|the Prime Minister wants to see you.
{6655}{6711}Can it wait?|I don't think so.
{6711}{6748}What's it about?
{6748}{6822}He's just got off the phone|to the White House.
{6898}{6959}Do you know|who was on the phone then?
{6959}{7010}No, sir.|The US President.
{7010}{7047}Nixon...|Sorry, sir...
{7047}{7114}..thanking me for allowing NASA|to use our facility.
{7114}{7167}Yes, sir.|And something about an upgrade?
{7167}{7209}Right.|What's he talking about?
{7209}{7276}There's a briefing docu...|I don't read those!
{7276}{7323}( BELL RINGS )
{7323}{7380}Are we raising this?|I think we should.
{7380}{7430}So what's this all about?
{7430}{7495}The President was referring to|our radio telescope.
{7495}{7551}Some months ago, NASA requested -|and you approved -
{7551}{7626}its use in the Apollo program,|originally as a backup receiver.
{7626}{7676}Originally?|They upgraded its role.
{7676}{7726}When 'Apollo 1 1 '|gets to the moon,
{7726}{7780}Parkes will now be|the prime receiving station.
{7780}{7830}Meaning?|We've got the moon walk.
{7830}{7912}Shit. The people at this place -|do they know what they're doing?
{7912}{7979}I believe so.|I bloody well hope so.
{7979}{8028}Why'd they pick us?
{8028}{8112}It's the largest radio telescope|in the Southern Hemisphere.
{8112}{8186}What's it doing in the middle|of a sheep paddock?
{8373}{8461}MAN: The Parkes radio telescope,|or, as we call it, the dish,
{8461}{8535}will track 'Apollo 1 1 '|throughout its journey
{8535}{8586}gathering voice signals|from the astronauts,
{8586}{8628}telemetry from the spaceship
{8628}{8726}and then, most importantly,|the TV signals from the moon itself.
{8726}{8808}It's 21 0 feet in diameter,|it weighs 1 ,000 tons
{8808}{8884}and it can be moved to point|in virtually every direction.
{8884}{8948}It's the most powerful|receiving dish in the world.
{8948}{8985}..in the world.
{8985}{9054}Can I have their full names|and specific roles?
{9054}{9091}This is Ross Mitchell.
{9091}{9141}He's responsible|for manoeuvring the dish.
{9141}{9181}This is Mr Glenn Latham.
{9181}{9231}Glenn's in charge of|all the electronics.
{9231}{9296}Glenn's a Sagittarius. He enjoys|knitting, flower-arranging...
{9296}{9346}Mitch, I do not!|Don't write that.
{9346}{9383}From NASA, AI Burnett.
{9383}{9472}AI makes sure the signals|get back safely to Mission Control.
{9472}{9539}Enjoying your stay in Australia?|Very much, sir.
{9539}{9599}The people are warm...|And friendly. That's great.
{9599}{9653}And you, Cliff.|What's your official title?
{9653}{9718}Cliff Buxton, director.
{9718}{9763}Or the 'dishmaster'.
{9763}{9841}OK. Now I just need|a few personal details.
{9841}{9873}You married?|Yeah.
{9873}{9910}Glenn?|Fiancee, Janine Kellerman.
{9910}{9962}Mitch! She's not my fiancee.|Local girl.
{9962}{10002}I don't have a fiancee.
{10002}{10040}Married.|Two boys, in Houston.
{10040}{10080}And you, Cliff?
{10145}{10182}Married.
{10182}{10251}And just finally,|I mean, no offence,
{10251}{10301}but when you think about it,
{10301}{10369}the Americans spent 1 0 years,|billions of dollars,
{10369}{10431}to let us watch man|walk on the moon,
{10431}{10497}and in the end it falls|to you blokes. (Laughs)
{10549}{10611}I mean,|how do you feel about that?
{10611}{10678}A lot better|before you opened your trap.
{10678}{10774}We feel confident we have|the expertise to complete our role.
{10774}{10883}But, Cliff. I mean,|it's pretty amazing, isn't it?
{10951}{10991}Yes, it is amazing.
{10991}{11054}And so Australia finds itself|a vital cog
{11054}{11100}in this grand endeavour.
{11100}{11137}ALL: Hear, hear.
{11137}{11223}Only this morning,|I conveyed to President Nixon
{11223}{11338}my long-term interest|and commitment to this project.
{11338}{11415}It will be|one of the proudest moments
{11415}{11496}in Australia's|scientific history.
{11496}{11533}ALL: Hear, hear.
{11533}{11573}And I thought it fitting

In the year 1763 king Mangra ascended to the throne of Burma.
His first goal was to conquer the small surrounding town states.
But the city Ayudhya in Siam relieved these town states -
- and encouraged them to fight back.
Therefore king Mangra decided to attack Ayudhya, the heart of Siam.
In 1765 the king dispacthed a great army -
- to attack Ayudhya by two different routes.
Commander Mang-Maha-Noratha lead
100.000 men in from the the West.
Another 100.000 came down from the North lead by commander Nemeao, -
- but these didn't reach the destination as scheduled.
They were forced back near a little village.
Waves af Burmese soldiers attacked the inhabitants of the village.
Despite the superior strength of the army the farmers forced it back again and again.
Rumours about the legendary courage of Siamese country people -
- spread fast across the whole nation.
This is their story.
The year 1765
Are you sure, Po Tan?
Will the Burmese come this way?
What are you afraid of?
We defeat them every single time.
We will defeats them this time as well.
Wait for me here.
You follow with me.
Kill them, all as one!
Follow me.
The Commander has been wounded!
Retreat! Retreat!
Retreat!
Here is some food.
Po Tan... A Burmese battalion has put up a camp in the woods.
Hurry up and eat.
The commander is wounded.
Do we call it off?
Commander, sir!
THE VILLAGE BANG RAJAN
Chorb! Ming!
Call for the Abbot in a hurry!
My god...
I need help just to stand up straight.
Don't say that.
Bang Rajan is not strong enough, when it's leader is wounded.
The village need to find a strong man, that can replace me.
I know the right man. He harbours a bitter hatred towards the Burmese.
He doesn't fear death.
He come from the village Khao Nang Buad.
Who's there? Show your face!
You are not Burmese. Don't you know, it's lethal to be out here?
We come from Bang Rajan.
We are looking for Ai Jan Nuad Kiew.
What do you want with me?
We want to make you our leader.
Look here.
There are wagon tracks. And so what?
Look, how deep they are.
It is Burmese chariots.
They carry canons to Ayudhya by the river of Prasop.
Your village keeps growing.
I fear, that one day the Burmese point the canons at you.
THE BATTLE BY THE RIVER OF PRASOP
Ai Jan's mustache is the same size the horns of this buffalo.
And he is almost as smart as a buffalo.
His reputation is totally exaggerated.
But people here in the village blindly trusts, what is new.
When they see a shit in the field, they think, it is gold.
- Of all my heart I'm happy to see you.
- We are pleased to be here.
These strips of clothing were blessed by the Abbot. They bring luck.
- I would like to talk to the Abbot.
- Me too. We meet at Po Tan's house.
Come with me.
What can I do -
- make them show a little respect?
You are pissed (drunk)!
- How goes it, Ai Jan?
- I'm ready, Holy man.
I never thought, you would leave Khao Nang Buad.
I asked you to follow us into the jungle, but you refused.
Live in the jungle?
What about the children of the village?
Was I supposed to just leave them?
Is the temple here as good as the one in Khao Nang Buad?
My job is to preach and teach.
That is enough for me.
How are you, Holy man?
I'm fine.
And you, little disciple?
It is wartime, but i am neither wounded nor sick.
- Who has made you a monk?
- The Abbot has given me holy orders.
You have been gone for so long.
We didn't knew what happened to you.
The Abbot said, I could help you by doing good deeds.
You are blessed.
Your Mother would have been proud of you.
May she rest in piece.
Po Tan, this is Ai Jan.
Po Tan, you didn't had to come.
I would have visited you later.
Ai Jan,
I need to tell you something, -
- and the whole village has to hear it.
The Abbot told me, that you are a remarkable warrior.
The village needs skilled men, -
- especially now, because I'm wounded.
Unfortunately we have to face, -
- that the village is without a strong leader.
A leader and commander.
Ai Jan,
Will you be the leader of Bang Rajan?
We are just normal warriors.
But if you think, that I'm worthy,
I will not refuse.
You decide, how the guards must be placed.
Here is the town wall weakest.
The watercourse is a wall in itself.
Not one single time has the Burmese succeeded getting through here.
It is difficult to send an army through.
That man is a great warrior, even though he is drunk.
He always return from the battlefield dressed in Burmese armour.
Carry him back.
How do you feel about
Ai Jan started living in the jungle?
Isn't he worried about his wife and children?
Or have they already been killed?
Why are you so so interested in Ai Jan?
In here it's only you and me.
And you are far more interesting than the others.
Bua! My Bua!
I have seen traces of the Burmese canons.
I have spoken to Po Tan about that.
We should have canons as well.
I have written a request for weapons.
It has to be delievered in Ayudhya.
AYUDHYA
Wait here.
They are coming!
How much longer do we need to wait?
- Grab some food.
- Thanks.
Most people leave their villages and take refuge here.
But I insisted in fighting back the Burmese.
What are you made of, you folks from Bang Rajan?
We are not from Bang Rajan.
We origin from Ban Sri Bua Thong.
We cultivated the land and went hunting.
We lived a quiet peaceful life.
If you concentrate, you will not get hurt.
No blood can be spilled at an ordination ceremony.
Hurry and clean it up.
What's with you?
You have acted weird lately.
What keeps E Taeng Aon?
I will let go of you, when your grandma has heard about this.
Let him go, E Taeng Aon.
You rip his ear off.
That's what I call a big pig.
It was Ai In, who shot it, right?
No, it was Ai Muang.
Actually it's not that big.
There is hardly food for one person.
You are not so big a hunter, eh, Ai Muang?
Just say it. It wasn't you, who killed the pig, was it?
Well, don't you have anything to say?
Or have you forgotten to clean teeth?
You can say whatever you like.
But some day it will be my sword, which protects you.
It is Som!
Hey, Som. Are you on leave?
No, I deserted.
I came to participate in the ordination of my son.
But don't tell my mother.
She will get so nervous.
Juk! Juk, your father has returned!
No, don't do it!
Watch out, Ai Muang!
The people in Bang Rajan invited the survivors -
- to join them and live in their village.
We united in our hatred towards the Burmese.
We became more and more every day.
We knew, we couldn't run away.
Together we would fight back the Burmese.
It was here I became acquainted with a drunk -
- by the name Ai Tong Maen.
Even the monks raised weapons.
Soon the town's temple was empty.
We better take a look in the temple.
You can't kill him!
I beg you you to spare his life for my sake.
But he is Burmese.
Aren't they humans as well?
They feel the same pain as we do.
I can't ignore your command.
Where are you from?
From Bang Rajan. We want to offer you the post as our spiritual leader.
And so the monk Dhammachote started living in Bang Rajan.
In him the warriors found will, motivation and inspiration -
- to win every battle.
Do you wear the blessed clothing, every time you fight?
What can I do to get such a talisman?
You have been extremely kind, and we have nothing to offer in contrast.
We are happy to give you our clothing.
You really want to give them to us?
Is there found a decision?
May you live a long life.
Next time you sacrifice, spare a little for yourself.
How is your son doing?
He is dead. That's why
I brought food as offer.
So he wouldn't starve in the next life.
Po Tan, can you sharpen my sword?
Of cause. Just a moment.
Who's the owner of this axe?
It's enormous.
It belongs to Ai Tong Maen.
I can't barely lift it.
Ai Tong Maen, the drunk.
What kind of person is he?
I have asked myself that a lot of times. I still know nothing.
I only know, that he arrived lying on a wagon pissed.
And he has not been sober since.
Ai Tong Maen, here are your axes.
You are a skilled warrior. Why don't you teach the others your technic?
I'm not a teacher.
And besides, we all have to die anyway.
You talk as ugly, as you smell.
What did you say?
If you drink yourself to death, -
- what good are you, when the Burmese attack?
Ai Jan! They have returned from Ayudhya.
Ayudhya didn't give us any canons.
They don't want to help us.
They fear, that if Bang Rajan falls, -
- the Burmese will just have more canons.
You did your best.
It looks like, we are alone...
...more than before.
I suggest, that we build outposts in the trees -
- and have them guarded all time.
It will be like expanding the wall.
That makes us a little ahead.
It's a stupid idea.
Why should we wait?
It is better to attack them -
- than to sit around and wait for them.
I agree!
I have no idea, what you talk about.
If we do this...
...we improve safety in the village.
Hopefully you understand that.
Let me take the next watch.
Ai In, you get killed!
I will not stay here!
Let go of me! Let go!
It's me, Ai In.
I am still alive. Take it easy.
But soon you will die.
My family can't die here!
We are leaving! The Burmese are on their way!
Hurry up, E Taeng Aon!
This is the Abbot's medicine.
Rub it over the wound.
Don't worry, Mali.
For several days he has talked about going to Ayudhya.
If he does it,
I have to go with him.
I can't let him down.
Open the gate!
Is it you, Ai Jan?
Come inside and get a little to eat and drink.
Did I wake you up?
Some nights I can't sleep.
In nights I have also been standing guard, -
- like you do now.
Ai Jan...
The day, you talked about asking for canons from Ayudhya...
...I felt, that you were a strong and powerful leader.
I even dreamt about firing the canons myself against those damn Burmese.
If we just had those canons.
Everything would be easier.
I think, I have to be more strict towards the others. What do you think?
I have pointed you out as leader.
You must do, what you find wisest.
Stop!
Here are some blankets for the journey.
Safe travel, Mali og Ai Plang.
Your son will have grown big before next time we meet.
- Thanks. You are good friends to have.
- Good luck.
E Taeng Aon...
You scarred me.
Why do you follow me?
- Promise not to say anything.
- I promise.
You must teach me how to fight.
You said I was useless with a sword.
Have you changed your mind?
Will you teach me or not?
First you have to ask polite.
"Please?"
Please?
Please?
Ih, It makes my flesh crawl.
I don't want to learn anyway.
Your wrists are to thin.
Your hands are soft as a baby.
You are to weak to handle a sword.
Stop being so patronizing.
I was kidding.
I just wanted to say,
I think, you are beautiful.
Way too beautiful to run around killing people.
I will protect you from the Burmese.
I won't let them do you any harm.
I will protect you with my life.
Can I go now.
I meant, what I said.
- Where're you going?
- Home.
It is also my house.
Big jerk!
Why do you come here in this hour of the night?
We would like to have a relic, that can protect us in battle.
I don't have such a thing.
Relics exist only in your imagination.
Can we have the clothing, you are sitting on?
Ai Tong Maen.
You are pissed all day long.
Take this. It's from the Abbot.
It will bring us good luck.
It protects you from the enemy and your own recklessness.
Tie it around your arm, like Ai Jan does.
Then no weapon can harm you.
You idiot! What did you do that for?
You were right. You didn't got injured,
You just got a bump.
You idiot.
You should rather steal armour from the Burmese.
I have seen thousand of men wearing that strip and they were dead.
Can you see those bananapalms?
We pretend they are the Burmese.
What the hell are you doing?
You destroy the bananapalms.
I want to be able to take care of myself whatever might happen.
I want to survive.
Do you really know how to fight?
Of cause. I've watched the men training.
You think, that's enough to be good?
Get back to the kitchen.
I am hungry.
What do you say, my friend?
There is plenty of food for everybody.
- But it won't last forever.
- We need to fill the storehouses.
I overheard a conversation between the people from Ban Krab.
They said, that when they had to escape, their rice was almost ready to harvest.
By now it should be ready to harvest.
You watch the reaping.
We ride out and stand guard.
E Sa, you are tired. You need to rest.
What's wrong, E Sa?
Are you pregnant?
Have you told your husband?
Not yet.
I don't want to end up like Mali.
I couldn't bear that.
- Where is my wife?
- She suffered a slight indisposition.
Ai In doesn't need to worry about me.
Ai Muang said, you felt unwell.
Or are you lazy?
You just wanted to chat with E Taeng Aon?
You wife doesn't feel well, and then you talk to her like that.
Rest for a while.
I will harvest for you.
- Then I can harvest for you.
- Ai Muang!
Ai Tong Maen? What are you doing?
Jeg kind of got lost, but I managed to find my way.
- How did you get here?
- We have followed you.
Ai Jan, where have you been?
I have seen the Burmese.
They have captured prisoners.
Where? How many?
Around 30 soldiers.
They have taken 20 prisoners.
They are on their way through the nearby field.
What do we do?
We are not done harvesting.
We wait, 'till they reach the hill.
I give the sign.
Kill all of them. If we don't do that, we will not be able to finish reaping.
Ai In, take position at the hill.
You go that way.
The rest of you come with me.
What the hell are you doing?
Get going!
Wait for the sign.
- I can't go any further...
- Get up! Come on!
Fire!
Look what you have done Ai Tong Maen!
Ee is dead!
Grab Ai Tong Maen and lock him up.
Are you angry with Ai Jan because he locked up Ai Tong Maen?
I see it from both sides.
To me there is only one enemy and that's the Burmese.
THE BURMESE CAMP
BY WISETCHAICHAN
COMMANDER MANG-CHANGAI
E Taeng Aon?
Why are you awake at this hour?
I need to tell you something, Ai In.
I didn't want to wake you up.
Go back to sleep.
I am awake anyway.
Let me get you some water.
You don't need to do that.
I can do it myself.
But I always do it for you.
From now on you never have to do that sort of things.
You don't need to get water.
You don't have to harvest rice.
I will take over all your duties.
Then the others will say, that
I don't take good care of my husband.
E Taeng Aon has told me everything.
It has made everything clear to me.
I am unbelievable happy.
If it's a boy,
I will have him ordained.
Why didn't you tell me?
You are not surposed to keep secrets from your husband.
It was just a joke.
Don't get upset.
E Sa...
Why are you crying?
Is there anything else you haven't told?
I saw Mali and her little child.
Her husband worried so much, that he got injured in battle.
It must not happen to you.
You may not die from me...
Go back to sleep.
We can learn something from Mali.
What happend to them won't happen to us.
Never.
Now I understand, what it was Ai Tong Maen meant.
We can't wait for the Burmese. we have to retaliate.
Last time I stood guard, -
- I saw some Burmese deserters sail down the stream.
It just came to me, we ought to attack them from the riverside.
If everybody agrees, let's do it.
But who will be on guard then?
- You stand guard, Sing.
- Why me?
We can't all go.
Somebody has to stay back home.
You stay as well, Ai Muang.
Stay and protect the village.
No I want to go.
It's not doable. Ai Jan will discover if too many of us are missing.
Let us get going.
Tonight we give a Burmese commander a columbian necktie!
- Where are you going?
- We are fugitives heading for Bang Rajan.
- Is this the right way?
- Just continue straight ahead.
Wait!
Wait! What's in the back of you wagons?
Don't let him escape!
Kill them!
Get back!
None must escape!
Ai Jan, let me out!
Ai In? Ai In?
Ai Jan, let me out!
Hurry inside.
Let me out!
Close the gate!
E Taeng Aon!
It was you who stood guard.
How could the Burmese get inside?
Why do you blame Ai In?
You can see he is wounded.
Enough, Ai Muang.
It's my fault. I left my post.
Myself and some men went to their camp to kill their commander.
My actions are unforgivable.
Punish me as it suits you.
Decapitate him!
He deserves to die!
I can't allow that.
Ai In did what he felt was right.
Han put his own life in danger in order to kill their commander!
How many of you are brave enough to do that?
Ai In, you know you acted wrong.
Don't let it happen again.
Look what we have been exposed to!
And you let him off with a warning?
Then decapitate him yourself.
My son is dead becasue of you!
E Sa!
E Sa! E Sa!
It was wrong of me to leave you.
It was wrong of me to leave my post.
It was wrong of me to lead my friends to their death.
I swear -
- I will make it up for all my actions.
The Burmese have conquered everything with exceptance of Ayudhya.
Will Ayudhya help?
If not, we have to surrender to the Burmese.
It's better to be slave than to be dead.
I have never seen you up here before.
There is something I want to say.
All the inhabitants are running.
Women, children... everybody.
They take what's possible and run.
Ai Tong Maen, why did you decide to come here?
It was not a choice.
I was drunk and fell asleep on a wagon.
When I woke up I was here.
Sometimes I wish I were like you.
Without a responsibility.
I ought to move back to the jungle.
Then I wouldn't have the responsibility for other peoples lives.
Ai Jan...
What I wanted to say was that you have done everything you could.
Those of us who are left know it's a matter of life and death.
We don't know when we are going to die.
We only know what is happening rigth now.
In the past I thought the only one to look after me was my father.
But then I saw you put your life in danger to save me.
Now I know that you care about me too.
When I came to Bang Rajan
I often went down here.
So I sat here...
...and thought about starting family.
Maybe begin to farm.
E Taeng Aon, would you like to live together with me?
Can you protect your family with that tiny bow, Ai In?
It's for our son.
How old must he be before he can play with it?
One day I will learn him how to use it, so he can protect you.
Po Tan, you ought to go to Ayudhya, while you still can.
I am going nowhere. Look at my wounds.
I would die before I came anywhere.
Do you think I could be any use if I stay?
A lot of the inhabitants have already packed their things and left.
We are almost no warriors left.
What is your plan Ai Jan?
Ayudhya wouldn't help, so I came instead.
Jeg bring drawings with me so you can build your own canons.
We don't have metal enough.
Unload the armour!
Fire!
THE BURMESE CAMP BY
THE PRASOP RIVER
COMMANDER NEMEAO
GENERAL OF THE BURMESE ARMY
Bang Rajan has once again fought us back.
If we don't crush them before more people joins them...
They will keep attack us from behind.
Then we'll have to fight on two frontiers.
Prepare for battle.
We are going to Wisetchaichan.
THE BURMESE CAMP
BY WISETCHAICHAN
Our troops at the north frontier wait for us at Ayudhya.
But if we can't defeat that lousy village.
What's the problem Mang-Changai?
COLONEL SUKI
What are you afraid of? Continue!
Let me speak to that officer.
Suki, you are in charge of the slaves, right?
You are a brave man.
Are you not afraid of loosing your head?
In my opinion -
- a golden Buddha is more worth than a couple of felt-down bars.
But if the commander doesn't like my golden gift...
...then I must have my head cut off.
But who else is able of giving you such a gift?
Do you think you can achieve what
Mang-Changai isn't able of doing?
Mang-Changai says he can't defeat Bang Rajan, -
- because their monk is so powerful.
- What would you do in his place?
- Kill the monk.
- Only women and children.
- Yes, Sir.
It was the Burmese...
They took all women and children.
Wait for me here.
Daeng, you get Ai Jan.
I shall slaugther all of them!
In this life and the next!
I slaugther them!
Help me cut them down.
We bury them proprely in the village.
- Who are these two?
- My wife and child.
I came too late!
Each time
I have been attacking the Burmese, -
- I hoped to find my wife and child.
What kind of human can be that cruel -
- and then proudly display his deeds?
This is for you.
You knew, how to do it?
I once had a family.
I know, how to honour the dead.
Ai Jan og Ai Tong Maen...
Your families have now found peace.
It is us, who still are in this world, which has to suffer.
But we don't have to suffer for all eternity.
You have to teach the farmers to be strong and determined.
Stop!
Burmese soldiers!
We are here to defeat the enemy and capture their capital, -
- not to torture and murder country people, like we were common thieves.
You coward!
With that softness you just let these outcasts grow stronger.
The canons are broken.
Ai In, if there really is a life after this one...
...I want to be reborn as your woman.
No matter if our child is a boy or a girl, -
- I pray to, we also have a child in our next lives.
Fire!
Kill 'em!
E Taeng Aon!
Ai In...
If there is a life after this one, -
- I want to be reborn as your woman.
No matter if our child is a boy or a girl, -
- I pray to, we also have a child in our next lives.
Does he use magic or what?
Let's see, if it works.
If swords doesn't hurt him, we have to hammer him down.
Aim!
Fire!
They were so few.
But as you see,
- they were willing to give their lives to defend their honour and home.
They were indeed brave.
If all in this country are as brave as those from Bang Rajan, -
- Ayudhya will be difficult to conquer.
During the Burmese army's conquest against Ayudhya -
- all the Siamese soldiers fleet and evacuated the city.
The very same army had been hold back for five month -
- by a single small village.
Eight times during 1765-66 the inhabitants of Bang Rajan resisted -
- the Burmese army's attack.
When Bang Rajan finaly gave in, the Burmese forces surrounded Ayudhya.
Within a year the city was destroyed and the Siamese forces beaten.
Siam remained fragmented, until the future king Taksin the Great, -
- united the Siamese people in one kingdom.
The Siamese people had regained their freedom, -
- and they have kept it since.
Puhhh... hard work done
At the Berlin Conference in 1885
Africa was divided.
Congo, became the personal property of Belgian King Leopold I.
On June 30, 1960, the nationalist
Patrice Lumumba, 36, became
The first Prime Minister of the new independent state.
He would last only months.
This is a true story.
Nobody knew about that night in Katanga.
Nobody was allowed to know.
Their mission was clear.
Retrieve three bodies and then disappear.
No grave, no memory...
Even in death they were afraid of me.
Will you help me?
The children may not know everything that happened, do you?
They probably wouldn't understand.
Tell them not ...
Say nothing.
You acted in the name of Congo, but not your party
Is not representative.
- It's now Lumumba's turn.
Let him continue talking.
Right,
The MNC does not represent
 every Congolese. Not yet.
But Tshombe of CONAKAT 
Katanga does not represent all of Congo.
Our party is big, yours is nothing.
There are 250 parties in Congo.
Plus those founded by the Belgians.
Mr. Kasavubu could take power
 but he does not have support in Accra.
But what am I to do give out visas?
Why did the government go it alone?
Ask them.
So you could sell your Polar beer to the Minister.
He could have 51% of the vote.
I did not know.
You know many things, starting with the protocol.
Is this a joke?
Not at all.
Please read the full text of my speech, not in newspapers.
I should talk about you and your rich province.
But I do not see the Congo as tribes and provinces, but as a whole.
We need to move beyond provincialism.
Do we have to hear your speech once again?
Do you think you're still in Accra?
You are two people, I represent many more.
We have 10,000 people. I could get CONAKAT not to mention Tshombe if you like.
At the next Pan-African
Conference
I will be happy to talk about your big party.
He derides.
- Your irony is inappropriate and insulting.
I can only say:
Read my speech.
Or not. But there will be no rewrite.
You travel a far to sell your beer.
Stay away from my region.
Because we do not forget.
Yes, I made some mistakes.
And it would all end badly.
We thought it our destiny to decide our country's fate but other, more powerful enemies were in control.
Why did they fear me so much?
When they eventually killed me, they made me more important.
I was but one vote for the dream of freedom and fraternity.
Words they could not accept.
But they were just words.
Everything was nevertheless a good start.
Do you remember?
I came from Stanleyville
A colonial administrative clerk, third class.
I was 30 and at the height of my career.
But my job was not
What I had imagined,
But I suppose I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.
Patrice Lumumba.
You can speak to the people.
Such a person we need.
The people here are hard.
After the triumph of Kasavubu some businesses flourished,
But not ours ...
We are on our last legs.
If you can do things to help business resume ...
It is even said that our beer causes impotence.
That is how far they will go.
If you can save the business
You will get a salary of Deputy Director.
Good salary, right?
It's very good, Director.
Within a month we will need to see improvements.
Can I do what I want?
- If you want ...
Come closer, my friends.
Test, it's free.
Girls?
- Beer, slyboots.
And not just beer. The best!
The King of beers. Polar!
I sold beer. Why not?
Polar or Primus, they all left me cold.
I was in the capital, that is what was important.
I love Primus.
Long live King Kasa.
Here is the competition.
Long live Congo!
Long Live Free Congo!
Long live independence!
That's strong language. Come here.
Take a Polar. At my expense.
When I met Joseph, he was an army sergeant but also an aspiring journalist.
And you?
- Joseph-Desire Mobutu.
To our health.
To our future!
He was not Mobutu Sese Seko
Kuku Ngwendu Wasahanga,
Father of the Nation.
Not yet.
Congo was still a Belgian colony.
Lumumba?
- Here I am. 
Along there.
Name?
Lumumba. Patrice, Emery.
You 're judicial file.
And you hope to travel?
Is that my visa?
Yes, you're lucky. Or have good connections.
Fork on the left!
Indigenous children learn to work and study, but are only interested in relaxation.
I do not speak Flemish!
Can you open this?
If the teacher loses the pedals, take over the primitive methods ...
Like only a small handful of others
I got my card identifying me as a "civilized person".
She showed me just how to buy alcohol in the European quarter.
Throughout the DRC?
- It wsa very Congo.
For political Lessons we used the gym, the association of employees, the association's indigenous staff and the Congregation of the Virgin.
No collaboration, but civil disobedience.
80 years is enough!
First the slave trade, the ivory trade and then killing for rubber.
Now we sell diamonds, copper, manganese and zinc.
Everyone knows that independence is imminent.
Uhuru! Viva! Viva!
Independence!
Do you remember it now?
The year 1959?
With its enthusiasm, the anger and its violence?
What nobody predicted was that everything would change.
MNC in the middle.
We will see that later.
It's King Baudouin. Come and listen.
They will admit.
... that everything leads to this one decisive step
In the life of
Our African peoples.
I owe it to my illustrious predecessors, the pioneers of our work in Africa ...
Do they keep anything on hand.
No, they've lost the north.
Then they have lost.
De Gaulle has admitted that little Belgium has no choice.
We're going to eat them!
You know, Maurice, they will think you were are cannibal.
A what?
Someone who eats human flesh.
If that is so,
I will begin immediately.
We decided for Congo without delay, and without haste ...
Run!
... that without which a democratic regime there is nothing more than deceit and tyranny.
Let him go!
To do this you will pay!
6 months later
Look.
The director was right.
He is smuggling out messages.
Bastard!
"I strongly protest ...
I demand my release as leader of MNC I am a delegate and participate in the Round Table
In Brussels. "
The pretentious monkey!
Do you think we are so stupid as to release you while show subversive behavior the very reason you're here?
You sit for two years and we take care of you, boy.
Do you see yourself in Brussels?
What would you say to the King?
What would you say to Bwana Kitoko?
He wants to be minister.
They all want to be minister.
Want to be decorated?
We'll decorate you.
Want to be called Excellency?
Is that it monkey?
Should we say Sir?
We found this.
Why is he bleeding?
- As usual. He protested.
We intervened and he defended himself.
Mr. Lumumba,
I've received orders from Brussels.
The Minister of Congo has requested that you are present at the Round Table Conference.
You are free to go.
Tomorrow there is a plane to Brussels.
Take it.
Patrice, welcome!
Good to see you.
How are you?
Will you go and meet Mr. Kasavubu?
- I will meet all Aboko representatives.
How is your relationship with Mr. Kasavubu?
- Very good.
Do you want to meet with European investors?
- Of course.
What are your expectations?
- They are high.
Will you meet with the Belgian Ministers?
I'm just a poor woman.
There are millions of us.
In their name I salute a freedom fighter.
Thank you, ma'am.
Do you think the MNC has a chance?
Were you wounded on board?
- In prison. It's nothing.
Tell me about Brussels.
- It's a beautiful city.
I mean the Round Table.
- Everyone is talking about you.
Which room?
- Room three!
There are no more oranges.
Three Flamingos in 1926.
Who goes to the third floor?
- Send Mathieu.
I do Bomboko.
What you see in this clown?
He has class.
- No, gratuities.
Make way!
There's work to be done.
No, no, no you can not leave now.
It's not over yet.
Back to top.
- Let us go.
Mr. Lumumba will meet you at 7 pm
Not now.
What do you mean
"Vague impulses independence"?
It's a reality.
Yes, it is stretchable.
It is not our fault that the date is not yet known.
Mr. Kasavubu, how nice to meet you.
I say that it is a crime.
You attach too much importance to a word.
Independence. A word?
God is a word but I believe it.
So we will end up giving the Congo to the Communists.
As France did in Algeria.
Anyone without a political mandate is to leave.
Men ...
Joseph, did you hear me?
- I do not understand.
I am a MNC deputy.
- But aren't you studying in Belgium?
Yes, but ...
This is for delegates from Congo.
I am a MNC deputy.
Joseph, it is the Rules of the Common Front.
Let them experiment with freedom.
Either way they will give Africa one of two lessons,
The European example of united, hardworking nation ... or the other primitive, that has been surpessed will return.
And then ...
And then?
We have an army, militias, planes, tanks.
We have the two largest parties.
We should take a common position.
You think to show a compromise?
Independence on June 15?
The minister will refuse.
Would you like us to give way on a date?
A Common Front would give us more coverage.
They want to save time.
Why?
Do they need to prepare their retreat?
Or to plot against us?
Conspiracy dismantlement?
Union Miniere in Katanga.
The copper, the diamonds ...
They will leave that to our government?
We have no government.
Wait for the elections.
We're not there yet.
I ask you
What should they do with independence?
It's not a nation, it strains already.
The Lulua's hate the Baluba's
Baluba's hate and the Bakongo's.
And canthe Bakongo and the Bengala's tolerate eachother?
The colonial administration holds them together.
And when that disappears.
- What then?
We must not make the same mistake as the French.
With their African executives.
Judges, police, the postal service.
All high positions are held by Belgians.
Without them, there will be chaos.
Good, good.
It is June 30 then.
Independence's a fact.
There remains one question: will she be federalist, as you want, or unitarian, as I want.
I will make a press release and we will both sign.
Let me read the text first.
Do you know the latest hit?
Leopoldville, May 1960
We won.
Their coalitions failed.
We did well?
- Even better than Abako.
In Leopoldville too?
- Of course not.
What is "president", Daddy?
- Nothing. Eat.
We must continue.
Until the end.
You do not know what you say, Maurice.
Anyway.
Half a revolution is not possible.
We must throw out the Flemish.
Expropriate the missionaries.
Chase out all the parasites
All the officer castes.
And who will replace them?
They can go to hell!
We did not need them.
You will not have it easy.
I know, but one thing must be clear.
Should I show a government form or is it to be an information circular? an Information Round with an eye to forming the government second.
I do not understand it yet.
The independence ceremony is on June 30.
If we have no government, as my unofficial mission is ...
It's an official mission.
Let me organize things as I was told by His Majesty.
Information first, then formation.
All in good time.
I will do my best.
But remember, time is short.
Good luck, Mr. Information.
I accuse Minister Ganshof and the duplicity of the Belgian Government, which I consider as dangerous to me and the government I want to form.
Brussels prefers a Congo without a leader on June 30
Instead of a Lumumba government.
In these circumstances there will be no head of state to on June 30.
Neither from my party nor our allies
The appointment will need
Mr. Kasavubu approval.
CONAKAT, but not Tshombe.
The coalition will not stand days.
Even as Commissioner of the Katanga province?
We can find better.
For Finance I accept your candidate.
But I want Thomas Kanza as Minister at the V.N.
His father was last year expelled from our party.
It gives me no pleasure.
The son is not the father.
He'll do a good job.
Gentlemen ...
Today is the day.
The Nationalist Block which I chair, will put forward the candidacy of Mr. Kasavubu for the post of President of the Republic.
I never disputed that it deserves that title.
My first act will be the appointment
Mr. Lumumba as Prime Minister of the Government of National Unity.
Unity, which is what the Congo now needs.
Is it not true that Katanga is not represented in the government?
Do you not fear separation?
Katanga is represented.
More than Tshombe in Katanga and Munungo.
No more questions.
Congo is united and will remain so.
Is that enough?
United or not, we want to emphasize this.
And money! And comfort!
And no more Flemish people who give orders!
No more bullying!
It's enough!
Moreover, we must cut their grass and our wives do their dishes.
We get so little bit and we do everything.
Come on. Sit with us.
We can not directly change anything.
I asked for a general amnesty to the king and promotions for you.
June 30 will be shown to be a memorable day.
Without distinction of rank, province or tribe.
For the unified nation.
United!
I'm going to sleep. Until tomorrow.
It's Tshombe and the full CONAKAT party.
I'll go back to Elizabeth City.
Yesterday I waited all day for the list of ministers.
You promised me that you'd send them to me.
We sent them on.
- Liar!
What's he saying?
- Slow down, Maurice.
Apparently you already know the list?
A lot of extremists.
We will use all the means of the unified structures of the country to fight.
All resources?
And you will deny the democratic vote?
- I suppose you'd prefer Communism.
Communism ...
We are no more communist than you
Do not argue with them, Thomas. They are fascists.
I do not like that tone!
That's independence.
Well, we're not done.
What a lot of dust!
Can we be that bad that we cannot leave a few paintings?
But they are owned by the Belgian state.
It's a direct order.
Run for your life. The Bantus are here.
Sire, they give away your Congo and make a pigsty.
They even showed them the wine cellar.
The governor has not bored of it.
Does no one answer the phone?
No, Governor Cornelis does not live here anymore.
He does not live here anymore.
This is the residence of Patrice Lumumba,
Prime Minister of Congo.
Already five months
I have not slept.
Are you tired, Daddy?
Give me that.
Read this and tell me what you think.
What time is it?
When will the car be here?
It cannot happen, Sir!
And not because I chair the ceremony, but because it's provocative.
Who provoked the first?
I have the speech of the King and the President is not in support.
They've refused an amnesty,
A symbolic gesture that is essential for the ceremony.
I appointed you as President of the Senate because I thought you had character.
Am I to be made wrong?
You need him to give the word.
Kasa Once is finished,
Patrice takes the microphone.
They should stay and listen.
You want the King, General Janssens, the bishop ...
The King, the General, the Bishop ...
That I forgot.
Exactly. Let them listen to the truth.
That's something different. For everyone.
Good.
Patrice, do you really have to say?
The independence of the Congo is the continuation of a process that resulted from the genius of King Leopold I, by him with growing courage a process started and was continued with conviction by Belgium.
When Leopold I began this enormous work, now completed, 
He did not do so as the conqueror but as an advocate of civilization.
It's up to you, gentlemen, to prove that we were right to trust you.
Avoid the name of the King.
Avoid rapid reforms and not replace Belgian institutions unless you are certain you can do better.
Gentlemen, the eyes of the world are on you.
May God protect the Congo!
Excellencies, dear compatriots,
Now, officially, the Republic of Congo appears on the world map, a fully independent and sovereign ...
Patrice, it's too dangerous.
You've improved.
You know what you're doing?
Do you really think you can tackle them?
- You heard him.
We must respond.
What will our children remember?
Kasa answers.
Listen to what he says.
Sire, your presence on this memorable day proves once again your concern for the people you loved and protected.
We will not disappoint you.
My dear compatriots, victors of the independence struggle,
For this independence of the Congo, even as it is celebrated today with Belgium a friendly country with whom we deal as equal to equal no Congolese worthy of the name will ever be able to forget that it was by fighting that it has been won a day-to-day fight, an ardent and idealistic fight, a fight in which we were spared neither privation nor suffering, and for which we gave our strength and our blood.
We are proud of this struggle, of tears, of fire, and of blood, to the depths of our being, for it was a noble and just struggle, and indispensable to put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed upon us by force because we were black.
Who could forget the shootings which claimed so many victims, the cells in which those were locked up who escaped the bullets of the soldiers that were used to dominating us?
All this, brethren, has made us suffer and our wounds are too fresh and painful to erase them from our memory.
All this, brethren, we proclaim loudly, is now forever and ever behind us.
The Congolese Republic has been declared.
Our country belongs to our children.
We are now all able to benefit from social justice and our children will benefit from our country.
Your Majesty,
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, compatriots, fellow strugglers, black brothers that is what I have wanted to say.
Long live independence and African Unity!
Long live the independent
Congo and its sovereignty!
There! Let's get him
And teach him a lesson!
Treason!
Get out!
Accelerate!
Let's go!
These are but isolated incidents.
Hardy also has a rebel camp.
The officers have been taken hostage.
They want you
They say they want to kill you.
Unbelievable.
What about Jones?
Silence.
Get your reports.
We will carry out all investigations calmly.
Minister Mpolo.
The Force Publique has 25,000 men.
They have stations aligned along the same wavelength.
They know everything in each camp before their officers.
They are crazy!
What do they want?
They want promotions!
I know, I heard them.
If I may, Prime Minister, they are tired.
Five months on end: riots, celebrations ...
- The Flemish General,
Janssens, puts them against us.
And he is against African officers.
Let us shoot him.
- There is no replacement.
I suggest Senator Lundula.
And you, Mpolo as Colonel.
Let us take a vote.
I will not vote for someone who wants to shoot anyone.
Even that is not military.
Mr. Prime Minister,
I was 7 years in the Force Publique.
I do not deny his qualities, but I think I am more proficient ...
- An excellent suggestion.
The new commander must come from its own ranks.
What is that?
Let us in!
We want the minister to speak first!
They are crazy! What do they want?
Where is the military discipline?
There they are!
Excellence ...
We do nothing. We have a petition.
We want an answer. Directly from you.
Give me the petition.
I will study it.
No, Sir! We want an answer now!
"We wish our military to be disciplined to carry out our mission and accuse General Janssens of unfair behavior.
We demand honesty and impartiality, which is impossible with officers in the Congolese army."
You mean white officers?
We do not want them!
- Black officers!
No officers!
I understand that you want equality and justice.
But I do not yield weapons.
I ask you to return to your barracks.
We have a strong, obedient army.
We've heard it all!
Jones speaks so!
- Answer now!
You are not even in mutual agreement.
I understand your indignation.
And I will got to 
Leopold and speak to the camp, in the morning. You have my word.
Now I ask you to return to your barracks.
Come on then, shoot.
You will come to Camp Leopold?
I promise you
We have 15 white officers hostage and their wives.
If you do not come,
We will murder them.
Gentlemen, the meeting is not over.
Hey, you there!
Damn Flemish!
Wait!
Maxence, come in!
They do not scare me.
I will write down their numbers.
You'll see what happens!
Idiot!
You hear me, motherfucker?
Dork!
Losers!
You're a disgrace' to the regiment.
You are not alone.
There are assholes everywhere, across the province.
In Madimba a white woman was raped.
They were shot!
You shame the Force Publique.
You are arrested.
Take them away!
Let me be clear.
Independence is for the citizens.
For soldiers there is only discipline.
Before June 30 you had white officers.
After June 30 you still have white officers.
It may be that the politicians said something
 else, but they lied.
I have always told the truth.
And if you do not understand
I will write it for you.
After independence equals for independence.
What are you saying, white?
So you will not go.
They have deceived us.
They lied.
We will not go.
Are you coming to bed?
I must finish.
You will sleep again at your desk.
Do not worry.
How can I not worry?
You sleep no more than 2 hours a night.
I will start to think that you are actually using marijuana.
They say that?
You have no idea what the servants tell me.
You have to be strong for the children.
If something were to happen to me ...
General, you know why you're here?
I wait until you tell me.
And I await your explanation.
I got the telegram.
- That's obvious.
Excellency!
- Excuse me?
You say, Excellency.
I want to know what you mean by:
"I myself do not contradict nor repeated.
Please consider this as a final warning. "
A General in Belgium obeys his superiors
So speak?
Excuse me, sir.
In Belgium there is order.
Here we are heading for disaster, and there is chaos.
Because your men and your methods are tired.
The Force Publique has to change like the rest.
I expect your resignation.
Mr. Lumumba ...
Excellence ...
- I've said what I have to say ...
General.
Get out!
Flemish or Walloon?
- Walloons.
100 francs.
- Why?
What's going on?
Nothing.
- Why, sir?
The Belgian ambassador.
Let him through the garden.
Do you have news, Mr. Ambassador?
Nothing that you do not know.
It's bad.
You were chased out of Camp Leopold.
But order will be restored.
I do not know what order you want, but I still cannot watch while my countrymen are murdered.
If you do not have the means, I do, and they are at your disposal.
An intervention?
- The situation is serious.
You can ask assistance from Belgium.
You have the right.
- I have a different opinion.
If you refuse, I will have to consult with our Atlantic partners.
Do you understand?
- Not yet.
But this is what I've decided.
First, General Janssens should leave Congo within 24 hours.
Secondly, you should warn him and guarantee his departure.
Thirdly, you are responsible for his actions during his departure.
He served Congo, Your Excellency.
He deserves respect and courtesy.
- Courtesy!
It's the fault of the Belgians: the uprising in the Camp, in this City
Camp Leopold, Elizabeth City ...
You spread rumours of a Soviet invasion...
Since the beginning
You've worked to conspire against me.
And now you threaten me with the U.N. and NATO
In the middle of the night to the Prime Minister!
Tomorrow I will hold a press conference and make your conspiracy, threats and insults public.
I've been advised to go to Brazzaville, but count me out.
Belgians will murder me there.
I complain and you become angry.
Allow me but I find that strange.
Then, I would ask you to leave.
I hereby absolve General Janssens.
For his own good and safety.
I ask him the travel by air at the first available opportunity.
I appoint Major Victor Lundula to
Supreme Commander of the Force Publique
I have also promoted Joseph Mobutu to colonel.
The Force Publique is now
The Congolese National Army.
The Belgians are worried.
How will you fight the atrocities?
These difficulties are inevitable.
They are caused by a few agitators and a big misunderstanding.
I have decided to stop them
President Kasavubu and myself
I will make a journey of peace throughout the country.
Are you going to Katanga?
- Everywhere.
Elisabethville, Coquilhatstad,
Stanleyville, Luluaburg ...
But I warn the
Belgian Government the situation must not be misused for a military intervention or to encourage riots.
Only had work can make us move forward.
Those who refuse to see and sabotage us, are enemies of the people.
What does Mr. Tshombe say about it?
- Will you go to U.N. ?
"Katanga, our beautiful and prosperous
Province, the largest source ...
... The main source of our wealth. "
What time is it in Elizabeth City?
Just as late in Luluaburg?
No idea. I only hope that this is the last stop.
We've travelled everywhere, all in 10 days.
I'm tired of this plane.
Congo is too big for us.
Do not say that. Congo is big and requires great things.
But it is not too large.
"Who says secession, says treason."
We're descending?
Airport Elizabeth City refuses to let us land.
I repeat, you can not land.
Orders from the government of Katanga.
What government?
This is it. Secession.
We can receive President Kasa Vubu, but the traitor Patrice Lumumba will never set foot in Katanga.
- That's Munongo.
Begin our descent.
- Impossible.
Do what I say!
- Impossible.
They have placed a truck on the runway.
We can not but go back.
We have underestimated Tshombe.
He does not do this alone.
The Belgians have encouraged him.
What do we do now?
We can choose war, shame, resignation and the loss of 70% of our resources.
We have no choice.
We must suppress the uprising.
By Union Miniere, the entire financial world is involved.
Imagine. The whole of Katanga.
It's 16 times bigger than Belgium.
They do not get such a gift.
We will call on the U.N..
Is that the best solution?
For a military operation the Russians ...
The Russians, and have them say that I a 
Communist puppet. The CIA would surely murder me?
What a calm.
It is wonderful, the silence.
Why are we going to Njili?
We said Stanleyville.
I got other directions.
You are under our command.
We decide not you.
I am Belgian, Excellency.
Attention!
Mr. President, Where do you want the troops to take up position?
Is it a trap.
It is strange that the President has these troops to behold?
No way!
Go provide a car.
Mr. President, our troops are here in order to honor and protect you.
You need them to take up position.
We refuse. You are no longer with you
Mr. President,
We welcome you with the honor you deserve.
Never mind. Go away.
Mr. President, you do not speak against "one" Belgian officer.
Look at those women.
They were raped by your troops.
Our men were assaulted.
You shame Africa and the world.
We are here to protect our citizens.
There should be no flow of blood.
If blood is flowing tonight, you are responsible.
Murderers!
- Bastards!
Murderers, sadists!
You raped nuns and white women!
The humiliation would not end.
They were ready for anything.
Even sacrificing their own citizens.
They needed someone to blame for all this.
They had, at any cost, the rebel silenced.
Hands on your head!
Out!
Get down!
Paratroopers!
The Belgian paratroopers are everywhere!
The white officers have hidden the ammunition!
They removed the paratroopers there!
Send troops to the airport!
Let the Russians come are not countries!
They've evacuated their families!
They will kill us all!
Is this photograph necessary?
Do not worry.
We'll pay for everything.
It will be in every ministry, every school every store and bar.
Excuse me.
We will not make it.
We follow him in two months.
Fix it?
- It's war, Patrice.
The U.N. is talking about genocide.
The U.N. is manipulated the U.S.A..
Anyway,
There are hundreds of deaths.
You had Kasai recaptured with no organized massacre.
And what have you achieved?
Most of leaders have fled to Katanga.
We checked Kasai.
- It was one massacre.
War means killing, kill or be killed. That's the price.
Who pays?
Always the same!
So far I've got you covered.
But I do not support such atrocities.
Mr. Prime Minister ...
- Enough comedy!
I am a soldier and an officer.
I have proven this.
I took over the Force Publique.
I follow orders ... if any.
And if there are none ...
I make my own decisions.
Women, children, old people. Trapped in a church and killed?
Is that what you decided?
Answer!
No, obviously not.
But this is war.
And a war is always dirty.
It makes people crazy with fear.
And at such times orders are useless.
You let it happen.
You have not executed the guilty.
Do you know what that will cost?
I will be held responsible.
You will isolate me even more.
You're not alone. I'm on your side.
You're not by my side.
You stand behind me.
I do not want a murderer by my side, and certainly not behind me.
What do you mean?
You should go!
Is that clear?
That's it.
Good.
Very well. Directly.
The president can see you now.
Mr. Timberlake, nice to see you.
I tried to reach you at the embassy.
I am far away.
- Everyone is lately.
My government has a proposal.
- A proposal?
I want to listen, but I doubt the reliability of the U.S..
You've probably heard the Bantu proverb:
"The hand that gives, prevails."
And your hand to me seems far too heavy. Excuse me.
Mr. Prime Minister ...
I am very worried.
The Congolese army ...
- I know.
The slaughter in Kasai.
I am appalled.
I'm talking to the guilty.
The Congo is not.
The problem remains with Katanga.
Our undisciplined troops have committed atrocities and U.N. betrays us by giving passive support to the Belgians.
Ghana supports us, along with Guinea but they have no money.
Do you have a solution?
The Russians.
They promise us airplanes, military advisers ...
And troops for Lundula.
He will replace Mobutu, whom I distrust.
Were you not afraid that the Russians would bring you into disrepute?
That was long ago.
We were already discredited.
What a beautiful place.
And so quiet.
I must insist.
May I ask the Russians?
I'd like to go with a better plan.
If you have one I'll run with it immediately.
I have none.
Joseph, now you have your own men ...
As long as they are paid ...
- Paid and trained.
We're investing in
Congo's future.
The future for us all.
I'll be honest with you
Kasavubu has disappointed us.
And Lumumba is in charge.
We need someone who will work with us.
I've been thinking.
I think about it constantly.
I guarantee you everything.
Eisenhower?
- Kennedy.
What will I win there?
Everything.
We interrupt our program to air a statement from the President.
Value compatriots,
Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, appointed by the Belgian king has denied his role.
He has ruled in an arbitrary manner.
He drags the country into in a terrible civil war.
Hence I think it is necessary that it must end immediately.
I ask the Congolese army and our brothers to stop the killings and that the weapons across the republic to fall temporarily silent.
Where's Justin?
- Gone to eat.
And Dieudonné?
- Yet again.
There's nobody here.
Take the car keys.
Where are you going?
- Parliament.
What is happening is outrageous!
Mr. Kasavubu can not dissolve what has been elected by the people!
We turned to no effort.
For the moment the Congo has enjoyed the admiration of the world
Kasavubu has given us a heavy blow and has dragged the Congo through the mud.
Silence!
The Prime Minister has the word.
Mr. President, respectable gentlemen,
I speak to you because it is my duty to inform you of events.
Too late!
- Congratulations!
I've never been against Kasavubu.
In any case, because
He is president and because of my actions.
It's true!
- Easy to say!
Some delegates, also in opposition, do not agree and say that he is a separatist.
The danger they fear is a reality.
He's right.
If the elected representatives of the people demand
Kasavubu to leave, he is deposed.
Do it!
Millions were spent on radio campaign against me.
Every day there has been a psychological battle fought.
In order to mislead the people
I have been named
Dictator Lumumba, Lumumba Communist,
Lumumba Moscow etc.
When we fought in the early days for our independence, was I prompted by the Russians?
Did I ask the Russians to the independence negotiations?
Who has given us 80 years of exploitation?
We are not the imperialists?
Queen Elizabeth is President of the Belgian-Russian association.
Does it show me to be a Communist?
If they hold Lumumba in contempt,
Lumumba then is the black sheep.
But actually they go on to attack the future of the Congo.
Dear brothers,
I appeal to your wisdom, your Bantu wisdom.
The situation is worse than you think.
We must unite, because divided we cannot save our country.
Let us forget our divisions.
Pauline?
Acute hepatitis.
We need urgent action.
Have you seen her?
- A Treasure. She looks like you.
What will she be called?
I thought of Marie-Christine.
They will bring her to Switzerland.
They say it's her only chance.
They hid that from me.
I want my baby.
You were not in Parliament.
What is it?
- The thick ...
The President wants me to arrest you.
I wanted to warn you.
And you say I'm involved 
I am a soldier.
I never butt in on political conflicts.
Have your men surrounded the house?
A Security measure.
I am not under arrest, but my house is surrounded?
For your own safety.
Many people want you dead.
My wife or my supporters,
Whom should I fear?
Send your men away.
- Is that a request or will you show me a warrant?
It's an order!
- Kasa you have been deposed.
And for you, he is not president anymore.
What would you do in my place?
I know you. This decision is not yours alone.
Who stands behind you?
Who?
Out of this impasse the army has neutralized
President Kasavubu and
Lumumba as Prime Minister.
This is not a military coup, just a peaceful revolution.
Will there be free elections?
But politicians have been arrested?
Is this a coup?
No military power will take control.
Again, this is not a coup.
What are the Americans doing?
- Involved in a Peaceful Revolution.
We are neutral Congolese and foreign technicians, we chose them, to ask for help to save our country.
Long live General Mobutu!
Not so fast.
Where's Lumumba?
- Do you support the Belgians?
How is payment reform going?
Has Lumumba been convicted?
The phone is still working, but for how long?
I will not wait until I am isolated.
There's a simple solution.
We go to Stanleyville and start from scratch.
Why?
We are neutralized. and I'm trapped and Mr. Kasavubu's a free man.
Katanga? You're kidding.
If you want to drown your dog ... then you don't torture him with shallow water.
Yes, I'm still here.
Excuse me.
I just read that my daughter has died.
I can not even go to her funeral.
I cannot do anything.
Thomas, it's you.
I am determined.
We cannot tay here any longer.
Yes, I know.
I cannot stay here under house arrest while my supporters are being killed.
Are you safe?
Listen ...
One of us must make a sacrifice.
I will definitely be arrested, tortured and murdered.
It's a sacrifice for the people.
Well, Thomas.
Do not worry.
Forget what I just said.
It was a joke.
Alphonse ...
I've a parcel to get?
I'll be right back.
I smoke the American brand.
Damn rain!
Runs right past your neck.
You must leave the main road.
The checkpoint at Kasimba saw a convoy.
How far from here?
- 16 km.
Maybe less.
Thank you, comrade.
There is no boat.
We'll use the canoes.
And how is it on the other side?
We look for cars or continue on foot.
No Patrice, I'm not going first.
Quick!
- I risk nothing.
They're hot on our heels!
I'll wait for the boat.
We leave.
Who are they?
I cannot see.
I must go back.
- No!
That is pure madness!
It is your task to reach Stanleyville.
And let them take revenge on my family?
What will they say?
- That's suicide.
They are not numerous. They will listen.
You ungrateful creatures!
This is pure madness!
Chief, we wish you no harm.
But if we return without you, we are slain.
And now they will kill me.
You still have regrets.
I gave you the power of the Force Publique.
When I die, you are also dead.
He's right.
- I'm for Lumumba.
Stop this nonsense!
Excuse me, Chief, but we recommend ...
Where were you arrested?
What about your children?
What?
Cannibal.
Very well, gentlemen, it's time to vote.
The proponents raise your hands.
Mr. Carlucci,
Will you cast your vote?
The government of my country does not intervene in the affairs of a sovereign state.
We'll respect your decision.
This is the message:
"Ask permission from the jew in order to receive. "
You?
- They arrested everyone.
Where are you taking us?
Katanga, 17 January 1961
I hope they do not ...
Internal bleeding.
Probably showing a perforated stomach.
Broken ribs.
If they are not brought in for an operation, it's only a matter of hours.
I warned you.
To never set foot in my country.
Civilians, soldiers, on this memorable day, the anniversary of our independence, we greet you with joy and pride.
On behalf of the Government we show a minute's silence in memory of the man we cry out as our National Hero:
Patrice Emery Lumumba.
You can pray as you wish.
Nobody knew about that night in Katanga.
The children may not know, do you?
They wouldn't understand.
Just tell them that I came
50 years too soon.
Tell them what we wanted for our country, was not wanted by others.
Dearest Pauline, if you read this, I am dead.
Tell my children that Congo has a great future, that our dignity is there to recover.
Tell them that during the fight
I had no time to hesitate that the purpose for which we gave our lives would be overcome.
Go get him.
Thanks.
Weep not for me, my companion.
History will be the final judge.
That history will not be written in Brussels,
Paris or Washington.
It will be ours, the story of a new Africa.
And on that day ...
I won't talk to you.
You will also leave me.
Grandfather too is leaving.
When you grow wings, you too will fly away.
Emperor Chandragupta Maurya has embraced Jainism... for which he is abdicating, giving up his throne... his kingdom and his people.
Grandfather, Asoka has taken your sword. He says it is his.
You are leaving me, but the sword is mine.
Asoka, my son, this is not just a sword.
It's a demon.
When drawn, it hungers blood.
It doesn't see friend or foe.
It sees only blood. Just blood.
Before it can do more harm, let us get rid of it.
"This is not just a sword.
It's a demon.
It doesn't see friend or foe.
It sees only blood. Just blood."
The Takshila army is mightier than ours.
Half our army has not reached.
General Shivrath, hasn't reached... or my brother Susima has not let it reach?
We will not lose. For even if wars are fought on battlefields... they are won by the mind.
Takshila army, keep moving.
Prince, Takshila army is advancing.
Stop them, General, by force or by deceit.
Their army has been halved.
Now they want to surrender.
The enemy deserves a chance.
Don’t you agree, General?
Takshila's flags are down.
We want to surrender, Prince.
Our army has laid down their weapons.
Takshila kneels before Magadha.
Surrender to me.
The weapon is with me.
That is no weapon.
This is a weapon.
The head that won't bow to us will be cut off.
What are you taking with you?
Nothing.
All that and you say it's nothing?
Give us some of it.
Should I?
That's too much.
Want more?
- No, we'll share it.
You better smarten up.
Prince Asoka is arriving, victorious from Takshila.
The stars never lie.
- Damn your stars.
Susima's mother is King Bindusara's favored queen.
With her around no one will dare eye the throne.
And what of Asoka’s mother,
Queen Dharma?
She is less of a Queen and more of a slave.
Only Prince Susima can claim the throne.
Where is Susima?
General Shivrath.
The great General Shivrath.
It is you who suggested that
Asoka be sent to Takshila.
You said he would lose, didn’t you?
"Send him with half the army and he won’t return alive."
You said so, right?
Then what is this?
What do we do with you now?
You have failed.
What is the fate of a defeated soldier?
Let me be sentenced to death.
Defeat hasn't crushed the warrior's ego. He still holds his head high.
I want him to lower his head.
These arms and medals belong to Magadha's proud army.
Do you think you deserve all this?
No.
Take them off.
Strip him naked.
Here, brother.
The General is now ready for war.
He has lowered his head.
Now you can kill him.
You don't know Asoka. I have tried to kill him all of eleven times.
Don't worry.
Asoka will die for sure.
You know your job well.
I advise you to attack him while he is bathing in the river... when he is most vulnerable... emerging out of the water, then...
All I want is to know who sent you.
Long live King Susima.
You missed. Again.
See, there isn't a scratch on me.
I want you to leave Magadha.
- Why should I?
The coming six moonless nights are not auspicious for you.
My good or bad luck rests with my sword.
Is that your wish? I run away?
I'm no coward.
I'm not afraid of anyone, Mother.
- But I'm afraid.
How can you know a mother's pain?
9 months I nurtured you in my womb.
I am your son, Mother.
I will understand your pain.
Even if I have to carry you around for nine months.
Let me know your pain, Mother.
You are right, Mother.
Nine moments maybe... but for nine months, you're too heavy.
Don't change the subject, will you leave or not?
I heard you. I promise, Mother.
Asoka.
- I promise, Mother.
I promise, pundit-ji.
How are you?
We've not met since your return.
I heard that someone tried to kill you.
Someone did try to kill me, yet again.
Who would want that, Asoka?
A fool that misses each time.
Beware, Asoka.
One shouldn't underestimate the enemy.
He who faces me with a sword
Not someone who lunges from behind.
Either way, the one who survives ascends the throne.
No, Susima.
The throne belongs to the one... who has the courage to sit on it.
That's a childhood trait of yours.
What I want, what I like... is your desire too.
You even took Grandfather's sword.
Get off the throne, Asoka.
Make me do so, Sugatra.
Not like this, Sugatra.
If you must have the throne then fight for it.
In front of everyone.
Meet me tomorrow morning and I'll fight you, before everyone.
Tomorrow morning... in front of everyone.
Sleep well, Asoka.
Tonight is your last night.
You are finished.
I will fight him.
Go ahead... fight him.
He dared to sit on the throne today.
Tomorrow, he may raise the sword on me.
Your Majesty, it is my belief that we analyze the situation...
Prime Minister, my belief is that you stay silent.
It's you who has encouraged him.
- Why blame the Prime Minister?
Asoka is under Dharma's control.
Stop him, Dharma.
If something should happen tomorrow... the blame will be entirely yours.
What's happening here?
Mother is taking a vow of silence.
- That will not happen here.
Everyone, leave.
What childishness is this?
A vow of silence, for life?
You won't talk to me ever again.
Why, Mother?
She won't speak to anyone.
Mother says why speak when her own child turns a deaf ear?
Mother wants you to leave Magadha and strive to live an ordinary life...
Give her your word that no one will come to know you’re Prince Asoka.
I must go? Leave?
So that others can laugh at me for running away scared?
You don't want your son to sit on the throne? But I wanted it for you.
Here. I give in. Now speak to me.
Vitasoka, tell Mother to greet an ordinary man.
Mother's like you, brother.
She won't speak till you leave.
All right, I'll go.
Even if you ask, I won't return.
Speak to me.
Brother won’t be here.
He has gone, leaving Magadha.
Gone? So he's scared.
The brave Prince has fled to save his life.
Idiot. Change your tune.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Friends like us have nothing to hide.
Last night, when I went home, my wife was not there.
Where did she go?
When I asked her in the morning... she said she was with her friend, Kamini.
Silly. She must have been with Kamini.
You idiot, I was with Kamini.
No, I was with Kamini.
I was there too.
You must have gone after me.
Strange. My wife’s name is also Kamini.
That dark one?
- Yes.
Have you heard? Prince Asoka has gone leaving Magadha.
He must have gotten scared of Prince Susima.
When Jupiter enters its twelfth position... every great man must go into exile.
- Really?
Like Rama, Pandavas, Princes.
Strange.
You're not from here. Who are you?
An ordinary traveler.
The sun remains the sun even behind clouds.
Your destiny indicates that you are in no way ordinary.
What lies in my destiny then?
That I am a prince?
One day I will be enthroned?
Be an emperor?
Even emperors are ordinary.
Your destiny transcends the throne.
Whose destiny can surpass that of an emperor's?
A traveler's... when his journey has been completed.
Eat, child. In Kalinga no one goes to sleep hungry. You eat too.
Here, Pawan. It's good food.
Pawan, eat this. It's tasty.
Why should you eat? You too miss Mother's hand feeding you.
No fuss. I'm an ordinary man.
You an ordinary horse.
No royal palace or sumptuous dishes for us.
Now, it's the ground to sleep on... the open sky above... and pretty princesses who now exist only in our dreams.
Go, you searching wind, go away
Go seek out my beloved
One good enough for me
It cannot be...
If there is...
Then maybe we can be together
Go... go...
The sky is a poet's page
And I its poem
Someone like me...
Is rare in this world
Touch me not...
That's a dare...
It would start raging fire
Go... go...
I didn't see a thing.
I was just listening.
You swim...
I mean you sing very well.
What's your name?
I don't talk to strangers.
- Stranger?
Do you not feel that we have met before?
In some other place, in another time... somewhere?
Who are you?
Pawan (the Wind). And you?
Why are you following me?
Your voice drew me.
I am warrior blood. You risk death.
I am dead.
My warrior.
Pawan, this place is unfit for a horse like you. Wait here.
Look, another one in search of the same thing.
You won't find...
Nobody will.
Who?
- Not who, 'What'.
100 shining, clinking gold coins.
Reward for finding Prince Arya and Princess Kaurwaki.
You’re very pretty.
And you're the prettiest, Meghna.
Meghna? My name's Urvashi.
- Doesn't matter, you're all pretty.
Who is there? Will someone dare to take up my challenge?
Friend, you seem new here.
How about you?
Come, show us your mettle.
Go... go.
Brave youngsters these days parade around with twigs.
Give it back.
- Sit. Win it back.
What's your name?
- Pawan (the Wind).
A horse's name.
His father must be 'Badal' (cloud).
Look behind...
There's no one.
You won by cheating.
- Either way, I won.
You must fight me again.
- Let go.
I will not.
No way out.
You'll have to fight.
Where were you last night?
I've been waiting for ages.
Who are all these people?
Come home now, I'll show you.
You are the first to defeat Virat.
Come with me.
You've not been drinking, have you?
- No.
You take over the bullock cart.
It's dangerous to drink and ride.
He's right, let's go.
Woke up, finally? Will you just sit around? Or will you work?
What work?
- You must work if you want to stay.
If not, you should leave.
I can do any kind of work.
This work I cannot do.
Greetings. I'm new to this.
You could face some discomfort.
Even so, please don't move.
And please don't kick.
Your eyes too are beautiful.
You? Why are you following me?
I am following you?
Yesterday I was in the forest and you emerged from the waterfalls.
Now you're here on the pretext of getting milk.
And what were you doing in my dream last night?
At least tell me your name.
Give me the milk.
- Look, over there.
Hey, Warrior.
Stop. Princess Kaurwaki.
Yes, we found her.
The 100 gold coins are ours.
100 gold coins for her?
Back off. She is ours.
- Know how to swim?
Yes, of course.
And you?
That's good.
Lets go.
You crazy? If you can't swim then why jump into the water?
What's wrong? Seems all of Kalinga is after you...
Princess Kaurwaki.
You're among them. For you, all I mean is 100 gold coins.
I couldn't put a price on you.
The earth doesn't have enough gold for that.
Stay with Arya. He is alone.
Stop. Who sent you?
Drink up.
When I'm king, there will be food for all.
Don't tell anyone.
Who is this? Is he dead?
- It's just an injury. Go back inside.
How did he get hurt?
- Bheema hit him. Go inside.
Did he come to kill me?
Arya, go inside.
Why did you bring him here?
You know it's dangerous.
Why did you hit him?
- Arya, go inside.
First tell me, why you hit him.
- Arya, go inside.
Why did you bring him here?
He could be anyone, a murderer, an assassin...
He saved my life, Bheema.
- Don’t you know why?
He's after the same thing:
100 gold coins.
You may take your life lightly but Arya is my responsibility.
Arya is my brother, General.
- Let's go then.
I can't leave him in this condition.
- You'll have to.
We are leaving from here.
- General, are you ordering me?
No. I'm just trying to make you understand.
The rest is up to you.
Forgive me, Prince.
Please have your meal now.
Here, I'm Prince?
Inside you scold me?
Scold me then after eating.
- I don't wish to eat.
I want to go home
- Yes, Prince. We leave tomorrow.
Not tomorrow, today.
- I said tomorrow.
It's always tomorrow.
When I am king everything will be settled today.
No tomorrows.
Kaurwaki...
Kaurwaki, give it to me.
Mother, look at Kaurwaki.
Mother.
It's all right.
It was only a nightmare.
I want to go home.
- Yes. We will go.
Where is Prince Arya?
I assure the senate that
Prince Arya will soon be with us... to take the royal place of his late father.
I have announced a 100 gold coin reward to anyone who finds him.
It's not just a matter of finding Prince Arya.
The King's assassins roam free.
What's happening in Kalinga?
Answer me.
There is a conspiracy brewing in Kalinga.
The person involved is here in this senate amongst us.
Who is he?
- You.
Or you. It may even be you.
- Me?
It could be anyone.
Suspecting each other is futile.
It's your responsibility to find the culprit, Prime Minister.
We trust you.
Kaurwaki...
Kaurwaki...
Now Kaurwaki? Last night another name was on your lips.
Is that so?
And what were you doing so close to me last night?
Don't go. It still hurts...
If you leave, the pain will get worse.
My Warrior, listen.
- I don't want to hear.
But I want to say it.
- Fine. Say it.
Can I come close and say it?
- What are you doing?
Nothing?
- I saw him trying to tell you something.
He was telling me a story.
- I want to hear it too.
But I don't know any stories.
- I order you. Tell me a story.
Prince, don't get angry.
I will tell you a story.
Once, there was a prince.
- Like me?
A little older. He left his kingdom and roamed the jungle.
Like us? Then what?
- One day he heard something...
Someone was singing.
The voice drew him to a waterfall.
He saw a princess, bathing...
Her lovely body, head to toe, glistening with water drops.
And the prince fell in love.
At first sight.
- I knew it. Then?
Said the prince to the princess,
"You sing beautifully! '
The princess got angry, picked up her sword.
Why? The prince didn't do anything.
He watched her bathe, you see.
- So? I too bathe in the open.
You're different.
The Princess had no clothes on her.
Arya, supper's ready. Come eat.
- But I want to hear the story.
First eat. Then the story.
How are you now?
- I 'm fine.
I must find the rascal who hit me from behind.
This rascal. He hits everybody.
We should leave now.
- By the way, where are you headed?
Kalinga.
That's where I am going too.
We won't trouble you. Let's go.
Tell me the story.
Rascal.
What is this?
Left your work without warning?
Work when you please. Leave when you please. This won't do.
She went away.
She didn't even look back.
Is it done?
Come, get ready.
Come, get ready.
Let's catch the evening boat.
Let's get on it. Come, let's go.
There will be an anchor, somewhere...
Somewhere there 's a shore...
Let's go. Let's go.
Prepare yourself, then let's leave
Whether we swim or we sink...
We have to get across
The evening will be so pleasant
The words will be mine.
But the thought yours
The talk will be innocent... sweet, diluted with honey
What is this surge of love?
Do I drown to experience it?
Can 't you tell what it is?
Where could it lead?
The heart will burn, the eyes will fill
You fight very well.
Here, straighten this.
I ' II be leaving too.
- Wait.
The fight is not over.
- I warn you.
I have learnt the art of battle from the great texts.
I know 18 tactics of fighting.
I do too.
All 18?
- All 18 of them. Come, fight.
Tell me, friend.
Do you know the 19th tactic?
Which is this 19th tactic?
The 19th tactic?
In the 19th tactic the warrior fights his foe blindfolded.
Like this.
Pawan, Pawan.
Quiet, everyone.
What's new in that?
Even I know this tactic.
Prepare yourself.
Have you got the blindfold on?
- Yes.
You can't see anything?
- Not a thing.
You hit first.
Try again.
Keep at it.
Friend, remember... the '19th' tactic.
Quiet.
Will he be back?
Who, Pawan?
Yes, Pawan. I want to hear the story.
Here you go, prince. Eat some fruit.
Bheema, know any stories?
No.
No for everything.
Tell us, who are you?
What are you doing here?
Princess, hide.
Were you looking for me?
When you left you did not look back even once.
Take care of Arya.
Don't leave them, Bheema.
He will kill everyone.
Well, what's this?
The sun pendant.
It is our Prince Arya, isn't it?
Look, our Prince got scared.
Don't be afraid, Prince.
We won't do anything to hurt you.
You fight well.
Where did you learn?
I'm a soldier in the Magadha army.
You, soldier of Magadha army?
And I'm the General of Kalinga.
That makes us enemies.
Enemies.
How long?
How much longer will it take?
Do I have to wait for eternity to ascend the throne?
Find Prince Arya and kill him.
As proof, hand me the sun pendant he wears around his neck.
Go.
Why a sword in such beautiful hands?
I want to be as skilled as you in wielding the sword.
To fight the evil ones.
- Who are they?
The ones who killed my parents.
I'm with you, Kaurwaki.
I will always be close to you.
I don't want to depend on others.
Then, hold the sword like this.
Let it be a part of your body.
Let it connect to your soul.
No fear, no hesitation...
No sense of life or death.
Focus only on your target.
Not like this.
Eye to eye...
Never shift your eyes from your enemy.
I just touched my warrior and she took offense.
Just imagine, she pushed me.
You men. You could not have said or heard anything.
Probably grabbed the girl's hand.
- I did. So?
You need to be gentle with girls.
Some love, some flowers... say some words of love.
Say what? Love speaks for itself.
Are you afraid of expressing love?
- I 'm not afraid of anything.
Nonsense. Tell me, how does one go about this love talk?
Here. Hold these flowers. Take it all.
Go tell her...
I love you... you alone.
I can't think of anything but you.
After meeting you my world has changed.
I have changed.
I can't understand anything.
If I keep silent, I'll go mad.
All that? I can't do it.
Hold this? You have to say it.
I'm In love with you
- Right.
Only you.
- Perfect.
Keep at it and
I'll get some more flowers.
Ever since I have met you, everything's changed.
I have changed, you seem changed.
I can't think of anything or anyone else but you...
You.
Your love story brings tears to my eyes.
Now your tears will flow.
My friend, not today.
Somebody is waiting.
They'll have to wait a lifetime.
Virat, my friend...
- Nothing will work today.
No blindfold, no 19th tactic.
Today nothing will work.
What if I say there's someone behind you?
I won't look back.
There's someone behind you.
- I know there's no one.
Virat, somebody is there.
You're cheating again.
Telling me lies?
I'm leaving, my friend.
So? You promised you'll be with me forever.
After that day, I see you today.
I won't speak to him ever, didn't even tell me before he left.
Are you crying?
First, you fight with Pawan.
Then you sit here and cry?
Why should I cry?
What have I to do with him?
- Look, Pawan's horse.
You glass doll...
Sealed in your lips is the lilt of love
But you won't speak
Or utter it
It lingers on your eyelashes
And lurks on lowered eyes
Come, listen.
Sweeter than sugar are your veiled eyelids
You don 't open your eyes or reveal what they say
If you wish to cross the hills
I'll move mountains for you
If you seek shelter in the clouds
I'll ward off the monsoon rains
A bird in the sky will guide you to the hill where the sun rises
Please introduce yourself, beautiful
Your smile is sweetness
You are a foreigner, will forget me easily. Give me your promise
So I can wear it like a jewel
The prime minister of Magadha has sent a message.
Please continue with the story.
The story... where were we?
The Princess's clothes...
She wore them, walked away, and the prince followed her
Why?
Lovely princess, alone in a dark forest...
What of wild animals?
Any wild animal seeing a lovely princess would follow.
Then what happened?
The princess turned around and said, "I am a princess... lf you follow me you will get a tight slap".
The prince left then?
No, he was shameless.
Is this your story or mine?
You tell it then.
No, you tell it.
Why would our prince who braved death bother over a slap?
He kept following the princess.
Suddenly, three monsters appeared.
Where was the prince from?
The prince had no kingdom.
It was stolen from him.
Just like us.
Someone stole our land as well.
Someone stole our Kalinga.
So what?
The sun is yours, the moon too.
All the stars up there are yours.
No one can take that away from you.
Really?
- Yes.
What's more, no man can take your land away from you.
I'm there with you.
I'll get your land back for you.
Hey, warrior.
I... listen to me.
I have not told anyone this before.
Kaurwaki... listen.
Please listen.
Tell me.
Kaurwaki, I love you, only you.
I can't think of anything or anyone but you.
Ever since I have met you everything has changed.
I have changed.
I don't know what to do.
If I didn't tell you,
I would lose my mind.
I love you, only you.
I can't think of anything or anyone else but you.
Ever since I have met you everything has changed.
I have changed.
I'm glad you told me.
If you didn't,
I would lose my mind.
That's exactly what I said.
But you should say it like this.
Where were you?
With Pawan.
What were you doing?
Is this the way to behave?
That too with an ordinary soldier?
Bheema, don't forget who it is you are talking to.
That's why I am speaking out.
It is not right for you to associate with Pawan.
Careful, Bheema. I love Pawan.
You love Pawan?
Who is Pawan?
Where does he come from?
He says four nice words to you and you think it's love?
How do you see it?
You think I don't know what love is?
You don't.
You don't know the difference between love and a commoner's lust.
Don't forget that you are just a General... and I'm a princess.
You are my servant.
A slave to my royal family.
Yes, I'm a servant.
But who are you?
You think you are a princess?
The family you are so proud of...
What did you say?
What about my family?
Tell me, Bheema.
You were found by a fisherman.
Your origin is unknown.
No one knows your lineage...
The king adopted you.
Who am I then?
Nobody knows.
My warrior, why are you here alone?
I know what you are thinking.
Me, a princess. He, a mere soldier.
Arriving with his heart, horse and sword.
Warrior. What happened?
What's wrong?
I am no warrior, Pawan.
Those who I thought were my parents...
I am not of their blood.
They found me, Pawan.
They raised me as an orphan.
I have no identity, Pawan.
What difference is there... between the blood of a warrior and that of an ordinary man?
Nothing's changed. I love you.
Who do you love? Who am I?
You are my warrior, my princess.
Come with me.
Look. Look at the flame.
Are you going to push me away again?
Not so quick.
Tell me, what's my wedding gift?
I've given you my heart. What more?
Your horse.
He's yours.
Your sword.
- That too.
Your clothes.
Not in front of the horse.
What are you doing?
My Warrior... no... no...
I'll be right back.
Stand upright, don't bow.
Greetings, Prince Asoka.
Embrace me.
Why are you here?
Your mother wants to meet you.
Tell Mother I will not return.
She is very ill.
You may go.
What's the matter?
Mother's unwell.
You should go to her then.
What about you and Arya?
We'll be fine.
We'll stay here till you get back.
Please go.
You're leaving again?
I won't let you go.
Prince Arya, a matter of two days.
I'll return soon.
You did not even finish the story.
- Where were we?
Yes... the three monsters died.
The prince killed them all.
The Princess's anger turned to love.
The prince asked for her hand in marriage.
She said yes, right?
Instantly.
Then?
Then the prince left.
Where to?
To his mother who was ill.
This is a sad story.
No way. The prince will return with hundreds of horses and elephants...
...to take his princess away.
Tell the prince to return soon.
His princess will be waiting.
The prince will come back with hundreds of horses and elephants.
You take care of Kaurwaki.
Greetings, Prince.
Where is Mother?
- Come inside.
You lie to me and then want
God's forgiveness?
Had I not lied how would I see my son?
Seen me? Now I must leave.
Someone is waiting for me.
Who?
Someone.
As lovely as a lotus, a heavenly creature.
She is so beautiful.
Anyone who sees her...
Will become a poet?
No... a lover.
You forget the white hair.
White hair?
She is someone else but you'll always be my first love.
Mere words. Who is she?
Kaurwaki.
- Kaurwaki? What of her family?
All here. You, Vitasoka, me.
We are her family.
Mother, I have married her.
- Married?
Why didn’t you bring her?
- Not like this.
When I do, Magadha will welcome her ceremoniously.
The streets will be lit with lamps, decorated with flowers.
Then I will tell her who I am.
- You've not told her yet?
I told a lovely white-haired lady that I won't tell anyone.
Silly.
Take the blessings of the King.
Praise the lord.
General, the rumor all over Kalinga is that Prince Arya has been killed.
The senate has decided to place someone else on the throne.
I know that's why it's important that I go to Kalinga.
It's unsafe for Arya to go there now.
Princess, give me your anklet...
Arya, your necklace.
No one should know they are hiding here.
Don't worry, General.
I will guard them with my life.
He's served the royal family for years.
You'll be safe here.
Don't go anywhere until my return.
Yes... now I have to listen to the General's orders.
Greetings, Susima.
Greetings.
Where were you all these days?
Just wandering around.
Tomorrow morning, in front of everyone.
I was just scaring you.
I don't want to fight.
Susima, I don't want the throne or the crown.
I don't want anything.
Have you ever loved someone?
Love?
- No? You should.
Brother, he is trying to trick us again.
So, you've returned?
You remembered Magadha?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I wanted to...
A rebellion is threatened in Ujjaini.
Go there.
Any problem?
No, Your Majesty.
Are you missing Pawan?
- Yes.
He said that should I think of him
I should call his name out loud.
Then, he'll appear.
Should I call him?
You call out as well.
Prince...
I must go.
- His highness has ordered...
Don't worry. You go to Ujjaini.
I will meet you there.
Despite the talk,
I was sure you were all safe.
Who would want to kill Prince Arya?
At first I suspected you.
And I suspected you.
At times like this friends suspect one another.
Bring Prince Arya here at the earliest.
I cannot contain the senate any longer.
You are right.
Don't go alone, General.
I need no one.
- You do.
April the 10th, 1671.
Monsieur le Prince de Condé,
His Majesty gives me reason to believe that He would graciously accept an invitation to visit you at Chantilly.
The visit will last three days.
The king instructs me to say that he wants no fuss.
Merely the simple pleasures of life in the country.
In other words, if you value
His Majesty's favor, you will set no limit to the extravagance and ingenuity of the festivities.
I will present myself beforehand, to approve the arrangements.
Marquis de Lauzun, in the service of His Majesty
Louis XIV of France.
My dear Master Steward,
Monsieur Vatel.
Good new sand bad news.
His Majesty arrives on Thursday.
I can't emphasize enough the importance of his visit.
A dropped wine glass or an uncomfortable cushion would spell disaster to our entire province.
The good news is that we may go to war with Holland.
On that table.
- Good morning, Monsieur.
- Good morning.
The Princess has placed her apartments at the disposal of the Queen.
Naturally I should place mine at the disposal of His Majesty.
From the King anti-chamber we pass through the music room... and next to the apartments of the Queen.
Her Majesty's bedroom...
Drawing-room, and a further bedroom for Her Majesty's lady-in-waiting.
Lady-in-waiting,
Madame de Montausier.
Anne de Montausier.
Her Majesty will be comfortable and convenient.
The King won't be going to her bed, he did his duty two days ago.
Remarkably well informed.
The Queen always goes to confession the following morning.
- When was it?
- Monday.
- Monday?
- Remarkably well informed.
This room is to serve as the Council Chamber... and the King's bedroom...
A second bedroom so here.
And this of course... we've allocated to the
Duchesse de La Vallière.
Who, I believe, is close to His Majesty.
No.
This room is for the Marquise de Montespan.
Montespan?
It's hard to keep up when you live in the country.
And La Vallière?
Anywhere. Put her in the attic.
I prefer, Monsieur Le Prince, if my rooms were north-facing.
- I don't like the sun coming in.
- Your rooms, Lauzun?
I myself will have only one room for those 3 days. As will the Princess.
Every corner and cupboard is spoken for.
Even so to accommodate the court, we have to use every farm house... from miles around.
My room...
No. I won't have you disturbed, Vatel.
You haven't slept for a week as it is.
Have that cleaned.
The first day, the glory of the sun, the bounty of Nature.
Trees, birds, butterflies... fruits and flowers.
The second day, on the lake.
Fireworks.
The sun banishes the night.
The lamps are on their way from Paris now.
For Friday, the fish banquet will be presented in a sea of ice.
Neptune's tribute to Helios, the Sun God.
- The King will catch a cold.
- No, my Prince... the braziers will be lit one hour before the banquet.
Then the ice will melt.
I have forbidden it to melt, my Prince.
Well, our fate is in your hands.
There is always a reason behind a royal visit.
And the reason for this one is William of Orange... king of Holland, who wants war.
And if he gets it, Louis is going to meet the best general in France... that many people think is none other... than the Prince de Condé, even with gout.
Compared to this visit from the king... war with the Dutch will seem like a picnic.
- Thank you!
- How can I help you?
Excuse me, sir, but we'll only talk to the top. Nobody else.
I regret His Majesty is busy at this moment.
His host, the Prince of Condé, likewise.
Not them... The man in charge.
The master of pleasures and festivities. Vatel.
Vatel!
That's slightly more difficult!
I'll see what I can do.
Please, follow.
Good morning!
- How many geese?
- 60, Monsieur.
Monsieur Vatel...
- You're trespassing here, Mr. Alcalet.
- All of us are owed money.
We've come to tell you.
From this moment, nothing on credit.
Not a single cabbage leaf or cracked coffee cup or table napkin. Nothing.
- Until our bills are paid.
- Exactly!
We mean to get paid.
Come.
We have businesses to run and families to provide for.
When we will get what we are owed?
What you are owed now is the truth.
As things stand, we cannot honor our debts.
Not for the months or the years gone by.
Much less for this festivities.
We cannot pay you a single "sou" nor will we ever.
You have only one chance of getting your money.
By giving me everything
I asked for. Instantly.
And of the very best quality.
And then more of the same.
This visit is a reconciliation.
If the King is pleased by the festivities... then the royal coffers will open.
The Prince is bankrupt.
It's up to you.
If we do give you more credit, how do we know we'll get our money back?
The Prince said so.
My master is a man of honor.
On that I stake my life.
You will be paid.
Good.
Excellent.
Good morning...
Monsieur Vatel.
Are you going down, Madame?
I'm going up.
Where is Montausier?
Explain to her the Queen does not wait on the lady-in-waiting.
Forgive me, Madame.
Please. Let me.
Allow me.
I hope your birds will be happy with us.
Madame!
Here we are.
Put him with the fruits.
Monsieur, the King's brother wants him for his page.
He chose me!
Get him dressed and put him to work.
And... what would you have me tell
His Highness, the King's brother?
Tell him I don't get my boys from his boudoir... and he won't get his from my kitchen.
Yes... indeed I will.
I need another two of this.
The same size, if possible.
It's not very wise upsetting the King's brother, you know.
It could make things go badly for us, if he chooses.
I'm a steward, not a pimp, Gourville.
Monsieur Vatel!
The Princess has been bitten by a monkey!
Master Steward, you filled my garden with savage beasts!
I've been badly bitten.
Where were you?
Busy, Your Highness.
We had some unwelcome visitors.
- Beggars?
- No, no. Creditors!
Creditors?
Dr. Bourdelot!
I've been badly bitten... on the arm.
Oh, no!
- What's your name?
- François Vatel, Madame.
Monsieur Vatel.
You were at Vaux-le-Vicomte ten years ago.
Yes, Madame.
I was steward to Nicolas Fouquet.
His Majesty's Minister of Finance.
You mean, His Majesty's prisoner for life in the fortress of Pignerol.
- That is so?
- Six thousand guests... to meet the King.
Diamonds and saddle horses given away as prizes in childish games.
That was overdoing it, don't you think?
It showed how much
Fouquet had been stealing.
Gourville, why has the King really come here?
It's revenge.
The King will never forget that Condé fought against him in the civil war.
That was a long time ago.
The King was a child.
If there's a war with the Dutch... the King will need Condé.
- Yes, but he is...
- Sick of war?
So he is. But he is equally sick of being in debt.
I'm passing red hot stones.
Condé!
Majesty?
What exactly do you need to borrow so much money for?
The better to serve France,
Your Majesty.
Well, Colbert, where are our envoys from Holland?
- Aren't they here yet?
- Not yet, Your Majesty.
Peace with the Dutch is good for nothing.
Except tulips.
How many tulips do we have at Versailles?
- Two million, Sir.
- My gardener hates flowers!
He would love a war with the Dutch.
Indeed, sir.
But would Your Majesty please recall that you have offered your daughter in marriage to William of Orange.
An invasion would not look well in the eve of a betrothal.
My daughter can't even talk yet, Colbert.
4 days ride from Paris, we have a country of republicans, protestants... and printers of seditious pamphlets.
No King is safe from free-thinkers... especially if they are as rich as the Dutch.
We have no better soldier than Condé.
And if there is war, we'll need him.
He's expensive.
But if there is peace...
What do I say in the meantime?
Why say anything?
Your Majesty was invited here to enjoy yourself.
Not for business...
Your Highness?
Are the musicians ready?
Yes, my Prince. The King didn't utter one single word to me during Council.
- Kept muttering to Lauzun.
- Which one is the King?
You killed my only son.
You bastard!
He died working in the machines at Versailles.
So the King could have fountains!
- Put you hands off me!
- Have you no control over your people?
His Majesty wants her flogged, and at once.
See to it, Master Steward.
I'm not your master of flogging mad women.
A hundred lashes.
You know what's at stake.
Don't weaken!
Murderer! Assassin!
My son! My son!
Monsieur Vatel!
I'm short of a page at my household at Saint Cloud.
You have a boy who might do, apparently.
Send him to my apartment and I'll have a look at him.
Come, Lauzun, we have been promised music.
Music is my weakness.
The mad woman has been flogged,
Your Majesty.
I ask your pardon.
Mad woman?
Don't concern yourself, Prince.
I recall no mad woman.
There's no sign of them.
- How long are they going to be?
- You can't hurry a King.
Well, you can't slow down a sunset.
- Madame...
- Monsieur Le Marquis?
The King sends you his compliments.
And he begs the favor of taking a cup of chocolate with you... in your room, at midnight.
With me?
May I offer you my congratulations?
Although, as you can imagine... this came as a great blow to me.
After tonight I cannot hope for deliverance... from the pain of my own desires. So...
May I suggest... my rooms at ten?
Alas, Monsieur... ten o'clock I have an even more attractive offer.
Her Majesty has asked me to delouse her Spaniel.
Madame.
Monsieur Vatel.
He is coming! Thank God!
Go, go!
Table one!
With your King, eat, drink... and enjoy yourselves!
Your hat!
Go, go, go!
The Prince's gout is bad.
Tell Dr. Bourdelot.
Madame de Courbé needs a new napkin. Come on.
The Marquis d'Effiat wants his dishes without coriander.
Isn't it to your taste, Your Majesty?
Change Montespan for Montausier.
You look pale, Prince.
Are you ill?
Your Majesty is gracious to inquire.
Yes, indeed.
I see we share the same taste.
Taste?
In women.
There is a lady who has been rejecting my advances... in a way which
I find quite stimulating.
Her world is about to change.
The King has asked for her tonight.
I suggest we mark the event.
I want you to make a masterpiece.
Spun sugar, almond paste, fruit and flowers.
- I'll leave it to you.
- I'm not a pâtissier, Marquis.
You were apprentice to Eberhardt's on the Ile Saint Louis.
I'll be too busy.
Ask someone else, Marquis.
Fruit and flowers in the color of flesh and blood.
Flesh and blood.
I'll send my valet in the morning.
Young Sire,
I ask you to behave yourself.
- Don't you know who I am?
- I do not have the honor.
I am the Vicomte d'Amboise... and when I grow up
I'll be the Duc de La Tremoille.
In that case it's not too soon to learn to behave like the Duc de La Tremoille.
In truth, the Duc de La Tremoille behaves like a pig.
I thank you, Madame.
The poorest of poor of Chantilly picked those flowers... just for a few sous... to make the trees pretty for His Majesty.
And those sous were on credit.
But the poor are happy to be the King's creditors.
- It's an honor they never dreamed of.
- Of course.
Both my parents were so honored, they died of it.
The Prince's birds.
Oh, God! I can't believe this!
Where are my birds?
It was the order of the Vicomte to let them go!
The Vicomte? What Vicomte?
The Vicomte d'Amboise, Doctor, and his sister. They ordered me.
But they are children!
They are little children!
- But he is still a Vicomte, doctor!
- These were the birds of the Prince.
What am I going to do?
I mean, it is a disaster.
I specifically ordered those thrushes and larks for the Prince's gout!
His gout is giving him agony today.
What am I going to do?
Use something else.
Use something else?
Use something else...
The heart torn from the living bird... is the only treatment for gout.
Everyone knows that.
- Why not chickens?
- Chickens!
He's a Prince! Chicken hearts wouldn't even cure a peasant.
Monsieur Vatel!
Are you trying to ruin me?
- Your Highness?
- First that mad woman.
Now the Marquis de Lauzun tells me you've been insolent.
- Insolent?
- You refused to be of service to him.
I refused to be his pâtissier.
What is the matter with you?
Lauzun has the King's ear.
For the next few days do what he asks.
Bravo, Prince!
Bravo!
Gourville, have they put you to spy on me?
If they had, you'd be in the Bastille by now.
You despise them, don't you?
They don't leave me much alternative.
Tell me, Gourville, who is Anne de Montausier?
- Why?
- How many times have I bitten my tongue? And now I snap at the only one who is human to me.
Well, she is new at Court.
She still got a heart... or so they say.
Good.
Yes, but it better be perfect.
Colbert is not in our camp.
He is hostile to our Prince getting influence at court.
Good night, my Queen.
Your Majesty...
Madame de Montausier.
I'm concerned about the fish.
I have sent to Dieppe for an extra cartload... in case there are storms off Le Havre.
You are my general.
The battle plan is yours to decide.
- What else?
- Nothing. Unless it rains.
The carving stewards will have to sleep in the stable.
But they are Germans.
- The lanterns arrive in the morning.
- Very good. Well, I leave it to you.
Go to bed, my friend.
Vatel...
You did well.
Goodnight, Madame.
Can you tell me where Vatel is?
You sent for me, Monsieur Vatel?
Food for cattle.
Now we can feed cattle through the Winter... instead of having to slaughter them every year.
How many varieties of pear are there?
There are 500 different kinds of pear.
This is the best one.
Its name is?
- Bon chrétien d'hiver.
- And...
- It was known to the Romans.
- Good.
When I'm rich,
I'd like a garden like yours.
I hope so, Colin.
I hope so.
Bravo, Colin.
You made a good choice.
The King will be pleased.
Colin... don't leave the kitchen without my order. Colin?
They were badly packed... and the roads were bad.
Monsieur Vatel.
I am the valet of the Marquis de Lauzun.
- My commiserations.
- Thank you.
Good.
Now a real flower.
Give me the blue one.
Harmony and contrast.
All beauty comes from those two things.
You see, Colin? A few objects are beautiful or ugly in themselves.
To know that is the beginning of being an artist.
Here. Huh?
Now I'll show you a real masterpiece.
- For your mistress.
- Just a moment.
It's from the Marquis de Lauzun.
Send it back.
She doesn't want it.
Will you keep me with you when you are a Duchess?
Let's wait and see if I am to be a Duchess... or just a night's divertissement to keep
Madame de Montespan on her toes.
Or on her knees.
Louder!
- I am in love!
- With a fish?
Monsieur Le Marquis?
Monsieur Le Marquis?
- What?
- She refused it, Monsieur Le Marquis.
That's rather beautiful.
Send it to... the Duchess de Longueville.
With the note?
Of course.
There's far too much waste in this country.
Madame.
There still won't be enough meat.
Not with the extra guests.
Monsieur,
I'm worried about the meat.
We have scarcely enough.
Monsieur Vatel!
Monsieur, the King's brother, he is playing with the whale.
The monster must not get away!
Kill with my heart!
It is they your hand should strike.
Strike now!
Your men are so careless.
They've quite spoiled our pleasure.
My men had orders to... to wait for me.
The whale was intended for the King's pleasure.
The King! That's a shame.
We, Bourbons, are unpredictable when deprived of our... pleasure.
You are a stubborn man,
Master Steward. Admirable.
Horse racing!
Get that carcass out of the water.
For your mistress.
Must be from the King.
There is a note.
It's all right, Louise.
It's all right.
It's sugar.
Madame, you were kind to one who turned aside kindness.
Such gift as I have,
I employ for your forgiveness.
François Vatel.
Master Steward, do you promise us sport?
Yes, Princess, there will be sport.
- I smell blood.
- I promise you blood!
Montausier's stock is rising.
She spent the night in His Majesty's bed.
Does everybody know who sleeps with the King?
Every footman knows. Sometimes you can be quite ridiculous, my dear Vatel.
You find the day more exciting than the night, Madame?
You sent back my gift and my note.
You think the King intends to keep you?
Perhaps not, Lauzun.
But from the King's bed to yours is a long fall.
And I'm not contemplating it in this life.
François!
They are waiting for the sauces!
Pick this up.
Someone help him.
Go on.
Monsieur Vatel, the pie!
There's really not enough meat.
We are two tables short.
They gave us the wrong numbers.
Give me that!
- Bring me some mushrooms.
- Edouard! Mushrooms!
Condé has won 40000 pistols from the King.
Colbert must be furious.
By losing a little you might have won more.
By winning a little you might lose everything.
Is the Prince losing his Château?
Not if he plays his cards wrong.
Your Majesty.
Madame de Montausier.
Condé's demands are excessive.
- Outrageous!
- You mean, he knows his price.
Of course, if there were to be a war...
As yet there is no war.
My envoys from Holland... may well bring terms we can accept.
I would prefer that.
It is not rational for two rich countries to make war.
My dear Colbert, our destinies are not ruled by reason.
Lust for power, like any lust, is seated at least according to... the latest medical knowledge, in the liver.
Although, personally... it hasn't been my experience.
Madame?
Madame!
Madame, please.
Are you ill, Madame?
I just needed to escape from them for a moment.
If you make an infusion of this, it will restore you.
I wanted the wind to stop blowing.
I made it stop.
Oh, I thought it was God.
Then perhaps God provided me.
Is it so important?
It is no small thing to please a King, Madame.
To please a King is easily done... and of no importance.
But as a steward
I have it in my power to... to save the house of the Prince of Condé.
What power do you have?
To create.
To astonish.
The visit of His Majesty is the supreme test.
If I please him, his benevolence will restore my master to his position... in the destiny of France.
So the destiny of France is in your hands, Monsieur.
That will be a great surprise to the King's minister Colbert.
I must go back.
Laurent!
What kind of meat is this?
Unicorn. Laurent!
Hurry up!
For God's sake!
There's no news about the lanterns.
More than half the eggs are addle.
We can't make the custard.
Watch.
Come.
The sugar will come out like bitten egg whites.
- Don't forget the apricots.
- No, Monsieur.
Lanterns, lanterns...
Lanterns...
If they ask you what it is, tell them it's an old recipe from Chantilly.
Don't cut any more melons.
- Monsieur?
- Who is it?
- Monsieur Vatel.
- Don't be afraid. Come on.
My mistress... she asked me to stay until I've seen you read it.
This is so pretty!
What a strange idea.
A custom from India.
Your kindness to me shows a nobler heart than any at court, where they know only hunter and prey.
Use your powers to protect yourself.
Beware Lauzun. A.
Please, thank your mistress.
I stink from head to toe.
This is good. I don't know it.
It's made from walnuts.
What did you want?
Monsieur sent me, the King's brother.
It's not an easy embassy.
Your name is in everybody's lips, you know.
This banquet will be decisive.
Your geniuses...
Get to the point.
Monsieur wants you for his friend.
He admires, well... to speak quite frankly, everything about you.
So, what he wants from you is... everything.
- Do I hear you right?
- What do you hear?
That monsieur has sent you to ask me to join a long line... of stable boys and Princes whom he has honored so... intimately.
Yes, your hearing is very good.
Tell Monsieur... and I quote Descartes whom I once knew...
"There is no soul so weak that it cannot... acquire an absolute power over the passions."
Monsieur is not a Cartesian, as far as is known.
He only wants a few moments of your time.
Then I send him a message which reveals more of me... than he would ever see if I were to submit. Tell him... we both of us live with a terrible thing.
The desire for the absolute.
The sublime. The perfect.
That's why he flits from person to person... and that's why I give myself to no one.
And the Prince?
How long do you think it will take before this reaches the Prince?
Not long, if you hurry.
My dear Vatel.
We all go round together like a celestial machine.
The Sun King is at the center.
Condé is one of his planets and I am Condé's moon.
Do you think there's a place to stand when we are free?
Naturally I will speak to Condé.
Not to do so would be... self-important.
Bourdelot!
Why have you got
Madame de Montausier's birds?
I got them from
Madame de Montausier.
- I'm saving them for the banquet.
- For the banquet?
No. In case the Prince requires them for his gout.
But why?
The Princess has asked la Montausier to sacrifice her canaries.
She refused.
So, the Princess told Her Majesty... and she commanded la Montausier to give them to me. Her Majesty.
But canaries... are so small.
I don't think that their hearts will be enough to ease the Prince's pain.
See, all this rich food, it's very bad for his gout.
I can't serve him omelet to celebrate the visit of the King of France!
It's not your fault. I just wish
I had some better birds, that's all.
I have my parrots.
But surely, Vatel, you will not sacrifice...
If the Prince's pain gets too great to bear... send to me for my parrots.
Tell the Princess the canaries are too small.
Demaury!
Return those birds to
Madame de Montausier's room.
Condé is lucky. This banquet would shame a Roman emperor.
Who is this Vatel?
Where does he come from?
Nowhere. The slums of Paris.
He was apprentice to Eberhardt's,
I believe.
Eberhardt's? On the Ile Saint-Louis?
My mother swore by Eberhardt's.
So did your father, I believe. Although
I don't think he went there for the pastries.
Ah, Vatel! I was just telling the Duchess here... about your boyhood days in the brothels of Ile Saint Louis.
It's quite true.
No one knows more about the brothels of the Ile Saint Louis... than the Marquis de Lauzun.
I think he's just insulted you, but it's hard to tell.
That's a rare gift.
If you punish him for it...
I'll tell everyone your favorite perversion.
Fetch Bourdelot.
From India?
How beautiful! Ingenious!
I have learned something today.
Which is rare.
- You sent for me, Vatel?
- I need something.
- Are you in pain?
- No.
I'm in the grip of some anxiety.
Anxiety? I've got nothing for anxiety. I'm a doctor!
Vatel!
Go!
Vatel!
And now for you! One, and two, and three.
And more, and more, and more, and more!
I am the steward of the fish.
They tell me these carp are called Love-Carp.
Gourville gave me your message.
You understand me like none of my friends understand me.
I hope you find your perfection.
I know I'm looking in the wrong place.
But when I despair...
I shall remember there was a man who looked into my soul.
Sport! I demand!
There shall be a race!
- Between Effiat...
- Yes!
- ...and Carl.
- In!
Effiat, now!
Mister Vatel, the horses are ready.
Come on.
What a wonderful spectacle!
Condé, who is responsible for these marvels?
My steward, Your Majesty.
And what is his name?
François Vatel.
Bring me this Vatel.
I would like to congratulate him.
16000 pounds of flares and rockets... gone up in smoke to kill a groom.
Sir, the King wishes to speak to you.
Not now, please.
Does he think all this happens by itself?
I want everything cleaned up by dawn.
Understand?
- Is it Friday already?
- Yes, nearly.
I must send Demaury to look out for the fish. The roads are bad.
- Demaury, Jean is dead.
- I know.
- You must tell his family.
- I sent a messenger to tell them.
Monsieur, the Queen is asking for crystallized fruit.
Well, get some!
Lauzun!
Withered away, Lauzun?
The King has called for Vatel.
He's refused to come.
Claims he is too busy. Monsieur.
Lauzun?
I'll pass his message onto the King.
Monsieur.
Halt!
- What is your business?
- King's business.
Envoys from Holland.
Let me go! Let me pass!
The black Queen loses, Colbert.
Now, let me try to help.
Your Majesty, my hand needs all the help it can get.
If Colbert loses, he won't be able to pay our workmen at Versailles.
- Monsieur, are you all right?
- How many workmen do we have, Colbert?
30 thousand, Your Majesty.
Well, Monsieur, don't deal him the black Queen.
How many orange trees do we have, Colbert?
- One thousand, Your Majesty.
- And one hundred in silver tops.
Versailles is my favorite mistress.
That's why she costs you so much.
What are you staking, Prince?
Ten louis.
Ten louis?
How many fountains do we have, Colbert?
One and a half thousand,
Your Majesty. Forfeit.
For Versailles, if I lose.
For something of yours, if I win.
A glove perhaps, mon frère.
But one glove is no good to anybody.
Now...
What?
Well, Prince?
I have nothing to add to the glory of Versailles, Your Majesty.
But that's not true.
You have something rarer than diamonds.
You have your Master of Pleasures.
Majesty?
Vatel is worthy of a larger stage.
And Versailles could use a man of his gifts.
You are asking me to stake my Master Steward on a card game?
Do you have any objections?
Look what you might win!
We take the bet.
Are we playing or not?
Very well.
Then we'll play.
Your Majesty, the envoys from Holland are arrived.
Then they come at an interesting moment.
This is true.
Well... it's between you two.
Prince.
Black Queen.
Bad luck.
The envoys.
If His Majesty comes out smiling, it will be peace with Holland.
No, if he returns smiling, it will be war.
War?
What do you think, Monsieur?
Certainly one or the other.
Also if he returns frowning.
Your Majesty...
Condé... what are your opinions of war?
I have seen too much of destruction, Majesty.
William of Orange has declined the offer... of the daughter of the Duchess de La Vallière.
Gallantly telling us that his family only marries... the legitimate daughters of kings.
- Not their bastards.
- I see.
Furthermore, the ruler of the flat earth has minted coins... with the image of the sun.
That is impertinent.
He has commissioned an oil painting of one of my flagships sinking.
With your permission...
I will drown him in one of his dikes, Majesty.
You do not have the command yet, Prince.
It is between you and Turenne.
- Turenne.
- Oh, I'm sure all will be all right.
After all, you have the King under your roof.
And Vatel to perform his miracles.
The King is pleased with you.
Generals have been chosen for worse reasons.
Tomorrow will be decisive.
No, no. Just leave me this one.
The Prince is grateful and would like to see you.
- Her Majesty?
- Asleep, Madame.
They were brought back.
Orders of Monsieur Vatel.
Would you like me to undress you, Madame?
No.
Fortune seems to be with us.
A war with Holland.
Turenne is scheming to get Colbert's backing.
The King favors me, I think.
He will make an announcement at the banquet tomorrow.
- Everything must be perfect.
- Everything will be perfect, my Prince.
We've always understood each other.
You are a great man, Vatel.
You will end up as a Vicomte.
- You have heard.
- Heard?
The King wants you at Versailles.
Versailles?
I'm a cook, not a courtier.
The King wishes to honor you.
Go.
I am sorry. I can't.
I cannot leave my people.
We have a present for you.
From the Marquis de Lauzun.
This will teach you to step above your station.
In the name of the King, let him go.
What do you want, Messieurs?
Preparation!
And plunge!
Excellent. Edouard... calf.
Louis. Back.
John! Wrist.
Bravo. Excellent.
And now... Open...
Tell Lauzun, enough!
His Highness, the King's brother, presents his compliments, Mr. Vatel.
He requests us to escort you to your apartments.
It won't be necessary.
Madame?
I wanted to thank you.
If the King knew you were here...
The King is busy with Madame de Montespan.
No one has seen me.
So you are coming to Versailles, Monsieur.
Or haven't you heard?
My Prince will never allow it.
One of my people was killed today.
Who was it?
His name was Jean-Marie Benoud.
28 years old, from the village of St. Crose.
His father is a miller there.
His mother died of a sweating sickness two years ago.
He had two brothers. One a priest.
He came here as a stable boy... he was senior groom for three years.
Three years.
- You knew him well.
- No. Not particularly.
He was one of my people.
He was fortunate in that.
Why did you save my birds, Monsieur?
Because they were too small to do any good, Madame.
And because... because... because they were yours.
Madame!
Madame!
- Anne!
- Madame, His Majesty!
Go.
He asked for me. He wants me.
It's the King! I'm a fool.
Yesterday you were a fool.
Stay here.
You think I can do that?
You have lived among the farmers too long.
Condé gave you away at the card table.
To please the King he gave you away like a hound from his kennels.
Madame?
The King has retired.
Alone.
- We searched high and low.
- I was...
I know where you were.
But I would never betray you.
Now I told the King that you were probably consoling a dear friend... le Duc de Longueville.
I mean, the way his wife puts herself about... Its disgraceful.
Don't you think?
You are a true friend.
Well, you'll need a friend now, won't you?
Would you do me the honor of sharing a cup of chocolate... with me... even at this late hour?
I think you'll find the King a less democratic man than myself.
And it would be tragic, would it not... if Vatel were to be sent back to his former master... a prisoner of Pignerole?
- My lord! Is there any news?
- News?
From the money.
The money from the King.
Money? Yes, for sure.
The news is very good.
The King is well pleased with us.
- God please. Where is Vatel?
- I'm looking for him myself.
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yes. Indeed.
- Is that all?
- Yes, sir.
Have you seen other fish carts on the road?
No, sir. There were storms all along the coast.
Few boats put to sea at all and they came back empty.
Empty!
- Come back tomorrow to be paid.
- Thank you, Monsieur Vatel.
My dear Prince.
Today's banquet will be my last.
But it will be magnificent.
The broth will be made from garlic and leeks.
Demaury, remember to blanch the green vegetables before you sauté them... or they'll collapse while waiting for the King.
The lobsters will be grilled.
They must be cut in half, when they are still alive.
Be sure the knife is big and sharp.
Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.
Monsieur? Monsieur Vatel, a lady dropped her fan.
Not now, Thibault. Not now.
Monsieur? Monsieur Vatel?
From His Majesty.
It's your commission for Versailles.
The King commands that you leave for the court tomorrow.
There will be a wagon for your personal baggage.
Do you have a horse?
He'll await your answer.
Monsieur? Are you there?
Bravo!
It's your turn.
Monsieur! Wonderful news!
The fish carts! They are arriving.
Poor little things.
Like prisoners.
Madame...
What is it?
Vatel...
This is for you.
I am sorry.
Madame, you were right.
I was not the master of these festivities... but their slave.
When you read this...
I shall have left this world with only one regret.
That I cannot be with you.
In the last three days
I have come to understand... that I treasure freedom above all.
Between Condé and Versailles the pass is narrow... and I have taken it.
May you find a better road.
Your home is, I think, in the south.
If so, remember that there is a place... not far away, in the Vaucluse... where they plant cherry trees among the vines.
The taste of the cherries... comes through in the wine.
The fish banquet was a tremendous success... even though the sauce lacked perhaps that touch of perfection.
But that was overlooked... in the excitement of declaring war on the Dutch... and of Condé receiving his command.
Of course no one dared to tell the King the truth.
And soon the word went round...
Vatel killed himself because of the fish.
Which flattered His Majesty... and pleased his courtiers.
Anne de Montausier left Chantilly quietly by a side gate... and never returned to court.

I found her this morning, grazing.

Oh, God. It's Ned.
[Mother]
Neddy!
[Girl] Mommy,
I named Hobson's kookaburra.
- What did you name him, darlin'?
- Beefy, 'cause he likes beef.
- Well, that's a fine name for a kookaburra, Grace.
- Who's the proud father, Ma?
Don't even ask. He's a long time gone.
That's all there is to it.
- The stinkin' Proddy.
- He was a Yank.
George the baker.
We were married, Ned, right and proper.
- Well, that's grand, Ma.
- [Both Laughing]
- [Dishes Clattering]
- Christ! Will you stop messin'?
I'm sick of the pair of ya.
Give your mother some respect, or I'll give ya a hidin', both of youse, ya hear me?
- And who are you, anyways?
- Steve Hart.
Well, seein' as how the two of you are so full of beans... you can both get off your asses and help me fix up this place.
- You haven't done a minute's work to help your ma, have you?
- [Ma] Come on, everyone.
- Sit down, now.
- What kind of stew is it?
Wombat. A wombat's a marsupial, and it lives in a hole.
[Ma] I know, darlin;
I put one in the stew.
- [Baby Fussing]
- Shh. Da-da-da. La-la-la.
Ned, would you like to say the grace?
All right.
Dear Lord, thank you for looking
after me mother...
me sister Grace, me sister Kate
and me brother Dan.
- Thank you, Lord, for our beautiful baby Ellen...
- Shh, shh, shh.
And for this wonderful stew made out of wombat.
- Amen.
- [All] Amen.
Amen.
[Ned Narrating] It's not easy for
an Irishman in Queen Victoria's colony...
to walk the straight
and narrow...
but I toed the line...
despite all temptations.
- With me fighting
with my fists for money.
- [All Cheering, Shouting]
And after all, I did three years
for that stolen horse.
Wild Wright only got 18 months.
You think I was gonna let that one slide?
[Onlookers Cheering]
- [Gasping]
- I declare Ned the winner!
- [Cheering]
- Bets are in.
[Shouting,
Chattering Continue]
So, are we square?
Course we are, you mad bugger.
Come here!
[Wild Wright]
Thank Christ for that!
[Ned Narrating] Could it be possible that
the Kellys were finally getting ahead?
That I could actually
better meself?
- [Horse Whinnies]
- [Woman] Steady.
Excuse me.
You there.
- Would you mind coming and holding my horse's thing?
- All right.
Steady.
- Now, what thing are you talkin' about, ma'am?
- [Sighs]
Are you gonna help me or not?
I've been riding him pretty hard the last two days.
Poor thing's been holding on since Saturday.
His bladder's paralyzed with the colic.
- Good God.
- Have you got that?
- Right there. Good. Good.
- Just hold it there.
[Chuckling]
Keep still.
- I'm glad that's not me. Christ.
- [Horse Nickering]
- Steady.
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.
Okay. All right.
Watch your boots, boys! Whoo!
- It looks like you've done this kind of thing before.
- Only on horses.
Thank God for that.
My name's Ned Kelly.
Pleased to meet ya.
- Hello, Ned.
- Right.
- [Horse Whinnying]
- [Man Shouting]
[Grunts]
- [Horse Whinnies]
- [Man] Watch out, lads! Here
he goes again! Clear the way!
[Whinnies]
The horse is too wild.
It can't be broken.
A waste of damn money.
Fetch my rifle, please.
What? You can't just shoot a horse 'cause it's wild.
- [Man] What else can we do?
We can't keep it here.
- Why don't you set it free?
I could break that horse for you if you like.
I've broken horses before. You can ask around. I'd like to give it a try, at least.
- We know there's not much point.
- [Bullets Loading]
The horse is bad.
[Whinnies]
[Woman Gasping]
[Grunts]
- **** [Fiddle]
- [Chattering]
[Men Speaking Cantonese]
[Speaking Cantonese]
You know, the Chinese say you should have only one true love in your entire life... otherwise you are no better than a mangy dog or a loose woman.
- [Speaking Cantonese]
- What did he say?
Good thing I'm not Chinese.
- [Speaking Cantonese]
- What did he say?
He said what a lucky fellow I am to be with such a beauty as you.
Too lucky, if you ask me.
Oh, hello, Kate.
I didn't see you there.
- Fancy seeing you here.
- I'm just having a swift pint after work.
It's not like I'm a regular or anything.
A man needs to relax after a hard day's work.
What would you know about a hard day's work?
Sleeping and drinking and beatin' up yellow fellows is all you ever seem to do.
That's not fair, now.
I'm only doing me job.
I get along with everybody.
Everybody gets along with me.
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thank you. I have money.
- I just wanna buy you a drink.
- I said I don't want one.
You're startin' to get on me nerves now.
Think you're too good for me?
Is that it?
- Who do you think you are?
- Let go of me bloody arm.
You're hurtin' me.
- Let go of her arm, you.
- I'm just bein' friendly, Ned.
Just offering the young lady a drink.
- She doesn't want one from the likes of you.
- A problem there, Fitzpatrick?
No. There's no problem here,
Constable.
I'm sorry if I upset you...
Kate.
Right.
This one's a request from Ned Kelly.
Right.
Follow me, lads. One, two.
- **** [Fiddle]
- [Clapping To Beat]
The nerve of the bloody knacker.
Look at him. Acts as if he owns the place.
Come here and dance with your sister! Come on!
- [Whooping]
- That fella needs taking down a peg or two, that's for sure.
[Whooping]
[Barking]
- Ned, the horses are gone.
- What?
[Ned] The biggest thieves and liars
the sun ever shone on.
The Victorian police.
Well, I'm telling you something now, boys.
I'm not gonna let these bloody maggots put one over on me.
[Snoring]
[Mouthing Words]
[Ned Narrating]
To change a horse's brand
is easy, easier than you'd think.
You just pluck the little hairs
and prick the skin with iodine.
A "C"or an "O"
can become a "Q. "
"Q"for "Quinn"...
me mother's maiden name.
[Silverware Clanking]
[Barking]
Who's that at this hour of the night?
- Dan, is Kate in?
- Yeah, she is.
Well, would you mind telling her I'd like a word, please? In private, like.
No, I won't. She wants nothing to do with you. You know that full well.
[Chuckles] Well, I'd like to hear that from her, if you don't mind.
Fitzpatrick, you've already heard that from her many's the time.
Will you do yourself a favour.
Take a ride home.
- You think you're so smart.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I've a warrant for you.
- You've no warrant, you fool.
A Kelly stole them horses. I know it was, and I have a warrant for you.
Ned and all.
I've warrants for both of ya.
I don't suppose
I could see them warrants, could I?
There's your warrants.
Hmm? There's your warrants.
[Horse Whinnying]
Oh, hello.
I just came down
to find my riding jacket.
I thought I left it here somewhere.
I haven't seen it.
I was sure it was here.
If I find it, I'll be sure to bring it up to the house for ya.
- All right then.
- Right.
- You're from England?
- Yes.
Surrey, actually.
You're Irish?
Yeah. Me da was from Tipperary, but I was born here. I've never been to Ireland.
I came over when I was 17.
Richard acquired the land through his family, and...
My da had to go to all the trouble of stealing a sheep to get the trip over here.
He got a free fare then.
He was lucky.
Yeah.
- How are you tonight?
- Fine. Till you showed up.
[Chuckles]
Drink, boys?
- Steve?
- I don't drink with coppers.
Aye. There's no need for that.
So I'm leaving here tomorrow.
The work here for me is finished now.
Yes. I know.
So I won't be seeing you any more.
You sure you don't want to have a better look for that riding jacket?
No. I... I must have left it in the house somewhere.
Well, it was nice to have met you.
I really should go.
I think you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.
- You don't have any warrants at all, do you?
- Oh, I do, Mrs Kelly. I do.
I don't believe this.
You just plain thick or what?
Come on, Kate.
I'm just having a bit of fun, you know.
Now, let's see those bloody warrants.
I've split me head open!
You bastards!
- It's your hand, you bloody idiot.
- Hey, Fitzpatrick.
- Bottom rung on top now, huh?
- Shoot him.
- Don't, Dan.
- Give him back his bloody gun.
Go on! Get!
I'll be back for ya, ya bastards.
Can you believe the brass neck on that idiot?
Trying to be all friendly with the grog.
Yeah. He seemed sobered up when you pointed the gun at him.
- See his face?
- [Ma] I'm glad you think this is all very funny.
- Where have you been?
- Never mind where I've been.
- What's happened?
- Fitzpatrick couldn't hold his brandy and lemonade.
- What are you talking about?
- We had a fight with Fitzpatrick.
- A fight? Why?
- He said he had warrants for me and you.
- What warrants?
- Horse stealing, but there
was a load of shite in it.
- Whether it was or wasn't, there's trouble now either way.
- You can't take that seriously.
How can you stand there and act like this is one big joke, after all the trouble...
we've had with coppers
in this family?
- What are you thinking, Joe?
- You and Dan oughta clear out for a day or two... just to be safe.
God willing,
it'll all blow over.
- [Dog Barking, Distant]
- [Chattering, Distant]
What the hell happened to you?
- Ned Kelly shot me.
- He what?
- [Yells]
- [Ma] Take your rotten hands off me, you bastard!
- Get off her!
- You're under arrest!
I'm taking you to the cells!
[Ma] You filthy bastards!
[Kate]
Ned! Ned!
- Ned. Jesus, Ned, they've arrested Ma.
- They what?
Yeah. They've taken her to the cells, charged her with attempted murder.
- [Ned] Attempted murder?
- And Fitzpatrick's saying you took a shot at him.
- I wasn't even there.
- We know that, but it's your word against his.
Take the word of a drunken liar and arrest an innocent woman?
Is that right?
I won't take this injustice!
I'm gonna kill him!
I swear I'll scatter his blood and brains like rain!
- Ned! Ned! No!
- Stand aside!
- No, Ned! Don't make this worse for Ma!
- Stop it, Ned!
Take the children inside, please.
- What are you doing here?
- They arrested me ma.
- What for?
- The copper says I tried to kill him.
Why?
'Cause he's a bastard liar, like all coppers. That's why.
The thing is,
I wasn't even there.
I was here with you.
You could tell the truth,
show the swine up
for the drunken liar he is.
- And then they'd have to release me ma.
- That's impossible.
I couldn't. Do you realize what that would mean?
Yes.
I can't. I'd be disgraced.
He'd take away my children, and...
It's all right. I understand.
- Ned.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
Right.
[Latches Clanking]
[Gunfire]
[Ned Narrating]
I made them an offer at the outset:
Charge me
and let me mother go.
The answer came back:
"We don't bargain with outlaws.
We'll catch you anyway. "
[Chirping]
[Gunfire]
[Birds Screeching]
[Ned] You see those stretchers?
You know what they're for?
The bastards ain't plannin' on takin' prisoners, that's for sure.
There's another party down past the neck of Bullock Creek.
Four of'em. They've hemmed us in on either side, whether they know it or not.
[Ned] We'll come back at dawn, hold up
these two, take their guns and horses.
At least then we'll have a chance of
making a run for it.
Right.
[Chirping]
[Gun Cocks]
[Whistles]
Drop your arms!
[Chirping]
Christ, it's Lonigan, Ned.
You've killed Lonigan.
Do you want marmalade, Ned?
Are you gonna kill me or what?
I'll leave the force
first thing tomorrow morning.
I swear it on me mother's life.
Ned.
- Jesus Christ.
- Do as I said, and no one will get shot.
Sergeant, you'd better surrender.
You're surrounded.
You been into the whisky again, you old sod?
- Get some toast on, Lonigan.
- Lonigan's gone, and you two'll be next...
- If you don't get off them damn horses.
- [Gunfire]
[Horse Whinnying]
Oh, Christ!
- Give it up, man! It's over!
- [Gasping]
Will you stop running?
I won't shoot you. I swear.
- [Yells]
- [Birds Screech]
[Officer Grunts, Coughs]
[Spits]
- [Coughing]
- Why didn't you surrender?
I wouldn't have shot ya.
[Choking]
I can't breathe!
- No! I can't breathe!
- Right, right, right.
- Listen. It's okay.
- [Crying]
I can't breathe.
- One minute. One minute. One minute.
- [Continues Choking, Coughing]
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Oh!
- [Gasping, Choking]
- Why did you have to run?
I wouldn't have shot ya.
God damn. Look. No.
- I don't wanna die like this.
- No. No. I'm sorry I shot you.
I don't wanna... I got a wife and two children. [Crying]
What are they gonna do without me?
What are they gonna do without...
- No!
- Look at me. Look at me.
- God forgive me!
- [Gunfire]
[Gasping]
God forgive me.
[Whimpering]
[Ned Narrating]
I don't know why I took his watch.
It was something to do
with him not needing it.
[Thunderclap]
Later, I thought
about sending it to his family.
But by then, the papers had me down
as some sort of monster...
so I thought,
"No point now.
I'm damned anyway. "
[Door Unlatching]
Is it true what they've been saying about the three coppers?
Yeah, it's true.
Oh, God.
It was a fair fight, Ma.
Better them than Ned.
They'll kill him now.
They'll kill him for sure.
Don't shoot, lad.
I'm unarmed.
Come on. Put that away.
There aren't any troops.
- Aw.
- [Chuckling]
- You're bloody chirpy for this hour of the morning.
- Gotta keep your voice down.
- I've a visitor.
- Who?
- Mary Hegarty.
- Mary Hegarty!
- Mm.
- Jesus. She can be only 13.
I'm not superstitious.
Well, well, well, well, well.
I've never met a man whose lies are worth
€2,000 before, especially not Irishmen.
- It's €6,000.
- Is that what it's up to?
My cock alone's
worth more than that.
I could do with the money meself.
I'd build a shed out the back, buy a few horses.
In fact, I could buy half
of Beechworth with all that.
- That's very funny, Aaron.
- Clause two.
[Clears Throat]
They've recalled parliament.
Passed something called
"The Felons Apprehension Act."
It means we're listed as outlaws.
We can be shot on sight by anyone who chooses.
[Ned Narrating] They said
I'd lost what it meant to be human.
Maybe I never had it
in the first place.
- [Birds Screeching]
- But wasn't this about
protecting the ones I loved...
the ones who gave me food and shelter,
even the clothes on me back.
And therefore,
wasn't it now a war?
Dan, you see that wooden gate?
Around the back there is their living quarters.
If anyone's there, you keep 'em there.
[Children Laughing]
[Clock Ticking]
- [Bell Rings]
- [Door Closes]
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can. Me name's Edward Kelly.
- His mates call him Ned.
- Ned Kelly?
- I'm sure I've heard that name somewhere bef...
- I'm sure you have, sir.
[Child Talking,
Indistinct]
Stay where you are.
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?
Going to a funeral, eh?
Better do as I say, or it'll be your own.
- [Child] Ma.
- Shh.
- Fanny Shaw, what are you doing here?
- I work here.
- I can't believe it.
- What are you doing here, Steve?
We're robbing the bank. Me and Fanny used to go to school together.
Steve. Hello, kiddies.
[Mouthing Words]
- You're Ned Kelly.
- That's right.
What are you going to do with us?
You're coming with us to Faithfulls Creek.
We can't leave anyone behind... to raise the alarm, now, can we?
Mr Kelly, we are supposed to be attending a funeral today.
As you can see,
I'm dressed in mourning wear.
Obviously unsuitable for a woman travelling in the countryside, hostage or not.
- Even a blackguard like yourself...
- Susan!
I do apologize for my wife's behaviour.
There is no need to apologize on my account, Charles.
The man is wearing a magenta cravat, for God's sake.
I have an outfit just arrived from Melbourne.
L'eau du Nil silk.
Well, you'd better put it on then. Go on.
[Coughs]
Joe, you should follow her, make sure she doesn't signal from the windows with her bloomers.
- How dare you!
- Sure. I'm doing no harm.
What are these, these skulls?
- I collect them.
- Hello.
So you're Joe Byrne?
The papers say you have the facial features of a creature born to crime.
I'm the handsome one in the bunch.
They also said you married a Spanish housemaid in Diniliquin with the exotic name of Madela.
We were just good friends.
Mm. I suppose you have a lot of good friends.
I'm sure there's no harm in being friendly.
No, I don't suppose there is.
Oh, you're a beast... an absolute beast.
She's taking an awfully long time.
He just fell off the other side right into a puddle.
- You'll never guess who I ran into last week.
- Who?
Danny O'Reilly. He's working on the new rail line. He's got a wife and three kids.
[Steve] Sure. That's grand.
I haven't seen him in at least three years.
- That's like one kid every year.
- [Fanny Laughs]
[Dan]
Hey, Ned. Look at this.
Mortgages.
One of'em's for old man Wick's place.
- I recognize a couple of the others too.
- They're of no use to you.
They're the only records
I have of the bank's debtors.
Can I have them back, please?
[Both]
No.
[Ned Narrating]
So I killed their policeman,
and I robbed their bank...
but burning their mortgages... well,
that was destroying Crown property.
It was like slappin'
Queen Victoria herself across the face.
So they send in Hare,
Superintendent Francis Hare...
late of Cape Town,
South Africa.
And wasn't this the challenge
of your whole life, Superintendent?
A feather in your cap.
You can't catch me.
You don't have a hope of catching me,
so you take my friends instead.
Over a hundred men arrested,
stuck in stinkin'cells without trial...
while their crops
perish in the fields.
[Gasping]
And guess what. Not one of'em
caves in and tries to claim the reward...
not one of'em.
They loved mejust the same
and hated you all the more, didn't they?
- [Spits]
- Did you really think I was
gonna let 'em all rot?
Two and a half thousand pounds.
There's enough to pay rent on the leaseholds for lads in jail.
Thomas, you can take what you need for your mother to pay off her debt to McTeague.
- Thanks, Ned.
- And there's some for McKinleys and Bill Skilling... whatever he needs for his da.
Have you heard anything about me ma?
They set a trial at the end of last month.
She's been given three years hard labour.
I'm sorry, Ned.
I say, give me that back.
That blackguard just stole my watch.
- They say the Lord helps those who help themselves.
- [Ned] Give him back his watch.
- What?
- You heard what I said. I said, give him back his damn watch.
Have you gone simple all of a sudden?
We're robbing the bank.
Listen here, kid. This is the last time
I tell ya... Give him back his damn watch.
You're not innocent men.
You're a bunch of common criminals.
Did you hear that? If we act like common thieves, that's just what they'll call us.
[Sighs]
[Sniffs, Grunts]
My mother is rotting away in a prison cell... because of the lies of a policeman named Fitzpatrick.
She's an innocent woman, and so are these boys here.
My Irish brethren have been unlawfully imprisoned... and blacklisted from their selections.
How do you expect me to behave other than to stand up against this treatment?
[Exhales Strongly]
Any one of you here can take a shot at me and not be charged for it.
There's me gun.
Any of you feeling brave enough, go ahead.
No?
That's what I thought.
So if I can beg your patience, this is my statement... to the Premier of Victoria,
Graham Berry... and you here are my witnesses.
Joe, take out a pen and paper.
We'll write ourselves a letter.
Dear Sir...
Dear Sir...
"Dear Sir...
"I wish to acquaint you with some of the occurrences...
"of the present, past and future.
It will pay government to give those people who are suffering..."
...justice and liberty.
"...justice and liberty.
"I seek revenge for the evil name given me and my relations.
By the light that shines,
this is my warning. "
My brother and sisters
and mother... have to put up with the brutal and cowardly conduct of a parcel of...
- "...big, ugly..."
...big, ugly, fat-necked...
- "...fat-necked..."
- Wombat-headed.
Wombat-headed.
"...wombat-headed, big-bellied..."
- Magpie-legged!
- Magpie-legged.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
- Joe, write that down. Magpie-legged.
- [Laughter]
"...narrow-hipped, splaw-footed... sons of Irish bailiffs..."
Or English landlords better known as what? Victorian police.
[Laughter]
This section here you might find less amusing, Superintendent.
I give fair warning to all those who have reason to fear me... not to attempt to reside in Victoria.
[Ned Continues] Neglect this
and abide by the consequences...
which shall be worse
than than the rust in the wheat.
I do not wish to give this order full force without timely warning... but I am a widow's son outlawed... and my orders must be obeyed.
Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly.
- Look!
- Oh, my God.
It's Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne.
Can I get a kiss then?
Of course you can.
And a ladies' man, eh?
Where will you go, Ned?
The country belongs to us.
- [Townspeople Affirm]
- And we'll go wherever we like.
[Townspeople Cheering]
[Horse Whinnies]
[Keys Jingle]
[Coughing]
I hear you're planning on getting married, starting a family.
Well, I'll tell you this, lad.
Lack of cooperation will make it very hard for me... to get you out of here and back to that girl of yours.
I got nothing to tell you.
I don't need to tell you about the reward out. It's a lot of money.
You could put it to good use.
You're a friend of Joseph Byrne, aren't you?
You've known each other
since childhood... served time together, isn't that right?
Aaron, it's the Kellys we want.
We don't care about Joe.
If we let this run its course... he'll be shot down like the others.
The only chance
your friend will have...
depends on you.
If you'll help me with this...
I'll guarantee his safety.
[Men Shouting]
- [Insects Chirping]
- [Birds Squawking]
Ned!
[Birds Continue Squawking]
Jesus Christ. Come on.
Let's go.
[Men Chattering]
Sir.
[Nickers]
[Flies Buzzing]
They've poisoned it.
[Ned Narrating]
Lying low, living in caves,
you get to learn sometimes.
Eventually, you can read soils
and rocks like books.
[Narration Continues]
I've watched gravel fade.
Dust settle into crust.
I've seen drips of water...
turn to stone
that defied gravity.
I've turned blood red
with cave mud.
- I've been a bloody rock.
- [Snorts]
- [Slicing]
- [Whinnies]
[Horse Nickers]
- Aaah! Oh!
- [Chuckles]
[Gasps]
Sorry.
[Speaks Cantonese]
Wait... Please.
Can you help... to scrub my back?
I can't reach.
Where's your husband?
Out looking for you, like the rest of the country.
You took a risk coming here.
Well, turn me in so.
- You think God'll forgive us for what we've done, Ned?
- I don't know.
I suppose we're all gonna find out one day.
Just thinking of Ma rottin' away in that cell.
[Sighs]
Where do you think Da is, heaven or hell?
No. He wouldn't be in hell, you know.
He wasn't such a bad fella. He...
He was just a dumb paddy who got picked on his whole life.
And that does something to your pride, you know?
Can't even picture him.
When I was 10 and they gave me that green-and-gold sash... for saving that kid from drowning... that was the last time
I remember him.
He was proud of me that day.
We gonna be okay, Ned?
Of course we are, you little gorn, you.
You're just gonna keep running, aren't you?
They'll catch you eventually... or shoot you down.
Did you know they pardoned
Frank Gardiner in New South Wales?
On condition he left the colony.
- He gave himself in.
- He wasn't an Irishman.
Then why don't you just leave the county now, try for a new life somewhere in Queensland?
No. I can't.
It's not about me.
You know there's more to it than that.
What would it take to make you save yourself, Ned?
Hmm? My husband's best stallion?
Take it. It's yours. Forget the mares.
- More than that. Much more.
- What then?
The red one, too, would be nice... with you atop of it, beside me.
For that you'd save yourself, leave your friends behind?
And you your children.
Look. [Sighs]
You and me had no business with one another in the first place, did we?
Wasn't that the whole point of it?
Don't make me grieve for you.
[Exhales Deeply]
I ain't dead yet.
[Whimpers]
[Dog Whimpers, Barks]
Rebel!
- Kate. It's all right! It's us!
- Oh... Oh, you bloody swine!
- It's Ned. I know. Come here.
- [Laughing]
- [Gasps] Oh, my God.
- Now, Gracie, look at you.
You've grown too much.
Give us a cuddle. Come on.
[Groans]
Rebel, come on.
Come on.
So...
I saw that rascal Aaron Sherritt the other night.
Oh, yeah?
And what did you give him?
Nothing, you little scoundrel.
- Hmm.
- The thing is, I saw him talking to this fella... all friendly like on the way out.
Then the fella comes back here and starts asking me all sorts of questions about you.
Such as?
When did I see you last and where you were now... that sorta thing.
- Is he a copper, do you think?
- I don't know.
Well, it could've been nothing.
I just thought you ought to know, like.
Thanks, Maggie.
[Piddling]
[Dog Barking]
Hello, Aaron.
Joe?
[Exhales Deeply]
Ned. [Laughs]
So how's things, Aaron?
Not so bad. Well... not too bad.
I've been reading a lot about you, Ned.
You're a real terror altogether, aren't you?
We've been meaning to talk to you, Aaron.
We were wondering if you'd consider acting as a scout for us.
We're heading into Beechworth
to rob a bank there.
A scout? Well, I'm flattered you'd think of me, lads, but, uh...
- You're not interested?
- No. I-I'd love to.
If it was just up to me, I'd be in there like a shot. You know that.
But I've got the missus to think about now.
- Because between you and me, lads, she's up the spout.
- Ah, she isn't?
- Ah, sure, that's grand.
- Congratulations, Aaron.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
[Chuckles]
- How are Dan and Steve?
- They're fine.
Say hello to them for me, will you?
- We will.
- [Chuckles]
Well, I'd best get back to the party.
Mary will be wondering where I got to.
Sure. You go on
and look after that girl of yours.
Ahh.
I will indeed.
Sorry I can't help you out.
Good luck with it all anyways.

Aaron, what are you doing?
Some coppers on horses followed me until Wangaratta... but I met up with Tom Lloyd and Bill and we gave 'em the slip easy as you please.
- That's good.
- Here we go.
[Grunting]
That's great, Katie.
Yeah, well, I wish
I'd never bloody bothered.
You're all gonna get yourselves killed.
- We are not.
- You bloody well are!
No, we're not, Katie. We're gonna give 'em a show like they've never seen before.
[Ned Narrating]
There's a certain type of black tribesman...
that bends in the wind...
blends into the background.
Mostly he employs
the help of the dead...
to destroy other people.
The "Night Dancer, "they call him.
[Trigger Clicks]
God, when is someone gonna give me some proper cards.
Who's in?
[Sniffs]
Ugh. Fold.
- I'm turning in.
- I guess all that losin' would make you tired.
- You in or you out?
- Gimme three.
- You?
- I'm out.
[Door Creaks]
- [Sighs]
- What's happening?
Go back to sleep, love.
[Man]
Here. I call.
Three to the English queen.
- It's blessed you are, Nigel.
- [Chuckles]
[Woman]
Aaron!
- [Woman] Aaron!
- Who's that?
Who is it?
Another one of your whores, it looks like.
Just tell her to get lost,
unless she wants her head blown off.
[Whispers]
Lizzie, is that you?
Joe.
Why do you think he did it?
Just for the money?
Maybe he started thinking he was some kind of big shot...
instead of
a shit-kicker's son, like us.
- [Hissing]
- We have received word
that one of our informants...
has been shot dead
by the Kelly gang...
over near Beechworth.
We will entrain immediately
and proceed to Wangaratta.
From there, you'll be
split up into units...
and will fan out
across the country...
encircling
the immediate vicinity.
Stay close to your troop commanders... for your orders of march.
- [Horse Whinnies]
- I would remind you all... the men we are hunting have not only plundered two banks... kidnapped men, women and children... but have murdered three of your fellow officers.
They have outrun us before, gentlemen.
Do not allow them to do so again.
Don't you worry, sir.
We'll show the bloody animals.
We'll blow 'em all to kingdom come.
- [Laughter]
- These are not animals, Constable.
These are men who have been glorified as the leaders of a movement... a movement that threatens the stability of an entire country.
Underestimate them, and it will be you who will be blown to kingdom come.
[Ned Narrating]
They say the trouble with the Irish...
is that they rely
too much on dreams...
and not enough on gunpowder.
Whereas the English
were shy on dreams, as usual...
but had plenty of the other.
Now we had both.
- I suppose you're the Great Orlando.
- That I am.
Well, I'm the Great Ned Kelly, and this here is the Fabulous Joe Byrne.
We'd like to join your circus.
Ohh.
[Chuckles]
[Animal Bleats]
Mm.
That's right. You're not
seeing things. It's a camel.
I've got a lion and some ponies back down the road. And the Great Orlando of course.
If you're here to rob the train, you're too late.
We're not here to rob the train.
[Lion Roars]
[Exotic Animal Noises]
[Animal Noises Continue]
Joe, get this lot inside.
This good-looking fella over here is me brother, Dan Kelly.
These are my friends:
Joe Byrne at the bar there...
and Steve Hart
there in the back corner.
And I'm Ned.
We're all Irish boys
and selectors'sons.
Had war declared on us... by Victoria, by New South Wales.
By the crown.
And by the London Times even.
[Sniffs]
The reward on our heads is
the biggest one yet offered in the world.
It's up to €8,000.
[Inhales Deeply]
It's a lot of money.
We're the only four lads in the whole country... the entire empire, in fact... that any one of you fine citizens is allowed to kill... no questions asked.
No, it's true.
The queen said so herself.
That's right.
It's Regina versus us, the Kelly gang.
[Ned Narrating]
So our plans were set.
One. The traitor,
Aaron Sherritt...
dead, as arranged.
Two.
The police special from Benalla
coming to meet us.
The line torn up
to send the train to hell, as arranged.
Three. Superintendent Hare,
if he lives...
easily worth
an outlaw's mother.
And four. The townspeople
out of harm's way...
drinks on us, as arranged.
**** [Fiddle]
- Here you go.
- Oh, lamb! My favourite.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Now, cheer up there,
Mr Curnow.
- You're witness to history.
- [Revelers Laughing]
How many schoolteachers dream of that?
**** [Continues]
[Lion Growls]
Come on, Hare.
Where the hell are you?
[Growling]
- [Roars]
- [Train Whistle Blows]
[Knocking]
Were you sleeping?
You thinking of using that?
I'm mulling it over.
[Chuckles]
Right.
You don't remember me, do you?
You were just a boy then.
You were riding a Palomino mare with a white blaze.
[Ned]
Jane. Yeah.
Yeah.
Seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?
A lifetime.
Where's the other fella?
Where's Curnow?
Ned, Curnow's gone!
Come on!
Give me a hand here!
[Thunder Rumbling]
Quickly!
Get those horses off!
[Inaudible Dialogue]
[Metallic Scraping]
Knights in shining armour.
[Thunder Rumbling]
- Curnow stopped the train.
- Jesus.
- What does this mean?
- Hare's on his way.
You mean we didn't get any of'em?
Not a soul.
There'll be a hundred of them... at least.
[Man Shouting Orders]
You okay, Dan?
Yeah, I'm okay, Ned.
[Breathes Deeply]
Steve?
Short life, but a merry one.
- Joe?
- We're gonna give them a good old fight, aren't we?
Well, that's that then.
All right.
Everyone listen to me!
We're getting you out of here!
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Man Shouting Orders]
[Growls]
[Ned]
Hold your fire!
We've got women
and children coming out.
[Man]
It's a trick!
[Screaming]
Stop your fire!
Cease fire!
[Screaming Continues]
[Hare]
Hold your fire!
Cease fire!
- [Women Screaming]
- Get down on the floor!
Keep your heads down!
Stay on the floor!
They fired at us!
They shot him!
Keep as low as you can, you hear?
All right.
Let's give it to 'em.
Hit the lights.
Fire!
[Groans]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
They have armour on their bodies!
Aim for their arms
and legs!
- Ohhh! Ahhh.
- He's been shot!
- They've shot Hare!
- [Ned] All right. Get back inside.
Get back inside.
Come on.
[Bullets Ricocheting]
Oh! Dan, reload me pistols!
I got the bastard that shot me.
Give me that anyways. Rifle!
[Groans]
Bullets. Come on.
[Bullets Continue Ricocheting]
[Women Screaming]
- [Shrieks]
- Aw. The monkey's been shot!
Poor little bugger!
Ah, dear God.
Oh! Shit.
- [Woman Yells]
- [Groans]
Somebody help me, for Christ's sake!
Keep low! Get around
the back of the bar!
[Groaning]
Can you find me something to stop the bleeding?
[Ned]
Get down!
- [Groans]
- To hell with all you bastards!
[Bullets Continue Ricocheting]
[Groaning, Screaming]
[Woman Sobbing]
Ned! Where the hell are you going?
Get this lot around the back.
Ned?
Now's your chance. Quickly!
[Joe]
Out that back door there!
[Groans]
Aaah!
Ohhh!
[Groans]
[Breathing Heavily]
Hands up, the lot of you, or you'll be shot down like dogs!
Don't shoot!
[Screaming]
I got him!
I got Dan Kelly!
No, you bloody well haven't.
[Bullets Continue Ricocheting]
Jesus Christ, lads.
I think I need a drink.
[Grunts]
[Gunfire Fades Away]
[Ned Narrating]
What I best recall is riding alone...
with the sun behind me...
seeing me own shadow
cantering ahead...
against the roadside weeds
and willows...
and leaving me
stretched far behind...
galloping to chase it...
[Breathing Heavily]
Like a centaur
in the picture books.
Well done, Ned.
[Ned Narrating]
I wore it seriously...
me hero sash
of green and gold.
Proof that
I've saved a life as well.
I'm out of rounds.
[Whimpers]
Do you have any left?
[Sobs]
Only two.
I guess that's all we need then, isn't it?
We never stood a chance, did we?
- [Sobs]
- [Sobs]
[Crying]
[Gunshot]
[Sobbing]
No.
Steve.
No.
[Gunshot]
[Groaning]
It's Ned Kelly.
Christ almighty, it's Ned Kelly.
Do you mind if I have this?
[Train Whistle Blows]
- [Children Giggling]
- [Boy] Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly!
Ned!
Hey, Ned!
[Ned Narrating]
Such is life.
Despite petitions for a pardon that bore a total of 32,000 signatures...
Ned Kelly was hanged on 11 th of November, 1880.
He was 25 years old.
[Man]
** At the end of my days **
** When I'm called to go **
** Into the open arms **
** Of the Holy Ghost **
** To have lived such a life **
** As I have known **
** Oh, fortune follow me **
** That I'm afraid no more **
** For my great mistakes **
** I will surely pay **
** I'm running low **
** And the devil is on my trail **
** When fate delivers me **
** All I'll ask it for **
** Is a place
to rest and shelter **
** O'er my soul **
** Oh, if I could
spend my days **
** Free from the prison
of your gaze **
** Then I could die a happy man **
** Oh, if I could spend my days **
** Free from the shadow
of my name **
** Then I could die a happy man **
** And when I am released **
** From this mortal load **
** I'll take my leave **
** But I don't wanna go **
** When fate delivers me **
** All I'll ask for **
** A place to rest and shelter **
** O'er my soul ****
**** [Classical Concerto]
Oh, my God!
You're still there, like a vegetable.
Writing a good e-mail is hard.
Yes, especially when it is a huge mistake.
-Shut up.
-Joey, l am serious.
E-mail expression is the scourge of today.
The lnternet has made it way too easy to express oneself.
Okay, you have some fleeting thought.
You send it. lt lands with a thud in some unsuspecting person's mailbox.
Said person then reads it, gets irked...
...because you've recapped a conversation you already had.
They fail to respond, you feel slighted.
But, if you must be one of these pathetic...
...passive-aggressive e-mail types...
...far be it from me to stop you.
What do you have so far?
Well, l had '' Dear Dawson,'' and then l erased it.
Why? l think that's a nice start.
-lt seemed cold.
-True.
You did just nude-up with the guy.
Or did you guys do it through a hole in a sheet...
...that's very Dawson and Joey.
-Again, shut up.
-Sorry.
-Okay, so, what do you want to say?
-l don't know. l mean...
...l don't like the way things ended.
And l want him to know that l care...
...but l also want to hold on to my righteous indignation.
Obviously.
Well, why don't you just pick up the phone and call him? l'm afraid we'll fall right back into old patterns. Trust me...
...e-mail is a far safer alternative at the moment.
Okay, if you must do this, then l say that you go for it.
You know, be gooey, and be embarrassing...
...but most of all, just be real, Joey.
Say all of the things you can't say to his face, the whole nine.
You're right. l better get to work.
But...
-...thank you, Audrey.
-No problem, sister Christian.
That's gross.
-That's gross?
-Yeah.
-l thought you'd be more--
-Sensitive? Well-groomed?
-Up by 6, drinking a Zone shake?
-To begin with. l thought you'd be more--
Snaggletoothed? Sucking down the tea? Choking on bangers and mash? lt's a service we provide to those less educated of our cultures, you and l.
We keep them guessing.
Okay, yuck it up, kiddies, because this is how l will...
...appear every morning, in all my formal glory.
Some of us have to work for a living.
Poor Pacey Witter has a job that millions want...
-...that he's vastly underqualified for.
-Oh, come on.
What's up with that hair, man?
Why is it...
-...the way it is?
-lt's too much product?
You sure that blond of yours isn't a ruse? lf you can't deal with the man love...
-...l don't think this is gonna work out.
-Don't remind me. l know you've got this brilliant job...
...but you still have to put the dishes in the wash before you go.
Which is exactly why l came down here.
And you, Jack, left the door unlocked last night...
...after the hard sell you boys gave me about free security.
That wasn't me. That was him. l'm totally non-confrontational.
All right, okay.
All right, duly noted.
Man, between the suit and nagging...
...it's like an old-fashioned
American family around here.
You've got a message.
-Audrey!
-What?
-Audrey, wake up.
-What?
-The e-mail.
-What about it? l sent it to everyone. Not ''the gang,'' countless strangers...
...'' Campus-wide'' everyone.
Honey, why would you do that? lt was a mistake. l was tired. l clicked on the wrong address.
See? l told you that wasn't a good idea.
That's all you have to say? l don't know.
Sucks to be you?
-Witter.
-Rinaldi.
That's ''sir'' until you buy me flowers,
Witter. Where have you been? l was under the impression l wasn't supposed to be here till--
''Supposed to''? Well, that's cute.
You dress yourself...
...or does Mommy want you to look like a pansy?
Look around. You see these guys?
Apparently, these gentlemen are free thinkers.
Since you've yet to grow a pair, you get stuck with these.
-And what's all this?
-That is a collection...
...of about 30 cold days in hell.
Rich guys sitting on piles of money so high their daughters eloped...
...and sold their babies on the black market just to put ramen on the table.
We've never been able to sell them stock...
...and they will never buy it from the tardy likes of you.
Better get on the phone.
We work on commission here.
And the guys on your list don't know how dreamy you are...
...so l would work that blue-collar charm full throttle.
Stop batting your eyes at me. ls this some sort of punishment? l'm just trying to get you to leave. l don't have enough desks.
No, Jen. Jen, can l sit on the inside? l wanna sit on the inside. Sorry.
What? Sorry.
Are we done playing musical chairs yet? l wanna be able to see the board.
Don't insult me with scholarly guise.
-You want a good look at Freeman.
-And why not? Mother, may l?
Audrey, not that we don't enjoy having you here, because we do...
...but don't you have your own classes?
Worthington's charms are lost on me.
Miss one more week, they'll kick you out.
-That would be awesome.
-Guys:
Okay, l forgot to tell you.
This is studious Jack, not to be confused with fun-time Jack.
He doesn't like to miss a word of Freeman's lecture, so keep it down.
So tell me, between him and Grams, how do you nap during class?
You don't, too difficult.
-Guys, guys.
-Before we get started...
...l just wanted to inform those among you who are...
...truly enamored with our twisted culture...
...that there's a little extra-credit assignment today.
Now, my heart won't be broken if nobody shows up. l will, however, silently judge you for the rest of the semester.
There's a theater downtown showing a double feature which exemplifies...
...our culture's obsession with the beautiful girl who plays ugly.
The plain Janes who go on to grace the covers of Cosmo...
...the same month their makeover movies come out.
Oh, no. Scholar Jack is gonna make me watch Miss Congeniality again. l love that movie.
So see me after class for details.
Okay, kiddies, knock back your Ritalin and settle down.
You may recall, we were wrapping up a depraved discussion...
...of Portnoy's Complaint last week...
Sadly, we won't be dabbling in Roth's stream of consciousness...
...sexual rivers much longer.
But fate assigned us some additional reading last night via e-mail. l think you all got a copy, so why not?
Let's discuss something you actually might have read.
'' Dear Dawson...
...l don't know where to begin.''
-Professor Hetson--
-Nobody likes a showoff, Potter.
You don't reach a point for several paragraphs, so l'll skip ahead.
'' ln the moment when we touched...
...maybe we went somewhere else that rose above all this.
But then we landed, and l think maybe we crashed.''
Why, when broaching the topic of sex...
...do writers try to write themselves out of it?
Sexuality and all its dysfunctions are intrinsic to the human experience...
...maybe the one thing we can all relate to at the end of the day.
Well, neurosis and the God thing aside.
And the reason that Roth seduced us, and Miss Morning-After here didn't...
...is that while Roth isn't afraid to get his hands quite literally dirty...
...with rapid-fire sensual description...
...our e-mail author here...
...distances herself from the act with vague metaphors.
Can't be stream of consciousness...
...if you're observing from the shores.
Right?
Right.
Well, no-- l mean, l certainly understand that logic, Mr. Engel.
But, l'm telling you, if you invest in this stock now, your value...
...it'll double, eventually.
The stock?
Well, the stock is strong. l mean, if you....
Percentage-wise? Well, yeah, you're probably looking at a good 1 5-- Hello?
Smooth, Witter.
The guy just caught me off guard.
Listen, you gotta stop making excuses. l've heard you on the phone.
You think people relate to a plucky, blue-collar kid from Southie?
-Capeside.
-Whatever.
Still reeks white picket and black lab.
You're talking like you're trying to get a date Friday night.
'' l'm Pacey. l'm sensitive. l care about your needs.''
That's the angle of the guy trying to sell the Herald.
Don't make him feel like the pretty girl.
Make them feel like morons for doubting your financial prowess.
So you want these people to hang up on me?
No. l want them to believe you, which won't happen...
-...unless you put heart into it.
-Fine. How am l to sell them stocks? l don't even know what the damned thing is.
Find your in with these guys.
Become them.
Become who they wanna be.
Think with those judgmental, ageist, racist, sexist, stereotyping...
...parts of your brain that you've worked so hard to conquer.
Believe me, you're never gonna land a guy like Topper playing the nice guy.
And who exactly is Topper?
Mr. Eli Topper is the next guy in your pile, fantastically hard sell.
Lives in a little apartment, outskirts of Boston...
...doesn't wanna pay city tax.
Made millions in the '80s, now he's sitting on it.
Why go through the trouble of getting that money...
...if you won't use it to better your life?
Guys like Topper believe it can buy them an upgrade in heaven.
Since you and l know we're never going there...
...grab your keys.
We're going off campus.
Remember, you can't technically pour the alcohol, not while l'm on with you.
No need to bring in the vis-à-vists.
No offense, but you do know l've worked in a restaurant before. l've seen them built, burn down--
Not that l had anything to do with that.
Fascinating, but you've never worked in this dive, now, have you?
Come on, then, have a go at table three. l would think long and hard before sending...
...an e-mail like that to a guy l just slept with. l know, right? l mean, unless she just never wanted to hear from him again.
-You guys know what you want?
-Not all guys are like that.
Oh, whatever, Mike. You're gay.
A quesadilla and a pale ale.
Maybe the guy's gay too.
That's why he screwed her over.
Okay, look, she is obviously starving for attention, broadcasting it like that? l mean, really, what's the point?
Unless you're on The Real World or whatever.
You know, maybe...
...this is a shot in the dark, she didn't mean to send it at large.
She's trying to get private closure, never dreamed she'd be subjected...
...to the Oprah psychobabble of her life-lacking peers.
You guys want something to eat, or should l bring bonbons...
...so you guys can hunker down and watch your stories?
Maybe later.
Boston Bay is not a party school, Audrey.
Spare me lies. l'm not going back to my evil den of higher learning.
This is clearly where it's at.
The midday keggers get a little old after a few semesters, trust me.
Tell you what, l'll meet you guys in there.
-l'm gonna talk to Professor Freeman.
-Think that's a tad Tracy Flick?
-He doesn't know who you are.
-Sure he does. l've raised my hand and talked in class a lot of times. He's noticed.
-He has.
-All right, Swimfan.
Somebody has got to talk to him about his love of the straights.
Whatever. lt's totally hot.
Okay, see you inside.
Hey.
-Not a very big turnout.
-No, apparently not. l guess...
...not everybody is as enthusiastic...
...about the girl who cried ugly as we are.
Right. l'm sorry, do l know you?
No. Sorry. Jack McPhee. l'm in your Pop Culture class.
Oh, l'm sorry, Jack. That class is massive, hard to keep people straight. l'll bet.
-l'll see you in there.
-Okay.
Sure l haven't made a fantastic mistake, then, living with those two?
-No. l'm sure you won't be bored.
-Now, that's a cold comfort.
You've got to be kidding me.
Him? Yeah, he comes in here all the time.
Oh, of course he does.
He's obviously been assigned to ruin my life...
...and he seems determined to do it in record time.
Listen, l'm not going to run for cover every time a dark cloud...
...forms over your head.
So l suggest you nip this in the bud.
He's all yours. l see why this joint would be more alluring...
...than the confines of the English Department...
...all that silence, all those books.
And then, of course, your constant positive reinforcement.
Yeah, right. That would get really annoying after a while.
Waiting for me to order, or you have something to say? lt looks like you've got your '' bone to pick'' face on.
How would you know that look?
Word gets around.
-l'll just have a tuna melt and a beer.
-Sure.
-Professor Hetson--
-There you go.
Yeah, here l go. l'm sure your hard-as-nails thing really works for you. l'm sure it earns you respect...
...and l'm sure that l will learn a lot in your class.
After today, l wish you would've turned me away when you had the chance.
Thought you'd be flattered to be in the spotlight. l don't single people out that often.
Contrary to what you believe, l'm not an idiot, Professor Hetson. l'm fairly certain in the 20 minutes you spent mocking my formative years...
...was a major off-ramp from modern comp lit.
And l'd just like to know, does today's total evisceration...
...exonerate me, say, through November...
...or does this sort of public ridicule delight you indefinitely? l don't know. We're about to get into the poignant ramblings...
...of Joyce and Woolf, and your work provides such a marked contrast.
Hey, Joey...
...you do fancy yourself a writer, correct?
-Yeah, you could call it a hobby.
-So l'm sure you've gathered...
...that on top of being neurotic and plagued with self-doubt...
...writers have to endure public humiliation once in a while.
You walked into my office promising me...
...fearless academic ego, but l have yet to see it. lf you can't handle my class...
...and countless have died trying, why don't you just quit? l'm not a quitter.
-People love saying that. lt's like they saw it in some movie and liked how it sounds.
Look, l'm not just saying it, okay? l wanted to take your class to learn something and to work hard. l didn't want to be ridiculed in the process.
Your heartfelt rant to what's-his-name...
...proved good fodder for the topic at hand. lt's hard to write that sex stuff...
...which you aptly proved.
And if, by chance, one day you manage to get your writing...
...circulated beyond the campus in-box, there will always be...
...an irritable writer-type claiming to do better.
You didn't mean for this to go out in the world. Whatever. Bygones.
Declare victory and move on.
Where's the victory in this little scenario?
One down, only a lifetime of proving yourself left to go.
And if you're staying in my class...
...start proving that it's worth it.
To one of us, at least.
Man, you don't actually sleep in this car, do you?
Not recently. l just moved into a new place.
Good, because l don't want to start feeling sorry for you or anything.
You don't see these around much anymore.
Oh, come on, man.
This is a great car.
Sure, it's a lot of work, but she's worth it, you know?
Turn into that dealership right over there.
What, are we going for a test drive?
That's one bonding experience that's passed us by. No.
This one is signed and paid for.
Picking it up.
You've gotta be kidding me.
You cannot possibly be getting a Z8.
-Nice, huh?
-Nice?
How could you afford a car like that?
You're not that much older than me.
Yes, but l'm so much wiser.
Don't sweat it.
Maybe if you snag Topper, all this'll be yours before you know it.
Nice car. l'll take it from here.
Hey, l happen to like my car, thank you very much.
Yeah, you've got a way to get around town...
...but it's all about what your car says about you.
Okay, l'll bite.
What does my car say about me?
That you're a sentimental fool of a man-child.
You're too weak for a real car...
...so you tinker with your medium-cool, vintage one.
You surround yourself with all things good...
...but not good enough.
You don't wanna grow up...
...so you don't go to school...
...and you borrow your suits, and you let your facial hair run amuck.
That's fine, but then why get in the ring at all...
...if you won't even throw a punch?
You gonna go in that office and watch guys collect their money...
...so you can write a piece about it in your memoirs?
Well, maybe l don't care about any of that stuff.
Maybe l'm just trying to pay my rent.
Come on, Pacey. l see something going on in there.
You're not subjecting yourself to me because you like my tie.
You're hungry. So quit F-ing around and go for it already.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, l hear you, Mr. Topper. When my father needed an open-heart...
...l didn't touch my savings.
He got himself into that...
...he can get himself out. Right?
You and l are both very busy men...
...if you don't wanna hear about this stock...
...that's fine by me. l'm just gonna call one of our more active buyers.
Yes, the packet of information my company sent you...
...is worth taking a look at...
...but it is nothing compared to what landed on my desk this morning.
But, look, you and l, we both know...
...you're not an active buyer, if you're not interested...
...fine by me.
Just tell me right now.
Spare me the niceties, l am not your prom date. l'll call my other guy. l made him 50 grand last week. l'm pretty sure he'll be happy to take my call, right?
Okay, so here's the story.
The buyers in the market are playing close to the vest now.
But when they wake up, they'll be kicking themselves...
...because the buying price on this will have doubled. lf you get in right now, you'll beat the guys who wake up in the morning...
...remember that they actually have a pair, and that greed is good, Eli.
The sucker down the street, he's never gonna know the joy you know.
By getting in early, you made 1 0 times the profit he did...
...and that's something you'll be able to rub in his face...
...every time you pick up your paper. l knew you were a smart man the second you picked up the phone.
Let me just put you through to my assistant...
...you can give her your information. lt has been a pleasure doing business with you.
Thanks, guys.
Latham, get me that spreadsheet by 3.
Don't you knock? l could've been having a nooner.
Oh, l thought you were.
Anyway, guess what.
Know what? Don't guess, you'll ruin it for me.
-l just closed Topper.
-You're kidding me.
No, friend, l'm not. l closed Topper. l sold him a B.S. line from an '80s movie. He bought it. l was a profiler. l could smell the cheap fear on this guy's breath.
He'd rather buy stock today, ask questions tomorrow...
...as long as he's the richest guy on the block. lt's amazing. l sell, he buys. lt's that simple. Can you believe it?
You know what? l can.
Man, Witter, l knew you were a sneaky little twerp...
...but l never thought you'd pull this on me, not today.
-Come here, give me a hug.
-You serious?
No. But go to that refrigerator and get us some icy cold beverages.
-l'm proud of you, son.
-Will do!
-Anyway, l'll see you Tuesday.
-All right.
Hey, Professor Freeman.
-Hi. Jack, right?
-Yeah.
Yeah, that's Jack. l'm Jen. l'm in your class too.
That's right. l've seen you two sit together.
Hi.
Am l losing my mind?
Are you in my class?
No. No, l'm just a really big fan of your work.
And the work of beautiful, ugly women everywhere...
...and l'm really just interested in this pure culture of ours, and....
Yeah, so do you guys wanna go visit Joey at work...
...and partake in some refreshments?
Professor, you're welcome to join if you're into crossing the line.
That sounds great.
Why don't you get the car...
...and l'll meet you at the corner.
You're gonna let me drive the Saab?
Of course, Jennifer.
Why wouldn't l?
So why don't you two skedaddle, and l'll see you in a second.
-Okay.
-Okay.
There you go. At least l know who's not in my class.
Yeah.
Did you forget something inside?
-Oh, no.
No, look, l don't expect you to know who l am. l just wanted to tell you that l enjoy your class. l haven't really cared about school in a while. l haven't cared about anything in a while.
But seeing the work you put into lectures, seeing a teacher...
...that's interesting and dynamic...
...and not just trying to blow through another 50 minutes...
...it just really means a lot to me. l didn't know what l was gonna declare as a major...
...but now, l don't know if it's the way you word things...
...or it's the subject matter, but l walk away from class still thinking about it...
...and l just look forward to the next time...
...and l was just wondering how l could become more involved, you know.
Are we talking about the class, Jack, or are we talking about me?
No. No.
No, it's not what l meant. lt's just--
-l mean, l'm not-- Well, l am, but--
-Don't sweat it.
Look, l'm glad you like the class.
And l think it'll show in your work this semester. l'm walking this way. Are you?
Yeah. Yeah.
Mr. Frickee, l'm telling you, it's a one time--
Hello? Cheap bastard.
Any luck?
No, not on that one.
Yeah, knew you were a one-hit wonder.
You wish, man.
Here, sport, buy yourself some lunch.
Are you kidding?
No, you gotta work your way up.
Come on, do it fast.
No one is getting lunch today. They'll think l've gone soft. Five minutes.
Did anyone hear it?
-No, but Johnson said it was killer.
-Yeah?
He said it was like he smelled the blood...
...and didn't stop until he tasted it.
He is so fricking awesome.
-What's going on?
-Oh, you didn't hear?
-That's why l'm asking.
-Rinaldi, man.
He closed Topper.
-What?
-They said it couldn't be done.
-The guy is, like, my personal God.
-Hey, ease up, Henderson.
You're looking a little light in the loafers.
-Hey, you think he got partner for that?
-Oh, he'll get something.
You gonna pick something or not?
No, man.
Look, in fact, this one's on me.
Enjoy yourself, all right?
Hey. You start today?
So it would appear. l need two beers and a vodka tonic.
Emma's in the back.
Yeah, right, you can't pour your own drinks.
Well, this should be fun, babysitting you on top of everything else.
-And what's that supposed to mean?
-Don't get all fired up, okay? l'm just not in the mood to take on your rage tonight. l'm sure you'll be just as oversensitive tomorrow.
Oh, l get it.
You wanna see me crack, huh?
The endless horrors of the day are a waste...
...unless they result in my nervous breakdown?
-You have a bad day or something?
-Like you don't know.
Too bad you didn't show up today...
...and hear Hetson's brilliant critique of my e-mail.
That was the high point. Although, l also loved walking into rooms...
...to hear people whispering and laughing at me.
There's nothing better than reaching for the last Jell-O...
...and getting unsolicited sexual advice from a stranger.
Sounds fascinating.
Sorry l missed it.
You know, contrary to popular belief...
...l didn't send that e-mail to get feedback from everyone. l was thinking, since l've been mocked...
...for most of today, maybe you could spare me...
...and concentrate on your own deep unhappiness for a while.
You know, strangely, before you got all crazy confessional on me...
...that's exactly what l was doing. l hadn't been planning how to best torture you.
You see, we don't just walk off into a void when we leave your line of vision.
Some of us even have our own lives and don't even talk about you at all.
Now, l'm sorry that some brutal...
...lvy League kids made fun of your e-mail today.
To tell you the truth, l'm not much of an lnternet guy...
...so, sadly, l have missed yet another aspect of your riveting, charmed life.
But if you can't pour the drinks...
...can you at least serve them?
Thanks.
Witter. Thought you'd gone home.
Yeah, l figured you were waiting so you could sneak out the back door.
But l just had a question l had to ask you, and please...
...spare me the dime-store speech on what a sucker l am until l've left.
-l can't promise you anything.
-Yeah, l'm getting that. l just wanted to ask you why you bother with the act.
With the whole, you know, tough love,
'' let me show you the ropes'' act?
Because you don't actually want me to succeed, do you? ln fact you're praying for me to fail.
That way, you have one less sheep in the herd.
And if l do succeed, then you're my friend?
No, then you're gonna keep on taking my money that l earned...
-...and counting it as your own.
-Do you need me here for this, or--?
Well, l just wanna know why you bother.
Why would you take the time out of a busy day...
...to build someone up, make them feel worthy...
...if you'll just steal all their glory at the end anyway?
This is a business. l didn't wake up looking for some plucky kid to take under my wing. l came here to do my job, just like every day.
Running you hard? Yeah, that's my job. Singing your praises isn't.
Landing Topper, that was a fluke.
A genius fluke, but a fluke nonetheless.
We don't hand those deals over to the little guys.
You haven't taken your Series 7.
That bodes well for the future...
...but today, it means nothing.
So l'm just supposed to turn the other way on this?
Slap you on the back, congratulate you like the rest of your minions?
No, man, that is not why l came here.
You can do what you wanna do.
Maybe you'd rather continue floating numbly in the status quo.
Maybe you wanna be me, and that's so scary you can't think straight.
So walk away, Witter, it's what you do.
And this is what l do, and l'm freaking good at it.
You wish you were this good, and that's why you bother trying.
You think someone didn't do the exact same thing to me?
Done like a true professional.
-More like a permanent bar wench.
-l'm sorry you had such a bad day, Jo.
Serves me right.
We don't take kindly to closure here.
You know, if it makes you feel any better...
...l hardly heard about the e-mail all day.
You weren't on campus all day.
Details, Joey.
-Does Dawson even know about it?
-No, that's the thing. l mean, it wasn't even addressed to him.
My intimate aftermath was discussed in English class...
...but Dawson will never know.
Well, maybe that's not such a bad thing...
...because this way, there's a little more space between you guys...
...and, technically, you still have a clean slate.
Yeah, seriously, personal humiliation...
...could've been a lot worse than the public kind.
What dream world are you two living in?
Oh, right. Sorry.
Okay, so l have an idea. l'll be, like, your sponsor, and then the next time...
...you're jonesing to express yourself, you can just call me.
Hey.
Pacey!
Oh, dear Lord.
Today was terrible! Don't ever go back to work. Never, never, never!
-Don't tempt me.
-You know l will.
-Hey, guys.
-Hello, Mr. Witter.
-We're not drinking, we swear.
-Rough day.
You don't know the half.
Save a seat for me? l'm gonna go freshen up.
-ls he okay?
-l don't know, but it's not my fault.
Joey, who is that?
-Eddie.
-He is a ruggedly dreamy sort.
He's got a major chip on his shoulder...
...the size of which rivals only the one on my shoulder.
He's okay.
-ls Emma still here?
-No, she left about an hour ago.
-l think she was heading home.
-How is it living with her?
She run around in her underwear and ask you guys to zip things up for her?
That's funny. Actually, the three of us took a bath together this morning. l thought you only took baths with Grams.
Can we go get a breath of fresh air for a sec?
Of course, honey.
Pacey, that is bull!
You can't let him get away with it.
He's gonna keep doing it. l've no doubt he will. But l don't think tattling on him is gonna do any good.
That's how they do business. l didn't know that getting in, but l do now.
The only question that remains is how do l get through the days?
Well, that doesn't sound like the greatest way to live.
Pacey, you're 20 years old, and you're already waiting for time to pass.
Honey, why don't you quit?
Because it's not that easy.
Yes, it is.
Pacey, these are supposed to be, like, the easiest days of our lives.
We're supposed to be in there with our friends, you know...
...coming up with ridiculous drinking games and making each other laugh. l think we've all figured out the real world is a pretty crappy place...
...so, what's the rush in getting there?
Because sooner or later, you run out of places to hide.
You seem to be operating under the assumption...
...that you can do whatever you like, and you just can't. l peeked behind the curtain...
...now l can't pretend fantasy is the same as reality. l've been killing time for too long. l wanna make something for myself...
-...whether it's easy or not.
-l'm sorry that you feel...
...like l've been a colossal waste of your time.
That's not what l mean, and you know it.
You and l come from very different worlds, you know that, right? l didn't realize how different until l went to L.A. this summer.
My dad is a heartless old fool just like your dad.
He just wears more expensive suits, that's all.
Yes, he does. l'm not expressing this very well, am l? l'm trying to say...
...that l need respect. l respect you. l know you respect me, and l love you for it...
...but that's not what l'm talking about. l need respect out there.
And maybe l gotta take a different path than l thought l was going to...
...but c'est la vie.
The only thing l know for sure right now...
...is l need sleep.
So if you and l go home right now...
...we will sleep, right?
We can do whatever you want. ls it always gonna be like this? l don't know. l can't tell.
Come on.
Now, we're not talking immediate sleep here, are we, baby?
-No.
-Good.
-Jo, thanks. We're out of here.
-Good night.
Bye, guys.
That's your share.
Thanks.
-Look, Eddie, about earlier--
-Hey, don't sweat it. l didn't miss anything big in class today, did l? l mean, aside from the aforementioned e-mail thing?
Which led to the afore-witnessed freak-out?
No.
Man, l hate this song.
Yeah, me too.
Thank you.
Thanks for doing the dishes. l think that was Pacey. l heard him get up somewhere around the crack of dawn.
Well, he cleans and he leaves before l wake up.
That's more than l can say for my last boyfriend.
Man, l do not wanna go to classes today.
Why? l mean, aside from typical sloth?
Yeah. lt's my professor. He just--
-Never mind.
-No, what?
Well...
...l don't know. l mean, we had this...
...really weird moment yesterday where it seemed like l was into him.
Well, did it seem like you're into him or do you really fancy him? l really fancy him, but l don't want him to know that.
Well, maybe he was flattered.
Or maybe he was married?
Well, he should be flattered.
Yeah, you know what, give me some of that stuff.
Yeah. Okay.
Oh, God!
This stuff is horrible!
-How do you drink this crap?
-Well....
Come on.
Morning.
Good morning.
Oh, sorry.
So nice to see you, Potter.
Hope our pesky class didn't interfere with your important e-mail schedule.
Whip out another diatribe last night?
Actually, l did. l was hoping this was it.
Did you guys not get it?
This is actually a copy of the article l assigned to follow up the reading. l know your mini-drama probably prevented you...
...from even looking at the syllabus.
Well, most of yesterday consisted of eviscerating my personal life...
...and every lesson is a rant composed of your dated theories. l'm sorry l'm late, Professor Hetson...
...but the first half of class is when you reveal how bitter you are...
...how moronic we are, and how literature is dead.
Were you thinking of moving on...
...to something slightly more stimulating today? l think we've been spending too much time together, if that's your attitude. l was thinking of teaching today. l don't know if l've got a lot to offer, with tenure and the published articles.
But if you all insist on being stimulated...
...why don't we discuss James Joyce's description of the girl on the beach. l mean, l'm too hackneyed to illuminate the subject...
...but maybe someone else can shed some light.
Wilson.
What do you think?
Leery! Come on, break's over.
Does your father know you're here?
No, he doesn't, and he needn't.
I would like my photograph taken.
But I can't take your photograph without your father's permission.
You mean even you are afraid the camera will steal my soul?
Then no woman will come to your studio.
Please, come this way.
Liu, take her photograph.
Ladies.
Liu.
Don't worry. I won't tell my father about your Shadow Magic.
Thank you, but...
I plan to tell him myself.
That you are the one ruining his business?
Well, yes.
If you tell him that, he'll never accept you.
Does that mean if I don't tell him,
I would be accepted?
Look right here.
Straight into the lens.
He's touching her!
A little smile.
You are captured forever.
I need another plate.
Excuse me.
Poor Liu.
He's unusually distracted.
He's been so busy... preparing for his wedding.
His wedding?
Liu is engaged to marry a widow.
I brought more plates.
- I must go.
- Wait!
I'll bring the prints to you.
You needn't bother.
I'll send for them.
He's coming, he's coming.
What's going on?
You should know better.
Why humiliate yourself?
People like us... we're born small... and we die small.
That's our fate.
Master Ren... my father is sick.
I need some time off.
You told me he was doing well.
Yes, but-- but now he is sick again.
I have to go.
We need new film.
Like this.
Claire?
She's in England.
No. No.
I say... Chinese film.
Local people, local scenes.
- You know?
- Chinese people.
- Chinese film.
- Film.
You're crazy.
Who'd want to see that?
They can walk outside their door and see it anytime they want.
Bloody fantastic.
- We are in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
Local people, local scenes.
Sure.
I can see you fine from here.
Why should I look in there?
Uncle... when this machine looks at you... your image is saved.
In a hundred years, your image will still be there.
I'm 70 now.
That would make me 1 70!
- Right.
- How would I look then?
Exactly as you do now.
You won't have aged a bit.
Say no more. I'm ready.
If you please.
I feel better already. Your turn.
Look at the hole.
Good. Good.
Good.
Good, good, good.
Slow down, will you?
Beautiful. Huh?
- It's a good shot.
- Good.
Beautiful!
I'm overwhelmed.
Love China.
First emperor... build this wall... to defend against... foreign invader.
Like me?
Less dangerous.
China doesn't need more walls.
It needs someone like you to carry this... this magnificence to the outside world.
Just think of it.
You, me... recording life before it changes... show it to the whole world.
Might even go down in history.
Whole world? Huh?
Where?
Where is that?
Liu, leave that photo shop... and become my partner.
The future belongs to the moving picture.
Liu, what is this all about?
I've come... to apologize.
I want to say...
I'm truly sorry, but...
I must continue with Shadow Magic.
I can't help it.
Without Shadow Magic...
I'm nobody.
I know our show hurts the opera.
I'm sorry.
You needn't concern yourself.
You're no competition for my father.
Western culture can't overshadow our opera.
Even if there were
20 Shadow Magics in town... there would be only one Lord Tan.
The people will always love him.
Of course. You are right.
Actually...
I came to see you.
You came to see me?
Why?
Don't you know by now?
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.
I love you and I think you love me too.
You must not speak like this.
We cannot see each other.
But why?
You know why.
Wait!
Just wait and see.
I'm going to make a name for myself!.
Where is Liu?
He's absent again, Master.
Again?
Please, have a seat.
His father must be very ill.
Liu is a good son.
Tell me, why do Chinese people bow?
If I look at your shoes...
I know you're poor... you're rich.
Oh, Liu.
If only all Chinese people were as charming as you are.
All Chinese people are charming like me.
Others as kind as you?
Well, they are when you get to know them.
Good.
Raymond, I must go now.
Too late.
Master Ren will be upset.
- Hang on a sec.
- Huh?
Put a feather in my cap.
Look at this.
- It's from the British envoy.
- What?
"The envoy wishes to entertain
Her Royal Highness... the Empress Dowager--"
Dou Fouai--
- Dou Fouai?
- Yeah.
"with a presentation of Shadow Magic, the latest innovation from the West... at the Royal Palace."
Hah!
How about that?
We're going to the Royal Palace!
Us!
Wait until Claire gets a load of this, then, eh?
I told you I'd amount to something!
Hello, Fu Guan.
Master Ren knows you lied to him.
Your father was never sick.
You haven't been at home.
Wait, I can explain.
I should hope so.
Where have you been all this time?
I was--
No more lies!
I've been making films with the foreigner.
- What did I tell you?
- Please, Master Ren!
I know I betrayed your trust.
I lied to you.
I was wrong.
I beg of you.
I'm not a bad person.
I'll prove to you
I have a loyal heart.
He's trying to sweet-talk you.
We have important work to do.
I don't have time for this.
I'll give you one last chance.
But you must come to your senses... or I will cut you off.
Now, get up.
We have much to do before our visit to the Royal Palace.
The Royal Palace?
We're going to take the empress' picture!
On her birthday!
At the palace!
Isn't that exciting?
Master... please allow me to work for you and Raymond at the same time.
What?
Raymond, the foreigner, and I were also invited... to the Royal Palace to show Shadow Magic.
It's our big chance. Let us do our show first, then I'll assist you.
Please, Master.
Our city is changing every day.
They say the time will come when men will cut off their pigtails... and women will unbind their feet.
We can't turn back the clock.
I want to record life before it changes forever.
So our children will understand us... and the rest of the world will appreciate us.
So many people... are touched by our films.
For the first time...
I feel part of something bigger than myself.
Please, Master Ren.
Let's do this together.
Let's make our own shows... and present them... to the whole world!
You could be like Raymond-- your own master... free from your wife's family.
Please, Master.
- Chang!
- Yes, Master.
You are now my chief photographer.
Tell Liu he is forbidden to return to Feng Tai.
Fu Guan, come here!
Back to work!
Didn't expect you back so soon.
No takers at the photo shop, eh?
Here's the ungrateful little wretch!
Liu! Come with me.
What's the trouble, old man?
You're the trouble!
You've ruined my son's life!
You foreigners have no respect!
No loyalty!
No tradition!
You just want to use us!
And you!
You've brought me nothing but shame!
How could you betray a dear friend like Master Ren... who has been so good to us, and ally yourself with this foreigner?
So he can play his dirty tricks and cheat our people.
I'll tear you apart!
Now you will obey me.
Marry this woman.
Do it!
Apologize to your father.
Say you'll return to Feng Tai.
Please.
Say you'll marry her.
Do it.
You bastard!
You continue to disgrace me.
You are no longer my son!
You can stay with me, Liu.
I've got plenty of clothes.
Hey.
You could be the first moving-picture man in all of China.
Was she your intended?
The widow?
I think you're well out of that one, mate, eh?
Eh?
I think that alone calls for celebration, eh?
Raymond, I can't wear this.
- I feel foolish.
- Come on.
You really don't like my present?
Come on.
No.
Look, Liu, you've got nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing.
Listen, look.
We'll sit in the back, yeah?
That way you can see her and she won't be able to see you.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The foreigner!
How could he appreciate opera?
I can't believe they let him in.
Hey, Liu, are you Chinese or a barbarian?
Traitors don't belong here.
Look at the two of them.
He isn't applauding.
He's insulting Lord Tan!
Well, my friend, this appears not to be such a good idea after all.
Perhaps I'd better leave.
- No, Raymond. We can't leave.
- You stay.
You enjoy the show.
You stay.
Don't shame me more in front of my people.
He's leaving in the middle of the performance!
He should be taught a lesson!
Go away!
Don't touch me!
You devil! You devil!
Because you, I lost everything.
My job, my family, my honor.
The woman I love.
I meet you, it's my downfall!
If you want to quit, go ahead, quit.
I don't need you.
I didn't come halfway around the world to be held back by a coward!
Go ahead! Leave!
It's okay.
Huh? Leave!
Let me tell you something, Liu.
You've changed.
You're not like these other people anymore.
You've got nowhere to go back to!
Wait, wait!
Liu, wait, wait!
I'm sorry, Liu.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
After the private screening... hey, we'll be laughing.
You all listen to me.
I'm the one.
I'm the one who has been invited to the palace!
You think I'm nothing... but I'll show you.
This way, please.
You may begin.
We are very intrigued by the foreigner's technology.
Indeed, Your Benevolent Majesty.
They know how to entertain.
You are right, Your Majesty.
They invented this just for your pleasure.
Shouldn't we be leaving, Master?
She likes me.
Fire! Fire!
- Get away from him!
- What? I'm trying to help!
The barbarian and his accomplice must be punished.
They threatened Her Majesty's life.
What do you suggest?
Execute them.
Lord Tan... you wish to say something?
Please inform Her Majesty...
I believe this young Chinese man meant no harm.
Like so many others in our country... he was led astray by foreign influence... but I believe he can mend the error of his ways.
Small employee.
I'm responsible.
The young man knows some of the foreigner's tricks.
Her Majesty feels he might be useful to us in the future.
You may rise.
Lord Tan, your performance today so pleased Her Majesty... she finds her spirit made forgiving by the beauty of your art.
The young man will be released.
The foreign conspirator... will be expelled from the country.
Thanks to Her Benevolent Majesty!
Guards!
Hey! Liu! Liu!
What's going on?
Where are they taking me?
Long live Her Majesty!
Is there a Liu Jing Lun here?
- I am Liu.
- This package is for you.
From England.
"Dear Liu.
It's hard to believe that one's fate can change in the blink of an eye.
We were parted from each other in flames and smoke... without even being able to say good-bye.
I find myself looking at the ocean between us.
Memories of you bring smiles to my face.
Our Shadow Magic was the one thing in my life that made me feel truly alive.
That is why I need to continue filming.
Wherever I find interesting people... or wherever I see interesting lives...
I want to be there with my camera.
Enclosed are the films we shot in China.
I want you to have them.
Our friendship is preserved in the fond memories of these frames.
My thoughts are with you.
Raymond. "
Why is it blurry, Liu?
I need a lens and I can't afford it.
A lens?
Like eyeglasses... for the projector.
I know what you need.
I'll trade you something that might work.
I'll take a look.
Jewelry Tower!
One night only!
"Shadow Magic Show" at Fu Shou Hall!
Come one! Come all!
Shadow Magic at Fu Shou Hall!
Shadow Magic?
If we wanted to, we could ruin it.
We could ruin nothing.
It will come sooner or later.
This is only the beginning.
Father, can we go?
Liu has not invited us.
Forget about Shadow Magic.
Liu was almost killed.
Crazy!
What am I doing?
What am I trying to prove?
We can't escape what drives us.
Tell me how I'm going to feel this time.
Take a seat and you'll see.
There's Liu.
Father?
You came!
Where are your glasses?
How can you see without your glasses?
I can see what I need to see.
Show me to the front.
Go on, Liu.
- We should leave.
- We might go up in smoke!
I love Shadow Magic.
I'll take the risk.
Wel--Welcome.
Welcome, everyone... to-to Shadow Magic.
Tonight, for the first time... we will see ourselves... the way we are.
We will watch our lives unfold... as we live them every day.
Why put out the lights?
Certain things should be kept in the dark.
I was already in the dark.
Hey! That's me!
Do I look that old?
My camel! That's my camel!
Next should be me!
It is me!
Thrilling!
What do you see?
A man and a camel on a street.
What's so thrilling about that?
Shadow Magic is good for the eyes.
But you can only see it... not hear it.
Your ears feel something's lacking.
Now that you mention it, it does seem that way.
That's why you need us talkative comedians.
We bring the pleasure to your ears.
Shadow Magic has no mercy.
Everything is magnified... larger than life.
- The thin--
- The fat--
- The round--
- Wrinkle upon wrinkle!
- There's nowhere to hide!
- Nope!
Our people know how to be courteous.
- Can't you tell?
- Look!
How are you?
Have you eaten?
Thank you. My pleasure.
Why do we greet each other like this?
It means:
"I've had the pleasure of eating.
If you haven't, come to my house."
- Have you eaten?
- My pleasure!
That's too much eating!
Of course! But eating is the main talent of our civilization!
So true!
Ling! Come in. Please sit.
I want to try.
Here.
Now count evenly.
One, two, three.
My friend Raymond... explained to me--
He said, if we love each other... it's all right to show affection.
I never knew I was so fast!
You're amazing!
That's incredible!
I can't believe my eyes.
Those mountains.
The river-- how it sings.
The horizon-- it seems to extend forever.
That's neat!
My son--
My son did all this!
Ding Jung Shan, the first
Chinese film ever made... was produced at Feng Tai Studio in 1905 by Liu Jing Lun and Ren Jing Feng.
It starred Peking's legendary opera singer Lord Tan Xinpei.
At the turn of the century... a handful of foreigners brought motion pictures to China.
The name of the first Shadow Magic showman remains unknown.

Looking back, it all seems so simple.
We were at war.
The Nazis were the enemy. And because
good must triumph over evil...
... so we would triumph over them.
How could we have known that war
never trades in such certainties?
For where nothing is unthinkable...
... anything can be true.
Even a lie.
- Anvone sitting there?
- No.
For one dreadful moment, I thought it was going to be standing room onlv.
It's all airmen and sappers down back.
Nice enough, but...
- Here, have one of mine.
- I'm all right, thanks.
Sorrv. Cannerlev.
- Richard Cannerlev. How do vou do?
- Charlotte Grav.
So, going home or coming awav?
- I work in London.
- Don't tell me, let me guess.
- You're in the WAAFs?
- I work in a surgerv.
Good for vou.
Whv?
- Risking London for the war effort.
- It's our dutv.
Absolutelv.
I'm a civil servant.
We don't come from anvwhere.
The Germans are spreading the rumor we're not born at all.
You speak French?
Oh, ves.
Ever lived there?
- I studied there.
- In Paris?
Best citv in the world!
Not that vou'd want to live there now.
It's full of Germans.
Can't find anvthing but sauerkraut.
What the Germans have done to France is not a joke.
No.
Of course not.
Clear the doors! Each bag is to be collected bv the exit!
- Cheer up. We'll have a hoot.
- You'll have a hoot.
I'll be talking to some duffer about Tennvson.
- It's just a book launch.
- Books mean booze.
You should be in publishing.
Don't be such a stav-at-home.
You never go out.
I don't care if thev're uglv, as long as thev have nice teeth.
The author.
Excuse me.
- Sorrv.
- Oh, no.
- It's a bit noisv in there.
- Yes.
- Peter Gregorv.
- Charlotte Grav.
Bloodv hell!
These literarv girls...
Sorrv.
Pilot Officer Borowski, Miss Grav.
He's a friend.
Delighted to meet vou, Miss Grav.
All clear.
So...
You're from Scotland?
- Whereabouts?
- Saint Andrews.
Near Edinburgh, lovelv.
Bit different to this, eh?
- You've never been to a ceilidh.
- I have, actuallv.
And ves, it was noisv.
Thev don't serve warm gin either.
I don't know how vou drink it.
- At least I don't water plants with it.
- You weren't meant to see that.
Miss Grav! I thought it was vou.
Good of vou to come.
How do vou do?
Let me introduce vou to some chums.
We're over in the corner.
Morris, meet Miss Grav!
She reads Stendhal in French.
It's one thing to order dinner in the lingo. Quite another...
...to pass vourself off as a waiter.
We're alwavs looking for French speakers. War work of some kind.
- Take me.
- You'd never pass the phvsical.
Thev're trained, but the truth is...
...vou're either fluent or vou're not.
- I suppose.
It's not easv pretending to be French.
It's not just knowing the words.
One's got to want to do it.
One's got to feel stronglv about what the Nazis have done to France.
Excuse me.
I did give vou mv number, didn't I?
- Yes.
- Do call, please.
Bottoms up!
To war.
Hello again.
Hello.
Has that bloodv airman been eating mv rations again?
And mine!
Go on.
That's terrible.
You're not even trving.
Punish me.
I submit!
The invasion plans are in mv wooden leg.
You're here.
I think so.
What would vou sav if I went to France?
Whv? Has someone asked vou?
What for?
To be some sort of agent or courier, I think.
- I'm not sure.
- It's far too dangerous.
- You flv. That's dangerous.
- It's the onlv thing I'm good at.
Do vou mind?
You didn't even sav "ouch."
You're brave. Be proud of it.
- I'm just scared of vou.
- I want to be brave...
...like vou are.
Just be vourself.
If I was mvself, I'd never let vou go.
Do vou believe in fate?
I don't mean fate exactlv, I mean...
...if someone tells vou... If vou have a gift, it's vour dutv to use it.
To go out there. To...
...to be brave.
- Charlotte...
...l'm not brave.
It's just that...
...war makes us into people we didn't know we were.
Look.
I've lost all mv friends.
Everv single one.
Do vou think I feel brave when I'm alive and thev're dead?
It's not braverv...
...it's accident.
Mv leave is up.
When?
Tomorrow.
It's just some ops over France.
It's...
How long?
Three weeks.
I'll be back in London on the 18th.
You'll wait for me here.
- War.
- Peace.
- War.
- Flowers.
France.
Eves closed, please.
- France.
- Love.
- Love.
- IKev.
- Lock.

- Death.
- Old.
Man.
One word onlv.
- Man.
- Bald.
- Man.
- Bald. Sorrv.
Speed it up! Come on!
Good!
Small steps!
Remember what vour mother told vou!
IKeep vour knees and legs together!
France, as vou know, is currentlv divided into two zones.
The northern zone, including Paris, is occupied bv the Germans.
The southern zone...
...or "free zone" is occupied and run bv the French out of Vichv.
Bv collaborating fullv with the Third Reich...
...the Vichv government is allowed to police itself.
And it's here in the free zone that the main Resistance is located.
For those selected few who pass, this is where vou will work.
Once behind enemy lines,
treat everyone with suspicion.
The shopkeeper, the police,
even colleagues in the Resistance.
"Looking forward to our next meeting.
Manv thanks."
As long as vou are transmitting, the Hun can hear vou...
...so save the bloodv chitchat.
Right foot! Again, right foot!
Chest! Left shoulder! Right eve!
The securitv implications are prettv simple.
Should vou be caught and tortured...
...vours, we sincerelv trust, will be the onlv name thev know.
It follows that your greatest
protection will be your cover.
Soon, you'll transform
yourself from who you are now...
... into somebody entirely different.
Please, Mommv, I'm fine.
If a bomb's got mv name on it, a bomb's got mv name on it.
- I'm back.
- I'm not leaving London.
- Oh, Charlotte, hello.
- Bve.
- What's this course vou've been on?
- FANYs. First Aid...
I know what thev are.
Are vou a driver?
Oh, I expect so, ves.
So whv do vou need to go on a course?
I'm not reallv supposed to sav.
You never know who's listening.
Liar.
You can't drive.
Got me.
- Pilot Officer Borowski?
- Yes.
- It's Miss Grav. We met at the partv.
- Oh, Miss Gray.
Yes, I'm looking for Peter.
I was expecting to see him last night.
Oh, right. Peter, yes.
Look, sorry.
We think he went down over France.
But don't give up hope.
You know Peter, he's a fighter.
We should know more in a few days.
Can you call me back?
Miss Gray, are you all right?
Why is your name down for France?
Only one in three come back.
I want to help win the war.
And being a courier in France is glamorous?
- I'd be prettv sillv to think that.
- A lot of women do.
Is there something wrong with that?
Your father fought in the Great War, is that right?
Would vou sav vou're trving to impress him?
Whv should I?
But vour father introduced vou to France.
- Took vou to visit the war graves?
- Yes.
- And vour mother?
- I don't see whv...
...vou're asking questions when vou know the answers.
Do vou find it easv to form attachments?
- On average.
- Have vou ever been in love?
Yes, I have.
Of these, which, in vour view, is the most important:
Faith, hope or love?
Hope.
On the double! Chop-chop!
Look livelv! Come on!
Come on, now, girls!
Last one eats a lemon!
Come on, ladies!
This is the finish line!
- Miss Gray? I've got news of Peter.
- You have?
They made radio contact last night.
Where was this?
- I'm not really...
- Please. I promise I won't sav.
All right, listen.
It's a place called Gillesse.
- Don't tell anyone I told...
- I understand.
- Lf this got out...
- No, I understand.
- Thank vou so much for telling me.
- All right.
Thank vou.

Jewish race. Husband's photo...
...and friends'.
Lipstick. Sanitarv towels, French.

For vour English contact...
...Mirabel.
- Mirabel.
Cvanide pill.
Come along.
I've a handover for vou.
Some radio valves.
Meet vour contact at the Cafe du Sport...
...Thursdav morning, 10:00.
She'll wear a blue coat and ask vou how the weather is in Paris.
Tell her it's not bad for the time of vear.
It's a bit English, I know, but it helps to remember.
- You've done well.
- Thank vou.
No, reallv.
Main thing is, don't panic.
It's just a test. To get vou started.
You'll hardlv know vou were gone.
Always remember who you are not.
From the moment you leave
to the moment you're back...
... you are Dominique Guilbert
from Paris.
Can vou believe it?
Thev told me to get some sleep.
You've come south seeking work
while your husband is a POW.
You have no children,
no view on the Vichy government.
You simply want to survive the war.
From this moment on,
Charlotte Gray is dead.
What is it?
Germans.
Help!
Mama!
Come on, quick!
Jacob, wait!
- Drink?
- Thank vou.
All right?
Yes.

What lights?
I was mistaken.
Thank vou.

Welcome to France, Dominique.

Idiot.

- Don't forget this, madame.

- No. Thank vou.
You know this man?

We're onlv told what we need to know.
How much do thev tell vou about us?
We're Communists.
Did thev tell vou this?
- No.
- It bothers vou.
Whv should it?
You're all Gaullists in London.
You send weapons because...
...south of Limoges, we're all vou have. But after the war, vou wait.
- We're going to change things here.
- Might be an idea to win first.
This is the contact point.
You ask for Octave.
Otherwise...
...we don't know each other.
- Fine.
Thank vou for coming.
It is appreciated.
Mama? Papa?
Wait for me!
- Do vou think she was an angel?
- Who?
The ladv from the skv.
- I don't think so.
- She could be, vou don't know.
Thev've been undermining us for vears.
IKeeping the best jobs for themselves.
The dav thev said no Jew should be a teacher was a special dav for us.
I didn't know the father was one of them. He seemed nice to me.
No, he's seeing somebodv else.
I told her.
Number, please. Connecting vou.
Order cakes from Madame Galliot, savories from Albert.
Anvthing else could be horsemeat.
Number, please. Connecting vou.

Don't give them to me. I'm being followed. Stav a moment, then leave.
Wait! I don't have much time.
- I have a friend in Gillesse. Do vou...?
- I don't know.
Ask vour C.O. I have to go.
Excuse me, gentlemen, ladies.
Your papers, please.
Papers?
Give them to me. Under the table.
Quick!

How's business?
The cold doesn't help.
- I'll be glad when it's summer.
- You and the rest of us.
Morning, madame. Papers, please.
Stand, please.
Emptv vour pockets.

The one with the lovelv smile.
Evervthing all right, monsieur?
Oh, fine. Thank vou, Sophie.

We must do something. I had a meeting with her and the police took her awav!
- See, there was an I.D. Check...
- Wait! One moment, please.
- What woman?
- It was a handover.
- She needed valves. Thev searched her.

And?
Thev asked her what thev were for and took her awav.
- Thev didn't ask for vou?
- No.
- What will thev do with her?
- Who saw vou together?
- The barman spoke to me.
- He's all right. Anvone else?
I don't know.
It all happened verv fast.
- How was she caught?
- Thev followed her.
And she came into the cafe?
She was trving to warn me.
That takes a second.
We talked for a moment.
She shouldn't have come in.
- She was worried thev'd trv to stop me.
- You don't...
...talk.
- What will thev do to her?
- I don't know.
Anvwav, there's nothing we can do now.
Whv not go to vour English contact?
Because he hasn't shown up vet.
- You have a code for meeting?
- Yes!
I'm sorrv. I should go.
No, no!
Wait. You need a new cover.
Mv father lives outside Lezignac, he rents rooms.
If anvone asks, sav vou're a friend of mine from Paris.
You're from Paris?
Before the war, ves.
Wait here an hour.
I'll talk to mv father.
When vou leave, ask directions for Le Domaine.
Sav vou are the new housekeeper.
Word spreads fast here.
Two Jewish bovs are there.
Their parents are missing. You help.
If I'm to stav with vour father, shouldn't I know vour real name?
Julien.
Excuse me.
Monsieur.
I'm Madame Guilbert.
- Your son...
- I know. He told me. I'm Levade.
You can start bv giving the bovs a bath. Thev stink.
Door's open.
Hello?
Hello?
Mama?
Shh! Hide!

I work for Monsieur Levade.
He asked me to give vou a bath.
So would vou like me to...?
I'll wait outside.

Housework.
What happened to vour towels?
We're going home!
No, wait, please.
You're soaked. Here.
Drv vourselves.
We're going home.
Monsieur Levade isn't nice.
- I don't like him either.
- I'm sure he's...
Where are our parents?
I'm sure thev wouldn't want vou getting cold. Would thev?
Here vou go.
The bovs are all right?
Thev're in bed.
Thev were asking about their mother.
Have vou found out what happened?
Thev were arrested vesterdav evening bv our police.
Thev've been taken to a holding camp in Drancv.
The reason the bovs weren't picked up is because thev'd sneaked out.
I have a contact there.
He's working on their release.
The mother must be going mad.
- It was a mistake to bring them here.
- You, with no room to spare.
- No room good enough for vou.
- He's not used to visitors.
- I have a choice?
- Please, sit.
- Sit!
- Thank vou.
I know Monsieur Duguav.
He lectured in Toulouse.
I did some work for the universitv.
Thev're good bovs.
- You want to eat?
- No, thanks.
Please vourself. It's rabbit stew.
- Do vou like rabbit stew?
- Verv nice.
She likes it, and she hasn't even tried it.
He thinks I cook like shit.
If vou hear from vour contact, tell me.
Of course.
I'll sav good night to the bovs before I go.
You mav serve now.
- Excuse me, am I on the right...?
- Don't tell me vour name.
- I wasn't...
- Twelve weeks of training.
First thing thev do is tell me their names.
Let's get this done quicklv.
The Germans use the main line to transport munitions and vehicles.
There's a train through Lezignac
Mondav, 1:30.
Mainlv wagons, bolsters for tanks and artillerv pieces. Got that?
Right.
So I pass that on to Octave.
Who do vou think vou pass it to?
The gendarmerie?
I was just... Sorrv.
I met a contact in town, code name
Francoise. She's been taken awav.
- Do vou know what's happened to her?
- She's dead.
Matter of fact,
I liked her verv much.
She was unluckv. You weren't.
Anvwav, can't afford to get too close.
Now!
Go!
Auguste, is Claire still mad enough to marrv a blind man?
Mv glasses are mv best feature.
- Don't be too proud.
- Onlv from the neck up.
Liar.

Let's go!

Come on! Let's go!
You go with him.
Dominique, here.

Thank vou.
What vou've just done...
Your hands.
It's alwavs a shock the first time.
I tell Julien he'll die fighting the Germans.
The old men, we remember.
- You fought in...

The war loves engineers.
We mend dead machines.
So Julien savs vou're from Paris.
Your husband?
He's a prisoner of war. In Bonn.
Sorrv.
Whv doesn't vour son live with vou?
You don't get on?
Mv son's a Communist.
- And vou?
- I'm not interested in politics.
Whv fight? Whv risk vour life?
For vour countrv.
Nobodv fights for their countrv.
Onlv for their familv.
For someone thev love.
Does it matter?
Depends if vou're on our side.
I'm on vour side.
Yes. I think vou are.
Good morning, madame.
Good morning.

Get mine as well. Come on.
Got vou! Got vou, Jacob!

What did Vichv expect? The Germans walk right through when it suits them.
You should be proud.
Thev need an armv to fight vou now.
Thank vou.
- It's nice to see the bovs laughing.
- Yes.
We must be careful.
Do vou have news of their parents?
Nothing vet.
These were mv onlv clean clothes.
- The bovs seem well.
- Thev do!
- You'll contact...
- When I have mv next instructions.
Good.
You did well last night.
I should be Essential Services.
I had a companv in Birmingham.
Supplied parts for Ford.
Fucking war!
Do vou have something for me?
God, I hate this place.
You have no idea.
There's a drop coming. Tomorrow night.
These are the reference points.
Pass them on to vour frogs.
I know places that's a square meal.
I need to...
I need to ask a favor.
- Ask.
- I need to contact a colleague.
I think he's hiding in a safe house in Gillesse.
Your friend's name? What is it?
Peter Gregorv.
- He's a pilot. His plane...
- I'll make inquiries.
- It's verv important.
- I said, I'd make inquiries.
No!
Don't!
Leave me alone!
- Go awav!
- You're all right.
You're all right now.
You're just dreaming. It's a dream.
Jacob thinks vou're an angel because vou fell out of the skv. Is it true?
No.
- Is it all mv fault?
- What?
- That Mama and Papa went awav.
- No.
No, it's not vour fault at all.
It's the war.
- Will thev be all right?
- Yes, thev're going to be fine.
Monsieur Forav, disappeared!
Francoise Guilleme, disappeared!
Philippe Le Gentil, disappeared!
Jean Sauvier, disappeared!
Martine Perrault, disappeared!
Monsieur and Madame Duguav, disappeared!
Claire Ribiere, disappeared!
- Julien!

Robert Daladier, disappeared!
Pierre Rousse, disappeared!
Pierre Vallat, disappeared!
Julien!
We have to go!
Shut up!
Robert Daladier, disap...
We have to go, do vou understand?
- We got news of the bovs' parents.
- Good?
Thev've been moved to Poland.
What...? To another work camp?
I don't know.
- I'm sorrv vou had to come out to me.
- I work for vour father.
We're bound to know each other.
- What'll we tell the bovs?
- Nothing, vet.
I spoke to one of the gendarmes who took them awav.
He said he'd let the mother write a note, but...
...she took too long.
He had to go.
- The note was lost in the rush.
- Oh, God.
You spoke to vour contact?
- Yes.
- And?
- Drop's confirmed.
- I'll meet vou at the crossroads at 7.
I found this pushed under the front door. For vou.
Thank vou.
- Good news?
- Mavbe.
I don't know.
I have to go out.
Tell Julien, if he calls,
I'll meet him.
- I'll be as quick as I can.
- Don't forget curfew!
Papa, come on, quick.
Bve, Mama.
Shit!
Shit! Bloodv bike!
Need to pee!
Jesus!
God, that is good!
Oh, God, that is so good!
His aircraft.
What...?
- Where's Julien?
- He should be here bv now.
Reverse L, quicklv!
Jean-Paul. Claire!
On!
His papers were found near the bodv.
I shouldn't be here.
I should be in Birmingham.
This isn't me.
A few davs, vou'll be home, love.
You don't want to stav here.
People are betraving their neighbors to the Gestapo for being too noisv.
Nobodv's ordinarv now.
I'll make contact before vour plane comes.
Don't go out unless vou have to.
Dominique, I'm hungrv.
Plates, please, Andre.
- There's no jam. I want jam.
- This isn't a hotel.
- Mama alwavs has jam.
- I am not vour bloodv mama!
Eat up!
Come.
- I shouldn't have frightened them.
- Thev'll get over it.
But what'll I sav?
How will thev ever trust me again?
Thev will.
Children can forgive almost anvthing.
- Well, whv can't Julien forgive vou?
- Do vou think he's so angrv?
It's just sad, the wav the past holds on to vou.
Mv son's angrv because I'm all he's got. His mother died when he was 3.
I was a shittv father.
Too interested in work. Girls.
And now?
I'm too old for self-deception.
I am what I am.
Mv onlv shame is, I lived long enough to see mv countrv betrav itself.
Julien!
Take the bovs inside!
Come, quick!
- What are vou doing? Let go!
- You told them!
You told the Germans we were coming!
- I swear...
- You told them!
- I told no one!
- Shut up!
- Let go of me!
- I wasn't even there to warn them.
- I was late waiting for vou to come.
- I'm sorrv.
You know how manv thev shot?
Auguste. Claire. All of them!
There was nothing I could do!
I couldn't call out. The Germans...
I just watched! I just watched!
I couldn't...
Where were vou?
I had to report to mv contact.
I didn't have time to tell vou.
I swear I spoke to no one.
The onlv person who knew the coordinates was vou.
I swear.
Well, somebodv told them.
Thev knew the exact location.
Which field, which road.
Thev had map references down to the last tree.
She's telling the truth.
She was called awav. I saw the note.
She wouldn't do that.
Face the wall.
- These are vour papers?
- Yes.
This card shows vou crossed the demarcation line illegallv last vear.
The stamp is wrong.
In the car, please.
As a teacher, I see evervone.
Children, parents, grandparents.
There's nobodv I don't know.
Here.
We need to talk.
Sorrv.
Outside.
Where did the map references come from?
Don't approach me in public.
I'm keen on staving alive.
Thev were leaked.
- What are vou talking about?
- Thev were leaked.
The Germans knew. We had no chance.
It's nothing to do with me.
I just sav what I'm told to.
- Then how did thev find out?
- Who knows?
- Did vou know what would happen?
- Of course not!
I just follow instructions.
Whose instructions? London's?
London knows evervthing.
I'm onlv here for dodging import tax.
Mv mother was French.
It was this or the nick. Mv mistake.
When did vou first meet them?
Did vou approach them?
Thev approached vou, right?
Right. Where was it?
In a bar? On a train?
Were vou told to get me awav from there?
Were vou?
The Boches have come south to protect the coast.
North Africa's a goner.
Thev're losing. Evervone knows that.
London, the French.
Things change.
We're not just fighting the Germans.
You're saving thev'd do all this to get six little Communists?
You want to know who told the Germans?
It could've been half a dozen people.
An intercept. Someone in London.
Mavbe me. Mavbe vou.
If I was in vour position, I'd keep mv knickers on and mv trap shut.
Are vou gathering mv gist?
I think I understand vou.
Anvwav, vou're out of here.
Wednesdav, 0215.
Same place vou dropped in.
Even vou should remember that.
You stav here, vou're on vour own.
Could I help vou?
Forgive me. I'm Monsieur Renech.
You're wondering whv I'm here.
You see...
...l've been watching vou for some time.
It's childish, I know.
But vou are a beautiful woman.
What do vou want?
I felt it was mv dutv to warn vou.
- Warn me?
- A man from Paris arrived vesterdav...
...to help the Germans fulfill their Jewish quota.
I was fortunate, as a senior figure in Lezignac...
...to meet with this man.
He tells me that the Vichv government...
...has issued instructions on the deportation of Jewish children.
- Whv are vou telling me this?
- Your friend Julien...
...has the Duguav bovs in the house.
I heard them.
- Who told vou to come here?
- No, please.
Nobodv knows I'm here.
I came because...
...I want to be vour friend.
- I have to go.
- No, wait! Please, madame.
Wait! Stop!
Stop!
Turn, please.
No need for rudeness. I'm an important man. I speak to important people.
So vou will be mv friend...
...and the bovs will be safe.
IKiss me.
Tomorrow. I'm dirtv down there. We'll be together tomorrow, when I'm clean.
- Lf vou trv to leave, I'll kill vou.
- Tomorrow.
You will come. I know manv people.
You understand? Manv people.
I understand.
- Is anvone following?
- I don't think so.
- We should have warned Julien.
- Thev'll be watching him.
- Ah, madame.
- Is evervthing all right?
- Come on.
- Out vou get.
Come. I have some little babv kittens.
Thev were born two davs ago!
Bed's home!
Got vou!
I've won.
Dominique!
I have to go.
Listen carefullv, both of vou.
I need vou to stav here, in the attic.
It's important not to go downstairs unless Madame Cariteau takes vou.
Do vou understand?
What about eating?
Madame will give vou vour food,
Monsieur Jam.
I just need vou to stav here.
And trv not to make too much noise.
- Whv can't vou stav?
- Yes, stav.
It's safer this wav, sweetheart.
I'll be back tomorrow.
No fighting.
Could we stop a moment, please?
Do vou think it's possible for a person to commit a crime...
...without knowing it?
- No.
Thev can be part of it, but thev can't be responsible.
To be responsible, vou must know what vou do.
Could vou forgive vourself...
...if vou'd been part of something terrible but didn't know?
Yes, of course.
Otherwise, what use am I to anvone?
I don't think I know what I'm doing here anvmore.
- You moved the bovs?
- Yes.
- Thev're safe?
- For the moment.
You want some soup?
It's still warm.
- Where's Dominique?
- She went to rest.
Thanks for watching the bovs.
It's not easv.
All children are a pain in the ass.
I knew that alreadv.
Eat.
That's alwavs vour solution.
To eat.
Stav here tonight. You're tired.
Who is it?
Pichon.
We are from the mairie.
We'd like a word with vou.
Some gentlemen are here.
Put chairs out in the dining room.
Monsieur?
I'm sorrv about the dampness.
We never use this room.
Would vou like something to drink?
Sit down, monsieur.
Monsieur Levade.
Mv name is Paul Pichon.
I work for the Inquirv and Control section of the Vichv government.
- Verv distinguished-sounding.
- We've taken over some functions...
...of the police for Jewish affairs.
Last month, our government carried out a census...
...of all known Jews in the free zone.
Your name does not appear on it.
Do vou have a certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race?
- Whv...?
- Your papers, please.
- Sorrv?
- Your documentation.
Your identitv card, ration card, work permit, if vou please.
- Evervthing?
- Evervthing, please.
Let me tell vou something about collaboration.
The aim of collaboration is, and alwavs has been...
...to safeguard the independence of French citizens.
It is our sincere belief that bv cooperating with the occupier...
...we offer France the greatest chance of fulfilling her destinv.
Indeed, I'd sav there is no greater act of patriotism than to collaborate.
- These papers aren't properlv stamped.
- I don't understand.
All relevant papers must be stamped "Jew."
- You know that!
- I know nothing about these things.
You didn't bring these people here about papers.
Excuse me? And vou are?
- He's mv...
- I'm his son.
Ah, ves, the son. Sit down.
According to our records, M. Levade's heritage mav not be entirelv French.
For this inquirv, we need to establish the origin of his grandparents.
- Thev were French.
- That's irrelevant!
How is it irrelevant?
He's French. I'm French.
- How French are vou?
- Julien!
He fought at Verdun.
Four vears in a trench.
No one questioned him then.
Monsieur, I mav be of help if...
Sure.
Julien?
A word with vou?
Julien!
Get on with it.
I know all about the Duguav bovs.
You've just moved them, haven't vou?
It's a teacher's business to know the whereabouts of his pupils. Is it not?
So vou see, we have a problem.
Monsieur Pichon has to fulfill his quota.
And to do so, he must either take vour father...
...or the bovs.
Of course, he doesn't know that vet.
It's up to vou.
Do vou need a moment to think?
I understand.
You have something to sav?
His grandparents were Jewish.
And if that makes mv father a Jew...
...then I'm Jewish too.
Actuallv, no.
According to current regulations, vou are onlv 1/8 Jewish...
...and therefore not a Jew.
However, we do have certain matters to discuss with vou.
I'd be obliged if vou'd stav in the house. The old man, please.
Don't let him go like that.
He needs clothes.
Quicklv.
Monsieur, please.
It's all right.
I haven't forgotten.
Here are vour clean clothes.
Julien.
We need to get to the bovs before Renech.
- Julien, we have to get out of here!
- What do vou suggest?
That I tell them I'm suddenlv...
...feeling more Jewish than mv father?
- You did the onlv thing vou could.
- For what?
For two bovs that will probablv die anvwav.
So do vou suggest we give up?
Whv did vou come here?
For France, dutv, I don't know.
I felt...
There was a man I loved.
You joined up for him?
Yes.
- What happened?
- He died.
- Oh, I'm sorrv.
- Whv should vou be?
Well, vou loved him.
We shouldn't talk like this.
It's not safe.
Your father, he's a good man.
He'll understand vou had no choice.
No, he won't.
IKiss me.
Come closer.
Hev!
Unbutton mv blouse.
Hev!
- Run!
- At the church!
Wake up. There's someone downstairs.
Listen.
There's nothing up there.
No! There's nothing!
Leave them alone.
Leave them alone! You bastards!
Leave them alone!
No!
- Andre! Jacob!
- Dominique!
I'll find vou!
- See vou soon.
- Yes, indeed, I hope so. Thank vou.
Good evening, little ones.
Mv humble abode.
Would vou care for a nightcap?
Thank vou.
- Such a prettv part of town.
- A little ricketv, but I like it.
Wait.
I was too late.
Thev're being taken awav bv train.
That was all I could find out.
For God's sake, sav something!
- We have to leave.
- No!
Dominique.
Renech's dead. I was seen.
There's nothing more to do.
- I'm not leaving.
- Think. Thev'll kill vou.
You want that? No?
Then leave with me.
We have a driver to take us to Toulouse. Then, the Pvrenees.
- Dominique...
- I am not leaving.
Listen to me.
If vou stav now, vou'll die.
And before vou die, thev'll torture vou. Then vou'll talk.
- You think that will help us to win?
- How can vou sav that to me?
- What, vou want to kill vourself?
- No.
Whv?
You can't stand to be alive when others are condemned to death?
You think it doesn't hurt to see mv father taken?
To know I can't help him or sav sorrv to him?
You think that does not hurt?
There's nothing I can do.
That's the truth now.
Except survive! That's how it is.
It's not enough!
- Dominique.
- It can't be enough.
- You did vour best!
- Don't sav that!
Mv best?
How dare vou sav that to me?
You don't know what I've done.
You don't know who I am.
You don't even know mv name.
Yes!
I have to do something.
There must be something to set against all this.
You have to go.
I'm sorrv. I'll be all right.
I'll use mv contact.
Please, go!
Now, for vour father's sake. Go!
Go!
Police! Open up!
Open up!
Check upstairs.
Yes?
Nothing.
Monsieur, please.
Hev, no baggage.
Andre! Jacob!
Andre! Jacob!
Jacob!
Duguav?
- Dominique!
- Dominique!
Jacob!
Dominique!
- Andre!
- In here!
Monsieur Levade.
Monsieur Levade! Here.
I have a letter.
From the bovs' mother.
Take it!
"Mv dearest little ones:
I hope that someone is reading vou this letter.
Papa and I are fine and well.
I'm sorrv I was not able to sav goodbve or write to vou earlier...
...but we had to leave so quicklv, and I've been working hard ever since.
We are doing war work in Germanv.
When it's all over, we will return.
But in the meantime, vou must be strong and look after each other.
Eat well, as well as vou can.
Even if sometimes vou don't feel like it.
Trv not to squabble.
And if vou go out anvwhere,
I want vou alwavs to hold hands.
Like vou do when vou cross the road.
We embrace vou with all our hearts.
Your loving Mama and Papa."
He was killed in North Africa...
If vou go through there...
...vou'll see the ladv from the Red Cross. Thank vou. Next?
- Mrs. Baxter, how manv dependents?
- Three.
Four.
Now, see that chap in Housing?
- He'll fix vou up with something.
- Thank vou, miss.
You coming to the pictures?
It's I Walked With a Zombie.
No, thanks.
- Tom Conwav's in it.
- I'll get an earlv night.
Suit vourself.
This came for vou this morning.
- You all right? You look peakv to me.
- Daisv.
I've gone, I've gone.
Have fun.
You got mv letter?
Yes, of course vou did.
I'm sorrv to spring it on vou.
It was a bit trickv getting awav.
How long have vou been in England?
A couple of months.
I wasn't too good when I got back.
Thev...
...told me vou were dead.
- I thought I was.
No, thev showed me photos.
There was a bodv.
It was the navigator.
I was kept hidden. Thev couldn't move me. I was going crazv.
- You all right?
- Yes. I'm sorrv, I just...
I can't quite...
It's good vou got back.
What about vou? What happened to vou?
I went to France.
See, vou never could persuade me not to go.
Whv did vou?
I think I thought I could find vou.
- Oh, Peter.
- What happened?
- Charlotte?
- You were right about war.
It makes fools of us all.
The rest, it kills.
Takes evervone time to recover.
The whole thing is such a bloodv mess.
You know...
...I never stopped thinking about vou.
We could go awav somewhere. Anvwhere.
- Peter.
- I'm due leave, we...
I can't go back.
I'm sorrv.
I wish vou'd listened.
Then I wouldn't have been mvself.
Hello.
Hello.
I didn't think...
No.
There's something I've been meaning to tell vou.
What?
Mv name...
...is Charlotte Grav.
IANNIS: How long have you been deaf in this ear?
STAMATIS: Since as long as I can remember.
-[Snip]
-Ow!
MRS STAMATIS: Shut up!
Keep still while the doctor is examining you.
IANNIS: I need a fish-hook... about the right size for a mullet... with a long shank, and a hammer.
STAMATIS:
A fish-hook? A hammer?
MRS STAMATIS:
Here's a fish-hook... and a hammer.
IANNIS: Ahem.
[Tapping]
Right. Now keep still.
[Pop]
STAMATIS: Ow!
IANNIS: A pea.
It is very papilionaceous, is it not?
He must have stuck it in his ear when he was a child.
Oh, my God, it's loud.
I mean, everything is loud.
My own voice is loud.
Your deafness is cured.
A very satisfactory operation.
I've had an operation?
Ha! I'm the only person I know who's had an operation.
It feels as if my whole head... has filled up with spring water, all cold and clear.
Talk some sense when the doctor... has been kind enough to cure you.
All these years thinking you are deaf.
But now there will be no excuses when I ask you to remember... to collect something on your way home.
Or to stoke up the fire before we go to church.
[Bell ringing]
MRS STAMATIS: Perhaps now you will hear me... when I say to you,
"Mend the chair, Stamatis.
"Fix the leaking roof,
Stamatis. "
And now I won't have to speak so loud...
IANNIS: Antonio, do you remember our island?
It does not change.
On the feast day of Saint Gerasimos... we still bring our sick to the holy place... and pray that their suffering may cease.
When Pelagia was a child,
I promised her... that I would write a history of Cephallonia... but somehow I still have not found the time.
I wanted her to understand how a land so peaceful... could be shattered by earthquakes and war.
I wanted her to understand... why sometimes the gods bless us... and why they sometimes become angry... and shake us, and fill our lives with pain.
I want her to learn the lesson that nature teaches us.
That we should not ask why we are wounded... only if the wound can be healed.
[Speaking Greek]
[Praying in Greek]
A purely psychological phenomenon.
STAMATIS: How do you explain the miracle?
Can Lenin cure the mad?
Can Stalin heal the afflicted?
It's obvious.
It's a set-up!
To keep people enslaved to religion.
You don't have to shout.
I'm not deaf.
[Cheering]
[Greek music playing]
I want to see the cannon again.
-Yeah!
-Cannon!
All right.
I will need stones from the street.
As many as you can find.
Be right back.
VELISARIOS: Ready, children?
Cover your ears.
[Cheering]
[Yelling]
Ow, that hurts!
Oh, that hurts!
VELISARIOS: Will he die?
Eventually, one of these days, like all of us.
Turn over.
-Aah!
-Good, strong gluteals.
-Pelagia.
-Hmm?
Tell us about the gluteals.
Please, come closer.
Have a good look.
Fetch your friends.
Everybody's welcome.
Gluteals.
Maximus, medius, minimus.
The maximus is the external surface of the ilium... between anterior and interior gluteal lines...
DROSOULA: Mandras!
Iatre...
He'll be fine.
They told me you were shot.
I thought I was going to die.
I don't know why you can't keep out of trouble!
I don't know!
Iatre, you should count yourself lucky you don't have a son.
Boys, they never grow up.
Look at me.
Old before my time.
MANDRAS: Aah! Aah!
[Speaking Greek]
It's too hot.
The fish are all hiding in the rocks... or keeping cool at the bottom of the sea.
Aah! No, Mandras!
[Laughing] Aah!
No! Put me down! Put me down!
-Waah!
-Aah!
-Whoo!
-Aah!
[Laughing]
Ha ha! that a Greek battleship, the Eli... has been torpedoed by an Italian submarine... despite the fact that Greece is not yet involved in the war.
Prime Minister Metaxas has protested strongly... to Mussolini's government in Rome... which has denied responsibility for the attack.
And there are continued reports of fighting... between Greek and Italian soldiers... on the Greek-Albanian border.
But in Athens this morning... the Italian ambassador once again denied...
What are they saying?
The Italians are in Albania, close to the border.
They have reported some fighting.
There! You hear that?
They are saying they are not about to declare war.
There. What did I say?
They want to catch us sleeping.
They want to creep up on us in the dead of night!
-You filthy liar!
-Your father was a goat!
Shut up!
If you two don't stop trading insults...
I'm going to start taking coffee at home.
[Footsteps]
PELAGIA:
Mandras wants to marry me.
I told him he'd have to ask you.
IANNIS:
I don't want to marry him.
You don't like him.
You are both too young.
Everyone is too young when they marry.
I have often thought that you would... only ever be able to marry happily... with a foreigner.
BOTH: A dentist from Norway...
...or something.
Mandras is not your equal, and he would expect... to be better than his wife.
He is a man, after all.
I will tell you now what I will say to him.
I am not giving away a dowry.
Who marries without a dowry?
You should marry for love.
I love Mandras.
So what am I supposed to do?
Go off to Mandras' mother's house... with nothing but a bag of clothes?
Oh, and my goat.
I'll never be able to show my face.
I'll be the laughing stock of Cephallonia.
You can imagine how people will talk.
I don't know how you will bear the shame.
There is going to be a war.
Terrible things happen in wars.
Use this to defend yourself.
And, if necessary, use it against yourself.
Your marriage will have to wait.
I look around me.
I see fishermen.
I see farmers.
I see strong, healthy men who are born free.
But today your freedom is in danger.
The Italian Army sweeps through Albania... and her troops get ready to cross the frontiers of Greece.
Exo Mussolini!
CROWD: Exo Mussolini!
OFFICER: If you care about your country... then you must fight to defend her.
Join the war in Albania.
Fight for your mothers, your sweethearts... your wives, your children.
Fight for the freedom for all Greek people... to live their lives with dignity and respect!
[Shouting in Greek]
[Priest speaking Greek]
MANDRAS: When I come back from the war... we will get married.
And I will build a house for Pelagia... on the land that belonged to my father.
[Priest speaking Greek]
[Singing in Greek]
I know we are different.
I don't know about the world.
Where have I been?
What could I know?
I don't know how to say what I feel inside.
I don't know how to tell you... what is in here.
But I think...
I know...Pelagia...
I love you.
[Cheering]
Tomorrow I leave for the war.
Pelagia, come and dance with me.
[Laughter]
[Yelling in Greek]
[Bell ringing]
I'll write. I promise.
And promise that you will write to me.
[Speaking Greek]
PELAGIA: "My darling, you have not written...
"since that day I saw you off.
"And I am so terrified...
"that I am not getting any letters from you...
"because you have been wounded or taken prisoner.
"And I have nightmares that you are dead. "
"Summer has turned to winter...
"and I am writing my hundredth letter to you.
"The wounded who have returned...
"bring news of terrible conditions.
"Freezing cold, no food.
"But they bring no news from you. "
"Every day I wait for the mail from Argostoli...
"and every day there is nothing.
"And I feel as if I am going mad...
"with worry and fear.
I try not to lose hope...
"but I long to feel something, even if it is only pain. "
[Speaking Greek]
[Sobbing]
We won!
We won!
It's over!
We've beaten them in Albania.
Look!
8,000 of us against 14,000 Italians... and we forced them to withdraw.
What?
Hitler will never let his lapdog be humiliated.
He will come to Mussolini's aid.
PELAGIA: "I have written this letter a dozen times...
"and a dozen times
I have thrown it away.
"I don't know how to describe my feelings.
"It's as if I've been waiting a hundred years...
"to hear from you.
"Waiting a hundred years for you to return. "
Pelagia?
This is hopeless.
It's all wrong!
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:
Following the great defeat... of the Italians in Albania...
Hitler's bombers have counterattacked... and the German Army has driven a path... through to the Greek capital, Athens.
A large number of Greek ships were destroyed... in the bombing of the nearby
Port of Piraeus.
On April 27, the Athenian
Military Commissioner...
General Calvacos, officially handed over the keys... of the ancient city to his German counterpart...
Lieutenant Colonel
Von Zephyr... and preparations are underway... for a carve-up of the territory.
Hitler retains direct control... of much of northern Greece, including Salonica... and the southern island of Crete.
The rest of Greece will be under the control... of Hitler's ally, Mussolini... though the Germans will retain the final authority.
[Men shouting]
Bella bambina at two o'clock!
[Speaking Italian]
[Pounding on door]
Captain Corelli.
Ahem.
"Fuck off."
[Laughter]
Have him tell the mayor that unless we receive... the surrender of the town's authorities in five minutes... we'll mobilise our troops and storm the building.
The mayor says if you don't know what "fuck off" means... then come inside and we'll show you.
[Speaking Italian]
"We refuse to surrender to a nation...
"that we have defeated in Albania...
"and we reserve the right to surrender...
"to a German officer of significant rank.
"So fuck off."
Who is this? Who are you?
-[Clicks heels]
-Captain Gunter Weber.
Liaison officer with the Grenadiers at Lixouri.
"Captain" is not what we would call a significant rank.
CORELLI:
There are only 200 Germans... on the island, and Captain Weber... is the highest ranking officer amongst them.
[Speaking softly in Greek]
Our decision is that surrendering... to Captain Weber's dog is more appropriate... than surrendering to an Italian.
[Singing Verdi's "Anvil Chorus" in Italian]
ALL: Chi del gitano i giorni abbella
Chi del gitano i giorni abbella
Chi i giorni abbella
Carlo Guercio reporting for duty, sir.
-Carlo, where have you served?
-Albania.
Albania?
None of us have seen any action yet.
I was with the Julia Division.
Ah.
Then you have fought enough for all of us.
Carlo, can you sing?
Let's hear you sing.
O mio babbino, caro
Mi piace bello
Bello
No matter.
Everyone in our battery is a member of the opera society.
These are the rules of engagement.
One, all those called to regular musical fatigues... shall be obliged to play a musical instrument.
Uh, spoons, the helmet... comb, paper, and so on, and so on.
Two, anyone who says... that Donizetti is better than Verdi shall be required to sing "Funiculi Funicula" and other songs about railways.
Three, um... three, um...ah.
This is an outrage!
Quite impossible.
It's out of the question.
Sir, the fact is,
I'm sorry to say... and with great regret, that my orders are... to billet an officer in your home.
I am a doctor.
This is my surgery.
I don't have room for guests!
-Sir, these are my orders!
-I don't care!
I don't recognise your authority!
Wait a minute.
What is wrong with your feet?
I have terrible corns.
My boots are killing me.
You are a quartermaster.
You must have access to medical supplies.
To treat your corns,
I will need morphine... hypodermic syringes, sulphur ointment... surgical spirit, neosalvarsan.
Iodine, scalpels, cullodian... bandages, lint.
Perhaps your officer could bring supplies... when he comes.
My father is not here.
He'll be home this evening.
You don't even know who I am.
Mandras?
I walked all the way... from Epirus.
No boots.
I wrote to you every day.
A hundred letters.
And not a single reply.
I never learned... to read or write.
Oh, Lord, what a stench.
It's worse than pigs.
You see, Pelagia, what a state these men get into... when there are no women to look after them.
And I don't care if he's been to war.
If we catch his fleas and lice,
I'm going to skin him alive.
Ammonia, oil of sassafras, and zinc for scabies.
You're a woman and-- and you know so many things.
At least you can see what you are getting.
Not much of a bargain, is he?
You fall in love with the person, not the body.
Love enters by the eyes and also leaves by the eyes.
Take it from me.
We beat the Italians.
We had them running.
[Panting]
But we couldn't fight the Germans.
IANNIS: If I could cook...
I would exchange jobs with you.
In fact, I might retire.
CORELLI: Bella bambina!
Forgive me. Forgive me.
I don't mean to embarrass you.
I'm Captain Antonio Corelli... and that man is one of our heroes.
He has a hundred medals for saving life... and none for taking it.
A brave Italian is a freak of nature.
Said like a true Greek patriot.
Captain Corelli?
I want a word with you. Now.
I want an explanation.
I want to know why you have defaced the monument.
What monument?
You have changed the inscription to Latin.
Do you think you can so easily erase our history?
Is this how you wage war?
By the chipping away of letters?
I must protest.
You cannot protest.
There is no excuse.
I was about to protest because
I was not responsible for it.
Pathetic.
If you could tell me where I'm going to sleep...
In my daughter's room.
But where will your daughter sleep?
It's none of your business where I sleep.
Ah. Tonight I'll sleep in the yard.
Tomorrow I'll request alternative accommodation.
I have made an arrangement with your quartermaster.
You are staying here whether you like it or not.
But your daughter's bed,
I feel it would not be--
I don't care how you feel.
That is not my problem.
I am not the aggressor.
You understand me?
This is very good.
This is Cephallonian meat pie.
Except that, thanks to you people... it doesn't have any meat in it.
I could bring some food.
A little wine, perhaps some panettone.
We don't accept food from the enemy.
Maybe a little panettone.
I am going for a walk.
The curfew starts in one hour's time.
I was born here.
This is my island.
Aren't you going to go and arrest him?
He's defying you, ignoring the curfew.
You're absolutely right.
Quick, get the gun.
Somebody shoot him, shoot him.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Armare!
[Men yelling]
Direzione uno-tre-due.
Alto uno-zèro-cinque.
Capitano Antonio Corelli.
Now you try.
Capitano Antonio Corelli.
PELAGIA: Lemoni!
Babibaba Finono Kalikali.
CORELLI: Oh, what? Babibaba?
Ha ha ha! Capitano.
LEMONI: Capitano.
Sì. Antonio.
Lemoni.
LEMONI: Antonio.
-Corelli.
-Go home.
Go on.
You can come back later.
Signorina... in times of war, we have to make the most... of what little innocent pleasure there is.
PELAGIA: "I have started to make a waistcoat for you.
"Eagles and flowers, embroidered with gold thread.
"But I can't seem to get them to match up.
"One flower is much bigger.
"One eagle is in a different place from the other.
"And when I try to make them more even, it gets worse.
"I just can't get it right."
MANDRAS:
You could kill him, you know.
He's the enemy.
You could poison him.
No one would ever know how he died.
Dimitris and Spiros have both left to join the partisans.
They've gone by boat to Patra.
And who knows where from there.
I should be with them.
You're not going anywhere until you are strong again.
Read the last one.
The last letter you wrote before I came home.
"My darling,
I've heard nothing from you...
'for such a long time...
"and I feel desperate and helpless...
"and I am burning my brains with worry.
'Yesterday I wrote you such a long letter...
"that said everything perfectly...
-"and believe it--"
-Listen.
[Trucks rumbling]
Mandras!
MANDRAS: I can't stay here.
[Singing in Italian]
Signorina. Signorina.
You are drunk.
Yes, I confess.
We have been drinking, singing... generally misbehaving.
I thought you were a soldier.
Captain Antonio Corelli,
33rd Regiment, Artillery... reporting for duty!
Is everything a joke to you?
[Sighs]
No. Not everything.
Captain Corelli,
I think this would be... a good time to hear you play the mandolin.
[Tapping]
What on earth are you doing?
I was just about to start.
Well, about time, too,
I should think.
The first 45 1/2 bars are for the orchestra.
"Allegro moderato e grazioso."
You have to imagine the orchestra.
I'm damned if I can sit through all that tapping again.
Just play your part.
CORELLI: If I do that,
I'll start getting confused... about when I'm supposed to come in... and that, in a concert hall, would be a disaster.
I apologise for disrupting the concert.
I apologise to each and every one of you.
To those in the cheapest seats in the gods... to Your Majesties in your royal boxes... draped in your jewellery and your fine furs.
But I'm damned if I can imagine an orchestra.
I am going to bed.
[Playing Hummel's
"Mandolin Concerto"]
MANDRAS: Is this where the captain sleeps?
I was coming to see you.
I'm leaving, Pelagia.
In the morning.
I'll take my boat to Astakos.
-It's not safe.
-I'm a fisherman.
I know those waters like the back of my hand.
I don't want you to go.
If I die,
I won't have died for nothing.
And if I live, I'll walk with my head held high... for the rest of my life, and everyone will say...
"That's Mandras, who fought for his country in the war."
I finished your waistcoat.
Ah.
You can take it now if you want.
Heh heh.
The two sides... they are not the same.
The Italian captain.
[Speaking Greek]
...Albania.
14,000 of you against 8,000 of us.
You could have driven us into the sea.
If it weren't for your
German friends, we would have.
My friends are the men in my battery.
People I grew up with.
People of my home town.
So, what do you think of our island, Captain?
I like your island.
And what do you think of our girls?
Hmm?
What do you think of my Pelagia?
Good-bye, Pelagia.
My beautiful Pelagia.
[Men singing Puccini's
"O Dolci Mani" from "Tosca"]
A bell'opre e pietose
A carezzar fanciulli
A coglier rose
A pregar, giunte
Per le sventure
Dunque in voi
Fatte dall'amore secure
Giustizia le sue sacre armi depose?
Depose
O dolci mani
Mansuete e pure
O mani elette
A bell'opre...
Heil Hitler.
Heil Puccini.
[Laughing]
I saw your party.
I thought I would come and introduce myself.
You mean, you saw the naked women... and want to come and get a closer look.
[Men laughing]
We've met before.
The surrender at the town hall.
You are much better at having parties... than you are at negotiating surrender.
Well, we're Italian.
Famous for singing, eating, making love.
What's your name?
Antonio Corelli. Grazie.
Mmm. Mmm.
You Germans always have the best tobacco, huh?
How many of you are here now?
Approximately 1,200.
Under Colonel Barge.
Here to keep an eye on us.
Doesn't it feel good to have your allies here?
I thought all you Nazis had blond hair.
I come from the Tyrol.
Grew up in the Austrian mountains.
All my family, and my family before them... going back as far as we can remember, have dark hair.
Like Adolf Hilter?
You neglected to tell me your rank.
I am the breve.
Maximilliano here is the semibreve.
He is the minim.
Those boys are the crotchets and the quavers.
Piero here is the semiquaver.
And Carlo is the rest.
The pause between the notes.
In the opera club, we have our own ranking system... but otherwise I am a captain.
33rd Regiment of Artillery.
-Do you sing?
-Oh, no, uh, not really.
Well, maybe, you know.
On my own. In the bath.
Well, have a drink. Be happy.
But just remember... if you ever express admiration for Wagner... you will be shot, without trial... and without leave of appeal.
[Hums]
From the top!
[Men singing in Italian]
-Lemoni...
-[Laughs]
Come on.
[Singing Verdi's "La Donna è Mobile" from "Rigoletto"]
La donna è mobile
Qual piuma al vento
Muta d'accento
[Singing]
CORELLI: Buonasera, signorina
Are you going to shoot me?
PELAGIA: It wasn't loaded.
I've never aimed a gun at anybody.
Never in my life.
CORELLI:
It must be very difficult... for you to have to put up with us.
It must be very difficult... for you to have to live with yourself.
You lie in the sun and swim in the sea... and flirt with your prostitutes.
And there are people I know, people I grew up with... who are fighting for their lives... and dying for what they believe in.
And all you do is sing.
What's there to sing about?
We are in the middle of a war, not an opera house.
And you, you think you are so cultured... with your pasta and your panettone... and your puffed-up opera.
Why don't you take your holiday on somebody else's island?
What is there to sing about?
There is singing when babies are baptised... when you celebrate a marriage.
Men sing as they work.
Soldiers sing as they march into battle... and there is singing when people die.
I have always found something in life worth singing about... and for that
I cannot apologise.
For the fact that
I've caused you pain...
I cannot apologise enough.
I have not been able to imagine, until now... the offence I have given.
[Playing]
-What are those?
-My things.
IANNIS: I can see that. Why?
CORELLI: I'm going to stay in the encampment with my men.
I think it will be best.
IANNIS:
But you must understand...
I made an arrangement with your quartermaster.
We agreed the terms.
I would not feel comfortable...
Letting him down.
Therefore,
I think you should stay.
CORELLI: I don't think your daughter would agree.
My daughter understands the importance... of honouring an arrangement.
I'll speak to the quartermaster.
Make sure you continue to get your medical supplies.
I've enjoyed meeting you.
I'm only sorry about the circumstances.

[Band playing polka music]
[Speaking Italian]
[Band playing waltz music]
I'll be back in a moment.
My friend thinks you are very pretty.
Why doesn't he tell me himself?
He's too shy.
He wants to know if you'll dance with him.
No, I can't-- not with a German.
But tell him thank you.
Tell him I don't mean to be rude.
Uno momento.
[New song starts]
Don't stay up too late.
[Music stops]
Antonio!
It's Turkish.
From the Great War.
We should explode it.
The explosive must have decayed.
It's been floating for about twenty years.
We could have put on a good show.
[Humming "La Donna è Mobile"]
[Whistling]
CORELLI: We are going to explode the bomb.
It will be a fantastic explosion... and when the time comes... nobody must come down to the beach.
You must watch from where you are.
Capitano!
You must be one of the most stupid people I've ever met.
You wanted to show off so you nearly get us all killed.
I can see your lips moving... but I can't hear a word you're saying.
It should pass-- in a day or two.
Your father says it will pass in a day or two.
Does he?
Is that what the great doctor says?
What are you saying?
Are you saying how beautiful life is... since the Italians arrived?
All my life I've been waiting.
I don't know how I survived before you came.
Are you saying how much you missed having me around?
I miss you so much
I can't sleep at night.
The other night when you were dancing... the way you were moving...
The turn of your head.
[Sighs]
I thought
I could watch you forever.
You think you can come here... and turn my whole world upside-down?
QUARTERMASTER: Iodine.
Bandages.
Dressings.
This is all I have.
I can't give you any morphine.
And we need all the quinine we have.
12,000 of our men on the mainland... are sick with malaria.
Supplies are not getting through.
Nobody knows why, nobody knows what is happening... and I'm going to eat.
You know, when I met Pelagia's mother... she was betrothed to somebody else.
He nearly killed me.
I had to leave the island.
I had to lie low for a while.
She wants to train to be a doctor, you know.
You think she'd make a good doctor?
I think she'd make a very good doctor.
IANNIS: Oh, uh...
Another thing.
This is a very ancient land... and we have had nothing but earthquakes... and slaughter for 2,000 years.
We've had massacres at Sami and Fiskardo... and God knows where else.
There will be more.
It's only a question of time.
So don't make any plans.

You're very sweet.
[Men cheering]
The Allies have landed in ltaly.
We can all go home then.
[Men chattering]
I can't believe it.
You really want this war to be over?
What is wrong with you Italians?
We don't have your advantages,
Gunther.
-[Tuning mandolin]
-Advantages?
CORELLI: The advantage of thinking that... other races are inferior to yours.
It's a question of science.
You can't alter a scientific fact.
I don't care about science.
It's morality that counts.
What is your morality?
CORELLI:
If I were to see a man... being set upon by others...
I would think that man was my brother.
That is my morality.
I would make myself believe it's personal.
For me, too, the war is personal.
I lost both my grandfathers in the Great War.
MAN: A war that you started.
WEBER:
And my father's brother... two of my mother's brothers.
I grew up in a country where it was hard to survive.
We were hungry all the time.
All we ever knew about was defeat. But now--
IANNIS:
Sometimes it is better... to lose than to have so much blood on your hands.
SOLDIER:
It's a beautiful night... and everything is peaceful... and we should think about falling in love.
[People laugh and chatter]
[Corelli plays mandolin]
[Song ends]
That's beautiful.
What is it?
It's "Pelagia's Song."
[Birds chirping]
[Motorcycle engine rattles]
I wrote you that song because I love you.
I don't care if the world knows it.
I couldn't care less... if I never pick up the mandolin again.
When I was playing, it felt like my hands were lumps of wood.
It felt as if every note was sour, stale.
And then I realised-- it's useless.
It's hopeless.
It can't begin to express the way I feel about you.
[Breathing deeply]
IANNIS:
Next time you see him... tell him I have got his mandolin.
He left it in the square.
[Birds chirping]
Four more boys from the village have left to join Mandras.
Constantine's boys.
Kostas's brother, what's his name?
George.
He's only fifteen.
He always worshipped Mandras.
Do you love him?
We are engaged to be married.
I am not talking about Mandras.
IANNIS:
When you fall in love... it is a temporary madness.
It erupts like an earthquake, and then it subsides.
And when it subsides, you have to make a decision.
You have to work out whether your roots... have become so entwined together... that it is inconceivable... that you should ever part.
Because this is what love is.
Love is not breathlessness.
It is not excitement.
It's not the desire to mate every second of the day.
It is not lying awake at night... imagining that he is kissing every part of your body.
No, don't blush.
I'm telling you some truths.
That is just being in love... which any of us can convince ourselves we are.
Love itself is what is left over... when being in love has burned away.
Doesn't sound very exciting, does it?
[Chuckles]
But it is.
Do you think that you could begin to imagine... that that is how you will come to feel with Captain Corelli?
Pelagia...
You must act honourably... with respect to Mandras and his mother.
And... pray for the liberation of the island... because then everything becomes possible.
[Children chatter]
Drosoula.
All night I've been thinking about Mandras.
About me and Mandras.
Thinking about how long we've been apart.
When did you arrive?
Where is your ring?
My fingers got too thin.
I thought I would lose it.
Where will you stay?
I want to ask you something.
We need to see the Italian captain.
I want you to ask him to meet with us.
As soon as you can.
RADIO: In Germany, the port of Hamburg... suffered a second day of continuous air raids... from nearly
800 British aircraft...
Leaving much of the city in ruin.
While, in ltaly,
Rome has finally fallen... to the Allied advance after weeks of fierce fighting... and a huge bombing campaign on the capital.
Allied commandos... are closely watching the Mediterranean countries... occupied by German and Italian forces.
It's not yet clear what the German attitude... to an Italian withdrawal might be... but Germany will assume sole command... of many strategic territories.
Hitler is expected to send massive reinforcements... through the Balkans and into Greece... as the Nazis struggle to maintain supply routes... to northern Africa.
Mandras is back.
He wants to see you.
[Engine revs]

[Bells chiming]
[Shouting and chattering]
[Villagers applauding and cheering]
[Applause and cheering]
Colonel Barge and I have agreed the date for the surrender... of our heavy weapons and machine guns-- the fifteenth of September.
That's in five days time.
CAPTAIN: Why should we lay down our arms?
They were our allies.
Why should they be dictating terms to us?
We have surrendered.
Mussolini has surrendered to the British and the Americans... not to the Germans.
GANDIN: Colonel Barge and I have agreed.
If we surrender our arms, do we have confirmation... that they will not use force against us?
GANDIN: I have a personal undertaking... from Colonel Barge and his officers... that our troops will be allowed safe passage.
CAPTAIN: My men will never agree to return home... without their weapons.
If you surrender your arms in times of war... then you are no longer a man.
GANDIN: If you were in their position... if you were German... you would want to be certain for your own security... that the weapons will not be passed on... to the Allied forces or to the Greek partisans.
Or turned against you.
Or turned against you.
[Engine revs]
You must be looking forward to going home.
There'll be people happy to see you again, I'm sure.
Your family, your mother, your wife.
Your girlfriend?
CORELLI: You wanted to see me?
MANDRAS: We need arms.
Machine guns, ammunition, land mines... anything you can spare.
How can I give you weapons?
-You know I can't do that.
-You've surrendered.
If you don't intend to fight... you won't be needing your weapons.
We have a country to defend.
DIMITRIS:
There is a massive build up... of German troops on the mainland.
The 117th Jaeger Division is nearing the Corinth Canal.
The 104th is moving south from Yugoslavia.
Then you are not in any position to resist.
Unless we act now.
Do you know, Captain, on Lefkada island... all the Italians who surrendered... have been sent to prison camps in the north.
We heard they went home.
The trains were diverted in Albania.
MANDRAS:
In this war, Captain... it's hard to know who you can trust.
But one thing is certain-- you can't trust the Germans.
[Soldiers shouting]
[Yells]
Last night I dreamed
I was sitting... in a restaurant in Piazza Navona... eating zuppe di cozze piccante... then a plate of tagliarini al boscaiolo.
Colonel Barge has requested...
I withdraw your battery from Antisamos Beach.
If they wanted to bring in heavy reinforcements... this is where they would do it.
Is this an order?
Captain... don't you want to go home?
[Vehicles rumbling]
[German soldier yells]
Are you going to let us through?
My orders are to supervise... the surrender of your arms and weapons.
[Soldiers cocking guns]
The deadline for the hand-over is at noon tomorrow.
WEBER: Antonio.
This order comes from Colonel Barge.
He has asked me personally... to assure you that if you surrender your arms... you will be guaranteed safe passage.
Like the Italian garrison at Lefkada?
Lefkada?
But they laid down their weapons.
They went home.
[Weapon thumps]
[Soldier shouts in German]
[Dropping weapons]
[Soldier yells in German]
You must be looking forward to seeing ltaly again.
Do you think we could keep in touch?
I mean, after the war, of course.
[Soldiers speaking German]
You can have my gun when
I've finished my cigarette.
Get your hands off me, you ba--
[Gunfire and shouting]
[Soldiers shouting]
I understand your concern.
If I were in your shoes, I would be asking questions, too.
Of course, we will investigate what happened--
I can tell you what happened--
My men are dead!
...take the appropriate action.
CORELLI: What does that mean?
Does it mean that I can write to the families of these men... and tell them that their murderers will be charged... that justice will prevail?
You force us at gunpoint to line up and surrender our arms.
You impound our weapons.
We're supposed to be allies!
GANDIN:
Captain Corelli, please!
We need some kind of assurance.
I can assure you that the order to disarm... did not come from my headquarters.
GANDIN: We have agreed to the surrender of our arms... by noon tomorrow.
We would like your assurance that no more of our troops... will be forcibly disarmed before that deadline.
BARGE: Herr General, by noon tomorrow...
I guarantee you'll be on your way home.
[Clicks heels]
[Soldier speaking Italian]
QUARTERMASTER:
This is not our war.
This is between the Greeks and the Germans.
CORELLI: Would you prefer we left them to fight on their own?
[Sighs]
CORELLI: The 4th Regiment will hold Antisamos.
We'll keep the 5th in reserve at Assos... and I will take the 8th and 9th to Argostoli.
[Soldier speaking Italian]
CORELLI: All gun lines to be in position... by first light tomorrow.
[Trucks approaching]
If we resist now, we can beat them.
What if the Germans send planes?
Don't go near Argostoli.
Stay away from Antisamos Beach.
I want to lie across the road so that you can't leave.
Keep a gun with you at all times. Promise me.
Come back to me.
Promise me.
[Panting]
When it's over, you will come back to me.
[Jeep engine revs]
[Breathes heavily]
CARLO: I know what you feel.
You think if he died your world will stop.

He's alive.
MANDRAS: He's alive.
[Breathing heavily]
He was alive when I found him.
Fragments of uniform in the bullet holes.
-Splinters of rib.
-Just do it.
I am not a surgeon.
I have no penicillin.
Please!
I have no sterile water.
No serum.
Please, Father, do it!
Hold.
IANNIS:
Four of his ribs are broken.
[Gasping]
Papa! Antonio. Don't move.
Don't move!
If you even try to move, you will haemorrhage to death.
Uhh!
No, you must lie still.
How--I don't--I don't...
You were lying under Carlo's body.
If it wasn't for him, you wouldn't be alive.
How did I get here?
Mandras found you.
PELAGIA: Antonio, you should try and drink something.
Antonio?
What would you like for lunch?
Not that there is any choice, of course.
But if there was...
We needed something-- steel, wire--to bind the bones.
Of course, they'll have to be removed sometime in the future.
I could try and get some new strings from somewhere.
I could ask around.
Antonio!
What are you doing?
CORELLI: If they find me, they will shoot you both.
They'll kill you if you leave this house.
I don't belong here, Pelagia!
I never belonged here!
Ever since I came, look what has happened all around you.
I love you.
I had no right to make you love me... when you weren't mine to love.
WOMAN: No! Don't do that!
[Speaking German]
[Speaking Italian]

We must go.
[Sobbing]
I had to see you again.
One last time.
We must go!
Pelagia--
Don't say anything.
Look at me.
DIMITRIS: We must go!
-Go.
-Pelagia.
Go! Go.
[Door opens]
Why did you save him?
Why didn't you leave him to die?
I wanted you to love me again.
In Albania, I made them read every one of these to me.
"Mandras, I love you.
Mandras, I want you.
"Mandras, when are you coming back?"
And then one day a different letter.
"I don't know how to describe my feelings.
"It's as if I've been waiting a hundred years...
"to hear from you.
"Waiting a hundred years for you to return.
"Once I thought my heart was overflowing...
"with love for you.
"But now all I feel is emptiness.
"And I think all the time it was a pretence...
"that I never loved you at all."
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
IANNIS: The war we thought would never end is over.
And the island we thought we had lost forever is ours again.
In the doctor's house there are three of us now... the doctor, his daughter... who is training to be a doctor... and Lemoni.
Pelagia! Pelagia!
It's for you.
From ltaly.
LEMONI: What is it?
It's a record.
[Guitar music playing]
[Music stops]
We should start making supper, that's what we should do.
Lemoni.
IANNIS:
Antonio, I do not know... if this letter will reach you... or even if you are alive.
Perhaps someone else sent us your record... and that is why we found no note.
I would like to say that Pelagia is happy... but she is full of tears she will not let fall... and of a grief no doctor can mend.
She blames herself for the pain we have suffered... and perhaps the same is true for you.
You know I am not a religious man... but I believe this... if there is a wound, we must try to heal it... if there is someone whose pain we can cure... we must search till we find them... if the gods have chosen that we should survive... it will be for a reason.
[Sobbing]
[Singing in Greek]
Where is your miracle today then, eh?
What do we have to say about that?
[Cheering]
[Greek music playing]
STAMATIS: Wake up.
Fetch the firewood.
Fix the roof.
Paint the house.
She's driving me mad.
When I was deaf,
I couldn't hear her...nagging.
But now--
Iatre, I beg of you, help me.
Put the pea back in my ear.
Iatre?
Lemoni?
Lemoni?
Lemoni?
I was looking for Lemoni.
She's down the road.
I went to the house.
It doesn't exist anymore.
We are building a new one.
Your father wrote you got the record.
It's a guitar.
It's different.
I tried to live without you.
I tried to make myself believe
I could live without you.
The scar healed well.
Stamatis, do you love your wife?
If you love your wife, my advice is be nice to her.
Bring in the wood before she asks you for it.
If she is cold, then put a shawl around her shoulders.
And bring her a flower... every time you come back from the field.
STAMATIS: You won't put the pea back in my ear?
IANNIS: Oh, no, no, no.
That would be against the Hippocratic Oath.
[Russell Watson singing "Ricordo Ancor"]
...7-0, this is 5-4...
Positions 1-8-1-9, 2-0-2-1 and 2-2 and 2-3 are now complete.
The 24 is in the position... is in the, uh, uh... being complete in about five minutes. Over.
Excuse me, folks.
Good to see you.
How are you?
Excuse me.
Afternoon.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Major General Ford.
We are marching because ever since the partition of Ireland
Catholics here in the North have suffered discrimination in a Protestant dominated land.
That's why we're marching.
In view of the continuing adverse security situation in the Province, all parades, processions and marches will be banned until further notice.
We're marching because the British government promised us reform and all we've had are excuses and curfews and the single issue that cuts to the very core of civil rights mass internment without trial.
That's why we're marching.
Anyone either taking part in or organizing such an event is liable to immediate arrest.
The law is the law and must be respected.
So we say this to the British government.
We will march peacefully this Sunday and march, and march again until Unionist rule is ended in this Province and a new system, based on civil rights for all is put in its place.
Thank you.
And I would say to the leadership of the civil rights organization any responsibility for any violence which may take place must rest fairly and squarely on your shoulders.
Thank you.
We shall overcome, we shall overcome
Some day...
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, see you later.
...Deep in my heart...
You must have jets on your feet.
My launching pad is only three blocks away, remember?
Yeah.
Let's continue, to the Moon.
To the Moon.
Can't we spend a quiet evening, like, alone?
Well, we're expecting
Professor Reaburn to notify us.
The fellas ought to all be together in case he does.
He's grand.
What's wrong with him?
He's just tossing and turning.
Gerry.
I'll get him. I'll get him.
I'll settle him down.
Anyway, Mum's home.
Hi.
Oh, God.
What a night, huh?
Hello.
How'd you enjoy baby-sitting?
-All right.
-You been feeding him?
Hello, wee man. Hello.
Was he good for you?
Aye, he was good as gold, so he was.
Oh, see him playing up now for me.
That's always the way.
Where'd youse go?
Up the Stardust.
The usual, you know, just for a few drinks.
That's all I need on a Saturday night.
Look, I'm just taking Hester back down to town.
Right, okay. You be careful.
Aye, I'll be grand.
No, I mean it.
I don't want you getting lifted again.
I'll be all right.
Ta-ra.
Right.
See ya.
Are you going next week?
Aye, may as well.
Be a good crack.
Aye, I'll be all right.
Hopefully they'll keep the boys out.
Aye.
I'll keep them away from you.
Come around Jackie's...
No, he's not.
How're you doing?
Protestant?
Eddie wants you out?
Yeah, a right little turncoat.
-What?
-So he is.
What about the way he dogs me?
Keeps me young.
Oh, he's hardly gonna do that.
It's your sister's husband.
Come on! Get a move on!
Looks like they might threaten us.
Aye.
You better leave me here.
You'll be careful tomorrow?
I'll be fine.
It's only a march.
And what if trouble starts?
There'll be no trouble.
It's a peaceful march for civil rights.
All right.
Look, I'll meet you here tomorrow about 6:00, okay?
Right.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Come in, One-Seven.
This is One Alpha.
Uh, one of your roadblocks further out has reported movements.
Three people in the green
Volkswagen Variant 1500.
Uh, the registered number is G...
She was winking earlier at that guy.
She knows.
One Alpha.
Registration number Golf,
Uniform, Lima, 2-1-5-5. Over.
Right.
Get some team commanders on base soonest.
Come on, let's get moving.
Let's get some pace till where we're secure.
He's going to get a brief from Corporal.
Sigs on me.
Get HQ up on the net now.
Move the vehicles out of that line of sight.
Tell me where the sentries are fully posted.
Okay, if there is a sniper threat today it's coming from over there.
Make sure you've got that covered.
Yes, Colonel, we're currently putting a covert O.P. out on to the derelict site down William Street.
I'll let you know as soon as that's in place.
We've got the whole,
I've got the company in?
We're established.
Can you just confirm we're gonna brief up the troop commanders shortly?
Yeah, okay.
Is Gerry about, is he?
Ah, come on, Mary, we have to go to Mass here.
Come on now, Mary, open the door.
Keep it down, okay?
Ah, the wee man's asleep, is he?
Shh.
What's the crack with you?
Hey, the Brits are here.
The Pigs are everywhere here.
The Bogside's crawling with 'em.
Geez. Holy shit.
Okay, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
Okay.
Lads, I count a dozen for APCs as well.
Aye.
But there's more at the bottom of Rossville Street.
At the corner of the Craigavan Bridge as well.
...are everywhere, hey.
It was on the radio this morning!
-Shh...
-Come on!
Get a move on, man.
Oh, fuck's sake, are your trousers too tight or your balls too big?
Ah, you're just jealous, man.
Oh, sorry.
Wee man, you all right?
Aye, we'll be all right, Mary.
One day, Mary, he'll grow up to be a good stone thrower himself.
Go on, youse.
Eh...
Where are you going now?
I'm going to Mass, Mary.
I'll be back later on.
Gerry!
Can you see any, aye?
Oh, yeah.
Look, look.
Look at this, hey.
Go on, Brits, out!
Get out!
Go on back home!
Go on, you British scum!
Get out!
Hey, we'll see you later at the Guildhall!
Go back!
They better not try and stop us today.
It'll take more than rubber bullets and barbed wire.
Brits out!
Come on!
...troops, including members of the parachute regiment...
Oh, shit.
The army... has warned that time and place to stop the march...
Which means that it could cover a considerable distance...
Ma, can you get that?
The Nationalist Bogside
Brigadier is in the city...
This is...
...at the no-go areas for six months the local residents barricaded the streets...
Organizers of the march...
Jesus.
Morning. How are you all?
Yes, yeah.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Ma, Ma, Ma.
I can't see them now.
No, I will. I'll be there.
Can I get through here?
I just want to get to the phone there.
Yeah, okay.
We're all getting ready for the march here.
Yeah?
How many?
Any sign of the Paras?
Yeah.
What about the square?
Okay, I'll meet you at Aggro Corner.
Folks...
I'll be with you.
I understand.
Just getting ready for the march here.
Yes, right,
I know I'm going to sort it.
I'm going to sort it.
They've been waiting for over an hour, Ivan.
Well, tell them
I'm gonna see the Bishop.
-Hah!
-No, the Cardinal.
Oh, aye, the Pope.
Uh-huh.
They mightn't believe you, but it's worth a try.
All right, Dad?
Take care of yourself.
I am. I'm grand, I'm grand.
Okay.
Now, it's just a Sunday afternoon stroll.
-Have you no...?
-Don't worry about it.
Have you no coat, darling?
No, no, I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I'll see youse later, okay?
Take care of yourself, son.
I will, I will. It's fine.
Nothing to worry about.
Look after yourself, darling.
Sort them out, would you please?
I'm sorry.
Mr. Cooper, have you got a moment?
Uh, surgery's canceled today.
It's about my TV.
Well, it's civil rights we're marching for not TVs, Mr. O'Keefe.
Well, Mrs. Doherty, sleep well last night?
Aye, I did that, Mr. Cooper.
Are you coming to Mass?
Mrs. Doherty, a good Protestant like me?
March against internment.
Hello, folks. See you later.
March again internment.
There you are, son.
See you later.
There's the church, and we're in this yard here.
Roger.
Proposed route of the march is along here and then along the street.
Runs that way.
Yes, I see.
Our job is to catch these hooligans and pinch them between ourselves and C Company.
Yes.
Okay, so it's gonna be through the wall then down the street and, hopefully, we'll catch them coming straight into us.
William Street runs parallel behind you guys behind this wall.
Plan is machine-gun platoon will make the breach with their Pigs.
We'll follow through on foot.
It's about 150 yards of waste ground through the derelict buildings and we'll be on William Street and behind the marchers.
So, what about the, uh, stickies and pyra presence over in the Bogside?
Are we gonna...?
Well, they're there, and-and...
Do we reckon the players are gonna be out today?
-They're bound to be.
-Okay.
They're absolutely bound to be and we've got to be ready for 'em.
Okay, well, we got the guys from...
The primary... the primary job is picking up 200 or 300 of the Derry young hooligans, all right?
Okay, and tell the lads we want maximum aggression.
We want a lot of arrests today and if the shooting starts we're gonna shoot back plenty of rounds.
Roger.
How do? Morning, ladies.
There you are.
All right, ladies?
Okay, see you later.
All right, boys.
Here, hand some of these out at Mass.
Walk away, lads.
Walk away. Don't worry.
Don't be intimidated.
It's all right.
Aha.
Sorry.
Excuse us, it's all right.
It's okay, I know him.
Go on, this is a peaceful march.
Peaceful march we're having today.
I hope you boys are the same.
Hey, lads, lads, lads.
I know him, I know him,
I know him, I know him.
It's all right.
He's full drunk.
I'll take him away.
Walk away, walk away.
Come on, walk away.
Thank you, thank you.
It's a peaceful march we're having.
Hey, get ye away.
Go and get to bed, go home.
Sleep it off.
I'll see you later.
How are you, folks?
Don't worry. You're grand.
-It's a peaceful march.
-See you later.
No riots today.
Don't be intimidated.
Good to see youse.
I'll see youse later.
Thank you. There you are.
The Bogside is a fucking mess.
We've got to go in there, get a grip of it.
We've got to teach these people a lesson.
So make sure the guys know who the leaders of these fuckers are.
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?
And let's go and get 'em.
Everyone's got to have a handle on these key players.
I want them lifted off the street today.
We're gonna have these guys.
That's why we're out there.
Make sure the guys know.
I wanna see all of them in the bag.
Quite clear?
It's the end of our tour.
Let's teach 'em a fucking lesson.
Let's do the business.
Let's make the CO proud of us.
I wanna show the Brigade what One Para are made of.
Is that all clear?
Yeah, no problem.
Any questions?
Do we just go in on our own?
We're not taking anybody else with us?
Support Company,
Charlie Company, that's it.
All right, boys? Stewards!
Jesus.
What we've got here is a pressure cooker situation.
Kevin.
Just a minute.
Just bear with me one minute.
So?
So, uh, whole city's shut down.
No one's getting in or out.
You've got Normandy landings down there.
That's gonna be the flash point so I'm bringing everybody down here.
The march is coming down here.
These guys are gonna be right here.
So, nobody's getting through here.
William Street is the key thing.
-Do we have enough stewards?
-We have enough.
Michael, will you go and ask the other fellas to come down as quickly as possible, please?
-ls that the Provos?
-The Provos are down there.
What the hell are they doing here?
Well, they're just sniffing about.
Basically,
I think they must think that the Brits have invaded the place.
Oh, Jesus, I've been down William Street.
-Really?
-Have you spoken to them yet?
I'm-I'm gonna have a quick word with the Commanding Officer in just a moment.
I will, I will.
-Well, I'll see you down there.
-Right.
Stress to those boys that we're in control up here, will ya?
Yep. Yep. How do?
My name is Ivan Cooper.
I'm a Member of Parliament for this area.
-Come on, sir, back off.
-Uh, sorry.
You couldn't do us a favor and move this back a bit?
It's just the march is coming...
No, you're not, mate.
You're participating in an illegal march, sir.
Now back off from the barricade.
Back off from the barricade, sir.
What gives you the right to stop us marching in our city?
You're participating in an illegal march.
Who says that?
The sooner we can march in our own city...
We're just doing our job.
Back off.
...to the Guildhall, the sooner we'll have civil rights.
We're just doing our job.
Back off.
Well, it's a basic principle of democracy.
Northern Ireland Government has barred this march.
Right, thank you.
Jesus.
No, I can't get through to them.
Oh, hold on.
Mrs. Hegarty, I hope you're joining us today.
Now, no excuses.
I can't. It's me Uncle John.
He's been on bucket all night.
Uh-huh, that's right.
Was it the beer, aye?
No, it wasn't.
He's sick, Mr. Cooper.
All right, Mrs. Hegarty.
Listen up. What are we gonna do?
We're gonna march.
Are you sure about this?
We've gotta march, we've gotta march, Kevin.
I'll tell you, listen, if we don't march civil rights is dead in this city.
The movement's dead.
We have got to march.
Sort the stewards out.
I'm gonna talk to the Provos.
-Okay. All right.
-Keep it up.
Right, gentlemen.
Be very careful.
Just go straight home.
There's a huge military buildup, and they've got us surrounded.
Father, I'm going to miss you.
Yeah. Keep your eye on the... on the young people, okay?
Mind yourself. Hiya, lads.
Listen, there's a lot of Army around, okay?
Ah, don't worry, Father.
So be very careful, lads, okay.
-Listen, thanks very much.
-Okay.
Hiya, Gerry,
I wanna have a chat with you.
Listen, lads, I'll see youse, yeah, okay?
Ah, youse boys wait for me, right. I'll be up nigh.
How long have you been out now?
I'm out three weeks now, Father, so I am.
So, what's the plans?
Well, I'm trying to get a job but, uh, it's hard work trying to get one with a record.
Things will pick up, you know but the one thing, Gerry, you gotta be careful you don't get nabbed rioting again.
I am, I'll be rioting again, aye.
But, uh, there's an awful lot of young lads down there rioting on Saturdays and so on, so...
Aye, but it's just stones,
Father.
You know, it's not that bad.
Yeah, but Gerry, you can't afford to be caught.
Okay, take care, Martin.
Aye, I know what you're saying.
Yeah, so how do you feel having given yourself up?
I feel it's better for the long run.
Sorry, Father.
Pray for us, Father because it's gonna be a terrible day.
We will indeed. Yeah, yeah.
Now, keep an eye on the young people going home, okay?
-I will.
-Get them to go home.
You know, it's better for the long run.
At least I've no... not worrying about getting caught.
I don't know how I can go on with me life.
I think you've done the right thing and you just can't afford to be back down there again.
Aye, I don't want to go back,
Father, so I don't.
No, I'll not be rioting.
So, are you going to the big march today?
Aye, I'm going on the march, so I am.
Me and all the boys are going, you know.
Yeah, well, you'd better be very careful, all right?
Right, Father.
So, listen, I'll probably see you down there.
All right, Father.
Watch yourself.
I'll see you later on, all right, Father?
Okay. Yeah, you mind yourself, and God bless. Take care.
What did he say, Gerry?
He just asked me how I was getting on.
Up the Rah!
Here, boys, here, boys, here, listen, here.
Don't want no trouble today, now, I mean it.
There's women and children gonna be in this march, all right?
Get out of the...
Yeah. No, listen, come on.
You're gonna make it worse if you start antagonizing these boys.
Just leave them alone; join us.
It's a big day for us.
Women and children are gonna be safe now, I mean it.
No acting the idiot.
Keep it calmed down.
You bastards!
Go home, you scum!
You bastard.
Get the fuck out, trash!
Just checking you're keeping the guns away.
That's no concern of yours,
Ivan.
You gave me your word.
Then take it.
We just want a peaceful march.
This is our day.
People are fed up with the shootings and the...
Convoy has just come over Craigavan Bridge and they've set up barricades on William Street.
Right. Any sign of the Paras?
No, not yet.
Right, okay.
Any sign of anything, let me know, all right?
Right? Go on.
Ivan...
Ivan, it's all very well for you sitting pretty with your wee Westminster paycheck every week.
Marching's not gonna solve this thing.
Watch us.
Welcome to the Eighth Brigade, sir.
Thank you very much.
Good trip.
Where's Maurice?
Lieutenant Colonel Steele, sir.
Okay.
How are you, Pat?
I'm very well. Thank you, sir.
It's good to see you.
And you, sir.
I've had a briefing come through from Downing Street and the Prime Minister really has had enough of this Londonderry rebellion.
All right? Shall we go through?
Please.
Stand up.
Good man.
-Sergeant Major!
-Hello, sir.
How are you?
-I'm fine, sir.
-Good to see you again.
And you, sir.
Okay, carry on.
Cup of tea, cup of coffee, sir?
Yes, please.
Yes, thank you, Michael.
The briefing's ready when you are.
-Excellent.
-Good.
Well, I just, uh, wanted to say, sir that the men were rather bucked when they heard that we were going to be coming across.
Oh, good.
I'm very pleased to hear it.
Yes, sir.
Everything's set for today?
-I think so, sir, yes.
-Good.
Their intention, at present is to move along William Street all the way along...
-Past Aggro Corner?
-Well, that's right, sir.
...into the city center and on to the Guildhall where they'll be having their rally.
As it is, we're gonna stop them here at barrier 14 with the Raw Green Jackets.
Very good.
Uh, Coldstreams?
Coldstreams are up on the city walls and King's Own are the north side of William Street.
One Para are in the Presbyterian churchyard just here.
Very good.
And Three Company are behind barrier 14.
If there's any trouble
Support Company will break through...
I don't think there's any doubt about that. There will be.
Okay, Support Company then will break through the wall for the Presbyterian churchyard through this dead ground, break through this wall and they, in turn... they're gonna come round and sweep round behind all the hooligans round about Aggro Corner sweeping them towards barrier 14.
At the same time
Three Company will be breaking through barrier 14 and the hooligans will be caught in a pincer movement.
Thank you, Charles.
I should just say, sir, of course
One Para only go in if there is violence and then only if there is a clear separation between the march proper and the hooligan element.
Uh, do we know who we're looking for?
Yeah, we've got OPs at strategic points all along the route.
Um, and they all...
They've all been briefed on all the local known players.
They've seen pictures, have they?
-Yes. Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
-Good, very good.
-We-We have a cordon of snipers here, sir, should the IRA wish to make a contribution this afternoon.
Yes, I'm sure they will.
Do you know where they're going to be?
-Michael?
-Yes, sir.
We are concentrating on the top of these block of flats which is where we imagine they'll be.
And possibly Glenfada Park across the road, sir.
Very good. Rubber bullets-- have the men all been issued?
-Uh, yes, sir.
-Good.
Maurice?
Sir?
Anything I haven't thought of?
Uh, I suspect press placement would be quite important today, sir.
Yes, winning the propaganda war.
Absolutely vital.
Who's in charge of that?
Lieutenant Hector, sir, is our Press Liaison Officer, sir.
There are a few points which will, um, please you.
As per your request, both local and national coverage will be occurring on the day and this will be in the main three formats of press from the leading tabloids additionally from the major television companies and radio stations.
Talk to Colonel Tugwell about where that's going to be and knock that out for me, please, Maurice.
Good. Thank you. Well done.
Thank you, Michael.
Right, you can just carry on.
So, maybe, um... the press will congregate around barrier 12 itself.
Then once there...
Yes, I suspect that's probably the best location for them.
Um, they've got a clear view down Rossville Street.
Especially Generals.
That should give us quite a bit of press coverage as well as showing, uh...
We're gonna have to be tough today, Pat.
Really tough.
If there's any trouble at all, the Paras are to counterattack.
Is that clearly understood?
Of course, Robert.
Good.
And, um... you have my full support, of course.
Thank you, sir.
Good.
Hello, John, Jimmy.
Should be coming round for tea.
Hello.
Hello.
-Ivan, how's it going?
-How do, folks.
Good to see you.
So, they have blocked the Belfast Road which means we've got about ten coaches stock.
All right there, boys, all set?
Right, get those pencils sharpened.
So, it means we've got about ten coaches stockpiled at the border.
Just give me just a wee minute, Declan.
How are you going to get them in?
I've sent Jimmy up there.
He's sorting it out.
Yeah, that's fine.
It's no bother.
We can't have ten coach loads sitting there with marchers on them, doing nothing.
Relax, relax, it's fine.
We've got them coming down for about 1 :00.
And what about the stewards?
Stewards are fine; that's sorted.
And we got Fenner Brockway, which is great news but, obviously, he's not going to march, for the legal reasons.
You'll have to give me a couple of minutes here.
I need to see Frances.
I'll be in in two ticks, all right?
Okay, I'm all for you, man but we need to kick this thing along, okay?
Listen, I was supposed to see her last night.
-Please, help me.
-Right, just a minute.
-Right, okay.
-Very quickly, please.
Mr. Cooper, have you got a moment?
One second.
...or voting for Simon as well.
Right, well, you go...
I'll follow you up.
Go on you on up and sort out through six.
-Through six?
-Yes.
Right, right.
Where-Where were you?
What happened to you?
I had meetings.
I'm sorry.
We're having a nightmare with this charge.
Of course you do.
Kevin's not entirely sure what's going on.
I have to sort it out;
I'm sorry.
Change the record, Ivan.
I'm sick of it.
Hey, wait, hey, wait, Frances.
Listen, give me a couple of minutes now.
I'm up to me eyes, Ivan.
I have no time for this.
I know that, I know that, but...
I have no time for it, Ivan.
Look, I'll be finished tonight about 8:00
We'll do something then, okay?
That's just balls, Ivan
'cause you'll still be sitting in the bar at 12:00 tonight
Iistening to the sound of your own voice.
You know it and I know it.
Wrong. Hold on, hold on.
Have you any expectation anybody's going to turn out for you this afternoon?
I would have thought so.
I think they've always turned out for us in the past and this is our big push today.
This is a march about peace and a march about civil rights.
What sort of numbers were you expecting?
Sorry, will you excuse me?
An hour to be safe.
Come on, that is not fair.
Just one second, please.
That is not fair to say that.
Don't you talk to me about fair.
Please, Cecilia, would you take that for me, love?
Don't you talk to me about fair.
I'm a Catholic girl, Ivan.
You look me straight in the face and say that again.
I know you're a Catholic girl.
That's the whole point about this, for heaven's sake.
Come on, darling.
Let me tell you something.
I am up to my eyes, Ivan.
You're not the only one.
I have the world's press in here wanting things done not now but yesterday.
It's about the two of us.
Cecilia, for me, love, please.
Come on, Frances, darling
I know it's hard, but please-- one last big push, eh? Come on.
Yes, just one wee second, please.
Will you just take care of that for me, please?
You're getting very late.
One second.
The British Army's surrounded the entire city.
Well, I think that shows you that they are very threatened by the voice that we are trying to get across here.
But is this not...?
That's about them; that's not about us.
We're trying to have a peaceful march against internment and a peaceful march for civil rights.
They're alleging that you're creating a confrontation.
Well, what do you think they would say?
What we need to do is split each...
All right, sorry, folks.
This is Fort George.
Mm-hmm.
This is... RUC station.
That's in Rosemont.
So, what we do is we come in from different routes in turn.
They come in from the south, and come in near Rosemont.
Excellent idea, Eamonn.
No, that won't work.
It will work, Ivan.
We confuse them, we get them to spread their troops.
No, I'm saying it won't work.
Have you something to say here?
I'm saying,
"Forget about the Guildhall."
I've just come from there this morning.
I've walked through there.
They're building up a massive military presence.
If we take the lorry down there with thousands behind it we're not going to get through, we're...
This is completely wrong.
I don't think,
I don't think it's actually...
I don't think it's responsible for us to say it's going to be fine just because we want it to be fine.
We do have to look at the realities that there is a very severe dispersal problem there.
I am not taking a reroute.
I am not taking a reroute, and I'm not selling out.
-You're not what?
-It's not a sellout.
Oh, no, here, wait, Kevin.
Wait, excuse me, say that again, please.
You're not, what, you're not selling out?
Bernadette, I have been marching in this city just as long as you and your college friends and I have never sold anyone out, not ever.
But there are 3,000
British soldiers out there and I am not going to use our people like cannon fodder.
Now, either we reroute-- turn right up Rossville Street hold the meeting at Free Derry Corner-- or I walk away, and I will tell my constituents
-to walk away as well.
-You'll do what?
All the work these people have done-- that's it, up in smoke?
Listen, we delegate two people--
Bridget, you can be one,
John, Eamonn can be another-- to walk down to the Guildhall symbolically.
That's a good solution.
I just hope everybody knows in time.
They will, they will.
All right.
Get that sorted out.
Right, um...
Is Lagan there?
It's Cooper.
On the one hand you've got the Catholics pushing for all sorts of reforms with the IRA behind most of it, and on the other the Protestants, who, of course, don't want to give an inch.
Morning, sir.
We can't afford to offend the Protestant majority, of course
'cause, uh, they've got all the guns, for one thing.
Excuse me, sir. Tea's here.
Hello, sir.
I'll take you in to see the Brigadier now.
Chief Superintendent Lagan, Sir.
Hello, Frank.
Morning, Patrick.
I don't think you've met
Major General Ford
Commander of Land Forces.
Sir, this is
Chief Superintendent Lagan
Londonderry Division.
Sir.
Superintendent, I've heard a great deal about you from your Chief Constable.
It's time for us to go.
We're going to shake some hands.
I, um, heard from the march organizers earlier today.
Sir, um, I heard from the civil rights leaders earlier today and spoke to them early this morning.
Oh, really?
Yes, they're anxious to avoid a confrontation.
They're not going to march to the Guildhall.
They're going to stay within the Bogside, they say.
Oh. So useful to have contacts in the community.
Maurice.
Unless he's a Roman Catholic, of course.
What's that all about, Patrick?
Patrick?
What's that all about?
It'll be low-key.
Low-key.
The Paras low-key?
Yes, I know, I know.
Excuse me, sir.
All call signs are now in place and the Paras have confirmed the cha cha.
Thank you, Charles.
The Paras aren't a low-key regiment.
Listen, they're the best for the kind of mass arrest operation that we've got to carry out today.
You listen to me.
I know the people of Derry.
And you know that I've spent the last three years of my life trying to keep a lid on the trouble in this city.
Frank, you don't need to tell me this.
Look, why do we need to ban this march in the first place?
Why? To keep a crowd of Protestant politicians in Stormont hanging onto power by their fingertips, that's why.
I mean, they're the reason why we're in this mess in the first place.
Look, why not just let the march go ahead?
Look, if you want prosecutions why not take photographs of the ringleaders?
Sir, the General's leaving and would like a word before you go.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Frank, I'm sorry.
It's out of my hands.
It's a war, Frank.
We're taking casualties every week.
We've lost 43 British soldiers.
I know. I know.
I'm having to write too many letters, Frank.
I'm sorry, we have to draw the line.
Sir, the General is getting quite excited.
Yes. Thank you, Sergeant Major.
I'm sick of being shot at, spat on and all the other shit that goes with this place.
It's about time we go out there and show these fuckers what it's all about.
The reason is
'cause they get away with it and this time they ain't going to get away with it.
You got to get in, you got to hit them hard and get in there first.
Get the first one straight in.
Same as we did in Belfast.
Take no shit.
This one's just a civil rights, though, ain't it?
They're all troublemakers anyway, mate.
The lot of 'em.
They're all mixed in together.
Well, that's just like kids, and that, ain't it?
Yeah, well, they're mixed in with the kids.
What about that major that died today?
Where was his civil rights?
And the two lads last week-- where's their civil rights?
I'm just saying, they're just kids throwing stones, that's all.
You're-You're either with us on this or you're not.
I'm with you, man.
Yeah, you better be.
I'm all right, man.
I'm-I'm up for it.
Everyone on the other side of this wall is enemy, as far as I'm concerned.
Can't see a kid being an enemy, though.
If they're in the way, they're in the way.
You got to stick with us on this.
I am.
Whatever happens we'll sort it all out between us, right?
When we bang through that wall, they see that wall come down they'll shit themselves, they really will.
We'll just get out there and just kick some arse out there.
Show the hats how to do it.
So, did you go to Mass today?
Aye, love.
Aye, whose is it?
Father Bally.
Ach, he's a nice man.
Aye, he is.
He was talking to me after it seeing how I was getting on after getting out of jail.
Wondering if you'd got a job yet, I suppose?
No, I wasn't.
You're going to get that wee girl into trouble, you know.
What are you on about?
You know what I mean.
Look, you're not me ma.
Aye, but I'm all you've got.
Sounds like she has horns on her head.
But she's from Irish Street and you're from the Bogside.
You know, at the end of the day she's like, you know, a Protestant.
I'm not saying I've got anything against her, like
'cause she's a nice girl but I just don't want you and her to get into trouble.
Are you thinking about getting married here?
Aye, I will be.
Well, what do you think your mam and daddy would say?
Look, leave my mam and daddy out of it.
Your sister's just looking out for you.
Look, you stay out of it.
Look, I'm just worried, that's all.
You know, I worry about you every time you go outside the door.
I don't want anything to happen to you.
Everybody in these flats here-- they worry about their children whenever they go out at night.
Look, I'll be all right.
All I want to do is to look after you and look after Dennis and defend this area from the likes of them boys there.
What do you mean, the likes of me?
You know, with working for the Brits.
You'd think you would have got a decent job.
It's working for the Brits putting that food on the table so don't be complaining.
Can we not have this conversation at the table, please?
I suppose you think throwing a couple of stones is going to solve it, son, do you?
Aye, well, it's kept them out of here for a while now, hasn't it?
If it wasn't for us, you still wouldn't be living here.
Just remember that.
Aye, you really believe that, do you, eh?
Aye, I do, actually.
Right, okay.
Look, Mary, I'm going to go out.
I'll see you later on.
Right.
I'll be all right. Don't worry.
Look after yourself, okay?
Are you listening to me?
I don't want you to end up back in prison
'cause you can't marry her from in there.
I'll be all right. Don't worry.
I'll chat to you after.
Yeah?
Oh, yes. Hi.
Oh, now, Meg, I dunno.
Somewhere between ten and a million. How's that?
Okay, talk to you later. Bye.
All right?
-Here's your tea.
-Thanks.
Okay?
Yeah. What time are you going?
I don't know, an hour.
Jesus. How about you?
I'm on duty till half two.
Derry Journal and Irish News want to talk to you.
What, now?
No, they'll... they can wait.
They're all right for a bit, so they are.
Listen, I know...
I know it's hard.
That's just why I pissed off at you last night.
I know, I'm sorry.
-That's all right.
-That's okay.
It's all right.
Okay.
Yeah?
Frank, yes.
Is it the Paras?
Well, Jesus, Frank who the hell's running this thing?
It was Lagan.
He says the army are very hard-line and we should think about canceling.
No way, Ivan. You can't.
You can't cancel.
No.
Geez, do you know how many times
I think we should just give this up?
There isn't a day goes by
I don't think
"Oh, wish I could take her to the pictures or take her to see Charlie Magee at the Stardust," you know and then I think, "What if someone sees us?" you know.
What if someone decides to have a go at you because you're this Catholic girl...
Hi.
Ivan, when are the stewards coming in?
Uh, we need to talk about that.
I need to talk to Kevin about that.
I need to make sure they are more disciplined and know exactly what's happening.
Who's going in front of the lorry who's going behind, okay?
-All right.
-lf you talk to Kevin now...
I'll give him a ring and then you can have a word with him.
Okay.
I'm just gonna talk to Kevin, all right?
It's all right.
Kevin, yeah... yeah, I've spoken to Lagan.
He says the Paras are in town.
Listen, the stewards must know what they're doing when they form the line.
Yeah.
No, seriously, Kevin, get on that now.
Okay, bye.
I mean, I don't know what I would do, you know?
Catholic girl, Protestant civil rights, Fenian lover?
So that's why I'm doing it, you know?
That's why I go to the meetings that's why I go to the marches, because, you know...
I think we're worth marching for.
Yes?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I'll be down in about an hour something like that.
Get Bridget on to them.
All right, yeah, give them a cup of tea or something, Jesus.
No, give them a drink, even better.
My father was in the EVA for
Christ's sake, you know that.
I know, Ivan.
I marched in flute bands.
Your brother was shot by the RUC.
So, I don't take you out.
We don't go to the pictures.
I go to the meetings,
I go to the marches and all the time I'm thinking, if I could just sort this you know, if just one day, maybe soon... we can be normal... and we won't have to worry.
I know.
Stewards, please ensure that all people joining the demonstration from the rear are channeled in safely keeping clear of that fenced area, please.
Thank you.
We want everybody safe here today. Thank you.
Come on, folks, sort that area out, please.
Folks, there is a start to a demonstration and there is an end to a demonstration.
If you think this is the start to a demonstration catch yourselves on.
Stewards, I need you down the back there, please.
All right, folks?
God, eh, what about this, eh?
Willie, make sure you've got that, okay?
I will, surely.
All right, folks, how goes it?
Ivan, will you sign this for me?
Oh, certainly, missus.
With love and kisses, eh?
How are you feeling, Ivan?
Oh, right at this moment...
Iike Martin Luther King.
Is he a Catholic boy then, eh?
All civil rights people are Catholic, missus, except me.
And I've got special dispensation from the Pope.
Eh, boys?
Barney, glad you could make it.
Aye, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Sure, I know that.
Jim, ready for another march, eh?
Oh, aye, of course.
Oh, Ivan, it's great, great!
All set?
Well, absolutely.
Would you have pulled out, Ivan?
What, and disappointed all these people?
You're a bastard, you.
Oh, no, no, Eamonn, just a politician.
Oh, no, no, Eamonn, just a politician.
Jesus Christ, look at that.
What an atmosphere, boys.
Look at the amount of people.
I think I see...
Youse marching down with us and that?
No, we're gonna hang about here in case the Brits try anything.
We'll be down later.
We'll have sent them home by then.
Aye, right.
Boys, they should be doing a bit more
-do you not think?
-Aye.
We do all the work, Jimmy.
Frigging sure, after what happened to McGilligan.
Are you up for it, Jimmy?
Up for it?
I'll be up on the front line.
I'll be up on the front line.
That's a promise.
Brits out, Brits out.
What do you think, Gerry?
-Brits out?
-Aye.
We'll all get the Brits out together.
-Aye.
-Are you up for it?
We're gonna move forward to give you a wee bit of leeway, right.
Make sure you get all that there.
Sure.
Sweep all the way right down...
Iook at that.
We shall overcome, we shall overcome
We shall overcome
Someday...
My God, they'll never stop us now, boys.
...Deep in our hearts...
The whole of Bogside is here.
...I do believe
That we shall overcome someday.
...moving now. Over.
Six-One Yankee, the crowd are on the move.
We have a go.
All right, gentlemen.
Sergeant Major, pass it on, the crowd's on the move.
Pass it out to the O.P., the crowd's on the move.
...that they are ready.
Here we go.
Sigs, Sigs, make sure all call signs know the march is on the move now.
-What do we want?
-Rights!
-When do we want them?
-Now!
-What do we want?
-Rights!
-When do we want them?
-Now!
Who'd have thought it, eh?
Okay, stewards, keep the front of the lorry clear, please.
Willie, Willie, come here, please.
Yeah, get the whole stream, the whole way up.
Oh, I can see 'em.
I can't see the end of it.
Bear in mind we are going down a hill here...
Come on, boys.
-Whoo!
-Whoo!
This is a great day for Ireland.
Absolutely.
...vital that we retain our dignity.
We must keep this safe, dignified...
...Zero, this is Six-One Yankee.
No information...
The crowd is now halfway down
William Street. Over.
Sir they're just about here now, sir.
Seven-Six.
Crowd is waving, chanting but, uh, causing no particular aggro. Over.
See what I mean?
Tell the people of Derry they can't march and they'll come out in droves.
Right, folks, keep that corner area clear.
We're approaching some of the British.
Hold your positions.
Keep your calm.
Hello, Six-Five, this is Six-One Yankee.
-Crowd approaching...
-Yeah, Five-Six Bravo this is, uh, Five-Niner Sunray.
So, in your opinion we will not get a Pig through the wall? Over.
Roger.
Oh, shit.
Colonel.
It's from the O.P.
They've just checked the front of the wall.
The wall directly in front of here
-there is a three-foot drop.
-Fuck.
In their opinion, when we try and get the Pig through we just ain't gonna get through.
We're gonna... it's gonna go tits up.
We still need to cut them off from either side.
I think we're gonna have to go over the top.
We'll have to.
Okay, let's get ready and be ready to cut through this wire and go over this wall.
Let's get ready now.
Okay, I'm on it. Sergeant Major!
-What do we want?
-Rights!
-When do we want them?
-Now!
Whoo!
Hey, do you think we'll have much bother today, Jim?
Eh?
So, you think we'll have much bother today?
Oh, no.
Hey, we'll get a riot going, that's for sure, like.
There's plenty of troops about and stuff, so.
You're not worried about getting caught, are you?
Aye, I don't wanna go back inside again, you know.
Hey, you shouldn't have given yourself up over Hester, man.
Oh, leave it out, okay?
-You've to watch yourself, mate.
-Just enjoy the day.
We're here for our civil rights today, right, boys?
Aye, that's right, mate.
Somebody help with these ladders!
Jesus, there's a lot of them, isn't there?
Come on, move it! Move it!
We're just going right at the corner here.
Give me that thing now.
-I need it.
-Right, right.
-Stewards, stewards.
-Here, keep them steady.
Stewards, stewards.
Keep them there, Barney.
Keep 'em going.
See that there, up there, how provocative is that?
Brits go home!
Stewards, keep this...
Don't touch it.
What the hell is that, lads?
Paras!
Brits out! Brits out!
We don't want youse here!
Zero-Six-Five.
Recon is passing my forward locations and there's a small amount of stoning going on there.
-Over.
-Six-Five.
That's the Paras getting stoned from up here, sir.
So, the head of... the head of...
Why are One Para showing themselves?
It's the chaps on the wall, sir.
OPs and wire cutters for when they have to go through.
If the crowd sees the Paras that'll inflame the situation,
Patrick.
Thank you, Frank.
-What?
-You have to go through.
Head of the column approaching Aggro Corner. Out.
Sir, this is where we hope they're going to turn.
Well, that's what they said.
People, we're just going right at the corner here!
Follow me! Let's go.
Keep back there, folks.
Keep moving here.
People, we're turning right here.
Turning right. Thank you.
The march is proceeding to the right.
If you go that way, you'll have no part in this demonstration.
They're turning the wrong way, lads.
They're going right.
We going to get to the Guildhall.
We're going to the Guildhall.
Come on. Push through them.
Come on, Gerry.
Gerry, good man, good man.
Yes!
Let's give them hell!
A small number from the middle of the crowd are breaking away,
I repeat, breaking away.
Running down towards serial One-Four. Over.
Running down towards serial One-Four. Over.
This demonstration is proceeding to the right.
Ivan, I told you this would happen.
Keep them coming this way!
Follow peacefully to the right, thank you.
Keep coming this way!
Just relax, man.
Listen, we have got to keep the crowd going.
If the truck keeps going to Free Derry Corner that will be the beacon.
They will follow it.
Right, you stay here.
I'm going down to the barrier.
Okay, everyone, come on.
Everyone behind the lorry.
Follow the lorry.
Listen...
We must stick together.
Stick together, folks.
We're not splitting up.
No trouble today.
We're not going to the Guildhall.
Stay behind the lorry.
We are sticking together.
Come on.
Sorry, no, folks, wrong way.
We're supposed to go back to Free Derry Corner.
Let me through there, folks.
They're past barrier 12 and are actually, in fact, heading directly for us.
Yeah, that's just what we predicted.
Yes, indeed.
Well, you'd better stand the men by.
Just coming down there now, sir.
This isn't the march, this is...
This is the breakaway group.
They're coming down to barrier 14.
They're trying to get to the Guildhall.
Yobbos, obviously trying to cause some trouble.
Get out!
Get out to fuck, you British bastards.
Boys, get back, get back!
Get out to fuck.
That's Cooper, boys.
Out! Out! Brits out!
Have you got your stones?
I've got stones.
Hey...
For God's sake, get all of these boys back.
Excuse me. I'm Ivan Cooper.
I'm a member of Parliament.
Will you give me some time...
This is an illegal gathering.
You must disperse!
Hey! Hey! Cut that out.
You must disperse!
Cut that out.
Take a shot.
Take a shot, you said?
I'll take a shot.
This is Nine-Zero Alpha.
I have reports of the crowd becoming hostile at Zero-14, um, throwing bricks at center. Over.
I want to know how many yobbos are that... are that way up towards the barrier from us.
Sigs, I want to find out from the O.P. how many we're going to scoop up, if we go now.
Contact the barriers at 12 and 14 and tell them to be ready to move those barriers fast if we need them.
Boys, round me, please.
It's kicked off at barrier 14, right?
This is it, we're going to start going in pretty soon.
We've got to stop with the stones there...
Under Section Six of the Civil Authorities
Special Powers Act
Northern Ireland processions and parades are banned until further notice.
We will enforce this ban vigorously and anyone organizing or taking part in any such event is liable to immediate arrest.
Do we still have stoning at 14?
We do, sir.
RUC man's addressing the crowd and he's...
Send in Neptune, please,
Michael.
Ah, shit, boys, stay back.
Stay back, boys!
Get back. Forget the Guildhall.
The water's coming.
Come on, Jim! Jim, watch!
Run, boys!
No, Gerry.
Gerry, come on, aye?
We need stones.
You're making matters worse.
Will you get back?
Fuck off!
Go on, go on, go on.
Go on, we're all going.
Deep in my heart...
Nice and slow.
...I still believe...
That's... That's much better.
...That we shall overcome
Someday.
Give yourselves a hand there.
That's it, folks.
Free Derry Corner, that's where the meeting is.
Going to Free Derry Corner.
Get away from there, come on.
Come on, this way.
Neptune seems to have cleared
William Street.
The main body have disappeared down towards Rossville Street
Ieaving behind a hard-core element of hooligans who have now gone up to 12, up to 13 and again, a large element at 14.
This is getting bigger.
It's escalating.
Yeah.
Rubber bullets at discretion.
Come on, Gerry.
I can't get caught.
I can't get caught.
You're not going to get caught.
Jesus!
Holy fuck. Keep going.
They're firing at us, boys.
You want to run for it?
Yes, roger that.
I'll give you a sitrep when we get there.
Out.
It seems like the, uh, riots are developing back towards barrier 12 and back up William Street towards Rossville Street.
Let's go round there, see how it's going.
-We are under heavy bombardment.
-And it's now kicking off at 13.
CS gas at discretion.
I repeat: Hostiles within our location...
What are you doing?
I'm trying to use minimum force.
I need to know as soon as you got separation.
This is no good.
They're not moving.
Back up...
-No, we'll go round this way.
-No! No!
We'll go round the other way to the Guildhall.
We're near the Guildhall.
Come this way.
How many yobbos?
-300 to 400 yobbos.
-300 to 400 yobbos.
Okay, perfect.
We're getting close.
Okay.
Right, Sigs, can you give me the radio?
Sergeant Major.
Get the Sergeants in, get the Troop Commanders in.
Hello, Zero, this is Six-Five Sunray speaking.
We're ready.
We want a "go" on the scoop up.
We want to go now on the scoop up.
Over.
You all right, man?
You all right?
I'm choking, man.
You all right, man?
Stay here, all right?
I'm dying here.
Hey, they're taking photographs.
They're taking photos.
Why are they taking photographs?
Hey, Dennis...
We have about 400 to 500 guys rioting.
Hello, Zero.
So, they're in there.
This is Six-Five Sunray speaking.
We're getting close to our scoop-up time, okay?
The yobbos are in there.
I want to see these bastards lifted, okay?
We are ready to move now with three call signs.
Can we go? Over.
Six-Five are to go nowhere.
Six-Five, stay where they are.
...split across to Zero-One-Five and they are being stoned by around the 15 left area.
If we don't go in hard, we're going to have tears.
Do you understand?
You get the guys psyched up.
Rebrief them on the update.
They're not letting us go yet.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Out! Out! Out! Out!
Frances, Frances... here.
Oh, good Lord...
Oh... a shambles.
They broke through the steward's line and kids everywhere.
The Brits then start up...
I mean, why do they... why do they have to overreact?
You know, it's a peaceful march, for God's sake.
'Cause they're scared.
They're scared.
Can you imagine if people started to march in Manchester or London?
It's just so provoking.
Anyway, I think we're...
-I think we're all right.
-It's okay.
Come on!
Let's get our wires cut!
Come on!
-Cut these wires.
-Cut the barbed wire!
-Come on!
-Fucking mick.
Fucking contact!
What the fuck was that?
O.P.'s returning fire, sir.
That wasn't rubber bullets.
That wasn't rubber bullets.
That was something different.
It's John, he's been shot!
He's dead. Come on!
He says someone's shot.
What happened?
What happened?
He's been shot.
The Army shot him.
Jesus, get him up. Help him up.
Go on, help him up.
-Help him.
-Get him up!
You all right, Damien?
Oh, Jesus.
Damien, are you all right?
Who done it?
The Army shot him.
They shot an old man...
Damien, are you all right?
Can you hear me, Damien?
The bastards.
Jesus Christ, a man's been shot.
Bastards shot my cousin.
I can't believe they shot me cousin.
The boys are going in!
I can't believe they shot me cousin.
The boys are going in.
They shot the old man!
Five-Six Bravo, confirm your situation.
What were the rounds we just heard? Over.
Okay, sir, the O.P. has just fired five rounds.
They've inflicted two casualties.
I think it was nail bombs or shooting.
They're getting a lot of aggro.
They got a lot of crowd.
They're firing baton rounds, too.
That's one incoming!
Get down off the wall.
We've just had one round across the guards at the wall, sir.
What the hell are you doing?!
They shot the old man!
It's unauthorized, for Christ's sake.
Get the car here!
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!
They've shot the old man!
They shot the old man.
You fucking bastard.
There's women and children out there!
Get your hands off my weapons.
You bastards!
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
Fucking shot me cousin!
Die, you bastards!
Go on, you bastards!
Fucking shot me cousin.
Go on, bastards!
Brits out! Brits out! Brits out!
I think it's time for the Paras to go in.
They've got a lot of aggro just the other side of the wall.
They've got some kids over there.
Okay.
We should get them down off that wall.
We're not going to get across there if they've got that wall covered.
-We've got to get out of here.
-Okay...
I don't think we'll get the Company across safely.
We'll do it with the vehicles.
So, we're gonna ax this totally?
We're not going over the wall?
No, we'll do it in the vehicles.
Support Company in the vehicles,
"A" and "C" on foot.
Change of plan-- we're not going over the wall.
We're gonna go up James Street through barrier 12 where the Light Air
Defense Regiment is download at James Street and do a scoop up with Charlie
Company at Aggro Corner.
We're moving in two minutes.
Inform the O.P. now that there's a change of plan.
We're taking the Company through barrier 12.
Yes, sir.
We're taking the whole Company.
Hello, Zero. This is
Six-Five Sunray speaking.
We've got to go now on the scoop up or we're gonna miss them. Over.
Colonel, the lads want to go.
We're ready to go.
Hold on, hold on.
-Who's this?
-Six-Five Para, sir.
Six-Five. No. No, wait.
Yeah, he reckons he can pick up some of the hooligans from there. Over.
No, we wait.
Six-Five, tell your Sunray to wait, hold his position.
Fucking people at Brigade!
All right, tell One and Three to move forward to the barriers now, on foot.
We'll go to 12 in the vehicle.
We'll move now.
Okay.
All right, Sergeant Major, let's move now, let's go!
Hello, Zero, this is
Six-Five Sunray speaking.
We are moving forward to the barriers now.
We've got to go. Out.
Right. Let's go.
Move! Move it!
Go on!
Move! Get in! Get in!
-Hoods on!
-Yes!
Canisters load!
Check your gear.
Come on!
Let's go!
Hello, Zero, this is Six-Five.
My Sunray has deployed his units slightly...
On whose authority?
...in preparation for any orders you might have. Over.
Whose...?
Why have One Para moved?
Six-Five, this is Zero.
Hold your position. Out.
I want to... I want to know where this has come from, Mike.
It'll be coming from their Sunray, sir.
Can we tell them to wait at the barriers until we give the word?
...some more gas put down to about a hundred yards beyond the flats...
-I'll push my way through here.
-Go on, Ivan.
-See you in a bit, okay?
-Ivan, I'll go up, too.
You come up.
I'll see you up there.
-Aye, okay.
-All right, folks.
Let us through there.
Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen a nice round of applause, please, for, uh...
God Almighty.
Let's go, Sigs.
Mike, go up to the barrier and tell the gunners to move it now.
Hello, Zero, this is Six-Five.
We're ready to go now. Over.
-Let's go!
-Let's go!
Oh, fucking hell.
Come on, let's move.
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
Come on!
Put your hands together and give a big warm Derry welcome to Eamonn McCann...
Bridget Bond...
...have started to thin out.
We need to get over there...
...Bernadette Devlin...
...and a man who really needs no introduction so I won't give him one:
Ivan Cooper!
Well, we've marched a long way together here, folks.
So, I think
I'll get this started.
Look at this fucking lot.
Just waiting for the off, boys.
It's been a difficult day but a glorious one here in Derry.
All of us wending our way down the hill together.
Men, women and children marching.
Mrs. Hammer, I haven't seen you march like that since '68.
But, uh...
Iet's not forget, in all this confusion that we face a choice as a society.
Not about what we want.
We all know what we want:
Radical change.
The dismantling of Stormont and an end to Unionist domination.
Yeah, find out if call signs One and Three are in position and ready to move.
Hold in your position.
We are not clear, okay?
Barrier all right?
The choice is about how we achieve it.
Between violence and nonviolence.
At where, barrier 12, barrier 14 or at Aggro Corner?
If we are going to give a future to the children of this city the young lads up there-- there they are we all know they're rioting away there.
They do it every day-- if we are gonna give those boys there a future we have to show them that nonviolence works.
Go on, you scumbags!
Let's get out!
If we don't, it won't be just stones they're throwing.
Because civil rights isn't the soft option... not when the bricks fly and the police and the Army batons charge down.
It's not easy keeping to the nonviolent road when other people say,
"This isn't working.
Let's get the guns out and take revenge."
Fucking shot my cousin!
But if you believe in the civil rights movement with all your heart and your soul, as I do...
Why on earth aren't they going in?
Hello, Zero, this is Six-Five.
If we don't go now, we're gonna miss them.
If you believe in what Gandhi and Martin
Luther King believed in with a passion, as I do, then in the end with one single united march, we shall overcome.
Thank you.
We're gonna have to go, aren't we?
Sir, you have as much separation as you're gonna get.
Yeah. Thank you, Charles.
Thank you.
You cannot send them now.
You've got thousands of marchers out there and you've no idea where they are.
Let me handle this.
Look, you've won, for God's sake.
You've stopped the march.
You've won.
Don't do it, Patrick.
Don't do it.
Load that battle gun, mate!
Stick one of them rubber bullets straight into 'em when we get out there.
Come on, come on.
Six-Five wishing to move now, sir.
Yes, thank you.
...will be seen today, disbursed with the crowd.
Michael...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bernadette Devlin.
We are a part of a worldwide movement for civil freedoms.
We are protesting against internment of people.
Tell Wilford it's just one company to pick up the yobbos and no running battle up Rossville Street.
Coming through to barrier 14, sir?
Yes. Did you log that?
I'll do it on the secure link.
Thank you.
Six-Five, this is Zero. Come in.
Six-Five, Wilco. Out.
Okay, you're on, let's go. Move!
All call signs, this is Five Niner.
Prepare to move.
Move, move, move, move!
We're going in, boys!
Let's go, let's go, come on!
We're away.
Hey, guys, don't fuck about.
Don't fuck about.
Straight in there.
We're gonna hit 'em hard.
We know who we're picking up.
Go on, One Para.
Go and get them, and good luck.
You scumbags!
Here they are, here they are!
Fucking hell, Gerry.
Get out of here.
There they are.
...against these people.
What's going on down there?
Christ, Ivan, they're coming in.
Stand your ground, people.
Stand your ground, people.
We have a right to be here.
Bastards!
Fuck's sake.
Ah, fucking hell!
Fucking bastards!
Look at 'em.
There's thousands of them.
Free Derry?
Stand by.
Fucking Free Derry.
Go! Go!
Let's get a search team!
Let's go in there.
Sergeant Major, let's get a search team in there.
Jesus Christ, it's the Paras!
Help! Help!
Get those fucking bastards!
We have to stop here!
They're covering the whole wall.
Up in those blocks of flats.
Jesus, get down, get down!
Watch yourselves, boys.
Get down.
Let's move in!
The shit's hitting the fan now.
Get back on our side of the barricade.
Stand your ground.
It's only rubber bullets, and they're firing above your heads.
We will not be moved.
Ivan, I don't like the look of this.
Get the fuck out! Get out!
Get out, you lazy bastards!
They're firing live rounds!
This is not a hoax!
Get down! Get under cover!
Get under cover!
Keep going, behind the lorry!
Come on!
Get under cover!
Get under cover!
Go on, you Protestant fuckers!
Ah, don't tell me mammy.
Shoot me, you bastards!
Shoot me!
Get down, people.
Get down! Get down! Get in!
Tell them to stop shooting.
In the flats, there's a contact by the left flank!
-Left, where? Where?
-By the flats!
That's all I can hear!
Fucking hell, get your head down, will you?
What the fuck are you doing?!
Somebody move that way!
Back, back, back. Go on.
In between the lines!
Move back!
Go, go, go, go, go, folks, go!
We need to get the kids off the barricade!
Jesus Christ, someone tell those folks to get down!
Lads, get down!
Behind the barricade!
He's got a weapon!
Jesus, they've shot a man!
Can you help him?
Get down! They're shooting live bullets! Get down!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
They've got a weapon!
There's no gunman on the barricade!
There's nothing there!
I can't see any fucking targets!
No, sir, there's...
There's no targets!
My God, they're shooting children on the barricades!
Jesus Christ, what are they doing?
Christ, stop it!
They're shooting them in the back!
They're just picking them off!
Only aimed shots.
What are we firing at?
I can't see any fucking targets!
Oh... oh, they've just shot that young lad down!
You fucking bastards!
Come on, you're going to have to get him out.
Get him out! Keep going!
Come on, Gerry!
Get off the barricade!
Get off the barricade!
Get off the barricade!
They're shooting at the barricade!
They're shooting at youse!
What's his name?
What's his name?
Michael Kelly.
Michael, you're okay.
We're going to have to get out of here.
They're gonna come for me,
Hamish.
They're moving off the barricade!
They're going round to the courtyard.
Let's go! Come on!
Cease-fire.
-Cease-fire.
-Cease-fire.
Cease-fire.
Let's get out!
Let's get out!
They've just called a cease-fire.
We have to get away.
They're coming for me, Hamish.
They're coming for me, Hamish.
They're going to come for me,
Hamish.
They just called a cease-fire!
Cease-fire!
They're shooting people!
I have to go. I can't stay!
I have to go!
Jesus!
I have to go. I can't stay!
They're shooting at peop...
-Wait!
-Please, let me go!
Young fella!
Jesus, don't shoot!
I'm not armed!
Don't shoot! We're...
Fuck! Let's get out of here!
Dave, I'm going...
I've been shot!
I've been shot!
Oh! I've been shot!
Call an ambulance!
Jesus Christ, come on!
Oh, look at that steward there.
No! What is he doing?!
They've hit him!
They've hit him!
He's got an armband on!
No, get back, Barney!
Barney, no!
Oh, no, no, no!
Barney, no!
No, I've got to go to him.
Please, Ivan, no!
Stay. Stay back!
Jesus! Ivan, come back!
Get down!
Get back, get back!
Get back! No!
Stay back, back,
Barney, for God's sake!
Barney!
God... Jesus Christ!
God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Barney?! Barney?! Barney?!
Ivan!
Zero, this is Nine-Four.
A sitrep at 16-15, uh, on William Street.
Uh, seven people caught by Six-Five are in the area of Rossville Street...
They've gone in.
The Pigs are in this area, sir.
...two shots.
I repeat: Two shots at one of our patrols on the city wall, at 16: 14 hours. Over.
They've gone all the way in.
Six-Five, this is Zero.
Repeat: Request immediate sitrep. Over.
Zero, this is Six-Five.
The, uh, two sub-units moved in got involved in a firefight.
Uh, shots appeared to come from the Rossville flats.
The two sub-units have now gone secure in that area.
And two civilians are lying wounded or dead-- we're not sure yet-- in the area of Chamberlain Street.
Who shot them, we don't know.
Over.
Right, get him up.
Come on! Get down!
This man is dying!
Go on, get him in.
Get him in!
Steady on so, here.
He's fucking bleeding.
Shot badly.
Put him down.
Is there a doctor around?
Somebody call a doctor!
Stand still!
Stand still!
Keep your hands up!
Keep your hands up!
Stop it!
Put your hands on your heads!
Brian, Phil, we'll take these!
Right, put your hands on your heads!
Okay, does anyone know this man's name?
Oh, it's Willy. I know Willy.
Willy, this is your doctor here.
How are you?
You're okay, Willy.
Just relax there for me.
Tell me mammy I'm sorry.
Tell me mammy I'm sorry.
Okay. He's been hit here, folks.
Does anyone know this man in the corner?
His name is Jim.
Can you hear me, Jim?
Mammy, I'm sorry.
He's not breathing.
Is he all right?
Tell me mam...
Mammy, I'm so sorry.
Barney!
They shot my son.
They shot my son.
They shot my son.
Oh, Barney!
Let's get these bodies moved!
Right, men!
Let's go!
And move! Fucking move!
Move!
Move. Why don't you bloody move it?
Sergeant Major!
All fucking mad.
How many rounds you get down?
Oh, fuck me--
I had to change magazines.
I took a guy out by the phone box and there was one crawling away and I got him.
Lovely, sorted, mate--
I just went in with the first two rounds.
Well, I reckon I had four or five rounds, actually...
How many rounds have you used?
I reckon I've done a mag.
...shed loads.
I had to change me mag.
What the fuck did you do?
...adrenalin was pumping our nerves.
I saw it.
I saw you shoot civvies.
You was there, Lom-- you see what we done.
All civvies are terrorists, mate.
Terrorists?
I never even saw a gunman!
Keep an eye out on the flats.
They were shooting.
They were there.
You know what happened; you were there with us.
Aye, I saw what happened.
Listen here, listen here, be quiet.
We went round there, we see loads... there was about a hundred people.
-We see a gunman.
-At least, at least.
We see a gunman, we went left and right flanks and we took 'em out.
You know what happened, right?
Get the story right
'cause this is bound to come over.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm happy with that.
Okay?
Get O.C. mortars over here now.
Okay, give me a sitrep, and then I'll come down.
Firstly, why have you got no comms?
Why is there no radio operator?
They both want an interview with you, right now.
Okay. I'll be down there in 15 minutes.
I've got, uh, bodies on the barricade-- three at least dead.
Um, there was a revolver man there, fired some shots at us.
Good. Have we got the weapon?
-No, sir.
-We have no weap...
I want to get a clearing patrol down there now.
We need to secure that area.
We need to get the weapons off the shooters on the barricade.
Right, sir.
Company Sergeant Major.
Sir.
I've got to go and see the general and the TV cameras.
We've just fired a fucking horrendous amount of ammunition.
We've got to know why and we've got to have some weapons.
Right, sir.
Sir.
What's the situation on the barrier?
Picked up three, uh-- three...
Looked, looked fucked, sir.
Gray as hell. Uh...
So we have three dead confirmed?
Three dead, three confirmed.
Let's get them back to the RMP to confirm
Did you find any, anything on them? Any weapons?
Nothing. No, no weapons there at all, sir.
Have you searched the barricade?
You've searched the barricade?
As quick as we could, sir, yeah.
The pockets.
-There's no hidden weapons?
-Nothing.
-Empty cases?
-Nothing.
-Fuck's sake.
-Okay.
We fired three rounds... um...
Okay, who were you engaging?
No one, sir. I was firing at...
What do you mean, "No one"?
There was...
The crowd was advancing, sir.
I had... I had no backup.
I had to move the crowd.
"C" squadron were... arresting, uh, guys further back.
They-They were all just coming at us.
I had to move them back, sir.
So you put down rounds to warn the crowd?
A warning shot?
To move the crowd.
Okay, we will talk about that later.
People are alleging on the Bogside that the Army went in today, firing indiscriminately.
Let's get this absolutely clear.
One Para went in and came under fire.
They did not fire back until they were fired at.
I believe we fired three rounds after receiving something between ten and 20.
Three rounds? It seems, that seems a very low figure.
I mean, I've personally seen three dead bodies here today.
Well, of course, they may very well not have been killed by our soldiers.
We have three dead bodies.
There were another three casualties inflicted by mortars...
All right, that's all right.
That's all right.
Colonel, General Ford is saying it's absolutely urgent that you speak to him now down at barrier 12.
You must go.
I think most of the gunmen are up there.
I'm gonna go back to the general and the press with the three dead.
You've got to find some justification.
-We're working on it now.
-All right.
I'm securing here.
I'll report back to you as soon as.
Seven-Six. I can see some photographers at the Rossville flats.
They're taking photographs of a civil rights banner covered in blood. Over.
Michael.
Sir.
Just get them out of the Bogside.
Uh, Six-Five, Roger.
I'm doing that now. Over.
Just get them out now.
Uh, Six-Five, this is Zero requesting immediate pullback.
Repeat, requesting immediate pullback, please. Over.
Very good, sir.
Six-Five out.
Five-Zero, this is Six-One Delta.
Uh, the ambulance has just gone across the diamond and is now moving along Ferry Quay Street. Over.
...there is still a body
Iying just south of the Rossville flats.
Zero, this is Six-One Yankee.
One ambulance just now crossing the Great Albion Bridge from west to east.
And you call that minimum force?
Another ambulance has just crossed the bridge the other way. Over. the other way. Over.
You've solved the situation before with regular troops.
Why the Paras today?
Because I think the situation in Londonderry has got completely out of control-- two policemen shot last Thursday
81 incidents in the last few weeks.
Something had to be done to reinforce law and order.
But why was it considered necessary to use, uh
Iive ammunition instead of rubber bullets?
Who made that decision?
I'm sorry, but the aggression was brought to us.
It was quite clear that our men were attacked on the barriers by the hooligans who got out of control in the parade...
And yet no soldiers were hit.
...throwing bricks and stones.
Sir, was there a need to kill innocent civilians?
My understanding is absolutely clear that the Paras were fired on and returned fire.
-Were any...?
-Both high-velocity and low-velocity bullets were used.
Were-Were-Were any soldiers hit?
-Uh, not to my knowledge.
-Not to your knowledge.
When can we have a statement by?
We will give you a statement as soon as we can.
Colonel Tugwell.
Uh, Five Niner, Roger.
That's it, Sergeant Major.
They're pulling us out of the Bogside.
Simon!
Guys, they're pulling us out.
Lead on.
Move out!
There seemed to be a very large number of casualties today,
Colonel Wilford.
You must understand that, uh we've only just finished this operation.
We do not know exactly, uh, what happened, at this stage but there are certainly three people killed.
Don't you think you might have used excessive force today?
Well, what is force in a situation like this?
If they fire on us, we're gonna fire back and they know that perfectly well.
But you think the operation was justified?
Of course.
Do you have no regrets at all about the operation today?
Absolutely none.
-None whatsoever?
-None whatsoever.
-Please...
-He's all right.
-...tell them I'm sorry.
-We're bringing him out now.
They've done that. Get him out.
We're going now.
Going out, you know.
Go, go, go, go, get the fuck out of here.
Come on, get him in.
Come on, lads.
Come on! Get him in.
All right, come on, lads.
Hang on, hang on, you're all right, hang on.
-Gentlemen.
-Steady, steady.
-Gerry?
-You're all right.
Go, go, go.
Go on, boy. Go with him.
You go. Go on.
Hang on there, son.
You're gonna be all right.
Can you hear me?
Just try to keep easy there, boy.
You're gonna be all right now.
Look at me.
Oh, fuck, a roadblock!
Okay, just stay calm, stay calm.
You stay calm.
Oh, Jesus Christ, the Brits are fucking everywhere today.
Come on, get out the car!
Get out now!
We've got an injured man!
We've got to get this man to hospital!
We just wanna get him to hospital.
He's been shot.
You're fucking up!
Go up against the wall!
Move on!
This one's dying, mate.
Scratch one player.
Ah, he's not carrying, Sarge.
By the fucking wall!
I won't tell you again!
Stop looking around!
Wait there by the wall!
Do it!
Come on, get through, get through!
Come on!
All right.
Yeah, Ivan Cooper, MP.
Member of Parliament for this area.
Ivan Cooper.
Please, I just need to get through.
I'm calling on the families now.
Where are you going, mate?
Ivan Cooper, Member of
Parliament for this area.
Please, I need to get through.
I've already spoken to some of your superiors.
You can't go through there, mate.
I've spoken to your superiors already.
Please, can you let me through?
Thank you.
I've spoken to your superiors.
I'm a member of Parliament.
Do we have no list...?
You-You have no idea of casualties yet?
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me.
Excuse me...
Are youse... are you just...
Listen, are you...
How many are in there, Father?
Six here, there's six here.
God Almighty.
There's six here.
Listen, you can't just leave them
Iying like bits of meat here!
There's no room!
Frances, there's six bodies down there.
I don't know who they are.
None of them are Barney.
-They're not Barney.
-Paddy Doherty?
Excuse me,
I've been in here already.
-I'm a member of Parliament.
-We've been through it already.
There are six down there.
-None of them are Paddy Doherty.
-Not Paddy Doherty?
They're not Barney McGuigan.
That's eight.
Don't know how many there are.
Ivan, Ivan.
Have you any word about Michael Kelly?
Michael Kelly?
I'm gonna... I'm trying to find out all that now.
Michael Kelly.
Ivan, help me find me brother Jacky.
Who? What's his name?
Jacky who?
Jacky Duddy.
Okay, Jacky Duddy,
Michael Kelly...
Michael McDaid, if you can do anything about Michael McDaid.
Michael McDaid. I'm trying to find out, okay?
Dirty bastards!
If you can, get the numbers down.
Do we have a list yet?
Do we have it?
Kelly, Kelly, is there an Andy Kelly?
I'm trying to find out, okay.
There's 13 dead...
13 dead.
...14 wounded.
How many?
Are they male or female?
I've the list. I have the list.
Are they male or female?
We're gonna have to start letting people know.
Everyone take a family and let them know.
Where are those Duddy girls?
Murdering bastards!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look after the Duddy girls.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Where's that man?
Excuse me, please!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Michael Kelly's away.
Michael Kelly's gone.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Please, please, please, please, stay back, stay back.
Show some respect for the dead, please.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Jesus, Ivan.
What are we gonna do?
My wife...
Those bastards...!
Oh, no...!
No...
They shot my da!
Miss Fuller! Fuller...
Give him a seat, Fuller.
This is a nightmare...
Where the fuck are ya?
Where the fuck are they?
They don't know.
Fuck off, would you?
And, uh, uh... so, I took my brig right uh, through to Glenfada Park, uh, to cut off the crowd and when we got round there, there was... there was masses.
There was about 100 people round there.
Uh, straight away,
I saw one guy who looked... who was about to throw a bomb in my direction.
Are you sure of that?
Definitely, sir.
Uh, I took immediate action.
I dropped to one knee and took, uh, a well-aimed shot to the shoulder and the-the shot hit the nail... the guy with the nail bomb, in the shoulder.
As I came round the corner, two gunmen shot across me and I identified, I think it was a-a short M-1 carbine.
Yeah.
I dropped to one knee, took three aimed shots.
Petrol bomb was thrown...
Ianded about ten,
15 yards away from us.
Uh, no one was hurt.
Then there was a second one already lit.
I shouted to him to stop, stop, put it down... fired a couple of shots.
He went down.
Can't say if it...
Fired a couple of shots?
How many shots?
Four, sir.
Four? And you hit him?
Best of my knowledge, sir, yes.
How many rounds did you fire at him?
Uh, 22, sir.
22 rounds?
Sir.
How did you fire 22 rounds?
That's more rounds than they issue you with.
Quick, come on...
Move, come on.
Get round this other...
Get round the other side and tape it.
Quick, before anybody sees us.
Get down there.
Go on, move.
Can we get some explosives experts over here, please?
Hello, Zero, this is Four-One Alpha.
We've got suspected nail bombs at my location.
Send Felix now.
Zero, this is Five-Four Arthur.
Um, one dead person, who was returned to this location has a nail bomb in his pocket.
We request Felix to come down and sort it out. Over.
One round returned as the gun was spotted there but no hits claimed. Over.
Where did they come from?
We should go fucking home.
No problem, no problem.
You're okay, guv.
Lomas, come.
Shut the door behind you.
At ease, Private.
Sit down.
I'm W2 Norton.
This is Sergeant Bridge.
We'll be taking your statement.
CSM is here for your benefit.
In your own words could you please tell me exactly what happened?
I could see through the front of the Pig that there was a, um, a rubble barricade somewhere in front, at the end of Rossville Street with about thousands of people behind it all screaming and shouting.
We, um, stopped and debussed just outside the barrier.
I went on to the right-hand side of the road opposite the, um, Rossville flats, which was to our left.
As we were going up the right-hand side there was, um, some sort of commotion on the left where-where we assumed a contact had taken place.
Then my, uh, section commander shouted that there was a sniper on the barricade and, um, he-he-he returned fire.
Private Lomas, did you, at any time, see the target?
I did, um, swing my rifle to bear around the corner of the wall and that's when we saw what I believed to be a-a gunman firing... holding a firearm towards our direction.
My platoon commander shouted that he saw 50 possibly more of the rioters on the barricade break right towards the Glenfada Park area and ordered my section to go towards that area and cut them off.
When we, um, entered the park, there was a lot of confusion.
We saw a lot of people and, um, l-I didn't witness the beginning of the firefight.
At what point was the cease-fire order given, please?
Before or after the shootings?
The cease-fire was given after the last shots were fired in Glenfada Park.
Private Lomas, in your opinion, were all the rounds fired in accordance with the yellow card?
Yes, sir.
Well, of course, the, uh, the loss of life is, um is greatly to be regretted, but I cannot help but think that we responded to a-a-a very difficult situation... and, at least,
Londonderry tonight, uh would seem to be quiet, which suggests that we've moved one step in the right direction of the recreation of law and order.
Now, the main point
I want to make is that have I seen nothing today that reflects in any way with discredit on our forces who have behaved, as ever, with restraint and, I believe, great professionalism.
So, please, uh, convey my thanks to the men, Pat.
Uh, you, of course, will be in charge of the inquiry-- um, issues of timing, when the Paras went in, things of that nature.
Uh, my role on the day, of course was purely as an observer.
Have you anything to add?
No, sir. No.
Congratulations.
The war against the IRA will go on.
Thank you, gentlemen.
If you want me, sir,
I'll be out here.
Thank you, Michael.
If you just give us a moment.
People... people, please.
People, please, could you just give us a moment?
If you just have a seat quietly for a moment we'll issue you with a full statement presently.
And we will take some questions afterwards if you'll just please bear with us.
Just have a seat there for a moment.
Thank you.
Uh, this afternoon, 27 people were shot in this city.
13 of them lie dead tonight.
They were innocent.
We were there.
This is our Sharpeville.
This is our Amritsa Massacre.
A moment of truth and a moment of shame.
And, uh, I just want to say this to the British government:
You know what you've just done, don't you?
You've destroyed the Civil Rights Movement.
And you've given the IRA the biggest victory it will ever have.
All over this city tonight young men, boys... will be joining the IRA and you will reap a whirlwind.
Thank you.
Mr. Cooper, what do you say to those people that might be joining and what message do you want to give to them?
I feel very ill-equipped to do any preaching to them after today.
The names of the dead are as follows:
Patrick Joseph Doherty, age 31...
Gerard Vincent Donaghy, age 17...
...John Francis Duddy, age 17...
Hugh Pius Gilmore, age 17...
...James Gerard McKinney, 35...
William Anthony McKinney, 26...
Kevin Gerard McElhinney, age 17...
...Bernard McGuigan, 41...
Michael Martin McDaid, 20...
Michael Gerald Kelly, 17...
...William Noel Nash, 19...
James Patrick Wray, 22...
John Pius Young, 17.
Have the families of the dead been informed?
They have... they have been, uh, notified at this point, yes and, uh...
Actually, gentlemen
I think that probably the best thing is we adjourn just for a moment.
We have some distressed people.
So if we can have a little sensitivity just until we...
I think we can, uh...
Wait until you get outside.
She was saying, "Where's Jack?"
Wait till you get outside.
Don't say anything till you get outside.
I'm sorry, can you just step aside for one minute, please?
What am I going to say to Barney's family?
There is nothing you can say.
What am I going to say to Barney's kids?
There's nothing any of us could say.
...yourselves.
You all saw it.
You saw it, you saw it.
And I would say...
I would say to yourselves to British journalists go home to your people, to your government and tell your people what was done in their name on the streets of Derry today.
The paratroopers moved in last night and waited in the streets of Derry to mow us down.
And I would just like to say this on behalf of us the families of the victims and the victims that we will not rest until justice is done.
Excuse me?
- I asked if you've...
- We heard you.
What makes you think we're suffering from a lack of sexual activity?
Starfleet forbids officers from fraternizing with subordinates.
Unless you've been violating regulations...
Those regulations don't apply to you.
Have...
...you been suffering?
On Vulcan, we mate only once every seven years.
That's a hell of a dry spell.
Why are you suddenly so curious about this?
It's my understanding that your mating ritual is effective in easing tension.
That hasn't always been my experience.
And you think that we need our tensions eased?
Efficiency's down three percent.
We've all gone about ten months without a break.
I think it's normal for people to get a little sloppy.
Perhaps it's time the crew takes shore leave.
Well, I like the sound of that.
I took the liberty of locating a suitable planet approximately nine days from our present location. It's called Risa.
What's your idea of suitable?
It's tropical, with an abundance of pristine beaches.
You'll find more information in the Vulcan database.
- Is it populated?
- Yes, by a humanoid culture receptive to easing tension.
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"
"It's been a long time"
"But my time is finally near"
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"
"I will touch the sky"
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"
"I'm going where my heart will take me"
"I've got faith to believe"
"I can do anything"
"I've got strength of the soul"
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"
"I can reach any star"
"I've got faith"
"I've got faith"
"Faith of the heart"
If you're wearing that to impress the women on Risa, you may as well stay onboard.
Rule number one:
You've gotta be seen to get noticed.
And I plan on getting noticed.
Don't say she didn't warn you.
- Figure out your itinerary yet?
- I think I'm gonna pass.
Captain, you need this as much as I do.
Nobody needs this as much as you do.
The ship will be nice and quiet.
I've got some astrometric surveys that have been piling up.
It'll be a good chance to get work done.
We're going to a planet with over 200 registered Nuvian masseuses, and you're gonna sit in your cabin with a bunch of star charts?
Mr Tucker has a point.
You think I need a massage?
The safety of this ship depends on its captain being at his most efficient.
I suppose I could read those surveys on a nice beach.
Incoming transmission from
Starfleet Command.
Transfer it to my Ready Room.
Her name's V'Lar.
She's the Vulcan ambassador to a planet called Mazar.
If you don't mind my asking, admiral, why is this our problem?
Apparently, it's imperative that she be taken of that planet as soon as possible.
The nearest Vulcan ship is at least a week away.
Do they expect us to take her all the way back to Vulcan?
You'll rendezvous with the Vulcan ship
Sh'Raan in three days.
They'll take her the rest of the way.
Any idea what the emergency is?
Well, this may come as a shock to you, Jon, but the Vulcans aren't talking.
Imagine that.
Thank you for volunteering your quarters.
I'm happy to do it.
I'm looking forward to meeting her.
I imagine she'll spend most of the journey alone, engaged in meditation.
But if it seems appropriate,
- I'll ask if she'll meet with you.
- Thanks.
- If there's anything else I can do...
- If you wouldn't mind taking that.
Ambassador V'Lar is accustomed to a Spartan environment.
Hoshi, thanks for giving up your cabin.
I just hope it's Spartan enough, sir.
- Everything set?
- I believe so.
I've prepared this to familiarize the crew with the necessary protocols.
We should assign a steward to attend to her needs.
"Don't address the ambassador unless spoken to first.
Don't offer to shake hands.
Refrain from laughing in her presence."
Those guidelines are largely precautionary.
I doubt the crew will have much opportunity to interact with her.
You seem to be pulling out all the stops.
I'm simply following the protocols used in dealing with an ambassador of V'Lar's distinction.
Well, she'll be here soon enough.
- Let me know if you need any help.
- Thank you, captain.
Entering orbit, sir.
We're being hailed.
It's the Mazarite High Council.
Someone's in a hurry.
- Captain Archer?
- I'm Jonathan Archer.
Are you prepared to receive
Ambassador V'Lar?
That's why we're here.
If you'll transmit your landing coordinates to us, we'll send down a shuttlepod.
I'm looking forward to the visit.
I regret there won't be time for that.
The ambassador is already on her way to your ship.
A small craft's approaching, sir.
I assume the Vulcans have informed you of the urgency of this matter.
They said it was important that we pick up the ambassador as quickly as possible.
They didn't say why.
V'Lar has been expelled for abuse of her position and criminal misconduct.
- Captain Archer?
- Ambassador.
On behalf of my crew, I'd like to welcome you aboard Enterprise.
Thank you.
May I take that?
That's very thoughtful, captain.
This is Commander Charles Tucker, my chief engineer.
- Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure is mine, commander.
And this is my science officer,
Sub-commander T'Pol.
But please, I've been anticipating the opportunity to practice my English.
I hope you like your quarters, ambassador.
T'Pol tried very hard to anticipate your needs.
Fortunately, my needs are few, captain.
I am curious, though, who previously occupied the cabin?
The odour.
The human scent is difficult to mask.
Actually, I was hoping to meet the crew member, in order to thank her for allowing me to disrupt her routine.
I prefer not to inconvenience anyone if possible.
That philosophy has served me well in the diplomatic service.
T'Pol tells me you negotiated the first territorial accords between Vulcan and Andoria.
The Andorians required a somewhat firmer hand at the negotiating table.
But I was younger then.
That was before we even made contact with Earth.
That was over 90 years ago.
How long have you been a diplomat?
Commander Tucker,
I understood that on your world, it is considered bad manners to ask a lady her age.
Well, I wasn't...
I didn't mean to imply that you were...
Forgive me, commander.
My attempt at humour.
Suffice it to say that with T'Pol and myself here, you're almost certainly dining with the two oldest people on this ship.
I hope, ambassador, that you regard the charges against you with less levity.
Of course I do.
How do you intend to defend yourself?
There is no defence.
Are you saying you're guilty?
- T'Pol.
- It's all right, captain.
A person in my position carries the trust of all Vulcans.
The fact that the Mazarites believe that trust has been compromised justifies T'Pol's concern.
I'm afraid my age is betraying me, captain.
Would you mind if I retired?
Of course not.
I've never been to Earth, but I find the humans I have encountered quite unpredictable.
I'd be interested in hearing about your experiences there.
Another time, perhaps.
I understand.
This is your cabin. I'll say good night.
T'Pol.
I sense your anger.
You presume that my time with humans has left me susceptible to their emotions.
They're our emotions as well.
We simply hide them better.
If you're sensing anything from me, it isn't anger.
No.
Disappointment.
Good night, ambassador.
- T'Pol.
- Captain.
Is there a problem
I should be aware of?
I assume you're talking about
Ambassador V'Lar.
You were a bit abrupt with her.
If you believe I was rude,
I'll convey my apologies.
I don't pretend to understand Vulcans.
I never have.
But I wouldn't be a very good captain if I didn't know when something was bothering my science officer.
It's uncommon for a Vulcan to commit a crime.
Uncommon, but not unheard-of.
Unheard-of for a person in Ambassador V'Lar's position.
We don't know what she's done.
It doesn't matter.
If she were innocent, she would've insisted on staying to defend herself.
You seem to know a lot about her.
I've met the ambassador before, though she clearly doesn't recall.
It was many years ago on Vulcan, during my early schooling.
She had just negotiated the Treaty of Ka'Tann, and I travelled a great distance to see her.
Was it worth the trip?
The ambassador inspired me to choose a direction in my own life, a path that led me to the
Science Council, and eventually here.
I've had a few heroes in my life.
It's never easy when one of them lets you down.
Vulcans don't have heroes.
No, I'm sure they don't.
Captain, can you come to the bridge?
On my way.
An unidentified vessel, sir.
Fifty thousand kilometres and closing.
- They're hailing us.
- Let's find out who they are.
- What can we do for you?
- My apologies, captain.
There's been a change of plans regarding Ambassador V'Lar.
We weren't told.
We've been having some problems with our long-range communications.
What's the change of plans?
The magistrate feels that we let the ambassador go too quickly.
She's needed for additional questioning.
We don't wanna cause you any more inconvenience.
If you'll drop out of warp, we can dock with you and take the ambassador aboard our ship.
Your magistrate seemed in a big hurry to get rid of her.
Now he wants her back?
I'm just a transport captain.
I never try to make sense of what government bureaucrats are thinking.
I'll have to contact my superiors.
There's really no need.
I'm just a starship captain.
You don't think they'd trust me to make these kinds of decisions on my own.
We'll wait for you to confirm whatever you have to.
Get me Starfleet Command.
I can't get through.
That ship's jamming all our com frequencies.
"Just a transport captain."
- They're charging weapons.
- Polarize the hull plating.
What the hell is he doing? Hail him!
He's not answering.
- Port hull plating's off-line.
- They're closing fast.
Aft torpedoes. Return fire.
No effect. They're using some kind of energy shielding.
Direct hit to Engineering, subsection 12. We've taken damage.
Would the phase cannons be more effective?
Undoubtedly.
But we can't fire them at warp.
- What do you mean?
- Particle discharge, sir.
It would destabilize our warp field and most likely blow out both nacelles.
I've been working on the problem, but I haven't quite...
Drop to impulse.
Deploy the aft cannon.
- I've got a lock.
- Fire.
Their shields are failing.
See what you can do about their engines.
They're dead in the water, sir.
Not dead enough.
- Resume course. Warp 4.
- Aye, sir.
Any idea what that was all about?
Well, I think we know someone who might.
We were asked to pick you up and deliver you to a Vulcan ship.
No one said anything about getting shot at.
You have no idea who they were?
Obviously they weren't sent by the council on Mazar.
Then who sent them?
I have no answers for you.
Ambassador, we're here at the request of the Vulcan High Command.
It would be illogical for you to withhold information from us.
There are diplomatic matters at stake here which do not concern you.
To tell you any more would only put your ship and your crew at greater risk.
How much greater could it get?
A few more volleys from that ship would've ruptured our hull.
I'm sorry, captain.
So am I.
You're leaving me no choice, ambassador.
- Archer to Mayweather.
- Go ahead.
Change of plans, Travis.
Lay in a course back to Mazar.
Sir?
- You heard me.
- Aye, sir.
You're under strict orders to transport me to the Sh'Raan.
It's more than two days to the rendezvous point, and there could be other hostile ships tracking us.
Unless you can convince me why it's worth risking all our lives...
The Vulcans are raising holy hell about this, Jon.
You can always order me to take her to the rendezvous point.
You're out there, I'm not.
It's your call.
I just want you to know there'll be repercussions.
They certainly considered the repercussions.
They knew someone was after her.
Why risk one of your own ships when you can risk one of ours?
- Jon.
- They're doing it to us again, admiral.
- Keeping us in the dark.
- Have you talked to the ambassador?
- I've tried.
- Maybe she brought this on herself.
You did say that she admitted the charges against her were true.
I don't even know what the charges against her are.
Well, I'll talk to Soval, see what I can find out.
- You really enjoy this, don't you?
- Replacing power couplings? Hardly.
No. I mean, having people shoot at us.
If you must know,
I much prefer the shooting back part.
I thought this mission was about peaceful exploration.
I need something to do on this ship, commander.
Fair enough. I'm just hoping we don't keep you quite so busy.
I read those Nuvian masseuses have 12 fingers...
...on each hand.
Then I'd say Starfleet needs to make its presence known on Risa.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Not at all.
We were just talking about my quarters.
I was wondering why they were so sparsely decorated.
If you need anything, it can be brought to you.
Oh, I don't want to be waited on.
And since I doubt I'll be travelling to Earth any time soon,
I decided to spend a little time with my hosts.
Thank you for the use of your quarters.
You'll have them back soon enough.
Sub-commander.
Have you tried iced tea?
I don't care for it.
Captain Archer certainly does.
It's flavoured with passion fruit, an appropriate ingredient for him, don't you think?
It was the captain that I wanted to speak to you about.
He's a most intriguing man.
He deserves to be told the truth.
Will you join me?
Please.
We'll be back at Mazar in a few hours.
I'd prefer not to waste that time alone.
This must be awkward for you, having a foot in two worlds, loyal to your captain, yet still a Vulcan.
You can make things easier for him.
The High Command has requested his assistance.
It doesn't seem unreasonable to ask why.
You believe Captain Archer can be trusted?
Yes.
Even though he clearly doesn't trust us?
He's resentful.
Why?
He believes we held back their development of warp technology.
We've kept many things from them, all for good reason.
But situations like this only reinforce their resentment.
If we expect to continue our relations with humanity, we have to earn their trust.
I would not have succeeded at my career for 94 years without earning people's trust.
I meant no insult.
Of course not.
You were simply speaking your mind, as you always have.
It was at Vulcana Regar, wasn't it?
During the second Ka'Tann conference, you approached me during a recess.
- You remember.
- You were not easy to forget.
Your questions about my negotiating tactics were quite presumptuous coming from one so young.
I apologize if I acted inappropriately.
Not at all.
In fact, your bluntness made me reconsider some of my positions.
Much as it has now.
T'Pol,
I have something to tell you.
Come in.
Something wrong?
I took the liberty of speaking with Ambassador V'Lar.
Go on.
Any luck?
The ambassador and I spent the last two hours talking.
She's even more remarkable than her reputation suggests.
I don't doubt that,
- but it doesn't affect my decision.
- I believe it should.
She's not guilty of the crime she's been accused of.
She told you that?
The charges were fabricated to get her off Mazar and divert attention from her actual mission.
- Which is?
- She can't reveal that.
But she's convinced me that it's critical we help her accomplish it.
I'm sorry, T'Pol, but I'm gonna need more than that.
She also told me that if we return her to Mazar, she'll be killed.
- By who?
- She wouldn't tell me.
- But you believed her?
- Yes.
Why?
I can't accept that she'd sacrifice a lifetime of accomplishments with an act of criminal misconduct.
- It happens all the time.
- Not to her.
We must take her to the Sh'Raan.
You're asking me to put the lives of everyone onboard in jeopardy based on your talking to this woman for a couple of hours.
Captain...
...since I've served aboard Enterprise,
I've never asked you for anything.
I'm asking for this now:
Don't return the ambassador to Mazar.
Please.
Thank you.
Our Mazarite friends, sir.
And they've brought company.
Why didn't we see them coming?
Our aft sensors are still out of alignment.
They're targeting our engines.
We could drop to impulse, use the phase cannons.
And go three against one?
You're familiar with the Mazarites.
- What's their top speed?
- Comparable to Starfleet.
I don't believe they've exceeded warp 5.
Then let's give them a run for their money.
- Travis, increase speed to warp 4.8.
- Aye, sir.
Warp 4.8.
They're matching our speed and accelerating. Warp 4.9.
They're closing to 20,000 kilometres.
Fifteen.
Travis?
Warp 4.9.
They're holding at 4.9, sir.
How far to the rendezvous point?
At this speed, a little over two hours.
But I don't think we can hold it that long.
Can we get a message through to the Vulcans?
- The Mazarites are still jamming us.
- Keep trying.
That Vulcan ship better not be late.
Captain?
What's our situation?
We're being chased by three Mazarite ships.
Will we reach the Sh'Raan before they can do any more damage?
I'm not sure.
In that case,
I need to speak with you.
I have to consider the possibility that this mission will fail.
You still haven't told me what this mission is.
I've been under orders to tell you only what you need to know.
But that wasn't the only reason
I kept things from you.
I didn't trust you.
As your Mr Tucker pointed out,
I have been around a long time.
I remember when news of your people first reached Vulcan.
I was fascinated by humanity, but worried as well.
You hadn't even met us.
You had just emerged from a global war.
The idea that you deemed yourselves ready to join the interstellar community seemed...
...premature.
And a century of good behaviour hasn't changed your mind?
The Mazarites pursuing us are criminals.
They are members of an organization that's infiltrated all levels of government, making themselves wealthy and powerful, at the expense of many innocent victims.
Their methods include eliminating anyone who stands in their way.
And that would include you?
Many Mazarites want their government purged of this corruption.
They asked the Vulcan consulate to help them expose these criminals.
And that job fell to you?
I have been gathering evidence against them.
In three months,
I will be called to testify.
It was decided that, until then,
I would be safer on Vulcan.
Why couldn't you tell us?
The investigation was considered too sensitive.
And the story of you being recalled in disgrace...
It was hoped that if my reputation were sullied, they would not consider me a credible witness, and they might not come after me.
Obviously, it didn't work.
The corruption ran deeper than I thought.
I appreciate...
...you telling me the truth.
I can no longer put you and your crew in danger, captain.
Please drop out of warp.
It hasn't gotten to that yet.
It's the most logical course of action.
If you've learned anything about humans, you'd know...
...we don't always take the most logical course of action.
Captain, report to the bridge.
- They're hailing us.
- What's our status?
Holding at warp 4.9, but
Commander Tucker doesn't believe we can sustain it for more than another ten minutes.
I don't believe they can either, sir.
They're releasing drive plasma to keep their warp coils from overloading.
Open a channel.
Captain. Ambassador.
- What do you want?
- Just giving you a friendly warning.
Are you aware that your engines are overheating?
So are yours.
We have no quarrel with you.
Give us the Vulcan and you'll be free to go.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you slow down before your engines explode.
Why would you risk the lives of your crew for this criminal?
I've been ordered to deliver her safely to the Vulcans.
And that's exactly what I plan to do.
They're increasing speed.
Warp 4.95.
They're re-entering weapons range, sir.
Archer to Engineering.
Please tell me you're ready to slow down.
Sorry, Trip, but we need a little more speed.
I don't know how much more
I can give you.
- It's called a Warp 5 engine.
- On paper.
We don't have any choice, Trip.
Aye, sir.
Ambassador.
Warp 5.
Four-point-nine-three.
Nine-five.
Don't take your eyes off that antimatter stream.
Yes, sir.
Four-point-nine-seven.
They're matching our speed.
Four-point-nine-nine.
Warp 5.
They're still gaining on us.
How far to the Vulcan ship?
Their jamming signal is disrupting our sensors as well.
Then use their last known position and do the math.
Take a guess.
If we could maintain our present speed, approximately 53 minutes.
The Mazarites will be in firing range long before then.
What if we could get a message through?
Tell them to get here as fast as they can.
The Sh'Raan is capable of warp 7.
If we could maintain warp 5, we'd reach them in 12 minutes.
Hoshi.
Any way you can get a message through the interference?
I don't see how, sir.
There's a diplomatic frequency we sometimes use.
It's in a lower subspace band.
I doubt the Mazarites are aware of it.
It's been a few years since I did this.
If we do get a message through to the Vulcans, we don't want the Mazarites to see them coming.
We could try deflecting their jamming signal, sir.
Use it to blind their sensors as well.
- See what you can do.
- Aye, sir.
Hoshi?
We may have gotten a message through to them, sir, but I'm not sure.
Wouldn't they respond?
Tucker to the bridge!
- Go ahead.
- The port injectors just blew!
- We've gotta slow down, captain!
- I got it! I got it!
- Hoshi?
- The com just went down, sir.
They're right on top of us.
- How long?
- Eight minutes.
That's a direct hit to our starboard nacelle.
We're dropping to impulse.
They're hailing us.
How long now?
If they received our message,
- another ten minutes.
- I thought it was down to eight.
That was before we dropped out of warp.
We can't hold off their ships for that long.
You've done your best, captain, and I thank you for it.
But it's time for me to turn myself over to them.
We just need to buy ten more minutes.
- Captain...
- I want you to go to Sickbay.
- Sickbay?
- I'll explain later.
If there was ever a time to start trusting us, this would be it.
Put him through.
Give us the Vulcan.
You know, I honestly didn't think you'd be able to catch us.
Just out of curiosity, how fast do your ships go?
Put her on a shuttle and bring her to our lead vessel.
That could be a problem.
Our shuttlebay was damaged, thanks to you.
I doubt we could launch a shuttlepod until it's repaired.
What...?
What would you have topped out at?
Warp 5.5?
Warp 6? I can't imagine you could do much more than that.
Your engines were starting to run pretty hot.
Prepare to be boarded.
Malcolm, I'm counting on you.
T'Pol.
Okay.
Where is she?
Your last attack blew out systems across half the ship.
Power's down in Engineering, a plasma conduit exploded on E Deck.
I didn't ask for a damage report.
Where is she?
I was getting to that.
Her quarters are on E Deck.
She was no more than ten metres away when the conduit blew.
Her injuries are extensive.
Plasma burns, neurological trauma.
I wanna see her.
This is Dr Phlox.
- The Vulcan?
- Undergoing dermal regeneration.
Open it.
I will not.
I don't know what business you have, but when she was brought in, she became my patient.
If I remove her from the imaging chamber prematurely, she'll die.
Open it.
- Yes?
- Our sensors just went down, captain.
- What's causing it?
- Enterprise is redirecting our jamming signal.
No!
Report!
Answer me! What's going on?
I imagine they have their hands full right now.
I believe that's the Sh'Raan.
She's a Vulcan combat cruiser.
One of their most powerful, if I'm not mistaken.
Sir, the captain of the Sh'Raan wants to speak to you.
Put it up.
Captain Archer, are you in any danger?
You could say that.
Tell the Mazarites to turn their weapons over immediately, or we'll destroy their ships.
We'll be standing by, captain.
Thank you.
We did what we came to do.
That's all that matters.
I am sorry to disappoint you.
I look forward to adding this incident to my testimony at your trial.
Captain's starlog,
February 9th, 2152.
The Vulcans have allowed the Mazarites to leave.
Ambassador V'Lar says there's a good reason for doing so, though she's certainly not sharing it with me.
Someday I'd like to walk into a room without it seeming like a state visit.
Occupational hazard?
I'll be along in a moment.
Thank you, captain.
I'm sorry for the trouble
I've caused you and your crew.
We're glad we could help.
I sense a great bond between you, a bond of trust and respect.
But also...
...a bond of friendship.
I think it bodes well for the future relations of our two peoples.
Goodbye, ambassador.
Live long... and prosper.
German bandits at two o'clock!
Increase throttle! Power dive!
Spell it right, Rafe.
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.
- Thanks, wingman.
- Yeah, sure.
Whoa, bandits!
Crack shootin', Danny.
Crack shootin', Rafe.
- Land of the free.
- Home of the brave.
Great flyin',Dad!
Come on.
I'm gonna teach you how to fly.
I get the front!
No, you take the back.
I'm bigger, and I should be in front.
I'm older, and I'm teachin', so no.
Wow.
It's like we're really flying.
Yeah, I did it lots of times.
Come on, you man the guns.
I'll give her some throttle.
We gotta get those dirty German bandits.
Oh, gosh!
- Hang on!
- Make it stop, Rafe!
I've seen my dad do this lots of times.
Don't worry!
Rafe!
Oh, my gosh! We're flying!
We're flying!
Whoa! Uhh!
Wow.
My dad's gonna kill me.
Come on.
Yes! Whoo-hoo!
We flew!
We flew! Yes!
I'm a pilot!
- I know!
- Yeah!
We flew.
- You no-account boy!
- Daddy-
I done told you, you spend time playing... with this stupid boy can't read... you ain't never goin' to amount to nothin'!
He ain't stupid, Daddy!
Daddy!
Ohh!
Come on!
Uhh!
Get on back home. Now!
Get on up.
You got work to do.
Come on! Come on, get on home!
Uhh!
You let him alone!
Daddy, no!
I will bust you open, you dirty German!
What'd you call me?
I fought the Germans in France.
And I fought 'em in the trenches.
And I pray to God no one ever has to see... the things that I saw.
You're my bestfriend.
Daddy, wait!
Daddy, wait.
Adolf Hitler... builds the German military machine... and drags all of Europe into war.
But even while France falls to Hitler...
America still refuses to join the fighting.
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.
Alright, Danny.
Now let's show 'em how to fly.
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?
This ain't the farm, and these ain't no cropdusters.
I'm not playing chicken with you.
Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what-
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.
You can turn, or you can hit me.
It's up to you.
What the-
Oh, boy.
Why you always bustin' my ass, Rafe?
Which way you goin'?
I guess I'll go right.
No, uh, left. I'll go left.
OK, we're goin' left, right?
Ri-uh, right. Right?
Right like we're goin' right, or right like we're goin' left?
Well, now you got me all mixed up!
I don't know.
Make up your mind.
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!
Aah!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Those are some smooth aces.
Did you say something?
'Cause let me tell ya, those farm boys are grounded!
Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable use... of m-m-military aircraft, sir.
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.
Get those hedge-hoppers in Doolittle's office.
After two years of training... you believe that a $45,000 airplane... is there for your amusement?
No, sir.
I was just trying... to keep my edge, Major.
And when you did the outside loop last week... what did you think that was?
Honing your skills?
That's not training, McCawley.
That's a stunt.
And I personally consider it to be reckless... and irresponsible.
Major...
How could that be, when you're famous... for being the first man in the world ever to do it?
Don't get cute with me, son.
No, sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful.
I just think that- well, I-
It is reckless and irresponsible... if you're just doing it to be a show-off.
But I was doing it to try to inspire the men, sir... in the way that you've inspired me.
I believe the French even have a word for that... when the men get together to honor their leaders.
They call it an homage, sir.
- A what?
- An homage, sir.
That's bullshit, McCawley!
But it's very, very good bullshit.
Thank you, sir.
McCawley, you remind me of myself fifteen years ago.
Which is why we need to discuss this.
Have a seat, son.
The British have accepted you into the Eagle Squadron.
You're on your way to England tomorrow... if you still want to go.
Huh. Wow.
Just a few British pilots are all that stand... between Hitler and total victory in Europe.
They're gonna need all the help they can get.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.
Just for the record...
I'm supposed to ask you to reconsider.
Sir?
Sooner or later we're gonna be in this war... whether we like it or not.
And I'm gonna need all of my best pilots.
So it's my duty to ask you to stay.
Major, what would you do?
If it was me...
I'd go.
Get out. Am I going bald right back here?
Ooh!
Man, I am one good-lookin' son of a bitch.
Don't you ever die.
Die. That's exactly... the concept you gotta work tonight.
You put a drop of this clove oil under your eyes... and you let 'em sting and well up.
You get your nurse alone, take a breath... let her see your eyes glisten... and say, "Baby, they're training me for war...
"and I don't know what'll happen...
"but if I die tomorrow,
I want to know...
"that we lived all we could tonight. "
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.
Come on, before the rest of his hair falls out.
How could you do this?
Well, Doolittle assigned me.
He wanted me to get some real- real combat training in.
Well, guess what?
It's not training over there.
It's war.
Where the losers die, and there aren't any winners- just guys who turn into broken-down wrecks... like my father.
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.
But I feel like
I got a duty to go.
Don't preach to me about duty, damn it.
I wear the same uniform you do.
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.
But why go looking for it?
God, Danny, come on.
I'm gonna be twenty-five.
I might as well be an old man.
They're gonna have me bein' a flight instructor.
I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rolls.
I wanna be a combat fighter.
Hey, come on!
The nurses can't d- d-dance by themselves.
Let's go.
If the call of duty means seeing 150 men... in their underwear every day... we are here to serve.
I can't believe it.
Saturday night in New York City.
Do you know what they're doing where I come from?
Nothing.
Cow-tipping.
Well, that's why you joined the Navy, hon'.
To get out of that dusty little town and see the world.
May I remind you, Barbara, we're Navy nurses, not tourists.
I joined to do my patriotic duty and... to meet guys.
Me, too.
Girls, we're gonna have so much fun tonight in the city.
You've gotta tell them the story, Evelyn.
What?
Oh, come on. Tell us.
Oh, it's such a long story.
We got time.
I saw it happen.
Well, it was about four weeks ago...
What do you think is b-b-better?
All in the one cheek, or spreading them out?
OK.
Fusco, Anthony.
You all right, buddy?
Sweetie, do you really have to do this?
I'm not gonna get yellow fever in my barracks.
No? If you'd rather, she can do it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just gimme a minute.
Honey, the government says stick 'em, we stick 'em.
Uh!
Hey, Red, you alright?
Eye exam number four?
Listen, Doc, I have passed a dozen medical checks.
You write that, they won't let me fly.
Sorry, son.
I'm gonna fail.
They're gonna take my wings away.
No, they won't. Just relax.
Read the bottom line, please.
Just keep practicin' the bottom line.
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.
J- L-M-K-P-O-
Next.
Ma'am.
J- L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.
Slow down, flyboy.
And, instead of the bottom, read the very top. Both eyes.
Yeah.
"C"- sorry, "J."
Ahem. "C"...
- "W."
- "W."
- "Q."
- Uh, "Q."
Uh, "'Q."'
Read the bottom line again, please.
But read it right to left and every other letter.
"E."
Heh. "'X."'
- X-E.
- X-E.
X- E, ma'am.
Ma'am, I know how this looks.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I really am.
But Army and Navy requires 20/20 vision.
Oh, i-it's-it's not a problem with my eyes.
I mean, I can see.
I mean, I can hit a running rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.
I got a problem with letters, that's all.
Well, maybe after some schooling... you could come back and take the test again.
No, I had schooling.
I mean, I-the teachers just never knew... what to make of it.
It's just letters.
I mix 'em up sometimes.
That's all.
I mean, I just get 'em backward sometimes.
L- look here. Uh, my-my math and-and spacial reasoning... and my verbal scores are all excellent.
But you barely passed the written exam.
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.
Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna be an English teacher.
But I know why I'm here.
To be a pilot.
And you don't dogfight with manuals.
You don't fly with gauges.
I mean, it's all about feeling and speed... and lettin' that plane become like a part... of your body.
And that manual... says that a guy who's a slow reader can't be a good pilot.
That file says I'm the best pilot in this room.
Ma'am, please, don't take my wings.
Well, I felt so bad.
Evelyn, rotate to station three.
I had no choice.
I passed him.
- Good.
- Uh-huh.
So, then this cocky pilot comes back.
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.
"Yeah"? Boy, you're talking to an officer.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.
Ma'am, I didn't get a chance to thank you.
Drop your skivvies.
Ah, oh, OK.
Just like this?
That's fine.
He did have a very cute butt.
You know, I know you didn't have to pass me... and you did. And I just-
I didn't think you'd understand, and you did.
You know, you still haven't said thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.
You're like my hero now.
Actually, my father was a pilot.
And, um, I've seen first-hand what happens... when a pilot loses his wings.
You know what?
Your father's my hero, then, too.
Infact, as an officer,
I think it'd by my duty... to take my new hero's daughter out tonight...
Just to-aah!
Gosh, did I poke too deep?
I think you hit the bone there.
You are so mean.
What? So is- is there any chance... that you might, kind of, sort of... you know, like me, or...
Oh, how did you guess?
They never taught us... how to deal with this... feeling.
Wh-what feeling?
Well, it's kind of like... this.
Ow!
Well, he was getting fresh, so I poked him again.
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.
Hold on a second.
Miss...
I really, really lick you.
What did he mean?
Like you.
I didn't mean to say that.
And I just, um...
I just want to ask you, please, if I can donate dinner.
He started to act very strange.
Or, well, buy you dinner.
This isn't your chart.
Whoa.
No. That's the, uh, this, uh, fellow over here's.
I think he left.
Have you already had this shot?
Yeah, well, once... already.
Well, I wanted-
I mean, can I ask you out?
No!
And he just went wham!
Unh!
Oh! What'd you do to him?
Poor guy.
Hey!
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?
Uh, yeah.
I'm fine. I feel great.
This is just standard precautionary... thing.
Look, I got some, uh, genuine French champagne... from France.
I thought, you know, maybe we could celebrate.
Celebrate what?
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well, you being my hero, for one.
OK. Why not?
So, uh, ahem...
I wanted to thank you.
And I just wanted to, uh... put your mind at ease about passing me... because I really do think you did this country a service.
I mean, I'm-
I am a great flier.
And if you have a fault, which you obviously don't... it's modesty.
No. If I have a fault, it's candor.
You are just so-
Uhh. Cork just got away from me.
God, oh, it hurts.
It hurts something fierce.
I'm sorry.
- Ohh...
- Oh, it's bleeding.
- God.
- Oh!
- Ohh!
- Lay still.
I ruined everything.
- Lay still.
- Oh, it hurts.
- Ow! It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.
Yeah. I can't breathe.
Lay still.
You are so beautiful it hurts.
It's your nose that hurts.
No. I think it's my heart.
And then I kissed him.
Oh, Evelyn.
That's the most romantic story
I ever heard.
It's been the most romantic four weeks and two days of my life.
Oh, I'm so jealous.
Hello, Lieutenant.
- It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.
Pick a hand.
It's beautiful.
What's in your other hand?
Mine.
Well, it took me six hours to fold these.
Oh!
I want you to meet my friends.
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra-
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.
Would you happen to have any friends?
Huh. Take your pick.
Hi.
Whoo!
We ever get in this war and somethin' happens to me...
I can't tell you how good it makes me feel to know... that someone as sweet as you will be there... to nurse me back to health.
Good, but we're not in the war yet.
- Ahem.
- OK. That was a bad line.
Hi.
I'm-I'm Red.
Red-
S- s-s-s-strange.
Heh heh.
Your last name's Strange?
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.
No. It-it's Winkle.
Red is such a ladies' man.
Do you always stutter?
No. Only when I'm-
She's totally buying it.
- Nervous?
- Yeah.
Why can't I get something like that?
Hello.
Hi.
Danny seems kind of shy around the girls.
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.
He's just, ahem... a little unsure of himself, you know.
His old man used to run him down a lot.
Get him in a plane, he's sure of himself.
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.
He's my right hand.
Which at the moment is a long way south of my waist.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess I lost a little altitude.
Yeah, I guess you did.
Excuse me.
You and me, we got to talk.
So, the rumor is the Navy's shipping us to Pearl Harbor.
Well, won't be so bad.
It's about as far from the fighting as you can get.
You'll get a sun tan.
So maybe the Army'll post you guys there, too.
You... are a super special woman.
And, and, well...
Well, they're- they're training me... to be a big bad warrior, and, well...
So, I mean, you never know what might happen tomorrow... or... or any day after that, you know?
So...
God, we need to make tonight super special.
Why are you crying?
I guess it's the thought... that I might not ever get to see you again.
Dry your eyes, toots.
Tonight, you're mine.
I don't want to be with a crowd tonight.
I just want to be alone with you.
Well...
How does New York Harbor by moonlight sound?
Ohh! Heh heh!
Are you gonna be a bad influence?
Of course I'm a bad influence.
Let's see if we can commandeer this vessel...
'cause we're, uh, officers of the U.S. Government.
Not for long, we won't be.
One day, we'll take a trip on a boat like that.
Would you like that?
We'll be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grandsalon.
No one's talking about war.
They're just dancing to Cole Porter.
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah.
Careful now.
Here, sit down.
Now let's see here.
Ah! There we go.
See, this is as close as I could get you to your ship.
So, at least I tried, right?
Actually, you know what?
This is better.
Yeah, it is.
God, you're pretty.
What's gonna become of us all, Rafe?
Well, the future's not exactly in our hands, is it?
No. I guess you're right.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
That was not part of the date.
Watch your step.
Oh, thank you.
Evelyn!
Guys, come up! Come on up!
Come up! We're in 321.
There's something
I got to tell you.
Well, you got no secrets from me, Lieutenant.
I've seen your medical chart.
Here we go.
This can't be good, or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Yep.
I got to go away.
We're all going away.
Yeah... but I'm going to the war... tomorrow.
I'm flying with the Eagle Squadron.
It's an outfit the British started for American pilots.
I don't understand.
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?
They didn't order me.
I volunteered.
Huh.
But I passed you.
I let you through.
And now you volunteer... for the most dangerous place you could go?
It's not your responsibility, not your choice.
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.
I mean, everything in my life has led me up to this point.
Meeting you.
I love you.
I love you so much.
Let's go inside.
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just-I-I can't do this.
This just-it's not right.
I'm sorry. I just-
See, I can't do this.
I mean, I mean, I can.
I- I want to.
I'm not trying to be noble, you know.
Or not saying
I know what would happen... or just-
I need to stop talking.
I just-I just don't want-
I just don't want it to be like everybody else.
I don't want you to have anything about tonight... that you regret.
I mean, it's been the most incredible night of my life... and I don't want to ruin that.
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.
See, that's what I want to come home to.
That's what I want to have to think about and dream about.
I want to know that the best part of my life... is still ahead of me.
Look.
Don't, um... could you... not come see me off?
Because, uh... saying good-bye to you once is hard enough.
Here.
Take this.
Why?
You think it looks good on me?
I will come back.
I thought you said you told her not to come.
Yeah, I did.
Why you looking for her then?
It's my test.
If I tell her not to come, and she comes anyway... then I-I know she loves me.
All aboard! Track 57!
If, uh, anything happens to me...
I want you to be the one to tell her.
All right?
You just make sure and come back for the both of us, all right?
OK.
See you when I get back.
Yeah.
Good hunting, Rafe.
Evelyn!
Evelyn!
Evelyn!
Evelyn!
Evelyn.
Hey!
She loves me.
The German Luftwaffe... relentlessly bombards downtown London... while Churchill's
Royal Air Force... is in a deadly struggle... to maintain control of the British skies.
This is a real mess.
Lieutenant McCawley reporting for duty, sir.
Good.
We'll get you settled into your quarters.
And then introduce you to the crate you'll be flying.
If y'all are patching up bullet holes here... maybe we ought to skip housekeeping... and get me in an airplane.
Two didn't come back, sir.
We counted only eleven.
Are all Yanks as anxious as you... to get themselves killed,
Pilot Officer?
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.
This is yours.
Good chap.
Didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine.
Please be seated, gentlemen.
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.
Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you.
How long is America going to pretend... the world is not at war?
We've increased food and oil shipments, Mr. President... and as far as I know-
What they really need are tanks, planes... bullets, bombs, and men to fight.
But our people think
Hitler and his Nazi thugs... are Europe's problem.
We have to do more.
Send the Brits and Russians more of our ships... and anti-aircraft weapons.
And keep cannibalizing the Pacific Fleet?
What choice do we have?
We're building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs.
This is so exciting.
You know there's about one hundred ships on Pearl.
How many sailors per ship?
It depends.
More on a battleship than a sub.
But say, on average... 2,000?
Then there's the flyers, the marines, base personnel.
I'm still working on the sailors.
Girls, I think the odds are in your favor.
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.
It's paradise.
See you on the beach, boys!
We're in Hawaii!
Hey!
You're not supposed to paint titties... on the side of my airplanes.
And if you do, don't make 'em lopsided.
They were lopsided, Earl.
Look, it says right here.
"Never ride waves amongst rocks or submerged pilings. "
See, it says you shouldn't do that.
How do you know they're submerged if they're submerged?
Gooz, what in the hell are you doing?
Just trying to fix this surfboard thing.
He keeps taking chunks off his nose on the rocks.
On my day off, I'm working on my new invention- the Gooz Cruise Fin.
I'm gonna be a rich fella.
Every surfboard in the nation's gonna need one.
Yeah? Well, you're gonna need a broom.
Check out these new recruits.
Hi.
Aloha.
Y'all pilots?
We're working on it.
It's a lot of switches and stuff.
Pride of the Pacific.
Who are you?
Terrors of the skies.
Welcome, ladies.
Hi.
I have to deal with toasty sun burnt fanny... before I can show you around.
Ow!
Dear Evelyn.
It's different than I thought it would be here.
It's cold- so cold it goes deep into your bones.
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.
That is to think of you.
I just wish I could be back there with you.
It's not easy making friends.
Two days ago, I had a beer... with a couple of the RAF pilots.
Yesterday, both of them got killed.
Dear Rafe.
I miss you so much.
It's so strange to be half a world away from you.
I'm right on his tail!
Got one!
Every night
I look at the sunset... and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day... and send it from my heart to yours.
Family?
Girl, sir.
The girl.
A lot of people frown on the Yanks... for not being in this war yet.
I'd just like to say... if there are many more back home like you...
God help anyone who goes to war with America.
Atten-hut!
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...
Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.
Sharp presentation, Captain.
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.
For four months now Washington's been blowing pink smoke... about the threat from Japan.
Could make us lose our fighting edge.
I'm determined not to let that happen.
With your permission, Captain.
Admiral, urgent, from Washington.
I'm supposed to keep this fleet... battle-ready to take on the Japanese... cover half the damn globe.
Now they want me to transfer... another twelve destroyers to the Atlantic.
Don't they know what we're facing out here?
They feel Europe is the greater danger.
I'm assuming these risk assessments include Hawaii?
Pearl Harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.
We're surrounded by sub nets.
All we need worry about is sabotage... so we bunched our planes together... to make them easier to protect.
Distance is our ally, Admiral.
You analysts got it all figured out, don't you?
The smart enemy hits you... exactly where you think you're safe.
Incoming!
I fixed the hydraulics and electrics, sir... but the oil hoses still need attention.
Just crank it, Ian!
God speed you, sir.
Red section, take the bombers.
Blue section, look out for the fighters.
Bombers dead ahead.
Let's drop in and give 'em a reception.
Red Two, follow my lead, high side.
Go right at the lead bomber.
Following you, Red One.
Good hit! Good hit!
Red One, coming around, reset for the kill.
I have the middle bomber.
Hammer down!
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.
I got two M.E.s dead ahead.
I'm on him.
I'm on his tail.
Hammer down.
I got one of them!
I got another one.
Red One, you got fighters all over your tail!
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up! Pull up!
Argh! I got an oil leak.
Can't see a damn thing!
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!
I can't bail out!
He's on my tail, Red Two.
I'm hit! I'm hit!
Mayday! Mayday!
Oh, my God.
I'm no good at church.
What do you mean, sweetie?
When I'm up there getting my slate wiped clean...
I'm thinking how to dirty it up again.
Wow, this from a virgin!
I got to inventory supplies.
Kill me now.
Could you be any more boring?
Don't bother.
Sunday, she writes Rafe... ten pages instead of the usual five.
Gosh, I wish I was in love.
Hey, sweetheart.
She hates me.
Good to see you, Red.
Good to see you, too, Betty.
You wanna come for a ride?
Come on.
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!
You hit pretty hard... for a cook.
All right, Walker, who you got?
I'll take the cook.
Why? You don't like money?
Come on! Get out there now!
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.
Against a mechanic?
That guy craps rivets.
How's it feel up from the engine room?
Sunlight botherin' you?
Ow.
Man, he's getting all busted up!
Move! Move!
Come here, we gotta talk.
Get down here.
He can't hurt us.
He can hurt us.
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?
That's a scratch. See this?
This is the hard-earned greenbacks... of every pot-scrubbin' chop in this fleet.
Now if we don't win...
Teeny here has to find another battleship!
I'm not going back to the Arizona empty-handed.
Don't worry about the money.
I'll send that smug engine-fixin' snipe... back below decks where he belong.
We the man!
He slapped your mama!
Be a son of a bitch!
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!
That's enough. That's enough.
- Oh! Where's my money?
- Nah, fight's rigged.
We're rich! Ha ha ha!
How'd you get this?
Boxing.
Did you win?
Yes, ma'am.
What do you get for winning?
Respect.
So, why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?
I left my momma in Texas... and joined the Navy to see the world... become a man.
They made me a cook.
Not even that.
I clean up after other sailors eat.
Two years, they never even let me fire a weapon.
Well, let's hope you never have to.
Yes, ma'am.
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.
You, too, ma'am.
You know, he taught me to fly.
I always knew that no matter what trouble I got into...
I'd never be in it alone.
He'd be there with me.
He was always pushing me to be better and faster.
He told me you were a great flier.
It was the same night he told me... he'd volunteered to go to England.
Volunteered?
He... he told me he'd been assigned.
He was always trying to protect me.
But you know what?
I look at myself in the mirror in this uniform... and I still don't know who I am.
I look like a hero... but I don't feel like it.
Rafe... he always looked the part, didn't he?
He couldn't wait to be one.
To Rafe McCawley.
The best pilot... and the best friend
I ever knew... or ever will know.
To Rafe.
THUR Look at this.
The Japanese... are flooding the Pacific with radio traffic.
Everywhere from the Panama Canal to southeast Asia.
There's no logical pattern,
Captain.
No. There's always logic.
They know we read their mail.
They're trying to make us think their fleet is moving south.
I'm not buying it.
Something, something's up.
Otherwise, why would they take the trouble to bullshit me?
Evelyn, I signed for these letters for you today.
They're from England.
They're from Rafe.
I'm sorry, Ev.
You know how long it takes mail to get here.
Hurry up!
Show time, boys! Come on!
America still awaits Japan's response... to peace proposals.
Ambassador Nomura arrives in Washington... in what could hopefully guarantee... continued peace in the Pacific.
On the British front,
Churchill declares...
"Give us the tools, and we will finish the job. "
The RAF has fought bravely against...
Hitler's ambition to rule the skies over the Channel.
Victory does not come without sacrifice.
Evelyn!
- Danny.
- Hey.
Some comedy, huh?
Yeah.
It's been a while.
I've been logging a lot of flight hours.
I kinda been avoiding you, too.
Yeah.
- Look-
- Do you-
Do you want to?
Sure, yeah.
I remember one time when I was... like, seven years old...
I was always building gadgets and things.
He wanted me to build him some wings... so he could fly like his daddy.
I told him you can't fly without some kind of engine.
But he wouldn't listen.
"Danny, never mind that, just build 'em anyway. "
So I did.
And I'm up there... strapping these big ol' wings on his back... that we made from paper and glue... and these massive silk bloomers that we stole.
He looked so stupid, and I told him...
"You can't jump off the barn in these. "
And bam!
He busted his leg on a backhoe.
God, I miss him.
Yeah. But don't you think... that Rafe wasn't back up there next day.
Cast and everything... telling me to make some adjustments on those wings.
Check this out!
Crossroads of the Pacific.
Tahiti-1,700 miles!
All right!
Say, Betty...
W- wou...
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?
- Stand up, please.
- What do you mean?
Just stand up.
Stand...
Oh! Ha!
Betty...
Red, come on!
We got a dinner reservation.
Can I get a minute?
What's the matter, you sick?
Can a guy propose?!
Oh! Thank you!
Am I talking too much?
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.
Hold up!
Look at this.
Hello!
OK, let's get out of here.
OK.
I guess I should go.
Don't let it be three months before I see you again.
I had a good time.
Yeah, me, too.
Do you want me to walk you home?
No, I'll be fine.
No... of course.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time... get a cup of coffee or a piece of pie?
What am I doing?
OK.
Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry.
Danny?
Is something wrong?
No! Nothing's wrong.
No problem. Hi!
It's just Danny.
I... just... you... you forgot this.
Oh... thanks.
It was good of you to take the trouble... to drop it over... now.
I... well, I thought you might need it.
You know... maybe tomorrow morning.
If... not that you wear this to work, but...
No... it's a hankie.
Right, right. Yeah.
Listen, I was thinking maybe...
I could come by some time... if I gave you a call, could I come by?
Once, maybe... if you're not busy?
Yeah, maybe.
- Maybe?
- Maybe.
OK, all right.
Thanks.
Good-bye. Good night.
You are such an idiot!
Did you have fun last night?
It wasn't how it looked.
And if it was, it'd be all right.
It's been months.
It's time to move on.
I am moving on.
Ev, don't lie.
All I know is, I hear you crying when you think I'm asleep.
When my dad left...
I was too much for my mom to handle... so she sent me to live with my aunt.
I thought my life was over...
But you don't know where it's all gonna lead.
If I hadn't run away and lied about my age... and enlisted in the Navy...
I wouldn't have met Red, and... now he's my fiance.
Oh, God, I can't get used to that word.
- It's only been twelve hours.
- Oh, Betty!
Little Betty beat us all to the post.
And this is ward three.
As you can see, no patients.
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on, I'll show you the bar.
Sandra, new recruits to torture.
Come on. Excuse me, ladies?
Hi!
We're gonna wait two years until I'm nineteen... and Red can buy me a ring.
Rafe sent his best friend to tell you... so you would be OK, so you can move on.
You gotta go on living, Ev.
Red!
Whoo! Sorry!
Bye, Rafe.
The Japanese Fleet is missing.
They're operating under radio silence.
This footage was shot four days ago on October 28th.
We're sending scout planes in wider vectors... all over the Pacific, but they get nothing.
They could be anywhere in here.
I don't understand how two whole carrier divisions... can just disappear.
Clear!
Aw, we're all over the page.
We got one wall-eyed and one pigeon-toed.
Anthony, tap in number six.
All right.
Gooz, tap in number three.
All right.
Hey. We got a visitor.
Oh... that ain't no Navy issue uniform, eh?
Danny, it's Evelyn.
Jesus!
You alright?
Yeah. Yeah.
No.
I think I'm fallin' for her.
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.
I didn't want this to happen.
It just kind of did.
Can't help it.
Well, Danny, she's gotta be with somebody.
It might as well be you.
You telling me if you were dead... and you saw your best buddy doin' your girl... you wouldn't come back and beat the living crap outta him?
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.
Danny's being a better friend taking care of her himself.
I got a girlfriend.
That's great.
Come on, fellas.
Let's split.
Danny, whatever happens now is just about you and her.
You gotta try and forget about Rafe.
Be careful, alright?
Ladies... cloud the mind.
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.
Hey, Danny.
Where's everybody going?
Just bein' discreet.
Does it seem like everybody's acting a little strange?
No. Nah.
Right.
Well, maybe-maybe a little.
Yeah.
Well, people in this outfit... have way too much time on their hands.
Oh, yeah.
I just hope they don't think there's been something... goin' on between us, that's all.
Oh, no. I mean, no.
That would be... embarrassing, right?
Forgot my wrenches.
That would definitely be embarrassing.
Yeah.
Ha. Forgot my wrenches.
Hey. He really doesn't have to leave.
No.
I, uh, I'm just goin' out with the girls, so...
I guess I'll see you later.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you around.
Shit.
Evelyn.
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?
Of course.
Well... from the air?
You know, I could get kicked out of the military for this.
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.
The Hawaiians called this harbor Wai Momi.
It means "water of pearls. "
It's so beautiful.
My dad took me up a couple of times.
Just don't do what he did.
What do you call it when you flip over?
A barrelroll?
Yeah.
I won't.
Aah!
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Oh, God.
- What do you think?
I like that.
Hey!
That plane was supposed to be back here an hour ago!
Quick, hide in the parachute hangar.
My heart is pounding.
Danny, last night...
No, that's terrible.
Danny, we need to talk about this.
Sir. Evelyn!
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.
Hi.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
I had to see you.
Last night was crazy,
I know, but...
I'm not sorry. Are you?
I don't know.
Danny, I had a wonderful time last night. I-
It's just all too fast.
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down at the beach this morning... and I watched the sun rise... and I knew that everything was gonna be different.
That this was the start of something new.
In this place, in this moment.
And I don't care what anybody else says, you know?
How can I not feel this way?
I kinda like you.
Oh, you do?
You have your tie on crooked.
Everything's gonna be all right, OK?
Everything's gonna be all right.
Do you have any airtours going through the valley of Oahu?
You do?
Aloha.
This is KGMB in Honolulu... on another beautiful fall day here in paradise.
We have enough information.
We are returning home.
Do you ever wonder... if this war's gonna catch up with us?
Nota whole lot.
Every moment we're not together, you're up there training for it.
Yeah, well, I'm training for moments like these...
'cause I have no idea... how I'm gonna get this car out of the sand.
Evelyn, can you please come out of the bathroom?
You've been there for an hour.
Evelyn! What are you trying to do, look like me?
Are you OK?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
No, you-
D'oy.
They call it the vacant sea.
None of the major sea lanes go through it... and you can bury the entire land mass of Asia there... and nobody would know.
From there, they could attack anywhere.
Our last signals intercept... indicate that the Japanese taskforce is heading south... towards the Philippines or southeast Asia.
But Captain Thurman of Naval intelligence here... has his own theory about the missing ships.
Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us... where it'll hurt us the most-
Pearl Harbor.
It's over 4,000 nautical miles from Japan to Pearl.
That's a long distance to steam a navy, Captain.
Your theory is based on what?
Well, it's what I would do.
That's not exactly hard evidence, Captain Thurman.
Well, Admiral, if I had hard evidence... we'd already be at war.
Sir, we can read their diplomatic codes... faster than they can type them.
But Captain Thurman's cryptology team... is still trying to crack the naval codes.
The intercepts have missing words and garbled lines... so to explain the decrypts, we have to try to interpret... what we think they're trying to do.
Interpret?
You mean guess.
They use their informed intuition, sir.
We guess.
It's like playing chess in the dark.
Any rumor, troop movement, ship movement... spine-tingle, goose bump, we pay attention to it.
When I was in the Asiatic Fleet... the locals used to try to get outside of a problem... to try to see the inside.
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.
It's the worst thing that could happen.
A blow to Pearl would devastate... the Pacific Fleet's ability to make war.
So, sir, you would have us mobilize the entire fleet... at the cost of millions of dollars... based on this spine-tingling feeling of yours?
No, sir. My job is to gather and interpret material.
Making difficult decisions... based on incomplete information... from my limited decoding ability... is your job, sir.
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain... so I can make a better decision.
Aye, sir. We are trying.
I wonder if we shouldn't put the Pacific Fleet on full alert.
In case the optimism... of the "Honolulu Advertiser" proves unfounded, gentlemen... what are General Short and the Army... going to do about protecting my ships?
Within a ten-mile radius of your harbor... we have fighterplanes here at Wheeler... bombers at Hickam, and a trainingstrip at Haleiwa.
We've recently established a radar station here... that can detect planes
125 miles out.
Which is a month old, Admiral, and untested.
I've seen these new radar screens, Major.
There's no way of telling whether they're ours, theirs... or a flock of damn birds.
I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo... to somewhere close by Pearl.
There's a call from Tokyo.
They say they don't know you.
Hello? Hai.
It's a local dentist.
He can see Pearl Harbor from his office.
Are there many sailors around?
Uh, the dentist says that the flatships... are not in port.
They're talking about the weather.
He doesn't seem to know who he's talking to.
Hello?
Hello? Moshi moshi.
Hello?
That was a strange call.
Admiral, may I speak to you in private?
Why would a spy use a phone?
They know we tap all international lines.
Our listeners feel it's probably not code talk.
It sounds like someone in Japan is sneaking around... asking a local citizen the location of our carriers.
Well, that makes me feel all warm inside.
Get the FBI on it immediately.
Have we found the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?
No, Admiral. The bases are looking all over the Pacific.
So the entire fleet could be rounding Diamond Head... and we wouldn't know a thing about it.
Get on it.
I'm alive.
This is the first
I could get word out.
Jepense qu'il est mort! ll estencore en vie.
I told you I'd come back.
Here, sit down.
Sit down. Come here.
It's OK.
It's all right.
You're real.
Yeah.
I wished for this every day.
I know. Me, too.
Every second. So did I.
I thought you were dead.
They said you were shot down in the sea.
Yeah, I was.
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.
I missed you.
I got picked up by a French fishing boat... and I was in occupied France, and I couldn't get word out.
And I'm just-I'll tell you all about it, I promise.
But I'm fine. I'm OK.
And I'm here now.
Evelyn...
I just wanted to see you.
You're so beautiful.
I love you.
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back.
It's OK. I won't leave you again, I promise.
Rafe, you died.
And so did I.
I know, but I'm-I'm-
It's fine now. I'm back.
We're together.
I mean, we are together... right?
I don't know where I am.
Rafe.
Rafe.
Stay away.
Rafe.
This is Radio Honolulu... playing the sweetest music... on the sweetest island in the Pacific.
It's a beautiful
December 6th... with beautiful music...
Raaaaafe!
Oh, Goddamnit.
There you go.
A real live ace!
Whoo!
An ace is only five.
I shot down six M.E.s.
And I got two smokers, too.
They don't count them.
Of course, I got shot down myself before they could pin me.
So you got back from behind enemy lines, huh?
What's that combat like?
Were you scared?
Hey! One at a time.
Well, them Luftwaffe boys can fly pretty good.
It's not like, you know, training.
They're, uh...
Danny.
You know, they're all about tactics is what it is.
See, the Nazis, right, they're faster than you are... so they'll disappear and they get up in the soup... and they'll throw like a roll or a hammerhead... and they'll come around on your high side... shoot you from behind- like some Americans will.
Hey...
Gooz, you're lookin' at a real live ace.
Well, let me give you the shirt off my back!
Whoo!
Aloha! There you go!
I'll take it from you.
I can see how y'all been spending your time out here.
Hey, Rafe, we gotta talk, all right?
I got nothin' to talk about with you. Here.
Why don't you have a drink?
I'll make a toast.
To returning from the dead.
Wasn't all I expected, but, well, that's life.
To my best friend and loyal buddy Danny... for keepin' up the war effort back here at home.
Ahh.
You know, where I come from... somebody makes a toast to you and you don't drink... that's sayin' something.
All right, Rafe.
That's how it's gonna be.
To you.
Hey, you guys need to spend some time alone, I think.
Aw, hell, no, Red.
Come on.
No, no, no.
We're celebratin' here.
Me over there fightin'... almost gettin' killed... my friend Danny back here... lookin' after my interests for me.
Y'all know Danny was even good enough... to look out for my girl for me while I was gone?
We thought you were dead, Rafe.
And it gutted us both.
And we were just tryin' to get on with our lives.
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?
You know, you're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.
Well, you're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.
You left her to fight somebody else's war... and you made damn sure that I didn't go with you... and we thought that you were dead-
I almost did die, you little son of a bitch!
And her face was the last thing that went through my mind... so don't stand there and tell me to act like it's all right!
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.
I stayed, and you made sure of that... and some things changed.
And I hope you can get used to that.
Oh, I have to get used to it?
All right. We'll see how I can get used to it.
- Whoa!
- Hey!
Get used to that, boy!
Hey, hey!
And that's my left hand, too!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on!
Melee at the Hula-la.
Send M.P.s!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- You called me a lousy friend?
- Get your hands off!
Aah!
Ow! Shit!
Come on, Danny!
Let's go get 'em.
Let's move out!
Oh, no. They're gonna throw us in the brig.
Let's get outta here.
Oh, shit.
Rafe... you're the only family I got.
When you were gone... it was the loneliest
I'd ever been.
The same for her, too.
Oh, boy, now you're really breakin' my heart.
If you hadn't gone, none of this woulda happened.
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.
Damn it, Rafe.
I just know there's got to be some way... we can work things out so that... things could be right between me and you.
I just don't see how it could ever be the same.
Revered father...
I go now to fulfill my mission and my destiny.
I hope it is a destiny... that will bring honor to our family... and if it requires my life...
I will sacrifice it gladly... to be a good servant of our nation.
Hey... we got a large haze.
That's too big to be planes, right?
Is that what you wanna do?
Knight to knight five?
Boom! Wrong move.
Lieutenant, radar's picking up... a large return moving in from the northeast.
Hang on.
Relax.
It's a flight of B-17s coming in from the mainland.
Nothing to worry about.
A heck of a lot of B-17s.
Good shot, Hop.
This better be good, Commander.
One of our destroyers reports having fired and sunk... enemy submarine attempting to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653.
It's 7:20!
We had decoder delays, Admiral.
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.
"Failure...
"'Peace talks...
"useless. "
Thurman here.
Tokyo transmitting... to their embassy in Washington-
"Discontinue use of your decoding machine...
"and dispose of immediately.
"Special emphasis on destroying important parts. "
Do you read that?
Acknowledge.
Admiral...
Naval Intel intercepted a transmission from Tokyo... to the Japanese embassy in Washington... instructing them to break apart all decoder machines... and burn all secret documents.
The Japanese are expecting a war.
Should we?
Warning of possible...
Japanese aggressive movement in any direction.
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent. "
But where?
Did you ever lose a fight,
Miller?
I been lucky so far, Captain.
From what I hear, it ain't luck.
Ship's proud of you, son.
Ha ha ha. Yeah! Ha ha!
Why the hell's the Navy... doing practice this early on a Sunday?
- Aah!
- Get down!
Go, go, go, go!
I'm with Navy newsreel, and I can tell you one thing- them ain't Navy planes!
All hands, man your battle stations!
We're being bombed!
We're being bombed!
Get up! Get up!
Jesus Christ!
Man your battle stations.
Another dumb drill.
All hands, man your battle stations.
- What the heck was that?
- It's a bomb!
Move, move, move!
Son of a bi-
From outside!
Get me the engine room!
My God.
Take cover!
Down! Down!
Report battle stations!
Manned and ready!
Man your battle stations!
This is no shit!
They just sunk the Arizona!
General quarters!
General quarters!
All hands, man your battle stations!
This is no damn drill!
Go! Go!
They look like Japs.
I didn't even know the Japs were sore at us!
Danny, you just get me to a goddamn airplane!
Holy God!
This is good footage. Did you see that?
Holy cow!
I hope there's still an airfield left.
Hurry up!
What in the world?
Look! So many!
Everybody to the hospital!
Why's the Navy always buzzin' us? shut up, Red!
- Oh, man, come on.
- Red, it's too early.
The Japs are here!
What the hell?
Let's go! Let's go!
- Get corpsmen to the bridge.
- Aye, Captain!
Repair says third deck is flooding port side!
Yaah! Uhh!
Get up!
Get up, you cowards!
Get up there and fight!
Move it!
Take cover!
I got you, Captain.
You radio for air cover!
Initiate damage control!
Find my X.O.
Tell him to assume command.
And you make sure the gunners-
Everyone's where they need to be, Captain.
You trained us well.
Captain...
Aah!
Go, go, go, go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Everybody move!
Get the ammo for that fifty cal!
Get that fifty cal!
Let's go! We gotta get-
Come on, man, we gotta get this thing loaded up!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
Danny, get me into a damn plane!
Come on!
Get some ammo up here!
We need some men on these guns!
Sir! The captain says you're in charge, sir!
We need more ammo! Now!
Send up ammunition for the five-inch guns!
Medic!
All of 'em, now!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Come on!
Aah! Come on!
Come on, you sum 'bitch!
Aah!
Aah ha!
Oh, yeah!
I need a doctor!
Somebody help me!
Get to the supply room!
Get everything out!
- Aah!
- Planes incoming!
Cut 'em down!
Come on, come on!
Get 'em away from the windows!
The mattresses!
Get 'em against the wall!
Take cover!
Is everybody all right?
Can you stand? Can you stand?
Hold your fire!
Get to the gun! Hurry up!
Get down, Danny!
Aah!
- Earl!
- This is Walker!
We need to get those planes fueled and loaded right now!
What's going on out there? Huh?
Danny, what the hell's that noise?
You guys doin' target practice or something?
I think World War II just started.
Go, go, go!
- Billy!
- Run!
- It's gonna blow!
- It's a dud.
It's a dud!
Come on, get down!
Danny!
Danny, are you all right?
I'm all right!
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Gooz, come on, man!
We're sinking! We're sinking!
Stay together!
Close the hatches!
- I can't swim!
- Just hang on!
Let's move it now!
Joe! Go! Go!
We're gettin' outta here!
Get in the car!
Get in! Get in!
Come on, let's go! Go!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Come on!
Where's this place we're goin'?
We got a small mechanic runway about ten minutes away.
Hasn't been hit yet.
We got Zeros on our six!
Duck!
Help us!
Aah!
We're trapped.
Try it! Try the door!
Aah!
Oh, my God! I'm going under!
It's sucking me back!
The current's too strong!
They're shootin' at us!
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!
This is it.
Get us out of here now!
How bad?
It's still not over, sir.
An entire fleet at anchor.
My God, my God...
Barbara, fill every syringe you can find with morphine!
Fill up the kitchen!
Are you listening to me?
Fill up the kitchen!
Over there! Over there!
We got a bad neckwound here!
Surgery! Move!
Get him to surgery!
Oh, God.
In here!
He's still bleeding!
Another hemostat!
Hurry!
Give me a hemostat now!
Damn it, hurry!
Gimme another hemostat!
Another suture! Hurry!
Give me a-
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
Doctor!
Here! Aah!
Am I gonna die?
Nurse!
Don't leave me!
Doctor! Get over here!
My fingers are plugging his artery!
Doctor, what do you need?
Focus, look at me.
What do you need?
- Hemostat.
- Hemostat.
Here. All right, look at me.
You're going to be all right.
You're going to be all right.
I need more ammo!
I need more ammo, ladies!
I need more ammo!
Earl! We good to go?
- Mostly, but-
- Get down!
- Shit! Get cover!
- Jesus!
- Come on, you guys!
- Earl, get in here!
Sergeant!
We need more than a shotgun!
You got any other weapons for coverfire?
Inside that ammo locker!
- Come on!
- Move it!
- Go! Go!
- Get the guns out!
You said the planes are mostly ready, but... but what?
She's down, she's broke, she's shit.
I got four left.
One's good, two need ammo, one needs fuel.
Fall out and load up in the bunker!
Let's go! Get down!
- Move!
- Get ready to roll this thing!
Get down! Now!
Anthony, Red, you stay here and man the fifty-caliber.
Gooz, get to the next bunker and lay down some coverfire.
Planes.
Should we fire?
Stay down! God damn it!
Hold your fire!
Stay still! Nobody fire!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
They don't know we're here.
- Stay down.
- Fire?
No, God damn it, stay down, stay still.
Don't fire.
Oh, God.
I don't see any ordnance.
I think they're going home.
No. They'll be back. We still got planes on the ground.
Pilots, listen up.
Get all the speed you can on the runway... don't get on the stick till the very end.
In the air, stay low between the buildings.
You see any Zero on your tail... wipe him off, don't freeze.
Just keep moving.
Try to separate 'em, take 'em out one by one.
P-40s can't outrun Zeros, so don't try.
We have to outfly 'em.
We got high-level bombers!
They'll bust this hangar wide open!
Grab the fifties! Let's move!
Move! Move!
Go, go, go!
Zeros!
Take cover! Take cover!
Take cover! Take cover!
Aah!
- Get down! Get down!
- Let's go! In the box!
Aah!
Danny!
Come on!
Come on, buddy!
Leave him, he's dead!
He's dead!
They're kicking our butt.
Get to the airplanes!
Go, go, go!
Run! Red, Anthony, let's go!
Come on, help me!
Goddamn belts!
Let's go! Come on!
Knock 'em dead.
Quick! Get in! Put this on!
They're coming around.
Bring 'em out! Let's go!
Red, get out of here,
God damn it! Go!
Come on, let's go.
Joe, get out the way!
I'm rollin'!
Clear! Go!
Oh, God. Planes!
Come on, help me!
Hey, Joe! You got three Zeros behind you!
Turn! Turn!
Oh, God!
Aah!
Oh, shit.
What are you doing? Get going!
Danny, start that thing up and get in the air.
I'm not much good without a wing man. I need you!
I got you!
Let's do it!
It's real tight, Rafe!
Real tight!
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure we have enough runway!
Get your airspeed up before you leave the dirt!
Don't freeze. Don't freeze.
I don't think
I'm gonna make it over!
Come on! Come on!
We did it! I'm up!
We got Zeros behind us!
How many you see back there?
We got five on our six!
Take it down to the deck, now!
We gotta split 'em up.
You take left, I'll take right.
Earl, get some guns in that goddamn tower!
OK! Let's go! Into the truck!
Danny, I got three on my six.
Whoo!
Stop! Stop! Let's go!
Let's go! Move it!
Move it, Red!
- Let's go!
- Gimme the fifty!
Let's go! All right!
I still got two behind me, Rafe.
Yaah!
Son of a bitch!
Whoa!
Earl, God damn it, get some guns in that tower!
On the tower.
Going ten stories up.
It's a long son of a bitch.
Rafe, they're all over me!
I can't get them off me!
Danny,
I still got three on my tail!
Keep jinking it!
Don't let them get a handle!
I can't shake 'em!
God damn it.
Danny, let's play chicken with these Jap suckers!
I'm with you.
Jesus!
- I'm coming right at you!
- Don't brake till I tell you.
Not yet! Not yet!
Come on!
Go left! Now!
- Whoo! We got 'em!
- Ha ha ha!
Set up over there!
Come on, load it!
We're on the tower.
I got one on my tail.
I'll bring him right by you.
He's comin' around!
Let's get this Jap sucker!
Hold your fire. Here he comes.
You better be cocked and locked when I come by!
Hold your fire!
Fire!
Whoo! Good shootin', boys!
Nice shot, Earl!
Let's head over to battleship row!
I'm with you!
Let's go do some business.
I'm going after 'em.
Rafe! I got him!
- P-40's!
- Yeah!
They're pulling into the clouds!
We ain't gonna let these sons of bitches get home!
How do you like someone shooting back at you?
Oh, I'm on your ass now!
Yeah! I got one!
Come on!
God, come on!
Come on, stay in there!
Whoa!
I got you, you son of a bitch!
Who taught you how to fly,
Lieutenant?
He did.
I have to amputate here!
I have to amputate!
You're not gonna die!
I got you.
Hold onto this...
Sandra, we're running out of morphine.
Find some way to mark 'em...
So we can keep track of who's got morphine already.
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?
It's not marking.
Have you got a marker?
Use my lipstick!
Put "M" for morphine.
- We need a tourniquet!
- Tourniquet!
Where are the clamps?
There's nothing left!
- Evelyn!
- Here, use this.
Go outside.
There's too many to help.
Sort them out.
Only those that can be saved you bring in.
I can't...
No, please,
I need you to do it!
Go! Go!
Aah!
Don't look at anyone without a mark!
I told you, stand back!
Keep 'em outside!
Come on! Let's go!
Wait here.
Don't touch me, you Jap!
Get your hands off me!
Get him into critical.
- Get him off me.
- Critical, frontward!
How bad am I?
You're gonna be just fine, sweetheart.
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.
I've got your hand.
Do you have enough morphine to make him comfortable?
He won't make it.
Line the critical up!
Get him morphine.
Take him over there!
Burn victims by the tree!
I just found her!
I don't think she's breathing.
No, she's dead. Take her-
Oh, God.
Are you sure, Ev?
Check her again.
She's dead.
Take her over there!
But you've gotta be sure!
She's dead!
Go back to work, Sandra.
I don't know what to do!
Over here!
Admiral?
From Washington.
"Attack by Japan considered imminent. "
They're only an hour late.
How can we help?
We need blood. Come on.
Remember, son, hold on to your faith.
1,500 cartons over there.
"'Today you will be with me in paradise...
"so fear not. "
Fear not, my son.
You are a man truly blessed.
You will die in a state of grace.
Remember, pain is temporary, but glory is forever.
Hold on to your faith, my son.
You'll be with God, the saints, and the angels soon.
I absolve you of your sins... in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit.
Innomine patris et fili, et spiritus sancti.
Amen.
Go with God, my son.
We've got men trapped everywhere in the harbor.
We need help from anybody who can move.
There's somebody in here!
Get somebody down here!
They're cutting through!
I hear somebody!
Get some guys up here!
Pull!
Get us out!
It's filling with water!
Get an airline in here!
We need the air hose!
What can we do?
It won't cut any faster!
- Cut him out!
- Aah!
Yesterday...
December 7, 1941... a date which will live in infamy... the United States of America... was suddenly and deliberately attacked... by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.
It is obvious... that planning the attack began many weeks ago.
During the intervening time... the Japanese government... has deliberately sought to deceive the United States... by false statements... and expressions of hope for continued peace.
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands... has caused severe damage to American military forces.
I regret to tell you... that over 3,000 American lives have been lost.
No matter how long it may take us... to overcome this premeditated invasion... the American people, in their righteous might... will win through to absolute victory.
Because of this unprovoked, dastardly attack by Japan...
I ask that the Congress declare a state of war.
Is it true... men are still trapped alive inside the Arizona?
We can hear tapping from inside the hull.
We're doing everything we can to get to them... but they're forty feet below water.
We've been trained to think that we're invincible.
And now our proudest ships have been destroyed... by an enemy we considered inferior.
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.
That's exactly why we have to strike back now.
We'll attack the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, sir.
I mean hitting the heart of
Japan the way they have hit us.
Mr. President...
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares because we didn't face facts.
This isn't a time for ignoring them again.
We have long-range bombers, but no place to launch them.
Midway is too far, and Russia won't allow us... to launch a raid from there.
Admiral?
Navy's planes are small.
They carry light loads and have a short range.
We'd have to get them within a few hundred miles of Japan.
We'd risk our carriers, and if we lose them... we'll have no shield against invasion.
Does anyone in this room think victory is possible... without facing danger?
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.
But consider the risk,
Mr. President.
If the Japanese invade us right now... they would reach Chicago before we could stop them.
Gentlemen... most of you did not know me when I had the use of my legs.
I was strong and proud... and arrogant.
Now I wonder, every hour of my life... why God put me into this chair.
But when I see defeat in the eyes of my country men- in your eyes, right now-
I start to think that maybe he brought me down... for times like these... when we all need to be reminded who we truly are- that we will not give up or give in.
Mr. President, with all respect, sir... what you're asking can't be done.
- Mr. President!
- Get back, George!
Get back.
Do not tell me... it can't be done.
Japan continues its military conquest... throughout the Pacific.
But, back home... millions of American workers band together... bringing factories to life to avenge Pearl Harbor.
Mr. President, we have an idea how to bomb the Japanese.
Sir, it's risky... but it's bold.
- Who are you?
- I, sir?
Captain Low, Mr. President.
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea.
I like sub commanders.
They don't have time for bullshit, and neither do I.
Fire away, gentlemen.
And where is God in all this?
Our enemies believe a divine wind protects them.
But we see our friends laid out here before us.
Hey, Captain.
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker.
Yes, Major?
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.
What for, sir?
Ask Colonel Doolittle.
Yes, sir.
You're packing.
Orders.
What kind of orders?
The top-secret kind.
The dangerous kind.
I can't find Danny.
Is that why you're here?
Looking for Danny?
Probably saying good-bye to his squadron.
We've been assigned to Doolittle.
I wasn't looking for Danny.
I couldn't have you go away... without you understanding something.
Yeah. You don't have to explain anything.
I do, because you're acting like I didn't love you.
Evelyn, loving you kept me alive.
I should've died over there.
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.
I told him I was sorry... that I knew I'd been a fool for leaving you... trying to go over there and be a hero... and I promised I'd never ask for anything again... if I could just see you one more time.
And you know what?
It was worth it.
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.
So I'm gonna stand by my end of the deal.
I'm gonna walk away.
And I won't ask you for anything.
But I just want to know why.
Just tell me that, will you, please? Just tell me why.
Rafe, I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God.
I didn't even know until the day you turned up alive.
And then all this happened.
I haven't told Danny.
I don't want him to know.
All he needs to think about... is how to do this mission and get back alive.
Rafe, all I ever wanted... was for us to have a home, grow old together... but life never asked me what I wanted.
Now, I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart... but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset... without thinking of you.
I'll love you my whole life.
I'll see you on board.
You know, the only thing that scares me... is that you might love him more than you love me.
I love you, Danny.
And I'll be here waiting for you when you come back.
Follow me.
Colonel.
Congratulations on your promotion, sir.
I heard what you did.
We can explain that, sir.
Explain what?
Whatever it is you heard about us, sir.
You mean the hula shirts you were flying in?
Or the seven planes you shot down?
You're both being awarded the Silver Star... and promoted to captain.
Is that the good news, sir, or...
You're just about the only pilots in the Army... with combat experience.
I need you for a mission...
I've been ordered to put together.
You know what top secret is?
Yes, sir.
It's the kind of mission where you get medals.
But they send 'em to your relatives.
Top secret means you train for something... never done before in aviation history... and you go without knowing where you're going.
You do it on that basis or not at all.
I'll go, sir.
I'll go, too, sir.
By the way, the Brits sent over your personal effects.
Thank you, sir.
There's only one more thing.
Leave your goddamn hula shirts at home.
Dear Rafe...
It's so strange to be this far from you... but you should know this- every night...
I've been looking all over for you.
Danny, this... this ain't no time to leave things unsaid.
Now, we gotta face facts here.
The fact is, we just both love the same woman.
She's the first girl I ever felt this way about, Rafe.
I couldn't help what happened any more than you could.
This is different, though, Danny.
Evelyn already lost the man she loved once.
I just don't want it to see that happen to her again.
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.
She knows that.
Danny, don't do this.
Don't go on this mission.
You got nothing to prove.
You've been protecting me since we were kids.
Yeah, well... you do tend to need it from time to time.
The mission I'm asking you to volunteer for... is exceptionally dangerous.
Take a look at the man beside you.
It's a good bet that in the next six weeks... you or he... will be dead.
Everyone brave enough to accept this... step forward.
Your grandmother could take a B-25 off... on a mile-long runway.
Well, I'm gonna train you to do it in 467 feet.
Because at 468 feet... you're dead.
And once you get it up... you'll learn to fly it like a fighter... thirty feet off the ground.
I want you to say hello... to Lieutenant Jack Richards,
Navy Aviation.
He'll help us lighten these fat ladies.
Dump that ash can.
See that bomb sight?
Get rid of it.
Colonel, he's crazy!
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.
She's fat.
We want a skinny lady!
Max power!
Get up, get up!
- Damn!
- How the heck-
Damn!
They just keep rolling past that line.
Maybe it's a bad idea.
No, they're too heavy.
We gotta get drastic.
This armored plating goes.
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Lose it like a skirt, son.
Release brakes!
Come on, come on!
- God!
- Put every man on the line!
Let's show these boys how this thing is done!
Come on! Max power.
Well, if he can do it...
Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you... that we're going to Tokyo.
And we're gonna bomb it.
That comes as a special request... directly from
President Roosevelt.
The Navy'll sneak us about
400 miles off the coast... and we'll launch from the carrier there.
Has that been done before?
Taking Army bombers off Navy carriers?
- No.
- OK.
Any other questions?
Well, sir, is it even possible to land... a B-25 on an aircraft carrier deck?
That won't matter.
As soon as we're airborne, the carrier heads for Hawaii.
But without them, where do we land?
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.
Wo shimeiguo ren.
It means "I am an American".
In Chinese.
Ain't gonna be any easier.
That's three feet shorter than our practice runway.
- Fellas?
- Sir.
Sir.
Secretary of the Navy gave me these.
What are they?
Friendship medals the Japanese gave us... when they were pretending to want peace.
What'll you do with them?
Wire them to the bombs and give them back.
So what's going on?
Well, sir, we only have sixteen planes.
So?
When the Japs hit us, they had more than 300.
How much difference can we make?
It's not that we're afraid, sir.
But we might die, and we want to know what it's for.
You know, at Pearl, they hit us with a sledgehammer.
This raid, even if we make it through... it'll only be a pin prick... but it'll be straight through their hearts.
Victory belongs to those that believe in it the most... and believe in it the longest.
We're gonna believe.
We're gonna make
America believe, too.
Colonel? I need a minute.
- Excuse me, Major Jackson?
- Yes?
Do you remember me?
Oh, sure I do.
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.
Well, maybe you can.
When the news comes in about the Doolittle boys...
I want to be in the command post.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
How the hell do you know about this mission?
Let's call it an inadvertent disclosure.
Some flyboy you're dating shot his mouth off.
Actually, it's about two pilots.
I know they're going into great danger.
I just want to be there when the news tells us... if they've lived or died.
Most officers would have thrown you in the brig.
Most nurses wouldn't keep their fingers... plugged in your artery.
I can't promise you anything.
Hey, Red, you think they picked us... to do this
'cause we're young and dumb?
Come on, Gooz, we're the tip of the sword.
In honor of our trip to Japan...
I got us some victory cigars!
- Yeah!
- There you go.
Put that in your insidepocket, next to your heart.
You know, Jack, we may lose this battle... but we're gonna win this war.
- You know how I know?
- No.
Them.
'Cause they're rare.
And at times like these, you see them... stepping forward.
There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer, Jack.
My friends in the war department... don't want me to lead this raid... because they say
I'm too valuable.
They don't want me up in the air... flying with the men that I've chosen... that I've chewed out, cussed out, pushed to the limit... and that I've come to respect.
They want me to stand on the flight deck... and wave you off.
Well, I don't see it that way.
So I'm going with you.
We take off tomorrow afternoon... drop our fire, and head for China.
Our mission is to hit military targets... aircraft and tank factories.
Colonel, you've given us homing beacons... but you said China is overrun with Japanese troops.
What if the beacons are switched off?
Bring her down any way you can... and do your best to avoid capture.
What if we have to bail out over Japan?
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what to do.
What would you do, Colonel?
I wasn't built to be a prisoner... so I would have my crew bail out.
I'd find the sweetest military target I could... and drive my plane right smack into the middle of it...
But that's just me.
I'm forty-five years old.
I'm an old man.
You guys have your whole lives ahead of you... so what you do is up to you.
The mission will launch in a couple of hours.
You'll stay right in here.
Here. Stay here.
Don't talk to them.
They won't talk to you.
Pretend to type the information we pass you.
That's it.
This is Orphan Annie from Radio Tokyo.
To all the lonely boys in the South Pacific... watch out- the enemy will get you.
Maybe she's right.
Japs transmitting!
Captain, radar reports
Japanese patrol boats.
- Range 400 yards.
- How many yards?
400 yards and closing, sir.
Richards, Japs!
400 yards! Let's go!
Admiral Halsey's ordering the cruisers to open fire!
We gotta sink these Jap boats before they give us away.
Go to general quarters!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God.
This can't be good!
All hands, man your battle stations.
Japs one mile away.
They reported our position.
Supposed to launch
400 miles away. How far are we?
624 miles.
- Jesus!
- What do you want to do?
Colonel, I don't know if the planes... can carry enough fuel to make it to China.
Now. We launch now!
Army pilots! Man your planes!
Man your planes!
They're shooting at something.
- Let's go!
- It ain't a drill!
Colonel!
We're too far out to make it!
They need more fuel, but they can't get too heavy!
Strip everything out of this plane you don't need now!
Start pre-flight! Let's go!
Add ten cans of fuel for each plane!
Every plane!
Let's go! Move!
Guys, get up there!
Lose those suitcases now!
- What's your favorite gun?
- What?
You want off this deck, give me a gun now!
It's still too heavy!
Go to the kitchen, get some broomsticks.
Cut 'em down, paint 'em black, and bring them here.
We'll put a broomstick where this gun was.
What are you doing to my plane?
Tell your crew to take a piss before they take off.
We got broomsticks for tail guns.
Yeah.
Maybe it'll scare 'em.
You take care of yourself up there.
Yeah, I will.
Danny, be careful, you hear me?
I will.
I'll see you, Rafe.
Rafe!
We're the tip of the sword!
- Turning on one!
- Turning on two!
All right.
You ready for this?
- Superchargers low and latched!
- Low and latched.
We're full into the wind!
More speed! More speed!
Are you nervous?
No-yes, sir. Yes.
When did you find religion?
When you assigned me to this mission, sir.
Do me a favor.
- What's that, Colonel?
- Pray for both of us.
Tell me when!
Let's go!
Max power!
Oh, please.
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Way to go!
Jesus, that was short.
Move 'em up!
Full power, here we go!
Pull back!
Ha ha ha!
Come on, here we go, here we go!
We made it!
From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo... we have been described... as a nation of weaklings and playboys... who hire British,
Russian, or Chinese soldiers... to do our fighting for us.
Let them repeat that now.
Let them tell that to
General MacArthur and his men.
Let them tell that to the soldiers who today... are fighting hard in the far waters of the Pacific.
Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses.
Let them tell that to the Marines.
That's Japan, fellas.
Tighten up back there!
Man your guns!
We're in the enemy's backyard!
Look alive back there.
I see coastline.
Heads up, boys! Heads up!
Man your guns back there.
I'm cocked and locked!
Get ready, suckers!
Approaching targets for bombing raid!
Open bomb bay doors.
Ripley, you gota target in sight?
37 degrees!
Target in sight!
All right, boys, let's knock their clocks off!
- Drop your ordnance!
- Bombs away!
One away!
- Bombs away!
- Bombs away!
Two away!
Three away!
Four away!
We caught 'em by surprise!
- Dropping ordnance!
- Bombs away!
...factory.
- Whoo!
- We got it!
We hit our targets!
Good job, raiders!
God! Jesus-what? Shit!
We got flak everywhere!
Go down there and get Gooz!
I want everyone to separate!
- Clean that up!
- Yes, sir.
Try and clean that up!
They're shooting flak at us!
We gotta get out of this shit,
Gooz!
- We got a fire!
- Tail's hit!
The electrics!
We got a fire back here!
I gotta short this out!
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!
God damn!
Red, go check that out!
We're getting covered!
Just hope they don't hit a prop!
Unh!
I'm hit!
They're tearing this plane apart!
Red, take it up, 800 feet.
Aah!
I think Theo's dead!
Theo, wake up!
Theo!
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!
Get up in that soup!
We're gonna pull out of this,
Gooz!
Thank you, George.
What is it, General?
Colonel Doolittle had to advance his execution order... by twelve hours, Mr. President.
There will be no homing beacons.
The plane carrying them crashed en route to China... and our bombers may lack the fuel... to reach the mainland, sir.
So our boys are flying blind on empty tanks.
God help them.
We're still not getting a signal.
All ocean and no land.
Homing in on nothing.
How many cans of fuel we got left?
These are all empty!
Is this all you got?
That's all we got, Red.
Rafe! You better pray for land!
Break radio silence.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
You're all brave souls.
The bravest I've ever had the privilege of flying with.
But we're on our own.
This really was a suicide mission.
Engine one's fluctuating.
We'll lose it any minute.
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I am. How about now?
I see the coast.
I see the coast!
Copy that, Rafe.
We're gonna make it.
Danny, follow me.
We can make this.
I can see the coast now.
We're only a few miles out.
We gotta find a soft landing spot.
I'm pushing up on two.
Hold on for a hard landing!
I see rice paddies.
We'll bring it in right here.
Oh, God, engine one's dead.
We'll lose engine two any second.
We can make it in. Easy.
Pull it back, glide in on fumes.
Japs!
We got Jap patrols all over the place!
Japs! Land somewhere else!
Strap yourselves in!
We're coming in hard!
We're a deadstick.
Get outta the nose!
Hold on, boys!
We're going down!
Watch the trees!
Everyone all right?
I'm OK! I'm OK!
Where's Ripley?
He's dead.
Watch for Japs!
- Jap patrols!
- Take cover!
Who's got magazines?
Got em!
Gotta get up into those hills, find the Chinese!
They got us pinned down!
- Danny!
- Rafe! Rafe, no!
Danny!
Rafe, you don't have a chance!
God damn. Danny!
Come on!
Gooz? You OK, man?
Danny? Aw, shit, Anthony.
Gooz! Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Danny.
Easy, easy, easy.
I've had better landings.
You saved us back there.
I got something in my neck.
- Let me pull this out.
- Where's Gooz?
He's fine.
He's right over there.
Rafe!
Grenade!
Danny.
Danny!
Danny! Oh!
- Hold on!
- Rafe!
Hold on, now. I got you.
You're all right.
You're all right.
I'm not gonna make it.
Oh, yes, you are.
Yes, you are. Now look at me.
Rafe, I'm so cold.
I'm so cold.
You're all right. Hey.
Hey, Rafe?
Can you do me a favor?
What?
Can you have someone else write my name on the tombstone?
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, listen to me!
You ain't gonna die, you hear me?
Danny.
Danny, you can't die.
You can't die. You know why?
'Cause you're gonna be a father.
You're gonna be a daddy.
I wasn't supposed to tell you.
You're gonna be a father.
Please.
No. You are.
Danny.
Danny?
Please, please!
Please.
God.
Please, Danny.
Hold your fire!
They're Chinese.
When the action is over and we look back... we understand both more and less.
This much is certain.
Before the Doolittle raid...
America knew nothing but defeat.
After it, there was hope of victory.
Japan realized for the first time that they could lose... and began to pull back.
America realized that she would win... and surged forward.
It was a war that changed America...
...and the world.
Dorie Miller was the first black American... to be awarded the Navy Cross.
But he would not be the last.
He joined a brotherhood of heroes.
That's for all the raiders.
World War II for us began at Pearl Harbor... and 1,177 men still lie entombed... in the battleship Arizona.
America suffered... but America grew stronger.
It was not inevitable.
The times tried our souls... and through the trial, we overcame.
Hey, Danny... how'd you like to go flying?
Come here.
When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad
'cause I was blessed
To get to have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me
In my dreams
I'll always see you
Soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be a place for you
For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
Well, you showed me how it feels
Feel the sky with in my reach
And I always will remember
All the strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me
In my dreams
I'll always see you
Soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be
A place for you
For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
'Cause I always saw in you my light
My strength
And I want to thank you now
For all the ways
You were right there for me
You were right there for me
For always
In my dreams
I'll always see you
Soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be
A place for you
For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
There you'll be
MAKHMALBAF FILM HOUSE
AND FABRICA CINEMA PRESENT
BLACKBOARDS a film by Samira MAKHMALBAF
- Said!
- Yes?
Thanks for your water.
- You've drunk it all!
- I was thirsty. I'm sorry.
Forget it.
Where did you go yesterday?
To Dezle.
Why?
Looking for pupils.
But no luck,
I couldn't find any.
I was there for three days.
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.
I don't smoke.
You couldn't find any pupils?
Not one.
My father warned me but I didn't listen to him and now,
I truly regret it.
- You studied for long?
- Two years.
You became a teacher in two years?
I worked hard.
- You like it?
- Not really.
Why?
I looked for three days and I found nothing.
I didn't listen to my father.
- What did he tell you to do?
- To be a shepherd.
I failed.
He's gone.
Get up.
Hurry up!
And your wife?
When we got back from Tehran, we had a fight about the doctor.
Her family insulted my family.
Mine responded in kind.
So her father took her.
Hurry up.
We have to hide him.
It's been three months since she went back with her father.
She left me with three kids, one of them just a baby
I tried to find him a wet nurse.
I went through a hundred families to find one.
As a result he's drunk the milk of many women, even cows
He looks like a hundred different women.
He's got the eyes of one, the ears of another.
And he's sick.
Now I run from village to village looking for a pupil
I can make into a doctor.
That way, we'd never have to go into town.
If there was a doctor in the next village things would be easier.
- You're going to make a doctor?
- Yes.
- Which path are you taking?
- The one on the right.
It's dangerous.
- Which way are you going?
- This way.
But it's very dangerous.
Wait.
I'll tell you again, it's a death trap.
Yours is even worse.
No. Yours is more dangerous.
Goodbye.
- Where are you going now?
- to the village.
- Can I come with you?
- If you like.
If we go together do you think we'll find any pupils?
- I'm not coming.
- Why?
I want to go to the top.
- How many pupils will you find?
- Two or three.
Fine. Keep them.
I'm going to climb to the very top.
The villages bring me bad luck.
My fortune lies up there.
Go on, you take the villages.
I'm going up there.
Goodbye.
Take care.
Hello!
Hello!
Is there a school here?
I don't know.
And a teacher?
I don't know.
No idea.
Goodbye.
- And I'm sorry.
- The Lord will go with you.
Excuse me!
Wait a minute.
What?
Please, read me this letter.
What is it?
What does he say?
Hold on.
This letter isn't in Persian.
Where does it come from?
For the love of God, read it to me.
It's from your son?
It's not in Persian. Maybe Arabic?
Where's it from?
From Iraq.
I don't know if it's in Arabic,
Turkish or Kurdish.
It's from my son.
But from where?
I can't read it.
I return them.
Next he greets his mother, his sister, his father and his brother
He finishes by saying goodbye.
But how is he getting by?
Has he got money?
Iraqi dinars.
How's he getting on in jail?
I'm sure he's fine...
He must have written that he misses you.
At the end, he says goodbye.
He doesn't say when he'll be released?
Goodbye.
I don't know.
But when will he be freed?
That's all?
If it's God's will, he will be released. Don't worry.
Goodbye.
My god!
Young man!
- Are you OK?
- Yes, thank you.
Do you know where I can find the shepherd boys?
Up there. This way or that way.
The goats go up this way?
Listen, I am a teacher.
- What?
- I am a teacher.
So what are you doing here?
- Looking for children.
- Good luck.
- Where are they?
- Up there.
Listen, young man,
I'm talking to you.
I've already told you, they're up there.
- Which way should I go?
- The way I told you.
Straight ahead.
Do you know how to write?
Do you know how to write?
To read and write?
No.
Would you like to learn?
It's useless.
Show me the way.
The way, young man!
Where are you going?
- Young Man!
- What?
The way?
Here. There. Also here.
Not this way?
I'm talking to you!
- Young man!
- What?
Show me the way.
I want you to show me the way.
Look at me!
Leave me alone.
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
Is there anyone here?
Open the windows.
Answer me!
Multiplication tables!
Come and learn how to multiply.
One times two is two.
Two times two is four.
Madame!
Do you need a teacher?
- What?
- I am a teacher.
Where are your children?
Leave me alone.
- I have come to teach your children.
- I am a teacher.
- Who are you?
- I'm looking for pupils.
Good for you.
Where are the children?
Go away.
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
Is there anyone here?
I can hear voices.
I've come a long way to teach your children to read and write.
You won't need to pay me much.
I'll teach you to read and write letters.
Children, at last!
Wonderful! Come here.
Stop.
Tell me where you've come from.
Where have you come from?
Where are you going?
Where have you come from?
I've come from deep in the valley to find you.
Let us through, mister.
Just a moment.
I'm not going to eat you.
I only want to talk to you.
- Do you have a school here?
- No.
- And a teacher?
- No.
- Would you like one?
- No.
Where are you going with those burdens?
- We're mules.
- What?
- Then I'll come with you. OK?
- No.
Let us get past, mister.
Let us get past!
Wait a minute, kid!
Allow me to finish and I'll let you go.
Just one question: where are you going with those?
Let us get past!
It's heavy!
You can't stay there like that.
Let us get past.
We're wiped out.
- You don't have a teacher?
- No.
There's no teachers here.
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
Let us pass, we're wiped out.
Look.
You're holding us all up.
Let us pass.
I'm a teacher and I've come to teach you to read and write.
I've come a long way.
I've been looking for you for a long time!
I want to teach you to read and write, to add up and multiply.
I don't want a lot of money if you don't have any, you could just give me something to eat.
We carry contraband, stolen goods.
We take it over the border between Iran and Iraq.
We're always on the run.
Listen, my child.
With education, you will be able to read a book or, even better, a newspaper when you're travelling.
Learn to read and write!
You'll know what's going on in the world.
You can learn to add up, to substract, to do your accounts without being swindled.
What good is it, all that?
You could study or find work
Doing the accounts, that's great for the Boss.
Us, we're mules.
Always on the move.
How do you expect us to read?
To read a book, you have to sit down.
Us, we never stop moving.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Stop! Wait!
Wait!
Hello.
Do you know how to read and write?
- Do you?
- No.
- Do you want to learn?
- No.
- You don't?
- No.
Hello.
Do you know how to read and write?
- Do you?
- No.
Hello, sir!
- I'm talking to you.
- What?
You wouldn't have a scrap of bread?
It's freezing!
Where are you going?
I don't have a job, can I come with you?
We don't need you.
Hello. How's it going?
It's freezing!
Hello, sir.
Sir!
I'm talking to you.
Why won't you answer me?
Haven't you got any work for me?
No.
I'll do anything.
We don't have any work ourselves.
I could herd goats, sweep up.
Just give me something to eat.
We haven't got anything to eat either.
How do you survive?
We're nomads.
I'm hungry.
Give me a piece of bread.
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?
We have strayed. We're old.
We are lost, we don't know how to get back to Iraq.
Can you show us the way, just as far as the border?
Fine, let's go.
I can show you, but it won't be easy.
Halaleh! Bring your father something to drink.
Bring some water!
What do I get if I take you?
We have nothing to give you!
I have to guide you for nothing?
We have nothing to give you.
You must have something!
There is nothing.
Not even a piece of bread?
Not even bread.
It's a hard road.
You must give me something.
We don't have anything.
How can I lead you with no reward?
We have nothing.
Not even a scrap?
I can give you forty walnuts.
Only forty?
Forty isn't enough!
Give me fifty.
- The route is hard.
- You won't get more than forty.
It's a long hard road.
I accept.
OK.
- What's wrong with him?
- He's sick.
Give him some water!
Drink, drink.
Drink, drink. You won't drink?
Drink!
Dear lady, give me a little water too.
Madam, I'm thristy.
I'm parched!
Give me something to drink.
I'm thirsty.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going on.
For five nuts, will you carry the sick boy on your blackboard?
Five nuts?
OK.
God help us!
What's wrong with the old man?
He can't piss.
He's sick.
Sick?
Where are you taking him?
To the border.
To the border?
Who is that woman?
That's the old man's daughter.
He wants to marry her off.
Once it's done, he'll go to his grave in peace.
How much does he want for her dowry?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
She's poor?
If you want her hand, give him a walnut tree.
I don't have one. I'm a teacher.
I only have this blackboard.
- Only this blackboard?
- Yes.
I must ask her father if he will allow it...
Sure you won't regret it?
No, I won't regret it.
Get him down there
What about me?
Let's go and ask for her hand right away.
Force yourself, my brother. Piss.
Hurry up. Don't be afraid.
Don't look at her!
You haven't been introduced.
Said!
You wish to marry Halaleh?
Yes.
- You agree?
- Yes.
Come on.
Come on... piss.
Are you sure?
Yes.
- You will shield her from hunger?
- Yes.
- And from thirst?
- I will shield her from hunger.
- You swear not to abandon her?
- I promise.
Halaleh?
Yes?
Do you accept Said as your husband with this blackboard for a dowry?
Are you agreed?
You wish to marry him?
With the blackboard?
The blackboard? Yes.
Yes.
You are truly agreed?
Halaleh!
And you, do you take him?
Yes.
You are now husband and wife.
Let's rest here.
You want to stop here?
You want to be stuck here forever?
Won't you get sick of it?
What's your name?
Have you got any toothache?
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.
Which tooth is it?
Do you know how to read and write?
Do you want to learn?
As you wish.
What's your name?
- Your name?
- Hayyaz.
Hayyaz?
You do this journey all the time?
Aren't you tired?
- You know how to read and write?
- No.
- You don't want to?
- No.
Do you know what it would allow you to do?
To read a book or a newspaper, to work, to listen, to speak...
When you can read a book, you discover stories...
Stories?
I've got a hundred.
It was spring. I climbed to the peak with your friends, to the top of the mountain.
The goats were grazing peacefully.
We chased a rabbit.
It ran out of breath.
We caught it.
My friend tortured it.
He wanted to cut its head off.
I told him it was a sin.
But he continued to torment it, he still wanted to cut its head off.
He tortured it and tried to cut its head off.
I said that it was a sin.
I told him to stop and I grabbed his hand, to try stop him.
He insulted me and cut the rabbit's head off.
They washed it and split it up without giving me my share.
That upset me.
I went off and cried.
I led my goats away and then we fought.
Then, as it was late, we went our separate ways to our homes.
Drop it!
I don't need your stories.
I want to teach you.
Sir, your honour, please come here a minute.
- What's your name?
- Reeboir.
Reeboir? Me too.
No kidding?
Do you know what that says, Reeboit?
No idea.
That says "he who walks".
The traveller.
- Do you know how to read and write?
- No.
- Do you want me to teach you?
- Yes!
- You really do?
- Yes.
- Shall we begin?
- OK.
Take it, eat.
- No, thank you.
- Please, eat.
Thank you.
- What do you do?
- I'm a teacher.
You're joking? You're a teacher?
Can you teach me to write my name?
- Do you want to learn?
- Yes. Really.
- You've never written your name?
- No.
Hello.
Where are you going with the kid?
Go and play.
Are you OK?
Go and play!
Don't cry, your mother's coming.
Come and play with the nuts.
Stay here, little one.
Mummy's coming.
Sit down and play.
Don't move. Come on. Sit down.
Hold the walnut in your hand.
That's right... like that.
That's it... just like that.
Lift your hand.
Throw it!
"I love you".
Now spell it.
Lift your hand, like that.
Watch me.
I... love... you.
Look at me...
"I love you"
You won't answer?
Fine, I'll give you a zero because you wouldn't answer me.
You cheated.
You stretched out your arm.
You cheated!
We'll have a return game!
As you refuse to answer me,
I'll give you zero.
But because you're a good girl,
I'll give you eighteen.
"Eighteen".
Come.
Why do you refuse to learn?
I'm the best teacher around.
All my pupils get... twenty out of twenty!
You deserve zero, but you're a good girl. I'll give you eighteen.
I want to piss.
Help me, God...
Spare me, God...
Help me, God...
Spare me, God...
Come here and try and relieve yourself.
If you don't squeeze it out, you'll die.
You've been suffering for three days now.
Hurry up.
Piss... Piss... Piss.
Hurry up...
Relieve yourself. Quick.
If you don't, you're as good as dead.
Hurry up.
Let's help him!
Couldn't manage it?
I love you.
You, Blackboard! Move...
- You still couldn't piss?
- No.
God help me!
- You didn't piss?
- No.
I swear to you, Satan himself could piss in that water.
I have pissed in that water, but not him.
He must have committed some terrible sin and now he can't piss!
- You didn't piss?
- No.
My God, have mercy on me!
Have mercy on me.
You didn't piss?
No.
That's it. Yes, R.
Well done.
B like Bread.
B like Bread...
O like Oil...
See how easy it is: Reeboir...
Run, quick.
Run!
Quick!
Repeat: R like Reeboir.
Reeboir.
He's fallen down!
Shakak!
- Who's fallen?
- Hayyaz.
Don't cry, Hayyaz.
Tell the story of the rabbit.
It was spring.
Me and four friends we climbed up high, to the top of the mountain.
The sheep were feeding happily.
We saw a rabbit and we caught it.
- You can read and write, boy?
- Yes.
- You can?
- Yes.
But you told me you couldn't!
I don't trust strangers.
Why?
My mother warned me not to.
Your friends can read?
Most of them, yes.
But their mothers told them never to trust strangers.
Children. Listen to me a minute.
Sit down.
Don't waste what time you have.
Let me teach you.
Look at my blackboard!
I want ot teach you to read and write.
Watch me! Listen to me!
Don't listen to him.
Let's get out of here!
Let's go! Carry him.
Children! Where are you going?
Stop!
Listen to me!
Don't go!
It's your fault, all this!
Children!
- Repeat.
- Did I say it right?
Well done.
Very good.
Stretch out the R...
R like Reeboir.
Listen, friend.
What happened: we chased the rabbit, we caught it and we ate it.
It was tasty!
Delicious!
A like Apple...
Be quiet.
They're behind us.
Reeboir and his group, this way.
Group two, take the other path.
The rest of you, follow me.
Be careful. It's dangerous.
Not this way!
There are landmines everywhere!
Take the other path.
Look out!
Don't get yourselves killed.
Go round the other side!
Two times two?
Four.
Reply!
Reply swiftly, learn swiftly.
Two times three?
Six.
Four times two?
Come on, answer!
Two times five?
Come on: ten!
To learn quickly you must answer quickly.
One times two?
Two.
Two times two? Four.
One times two? Two.
Mother, a rabbit!
Chuan!
What are you doing?
The Devil take you!
Halaleh!
Where is she gone?
The Devil take you!
Halaleh!
Where are you?
Please, sir, have you seen my wife?
Where are you going?
Stop...
You want some walnuts?
One times two is two!
Why are you running away?
Have I done something wrong?
If maths is too difficult,
I'll teach you to read.
Repeat after me...
"I love you"
See, it's easy.
Say it!
Come on, say it!
Say "I love you".
Look at me.
What sort of student are you?
I'll give you eight.
No, not eight.
That would fail you.
I'll give you ten, so you pass.
Say it!
Say "I love you".
You don't want to?
What sort of student are you?
I'm giving you zero.
At least say that you don't love me.
What's wrong?
You won't say that either?
Here comes another zero.
Happy now?
Now a zero for your son.
Here's a zero for your son.
What?
You still won't answer?
I'll give you a zero for your father.
Here.
Still got nothing to say?
I'll give myself a zero.
For having been stupid enough to follow you.
What kind of a life is this?
Goodbye.
How could I have loved you?
You're not listening to me!
Blackboard!
Stop!
Blackboard!
Stop.
Listen!
My heart is like a train.
At every station, someone gets on or off.
But there is someone who never gets off.
My son.
Halaleh...
What's happening?
Escape! Hurry up!
What's going on?
The soldiers at the border have opened fire!
A like Apple.
Break the syllables up.
Excuse me, Sir. I'm sorry.
We're in danger.
I'll come back later.
Halt!
Who goes there?
What's your name?
- You don't want to tell me?
- Ghazal.
Do you know how to read and write?
- Do you?
No.
- Where is your village?
- Down there.
- That's Dezl?
- Yes.
- Is there a school?
- No.
- Do you want a teacher?
- No.
- Will we have to wait long?
- Who knows.
Where are your friends?
We're meeting up by the river.
No, it was near the goats.
- They're not coming.
- They've been caught.
Thanks for the milk. Excellent.
Sir, I've written something.
- What?
- I wrote something.
- What?
- I wrote my name.
- Well done.
I wrote Reeboir.
Run for your life!
Take him.
Come.
Quick.
It's just like at Halebtcheh...
I built a wall to protect us from chemical weapons.
Father!
Chemical weapons...
Father!
Look after him.
Chemical weapons...
What's happened?
I pissed.
Hide under the blackboard.
My daughter!
Your brother is dead. Let's go.
He wanted to die in his homeland.
He isn't dead.
Come on. He is dead.
- Just like at Halebtcheh.
- It's rifle fire.
It's not chemical weapons.
Don't worry.
It's the soldiers from over the border who were firing.
It's not chemical weapons.
Don't be afraid, my darling.
The women...
The children...
We're not going to die.
It's not chemical weapons.
It's the soldiers, over the border.
If you hear us, they'll fire.
I swear, it's not chemical weapons.
The women...
The men...
Hide under the blackboard.
I'll protect you.
Strop!
There. The border.
The land of your fathers, of your ancestors.
Your homeland!
You're lying!
I swear I'm not.
It's the truth. Take a good look.
Don't you recognise Halebtcheh?
No. It's not the border.
He's tricked us, I know it.
He's lying.
It's not the border.
We are lost.
I know our border very well.
This isn't it.
I'm not lying.
I swear to you this is it.
This is your homeland.
This isn't the border!
We are lost!
Can't you understand?
Don't you believe me?
You're lying.
You've tricked us, Blackboard!
I swear to you, I'm not lying.
It's been like this since the bombing.
It's not true!
I swear to you, this is the border.
You're looking at Halebtcheh.
It's because of the bombing...
God be praised!
We are grateful to you.
Here are the nuts.
What will you do now?
Will you cross the border with us?
No, I can't. but your wife wants to cross over.
She won't stay with you.
What's your decision?
If she doesn't want me, what can I do?
I don't know. You must decide.
A divorce?
Yes, if that's what she wants.
Let's find out.
Are you coming with us, Blackboard?
I can't.
I belong here, in this land.
Your wife wants to return to her country. She doesn't want you.
Did she tell you that?
There's nothing I can do.
I'll divorce her.
- You will divorce her?
- Yes.
Go and find her.
Put it down here.
Do you agree to a divorce?
And that you will take the blackboard?
The blackboard? Yes.
You may look at each other one last time.
Lift your hand.
Take that stick.
Halaleh, you are now divorced, and the blackboard is yours.
May God keep you from hunger!
May God keep you from thirst!
May God keep you from solitude!
Take your blackboard.
And give me my stick.
Goodbye.
I love you.
Chuan! What are you doing?
Hurry up. Come on.
Come, quickly.

Your father's here.
He's brought the whole family.
He's leaving.
Father, please stay for supper!
Father!
Your first Mass, and you crap yourself!
I hoped we could talk.
We scraped to send you to the law, to elevate you to a noble profession.
I sweat in the mines for 20 years to give you the chance
I never had!
Is that how you interpret the commandment to honor your father and mother?
God brought me here.
God?
A shaft of lightning burns your arse, and you call that God?
The devil, more like!
Father!
Shut up! Shut up!
Leave me alone!
Satan, stifle your lying tongue!
I never claimed to be good!
Never!
They know my faults here... my pride, my cursed lust!
I confess them all!
I confess them all!
Just leave me!
Just leave me!
Just leave me!
Please leave me!
You're too hard on yourself,
Brother Martin.
Arguing with the devil never does any of us any good.
He has had 5,000 years of practice.
He knows all the weak spots.
I'm sorry about today.
I'm not here to scold you, Martin.
I'm too full of sin to be a priest.
You know, in two years
I've never heard you confess anything remotely interesting.
I live in terror of judgment.
And you think self-hatred will save you?
Have you ever dared to think that God is not just?
He has us born tainted by sin, then He's angry with us all our lives for our faults, this righteous Judge... who damns us... threatening us with the fires of hell!
I know! I know
I'm evil to think it!
You're not evil.
You're just not honest.
God isn't angry with you.
You are angry with God.
I wish there were no God.
Martin, what is it you seek?
A merciful God!
A God whom I can love.
A God who loves me.
Then look to Christ.
Bind yourself to Christ and you will know God's love.
Say to Him,
"I'm yours. Save me."
"I am yours. Save me."
I am yours. Save me.
I am yours. Save me.
The brothers are not happy with your decision.
They think there are others in our cloister better suited to deliver your letters to Rome.
Martin has two degrees and an aptitude for law.
It will be a legal brief he carries.
Besides, it will do him good to be out in the world.
We need your teaching, brother!
Try some wine.
Let go of me!
Let me go!
You listen, you little thief!
Keep going.
It's none of your business.
Keep going, for your good.
Hey, you look lonely, brother.
Alms for a blind man!
Come on, come inside.
No.
Statues of all your favorite saints.
Saint Cecilia for sore throats,
Saint Paul for bad backs and swollen feet, brother.
Saint Joe for chapped hands, the Virgin...
Pope Julius is coming!
Get down!
Down!
The Pope is here!
It's the Holy Father!
Clear the streets!
Make way for the Pope!
Make way for the Pope!
This way for Saint John the Baptist's head!
Move along.
Move along, there.
Move along from the Baptist's head.
Give generously!
Good enough, brother.
Fast or slow, you'll get your 500 years.
Enough!
Name of the deceased and relation?
Hendrick Luther.
Grandfather.
An Our Father on every step.
When you reach the top of the stairs,
Hendrick will be released from Purgatory and into the gates of Heaven.
Name of the deceased and relation?
Wolfram Eschen, uncle.
An Our Father on every step.
When you reach the top of the stairs,
Wolfram will be released from Purgatory and into the gates of Heaven.
You are back from Rome almost two weeks.
Two weeks, and scarcely alert, even in the confessional.
As your father in Christ,
I order you to speak.
Rome is a circus... a running sewer.
You can buy anything... sex, salvation.
They have brothels just for clerics.
As they probably do in Leipzig.
One church had the coins for which Judas sold our Lord.
100 years off Purgatory for kissing each one.
And you think Rome unique in such relics?
There are even rumors about the Holy Father himself, that he has a lust for power!
Let's go outside.
What's wrong with here?
Well, this floor... the color.
I like color, but you give your brothers a hard choice... they either learn to scrub like you, or find a way to make your patch a little less sparkling.
Gently, like milking a cow.
The ancients reverenced their bees.
They valued them more than slaves.
Have you ever read the New Testament, Martin?
No, Father.
Not many have, but in Wittenberg you will.
Wittenberg?
A doctorate in theology.
You're sending me away to study?
I'm sending you to the source... the Scriptures.
Christ Himself.
Here I'm losing my faith, feeling like a fool even to pray, and you're sending me away?
You'll preach.
I'd be a fraud as a preacher!
We preach best what we need to learn most.
Do not send me away from you.
God gave you gifts for a purpose.
In Wittenberg, you will be able to change minds, open eyes.
That's what you want, isn't it?
To change things?
Welcome to Wittenberg,
Father Martin.
I am Ulrick Wender.
I'll be helping you in the parish.
Gunter and I have caught some fish for your first meal among us.
Wender. That's a Dutch name.
I was born in Utrecht.
We have to stop for Hanna.
She's a little... well, she keeps a child hidden in the forest.
A child living in the forest?
A crippled child.
If we don't buy the wood, the little thing doesn't get fed.
Wood, brother?
Half or full bundle?
As much as this will buy.
This is our new priest,
Father Martin.
Hello, Hanna.
Thank you, Hanna.
Otto!
Good morning, Otto!
This is our new preacher,
Father Martin.
Father.
I look forward to seeing you at Mass.
Good luck, there.
Get back to your work, Thomas!
You'd think I was a leper.
They thought you were coming for a collection.
They thought I wanted their money?
No, they thought the Pope wanted their money.
Every time a new priest comes, they have to pay Rome for the privilege of sacraments.
Nulla salus Extra ecclesiamm.
This debate has raged for over 1,400 years, from the earliest days of the church, but now the Fifth Lateran Council has reaffirmed
Saint Cyprian's famous dictum,
"Nulla salus Extra ecclesiamm... outside the Holy Roman church, there is no salvation."
Professor Carlstadt.
What of the Greek Christians?
The Greek Christians?
Well, an early church document clearly states that a Roman bishop, not a Greek, was Saint Peter's successor.
And, of course, it was Peter whom our Lord Christ made His representative on earth.
So we must consider the saints of the Greek church to be damned?
You miss the point.
But that is the inevitable consequence of Cyprian's claim...
Greek Christians are outside salvation.
Or is this claim based on an over-literal reading of Matthew 16:18...
"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock,
I will build my church."
Yet two lines earlier, in verse 16, we find the very foundation of our faith...
"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Surely the more universal we make these great words, the nearer we come to the mind of Christ.
You question the authority of the church council, sir?
Not at all.
Though in 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council allowed that Cyprian could be wrong and salvation could exist outside the church... though not outside Christ.
Thomas! Thomas!
Why would he do such a thing?
If only we knew what was in his head.
What does God say, Father, for suicide?
I never... Never said
I had the answers.
I defy you, devil! You...
I know your handiwork!
You and your stinking lies!
Shaming... shaming... shaming a mother, telling her to hide her broken child, telling her boy to kill himself!
Brother Martin, the boy's damned!
I'm not allowed to do this!
The others won't rest with him in here!
This is holy ground!
He's a suicide!
Tell Otto to bring his son!
Tell him!
Some people say that according to God's justice, this boy is damned because he took his life.
I say it was overcome by the devil.
Is this child any more to blame for the despair that overtook him than an innocent man who is murdered by a robber in the woods?
God must be mercy.
God is mercy.
He is yours. Save him.
Terrible. Unforgiving.
That's how I saw God.
Punishing us in this life, committing us to Purgatory after death, sentencing sinners to burn in hell for all eternity.
But I was wrong.
Those who see God as angry... do not see Him rightly... but look upon a curtain as if a dark storm cloud has been drawn across His face.
If we truly believe that Christ is our Savior... then we have a God of love, and to see God in faith is to look upon
His friendly heart.
So when the devil throws your sins in your face and declares that you deserve death and hell, tell him this...
"I admit that I deserve death and hell. What of it?
"For I know One who suffered and made satisfaction in my behalf.
"His name is Jesus Christ,
Son of God.
Where He is, there I shall be also."
Prince Frederick wants him silenced.
You should have stopped him,
Carlstadt. Forbidden him.
Forbidden him, Spalatin?
To teach theology?
He undermines the prince.
Come on, there is no clear teaching on relics.
When I became a monk,
I believed the monk's cowl would make me holy.
Was I an arrogant fool?
Now they have made me a doctor of divinity, and I'm tempted to believe that this scholar's robe will make me wise.
Well, God once spoke through the mouth of an ass.
Perhaps he's about to do so again.
But I'll tell you straight what I think.
Who here has been to Rome?
Did you buy an indulgence?
No.
I did.
For a silver florin, I freed my grandfather from Purgatory.
For twice that, I could have sprung grandma and Uncle Marcus too, but I didn't have the funds, so they had to stay in the hot place.
As for myself, the priests assured me that by gazing at sacred relics,
I could cut down my time in Purgatory.
Luckily for me, Rome had enough nails from the Holy Cross to shoe every horse in Saxony.
But there are relics elsewhere in Christendom.
Eighteen out of twelve apostles are buried in Spain.
And yet here in Wittenberg, we have the pick of the crop... bread from the Last Supper, milk from the Virgin's breast, a thorn that pierced
Christ's brow on Calvary, and 19,000 other bits of sacred bone, all authenticated sacred relics.
Even John Tetzel himself...
Inquisitor of Poland and Saxony, seller of indulgences extraordinary, connoisseur of relics, envies our collection!
To possess them for a single night, he would willingly surrender five years of his earthly life!
Or 500 years in Purgatory.
And now, good citizens of Wittenberg,
Prince Frederick of Saxony invites you here to his courtyard to witness a mystery play on that ever most popular of subjects... the Day of Judgment.
Just like old times, Martin.
Excellency.
Secretary.
Prince's secretary.
Such secretaries have a habit of becoming Excellencies.
Even when we were law students,
I had you marked for great things.
I was hoping you may be of some help in that regard.
Prince Frederick is exceedingly proud of his relics.
Then I'm sorry he didn't hear my lecture.
Perhaps I could have swayed him.
He spent 20 years and a large fortune building his collection, that in a week's time, on All Saints' Day, thousands of faithful Christians are coming to see.
Paying to see.
Contributions are customary for indulgences, along with confession and true penitence.
Ah, yes.
The right prayers, the right coins, and 1,900,202 years and 27 days less in Purgatory.
Do not bite the hand that feeds you, Martin.
Our prince pays for your chair in this university.
His relics pay for your chair.
And he who pays the piper... calls the tune.
Do not embarrass him.
No one is more delighted with your popularity here.
He'd prefer you stay.
Master Kranauer, is Luther open to persuasion?
Not likely, my prince.
He's as bitable as...
As a donkey, you were going to say?
Indeed, indeed.
I am conscious of the great honor you do me, Cardinal Cajetan, in recommending me to His Holiness.
I doubt you'll think it an honor
20 years from now, Aleander.
My first master was Pope Alexander VI.
Three mistresses, five children, and a most fervent devotion to bullfighting.
Pope Julius ll... a month ago, he was spiritual leader of the whole world.
Quite dignified-looking, isn't he?
But it's not what Julius wanted.
He wanted to be remembered as a warrior, sitting on his horse, sword in hand, besieging the Venetians.
What is it you seek, Aleander?
To serve God.
To serve him with all my heart.
And that is how you will be tempted.
Pope Leo X, sovereign bishop of Rome, successor to Saint Peter and holy head of the Roman Catholic church.
I've been longing for someone to save Christendom.
Let us pray he's come.
Your reputation precedes you, Aleander.
Then I am fearful.
Cardinal Cajetan says you're a brilliant scholar, yet possess a fervent desire to serve.
I have need of such gifts.
Excellency.
Albert of Brandenburg wants to be Archbishop of Mainz.
He's already archbishop of two German territories.
Correct.
Then canon law disqualifies him from holding a third.
Moreover, wasn't he underage when granted his first post?
Just so.
Even as I myself was.
Doubtless Cajetan has informed you that I was made cardinal at the age of 13.
Albert's ambition could still serve God's glory.
The Turks at the gates of Vienna.
The French are yapping at my heels, and Rome itself has become an open sewer filled with wild dogs and cats by day and brigands and fornicators by night.
And this new
Basilica of Saint Peter's, it's not just a building,
Aleander, it's a symbol of my intent to restore Christ's church.
And Albert could be a minor blessing in that.
He offers 10,000 ducats for Mainz.
But Albert is bankrupt.
You're well-informed.
The Fuggers will lend him the money.
The imperial bankers?
An eight-year loan.
And how would he repay them?
John Tetzel.
There, that's him!
Father John Tetzel!
Don't unfurl the banners until the fire ignites.
Everything has been prepared exactly as you instructed.
Welcome, Father Tetzel!
Come on, people!
Gather round!
Good people of Juterbog... have you ever burned your hand in the fire?
Even one finger made raw by the flame will torment you throughout the night.
Is it not so?
Yes!
Imagine, then, your entire body burning.
Not for one sleepless night... not for a week, but for all eternity!
Are we to be spared the fires of damnation on the Judgment Day?
Tonight, your Pope, the vicar of Christ, sends you a gift, a gift to save you from such fires, a special indulgence granted for the building of Saint Peter's Church in Rome... where the bones of the apostles lie moldering, exposed to wind and rain, desecrated by wild animals.
Take heed the words of your Holy Father who says,
"Lay a stone for Saint Peter's,
"and you lay the foundation for your own salvation and happiness in heaven."
How? With this indulgence.
When? Tonight, and only tonight.
Seek the Lord while he is near.
Here is your raft.
Take hold!
In Heaven, there is a treasure chest filled with merit.
Merit from Christ Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the saints, who, through their holy lives, have merit to spare for us poor sinners in need.
Tonight, that treasury is open to you.
Do you not hear their voices, the screaming voices?
Your deceased parents.
Grandparents.
Uncles, aunts screaming.
Beloved child.
Beloved child.
Because, for a few coins, you can rescue them from their punishments and pain.
Listen.
Open your ears.
Father calling to son, mother to daughter.
When a coin in the coffer rings, the soul from Purgatory springs.
God-fearing man, do you have a coin for Christ?
Yes.
Gentle mother... when the time comes, make certain your crippled child can run to Jesus.
These learned monks are standing by to write down your name or the name of a loved one, dead or alive, on this... your passport to the celestial joys of Paradise.
Name?
We can preach until we're hoarse, but if we cannot bring the Christ of the Gospels to our people...
...what do we offer them?
Dr. Martin!
I did this for Grete.
Issued by the Archbishop of Mainz.
Where did you get this?
Juterbog.
I bought it in the church.
It's just paper, Hanna.
These words mean... nothing.
It's no good?
You must put your trust in God's love.
Save your money to feed Grete.
"To Albert of Mainz.
"father in Christ and most illustrious prince.
"forgive me that I should dare to write to you.
"I make bold because it is my duty to serve you
"and to warn you of the crooked practices of those who claim to represent Your Grace."
"Christ did not command the preaching of indulgences. but of the Gospel."
Forward this to Rome.
"Christians are to be taught
"that he who gives to the poor
"or lends to the needy does a better deed than he who buys indulgences."
"If the Pope can empty Purgatory, why would he not do so out of love rather than for money?"
My God, who is this Martin Luther?
Fritz!
What?
Dr. Luther wanted everyone to see that!
And everyone will.
Good people of Magdeburg, take hold of the raft while you still can.
So much grace for so little coin!
German money for the German church.
Does Saint Peter lie in a German church?
Or Saint Paul?
We don't need your saints.
Or any of the holy apostles?
With this indulgence,
I can absolve any sin.
I can even save the soul of the man who violates the mother of God herself.
One-fifth of the usual take.
How will you explain this to Rome?
Damn that heretic!
He will burn in hell.
This drunken little German monk is intoxicated with himself.
Sober him.
Why was Prince Frederick not apprised of your letter to Albert of Mainz?
Why?
I did not want him compromised.
Now our prince can swear before God he had no knowledge of my writings or my criticism of the Archbishop.
Criticism of the Archbishop?
What of your criticism of Rome?
Do you have any idea how embarrassing this is to Prince Frederick, his prize professor of theology drawing condemnation from the Pope?
My criticism was not of the Holy Father himself, but of those rogues who claim to represent him.
You have been summoned to appear by Rome.
You are threatened with excommunication.
But I'm a loyal son of the church!
I don't believe the Pope would issue such a summons.
Welcome to the world of politics, Doctor.
Martin...
Lay low.
Do not write a single word to anyone until I have a chance to sort this out.
They've already published my explanations of the 95 Theses.
I dedicated it to Pope Leo.
Clearly, clearly you've heard the rumors... that the Pope has summoned me to Augsburg.
Well, it's true.
It's true, and I pray fervently he will find no fault with me.
But think on this while I am gone.
We obsess... over relics.
Indulgences.
Pilgrimages to holy places.
Yet all the time, all the time, there is Christ.
Christ. Christ, here... in every corner, in every hour of the day.
He isn't found in the bones of saints... but here, in your love for each other, in your love for one another... in His sacraments, and in God's holy word.
If we, if we live the word, by faith... in love and service to one another, we need fear no man's judgment.
Good to see you.
Thank you.
Martin, the faculty stands behind you.
I have written a letter of protest, and I'll be the first to sign should they arrest you in Augsburg.
Thank you, Carlstadt.
Thank you.
Bless you. Bless you.
Father.
Are you in trouble?
What happens now?
I honestly don't know.
Well...
Father, thank you.
Thank you, Father.
Just try to keep your big mouth shut.
Father.
She wants you to know that she prays for you every night.
Father.
Have I.?
Have I caused you trouble too?
I'm here to get you through this.
They've stopped
Tetzel from preaching.
He's in Leipzig under house arrest.
That's a good sign, isn't it?
That means that Rome must understand.
It just means he went too far.
Martin.
Martin, listen to me.
Cardinal Cajetan didn't bring you here to teach him the Scriptures.
I beg you in God's name to have a care.
Be temperate.
Don't talk, just listen.
Your life could depend on it.
He's waiting for you.
I am Girolamo Aleander, representing Cardinal Cajetan.
Your meeting won't take long.
I'm here to prepare you for tonight.
Please.
Sit.
It was never my intention to say anything against the honor and the dignity of our Holy Father.
Of course not, Brother Martin.
And that being the case, that we all desire peace, you only have to follow a few simple rules of protocol.
When you meet the Cardinal, you will throw yourself on the floor, face to the ground.
The Cardinal will tell you to stand, at which time you will kneel and remain kneeling throughout your hearing.
Do you understand?
Yes.
If the church takes exception to a single point,
I will submit to her immediately.
But I'm sure when the Cardinal and Pope Leo understand my position... they'll find no fault with me.
We have a misunderstanding.
There will be no discussion.
No debate.
You have one word to say and one word only.
Revoco...
I recant... and the matter is over.
I think we do have a misunderstanding.
I came to Augsburg to warn the Pope about the abuses against the faithful by the indulgence preachers.
Have a care, Brother Martin.
It is the Pope who shall decide what is or is not beneficial to Christendom.
This evening, one word.
Revoco.
Thank you, Excellency.
Brother Martin... with your permission,
I'm going to arrange a bath for you.
Thank you, Excellency.
My son, I know you desire to be a faithful servant of Christ and His church.
I am here to help you.
Stand on your feet, my son.
What do you have to say?
Have I erred?
Yes, you have erred.
How?
That I may avoid such error again.
You have erred by teaching new doctrines.
Which of my teachings is offensive to Rome?
For one, indulgences.
Pope Clement's decree,
Unigenitus. clearly states that the merits of Christ are a treasure of indulgences.
Acquire.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
I think you'll find it says...
"The merits of Christ acquire the treasure of indulgences."
I am not here to wrangle with you.
No, Your Grace.
But Unigenitus was issued
175 years ago, and were this decree not so embarrassing to our church, perhaps it would not be commonly called Extravagante and left out of most collections of canon law.
It contradicts Anommitanos.
Our present Pope Leo is in harmony with Clement's decree... and there ends the matter.
The honor of the Papacy is not preserved by the naked assertion of Papal authority, but by safeguarding the Pope's credibility and the clear testimonies of divine Scripture.
The Pope interprets Scripture.
He may interpret it... but he is not above it.
He was to say one word.
We both know the selling of indulgences have no Scriptural support.
If common people could read the Bible for themselves, they would understand just how broad the church's interpretations are.
That is outrageous!
The Scriptures are too complex for even the average priest to understand, much less the common man!
Indulgences are an established tradition which give comfort to millions of simple Christians.
Comfort? Your Grace,
I'm not interested in comfort.
Comfort is not the issue!
So you consider your discomfort more important than the survival of Christianity?
I'm interested in the truth!
The truth?
The Turks are building armies on our eastern borders.
We are on the brink of war.
To the west, lies a world of souls who have never heard the name of Christ.
That is the truth!
Christianity is tearing apart, and just when we need unity most, you create confusion!
My goal is not to quarrel with the Pope or the church, but to defend them with more than mere opinion.
The Gospel cannot be denied for the word of man.
I refuse to argue with that monk.
You said he was a simpleton.
He questioned the Pope's authority.
Anommitanos.
Unigenitus.
Or shall we call it Extravagante like the rest of the world?
He's a heretic.
Our orders were clear.
Either he recant...
Do not presume to lecture me, Aleander.
I know perfectly well what our orders were.
I kept my temper and merely asked to be shown the error of my ways.
If you do not recant, you will be delivered to the Inquisition.
Will you recant?
What?
Then there is only one way to save your life.
Kneel.
Kneel!
Martin Luther, in the name of Christ,
I release you from your vows to the Augustinian order and commend you to God's mercy.
I'm no longer your father, do you understand?
Were I your father, then under canon law,
I would be obligated to deliver you to the authorities!
But I'll be your spiritual father... until the day I die.
Now go.
Go quickly!
There is a horse at the back gate.
Don't leave me alone,
Father. Please.
Father!
My prince. how shall I answer?
The Cardinal demands that Luther be delivered to Rome or banished from Saxony.
Have you read Luther's work?
Yes, all of it.
Yes. He's a brilliant little monk, isn't he, with an independent mind.
Yes, he is.
Oh, Spalatin, you were at law school with him, weren't you?
Did he show any inclination then of surrender to influence?
No.
After all, all he has done is to debate, eloquently, on a most interesting subject.
And, after all, that is all one can ask a good university professor to do.
So what shall we say to the Cardinal?
Nothing.
My lord, we have to respond.
Spalatin, there are two ways of saying no to someone you believe to be stronger than yourself.
The first is to say nothing and go on merely doing what you were doing before, and pretend that you never heard, allow time and inertia to be your allies.
And the second?
And the second is to say no in such a kind and thoughtful way it befuddles them.
Naturally, if both these strategies fail, there is nothing but to relent.
Or to fight!
And of course, if you decide to fight, you also have to decide to win.
No, I'm not going to send my monk to Rome.
They'll only kill him.
It's so irritating.
Who are they to deprive my university of such a fine mind?
Your little German monk is still spewing filth at us.
He has a new cartoon circulating.
He calls you an ass playing a harp, Cajetan.
The point, Your Holiness, is that he does not write in Latin.
Luther writes in German.
That is his sword.
So he does not play like a gentleman?
Ordinary Germans can quote his work.
If we wait, we might be too late.
You exaggerate his importance.
Besides, you told me yourself you agree with his list of abuses.
Some of his concerns have long been held by those who love the church, yes.
I don't suppose your little monk would be interested in a cardinal's hat?
I think he would be ashamed to wear it, Your Holiness.
We must put pressure on Prince Frederick, Excellency.
Aleander is right.
Frederick is our key to Luther.
Germany is on the brink of chaos, and we don't want to divide the church.
I grow tired of you missing the big picture, Cajetan.
That's why I've sent Karl von Miltitz to Germany in your stead.
My lord, greetings from our most Holy Father.
As for me, I am especially honored to meet you, as all of Christendom knows of your steadfast devotion to the faith.
I have brought you a gift from our Holy Father... to express his highest esteem for your lordship, for, as you know, my lord, this most sacred rose is consecrated annually by Pope Leo himself, and sent to just one favored prince in recognition of heroic loyalty and devotion to Christ's holy church.
Spalatin, I'm sorry for keeping you so late, but this is a matter of some urgency.
First of all, give Miltitz 600 ducats as an expression of our gratitude.
My lord, the rose is hardly worth so much.
Oh, I know that.
And then tell them that we will not deliver Luther to Rome.
And get that... that rose...
Put it among the relics, and while you're about it, move all the relics out.
Move them to someplace
I don't even know where they are.
I don't want to know where they are. I want...
Go on.
When I was a child,
I thought like a child,
I was a child,
I played like a child.
And now, thanks to the adults,
I've had to join the world of adults.
And I am appalled... by how easy they thought it was to bribe me!
Armed horsemen!
Over there!
What is so important that you interrupt us?
Prince Frederick of Saxony.
He refuses to surrender Luther to you, Your Holiness.
Go! Go, go!
Arise, O Lord. and judge thy cause.
A wild boar has invaded thy vineyard.
We can no longer suffer the serpent to creep through the field of the Lord.
The books of Martin Luther are to be examined and burned.
Anyone who presumes to infringe our excommunication and anathema will stand under the wrath of Almighty God and the Apostles Peter and Paul.
Amen.
You can burn his books, but you can't burn his ideas!
Go back to Rome, you butchers!
Go burn your own books!
Go burn the Pope's books!
Papist devils!
Papist devils, leave us!
By order of His Holiness,
Pope Leo X... the works of Martin Luther shall be erased from the memory of man!
Martin Luther speaks the truth!
Devils.
Here, Father!
Find someone else to do it!
He belongs to us!
This... is what Rome calls a Papal Bull, an edict from the Pope himself.
There's only one thing to do with this blast of wind.
Yes! Feed the fire!
Feed the fire with canon law!
Feed the fire with every lie ever written in Rome!
Come on, feed it!
Feed the flames!
Feed it!
That's right, feed the flames!
Feed the flames!
Feed them!
My Emperor.
My good uncle.
Allow me to extend my congratulations on your elevation.
I've come to speak to you about Martin Luther.
Our Holy Father has sent his new cardinal to advise us.
Oh! You mean you've traveled all the way from Rome just in order to advise us about this small matter?
Heresy is never a small matter, my lord.
Your Highness, if I might for a moment have your ear.
If your business is Martin Luther...
My business is Saxony, sir...
...and I wish a brief audience with my Emperor.
Deliver Luther to Rome.
I cannot.
He's my subject. It's my duty to see that he gets a fair hearing.
Aleander has given me his word that the Inquisition will give Luther a proper hearing.
The Rome Inquisition does not give hearings, my lord.
It gives death sentences.
And the whole of Germany prays that you will defend her.
The heretic must be tried.
Your blessed grandfather
Maximilian told us that no German subject would ever be condemned without a fair trial in his own country.
Then we shall hear him in Germany.
In Worms.
Worms is still a very long way from Wittenberg, my lord, and the Pope himself has put a bounty on Luther's head.
His spies are everywhere, in defiance of my humble rule, and therefore, sir, in defiance of your greater rule.
Then I will ensure
Martin Luther's safe conduct to a fair hearing.
I myself shall send you an imperial guard to escort him.
On that you have my word.
Oh, yes.
Martin Luther is coming!
Bless us, Father!
Please bless us!
Help my family, please, Doctor!
Give us your blessing!
Don't kneel to me.
I'm no saint.
Bless me, Father!
Bless me, Father!
Father! Bless me, Father!
I thought you had abandoned me.
I thought I was alone again in this world.
Be still, Martin.
One slip, and you'll save the Emperor a trial.
I'm here to serve you.
I jest because I'm so afraid.
Martin, I hoped you'd help reform the church, not destroy it.
With all its sins, the church is still the church.
What is a child without its family?
How would people fare left to themselves, helpless and frightened?
All my life, I have seen a world that hates evil more than it loves good.
I beg you to look to the good, Martin.
You are tearing the world apart.
That day when you sent me out so boldly to change the world...
Did you really think there wouldn't be a cost?
It is simply a matter of individual conscience.
They'll burn him for sure.
Do you, Martin Luther, recognize these books?
The 95 Theses. A Sermon on Indulgence and Grace.
The Babylonian Captivity.
Freedom of a Christian.
Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation?
Are you the author?
All are mine.
These books contain heresies against our holy church.
Do you recant what you've written?
I...
Please, God, let him say the right thing.
I was...
Speak up.
May I have time to consider?
You have had the time, and you should have been prepared to answer.
I would like to answer satisfactorily, without injury to the divine word or danger to my soul.
Any one of us might be expected to bear witness, unequivocally and fearlessly at any time.
All the more in your case, a famous, experienced professor of theology.
We grant you one day.
Tomorrow you shall answer.
Damn you, go back to hell!
Damn you, damn you, damn you!
Damn you, go back to hell!
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Shut up! I feel your foul breath on my neck!
Happy devil you are, to see me mute!
Shaking... shaking like an animal at the slaughter!
Oh, my, yes.
Well, where is his faith now?
Where's his faith now?
Where's his boasting now?
Where's his boasting.?
I am yours. Save me.
I am yours.
Save me.
I am yours.
Save me.
Speak well, Doctor.
Good luck, Martin.
Good luck.
Good luck, Martin.
God be with you.
I pray Thee do Thy will.
Order in the hall.
Order!
Order!
Martin Luther, are you the author of these writings?
I am.
Do you recant what you have written here?
I cannot renounce all of my works because they are not all the same.
First are those books in which
I have described Christian faith and life so simply that even my opponents have admitted that these works are useful.
To renounce these writings would be unthinkable, for that would be to renounce accepted Christian truths.
He is not here to make speeches, only to answer.
The second group of my work is directed against the foul doctrine and evil living of the Popes, past and present.
No!
Yes!
Through the laws of the Pope and the doctrines of men, the consciences of the faithful have been miserably vexed and flayed.
If I recant these books...
I will do nothing but add strength to tyranny and open not just the windows but also the doors to this great ungodliness.
He has condemned himself.
In the third group,
I have written against private persons and individuals who uphold Roman tyranny and have attacked my own efforts to encourage piety to Christ.
I confess... that I have written too harshly.
I am but a man and I can err.
Only let my errors be proven by Scripture... and I will revoke my work and throw my books into the fire.
You have not answered the question.
You, Martin Luther, will not draw into doubt those things which the Catholic church has judged already, things that have passed into usage, rite, and observance... the faith that Christ, the most perfect Lawgiver, ordained, the faith the martyrs strengthened with their blood.
You wait in vain for a disputation over things that you are obligated to believe.
Now give your answer.
Yes or no?
Will you recant or will you not?
Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships desire a simple reply...
I will answer.
Unless I am convinced by Scripture and by plain reason... and not by Popes and councils who have so often contradicted themselves... my conscience is captive to the word of God.
To go against conscience is neither right nor safe.
I cannot... and I will not recant.
Here I stand.
I can do no other.
God help me.
Yes, Martin!
The man's a heretic!
He's a prophet of God!
Order!
Young Martin walks out!
You have your answer!
Order!
Order!
Order!
Luther!
No, it's not that simple.
Luther!
...the word of God!
Luther! Luther!
God bless you, Martin!
Luther!
Luther! Luther! Luther!
Make way!
I am descended from a line of Christian emperors.
You will not make a heretic of me.
He has condemned himself,
Excellency.
He must be stopped before he infects all of Germany.
My lord, you gave Luther the promise of a safe conduct.
Luther's not a man but a demon, clothed in his religious habit, the better to deceive us.
Martin Luther's your subject.
What do you say?
He is too daring for me, my lord.
Although not, it seems, for the people.
If anything should happen to him on the way back... so be it.
Thank you!
God bless your journey home,
Brother Martin!
You'll always be in our hearts, Martin!
Truth will out, Brother Martin!
God be with you!
Why are they leaving us?
Wait.
Martin.
Martin Luther, step down and your comrade will be spared.
I'm Luther.
Ulrick, no!
I am Luther.
Spalatin!
Sorry about the rough ride.
Prince Frederick was keen to nab you before someone else did.
They may have murdered Luther. but they will not stop what we have started.
The holy war has just begun!
Any man who holds himself up as the master of others, whether he be prince,
Pope, priest, even professor, must repent... must repent or be cut down!
You call me Professor Carlstadt.
No more!
From this day forward,
I am Brother Andreas.
Yes.
And all of you, likewise, prepare yourselves for the great leveling!
Yes!
"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image."
Learn to despise props and pretensions.
Stand with the righteous, or be cut down with the others.
There is no middle ground!
Teach us!
Martin would never have shamed a student for wearing a crucifix!
I know Martin Luther.
I discovered him.
He said reform.
You want revolt!
If you haven't got the stomach to finish what he started, Melanchthon, step aside.
Why are you babbling in riddles?
Beware, or you too shall be cut down.
What?
I asked for a Greek New Testament.
I need proper books, not this rubbish.
And a Greek-German dictionary.
Leave us.
And a Greek-Latin dictionary.
This is not the time, Martin.
Well, the Emperor's going to burn me, anyway.
He'll burn us all.
This is treason.
To have a New Testament in German, in words ordinary people can understand?
Yes!
It's the thing Rome fears most.
Well, you must blame the Author for that.
The wall... break it down!
Make breaches!
No popes! No witches!
No priests!
This cursed house... pull her down!
Come out, you...
How do you expect to do this?
Just give us our rights!
Blasphemers!
We must send in soldiers.
And cause more bloodshed?
If Wittenberg cannot settle its religious problems without that, then the rest of the world will not be impressed.
Send for Luther.
How's the work?
Tricky.
Words are like children... the more care you lavish on them, the more they demand.
Rather like women.
I wouldn't know.
Take this verse in Saint Luke...
"It is the father's will that nothing be lost."
In our language, the word"will" denotes strength, willpower, bending someone to your will.
But in the original Greek, this three-letter word denotes passion, fire, inner organs.
It can mean beloved, desire, even sexual desire.
Eat your porridge.
You're not even listening.
Besides, porridge does nothing for my bowels.
No, it's not the word that's important, but what it's saying about God.
You are too much alone here.
"You are too much alone here."
Oh, very good, Spalatin.
Two weeks since you last came.
Of course I'm too much alone!
How can I write for our people when I don't live among them?
The language of the Bible should be like a mother talking to her children.
Well, it's decided,
Martin Luther must not leave this room.
But Knight George... may.
It's time you saw for yourself, Martin.
Why? Why were they killed?
No reason.
Just happened to be in the wrong place, got in the way of a mob of peasants looting a monastery.
The whole world's been turned upside-down by that madman Luther.
And him saying that every Christian has the right to take what they need by force.
Well, Luther's gone, but his damned ideas have set the whole earth on fire.
Soon this country will be blazing.
Please! Let me go in the name of God!
Help me!
Please stop!
Take off your Roman dresses or have them burnt off!
Cowards! Cowards!
Cowards!
How dare you?
You call yourselves Christians?
Christians?!
You, why are you standing there?
Put out this fire!
Run! Buckets! Shovels! Run!
When a limb is rotten, you must cut it off.
You know that as well as I.
Get out!
Martin, this is for you!
Let it burn!
Get out of Wittenberg before I beat you out!
Beat me out?
I defended you.
I supported you.
I'm carrying on just as you would have.
You think this is my work?
This is never my work!
No, it's the people's work!
The people's work!
It's the people's work.
The people's work!
Spalatin.
Are you there?
Now, how is he?
Luther's depressed, my lord.
Confused.
He feels the peasants have twisted his language.
But he will join them?
Luther abhors violence.
But he's in sympathy with their grievances?
It's hard to argue against freeing people from crippling taxes or the purgatory of being born slaves all their lives.
You know, if Luther were to lift one finger, every peasant in Germany would rise up behind him.
Maybe.
Luther's a theologian, my lord.
He fights, but with his tongue or his pen.
He will not draw the sword.
I have finally torn the world apart.
I urged the princes to action. and how they have answered my call!
I said these rebels were outside God's law. that nothing on earth is more poisonous, hurtful, or devilish than a rebel. that they must be stopped by every means possible.
And yet the blood they sled is as nothing compared to this slaughter
I have unleashed.
You don't want to go in there, sir.
It's over.
Yes. It's over.
How many?
No one knows yet.
How many?
Some say 50,000.
Some 100. dead peasants.
There were knights among them.
That's a plague, Spalatin.
That's butchery.
Have a care, Martin.
You may need these butchers.
Grete.
We are seeking Dr. Luther.
Please. My sisters and I escaped three days ago from the convent at Nimbschen.
And... you still came here?
Because this is where Dr. Luther lives.
Sir, we were smuggled out in these herring barrels.
We've been two nights on an open wagon, have had no rest, no food, no sleep.
So if you could just tell me...
I...
I'm Luther.
Katharina von Bora.
Martin Luther.
But you know that already.
I'll take you to a shelter.
Who's there?
No.
Martin Luther?
My lord.
Well. We meet at last.
I dedicated this work to you, my lord.
The translation of the New Testament... into our own language.
Into German?
But this will separate us from Rome... forever.
I have always sought Christian unity, but not at the price of servitude.
I answer to God's law, not Roman.
Roman law is the reality.
I believe in the reality of Christ.
With no compromises?
None.
You realize, of course, they'll take this to be an act of sheer provocation.
Yes.
And they will not hesitate to strike back.
Yes, I know.
Well, so long as you know.
Do you think I could have my present now?
Yes, of course.
Take my heart
And never worry
Evil tongues will mock
We'll mock in turn
For my heart is my gift to thee
Have not a care
Never worry
Stay, Ulrick, stay.
Please.
Marry one of these lovely young women.
I know there's at least one left.
I'll bring God's word to my homeland.
No, this is not a good time.
No prince can protect you there.
I want the Dutch people to know what I experienced when I read His word for the first time.
Then God be with you.
And with you, Martin.
You left so quickly,
I feared it was my singing.
If only it were.
Look at him.
He goes to his fate, hurrying like a bridegroom.
Not all bridegrooms are so fleet.
I would not say the bachelors of Wittenberg have been tardy.
True.
The other nuns are all spoken for.
And you've made it so clear that marriage is an honorable estate... for everyone else, at least.
I see why you scare them.
My grief is that I scare you.
I know you like me, Doctor.
I feel your heart when we make music together.
But when the music ends, you flee.
I'm a man of blood, Katie.
I divide people.
Thousands have died because of me.
Most days I'm so depressed
I can't even get out of bed.
People try to make me a fixed star.
But I'm not.
I'm a wandering planet.
No one should look to me for guidance.
Two things I promise you... we will make joyous music together, and to get to you, your enemies will have to step across my dead body.
In return,
I ask only one thing... that you bring none of them to our marriage bed, not peasants or princes or Popes, unless He be a God of love.
For God's sake, at least get new candles!
There's nothing left except these.
Now!
So much for Leo who would rebuild Rome...
Bankrupt.
800.000 ducats in debt.
Had he lived. He would lave sold the Vatican itself.
But as a Pope, he could have changed the world.
He could have reformed the church instead of just rebuilding it.
Leo was a spiritual dwarf when we needed a giant like Luther.
Well, Luther's getting married.
To a runaway nun.
He wouldn't dare.
If I were to tell you that
Albert of Mainz sent us a wedding present. what would you say?
Send it back.
Then it's as well he did no such thing, or we'd be having our first quarrel.
Martin.
They are going to burn Ulrick!
They caught him at the border.
What is it?
What has happened?
The Emperor summons our princes to Augsburg.
Why?
To finish what he began at Worms.
You mustn't go.
They'll fry you like a suckling pig.
If you die, everything you stand for dies with you.
All right, what will you say? How will you make them change their minds?
I don't know.
Well, I need to know!
Katie, first they wanted me to recant.
Now they want half of Europe to bow the knee.
We must fight!
Let somebody else fight.
Let somebody else be roasted like a pig!
All I want is Luther.
Break the princes, and you break Luther.
Their tactics will be to delay, to bog the process down in detail.
Luther's hymns.
They are.
You must keep the issues simple, Excellency.
They must accept there is only one church.
This plague just goes on spreading.
I should have burned him!
My princes. Brothers in Christ. this isn't a time for caution. but for boldness.
Charles is not the frightened youth you saw at Worms, Dr. Luther.
He has humbled France and sacked Rome itself.
Only the Turk remains a threat to him.
In a word, he has all the time and resource in the world to reduce us to a powder piece by piece, state by state.
And I think he means to do it.
My lords... silence will not save us.
If we challenge Charles, will there be war... the awful shedding of yet more blood?
I honestly don't know. I've mislaid all my former certainties.
But think.
The Emperor invites us to present our creeds, to present what we believe in.
Satan invites us to preach in hell.
Is that a trap?
Or our greatest opportunity so far?
And remember, since I may not come with you to Augsburg, you'll face Charles' wroth alone.
Your choice is simple.
If you give in, my lords, the bright comet that is our faith will shatter and be reduced to a few isolated torches, sputtering in a dark universe.
This way!
And why does the father run to meet his prodigal son?
Landowners don't run.
Noblemen don't run.
Princes don't run.
So why does this rich, landowning father run?
Because he's afraid.
He's so afraid that his son will run back to the filthy pig farm.
He runs because he loves his son.
And there's a special word for this love.
Compassion.
Compassion.
And you know what this word means?
It's just a church bell, Martin, ringing the Angelus.
Continue the story.
Beloved princes of the Empire,
I will be brief and to the point.
Your ministers shall not preach, and you will outlaw these Bibles in the common language and declare anyone who possesses one an enemy of the state.
We will not stop our ministers from preaching the word, here or anywhere else.
Do not concede, my lord.
We will not outlaw the new Bible, my lord.
As a sign of your loyalty to me, tomorrow you shall all march in the Corpus Christi procession to the cathedral and worship, all of you, in the Roman manner.
We will not, my lord.
You will!
Or you shall know my sword.
Before I let anyone take from me the word of God and ask me to deny my belief,
I will kneel and let him strike off my head.
Your Highness, we have drawn up a confession of our faith which I believe you will find blameless.
I am so very happy to have been loved by you...
Katharina von Bora.
Martin! Martin
We did it, Martin
We did it
The Emperor allowed us to read our confession of faith
The princes stood up to him
He had to listen
They can't stop us now,
Martin!
What happened in
Augsburg opened the door to religious freedom and changed the world.
Martin Luther lived, preached and taught God's word another 16 years.
He and Katharina von Bora were happily married and had six children.
His Bible translation laid the foundations for a common German language.
Today about 540 million people celebrate the Mass according to the form developed by Luther.
RUSSIAN ARK
I open my eyes and I see nothing.
I only remember there was some accident.
Everyone ran for safety as best they could.
I just can't remember what happened to me.
How strange. Where am I?
Marie, I must tell you something.
Judging by the clothes, this must be the 1800s.
Where are they rushing to?
What if we are denied entry?
I've never been so frightened!
Don't forget, the girl in white is mine.
Where are you all going?
It's cold! Close the doors!
Quickly!
Move ahead!
I went looking for the right way to go.
Those officers don't know the way.
Can it be that I'm invisible?
Or have I simply gone unnoticed?
Can it be? Has all this been staged for me?
Am I expected to play a role?
What kind of play is this?
Let's hope it's not a tragedy.
What does it all mean?
-Where should we go?
-Maybe here?
No, it's there.
That man in black.... He wanders about, too.
He nods to me but goes away.
Pardon me for speaking before we've been properly introduced.
What city is this?
What city? Well, everyone speaks Russian.
I so hoped this was Chambord during the Directoire period.
-What language are we speaking?
-Russian.
Russian?
How strange! I never knew Russian before.
What are they doing in there?
Shall we enter?
-Where? There?
-Yes, something is going on.
No, I have to find out what on earth I am doing here.
These wanderings about, this knowing Russian....
I want to leave.
Your curiosity is not amusing.
Could all this be theatre?
Farewell!
Our paths must part.
Farewell.
You have answered all my questions.
-Farewell then.
-Where does this door lead to?
What a pity.
We will never meet again.
He was obviously a foreigner.
Why would he be so rude otherwise?
It's best...
not to get involved in this.
Let's not disturb them.
In any case, it's much too late.
Sir, sir! I'm here.
My Russian cicerone! Do you know the way?
-Yes, let's go together.
-This is your country.
Yes, but not my century.
How did I come to be here?
I think I saw Peter the Great.
I hear delight in your voice.
Was it interesting?
Yes, very interesting.
Really.
In Asia, tyrants are adored.
The more terrible the tyrant, the more his memory is cherished.
Alexander the Great, Timur... and your Peter the Great.
You're wrong about Peter.
He taught Russians to enjoy themselves.
A spiral staircase.
Where has everyone disappeared to?
I see. But why?
What's so interesting up there?
You'll see...
Peter ordered his son's execution.
The same man who taught the people to enjoy life. How funny!
I thought you knew where we were going.
He built a European city over a swamp.
He introduced order of the most primitive kind.
-Where are they going?
-But the city is still European!
To a party. But why the back staircase?
They were taught to have fun.
So they go to parties.
And the officer and the lady?
-At the party.
-Where are they?
They've gone to the underworld.
Down, down, down!
And they are no more.
Be careful. The stairs are steep and dark.
Thank you. I can see.
Do you see where we are?
No, I don't know yet.
Sir, be careful!
Don't betray our presence.
No need to remind me.
Do not forget I brought you here.
Please don't get involved in anything.
And you, do not get too close to the actors.
Bend towards me. You are beautiful.
-Do you remember?
-Yes.
Good.
-Why are you pushing me?
-Don't scratch me!
-Why is she pushing me?
-You are pushing, too.
What an impressive orchestra!
They must be Europeans!
No, they're Russian musicians.
No, Europeans!
Italians!
They're Russians, for God's sake!
So?
I say it's good.
Very good!
I need to piss!
I can't hold it in anymore!
No, no, don't, don't....
Ah! Yes, yes.
Sir, sir!
Don't yell!
-Where are you?
-Here. It's only Catherine the Great.
Follow me!
I love the 18th century.
A time of genius and manners.
I would have to agree with you.
-Never contradict me.
-Very well.
Where's the Empress? Gone!
Russia is like a theatre. A theatre.
Careful!
I think I know where we are.
How pretentious they are!
Don't lag behind, sir.
I'm not. I think we're speaking too loudly.
No matter. They're completely deaf.
I'm careful. I won't touch anyone.
Theatre.... What actors!
And those costumes!
Thank you, sirs. Thank you.
They can't see me.
This seems like the Vatican.
Is that where we are?
Those reliefs are painted, are they not?
What naturalism!
Weren't those decorations inspired by Raphael's sketches?
Raphael, yes.
Better than the Vatican.
This is Saint Petersburg.
So they're copies?
Your authorities don't trust your own artists.
Russians are so talented at copying!
Why?
Because you don't have ideas of your own.
Your authorities don't want you to have them.
In fact, they are as lazy as all the rest of you.
Lazy!
There was a painting gallery here.
-On the upper floor.
-With 1 1 1 Italian paintings.
-But not the best masters.
-Not the best.
The tsars were mainly Russophiles.
But sometimes even they dreamed of Italy.
Wasn't the Hermitage created to satisfy those dreams?
-Raphael isn't for you.
-Not for us.
-For Italy.
-Italy.
-It's warm there!
-Warm.
What beauty!
The small Italian gallery....
Who are these people?
Of which milieu are they?
Do you see that vase?
Yes! Empire style is everywhere.
-And those Voronikhine lamps.
-Lamps....
Empire, Empire, Empire!
I have no enthusiasm for it.
That style is too silly.
Don't forget it was born under Bonaparte.
Then it became fashionable here... to the point of becoming the national style... to the detriment of its originality.
We battled Napoleon, not the Empire style.
Who are they? Who are these people?
Petersburgers, of when the city was no longer a capital.
It's better that way.
A capital city should be... an ancient city like Moscow. Not a Chimera.
-Who are these people?
-Should I introduce you?
-Only if it's not impolite.
-No, they are friends.
Oleg Konstantinovich, medical professor.
Lev Mikhailovich, actor.
Shouldn't they rise?
My European friend, he is visiting Russia.
-My pleasure.
-He's European.
Medicine is a fine profession.
I haven't spoken for years.
Aside from my new accomplice.
Such a long time.... What is that odour?
Odour?
A curious odour.
Have you been in Saint Petersburg long?
Yes, for one hour.
-And you came straight here?
-I had my reasons.
You must love art!
Are you interested in beauty or just its representation?
No, Marquis. We're here to rest.
"Marquis"?
How do you rest?
Today, we've come together.
It smells of formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde.
Marquis, I'll show you a splendid painting.
These men are emitting a very strange odour.
Marquis, look at
The Birth of John the Baptist.
The Marquis smells of formaldehyde.
Is he alive?
No, it's you.
I know this painting.
I saw it on my last visit here.
It comes from Paris, from the Crozat collection.
Catherine II acquired it in 1 772.
One of the earliest pieces of the Hermitage collection.
Such information is for specialists.
For us, detail is more interesting.
Look closely here.
A chicken and a cat are in the foreground.
They are symbolic figures.
The chicken represents greed, avarice... the cat, cynicism and cruelty.
Cynicism and cruelty.... The cat....
They are both calmed by the birth of John.
How interesting.
Why is he dressed like that?
Cleopatra, for example....
What do you know of her?
Massimo Stanzione....
Cleopatra is on the same wall...
as The Circumcision of Christ by the pious Lodovico Cardi.
-What bothers you?
-Bothers me?
Right next to Saint Cecilia?
Can you imagine!
By Carlo Dolci!
And next to Eastern Still Life!
-Why does that bother you?
-Don't argue, Oleg.
As a Catholic, that shocks me.
What do you think of Wagner?
Who is Wagner?
Oleg, he doesn't know Wagner!
Wagner is that child who behaved badly... with my best friend, Meyerbeer.
I have never listened to Wagner.
-Broaden your horizons!
-That doctor is so insistent!
-But I'm not sick!
-We wish you much success.
Sir, why are they badly dressed?
My friends, how could I think...
that you would get along so badly?
I'll tell you one day.
I'm in a strange situation.
Why quarrel with everyone?
If you do, we will never discover why we are here.
Such clothing kills a man's creative essence!
Why do you find it necessary to embrace European culture?
For what reason?
Why borrow also Europe's mistakes?
My God! What is all this?
Mother!
Canova!
What an elevated approach to art!
What feel for the material!
How wonderful!
He is a true heir to the masters of antiquity!
Canova almost married my mother.
Was your mother a sculptress?
Yes. In Rome.
In Rome? Your mother, a sculptress....
In this Canova collection, there are even sculptures...
that Tsar Alexander bought from the wife....
Of Napoleon?
Yes.
It was 1815, I was at the Congress of Vienna.
What were you doing there?
-I was a diplomat.
-A diplomat?
This collection was the object of a harsh dispute.
Look where we are now!
Is this a dream?
Maybe, maybe.
I don't know about you, but I'm wide awake!
It's amazing how well I speak Russian!
Yes, quite well.
Who was that small man?
Wasn't that Pushkin?
-Good day.
-Good day.
Is that your great poet? Your beloved one?
I read him in French. Nothing special.
Sir.
My God, how touchy you are!
Pardon me!
I'm sorry if I've offended your nationalist sympathy.
What is that, nationalist sympathy?
What's that there?
-Please....
-Who is that?
Please don't rush.
All alone, without an escort?
It would be wiser not to talk to that lady.
Don't bother her.
Let's move along.
Excuse me, madam, have you lost your guide?
Thank you for your concern.
I know everything here.
Of course. Do you work here?
Not at all. I'm here to admire the works of the old masters.
Would you accompany me into the next salon?
To see the Flemish masters?
With pleasure. Your slender fingers see all.
-1 40 paces, straight ahead.
-1 40, is that so?
How many are left?
Watch your step.
-One cannot be so intrusive, I told you.
-It's not the right time for this.
It's all your fault.
-You are compromising me!
-Oh, don't.
How dare you! Quiet!
-We're here.
-Yes.
Can we go closer to that painting?
Would you like me to tell you about it?
The Virgin with Partridges by van Dyck.
Catherine II acquired it.
Tell me about this painting.
Please, tell me.
See the calm and serenity around the Madonna and Joseph.
-Joseph, yes.
-God protects them.
There is no doubt about his unseen presence.
The apple tree represents life.
Sunflowers stand for piety.
On the upper right, partridges symbolise frivolity.
-They're flying away.
-Partridges....
Angels dance and play.
So many other symbols that we can only guess about.
Sir, leave her. She's an angel.
Why have you gone quiet?
The partridges, the children, the Madonna....
Thank you, madam. Thank you.
I highly value your opinion on the works of van Dyck.
You'll definitely be interested in another painting.
Be very careful!
A Rubens.
Sir, do not disturb me!
The Feast in the House of Simon the Pharisee.
The Pharisee....
I don't see it.
Where is it?
Thirty-six, thirty-five....
No, that painting isn't here.
Not part of the Tsar's collection.
Yes, it's here.
That particular Rubens is not here!
Yes, it was from Lord Walpole's collection...
like The Virgin with Partridges.
But that Rubens isn't on exhibit.
But it's here.
-Where are you?
-What a wonderful scent!
The scent of oils....
Sir, let's leave here now.
No, let's stay a while.
What wonderful paintings!
What are those men counting?
You were right. I found it.
Let's take a closer look.
There it is.
We're almost there.
Face the painting directly.
There it is.
Yes, there it is.
-Something to say about Rubens?
-Van Dyck.
Rubens considered van Dyck to be his best pupil.
You know, there was a time when all these paintings... were placed much higher and much closer to one another.
The Tsar himself supervised how they were hung. Did you know this?
-Who are you?
-I'm a sailor.
-Insignias.
-Yes, the Navy.
The Tsar visited his collection every morning.
He personally saved all this... during the fire.
-Which fire?
-In 18....
So you are asking me?
Enough, let's go.
It's time for me to go.
May I accompany you?
What a pity.
I must ask you to leave.
The museum is closing.
Please see yourself to the exit.
Quiet. Close the door.
The museum is closing.
-How was my scene?
-I wasn't impressed.
I was joking.
Joking....
-Do you hear music?
-I hear something.
Russian music makes me break out in hives.
That has nothing to do with the music.
Why do you look at me like that?
-Rags.... A dog....
-Rags.... A dog....
-Eternal people....
-Eternal people....
Live and go on living.
-You'll outlive them all.
-Eternal people....
What are you doing? Eavesdropping?
Are you interested in painting?
What nice little hands!
Stay away from me!
Amen. Amen.
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Absolutely.
-Are you Catholic?
-No, I'm not Catholic.
Why do you ask?
It seemed to me that you were deep in thought... while admiring the images of the founders of our church.
I don't know. I wasn't thinking about that.
You were not....
Do you know that those are the apostles Peter and Paul?
Yes, that's what I heard.
That's what you heard. And so?
I looked at them because I like them.
You like them....
-One day, all men...
-All men....
-...will become like them.
-Really?
How can you know what will become of people...
if you don't know the Scriptures?
Why aren't you saying anything?
Look at their hands.
The hands are beautiful. And so?
How can you know what will become of people...
if you don't know the Scriptures?
For you, they're just two dusty old men.
-Just flesh.
-They're covered with dust... from their long road to appear in this painting.
-What happened?
-They are good and wise.
How can you know their character... if you have not read the Gospels?
How can you know all that?
Sir, why are you frightening him?
He was already afraid.
He's not afraid.
These people are never afraid.
Leave him alone.
Better to appreciate the scent of the paintings.
-It smells good.
-Very good.
You need not fear.
So strange to hear those words.
Now I understand. We're in the gallery.
Yes...
I understand.
We're in the Tsar's gallery... near the portrait of a medieval fanatic.
Where have we wandered to?
That music was good, after all.
Who was the composer?
-Glinka.
-Who is he? A German?
A Russian.
No, he's German.
All composers are German.
All composers are German?
EI Greco.
Very nice.
Looks like a Rembrandt.
EI Greco.... Dust from the roads.
What dust from the roads?
Nice, very nice.
-Something you don't like?
-Not at all.
-It's nice, very nice.
-Nice....
More flesh.... Very nice.
These are nice paintings.
Nice paintings....
They're getting better and better.
There's an angel.
Pardon me for addressing you without an introduction.
To whom was that directed?
Do tell.
-I'm speaking to the painting.
-You are speaking to the painting?
How interesting!
-I must speak my mind.
-Speak your mind?
And so you talk to the painting.
Would you like to try?
Must I try? Very well.
-Like that.
-Like this?
Now, like this.
Now a turn.
Sometimes I prefer speaking to myself.
This painting and I... we have a secret.
Really?
-Yes.
-Now it's over.
That's all, gentlemen. Good-bye!
Where are you going, madam?
She's offended. She has left.
Hi!
Good-bye!
Farewell, gentleman!
How charming!
She's offended. But so charming!
Where has she gone?
Marble... a white stone... very white.
Rather cold, isn't it?
When you first came here, it must have been disastrous.
That was just after the fire.
I have been here before, but it's as if I have not.
What luxury!
What is that?
It's under the Convention that everything was devastated.
You don't know
20th-century Russian history.
Our Convention lasted 80 years.
A real revolution.... Very sad.
What kind of system is there now?
A republic?
I don't know.
I have never believed that a republic was suitable... for a country as large as Russia.
You Europeans are democrats who mourn the monarchy.
-You are French, is that it?
-Who are you?
Excuse us, we're lost.
-Please be on your way.
-Let us live! Let us live!
-Remaining here is forbidden!
-Help us, please.
Who forbids it? What is forbidden?
What language! Everything is forbidden!
It's better not to argue.
We're going, we're going.
I know where we can hide.
I suddenly feel afraid.
I don't like military uniforms.
-Not that door, sir!
-But I like it.
-Such a beautiful door!
-No, not that one!
Why is it so cold?
I told you not to enter.
What cold! Frames.... But where are....
Where are the canvases?
Let's go back, I beg you.
-Who's there?
-It's me.
-Why have you come here?
-I don't know. I simply entered.
-Come closer.
-I'm coming.
Maybe you need help, kind sir.
Who is the "kind sir"?
Me.... You....
Not here, not there.
There is no one.
Only coffins and corpses. Come and see.
-I'm coming.
-That's my coffin.
-Your coffin?
-Yes, I made it myself.
Why that strange tone, kind sir?
Why coffins in the Hermitage?
"Kind sir"!
-It's my coffin.
-Yes, it is yours.
-He looks well-fed!
-But where are the corpses?
Why do you ask "where"?
Don't step on the corpses.
He looks well-fed!
You stepped on the corpses!
-What happened?
-The war.
Which war? Against whom?
-Against Germany.
-What is Germany?
The unified state of the Germans.
In the 20th century,
Russia was at war with Germany.
The Germans surrounded the city.
But the city did not surrender.
More than 1 million dead.
-More than 1 million?
-Yes.
That's a high price to pay. Very high.
Saint Petersburg and the Hermitage paid dearly.
In Russia, it is said that freedom knows no price.
A very high price.
But maybe not.
But it has already been paid.
I was wrong, by the way... when I criticised your tsars... for all this beauty and opulence.
Even if they all were... tyrants.
Quieter, please.
But it is beautiful, isn't it?
What do you see? Who is it?
Maybe Catherine II, but I'm not certain.
Nothing could be less certain.
That's enough! Lisa, take away the children.
Don't go too near to her.
If it is Catherine, she has a sixth sense....
Like this.
Lower, lower!
That will be all.
The candles, the candles.
It's stuffy in here.
-There.
-No, I won't let you.
That's it.
But it's cold outside.
That's it.
Sir!
Where are you?
I hear your footsteps. Where are you?
Mortals must not chase royalty.
You won't catch up anyway.
I hear your footsteps.
I hear them.
Sir, what are you doing? It's cold!
-Come this way.
-Yes, it's cold.
-She disappeared.
-I know.
-She disappeared again.
-Move aside.
-Do you know where to go?
-Help us. Come.
Let us through. We are allowed.
Where is the door? Where is it?
Greetings!
Don't be shy. Come. We will not stay long.
Thank you very much.
A new hairstyle is necessary.
What beautiful hair you have! Those curls!
Tea! Would you like tea?
I don't either, but they insist.
Where is the tea?
We're in a hurry. Where is it?
-I know I'm beautiful.
-Too beautiful.
What do you want me to say?
-Come on!
-I have nothing to say!
What is that?
-Did you write this book?
-Not me. He did.
Neither he nor I. But he will dedicate it.
Follow me.
Sir, what are you looking at?
Shall we continue?
What do I see? Nothing for the moment.
Some people are obviously waiting for something.
Let's proceed with caution.
These madmen could eat you.
They liked your hair.
Of course, good writers always have beautiful hair.
-Be more careful and quiet now.
-I'm following you.
-Close the door quickly.
-It's done.
When I was last received here at the Winter Palace... it was being renovated after the terrible fire.
-The parquet doesn't creak.
-It doesn't creak....
-The ambassador of Persia!
-Excuse us for being late.
Sir, let's go.
The ambassador of His Highness the Shah...
Prince Khozrev-Mirza... the son of the future Shah, with his entourage.
-Do you know what is happening?
-Not yet.
We are witnesses.
Nicholas I received an apology from the Persian emissaries... regarding the murder of Russian diplomats.
Griboedov was one, I think.
How interesting.
Are you able to see?
What uniforms!
Luxury, empire...
power....
Look over there. Higher.
Can you see?
Yes, I see now!
One must not trust this world. You are right.
Beware, court officials are cunning.
Some of them are mediums.
They could sense your presence.
Thank you for your advice.
We Gemini are curious by nature.
I'll move ahead.
Maybe I'll meet old acquaintances.
Good luck. I'll find you later.
Mighty Sovereign Emperor!
The peaceful nature of Persia and the sacred union that exists... among His Majesty and the Shah were both upset by evil.
Under its power, a frenzied Tehran crowd... committed unheard-of acts of evil.
The resulting victim was the Russian mission.
The honest heart of Fetkh-Ali-Shah... was horrified by the idea that a handful of wrongdoers... might destroy our peace and union.
His Majesty the Shah has sent me, his grandson... to request that you, Sovereign... erase from memory this event.
Let the world know that, despite this terrible event... two wise monarchs, with their infinite wisdom... speak openly and vanquish all suspicion.
With the greatest joy, I stand before you...
Your Imperial Majesty.
I carry out my grandfather's will... that we strengthen peace... between our two peoples.
His Imperial Majesty... commands me to assure Your Excellence... of his pleasure at hearing your explanation... as well as the righteous plea... of your sovereign.
I've been observing you. Who let you enter?
-You have no business here.
-That's correct.
Then you must leave at once.
Off you go, sir! Away!
-I had no intention of staying.
-Away!
This ceremony will continue for a few more hours still.
As a former diplomat, I'm aware of that.
A terrible boredom will set in. Terrible!
Leave me alone!
-And what is that?
-What did you say?
I adore luxury and regal splendour.
Stasov wasn't a bad architect.
He loved discipline, but left space for breathing.
We cannot stay here.
The ceremony will finish.
Then they will all come in.
My God!
Sevres porcelain, my weakness!
-Beautiful.
-Yes, yes!
-Inimitable!
-Beautiful.
This is the cameo service?
Yes, it is.
Not so close, please.
What gold!
Sir, it's awkward setting the table with you here.
You can admire it later when you are seated.
Please do go away.
What pure tones!
The blue and gold are enchanting.
And the wine-sediment colour!
AIways such marvellous cooks here in the Winter Palace.
Do you recall the taste of food?
No, I have forgotten.
You've forgotten....
Visit the other salons while waiting for the dinner bell.
-That blue!
-Please, sir.
There's dancing. Come on.
Let's leave here.
-We're being chased away.
-Chased away....
It's so dark here.
Heavens!
I see you have never seen a tsar... nor grand princes in all their magnificence.
-Monarchy is not eternal.
-As if I didn't know....
Don't I have the right to dream a little?
We are free, you and I. Dream away.
There's someone here. Do you hear voices?
Sir, don't you hear them?
No, I don't hear anything.
Look, someone is moving there.
Where?
Mr. Orbeli, I don't understand.
What has upset you so?
You and my father know:
No insect can harm this throne.
-It's made of silver and treated oak.
-It's not the throne.
I'm very worried.
See that velour from Lyons.
It's completely worn out.
-We'll restore it. Be patient.
-You don't have the time.
You're right, Boris.
We don't have time either.
You won't ever see him again.
Speak!
He's your son.
What difficulty are they having?
They seem uncomfortable with each other.
What do you expect?
You descend from the heavens... and no longer know how to behave.
Your son is Hermitage director.
Like you and I before him.
The wars ahead.... Terrible wars.
But we managed to preserve all this through the catastrophes.
I can't hear anymore.
And you?
Yes, I hear. But not very clearly.
What are they saying?
The elder Piotrovsky is asking...
whether the director's telephone is still under surveillance.
His son tells him, "Forget that."
"I would prefer telling you about the Hermitage cats."
"They are still here...."
There are so many people that I wasn't able to help.
Ten years have passed.
You know what I'm referring to.
But everyone speaks well of you.
Your books are still in print.
Those of Mr. Orbeli, too.
That's particularly admirable.
The dead weep with joy when their books are reprinted.
Especially 37 years later, Mikhail.
Is something still troubling you?
Is it the authorities?
They want acorns from oak trees.
They are not interested in knowing how to nurture the tree of culture.
But it will be their doom if the tree falls.
Then there will be nothing left.
Can't they understand that?
Mr. Orbeli, what awaits us?
-I'm coming!
-Speak!
-Listen, Mikhail....
-Let him go.
You're completely alone.
They won't tell him anything.
I know, ask me!
I am asking you....
Everyone can see the future... but no one remembers the past.
Look how handsome they are!
Such fine young men!
Beautiful uniforms, even if I don't like the military.
You didn't answer my question.
Nothing, you know nothing.
Sir! Wait!
He doesn't hear me.
I must apologise.
They said other things.
I could hardly hear them.
I made it all up, about Orbeli....
About Piotrovsky, too.
-Only God can judge you.
-I made it all up.
We are free, you and I. You said it yourself!
Please, don't run.
Run! I can't keep up with you.
Little birds.
Children!
Anastasia, where are you going?
They are... so light!
You're always watching me.
I have a bad feeling.
Don't be alarmed.
Pray. And I shall pray for you.
Did you hear that?
-Did you hear shots?
-Calm down. God is with you.
I think someone is following us.
Calm down, Alexandra.
If only Alexis could run....
Doctors are good for nothing.
There is no hope.
It's my fault.
Children!
Children, behave yourselves!
Sorry, excuse us.
Come here, Anastasia. Where were you?
I looked for you all morning.
We were playing.
Let's go.
Where is Alexis?
-Thank you, I can manage.
-Of course.
-Are you in pain?
-I'm fine, Mother.
Move your chair forward.
You are late for tea.
Forgive me.
What do you think? Shall we forgive her?
Anastasia won't do it again.
It looks like it's not your fault.
Good-bye.
Fly away, my little angels!
And here's their cage.
They're all here, of course.
There haven't been so many guests for a long time.
Good evening.
Look at that strange fellow.
But...
where has my European gone?
Where is he?
There he is!
He doesn't see me.
I should go up to him.
Otherwise he will be offended.
Sir! He can't hear me.
But I'll see him later.
Wouldn't it be nice to jump about like that?
You know...
Aristarkh Konstantinovich is being sent to Africa.
What a tiger! He could eat anyone!
Your mother has trained the servants well.
Don't be shy! You are doing very well.
The most important for the mazurka is....
You are doing great.
Thank you.
Saint Petersburg has the best balls in Europe.
Everyone is so easygoing.
Like one big family.
There must be over 3,000 people.
Maybe less.
I've forgotten everything!
I dance so poorly! I've forgotten everything!
But it's all coming back to me!
Good, very good!
Bravo! More! More!
Where were you? I lost you.
I'm here.
I lost you.
Lost....
I'm sad.
Let's go.
To where?
Where? Forward.
Forward....
What will we find over there?
Over there? I don't know.
I'm staying.
Farewell, Europe.
It's over.
You might say I grew up here.
But I'm not quite myself.
It's as if I were in someone else's house.
Listen up! Look here!
Poor man, your lady has gone away!
-Flown away like a bird!
-Gone....
In a flash!
Shall we dine together?
I'll wait downstairs. Bring up the coach.
Have our coats brought up.
And don't lose them!
When we return to Kursk, we must organise a ball.
Just before Lent, for example.
I think we should invite your nephew as well as Varenka. Let him see.
Nathalie!
It feels like we're floating.
It seems all this is but a dream.
But you have found her!
Nothing has happened!
Custine!
Let me pass!
Sir, sir....
It's a pity you're not here with me.
You would understand everything.
Look.
The sea is all around.
We are destined to sail forever.
To live forever.
MAN:
They say Japan was made by a sword.
They say the old gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean... and when they pulled it out, four perfect drops fell back into the sea...
and those drops became the islands of Japan.
I say Japan was made by a handful of brave men...
warriors willing to give their lives...
for what seems to have become a forgotten word:
Honor.
[GROWLING]
[GROWLS]
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen:
Winchester.
America's leader in all forms of armament used... by the United States Army... celebrates our nation's centennial by bringing you a true American hero.
One of the most decorated warriors this country has ever known.
Winner of the Medal of Honor for his gallantry... on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg.
San Francisco, 1876
He is late of the 7th Cavalry... and their triumphant campaign against the most savage of the Indian nations.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you:
Captain Nathan Algren!
Captain Nathan Algren!
Yes!
Ladies and gent...
One moment, ladies and gentlemen.
Goddamn you, Algren, get out there!
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!
Come on! I'm sick of this!
Come on!
Yes!
[APPLAUSE]
[COUGHS]
My thanks, Mr. McCabe, you are too kind.
This, ladies and gents... is the gun that's winning the West.
Why, many's the time
I've found myself...
[TOM-TOM PLAYING]
Surrounded by a swarm of... angry hostiles, with nothing but this rifle...
[BUGLE PLAYING]
Between me and a certain and gruesome death.
And let me tell you, folks, the red man... is a fearsome enemy.
And if he'd had his way... why, this scalp of mine would be long gone... and there'd be a balder man standing before you today.
Like those poor bastards out there... on the Little Bighorn.
Bodies stripped bare... mutilated.
Left to rot in the sun.
This, ladies and gentlemen, the 73 lever-action...
Trapper.
It's got a seven-shot capacity. Accurate
400 yards, one round per second.
Son, have you ever seen what this could do to a man?
Blow a hole in your daddy six inches wide.
WOMAN: Oh. That's terrible.
- That's right, missy.
This beauty.
You could kill yourself five, six, seven braves without ever having to reload.
Note the patented loading port and the smooth cocking action.
[COCKS RIFLE]
[CROWD GASPS]
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
My thanks on behalf of those who died... in the name of better mechanical amusements and... commercial opportunities.
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.
God bless you all.
I must say, captain, you have a flair for the old melodrama.
- You're alive.
- I am, indeed.
Your man Custer says to me,
"We're going to the Little Bighorn."
Says I, "What's this 'we' stuff?"
It's the walking ticket for me.
Nine lives I have.
But I'll tell you what else I have.
I have a good job for the both of us.
God knows it looks as if you'll need one real soon.
What kind of a job?
The only job you're fit for, boyo.
A man's job.
Unless, of course, you got your heart set on a career in the theater.
Nathan!
Just listen to what your man has to say.
Been a while.
It's good to see you.
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan... and his associate, whose name
I've given up trying to pronounce.
Sit down, please.
ALGREN:
Whiskey.
Now, Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized country.
And Mr. Omura here is willing to spend what it takes... to hire white experts to train their army.
And if we play our cards right... the Emperor grants the U.S. exclusive rights to supply arms.
Well, I have an agreement with Winchester Company.
I'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept of what an agreement is.
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.
We will pay you $400 a month.
Five. For each.
And another 500 when we get the job done.
How many other genuine heroes you got lined up?
[MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE]
He's rude.
That's how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.
[IN ENGLISH]
Whiskey.
So who will we be training your boys to fight?
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.
- He's Samurai.
- Samurai?
The word you might use is "warrior."
Mr. Omura is familiar with our experiences dealing with renegades.
Is he?
He's even read your book.
Captain Algren's study of the tribes... was a crucial factor in our defeat of the Cheyenne.
Please excuse. What is funny?
The corps back together again.
It's just so... inspiring!
Excuse me.
I need to use the necessities.
[ALGREN couel-ls]
This isn't a problem.
I'll just talk to him for a minute.
Colonel Bagley.
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer... and you assured us of his participation.
He'll do it.
I just need a minute.
Nathan.
I did what I was ordered to do out there.
And I have no remorse.
So, what do you say we put the past behind us?
You want me to kill Jappos,
I'll kill Jappos.
- I'm not asking you to kill anybody.
- You want me to kill their enemies...
I'll kill their enemies.
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne...
For 500 bucks a month,
I'll kill whoever you want.
But keep one thing in mind...
I'd happily kill you for free.
ALGREN:
July 12th, 1876.
There is some comfort in the emptiness of the sea.
No past, no future.
And then at once, I am confronted by the hard truth of present circumstances.
I have been hired to help suppress the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.
Apparently, this is the only job for which I am suited.
I am beset by the ironies of my life.
[CHILDREN SCREAMING]
Yokohama Harbor, 1876
[CHATTERING]
- Uh, Captain Algren, I presume?
- Yes.
Jolly good. How do you do?
Simon Graham.
Twenty years ago, this was a sleepy little town.
Now look at it.
You see, the Emperor is mad for all things Western... and the Samurai believe it's changing too fast.
The ancient and the modern are at war for the soul of Japan.
So your new employer, Mr. Omura, is bringing in... every Western expert he can get.
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland... and now, of course, warriors from America.
I came over with the British trade mission, oh, years ago.
I was soon relieved of my position.
I had an unfortunate tendency to tell the truth... in a country where no one ever says what they mean.
So now, I very accurately translate other people's lies.
For 2000 years, no emperor was even seen by a commoner.
You have to realize what an honor this is. It's all highly ritualized, of course.
You may look at him, but do not speak unless spoken to.
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.
Do I look presentable?
I haven't worn this in a decade.
Rather snug around the midriff.
And bow.
The divine Emperor Meiji bids you welcome.
He is grateful for the assistance your country offers.
We hope to accomplish the same national harmony... you enjoy in your homeland.
[EMPEROR SPEAKING JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH] The Emperor is most interested in your American Indians... if you have fought against them in battle.
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.
[EMPEROR SPEAKING JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH] The Emperor wishes to ask Captain Algren... if it is true they wear eagle feathers... and paint their faces before going into battle... and that they have no fear.
They are very brave.
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH]
Bow.
Thank you very much.
GRAHAM:
And step back.
Step back, step back and turn.
Right, you little bastards!
You will stand up straight or I will personally shit-kick... every Far Eastern buttock that appears before my eyes!
[MEN CHATTERING]
Well done, sergeant.
When you understand the language, everything falls into place.
The first rank will kneel, rifles at the ready.
[SPEAKS JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH]
The second rank...
ALGREN:
July 22nd, 1876.
For six months' work, I am to receive three years of captain's pay...
teaching Orientals to soldier.
They are an army of conscripts.
Most of them are peasants who have never even seen a gun.
Fire!
They are led by General Hasegawa a man of small stature...
who nonetheless commands enormous respect.
What can the general tell me about this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
ALGREN: He seems to have great knowledge of Katsumoto
and his rebellion. I will count on his help when facing the Samurai.
Who supplies their weapons?
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH]
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself... by using firearms, you see.
He uses no firearms?
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.
How well does he know him?
The general and Katsumoto fought together for the Emperor.
He fought with the Samurai?
He is Samurai.
GRAHAM: You must understand.
Katsumoto pledged his sword... to defend the Emperor.
They say that a Samurai's sword is his soul.
They're paradoxical people, Samurai.
I've tried to write about them, but they keep to themselves.
The bastards are still wearing armor.
When the Irish were comporting themselves in loincloths... these chaps were the most sophisticated warriors on Earth.
I need information on their battle tactics.
I have several more books just waiting to be translated.
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.
You should hear him blather on in Blackfoot.
Really?
A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.
Just "hello" or "goodbye" or...
No, no, no!
"Cut his tongue out and boil him in oil."
Early day tomorrow, captain, darling.
- It's about bedtime, isn't it?
- I always had a fascination with scalping.
I never quite understood its technique.
Imagine someone who hates you with the utmost intensity... grabbing a handful of your hair while you're lying prostrate and helpless...
Ooh.
And scraping a dull blade of a rusty knife around your scalp... with a saw-like motion.
And let your imagination grasp, if you can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk... on the turf of your hair to release any clinging particles... would have on your nervous system.
[GUNSHOT]
And you'll have some idea of how it feels to be scalped...
Mr. Graham.
Mm.
[GUNSHOT]
How soon can you translate those books?
Right away.
I'm just delighted you're taking such an interest in Samurai.
I don't give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.
GRAHAM:
I shall not sleep until it is done.
Ah.
Sake.
I bid you good night.
GANT:
Can I get you anything, sir?
BAGLEY:
This is a punitive expedition, captain.
Col. Bagley, these people had nothing to do with the raids!

Katsumoto's attacked a rail road at the border of his province.
We cannot govern a country in which we cannot travel freely.
He must be stopped now.
My rail road is a priority for this country.
They're not ready.
The rebels don't have any rifles.
They're savages with bows and arrows.
Whose sole occupation for the last thousand years has been war.
You have superior firepower and a larger force.
I am ordering the regiment to move against Katsumoto.
You will track him down and engage him.
Load.
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!
- I beg your pardon?
- Tell this man... if he does not shoot me,
I will kill him!
- Captain, if I might have a word.

It's astonishing.
And Omura owns all of it?
As soon as he can get rid of the Samurai, he will, yes.
How do you intend to find Katsumoto?
ALGREN: Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you, he'll find us.
ALGREN:
Move into position!
Yoshino Province, 1876

Pay attention, it will save your life!

Fill in on command!
- Where's Hasegawa?
- He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.
ALGREN: Cover down!
- Captain Algren.
We are not here as combatants.
- Then who's gonna lead them?
- Their own officers.
- Let's move to the rear.
- We'll be there presently.
- Fix bayonets!

Yes, of course.

Then you will obey it. Now!
No disrespect intended, sir, but shove it up your ass.

My name is Katsumoto.

Are my words not correct?
I will practice my English with you... if you would honor me.
You kept me alive just to speak English?
Then what do you want?
To know my enemy.
I've seen what you do to your enemies.
Warriors in your country do not kill?
They don't out the heads off defeated, kneeling men.
General Hasegawa asked me to help him end his life.
A Samurai cannot stand the shame of defeat.
I was honored to cut off his head.
Many of our customs seem strange to you. The same is true of yours.
For example... not to introduce yourself is considered extremely rude, even among enemies.
Nathan Algren.
I am honored to meet you.
- I enjoyed this conversation in English.
- I have questions.
I have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.
This is a very good conversation.

You fought against your Red Indians?

Tell me of your part in this war.
- Why?
- I wish to learn.
- Read a book.
- I would rather have a good conversation.
- Why?
- Because“.
We are both students of war.
Huh?
So... you were the general of your army?
No.
I was a captain.
This is a low rank?
- A middle rank.
- Uh-huh.
And who was your general?
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?
People in your country do not like conversation?
He was a lieutenant colonel.
His name was Custer.
I know this name.
He killed many warriors.
Oh, yes. Many warriors.
So he was a good general.
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.
He got massacred because he took a battalion against 2000 angry Indians.
Two thousand Indians?
How many men for Custer?
Two hundred and eleven.
I like this General Custer.
He was a murderer who fell in love with his own legend.
And his troopers died for it.
I think this is a very good death.
Maybe you can have one like it someday.
If it is in my destiny.
- What do you want from me?
- What do you want for yourself?
What are you doing?
Why are we having these conversations?
What the hell am I doing here?
In spring-~ the snows will melt and the passes will open.
Until that time, you are here.
Good day, captain.

Day unknown. Month unknown.
I continue to live among these unusual people.
I am their captive, in that I cannot escape.
Mostly, I'm treated with a kind of a mild neglect...
as if I were a stray dog or an unwelcome guest.
[MEN YELLING, GRUNTING]
Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows.
But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.
[TAKA SPEAKS JAPANESE]

They are an intriguing people.
From the moment they wake...
they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue.
I have never seen such discipline.

and that Katsumoto believes his rebellion to be...
in the service of the Emperor.

Is this not so?
- Yes.
- I, also.
It happens to men who have seen what we have seen.
And then I come to this place of my ancestors... and I remember.
Like these blossoms... we are all dying.
To know life in every breath... every cup of tea... every life we take.
The way of the warrior.
Life in every breath.
That is Bushido.
Hai.
[IN ENGLISH] The Emperor has granted a safe passage to Tokyo.
We leave tomorrow.
Good.
Good.
When I took these, you were... my enemy.
[IN JAPANESE]
Excuse me.
No, so sorry, I am finishing.
I must go away.
Hai.
You have been kind to me.
I won't forget...
Algren-san! Algren-san.

BAGLEY:
Algren?
Algren, my God, you are alive.
Well, you never cease to astonish.
- Howitzers.
- Yes, indeed.
As soon as the Emperor signs the trade agreement... he gets the whole package.
Including this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.
And the new cartridges cut down on jamming.
I need a bath.
After living with those savages,
I can only imagine.
Welcome back, captain.
[IN JAPANESE] Katsumoto.
You rise against me, my teacher.
No, Highness.
I rise against your enemies.
They are my advisors, like you.
They advise in their own interest.
I need advisors who know the modern world.
If I am no use,
I will happily end my life.
No.
I need your voice in the council.
It is your voice we need, Highness.
You are a living god.
Do what you think is right.
I am a living god... as long as I do what they think is right.
What sad words you speak.
Forgive me for saying what a teacher must.
Have you forgotten your people?
Tell me what to do... my teacher.
[SPEAKS JAPANESE]
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.
You must find the wisdom for all of us.
[IN ENGLISH]
Ah, gentlemen, come in.
Captain Algren, it seems you have endured your captivity... with little ill effect.
I was not ill-treated, sir.
Mr. Omura, I have here a draft of the arms agreement.
I'm eager to know how many Samurai have joined Katsumoto.
I'm afraid I don't know.
- You spent the winter at his encampment.
- As his prisoner.
Has he fortified his position?
Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.
As you said, colonel, they're savages with bows and arrows.
- Sir, about the...
- I'm sure your documents are in order.
Thank you. Leave them on my desk.
I'll address them at the appropriate time.
With all due respect, sir, our president's patience is wearing thin.
Perhaps there is someone else we should speak to.
With all due respect, ambassador... perhaps there is someone else we should speak to.
For instance, the French or the English.
Or any of the legations waiting in the next room.
Yes, well...
We should be looking forward to hearing from you.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.
Perhaps you and I might have a word in private. Please, sit down.
- May I offer you whiskey?
- No, thank you.
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man, is he not?
He's a tribal leader.
I've known many of them.
But none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.
- I don't see how this concerns me.
- Ah, but it does.
You see, you were right. Last year, we were not prepared to go to battle.
You were right, and Colonel Bagley was wrong.
But now, we are ready.
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract other Samurai to his cause... we will have 10 years of rebellion.
This is something I will not allow.
Either I'll stop him at the council today, or you'll lead my army against him.
And with these new weapons, you will crush him.
- I appreciate the offer.
- It is not an offer.
Mr. Omura, my contract with you was to train your army.
Then we will make a new contract... one that will recognize the extraordinary contribution... you've made to the Emperor.
Do we understand each other?
- Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
- Then I am pleased.
[IN JAPANESE] Follow him. If he goes anywhere near Katsumoto, kill him.
[IN ENGLISH] Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?
The diplomatic community is abuzz.
Omura has passed laws against the Samurai.
I need a drink.
Is your friend Katsumoto planning to go up against the council this afternoon?
[IN JAPANESE] You, Samurai!
Don't you know about the order?
[IN ENGLISH]
It's started.
[IN JAPANESE]
Hey boy, are you listening?
No wonder the foreigners mock you.
Let's give this Samurai a haircut.
Cut off his top knot.
Get down! Kneel!

[SPEAKS JAPANESE]
I'll take you home.
[IN ENGLISH]
Jolly good.
[IN JAPANESE]
We must resist the Western powers... by becoming powerful ourselves.
Our army, our economy, must be strong.
Minister, you honor us.
It is my honor to rejoin this council.
Perhaps you are unaware of the law against wearing swords?
I read every law carefully.
Yet you bring weapons into this chamber?
This chamber was protected by my sword when...
We need no protection.
We are a nation of laws.
We are a nation of whores, selling ourselves.
If we are whores, the Samurai made us this way.
I have not seen the Omura family giving gold to the masses.
Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret... but I must ask you to remove your sword.
This sword serves the Emperor.
Only he can command me to remove it.
The Emperor's voice is too pure to be heard in this council.
Then, I must refuse to give up my sword.
Then regretfully, my guards will accompany you to your home in Tokyo.
There you will await our summons.
[KNOCKING]
[IN ENGLISH]
I heard you were leaving.
Omura offers you my job, and you run away.
I suppose I should thank you.
$500 a month, including back pay for time spent... in captivity.
Enough to climb back inside a bottle for the rest of your life.
You're welcome.
Well, it is pretty much over.
Katsumoto's under arrest.
Omura won't let him last the night.
With him dead, we should have little trouble handling the rebellion... even without you.
Especially without you.
Just tell me one thing.
What is it about your own people that you hate so much?
[IN JAPANESE]
Save us the trouble...

MAN:

Stop! Somebody!
Bring that equipment here now!
Immediately!
You stop!
You insolent, useless son of a peasant dog!
How dare you show your sword in his presence! Do you know who this is?
This is the President of the United States of America!
He is here to lead our armies in victorious battle against the rebels!
It's not my responsibility...
Now get over there and help those men with their equipment!
Carry the equipment.

President of the United States?
Sorry.

The Emperor could not hear my words.
His army will come.
It is the end.
For 900 years, my ancestors have protected our people.
Now...
I have failed them.
So you will take your own life... in shame?
Shame for a life of service?
Discipline? Compassion?
The way of the Samurai is not necessary anymore.
Necessary?
What could be more necessary?
I will die by the sword.
My own... or my enemy's.
Then let it be your enemy's.
Together, we will make the Emperor hear you.
[IN JAPANESE]
He was a good man.
Will you fight the white men, too?
If they come here, yes.
Why?
Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.
The way of Samurai is difficult for children.
He misses his father.
And he is angry... because I am the cause of that.
No. He is angry because he fears you will die as well.
My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.
That is what he believed.
I would be afraid to die in battle.
So would I.
But you have been in many battles.
And I was always afraid.
I don't want you to go.
Algren.
They are coming.
[ALGREN IN ENGLISH]
I'd say two full regiments.
They'll come in waves of a thousand.
And they have the howitzers.
It makes no difference. They will come, and we will make our stand.
- How many men will we have?
- Maybe 500.
Like General Custer, huh?
There was once a battle at a place called Thermopylae.
Three hundred brave Greeks held off a Persian army of a million men.
A million. You understand this number?
I understand this number.
For two days the Greeks made them pay so dearly... the Persian army lost all taste for battle and were defeated soon after.
- What do you have in mind?
- Take away the advantage of their guns.
They're overconfident. We'll use that.
Lure them close.
Close enough for a sword.
You believe... a man can change his destiny?
I think a man does what he can... until his destiny is revealed to him.
ALGREN:
May 25th, 1877
This will be the last entry in this journal.
I've tried to give a true accounting of what I have seen, what I have done.
I do not presume to understand the course of my life.
I know I am grateful to have partaken of all this...
even if for a moment.
[IN JAPANESE]
Algren-san, will you come with me?
If you wear this armor, it will honor us.

What does it say?
"I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways have joined the new."

Good God.
Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan demands your surrender.
If you lay down your arms, you will not be harmed.
This is not possible, as Mr. Omura knows.

We will show you no quarter.
You ride against us, and you are the same as them.
I'll look for you on the field.

Yes, I will. Captain.

He is here?
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[IN JAPANESE] Highness, if we could just conclude the matter at hand...

This is Katsumoto's sword.
He would have wanted you to have it... that the strength of the Samurai be with you always.
[IN JAPANESE] Enlightened One, we all weep for Katsumoto, but...
[IN ENGLISH]
He hoped... with his last breath... that you would remember the ancestors who held this sword... and what they died for.
[IN JAPANESE]
Your Highness...
[IN ENGLISH]
You were with him... at the end?
Hai.
[IN ENGLISH]
Emperor, this man fought against you!
Your Highness... if you believe me to be your enemy, command me... and I will gladly take my life.
I have dreamed of a unified Japan... of a country strong and independent and modern.
And now we have rail roads and cannon, Western clothing.
But... we cannot forget who we are... or where we come from.
Ambassador Swanbeck...
I have concluded that your treaty... is not in the best interest of my people.
- Sir, if I may...
- So sorry... but you may not.
This is an outrage!
[IN JAPANESE]
Enlightened One...
- we should discuss this...
- Omura... you have done quite enough.
Everything I have done,
I have done for my country.
Then you will not mind when I seize your family's assets... and present them as my gift to the people.
You disgrace me.
If your shame is too unbearable...
I offer you this sword.

Tell me how he died.
I will tell you how he lived.
GRAHAM: And so the days of the Samurai had ended.
Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny.
As for the American captain...
no one knows what became of him.
Some say that he died of his wounds...
others, that he returned to his own country.
But I like to think
he may have at last found some small measure of peace...
that we all seek...
and few of us ever find.
[ENGLISH SDH]
I have long feared...
... that my sins would return to visit me.
And the cost is more than I can bear.

Wait for Father.
Sorry.
That's her. The North Star.
See?
You start from the front two stars of the Big Dipper.
And then you count up.
You count up five finger lengths...
...and it's right there.
And she'll always be looking down on us.
And protect us. Forever.
Come. Into bed.
Good night. Good night, Meg.
It helps her to know Mother's there.
Good night.
So what was in the mail?
"The New York and
Pennsylvania assemblies...
...are debating independence."
What about the middle colonies?
"In Chestertown, they burned the customs house...
...and tar and feathered two magistrates.
They died of... They died of burns."
Damn fools.
Who? The writers or the magistrates?
What does it say about the Continental Congress?
It says here they'll make a declaration of independence by July.
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.
He's 17, a year younger than I.
Well, the assembly's been convened, so I've been called to Charles Town.
- We're going to Charles Town?
- We are.
We leave in the morning.
Charlotte.
The children are here.
Thank you.
Aunt Charlotte!
Margaret, William, look at you.
Missed you.
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?
Well, they're from good stock.
On their mother's side, of course.
Thank you. Come inside.
Wait until you see what I have.
- Presents? Presents for us?
- Move slowly.
Keep an eye on these heathens, will you?
Sorry.
I have this for you, Susan.
It belonged to your mother.
She's still not talking?
No.
It does me good to see you.
Look, there's Gabriel.
Gabriel.
Hang King George!
Harry Burwell is here recruiting.
The governor has vowed if the assembly votes a single shilling...
...to the Continental Army, he'll dissolve the body.
Wouldn't that force our delegates in
Philadelphia to vote for independence?
Yes.
Send us off to war alongside
Massachusetts.
Get King George!
- Hang them all!
- Hang the lot of them!
That's enough.
Very well, children, inside.
Come along now. Inside now.
Burwell will be counting on your vote.
And he'll expect you to be the first to enlist.
Yes, I imagine so.
I'm sorry, the heathens are...
They have long needed a woman in their lives.
A mother.
Especially Susan.
My name is Peter Howard.
I lost most of my hearing and my left leg...
...fighting for the Crown in the French and Indian War.
And how did King George reward me?
He cuts off my other leg with his taxes.
Miss Howard, isn't it?
You know who I am, Gabriel Martin.
The last time you saw me,
I was 11 and you put ink in my tea.
I believe that was one of my younger brothers. Perhaps Samuel or Nathan.
It was you, and it turned my teeth black for a month.
- and send a message to King George he will never forget!
Our first order of business...
And our last, if we vote a levy!
Order, order!
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.
First, an address by Colonel
Harry Burwell of the Continental Army.
Colonel Burwell.
You all know why I'm here.
I'm not an orator.
And I would not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause.
I'm a soldier.
And we are at war.
From Philadelphia, we expect a declaration of independence.
8 of the 13 colonies have levied money...
...in support of a continental army.
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.
Massachusetts and Virginia may be at war...
...but South Carolina is not!
Hear, hear.
This is not a war for the independence of one or two colonies...
...but for the independence of one nation.
And what nation is that?
An American nation!
There is no such nation and to speak of one is treason.
We are citizens of an American nation.
And our rights are being threatened...
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.
Would you tell me, please,
Mr. Howard...
...why should I trade one tyrant
3000 miles away...
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?
An elected legislature can trample a man's rights as easily as a king can.
Captain Martin...
...I understood you to be a patriot.
If you mean by "patriot," am I angry about taxation without representation?
Well, yes, I am.
Should the American colonies govern themselves independently?
I believe they can. And they should.
But if you're asking me am I willing to go to war with England...
...then the answer is most definitely no.
This from the same Captain Benjamin
Martin whose fury was so famous...
...during the Wilderness campaign?
I was intemperate in my youth.
Temperance can be a disguise for fear.
Mr. Middleton, I fought with Captain Martin...
...under Washington in the French and Indian War.
There's not a man in this room...
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom
I would more willingly trust my life.
There are alternatives to war.
We take our case before the king.
- We plead with him.
- We tried.
Well, then, we try again and again if necessary to avoid a war.
I was at Bunker Hill.
The British advanced three times.
We killed 700 at point-blank range and still they took the ground.
That is the measure of their resolve.
If your principles dictate independence...
...then war is the only way.
It is come to that.
Hear, hear.
I have seven children.
My wife is dead.
Now, who's to care for them if I go to war?
Wars are not fought only by childless men.
Granted.
But mark my words.
This war will be fought, not on the frontier...
...or on some distant battlefield...
...but amongst us.
Among our homes.
Our children will learn of it with their own eyes.
And the innocent will die with the rest of us.
I will not fight.
And because I will not fight,
I will not cast a vote...
...that will send others to fight in my stead.
And your principles?
I'm a parent. I haven't got the luxury of principles.
We must vote to levy!
28 to 12! The levy passed!
You intend to enlist without my permission?
Yes, I do.
Father, I thought you were a man of principle.
When you have a family of your own, perhaps you'll understand.
When I have a family of my own,
I won't hide behind them.
He's as imprudent as his father was at his age.
Regrettably so.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Make him a clerk or quartermaster, something of that sort.
Good luck.
Dear Thomas:
Though many seasons have passed...
... it seems like only yesterday when we last saw each other in Charles Town.
With sadness, I learned of its recent fall to the British...
... under General Cornwallis.
I received a letter from Aunt Charlotte...
... saying she closed her home in Charles Town after the city fell...
... and moved to her plantation on the Santee.
Here in the north, our campaign has been marked by defeat and privation.
Our losses have been grievous.
My good friend, Peter Cuppin, fell at Elizabethtown.
His death has been difficult to bear.
We will march south with General Gates...
... to fight the Redcoats under Cornwallis.
Thank you, sir.
I envy you...
... your youth and distance from this cruel conflict of which I am a part.
"But I am fortunate to be serving the cause of Liberty.
And though I fear death...
...each day in prayer I reaffirm my willingness...
...to give my life in its service.
Pray for me.
But above all, pray for the cause.
Your loving brother, Gabriel."
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Not yet, Thomas.
When?
Seventeen.
That's two years.
It's already been two.
- The war could be over by then.
- God willing.
All right. Seventeen.
All right.
Put it back, please.
Father?
What happened at Fort Wilderness?
Put it away.
- Throw it faster.
- You throw it faster. You're the one...
Margaret, you go get your brothers back up here right now.
Back to the house. Come on.
Back to the house now.
Come with me. Margaret, go now.
They're going to come.
Quiet. Sit down.
Six-pounders.
Lots of them.
How far away?
They're a long way off. They're most likely heading the other direction.
Put those in the house.
- They might come this way.
- Must I tell you again?
Let's all stay close in to the house, all right?
We'll have to fight them off.
Won't Father do that?
They'll probably kill us men...
...and do Lord-knows-what to you women.
Nathan!
Slowly turn.
Father.
Abigale!
Water and bandages, fast.
The battle. Were you there?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
No, not yet.
Abigale, the children, please.
Children, come. Upstairs.
Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats.
Our lines broke. The British
Green Dragoons cut us to bits.
I was given these dispatches.
As I left, I saw the Virginia Regulars surrender.
The Dragoons rode into them.
Killed them all.
Over 200 men.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsborough.
You can't ride.
I can't stay here!
It's not safe for...

Thank you for the care of His Majesty's soldiers.
Have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Winnsboro.
Yes, sir.
Fire the house and barns.
Let it be known if you harbor the enemy you will lose your home.
By order of King George...
...all slaves of the American colonies who fight for the Crown...
...will be granted their freedom with our victory.
We're not slaves. We work this land.
We're freedmen.
Then you're freedmen who will have the privilege...
...of fighting in the king's army.
Rebel dispatches, sir.
Who carried this?
Who carried this?!
I did, sir.
I was wounded.
These people gave me care.
They have nothing to do with the dispatches.
Take this one to Camden.
He is a spy.
Hang him, put his body on display.
He's a dispatch rider.
Destroy the livestock.
Save the horses for the Dragoons.
Colonel, this is a uniformed dispatch rider carrying a marked case.
He cannot be held as a spy.
Well, we won't hold him.
We're going to hang him.
- Colonel...
- Father!
Oh, I see. He's your son.
Perhaps you should've taught him something of loyalty.
Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.
By the rules of war...
Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war?
Or perhaps your children would.
No lesson is necessary.
Sir.

Behind you!
Look on the rear!
Lord...
...we pray that you accept this child...
...and keep him at your side with his mother.
We ask that you embrace him...
...and help us to understand the manner in which your mercy works.
And forgive us our sins.
This we ask in your name.
Amen.
Sir, we have the private the Cherokee scouts brought in.
Private?
Private.
Colonel William Tavington,
Green Dragoons.
What happened? Who did this?
Him.
It was mad.
I couldn't tell you who it was.
Calm down. Calm down, man.
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers are dead.
And I need to know how.
- He said there was...
- Were you there?
Then let him speak.
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?
Were they militia?
Were they Regulars?
I don't really remember how many.
Maybe one.
One man. Really?
He was in the flank.
All around us.
Amongst us.
I could barely see him.
He was there, then he was gone.
He just vanished.
Sounds more like a ghost than a man.
A ghost.
He was like a ghost.
Enough.
Bordon? Take a patrol.
Capture this ghost before word of his exploits spread.
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.
He was with the Loyalist Colonial
Militia. He might be of use.
Another colonial.
Captain Wilkins, where do your loyalties lie?
To king and country.
Why should I trust a man who'd betray his neighbors?
Those neighbors of mine who stand against England...
...deserve to die a traitor's death.
We'll see.
Mr. Martin!
Miss Charlotte!
You're safe now. Try to sleep.
Good night.
Good night.
Father?
Yes.
I killed those men.
You did what I told you to do.
You did what you had to.
There was no wrong in it.
I'm glad I killed them.
I'm glad.
Get some rest.
Samuel.
You've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
I've done nothing.
And for that, I am ashamed.
We'll go to Saint Helena.
That's a free slave island just north of Charles Town.
Right under the British noses.
- They won't think of look...
- I'm joining up with them.
Gabriel.
No. Your place is here now.
I'm going back.
I'm a soldier, it's my duty.
Your duty is to your family.
Don't you walk away from me, boy!
I'll find you when it's over.
No, I forbid you to go!
- I'm not a child!
- You're my child!
Goodbye, Father.
Gabriel.
Thomas is dead.
How many more have to die before you'll heed my word?
I'm losing my family.
When will you be back, Father?
I don't know.
Tomorrow?
No, not tomorrow.
You say your prayers.
I will.
Take care of your brothers and sisters and your Aunt Charlotte.
I'm depending on you.
As I am on you, Samuel.
All right.
Susan...
...goodbye.
Thank you.
Halt!
Make ready!
Take aim!
Fire!
I'm not going back.
No, I didn't expect you would.
That Gates is a damn fool.
He spent too many years in the British army.
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats in open field. It's madness.
Halt!
Make ready!
Present!
Fire!
This battle was over before it began.
Retreat!
Retreat!
These rustics are so inept.
Nearly takes the honor out of victory.
Nearly.
Hello general, gentlemen.
A glorious day for His Majesty and England.
Colonel Tavington.
Always too early.
Always too eager for glory.
For victory, my lord.
I believe we took the field.
Next time, you'll wait for my command.
It appears that Colonel Tavington prefers to follow his own commands.
General O'Hara tells me...
...you've earned the nickname
"The Butcher" among the populous.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.
Gentlemen, my compliments.
- To a victory.
- Hear, hear.
Hold him firm.
- Where's your commanding officer?
- That tent there.
It's a lost cause.
Benjamin Martin.
I'm in no mood for a lecture.
Where's your General Gates now?
The last anyone saw, riding hard northeast...
...his staff 100 yards behind, trying to catch up.
So who's in command?
I am.
I think.
What are my orders?
We're a breath away from losing this war, Benjamin.
In the north, Washington is reeling from Morristown.
He's running and hiding from 12,000 Redcoats.
In the south, Cornwallis has broken our back.
Captured over 5000 of our troops when he took Charles Town.
And he destroyed the only army between him and New York.
Nothing will stop him from heading north to finish off Washington.
Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the south till the French arrive.
They've promised a fleet and 10,000 troops.
When?
Six months at the earliest.
You trust the French to keep their word?
Absolument.
Benjamin Martin.
Major Jean Villeneuve.
French Seventh Light Foot.
He will help train the militia.
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.
You really expect to hold Cornwallis here using just militia?
Not me. You.
They're not soldiers, they're farmers.
They'd be better off letting the British march through.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't.
How many men does Cornwallis have?
8000 infantry.
Around 600 cavalry.
I'm giving you a field commission as a colonel.
Might I request that you transfer my son under my command?
Sir, no, I...
That's done.
Thank you.
Colonel, I've been a soldier for two years.
As a scout, horseman, marksman, scavenger.
- Is that so?
- I'd be of better use with Regulars.
Where'd you learn all that riding, shooting, scavenging?
My father taught me.
Teach you any humility?
He tried. It didn't take.
He also taught you every trail between here and Charles Town...
...which is why he transferred you.
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of...
We'll cover more ground if we split up.
Very well, corporal. You take
Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.
I'll start on the north side.
Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.
Corporal.
Be careful.
Yes, sir.
You have children?
French.
It skirts the mountain and then...
...extends down towards the headwater here...
...and right across to the far bank of the Ohio River.
It's 100,000 acres.
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.
You will be a country unto yourself.
His Majesty is most generous.
Though your service in this war more than warrants such a gift.
Yes, this is how His Majesty rewards those...
...who fight for him as gentlemen.
I dare to presume my own meager contributions will be rewarded one day.
You may presume too much.
His Majesty, like history, judges us by the outcome of the war...
...and the manner in which it was fought.
We serve the Crown, and we must conduct ourselves accordingly.
Surrendering troops will be given quarter.
These brutal tactics must stop!
Is it not enough that I have never lost a battle?
You serve me...
...and the manner in which you serve me reflects upon me!
I would've thought that a gentleman from a family as esteemed as yours...
...would understand that.
My late father squandered any esteem in which we were held...
...along with my inheritance.
I advance myself only through victory.
You advance yourself only through my good graces.
These Colonials are our brethren.
And when this conflict is over, we will re-establish commerce with them.
Do you understand, colonel?
Perfectly, my lord.
Reverend, with your permission,
I'd like to make an announcement.
Young man, this is a house of God.
I understand that, reverend.
I apologize.
The South Carolina Militia is being called up.
I'm here to enlist every man willing.
Son...
...we are here to pray...
...for the souls of those men hanging outside.
Yes, pray for them.
But honor them by taking up arms with us.
And bring more suffering to this town?
If King George can hang those men, he can hang any one of us.
Dan Scott...
...barely a week ago you railed for two hours about independence.
Mr. Hardwick, how many times have I heard you...
...speak of freedom at my father's table?
Half the men in this church, including you, Father...
...and you, reverend...
...are as ardent patriots as I.
Will you now, when you are needed most, stop at only words?
Is that the sort of men you are?
I ask only that you act upon the beliefs...
...of which you have so strongly spoken...
...and in which you so strongly believe.
Who's with us?
Mr. Howard.
Sir...
...may I have permission to write to Anne?
- May I have permission to write Anne?
- Yes.
You have permission...
...to write me.
Oh, write her.
Very well.
Thank you, sir.
Reverend?
A shepherd must tend his flock.
And, at times, fight off the wolves.
Are you sure this is the right place to recruit for a militia?
God save King George!
I think we came to the right place.
- Any bounty?
- No scalp money this time, Rollins.
But you can keep or sell me the muskets and gear of any Redcoat you kill.
They hanged my brother down in Acworth.
Every damned one of them Redcoats deserves to die.
- Sign up.
- With all my ailments...
...I wouldn't make it through the first skirmish. No, sir.
But you can have my Negro.
He'll fight in my stead.
Occam! Get over here.
Ain't overly smart.
He's strong as a bull.
Can you write?
No, no, sir.
- Well, then, make your mark.
- Why?
I just signed him over to you.
If you're willing, make your mark.
That'll do.
I'll kill me some Redcoats.
I believe you would.
How old are you?
Not quite old enough.
But his time will come.
John Billings.
I was hoping you'd turn up.
There's a story going around about 20 Redcoats...
...got killed by a ghost or some damn thing.
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.
Aren't you a little old to be believing in ghost stories?
How many did you get?
Twelve.
Good.
These men, they're not the sort we need.
They're exactly the sort we need.
They've fought this kind of war before.
What about me?
Am I one of that sort?
Hell, no.
Your sort gives that sort a bad name.
I want accuracy and precision.
Make ready!
Take aim!
Fire!
Dear Anne:
Our force continues to grow.
As long as we continue to fight, others will come to fight beside us.
I long to see you and speak to you.
I'm hopeful that our duties will bring me near you.
Until then, I am and will remain most affectionately yours.
Gabriel.
We surrender!
No! God, stop!
For the love of God, we...
These men were about to surrender!
Perhaps.
We will never know.
This is murder!
Hell, reverend, they're Redcoats.
They've earned it.
- We're better than that.
- What do you know about war?
I know the difference between fighting...
Go back to church!
Quiet!
He's right.
Quarter will be given to British wounded and any who surrender.
They gave no quarter when they fired on a ship carrying my wife and daughters.
I watched from 200 yards off as they were burned alive.
- All my sympathy, but my order stands.
- Damn your sympathy.
Who are you to give such an order?
I know what you did to my countrymen at Fort Wilderness.
We're militia.
This is not regular army.
Every man here is free to come and go as he pleases.
But while you're here...
...you will obey my command or I will have you shot.
- Damn dogs!
- Shoot the damn things!
- Stay that pistol.
- They won't let you near the wagon.
- Rum, Madeira.
- No wonder they were guarding it.
Officers' uniforms.
What you think all this is worth?
It's the personal correspondence of Lord Cornwallis.
This is his journal.
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs and use the papers for musket wadding.
Eat the dogs?
Dog is a fine meal.
Good heavens.
I have some maps here for you.
Put them down over there.
Thank you.
Here. A proper musket for you.
I don't know about you, but I don't like the idea giving muskets to slaves.
Your sense of freedom is as pale as your skin.
Don't listen to them.
If we win this war, a lot of things will change.
What will change?
They call this the New World.
It's not. It's the same as the old.
But we'll have a chance to build a new world.
A world where all men are created equal under God.
Equal.
Sounds good.
I've just been in the mind of a genius.
Cornwallis knows more about warfare than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes.
That's cheerful news.
His victories at Camden and
Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.
And he knows it, what's more.
Perhaps that's his weakness.
Sir?
Pride.
Pride's a weakness.
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.
Pride will do.
Finished, my lord.
I've taken it in at the back...
...added wider epaulets and looped gold braiding.
- It's a horse blanket.
- I don't know, my lord.
It's really quite nice.
- Very nice, my lord.
- Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.
Colonel Tavington, why, after six weeks...
...am I still attending a ball in South Carolina...
...when I should be attending balls in North Carolina?
First, the theft of my baggage...
...including my memoirs, on which I spent countless hours.
Then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charles Town burned.
If you can't protect our supply lines against militia...
...how do you intend doing so against the Regulars or the French?
They won't fight like Regulars.
We can't find them.
Colonel, they're militia.
They're farmers with pitchforks!
They're rather more than that,
I'm afraid.
Made so by their commander, this ghost.
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.
You created this ghost, colonel.
Your brutality swelled his ranks.
Without them this ghost would've disappeared...
...and I'd be in North Carolina by now!
In my defense, my lord...
Oh, enough, enough!
A fine soldier you are, bested by a bedtime story.
Give me the horse blanket.
O'Hara, our supply ship appears to have arrived.
Yes, my lord, it has.
Then why am I still wearing this rag?
Your replacement wardrobe is aboard ship, but...
...Colonel Tavington thought it best to secure our arms and munitions first.
They are being unloaded.
You look good in that color.
It stinks.
Well, it's had a dead man in it.
The beasts took your dogs too?
Yes.
Fine animals.
A gift from His Majesty.
Dead now, for all I know.
Is there no decency?
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!
Mr. Howard.
I've come to call on Anne.
I've come to call on Anne!
Well, of course you call yourself a man.
Father, stop it. You heard him.
Well...
...call on her.
I'm nearly finished.
You needn't worry, Father.
Yeah, I know.
Bundling bags are a wonderful tradition. I don't mind in the least.
Be still.
Tea?
Please.
There.
Come, dear.
It's very good.
I'm pleased that you like it.
Peter.
Don't worry. I sew better than my mother did.
I hope so.
If you're just gonna stand there...
...why don't you read it for us?
I can't read.
I can.
"Take notice.
By order of General Washington and the Continental Congress...
...all bound slaves who give minimum one year service...
...in the Continental Army...
...will be granted freedom...
...and be paid a bounty of five shillings for each month of service."
Did you hear that?
First they'll free them, then they'll pay them.
Only another six months.
What will you do with freedom?
I made this for you.
Look after your mother.
You know, Peter...
...I can't pay you for this.
Benjamin, you pay me what you can, when you can.
I'm obliged.
Gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you.
No, no, he's more like his mother.
Corporal!
Take your time. Dogs.
Sir.
This road is closed.
These wagons now belong to the Continental Army.
Ready arms!
By twos!
There's no need for your men to die.
Leave the wagons and go.
This is the king's highway.
And I advise you and your men to make way.
Charge!
Fire!
Retreat!
Save yourselves!
Retreat!
Ambush! Ambush!
I have the count.
22 are dead.
18 wounded and 20 are missing.
I'm through.
He won't be the last to leave.
Trust me.
Soon my countrymen will arrive.
- The French army is...
- To hell with you.
And to hell with the French army.
We don't need them.
We got Benjamin Martin.
We know what he done to the French.
Father.
Men always buy you drinks because of what happened at Fort Wilderness.
Strangers know more about you than I do.
Tell me what happened.
Your mother asked me that question around about the time you were born.
I was drunk and foolish enough to answer it.
The French and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge.
The English settlers had sought refuge at Fort Charles.
By the time we got there, the fort was abandoned.
They'd left about a week before.
But what we found was...
Go on.
They'd killed all the settlers, the men.
With the women and...
...some of the children, they had...
We buried them all, what was left of them.
We caught up with them at Fort Wilderness.
We took our time.
We cut them apart slowly.
Piece by piece.
I can see their faces.
I can still hear their screams.
All but two. We let them live.
We sent the heads on a pallet...
...with the two that lived back to Fort Ambercon.
The eyes, tongues, fingers...
...we put in baskets.
Sent them down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.
Soon after, the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French.
That's how we justified it.
We were...
...heroes.
And men bought you drinks.
Not a day goes by where I don't ask
God's forgiveness for what I did.
Thomas was my brother, as well as your son.
You may not believe this, but I want satisfaction as much as you do.
But not at the expense of our cause.
There will be a time for revenge.
But until then, stay the course.
Your mother said that when
I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas.
I miss him.
The British got 18 of our men at Fort Carolina.
They'll be hung one at a time until they give up the rest of us.
Reverend...
...can you write a letter for me?
- To my wife and boy.
- Yes, of course I will.
But first let us pray.
My lord...
...there is a rider at the gates.
A civilian carrying a white flag.
I am occupied.
He has a pair of dogs with him.
Great Danes.
And dear Lord...
...protect us in this, our hour of need.
This we ask in the name of the Father, the Son...
And the Holy Ghost.
Wait here.
General Lord Cornwallis will be with you shortly.
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys.
Come.
My good boys. My brave boys.
You seem to be well fed.
I thank you for that.
I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I'm a colonel in the Continental Army.
My rank should be sufficient for now.
As you wish.
Please be seated.
Thank you.
Would you, as the initiating officer, care to begin?
I will, unless you'd like to claim aggrieved status.
Yes, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Very well, sir. Proceed.
You have in your possession belongings of mine including clothing...
...furniture, personal effects of a non-military nature...
...which I'd like returned to me.
Indeed. I will do so as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Now we come to the matter of the specific targeting...
...of officers during engagements.
You must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field...
...must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
To your mind, what are appropriate levels of hostile attention?
Imagine the chaos that would follow...
...from leaderless armies having at each other.
There must be gentlemen in command to lead...
...and, where necessary, restrain their men.
Restrain them from, say, targeting civilians. Women, children and such.
That's a separate issue.
No. I consider them linked.
And as long as your soldiers attack civilians...
...I will order the shooting of officers at every engagement.
And my men are excellent marksmen.
Very well.
- Now, let us move on to...
- Prisoner exchange.
Sir?
You have 18 of my men.
I want them back.
I do have 18 criminals under sentence of death...
...but I hold no prisoners of war.
If that's your position,
18 of your officers will have to die.
Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
My officers?
Sir.
Top of the ridge, to your left.
Below the tree line.
Their names and ranks?
They refused to give names. There are
9 lieutenants, 5 captains, 3 majors...
...and one fat colonel who called me...
...a cheeky fellow.
This is not the conduct of a gentleman.
If the conduct of your officers is the measure of a gentleman...
...I'll take that as a compliment.
Get my men.
- Arrange the exchange.
- My lord.
Thank you, sir.
Release the prisoners!
- What is this?
- Prisoner exchange.
He has 18 of our officers.
Who is he? I recognize him.
He's the commander of the militia.
- Your ghost.
- Stay that sword, colonel!
He rode in under a white flag for formal parley.
This is madness.
If you harm him, you condemn our officers.
With respect, sir, he's killed as many officers in the last two months.
He has shown no aggression here.
Hence he cannot be touched.
Has he not?
You!
So you're the ghost, are you?
I remember you!
On that farm! That stupid little boy!
Did he die?
You know...
...it's an ugly business, doing one's duty.
But just occasionally...
...it's a real pleasure.
Before this war is over,
I'm going to kill you.
Why wait?
Soon.
Move out!
But I still think it's imperative to push north.
One of our captured officers, my lord.
My reputation suffers because of your incompetence!
That man insults me!
Quite impressive for a farmer with a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?
I want you to find that man.
I want you to capture him.
The man has the loyalty of the people.
They protect him. Protect his family.
Protect the families of his men.
I can capture him for you.
But to do so requires the use of tactics that are somewhat...
What was the word your lordship used?
"Brutal," I think.
Go on.
I am prepared to do what is necessary.
I alone will assume the full mantle of responsibility for my actions...
...free of the chain of command...
...rendering you blameless.
However...
...if I do this...
...you and I both know that I can never return to England with honor.
What, I wonder, is to become of me?
When this war is over here in the Colonies...
...the new aristocracy...
...will be landowners.
Tell me about Ohio.
Make way.
As you were.
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles from Wakefield, on the Santee...
...east of Black Swamp.
Who lived there?
Benjamin Martin.
He's the ghost.
What do you know about him?
Hell, everything.
I could tell you the size of his boot.
Does he have family?
Where would he hide his children?
His wife's sister has a plantation.
It's not far.
Aunt Charlotte!
Wake up, someone's coming!
Get the boys.
Margaret, come quickly.
- Let's go.
- Boys, come.
Go.
Stay close.
This way.
Follow me.
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.
Margaret, quick!
Get down there! Fast!
Samuel, get down there fast!
Beneath the sill. There.
There's no one in the house.
They can't be far.
Search the outbuildings and the woods, quickly.
Prepare to fire the house.
Go.
This one's head of the house slaves.
Where are they hiding?
Keep looking!
They're here somewhere!
- Gabriel.
- Where's Father?
Torch the house!
To horse!
Come on! It's all right.
Susan, come here.
Charlotte!
They won't stop looking for us.
You'll be safe where we're taking you.
Father said it was a perfect place to hide.
How is he?
I don't know. I'm his son.
Where is Father?
Speaking for months now.
Speaking for months.
Why did he go?
He didn't want those mean men to find you, so he led them away.
He'll come see you as soon as he can.
I don't care. I hate him.
Susan, you don't hate him.
I hate him, and I hope he never comes back.
It's the children.
Abigale!
You're alive!
I know it's not much, but you can stay here with me.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
She spoke. Susan talked to you?
In full sentences.
As if she'd been speaking all along.
Damn, I wasn't there for it.
What did she say?
She said...
...that she loves you and misses you...
...but understands why you can't be with her.
My Lord, she said that.
Isn't that something?
Tavington has a list of our men.
He's burning our homes...
...killing whomever resists.
- Where?
- Seven homes along the Santee so far.
John.
John, this is not a time for vengeance.
This is a time for mourning.
John.
No!
Attend to your families.
One week furlough for all men.
Any man who does not return will not be thought a coward or uncommitted.
Father!
Papa!
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?
They're from good stock on their father's side.
Susan?
I see it. There it is. Look.
Look, Father.
I got it! I got it!
You got it.
I got it!
- Careful.
- I caught it.
- All the fish are over here.
- Let's get them.
Father, what changed you?
Are you sure I have?
Yes. You changed.
That's simple.
It was your mother.
A woman can have a strange effect on a man.
There were times...
...I had trouble breathing around your mother.
I know the feeling.
You once said...
...when I had a family of my own,
I'd understand.
You were right.
You're trying to tell me something.
- Apple?
- Thank you.
Congratulations.
Anne Patricia Howard...
...will you have this man to be your husband to live in marriage?
Will you love, comfort and honor him...
...for so long as you both shall live?
I will.
Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have this woman to be your wife...
...to live together in the covenant of marriage?
Will you love, comfort and honor her as long as you both shall live?
I will.
Then by the power vested in me by our mutual faith...
...in the Lord, our God...
...I now pronounce you man and wife.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
It's fine.
I have something for you.
It belonged to Gabriel's mother.
It's beautiful.
Allow me.
It's the North Star.
That's the only star in the sky that never moves.
It's constant, unwavering.
A guide.
I'd be honored.
May I?
- If you must.
- I must.
May I sit with you?
It's a free country.
Or at least it will be.
I'm not my sister.
I know that.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
Very well, then.
Well?
Well what?
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.
Not soon enough.
I'm counting on you to make sure...
- I know.
- What?
- Say my prayers, take care of everyone.
- Couldn't have said it better.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Susan.
Goodbye?
Just one word, that's all I want.
All right.
Papa!
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.
Please, Papa.
I'll say anything you want.
Tell me what you want me to say.
I'll say anything.
I promise, Papa. Please don't go.
I promise.
I'll come back.
I'll come back. You believe me?
You know, you make me very happy.
Just the three of us?
John Raskin did come by earlier.
He looked around, then he left.
He would've made four.
Four would have been better.
I got another two months to go before I get to twelve months.
Colonel.
Reverend.
Trust the French.
Yes, trust the French.
Where else do I get the opportunity to kill a few Redcoats?
Perhaps a few wounded ones when you are not looking.
Everyone must gather at the church.
Mr. Wilkins?
Colonel Tavington wishes to address the whole village.
This town has given aid to
Benjamin Martin and his rebels.
I wish to know his whereabouts.
So...
...anyone who comes forward...
...may be forgiven their treason.
Very well.
- You had your chance.
- Wait!
- This man gives them supplies.
- Quiet!
- He brings them to Black Swamp.
- Liar!
In the marsh, by the old Spanish mission.
This man here?
- Yes.
- The Black Swamp, you say?
By the old Spanish mission.
Thank you very much.
Shut the doors.
But you said we'd be forgiven.
And indeed you may!
That's between you and God.
Be strong. We must.
I'll fire the town on your orders.
The town?
Burn the church.
There's no honor in this.
Didn't you say all those who stand against England...
...deserve to die a traitor's death?
Burn the church, captain.
Give me the torch.
The honor is found in the end, not the means.
This will be forgotten.
Bordon.
Anne!
Mrs. Howard?
Where is everybody?
They're not here.
Gabriel's gone.
To arms! To arms!
Father.
Just don't talk. Don't talk.
Father.
- I'm sorry.
- Be quiet.
I'll take care of you.
You'll be all right.
I'm sorry about Thomas.
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.
That was mine.
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.
Don't go. Gabriel, don't.
Oh, God help me. God help me.
Where is he?
I'll help you bury him.
I'll bury him.
My wife in Alexandria is with child.
My first.
I fight for that child.
Benjamin, nothing will replace your sons.
But if you come with us, you can justify their sacrifice.
Why?
Why do men feel they can justify death?
Is it arrogance or?
I have long feared...
...that my sins would return to visit me.
And the cost is more than I can bear.
Benjamin, we have a chance.
Greene and Dan Morgan are down from Virginia.
If we win this next battle, victory in the war is within our grasp.
Go, then.
Seek your victory.
- I'm small issue to it.
- You're wrong, Benjamin.
You matter to your men...
...and to others as well.
Your victories...
...and your losses...
...are shared by more than you know.
Stay with us.
Stay the course.
I have run my course.
You men will be leaving with us.
Prepare the baggage.
Jean.
You will be missed tomorrow, colonel.
- Missed, my lord?
- Your wound.
It's nothing, my lord.
I am, as ever, ready to serve.
Very well.
Make sure you do.
I stand on the eve of the greatest victory of my career. Don't fail me.
My efforts in no small measure have brought you here.
I grant you that small measure...
...in spite of your failure to deliver the ghost to me.
Thus far.
I will not tolerate a premature charge...
...born of your eagerness for glory.
Wait for my order.
Or you may abandon any hope of Ohio.
Tomorrow's battle can alter the course of the war.
General Greene, what exactly is the task before us?
Gentlemen,
Cornwallis has us cornered.
Not only does he outnumber us...
...but nearly half of our force is militia.
Unreliable, at best.
Excuse me, sir.
You underestimate our militia.
All of you do.
We've seen our militia lines break time and again.
Kips Bay, Princeton.
But the British have seen that too.
Cornwallis' own letters bear out that he has no respect for the militia.
What are you suggesting, Ben?
I'm suggesting we use that.
I know you men have sacrificed a lot so far.
But all I'm asking is that you...
...let the front line of the militia fire two shots tomorrow.
A lot can happen in the time it takes to fire two shots.
Especially against British Regulars.
Indeed. That's why I'm not asking you to fire three.
If I die, I will die well dressed.
Fire!
- Battalion!
- Company, halt!
Harry...
...will you give this to my children?
Thank you.
It's October now.
I know.
It's more than 12 months.
You're a free man.
I'm here now on my own accord.
I'm honored to have you with us.
Honored.
Shoulder arms!
Forward...
...march!
How old were your daughters?
Violette was 12 and Pauline, 10.
They had green eyes.
I'm sure they were lovely.
Yes, they were.
- Battalion!
- Company!
March!
Fire!
Unless I'm dreaming...
...I believe I see militia forming at their center.
Battalion, halt!
Dress ranks!
Make ready!
Battalion!
Halt!
Take aim!
Fire!
Fire!
Hold the line!
- Prepare to charge!
- We haven't been given that order.
Charge!
Charge!
Tavington.
Damn him! Damn that man!
Make ready.
Take aim!
Fire!
Take aim!
Fire!
Retreat!
Bayonet charge. We'll see who takes the glory from this field.
Charge!
Congratulations, my lord.
Infantry reserve into the center.
But you've taken the field.
Now we'll take their spirits.
Send the battalion over that hill and crush them.
It ends today.
Hold the charge!
Fire!
Hold the charge!
Fire!
Take aim!
Fire!
Charge!
Charge bayonets!
Halt!
Hold! Dress your ranks!
Fire!
Charge!
Retreat!
Colonel!
The line is faltering!
Retreat! Retreat!
Wait!
No retreat!
Hold the line!
Hold the line!
Push forward, men!
Artillery, concentrate on the center.
If we reform and wheel right, we may be able to turn their flank.
You dream, general.
Kill me before the war is over, will you?
It appears you are not...
...the better man.
You're right.
My sons were better men.
Sound the retreat.
Sound...
...retreat.
Dear Charlotte:
The war has turned.
General Cornwallis took flight with his army and moved north.
We continued to engage the British, and in the following months...
... Cornwallis entrenched himself at Yorktown, Virginia.
Washington escaped from the north...
... and surrounded Cornwallis, who could not retreat to the seas.
It was blocked off by our long-lost friends...
... who had finally arrived.
Vive la France.
Vive la liberté.
My lord, I beseech you.
You must order the surrender.
How could it come to this?
An army of rabble.
Peasants.
Everything will change.
Everything has changed.
Though he eventually surrendered...
... Cornwallis himself hid in shame...
... appointing his subordinate to relinquish his sword.
With the war ending, and our militia disbanding...
... I take measure of what we have lost...
... and what we have won.
My hope and prayer is that the sacrifices borne by so many...
... will spawn and fulfill the promise of our new nation.
Tell the children, and especially
Susan, that I will keep my promise...
... as I will be returning to you all soon.
Where will you go now?
Home. Start over.
Your wife's expecting a child, isn't she?
She gave birth to a son three weeks ago.
What'd you name him?
We named him Gabriel.
Thank you, Harry.
Gabriel is a good name for a farmer.
It is. It is.
Jean.
Ben.
Gabriel said if we won the war...
...we could build a whole new world.
Just figured we'd get started right here...
...with your home.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
Ma'am.
Charlie!
Watch out!
My hand!
Goddamn!
We're running out of ammo.
We gotta get out of here.
Move!
Come on!
Come on, you can do it! Come on!
We got nothin', Enders!
We're out of ammo!
Joe... Nobody else needs to die.
We can go! We can get outta here!
We got orders!
They told us to hold the position!
And that's what we're gonna do!
Get up, marine!
Hold the goddamn position!
Come on!
Get down!
Tommy.
Goddamn you!
Oh, no! No!
- Bill!
- I'm out.
Come on! Come on!
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.
No... No!
No!
Raise your right hand.
- I... State your full name...
- I, Ben Yahzee...
Do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the US...
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic...
Jap Ha-Go. Who can give me the code word for "tank"?
Come on. You boys wanna be codetalkers.
Show me some brains. Think!
What do we call a tank?
Chay-da-gahi.
Tortoise. Good.
Artillery. Code word?
In code. Private Whitehorse.
Be-al-doh-tso-lani?
Very good.
Japanese Zero. Code word?
We can go! We can get outta here!
They told us to hold the position!
Nice day, huh?
Joe?
Joe.
Didn't hear a word, did you?
That's what happens to a man when he's talking to a beautiful woman.
It happens when you're not watching my lips, Joe.
Watch this.
You're a mess, Joe.
You're not fooling anybody.
No, Rita. He's a mess.
I'm getting better every day.
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.
Your equilibrium's all screwy.
You can't go back to war if you can't stand up.
Let's go, marines. This war ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.
Joe...
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?
Somebody's gotta keep the WAVES company.
Are you gonna help me or not?
Marked improvement.
And his left ear is the worse of the two?
It's... amazing.
TBY hasn't got the range of the TBX.
So you may need a relay to get your transmission to command post.
But what it really comes down to is speed and accuracy under pressure.
Transcribe now.
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over.
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!
We're losing men.
I need this message decrypted.
"Request fire support. We have target at one-one-niner, Baker one-five. "
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun.
Fire at will. "
Beginner's luck.
You're up, mac.
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.
Better than you did as a civilian.
Stole a motorbike, crashed it.
Got kicked out of high school.
Assault and battery... on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?
A priest?
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan
High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.
Public-school boy myself.
Some minor problems in boot.
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.
And you made a hell of a stand on the Solomons.
Tough bit of business there, huh?
Pretty tough, sir.
But you're prepared to jump right back into it?
Yes, sir. Very much so.
Very much so.
Well...
The Japs have pretty much busted every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.
You men on the Solomons were lost to a broken code.
Tell me something. You ever run into any Indians on the Solomons?
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.
The Corps has developed a new code based on their language.
It's had quite an impact.
So much so the navy have decided to go to great lengths to protect it.
That's why you're here.
You're to pair with one of them, keep his ass safe.
Your job is to keep him alive so he can do his job.
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe
I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs, not baby-sitting some Indian.
Enders, we didn't pick your name out of a hat.
We need good marines.
That's why you're standing here.
Take a look.
It's a Navajo. Or it was.
Tortured to death by Japanese intelligence trying to bust our code.
Fortunately, he couldn't help them even if he wanted to.
- Sir?
- Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.
Code's based on their language, but it is still a code.
Tojo would like nothing more than to catch a live one.
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal, cannot leave this room.
Under no circumstances can you allow your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.
Your mission is to protect the code... at all costs.
You understand me?
Yes, sir, I do.
Good.
Congratulations. You just made sergeant.
Keep those hands vertical.
Way to go, marine.
Fortino, take over.
Hey... That was you, right, sitting in front of the major's office?
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.
I'm from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.
So you're with JASCO too, huh?
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?
No fuckin' idea, mac.
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.
They've never seen so many Navajo.
Looks to me like you got to see a little action there.
Me too.
Jap sons of bitches shot me right in the ass.
You believe that shit?
I wasn't running or nothin'.
So, your duty with JASCO have anything to do with these Navajo radiomen?
I'm not at liberty to say.
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell me are the same orders I can't tell you.
Hell of a thing, huh?
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant.
It's the marines.
Yeah.
They look pretty normal, I guess.
Expecting them to wear war paint?
Maybe we ought to go introduce ourselves. They look a little lost to me.
Henderson.
I wouldn't get too friendly.
How!
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.
Whitehorse.
This is Yahzee. Ben.
- Next.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.
Who's next?
Mind if I join you?
I'm Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.
How you doin'?
You're blocking my view.
Oh, sorry.
What do they call this crap anyway?
Marines call it chow.
Well, there's a propaganda effort.
Sorry. You can have mine.
Shit.
What'd you say your name was again,
Private?
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.
Hold this.
Shit.
I'm in for a couple more.
Tell him I say hello.
Pair of cowboys for Big E.
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin' good.
- Oh, come on!
- Now there's a bold move.
All right.
OK... Oh, another mess for the Sunshine State.
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.
Hey! Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty.
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits.
Call.
We all got thumbs up our asses.
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy in Intel that says we ship out in a week.
I been hearing "next week" for a month.
I didn't know you knew anybody in Intelligence, Harri.
Next year'd be all right with me.
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep.
Look at that. Nines and fours.
Full boat, baby.
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die.
Oh, Jesus!
Ouch. Ouch.
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.
God knows what a girl will do without reassurance.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats opening up. You wanna come join us?
Are you serious?
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?
Card on the head, only fool can't see it is you.
You want to come on over, or what?
Cut me in.
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low, hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...
Hey, don't let him scare you.
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's like any other. Waste of time and money.
Well, ante up... Chief.
How'd you know I was a chief?
You must've seen me showering with my war bonnet.
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up.
- You know, we don't take wampum here.
Beautiful.
All right, then.
Orders finally came through.
We ship out tomorrow morning.
Destination: the island of Saipan, which is one of the stepping stones we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.
It's of strategic importance that we capture this island.
We can get ourselves an advanced naval base and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's and get our bombers within range of Tokyo.
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil, and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.
They're gonna fight for every square inch, because it's their home, but we're gonna take it away from 'em!
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!
We're gonna be in front of the whole damn division.
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears.
We're gonna be sniffin' out enemy positions, coordinating the naval gunfire - exactly what we've been training to do for the last four months. All right?
Now, we got some new radiomen from headquarters.
There's a Private Whitehorse... and Yahzee... and a couple of sergeants,
Enders and Henderson, who, if I'm understanding these orders correctly, will be covering our Navajos' asses.
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!
...but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin' into our share of the shit nonetheless.
Any questions?
Sounds like you're dying.
These might help get rid of the taste.
Charlie and I, we both lost it on the boat ride from San Diego.
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.
Life Savers really helped.
You want a Life Saver?
What are you doin' here?
Just trying to help.
Not what I meant.
You mean what am I doing in this uniform?
It's my war too, Sergeant.
I'm fighting for my country, for my land, for my people.
Not your people I'm worried about.
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker.
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes to do what used to take an hour.
Now, somebody wearing a lot more stripes than you thinks that's worth something.
Remind me to time you when you got bullets flying over your head.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!
From the halls of Montezuma
To the shores of Tripoli
We will fight our country's battles
On the land and on the sea
First to fight for right and freedom
And to keep our honor clean
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marines
Hi.
How's that ear?
Not that you'd ever admit it, but if it starts aching, take a couple of those.
And call me in the morning.
You're not gonna be here in the morning, are you?
Shipping out without even buying me a drink.
Ought to be ashamed of yourself, hustling a... hustling marines.
What's your poison?
Jeez, might as well go all out.
I'll get a shot of something.
Rum.
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi.
Make that two.
May as well join me, huh?
- Why not?
- OK.
Thank you.
Well... to war.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Get those men spread out!
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!
Come on, keep up!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on!
- How am I doin'?
- You're good.
Let's go!
Stay on my ass.
I told you to stay on my ass!
- Stay low!
- Get out of there!
Go!
Get him outta there!
Get me outta here!
- Hold still, damn it!
- Get him outta there!
You sons of bitches!
Fortino! Cover me!
Whitehorse, get down!
Get down!
Pappas!
Corpsman!
Helmet goes on your head! Corpsman!
Take care of him.
Put a hand on this.
Tank! Tank! Tank!
You ready? Go! Go!
Harrigan, light it up!
Let's go, boys! Keep up the fight!
Are you hit? Are you hit?
You're OK. You're good, you're good.
- Are you OK, Chick?
- Still in the hunt, Gunny.
- Harri?
- You ain't gettin' rid of me that easy.
- Stay low!
- Nellie? Pappas?
Yeah, we're good.
Greek's predisposed to hyperventilate.
What?
I can't breathe when I get excited.
Goddamn! Must be hell on your gal!
Enders, get the navy on the horn and tell 'em to dig out those guns.
Target reference... dog one... right 700.
Elevation zero-five-zero.
Relay the damn coordinates!
Arizona! Arizona!
Target reference, dog one, south 700, elevation zero-five-zero.
Right 200!
Up 50. Fire for effect.
Let's go!
Move!
Harrigan!
Torch the box!
Kill him!
Goddamn it!
Shit.
Nellie. Take the satchel charge.
You hear me? Move!
You're gonna cover me, right?
I'll go with you. We flank left.
I'll cover you. Smoke and cover.
I can do this.
I can do this.
Smoke 'em up!
Cover up.
Shit!
Shit. Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!
Biscuits? How can you ruin biscuits?
You are a whiny son of a bitch right now, aren't you?
2200 hours in jungle hell - what does that make it on the East Coast?
How the fucking hell should I know?
Just seven...
It's 8am, Sunday morning.
I hope my side of the bed didn't get taken up Saturday night.
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer, you keep worrying about her.
Might get my ass sent back to Rhody, though.
There's plenty of dollies outside of Rhode Island, Nell. Many plenty.
- Well, there sure as shit ain't any here.
- Ain't that the truth.
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach.
The most beautiful women in the world.
This one time, before the war,
I'm lyin' on the beach and this sweet little thing named Molly comes out the water.
She walks straight up to me and asks me if I'm hungry... cos she's havin' a weenie roast.
Shit! Damn.
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.
Now I'm on Saipan with this giant Zippo strapped to my back and I'm roastin' human beings.
Why I volunteered... beyond me.
Damn, I'm proud to be here.
My whole family's been in the Corps.
My old man, he's a lifer.
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea.
Around the house too.
Maybe now he'll back off.
Pappas, I...
I want you to do me a favor.
If anything should happen to me, you make sure that my wife gets this.
I mean, she picked them out and all.
Don't talk like that, Nell.
You don't even joke about shit like that.
Now you put that ring back on.
You're goin' home.
Hey.
Don't thank me till you've tried it.
You missed mail call.
What the hell are they doin'?
I don't know.
They've been doin' it since sundown.
Sounds like some kind of prayer.
Maybe they know our orders.
Think you could do it, Joe?
Give it a rest, Henderson.
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?
Getting on my uniform.
You know the difference between you and a Jap, Yahzee?
It's that uniform.
That's it.
See, I know you people.
I know what kind of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.
You ought to be careful out here all alone.
No baby-sitter.
I might just take you for a Jap.
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?
Or keep demonstrating what an ignorant fool you are?
How's that for an ignorant fool?
Go ahead, try again.
You gonna do somethin'?
Chick! Come on!
Get off me!
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.
Ben? Shit.
I thought he was a Jap. You know, killed some marine for that uniform.
Sure you did, Chick.
Damn Injun looks just like a Jap, don't he?
Look, I'm no damn Injun.
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.
But you do look like a Nip.
Next time you decide to take a bath,
Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.
Fuckin' shitbird.
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter all the time, I thought.
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.
That ceremony you saw last night?
It's called a protection ceremony.
Navajo believe, until a body's given a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.
Chindis - that's what we call evil spirits. Demons.
I haven't thought much about it since I was a kid.
Till I saw those dead bodies.
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.
Because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead?
That's right. Cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead.
You ever see ghosts?
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That's an order.
Sounds beautiful.
You, uh, you self-taught?
My dad was always playing.
You know what they say: if you can't beat 'em...
No shit. My dad, he... he gave me this thing.
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.
Used to bring 'em in for feeding with this little tune I played.
I know I ain't gonna get you to quit playin' that thing, so... like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...
I don't think it's gonna work.
Well, we ain't got much else to do out here. What the hell?
OK.
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?
Or, given that you're not much of a writer, should I not expect an answer?
The newspapers say our boys are doing great.
But I don't think the reporters have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.
I found a stray dog the other day on Waikiki.
I gave him a bath and took him in.
He reminded me of you - but cuter.
At least he keeps me warm at night.
I try not to think about you. About what might be happening over there.
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,
I can't keep myself from wondering where you are.
How you're doing.
What the hell you doin'?
Writing a letter to my son.
Forget your orders? No letters out.
Command don't want postmarks going to the reservation.
Hey! You hear me?
I thought that he might read 'em when I get home.
What's his name?
Your son.
It's George. George Washington.
George Washington Yahzee.
It's got a bit of a ring to it.
My wife wasn't so sure.
She's a little more traditional.
- Nice-looking family.
- Let's see, Yahz.
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.
He's got a mind of his own.
Can I try one of those?
- You smoke?
- Not really.
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Follow me!
- Let's go!
- I'm hit!
- Yahzee!
Yahzee!
I'm hit!
Take it off! It burns!
You're not hit. Just shut up.
You're not hit.
- Spread out!
- Move!
- Where the hell are they comin' from?
- From us.
- What?
- They're not Jap guns.
- We're getting shot at by our own guys?
- We're supposed to be on road 04.
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can't!
- Tell 'em they're shelling...
- I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.
- They're firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.
Do somethin'.
Shit... Follow me!
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road!
- Goddamn it!
God.
Son of a bitch!
I got you, mac!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Nellie!
Corpsman!
You were right, Joe.
I do look like a Nip.
What the hell are you talking about?
Putting on that Jap uniform. Trying to get one of their radios, call off our guns.
- That's stupid.
- Shut up. Let him talk.
- He's not goin' out there.
- You're not in charge here, Enders.
I got orders, Gunny.
He's my responsibility!
He's just a kid! You killed your own!
What's wrong with you?
You killed your own! Sons of bitches!
You killed your own!
- Sure you're up to this?
- Find out soon enough, sir.
- What the hell are you doin' there?
- I'm goin' with him.
If that's OK with you.
Give me the rifle.
Horyo-da.
It's Jap for prisoner.
Horyo-da.
Horyo-da.
All right, everybody be ready.
Horyo-da!
Now!
Hit me. Hit me.
Please don't hit me!
Yahzee!
Kill him!
Goddamn it, kill him!
Get on the radio!
Bowie White, Bowie White, this is Carson Red!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
You're shelling marines!
Sergeant!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Add 325, fire for effect!
Redirect fire. Add 325, fire for effect.
Let's go!
Crank it up! Let's go!
Commence fire!
Fire!
Yeah!
Well, I'll be.
Colonel. Can I help you, sir?
I'm looking for Sergeant Enders.
Joseph F Enders.
Enders.
Yes, sir.
Report I read claims you went above and beyond.
Sir?
You've been recommended for commendation.
And I concur. But I don't see any point in you having to wait around for all those formalities to work themselves out.
Not when I got one of these handy.
Congratulations, Enders.
You saved a lot of marines.
I wasn't alone in that, sir. I couldn't have done it without Private Ben Yahzee.
Oh... Right.
The, uh, Indian.
Begging the colonel's pardon, he's a Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.
Of course. Navajo. Towering House clan.
You keep up the good work, Enders.
Send that to Nellie's wife.
You ever not miss mail call, Enders?
My mom says somebody takes the time to write a letter, you should read the letter.
Does she let you drink, your mother?
No. But she's not here.
- What is it?
- Well, it ain't Chianti, I'll tell you that.
It's rice wine. It's Jap sake.
But it does the trick.
How much of this crap do you have anyway?
You have a little trouble with that ear, don't you, Joe?
Ah, real problem's the inner ear.
It's anvils and stirrups and shit.
I'm a little out of balance.
You done good on that hill today, Yahzee.
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
I bet I surprised the shit out of you.
It was a noble thing that you did, Joe.
To give your Silver Star to Nellie's wife.
I don't give a shit about medals.
The first one they gave me...
I threw it into the ocean.
What'd you get that one for?
For not dyin'.
The 15 men who fought with me got decorated too. For dying.
So...
Lieutenant was killed the night before and... none of the sergeants even made it out of the landing craft, so... that left me in charge.
It was my first command.
Orders were to hold some shitty swamp marsh on the ass-end of nowhere.
And I did.
All of the men under my command... men who trusted me... who begged me to pull back... not one of them made it.
Just one stupid asshole.
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star.
What were their names?
It might be good to tell a story about 'em.
You know, who they were and what they were like.
What a magical pile of Navajo horseshit.
What the hell for?
To honor them.
Their memory.
You know, it wasn't your fault, Joe.
You were just followin' orders.
Yeah.
I'm a good fuckin' marine.
That's why they gave me this detail.
Yeah.
I'm a good fuckin' marine.
- Joe!
- What?
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!
Really.
It's all right.
Come on, Joe. I got you.
What the fuck?
I ain't that drunk, Yahzee.
You cut that horseshit out.
I'm gonna mix my daddy's strawberries in this Swedish concoction called yoghurt.
God willin', America will develop the taste.
What about you, Charlie? What's life got in store for you after this mess?
Sheep.
Sheep? As in Chick's girlfriend, sheep?
Charlie's family owns the biggest flock in the Four Corners area.
No shit?
- You a rich man, Whitehorse?
- We do OK.
Taxis. A whole stinkin' fleet of 'em.
That's how I'm making my millions.
And then I'm goin' back to the motherland.
I'm gonna build myself a villa on the cliffs of Santorini.
Ah, Santorini, my friends - that's living.
Sounds nice. What about you, Zee?
Thinkin' about teaching.
Ah, teaching. Bring a little something back to the reservation?
Actually, more interested in bringing some of the reservation back to the world.
Hoping to teach college.
American history.
Oh, that's just what we need.
Yahzee teachin' college boys about
Custer's scalpin' at Little Bighorn.
And what about Kit Carson, and what they did to the Navajo in the Long Walk?
You ever read about that, Chick?
Didn't think so.
How about you, Joe?
- What?
- What are you doin' after this mess?
It's gotta end sometime.
Dear Joe, we got great news today.
President Roosevelt announced the end of blackouts on Hawaii.
We thought the day would never come.
There's still a ten o'clock curfew, but it doesn't matter to me.
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired to do anything but write letters.
There is a real sense that the war is going well, and could be over soon.
I think about you more and more.
If you're alive or dead out there.
I check the mail every day, knowing there's going to be an answer.
Are you reading these, Joe?
Are you listening?
- We're secure on the left side.
- Area's secured.
Set up defense positions.
Chick, bed 'em down for the night.
Harri.
That's startin' to sound like something.
I didn't know you were an artist.
Oh, it's stupid.
It's just something I would do as a kid on my grandmother's kitchen table.
Well, it's nice.
You Catholic?
I used to be.
I was thinkin' about when they confirmed me.
I was eight, and they anointed me with the holy water.
And I remember... they told me I was a soldier of Christ.
I guess somewhere along the way
I must have switched units.
It's oil.
They don't use holy water to confirm.
They use oil.
I was raised Catholic too.
Mission school on the reservation.
It's funny. Fathers didn't like us talking Navajo at Mass.
Of course, one Sunday I forgot.
They punished me by tying me to the radiator in the basement.
For two days.
I think I was eight too.
Well, they're sure lettin' you talk Navajo now.
Yeah.
You know, when this is over, maybe you should come out to Navajo country.
Monument Valley is a beautiful place.
It's peaceful.
You know, we could do some things that you don't do in the Corps.
Like ride horses, eat fry bread, do some hunting...
Horses.
I don't know.
It's a pretty long drive to Arizona.
But it might be worth it.
You know, you could meet my son.
And he could meet Joe Enders, the guy who watched over Daddy's scrawny ass.
You must be a very good father, Ben.
Ben. You know, you've never called me that before.
Enders. What kind of name is that anyway?
It's Italian. Used to be Endrolfini before some asshole at Ellis Island got hold of it.
Captain needs to code a message back to command post.
You the Indian?
Yeah, I'm the Indian.
It's just a few minutes' drive.
We'll get you back in no time.
- I need to speak with you, Gunny.
- Yeah. Give me a second.
Got this with the mail today.
You ever had pickled herring?
I need out.
What the hell are you talkin' about?
This detail.
My duty.
I can't do it.
Well, I need you, Enders.
Yeah. You've been saving a lot of marines.
I'm requesting mast with battalion commander. I want out.
Oh, yeah? You and me and every other mother's son. We all want out.
Well, as long as there's a Tojo and a Hitler out there we have to keep on fighting.
Is that understood?
- You're not hearing me.
- I'm hearing you just fine.
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide, and it ain't bein' waged on your wants and wishes.
Now you get some sack time.
That's an order.
Goddamn it! I can't do it!
I can't perform my duty!
Hey there, sweetheart.
Hi. It's OK.
You don't have to cry.
You're gonna be all right.
Got a present for you.
This is chocolate.
You see, you eat it... and it's good.
It's good.
You want some?
You'll have to chew it next time. Here.
Harrigan, go!
Incoming!
Run!
Go! Run!
Harrigan! Make her run!
Come on! To me!
Harrigan!
Come on, keep moving!
Fall back!
Help! Help!
I can't let 'em take us.
What are you talking about?
Enders!
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse.
Have you seen them?
He's over there.
Oh, shit...
This was supposed to be a secured area!
What happened?
I killed him.
You... you what?
I took my grenade and... and I threw it and I blew him up.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Yahzee!
Yahzee! Yahzee, no!
Get up!
Come on. You can do it.
- Yahzee.
- Let him go.
Yahzee, no.
Go on. Why can't... Come on. Do it.
- Do it!
- No.
You know, Whitehorse... he saved my bacon.
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer would make of that.
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians, like he was talkin' about gophers or somethin'.
About gettin' paid three dollars per Comanche ear.
I know. Gets you thinkin'.
Another 50 years, who knows, we could be sittin' down with the Nipponese.
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit... lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.
You think too much.
First time I ever been accused of that.
Thought I told you not to go traipsing around on your own.
You know, Charlie blessed my son in the Navajo way the day he was born.
He wondered about cowboys watching Indians' backs.
Something about it didn't seem right.
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.
He didn't even want to come to this damn war. I talked him into it.
Maybe you made a mistake.
Maybe we all did.
I was following orders, Ben.
My orders were to protect the code.
If one of you got caught, talked, the code would be useless.
I was following orders, Ben.
Course you were, Joe.
You're a damn good fuckin' marine.
The Viking wants to see you.
He says right away.
I want you to brief everybody, make clear what's happenin'.
All right. Got no problem with point, Gunny.
- That's good.
- You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
The 8th is moving out already and we need to be ahead of 'em.
The destination is that big piece of rock you see over there.
The last defensible ridge on this island.
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount,
Saipan is pretty much ours.
Yesterday, bombers beat the shit out of that rock.
The brass is nervous. They expected more resistance over there.
Now they want us to go over and check it out.
So where the hell they got us now?
Goin' up the mountain.
Have ourselves a little peek.
That codetalker is out front for a reason.
That's exactly where I need him to be.
If there's still a problem between the two of you,
I would like to straighten that out, right here, right now.
- No problem here, Gunny.
- That's good.
But there's still one here.
You just do what you're supposed to do, Sergeant.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Enders.
You got another letter.
Freeze!
Jesus Christ! We're in the middle of a goddamn minefield!
Chick's gonna get us out. Right, Chick?
Sure I am.
One line after Chick.
Pappas.
Pappas.
Move, Greek.
I'm gonna get my fuckin' balls blown off out here!
Yahzee! Stop!
Move out!
Yahzee!
Hey!
Nice shootin', Pap.
The 8th's movin' in.
We'd better check out the other side.
Got it. You all right?
Chick, take the left flank. Enders, go right. We'll cover you with a 30.
- On it.
- All right?
OK, let's go!
Move!
Hjelmstad!
- Help him up!
- Gunny!
Come on. Come on.
- Christ.
- Joe! Joe!
Tear him open.
You want morphine?
- You want morphine?
- Yeah.
You'll be all right, sir.
Goddamn it, Yahzee, get over here!
Fuck!
Chick... Stay with him.
I got ya.
I told you to stay with Gunny.
Gunny's gone.
We're not gonna make it out of here, are we, Joe?
I'm runnin' out of ammo here, Joe.
I don't wanna die in this shithole.
You're not gonna die.
Nobody else is gonna die.
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it out of here.
8th's caught out in the open.
We gotta call in the flyboys.
I'm gonna get that radio. Cover me.
He got the radio, Yahzee!
Cover me! I'm going!
Stay back!
Fuckers!
It won't bring your friends back.
What do you know about friends?
Get us some air support!
Bowie White, this is Carson Red, Arizona.
I say again, Carson Red, Arizona.
Coordinates!
Two-twenty, Mike, three-six.
All right, let's go.
We're gonna make it outta here.
Damn it, Joe.
Just get it over with.
Shut up, Ben.
Do it, Joe.
Do it!
No one else is gonna die, Ben.
No one else is dying.
Joe, we did it.
God...
God!
Oh, God... Oh, Joe...
We saved a lot of marines today.
Yeah, we did, Ben.
Charlie...
You know I didn't want to.
Right?
Hail... Hail Mary... full of grace... our... our Lord is with thee...
Holy Mary, mother of God... pray for us...
I got the last of 'em, Joe.
His name was Joe Enders... from South Philadelphia.
He was a fierce warrior.
A good marine.
If you ever tell a story about him,
George... say he was my friend.

/SubEdit b. 3946 (http://subedit. prv. pl)/
Is this chart at a reasonable height for you?
Or do you want it lowered?
- Fine.
- All right.
Earlier tonight...
Let me first ask the TV.
Are you ready?
All set?
Let me hear your voice level, so it's the same.
- How's my voice level?
- That's fine.
Terrific.
Now, I remember exactly the sentence I left off on.
I remember how it started, and I was cut off in the middle.
You can fix it up.
I don't want to go back, because
I know exactly what I wanted to say.
- Go ahead!
- Okay.
Any military commander who is honest with himself...
...or with those he's speaking to will admit...
...that he has made mistakes in the application of military power.
He's killed people, unnecessarily.
His own troops or other troops.
Through mistakes, through errors of judgment.
A hundred, or thousands, or tens of thousands, maybe even 100,000.
But he hasn't destroyed nations.
And the conventional wisdom is...
...don't make the same mistake twice.
Learn from your mistakes.
And we all do. Maybe we make the same mistake three times...
...but hopefully not four or five.
There'll be no learning period with nuclear weapons.
Make one mistake and you're gonna destroy nations.
In my life, I've been part of wars.
Three years in the U.S. Army during World War II.
Seven years as secretary of defense during the Vietnam War.
Thirteen years at the World Bank.
Across the world.
At my age, 85...
...I'm at an age where I can look back...
...and derive some conclusions about my actions.
My rule has been, "try to learn. "
Try to understand what happened.
Develop the lessons and pass them on.
This is the secretary of defense of the United States, Robert McNamara.
His department absorbs 10 percent of the income of this country...
...and over half of every tax dollar.
His job has been called the toughest in Washington...
...and he is the most controversial figure that has ever held the job.
Walter Lippmann calls him both the best secretary of defense...
...and the first one to ever assert civilian control over the military.
His critics call him a "con man,"
"an IBM machine with legs"...
..."an arrogant dictator. "
Mr. Secretary, I've noticed in several cabinet offices...
...that little silver calendar thing there.
Can you explain that?
Yes, this was given by President Kennedy.
...24, 25, 26, 27, and finally 28, were the dates...
...when we literally look ed down the gun barrel into nuclear war.
Under a cloak of deceit...
...the Soviet Union introduced nuclear missiles...
...into Cuba...
...targeting 90 million Americans.
The CIA said the warheads had not been delivered yet.
They thought 20 were coming on a ship named the Poltava.
We mobilized 180,000 troops.
The first day's air attack was planned at 1080 sorties...
...a huge air attack.
Kennedy was trying to keep us out of war.
I was trying to help him keep us out of war.
And General Curtis LeMay, whom I served under...
...as a matter of fact, in World War II, was saying:
" Let's go in.
Let's totally destroy Cuba. "
On that critical Saturday,
October 27th...
...we had two Khrushchev messages in front of us.
One had come in Friday night, and it had been dictated...
...by a man who was either drunk, or under tremendous stress.
Basically, he said, " If you'll guarantee you won't invade Cuba...
...we'll take the missiles out. "
Then, before we could respond, we had a second message...
...that had been dictated by a bunch of hard-liners.
And it said, in effect, " If you attack...
...we're prepared...
...to confront you with masses of military power. "
So, what to do? We had the soft message and the hard message.
At the elbow of President Kennedy was Tommy Thompson...
...former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow.
He and Jane, his wife, had lived with
Khrushchev and his wife on occasion.
Tommy Thompson said,
" Mr. President...
...I urge you to respond to the soft message. "
The president said to Tommy,
"We can't. That'll get us nowhere. "
Tommy said,
" Mr. President, you're wrong. "
Now, that takes a lot of guts.
In Thompson's mind was this thought:
" Khrushchev's gotten himself in a hell of a fix. "
He would then think to himself,
" My God...
...if I can get out of this with a deal that I can say to the Russian people:
'Kennedy was going to destroy
Castro and I prevented it. "'
Thompson, knowing Khrushchev as he did, thought:
" Khrushchev will accept that. "
And Thompson was right.
That's what I call empathy.
We must try to put ourselves inside their skin...
...and look at us through their eyes...
...just to understand the thoughts...
...that lie behind their decisions and their actions.
Khrushchev's advisors were saying:
"There can be no deal...
...unless you somewhat reduce the pressure on us...
...when you ask us to reduce the pressure on you. "
Also, we had attempted to invade Cuba.
Well, with the Bay of Pigs. That undoubtedly influenced their thinking.
I think that's correct.
But more importantly, from a Cuban and a Russian point of view...
...they knew what, in a sense,
I really didn't know.
We had attempted to assassinate Castro...
...under Eisenhower and Kennedy, and later, under Johnson.
And in addition to that, major voices in the U.S. Were calling for invasion.
In the first message,
Khrushchev said this:
"We and you ought not pull on the ends of a rope...
...which you have tied the knots of war.
Because the more the two of us pull...
...the tighter the knot will be tied.
And then it will be necessary to cut that knot...
...and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you.
I have participated in two wars and know that war ends...
...when it has rolled through cities and villages...
...everywhere sowing death and destruction.
For such is the logic of war.
If people do not display wisdom...
...they will clash like blind moles...
...and then mutual annihilation will commence. "
I want to say, and this is very important:
At the end, we lucked out.
It was luck that prevented nuclear war.
We came that close to nuclear war at the end.
Rational individuals.
Kennedy was rational.
Khrushchev was rational.
Castro was rational.
Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies.
And that danger exists today.
The major lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis is this:
The indefinite combination of human fallibility...
...and nuclear weapons will destroy nations.
Is it right and proper...
...that today there are 7500 strategic offensive nuclear warheads...
...of which 2500 are on 15-minute alert...
...to be launched by the decision of one human being?
It wasn't until January, 1992...
...in a meeting chaired by Castro in Havana, Cuba...
...that I learned
162 nuclear warheads...
...including 90 tactical warheads...
...were on the island at the time in this critical moment of the crisis.
I couldn't believe what I was hearing...
...and Castro got very angry with me, because I said:
" Mr. President, let's stop this meeting.
This is totally new to me.
I'm not sure I got the translation right. "
Mr. President,
I have three questions.
Number one, did you know the nuclear warheads were there?
Number two, if you did...
...would you have recommended to Khrushchev...
...in the face of a U.S. Attack, that he use them?
Three, if he had used them, what would've happened to Cuba?
He said, "One,
I knew they were there.
Two, I would not have recommended to Khrushchev.
I did recommend to Khrushchev they be used.
Three, what would happen to Cuba?
It would've been totally destroyed. "
That's how close we were.
And he was willing to accept that?
Yes... Oh, and he went on to say:
" Mr. McNamara, if you and President Kennedy...
...had been in a similar situation, that's what you would've done. "
I said, " Mr. President, I hope to God we would not have done it. "
Pull the temple down on our heads?
My God!
In a sense, we'd won.
We got the missiles out without war.
My deputy and I brought the five chiefs over...
...and we sat down with Kennedy.
And he said, "Gentlemen, we won.
I don't want you ever to say it, but you know we won, I know we won. "
And LeMay said,
"Won? Hell, we lost!
We should go in and wipe them out today. "
LeMay believed that ultimately...
...we'd confront these people with nuclear weapons.
And by God, we better do it when we have greater superiority...
...than we will have in the future.
At the time, we had a 17-to-1 strategic advantage in nuclear numbers.
We'd done 10 times as many tests as they had.
We were certain we could retain that advantage...
...if we limited the tests.
The chiefs were all opposed.
They said, "The Soviets will cheat. "
Well, I said, " How will they cheat?"
You won't believe this, but they said:
"They'll test them behind the moon. "
I said, "You're out of your mind. "
That's absurd.
It's almost impossible for our people today...
...to put themselves back into that period.
In my seven years as secretary...
...we came within a hairsbreadth of war with the Soviet Union...
...on three different occasions.
Twenty-four hours a day,
365 days a year...
...for seven years as secretary of defense, I lived the Cold War.
During the Kennedy administration, they designed a 100-megaton bomb.
It was tested in the atmosphere.
I remember this.
Cold War? Hell, it was a hot war.
I think the human race needs to think more about killing...
...about conflict.
Is that what we want in this 21st century?
My earliest memory is of a city exploding with joy.
It was November 11, 1918.
I was 2 years old.
You may not believe that I have the memory, but I do.
I remember the tops of the streetcars...
...being crowded with human beings...
...cheering and kissing and screaming.
End of World War I. We'd won.
But also celebrating the belief...
...of many Americans, particularly Woodrow Wilson...
...we'd fought a war to end all wars.
His dream was...
...that the world could avoid great wars in the future.
Disputes among great nations would be resolved.
I also remember...
...that I wasn't allowed to go outdoors to play with my friends...
...without wearing a mask.
There was an ungodly flu epidemic.
Large numbers of Americans were dying, 600,000.
And millions across the world.
My class in the first grade was housed in a shack, a wooden shack.
But we had an absolutely superb teacher.
And this teacher gave a test to the class every month...
...and she re- seated the class based on the results of that test.
There were vertical rows, and she put the person with the highest grade...
...in the first seat on the left-hand row.
And I worked my tail off to be in that first seat.
Now, the majority of the classmates were whites, Caucasians, so on.
Wasps, if you will.
But my competition for that first seat were Chinese, Japanese and Jews.
On Saturday and Sunday,
I played with my classmates.
They went to their ethnic schools.
They learned their native language.
They learned their culture, history.
And they came back determined on
Monday to beat that damn Irishman.
But they didn't do it very often.
One congressman called you "Mr.
L- Have-All-The-Answers McNamara. "
And there's been suggestion from some congressmen...
...that you come up there, in spite of their experience...
...prepared to give them lessons in things.
Is that your attitude?
No. Perhaps they don't know how much I don't know.
And there is much indeed.
I do make a serious effort...
...to prepare myself properly for these congressional discussions.
I suppose I spend, perhaps,
100 or 120 hours...
...in testifying before
Congress each year.
And each hour of testimony requires three to four hours of preparation.
What about the contention that your attitude is sometimes arrogant?
Have you ever been wrong, sir?
Oh, yes, indeed. My heavens.
I'm not gonna tell you when I've been wrong.
If you don't know,
I'm not going to tell you.
Oh, on countless occasions.
I applied to Stanford University.
I very much wanted to go.
But I couldn't afford it, so I lived at home and I went to Berkeley.
Fifty-two dollars a year tuition.
I started Berkeley at the bottom of the Depression.
Twenty-five million males were unemployed.
Out of that class of 3500...
...three elected to Phi Beta Kappa at the end of sophomore year.
Of those three, one became a Rhodes Scholar, I went to Harvard...
...the third went to work for $65 a month...
...and was damn happy to have the job.
The society was on the verge of...
...I don't want to say revolution...
...although, had Roosevelt not done some of the things he did...
...it could've become far more violent.
In any event, that was what I was thrown into.
I never heard of Plato and Aristotle...
...before I became a freshman at Berkeley.
And I remember the professor,
Lowenberg...
...the freshman philosophy professor...
I couldn't wait to go to another class.
I took more philosophy courses, particularly one in logic...
...and one in ethics.
Stress on values...
...something beyond one's self...
...and a responsibility to society.
After graduating
University of California...
...I went to Harvard Graduate School of Business for two years...
...and then I went back to San Francisco.
I began to court this young lady that
I'd met when we were 17...
...in our first week at Berkeley:
Margaret Craig.
And I was making some progress after eight or nine months.
I proposed and she accepted.
She went with her aunt and her mother on a trip across the country.
She telegraphed me,
" Must order engraved invitations...
...to include your middle name, what is it?"
I wired back,
" My middle name is Strange. "
She said,
" I know it's strange, but what is it?"
Well, I mean, it is Strange.
It's Robert Strange McNamara.
And it was a marriage made in heaven.
At the end of a year, we had our first child.
The delivery costs were $100, and we paid that $10 a month.
Those were some of the happiest days of our lives.
And then the war came.
I'd been promoted to assistant professor.
I was the youngest at Harvard.
And on a salary, by the way, of $4000 a year.
Harvard Business School's market was drying up.
The males were being drafted or volunteering.
So the dean, being farsighted, brought back a government contract...
...to establish an officer candidate school for what was called...
...Statistical Control in the Air Force.
We said, " Look, we're not gonna take anybody you send up here.
We're gonna select the people. "
You have a punch card for every human being...
...brought into the Air Corps.
We're gonna run those punch cards through the IBM sorting machines...
...and we're gonna sort on age, education, accomplishment...
...grades, et cetera.
We were looking for the best and the brightest.
The best brains, the greatest capacity to lead...
...the best judgment.
The U.S. Was just beginning to bomb.
We were bombing by daylight.
The loss rate was very, very high.
So they commissioned a study.
And what did we find?
We found the abort rate was 20 percent.
Twenty percent of the planes leaving England...
...to bomb Germany turned around before they got to the target.
That was a hell of a mess.
We lost 20 percent of our capability.
I think it was called Form 1-A...
...or something like that was a mission report.
And if you aborted a mission, you had to write down why.
So we get all these things and we analyze them...
...and we finally concluded:
It was baloney.
They were aborting out of fear.
Because the loss rate was four percent per sortie.
The combat tour was 25 sorties.
It didn't mean 100 percent would die...
...but a lot of them were gonna be killed. They knew that...
...and they found reasons to not go over the target.
So we reported this.
One of the commanders was Curtis LeMay.
Colonel in command of a B-24 group.
He was the finest combat commander of any service I came across in war.
But he was extraordinarily belligerent, many thought brutal.
He got the report.
He issued an order.
He said, " I will be in the lead plane on every mission.
Any plane that takes off will go over the target...
...or the crew will be court-martialed. "
The abort rate dropped overnight.
Now, that's the kind of a commander he was.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States.
My friends, on this Christmas Eve...
...there are over 10 million men...
...in the Armed Forces of the United States alone.
One year ago,
1, 700, 000 were serving overseas.
By next July first, that number will rise to over five million.
Plenty of bad news for the Japs in the not-too-far-distant future.
The U.S. Air Force had a new airplane, named the B-29.
The B-17 s and B-24s in Europe bombed from 15, 16,000 feet.
The problem was that they were subject to antiaircraft fire...
...and to fighter aircraft.
To relieve that, this B-29 was being developed...
...that bombed from high altitude...
...and it was thought we could destroy targets more efficiently and effectively.
I was brought back from the 8th Air Force...
...and assigned to the first B-29s, the 58th Bomb Wing.
We had to fly those planes from the bases in Kansas to India.
Then we had to fly fuel over the hump into China.
The airfields were built with Chinese labor.
It was an insane operation.
I can still remember them hauling these huge rollers...
...to crush the stone and make them flat.
Somebody would slip, the roller would roll over him...
...everybody would laugh and go on.
We were supposed to take these B-29s...
There were no tanker aircraft there.
We were to fill them with fuel...
...fly from India to Chengdu, offload the fuel, fly back to India...
...make enough missions to build up fuel in Chengdu...
...fly to Yawata, Japan, bomb the steel mills and go back to India.
We had so little training on this problem of maximizing efficiency...
...we actually found, to get some of the B-29s back...
...instead of offloading fuel, they had to take it on.
To make a long story short, it wasn't worth a damn.
And it was LeMay who really came to that conclusion and led the chiefs...
...to move the whole thing to the
Marianas, which devastated Japan.
LeMay was focused on only one thing:
Target destruction.
Most Air Force generals can say how many planes they had...
...how many tons of bombs they dropped, or whatever it was.
But he was the only person that I knew...
...in the senior command in the
Air Force who focused solely...
...on the loss of his crews per unit of target destruction.
I was on the island of Guam, in his command, in March of 1945.
In that single night, we burned to death...
...100,000 Japanese civilians in Tokyo.
Men, women and children.
Were you aware this was going to happen?
Well, I was...
...part of a mechanism that, in a sense, recommended it.
I analyzed bombing operations, and how to make them more efficient.
I.e., not more efficient in the sense of killing more...
...but more efficient in weakening the adversary.
I wrote one report analyzing...
...the efficiency of the B-29 operations.
The B-29 could get above the fighter aircraft and above the air defense...
...so the loss rate would be much less.
The problem was, the accuracy was also much less.
Now, I don't want to suggest that it was my report...
...that led to...
I'll call it the firebombing.
It isn't that I'm absolving myself of blame for the firebombing.
I don't want to suggest that it was I...
...that put in LeMay's mind...
...that his operations were totally inefficient...
...and had to be drastically changed.
But, anyhow, that's what he did.
He took the B-29s down to 5000 feet...
...and he decided to bomb with firebombs.
I participated in the interrogation...
...of the B-29 bomber crews that came back that night.
A room full of crewmen and intelligence interrogators.
A captain got up, a young captain said:
"Goddamn it, I'd like to know who the son of a bitch was...
...that took this magnificent airplane, designed to bomb from 23,000 feet...
...and he took it down to 5000 feet, and I lost my wingman.
He was shot and killed. "
LeMay spoke in monosyllables.
I never heard him say...
...more than two words in sequence.
It was basically, "Yes," " No," "Yep"...
..."That's all," or " Hell with it. "
That was all he said.
And LeMay was totally intolerant of criticism.
He never engaged in discussion with anybody.
He stood up.
"Why are we here?
Why are we here?
You lost your wingman.
It hurts me as much as...
...it does you.
I sent him there.
And I've been there,
I know what it is.
But you lost one wingman...
...and we destroyed Tokyo. "
Fifty square miles of Tokyo were burned.
Tokyo was a wooden city, and when we dropped firebombs...
...it just burned it.
The choice of incendiary bombs...
...where did that come from?
I think the issue...
...is not so much incendiary bombs.
I think the issue is...
...in order to win, should you kill
100,000 people in one night?
By firebombing or any other way?
LeMay's answer would be, clearly, "Yes. "
" McNamara, do you mean to say...
...that instead of killing 100,000...
...burning to death 100,000 Japanese civilians in that one night...
...we should have burned to death a lesser number or none?
And then had our soldiers cross the beaches in Tokyo...
...and been slaughtered in tens of thousands?
Is that what you're proposing?
Is that moral? Is that wise?"
Why was it necessary to drop the nuclear bomb...
...if LeMay was burning up Japan?
And he went on from Tokyo to firebomb other cities.
58 percent of Yokohama. Yokohama is roughly the size of Cleveland.
58 percent of Cleveland destroyed.
Tokyo is roughly the size of New York.
51 percent of New York destroyed.
99 percent of the equivalent of Chattanooga, which was Toyama.
40 percent of the equivalent of Los Angeles, which was Nagoya.
This was all done before...
...the dropping of the nuclear bomb.
Which, by the way, was dropped by LeMay's command.
Proportionality should be a guideline in war.
Killing 50 to 90 percent...
...of the people in 67 Japanese cities...
...and then bombing them with two nuclear bombs...
...is not proportional, in the minds of some people...
...to the objectives we were trying to achieve.
I don't fault Truman for dropping the nuclear bomb.
The U.S. -Japanese War was one of the most brutal wars...
...in all of human history.
Kamikaze pilots, suicide, unbelievable.
What one can criticize...
...is that the human race prior to that time and today...
...has not really grappled with what are, I'll call it "the rules of war. "
Was there a rule then that said you shouldn't bomb, shouldn't kill...
...shouldn't burn to death 100,000 civilians in a night?
LeMay said, " If we'd lost the war...
...we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals. "
And I think he's right.
He, and I'd say I...
...were behaving as war criminals.
LeMay recognized that what he was doing...
...would be thought immoral...
...if his side had lost.
But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?
At some point, we have to approach
Vietnam, and I want to know...
...how you can best set that up for me.
Yeah, well...
...that's a hard, hard question.
I think...
I think we have to approach it in the context of the Cold War.
But first I'll have to talk about Ford.
I've got to go back to the end of the war.
I had a terrible headache...
...so Marg drove me in to the Air Force regional hospital.
A week later, Marg came in...
...many of the same symptoms.
It's hard to believe, and I don't think
I've heard of another case...
...where two individuals, husband and wife...
...came down, essentially, at the same time with polio.
We were both in the hospital on V-J Day.
A friend of mine said:
"We're gonna find a corporation in America that needs...
...the advice and capabilities of this extraordinary group...
...I'm forming and you gotta be in it. "
I said, "To hell with it.
I'm going back to Harvard.
Marg and I wanna do that.
I'm gonna spend my life there. "
He said, " Look, Bob, you can't pay Marg's hospital bills.
You're crazy as hell. "
He said, " By the way...
...the company that most needs our help in all the U.S. Is Ford. "
I said, " How'd you learn that?"
" I read an article in Life magazine. "
Of the top 1000 executives at Ford...
...I don't believe there were
10 college graduates...
...and Henry Ford II needed help.
They were gonna give us tests.
Two full days of testing...
...intelligence tests, achievement tests, personality tests, you name it.
This sounds absurd, but I remember a question on one of the tests was:
"Would you rather be a florist or a coal miner?"
I had been a florist.
I worked as a florist...
...during some of my
Christmas vacations.
I put down coal miner.
I think the reasons are obvious to you.
This group of 10 people had been trained...
...in the officer candidate school at Harvard.
In some tests we had the highest marks that had ever been scored.
In other tests, we were in the upper one percentile.
From 1926 to 1946, including the war years...
...Ford Motor Company just barely broke even.
It was a God-awful mess.
I thought we had a responsibility to the stockholders...
...and God knows you cannot believe how bad the situation had been.
They had no market research organization. I set one up.
Manager said,
"What do you want studied?"
I said, " Find out who's buying Volkswagens.
Everybody says it's a no-good car.
It was only selling about
20,000 a year...
...but I want to know what's gonna happen.
Is it gonna stay the same, go down, or go up?
Find out who buys them. "
He came back six months later, he said:
"Well, they're professors, and they're doctors and they're lawyers...
...and they're obviously people who can afford more. "
Well, that set me to thinking about what we in the industry should do.
Was there a market we were missing?
At this time nobody believed
Americans wanted cheaper cars.
They wanted conspicuous consumption.
Cadillac, with these huge, ostentatious fins...
...set the style for the industry for 10 or 15 years.
And that's what we were up against.
We introduced the Falcon as a more economical car...
...and it was a huge success profit-wise.
We accomplished a lot.
I said, "What about accidents?
I hear a lot about accidents. "
"Oh, yes, we'll get you some data on that. "
There were about 40,000 deaths per year from automobile accidents...
...and about a million, or a million-two injuries.
I said, "What causes it?"
" It's obvious.
It's human error and mechanical failure. "
I said, " If it's mechanical, we might be involved. Find out.
If it's mechanical failure,
I want to stop it. "
Well, he said, "There's really very few statistics available. "
I said, " Damn it, find out what can we learn. "
"The only place we can find that knows anything about it...
...is Cornell Aeronautical Labs. "
They said,
"The major problem is packaging. "
They said, "You buy eggs and you know how eggs come in a carton?"
I said, " I don't buy eggs.
My wife does it. "
They said, "Well, you ask her, when she puts that carton down...
...on the drain board when she gets home, do the eggs break?"
I asked Marg and she said no.
Cornell said, "That's because they're packaged properly.
Now, if we packaged people in cars the same way...
...we could reduce the breakage. "
We lacked lab facilities, so we dropped human skulls...
...in different packages, down the stairwells of the dormitories at Cornell.
Well, that sounds absurd, but that guy was absolutely right.
It was packaging which could make the difference.
In a crash, the driver was often impaled on the steering wheel.
The passenger was often injured because he'd hit the windshield...
...or the header bar, or the instrument panel.
So in the 1956 model Ford we introduced steering wheels...
...that prevented being impaled.
We introduced...
...padded instrument panels, and we introduced seat belts.
We estimated if there would be
100 percent use of the seat belts...
...we could save 20-odd thousand lives a year.
Everybody was opposed to it.
You couldn't get people to use seat belts.
But those who did saved their lives.
Now, let me jump ahead.
It's July, 1960.
John Bugas, vice president, industrial relations...
...clearly had his eyes on becoming president.
I'm the group vice president in charge of all of the car divisions.
Henry was a night owl.
He always wanted to go out.
You know, it's 2 a. m. Or something.
He said, " Come up, have a nightcap. "
" I don't want one, I'm going to bed. "
John said, " I'll come up, Henry. "
" I didn't ask you. I asked Bob. "
He said, " Bob, come on up. "
So I finally went up.
That's when he asked me to be president.
I was the first president in the history of the company...
...that had ever been president other than a member of the Ford family.
And after five weeks, I quit.
The telephone rang...
...a person comes on and says:
" I'm Robert Kennedy.
My brother, Jack Kennedy, would like you...
...to meet our brother- in-law,
Sergeant Shriver. "
Four o'clock, Sarge comes in.
Never met him.
And he said, " I've been authorized by my brother- in-law...
...Jack Kennedy, to offer you the position of secretary of the treasury. "
"You're crazy.
I know a little about finance...
...but I'm not qualified for that position. "
"Anticipating you might say that, the president-elect...
...authorized me to offer you the secretary of defense. "
" I was in World War II for three years...
...but secretary of defense?
I'm not qualified for that. "
He said, "Anticipating that...
...would you do him the courtesy of agreeing to meet with him?"
So I go home. I meet with Marg.
If I could appoint every senior official in the department...
...and if I was guaranteed
I wouldn't have to...
...be part of that damn Washington social world.
She said, "Well, okay, why don't you write a contract with the president...
...and if he'll accept those conditions, do it. "
My total net worth at the time was on the order of $800,000...
...but I had huge unfulfilled stock options worth millions.
And I was one of the highest-paid executives in the world.
And the future was brilliant.
We had called our children in.
Their life would be totally changed.
The salary of a cabinet secretary then was $25,000 a year.
So we explained to the children...
...they'd be giving up a few...
They could care less.
Marg could care less.
It was snowing.
The Secret Service took me in the house by the back way.
I can still see it. There's a loveseat...
...two armchairs with a lamp table in between.
Jack Kennedy is sitting in one...
...and Bobby Kennedy's sitting in the other.
" Mr. President, it's absurd.
I'm not qualified. "
" Look, Bob... "
He said, " I don't think there's any school for presidents either.
Let's announce it now.
I'll write the announcement. "
So he wrote out the announcement, we walk out the front door.
All of these television cameras and press, till hell wouldn't have it.
That's how Marg learned
I had accepted.
It was on television, live.
All right, why don't we do some pictures afterwards.
I've asked Robert McNamara...
...to assume the responsibilities of secretary of defense.
And I'm glad and happy to say that he has accepted this responsibility.
Mr. McNamara leaves the presidency of the Ford company...
...at great personal sacrifice.
That's the way it began.
You know, it was a traumatic period.
My wife probably got ulcers from it...
...may even ultimately have died from the stress. My son got ulcers.
It was very traumatic but...
...they were some of the best years of our life...
...and all members of my family benefited from it.
It was terrific.
October 2nd.
I had returned from Vietnam.
At that time, we had 16,000 military advisors.
I recommended to President Kennedy and to the Security Council...
...that we establish a plan and an objective...
...of removing all of them within two years.
Kennedy announced we were going to pull out all our military advisors...
...by the end of '65, going to take 1000 out at the end of '63, and we did.
But there was a coup in South Vietnam.
Diem was overthrown...
...and he and his brother were killed.
I was present with the President...
...when together we received information of that coup.
I've never seen him...
...more upset.
He totally blanched.
Kennedy and I had tremendous problems with Diem, but my God...
...he was the authority.
He was the head of state.
And he was overthrown by a military coup.
And Kennedy knew and I knew, that to some degree...
...the U.S. Government was responsible for that.
I was in my office in the Pentagon...
...when the telephone rang and it was Bobby.
The President had been shot in Dallas.
Perhaps 45 minutes later,
Bobby called again...
...and said the president was dead.
Jackie would like me to come out to the hospital.
We took the body to the White House about whatever it was, 4 a. M...
...and called the superintendent of Arlington Cemetery.
And he and I...
...walked over those grounds.
They're hauntingly beautiful grounds.
White crosses, row and row.
And finally I thought I'd found the exact spot...
...the most beautiful spot in the cemetery.
I called Jackie at the White House...
...and asked her to come out there.
She immediately accepted.
And that's where the president is buried today.
A park service ranger came up to me and said that he...
He had...
...escorted President Kennedy on a tour of those grounds...
...a few weeks before.
And Kennedy said...
...that was the most beautiful spot in Washington.
That's where he's buried.
I will do my best.
That is all I can do.
I ask for your help...
...and God's.
Make no bones of this.
Don't try to sweep this under the rug.
We are at war in Vietnam.
And yet the president...
...and his secretary of defense continues to mislead...
...and misinform the American people, and enough of it's gone by.
On August 2nd...
...the destroyer Maddox reported it was attacked...
...by a North Vietnamese patrol boat.
It was an act of aggression against us.
We were in international waters.
I sent officials from the Defense
Department out and we recovered...
...pieces of shells that were clearly identified...
...as North Vietnamese from the Maddox's deck.
So there was no question in my mind that it had occurred.
But, in any event, we didn't respond.
And it was very difficult.
It was difficult for the president.
There were very, very senior people, in uniform and out, who said:
" My God, this president is... "
They didn't use the word "coward," but in effect...
..." He's not protecting the national interest. "
Two days later the Maddox and the Turner Joy, two destroyers...
...reported they were attacked.
There were sonar soundings.
Torpedoes had been detected.
Other indications of attack from patrol boats.
We spent 10 hours that day trying to find out what the hell had happened.
At one point the commander said,
"We're not certain of the attack. "
Another point they said,
"We're positive. "
Then finally, late in the day,
Admiral Sharp said:
"Yes, we're certain it happened. "
So I reported this to Johnson, and as a result...
...there were bombing attacks on targets in North Vietnam.
Johnson said,
"We may have to escalate.
I'm not gonna do it without
Congressional authority. "
And he put forward a resolution, the language of which...
...gave complete authority to the president to take the nation to war:
The Tonkin Gulf Resolution.
Now, let me go back to the August 4th attack.
It was just confusion.
And events afterwards showed...
...that our judgment that we'd been attacked that day was wrong.
It didn't happen.
And the judgment that we'd been attacked on August 2nd...
...which we'd made, was right.
We had been.
Although that was disputed at the time.
So we were right once and wrong once.
Ultimately, President Johnson authorized bombing in response...
...to what he thought had been the second attack.
It hadn't occurred, but that's irrelevant to the point I'm making here.
He authorized the attack on the assumption it had occurred.
And his belief that it was a conscious decision...
...by the North Vietnamese political and military leaders...
...to escalate the conflict...
...and an indication they would not stop short of winning.
We were wrong.
But we had in our minds a mindset that led to that action.
And it carried such heavy costs.
We see incorrectly, or we see only half of the story at times.
- We see what we want to believe.
- You're absolutely right.
Belief and seeing.
They're both often wrong.
We Americans know, although others appear to forget...
...the risk of spreading conflict.
We still seek no wider war.
We introduced " Rolling Thunder"...
...which, over the years, became a very, very heavy bombing program.
Two to three times as many bombs as were dropped...
...on Western Europe during all of World War II.
This is not primarily a military problem.
It's a battle for the hearts and minds of the people of South Vietnam.
As a prerequisite, we must be able to guarantee their physical security.
It was announced today that total
American casualties in Vietnam...
...now number 4877 including 748 killed.
Secretary of Defense McNamara, on each of his seven trips to Vietnam...
...has found some positive aspect of the course of the war.
The most vivid impression
I'm bringing back is...
...that we've stopped losing the war.
The North Vietnamese, we believe, have nine regiments of their army...
Some of the men had a little training in a park in Kentucky before coming.
But it didn't prepare them for thick et of trees, spiked vines, thorn bushes...
...almost perpendicular cliffs,
90-degree temperatures, insects...
This has changed from a nasty little war to a nasty middle-sized war.
The Vietnamese are still doing most of the fighting and most of the dying...
...but week after week,
American casualty figures go up.
Now, America wins the wars that she undertakes. Make no mistake about it.
And we have declared war on tyranny and aggression.
If this little nation goes down the drain and can't maintain independence...
...ask yourself what's gonna happen to all the other little nations.
Let me go back one moment.
In the Cuban Missile Crisis, at the end...
...I think we did put ourselves in the skin of the Soviets.
In the case of Vietnam, we didn't know them well enough to empathize.
And there was total misunderstanding as a result.
They believed we had simply replaced the French as a colonial power...
...and we were seeking to subject
South and North Vietnam...
...to our colonial interests, which was absolutely absurd.
And we, we saw Vietnam as an element of the Cold War.
Not what they saw it as, a civil war.
There aren't many examples...
...in which you bring two former enemies together...
...at the highest levels, and discuss what might have been.
I formed the hypothesis that each of us could have...
...achieved our objectives without the terrible loss of life.
And I wanted to test that by going to Vietnam.
The former foreign minister of Vietnam...
...a wonderful man named Thach said, "You're totally wrong.
We were fighting for independence.
You were fighting to enslave us. "
We almost came to blows.
That was noon on the first day.
" Do you mean to say it was not a tragedy for you...
...when you lost 3,400,000
Vietnamese killed...
...which on our population base is the equivalent of 27 million Americans?
What did you accomplish?
You didn't get more than we were willing to give at the start.
You could've had the whole damn thing: Independence, unification. "
" Mr. McNamara, you must never have read a history book.
If you had, you'd know we weren't pawns of the Chinese or the Russians.
Didn't you know that?
Don't you understand that we've been fighting the Chinese for 1000 years?
We were fighting for independence, and we'd fight to the last man.
We were determined to...
...and no amount of bombing or U.S.
Pressure would've ever stopped us. "
What makes us omniscient?
Have we a record of omniscience?
We are the strongest nation in the world today.
I do not believe we should ever...
...apply that economic, political or military power unilaterally.
If we had followed that rule in Vietnam, we wouldn't have been there.
None of our allies supported us.
Not Japan, not Germany, not Britain or France.
If we can't persuade nations with comparable values...
...of the merit of our cause, we'd better re- examine our reasoning.
Americans suffered the heaviest casualties of the war last week.
543 killed in action. Another 1247 were wounded and hospitalized.
The deaths raise the U.S. Total in the war so far to 18, 239.
South Vietnamese put their losses for the week at 522 killed.
Communist losses were not reported.
Contributing to those casualties has been the Communist bombardment...
...of the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh.
There, the North Vietnamese have been tightening their ring around...
The military expects a full-scale assault.
To what extent did you feel that you were the author of stuff...
...or that you were an instrument of things outside of your control?
Well, I don't think I felt either.
I just felt that I was serving at the request of a president...
...who'd been elected by the American people.
And it was my responsibility to try to help him...
...to carry out the office as he believed was in the interest of our people.
What is morally appropriate in a wartime environment?
Let me give you an illustration.
While I was secretary...
...we used what's called
"Agent Orange" in Vietnam.
A chemical that strips leaves off of trees.
After the war, it is claimed that that was a toxic chemical...
...and it killed many individuals...
...soldiers and civilians exposed to it.
Were those who issued the approval to use Agent Orange criminals?
Were they committing a crime against humanity?
Let's look at the law.
Now, what kind of law do we have that says...
...these chemicals are acceptable in war and these chemicals are not.
We don't have clear definitions of that kind.
I never in the world would have authorized an illegal action.
I'm not really sure I authorized
Agent Orange, I don't remember it.
But it certainly occurred, the use of it occurred while I was secretary.
Norman Morrison was a Quaker.
He was opposed to war, the violence of war, the killing.
He came to the Pentagon, doused himself with gasoline.
Burned himself to death below my office.
He held a child in his arms, his daughter.
Passers-by shouted, "Save the child!"
He threw the child...
...out of his arms, and the child lived and is alive today.
His wife issued a very moving statement:
" Human beings must stop killing other human beings. "
And that's a belief that I shared.
I shared it then and I believe it even more strongly today.
How much evil must we do in order to do good?
We have certain ideals, certain responsibilities.
Recognize that at times you will have to engage in evil, but minimize it.
I remember reading that
General Sherman, in the Civil War...
...the mayor of Atlanta pleaded with him to save the city.
And Sherman essentially said to the mayor...
...just before he torched it and burned it down:
"War is cruel. War is cruelty. "
That was the way LeMay felt.
He was trying to save the country.
He was trying to save our nation.
And in the process, he was prepared to do whatever killing was necessary.
It's a very, very difficult position for sensitive human beings to be in.
Morrison was one of those.
I think I was.
50,000 people came to Washington to demonstrate against the war.
About 20,000 of them marched on the Pentagon.
The Pentagon is a very, very difficult building to defend.
We placed troops carrying rifles around it.
U.S. Marshals in front of the soldiers.
But I told the president, not a rifle would be loaded...
...without my personal permission.
And I wasn't gonna grant it.
What effect did all of this dissent have on your thinking?
I mean, Norman Morrison is '65.
This is '67.
Well, it was a very tense period.
Very tense period for my family, which I don't want to discuss.
How was your thinking changing during this period?
I don't think my thinking was changing.
We were in the Cold War.
And this was a Cold War...
...activity.
Some commentators have said the war is turning into a kind of stalemate.
No, no. I think on the contrary...
...as General Westmoreland has pointed out...
...in recent weeks in Saigon, the military operations...
...the large-unit military operations continue to...
...show very substantial progress.
One of the lessons I learned early on:
Never say never.
Never, never, never.
Never say never.
And secondly...
...never answer the question that is asked of you.
Answer the question that you wish had been asked of you.
And quite frankly, I follow that rule.
It's a very good rule.
When you talk about the responsibility for something like the Vietnam War...
...whose responsibility is it?
It's the president's responsibility.
I don't want to fail to recognize...
...the tremendous contribution
I think Johnson made to the country.
I don't want to put the responsibility for Vietnam on his shoulders alone...
...but I do... I am inclined to believe that if Kennedy had lived...
...he would've made a difference. We wouldn't have had 500,000 men there.
Two very telling photographs.
One of them has Johnson like this:
You can just see him thinking,
" My God, I'm in a hell of a mess.
And this guy is trying to tell me to do something...
...that I know is wrong and I'm not gonna do.
But how the hell am I gonna get out of this?"
The other photograph, you can see me saying:
"Jesus Christ. I love this man,
I respect him, but he's totally wrong.
What am I gonna do?"
Johnson couldn't persuade me, and I couldn't persuade him.
I had this enormous respect and affection, loyalty...
...to both Kennedy and Johnson.
But at the end, Johnson and I found ourselves poles apart.
And I said to a very close and dear friend of mine, Kay Graham...
" Even to this day, Kay, I don't know whether I quit or was fired. "
She said, "You're out of your mind.
You were fired. "
November 1, 1967.
I presented a memo to Johnson that said:
"The course we're on is totally wrong.
We've gotta change it.
Cut back at what we're doing in Vietnam.
We gotta reduce the casualties," and so on.
It was an extraordinarily controversial memo.
And I took it to him.
I delivered it myself.
" Mr. President, nobody has seen this.
Not Dean Rusk, not the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Nobody. "
" I know that it may contain recommendations and statements...
...that you do not agree with or support. "
I never heard from him.
Something had to give.
There was a rumor I was facing a mental breakdown...
...I was under such pressure and stress.
I don't think that was the case at all.
But it was a really traumatic departure.
That's the way it ended.
Except for one thing.
He awarded me the Medal of Freedom...
...in a very beautiful ceremony at the White House.
And he was very, very warm in his comments.
And I became so emotional,
I could not...
...respond.
Mr. President...
...I cannot find words...
...to express what lies in my heart today.
And I think I'd better respond on another occasion.
And had I responded,
I would have said:
" I know what many of you are thinking.
You're thinking this man is duplicitous.
You're thinking that he has held things close to his chest.
You're thinking that...
...he did not respond fully...
...to the desires and wishes of the American people.
I wanna tell you you're wrong. "
Of course he had personal idiosyncrasies.
No question about that.
He didn't accept all the advice he was given.
On several occasions, his associates advised him to be more forthcoming.
He wasn't.
People did not understand there were recommendations and pressures...
...that would carry the risk of war with China and of nuclear war.
And he was determined to prevent it.
I'm arguing that he had a reason in his mind for doing what he did.
And, of course, shortly after I left...
...Johnson concluded that he couldn't continue.
At this point, how many Americans had been killed in Vietnam?
About 25,000. Less than half...
...of the number ultimately killed, 58,000.
Historians don't really like to deal with counterfactuals...
...with what might have been.
They want to talk about history.
" How the hell do you know,
McNamara, what might have been?
Who knows?"
Well, I know certain things.
What I'm doing is thinking it through with hindsight.
But you don't have hindsight available at the time.
I'm very proud of my accomplishments.
And I'm very sorry that in the process of accomplishment, I've made errors.
We all make mistakes.
We know we make mistakes.
I don't know any military commander who is honest...
...who would say he has not made a mistake.
There's a wonderful phrase:
"The fog of war. "
What "the fog of war" means is:
War is so complex it's beyond the ability of the human mind...
...to comprehend all the variables.
Our judgment, our understanding, are not adequate.
And we kill people unnecessarily.
Wilson said,
"We won the war to end all wars. "
I'm not so naive or simplistic to believe we can eliminate war.
We're not gonna change human nature any time soon.
It isn't that we aren't rational.
We are rational.
But reason has limits.
There's a quote from T.S. Eliot that I just love:
"We shall not cease from exploring...
...and at the end of our exploration, we will return to where we started...
...and know the place for the first time. "
Now that's, in a sense, where I'm beginning to be.
After you left the Johnson administration...
...why didn't you speak out against the Vietnam War?
I'm not going to say any more than I have.
These are the kinds of questions that get me in trouble.
You don't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear.
A lot of people misunderstand the war...
...misunderstand me.
A lot of people think
I'm a son of a bitch.
Do you feel in any way responsible for the war?
Do you feel guilty?
I don't want to go into further discussion.
It just opens up more controversy.
I don't wanna add anything to Vietnam.
It is so complex that anything I say...
...will require additions and qualifications.
Is it the feeling that you're damned if you do...
...and if you don't, no matter what...?
Yeah, that's right.
And I would rather be damned if I don't.

No son, never.
The blood stays on the blade.
One day you'll understand.
Some of it I have remembered.
And the rest I took from dreams.
St. Michael the Archangel defend us in battle.
Be our protector.
Against the snares. And the wickedness of the devil.
Now son, who's that?
St. Michael.
Who is it?
St. Michael.
And what did he do?
He cast Satan out of Paradse.
Good boy!
Johnny!
What's the battle?
Natives against the
Dead Rabbits.
Which are you?
What do you think?
Dead Rabbits!
Well,well, Monk!
Are you with us or not?
For the last time Vallon, only if the money is right.
I'll give you 10 per notch.
You have my word.
10 per notch. Per new notch.
Then I'm your man.
Is this it, Priest?
The Pope's new army?
A few crusty bitches and a handful of ragtags!
I know Bill. You swore, this was a battle between warriors.
Not a bunch of Miss Nancy's.
So warriors is what I brought.
The O'Connell Guard!
The Plug Uglies!
The Shirt Tails!
The Chichesters!
The Forty Thieves!
Bene.
On my challenge, by the ancient laws of combat...
...we are met at this chosen ground...
...to settle for good and all...
...who holds sway, over the Five Points.
Us Natives, born rightwise to this fine land....
...or the foreign hordes defiling it!
Under the ancient laws of combat
I accept the challenge of the so called Natives.
You plague our people at every turn!
But from this day out, you shall plague us no more!
Let it be known, that the hand that tries to strike us from this land...
...shall be swiflty cut down!
Then may the Christian Lord, guide my hand, against your Roman popery!
Prepare to receive the true Lord!
Priest!
Look at me!
Who is this under my knife?
Father, get up! Get up!
Where are you?
Where are you?
No, my son.
Don't never look away!
Soon be over, Priest.
Finish it!
You may need this to cross the river.
Ears and noses will be the trophies of the day.
But no hand shall touch him!
No hand shall touch him!
He'll cross over whole!
In honour!
Not before I get what's owed!
No!
It's fair. A touch indelicate, but fair.
My sympathies.
What shall we do with the boy?
Look at me.
Give him to the law.
See he gets a good education.
Okay, boss. Say goodbye to your father.
Hey. Take it easy!
Hurry! Come in here!
Come here, boy. You're going to Hell's Gate!
There he is!
Get him!
Priest Vallon died a noble death.
But his Dead Rabbits is done and outlawed.
Let no one even speak their name from now on.
In this place, you've grown from a boy into a man.
Put to death the earthly things in you.
Immorality. Impurity.
Passion. Vengeance.
The Lord has forgiven you.
You also must forgive.
You go forth to a country torn apart by civil strife.
Thank you, Reverend.
Lend your hand to the work that yet remains.
That this war may end.
And the plague of slavery, that brought this confergration down upon us  ...
...vanish forever from the earth.
In the second year of the great civil war...
...when the irish brigades marched through the streets...
...New york was a city full of tribes.
War chiefs. Rich and poor.
Lincoln will make all white men slaves!
It wasn't a city really.
It was more a furnace.
Where cities someday might be forged.
That's the spirit boys.
Go off and die for your blackie friends.
We should have run a better man against
Lincoln when we had the chance.
They are trying to say ,we are no different than niggers.
You ain't.
Go back to Africa, niggers!
The angriest talk was of the new conscription act.
The first draft in Union history.
Join the army lads. Three square meals a day and good pay.
When the Irish came, the city was in a fever.
Since the time of the great famine they'd come streaming off the boats.
And they got a right warm welcome.
Go back to Ireland, you dumb Mick!
You'll remember that!
Get back on the boat, Paddy!
I came only 2 hours down river from Hell Gate...
..but they all took me for an immigrant.
Why not?
There were a 1000 different accents in New York..
..and to the Natives you see, they were all the same.
Come here to take the chill off your soul and the weight off your heart.
Welcome to America son, your long arduous journey is over.
Go back to your own country.
Vote Tammany!
America for Americans!
New York loved William
Tweed and hated him.
And those of us trying to be thieves....
...we couldn't help but admire him.
Mr. Cutting. Gentlemen.
Thank you for coming.
It's an honour.
Mr. Tweed?
Sir! Please! Excuse me?
I think your're frightening them.
So?
Don't mind him, he used to be an Irishman.
The Five Points!
Murderer's Alley. Brickbat Mansion.
The Gates of hell!
In this wild place....
Look upon the face of this poor child.
She lives in squalor, in this godforsaken den of vice and misery behind me.
Every year the Reformers came.
Every year the Points got worse.
As if it liked being dirty.
Where am I going to go?
Move.
The Reverend wants you out of here.
You may or not know Bill, that every day I go down to the waterfront...
...with hot soup for the Irish as they come on shore.
As part of building a political base.
I've noticed you there.
You may have noticed me?
Indeed I have!
Throwing torrents of favours and withering abuse on every person who step off those boats.
If only I had the guns Mr. Tweed...
...I'd shoot each and everyone of them, before they set foot on American soil.
Mulbeery street and Worth. Cross.
Orange and Littlewater.
Each of the Five Points is a finger...
...when I close my hand it becomes a fist.
And any time that I wish, I can turn it against you.
I understand. But we're talking about different things.
I'm talking about civic duty.
Responsibilites we owe to the people.
Schools and hospitals. Sewers and utilities.
Street construction, repairs and sweeping. Business and saloon licences...
St. Michael the Archangel...
Defend us in battle.
Be our protector against the snares and the wickedness of the devil.
Streetcars, ferries, rubbish disposal.
There's a power of money to be made in this city, Bill.
With your help, the people must be made to understand...
...that all these things are best kept, in what I like to call the
Tammany family.
That is why I am talking about an alliance between our organisations.
You're talking about muscle work.
That too. Muscle to match our spirit.
You own the crushers, get them to do it.
The police? Oh, no! Jezus,no!
The appearance of the law must be upheld.
Especially while it's been broken.
Give me the strength, for what I must do.
Who are you?
I said, who are you?
What are you doing here?
I just like it down here is all.
See what's in his pockets,
Jimmy.
Now look, boys. I really don't want to fight.
You don't want to fight?
Don't worry, son. Ain't gonna be much of a fight.
Don't kill me.
Where did you get that?
I told you I didn't want to fight!
Why not?
Look how good you done.
You're the priest's son aren't you?
You! Get away from me.
You understand?
You don't remember me, do you?
I was the one tried to help you.
What?
I was the one tried to help you.
When the Natives took you.
That was you?
Yeah. I thought you was killed.
They just locked me up
You know that.
This long?
I kept trying to escape, you know.
Did more time for that.
So what are you doing back here?
Guess I missed the place.
Bowery boys.
The Five Points.
Paradise square!
The streets here are always livelier in the evening.
Who are the gangs around now?
We got the Daybreak boys and the Swamp Angels.
They work the River
Luton ships.
The Frog Haulers shanghai sailors down around the bay.
Shortails were rough for awhile, but they became a bunch of jackrolling dandies.
Lolling around Murderer's Alley looking like Chinamen.
Hellcat Maggie she tried to open up her own grog shop.
But she drunk up all her own liquor and got thrown out on the street.
Now she's on the lay for everything.
The Plug Uglies they're from somewhere in the old country.
They got their own language.
No one understands what they're saying.
They love to fight the cops.
And the Nightwalkers and Ratpickers.
They work on their backs and kill with their hands.
They're so scurvy, only the
Plug Uglies...
...will talk with them.
But who knows what they're saying.
The Slaughterhouses and the
Broadway Twisters are a fine bunch of Bengal boys!
And the little  Forty Thieves.
I used to run with them for a while.
Till they got taken over by
Benjer the Cockroach and his red eyed buggers.
Benjer is a germ.
If you try to leave the gang, they say...
...he hacks the blood off you.
The righteousness are nothing but a bunch of repetitious grab ups..
The True Blue Americans call themselves a gang...
...but all they really do is stand around on corners damning Engeland.
Do you believe one word that the British say...?
Anything about the sand of the Dead Rabbits?
You don't say that name!
That name died with your...
It's been outlawed.
When I was in the blockhouse, the chinks told me...
...that the Natives celebrate their victory...
....every year.
Is that true?
Aye, that they do.
It's quite a fair.
The Butcher himself has got to invite you...
...or you don't go.
Look where you are going, Johnny!
You look stunned and poorly, sir!
Quite a pair of conversationists aren't you!
Maybe not. We're deep thinkers.
Gentlemen, I leave you in the grace and favour of the Lord!
Jenny, finest bludget in all the Points.
She is a prim looking star gazer!
But I'd check my pockets if I were you.
Because I do believe she lifted your time piece.
I let her take it.
I let here take things all the time.
Is that right?
Yeah.
We always liked a good fire in the Points.
You generally pick up a swag and if the cops came along...
...you really got a show.
The municipal police fought the metropolitan police.
The metropolitan police fought the streetgangs.
Hurry up before the Black
Joke get here!
There were 37 amateur fire- brigades.
They all fought each other.
The Black Joke are on their way!
Okay boys, get the hoses!
It's the Black Joke!
Go get 'm boys!
Give those Bowery boys help!
Quick before there's nothing left!
Go back to the Bowery, ya bum!
For gods sake. They're taking everything!
In your next time of trouble ma'm....
...call Tammany first!
It's not too late. You can still save my house!
Let's go!
I thought you said you were hungry!
Grab what you can. Let's get out of here!
May I point out that this building is burning to ashes?
And may I point out that this area is the provenance...
..of my own America's firebrigade.
And that you lot only belong in the Bowery.
May I point out that you are outmanned, outmanouvered...
...and at the moment outfought!
Am I?
There's the Black Joke!
Let's get 'm!
Clear the way for
Bill the Butcher.
Okay boys, to work!
What's the point?
The fire's near burnt eveything of value inside.
Boys forget that one.
Next building over.
Mustn't let it spread!
Grab what you want from that one!
What are you doing? There's nothing wrong with this one!
Come on. Johnny. Get up!
Leave that.
You two, on your way!
His name's Amsterdam.
How's the beak?
Ain't so bad.
You. You got anything or you can get out.
Is that it?
That's it.
Right. Here's the rake.
Everything comes here we fence it.
Johnny takes our tribute to the
Natives and we chop up....
....the winnings, each to his equal portion of the gang.
Does that meet with your approval, Hell Gate?
My approval?
What's the matter Jack Sprat, can't you think for yourself!
I'll slit your fucking throat!
You boys settle with me, before settling with each other.
I come for my due and proper.
This ain't a bad haul.
You know, when the folks say the country is going to hell...
...I always tell them, look at all the hard work...
..our fine young lads are doing down in the Points.
Oh, yeah. This is just the thing for Mrs. Mulraney.
Alright Happy Jack. Leave us for something to give Bill de Butcher.
Would ya?
Not my favorite tune.
Thank you, boys.
You keep out of trouble now.
Every year the Natives celebrated the killing of my father all over again.
At Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda in Mott street.
The chinks hated the Natives worse than we did.
The drum rolls and the Butcher drinks a glass of fire.
When you kill a king, you don't stab him in the dark.
You kill him where the whole court can watch him die.
Got any timber?
Hi, Maggie. Rightie or leftie?
Give us a drink.
Help yourself.
Two minutes. Place your bets.
Gentlemen. The match is due to commence.
The count to be is,
25 rodents in 3 minutes.
Rouser against the vermin.
Satisfied?
Yes!
Where are you going, boil?
I'm here to pay tribute to Bill.
Are you now?
Give it to me. I'll give it to him.
No thanks. I'll give it to him myself.
What do you want to keep, the money or your teeth?
John?
Welcome.
From me and the lads, sir.
Mate of yours?
Where's he from?
He's not from here, sir.
YOU!
That's close enough!
Your friend can't look me in the eye...
...that's not an admirable characteristic.
No one can look you in the eye, Bill..
...not when you're playing cards.
This is whist, it's a gentleman's game.
Make a gentleman's bet.
I am betting large, Bill!
That ain't large.
Don't make that noise again, Harvey.
I like a man who's willing to burn for his swag.
How do you fair on water?
Come closer.
Closer. I ain't gonna bite!
There's a Portugese ship lying low in the harbour....
...quarantined three weeks.
Get there before the Day Break
Boys strip her.
Maybe you and me wil talk some more.
Consider it done, sir.
Good boy.
And you...
...whatever you name is.
What is your name?
Amsterdam, sir.
Amsterdam?
I'm New York.
Don't you ever come in here empty handed again.
You gotta pay for the pleasure of my company.
Take him for a boat ride, John.
Maybe he'll save your life again.
If the Day Break boys catch us on this river, they'll slit our throats!
I'll do it myself, if you don't keep quiet!
I never liked the harbour after dark.
And now each night they brought on shore the bodies of the soldiers.
So many mothers don't even have the solace of knowing where their sons have fallen.
I lost my own eldest in Antida.
His mother and I weren't able to recover his remains.
It was a mournful sight.
The war can't last forever.
But we had business of our own.
The Day Break boys have already been here.
There's nothing left. Let's go back.
What in hell...?
Jimmy..get down!
Jezus..that'll bring the harbour cops for sure!
Out of the way!
Let's take a look.
Jezus..they killed everybody!
There's nothing here but...
Watch it....dead sea crabs.
Come on! Let's go.
Shove off!
No. Wait for Amsterdam!
Where is Amsterdam?
Take him, damn fool!
What in the hell for?
Look in my glims. I said no less than 15!
Is this fresh?
Four hours most.
Much obliged, gents.
What's that word?
It means bodysnatchers.
I didn't ask the meaning.
I asked the word.
Ghoul?
Ghoul?
That's a good word.
A fresh outrage in the
Five Points.
A notice that you can be proud of.
Thank you.
Low thing, to do that to a body.
Low.
Why? They could've left that ship with nothing.
Instead they made the Police
Gazette.
A periodical of note.
A body is supposed to stay beneath the earth....
...wearing a wooden coat...
..until the resurrection.
These two are just a pair of bug eating sons of Irish bitches.
Just like you.
Don't seem to bother them none.
Maybe they don't share your religious scruples.
Maybe they're just a couple of fiddeling bends.
I've been called a lot of things, mister...
...but I've never been called..?
Fiddeling bends.
Fiddeling bends. Right.
If I knew what in the hell that meant..
...I might be inclined to take offense.
A fiddeling bend is a fellow who would steal anything...
...dead or alive.
Because he's too low to work up a decent lay for himself.
Count that careful.
I'm telling you that's all there is. That's all they gave us.
That's all they gave us.
Chiseler!
If you had said chiseler, now that's a word I understand.
Is that what you're calling us?
I can think of a number of things to call you, boil!
Right. But I asked if you was calling us chiselers?
Supposing I am?
Well, then we got business.
That we do!
2 dollars on McGloin!
5 pieces on the kid!
5 on Amsterdam!
Come on, McGloin, it's just a kid.
Watch his left, McGloin!
Alright, that'll do.
What do you say now, huh?
That'll do, for Christ sake.
Drag him off.
That's enough, kid.
You got him.
McGloin? How would that head look without the ears and nose on it?
You'd better leave that head alone, Bill.
I think I'm gonna trim the beak and the ears off that head.
Make a nice pot of soup out of that head.
You can find a tastier head than that, Bill.
I ain't got no stomach for an Irish stew.
The mighty McGloin.
Almost fish hooked by a sprat.
On the seventh day the Lord rested.
But before that He did...
...He squatted over the side of England...
...and what came out of him?
Ireland!
No offense, son.
None taken, sir.
I grew up here.
AllI ever knew of Ireland was in the talk of others in the asylum.
From which part of that excrementitous island were your forebares spawn?
I've been told Carrey.
But I lost proof of it in my language in the asylum.
I was raised in a similar establishment myself.
Everything you see belongs to me, to degree or another.
But beggars, quick thieves, here in Paradise..
...gymmills, blind tigers on the waterfront...
...anglers and the musers. The she-he's and the chinks.
Everybody owes...
...everybody pays, because...
...that's how you stand up, to the rising of the tide.
Is that right boys?
Yes Bill, that's right.
Enlist. Join up! Serve your country.
Volunteer and get your 50 dollar bonus!
We need 30,000 volunteers..
...and we're prepared to pay
677 dollar per volunteer.
Please read this. Thank you.
Would you like one to fill out?
3 square meals a day.
3 square meals a day.
Young man?
Enlist and...
...serve you country.
3 square meals a day, gentlemen!
If you're interested, I suggest...
Everywhere you went, people talked about the daft.
You could buy your way out for 300 dollars.
But who had 300 dollars?
For us it had might as well been 3 millions.
The recruters were too scared of the gangs...
...to come after us.
Besides, we never dreamt the war..
...would ever touch
New York.
Good morning, sir.
You!
Don't you run into me.
Fair enough!
I said don't run in to me!
Sorry!
Everything in place?
It seems so.
Then I leave you in the grace and favour of the Lord.
Thank you.
Why that dirty...!
Oh, no!
Allow me!
Thank you kindly, sir.
It's my pleasure.
I hope you don't mind if
I speak...
..I don't want to appear forward.
Well sir, that depends on what you say!
Would you call me wreckless, if I say that you are the prettiest girl in New York?
Only New York?
This is my stop.
May I walk with you a little then?
That sir...would be too bold.
For every lay we had a different name.
An Angler put a hook on the end of a stick...
...to drop behind store windows and doors.
An Autumn diver picked your pocket in church.
A Badger, gets a fellow in bed with a girl...
..and robs his pockets when they're on the go.
Jenny was a Bludger..
...a girl pickpocket.
And a Turtle dove.
A Turtle dove goes uptown...
...dressed like a housemaid.
Picks out a fine house...
...and goes right through the back door. Robs you blind.
It takes a lot of sand to be a Turtle dove.
I'll have my medal back.
Oh, jezus.
Don't do that again.
I said, don't do that!
Go back to the Points and let me do my business...
...or I will open your throat.
Alright.
Go on then.
I would.
Go on then.
Give me back my medal.
Make it quick.
I don't know which one's yours.
Suppose I help myself to everything.
Suppose you do.
Shall I walk with you a little, then?
What do you suppose a fellow can earn up here in a day?
Maybe we can pile in together?
I think you're a bit rough for this game.
Besides, I work alone.
Alone?
What do you core to the Butcher?
Nothing.
Nothing?
The Butcher and me have a special arrangement.
I don't want to see you again!
I don't blame you.
Pennies in their pockets and hope in their eyes.
They peer to the west.
Searching the horizon for a glimpse of land and salvation.
A glimpse of America.
Seeing all this poverty must be most unsettling, Mrs. Schermerhorn?
Some days the uptown gangs came to us.
The Schermerhorns were one of the oldest families in New York.
They didn't run the city..
...but they were listened to quite carefully, by them who did.
Commissioner Brunt, said you wanted to view the Points....
...in all its splendor an squalor.
Spare nothing concerning the conditions, said he!
Nothing except our safety, constable.
I'm sure we can be in no danger while we're in the constable's company, my dear!
Quite so, madam. Witness!
Shall we continue on?
You dare to leave it there?
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greely.
They all know it's mine.
Is that man drunk?
Dead as good friday, miss.
Good day, Mulraney.
Boys?
Jack?
Slum socialable?
Track finding. Reform studying.
May I present...
The Schermerhorns hardly require an introduction from you, Jack.
Mrs. Schermerhorn and her daughter.
The gentleman of course is...
Mr. Greely. The famous publisher.
It's a pleasure and an honour, sir.
Of the Tribune.
I am William Cutting.
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?
As of this moment, extremely well.
How do you do?
Orange blossom. Delicious!
Mr. Cutting is...
What a peach! You had a fine carreer on the stage.
...one of the Five Points local...
Please to meet you, sir.
..leaders.
Mr. Greely!
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Cutting.
The Five Points welcomes you..
...to these streets...
..and you shall pas in safety.
I'll see to their safety.
Thank you, Bill.
This way.
Good day lads.
Criminals who brag a dote show.
He knows who I am!
Inderdeed, sir. You are well known in these parts.
I find that strangely flattering.
Never did like crushers.
Well draw it mild, son.
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs without me telling him to.
Do you think my watch would be safe in that lamp post, Bill?
Why don't you hang it up there and see?
Some day.
Some day is right.
Is this the new lad? just another bastard I folded in the warmth of my embrace.
Hey!
Just wanted to see your face, son.
No harm intended.
You get to know a lot by butchering meat.
We're made up of the same things.
Flesh and blood. Tissue. Organs.
I love to work with pigs.
The nearest thing in nature to the flesh of a man, is the flesh a pig.
Pig, huh?
That's right.
This is for you, mother.
Here you are.
God bless you.
She ain't really my mother.
I knew that, Bill.
This is the liver.
The kidneys. The heart.
This is a wound.
The stomach will bleed and bleed.
This is a kill.
This is a kill.
And the artery. This is a kill.
You try it.
Go ahead.
Don't follow the blade on the rib.
Very good!
And the artery.
Bleed 'm slow. Let them think about it for a while.
Slow death.
Good!
You'll each bill the city
5000 dollars a month...
..for supplies and services..
...for which you will receive 10%.
Bill! Mr. Glour will work out the details. Thank you.
That's how we do things around Tammany, gentlemen.
Who's this?
Thank you, boys.
Good day, sir.
You got something on your mind?
Bill's taking quite a liking to you.
If you're up to something..
...I don't want no part in it.
I was in Hell Gate for
16 years.
I'm just trying to make my way is all...
...just like you.
Less of course you got a better notion?
No.
I can't get a days work done...
...for all the good citizens coming here..
...harrassing me about crime in the Points.
Some even go so far to accuse
Tammany of connivance..
..in this so called rampant criminality.
What can I do?
I can't have this.
Something has to be done.
What do you have in mind?
I don't know. Maybe we should hang someone.
Who?
No one important necessarily.
Back alley thieves, with no affiliations.
How many?
3 or 4.
Which?
Vier.
You stand here convicted..
...of ludeness, jackrolling...
...sneak thievery, chloral hydrating, sodomy..
...strangulation and corruption of the public good.
Chin up.
Handsome bunch of gallows food!
There's my old friend.
How are you feeling, Arthur?
I'm okay. Okay you know.
Say hello to Amsterdam.
He nearly fish hooked McGloin.
Nearly!
I see that you are dressed for the occasion, Arthur.
You know me, Bill. Always like to look me best.
That's the spirit.
Nice locket. I'll give you a dollar for it.
It's me mother's.
Dollar and a halve?
Done.
I'll miss you, Arthur.
See you in the hot country, Shamus.
Is my son present here?
Where's my little fellow?
Look at your dad.
Farewell dear boy.
I never struck a foul blow..
..or turned a card.
May God greet me as a friend!
That night the Reformers held a dance.
That was the Five Points alright....
...hangings in the morning, a dance in the evening.
To be sure!
It's not a matter of words, but by the way she smiles at me.
She smiles at a lot of people, John.
A penny, for a fighting
Irishman?
Are you from Carey?
I am sir.
It ain't much.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted to see so many young faces..
...at our first annual mission dance.
This will be a real circus!
The mission welcomes Christians of every stamp...
...and we are happy to greet our Roman catholic friends...
...who join us here tonight.
Ladies....come with me.
We're going to start the dance in just a moment.
Good evening, your Holyness.
Good evening, Reverend.
You should have shaved closer!
Good evening, Reverend.
I'd like to make a pardon.
Miss...?
Everdeane.
Miss Everdeane.
Gentlemen, over here! If you don't mind.
Thank you.
Open it. Hold it up!
Into the mirror.
That one!
Our queen has chosen.
Sir...
...your lady!
Regular services are held in the church at 6 and 8.
Go to hell.
What do you think your doing?
I'm dancing.
Why did you pick me?
That's none of your business.
Would you mind telling me?
Sorry!
I'm not much of a dancer.
Try and stay calm.
I've never been to a dance before!
It's best not to look down.
You can hold me tighter if you like.
Alright.
Okay!
Why didn't you dance with Johnny?
Because...
...I didn't want him.
I'm not good in this.
Wait!
What?
Wait.
How does this open?
It takes too long to lace back up...
...we'll be here all night.
Alright. I'll take it off.
There was a baby.
They cut it out.
Sorry!
It's fine.
Have you got any scars?
A few.
What's that then?
That?
A gift from Mr. Cutting.
A gift?
A gift!
Was it your birthday?
No.
What did you give him?
The answer to that has nothing to do with you.
Don't tell me you're angry with me?
No..I'm through with you.
Well, you're quicker then most fellows...
...generally they wait till afterwards!
I ain't interested..
...in the Butcher's leavings.
Stay away from the pikers.
15 to 1. Bug Eye Ward!
Amsterdam!
Everyone was working for the Butcher.
We ran his errands..
...made his money...
...took a piece...
...and said thank you, sir.
Gentlemen in the ring!
Even Tweed!
The fight's over!
Even me.
My father's son.
What the hell is this?
Sorry, Bill.
The city ordenance against boxing...
...is a blight. I grant you.
I'm losing money while you speak.
Go out there and collect those bets.
How do I collect, if no one won the fight?
This counts as a no decision.
You've got that covered, right?
Didn't anyone pay off the god damn police?
Yes, the municipal police...
...this is the metropolitan police.
You're going to repay me every cent.
Wait! Mr. Tweed!
Who asked for your opinion?
Let him speak!
We don't answer to you.
The law says there's no boxing in the city, right?
That's right, in the city.
Where does the city end?
The winner...in the
75th round...
Allow me to acknowledge the man who's vision..
...and enterprise, made possible the staging of this noble combat...
...in this inspiring and entirely legal surroundings, Mr. William Cutting!
And his young associate.
Well done. You're a quick learner.
We done good.
We done well.
May I have your kind attention?
May I remind you of the wonders of my museum on Broadway...
...P.T.Barnum's gallery of wonders!
It's a funny feeling being taken...
...under the wing of a dragon.
It's warmer than you think.
That's the building of our country right there, Mr. Cutting.
Americans are borning.
I don't see no Americans.
I see trespassers.
Irish, who do jobs for a nickel...
...that niggers do for a dime...
...and a white man used to get a quarter for.
What have they done? Name one thing they've contributed!
Votes!
Votes, you say?
They vote on who the
Archbishop tells them...
...and who tells him?
Their king in the pointy hat, who sits on his throne in Rome.
He's got mixed feelings with regards to the Irish.
Bill, deliver these good and fervant folk to the polls.
And there will be a handsome price for each vote that goes Tammany's way.
Miy father gave his life...
...making this country what it is.
Murdered by the British, with all of his men, July 25 juli, 1814.
You think I'm going to help you, befoul his legacy?
By giving this country to them...
...who's had no hand in fighting for it.
Why? Because they come off the boat crawling with lice...
...and begging you for soup?
You're a great one for the fighting Bill, I know...
...but you can't fight forever.
I can go down doing it .
And you will.
What did you say?
I said, you're turning you back on the future.
Not our future.
That document makes you a citizen...
...this one makes you a private in the Union army.
Now go fight for your country.
Next.
Sign here, son.
Or make your mark.
Here's your musket. Make sure you keep it dry on the boat.
Where  are we going?
I heard Tennessee.
Do they feed us now, you think?
My children, my chidren.
We must heal the divisions between us!
This war must cease. North and
South must stand united.
What happens at the finish?
Then we have ourselves a rowdy dow!
Ain't you never been to a theatre before?
No.
Mr Legree, lay down your whip.
Miss Elisa join hands with mr. Shelby.
And Topsy. Dear little Topsy.
Cradle Uncle Tom's head.
Leave the nigger dead.
Down with the Union!
Down with the Union!
For the blood of the Irish.
Bill, get down!
Somebody's popped the Butcher!
Who's man are you?
Speak smart and speak up!
What's he saying?
I think he's making his peace with God.
To hell with that!
He makes his peace with me.
I'm hearing your confession tonight, you Irish whore!
Who's man are you?
We speak English in this country.
Who's man are you?
Do you see this knife, I'm gonna teach...
...you to speak English with this knife!
Who's man are you?
Who's man are you?
Well that didn't tell us very much.
Fine waist coat.
Shame, I don't think it can be mended!
Will I keep it as a souvenir?
Where's Legree? Where's Topsy?
Jezus, let's continue.
Intermission is over.
Now that was bloody Shakespearian.
What?
Do you know who Shakeapeare was, sonny?
He was the fellow who wrote the
King James' Bible.
Mr., I don't know what you are talking about.
Because you're an ignorant
Irish welp!
Just like your father.
That's it. Tear my head off and destruct the world.
Just like the other stupid Irish in this country.
That's why I never ran with your dad.
Get off me you crazy bastard!
It means if you're not strong, you'd better be smart.
I don't know if your being too clever or too dumb.
But whatever it is, remember this much.
For all his faults, your father was a man who loved his people.
Amsterdam. Amsterdam. New York is calling you.
Look at that. What in Christ's name is that?
Rythms of the  dark continent, thrown into the kettle...
...with an Irish shindig. Stir it around a few times.
Poured out as a fine American mess.
A jig, doing a jig!
A little keep sake.
Good on ya, sir.
Come upstairs with me Bill.
Have I ever had you before?
So you don't call me by my christian name.
Bill. My god you're alright!
I heard the news and came over as quick as I could.
As timely as the angel of death.
You're not suggesting that I would stoop to what your suggesting?
Stop slabbering. If I thought it was you...
...you'd be in a wooden coat.
I've got a hole in my shoulder and it hurts...
...so have a drink and shut up.
Or shut up and get out.
I believe I'll have a drink.
Carefull, Tweedy the morts are frenchified!
No, I'm clean.
Jenny.
Bill.
I'll wrap you up.
It's gotta be tight.
Loves to make me cry.
You can take it!
There's my boy.
It's alright.
To the Butcher!
We're all much obliged.
Forever.
To the Butcher!
Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?
Go on. Go!
Is there anyone in the Five Points you haven't fucked?
Yes!
You!
Belt down!
Try it and I'll bite ya.
You were gonna bite me.
I dont think you want me.
Find out.
Oh, Jenny!
I can't sleep.
I hope you don't mind us laying here, sir?
Whatever takes your fancy, young friend.
Is your shoulder keeping you up?
I don't sleep too much.
I sleep with one eye open. I only got one eye.
How old are you Amsterdam?
Not too sure. Never did figure it.
I'm 47.
47 years old.
You know how I stayed alive this long? All these years.
Fear!
The spectacle of fearsome acts.
Somebody steals from me, I cut off his hands.
He offends me, I cut out his tongue.
He rises against me, I cut off his head, stick it on a pike!
Raise it high up, so all in the streets can see.
That's what preserves the order of things.
Fear.
That one tonight. Who was he?
A nobody. A coward.
What an end that would have been.
I killed the last honourable man
15 years ago.
Since then....
You've seen his portrait downstairs?
Has your mouth been glued up with juice?
I asked you a question!
I said I've seen it, sir.
You got a murderous rage in you.
I like it.
So much life boiling up in you.
That's good!
The priest and me lived by the same principles.
Only faith divided us.
He gave me this you know?
That was the finest beating I ever took.
My face was pulp. My guts pierced.
My ribs all messed up.
When he came to finish me...
...I couldn't look him in the eye.
He spared me because...
....he wanted me to live in shame.
This was a great man.
A great man.
So I cut out the eye that looked away.
Sent it to him wrapped in blue paper.
I would've cut them both out if I could afford being blind.
I rose up again with a full heart...
...and buried him in his own blood.
Well done!
He was the only man I killed worth remembering.
I never had a son.
Civilisation is crumbling.
God bless you!
If you've got anything to say...
...now is the time to say it.
Who is he to you, Jenny?
I was 12 years old.
My mother was dead. I was living in a doorway.
He took me in. Took care of me in his own way.
After they cut out the baby...
He doesn't fancy girls that scarred up.
You should know, in your own mind...
...that he never laid a hand on me till I asked him too.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Gentlemen, you are most welcome to this palace of enchantment...
...with visions to rival the tales of
Sheherazade and the Arabian Nights!
Flex your head to the teutonic beauty!
Feast you eyes on the magnificent blue...
...of these creatures.
Gentlemen, you see our caged birds well!
How would you like to make them sing?
They could be singing for you.
May God put the spirit of the holy steel in my spine...
...and the love of the blessed
Virgin in my heart.
Amen.
Easy now. What did you say?
He's not who he says he is.
He's not who he says he is?
Count you blessings he considers you a friend!
The only thing he considers every day and night is how to kill you!
Those eyes want me to take them out for you!
I'll bury it up you fundunem where it belongs!
I can read right through them!
They're empty...
His name is Vallon.
Don't do it Bill!
His name is Vallon!
Curious people these celestials.
You know why they use short sleeves?
So everyone can see he's got nothing stashed.
I hope it doesn't become a fashion.
Johnny?
Get up!
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your kind attention.
As some of you have surely noticed...
...our friend and benifactor, Mr Cutting...
..is tonight wearing a waistcoat of certain distinction!
May we appeal to him, to favour us...
...with another exciting exhibition.
Of skill. Courage. Daring and drama!
What's gonna happen?
The spider's kiss!
The wheel of death!
William Tell!
The butterfly!
The spider's kiss!
The Butcher's apprentice!
The Butcher's apprentice!
A command performance!
Where have you been?
A command performance indeed.
I want you to get out of here!
And for this, I must beg the indulgence...
...of my former...
... assistent in matters of impailment...
...the Butcher's original apprentice.
What do you say, Jen?
One more time for the sweet souvenir.
Come on!
Don't do it!
She'll be alright.
Remember this?
Of course!
You may feel more comfortable without that garment, Miss Everdeane!
You'll have to filch me a new one, Bill!
Anything in your pockets tonight?
I ain't started working yet.
What about that locket I gave you?
Apologies my dear. Pick it up.
Whoopsie daisy!
Now its good and broke!
I can't seem to get anything right tonight.
You got the sand to give 'm a grand finale?
Maybe when you're aiming a little straighter.
Enough of this heathen music.
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.
Strike up boys!
This is a night for Americans!
Jenny!
Hats off!
We hold in our hearts the memory of our fallen brothers...
...whose blood stains the very streets...
...we walk today.
Also on this night, we pay tribute to the leader of our enemies.
An honourable man...
...who crossed over bravely.
Fighting for what he believed in.
To defeat my enemy, I extinguish his life...
... and consume him as I consume these flames.
In honour of Priest Vallon.
In honour of Priest Vallon!
That's a wound !
I want you all to meet the son of
Priest Vallon.
I took him under my wing...
...and see how I'm repaid.
He saved my life one day so he could kill me the next...
...like a sneak thief.
Instead of fighting like a man.
A base defiler. Unworthy of a noble name.
That'll do Mcgloin.
Spread him out.
I hate blackies. You..you get to watch.
This is fresh meat!
We need to tenderise this meat a bit.
Alright, lets kiss goodnight to that pretty face of yours!
No...!
What'll it be then. Rib or chop.
Loin or shank.
The liver!
The spleen!
The kidney!
The lung!
The liver!
The tongue!
The heart! The heart!
The heart?
This boy has no heart.
Then kill him!
He ain't earned the death!
He ain't earned the death of my hands!
He'll walk amongst you marked with shame.
A freak. Worthy of Barnum's museum of wonders.
God's only man, speared by the Butcher.
Here. Here. This way.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
My mother's bones share this grave.
I've saved 20 cents out of every dollar I've ever earned since ....
...I was thirteen.
That's 215 dollars.
For bludgeoning and the rest.
This is what I wanted to show you.
This is where we're going to go, as soon as you get better....
...San Fransisco, California.
You can have anything you want out there.
These men are pulling gold right out of the river.
With their own hands.
We're here and need to get there.
Start here.
Go down 'round here.
Up to San Francisco.
The shortest way to go.
Will you go with me?
No need to fire that, miss.
Or even aim it.
An audience with yor mangled friend is all I want.
I've 44 notches on my club.
Do you know what they are for?
To remind me of what I owe God when I die.
My father was killed in battle too.
In Ireland, in the streets.
Fighting those who were taking their privilege.
What only could be got and held...
...by the decimation of a race.
That war is a thousand years old and more.
We never expected it to follow us here.
It didn't.
It was waiting for us when we landed.
Your father tried to carve out a corner in this country for his tribe.
That was him. That was his Dead Rabbits.
I often wondered, if he'd lived a bit longer...
...would he have wanted it to be more.
Why did you rifle through his pockets then?
For safekeeping.
I thought maybe you could do with it.
Blood stays on the blade.
That's a sorry looking pelt.
And it's been so nice and quiet for the last three months.
Tell me, this charge. Does it sit on easy with you?
No. Not uneasy , Bill.
I wouldn't say that.
But... my allegiance is to the law.
I'm paid to uphold the law.
What in heaven's name are you talking about?
You may have misgivings, but don't go believing that, Jack. That way lies damnation.
I'm in no danger of damnation, Bill.
Here's the thing.
I don't give a fuck about your moral conflicts...
..you meatheaded shit sack.
That's more or less the thing.
I want you to go out there. You and nobody else.
None of your little minions.
I want you to go out there...
...and I want you...
...to punish, the person...
...who's responsible...
...for murdering this poor little rabbit.
Is that understood?
Right!
Help yourself to some decent meat on the way out.
Damn it!
Is that you, boy?
I didn't mean nothing by that shot you know?
You scared me is all.
You know I'd never do you harm.
Come out now, lad.
Remember your father and me?
Are you to young to remember your Uncle Jack?
The times we had.
You know I won't hurt you.
This is bad for everybody.
What's next, dead politicians?
I could spare half a dozen of you...
...easier than I can spare him.
Still, I think it shows dash.
Give the boy some time, we'll settle with a good dust up.
The lads!
There are more of us coming off the ships each day.
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.
And we're afraid of the Natives!
Get all of us together...
....we ain't got a gang..
...we got an army.
And all we need is a spark. One spark, to wake us all up.
It was me who played you false.
I'd take it back if I could.
Take it back?
Johnny, I ought to kill you!
Get out of the Points and don't come back.
Where are you going, boil?
Come along.
Come on.
Tell us John, what's the trouble?
No trouble, Bill.
Still hiding out with your friends?
No, I'm not with them, Bill.
I'm with you, with the Natives.
You always were a Native, as far as I'm interested, John.
Till you became a stag.
You tell me you're a Native?
Do you want to know what a Native is?
A Native is a man, who's willing to give his life...
...for his country.
Like my father done.
Are you willing to do that, my young friend?
John? Johnny?
Johnny?
I'll get you off.
It hurts too much.
Just kill me.
Just kill me.
Please. Please.
Please. Please.
Please.
I'm sorry, Johnny.
Oh, Mary mother of God, pray for us sinners...
...on the day of our death...amen.
Rest in peace, Ma.
What are you doing here, boil?
What's that nigger doing in this church?
What's a Dead Rabbit doing with the Natives,huh?
No niggers among the Natives.
Niggers as robbers is one thing...
...but niggers in a church, that's something else!
You run with the Natives, you go pray with the Natives!
You're going to wind up on a stake like your man did!
McGloin?
Father! Jezus, do you know there's a nigger in your church?
Jezus!
The earth turns...
...but we don't feel it move.
And one night you look up...
...one spark and the skie's on fire.
It's a touching spectacle.
We'll come back when you're ready for us.
The past is the torch that lights our way.
Where our fathers have shown us the path.
We shall follow.
Our faith is the weapon most feared by our enemies...
...for thereby shall we lift our people up...
...against those who will destroy us.
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits, to remind all of our suffering...
...and as a call to those who suffer still...
...to join our ranks.
However so far they may have strayed from our common home across the sea.
For with great numbers, must come great strength.
For the salvation of our people.
We don't want your business.
How many other men live here?
You all have to register.
You can't force me to join no army.
Have you got 300 dollars?
Of course not!
Who the hell's got 300 dollars?
If you are drafted, release from militairy service can only be secured...
...for 300 dollars, according to the conscription act.
300 Dollars?
Otherwise you have to serve!
Who the hell's got 300 dollars?
You have to serve, sir!
You tell me!
Boys!
I was born here, sir. You immigrated here!
Sweet jezus. War does terrible things to men.
Get back up town, where you belong!
300 dollars. It's another rich man's war!
Sir, I request an audience with this man.
Don't they speak English in
New York anymore!
Don't understand.
You do speak English!
I wonder if miss Everdeane can angle her rifle in another direction?
I wonder Mr. Vallon, if you understand the value of this sort of publicity?
The Archbishop himself, shoulder to shoulder with half the Irish in the Five Points.
I'm offering my boy, to form an alliance with you...
...against Bill Cutting and his slate of Native candidates.
I'll negotiate a handsome fee, for every Irish vote...
...you send Tammany's way, in the coming elections.
I need a new friend in the Five
Points, son.
I'd like that friend to be you.
Now just a moment, Mr. Tweed.
Suppose we do get you those votes.
Would you back an Irish candidate of my chosing..
I don't think so.
What if we get you all the
Irish votes?
Mr. Vallon, that will only happen in the reign of Queen Dick!
Beg your pardon?
That means it will never happen.
Now I might be persuaded to back an Irish candidate...
...for, let's say alderman.
Alderman?
We've already got an Irish alderman.
So we have, that's why....
What's bigger than an alderman?
Sheriff!
Sheriff!
Alright, Mr Tweed, you back an
Irishman for sheriff...
...of the city and county of
New York...
...and we'll get him elected.
I love the Irish, son...
..but higher than alderman you shall never climb.
Why not?
For one thing, no man living can consolidate the Irish vote.
I can!
And for another, I mean no offence...
...no one's yet found an Irish candidate...
...for sheriff worth voting for.
Monk!
Here.
Got me looking as sober as me own grandfather!
He was a great man, I'm sure.
He was a drunken bastard.
Can I say what I want?
That's why I wanted you.
Our elected representatives are a gang of thieves!
Who swear to better our lot...
...while dipping their hands deep into our pockets.
I stand shoulder to shoulder with community leaders like Bill Cutting...
....against any, an all in roads in our democracy.
I'll see to it, that no one takes away...
... what you earned by pluck and application.
To invading hordes of Hibernians.
Go to the polls and put your mark...
... next to the name Walter McGinn.
Against the potatoes weeders, like them over there...
...thieving our jobs.
Why should so many Irish die down south...
...when the first war to win...
...is not down in Dixie, but right here...
...in these streets!
Who's the finest streetfighter in the Five Points?
Monk!
That's right and let the whole damn city hear it!
That man was right born for this.
He's killed 44 men and laid low a couple of hundred more.
Is that right?
Right.
I should have run him for mayor!
Alright, line 'm up.
It's election day!
Come on, you bastard. We need your vote.
Bastard? I fought for you nigger...
...I lost an arm for you!
Well, that's a start. Come on.
Rise and shine, rise and shine.
This great country of ours, even hop fiends get their vote.
Less heart and more haste, darling.
Where are you going ?
I already voted today.
Cast for Monk and Tammany, by god!
Twice.
Twice?
Only twice? You call that doing your civic duty?
Come with me.
Oh no, you don't. Get back and sit down.
Here's another one!
Clean him up good.
Shave the beards off boys and send them back to vote again.
Okay boys, vote Tammany.
Tammany!
What our great city needs is a new court house.
Now I propose it should be a modest, economical structure.
Excuse me one moment.
What is it?
Monk's already won by 3,000 more votes, then there are voters.
Only 3? Make it 20, 30.
We don't need a victory, we need a
Roman triumph.
We don't have anymore ballots.
Remember the first rule of politics...
...ballots don't make the results...
..the counters do. Keep counting.
It's from Bill.
Monk?
Citizens of the Five Points!
Mr. Cutting is attempting to draw me...
...into an argument...
...that would no doubt end in bloodshed...
...and the compromising of my office.
What do you think?
Shall I engage in silence, this relic of the ancient law...
...or, shall I be your chosen voice...
...in a new testament, in a new world?
There you are, Bill.
The people have spoken.
The very notion of violent reprisal benumbs them.
Come on up.
Let's see if we can resolve our...
...grievances the democratic way.
That my friends, is the minority vote.
Now you tasted my mutton, how do you like it?
Look, I want you to see this.
This is you, right here!
Notch 45, you Irish bug bastard.
Why don't you burn him?
See if his ashes turn green.
Fortune favours them all!
You killed an elected official?
Who elected him?
You don't know what you've done to yourself.
I know your works.
You're neither cold nor hot.
So because you are luke warm...
...I will spew you out of my mouth.
You can build your filthy world without me.
I took the father, now I'll take the son.
You tell young Vallon, I'm going to paint...
...Paradise square with his blood.
Two coats!
I'll festoon my sleeping chamber with his guts.
As for you Mr. Tammany fucking hall...
...you come down to the Points once more...
...and you'll be dispatched by my own hand!
Now get back to your celebration...
...and let me eat in peace.
I paid you fair.
Down!
Raise!
You son of a bitch!
Challenge.
Challenge accepted.
And then it came...
...the first day of the draft.
Thomas O'neill.
Andrew Lewis.
Joseph Flynn.
They read out the draftees names as if they were dead already.
J.B. Gleeson.
The O'Conell Guard.
The Plug Uglies.
As for us.
The Forty Thieves.
The tribes were gathered.
The Chichesters.
The drums were beating.
The Dead Rabbits.
The American guard.
The Atlantic Guard.
The Slaughterhouses.
The Bowery Boys.
Confederation of American Natives.
James Mooney.
But all we could see...
...was the hand in front of us.
Shaun O'Connell.
C.W. Morris.
When?
Whenever you like.
Daybreak tomorrow.
Ground?
Paradise square.
Weapons?
That I leave up to you.
Bricks, bats, axes, knives.
Pistols?
No pistols.
Good boy.
Terms are resolved.
Counsel is concluded.
To hell with your damned draft.
Get 'm boys.
Rip 'm apart.
Kill the rich bastards.
Hotel!
They're not getting my son!
Uptown town at the draft office...
...the cops broke a few skulls.
And everybody ran away.
But the word was spreading...
...in the dark.
Up on fifth avenue, the Schermerhorns and their mob...
...breathed a little easy.
Just a brief blist of anger, over
Mr. Lincoln's draft.
Entirely justifiable in my view.
There are two sides to that question.
Ther are several sides to that question, Mr. Schermerhorn.
But only one right side.
As with any question, it holds the abuse...
...of any executive power.
In any case, Mr. Greely...
...we can all be thankful, it wasn't any worse.
It may be worse yet, sir.
I saw them. I don't know what to think...
What is it you are so fond of saying, Mr. Tweed?
Mr. Greely, you won't like this...
...but what is it?
I don't remember.
You can always hire one half of the poor...
...to kill the other half.
I've come to say goodbye.
I've booked passage for
California.
Jenny, give me one more day and
I'll go with you.
You'll be dead by then.
What would you have me do?
I don't know.
This will all be finished tomorrow.
No it won't.
This whole place is going to burn anyway.
I've heard of the poor are going from door to door...
...in the Five Points, asking those supporters for further riots...
...to place a candle in the window.
Irish, Poles, Germans.
Ah, Mr. Greely, the city is not mad...
...I prophesise a dark night.
Nobody goes to work today.
We're shutting the factories down!
When the sun rose next...
...the city had split in half.
From all over New York they came...
...ironworkers, factory boys, street cleaners!
Irish, Polish, German...
...anyone who never cared about slavery in the Union.
Anyone who couldn't buy his way out.
Let the sons of the rich...
....go and die they cried.
Let the sons of the poor...
...stay home.
The earth was shaking now.
But I was about my father's business.
Oh, mighty Lord...
...you are the dagger in my hand.
Guide my hand on this day of vengeance.
We give thanks to the Lord....
...for He is good.
With you, the swift cannot flee.
Nor the strong escape.
Let my sword devour, till its thirst is quenched with blood....
...and my enemy sleeps forever.
For you and the God of retribution.
For the Lord crushes the wicked.
The Lord is merciful.
And his love endures forever.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Get the women upstairs!

Did your daddy buy you out of the army!
Can he buy me out of the army too?

Bastards!
Shang!Hold on!
Thank God.
I die a true American.
Tomorrow morning...
...get our people down to the docks.
I want every man and woman coming off the boats...
...given hot soup and bread.
We're burying a lot of votes here tonight.
In the end....
...they put candles on the bodies...
...so their friends, if they had any...
...could know them in the dark.
The city did this free of charge.
Shang, Jimmy Spoils, Hellcat.
McGloin and more.
Friend or foe...
...it didn't make no difference now.
It was four days and nights...
..before the worst of the mob was finally put down.
We never knew how many New
Yorkers died...
...that week, before the city was finally delivered.
My father told me we was all born of blood and tribulation.
And so then too, was our great city.
But for those of us who...
...lived and died in them furious days...
...it was like everything we knew...
...was mildly swept away.
And no matter what they did to build this city up again...
...for the rest of time...
...it would be like no one even knew we was ever here.
They called it
"The car for Everyman".
Henry Ford himself called it a car for the "great multitude."
It was functional and simple,
like your sewing machine or your cast-iron stove.
You could learn to drive it in less than a day,
and you could get any color you wanted, so long as it was black.
When Ford first conceived the Model T, it took 13 hours to assemble.
Within five years, he was turning out a vehicle every 90 seconds.
Of course, the real invention wasn't the car,
it was the assembly line that built it.
Pretty soon, other businesses had borrowed the same techniques.
Seamstresses became button sewers.
Furniture makers became knob turners.
It was the beginning and the end of imagination...
all at the same time.
Howard?
- Charles, I'm talking to you.
- Hmm?
They need spokes, same as the others.
You know, they oughta make a better spoke.
Yeah? Then what would you do?
It was a land of opportunity.
The country was shrinking,
and there was life to be made out West...
for any man with drive and ambition.
If your dream was big enough and you had the guts to follow it,
there was truly a fortune to be made.
How are you, sir?
- Damn thing blew on me.
- What?
It's a Stanley Steamer.
The boiler blew.
- Oh?
- Can you fix it?
Uh...
Sure!
Sure I can fix it.
This is an amazing machine.
It's got a two-stroke boiler system... that's heated by this huge fire grate.
I mean, it's...
Well, it's basically a very small locomotive.
- Thank you.
- Now, I made some improvements.
It wasn't your boiler that was blowing; it was your bleed valve.
So, with increased pressure, I can see you getting up to 40 miles an hour.
Really?
Oh, yeah and if you superheat the excess,
I can see you reaching...
- 50, maybe 60 miles an hour.
- Is that right?
Easily. And the thing of it is,
Mr. Coughlin, you don't feed it, you don't stable it, and unless you hit a lamppost, the thing's not gonna get sick and die on ya.
- That's funny.
- To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't spend more than five dollars on the best horse in America.
This is not the finish line, my friends.
This is the start of the race.
The future is the finish line!
And the new Buick White Streak is just the car to take us there!
Four in-line cylinders,
42 1/2 horsepower,
And this is the very same car that you can buy at anyone of our five showrooms all across the Bay Area.
"The age of the automobile is here," boasted Howard. "The future has arrived."
- Oh, my.
- Read the part about the future again.
Oh, I'm kind of dealing with it right now.
Oh, sorry.
Here. I'll take him.
Come here, big guy.
Come here. Come here.
Oh, are you the future, huh?
Are you the future?
Are you gonna...
Are you going to the moon?
The moon! Whee!
I'll take it.
Do we really need all this?
No. No. We don't need it...
There's also a caretaker's house, a paddock, a barn, some very nice stables.
How big are the stables?
Got it.
Settle down. Settle down.
Quit. Quit. Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Come on, Dad.
Whoa.
There you go.
You're not getting him a horse.
Why not?
He's great at it.
- Because he's 16 years old.
- So?
So... he should earn it.
All right.
- All... All right. Quiet.
- Everybody knows it.
Nobody knows Longfellow.
Dickinson.
Ooh!
"We never know how high we are..."
Oh, I know that.
Yeah. I know.
I know it.
Well?
"We never know how high we are till we are called to rise."
- Good.
- Very good, John.
"And then, if we are true to plan, our statures touch the skies."
- Excellent.
- Yes! That's really good.
Uh-oh.
- "The heroism..."
- Right.
Right. "The heroism..."
"The heroism we recite...
"would be a daily thing,
Oh, that's it.
"Did not ourselves the cubits warp,
for fear to be a king. "
You should be riding it.
You knew the poem.
Yeah. But he looks so perfect out there, doesn't he?
Yeah. He does.
That's the poetry right there, Agnes.
That's the poetry.
Thank you. Thank you for coming.
I came here 15 years ago with 21 cents in my pocket.
I know a lot of us at the table have a story like that.
And, you know,
I can't help thinking... that if we can start out there and end up here, where can't we go in America?
Hmm...
So, as corny as it sounds,
I'd like to propose a toast to the future.
Because out here, my friends, the sky is literally the limit.
To the future!
To the future!
To the future!
There were no suicides on Wall Street that day.
It was a myth that would grow over time.
The real effect of October 29 took a little longer to sink in.
By noon, all the gains of the previous year had been obliterated.
By 4:00 p.m., nearly $ 10 billion of market value was gone.
Over the next two weeks, the hemorrhage continued.
And before long,
25% of the workforce was unemployed.
A great national migration began.
Displaced families took to the American highway...
in the last possession that remained to them:
Their automobile.
And all at once, millions of Americans...
had a new definition of home.
I made two dollars today.
- What?
- I made two dollars.
Here.
Where did you get these?
Yeah, your boy combed 'em out, changed all the tack.
I didn't have to tell him a thing.
- Hey, Red,
- Attaboy!
Where'd a young fella like you learn so much about horses?
His name's Johnny.
You can call me Red.
Whoo!
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's that?
Everything.
Dickens, Wordsworth.
There's your Arabian Nights and Moby Dick,
even your Milne, from when you were...
Why?
What's wrong?
Mr. Blodget here, he has a house, a real house. - Dad... Dad, what's wrong?
- And his wife cooks.
- She is a good cook.
There's even a phone next door.
We'll call you.
Every couple of weeks, we'll call you, and we'll tell you where we are.
We're just gonna go home, all right? Let's go.
Listen to me.
You have a gift.
You have a gift.
Don't... Don't do this.
- Dad, don't do this.
- We'll be back.
- Mom
- Go with Mr. Blodget.
- No.
- He's gonna take care of you, sweetie.
- Mom, don't do this.
- OK, go with him.
I don't know. You still look pretty tall to be a jockey.
I've never been over 115.
Where'd you learn to ride like that?
Home.
All right.
Here's the way it works.
I pay you $10 a week to ride.
You owe nine dollars for your meals, six dollars to sleep in the stalls, three dollar tack fee.
That's the deal.
How do I pay all that back?
You win.
Ow!
You son of a bitch!
Get off of me!
Yah!
Get lost!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
A nose? You lose a race a nose, you'd better fall off tryin!
Here. Muck these stalls down, every damn one of'em!
A nose!
For Christ's sake!
No. No, Bill, I'm not gonna do it.
No more layoffs.
Well, it can't get any worse.
Look, if it stays like this, we'll just...
Bill, we'll be fine, really.
We will.
All right. I'll see you in town.
Frankie, come on.
It's a glorious day outside.
Why don't...
Why don't you go fishing or something?
I'm reading.
You can read when it's raining.
Come on,
I'll teach you to drive the truck.
You already taught me to drive the truck.
- Well, what are you reading?
- Flash Gordon.
Come on, Dad.
It's about the future!
We'll be in San Francisco till Wednesday.
Yeah? What?
Come inside.
- I'm not done.
Sam can do that.
I don't want Sam to do it.
I want to do it.
- Annie.
- Don... Don... No!
Ma'am.
Come on, Red!
Come on!
At a time when the world really needed a drink,
you couldn't get one in the United States of America.
Liquor was illegal.
Diversions were scarce,
and there's just so much a human being can do without.
Soon, the border town was born,
providing everything to the south
that their neighbor to the north, would not.
You could find anything:
Food, companionship,
decent gin, and with gambling outlawed as well,
the chance to turn bad luck into good.
Relax! You got it!
You got it! You got it!
Go!
That jockey was ridin' like he's got an anvil in his pocket.
I'm gonna bet with you no more.
I don't like it.
Who's that?
George Woolf, greatest jockey in the world.
That's Charles Howard?
Yeah.
- I thought he came down here for a...
- Quickie divorce?
- Why?
Look at him.
Nothing quick about that.
It was in the palace of the great sultan.
Sultan of where?
The Sultan of Araby.
I'd been living there for almost a year, racing his Arabians across the desert by day... and finishing my personal history of the region by night.
Then one day, the sultan summons me into his throne room.
He looks at me and says,
- John Pollard.
- John Pollard.
You are my greatest jockey.
It is you I have chosen to ride my hundred mile race from Kusmat to Tripoli.
200 mile.
All right. 200-mile.
Excuse me, sahib.
You didn't need to wreck it, Georgie.
When you started tellin' that story, it was only 50 miles.
Yeah, well, everything gets longer in the retellin'.
Just ask your friend Wanda over there.
You know, if you start ridin' a little more and talkin' a little less, you might start winnin' some races.
I got two bucks says I beat you in this one.
I'm not sure if you do,
but I got five says I beat you.
Done.
- Give me odds. You're the favorite.
- Even money.
- Nah! Forget it! Two-to-one!
- Fine.
You got it.
Hey, Johnny, you're on a speed horse.
What are you doin' back here with me?
I like the conversation, and it's not a speed horse. Don't try to hook me.
- You goin' tonight?
- Nah. You?
- Nah.
- What time?
- I don't know. 8:00?
- Okeydoke.
Oops. There's my hole!
Gotta go! Yah!
Goddamn it!
Whoa!
We got him!
- I'll take him.
- Get the hell out of here.
- I said, I'll take him.
- He's got a fractured foot.
If you're gonna shoot him anyway,
I'll save you the bullet.
- Whoa.
- Fine.
Let him go.
Hey, let him have him.
Now, bud.
Yeah, boy.
Okeydoke, Johnny.
There's the hole! Gotta fly!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
There once was a princess from Siam...
who was sitting here sort of like I am.
I wined her and dined her, and then I reclined her.
Ah, shit.
What rhymes with Siam?
That's great.
You make that up?
Pretty obvious, huh?
- That's beautiful.
- No. You're beautiful.
Don't say that.
You pay me.
So, you wanna... you know... get going?
Sure. Why not?
- How do you miss a hole like that?
- There's my hole! Gotta fly!
Are you blind? ngel, are you okay?
Ol!
Ol!
You don't wanna watch?
No. Not really.
I don't either.
Ol!
So, what? They brought you down here to make you feel better? Is that it?
Yes. Sort of.
Those guys, they think everything is fixed with a party.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Oh. Marcela Zabala.
- My sister, Isabella, she's married...
- No. No, no. I know.
Nice to meet you. Charles.
Mucho gusto.
So, do you feel better?
No. No, not really.
No. How could you?
With something like that.
Come on, buddy. Wake up.
Come on.
- Did I lose?
- Oh, no. You clobbered him.
Easy.
- Easy, nice and slow.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on.
Let me buy you some turtle soup.
I'm fine, George.
Go win yourself a race or something.
Look, let's go down to Sloan's, and we'll just...
I'm fine, George.
I don't need your help, and
I sure as shit don't need your charity.
Leave me alone, all right?
It's been 20 years since I've been on a horse.
Don't worry. It's the kind of thing that comes right back.
Let's go.
Come on!
What? She got you back up on a horse, and now you wanna buy 'em?
Yeah. Maybe.
Maybe a couple.
Well, you wanna win or just own 'em?
- I wanna win.
- What sort of question is that?
Well, you're gonna need a trainer before you buy horses.
No. You need two.
So you can fire one, eh?
Randy Thatcher's barn.
Trains about 50 or 60 ponies.
- Good fella too. Real horse person.
- A real horse-shitter. Scusa, scusa
Now, now. I don't know, maybe you want a smaller barn, somebody who can take the time...
Who's that?
- Huh?
Oh, he's a crackpot.
Lives alone in the bushes.
What's he do?
I don't know.
He used to be a trainer, farrier.
Now he just looks after that horse.
Come on.
Let's look at another barn.
- Howdy.
- Hello.
- Wh... You hungry?
- No. No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Charles Howard.
Tom... Smith.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
What's... What's in his bandage?
Oh, that's hawthorn root.
It increases circulation.
You wanna sit down?
Oh. All right.
Thank you.
Will he get better?
Already is... a little.
Will he race?
No. Not that one.
So why are you fixing him?
'Cause I can.
Every horse is good for somethin'.
He could be a cart horse or a lead pony.
And he's still nice to look at.
You know, you don't throw a whole life away... just 'cause he's banged up a little.
Is that coffee?
Yeah.
It's bad, though.
You always tell the truth?
Well, I try to.
It ain't just the speed.
It's the heart.
You want something that's not afraid to compete.
Half these horses are just show ponies.
You want something that's not gonna run from a fight.
How do you find that?
Look, I won the Robles Handicap.
I was second in the Tijuana Derby.
I won the Manzanita Oaks.
You know, that used to be a stakes race.
I know.
I- I would've won T.J., but the piece of shit lugged out on me.
Sounds great.
We'll let ya know.
Look.
I can work 'em out in the morning.
Or, even hot-walk 'em if you need me to.
Really?
You'll hot-walk 'em?
This is somethin' else.
A dream come true, walkin' you around.
Hook you up to a plow, pull me around for a little while.
Come on.
You ever run in the money?
Huh?
Hey. Hey.
You ever run in the money?
I don't think so.
Couldn't beat a human being, let alone another horse.
You goddamn sack-of-crap old plater.
Probably the fastest you're gonna run in your entire life, you piece-of-shit old glue-pot.
That's right.
The first time he saw Seabiscuit,
the colt was walking through the fog at 5:00 in the morning.
Smith would say later that the horse looked right through him...
as if to say,
"What the hell are you looking at?
- Who do you think you are?"
He was a small horse, barely 15 hands.
He was hurting too.
There was a limp in his walk,
a wheezing when he breathed.
Smith didn't pay attention to that.
He was looking the horse in the eye.
God... damn.
He was the son of Hard Tack, sired by the mighty Man O' War.
But the breeding did little to impress anyone at Claiborne Farms.
Get rid of him.
At six months, he was shipped off to train with the legendary trainer
Sunny Fitzsimmons,
who, over time, developed a similar opinion of the colt.
Is that a racehorse or a lead pony?
The judgment wasn't helped by his gentle nature.
Where his sire had been a fierce, almost violent competitor,
Seabiscuit took to sleeping for huge chunks of the day...
and enjoyed lolling for hours under the boughs of the juniper trees.
His other great talent was eating.
Though half the size of other colts,
Seabiscuit could frequently eat twice as much.
Fitzsimmons decided the horse was lazy...
and felt sure he could train the obstinance out of him.
I want you to hit him as many times as you can over a quarter of a mile.
When he didn't improve, they decided the colt was incorrigible.
They made him a training partner to better horses,
forcing him to lose head-to-head duels...
to boost the confidence of the other animal.
By the time he was three years old,
Seabiscuit was struggling in two cheap claiming races a week.
Soon he grew as bitter and angry as his sire Hard Tack had been.
He was sold for the rock-bottom price of $2,000.
And, of course, it all made sense.
Champions were large, they were sleek,
they were without imperfection.
When they finally did race him,
he did just what they had trained him to do.
He lost.
What exactly is it you like?
He's got spirit.
I'll say.
Can... Can he be ridden?
Oh, sure.
Eventually.
He can be a little touchy.
Yeah, I got it.
No. Really.
I'm fine.
Jesus Christ!
That horse is nuts!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Come on, you sons of bitches!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go! Come on, you sons of bitches!
I'll take all of you!
Come on! Come on!
It's okay.
- I'm not afraid of you.
Sure. I know.
I know what you're all about.
You hungry?
Huh?
Yeah. Bet you are.
Huh? Come on.
Come on, boy.
Yeah.
Why don't you just breeze him around one turn.
Give the folks a look.
Right.
Red Pollard,
Mr. and Mrs. Howard.
Yeah. Hi.
Hello.
Well, we'll just be movin' on.
Does he breeze?
Well, we'll find out.
Seems pretty fast.
Yeah.
In every direction.
Hell, he's so beat up, it's hard to tell what he's like.
I just can't help feelin' they got him...
so screwed up runnin'in a circle,
he's forgotten what he was born to do.
He just needs to learn how to be a horse again.
Well, how do you do that?
- How far do you want me to take him?
- Till he stops.
Okay.
That seems like a pretty good ride.
Hope so.
That's it, boy.
You're all right.
Let's see what you got, boy.
Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Whoo!
That's it, boy. That's it!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo!
- Well, at least he wasn't expensive.
- No. That's true.
Whoo!
Goddamn it!
You're an amazing animal!
Whoo!
You can come inside, you know.
- I'm fine. Thank you.
- Yeah, you look it.
No, really, I'm fine.
Okay.
Suit yourself.
Welcome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
It's okay.
Oh, I'm not that hungry.
Mmm. Sure you're not.
It's just a lot of food.
It's okay.
Rather have you strong than thin.
They called it "relief,"
but it was a lot more than that.
It had dozens of names:
N.R.A., W.P.A.,
the C.C.C.
But it really came down to just one thing.
For the first time in a long time,
someone cared.
For the first time in a long time,
you were no longer alone.
Goat racing?
Oh, no. Just trying to calm him down a little.
Smart ones hate being alone all the time.
- Oh.
- And sometimes another animal, it just... just soothes them a bit.
Pretty quiet in there.
What'd you do?
Go take a look.
Oh.
♪ Rock of ages, cleft for me ♪
♪ I am hid and safe in thee ♪
♪ For the water and the blood ♪
♪ From thy riven...♪
Okay.
You don't break him or anything, but we gotta see what he's got.
You take him to the 5½ pole and turn him loose.
Turn him loose?
Yeah, son.
He's a racehorse.
Ha! Ha!
Come on!
Come on!
Ha! Come on, I know you got more than this! Let's show 'em, boy!
How's he look?
Asleep.
Come on!
Let's show 'em, Pops! Come on!
Whoo!
There it is! Yeah!
Whoo!
Oh, my.
Yeah, you and me! Let's go!
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo!
- Boy. Fast?
- Oh. Yeah.
How fast?
Your horse just broke the track record at Tanforan.
Sometimes they... they just, uh, hanker for a little competition.
As long as we're talkin' long shots,
I got a real doozy for you, folks.
We got a horse that's going off at 70-to-1, and that's a short price, my friends.
This horse couldn't win a church raffle, let alone a $2,000 allowance.
Yeah, talk about a jump in class.
This is the skunk of the garden party.
Yes, he's the surprise in the punch bowl.
As a matter of fact,
I'll lay even money that this nag,
Seabiscuit, couldn't even finish six furlongs.
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin live at Clockers' Corner.
Wow.
I wanted maroon.
They only had bright red.
Oh, it looks great.
You don't think the "H" is too big?
You seen the size of our jockey?
Okay. Favorite's that gray over there.
He's got a big late charge, so lock in early with him and stay right off his flank.
Okay.
Once our boy sees who the competition is, he'll do most of the work.
But don't move till that gray does.
What if it's late?
Let's go.
Twelve minutes to post.
I don't think it's gonna matter much.
Honestly.
- Come on in.
Number 3, Pollard on Seabiscuit.
Hey, sahib.
Kinda small, isn't he?
Gonna look a lot smaller in a second, Georgie.
I got five bucks says he doesn't.
Starter's poised. The flag is up.
- And there they go.
Pirate's Gold breaks first, followed by Geronimo on the outside.
Silver Treasure is third, followed by Seabiscuit.
They're coming by the five-furlong pole.
It's Pirate's Gold, Geronimo,
Hill's Army and Agua Dulce.
Whoa!
Son of a bitch!
Ha! Ha!
Piece of shit bastard!
What the hell is he doing?
... opening up a 3... a 4-length lead...
- Let's go!
- What are you doing?
I'm gonna put you on the rail, you piece of shit!
Get off of me!
How do you like that, you son of a bitch?
You're gonna drop me, man!
The two horses are flying down...
- You like the rail?
- Here comes the cavalry charge!
- Knock me off my horse!
It's Silver Treasure on the inside.
Silver Treasure on the inside.
Silver Treasure and Pirate's Gold.
And at the wire it's Silver Treasure.
Aw, damn it.
- What the hell were you thinkin'?
- He fouled me.
What am I supposed to do, let him get away with that?
Well, yeah, when he's 40-to-1.
- He almost put me in the rail!
- Well, did he?
Look, we had a plan.
He fouled me, Tom!
What am I supposed to do?
He cut me off!
He fouled me!
Son? Son.
What are you so mad at?
There's a phone next door.
We'll call you.
Every couple of weeks, we'll call you and tell you where we are.
No. We're just gonna go home. All right?
You have a gift.
You have a gift.
I need to borrow some money.
All right.
I, uh,
I haven't been to a dentist, and m...
Well, I-I need to borrow some money.
- That's fine.
- I don't know when I can pay you back.
I mean, when we win.
When we win, I can pay you back.
That is if you still want me to ride.
Of course I want you to ride.
How much do you need?
Uh, ten dollars.
Here.
Than... Uh...
It's fine.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
That's it, Pops.
We're okay now.
It's all right, boy.
Yeah, we're okay.
Nothing to worry about.
All the time in the world, boy.
That's it, Pops.
Nice lead.
Just like that, boy.
Just like that.
What do you think, boy?
You ready to go?
You and me.
Let's go, boy. Let's go. Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!
Whoo!
In the end, it wasn't the dams...
or the roads... or the bridges or the parks.
Or the tunnels, or the thousands of other public projects
that were built in those years.
It was more invisible than that.
Men who were broken only a year before...
suddenly felt restored.
Men who'd been shattered suddenly found their voice.
Well, I just think this horse has a lot of heart.
He may have been down, but he wasn't out.
He may have lost a few, but he didn't let it get to him.
We could all learn a lick or two from this little guy.
Oh, and by the way, he doesn't know he's little.
He thinks he's the biggest horse out there.
So you got big plans for this little horse?
Oh, yeah. See, sometimes when the little guy, he doesn't know he's a little guy, he can do great big things.
Can we get a shot here?
See, this isn't the finish line.
The future is the finish line, and the Biscuit is just the horse to get us there.
"Just the horse to get us there."
You certainly made a believer out of me, Mr. Howard.
It's time for this old tout to eat some crow.
Four and 20 blackbirds, to be exact, all baked up in some humble pie, and I'll take mine a la mode.
Oh.
And one more thing, Mr. Howard.
I just wanna say...
- Thanks for the champagne.
- Don't mention it.
- Did you see the infield?
- No, not yet.
Take a look.
Your little horse is sellin' out the cheap seats.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, what do you think about all those folks in the infield, Red?
That's who we're ridin' for, folks with a quarter in their pocket.
Red! Red! Red!
That's an awful lot of hoopla for such a little horse!
"Though he be but little, he is fierce."
- What's that? What?
- That's Shakespeare, boys.
- That's Shakespeare.
- Oh, Shakespeare.
Holy cow!
Look at that, Biscuit.
Look at that.
There you go.
Oh, my God.
There he is!
Seabiscuit! Yea!
That's for you, Pops.
That's for you.
That makes six consecutive victories for this little colt from nowhere, one shy of the record.
Why, he may be the biggest sensation on four legs since Hope and Crosby.
Yes, it's standing room only every time this pint-size pony slips on a saddle, and if you can't afford the quarter, a comfy tree limb will catch you a glimpse.
So what is the secret of this rags-to-riches story?
I have it on good authority they feed Seabiscuit... two pints of ice-cold beer before every race.
Reporting from trackside in an equine exclusive,
Oh, my gosh!
- McGlaughlin, Movietone News.
- Who was that?
Ahh.
Morning.
What... What's this?
It's beer.
From an admiring public.
It's pretty good too.
There's more in there.
Where's the horse?
Signing autographs.
He what?
Here you go, Max. Let it dry for a minute before you try to sell it.
Hey, Charles.
You think he can break the record?
Oh, let's ask him.
Hey, Biscuit.
You gonna win one more?
You gonna break the record?
Hey, Charles.
What do you think finally turned this horse around?
Well, I think we just gave him a chance.
Sometimes all somebody needs is a second chance.
I think there are a lot of people out there... know just what
I'm talking about.
You got that right.
Here, boys.
Take some horseshoes with you.
- Hey, thanks.
- These are special.
- Never run out of luck.
- Great.
Sam! Where the hell are my horseshoes?
You quit?
I can't work like this.
He's not a parade animal.
He's a racehorse.
Look, Tom, a little bit of public relations...
I can't get him to be a great horse... if I can't get the time to work with him.
What do you mean?
He is a great horse.
We don't know that yet.
He's won six stakes in a row.
Against who?
This... This is a great horse.
First he smashed them in the Kentucky Derby.
Then he crushed them in the Preakness.
Then he destroyed all comers in the Belmont to snatch the Triple Crown.
At almost 18 hands, he's as big as he is fast.
Eighteen hands?
Can't be too fast a runner.
Yeah, he's big.
Born of perfect breeding, displaying perfect form, boasting a perfect record,
the millionaire Mr. Riddle may have finally created the perfect horse.
Until next time, this is
Horace Halstedter for Metrotone News.
What the hell does that mean anyway?
Perfect.
He's perfect.
What the hell does "perfect" mean?
What?
You show me something that's perfect,
I'll show you something that's not.
Look, he's obviously the best horse in the East.
We're obviously the best horse in the West.
The country deserves to see which horse is better.
Yo-ho-ho-ho!
You may not be able to see it, folks, but the gauntlet just landed on my desk.
Are we talking about a match race Mr. Howard?
Whatever Mr. Riddle wants.
Match race, stakes race, potato sack race.
Just 'cause we're littler doesn't mean we're scared.
Right you are, and in the heartland of America, every little guy knows exactly what you mean.
You hear that, Mr. Riddle?
You have an appointment with destiny, a date with...
- Destiny.
- Destiny. Yes, exactly.
So destiny, and his name is Seabiscuit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Does Seabiscuit stand a chance...
I'm glad they finally have racing in California.
Do they use
Western saddles out there?
Look.
Comparing these two horses is ridiculous.
War Admiral is a real racehorse... who's won every prestigious race in America.
This little colt of theirs is running out on some cow track.
If we responded to every fledgling challenger... who wants to make a name for themselves, it wouldn't be fair to us.
But it wouldn't be fair to them either.
You wouldn't put Jack Dempsey in the ring with a middleweight.
Huh?
Would you?
"Middleweight"?
I'll kill him.
I'll knock his goddamn block off!
- He's chicken!
- I know. I know.
- Middleweight?
- We just have to flush him out.
How?
- Well, this is still America. Right?
- Yeah.
Cash.
A hundred thousand dollars?
The biggest purse in American history.
I sure hope so.
You'd get every top
Eastern thoroughbred. All of'em!
You'd put this place on the map.
They might have all that blue blood crap.
Our money is just as good as theirs.
Charlie...
Doc, this is our moment.
Now, they're stuck in the past.
This is the future.
Great.
Come here.
What?
Come on.
Don't you wanna see 'em?
Pilin' off of those train cars.
Comin' out here to your track.
Huh? That's victory in itself.
Doc?
That's...
That's the finish line right there.
You sell cars like this?
Hundreds of'em.
Hold your horses! Hold your horses!
Just when you thought you'd seen it all,
Doc Strub has gone and raided the cookie jar.
Yes, he has smashed the piggy bank and sold the family silver.
$100,000 for one horse race?
Makes me wanna walk around on all fours and throw a saddle on my back.
Will the Biscuit be the favorite?
Not likely, folks.
We're about to be invaded.
We're talking Derby winners,
Preakness winners,
Belmont winners.
Hold on, hold on.
I guess that's all one horse.
But at 100,000 bucks, how can the Admiral not want to dock his ship... in this friendly port?
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin live from Clockers' Corner.
- They raised a hundred grand!
- Hey, how 'bout that hundred grander?
No, thanks.
Excuse me, boys.
Shit!
Charles!
Shit.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
The hell with it.
We'll run him anyway.
There are still going to be the greatest horses in the world, and if we win this thing, they're gonna have to face us.
He's gonna have to face us.
Okay. Special Agent's pure speed.
He's gonna go to the lead, but he can't handle the distance.
So don't get sucked in.
I won't.
Indian Broom could be there too.
We'll know they're holdin' him back if they use the ring bit.
Now, the one to worry about is Rosemont.
He closes like a freight train,
and he'll fight you for it at the end.
You gotta have some momentum built up... by the time he makes his move.
It's still kind of soggy out there from the other day,
so try to stay off the rail where it's deep.
I figured I'd sit back about three wide.
Yeah, that's fine.
And other than that, just... just try to feel it.
He'll tell you when he's ready.
Yeah, boy!
Come on, Red!
Ha! Ha!
Yeah, come on.
Go! Go!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Watch him. Watch him.
Come on! Come on!
It's not my fault.
Not this time.
- I told you look out for Rosemont.
- I thought I had it.
You stopped ridin'!
I couldn't see him!
What are you talkin' about?
He was flyin' up your tail!
Yeah, well, I can't...
What?
See out there!
He lied to us.
What?
He lied to us.
You want a jockey who lies to us?
What do you mean?
He can't see.
He's blind in one eye.
It's fine, Tom.
- It's fine?
- Yeah, it's fine.
"You don't throw a whole life away... just 'cause it's banged up a little bit."
Good night.
All right, all right.
Hold it.
Well, I guess that little horse of theirs... turned out to be a glorified claimer after all.
Well, at least we don't have to deal with this David and Goliath nonsense anymore.
- Huh? Huh?
- You can say that again.
- All right, boys. Let me through.
- Wait a minute. Mr. Riddle...
The hell with it.
Just a couple of announcements.
First, Red Pollard will remain
Seabiscuit's jockey, now and forever.
Second, if they're too scared to come and race us, we're gonna go find them.
We're gonna enter every race where War Admiral is on the card, and if he scratches, which he probably will, we'll enter the next race he's on the card.
And we won't come home until we've faced him, win, lose or draw.
You know,
I'd rather have one horse like this than a hundred War Admirals.
- Thanks, fellas.
Gotta see him!
Come on!
Look, I, uh...
I really don't know what to say.
Uh, we appreciate it.
I'm sure the Biscuit appreciates it too.
He's just a little shy about speaking in public.
He'd thank you himself.
I guess, uh, you all are here today... because this is a horse who won't give up.
- That's right.
- Even when life beats him by a nose.
That's right!
Ain't that the truth.
But, heck, everybody loses a couple.
Yes, sir.
And you either pack up and you go home, or you keep fighting!
Isn't that right?
Yeah!
- That's right!
- That's right.
Now,
do you want to see a match race?
Yeah!
- Yeah!
- You do?
You wanna see this young fella ridin' that horse?
- Yeah!
- Yes!
Seabiscuit!
Extra! Extra!
Biscuit on the warpath!
Will there be a match race?
It's all right here.
Extra! Extra!
Biscuit on the warpath!
I don't know what they're so worried about.
I mean, look at us.
Our horse is too small.
Our jockey's too big.
Our trainer is too old.
Forgive me, Tom.
And I'm too dumb to know the difference!
Yeah, Charlie!
You'd think they'd want to race us instead of running away!
Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am staring at a swarm of humanity, a sea of hungry faces demanding the match of a lifetime.
They have come here tonight in the cold, in the wind,
In the chill of a late
October night.
Let me just make my way over to one of them so you can hear it for yourself.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Ma'am, ma'am, if I may.
What brings you out here tonight with your three small children, clamoring for a view of this little horse?
Because we want to see a match race!
I said, don't you think...
Mr. Riddle owes this country a...
Match race!
Match race!
Match race! Match race!
Match race!
Match race! Match race!
Match race! Match race!
Fine, but it's on my terms.
Any terms you want.
Mile and 3/16 ths.
I won't accept anything else.
- All right.
- Want a walk-up start with a bell.
We won't be using any contraptions.
You mean a starting gate?
Fine.
And we run it here, at our home track.
That's not negotiable.
Mmm. Seems like a nice enough place.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find it quite comfortable, Mr. Howard.
Jesus Christ!
I wanna be a horse.
Well, you're almost big enough.
That's very funny.
It doesn't even smell like a barn.
Hmm. They probably deodorize it every morning.
Well, they still crap.
Well, they do.
They do.
Over here, pal. Right over here!
- There you go!
- This way. This way.
Biscuit, here...
Whoa!
What's that thing?
They got us in the servants' quarters.
Is that him?
No.
Bit too small.
That's him.
Oh, my God.
Maybe he's the kind of horse that just looks good in the paddock.
Wow.
We gotta get to the lead.
Biscuit never goes to the lead.
I know, but... we gotta teach him to break first.
If that monster shakes loose,
we'll never catch him.
What, retrain him?
We got two weeks.
Excuse me.
Uh, we'd like to buy your bell.
- They didn't tell me you were comin'.
- Oh, probably just an oversight.
Do you want me to turn on some lights?
No. No.
No?
Okay. It's a predatory response.
If I just brush it past his flank, he'll bolt.
We want to teach him to do it with the bell.
How far you want me to take him?
A hundred feet.
Just so he learns to break first.
Okay. Got it.
- You ready?
- Ready.
All right.
Here we go.
Oh, come on, Tom!
When you gonna work that horse out?
When he wakes up, I guess.
Geez!
For cryin' out loud!
The whole track?
I just want him to do it once... with nothin' in front of him.
- Yeah, but I can't see out there.
- That's all right. He can.
Aw, come on, Tom.
Tom, please. Wha...
Why do you always have to do this? Shit!
Oh, great.
Jesus Christ.
Wow. Huh.
Oh, my God.
- Tim.
- Hey.
Pumpkin. Hey.
How ya doin', Pumpkin?
Ohhh. Are you shy?
Hey, Red?
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah. Guess I should have used you as a jockey instead of a groom.
No, no. It was...
That was great.
Look, I-I'm in a little trouble.
I got this horse over in Annex, and I been tryin' to sell a share of him.
Tough times and all?
I was wonderin' if... if maybe you'd breeze him for me.
If folks saw
Red Pollard...
Yeah. I'll breeze your horse for you.
It's on.
Good.
Just take him for five furlongs at around a minute-one.
- Can he do that?
- Should.
Try it now.
Okay, try it again.
Whoa! Whoa!
Easy! Easy! Easy!
Aaah!
- Stop it!
- Whoa!
Look, most of the damage was restricted to his leg.
How bad is it?
God, I don't know.
It's, uh, shattered.
Eleven, 12 breaks.
Something like that.
We're gonna have to operate.
Just sit tight for me.
Well, we're all done.
He'll always limp, but, uh, it looks like he's gonna walk again.
W-Will he ride?
No, he's not gonna ride.
- Y-You're sure?
- He won't ride. He's gonna walk.
You take care.
Th... Thank you.
Hey.
Uh, you should see the other guy.
You're gonna be fine.
Couple of months, you're gonna be up and around like new.
I'm the one who makes up the stories, remember?
Well, yeah.
Uh, maybe a little longer than that.
Yeah.
Look, I, uh... I think we're gonna have to scratch.
No.
No, don't scratch.
Son, he's a great horse, but he can't run by himself.
Don't scratch.
Call Woolf.
- Son, nobody's riding...
- It's okay.
Call him.
Are you gonna scratch?
No, we're not gonna scratch.
Red Pollard wants Seabiscuit to win this race more than anything in the world.
He wouldn't let us scratch.
Thank you much.
I appreciate it.
You're welcome.
The Iceman cometh!
What a pinch hitter.
Why, it's like getting Babe Ruth off the bench.
Nerves of steel, ice water in his veins.
Why, George Woolf is...
Irrelevant.
They can get the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as far as I'm concerned.
Won't make any difference.
War Admiral is a superior horse with superior breeding.
Doesn't matter who the passenger is.
He's got a strong left lead,
Georgie.
Banks like a friggin' airplane.
He might need help switching to it, so ease him off the rail just before the turn.
- Like you did in the Gold Cup.
- Exactly.
He needs a good warm-up, so take him out slow.
When you do ask him, don't use the whip.
Just flick it twice, show him it's there.
He'll know it's time.
Right.
And, um, never on the left side.
They hit him on the left side when he was a baby.
I wish it was you, Johnny.
Aw, come on.
I'll be right there with you.
Aaah!
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya!
Great. Now, show him the stick at the quarter pole, and he'll give you a whole new gear.
Okay, now, force him to that left lead a little earlier,
and he'll give you even more.
Great, now shut the door.
Okay.
You know how Smith wants you to fight for the lead by the first turn?
Yeah. We were workin' with that bell.
- I was a little nervous about that.
- No, that's fine.
But you gotta give it up on the backstretch.
Give it up?
Give him back the lead.
He fights for it, Georgie.
If you bring him head to head with that other horse, and he looks him in the eye, there's no way he loses that race.
You just hold him through that final turn... and let him get a good look at the Admiral.
Then let him go.
It's not in his feet, Georgie.
It's right here.
By 10:00 a.m.
The closest place to park...
was 15 blocks away.
The volume of refreshments alone was staggering.
Seventeen thousand gallons of lemonade.
Sixty thousand hot dogs.
Two thousand kegs of beer.
NBC broadcast the race,
and businesses around America scheduled a half day of work...
so their employees could hear the call,
thanks, in part, to a missive fired by Mr. Howard only the day before.
Look, I know this is a fancy track and all, but I think they oughta open up the infield... so normal folks can come see the race.
You shouldn't have to be rich to enjoy something like this.
Seabiscuit entered the race a two-to-one underdog,
but you would never know it from the growing noise in the infield.
Get your program!
By the time it was over, more than 40 million Americans...
would hear the call.
Okay, it's... it's still kinda soggy at the rail,
so try to keep him out of there.
There's a dry tractor tread about five feet out off the fence.
I walked the track this morning.
Good. Good.
Now, he oughta break just like we worked on.
But, um, there's one more thing.
What? Let him catch me on the backstretch?
You're not the only one who knows this horse.
Safe trip, George.
And a short one.
Let's go, Sam.
Charley!
George. Huh.
The two jockeys have acknowledged each other.
It's a quick hello, like boxers touching gloves.
Come on, George.
This is no time for small talk.
Both the horses are now on the main track, and you can hear the roar from the crowd.
There he is!
It's Seabiscuit by a nose, now by a head.
He's leading War Admiral, pressing on him a neck behind.
They fly toward the clubhouse turn.
Who will be into it first?
It's Seabiscuit, and he was there first and driving for the backstretch!
Now, coming into the backstretch, it's Seabiscuit.
Going down the backstretch.
Now, back him off, son.
Back him off. Back him off.
Come on back, George.
Come on, come on, come on.
Now on the backstretch,
Seabiscuit still with the lead.
Come on, Georgie.
Don't fool around.
I sure hope you're right, Red.
Here we go.
Easy, Pops.
Goddamn it, Johnny.
It's now War Admiral!
It's War Admiral!
It's Seabiscuit and War Admiral, neck and neck as they go down the backstretch!
Close, Pops.
Easy, Pops.
That's it.
Whoo.
It's Seabiscuit. Now War Admiral!
Now Seabiscuit! Now War Admiral!
Not going now, Pops.
Do it.
Do it now.
Come on, George!
- Turn him loose. Turn him loose.
- Do it now, George!
So long, Charley!
Hyah!
- Turn him loose!
- Here comes Seabiscuit!
It's Seabiscuit going away!
Come on, Biscuit!
Yes! Yes! Whoo! Yes!
Congratulations.
- Amazing.
- Congratulations. - Thank you.
Iceman, you did it.
How does it feel?
Well, I just wish my good friend Red Pollard was up here today instead of me.
He will be.
This concludes our radio broadcast of the race of the century.
Now a word from our sponsor, the American Oil Company.
Money can't buy a finer motor oil...
Easy does it.
Watch it. Wa...
Watch those wheels.
All hail the conquering hero.
Yes, folks, he's back.
The little engine that could.
No more match races for this little pony because, quite frankly, they're all outta matches.
Who's he gonna race? Pegasus?
I pity these other horses. Heh.
When will they know?
I don't know.
Maybe an hour. I'm not sure.
Charles is with the vet right now.
Does it hurt when he bends it? 'Cause if it doesn't hurt when he bends it...
We don't know anything yet.
I'll call you as soon as we do.
I promise.
All right.
He was runnin' easy on me.
There was no warning.
He's gotta be all right.
He's gotta be all right.
Mr. Howard.
Well, he ruptured a whole ligament.
I put a splint on him just to keep him immobilized, but right now he's totally lame.
He's not gonna race again.
Look, um...
I know this is hard, but I'll put him down for you if you want me to.
Oh, that's okay, Pops.
I'll come to you.
Hey.
Mmm.
See, first you gotta get a little flexibility.
Yeah. Then you can put weight on it.
Then once you start to put weight on it, the whole leg gets stronger.
I know. I know.
I'm in a hurry too, Pops.
But you know what Hadrian said about Rome.
"Brick by brick, my citizens.
Brick by brick."
See, they're Arabians, so they don't need to drink.
These horses can go five or six days... without a drop of water, like a camel.
Oh. I'm not sayin' that's what you should do.
I'm just saying that's what they do.
Oh, good idea.
Take a little rest.
I don't know, Red.
We're just gonna walk in a circle.
You think the leg will hold you?
Horse weighs 1,200 pounds, Sam.
I'm an afterthought.
No, I mean your leg.
Here comes Seabiscuit charging down the lane,
picking off competition one by one.
He's third! Now second!
Now first!
And it's Seabiscuit at the wire... to win the Santa Anita Handicap with Red Pollard aboard! Yes!
Nice.
What?
Whoa!
Whoa, Pops. Easy.
Whoa.
Wow. Wow, Pops.
You feel better, don't you, boy?
It's okay, Sam.
I'm just gonna mow the lawn a little bit.
Fine with me, Red.
Way to go!
All right.
Looking good.
Yeah, you're great, man!
Whoo!
Is it even possible?
Sure.
Most folks don't give it a chance.
Most folks just...
The best thing to do is get him down there and let him gallop a little.
That's the only way we're really gonna know.
Can he handle that?
Sure.
I mean, I-I think so.
He worked great.
I couldn't feel a thing.
Why don't we give him a full work on Friday morning.
Maybe six furlongs.
See what we got.
Sure. I'll be here.
Thanks, George.
You're welcome.
Comin' along.
Could he be ready?
For what?
Come on. You know what.
Top of the morning to you.
That's, uh...
That's a nice colt. Who is he?
Just a two-year-old.
He's not ready yet.
Ah.
I thought maybe you were getting a horse ready for the hundred grander.
- No.
- Just a two-year-old.
Hair of the dog.
- You been here long?
- No. Just got here.
Catching up on my reading.
- Well, I'm sure I'll see you soon.
- Okeydokey.
Stop the presses!
Stop the presses!
This isn't a scoop, folks.
This is three scoops with hot fudge and a cherry on top.
And throw in some nuts,
'cause this little horse drives me crazy!
Guess who may be working six furlongs next Friday.
Guess who may be shooting for the Big 'Cap.
Oh, my! Saints alive!
You guessed it.
Man, oh, man!
Did you ever guess it!
A minute-12, minute-13.
Something like that.
He starts to labor, just slow it down.
Try and see how he feels...
Oh, oh. Whoa, whoa.
Got you.
That's all right, Pops.
That's okay, boy. That's okay.
Come here. It's okay.
And this, the most unkindest cut of all.
Red.
Red, let me talk to you.
- Talk to me?
- You can't... Red!
You can't do it! You could be crippled for the rest of your life.
I was crippled for the rest of my life.
I got better.
He made me better.
Hell, you made me better.
Jesus Christ.
Red...
And that's as much my horse as it is yours.
That's pretty quick.
Goddamn it.
- It's up to him, Red.
- Yeah, but if he says that I can't...
He's the doctor.
It's up to him.
You made this?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It... It wraps around my riding boot,
- fasten it all the way up the calf.
- Right.
I barely feel anything in the stirrups.
Look, it could shatter at any moment, even right now.
Forget about racing.
You see that right there?
That's barely healed.
There's no way to know how much weight it could hold under stress.
If it gets reinjured, it's possible he could never walk again.
Possible. He just said it was possible.
Well, hell, anything's possible.
We proved that already, didn't we?
- This is different.
- Yeah! This is really different.
It's not just a race.
It's the Santa Anita.
I had that race.
I was there.
I know.
♪ If I had a million dollars ♪
What's going on?
Well, even... even with the brace, it'll barely hold him.
If he gets bumped, if he gets jostled...
- Do you want to know what I think?
- Of course.
I think it's better to break a man's leg than his heart.
- It's not just the leg. It's not!
- Okay.
Mar, he could fall.
He could get trampled.
- If he gets thrown from that horse...
- He could die?
You know,
I play with this thing all the time too.
And no matter how hard I try, I can't get that damn ball to stay in the hole.
It always rolls out again.
Just let him ride, Charles.
Just let him do it.
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat, I could handle one comeback, but this is ridiculous.
Who's next... Lazarus?
Oh, the heroism, the madness, the excitement.
The largest crowd ever to see a race at Santa Anita!
Fifty-five thousand in the stands,
20,000 in the infield, and it's only 12:00!
It's not bad.
St. Christopher.
For luck.
A little late for that, don't you think?
All right.
Let's go win us a race.
Ready?
Yup.
Whichcee's the speed.
He's gonna be out on the lead, but...
I don't think he'll handle the distance.
Just stalk him like always.
Right.
Wedding Call could make a late run.
Now, he's got some guts,
so look out for him too.
Won't make that mistake again.
Relax, guys.
It's gonna be fine.
Okay.
- Charles, it's gonna be great.
- Thank you, Frank.
- Hope so.
- Bless you.
- Good luck, Mr. Howard.
- Thank you.
Good luck.
You're lookin' good.
Well, I feel fine.
Relax. Buy you a couple of drinks, huh?
That's a good idea.
Who you bettin' on?
Hey, old man.
- What are you doing here?
- Got another mount.
Just 'cause I'm not riding him doesn't mean I'm gonna sit it out.
Don't worry.
I don't stand a chance.
I'll see you at the finish.
Aaah.
Aaah.
Come on, boy.
Come on. Come on!
Hyah!
Come on! Go!
- How you doin', Red?
- Georgie.
You guys all right?
There you go, boy.
There it is.
Have a nice ride, Johnny.
Come on, Pops.
Ha! Ha!
Go on with it, Johnny!
Go on!
Come on, Red!
Whoo-hoo!
There it is, boy.
Come on, Biscuit!
You know, everybody thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him,
but we didn't.
He fixed us.
Every one of us.
And I guess, in a way,
we kind of fixed each other too.

Napoleon wrote that military blunders and domestic catastrophes...
...fanned the flames of the French Revolution.
But the coup de grâce was a palace scandal...
...involving a woman of nobility denied, a member of the royals...
...and the most magnificent string of jewels in all of Europe.
This notorious intrigue came to be known as...
...I'Affaire du Collier.
Jeanne de la Motte-Valois.
We have assembled to bring judgment on you and the other defendants...
...as instructed by His Majesty,
Louis XVl.
Before reading the record of your interrogation...
...do you care to make remarks to this judging body?
I do.
If I reached for anything that shone brilliantly...
...it was the vision of a home denied me...
...and a sense of peace
I have never known.
In the eyes of God...
...and the world...
...I wanted my life to be as it should have been.
The name Valois first became known to me many years ago.
Retraced fiive generations, it was said...
...you would come upon a king.
From this lineage, there would emerge one whom I...
...and all of France would come to know...
...Jeanne Saint-Rémy de Valois.
Jeanne.
Darnell Valois was a reformist.
A champion of the common folk.
The Valois name was associated with the resistance...
...an association one could ill afford in those tumultuous days.
Who are they, Father?
- Bring him out!
- No!
The monarchy believed the Valois name would be buried...
...with the young girl's father.
But the monarchy would prove to be wrong.
That winter, her mother's broken heart gave out.
And in an instant,
Jeanne was an orphan.
And I would cross paths with that damaged young woman...
...many years hence.
Jeanne grew up alone and accomplished it quickly.
Vowing to restore honor to the Valois name...
...she set her sights on the one person she felt could make it right...
...the queen of all France,
Marie-Antoinette.
The queen is in fine voice tonight.
The role of temptress suits her.
No doubt it is a role our Antoinette has played before.
Who might that little tart belong to?
She goes by the name la Motte...
...countess, no less.
Claims to be of the house of Valois.
- What is to be gained by that?
- Perhaps, simply, it is the truth.
What a novel approach.
I'm told she owes her position to a marriage of convenience.
Her husband comes and goes as he pleases.
- With whomever he pleases.
- The poor dear.
Her dress walks the cusp of fashion.
Two seasons ago.
Her eyes, though.
Very exciting.
Be mindful of whom you came with tonight.
As if it were possible to forget.
- Champagne, madame?
- No, thank you.
Brava, Majesty!
- Majesty.
- Majesty.
- It was an evening of triumph, yes?
- Your Majesty.
There's no need to worship at my feet.
I've only had a faint. You need not revive me from the dead.
In my years of service to the Crown...
...I'd watched them come and go.
You again?
I've told you to keep your distance from Her Majesty.
Ambitious aristocrats trouncing one another...
...to gain royal favor.
Forgive me. I was overcome by the strain of an important matter.
But she was different.
- One I feel the queen should hear.
- You and all the rest.
I've sought an audience, but I'm turned away.
Her Majesty does not care to know you.
I will hear that from her own lips.
Minister Breteuil, this is not worthy of your attention.
Allow me to attend to the countess.
See that you do.
Step aside, please.
I am Rétaux de Villette...
...your escort by command.
Ladies and gentlemen, the queen of tarts, Antoinette!
Antoinette and Madame Campan
Together they did sup
Taking turns they deeply drank
From each other's loving cup
In the hay she passed the day
With Bonnervilles and Frank
How do you think? 'Too too, ' we cry
With a wink she did reply
It never works, you know.
Little ploys to garner the queen's attention.
What's on the paper you were eager to press into her regal palm?
Has this claim of heritage been authenticated?
The king's minister of titles refuses to see me. But I know the truth.
My father's estate was usurped by the royal family.
- I wish to petition for its return.
- By accosting Antoinette?
No. Being a woman, the queen will be more sympathetic to my situation.
Once she learns of the injustice my family has endured, she will...
Please forgive me, countess.
It is so fresh, new...
...and naive.
It is remarkable how quickly you've made yourself tiresome.
De la Motte?
I knew a Nicolas de la Motte in the cavalry.
- Thank you.
- Though, at the time, he was no count.
Though it's not uncommon to buy such titles.
What you suggest is insulting.
It's less attractive coming from a common gigolo.
Well, I fancy myself quite uncommon in that respect.
You've come too far! The count has a temper. If I call out, he'll come.
And do what?
Separate you from the beloved tools of your trade.
How disagreeable.
He's back, then?
I saw him a week ago in Rambouillet.
Strange, though, he seemed ensconced with an actress from the Comédie.
You inserted yourself in this.
How do you propose to take your leave?
- Have you any suggestions?
- Find a use for yourself.
Quickly.
At court, to obtain your desires, you must know what others desire.
- And you have such knowledge?
- It's my second greatest talent.
The countess' entry into court coincided with another...
...significant arrival.
It was an amazing extravagance.
A glorious tribute...
...to the vanity of man.
This is the culmination of my life.
Its combined weight is no less than 2,800 carats.
Well, Monsieur Böhmer, it is a marvel.
Thank you.
Bassenge and I have put our souls into it.
And every livre you possess,
I'll wager.
We incurred some debt purchasing the stones.
I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding a buyer.
Our hope has always been that it would find its place with you.
How curious!
It was suggested to me that it was destined for Madame du Barry.
See to her needs.
- Madame du Barry?
- That trollop...
...my husband's grandfather maintained.
Well, I-
I pray the whispers are mere court gossip.
Otherwise, du Barry's banishment would find you without a buyer.
If you would permit, we are...
...foggy on the exact order of events.
If Her Majesty would...
...try the necklace on?
Perhaps...
It is a phenomenon.
Still, I decline.
We are the appointed jewelers to Her Majesty.
Our reputations will be shattered if we seek buyers.
I did not commission the necklace.
I do not wish to acquire it.
- I need explain myself no further.
- I-
Shh! No, no. Shh!
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.
You handled that well.
- I know not to speak.
- A lot of help...
He won't see me. I've tried.
Why should today be different?
Because the minister of titles' aunt...
...is an acquaintance.
I am aware of your presence.
I can hear you thinking.
Thank you for seeing me.
You don't know how long I've waited for this opportunity.
Please tell me.
Have you considered my petition?
It is unusual for you to come on your own behalf.
In my experience, women don't possess the temperament for negotiations.
It is more appropriate to discuss this with the Count de la Motte.
The count is in Rambouillet.
In any event, it's my lineage
I wish to have authenticated.
It is my family's home
I wish returned.
Your petition places me in a difficult position.
Your father was prone to stirring up parliament.
He spoke out against poverty and tyranny.
He was a treacherous liar.
He only wanted to better the world.
If there were more like him-
- Forgive me.
- He railed against the monarchy.
That will never be tolerated.
You know the importance of a God-given name...
...and a home in which it can flourish.
It defines us.
No doubt your request comes from the heart.
- But there are higher considerations.
- I implore you!
If I have no legacy to pass on, the name of Valois dies with me.
In the eyes of the royal family, that would not be unfavorable.
This royal office...
...will not grant your petition.
It never will.
I can't accomplish what I came to do.
Proper channels be damned.
The royal family had been well aware of this meeting.
By crushing her hopes, they sought to end the Valois legacy...
...and all that it stood for.
It's really quite simple.
To influence the minister of titles, you must first have influence.
Hence, lesson one, the benefactor.
Perfect. The Marquis de Favras.
A most generous man with a most generous appetite. For young men.
The Comte de Blonde, keeper of the royal seals.
Wealthy, powerful...
...and enthusiastically pursues all members of the female gender.
For what reason I cannot imagine. He's as virile as an empty sausage skin.
- And him?
- Ah, yes, Pierre Charron.
He has killed four men, loves a hunt and despite his flirtations...
...maintains but a single lover...
...his benefactor, the Marquis de Favras.
Lechers and parasites.
Is that all there is?
Welcome to court.
Here, appearance is everything.
And I mean no offense, countess, but yours is lacking.
Your dress and living arrangements must improve.
Plainly, you need money.
To obtain it...
...find favor with someone who has it.
Rétaux, my precious!
Look, ho!
Three sensual sirens of the sea.
How long will you suffer the whims of old women?
Suffer? I bring joy to venerable ladies. I'm often-
You evade the question, monsieur.
I shall stop suffering the whims of older women when...
...someone more intriguing enters my world.
Am I to suppose you have no one you care for now?
There was one. The self-proclaimed
Duchess de Vossi.
In truth, a courtesan of the highest stature.
She entertained only the noble elite in her bed of pleasures.
Mother.
She taught me the intricacies of court life.
From the noblemen that came to our rooms I observed manner and wit.
Who can say? One of these fops bobbling past us now...
...could well be my father.
An amusing thought at best.
How skillfully you play the rogue.
Yet even you cannot mask such impenetrable loneliness.
Are we that much alike, countess?
Next lesson.
Always choose a benefactor of noble means.
For instance, Louis de Rohan...
...cardinal of all France and blood prince of the infamous house of Rohan.
He is a debaucher of legendary proportions.
His parties are lavish, orgiastic affairs.
They've arrived. One hour late as required by royalty.
This should be entertaining.
Why such a chill between him and the queen?
Years ago, on a pilgrimage,
Rohan bedded half the Austrian court.
He jested Antoinette's mother had begged her turn.
This slander got back to her.
She never forgave him.
- Despite his efforts to heal the rift.
- He needs her approval?
He wishes to follow Richelieu and become prime minister.
Antoinette blocks his progress?
At every turn.
It's all right. Come out, my dear.
Let me introduce Colleen.
This lady is a maid of the queen's private quarters.
I have come as you requested.
They would cut my hands off if I were caught.
But de Villette was so heartfelt in his request, I could not refuse.
Countess, unbeknownst to Her Majesty...
...you are about to become her closest confidant.
My curiosity about Your Eminence...
My curiosity about Your Eminence...
A rare miss, Your Eminence.
You distracted me.
Then I've fulfilled my obligation as a woman.
- I am unfamiliar with you.
- You're right, I've intruded.
My curiosity about Your Eminence overcame my sense of formality.
What could ignite such curiosity?
I have heard it said you are a man of copious desires.
Some desires run deeper than others.
I accompany the queen most days at Versailles.
These are letters she wrote when I was abroad.
Why bring them to my attention?
The damaged feelings between you are well-known...
...but old wounds may be healing.
- The queen has said as much?
- It's intuition on my part.
But with subtle persuasion, you could make progress with Her Majesty.
And you will apply these gentle pressures in return for what?
Your Eminence's gratitude is all I require.
And...
...your patronage, from time to time.
Your offer is compelling.
But I must decline.
You're likely a fraud.
The court is riddled with them.
And a man of my office is often a target.
That you should doubt my veracity is indeed a hurtful blow.
I've upset you.
Abel, please, leave us.
I wish to offer a word of comfort in private.
I was wrong to come here.
I see that now.
Yet you are here.
I cannot be comfortable with a man who doubts me.
In times of doubt...
...prayer is the answer.
Kneel before me.
I will rest my hands on your shoulders...
...and we'll pray together.
I respectfully decline, Your Eminence.
I'm the cardinal of all France.
If the cardinal of all France wishes you to pray with him...
...you'll do so.
Come.
You will not hold back.
Pray deeply...
...and with conviction.
Your Eminence.
No. I-
- Where'd you get this?
- Antoinette's chambers.
She does the embroidery herself.
I've noticed them.
A reminder of what could have been.
Wait!
Maybe there is a way.
A means by which to verify your claim.
It so happens I have taken under my patronage an extraordinary man.
He is grand master of the Illuminati, the German mystic elite.
He is an accomplished alchemist and mesmerist...
...who claims to have conquered disease and death several times over.
His visions and prognostications have proven accurate time and again.
Count Cagliostro...
...we are honored.
I sense many of you have questions for me...
...that concern love, fate, even betrayal.
But these answers will have to wait.
I'm drawn to a face that's new.
You seek an alliance with the cardinal, yes?
I'm certain many people bring favorable offers before His Eminence.
But your alliance is what concerns us tonight.
Comtesse de la Motte.
I haven't spoken a word about you to this man. He truly is a marvel.
Or particularly well-informed.
You doubt my abilities?
I sense such turmoil within you.
I sense fear as well.
I am not afraid.
This is one of the more delightful evenings I've spent in a catacomb.
Early on...
...you learned to hide what you feel.
You've had great losses in your life.
Shall I go deeper?
There is no one here who hasn't lost something which can't be replaced.
You were taken in by strangers, then cast aside.
Always, you were on the outside looking in...
...longing for that which was taken from you.
Still...
...that's not what hurt most.
I see you...
...hovering over a cold grave...
...wishing it were your own...
...but it was not.
Was it?
Comtesse?
A grave...
...dug for your mother's coffin.
Have I gone far enough?
Well, then, who's next?
Oh, that's working splendidly.
Smooth and even, monsieur.
A job done with conscientiousness is a job that endures.
Yes, Majesty.
If he directed government like that,
France would rule the world.
Maman, watch me, watch me!
They are such a comfort to me.
A wonderful distraction.
- I heard there were more disturbances.
- A small gathering of malcontents.
- How small a gathering?
- Nearly 200.
- No doubt my name was used in vain.
- Arrests were made, naturally.
Why do the people hate me?
It wasn't always so.
Your Majesty is not the source of the animosity.
You're merely a symbol to aim it at.
You show fantastic audacity in seeking me out.
Though I knew you would.
Did you denounce me to the cardinal?
I told him that despite your troubled past...
...I did sense an opportunity.
If you'd like my visions of you to remain positive, share...
...in what you gain from the cardinal.
I was caught off guard by the intimate details you knew about my life.
And then I realized the Marquise Boulainvilliers...
...a charitable woman who took me in as a child, she was superstitious.
Magicians and mesmerists often entertained in her parlor.
What is that to me?
A person of your colorful nature may have found their way into her home.
In the course of your prognostications...
...you may have asked her a few questions.
If you'd like to trade secrets in front of the cardinal...
...keep in mind I have his confidence.
Also, the court is full of people...
...who would tear you to pieces if I fed them enough lies.
Be careful.
I've done this a long time.
That is precisely why I will do it.
I have nothing to lose.
Keep him interested in me and you will share in the rewards.
But remember that our fates will now be joined as one.
I sense a surprising alliance on the horizon.
Long life, countess.
To Louis de Rohan, cardinal of France.
It has come to mind that the silence between us...
...has gone on far, far too long.
Excellency, Jeanne de la Motte...
"An apology would seem the proper starting point...
...if we are to mend damaged feelings. "
A prince of the house of Rohan apologize? It's never been done.
For years you've anguished.
She hasn't given you a look or a word.
You now hold a letter from her of the most affable nature.
Yes, well, I submit Antoinette's loathing of me has become somewhat...
...more than an irritation.
You need not suffer anymore.
If I acquiesced, would the reply be delivered by your hand?
It would reach Her Majesty no other way.
Very well.
A note of credit will be advanced to you in the sum of 5,000 gold louis.
Twenty thousand would seem more appropriate.
Are you attempting to bargain with me?
Not long ago, a young woman much like yourself...
...attempted to extort money from me.
She came forth with claims of having experienced...
...some mistreatment at my hands.
Her accusations were, of course, unfounded.
She was the niece of the captain of my private guard.
One night, her uncle slipped into this young woman's room...
...with a very sharp blade.
He slit the poor girl from her genitalia...
...to the dimple on her pretty chin.
Do you know why a man would do such a thing to his own kin?
Because I told him to.
Never test my good nature, countess.
I must ask that Your Eminence be mindful.
I can shatter this correspondence as easily as I formed it.
The cardinal's threat inspired renewed communications from Antoinette.
Dearest Rohan...
In time, His Eminence made clear his wish to meet the queen in private.
I'm anxious for reconciliation.
My earnest cardinal...
For the hopeful countess and her devotee...
...keeping the cardinal at arm's length drew them even closer.
You may count on my discretion.
Yet, as Rohan's correspondence with the queen grew more intimate...
- Your devoted cardinal.
- Your devoted queen.
...those on the streets of Paris saw Her Majesty...
...in a far different light.
Antoinette responded by cloistering herself...
...behind the gilded gates of Versailles.
In that privileged asylum, it's little wonder the queen failed to notice...
...a burgeoning threat in her very midst.
- Is that the Countess de la Motte?
- What caused the transformation?
I've heard that Antoinette has taken the countess under her wing.
Monsieur de Villette informs me that they've become ever so close.
In the beginning, it was my intent to simply use you.
A confession.
This is a fragile moment.
Yet somewhere along the journey...
...I have come to rely on you.
I have never felt that way about anyone.
Nicolas! How dare you?
It is seldom a man gets to watch his wife make love from...
...that vantage point.
You are not welcome here.
Go back to your actress.
Upon hearing of your change in fortunes, my affections rekindled.
In a blink, she seemed drab and common, whereas...
...you were once again my reason to live.
I've missed your touch.
Nicolas. Do not do this.
To what do you refer, my cherished?
- Let's sort this out in another way.
- What happened, Rétaux?
Did you grow weary of plowing your way through the old women?
It was bound to happen, I suppose.
Forgive me! I heard a noise and I took the gun from your bag!
- Rosalie, you've just shot my husband!
- Oh, God!
Goddamn!
Are you digging for potatoes? Go easy!
I didn't tell you how to get this projectile in.
Do not presume to tell me how to get it out.
Goddamn!
- It is lodged in the fleshy tissues.
- Madame, there's a gentleman here.
- How lovely. Monsieur Bassenge.
- Madame.
To what do I owe the honor?
Oh, dear. One of the menials is having a tooth drawn.
- It's never a pleasant procedure.
- No.
- Please sit. Will you take some port?
- That's very kind, thank you.
Monsieur Böhmer could not join me.
He is in his sickbed over the matter about which I wish to speak.
I pray his discomfort is not serious.
This burden has leeched the very will to live out of a formerly robust man.
If I can improve the situation, you may rely on me.
It has come to my attention that you have influence with Antoinette.
On certain issues.
Then I'd like to make you aware of a rather lucrative proposition.
I must ask you keep this in strict confidence.
My lady.
We would like you to re-introduce the idea of the necklace to Her Majesty.
If a bargain were struck, be assured of a commission.
- A very generous commission.
- Please, countess, won't you help us?
The interest alone on what we paid for the diamonds is ruining us.
And so there was a fateful meeting.
The countess born by the grace of God...
...and the necklace formed by the hand of man.
One without the other could do little harm.
But together...
It was fantastic, wasn't it?
That necklace could vastly improve a person's situation.
- Are we not blessed with a benefactor?
- Rohan?
No, this is a very dangerous idea.
A charming fellow once told me something worthwhile.
The way to get to what you desire is to know what everyone else desires.
The jewelers know only the queen can relieve them of their creation.
Then we have our benefactor, Louis de Rohan, cardinal of all France.
He desires the one thing his wealth can't acquire, the prime ministership.
But what he doesn't realize is the queen secretly desires the necklace.
So if Rohan could somehow make the transaction possible...
...the jewelers would have a home for the necklace with the queen.
Brilliant, but one tiny flaw.
The queen doesn't desire the necklace.
You really must keep abreast of current events, my love.
It would seem Her Majesty has had a change of heart.
Why does Antoinette wish to obtain this brutish trinket...
...in such secrecy?
Such an extravagance could cause further unrest among the people.
Then why ensnare His Eminence in such a venture?
She seeks a discreet intermediary.
One who can be a guarantee to the jeweler...
...should she be forced by circumstances to default on her payment.
I beg your pardon, Your Eminence.
Mademoiselle Subur has arrived...
...for her religious tutorial.
Escort her to my private chapel.
I'll be along momentarily.
You've improved your position with the queen. Help her...
...and the path to the prime minister's post will be short.
I've grown tired of treading that path on my hands and knees.
- What do you have to say?
- I do sense an opportunity.
Stay the course.
No. No!
I've denounced my own character in writing.
I've paid you exorbitantly to exert your influence.
Yet my every request has been ignored.
Unless I meet Her Majesty...
...our arrangement is over.
Now if you'll excuse me...
...an eager young mind awaits.
This is an opportunity that may never come again.
With the necklace, I have a chance to take back what was-
I have a chance to get my home back.
It's all I ever wanted.
If I could bring it back for you,
I would. But honestly, I do not-
If the cardinal wishes to meet the queen, he should meet the queen.
You're naughty.
Let's say we convince Rohan to act as guarantor for the necklace.
What'll happen when no payment's made by Antoinette?
I imagine the eye of Rohan will turn our way.
Yes, and shit will rain upon us in biblical amounts.
I'm not interested in being his catch basin.
Nor am I. But to implicate us would expose his own part in the scandal.
Don't you think he'd pay off the jewelers to cover up the affair?
Yes, I'm sure he would.
Then have our throats cut in a dark and disagreeable place.
Yes, I have thought about that unpleasant eventuality.
I feel we could persuade him that forgiveness is his only recourse.
What do you propose we do about Nicolas? He could betray us.
Not if we bring him into the fold.
As hypocritical as it sounds...
...he may even be of help to us.
Please.
I'll speak with him alone.
He'll be more receptive.
Oh, yes, I'm sure he will be.
I knew something grand was afoot.
Rest assured I'll be an asset to this.
You can best help by showing restraint.
It will be important that all seems normal in this household.
I like that part very much.
What role does the gigolo play though?
Will he be an out-of-town cousin?
Rétaux will do his part. You need only concentrate on not being yourself.
Don't be angry with me.
I am the way I am.
You know as well as I, our marriage has always been an arrangement.
You needed a title to gain access to the royal court.
You took me on because
I bought you that title.
I've never been more than a stepping stone in your eyes.
No. I saw something worthy in you at one time.
Even gallant.
I wanted nothing more than to make it a real marriage.
Perhaps we could have that now.
But you see, now it is an arrangement.
All that remained was to secure the final conspirator.
The perfect man for the job was dispatched with haste.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Are you alone?
- Not now.
"Not now. "
I have a proposition for you.
This is more intrigue than I bargained for.
The king's in Paris.
It has to be tonight.
You are to wait here.
I must confess, I am nervous.
My God, I'm shaking.
Give Her Majesty time to gaze upon you.
If she feels it is right, she'll signal.
- I understand.
- Be ready to flee at a moment's notice.
Say only what we've rehearsed.
And have confidence.
- It is only acting, yes?
- Yes, but it must be convincing.
- We have the grove to ourselves.
- Excellent!
- Is that necessary?
- Yes, it is necessary.
- The wound on my ass is barking!
- And you deserve it.
Forgiveness is a rose without thorns.
If I have offended Your Majesty,
I've suffered for it.
This is not necessary.
I remember your first day at Versailles.
You were a young girl of 14...
...with sweet rosebud lips.
I was a young bishop then, and well-liked.
I felt a connection between that young girl and that young man.
- It transcended curiosity.
- I remember.
Get away, you dirty boy.
Someone's in the garden.
There's someone else in the garden.
We must go. Now!
- What was that?
- Guards of the palace!
Follow me! Intruder on the grounds!
Follow me!
This way!
- Come on!
- I say we separate. You go that way.
You there! Stand fast where you are!
Come back!
Stop for nothing.
There's a trail through the marsh!
He passed by here. I'm certain!
You there, search the bank!
Go find these bastards!
- You've attempted to deceive me.
- Deceive you?
Don't play games with me.
Your Majesty.
I know what you're up to.
Antoinette is secretly in love with me.
Deny it if you will.
But don't ask me to play the fool.
My dearest Antoinette:
Our meeting at the grove was for me...
...like the end of an epic journey.
To hear from Her Majesty's lips such words...
And so, a bargain was struck.
The queen intended to pay for the necklace...
...in two months' time, on the day of the Feast of the Assumption.
As guarantor, the cardinal was at risk for a considerable sum.
When concern crept in, the cardinal sought a higher power.
You wish to ascertain if the risk is warranted?
Caesar had dream interpreters.
Hannibal utilized stargazers and soothsayers.
Great men of destiny need those who can see...
...beyond their own grand vision.
Behold.
I gaze into sanctified waters.
I see a woman.
She places an object around your neck.
It is made of gold.
Cagliostro spun a divine prognostication.
Did my vision hold meaning for you?
The seal of the prime minister is in the form of a medallion.
A medallion of pure gold.
Long life, my friend.
- Did all go well?
- I was brilliant, of course.
From the queen.
It is a dispatch from Her Majesty.
The item of interest is to be turned over to her messenger.
- Do you have confidence in him?
- His name is Argille.
He attends the queen's chambers.
May I?
I'm responsible for this object to the sum of one million gold louis.
Do you have confidence in this man?
Answer carefully.
You will be held accountable.
Monsieur Argille is not without faults.
Yet when it comes to his devotion, no one can compare.
You'll no doubt reap untold rewards for what you've done.
To Jeanne, the whole necklace was not as glorious...
...as what its parts could yield.
It was a means to an end.
And though I will not justify the actions of the young countess...
...I later came to understand her reasoning.
Who does not aspire to take back what was taken from them?
Who does not dream of returning home?
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Jeanne, you promised to take me for a ride today.
Have you forgotten?
My dear wayward countess:
It's been weeks since my meeting with Her Majesty...
...and still I've not heard a word.
Your continued absence from Paris has put me ill at ease.
Wherever you may be, I trust you spend your time furthering my cause.
With the Feast of the Assumption upon us...
...I must insist you correspond soon...
...and apprise me of Her Majesty's disposition.
Until then, I shall keep my anxious thoughts at bay...
...with my duties of providing the people...
...with spiritual guidance.
- For the evening.
- Brocade, is it?
- The finest.
- Very nice. What else?
I'll see it all.
Everything, everything.
With your eyes.
- And, of course...
- Is this your daughter?
- Yes, count, my eldest.
- You're very lovely.
Have you ever considered life in the theater?
The plasterer couldn't reach that high edifice.
I designed a system of pulleys so he could be elevated.
Fascinating, Your Majesty.
Stunningly resourceful.
Compliments of Böhmer and Bassenge jewelers.
It is a bejeweled amulet.
A token of our appreciation for your patronage these many years.
That jeweler has been grinning like a jackal all afternoon. Now this.
"Madame, we are at the pinnacle of happiness with our arrangement.
We take satisfaction in knowing the most beautiful creation...
...will adorn the most exemplary of queens. "
I'm not sure what to make of it.
I think only one explanation will suffice.
Monsieur Böhmer has gone quite mad.
Her Majesty was at times conveniently naive...
...and I wanted to count the incident as just another act of a fool.
But in a growing climate of unrest, no one could be trusted.
Debauchers and whores in fine silk!
The king and that harlot,
Antoinette...
...drain the life's blood of our national character!
Oh, God.
Quite a lot of excitement.
Yes. Desmoulins speaks with such fiery passion.
Fiery passion happens to be the very attribute I hold most dear.
- Pardon me, monsieur.
- Yes?
I wasn't bothering the mademoiselle.
A few of the merchants inform me that you've been selling diamonds.
I'm a licensed broker of precious stones.
I trade frequently here and in Amsterdam.
Then monsieur wouldn't mind producing credentials.
Of course.
They're in my rooms at the hotel.
Care to accompany me there to clear this up?
- I think we should.
- Well, then.
A striking outfit. Very sharp.
Stop!
Sainted mother of Jesus!
I nearly soiled myself.
Clever to run back here.
That way they can have us all.
Shut up or I'll cut that tongue!
- Get off me!
- Nicolas!
You've had a scare.
I know you're upset...
...but you must maintain your temper, please.
You won't sell diamonds in Paris anymore.
Agreed?
Say it!
Agreed.
We must leave the country.
Once this unravels...
...Rohan'll have our heads staked.
Let us not forget the cardinal's letters to the queen.
This one proclaiming his love would be damaging.
Suppose the cardinal doesn't give a damn?
We've laid our plans.
Now we must trust in them.
Jeanne would have to enter into a new arrangement with the cardinal.
Patronage to blackmail.
Colleen?
The cardinal is about to find out he was the victim of a fraud.
Then he'll want blood.
But he'll be told, should harm come to us, these letters...
...will get to the house minister.
It's too dangerous.
I will not be a part of this.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I wanted to properly thank you...
...for this very important task.
Your trusted servant, countess.
Dear Monsieur Böhmer:
I'm a friend who writes to warn you...
...of a plot involving yourself,
Cardinal Rohan...
...and a particular necklace.
Antoinette has no interest in the necklace.
When Cardinal Rohan realizes this...
...he'll no longer stand as guarantor.
The countess knew Monsieur Böhmer to be a man of nervous disposition.
She felt he'd head straight to Cardinal Rohan.
Once the cardinal realized he'd been duped...
...he would pay off the jewelers to avoid humiliation.
History would have proven her plan sound...
...had a certain individual's suspicions...
...not come into play.
Give way, we have important business!
Are you deaf?
Give way!
Minister Breteuil.
What an unexpected appearance.
- You've been acting strangely.
- I act no differently than always.
Where are you going?
Pressing engagement with a confidential client.
Urgent rendezvous, secretive clientele?
I had no idea your position was so full of intrigue.
You'll never find a more clandestine profession.
I'm fascinated, Monsieur Böhmer.
I want to learn more.
It makes perfect sense.
What better occasion than the feast to announce the new prime minister?
You think so?
Why else would the king and queen summon you in such a manner?
It is an historic day for the house of Rohan.
Extremely historic, Your Eminence.
You look troubled, Your Eminence.
Nothing must mar this day.
I want my mind clear to enjoy what I have so courageously earned.
There's something we must do.
Under what conditions was this statement made?
A verbal interrogation. It lasted all of a minute before Böhmer...
...gushed forth what he knew like a ruptured water gut.
Do you deny your participation in this?
No.
- Do you disagree with anything?
- I do not.
Then you admit you used the queen's good name...
...to acquire this necklace for your own gains?
For my own gains?
I most vehemently deny it,
Your Majesty!
How could you believe that I would choose you as my emissary?
You, to whom I have not addressed a word in nearly 10 years.
Do you not remember, Your Majesty?
Your behavior shows something familiar I do not care for.
Countess.
Leave us.
I beseech you. For the sake of the good name of my family...
- ... hush this matter up until-
- The king gave his instructions.
- Leave the chamber.
- It was the countess.
- You see, she-
- Leave the chamber.
How dare you touch me?
What insult is this?
- The king has ordered your arrest.
- That's impossible.
I advise you not to make a scene.
What the countess had so daringly conceived...
...now began to unravel at a frightening pace.
And those of dubious character were quick to distance themselves.
I heard news in Paris.
- Rohan was sent to the Bastille.
- His cell will be the best they have.
He has most certainly implicated us.
I won't leave. The name is spoken with respect again. I won't diminish-
To hell with the name!
It will do you no good-
Then go, Rétaux!
I haven't asked you to stay.
Please tell me, madame.
Conspiracy was not all that held us together?
Save yourself. I want you to.
Who will protect you if I go?
Nicolas? If it comes to it, he'll give you up to save himself.
You needn't concern yourself with Nicolas.
- Nicolas!
- He's taken his leave!
- Let him go, please!
- No!
Stay away.
Please, you must not remain here.
Come away with me now.
What's there in a name that is worth your life?
Tell me, Jeanne!
I cannot see the reason!
It only matters that I see it.
Please try to understand.
Jeanne de la Motte-Valois?
You have the honor, monsieur.
As the gossip spread, the people were quick to believe...
...that Antoinette, the cardinal and the necklace were joined as one...
...in a circle of lust and deceit.
Thieves, the two of you!
I think the case must be tried in open parliament.
That would be a mistake.
It is within the king's right to pass judgment.
Why place it in unsympathetic hands?
The people only respect the judgment of parliament.
If it convicts Rohan as the sole perpetrator...
- ... my name will be absolved.
- And if they acquit him?
Isn't that saying you are guilty?
His Majesty is correct.
You could not be tried...
...but the guilt would fall to you all the same.
Public vindication, house minister.
I will accept nothing less.
Your thoughts, house minister.
The queen offers up a sweet plum before ravens.
Pray none takes a bite.
Jeanne's arrest fueled the hysteria surrounding the necklace conspiracy.
Some saw the countess as a cunning opportunist...
...others as an unwitting pawn of the monarchy.
Dearest countess:
Before the eye of suspicion turns my way...
...I think it is in my best interest to make a hasty departure.
I do wish you a positive outcome in the trial.
Having said that, it is my sincere hope that I never see you again.
Farewell, countess...
...for France has seen the last of Count Cagliostro.
The count's departure took him no further...
...than his own front door, where he was promptly arrested...
...and delivered to his new accommodations, the Bastille.
On this, the 22nd day of May, 1786...
...the matter of the Crown versus
Cardinal de Rohan...
...and Jeanne Valois,
Countess de la Motte...
If I reached for anything that shined brilliantly...
...it was for the home denied me and the peace I've never known.
In the eyes of God and the world...
...I wanted my life to be as it should've been.
How was it that you entered into this arrangement?
I am aware of forces at work against me.
The cardinal said you were in collusion...
- a ruse to hide your true intent.
I can think of no misdeed to account for my arrest.
Trickery is his only gift.
He used it with Jeanne de la Motte to manipulate me.
Daily reports to Her Majesty became a ritual...
...and pressure for a favorable outcome, a royal obsession.
After I relinquished the necklace...
...Count de la Motte visited a brokerage.
My investigators tell me that he sold to the owner four diamonds.
We must have proof of your charges.
Can you provide any tangible evidence?
Yes. The letters from the queen.
The countess must've forged them somehow.
Produce them then.
I am- I am unable to do so.
It was the day of the Feast of the
Assumption when this horror began.
I assumed I'd receive the prime ministership.
To protect Her Majesty,
I ordered the letters to be burned.
It was only after my arrest...
...I realized I had destroyed the only evidence that could clear my name.
If I might be allowed more time,
I could gather-
Did you presume while you sat idle in the Bastille, I was idle as well?
Your veil, please.
Cardinal Rohan, is this the woman you encountered in the grove?
Yes, I'm certain of it.
Mademoiselle, state your name, please.
Nicole Leguay d'Oliva.
A common street performer?
- Has this become public?
- Regrettably, yes.
The news sheets are having a day of it.
Rohan and the Countess de la Motte must suffer for this.
Do not fail me, Breteuil.
Revealing the queen's impersonator aided the cardinal's cause...
...but it was not without forethought.
By doing so, I was able to employ one more bit of skullduggery.
Aren't you curious to know how we found Nicole d'Oliva?
One of your coconspirators was arrested.
He instructed us on where to find the impostor.
He has made us aware of your notes written in the name of the queen.
He stated when the cardinal realized the notes were forgeries...
...he fell in with your plans to steal the necklace.
- Who is this person?
- No. Wait!
This is a ruinous lie!
This is a treacherous machination!
Who is this person?
Where are they?
He has expressed the desire not to see you.
During a trial, is it not my right to confront any accuser?
My love.
My dear countess.
If I'd known I'd be receiving, I might have done something with myself.
What have they done?
I have it on good authority Nicolas made it to Austria.
He's beyond their reach.
They practiced humiliations upon me...
...I could not allow to continue.
Perhaps a man less vain would not have relented.
Everyone gives in at the last.
Forgive me, Jeanne.
Forgive me or I cannot live with myself!
I love you, Rétaux.
That should have been enough.
I'm sorry.
The house minister visits the Bastille.
Surely not a social call.
Before the sentences are rendered...
...you will have a chance to sign a confession.
Implicate Cardinal Rohan to the crime...
...in a clear manner.
I will not.
It would seem to be your only chance for salvation.
You have an engaging smile, countess.
Though now seems a curious time to make use of it.
I was just thinking how strange it is,
Your Majesty.
Of all the times
I have sought you...
...in the end you complete the effort.
I merely felt compelled to look upon the architect of such chaos.
It must be you.
Rohan is not clever enough.
- That is for parliament to say.
- Stay where you are, Breteuil!
You have damaged my reputation and I mean to know why.
Speak the truth.
What disservice have I ever done the likes of you?
You ignored me.
To offer a word of advice would have cost you but a few breaths...
...and it would have meant the world to me.
There can be no doubt I would have traveled a different path.
You must now consider the broader consequences of this matter.
If you weaken the monarchy, you undermine the entire nation.
You weakened yourselves long before a diamond necklace became the issue.
I've seen what I came to see.
Your Majesty.
I did not set out to harm you.
As concern the charges of theft and conspiracy...
...the decisions rendered by this body of judges...
...shall be carried out this day without hesitation or appeal.
Count Cagliostro.
You are hereby acquitted...
...on the grounds of insufficient evidence.
You are to be considered exonerated by this body of judges.
A wise and a just decision.
Marc-Antoine Rétaux de Villette.
By the Court of France...
...you have been found guilty...
...and are condemned to banishment for life...
...from the kingdom of France.
All of your possessions are to be forfeited to the king.
The judgment of parliament is final.
Justice has been served.
Cardinal Louis de Rohan...
...grand almoner of France and prince of the house of Rohan.
This body of judges...
...acquits you on all charges without reprimand.
You are hence to be considered completely exonerated.
Order, please.
Jeanne de la Motte-Valois.
Your verdict has been rendered...
...but will not be read at this time.
You are to be detained here in the Conciergerie...
...until informed otherwise.
The countess' verdict was delayed by order of the king himself.
His Majesty feared the people...
...and how they may react when told of Jeanne's fate.
Meanwhile, Rohan's vindication sent a clear message to Versailles.
They vindicate Rohan to cause me anguish.
It is an affront to my womanhood!
Do not do this to yourself, I beg you!
Parliament doesn't believe...
...my character is free of scandal.
I will give them what they want.
I will live here quietly in my disgrace.
It's what they've always wanted!
Though Antoinette wasn't on trial...
...the people saw her as guilty of excess...
...greed and worst of all...
...indifference.
Countess.
It's time.
Jeanne de la Motte-Valois.
You have been found guilty on all charges.
Before her sentence was read...
...the countess was allowed to address the court...
...one last time.
Whatever fate awaits me...
...it cannot compare to the pain that I...
When all you hold dear is taken...
...and you have nothing left...
...risk is of little consequence.
When a ray of hope came into view,
I reached for it.
With all my might.
I realize...
I realize now that it is too late...
...that honor does not live in a name.
It comes from what you carry in your heart.
V.
Voleur. The mark of a thief.
And so ended the life of Marie-Antoinette.
I did not see the queen's demise...
...as I had long since fled the horrors of the new regime.
Though rumors circulated as to the eventual fate of the countess...
...the truth was rather common and sad.
She was taken to a woman's prison of the most horrible conditions...
...where she languished for nearly two years.
"We heard rumors but had no idea of the changes taking place.
It was not until I effected my escape and reached England... "
It was there, in England...
...she published her memoirs.
And for a brief moment found the acceptance that had eluded her...
...for so many years.
- A remarkable account.
- Thank you.
How sad to be separated from home.
Will you ever return to France?
I should like to someday.
Jeanne Saint-Rémy de Valois...
...the woman who helped topple a monarchy, never returned to France.
She died in a fall from the window of a London hotel.
Some claimed it was an act of revenge by agents of the royal family.
The truth was never known.
DEDICATED TO THOSE
WHO LIVED THROUGH THESE EVENTS
SAFE CONDUCT
She's coming. Hop to it!
Got the flowers?
I was taking them up.
Clear the whole floor.
Everybody out of sight! Move it!
Come back in 5 minutes!
Just one minute.
Like last Tuesday.
Carnations? Not for an actress!
I told you!
She'll murder me! Marcel, help me!
She's here, ladies!
To your rooms, please!
Him and his dame!
What a fuss he makes!
You don't know who this "dame" is!
Everyone knows. It's Suzanne Raymond.
I saw her movies...
Please, out of sight, all of you!
Shoo!
If you need cigs...
Maybe later. In you go.
Take care of that cough.
Out of sight! Thanks!
Shoo!
Not again!
Got the champagne?
Snap to it!
What a mess!
What did I do to deserve this?
See him? The Kraut in room 25.
Get in here.
He threatened me again.
Someday I'll sock him.
Aren't you gorgeous!
These things... always happen to you.
Gorgeous, gorgeous...
You smell so sweet.
What a pretty little puppy nose, nice and cold.
True, I'm freezing.
God, what a winter!
What a winter!
Think so?
See how I slipped in?
Nobody saw me.
But still,
I felt so sad.
So sad.
- I didn't get the part.
- What part? Why?
The Cayatte movie. The False Mistress.
Can I have some tea?
Steaming hot tea?
Better than tea...
Champagne!
Champagne's too cold.
But it's a cold that warms.
Tea.
Tea?
Then tea it is.
Darrieux will get it.
They said it's either her or me.
Nonsense! I shouldn't have bothered.
It was made for Darrieux.
Everything's made for her.
She's perfect from take one.
I'm never sure of myself.
Nothing comes easy.
I'm fed up. Fed up!
I'm such a goose!
How can you say that?
Would I write for a goose?
Hold on...
Your passionate lover... it'll be little François Perier... recites a letter about your frolics.
Your husband may have intercepted it.
You: "You really wrote all that?"
Him: "Yes, my love."
You: "Must you always go on about things we did together?"
"What's the point? I was there!"
That's nice!
That's me all over.
I just love it.
I adore you!
Put this outside the door.
You knock, then scoot!
Come on, now!
The champagne.
Stay.
Go on, then.
But be careful. And the tea!
Ask for tea.
Do you have any tea?
Yes, tea.
Don't have any?
That's okay. Thanks.
They have none... Tea, coffee.
Why not real sugar?
Where do I put this?
Damn!
What's the matter?
I've made a mess!
The script for Roland Tual,
Love Letters.
He's expecting it tomorrow.
It soaks up like a blotter!
Look at that!
Hear that?
Rumbling.
It's thunder.
Come over here!
Not thunder, planes.
Lots of them.
Only the Germans have planes.
They wouldn't bomb Paris, they're in it!
No, it's freezing out!
I have to see!
They're far away, over the suburbs...
What is it?
It's coming from above.
What a sight!
That light...
What's that light? It's beautiful.
It's an air raid, all right.
- Close it! It's freezing!
- They're bombing!
Close your window, Mr. Jean!
The Brits are bombing Renault!
Close it, Jean!
Down we go!
Never any privacy!
First the champagne, then the phone, and now planes!
I refuse to be seen in a shelter!
We're calmly going to do what I came for.
Calmly? We're being bombed!
And if we're being bombed,
I can't do a thing.
Let me handle this.
To the shelters!
Is there a doctor?
Shut off the mains!
No, Mr. Devaivre!
To the shelters!
I'm getting my son.
He's safe. Your wife's here.
It's you! Got a flashlight?
- I'll get one?
- C'mon!
Find something to cover them.
Sheets and blankets.
Simone!
You okay?
I'm okay.
Seen Dr. Pelletier?
The raid's over.
I'm not so sure.
The flares looked like fireworks at first.
- What're you doing?
- Taking him.
It's 60° here with the windows closed.
At home, it's 34°.
You sure?
Take the kid!
Please, can you help me?
Not the small ones, Roger!
The big ones, under your nose!
The Brits' bombs work better than worms!
What're you doing?
Fishing! "The miracle of the fishes!"
We have to finish the scene tonight.
We'll be right in. The power's out.
We'll save you one.
We're already behind.
We'll be here till 6 a.m. Again.
How is it outside?
Not a pretty sight. Bodies everywhere.
They were really popping!
And real close!
We'll start soon.
Anybody call the supply company?
The phone's busy. George sent a cyclist to the power station.
The bridges are out.
How do I get home?
My husband'll be worried sick.
Fish, you guys!
There's plenty for everyone!
Fish?
If the cables are damaged, we're in for a long wait.
Check them. If it comes back on, we don't wait.
It will be a while.
We'd do the same.
Renault makes trucks and motors...
They come and bomb, it's fair play.
Fair play, no!
There are the rules of war.
You don't bomb the wounded, priests, or artists!
Boulogne's full of artists, and movie studios.
Everyone knows it.
The civilized world, anyway.
As if the civilized world still existed.
I've got a theater gig next.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to finish this long scene.
We have very little film left.
They're striking the set tomorrow.
So give it all you've got. Thanks!
Spare the candles!
They have to match.
Mr. Le Chanois is waiting upstairs.
I'm going up.
How's your baby? Not too scared...?
Don't waste your breath.
He never stops.
I call him Speedy.
I was about to leave.
Sandwich.
I also brought you carbon paper.
This is an epic!
Read it later.
What if my wife can't decipher it?
Here's the dialogue for Salou...
The power! I have to get back.
Hold on!
Comrades are getting nabbed.
There are informers everywhere.
- I know them.
- Not all of them!
Nicolas Hayer beat it before the Fritz came knocking.
Mickey Bouladoux got pinched.
It stinks!
Mickey?
So?
Clouzot offered me a job.
Aurenche gave up adapting a Nerval story.
Clouzot put me on it.
Tourneur needs an assistant.
You!
But Clouzot's Continental, and Continental's German!
Exactly! When you're in the lion's jaws, he can't bite.
Even the French police can't snoop at Continental.
That's 50% less hassle.
And the other 50%?
I'll think it over.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- I'll call you.
You can't. I moved.
Again?
Bretons are great travelers.
We dolly in on the table.
The table for two.
The 103 on the table for two!
Quiet on the set!
We're back to work and glad of it!
Places, everyone!
Off with your overcoats!
I'm cramped. I need to pull back.
Mr. Arrignon needs room.
Push back the sound booth.
- Buy some chocolate?
- We're rehearsing!
I'm interested.
What's that funny smell?
Fish. In the sound booth.
Not much left.
Move me back, please.
A little more.
- Mark it.
- Done, sir.
Tench is no better or worse than carp.
It tastes like whatever it's cooked in.
Cook it in sauce, it tastes good.
Cook it in muck, it tastes like muck.
Stop the hammers!
The hammers!
Silence!
Miss Gautier's shawl, please.
This wait had too many minutes.
Try to be not too dumb!
Camera!
8 Men in a Chateau.
Scene 82, take 1!
Action!
PUNISH THE VICHYTORTURERS
The grips had a good catch.
Here's our share.
Good. Jacques's coming for dinner.
He just called.
I was at the nursery. It's quiet.
There's a card from your brother Louis.
From Germany.
Awful handwriting!
Is it the cold?
What kind of fish?
- Tench.
- Any good?
Better than barbel and not as good as carp.
I brought you some carbon paper.
Almost new.
And a new tract to type in 7 copies?
It's not "traiter," it's "traitor."
"Someday soon Berlin and Tokyo may burn under Allied bombs."
You believe that?
Cleaned, scaled and chopped, we could make soup.
If we have gas to cook.
You know Nerval's The Magic Hand?
Jean-Paul backed me as assistant.
He's scripting it.
I can't decide.
You two get along well.
The producer's the hitch. Continental.
The Fritz?
Do what you think is best...
The elevator's off limits.
For those gentlemen only.
Mr. Tourneur's expecting us.
The glass door at the back: Greven.
The big cheese.
On the right, Bauermeister.
Watch your step with him.
Clouzot's there.
He runs the script department.
Greetings, Aurenche. No regrets?
For The Magic Hand? None.
But you'll do fine.
Updating Nerval stumped me.
But you'll find a way.
As I told Greven
Either you can or you can't.
Or, you will or you won't.
Did Herr Doktor understand you?
He acted like it.
He pesters the hell out of me!
I'm running late.
What's Clouzot like?
A tough nut, but he plays straight.
He'll back you up... except in a professional screw-up.
Here, here and here... our offices.
At the end, a minefield!
Mr. Tourneur... Jean Devaivre.
You have a fine reputation.
I know you finished
Mediterranean Alert.
How would you describe an assistant director's job?
The director's in charge.
He bears full responsibility, but only has 2 eyes.
An extra pair comes in handy.
Have you read
Le Chanois's script?
The treatment. It's not finished.
Bryau's always cold.
Von Schertel... SD.
SD?
Controls the SS.
- What's he doing at Continental?
- Renting space.
Understand German?
My wife gets by.
Me, not a word.
Many speak excellent French.
My rule is simple: Make good films.
Artistic and script matters see Mr. Clouzot.
For administrative issues
Mr. Bauermeister.
Like all directors, actors and key technicians, you'll be given a pass.
You must be ready for an August shoot.
You'll have 28 days.
Come, Tourneur, let's have lunch.
Spaak told me about A Shady Business.
Balzac. Fine.
I won't work for Continental. Period!
I can't keep turning Greven down.
You must help me.
When you won't, you won't.
Sure, sure. Stop kicking the mahogany.
It scratches, too.
Hold on...
Don't move.
There. Sure I'll help you.
But stop kicking the furniture.
It's distracting.
Helping a friend like you will be easy. How?
Put me under contract.
Fabulous!
Avoid the rock and the soft spot.
I'll have a project next month.
I need a contract today. Predated.
I signed one 2 weeks ago.
With whom?
With you. In this office.
It's easy enough to understand.
I won't work for theJerries, or end up in Berlin or in prison.
I keep turning Greven down,
I need an excuse. You must save me.
First finish Three-Way Romance.
It's finished.
We need something else, for 3, 6 months. 10 years!
Something else...
I have it.
Double Six. The play. Read it.
- A play? By whom?
- Achard.
- You mean Domino.
- I wanted The Lover from Borneo.
It's a dream title...
Borneo, Africa, tigers...
There are no tigers in Africa.
And Borneo's in Asia.
Movies are made of dreams, and dreams can't be mapped out.
I have something else.
Roland Tual will produce if you distribute.
- The title?
- Love Letters. Listen...
No, no, I'll take it!
I'm sobbing already. Love Letters.
It's worth its weight.
We'll fool Greven.
I have Gravey.
His contract is a plague!
- He asking a lot?
- Yes, and a pound of butter a week.
- What for?
- For bartering.
To work! I'm head over heels in work.
Find me prewar subjects.
Passion, gas lamps, backstairs...
- Backstreets.
- Backstreets. With peepholes.
I can never keep up with you.
So my wife says.
She's a great bridge player.
She costs me.
She play for money?
But if she plays well, she wins?
All the time.
So why does she cost you?
It's beyond me.
Why are we talking about this?
Tell Greven we have a 3-picture contract.
Strange man! Seen his office chest?
- The what?
- The chest.
Storage chest?
No, man's chest.
The head... like on statues!
The bust! The word's "bust."
Like buster.
He hangs his coat and hat on it.
So I saw. And?
Mussolini with a hat on his head!
You mean Hitler.
Logical for a German dignitary.
The thing has a forelock: Mussolini!
Mussolini's forelock!
The guy starts a sentence, but you never know...
Did I sign a contract or not?
Why does he keep doing that?
He had a lobotomy.
But he must do it for a reason.
He thinks you're a Jew.
Tomorrow, I'll have lettuce.
What brings you here?
I was in the neighborhood.
For you.
Shall I get Olga?
Good timing. She's free at this hour.
A Comédie Française actor mentioned you.
One who often plays priests.
Can I take those?
Oh, Jeannot!
My fingers are numb.
Goddamned suitcases!
The handles cut through your fingers.
I hate 'em!
A wheelbarrow's better.
Maybe not on a staircase...
They say it's very nice in French.
Very sad.
Not too heavy?
This place has become total chaos!
A new table?
A gift from Paul.
He deals in hot furniture.
Madame knows him from his vice squad days.
He rents space upstairs and pays in services.
It's just for a day or two.
Until I find...
There's no hurry.
Make yourself at home.
- You want a bath?
- Still have hot water?
Sure! For the Germans.
Put those in the closet.
They'll wrinkle in your suitcase.
This all the same story?
No. I wish it was.
- How do you keep track?
- I manage.
If not, I start over.
It's better sometimes.
Besides, clutter has a certain charm.
Honeysuckle vines are a lot more fun than matches in a box, or a military parade.
I keep track very easily.
You don't look like it.
My life's a mess, not my papers.
It's my own fault. I always say yes.
- Because you're nice.
- Maybe so, but...
I say yes to producers, hucksters, and women.
So I'm broke, I have 4 scripts and 3 women on my hands.
No, 4 women and 3 scripts.
Come on. It's cold.
Those handbags in the closet...
You collect them?
That's for later.
When I open a shop.
I won't end up in a sailors' brothel.
I'll have my own business.
A leather goods shop.
Luxury stuff.
Handbags are so pretty.
Even empty, they're pretty.
It's fine, but...
The set's too big.
Too wide for Stage 4.
Two yards too long.
With a 35, we won't frame it all.
If I place it diagonally on A...
But on the A there's the gallery.
We have to cut it down.
Or take out this wall.
I noted the camera angles on the floor plan.
I'll work it out.
Cut this, maybe.
Add arch. Gives volume.
And the paintings there?
They're for the painter's studio.
I painted two, small ones.
Good. Arches, cats...
Clouzot doesn't like
Le Chanois's dialogue.
He says it lacks "punch."
That's the word he used.
Here are both versions.
You decide.
I'll read them tonight, sir.
For the historical explanation of the severed hand, we have to simplify. Too long.
Or we ask for an extra day or two.
We said 28 days. 28!
If there is an extension, it will be an extension of 600 miles.
We'll send you to Babelsberg to study German production methods.
And if we sent you to Stalingrad, to study crawling methods.
Here's your pass.
Mr. Greven just signed Palau.
Good. You won't be sorry.
And your contract? Bring it in signed.
He'll be great as the Devil. Palau...
He's got funny eyes, like a duck.
Palau... No?
Talk him into it. It's Dad's birthday.
Make an effort.
You realize the workload he has?
That's just it. He needs a break, and it's Sunday. So come...
"People of Paris, the French must fight!
"Turn out in force and demonstrate!
"The gas is on only 4 hours a day!"
The union must be joking!
Go and fight...
With what? And why? For gas?
Jacques, please!
C'mon, this is a riot.
He has you type Communist tracts but he was on the other side.
He fights a war, great!
But he works for the Germans.
Not for. Under the Germans.
So how's Clouzot's dialogue?
Your brother's getting...
You slave weekends, for them!
I work on films. For Tourneur,
Clouzot and myself.
To learn. And I'm always learning.
Then shoot. Direct your first film.
Not now.
Not until we've kicked them out.
And I haven't signed a contract.
I never will.
So how about Sunday?
Are you coming?
Can't we put it back a week?
We'll celebrate Christmas on Bastille Day.
Mom found a duck and turnips.
We can set it back.
But the duck's plucked.
It's this Sunday or never.
I'll come with the baby.
Jean will drop by.
I took two tracts.
I'll come for lunch.
I love duck!
Devaivre?
This is Didot. Marc Valbel's friend.
Hold on.
Last year you had some apples.
Got any left?
I need two.
Remember where we met with Marc?
Sure, I do.
I'll meet you there.
- Now?
- Now.
I have to run. I won't be long.
- You know, I'm going...
- You said the less we know...
I'll put the baby to bed.
I'll do the ironing.
I'll wait up for you.
I have a pass.
You're getting thin.
Over there.
Let's see them.
Good.
Let's go.
- Where they from?
- I stole them the day of the Armistice.
I took them home.
You got a head start.
A gray duck, a blue duck, a white duck
The white duck walks behind
The blue duck walks ahead
The white duck is fattest
I'll sell it for 20 francs...
Would you have fired?
You picked up some coal.
Very clever.
You don't talk much.
Usually, the guys I take along run off at the mouth.
In three minutes, bang!
Any special reason for going after the Fritz?
I just want them out, that's all.
Let's go.
And the van?
I don't know whose it is.
So long!
Polish it good!
Activate the work!
You really pulled it off.
The statue... A great idea!
It adds to the scene.
Every camera angle is a good one.
And the paintings, great!
It can all be dismantled.
The Krauts won't believe their eyes.
"In Babelsberg we do this, we do that."
But look what we can do with the little they give us.
Nice work, Mr. Andrejew!
For the walls, here are the gray samples.
This one.
The latest tract. Make 8 copies.
For the art department.
I hear the sound ofboots, boots, boots.!
It's the first carabinier.!
Greetings!
- How are your trotters?
- We manage!
It's dumb losing your toes in Russia when your name's Softi.
How many was it?
Frostbitten toes?
3 left toes, 2 right.
You bet, it was 40 below!
No time to go out for a pee.
I got some liquid butter. Want some?
No, thanks.
You can tell there's a war on.
Even in June it's freezing!
War shakes up the skies, too.
I got you darlings lung from the butcher's.
They gave it to me in a shoe box to avoid jealousy.
Then getting it by the concierge, a fortune!
You're rich folks' cats!
But you know, the poor are the same.
They go hungry to feed their pets.
Crumbs for birds, birds for cats!
If only they'd eat them!
You might say, if they're poor, it's because they're not too bright.
I got us some calf liver!
- Taking down what she says?
- It's automatic.
Read me something you wrote?
It's been a bad day.
No, wait...
Here's something I like...
A scene between the count,
Douce's father,
- and the beautiful young woman.
- The teacher? Like your mom?
She was a governess.
The count says something funny.
She laughs. That makes him happy.
He: "I love to see you laugh.
You don't laugh enough."
She: "But, sir,
I've never been so happy."
He's very moved.
"Truly? How I wish to see you carefree!"
I like that: "carefree."
I tried "happy" but it's too dull.
"Easy-going" didn't fit.
That's more like us girls.
"Easy women," like they say.
Carefree is better.
I love to see you laugh.
You don't laugh enough.
I fear this house is too gloomy, too austere for you.
I've never been so happy.
Truly? How I wish to see you carefree.
You even write on death notices?
Whatever comes to hand.
- A relative?
- An uncle.
Was he rich?
He was old and blew every cent.
- On women?
- On books. Let me work.
You come from a weird family! Books!
I'm getting nowhere!
And when you get nowhere, you repeat yourself. You ramble.
So that's why you were sighing.
Luckily, Bost will fix it.
The man you work with?
Pierre Bost is gifted. He's a writer.
And you aren't?
I'm a juggler, a pied piper.
- A poet.
- That's sweet
Known this Mr. Bost long?
We worked on a film 5 years ago, but not at the same time.
We only just met.
He was released recently for excessive thinness.
His release form read
"Displays a pathetic look."
Bost is terrific.
I want to dazzle him. It inspires me.
It forces me to...
Yes, I want to dazzle Bost.
If I didn't know you, I might wonder, does he like women or men?
Women, naturally. Too much!
The girls' mail. Take it up.
Checkups are on Friday.
Do they mean next Friday or every Friday?
At least the Germans write in French.
That one's fine.
Now the 112 on the statue.
Say, Thirard, for the street scene...
Walking my dog this morning,
I noticed long shadows.
It produced quite a terrific, mysterious effect.
That's what I want: Very long shadows!
You'll have them, sir.
I need a hand here.
I told you, no smoking.
What cig?
Stand in for Mr. Fresnay.
The camera will follow you.
- Your butts are gross!
- Not at all!
If you were as well groomed as my cigs...
I steam 'em, dry 'em, comb 'em, mix 'em with endive, and I add corn silk.
A real treat!
"...so I think life is short, and hell eternal."
- 48 secs. 79 feet.
- We have the film?
No, sir.
I'll cut the shot in two.
I need 55 feet.
With a short end of 65 feet and a quick clap, it'll do.
Hear that, men?
The first take has to be right.
Our first takes have been right for weeks!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Butts!
My extinguisher!
Just checking!
Arthur, watch the sound booth!
A swivel stool for Mr. Fresnay.!
How long, Mr. Thirard?
Problems, Mr. Nee?
None, fella.
Get that tattle filter out of the way.
Mr. Bauermeister!
I'm glad to see you.
Shooting only with short ends is a juggling act.
We need extra film stock.
Not a foot. You ate up too much film for the early scenes.
The mountain inn set...
Too many angles, too many takes.
You went too far, so you're punished: Short ends.
I know you'll do just fine.
Your hair's too long.
A matter of dignity.
They won't provide longer short ends, so they shorten the hair.
Besides, long hair is filthy.
Gentlemen, to work!
- Hello, Mr. Manuel.
- Is Mr. Tourneur still here?
He's in his office.
I came to tell him
I won't be scoring his film.
You're quitting?
Look after yourself, sir.
The wind has to change someday.
Children, Paul needs the table.
Relax, he'll replace it.
Sorry. I sold this one.
That's business!
No hurry. My boys won't be here for half an hour.
They'll have another one.
So, you're in the movies?
Quite a world! You're lucky.
I love artists!
She can tell you.
Especially famous artists.
I had Raimu over for dinner here.
I live upstairs.
Raimu!
A quart of olive oil got him here!
You know any stars? I'll invite them.
Name one, I'll see to it.
Not everyone likes olive oil.
Anything!
I can get anything. I have connections.
Give me some names.
- Off the top of my head?
- Let's hear it.
Alerme.
Debucourt.
Gravey.
Sorry, I don't know him...
Women, rather. Women are pretty.
I have perfume.
Stockings.
Moreno.
Marguerite Moreno.
That old bag? He pulling my leg?
He's a fan. He's seen your films.
He can talk about them.
It's just a lunch.
Anything more is your business.
What's this guy do?
He's in business. Like everyone.
Business, business! What kind?
Property, I think.
He deals in furniture.
He's an antique dealer?
Yes... I don't know. Maybe.
He may not know gothic from Louis Seize, but he trades furniture on the black market.
We're his guests.
You'll get a gift of your choice.
Nothing to it!
Except it's in a shady place.
Shady? It's a brothel. It's not shady!
You'll like the Madame.
Will I like your doll?
Olga's like a little sister to me.
Okay, okay, I'll come.
I want oysters, foie gras...
And for the gift: Coffee.
Coffee beans... Watch my makeup!
Real coffee.
But I warn you: No Germans.
Not at the table.
- It's so Chinese!
- It's oriental.
I asked Reine to accompany me.
My seamstress and friend.
Reine Sorignal.
Why, of course.
A friend, Marinette Burguière.
Come this way...
I'm delighted to have you here, children.
They're just passing through!
We'll go upstairs.
Your Suzanne's a looker.
You're quite a couple!
Watch the steps.
It's waxed Prussian-style.
Nice!
Sorry, it's like a junk shop here.
There's no room.
The table, the statue...
I've seen this before...
It's magnificent!
Oysters! I must be dreaming.
Never too old!
A promise is a promise.
Abyssinian. A good pound.
Thanks so much.
Nothing like prewar coffee.
- Wait till the war's over.
- It won't be prewar.
For you...
They're autographed.
Why do you always do period films?
For the gowns?
I don't write my roles. Fortunately.
People are scrambling for fabric.
True, fabric is hard to come by.
Designers don't have that problem.
They just have to pay.
Money buys everything.
A period film's a good medium for putting ideas across.
Nowadays, any critical allusion to the army, the church, the family...
The police.
The police... It's censored!
In suit and tie, you're a public threat.
But say it in a period costume...
Other times, other ways.
Cheers!
To us!
Mouton-Rothschild 1929.
It's not dishwater!
You make a lot?
Goodness, yes.
How much?
Excuse me?
Sorry. I'm nosey.
It's no secret.
In a play, I get 4,000 francs per performance.
Really?
But in a movie, I make up for it.
I can earn 30,000.
That's more like it.
How about you?
It's pretty unpredictable with us.
There are ups and downs.
But it takes stamina.
Do you know Mr. Giraudoux?
Jean Giraudoux?
Sure, I know him. By name.
I mean in person.
No. But I think I might, some day.
Juliette, more chestnuts!
I know him.
Jean used to take me to lunch with him at Louvre Hotel.
He's really got manners.
And education.
And goodness.
He's not paid what he's worth, either.
Some more pheasant, darling?
You look lovely.
Every man for himself and God for me!
Juliette will bring cigars and coffee.
You're having fun.
The kid's a gas!
She asked what I earn on dresses per month. She totted it up and said I'd earn more with a leather goods shop.
You pushing me?
No, you're the one who's pushing.
You ask me: "Is Max Ernst a Jew?"
I answer: "Who gives a damn!"
"A great artist?"
Absolutely.
"Can one be an artist and a Jew?"
Certainly.
"But I won't denounce any."
Then: "Is Celine a great writer?" "Yes!"
"You approve his anti-Semitic work?"
"I don't read the rags he writes for."
"So, you're a Jew-lover."
Mostly, I've been a Jewess-lover!
I may be drunk, but it won't stop me from speaking my mind!
He's back again!
With his net!
- You sure?
- I saw him.
Take a look.
He's a bit thick!
Dirty creep!
Who?
What's this about?
It's just Camille.
A guy who catches cats.
Cats?
What's he do with all those cats?
He skins them or sells them for food, who knows?
Maybe they served us cat.
No, it had feathers.
- Calm down.
- I'll punch him out!
I'd warned him.
Nothing's dumber than an anti-Semite!
Listen to yourself!
What are they doing?
They're hitting him!
Oh, my God!
Take him away!
Shit, split it again!
You're crazy! He's dangerous.
He's a cop for the Germans.
I've wrangled with cops before.
Please, Jean, calm down.
Do it for me.
He started, I'll finish.
He's good for the prison infirmary.
I fixed him good.
Beating up a tramp in his 60s...!
He gets this way.
He's overworked.
So when he drinks, he collapses.
Mr. Tourneur, could I add...?
- How much time?
- Three minutes.
Sure, they're real pearls.
Move the table closer.
There was an extra here.
Hear that, Jacques?
Hop to it!
This is take 59?
Don't touch what's on your plate.
- Not even the lettuce.
- The chicken looks yummy.
It's not chicken, it's rutabaga.
Like the rest.
Carved. And raw.
But we have to look like we're eating.
So look like it, without eating.
Character acting, right?
How low are you framing?
Just under her treasure chest.
- A lot of chest! Get a shawl.
- It's my endowment!
A shawl for the young lady!
You'll be on Ladies'Delight next.
- So what?
- I want a part.
A real role. No more extra work.
- What's a real role?
- You know.
Three scenes with three lines.
For a dozen eggs.
- Eggs aren't rare.
- A rabbit, then.
Okay, but with six eggs.
- 6 eggs and half a rabbit.
- The liver included.
For tomorrow. I have guests.
Mr. Fresnay, on the set!
Mr. Fresnay's right here!
Mr. Fresnay's on the set, always ready!
Lift your boom when the kid exits.
You bet! We'll lift it.
Ready, ladies and gents?
Care to see the setup, sir?
What's with gramps?
We're going to shoot!
My wife's been incarcerated by the police in Vittel.
She still has a US passport.
She's American. I'm worried.
I understand, sir.
My mind's not on this.
So if you'd fill in for me...
Count on me, sir.
Go to it, fella. We're behind you.
Okay. The camera goes here, with a 35.
At first, we don't see Mr. Larquey, only his shadow.
His name is Angel.
I want a strange, eerie effect.
You'll have it, sir.
Rehearsal. Silence.
Don't wrinkle my tie!
It's a bad idea.
- It's like a wax museum.
- No, you'll see.
There's no mystery.
We have to imagine the hand.
If it doesn't work, we cut it.
This will go great guns, fellas!
We'll see!
Thanks for my script.
What about it?
For backing it against Clouzot's.
Thanks!
Yours was shorter.
I'm not a philanthropist.
So we'll make a little deal.
Today, one cent.
Tomorrow, two cents...
It gives you time to make a decision.
8 cents, 16 cents, 32, 64, 128,
Doubling it to infinity.
You know what infinity's like?
I know. I've been there.
It's quite nice.
Cut.!
Not only great guns, but howitzers!
I'll lead the way.
Don't buy it, mister, don't buy it.!
Quiet.! You sorcerer.!
And the shadows, sir?
His name's Angel so he thinks he's everyone's guardian.
It's very good.
I couldn't have done better.
Thank you.
- You believe in that?
- Why shouldn't I?
But it's impossible.
You have no valid reason to refuse.
I do! I'm under contract.
I'm tied up untilJanuary '43.
Predated contracts which arrived just in time!
That's all right. Eat! Drink!
I choose good subjects,
3 times out of 5.
I don't make films in Germany.
I leave our propaganda to the French.
Vichy censorship can't touch us and I pay the best.
- What more do you want?
- I don't know.
Isn't it a bit too salty?
Salt always hides something.
Ever since the Middle Ages.
Forget the Middle Ages, Aurenche.
It's salted just right.
Hire Prévert.
HireJeanson, Véry, Laroche...
Jeanson was denounced by the French.
And the others tell me, "Hire Aurenche."
Spaak!
Hello, Dr. Greven.
Tell him to work for me, Spaak.
Tell him I'm no ogre.
OdetteJoyeux is raving about Love Letters.
Thanks. How about you?
I have my ups and downs.
He's not afraid to work for me.
He's finishing a film and he's signed to do a Simenon, a Maigret.
Give him my two films then.
He doesn't have that French light touch.
You have it. I want to make lots of good films.
Better than the Americans.
So I need good scripts,
- hence, good scriptwriters.
- Take your pick.
There's nothing to pick.
And you know why?
No moreJews. Not in Germany, not here. The best writers wereJews. Natanson, André Lang,
Pierre Wolff. All gone!
If you know any, send them over.
Mr. Greven, even if I knew any, think I'd tell you?
Know what you risk talking to me like that?
I could send you to Germany tomorrow.
Sure... If I were a laborer or maitre d', I'd answer differently.
But we're 2 bourgeois. I'm poorer, but still a bourgeois.
We're two of a kind.
I have a Jew at Continental.
And communist, too.
I know it. He doesn't know I know.
Just one film, Aurenche. A comedy.
You know how to write gags.
I'll have Fernandel in 3 months.
He'll direct.
It's called Adrien.
AJean de Letraz hit.
But those kind of plays...
Just what I loathe.
As for Fernandel...
He's a gag factory, a walking gag.
Where would I fit in? I'd ruin it all.
René!
René Wheeler!
Selling shoelaces?
Not by choice. I have to eat.
I don't sell any, so I don't eat.
I just turned down a film.
A piece of crap.
I can accept it for you.
You write and collect.
There are bad points.
Director and star: Fernandel.
For Continental, the Fritz.
Eat with the devil, at least you eat.
Is that cop here to monitor the gags?
I've had this idea
I wanted to do with you.
A story about river poachers.
A totally free narrative.
- Shot entirely on location.
- Which region?
The Rhone. Simple people.
Anarchists, extravagant as we like them.
Well, Aurenche!
I'm not fickle, but when I left...
You know what Napoleon said?
René Wheeler, a first-class writer.
Take him and we'll be a team.
What did our friend Napoleon say?
It'll come back to me.
René's free as of now...
He knows it's Fernandel in front and behind the camera.
Fernandel's ideas, gags, the works.
He talks so I'll say yes without thinking.
But still, I'm thinking.
And I say yes anyway.
Go up and see Marcel Bryau, who's in charge of contracts.
Don't go. I'll see you in a minute.
"Patience and time accomplish more than force and rage."
That's it.
Have a good day.
Come along.
So it's Fernandel.
Your timing of the Tourneur film was perfect!
Only a 17-second difference with the final cut.
Do the same on Ladies'Delight.
You'll work with Cayatte.
The Military Cross?
And the stars are citations?
You were an officer?
Cavalry lieutenant, transferred to a reconnaissance group.
But what happened to you French?
This whole debacle!
In '14 you held firm.
I fought you, you had courage!
But now, why this beating? Why so fast?
Fine. I have one, too.
I was a fighter pilot.
See Bauermeister. You have 30 days.
Nights, rather.
Power shortage.
Take 2 extra nights.
Cayatte lacks experience. You have it.
Show him where the camera goes.
It's freezing!
The young lady there...
That's a projector, not a foot-warmer.
Put a scrim on that projector.
The two girls on the left...
The lady in the brown coat, move to the left. The other lady, too.
My left.
Not your left.
You're holding me up.
I'm going to work.
- Ausweiss, please!
- What ausweiss?
Your pass.
You have my I D. My papers are in order.
Tell them!
It's curfew. You need ausweiss.
I'm an extra! Over there.
Ladies'Delight! Extra!
Me, movies, Continental, studio!
Continental is you! It's German!
- Tract!
- That's nothing...
I found it on the ground!
I'm gonna make a stink!
I know the director!
And I work for you!
Continental is German, it's you!
I'm cold and hungry!
I have fish bone paste.
They're coming!
- Butts!
- What a waste!
Quiet on the set!
Ready, everybody?
Ready, Michel?
Let's do it.
- A chair?
- No, thank you.
Do you need anything?
Ladies'Delight. Scene 248, take 1!
Action!
Take your money back.
Baudu doesn't accept charity.
You ruined me, but you won't last. You've created a mastrous monchine... Shit!
Cut!
"A monstrous machine"!
This was written by a mindless midget.
- Stay in your places.
- I'm in my place!
- It's okay, Michel.
- Bug off!
Silence!
Hammers!
Maybe there's no director!
Watch your manners!
- Water for Mr. Simon.
- Which take?
- Sixth.
- Bad times in Billancourt!
In 20 years, trade will be one big battlefield, on which quality, probity and confidence will be sacrificed. Beware, Mouret!
You're inaugurating a reign of junk and razzle-dazzle.
There's a price that you, too... that you too, one day...
What? "You, too, one day..." What!
I can't do it!
I can't go on playing with watchdogs around.
Take a 3-minute break.
Reload!
Michel's a pain, but what balls!
Swiss balls! Safer than Gallic ones.
Neutral balls!
It's going to be hell!
Machine guns and anti-aircraft guns.
We'll go nuts!
- Go to my godmother.
- They won't shoot all day.
Where'd you get this?
The dairywoman.
I hired her daughter as an extra.
Can the baby eat it?
Sure, sure.
It's milk. He can eat the cream.
As for us... the crust is good.
Your brother gets my goat.
He only comes to pick up girls.
But tonight, absent for duty.
What do you mean?
He never showed up.
I found him work as an extra.
But him...
He'll get packed off to Germany, like my brother.
Except that he got squealed on.
It's been a while.
It's every day now.
Air raids all the time!
Your Brits are a pain!
And always the same targets
Renault, Salmson, Sauter.
So long, Billancourt!
I'm moving to Rue St. Charles.
But that's right where Citroên is!
So? They'd never bomb Citroên.
Citroên is allJews.
- Mr. Raoul!
- This isn't bad.
More of that gutless literature.
My hat's no trash can!
Rehearsal, gentlemen!
I dare you to repeat that.
What you call my tomahawk pin is Pétain's francisque. I'm proud of it!
But you still kiss Kraut ass!
I fought them but I respect the victors.
- "And I inform."
- What nerve!
Hands off! I'll denounce you!
Mr. Aimable!
You're behind on the set construction.
Let me show you why.
Coffins?
The wood for our sets. Requisitioned.
It's in great demand on the Russian front.
That's furniture for the Atlantic Wall.
The studio head sells to the Krauts.
No profit is too small.
To make household savings, use everything.
Let nothing go to waste...
Mom, what're you doing here?
Simone got a summons.
- Summons?
- I came to watch the baby.
- Summoned by whom?
- How should I know?
You know Simone. She called, showed me a paper when I got here,
- and said: "I'm going to Fresnes."
- The prison! I'm going.
You're crazy!
Try the police first.
It must be those shoe coupons.
They looked shady to me.
She got them from her father.
Those shoes were trash...
Wood and cardboard.
Let the time go by
Let the days go past
Let the wind blow high but make sure love stands fast...
Strange place to meet.
There's safety in numbers.
You wanted to see me?
I'm worried.
Simone got a summons.
I asked the police. No news.
Who summoned her? Where?
I don't know. But she's at Fresnes.
I'll ask around.
Continental's no protection.
This proves it.
That's irrelevant.
She works at Sirius Distribution.
If we got her out...
Our job is intelligence, infiltration, not playing commandos.
Sorry to wake you, Mom.
It was because ofJacques.
He was arrested outside the studio.
He was going to work.
They found tracts on him.
They didn't hurt you?
No, not me.
He's at Cherche-Midi Prison.
Better than Fresnes.
I think...
One little tract! It's no big deal.
Maybe he found it.
I saw the report. It's not one tract.
Everyone says that, "I found it!"
But two! You don't find two!
Two tracts is a big deal!
He's only 20. He's a kid.
The Russian front is full of
German kids who may never reach 20.
Excuse me.
I overheard you.
It's a regulation. A German directive.
If there are several tracts, they investigate.
You should speak to Mr. Von Schertel.
Wait here, I'll see if he's free.
His name's Dubuis, isn't it?
Jacques Dubuis?
And the herbs!
A stew without herbs is mush.
Herbs and the marrow bone.
Ah, the marrow bone!
A thing of the past!
But I should tell you about my mother's stew for funeral meals.
Shoulder, shank, ribs...
Beef cheeks.
Sorry, I have to run. See you.
Have you checked on My Love is Yours?
Mr. Pottier wants you.
Sure, sure.
And your contract! Bring it in signed.
I've asked you 10 times!
Sure, of course.
Ah, Devaivre! I know you're crying for lumber and film stock.
Materials and film are my department.
I decide who gets it.
I know, Mr. Beurkley.
If you need anything, come see me.
Come in.
My secretary told me about your brother-in-law.
He's not a Jew? A Communist?
A Freemason?
You have a good reputation here at Continental.
I'll look into it.
I swear.! It came back to me...
You sure?
The statue was at Harry Baur's.
He'd invited Christian and me over.
His collection was stunning:
Paintings, books, and bronzes,
- including that one.
- Oh, my God!
- She's fooling herself!
- She can fool me, her husband, but not about something so minor.
Anyway, she's a lousy liar.
That Paul isn't just a dealer or an ex-vice squad cop.
He robbed Baur before murdering him!
He doesn't scare me.
You can't speak to him, smile at him...
He's Gestapo.
In 1549 the year of the Monkey.
King Maha Chakkraphat became ruler of the city of Ayothaya.
Only seven months later
Taben Schweti King of Hongsawadi
Ied an invading army out against
Ayothaya.
King Maha Chakkraphat rode into battle against
Hongsawadi.
His queen and daughter rode beside him.
When battle was joined the vanguard was routed -confusion reigned everywhere.
The queen and the Kings daughter fought bravely from behind on their elephant until both of them had perished.
The name of the queen who sacrifice her life so gallantly has passed into legend as Queen Suriyothai.
This is her story.
In 1 528 the year of the Rat,
Siam had two kings.
Rama Thibodi who reigned in Ayothaya.
And his cousin
King Athitaya who ruled the northern city of Pitsanuloke.
It was a time of peace.
No wars troubled the reign of either king.
Wang Chang, Mount Soi Dao
In 1 528, the year of the Rat.
In the twelfth month,
King Athithya journeyed to the Elephant Palace on
Soi Dao Mountain
In his entourage was Princess
Suriyothai of the house of Praruang savouring the spectacle of the elephant round-up.
Your Highness!
Don't lean out like that.
People might see you.
It goes against royal conventions.
We're on holiday, Nanny.
Can't I even look at the scenery?
You're a grown woman now.
Try and behave like one
-The court rules are quite clear
-Oh, rules, rules, rules.
I'm worn out with rules I'm sick to death of rules.
Will I meet Lord Piren?
Of course not, Your Highness
You're not a child any more.
You can't just go out and meet men.
It's absolutely forbidden.
Even when the man is my own brother?
Even then?
Lord Piren isn't really your brother, Your Highnesses.
Just a relative
A distant cousin
Oh, I am so, so, so, so bored!!
Nanny?
Your Highness
I'm dying of thirst.
Have pity. Fetch me a little water.
Your Highness
Kayoon.
Quickly. Take my place
Your Highness.
This is not a good idea
Where are you going,
Your Highness.
Please let's get back to the palanquin.
It won't do for you to be seen in public.
It's a serious violation against the rules.
Stop fussing Pudkrong.
Lord Piren is not a stranger.
He's my cousin.
Why shouldn't I see him?
I've never set foot outside the palace before.
Please indulge me
Show me all there is to be seen.
For myself nothing would give me greater pleasure.
But that you should go back to the lnner Palace.
For your own sake before you get caught and punished.
Don't expect me to go back to the palace.
If you don't like being with me just say so and leave me.
We need never see each others faces again
No, no, it's not like that at all.
You..you are like my life
There's nothing in the world I could
I could want more, desire more
Iove more than you
Do you mean that? Honestly?
Or are you lying to me?
Listen to me Suriyothai.
On my honour as a warrior, what
I say now is the absolute truth.
If at any time in the future.
My body or my brain can be of service to you in any way.
All you have to do is send me word.
I will be beside you before you can even turn your head
You don't have to promise quite that much
All I really want is an elephant
That would make me so very, very happy
That little elephant-he's perfect
Would you catch him for me?
If you want him, you shall have him
Be careful! It's dangerous
Don't go too close
That's Prince Tien
That's my elephant!!
He's a wild elephant, he belongs to whoever can catch him
The Crown Prince is here
Is Princess Suriyothai in residence?
Lord Srisurin
Go and fetch the princess immediately.
The Princess does not wish to see the Crown Prince.
She refuses?
Come and pay your respects to the Crown Prince. At once!!
I have no desire to see him
This elephant I have named
Plai Song Tawan.
I caught him with the sole purpose of presenting him to
Your Highness as a gift.
Lord Srisurin
Thank you for accepting my invitation
My greatest joy is to honour
Your Highness's wishes
They tell me you have an extremly beautiful daughter
Do you mean Suriyothai?
Presumably
How old is she?
Nearly fifteen
Ah. My son... begs me to ask... your permission for her hand in marriage.
If it is Your Highness's wish.
I have no objections whatsoever.
Who are you?
From the look of your garments and demeanour.
She is Suriyothai.
One of the daughters of Lord
Srisurin Governor of Pitsanuloke
She is my cousin
Suriyothai?
Aren't you about to marry
Prince Tien
-l....
-Don't be afraid to tell me, child.
Think of me as one of the family.
Speak your mind.
With regards to the wedding between myself and the Prince
You would rather not marry my nephew
Suriyothai
Although I may be the King but I have no desire to force anyone into something against thein will.
I could change my mind today and the whole idea could be forgotten
It would be the easiest thing in the world
But..this is what you must consider it would cause a rift between
Pitsanuloke and Ayothaya which in the long run might have serious consequences.
Can you live with that responsibility
You won't run away again?
Is that understood?
1 529 The Year of the Ox
A white omen appears in the sky.
Indra's arrow crossing relentlessly from the South to the Northwest
Sunday. Eighth day of the waxing moon of the twelfth lunar month.
King RamaThibodi I goes into the chapel
That same night he passes away.
Pitsanuloke
His Majesty King Rama Thibodi is no more.
Long live His majesty!
May he live ten thousand years.
Long live His majesty!
May he live ten thousand years.
Today is an auspicious day.
The ninth month of the year of the cow.
Thursday.
An auspicious day on which His Majesty the great King
Nor Puthangkul has appointed by royal decree the Lady Oon daughter of Lord Yomaraj to be the High Consort from this day forward.
Wang Chai Palace
1 532. The year of the Dragon.
I have come down from Pitsanuloke.
To warn his Majesty that the Northern provinces are no longer loyal to Ayothaya
The reason? His Majesty appears to have lost interest in the affairs of his Kingdom
He seems not even to care that the new King of Tongu went and thumbed his nose at the Mon in Hongsawadi with a mere 500 soldiers
Do you know why he went there?
To stage an ear splitting ceremony at Swemawdaw Temple
Hundreds upon hundreds of Mon soldiers quaking with fear of a single child
Surely, as the Second King
His Majesty trusted you to handle these matters on his behal
That's not the reason
It's because he can think of nothing but his new consort. He's infatuated
Why must you treat me with so much deference?
Are we no longer brother and sister?
Your Highness is now the wife of the Crown Prince
She should even be talking to me
I will, with your permission, take my leave.
I have returned from China with a special gift for you
What is it?
And what favor are you asking from my husband in exchange?
I would like you to speak to your daughter
My daughter is the High Consort
The High Consort. Exactly so
Ask her to talk to her husband
You mean His Majesty?
His Majesty, yes, His Majesty.
I want her to tell him that
I have some Chinese cannons to sell
If your daughter, the High Consort, speaks to His Majesty on my behalf how can he refuse
And I will give you a commission of ten per cent
I, Captain Rajasaneha, soldier, retired pledge my allegiance to Prince Tien on behalf of myself and all my men
Why did you leave the army?
Because I wouldn't bend the knee to Lord Yommaraj
All those who refused to grovel to him were dismissed from service
And now you wish to serve the Prince?
To Prince Tien
I can submit willingly without a moment's hesitation
An heir to the throne is born!
Your Highness now has a brother
How can I be the brother of a Prince?
I am merely the son of the King's concubine
You are still his older brother
I am not worthy to be the brother the future King
Each of us has his allotted share of merit which has been ordained from the beginning
No one can change his destiny
In 1 533. The year of the Snake.
The smallpox sweeps across the Kingdom. Thousands perish
Promise me..
No, not merely promise.
Swear... that you will permit
Prince Ratthati-raya kuman... to become King by right of accession
Swear... that neither one of you will take away the throne from my son
I swear, Your Majesty
Swear!
I swear, Your Majesty
May the King reign in health and happiness
Long live the King!
Tabeng Shweti's camp outside Bassein.
His Majesty, Nor Puthangkul has passed away
This is the opportune moment for
Tongoo to attack Ayothaya
Once we've taken Bassein we'll move on Ayothaya
We'll get more troops from Bassein.
Ayothaya will crumble in no time.
They'll be hopelessly outnumbered.
One moment, Your Majesty.
I think this is not the moment for
Tongoo to march on Ayothaya.
How can you say that?
Even though Nor Puthangul has gone..
Yet, the moment Tongoo's troops enter Arothaya.
Chairaja, the Second King, who reigns in Pitsanulok. will seize the throne from
Ratthati-raga kuman so that he can defend the city against our attack.
He is a fierce and able warrior.
One not to be lightly underestimated.
Yes. What you say has a convincing ring to it.
In any even, first we must take Bassein.
By tomorrow. I want it by tomorrow.
Fire!
From this moment on you are no longer Hong
Chinese merchant of Nai Kai
Who am I then?
You are Sir Choduk Raja-sethi.
Commander of the left bank with sole authority to set prices..all prices.. for all forms of merchandise
A penny buys only three bowls of rice?
Yes, Your Highness.
A wagon load costs one pound, two shillings and a penny farthing.
Where will we find the money to feed those who depend on us?
And what about other goods?
All the prices are going up.
Especially if it imported from China or Portugal.
Then it costs as much as twice the cost.
At all goes according to whatever Sir Choduk decides.
I thought so.
Hong is behind this.
Sir Pinit? How much money do we have in the treasury?
Just enough to see us through to harvest time.
But we need money for weapons,
Portuguese armor, uniforms for the Prince's soldiers.
We shall have to make do with what we have.
But that's impossible.
The old weapons are beyond repair
And anyway. a Prince is judged by the condition of his army and his forces.
If our equipment is shabby and ineffectual we will lose face.
Take this. Pawn it with
Seng at Nai Kai canal.
It should fetch you a good price.
Enough to purchase what we need.
Your Highness.
That was your mother's ring!
It's nothing compared to the Prince's honour.
I must see His Highness.
His Highness is still sleeping.
I must se him. It's absolutely vital.
What is it?
Prince Chai Raja has staged a coup d'etat.
He led his army down from Pitsanulok and seized the throne!
Your Highness!
Sanpet Prasat throne hall.
In 1 534, the Year of the Horse.
Your Highness!
Help us. Please!
Help me!
Put away your weapons. At once!
Why have you done this?
You swore an oath.
You swore to accept Prince Ratha as your Sovereign.
In the presence of all things sacred, you gave your word!
What do you suggest I do?
Let the people go on suffering as they are suffering now?
Spare me your hypocrisy.
You want the throne!
It's as simple as that
It was mine from the beginning.
But I took pity on a dying man.
For five long months,
I kept careful watch to see how the Regent and his cronies would rule the Kingdom
Since Rathathiraj came to power the city has been in turmoil
Even worse, many provinces have switched their allegiance from Ayothaya to Tongoo.
Sooner or later
Ayothaya will be overrun and succumb to the power and might of King Tabeng Shweti.
For this reason.
I had to break my oath to a dead King.
What will happen to the boy?
Where are you, Mummy?
Mummy!
Where are you?
I'm frightened!
Help me!
Take me back to bed.
-I want to go back to sleep.
-Wait.
Let the Lady Worachan attend His Majesty.
I'm frightened.
Hush, there's no need to be afraid.
I'm here. I'm right beside you.
Mummy!
Where are you?
Mummy!
This will never happen again!
Whatever the circumstances.
There will be no more of this kind of killing.
I think Prince Chai Raja did the right thing.
The right thing?
Killing an innocent child?
Yes.
Sacrificing one life, however innocent to end bloodshed across the Kingdom.
It's Prince Chai Raja who is shedding the blood..
That's not true.
The second King knew that if he did nothing it would mean the end of Ayothaya.
If you were in his place.
You would have done the same.
Never. I would never do that.
No matter what the innocent should never suffer.
It was in the year 1 534,
The year of the Horse that the young King was executed and
King Chai Raja ascended the throne.
In 1 535 The Year of the Goat
It seems that I can no longer carry out my duties.
I am the Lord of Life.
Highest in the Kingdom.
I will not let you die.
Even the Lord of Life cannot defy the Lord of the Underworld.
I.. humbly..take my leave.
Jitravadee!
Jitravadee!!
The Queen Jitravadee gave birth to the Prince Yodfah then bled to death.
So doing. She opened the way for Princess Srisudachan of the House of U-Thong.
She was appointed Royal Consort to the King Chai Raja.
What is your name?
Boonsri, Your Majesty.
I hold the rank of Royal Steward.
Custodian of the Outer Hall housing the Buddha images.
So. Are you descended from the U-Thong dynasty?
I am, your Majesty.
They tell me that you are an exceptional singer.
They flatter me, Your Majesty.
Sing a verse for me.
I will decide if that is flatterey.
That fellow Boonsri, who sang for His Majesty.
Custodian of the Outer Hall.
He holds the rank of steward.
The Outer Hall.
That's the residence of
Pra Matamatayikka, Her Royal
Great Grand Mother, isn't it?
Yes. Her Highness resides at
Piman Rattaya Hall.
Perhaps it's time we presented ourselves to Her Highness.
Pimam Rattaya Hall, Front Palace.
Sroy, take this betel nut and give it to that steward.
Tell him it is a reward for his singing, which has touched me deeply.
Yes, My Lady.
The High Consort instructs me to bring you this gift.
A reward for pleasing her with your melodious renditions.
Your visit here today... was no accident.
You are fulfilling the desires of those ancestors from whose shades nothing is hidden.
The usurping dynasy of Suphanabhumi has taken over the throne of the U-Thongs for far too long.
Very soon you will understand what I am saying if the Uthing blood runs strong in your veins.
I came to inform Your Highness.
That a few days from now.
I take my vows as a nun
If that is what you truly desire.
I wish you every happiness.
No matter what happens the House of
Sri Dhamma-sokka-raj will always honour the House of
Suphanabhumi and offer obeisance for generations to come.
But one thing more.
Never trust Sri Sudachan.
Watch her closely.
Be on your guard against this High Consort.
She is not what she seems to be.
In 1 538. The year of the Dog.
King Chai Raja led his armies against the cities of Chiang Krai and Chiang Kran.
When King Ta-beng Schweti fought against the Mon, he had been unaware these cities belonged to Ayothaya.
Now King Chai Raja was determined to reclaim them.
Ching Krai, on the border of Siam.
His Majesty once told me that you have great understanding of astnology. and can interpret dreams with wonderful accuracy.
I humbly thank you, Your Highness.
For many nights,
I have had strange dreams.
Tell me what they mean.
I dreamed of you seated resplendently on a throne of gold. beneath the Royal tiered umbrella of Aytothaya.
And the one who seated beside you was me.
I can behold the truth buried deep in your eyes when you throw me a glance as you render music to the King.
I know only too clearly.
What lies in your heart... because your thoughts and mine are one and the same.
Utterly, totally, one and the same.
I still believe that bows and arrows are more accurate than your guns.
Give me the bow.
Your Higness's skill remains without equal
Then why does the Captain insist that my children and l
Iearn to use the weapons of westerners?
Because guns can shoot much further than bows and arrows.
They have five, ten times the power.
Modern warfare now requires this new kind of weapon.
The ancient textbooks on warfare will have to be rewritten if our enemies are to be defeated.
The King sent for me.
No, not the King.
It was l.
I seek your advice,
Lord Rajapakdee.
My advice, such as it is, is at Her Higness's disposal.
The keeper of the Outer Chapel is the son of Lord Sithrep
The liege-lord of Sithrep province.
Is it not so?
It is so, Your Highness.
Then pray tell me
Why is he only a lowly Captain.
Is it because Captain Butra-Sithrep for all of his noble birth belongs to the House of U-Thang and therefore cannot expect to rise from his lowly station.
No, Your Highness, not in the least.
In my opinion, this Captain Panbut-Sithrep should be elevated to the rank of Sir Chinaraj and made Keeper of the lnner Chapel.
Your Highness. It is impossible.
And why is that, Lord Rajapakdee?
You are Lord of the Palace.
You have all the power you need to promote or demote whoever you choose
That is true.
-But...
-But what?
While the present Sir Chinaraj
Keeper of the lnner Chapel.
Still lives.
That is..unless and until he dies..
Regretfully, I cannot assume the power.
In compliance with
Your Highness's wishes.
But what if the present Sir Chinaraj were to meet with an accident?
Halt!
The High Consort Srisudachan requires your presnce! Immediately!
What is your business here, woman?
The High Consort wishes that I should bring My Lord this gift.
Is that all, woman?
To repay you for your kindness.
For the advice you gave her yesterday.
I did nothing.
I merely told her the truth.
Captain Panbut-Sithrep can only advance his status if and when Sir Chinaraj passes away
And for that reason the High Consort is presenting My Lord with this valuable gift.
The High Consort is confident
Your Lordship will not deny the raising of Captain Panbut-Sithrep to the rank of Sir Chinaraj
Custodian of the lnner Hall housing the Budha images.
His Highness was served the finest Portuges liquor.
I trust it was to your liking.
Your Higness truely understands the art of pampering an old man.
If I hadn't known that this was the paace of the King's brother before I saw the soldiers on manoeuveres.
I might have thought it to be a rebel stronghold.
Why should Prince Tien betray his brother?
Of course.
He is His Majesty's loyal subject.
More loyal than anyone except myself.
Then tell me. Why do you think we are on constant alert?
Since you ask
I would imagine you fear the High Consort and her malicious schemes.
You put it far too strongly.
I'm sure I have no cause to think ill or be fearful of the High Consort
Or do you have reason to think otherwise?
Capptain Panbut-Sithrep the Custodian of the Outer Chapel has been promoted to Sir Chinatraj.
Custodian of the lnner Chapel.
And why should that because for alarm?
There's no reason.
Except that the previous Sir Chinatraj has disappeared suddenly, mysteriously and without a trace.
And you see the hand of the High Consort in this?
Be honest. You yourself don't trust the woman
I'm right, am I not?
In 1 545, the year of the Dragon.
The fourth waxing moon of the seventh month. Wednesday.
King Chai Raja marched to Chiang Mai with Lord Pitsanuloke as his vanguard.
Sankrao, a Chiang Mai mandarin plotted with others to seize
King Khet Muan Klao and assassinate him
King Chai Raja marched to Chiang Mai to retake the city from the rebel grasp.
I don't want to leave you
I want to stay like this for all eternity.
My life means nothing.
I would happily trade all the rest of my days for a mere one more day with you.
Before King Chai Raja's forces reached Chiang Mai.
The mandarins captured and executed the treacherous Lord Sankrai and invited Queen Jiraprapa to take the throne
The Queen brought gifts to King Chai Raja and offered peace and goodwill.
The third waxing moon of the tenth month. Saturday
King Chai Raja built a mausoleum for King Khet Muanka at Moree monastery.
Aren't you going to give me any medicine?
I must be dying.
I'm nauseous all the time.
Vomiting and throwing up everything every morning
There's no need..no need.
Your Higness is...
How shall I put it.
You know..with child...
Take this medicine with a cup of wine.
Take it three times every day.
Soon the nausea will stop.
No one must know of this.
Rest easy. No one will.
The doctor.. has the look of a man with not long to live.
Doctor!
Last night the water in the
Chakrai Canal was extremely low.
The doctor's body floated upstream and blocked the watergate.
Everyone could see it.
I ran to confirm it with my own eyes.
Then I reported it to Lady Srisatcha.
Why did you report it to her?
Because the doctor was seen entering the lnner Court.
Lady Srisatcha is the head of the Palace Guards.
Thus it was imperative she be informed at once.
And is there anyone who knows what business this Chinese doctor had in the lnner Palace?
It seems there isn't anyone who knows anything at all.
It's time Your Highness was at his studies.
Can't I stay just a little longer?
You are the heir to the throne.
One day you will be King.
You above all must obey the rules of the Court which say it is high time for your
Pal. Ianguage lesson.
Let me guess.
You are having difficulties with the High Consort.
She knows she's the Kings favourite.
That's why she's so arrogant.
The prince was so happy playing with his pony.
But nevertheless, she had to force him to his lessons.
She was quite right.
It's the High Consorts responsibilty to teach the Prince his duty.
Oh, now you're on her side.
She can do no wrong.
Of course not.
But the woman does have many good qualities.
That's why she's the Kings favorite.
I find it hard to appreciate her good qualities as long as she intends harm to both of us.
At the gate hangs a bell.
Any citizen in the Kingdom who has a just complaint may ring the bell.
King Ramkamhaeng will come and listen to his peoples grievances.
Does Your Highness know from which section that derives?
The section about complaints is that right, Brahmin?
Quite right, Your Highness.
All right.
Enough law for one day.
Tommorrow I'll teach Your Highness the Rules of War.
Your Highness will enjoy that.
Srisin, come with me.
Out! All of you.
I burn with frustration seeing you, being near you, pretending indifference. unable to hold you, unable to kiss you to satisfy my hunger for you.
You must be careful.
If someone sees us..
If anything should happen to you.
How could I go on living?
Don't forget.
I'm a humble chapel custodian.
One day you will be more than that.
You are a member of the dynasty of U-Thong.
As great or greater than the Suphanabhumi or the Praruang.
Soon the U-Thong shall rule again in Arothaya.
What do you mean?
What I mean is the U-Thong dynasty. will rule again in Arothaya according to its rightful destiny.
But there is something you must do first.
So that we can be together without having to skulk in the shadows.
Isn't that what we want?
Out. Everybody out.
What can I do for you, brother?
Kill Prince Thien and Suriyothai and every single one of their breed.
I'll lose my home and my head.
No. You'll become second King.
You'll take Prince Tien's position.
What are you saying?
I'm saying you'll become the Second King.
Second King Chan!
In 1 545, the year of the Snake.
The fire is at the Grand Palace, is it not?
No. it looks to be at Yot Market.
Sir Pinit. How did it happen?
It started at Kalahom pier then moved to the rear of the Palace and the market.
That's virtually the whole city!
Who's in charge?
Lord Mahesena has taken the entire army to fight the fire.
Captain Raj Saneha. Take all our men and give him all the help you can.
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Captain, wait.
I don't think our men should leave the palace.
Whyever not?
I can't explain.
But if an enemy wishes you harm then a crisis like this gives them the perfect opportunity
Please come this way,
Your Highness
It's safer than the bedroom.
Your Highnes. Don't.
Don't. That's... the Ming vase.
This one is still alive.
Who hired you for this work?
The Khmer assassins,
Your Highness. From Lavoa.
And who hired them?
Someone who can afford to pay them,
Your Highness
To believe that, you must have proof.
Am I not right,
Captain Raja Seneha?
In 1 545, the year of the Dragon, the eleventh lunar month.
The Shan army is attacking
Chiang Mai.
Queen Jeraprapa is asking the Lao army for help.
She does not inform King Chai Raja.
Lord Klang and Lord Soon crossing the Mae Khong River
On Wednesday 9th.
On the second lunar month.
Chiang Mai will sorely pay for this.
I will not let the pride of Ayothaya... be insulted like this.
Furthermore, Queen Jeraprapa must have sided with Lan Chang more so than Ayothaya.
For she is the aunt of Pra Chai Chettha the King of Lan Chang.
So she had me fooled like a baby
I have only just left Lanna. and she immediately sided with
Lan Chang.
Ayothaya shall take revenge to equal this horrendous betrayal.
Lompoon,a frontier town of Chiang Mai.
Tuesday, the third day of the waxing moon of the fourth lunar month.
Extinguish a fire.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Hold him tightly, he will be in great pain.
The King has been injured.
He has been hit by the Yuan's guns.
If he is to die the kingdom will be without a ruler.
It is time for you to make a decision, Your Majesty.
What decision?
To prepare your troops.
If the King should die, the sole person who can protect the Kingdom is you.
But he is not yet dead.
It may be too late by then because the High Consort
Srisudachan, would surely not let this opportunity pass.
This poison, will solve all your problems.
You meanfor me to poison him?
Or would you prefer to be punished?
But that's not important.
It is the unborn child you are carrying, the one who should rule
Ayothaya one day, who will be doomed along with you.
Then, the U - Thong dynasty will be no more.
When I was wounded do you know whose face was constantly on my mind?
It was your face no one else's.
I am a fool.
This war with Yuan... made me perceive clearly who is the one who truly loves me.
I will elevate you,
My Lady.
"to be my Queen, as you deserve," for all your devotion.
But still this is not enough to equal your virtues.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Get the doctor, immediately.
Your Majesty!
I have been poisoned.
If it is poison why isn't it affecting you?
Your Highness
All of you are in on the plot.
Traitors!
Who brought in the wine?
Soy, Your Highness.
She poisoned the king.
She must die.
Take them away.
Torture them and make them tell us who is behind this deed.
Then, remove their heads and impale them on spikes in the town square.
What did you say?
His Majesty was poisoned?
Yes, Lord Chakri asked me to fetch you.
You are to go to the Grand Palace immediately.
I feel much better.
Almost back to normal, father.
These are the usual symptoms, unbearable temperature and fever, then, almost total recovery as if nothing had ever happened.
Then, the poison will spread once more.
This time it will be almost like a burning fire within.
Blood will flow out from the nine orifices.
You'll even sweat blood.
You'll suffer for days uh.before.... your final death.
Are there any medicines to cure this?
There is no such cure once the poison is inside your veins.
-How much longer do I have?
-No more than seven nights.
Hail great and glorious king
In the year 1 546, the year of the horse.
On the fifteenth day of the waxing moon of the sixth month,
King Chai Raja, who ruled in accordance with the ten righteous commandments of kingship, whose royal decree resounds like the roar of a lion, is pleased to elevate,
Nor Praputchao, Prince Yotfa, to kingship, and the High Consort Srisudachan, to be queen, and to serve as regent until such a time as Prince Yotfa, comes of age, and is ready to assume the mantle of kingship.
It is hereby decreed that the second king, Pra Tien Raja, is to assume guardianship of King Yotfa. from this moment until King Yotfa comes of age.
Samlee, tell me who is behind the master plan.
Your sentence will be reduced.
I regret to see such beauty vanish by a deadly whip.
Name Prince Tien as a plotter, as a conspirator to poison the King.
Prince Tien is the one who poisoned His Majesty.
Confess the truth to keep your head on your shoulders.
Prince Tien, Prince Tien.
What is it, whore?
Prince Tien forced me to poison
His Majesty.
Prince Tien poisoned His Majesty.
The handmaid confessed before the sword descended, that Prince Tien Raja was behind the assassination plot.
I don't believe that is so.
Prince Tien Raja is not the one who poisoned me.
Then, who did it? I'll take him into custody right now."
It was you, Srisudachan.
You planned it with Lord Chinaraj and poisoned me.
Ayothaya must be under the U- Thong Dynasty forever and ever
Now, the end of the Supanna-bhumi
Dynasty is at hand.
The next king must be the child in my womb, the one who is of the U-Thong Dynasty, and whose father is also of the U - Thong Dynasty.
E-Meon has stated
That you are the one who poisoned and assassinated the King
Do you think what she has stated is the truth?
If I believe that whore, who will say anything to save her from punishment.
I would have come with a full battallion of soldiers.
Not only accompanied by a mere handful of soldiers.
So as not to be laughed at by Captain Raj Saneha.
Then why have you come to this palace?
This whore is blaming you publicly,
Your Highness.
In the presence of the noblemen and other citizens.
The regent won't allow Your Highness to escape the punishment, sire.
What ever you plan to do,
Please consider carefully
Captain Raj Saneha and His Royal
Highness soldiers would not let your lordship get close to His Royal Highness.
It seems to be that way.
But I came to Your Highness now to tell Your Highness
That at one o'clock.
I will return to this palace again with the royal troops
But between now and then, I trust
Your Highness will find a way to Escape from this perilous situation.
What's happened? Fire?
Wait, My robes.
I have to don my robes first.
Search the whole place.
Don't let any one get away.
Go on.
Search the whole area.
Those are Captain Raj
Saneha's soldiers.
Where?
I said stop!
Don't you all have any sense of right and wrong?
How dare you fight on sacred grounds?
-Get Prince Tien!
-Stop.
Prince Tien has been ordained and is now in the monkhood.
He will be under protection until this crisis is over.
He has the immunity.
But Prince Tien had been plotting against the late king.
I received a royal decree from the late king. if there is no evidence implicating Prince Tien as a conspirator, then no one is to harm him.
Especially while he is wearing the yellow robes of the Lord Buddha.
No one can not harm him.
In 1546, the year of the Horse.
Sixth lunar month.
In 1 548, the year of the Monkey.
Sunday, the fifth night of the waxing moon of the eighth lunar month.
The messengers from the Northern provinces report
Those Lords and magistrates are plotting to rebel
They are secretly meeting aiming to break away to offer obeisance to
Hongsawadi's king, Ta-beng Shweti.
It's all because the king is so young.
Always playing and having fun
He can not rule the country.
Under these dire circumstances, why don't you take the matters into your own hands?
I am only a woman why should the northern provinces hold me in awe?
Now that they have rebelled,
I see Lord Worawongsa as the one to take over until
His Majesty is of age.
Is there anyone who dares to disagree with me?
The year 1 548, the year of the Monkey.
Sunday, the fifth night of the waxing moon of the eighth lunar month.
I am at my wit's end to name exactly what is the cause of
His Majesty's illness.
The symptoms appear to be a gastric problem which makes it difficult for him to breathe.
I'll get some medicine.
How long before he recovers?
Not more than three nights.
What did you say?
King Yotfa has died?
Yes, Your Highness, at dawn.
How did the king meet his demise?
Laung Tip O-sot pondered deeply on this and it is still not understood.
The first symptoms were not at all serious, but then, His Majesty suddenly passed away at dawn.
His Majesty's death is no different from that of King Chai Raja.
Sir, Raj Seneha.
From now on we must guard His Highness will great heed.
Yes, Your Highness,
I cannot tolerate it any longer.
Never before has the regime been so disreputable.
Even during
King Rama-thibodi's reign people wrote anonymous messages against him.
At the time the king commanded the execution of many mandarins.
But now,
Lord Chinaraj has been in power for only a short time and there are riots everywhere.
The northern provinces and defiantly vying for independence.
The southern provinces are all under the sway of the treacherous.
Chan of Mahalok Village
Your Excellency should be careful what you say.
There are many who favor
Lord Chinaraj and Chan, the Second King.
My heart aches for I am a military commander, not only unable to protect the young king, but worse, I cannot even arrest the assassins and punish them for their heinous crimes, even though I know who they are.
Lord Mahasena dared utter those words?
How arrogant!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Lord Rajapakdi urged me to inform you that.
Lord Mahasena is planning to rebel against the king.
I think, we should not continue...
...to let him be a thorn in our side.
Your Excellency must not bear arms into the lnner Royal residence!
Bah! I am the military commander, my first obligation is to protect
His Majesty.
Not this time. not even a minister like yourself.
It is a royal decree.
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you, women?
Open the gates now
You dare to plan a rebellion.
Don't be slow
Clear the way, now!
I have business with the
High Consort.
She does not wish to see a traitor like you.
Your drunken lout, kill him!
I have just received a message that
Lord Mahasena is dead.
What's the cause?
He was assassinated at the rear palace gate.
-But it is not known who planned it.
-Who else?
It seems that we cannot avoid calamity.
Lord Mahasena was the only noble mandarin who had the courage to defend
Prince Tien, and the rest of the royal family.
There is one person who might be able to protect us.
I volunteer to call upon this person
Who is this courageous person?
Lord Pitsanulok,
Commander in chief of the Late King
Chai Raja,
Lord Pitsanulok's army
The border at Cha Gang Rao.
Have you see Lord Pitsanulok's army come this way?
That way, Sir.
Princess Suriyothai asked me to inform you that Ayothaya is in grave danger.
There is chaos everywhere, people are suffering immensely.
That's what I have heard.
What does Princess Suriyothai want me to do?
She feels that you alone. can put an end to all the suffering and restore peace eternally though out the kingdom.
She would like you to return to Ayothaya to save the country.
I must fight against the minority rebels in Kampangpet province.
How can I get away from here and be there at the same time?
She asked me to personally remind you of an oath you had given in front of her.
A warrior's words once said should there ever be a day when she needs to avail of your strength and wisdom then as soon as you learn about it you'll come immediately, without delay no matter how far away. you will be there.
Lord Pitsanulok.
Has Captain Raj Saneha told you why I summoned you here?
Even if there were no compelling reasons, if it is your wish
I will come.
You must have known already. that the Kingdom is in danger.
I knew from the very beginning of this reign with my lack of wisdom and strength that I would be unable to do anything.
The cause of all this is Lord Worawongsa and Srisudachan.
Were it not for them the whole Kingdom would be at peace.
But then, we would be without a king.
Prince Tien Raja has all the might and the right and the legitimacy to rule Ayothaya.
Once the Kingdom is devoid of a ruler
Prince Tien should rule with no opposition,
Or do you disagree with me?
Mother ordered me to bring this to you
My business is complete,
I beg you farewell.
Won't you stay a while?
It's a long journey back
The gate keepers could use a rest.
I'm afraid not, Sir.
My mission is finished.
Then, let me brew you some tea.
It would be an honour for me.
I can't perceive what is in your mind, Your Highness.
What is it that's not clear to you?
It isn't clear why is that you sacrificed your life and your family.
And yet you are giving the throne to Pra Tien Raja.
It likes killing a snake and throwing it to the bird.
Don't ever say a thing like that again.
Pra Tien Raja has the legitimate right to reign as king.
Your enjoy the same right and legitimacy, You Highness.
You Father is from the lineage.. of the House of Sukho thai which rules that region, and your mother is from the lineage of the House of Suphanna-bhumi the same as King Chai Raja.
But I am not wish to inherit the throne.
Is it not because of
Princess Sawasdiraj, Your Highness.
I wonder
Why Lord Piren is coming down to Ayuthaya for what purpose.
-Dum.
-Yes, Your Highness.
From now on, you must keep an eye on Lord Pitsanulok.
Iike a tiger eyeing his prey.
If there is anything suspicious,
-to inform me or Sir Han.
-Yes, Your Highness.
This plan will succeed only if we can assassinate
Lord Worawongsa and Srisudachan right away.
You must not underestimate that regent Chan.
The knight of the unholy throne.
If you cut the roots, the tree will die.
When they are gone, where will Second King Chan be able to hide?
I'm not an enemy.
I'm here to join your fight against injustice.
But you are a royal guard.
Are you thinking of spying on us?
If I had meant you any harm would I have come alone?
I am ready to fight and sacrifice my life for the realm.
But, I have only one doubt.
What do you doubt?
If we eliminate Lord Worawongsa to whom would you offer the throne?
Sir Sriyod, Captain Raj Sasaneha
Wait for me in front of the chapel.
-Do not let anyone inside.
-Yes, Sir.
I am a monk.
I should not deal with worldly matters.
If our plan is successful
...the kingdom will be without a king.
You are the only one who is entitled to rule the kingdom.
It we succeed and the kingdom still is without a king. the people will suffer anyway.
This is similar to the Lord Buddha having to defeat mara.
If I refuse, it will be as if I have no feelings for the people and I would let them suffer.
Therefore, I will accept your request to rule the realm.
May the secured beings of Ayothaya give you blessings to succeed and subdue the enemies restore glory to religion. and peace throughout the kingdom.
In 1 548, Saturday, the sixth day of the waxing moon of the ninth lunar month.
Your Majesty.
I have brought the political bureau of Lopburi to inform you about an auspicious elephant that has been spotted in the forests of Lopburi.
It should be caught as a royal elephant for His Majesty.
I'm going to be promoted.
This great elephant, is it that powerful?
Ten knotted ropes cannot hold him
We are not bestowed with enough merit to capture it, Your Majesty.
There is no one but you in the whole kingdom. who possesses enough merit to catch that elephant Your Majesty.
Enough.
I 'll go get it myself.
In 1 548, Sunday, the second night of the waxing moon of the fourth lunar month.
Tell us exactly
What you intend to do.
Tomorrow at dawn
King Worawongsa will set out and capture the great elephant that is being lured toward
Pleum Temple.
The King will go up to Sa Bua Canal.
We will block the way and assassinate him at Rang Temple, near Pla Maw canal.
Lord lndrathep's barge are our men.
They all will have their weapons hidden.
At the right moment, they will attack the Portuguese mercenaries.
If Second King Chan
Should find out. he will bring his troops to aid
King Worawongsa, his brother.
Then what will we do?
I plan to get Captain Raj Saneha. to disguise himself as a boxer bodyguard.
In that disguise, he will wait for
Second King Chan at Seua Temple.
If he crosses through the palace gates, he will immediately get shot by Captain Raj Saneha.
Lord Pichai and his troops will hide on the eastern side of Sa Bua Canal.
North of Pla Maw Canal.
And Lord Sawankalok, you will hide on the western side, in case those on the royal barge try to escape in that direction.
Sir Sriyod, take your boat and wait in the middle of Sa Bua Canal. and I will wait on Pla Maw Canal.
That will prevent the royal barge from escaping in that direction.
I think, that Lord Piren is up to something.
A little while after sunset
I saw his men armed and on the way to Sa Bua Cannel by boat.
Tomorrow morning the King and the High Consort Srisudachan will go to catch the great elephant and will travel past Sa Bua Canal.
That doesn't sound right
Puek go ready and arm the elephant for me,
I must go and warn the king at the Grand Palace.
Sua Temple
In front of Regent Chan's palace.
Help me and I will reward you handsomely
The only thing
I want is
Whose boat is that?
Mine, Lord Piren-thora-thep here to chop off your head.
Kill them all!
Kill them Kill them
Head the boat to shore, now.
Get off
There might be a way to survive this
What about the king?
We must save you and the prince first.
Get off the boat, quickly.
I will hold them back.
Kham kaew, take the High Consort to shore.
Fire!
You have sinned terribly.
You can even kill an innocent child.
Someone like you will only bring down the country and the religion.
-You should die for you crimes.
-But not by you hand.
Hurry, try to escape before they kill the prince.
-No!
-Wait, Lord Pitsanulok.
Prince Srisin is descended from the late King Chai Raja he should not be executed.
Prince Srisin is the son of the
High Consort Srisudachan.
Not to kill him would go against custom, and he will remain a thorn in our sides.
Is there not enough bloodshed?
If you only cut down the tree and leave the roots the next king and the rest of the dynasty will be under continuous threat.
If not for the sake of the late king, then for me.
I plead with you not to kill the child.
What are you waiting for,
Pudkrong?
Hurry and take Prince Srisin to our boat.
Let Lady Pudkrong take the prince to the boat
As Princess Suriyothai wishes.
Lord lndrathep help my child.
Lord Pirenthorathep has taken the initiative come forward.
I bestow upon you the title of Somdej Pra Maha
Dhammaracha-thiraj.. governor of Pitsanulok.
Princess Sawat-diraj come sit by his side.
I bestow upon you
...the title of Wisut-krasat-tri, the principal queen of Pitsanulok.
I wish to let it be known.. to all sacred beings that from now on should any harm befall the families of
Somdej Pra Maha
Dhamma-racha-thiraj
Lord Sri Dhamma-sokka-raj
Lord Mahasena and Lord Pakdi-nuchit and should there be any bloodshed, that rule will be treated as a traitor against my word.
May he be condemned and perish under the royal tiered umbrella
May all sacred beings bring death upon such a person within three days or three months but no later than three years.
Let him be forever deprived of happiness.
In 1 548, the year of the Monkey, the eleventh month.
The news of the trouble in Ayothaya reaches Hongsawadi
The king of Hongsa decides if they should attack Ayothaya now the Hongsa army should win easily.
The Hongsa king then conscripts a troop of 30,000 men"
700 elephants, 3000 horses.
Assign Bayinnaung as vanguard.
Lord of Prome as supply.
Lord Bassein as rear guard and march toward Ayothaya.
It looks like the black-tongued king of Hongsawadi has ill intentions toward Ayothaya.
The Burmese have prepared their boats so they could cross the Kong River from Martaban shore to Moulmein shore
For the cavalrymen and soldiers to cross easily.
There is going to be trouble.
Bay, Bai.
-Yes, lord.
-You two and Jormia go scout and find out when the Honsa troops are going to cross the river
We have watched for seven days and seven nights.
King Hongsa's troops have successfully crossed the Kong river...
...from Martaban shore to Moulmein shore.
It took them seven nights?
Are there such tremendous numbers of Burmese?
It's just cavalry and soldiers
...not including the elephant troops that crossed the river some eight hundred kilometers above.
King Hongsa assembled his troops at Martaban.
From there, crossed the Kong river which way would King Hongsa's troops enter Ayothaya?
Will it be Tongpapoom, the Three Pagodas Pass or Rahang in Tak province?
I expect King Hongsa would maneuver his troops in the direction of the Three Pagodas area.
Why do you think that?
Capt. Kla mentioned great numbers of Burmese soldiers and King Hongsa has brought many cannons along.
He would need to travel by water to convey the food supplies, cannons and gun powder.
All of you evacuate to Ayothaya immediately.
-Lord Jakri
-Yes, Your Majesty.
Gather some soldiers and set up camp at Lumplee field to intercept King Hongsa's troops from Ayothaya.
Phukao Thong Monastery,
Lumplee Field.
Work faster.
You want the Burmese to be here before you going to work.
Lazy asses!
I think they are doing their best.
Be we have to dig a lot more the distance from Praya Ram fortress to Kue na canal is a long way.
I heard that King Hongsa's troops have passed the Three Pagodas.
Yes.
My spy told me that King Hongsa had assembled his troops at Sam Sob a while ago intending to build rafts to carry soldiers and food supplies down the Noi river?
It is just as well that we have these spies and are able to follow his plans.
But still, we are not beyond the enemy, their spies are familiar with Ayothaya.
Hold on! now that you've mentioned this, it reminds me a monk once told me there's an old man who lives in a hut by Lumplee field always welcoming strangers.
He has homing pigeons in his hut.
The Lumplee Villagers call him the
Birdman " Tao nok "
Does anyone know his background?
No one.
He lives near the temple where I stay yet I have never seen him pay a visit to the temple.
How strange.
That's it.
-Bay!
-Yes, sir.
Gather some men
...to capture this Birdman at Lumplee field,
Yes, sir.
He spotted us.
Let's go!
From Mou Lmein to the Three Pagodas in less than a month?
How did King Hongsa manouvre his troops so fast?
King Hongsa must first assemble his troops at Sam Sob.. before moving further down to Kanchanaburi that should delay him further more.
That could take about two months?
Or less
King Hongsa may reach Ayothaya very soon.
I volunteer. to intercept the troops of the black tongued king at Kanchanaburi.
A handful of soldiers?
How can we repel hundreds of thousands of King Hongsa's troops?
Kanchanaburi's fortress is in an ideal location it stands on the cliff about where the Kwae Yai river that joins Tapern river.
The two rivers form a natural wall..
King Hongsa will find it impossible to cross.
I will be able to resist the Burmese troops until your troops are ready.
You speak as though you will never return to Ayothaya.
Kanchanaburi Fortress,
Town of Kao Chon Kai.
Move it!
Move!
Even though Kanchanaburi is a small town it has cost me many soldiers and three wasted days to reach here.
I must punish these prisoners of war, to set an example to others!
Executioner!
Take these prisoners young, old and behead them.
Burn down their city and all the temples. and make it known throughout the land that any governors of Ayothaya who rebel against me, will be doomed, with their clans, to die like the people of Kanchanaburi.
The Burmese troops have filled
Phukao Thong field, sir!
They have detected us now.
You must be cautious.
We have a huge number of soldiers more than ten to one
It is the recklessness that will cause our downfall.
Might you be too old for this battle, Minye Sihatu?
Give the signal and charge!
Give the signal to fire!
Lord Chakri's camp at Phukao Thong is about to be taken over.
Phra Maha Dhamma-raja has brought his troops from the north to join up with Lord Jakri's
King Prome's troops outnumber us greatly far more than those of Lord Chakri and Pitsanulok combined.
We need to render support for the royal troops.
Go forward!
Go forward!
Command a withdrawal now,
Tado Dhammaraja!
Or we'll lose all our people!
Give the signal to withdraw!
Retreat!
Let's head back to our camp,
Sormeng.
The Burmese troops outnumber the Ayothaya troops ten to one. why can you not overthrow
Lord Chakri's camp?
Instead of withdrawing in haste
Iike a panicky dog running from a lion degenerating the King's honour
You probably think it is because of the cannons
On the fortresses bombarding us?
Absolutely, Your Majesty.
The cannons on the fortress are able to fire across many miles.
Just like Nandasu said.
Those cannons are three way long.
Foot long mortars, Your Majesty.
It would be easier just to destroy the cannons the only way to succeed would be to bombard them with our cannons.
While we are on the elephant's back
This will side track them and we'll have the time to fill up the gulley on the other side.
Then, we can take over
Lord Jakri's camp.
Let it be to take Lord Chakri's camp in the next battle.
I will make up for
Tado Dhamma-raja's failure.
If anyone gets to the camp and opens the gates for our troops.
I will reward that person with 1 000 gold changes.
All cannons fire!
Fire!
Seize this camp!
No one would dare to stand on the rampart.
Their cannon fire is too heavy.
We can resist them a moment longer.
Pra Maha Dhamma-raja is crossing the gully right now.
I am not waiting for his troops!
But I will deal with the Burmese up on the rampart so they know that people of Ayothaya have no fear!
King Hongsa had said a reward of 1 000 gold chang to be given to any person who can open this camp's gate. make haste and do just so.
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Burn in hell!
Kill them, do not withdraw!
You are here just in time.
The Burmese are full of vigor and vim. competing to open the gates expecting the reward from King Hongsa.
If that is so.
I volunteer to open the gates for
His Majesty King Ta-Beng Shweti.
I need you to carry a message to him.
But you will carry this message on you!
Your Majesty Hongsawadi the great.
For you have declared in public an offer of one thousand changes worth of gold to any brave person who is able to open the gate.
Now, I Maha Dharma-raja
The ruler of the Northern province, has done so.
Your Majesty should make haste and pay such reward.
I and my troops shall await you in front of the camp at Makamyong field.
If you are as mighty as they say then make haste and bring my gold instantly.
Spare me Spare me
Maha Dhama-raja now awaits us in front of the camp.
I will take this perfect opportunity to erase his insult.
You should think this over
Maha Dhama-raja is mockingly provoking us to lure you forward.
Mahathama-raja awaits not far from the camp.
If he blunders, he can retreat conveniently.
My tactic is
Iet Prajao Prae go into this battle with Maha Dhama-raja whom if we are rid of.
Ayothaya will be mine.
Our children and l have thought it over the battle is a most difficult one.
The courtiers, soldiers male and female all need to devote their lives to defend the Ayothaya kingdom.
I thank you dearly but it is a man's job to defend the country.
Leave it to me and my brave men.
This Burmese war may look dangerous. with all of Ta-beng Shweti's men, horses and elephants storming over us like a flood.
Should anything happen to you,
Ayothaya
...will lose its crown and be no more.
Our children and l are ready to fight beside you in every battlefield.
Give a signal to attack
Archers!
Prepare!
Fire!
Prepare!
Fire!
Keep fighting!
Don't let them near the camp!
The royal guards have come to aid us.
Yes, Your Majesty the King.
Yes.
The Royal troop has moved it's force!
He is not as cowardly as they say must be expecting to fight with me
How well suited!
The great spirits of Burma have inspired the King of Ayothaya to emerge and hasten our victory
Great!
We shall trap this King
Signal the King of Prome to withdraw. and bring the Royal troops to our trap.
Look! The Burmese are withdrawing.
Their troops are scattered and dispersing everywhere.
May l?
Give the withdrawal signal!
We have been tricked!
Maha Dhama-raja has fallen for King Hongsa's plan.
Sir Kojasit!
Prepare the royal elephant
Plai Kao Chakarpat now!
But this is walking straight into
King Hongsa's trap!
To take your life!
If I don't go to this battle
Ayothaya's soldiers will be dispirited.
No matter how enormous the enemy's troops are
I still must go into this battle!
Pudkrong! Order Srichaithip to prepare
Plai Song Suriya Krasat...
I will join His Majesty.
Are you sure, Your Majesty?
It is very dangerous!
You will surely be harmed.
But if anything should happen to our King do you think I will survive?
But our lives are not important
I and my husband have no care for our lives our main concern are the people of Ayothaya and Ayothaya itself.
If the King should die we will also die at the hands of the Burmese.
The royal army is here!
Urge the elephant to hasten on!
Kill them, kill them all!
In 1 549, the year of the Cock.
Queen Suriyothai, the
Queen of King Chakkaphat... the ruler of Ayothaya sacrificed her life in the war against Hongsa in order to save her husband from death at the hand of their enemy.
THE CUCKOO
Get changed.
It's ready.
Come on, Private.
Hold it.
- Who chose this place?
- Me. Don't you like it?
It's lovely. Thanks.
- What's he saying?
- It's a good spot for a sniper.
- Leave him his glasses?
- Yes.
Sit here until we've gone.
- Take the gun, and he'll shoot.
- I don't shoot in the back.
They all say that, but last week
Big Yussi got a bullet here.
Good luck, Private. Goodbye.
Down by the hill, you see?
I see. Then where?
Past the burned bridge, there's a ford...
You're an honest officer.
I believe you're innocent.
Stop babbling!
Comrade Lieutenant, for your journey!
Let's go!
Good luck, Comrade Lieutenant!
Careful!
Comrade Lieutenant, you can see the state of the road!
Comrades, give us a push!
Mister!
I recognize you! You worked at the shooting range.
What?
By the market.
What market?
In Bezhetsk.
No.
Like him, but you used to have a moustache.
- Stop talking to the prisoner!
- Get lost!
Thanks, lads.
Much further?
Much further, Captain?
I never used this road.
Comrade Junior Lieutenant, may I...
Comrade Junior Lieutenant, they're our fighter planes.
I can see that!
Comrade Junior Lieutenant, can I go to the toilet?
Ok.
Don't run off though - be a shame to shoot you.
Comrade Junior Lieutenant, have you got some paper?
Only your diary.
But that s evidence...
It's all about you and your friend...
...and your anti-Soviet plotting.
If I had my way, you'd be shot without a trial...
I won't harm you. I'll just take a little of your strength.
The sick one needs it.
Don't worry.
Where am I?
This amulet will help you fight the weakness in your body.
I have to...
Don't be shy.
Go on!
You'll get better. Sleep.
So, Lieutenant? Didn't work out?
I'll piss on your grave yet!
Good morning.
I have to get the chain off.
I need a smith.
Do you speak Finnish?
I want to get this off!
Do you understand?
You want the iron off?
You were a prisoner?
I don't understand you. Do you speak Finnish? You're a Lapp?
I need a smith. Is there a man?
I need to get the chain off!
I can't walk like this!
You shout a lot.
Shouting never broke an iron.
I'll have a look, my husband had some tools.
Anything you say, Madam.
Your husband?
Sick?
Wounded?
Fritz. SS...
Russian.
I'm not German. You think
I'm from the North division?
They make us wear a uniform, so we won't surrender.
Because you don't like Germans, especially in uniform.
Haende hoch! Hitler kaputt!
It'll be hard if that's all the German you know.
Don't worry, the war's over for me.
I'll get the chain off and go home.
Do you understand?
A cuckoo - a condemned sniper, for crying out loud...
You were probably in that car.
I couldn't understand why the Russian planes fired at you?
Shoot, you scum. My lot'll put me up against a wall anyway...
I'm Veiko. And you? Ivan?
- Get lost!
- Gerlost!
Veiko, Gerlost... And you?
Anni. I just told you my real name!
You can put the eye on me now.
Anni, Gerlost, Veiko...
A pleasure to meet you.
It's a shame we haven't got anything to celebrate with.
Don't worry about me chatting on - it's the nerves.
A condemned man that survived - that means a lot.
I see...
I don't think they're pleased to see me.
I'm sorry I've disturbed your peace.
I'll take the chain off and go.
Come on.
I'll give you the tools.
These are my husband's tools.
Your husband makes
Lapland knives?
You're a sharp lad.
Probably had to fight the girls off.
Or did you have a few?
I'll take the chain off and go.
It's my fourth year without a man.
Last night I hugged the Russian...
He slept, but I was aching below the tummy.
You smell bad.
All men smell of iron and death now.
Yes, lots of midges.
When I was chained on the rock,
I thought they'd eat me away.
Have you got a sauna?
Can I have a wash?
Your skin s white - whiter than any woman I've seen.
The midges bit you because you wash too often.
Four years without a man, and then two at once.
Have the spirits read my thoughts?
He's got my skirt on! Why're you dressed like a woman?!
Grinning, Fritz? Won't be grinning for much longer!
A good knife.
Gerlost, I told you, the war's over for me.
I don't want to kill, but I don't want to be killed. Understand?
Go on, finish me off.
That's my husband's knife - it's mine when he's not here.
Don't go killing each other!
I don't plan to bury you both.
What're you waiting for?
Think I'll kill you? The war's over, my friend! Understand?
Peace. The war's over.
Lev Tolstoi, War and Peace.
Shoot, scum.
Lev Tolstoi, War and Peace.
Understand?
I understand you're a fascist, you burnt Yasnaya Polyana.
I'm not a fascist. I'm a Finn.
I was at university, then the war - I didn't want to fight.
You Idiot! Fyodor Dostoevsky.
The Idiot...
I can't understand a word...
I'm tired of fighting!
Ernest Hemingway -
Farewell to Arms!
I don't know Russian.
I should have studied it.
Sorry, Gerlost.
Abominable and miserable...
It's beautiful here...
I was a condemned man. Chained to a rock like Prometheus.
But I thought about it, and saw how to get the chain off.
I could have made fire without the glasses.
If I'd shot into dry grass, say.
But the glasses were safer...
You don't understand me, but that's not important.
In this filth and muck it's an honor to remain alive.
The main thing is we're alive.
You and me.
I hope people will look back in horror at what they did at war.
Maybe they won't.
Man is a strange being.
Dostoevsky said that.
You can make a lot of good things with it.
He's cheered up, the fascist.
I never shared the views of the fascists. I'm a democrat.
Fascist, all the same.
Democracy!
Come and eat.
Let's go and eat.
Worried I'll thump you? I would, if it wasn't for the concussion.
It's my second. First was in the winter of '42-'43.
Can I have some more?
You eat a lot. To eat a lot, you have to work a lot.
Thank you.
Thank you, very tasty.
I don't drink coffee.
But thanks anyway.
Stupid woman.
Got a smoke?
Got a snout?
Bitte eine Zigarette.
If I had, I'd smoke it myself.
Thanks, fascist.
Take it off, I'll wash it.
Take that off as well.
You just love wrapping yourself up in clothes.
You're not bad.
Girls like your kind.
Fritz!
She seems to like you.
What're you in a dress for?
Take it off, you look silly.
Gerlost!
Gerlost, you're shy. The Lapps don't understand that.
They live a simple life.
You rabbit a lot. My ears are ringing from all those words.
She hasn't got much fish ready.
The winter will be hard.
We're just extra mouths to feed.
We have to go quickly.
My eyesight's fine.
I started wearing glasses to look more serious at university.
My family had difficulty getting money for my studies.
In Stockholm they look down on Finns...
So, I started wearing glasses.
Never thought they'd save me.
And she hasn't got much hay ready.
Maybe just enough for the deer...
Yes, be off, chatterbox!
Let me help!
Don't come near me, or
I get wet and want to shout!
She's angry.
The girl's smitten.
What?
I said she's smitten.
I'll cover the wood in clay...
The wood will burn and make a chimney for a sauna.
We'll boil or fry them, then eat them.
You want to go to the other world?
Drink the broth of toadstools - those will just make you sick.
Can't be bothered?
Don't worry!
I'll cook them.
The sergeant in my battalion cooked them wonderfully!
Gerlost's eating mushrooms to commune with the spirits.
Maybe he's a shaman or a wizard?
Let him rest. He's still weak after the concussion.
I'll do it myself.
I think you're better at other things.
I wouldn't mind if you threw me down on a deerskin, lad.
I've already forgotten what it's like.
Don't kid around - I haven't seen a woman in two months.
Now, even a hunchback looks like a princess to me.
You've got tender hands, you're not used to man's work.
You probably only know how to kill.
That's not work, just big children thinking that taking...
...a life lengthens their own.
Put the barrel back afterwards.
Ma'am, I need salt.
I'm not mad enough to eat mushrooms!
I see! In the house!
Scum!
The water brought a letter.
The political officer informed on me! Snotty-nosed kid!
Hadn't served a week at the front, and he informs!
I was like a father to the boy.
He writes: "I inform you that
I do not share the views..."
The water washed out the words.
The water in the stream is good.
If you put laundry in it, the next day it's clean.
Not much flour left.
I put a little wood in.
He says my poems are rubbish!
Jealousy, maybe?
He only writes to inform.
Yesenin himself told me to write.
My dad was a taxi-driver.
He picked Yesenin up one day.
I was reading out my poems.
He said you need to write.
He even signed a photograph...
Your wife? She's beautiful.
The soldier men took my husband four years ago...
See, it's Yesenin!
I wrote poems about nature, to stay sane at the front...
God knows what he saw in them.
Don't worry - you're still alive and your wife's very beautiful.
Just don't eat mushrooms, or you'll go loony.
The mushrooms'll be ready soon.
But we need some salt.
Yes. Mushrooms are bad.
They can be poisonous.
Here I am chatting away - you can't feed the deer with words!
You've ruined the iron.
I brought that barrel from over the hill!
It's a bit rough, but we can wash. It's already hot.
Gerlost, come and wash!
You get sick because you scratch your skin off.
My husband washed in a sauna in the city.
I barely cured him, and he never got sick before that.
Even taking your rifle to the sauna?
Come in.
Not bad, although the draught takes the heat out fast.
I don't like saunas. I like
Turkish baths, you understand?
Oh come on, she's not bad as a woman.
Her kind are good at housework, and they keep you awake in bed.
We had a supervisor just like her.
I invited her to the cinema once, but she didn't come.
Then she got married to a friend from work, Viktor Bychkov.
Don't know what she saw in him - ugly as sin, to be honest.
I don't understand, Gerlost.
Don't you like sauna?
I'm no specialist, I've only read how to do it...
I haven't been lucky with women.
Married twice, and both times it was a mess...
What are you so serious about?
Wash, because you smell of war and death.
A crow flew over the field,
Saw a herd of deer.
It began to count - one, two, three... Counted until daybreak.
Then it tired and crowed out:
You're so many, and I'm but one!
It crowed and went to sleep...
Let's go. Don't worry though -
I cry out when I like it.
Damn!
Don't!
Sorry, it was a bad dream.
I didn't want to scare you.
Feeling bad?
It's because you ate mushrooms.
I'll make an infusion for you - it will drive the badness out.
I liked you straight away...
He's younger, but he's still a fascist.
I'll make an infusion from herbs - you'll feel better.
I must work, or I'll be like a fox in winter, eating turds.
So, you enjoyed it with him.
I heard you moaning under him.
It really hurt me to hear.
I wanted to kill you.
Forgive me for those thoughts.
You brought me back to life.
Rest. I've got a lot of work to do.
You took my heart straight away.
I told you, Gerlost, there're no bullets.
Are you jealous because she chose me?
Don't be. She wanted a little happiness.
To hell with you! Live.
You're still young.
Haven't lived at all yet.
And I'm tired...
Tired of fighting.
My soul's emptied by the war.
I'll go and cut some wood!
I should go.
It's a herb infusion.
Drink, Gerlost.
What do you see in that fascist?
He talks a lot, and you can't understand a word.
The mushroom poison will go out of your body, you'll feel better.
Tastes nice.
Eat, I want to cry out at night again.
Don't give me that look! Or
I'll be tearing my skirts off!
Did you drink the infusion?
Go over there!
Go away! You poisoned me!
Go away, this isn't the theatre!
There's a pit over there!
Didn't you see where I went?
What're you looking at?
You're a wild man, Gerlost.
The infusion worked.
Not used to that many mushrooms.
Interesting?! What're you embarrassing me for?
Bring everyone to watch then - the dogs, the deer! Madness!
We have to fix the barn.
You're both big - I have to feed you with meat.
Much better, thanks.
I'll be off...
You're big and eat a lot.
I can't kill a deer.
Too few as it is.
Goodbye.
Thanks for the bread and salt.
Although you've got no salt.
You have good eyes, Gerlost.
But don't eat lots of mushrooms.
It's good that we've said goodbye. I can't take anymore.
It's good here, but I'm going mad. I must be tired of life.
Has Gerlost gone to get mushrooms again? Let me help!
Where're you taking them?
I just brought them!
Thank you.
You really are ugly!
Germans! Hide!
Fascists. Three of them.
One injured, and a nurse...
One's an officer. If I take them prisoner, we'll get the credit!
There're no bullets.
I'm not fighting. And there's nothing to fight with.
They'll come over the hill, and we'll be stuck out in the open.
Give me the gun!
Well, I'll take it by force.
If it wasn't for the concussion,
I'd take you out!
The war's over for me.
What do you want?
I don't need this war!
To hell with it!
I'm a man like you!
I want to live, not to fight!
I thought you were a cuckoo - a condemned sniper...
But you're just a coward!
You were crafty, throwing me in the fire.
Up all night with a bird, but still got some strength left!
You haven't understood!
I'm stuck with this idiot.
How can I explain if you don't want to understand?
I'm not a soldier!
Aren't you tired of shooting?
If you want to fight and kill your kind, go on!
I want a different life.
The world's not perfect, but life's no worse for that.
Perhaps you've never lived, Gerlost?
Always fighting, and you don't know anything else?
The world is so beautiful.
Chained to the rock, I felt it.
I wanted to write poems, music... even though I don't know how.
I'm off, Gerlost.
You haven't understood me, and
I haven't understood you...
More strength than you know what to do with?
Then come help me.
She wants help.
I've seen such machines.
They never flew here though.
What's happened?
It didn't blow up - must have run out of fuel.
Come on.
Stay here.
The infusion helped Gerlost - he's marching along happily now.
Here, read it. Probably asking you to give yourself up.
Finland's out of the war! We're not fighting each other anymore!
The war's over!
Hello common sense!
There's a dead pilot here.
Women shouldn't fight.
It's unnatural, painful to see.
Gerlost, I'm not a soldier and not the enemy.
It's written here that the Finns aren't fighting anymore.
Happy that your lot shot a plane down?
Hero! Against these kids, you're the big hero!
They were dropping leaflets.
We should bury them.
This is your lots' work.
And yours, Fritz!
I'm a Finn!
How can I tell you that I'm not fighting! The war's over!
Look, Gerlost! I'm going to break this cursed rifle!
You idiot, Gerlost. Finland's signed a truce with Russia.
'This serves as a pass home.'
Finland's surrendered?
Yes, if it helps you understand.
Although I surrendered before.
Come on, lad. Don't die.
Hold on! I'll carry you back in a flash.
Why can't you listen?
Don't die!
Don't keep quiet, groan at least, let me know you're there.
Who wounded him?
I shot by accident. I thought he wanted to hit me with the gun.
What happened?
Stupid - it'll be a shame if he dies. The Finns surrendered.
Maybe the Germans gave in too and the war s over.
Go get some water!
He's leaving us.
I can't remember how to keep him from the land of the dead.
My granny knew how.
She'd turn into a dog and bring him back with her bark.
I'll turn my little finger into the dying one.
I'll hold his hand firm, turn you from the path of death!
I'll stop you on the road to the land of the dead.
Hear the dog howl and come back!
I'll hold you firm and stop you leaving your body!
Hear the dog howl!
It protects your hearth.
It calls you back from the path to the kingdom of the dead!
Hear my howling! I'm catching up, jumping around you.
I'm biting your hands and legs, not letting you go on!
Return to your body!
Hear the cry of the dog!
Turn off the road to the dead!
I turn your soul into a floating log!
You're carried by the waves,
I'm the wind.
I'm a strong northern wind carrying you to the shore!
Hear the dog howl on the shore!
I drive you with my hot breath to your body lying on the shore.
Run into your body! Run!
I blow your log-body to the shore!
I take you by the roots and pull you out!
Spirit, return to the body!
The spirit's returned...
Gerlost, come here!
He's alive.
Come to me. I need warmth and to feel a man next to me.
Anni, you just rest.
You were banging the drum and shrieking all night.
I'm not called Anni.
My parents called me Cuckoo.
People called me Lame.
My husband called me Anni.
But my real name's Cuckoo.
Gerlost, come to me.
Thanks, my dear, for everything.
For the bread and salt.
Don't be angry about anything.
You're a good woman.
Thank you, Anni.
What're you waiting for?
I've got a lot to do.
Go. It's not my loss.
I'm going that way.
A long way, but I'll make it!
Good luck, Gerlost.
My name's Ivan.
Yes, that's what all
Russians are called.
Gerlost Ivan.
And you get lost too.
They parted on that hill.
The snow came early that year.
They left.
One that way, the other in that direction, to their homes.
They were strong and brave people.
They'd have made good hunters.
But the war made them do bad things, and they tired of it.
They understood that, and stopped fighting each other.
They became friends, and helped me with the chores.
They always helped each other.
A bad man wounded one of them, and the other brought him to me.
I tended his wound, and didn't let him die.
One day, I realized they wanted to return...
...to where their mothers had born them.
I sewed them warm clothing, got food for the journey.
They went to their farmsteads.
And your fathers were named like you.
Gerlost and Veiko...
